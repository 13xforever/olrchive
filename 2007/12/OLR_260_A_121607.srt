00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,920
Tonight, December 16th, 2007, internet radio hits the PSP in one part of the world, Mass

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,600
Effect and Assassin's Creed boast big sales, and how would you feel about a wee rain check

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:31,600
under the tree this Christmas?

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,120
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

5
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,120
Radio.

6
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,440
We are that program on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,520
and the gamer lifestyle.

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always, say hello to the one and only, Dark Sakura,

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yo.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
How you doing, Miss Summers?

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Long day?

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,320
Long weekend?

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,320
I don't know.

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,320
Yeah?

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,320
I'm thinking about it still.

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
I'm making a decision.

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,320
A decision?

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,120
But I can't do it without having, you know, without being fully informed.

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,280
Okay, well that's good.

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,640
You should always be fully informed when making a decision.

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
Yeah.

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,360
And I would like to say a nice decision on your shirt to wear to the show tonight.

24
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,080
I know the Op 11ers can't see it because the way our cam is, but...

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,800
I could go put my boobs in front of the camera.

26
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,760
A lovely, I bet the boys would like that.

27
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
A lovely...

28
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
That's quite all right.

29
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,840
A lovely pyramid head t-shirt she's wearing today with Silenil.

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,640
I'm wearing my very, very favorite long-sleeved shirt.

31
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
Very nice.

32
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
Keeps you warm.

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,160
Pyramid head keeps you warm during these winter months.

34
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,160
Keeps you warm with evil.

35
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,160
All right.

36
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,160
Sounds good.

37
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,880
Say hello as well to the one and only tech master, Loki.

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,880
Hello.

39
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,880
How are you doing, Loki?

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,880
I'm okay, I guess.

41
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,880
You're okay, you guess?

42
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,600
Uh, feeling a little ripped off.

43
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
What happened?

44
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,200
Um, well just a company I've been buying, like, stuff from my new computer with, uh,

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,960
EVGA, and I bought my motherboard and my graphics card from them.

46
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,600
Uh, literally the day after I bought my graphics card, NVIDIA went and redesigned it.

47
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,640
Made it cheaper, faster, and, um, better.

48
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,920
So that sucks.

49
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:06,760
And then, the motherboard that I bought doesn't have an onboard speaker, um, also doesn't

50
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:12,800
have, some of the motherboards have these little LED readouts for error codes.

51
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,480
So mine has none of that.

52
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,840
So, go figure, I go to boot up my computer, and nothing comes up.

53
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,400
So either the graphics card or the motherboard's broken.

54
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,560
Of course, I can't tell what's wrong, since there's no beeps, nor indication of what's

55
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,560
wrong.

56
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,200
And, I'm looking at the motherboard that they sell on EVGA's site, and there's stuff missing

57
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,200
off mine.

58
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,200
Like, um, I don't know, a PCI express slot that's supposed to be there that's not, and

59
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,000
uh, some other shit, so, they're gonna get an angry call tomorrow.

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Sorry to hear that.

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,400
And now you just talked smack about them on your internet show, so, that's just lovely

62
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
to know.

63
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Oh yeah, now they're feeling hurt.

64
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,760
Our always present fourth guest here on the program, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, our chat

65
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,840
room, we always tape live on Sunday nights, I know there's a lot of folks that listen

66
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,120
to us in our taped form on the podcast, um, but, of course listening live is a whole other

67
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,040
element where you get to, uh, do interactivity, um, question from AZHP, which graphics card

68
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,040
was it?

69
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,240
It's a 8800 GTS.

70
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,240
That means nothing to me, I have no idea what that's about.

71
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,480
It's a Nvidia card, they redesigned the GT, um, which made it a little bit faster using,

72
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,680
you know, the 65, uh, nanometer chips, and now they did the same thing with the, uh,

73
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,680
8800 GTS's.

74
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:33,640
So, for example, I paid for my card, it was like, um, let's see here, I think it was about

75
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,640
$364.99.

76
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
Wow.

77
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,560
Yeah, well that sounds, that's, that's quite a bit for a card.

78
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,280
Well here's the best part though, cause see, now I can get an even faster card, I wanna

79
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,560
save for about $100 cheaper.

80
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,560
Which is annoying.

81
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:56,000
I mean, it'll have, it'll have slightly less, um, graphics memory cause I had, uh, 640 megs

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,360
of RAM on there, but let's see here, the one now, the GTS, uh, it'd be 512 megs of, um,

83
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,880
RAM, and, okay, well it's not at that cheaper I guess, it's only, uh, it's $359.99, but

84
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,840
still, okay, it's a little bit cheaper, and it's even faster.

85
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,600
Alright, jeez, suddenly we're turning into the PC, uh, graphics card podcast, but that's

86
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,440
alright cause I know there's a lot of PC gamers who, um, are really into this graphics card.

87
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,800
For me, I just need something to play WoW on, but you all know about that addiction.

88
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,220
Here's what I really wanna ask about though, uh, I noticed you brought one of your Xboxes

89
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,480
with you tonight, I don't know if this is when you wanted to bring this up or not, but

90
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,480
I'm bringing it up.

91
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
Sure.

92
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,940
You gotta show the OP11 people, I know this isn't great for the podcast, but we can kinda

93
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,840
talk about this, you've got your Xbox modded, and I don't mean like the, you know, piracy

94
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,840
mods or whatever, I mean the other ones.

95
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,360
You have like a, you have like a glass thing on your Xbox, that's really cool.

96
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,960
What is this, where did you buy this, why did you do this, can you, can we show this

97
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,960
to the OP11 people?

98
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,120
Um, I have to plug it in for it to look good.

99
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,680
Oh, is it not plugged in?

100
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,680
It's not plugged in right now.

101
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
Oh, okay.

102
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
Remember you said not to plug to me.

103
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,440
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, alright, yeah, yeah, yeah.

104
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,760
You know, I can plug it in real quick.

105
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,520
Yeah, do it real quick, do it real quick.

106
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,040
Hopefully we don't blow a circuit and the, uh, show comes to a screeching halt, but if

107
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,700
we suddenly go off air, you know what happened.

108
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,700
We, uh.

109
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,400
Hey, if it explodes, it'll hit you guys first.

110
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
It's, exactly.

111
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,040
So, Jamie, maybe duck a little bit, uh, have Pyramid Head protect you with his blade while

112
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,440
we do this, and hopefully the folks on cam can see this.

113
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,240
Um, again, there's always, I, I think, I think the archives on OP11 are working again, so

114
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,880
you might be able to see this in the archives on OP11, but yeah, you turn it on, and it

115
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,080
glows blue inside, which I think is all kinds of awesome.

116
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,080
It looks like, it's like how a lot of people have modded their PC cases to do.

117
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,080
That's pretty rad.

118
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,040
Um, okay, I guess the folks in chat have seen enough of that, so, uh, what exactly, why,

119
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
why did you do that?

120
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,520
Was it just for the challenge, or what was it?

121
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,160
Let me, uh, Loki's not near a microphone.

122
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,240
Excellent live radio.

123
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,240
I understand ya.

124
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,180
So why exactly did you, um, decide to mod this and make it blue in there?

125
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,180
Because it's cool.

126
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,520
You just, you just wanted something the other kids didn't have, right?

127
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,520
Exactly.

128
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,520
Alright.

129
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,520
I just, um, I did it to, well, three of them so far.

130
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,040
I still have one more that I haven't done yet, because they're a bitch.

131
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,120
To be honest, though, it may look cool, but it sucks.

132
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
Why is that?

133
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:26,360
Um, the brand of clear case I bought, which I think it was like a ghost case or something

134
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,160
like that, uh, they suck.

135
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,200
They don't fit right.

136
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,560
So for example, you'll notice that one has still the old faceplate on it.

137
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,400
Well, there's a clear faceplate for it.

138
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,080
The problem is it jams DVD drive.

139
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,200
Now, Tigerclaw has a very good point in our chatroom.

140
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,160
Modding the 360 may be cool, but it also voids the warranty, so you just, you know, you don't

141
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,120
care about the warranty, you'll just take your chances.

142
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,880
Yeah, just like I did the other one.

143
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,040
That one was modded in the other way, so.

144
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
I see.

145
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,600
Alright, well, we'll get into that a little later.

146
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
Let's go around and check.

147
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,880
Well, and then, yeah, we'll also, we'll have, you know, the wonderful Christmas light effect

148
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,320
on there, since it's got the flashing green, er, three flashing lights on it.

149
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
It's awesome.

150
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,320
Alright.

151
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,320
The red rings of death.

152
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
Hooray!

153
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Congratulations on that.

154
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,040
Uh, let's, let's go around and ask the question about our gaming weeks, because that's how

155
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,600
we're supposed to start off the show before we get into ooh and aah-ing over a blue 360.

156
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,120
Uh, Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

157
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,640
Um, I had a Christmas present last night.

158
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,240
I have Portal.

159
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,240
Sweet!

160
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,200
Yeah, and I knew that, I totally knew Dan got it for me, because I checked our online

161
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,540
banking, and I saw that, um, he had already told me how much it was used at his store,

162
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,920
and then I saw that much come out of the bank spent at GameCrazy.

163
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,880
And then, that day, I felt a game in my stocking.

164
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,400
I didn't take it out, but I knew what it was.

165
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,480
And so, last night, um, I went in there, um, and was just, uh, playing around with him,

166
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:57,800
and, uh, our friend, well, his friend Will was visiting, and we, uh, Dan said, oh, and

167
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,460
by the way, and took it out of my, uh, stocking, and I was like, hey, cool!

168
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:07,160
And then they were taunting me with it, and then I got it back, and so, uh, Dan, like,

169
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,480
was gonna play, like, a level.

170
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:14,040
He ended up playing, like, up to, uh, the Weighted Companion Cube level.

171
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
Nice.

172
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
It's addicting!

173
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,040
Yeah.

174
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,640
And, um, it was pretty funny.

175
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,600
He was, he was very silly.

176
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:28,080
And then, um, I, uh, played World Cup soccer pinball last night, because I hadn't played

177
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,520
any pinball in a week, and lots of Ragnarok.

178
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
And a little Olendan.

179
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,520
Very cool.

180
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,160
Hey, I gotta ask you, though, um, since, you know, you, you put on your investigative hat

181
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,840
to find out that your husband had bought you the, uh, orange box for Christmas, were you

182
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,560
the type of child that looked under the bed for what mom got you for Christmas, or what?

183
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,520
No, first of all, mom kept everything in the closet, and then, second of all, I, the only

184
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,520
reason...

185
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,920
I like how you know, you have to correct me, like, no, if I wanted to look at the presents,

186
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
I went to the closet.

187
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,440
Well, that's cause, that's where she kept them, cause my mom was not creative.

188
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:10,560
Um, but, I happened to be checking the online banking to see if my bonus got in, and that's

189
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,600
why I was looking.

190
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,720
And then I saw, forty-something dollars spent at Game Crazy, I'm like, oh, gee, who's been

191
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,560
the one talking about wanting orange box for Christmas, and there it was.

192
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,960
So that's when I, I got my investigative hat on when the clue presented itself.

193
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
Very nice.

194
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,800
Did I ever tell you the story about when I got my Super Nintendo when I was twelve?

195
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,080
I don't know if I've told the story on this program, actually I might have been eleven,

196
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,720
I don't remember, but I asked for that for Christmas, and that's all I really wanted,

197
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,320
was the Super Nintendo, right?

198
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,320
And so we opened up all the presents under the tree, and, you know, I saved the big,

199
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,960
big present for last, cause I, I kinda guessed that maybe it was the Super Nintendo I wanted

200
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,240
for Christmas, right?

201
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,120
And so I opened the very last present, and it's a San Francisco Giants jacket.

202
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,120
Ah!

203
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,760
And if you know me, you know I love sports.

204
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,040
So I was, like, crushed, and I was, like, about ready to cry, you know, I didn't, I

205
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,680
didn't want to cry cause I didn't want to look like a baby, but, you know, inside the

206
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,920
gamer nerd in me is, like, wanting to cry and sob and throw things, be the spoiled brat

207
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
I am, right?

208
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,680
Well then, finally, after everybody opens their present, presents, my sister comes to

209
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,680
me with one tiny, tiny, tiny little gift and says, there's one more thing, and on it was

210
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,560
written on an index card, um, a hint, and so I had to find where the next index card

211
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,000
was, and where the next card was, the next card, and finally about five times it took

212
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,640
me, like, out in the garage or something up in the rafters and that's where the Super

213
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,640
Nintendo was.

214
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
That's cool.

215
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,600
And so the moral of the story is I get what I want, cause I'm a spoiled brat.

216
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,180
And I got a Super Nintendo with Super Mario World, and then they bought one more game

217
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,180
for me, right?

218
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,680
You know what game they ended up getting for me?

219
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,140
A game called Drakken, which I don't think anybody ever played, but the reason, it was

220
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:49,360
based on an old PC game, and it wasn't bad, the sequel to it, which I believe was called

221
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,760
Dungeon View, Drakken 2, was awesome, but the first one was a little meh, cause it was

222
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,920
a role-playing game where you didn't really control your characters at all, you just kinda

223
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,000
hoped they would beat the monster in their own way, it was really odd, it was kinda neat

224
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,400
I guess in its own way, but the reason why they bought that, because the guy at Sears

225
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:12,280
told them it was a big seller, and I'm like, okay, to this day, nobody, like, fucking knows

226
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
Drakken.

227
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:19,960
I remember when we bought a PC from Sears a long time ago, or thinking about it, no,

228
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,880
that was crap.

229
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,880
Never buy PCs from them.

230
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,760
I'm looking at comments from chat, this is good.

231
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,400
Tiger Claw says Drakken was a 3D RPG, so I'm not the only one that knows what Drakken is,

232
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,920
I'm sure there's other listeners that go, I remember that game.

233
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,360
Amaze Satsuma, I like this, says, when I was younger, I wasn't only the type to hunt for

234
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,320
my Christmas, I also opened the game boxes and replaced the game inside with the game

235
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,960
I already own.

236
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,840
That's messed up.

237
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:55,120
Actually, another year, my mom went to Target and got all this stuff, and I was like, looking

238
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,160
in the bags, when she came back from Target, not like intentionally, I wasn't really hunting

239
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,000
around for Christmas presents, I was actually looking for candy, like, I wanted to see if

240
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,100
she bought candy, because I wanted candy, and I freaking saw a copy of Fester's Quest

241
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,140
on the NES in one of the bags, and I was like, oh, crap, but then I decided to screw with

242
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,120
my mom later, because we went to the video store and I wanted to rent a game, so I grabbed

243
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,240
the box for Fester's Quest, I'm like, let me rent this game, let me rent this game,

244
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,480
and my mom's like, no, you don't need to rent a game tonight.

245
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
I'm such a bastard.

246
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,720
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

247
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,120
It was okay.

248
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,800
Let's see, I played Saints Row again, more of that, and I played a little bit of Rock

249
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,880
Band last night, actually, that was pretty fun, played more of the drums for that, and

250
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:48,120
then, let's see, Burnout Paradise Demo, it's okay, I like it a lot better than some of

251
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,720
the other Burnout games, because you get to kind of free drive around the city and then

252
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,760
you start events, whatever, definitely don't recommend playing on a small TV, as we were

253
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,040
doing before the show, but it's pretty good otherwise.

254
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:11,360
I like the way the crashes look, I don't know, it's a little hard to see where the shortcuts

255
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,080
and stuff are in the game, but I guess that's why you gotta drive around more and stuff,

256
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,240
but I'll probably pick it up when it comes out in January, and then, let's see, other

257
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,440
than that, I think a little bit more Zelda Phantom Hourglass, pretty much done with that

258
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
game now.

259
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,440
Oh, very cool.

260
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:36,720
Would have been playing Crysis if my computer hadn't fucking sucked, stupid EVGA.

261
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,560
My gaming week, you know, kind of the usual stuff, been playing more World of Warcraft,

262
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,520
of course, Geometry Wars Galaxies, I've been getting a little further in, which I talked

263
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,960
about last week, fucking around with some of the stuff on the Wii, like Pokemon Snap,

264
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:54,080
awesome, you really can save pictures to the Wii message board, it kind of took me a little

265
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,480
bit to figure out how to do it, but basically if you have Pokemon Snap, you take the pictures,

266
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,820
by the way, Pokemon Snap doesn't control quite as nice as I remember it, like the controls

267
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,120
are kind of shitty, but the game itself is fun.

268
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,600
You know, you take the pictures of the Pokemon, right, and you can save your favorites to

269
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,200
this gallery.

270
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,960
If you back out all the way to the main menu and then go into gallery, you can look at

271
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,040
the pictures you took, but the Nintendo 64 kind of up-reses them from when you took them

272
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,480
in game to I guess the highest quality picture the Nintendo 64 could render.

273
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,360
When you're in that mode, you hit the minus key on your classic controller, and that is

274
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,080
what will post your picture to the Wii message board, and you can only post one a day, but

275
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,800
you can send the pictures, like I took a picture and I didn't know who to send it to, so I

276
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,520
sent it to Bobby Blackwolf because I thought he'd get a kick out of it, because something

277
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,080
told me Bobby's probably not a Pokemon Snap fan, so I took a dumb little picture of like

278
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,520
Pikachu or something and sent it to Bobby, so hopefully he got it.

279
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,520
I don't know, I didn't hear his show tonight to see if he said that he got any mail from

280
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,520
me, but we'll see.

281
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,760
I think that's a cute little feature, but you can only do that once a day, which is

282
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,560
kind of weird, but I'm assuming that must be the way the files are saved within the

283
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,560
Wii message board.

284
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,800
You don't want to fill up the hard drive with all these crappy Pokemon pictures, but that's

285
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,800
kind of cool.

286
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,880
Okay, VX JasonXVR, a webmaster, wants me to send the picture to him, so I will do that

287
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,680
a little later, absolutely.

288
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,020
And he's doing the Check Me Out channel.

289
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,400
Some other stuff I've looked at, I actually looked at this last week, but I forgot to

290
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,400
mention it on the show.

291
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,720
Xbox 360, a little demo came out for a game called Cultsep Saga, and the thing about Cultsep

292
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,760
is it was kind of like a cult game, if you will, on the PlayStation 2, where not a lot

293
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,840
of people had heard of it or played it, but it's a great game.

294
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:39,160
I love Cultsep on the PlayStation 2, and if you've read any reviews about this game, most

295
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,480
of the reviews on it are pretty accurate.

296
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,160
It's Monopoly meets Magic the Gathering, where you're moving around this board, and you're

297
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,320
trying to collect the most magical points, and you do that by laying these monsters down,

298
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,740
and when opponents land on the square where you've put down a monster, they can either

299
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,420
challenge the monster with one of their own monsters, or pay a toll, like, you know, you're

300
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,080
paying boardwalk, so they have to pay with some of their magic.

301
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:06,920
So that's basically the gist of the game, and I think it translated the 360 pretty nicely.

302
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,080
The only downside is that in playing, you know, obviously it's only the demo, I'm basing

303
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,820
my assumptions off the demo, but the demo appeared to be one of the exact same boards

304
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,860
from the PlayStation 2 version, I think the very first board, and it does look like there's

305
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:22,480
some more cards and things, but really it looks like all they've done on the 360 is

306
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,060
made it widescreen and up-resed everything to 720p, because when you're in the battles,

307
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,240
the cards do these cheesy little animations, like if you have a fighter attacking something,

308
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,520
a giant sword will swing and cut the card in half, or if you have these wolves attacking

309
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:42,000
whatever, giant jaws will descend on the other card, it's so cheesy, and you'd think they

310
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,240
would have changed some of that for the Xbox 360, like maybe they could have had these

311
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,920
really cool cutscene battles with the cards, but they didn't do it for whatever reason,

312
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:56,240
so I imagine the biggest draw to this game is going to be the Xbox Live Play, which I

313
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,960
can't imagine this game doesn't have, I mean I don't know for sure if it's in there, but

314
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,880
I can't imagine it doesn't, because you weren't able to do that on the PlayStation 2 version,

315
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,640
but it's a fun game, I like that game a lot.

316
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,880
RossdielUT says, Skye, seriously, this even sounds boring.

317
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,760
It's not for somebody who likes a fast action paced game, but if something like Puzzle Quest

318
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,160
is more up your alley, or something you think before you make your moves and stuff like

319
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,880
that, it's fun, it's certainly not fast paced, so there you have it.

320
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,640
Speaking of card games, I just wanted to mention, I vaguely remember the amount, because it

321
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:37,400
wasn't that much, but a little update to the Eye of Judgment sales in the US, I think we

322
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:44,160
sold yet another 17,000 units last month, so we're up to a whopping 32,000-ish around

323
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
there.

324
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,240
So 32,000 Eye of Judgment units sold, and the goal is, again, 1 million for Loki to

325
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,560
wear the tingle suit here on the program.

326
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,680
Good luck with that, I don't think he'll sell 1 million, period.

327
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,920
One other quick assessment, a game I completely judged based off the demo alone, which I know

328
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,600
is a big no-no, but I'm just putting that out there in front.

329
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,800
That new arcade release this week on Xbox, Arcadian Warriors, is that what it's called?

330
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,240
It's kind of like Diablo, which is pretty rad, because I think a game like Diablo would

331
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,840
be rad on Xbox 360, but I couldn't help but feel like it was just a bit of button mashing,

332
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,160
and I don't know if that's just because Fighter is the only class you can play in the demo.

333
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:26,400
I love the idea of a quest RPG fantasy type of game on Xbox Live Arcade, but this didn't

334
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,840
make me go, oh, I've got to buy the full game.

335
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,240
I love the fact that when I was kind of first playing it, I was like, wow, this is kind

336
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,080
of like Diablo, but then as I was playing it more and more, I was like, wow, this is

337
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,520
kind of repetitive.

338
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,840
So I don't know, I wish a friend of mine had the full version so I could get a taste of

339
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,520
what some of the other classes play like, but unfortunately that's not the way it's

340
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
set up.

341
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,520
So there it is.

342
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,840
All right, well, that's it for our gaming weeks.

343
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,760
No special guests in the studio tonight, just the three of us.

344
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,760
And Harvey.

345
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,760
All right.

346
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,760
Who's Harvey?

347
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,760
He's the giant rabbit.

348
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,760
The giant rabbit?

349
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,360
Well, we have some of our, we have Pikachu and Kirby behind us and Cartman.

350
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,360
That's rude.

351
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,600
And the cleared up in chat room, yeah, the 32,000 was domestic sales.

352
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,200
I have no idea what it's selling worldwide.

353
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,160
I can guarantee, though, it's not anything over 100,000 units already, so.

354
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,160
I'm fairly confident that, you know, it's never going to sell a million units.

355
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,400
Ross Steel UT in chat says, kind of like Diablo equals kind of repetitive, am I right?

356
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
I don't know.

357
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,160
I didn't get that same feeling from Diablo, but I think a lot of the strength that Diablo

358
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,600
had was the multiplayer mode, and to be fair, I didn't get to try that mode out on this

359
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,000
demo yet, so maybe that's where this game shines is being able to do multiplayer.

360
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,920
That might make the game a hell of a lot more fun, so that's why I put that disclaimer out

361
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,920
there.

362
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,720
I'm completely basing my judgment of this game off the demo.

363
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,840
But then again, that's what a lot of Xbox users do, so if you're going to put a demo

364
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,920
out there, you know, make sure it sells everything the game's got in it, right?

365
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,920
Am I right?

366
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,920
Yeah.

367
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,000
In fact, I think I'm going to change the bet a little bit to make it a little bit more

368
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,520
fair for everybody.

369
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,280
If the game ever sells a million units, and this could be like five years from now, it'll

370
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,280
still happen.

371
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,280
Okay?

372
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,280
Wow.

373
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,280
Ever.

374
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,360
Loki's given a little on the bet and says if the game can ever sell a million, a million

375
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,420
worldwide even?

376
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,420
Million worldwide.

377
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,420
Alright, nice.

378
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:20,320
If the game can sell a million worldwide ever, then Loki will wear the Tingle Suit.

379
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,520
Watch one of our listeners win the lottery and buy 900,000 of them, just watch it.

380
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,640
So it might be like three years from now.

381
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,560
I hope we're still doing this show three years from now or, you know, that could happen like

382
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,760
in 30 years and Loki's, you know, getting old going, what do you mean I gotta wear this

383
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,760
suit?

384
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,760
Alright.

385
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
I have judgment.

386
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,760
I don't remember that game.

387
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,760
What the fuck?

388
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,760
Alright.

389
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:48,280
Let's get into some housekeeping tonight before we start tonight's news of the gaming type.

390
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,640
There is no show next week.

391
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
We're not gonna be here next week.

392
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,680
We're taking December 23rd off for the holidays because Dark Soccer, myself and Loki all have,

393
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,760
you know, family and friends stuff to attend to.

394
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,880
So we're not gonna be here on December the 23rd.

395
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,960
However, for those of you that listen live, it is my understanding there is a very special

396
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:11,080
OLR Christmas that's gonna happen thanks to some of our other OLR personalities, so stay

397
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,280
tuned for that.

398
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,520
That will not hit the podcast feed, but it will go up on our MySpace and our live journal

399
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,060
and Facebook and all the fan communities we have.

400
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,200
You will still be able to grab a recorded copy of whatever mischief happens on the station

401
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,660
next Sunday, which I'm sure is gonna be very interesting.

402
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:30,500
We will be back on December 30th for our year-end special, and more to come on the website.

403
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,000
About that, a little closer to the day.

404
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,240
Also, I need to wish one of our listeners.

405
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,280
Sephiroth1215 had a birthday yesterday, so I'm supposed to say happy birthday.

406
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,860
And I know he's been a longtime listener of the show and has come out and met him in New

407
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,740
York City on some of the OLR meetups and stuff, so happy birthday!

408
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,740
Happy birthday.

409
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,740
Thank your mother.

410
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,740
Thank your mother.

411
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,740
Yes.

412
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,740
For having you.

413
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,740
Yes.

414
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,740
For giving birth.

415
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,740
Good idea.

416
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,740
All right.

417
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,740
Anyways.

418
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,740
Gaming news time, yes?

419
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,740
Yes.

420
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,740
All right.

421
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,740
So starting the show off here.

422
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,740
Guitar Hero 3.

423
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,400
It's getting a brand new patch to fix a few things and add a couple things.

424
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:12,000
Some of the things that they're fixing, improving the online quick match results, and also adding

425
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,520
a calibration screen improvements, I guess.

426
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,240
So that's kinda cool.

427
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,520
And also, one of the things that they're adding for PlayStation 3 users, the co-op quick play

428
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
mode.

429
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,880
So, other than that, various other stability improvements and fixes.

430
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,440
I wish they'd add some new characters or something.

431
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
I don't know.

432
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,440
I don't know.

433
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,840
But, other than that also, there's also going to be a new download pack, and they've added

434
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:46,400
two different ones, one of which is from the Warner Reprise track pack, I guess.

435
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:53,320
And that's going to include Pretty Handsome Awkward by The Used, Sleeping Giant by Mastodon,

436
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,920
and No More Sorrow by Linkin Park.

437
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:04,320
Also, they have single download packs, including some, I guess, from popular European bands.

438
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:15,640
So Peyoso by Extremaduro, and Antisocial by Trust, and Erton Was We're Sayin' by Durf

439
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,640
and Fantisian Vere.

440
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,640
I don't know.

441
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,160
I probably butchered all that stuff.

442
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:24,920
And then, I guess, a free exclusive rock rendition of a holiday classic, We Three Kings by Steve

443
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,920
Oymette.

444
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,120
You know what's kind of funny, though?

445
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,400
I would have hoped that they would have had more Christmas songs and stuff, like get the

446
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,200
London Symphony Orchestra or something like that stuff in there, or the Trans-Siberian

447
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
Orchestra.

448
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
That has that.

449
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
Twisted Sister Christmas.

450
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
I like that idea.

451
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Twisted Sister Christmas.

452
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,320
A friend of mine's been linking me to a lot of the songs on them because someone uploaded

453
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,320
them on YouTube.

454
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,080
But seriously, though, Trans-Siberian Orchestra, that would be perfect.

455
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,760
You can even do that as a free download pack.

456
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,760
I like free.

457
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,760
Free is good.

458
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
Especially for Christmas.

459
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,760
Come on.

460
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,760
Or the holidays.

461
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,760
Sorry.

462
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,760
We have to say the politically correct term.

463
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,760
The holidays.

464
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:05,800
Credit to Activision or Harmonix, I'm going to say Activision, for actually giving a free

465
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,720
song for Guitar Hero 3.

466
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,120
But the rest of those packs, of course, is going to be $6.25.

467
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,360
There you have it.

468
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,760
Now here's why I never wish listeners a happy birthday on the program, because of course

469
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:23,240
now we had someone else pipe up and Footy Monster says, it was my birthday last week

470
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,240
too.

471
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,600
Happy birthday, Footy Monster.

472
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,160
In fact, just so we don't get any more emails going, it was my birthday, it was my birthday,

473
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,280
and all that stuff.

474
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,680
If you had a birthday between December 9th and December 15th, which would have been last

475
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,640
week, or today, December 16th, happy birthday to you.

476
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,360
The rest of you, sit on it and wait for your turn.

477
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,080
Just to you a few.

478
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,160
Happy unbirthday to you.

479
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,680
All right.

480
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,960
Speaking of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, there's drama.

481
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,960
I mean, it's like these two are having some real drama, pillow fights and everything between

482
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,960
them.

483
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
But here it is.

484
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,560
You know how, of course, there's the compatibility issues with the guitar.

485
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,420
Well, what was supposed to happen is that Rock Band was going to get an update on the

486
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:10,800
PlayStation 3 so that the Guitar Hero 3 controller will work with it.

487
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:16,240
Well, it didn't happen, and Harmonix took to their forums to explain the reason why.

488
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,040
Two weeks ago, Harmonix created a software patch for the Sony PlayStation 3 version of

489
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:25,120
Rock Band that allowed for guitar compatibility and support for third-party peripherals, including

490
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,240
enabling use of Activision's Guitar Hero 3 controller with Rock Band.

491
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,520
The compatibility patch was submitted, approved, and had been scheduled for release by Sony

492
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,320
on Tuesday, December 4th.

493
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,200
Unfortunately, Activision objected to the compatibility patch's release.

494
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,680
The patch remains with Sony, but we have been told that it will unfortunately not be released

495
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,360
due to Activision's continued objection.

496
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,840
So, you know, boo Activision to doing that.

497
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:54,120
I'm sure they had their own reasons, money, motivating people to just go out and buy little

498
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
wine bitches.

499
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
I don't know.

500
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
I don't know.

501
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,120
That's kind of too bad.

502
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,160
Well, did you see the whole thing where Activision was blaming Harmonix for that, saying it's

503
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,160
their fault?

504
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,360
Because that's kind of stupid.

505
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,360
No.

506
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,360
What happened to that?

507
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,360
So, Activision followed up and said, no, it's Harmonix's fault.

508
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,360
It's their fault.

509
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,840
I don't even remember the reasoning why.

510
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,640
I'm like, well, why would they not do that?

511
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,000
Is it their fault because they left, you know, Activision to make a game with another company?

512
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Is that why?

513
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,400
It's your fault that you left.

514
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:24,720
I mean, it's like getting caught in the middle of exes fighting, and that's never any fun.

515
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,800
Like, I don't know if you've been in that situation where you're caught in the middle

516
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,000
of these two exes, but that's what it feels like, and you know what?

517
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,440
We all lose when that happens, so boo to everybody involved for not being able to kiss and make

518
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
up.

519
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,580
There's a lot more whiny bitchery happening.

520
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:45,840
There is a class action lawsuit now going on against Activision for the whole mono sound

521
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,720
on the Wii edition of Guitar Hero 3.

522
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:55,840
They're saying that they willfully deceived the consumer with a statement that it had

523
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,400
Dolby Pro Logic 2 surround sound instead of mono.

524
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,160
There's a universe of difference between Dolby and mono.

525
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,160
So

526
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,280
It's a scam, but still, lawsuit?

527
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:16,400
Well, you know they've promised to put out replacement discs that have the sound issue

528
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
corrected?

529
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,720
Activision's not making any comment, though.

530
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:26,520
I don't think that they really, it's in their best interest to make a comment at this time.

531
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,360
Not while they're going through litigation.

532
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,960
Probably not, especially when they're trying to fix things, but I would think if anybody

533
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,040
wants to bring the smackdown on Activision, it ought to be Nintendo.

534
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,760
Not the consumer suing them in this whole thing.

535
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,280
I don't think the consumer is suing Nintendo, I think they're suing Activision.

536
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,940
Yeah, but I'm saying if anybody should put the smackdown on Activision, it ought to be

537
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:52,000
Nintendo, because Nintendo should go to Activision and go, you gave us a subpar version of the

538
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,520
game, then what you gave the other systems, naughty, naughty, naughty, you know, that

539
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,520
whole thing.

540
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,880
I wouldn't be surprised if they would do something too.

541
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,240
Everything's a subpar version on the Wii.

542
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,240
I guess that's true.

543
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,240
I disagree.

544
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,160
It's not just powerful, I mean in terms of graphics, so you have that whole thing as

545
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,160
well.

546
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,320
No, look at like, okay, look for example, Far Cry, Instincts on the Wii.

547
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,320
It was crap.

548
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,960
It had two player deathmatch, woohoo, two players.

549
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,900
Wow, you really pushed yourselves there, and you know, some of the other control issues

550
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:26,840
that they have, a lot of crappy ports of games, I'm looking at you Ubisoft, and I don't know,

551
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,280
overall they just don't care.

552
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,460
You see, the problem is also I think a lot of these people are used to putting out crappy

553
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:36,200
games without, you know, quality checking them very thoroughly because they can patch

554
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,840
them now on the PlayStation 3 and the, you know, Xbox 360.

555
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,280
I guess it's Nintendo's fault for not having a wonderful patch system so they can release

556
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,520
this crap and then fix it later.

557
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,560
Oh well, anyways.

558
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:54,320
One thing that's also going to need to be fixed is getting Rock Band to Canada.

559
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,200
Luckily though, they have confirmed now that Rock Band will be coming to Canada December

560
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,680
20th.

561
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:06,440
So a slight delay from, I don't know, November 20th, but at least you'll be able to play

562
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,640
it.

563
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,640
Hopefully you can find a copy.

564
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,740
Oh yeah, if you're waiting for the PlayStation 2 version in Canada, well they haven't really

565
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,160
confirmed on when that's coming too, so.

566
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,360
But seriously, why settle for Rock Band on the PlayStation 2?

567
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,920
Because with the amount you're going to pay for that, you really ought to just put that

568
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,520
down towards another console, right?

569
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,800
Am I right?

570
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,100
Well, here's the thing.

571
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:31,220
If you do buy it on PlayStation 2, at least if you do get a new console later that happens

572
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:36,760
to be PlayStation 3, you can use all the instruments from that on the PlayStation 3 version, because

573
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,760
they are identical.

574
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,320
Yeah, but then you have to buy a PlayStation 3, and I don't know if everybody wants to

575
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,320
do that.

576
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,320
Good point.

577
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,320
Alright.

578
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:50,560
Well, anyhow, moving on to other PlayStation 3 games, including one that I know a lot of

579
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:55,440
people are excited about, Metal Gear Solid 4 could be the game that definitely drives

580
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,040
sales of the PlayStation 3, and another little perk included in the game to further make

581
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,160
people want to buy this.

582
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,240
Remember an earlier story, which I think was blown out of proportion, but nevertheless

583
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,600
it was reported on previously that Metal Gear Solid was supposed to move a million units

584
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,120
in its first day in order to recover the cost or whatever?

585
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,400
It would need to, yeah.

586
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,400
Yeah.

587
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,800
Well, this could do it, because this is another inclusion that's pretty awesome, and this

588
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,160
came from PlayStation, the official magazine, and their latest issue.

589
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:27,560
They have confirmed that Metal Gear Online is going to be included, or at least, sorry,

590
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,520
there's going to be like a demo version of it, or some type of limited version of Metal

591
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,560
Gear Online included with Metal Gear Solid 4, Guns of the Patriots.

592
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:41,160
Actually, no, I take that back, it was originally going to be two separate games, and now it

593
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,000
looks like actually they are going to be coming together with one game.

594
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,600
And Metal Gear Online will have 16 player support, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, King

595
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,440
of the Hill, Team Sneak, could this be PlayStation 3's version of Halo 3?

596
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,440
Who knows?

597
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,440
Well, certainly not.

598
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,440
No.

599
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,960
Well, they're different types of games, of course, and you could say Unreal Tournament

600
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,600
is kind of their Halo, but, you know, kind of neat.

601
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,040
I don't know, though, that's just like saying Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops was its own

602
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,560
game, and then the online portion was another game.

603
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:12,040
It's still the same damn game, and the college is Metal Gear Online, so Metal Gear 4, the

604
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,020
online portion of it, I think it's stupid.

605
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,160
It's kind of deceiving the buyer.

606
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,560
I think here's where it comes from, why is this just a demo or is this a full game, is

607
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:27,280
because they are saying in the magazine, quote, expecting five maps in the starter pack that

608
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,520
will provide the basic setup to get your Metal Gear Solid multiplayer fix moving.

609
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:36,680
So is starter pack a fancy term for demo, or is starter pack something like a luminous

610
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,580
starter pack that you get on Xbox 360 Arcade, and then you have to buy all these freaking

611
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,920
add-ons to get more stuff for it?

612
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,920
Like the mad-ons.

613
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,920
Who knows?

614
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,920
That's true.

615
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,040
This is a little off topic, but it is talking about Konami, though.

616
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,040
All right, sure, why not?

617
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,200
I don't know if you noticed the first download pack for DDR Universe 2's up.

618
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,800
Yeah, I did actually notice that the other day, because I was poking around the marketplace,

619
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,840
because I myself was downloading the Burnout Paradise demo, I just haven't gotten a chance

620
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,640
to play it yet, and I did notice that.

621
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,520
I saw there were downloads for Universe 2.

622
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,960
Nothing I'm really excited about, though.

623
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,400
Well, because all the songs, from what I understand, are just crossing over from the Xbox series.

624
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
The original Xbox series.

625
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,400
I thought there was one I didn't recognize, but that's it.

626
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,360
Luckily, I can buy them separately, so I don't have to buy all the crappy ones.

627
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,880
But you get a discount if you buy all the crap together.

628
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,480
Nope, sorry.

629
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,800
I like how they try to trick you to do that kind of stuff.

630
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:32,000
Hey, if you buy ten bags of potatoes, you get them for a buck.

631
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,760
You know, ten for a dollar, really, there are ten for ten dollars.

632
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,520
Jamie, Loki's talking about potatoes.

633
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,120
Please save us.

634
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,840
How about some ass hattery from Sony?

635
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,840
Alright.

636
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:55,640
Well, the Sony CEO, Howard Stringer, is full of crap, because he's quoted as saying,

637
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,840
I'm happy the Wii seems to be running a bit short of hardware.

638
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:06,120
The PlayStation 3 will come into its own because its games are infinitely more fun, demanding,

639
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,120
and exciting.

640
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,400
Yeah, that's bullshit.

641
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,120
Wait, the Wii is short on hardware?

642
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:17,680
I mean, there's a variety of third-party things out there for the Wii.

643
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,640
Granted, most of them are shit.

644
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,760
Like I think about that little plastic golf club and stuff that you can get, the little

645
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,760
fake tennis racket.

646
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,600
But, you know, there's the Wii Zapper and stuff.

647
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,680
I mean, they're meaning the Wii itself.

648
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,960
So they're just saying, like, the Wii just isn't as fun as the PlayStation 3?

649
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,960
Pretty much.

650
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,960
I dispute that claim.

651
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,420
I've had a lot more fun playing games on Wii than on PS3.

652
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,480
The Wii is a lot of fun.

653
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,440
I mean, granted, you know, it's not that the PlayStation 3 is horrible, but right now it's

654
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,440
kind of close.

655
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,480
Well, they're thinking that they're going to sell more PlayStation 3s, but honestly,

656
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,960
we saw the stack at Best Buy, you know, and it's not just at that one.

657
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,400
It's at a multitude of stores that they're not moving the units.

658
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,600
People want a Wii.

659
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,580
He does understand that the reason there are no Wiis is because people want them so bad,

660
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:10,080
and so they keep selling out, whereas the PlayStation 3 doesn't have that problem because

661
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,040
they're not selling out.

662
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:17,840
I mean, I don't understand, and where does he get off saying, you know, that their games

663
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,500
are more fun?

664
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,360
Because if you like first-person shooters and broken games, that's awesome.

665
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,580
I see the PlayStation 3 has a lot of potential.

666
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,580
It does have potential.

667
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,840
It just hasn't done anything.

668
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,000
I watched that trailer for Final Fantasy 13.

669
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,440
There's a new one that came out this week and it looks fucking amazing.

670
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,000
It looks absolutely fucking amazing.

671
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,080
It's fucking amazing when it comes out Christmas 2009, but I'm not going to wait that long

672
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,080
for that shit.

673
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:46,360
And I am so all over a PlayStation 3 like, I don't know, like candy, like a fat kid on

674
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:52,640
candy, but that trailer is amazing, but for right now, there's not a lot that's making

675
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,360
me want to get a PlayStation 3.

676
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,840
If they had that at launch, we wouldn't be talking about that.

677
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,680
We'd be like saying, wow, look at the PlayStation 3.

678
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,800
It's selling millions and millions of units, and Final Fantasy 13 is fucking awesome.

679
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,400
I can play this all day long.

680
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,640
But no, it's just, the problem is it's not going to come out for a long time and we got

681
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,160
more stories talking about some of the other things that were promised to be out earlier,

682
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:17,520
you know, in 2008, but are probably not.

683
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:23,780
So well, just to illustrate a point, Dan says that he gets about maybe 50 calls a day for

684
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:28,880
people asking for a Wii, and I don't think he's mentioned anyone calling it at all for

685
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,880
a PS3.

686
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,200
RustyLUT in chat makes a good point, the Wii is selling on fat appeal.

687
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,160
Look for the shitty software sales for even the good games, right, Zack and Wiki?

688
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,320
Although granted, when you consider the Wii, now my thing is, the Wii is selling to families,

689
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:48,240
and so games like Zack and Wiki that might be good games for people who follow the gaming

690
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,800
scene and read game reviews, that doesn't quite catch mom's eye, but you know, games

691
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,700
based on movies and all that stuff, and Mario, like Super Mario Galaxy, that kind of shit

692
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,700
catches mom's eye.

693
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,560
And when Wii Fit comes out over here, it's going to start all over again.

694
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:06,920
I think he kind of has a point, the Wii does make a lot of its sales on fat appeal, but

695
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,760
I mean, that's money for Nintendo, and when this whole Wii Fit thing comes out, I'm going

696
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,740
to tell you, it's going to happen all over again, it's going to continue this fad craze

697
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:21,360
of the Wii until 2008, and I just hope it's a good game, and fun, and useful.

698
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,440
Who cares how they're selling systems, at least they're selling systems, you can't even

699
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:29,840
fucking pick a damn approach to how they're selling your systems, oh it's a PC, oh it's

700
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:34,500
a Blu-ray player, oh it's a game system, you can't fucking make your mind up.

701
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,320
So whatever, at least it's selling.

702
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,720
Alright, let's move on.

703
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,040
If we want to pay attention to these analysts and say, oh yeah, the PS3 is going to take

704
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,440
over in 2011, oh good for them, by that time the next system will be coming out.

705
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:53,400
Anyways, so the PSP got some pretty cool improvements with the new Japanese firmware, one of which

706
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,640
we're never going to see over here, but that's fine, it's a new DVR, but that's for their

707
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,000
TV service that they have, because they have the TV card.

708
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,720
The other thing though, which I hope we see over here, and hopefully we'll be able to

709
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,080
utilize, is internet radio.

710
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,800
You'll actually be able to tune in different channels, I think it's over Shoutcast actually,

711
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,720
yeah it is powered by Shoutcast, so that's kind of cool that they have that kind of support,

712
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:23,440
I know for a while there they had the Homebrew PSP radio that you could use and it looks

713
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,200
kind of similar, so, you know, we need to broadcast on Shoutcast.

714
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,160
I was going to say, OLRPSP.com I think needs an update badly, especially if that ends up

715
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,160
coming out over here.

716
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,160
We need people to be able to listen to OLR.

717
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,080
Well, we don't broadcast over Shoutcast though.

718
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:40,240
Well sort of, I think you can tap the live 365 feed into Shoutcast somehow.

719
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,240
No.

720
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,240
Can't you?

721
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,240
No.

722
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,240
Damn it!

723
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,240
I don't know how, at least.

724
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,240
Interesting.

725
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,240
If you could, that'd be awesome.

726
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,120
I'm going to have to do that, because I know we get emails once in a while from people,

727
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,120
right?

728
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,840
That say we listen on PSP, we listen on PSP.

729
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,200
If that stuff comes out over here, heck, even if it doesn't come out over here, I bet there's

730
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,520
got to be at least a handful of people that listen on their PSPs to this program in Japan.

731
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,200
We ought to be able to let them listen live on their PSPs.

732
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,200
Why not?

733
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,200
Why not?

734
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,120
Get on that, Loki!

735
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,120
Make it happen!

736
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,760
Oh, well let me just figure out how to broadcast on Shoutcast, that'd be awesome.

737
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,600
Hey, you do that homework assignment.

738
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,000
I've already tried doing that stuff.

739
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,080
I can't figure it out.

740
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,480
I'm too stupid.

741
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,960
Sorry to hear that.

742
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,280
Let's get to some release dates.

743
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,680
Speaking of our friends over in Japan, I've got the Japanese release dates for you coming

744
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,000
on the Xbox 360, December 20th.

745
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,640
FIFA 08 World Class Soccer comes out in Japan.

746
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,920
Moving on with the release dates, we also have a release of FIFA 08 on the PlayStation

747
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,000
3.

748
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,600
The GunCon makes its way to the PlayStation 3 separately, I assume.

749
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,960
Oh no, Time Crisis finally comes out in Japan as well.

750
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,100
It's a little later down my list here.

751
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:47,160
So Time Crisis 4 makes its way to the PlayStation 3 in Japan this week, also on the 20th.

752
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:52,240
Medal of Honor Airborne also makes its way from EA to the PlayStation 3 in Japan this

753
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,280
week.

754
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,440
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Crazy Climber Wii.

755
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,360
Remember we reported on this earlier a couple months ago.

756
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:04,440
They were remaking the classic 80s game Crazy Climber for the Wii.

757
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,760
Japan will finally get its first look at that this week.

758
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,360
And maybe we will soon, too.

759
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,360
Who knows?

760
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,840
Mr. Robinson's from Disney makes its way to the Japanese market December 20th with their

761
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,140
own game on the Wii.

762
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,080
Another port of FIFA 08 as well.

763
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:24,360
And SpongeBob SquarePants, Attack of the ToyBots, comes out as well from THQ on December 20th.

764
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,680
Cats with a Z2 and Dogs with a Z2.

765
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,480
If you thought this was the only country that got those shitty games with Zs on the end

766
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,960
They're not bad, actually.

767
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,300
Nintendo Wii, really?

768
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,480
They're not that bad.

769
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,480
Really?

770
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,480
Cats, too.

771
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,480
I want to hear about this.

772
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,480
I want to hear about this.

773
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,000
They're not awesome, but they're not horrible.

774
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,040
Cats 2 actually got a pretty decent review.

775
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:50,960
It's funny because they even have that stupid frog cat that you see on Caturday and stuff

776
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,960
like that.

777
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,960
They have that kind of stuff.

778
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,000
You literally can dress up your animals like that.

779
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,960
But then your cat will hate you.

780
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,360
Dark Deceus is right there.

781
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,720
Cats 2 equals frog cat.

782
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,560
It seriously does have the frog cat on there.

783
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:10,960
So it's stupid, but hey, over here, at least in the United States, it's only like 30 bucks.

784
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,520
So wait, find one to use for like 10 bucks or something like that.

785
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,520
There you go.

786
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,720
Or if you feel like paying twice as much, you could import the one from Japan.

787
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,400
I'd rather not because it's already out over here.

788
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,820
There's no point importing.

789
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:29,920
Moving on with other release dates, the PlayStation 2 is getting some releases as well.

790
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,720
Myself Yourself is a game that's coming out.

791
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,000
There's a limited edition of it as well on the 20th.

792
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,480
Another game called Pia Carrot y Yokoso, G.O.

793
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,560
Summer Fair.

794
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,560
Also has a limited edition.

795
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,760
Pia Carrot's old school too.

796
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,720
That's an old school anime, right?

797
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,080
The games have been out for quite a while.

798
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:53,240
Well, I guess it's another one coming out December 20th, just in time for Christmas

799
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,860
over in Japan.

800
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:00,280
Looking at a couple other games, I want to see if there's anything on the DS or PSP because

801
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,000
of course those are always crazy.

802
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,040
Port of Meet the Robinsons on the DS.

803
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,880
Doko Demo Pilates comes out.

804
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,880
That's not pirates.

805
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,600
That's Pilates comes out in Japan as well.

806
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
Dora Base.

807
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:17,480
Doraemon Chow Yaku Gaiden comes out from Namco on the Nintendo DS.

808
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,000
A puzzler called DS Puzzler.

809
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,760
Numpla DS Puzzler comes out as well on the Nintendo DS.

810
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,560
And I'm sure a lot of people are very excited about this.

811
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,960
This is one that folks might even be importing.

812
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,560
Final Fantasy IV, the remake, hits Japan this week on the Nintendo DS.

813
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,200
I'm sure that's going to be the best selling game of the week as far as the new stuffs

814
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,200
go.

815
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,680
I like the sound of this game though.

816
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,080
Pinky Street Kira Kira Music Night.

817
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,080
Ah, fun!

818
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,280
I actually have Pinky Street dolls.

819
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,880
Really?

820
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,080
What they are, they're these little plastic dolls and they're maybe about, I would want

821
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,320
to say like three inches tall.

822
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,320
They're smurf sized.

823
00:41:54,320 --> 00:42:01,000
But anyway, no that's three apples high.

824
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,880
You can take off their heads and change them out and take off their hair and change them

825
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:09,560
out and it's like you snap them into place is how they work.

826
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:14,200
And so they're fully customizable and I guess it would be the same type of thing on the

827
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:19,200
game as you customize your Pinky and I've got like a few of them by now.

828
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,040
They even did Street Fighter and King of Fighters themed ones in Sakura Taisen.

829
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,760
So I've got a few of those.

830
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,280
Oh, very interesting.

831
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,280
Is there any interest in getting this game?

832
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,280
Importing it maybe?

833
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,280
No.

834
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,280
Alright.

835
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,280
After all that.

836
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,280
Alright, that's it for Japanese release.

837
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,160
That's all I'm going to cover on Japanese release dates.

838
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,160
Let's move on.

839
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,060
So is that like, you know, build a human type thing?

840
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,060
Not really.

841
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,060
I'll find a link for the chat room.

842
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,060
I have no idea.

843
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,960
Let's go over to Europe.

844
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,720
Only one game is on the list.

845
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,720
Yeah.

846
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,880
On the 19th Sensible World of Soccer.

847
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,960
Oh, coming out finally to the Xbox 360 Live Arcade.

848
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,960
That is it.

849
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,920
So I guess it's slowing down because it's Christmas time.

850
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,920
I guess so.

851
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,920
How about the US?

852
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,160
The US has got a few things, not as much as usual.

853
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,320
Anyways, a few things.

854
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:16,760
MX vs ATV Untamed coming out on PSP, Playstation 2, Xbox 360, and Playstation 3 and DS.

855
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,800
Elements of Destruction is coming out on DS and that game is kind of neat looking.

856
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:27,240
It's basically, you kind of play mother nature so you can cause tornadoes and fires and stuff.

857
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:33,400
It is also coming to Xbox Live Arcade at some point, so that's kind of neat.

858
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:38,240
And then let's see here, Warhammer 40,000 Squad Command on the DS.

859
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:44,800
Dyson Ryaku Exceed coming to the Playstation 2.

860
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:52,040
And let's see here, also the Playstation 2 of Rock Band, that game is coming out this

861
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,680
week as well.

862
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:59,200
So let's see here, Atari Classics Evolved for the PSP, another one of those compilation

863
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,200
sets.

864
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,720
Luxor 2 on the DS.

865
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:10,840
And Night's Journey of Dreams on the Wii, so you can get your night's fix here pretty

866
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,840
soon.

867
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,840
Jamie's applauding over there.

868
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,920
I'm getting my night's fix already.

869
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,640
Did you ask Santa for that for Christmas?

870
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:22,280
I'm probably going to get it, but we've been playing Christmas night.

871
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:27,440
And then one other thing I was going to mention here real quick, it's not a game but I thought

872
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,040
it's interesting anyways.

873
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,600
Mad Catz is putting out an HDMI conversion kit.

874
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:37,880
It actually, it's for all those people like me that do not have an Xbox 360 with HDMI

875
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,880
out.

876
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:46,360
It plugs into the back of your system and allows you to do HDMI and optical out as well.

877
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:54,960
Although the only sting to it is that it retails for $89.99.

878
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,600
Nintendo announced this week, obviously they're having some issues staying on top of manufacturing

879
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:04,040
enough Wiis for everybody out there, so this is their contingency plan they announced this

880
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,480
week.

881
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:10,240
Reggie Fils-Aime came out this week and said, hey, we're joining up with GameStop.

882
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,600
We're going to create this Wii rain check program.

883
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:18,580
Basically what happens is that if you pay GameStop $250, then you get a rain check that

884
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:24,520
promises you a Wii by January 29th, I believe was the day, the end of next month.

885
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:30,360
So this is for all those people who are having issues trying to get the Nintendo Wii at the

886
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,600
store or what have you.

887
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,840
And the reason why Nintendo wanted to partner up with GameStop is because GameStop really

888
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:40,720
already has it in their system to be able to take these type of deposits for games.

889
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,880
That's at least the reason why they did it.

890
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:48,460
The only days, however, that you can do this, December 20th and 21st are the only days that

891
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:49,840
you are going to be able to do this.

892
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:54,680
However, there are supposed to be tens of thousands of rain checks available and who

893
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:59,900
knows, that may still not be enough for the demand of the console because it's the Furby

894
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,220
of 2007.

895
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,340
It's the Cabbage Patch Kid.

896
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,320
That's the gift of this year.

897
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,200
I waited in line.

898
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,200
For a Wii?

899
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,200
For my Wii.

900
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,200
I know.

901
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,080
I made my roommate wait in line for mine and it worked.

902
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,080
Did very well.

903
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:18,840
See, it just goes to show that sometimes waiting in line for these things actually does pay

904
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,840
off.

905
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,840
Right.

906
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:23,240
But at the same time, how would you feel if you were one of those kids?

907
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,240
Let's flashback.

908
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,760
I told the story earlier in the show about me as the spoiled brat when I was a kid.

909
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,120
Let's flashback to me as the spoiled brat as a kid who wanted a Nintendo Wii this Christmas.

910
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,680
Now I open up my present to get one of these rain checks.

911
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,520
Am I going to be a satisfied kid or am I going to cry?

912
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,280
You're a bad parent if you give your kid a rain check.

913
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,280
Really?

914
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,280
Yeah, I think so.

915
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,280
I think it's an okay alternative.

916
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,240
I mean, the kids aren't going to understand at first, but at the same time, they're going

917
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,240
to get a Wii.

918
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,880
You don't need to wrap up a rain check because they don't fucking understand that.

919
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:58,200
You just say, listen, we couldn't get you one right now, but we will get you one by

920
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,200
the end of January.

921
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,640
You don't have to say, here's a fucking rain check for you.

922
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,680
I mean, that's just like, kids are like, what?

923
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,360
I don't understand this.

924
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,360
I'm not getting a Wii.

925
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,360
Where's the controller?

926
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,360
Where's Mario?

927
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,360
Santa hates me.

928
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:17,160
He's going to go take the rain check and soak it with his tears is what he's going to do.

929
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:22,920
Well you know what, in my family when I was a kid, if there was something that I wanted

930
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,960
and didn't get, I lived with it.

931
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,920
Or you get a job mowing lawns or selling lemonade and you save up and you buy the fucking thing

932
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,920
yourself.

933
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,420
Or I stole it from my brother.

934
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,520
That's exactly what you do.

935
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:42,640
The year you wanted your Super Nintendo and everything, my brothers went into Super Nintendo.

936
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,800
And my mom asked me, should I get them a Super Nintendo or a Genesis?

937
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,140
You need to get them a Super Nintendo and you need to get these games.

938
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,460
She got them a Super Scope, Zelda.

939
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,840
She picked out Home Alone for some retarded reason.

940
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,200
That game sucked ass.

941
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,200
Home Alone?

942
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,960
Kevin McCallister's so cute.

943
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,480
And so my brothers played like five seconds of Home Alone.

944
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,800
And I beat Zelda that week.

945
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,720
Did your brothers even play the Super Nintendo or was this your present?

946
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,240
They played Home Alone and they're like, what did I do bad?

947
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,240
Seriously?

948
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,600
Why am I being punished?

949
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:25,040
No, they actually, my brothers and I played a lot of Blastress and the mole thing.

950
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,120
I'm going to get Jamie a copy of Home Alone on the Super Nintendo for Christmas and wrap

951
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:34,160
it in coal and put it in her stocking.

952
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,960
That'd be great.

953
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:40,120
My little brothers were too busy running around being little terrorists in the neighborhood

954
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,760
so I had the Super Nintendo.

955
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,560
Comments from chat, love it.

956
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:48,840
SSJ100Matt says, dear little Billy, I owe you a wee, love Santa.

957
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,400
Tiger Claw, what if you lose the rain check?

958
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,120
Wouldn't you be screwed?

959
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:57,480
I don't know if you would be because GameStop sucks because they'd be like, oh, you don't

960
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,480
have your receipt.

961
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,760
Sorry, Billy, you ain't ever getting away.

962
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,920
I seem to recall I didn't have my receipt once for a $5 pre-order and they still gave

963
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,580
it to me because it was in the phone number.

964
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:16,200
Not only that, they actually keep a copy of your receipt in the store, a physical copy,

965
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,200
and they file them.

966
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,220
Yeah, see, I've done that before.

967
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,720
They lost my receipt in the store.

968
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,240
I had my receipt still and they gave it to them and showed them and stuff and they're

969
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:32,280
like, well, we can't find your receipt here, so I don't know what to do.

970
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,360
My mommy wrote me a note from Santa that said the elves couldn't find a copy of Hey You

971
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:55,280
Pikachu because the store was sold out and I would get it eventually.

972
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:06,480
Well, seriously, this is why I love the concept of gift cards, especially for me being picky

973
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,480
as a kid.

974
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,360
Again, if I got something I didn't want, I always took it back to the store myself, returned

975
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,800
it myself, and got what I wanted.

976
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,560
Actually, I was just thinking something there.

977
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:19,600
Nintendo's quite smart teaming up with GameStop with this whole rain check thing because if

978
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:24,360
for whatever reason Nintendo can't deliver those Wiiis by the end of January, people

979
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:28,200
are going to be fucking pissed off at GameStop, but no one's going to remember that it's Nintendo's

980
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,200
fault.

981
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,440
I want to hear more about 10-year-old Jamie marching into the store and returning your

982
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,440
gifts.

983
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:44,640
Well, it's like my family would buy me ugly clothes, so I would make them drop me off

984
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,440
at the mall and then I'd go do all my exchanges myself and sometimes I'd get cash back and

985
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:57,320
then go over to Babbage's because we had Babbage's before GameStop took them all over.

986
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,440
You know I'm not going to wear this.

987
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,920
I'm taking it back to get games instead.

988
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,720
Oh my god, shoes.

989
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:12,400
Or if they wouldn't, I would just get a different pair of jeans or something.

990
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:18,280
It wasn't that I was ungrateful or anything.

991
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,640
Or a sick bastard, as GS68 put it.

992
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,960
No, it wasn't that I was ungrateful or anything because I was plenty grateful for the stuff

993
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:31,880
that I got because when I was growing up, we didn't actually have a whole lot of money.

994
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:36,680
When I was in first and second grade, we were actually poverty level.

995
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:44,520
I remember having icicles in my bathtub one winter and I'm not even joking.

996
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:54,080
Now I think I'm really spoiled, but when I was a kid, if I got something, then if it

997
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:58,920
wasn't what I wanted, I found a way to turn it into what I wanted, so it was just a matter

998
00:51:58,920 --> 00:51:59,920
of that.

999
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:06,400
All these kids who say, oh, but I want a Wii, well, tough shit.

1000
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,160
There are no Wiis.

1001
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,160
Get something else.

1002
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,160
You'll live.

1003
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:16,240
Get a job, Billy, Sam, I didn't buy you a Wii because you don't have a job.

1004
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:26,720
No, but you see, I think that there's just way too much of, oh, well, you know, and Dan

1005
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,200
is actually saying, and I'm not going to go into any detail on this, this person is saying,

1006
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,200
oh, I spent all this money in your store and I'm entitled to a Wii.

1007
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,640
Well, we don't have any.

1008
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,760
Tough shit.

1009
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:42,560
I think that people need to learn to be, I guess, to take no for an answer and find something

1010
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,560
else.

1011
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,940
You know, I can just imagine if Jamie had a kid, or maybe I would do this to my kid

1012
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:50,540
and I wasn't able to get a Wii for my kid, I would leave a no under the tree for something

1013
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,540
like this.

1014
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:52,540
This isn't like this.

1015
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:55,720
Santa is very sorry that he could not get you a Wii this year.

1016
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:00,840
He has more important things to do, like ending genocide in Darfur, right?

1017
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,440
He doesn't do any of that kind of crap.

1018
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,440
He just delivers.

1019
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,280
He's a fucking glorified UPS driver is what he is.

1020
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:11,720
No, but seriously, though, all these people that think they need special treatment stuff

1021
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:16,400
or finding Wiis and stuff like that, I get customers asking, you know, yeah, I have someone

1022
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,400
looking for a Wii.

1023
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,320
I'm like, you know, it's like two weeks before Christmas, why the fuck are they just now

1024
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,320
looking for a Wii?

1025
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,600
Why didn't they plan this out?

1026
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,000
Oh, well, they didn't know it was going to be so hard to find.

1027
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,320
Well, tough shit for them.

1028
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,120
Why should we cater to the fact that they're stupid?

1029
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,120
All right.

1030
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,600
I'm sure we've got lots of holiday stories.

1031
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,960
Maybe we'll get some of them in our mailbag later from our listeners.

1032
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,320
I'm not trying to be, you know, all kinds of, you know, rawr on it.

1033
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:46,720
It's just I get kind of irritated with people expecting too much, you know, thinking they're

1034
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:54,040
entitled to something when really what you're entitled to is a roof and food.

1035
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:59,360
Xenocore in chat says, the toughest retail store in the US, Jamie's Gaming Outlet.

1036
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,360
You'll get it when it's here.

1037
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,360
Now, get out of my store.

1038
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,360
Dude, I would do that, too.

1039
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:07,480
All right, let's move on with more news, Jamie.

1040
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,440
What's the latest news at Jamie's Gaming Outlet?

1041
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,920
Hey, virtual console stuff.

1042
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:20,040
For our friends in the UK, we have Pokemon Snap that was on the Nintendo 64 and, you

1043
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,360
know, Pokemon Snap is great and it's fun and lovely.

1044
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,320
And then we have Top Hunter that was on Neo Geo.

1045
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:32,600
Yeah, I didn't really like Top Hunter all that much, so I'm not going to talk about

1046
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,600
it.

1047
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:38,960
The last one, which is almost as cool as Pokemon Snap, but cooler in its own respect, is Mega

1048
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:46,020
Man 2 from Nintendo Entertainment System.

1049
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,720
And if you don't know what Mega Man 2 is, you need to climb out of that cave you've

1050
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,160
been living in for the past 20 years.

1051
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,680
Do they have Mega Man 1 on virtual console over there?

1052
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,680
I don't know.

1053
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:54,880
Or is Mega Man 2 the first game they're getting?

1054
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,560
I think Mega Man 2 is the first.

1055
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:00,160
Dude, I want both and I want Mega Man 3.

1056
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,480
The first one was great.

1057
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,480
It really was.

1058
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,480
Mega Man weapon.

1059
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,080
It was different than all the others, but it was great and it had some awesome music.

1060
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,440
Some of my favorite music ever from a video game was like a Lekkman stage.

1061
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:17,520
But I really liked the metal blades, though, in Mega Man 2.

1062
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:21,560
But I totally loved Mega Man 3 because you had to beat the game with the top, with like

1063
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,040
the most useless weapon.

1064
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,600
Ah, RasteelUT has a good point, though.

1065
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,720
Yeah, I already have Mega Man Collection.

1066
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,980
Good point.

1067
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:32,200
Why not just get the Mega Man Collection and do the backwards compatibility with the GameCube

1068
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,200
disc?

1069
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,200
Good thought.

1070
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,040
F the Virtual Console for Mega Man, huh?

1071
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,960
Yeah, F the Virtual Console.

1072
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,560
Why should I have to buy games again?

1073
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:46,400
Damn you, Nintendo, and trying to get me to purchase stuff I've already purchased again.

1074
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,400
And it works.

1075
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,640
Yeah, stupid Game Boy.

1076
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:54,600
Anyways, one thing that we're going to be getting over here pretty soon, Dragon Quest

1077
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,600
Swords.

1078
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:59,360
It's been announced to come to the US on February 26th.

1079
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,680
It has a really fucking long name.

1080
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,320
Dragon Quest Swords, The Masked Queen, and The Tower of Mirrors.

1081
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,320
Too long of a subtitle.

1082
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,920
But it looks like a pretty fun game.

1083
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:16,640
I have not yet played the Japanese version of it, but you used the Wiimote to slash at

1084
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,120
slimes, so that can't be that bad.

1085
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:22,680
Didn't they have that same thing on the PlayStation 2, I seem to recall?

1086
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:26,640
Like, I remember going to some anime convention and in a back room they had a Dragon Quest

1087
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,160
game, they had a giant sword, and you'd slash slimes.

1088
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,160
I think, yeah.

1089
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,760
Well, they had an arcade version of that.

1090
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,240
They did have an arcade version, so maybe it's the same thing.

1091
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,400
Kind of neat.

1092
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,040
Perhaps, but I guess this is taking a while.

1093
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:43,440
Wasn't this supposed to be a launch game and we're just now getting it?

1094
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,880
Uh, yeah.

1095
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,600
Along with the whole Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles?

1096
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,600
What the F square?

1097
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:49,600
Where the hell did your Wii games go?

1098
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,440
Uh, Crystal Chronicles, I want to say, was like June now.

1099
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,600
Geez, that was supposed to be a launch game.

1100
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,600
Am I crazy?

1101
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,600
No.

1102
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,600
I thought it was.

1103
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,600
No, wait.

1104
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,600
No, no, I'm sorry, not June.

1105
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,600
I'm just kidding.

1106
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,600
But it's only the DS version.

1107
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,000
They haven't announced the Wii version yet.

1108
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,600
Crystal Chronicles was kind of underrated.

1109
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,760
I really loved that game.

1110
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,960
The only problem with it is that, god, you had to have a lot of shit in order to be able

1111
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,480
to play that game, including four people.

1112
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,920
Four Game Boy Advances and four Link Kables and everything.

1113
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:17,920
Yeah, everything.

1114
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,520
Alright, well, if you want a Wii to be playing the Dragon Quest game on, of course we've

1115
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,060
been talking about that they're practically impossible to find, but one thing to keep

1116
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:30,440
in mind is that the Nintendo World Store in New York City and Rockefeller Center, they

1117
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,120
get more shipments of the Wii every morning.

1118
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:38,200
Apparently a reporter from Game Daily visited the store recently and observed that there

1119
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:44,000
were 20 Wiis lined up behind the main counter just waiting for whoever's in line, but what's

1120
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,920
been going on is that more and more recently, WCBS Radio reported not that long ago that

1121
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:54,600
there were over 200 people camped out outside the store before the store even opened, and

1122
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:59,680
some folks are traveling all the way from Virginia to get a freaking Nintendo Wii.

1123
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,160
Oh shit, that's a good way to do it if you know they're going to get some in every day.

1124
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:08,720
Hey, if you don't get it the first day, go see some sites, come back and camp later.

1125
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,720
What about your day job?

1126
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,160
I don't know, is it just me?

1127
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,960
Fuck that, getting a Wii for Billy is more important.

1128
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,880
I digress, but never mind.

1129
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,680
Let's move on with some more gaming news.

1130
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:31,760
Well, more Wii stuff is the game Castle Shigigami 3 will be coming out to Nintendo Wii next

1131
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,320
year.

1132
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,560
It has a lot to do with dodging bullets.

1133
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,440
It's bullet hell.

1134
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,720
Yeah.

1135
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,200
Yay!

1136
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,320
Good for those fans of Ikaruga and stuff like that, of course I think you can get...

1137
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:48,440
It's a very interesting shooter, and also you collect coins while you play.

1138
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:51,560
I wonder how that's going to control the Wii, I wonder if it's going to be like Geometry

1139
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,120
Wars where you point at the screen where you want to shoot, or if it's going to have

1140
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,440
that kind of functionality in it.

1141
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,440
I don't know, it doesn't...

1142
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:00,440
Uh, I think you're probably thinking way too much into it, they'll probably have this...

1143
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,440
No, seriously, seriously.

1144
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:06,000
They'll probably just have the controller turned sideways and playing it like a virtual

1145
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
console game.

1146
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Oh, yeah, I guess that'll work too, huh?

1147
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,120
Yeah, because I mean, a lot of these games don't use the motion controls and stuff like

1148
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,120
that.

1149
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:16,000
It'd be too hard, especially with pinpoint stuff.

1150
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Well that works.

1151
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:23,480
Anyways, so, there's another game coming to the Wii, this is kind of interesting actually.

1152
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:27,920
I laughed when I saw it, because even though there's a game that's just like it that's

1153
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,980
already been announced, we don't know when that's coming out.

1154
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:34,600
This game though, however, is coming out, I want to say in March.

1155
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:39,920
Anyways, the game is called Wild Earth, African Safari.

1156
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,520
Oh great, now the Wii's getting on the Africa craze as well.

1157
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,520
Yes.

1158
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,520
Wonderful.

1159
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:49,700
Wild Earth, Africa, Safari.

1160
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:53,000
Very similar to Africa, and it's...

1161
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,200
How can you say that?

1162
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,880
We don't know anything about Africa.

1163
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:01,240
They are similar in the regards they are both about Africa.

1164
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,600
Africa is a giant fucking place, I don't know if you are aware.

1165
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:10,680
Hey, I will have you know that there's photography in this game, much like Africa.

1166
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:15,120
There are animals just like Africa, they both take place in Africa.

1167
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:19,320
If anything else, I would say this is more authentic, because they spelled Africa correctly.

1168
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,560
Okay, so, whatever.

1169
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:27,160
Anyways, Safari Photo Africa Wild Earth is a PC game, I guess it got released a while

1170
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:32,920
ago and took home some awards in the 2003 Independent Games Festival, including the

1171
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:39,040
coveted Sumas McNally Grand Prize, whatever the fuck that's supposed to mean.

1172
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:44,720
Anyways, this game takes place, you are a photojournalist exploring Africa's Serengeti

1173
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:50,960
National Park, tasked with taking photos of 30 different animals in their natural habitat.

1174
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,880
And apparently if you get close to the animals for the perfect shot, or if you get too close,

1175
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:59,160
the Wii remote will rumble, making it harder to snap the picture.

1176
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:05,760
And the Wii version will include co-op multiplayer, one player to drive, while the other two shoot

1177
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,760
photos.

1178
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:11,600
Unfortunately, we can't run over the animals with the jeep, at least I don't think you

1179
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,600
can.

1180
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,600
Boring.

1181
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,640
The only way I'm going to play any of these games is if I can run over the animals.

1182
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,640
I don't get it.

1183
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,160
Jamie, what the hell's going on here?

1184
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:24,160
We're getting Africa on the Playstation 3, this Safari game on the Wii, yet still no

1185
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,000
Jumbo Safari.

1186
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,440
What the hell is wrong with this world?

1187
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:32,920
Well, you know, we have no Jumbo Safari, but we also have no Planet Harrier.

1188
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,960
Hi!

1189
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:40,620
It's all those games that came out around that time, we have, you know, if Sega would

1190
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:46,400
give us a dedicated platform, a dedicated system, then we would have all this awesome,

1191
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,400
but no!

1192
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,600
OMG, Dreamcast 2.

1193
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,600
I wish!

1194
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,600
Jumbo Safari packet game.

1195
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,840
Well, wasn't Jumbo Safari, like, kind of a gun game almost?

1196
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:54,840
Sort of.

1197
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:55,840
Yeah, it was.

1198
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,840
Well, it's like a harpoon thing.

1199
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:57,840
No, you lassoed him.

1200
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,840
It's a harpoon.

1201
01:01:58,840 --> 01:01:59,840
Harpoon.

1202
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:00,840
Har-poo.

1203
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:01,840
Har-poo.

1204
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:05,480
Frisbee calls it Pokemon Snafrica.

1205
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,360
There you go.

1206
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:11,800
The only bad thing about this thing, and, you know, no offense to Majesco, but Majesco's

1207
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:16,680
putting it out, and, I mean, seriously, what was the last good game for Majesco to come

1208
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,680
out?

1209
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:23,000
I'll give you a hint, there's one game that they put out in the Wii that I remember, and

1210
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,760
that was at, oh, fuck, what was it called?

1211
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,640
Bust a Move Bash or whatever, you know, it was a puzzle game, you can't really innovate

1212
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:36,800
that much, but let me put it this way, the screenshots don't show much detail.

1213
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,320
But there's a dead wildebeest.

1214
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:42,360
I want to know why I can't run these things over with my car.

1215
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:45,360
I'm going to be able to do that in Far Cry 2, so that's, at least I have that to look

1216
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,360
forward to.

1217
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:49,760
Alright, well, earlier in the show we were talking about GameStop and one of their latest

1218
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,760
adventures with Nintendo.

1219
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:55,220
Well, that's not the only adventure GameStop has announced that they're going on this week.

1220
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:59,560
They are going to start creating tournament centers.

1221
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:04,360
What this is, is it's something that's in addition to a standard retail store, and the

1222
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:09,040
kiosks where you play the games on, instead of there just being one, there's a ton of

1223
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,040
them.

1224
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:13,440
Now, they're opening one of these in San Jose, and gosh, part of me kind of wants to go down

1225
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,040
and check it out, maybe do a report for the show because it's not that far, and I go there

1226
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,040
a lot.

1227
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:21,880
But anyhow, apparently these places are going to have 24 networked gaming stations.

1228
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:25,540
They're all going to have plasma display on it, and they're supposed to be doing various

1229
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,980
competitions in these places.

1230
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:30,580
Most weekends are when they're supposed to be doing it.

1231
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:33,260
They're going to kick it off with a Madden tournament.

1232
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:38,640
And the winner of the Madden tournament gets a $1,000 GameStop shopping spree, which they

1233
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,640
could spend right there in the store.

1234
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:44,820
I can't see how this is going to make them any money.

1235
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:49,840
Is this like their idea of countering a LAN center, and that way of putting it on them?

1236
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:54,140
Well, here's the thing, I don't know if they're going to be countering LAN centers, but one

1237
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:59,560
of their competition chains that's kind of up and coming, they're starting to do this

1238
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:03,360
play-and-trade is really, I think they're starting to take notes of that, and their

1239
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:07,040
big thing is that they run tournaments, and they organize them nationwide and stuff like

1240
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:10,340
that, and they run tournaments in the store a lot.

1241
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:11,800
So they may be trying to compete with that.

1242
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:16,440
But here's the thing, I don't understand how they're going to make any money from this.

1243
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:21,560
I mean, really, I just, I don't know.

1244
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:24,920
I mean, they're going to have all these TVs set up, unless they're charging people to

1245
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,720
play on this stuff, like running out time.

1246
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,600
Well, I imagine they have to be.

1247
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:34,740
You pay a $20, $30 entry fee, and if you get 50 people to enter it, there's a $1,000 prize

1248
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:36,880
right there, and anything additional is just extra money.

1249
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,360
And with a game like Madden that's so competitive, I don't know.

1250
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:45,400
It's going to be tough, though, because I know those other places, they don't charge

1251
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,400
for tournaments and stuff.

1252
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,000
Okay, plus, you get all those gamers in one place, and then what are you going to do?

1253
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,200
You're going to put out a table full of Madden merchandise out there for them to buy, right?

1254
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:58,600
Like, I can think of DDR tournaments I went to where Red Octane would come in and they

1255
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:02,040
would have a table, because this was back before Red Octane was big for Guitar Hero.

1256
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:06,820
They would come and they would sell dance pads and soundtracks and all the DDR crap

1257
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:11,440
there at the tournament, and that's how they made money.

1258
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,760
It's really a good idea, I mean, honestly.

1259
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:15,760
But I don't know.

1260
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,920
It's like selling t-shirts at a concert.

1261
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,920
Yeah, I suppose.

1262
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:24,240
Also, GS68, they've seen one at the Santa Más at the Stevens Creek GameStop.

1263
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:28,920
I've shopped there before, by the way, that's actually right next to my Grand Princess.

1264
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:33,760
But I don't know.

1265
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,360
The only reason why is I know a lot of people that own land centers, and they own places

1266
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:42,160
like this where they rent out time, and hell, we knew, was it Rina, they used to have something

1267
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,200
similar like this.

1268
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:47,840
It's very hard to make money from them, and I know it may be tied in with GameStop, and

1269
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:51,560
you run any tournaments and stuff, but I don't think it's going to work out for them.

1270
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,400
I really don't think that they're going to make enough money to make it worth their wild,

1271
01:05:54,400 --> 01:06:01,480
so I mean, they're testing it, but we'll just see if it actually ends up working out for

1272
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:02,480
them.

1273
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,480
I don't think it will be.

1274
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,480
We'll see.

1275
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,480
We'll see.

1276
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,080
All right, well, let's move on with some more gaming news.

1277
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,600
If we have any listeners in San Jose that have happened to check this place out, let

1278
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,600
us know.

1279
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,240
If not, I'll try to make it a point to go by there in the near future.

1280
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:14,240
We'll see.

1281
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:19,200
There are some details released about Tomb Raider Underworld that's being developed by

1282
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,600
Crystal Dynamics.

1283
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:33,040
It should be out next year on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC, and is going to be...

1284
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:41,120
They were actually quoted in Play Magazine as saying it was pure woman versus wild.

1285
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:48,040
I'm really, I don't know, because I think there's way too many Tomb Raider games already,

1286
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:52,680
but I did think, though, that it is pretty cool that they have a new lighting model for

1287
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:55,560
what will be going on in the game.

1288
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:58,800
I think it's pretty cool that they're...

1289
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:04,420
I like the more technical side of it, so I would check it out just to at least look at

1290
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:07,320
something online to see how it turns out.

1291
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:12,680
Well, Tomb Raider is one of those series that just won't die, and this is for us to approve

1292
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:15,360
it.

1293
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,360
Here's another series.

1294
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:21,280
Well, I don't know if it's going to be a series, but maybe a game that should die.

1295
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:25,080
The Prince's Bride game, which doesn't look all that wonderful.

1296
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:29,920
I mean, it looks like, to be honest, like a CDI game.

1297
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:36,840
Anyways, according to a new G4 interview, they've gotten some information direct from

1298
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,600
the developer's mouths.

1299
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:46,640
Apparently, well, the game itself, the target demographic, I believe, was women for it.

1300
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:50,000
They said that they're not going to be using a lot of the voice actors.

1301
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,560
It's actually going to be sound-alikes for the voices.

1302
01:07:53,560 --> 01:08:03,360
And of course, they're saying that the game's going to be out spring of 2008 on PC.

1303
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:06,960
And if you like, you can pre-order it at the official site, princessbridegame.com.

1304
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,720
Oh, the game doesn't look that good.

1305
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,720
I looked at that picture.

1306
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,760
It does look like a CDI game.

1307
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:19,160
I mean, they'd have to use sound-alikes anyway, at least for some of them, because, you know,

1308
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,800
Andre the Giant's dead.

1309
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,720
So you should make him talk anyways.

1310
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:30,200
Splice clips together, like that one show after Chef left the show, right?

1311
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,200
Never mind.

1312
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:37,800
Anyhow, we're going to debut a brand new segment on tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1313
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:41,880
And I can't say this is necessarily going to be a weekly segment, but it is going to

1314
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:46,600
be a segment that we're going to do on the show whenever something makes us feel like

1315
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,560
we need to do this segment.

1316
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:49,780
It's not a new game.

1317
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:53,960
It's not a new advice column or anything like that.

1318
01:08:53,960 --> 01:09:02,680
So, it is something we call here at Orange Lounge Radio the Stupid Award.

1319
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:03,680
That's right.

1320
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:07,580
Whenever we here at Orange Lounge Radio feel like somebody has done something extraordinarily

1321
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:15,920
stupid this week in the gaming industry, we're going to award them with the OLR Stupid Award.

1322
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:21,080
So this week, the Stupid Award goes to this kid, and I'm probably going to mispronounce

1323
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,080
his name, but that's okay.

1324
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,080
He's stupid.

1325
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,440
He's going to be playing Aliyu Shaw.

1326
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,440
And what did he do?

1327
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:33,560
Well, he went on to Xbox Live and he was playing Call of Duty 4, and he sent messages to kids

1328
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:34,560
on Xbox Live.

1329
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,880
He was playing Call of Duty 4, and he told them that he was going to shoot up his school

1330
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,560
and tell everybody on there how he was going to do it.

1331
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:47,120
Well, sure enough, a Call of Duty 4 player from Oregon went to the police department

1332
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:53,680
and Microsoft ended up letting out the IP who tracked down this guy and arrested him.

1333
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:58,040
Now, the kid later admitted that the whole thing was just a joke, he had no intention

1334
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:03,840
of actually going through with it, there were no guns to be found or whatever, but still,

1335
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:09,080
why would you say this kind of crap on Xbox Live, especially in this day and age in the

1336
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,080
world we live in.

1337
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:17,760
So, congratulations, Aliyu Shaw, winner of the inaugural OLR Stupid Award!

1338
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,760
Yay!

1339
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:25,600
That's right, out of the gene pool.

1340
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,600
Get out.

1341
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,360
Let's get a little bleach in there.

1342
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:34,880
All right, let's move on to a segment that we've done for a while now and it's a well-loved

1343
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,440
segment here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1344
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:43,160
It is the Classic Game of the Week and every week DarkSakura picks a favorite classic game

1345
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:48,040
of hers and we basically pay tribute to our elders and respect them a little bit through

1346
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:53,000
our Classic Game of the Week, so DarkSakura, tell us about what game you picked out for

1347
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
us this week.

1348
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:02,160
The Game of the Week is the X-Men arcade game, the old one you could find either one screen

1349
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:09,520
or two screens, I do believe that the differences were a four-player and a six-player.

1350
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:14,440
I played the hell out of this game when I was in tenth grade.

1351
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:20,120
My arcade actually had a two-screen set-up, so I used to play a whole crap-let of this,

1352
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:28,080
but it was put out by Konami and it's the final fight-style game, you know, the side-scrolling

1353
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:32,560
beat-crap-up game, you know, or like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games, even though a lot

1354
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,400
of these were floating around that time.

1355
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:39,720
But you could play as Cyclops, Colossus, Wolverine, Storm, Nightcrawler, or Gavlar, and I actually

1356
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:42,680
use Gavlar almost all the time.

1357
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:46,320
And you beat up the world's shortest sentinels, because they were really supposed to be massive,

1358
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,920
but they were like, little.

1359
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:55,840
And it had the most, I swear, this would have all been candidates for everse.com, the things

1360
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,160
that they would say in the game.

1361
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:06,600
Now, I didn't realize this for quite a while, but the version that I played at one of the,

1362
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:11,440
not my main arcade, but the second arcade, was actually a Japanese version, because they

1363
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:17,280
would drop extra power-ups that would refuel the power meter, and apparently the American

1364
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,760
ones did not.

1365
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,960
So I was like, this is hard!

1366
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,080
It was too easy.

1367
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:29,000
So it was full of crap.

1368
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:36,080
I mean, it was a really fun game, and I wish that there had been, you know, a home release

1369
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:41,400
without me having to bust out the maze, but it was a lot of fun.

1370
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,400
Alright, well, some comments from Chatroom.

1371
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:48,560
Tigerclaw wants to remind us, this was also the only X-Men game released by Konami, hence

1372
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,880
why it feels so much like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

1373
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:55,200
That's why I was saying that it was in that type.

1374
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:58,080
Now, ActDeft sounds like he has the best arcade ever.

1375
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:02,240
He says, my arcade used to have this, TMNT Arcade, and Turtles in Time.

1376
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:08,280
Turtles in Time was freaking great, but this was my game before Turtles in Time.

1377
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:12,280
However, Dillinger would like to share that the Simpsons arcade game was better.

1378
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:13,480
I doubt that.

1379
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,920
Simpsons did it.

1380
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:17,560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1381
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:20,960
I actually really liked this one a whole lot better.

1382
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:25,240
Alright, so there it is, your classic game of the week, X-Men, as done by the arcade,

1383
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:28,080
and I'm just pausing our little YouTubage of the game here.

1384
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,940
Bonus, you are granted a special mutant power.

1385
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:35,980
Note that mutant power can be used only when the energy indicator is at three or less.

1386
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:37,680
Is that like now a second mutation?

1387
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:38,680
I don't know.

1388
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,400
For anyone who reads the comics.

1389
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,400
I don't know.

1390
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,800
Anyhow, that's going to bring this part A of our program to a close.

1391
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:48,920
We're going to take a quick break and we will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

1392
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:49,920
right after this.

1393
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:54,880
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

1394
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:55,880
a week.

1395
01:13:55,880 --> 01:14:19,320
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
