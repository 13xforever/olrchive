00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:25,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, December 16th, 2007, internet radio hits the PSP in one part of the world, Mass Effect and Assassin's Creed boast big sales, and how would you feel about a wee rain check under the tree this Christmas?

2
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:35,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:35,628 --> 00:00:41,449
[SPEAKER_05]: We are that program on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:42,589
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:46,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:47,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Yo.

7
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,250
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing, Ms.

8
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:48,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Summers?

9
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:51,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Long day?

10
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Long weekend?

11
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:53,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

12
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:55,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking about it still.

13
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm making a decision.

14
00:00:57,351 --> 00:00:57,611
[SPEAKER_05]: A decision?

15
00:00:57,631 --> 00:01:00,132
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can't do it without being fully informed.

16
00:01:02,235 --> 00:01:04,236
[SPEAKER_05]: You should always be fully informed when making a decision

17
00:01:31,578 --> 00:01:32,258
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing, Loki?

18
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm okay, I guess.

19
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:34,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I guess.

20
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Feeling a little ripped off.

21
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:37,921
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened?

22
00:01:39,202 --> 00:01:47,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, just a company I've been buying stuff for my new computer with, EVGA, and I bought my motherboard and my graphics card from them.

23
00:01:48,686 --> 00:01:56,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally the day after I bought my graphics card, NVIDIA went and redesigned it, made it cheaper, faster, and better.

24
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,271
[SPEAKER_04]: So that sucks.

25
00:01:58,851 --> 00:02:00,972
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the motherboard that I bought

26
00:02:02,139 --> 00:02:06,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't tell what's wrong since there's no beeps nor indication of what's wrong.

27
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,804
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm looking at the motherboard that they sell on EVGA's site and there's stuff missing off mine.

28
00:02:34,805 --> 00:02:41,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know, a PCI Express slot that's supposed to be there that's not and some other shit.

29
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,092
[SPEAKER_04]: So, they're going to get an angry call tomorrow.

30
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:45,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to hear that.

31
00:02:45,883 --> 00:02:48,204
[SPEAKER_05]: And now you just talked smack about them on your internet show.

32
00:02:48,264 --> 00:02:49,224
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's just lovely.

33
00:02:49,244 --> 00:02:51,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're feeling hurt.

34
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:56,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Our always present fourth guest here on the program, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, our chat room.

35
00:02:56,086 --> 00:02:57,627
[SPEAKER_05]: We always tape live on Sunday nights.

36
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:01,368
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there's a lot of folks that listen to us in our taped form on the podcast.

37
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:06,209
[SPEAKER_05]: But, of course, listening live is a whole other element where you get to do interactivity.

38
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Question from AZHP.

39
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Which graphics card was it?

40
00:03:11,071 --> 00:03:11,491
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an 8800 GTS.

41
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:14,027
[SPEAKER_05]: That means nothing to me.

42
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:15,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea what that's about.

43
00:03:15,068 --> 00:03:15,788
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an NVIDIA card.

44
00:03:15,808 --> 00:03:22,694
[SPEAKER_04]: They redesigned the GT, which made it a little bit faster using the 65 nanometer chips.

45
00:03:22,874 --> 00:03:26,637
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they did the same thing with the 8800 GTSs.

46
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,039
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for example, I paid for my card.

47
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,401
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like...

48
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:32,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

49
00:03:32,862 --> 00:03:34,123
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was about $364.99.

50
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:35,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

51
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:40,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, that's quite a bit for a card.

52
00:03:40,484 --> 00:03:44,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the best part, though, because, see, now I can get an even faster card.

53
00:03:44,105 --> 00:03:48,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to save for about $100 cheaper, which is annoying.

54
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:56,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it'll have slightly less graphics memory because I had 640 megs of RAM on there.

55
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:58,110
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's see here.

56
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,410
[SPEAKER_04]: The one now, the GTS...

57
00:04:01,387 --> 00:04:04,430
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be 512 megs of RAM.

58
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, it's not that cheaper, I guess.

59
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:09,335
[SPEAKER_04]: It's $359.99, but still.

60
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,699
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit cheaper, and it's even faster.

61
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,383
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, geez, suddenly we're turning into the PC graphics card podcast.

62
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:20,407
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's all right, because I know there's a lot of PC gamers who are really into this graphics card.

63
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,350
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, I just need something to play WoW on, but you all know about that addiction.

64
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what I really want to ask about, though.

65
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:27,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed you brought one of your Xboxes with you tonight.

66
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:30,032
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if this is when you wanted to bring this up or not, but I'm bringing it up.

67
00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:31,992
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to show the Op11 people.

68
00:04:32,092 --> 00:04:34,493
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this isn't great for the podcast, but we can kind of talk about this.

69
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:39,215
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got your Xbox modded, and I don't mean like the piracy mods or whatever.

70
00:04:39,335 --> 00:04:40,275
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's the other one.

71
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:44,816
[SPEAKER_05]: You have like a glass thing on your Xbox that's really cool.

72
00:04:45,276 --> 00:04:45,696
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this?

73
00:04:45,716 --> 00:04:46,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did you buy this?

74
00:04:46,397 --> 00:04:47,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did you do this?

75
00:04:47,397 --> 00:04:49,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we show this to the Op11 people?

76
00:04:49,377 --> 00:04:51,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to plug it in for it to look good.

77
00:04:51,678 --> 00:04:52,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, is it not plugged in?

78
00:04:52,598 --> 00:04:53,519
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not plugged in right now.

79
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:53,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

80
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:55,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember you said not to plug to me.

81
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

82
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,581
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

83
00:04:57,661 --> 00:04:58,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I can plug it in real quick.

84
00:04:58,902 --> 00:04:59,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, do it real quick.

85
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:00,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it real quick.

86
00:05:00,442 --> 00:05:03,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully we don't blow a circuit and the show comes to a screeching halt.

87
00:05:03,924 --> 00:05:05,625
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we suddenly go off air, you know what happened.

88
00:05:05,665 --> 00:05:08,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, if it explodes, it'll hit you guys first.

89
00:05:08,886 --> 00:05:09,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

90
00:05:09,427 --> 00:05:11,208
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Jamie, maybe duck a little bit.

91
00:05:12,108 --> 00:05:15,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Have Pyramid Head protect you with his blade while we do this.

92
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,951
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully the folks on cam can see this.

93
00:05:19,342 --> 00:05:21,844
[SPEAKER_03]: It's protected by the power of awesome.

94
00:05:21,924 --> 00:05:25,667
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the archives in Op 11 are working again, so you might be able to see this in the archives in Op 11.

95
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:30,751
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, you turn it on, and it glows blue inside, which I think is all kinds of awesome.

96
00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:34,473
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like how a lot of people have modded their PC cases to do.

97
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:35,894
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty rad.

98
00:05:37,496 --> 00:05:39,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I guess the folks in chat have seen enough of that.

99
00:05:41,118 --> 00:05:42,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did you do that?

100
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it just for the challenge, or what was it?

101
00:05:46,182 --> 00:05:47,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's not near a microphone.

102
00:05:49,096 --> 00:05:49,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent live radio.

103
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,301
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand you.

104
00:05:57,202 --> 00:06:01,366
[SPEAKER_05]: So why exactly did you decide to mod this and make it blue in there?

105
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:02,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's cool.

106
00:06:04,148 --> 00:06:06,169
[SPEAKER_05]: You just wanted something the other kids didn't have, right?

107
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:08,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

108
00:06:10,193 --> 00:06:12,374
[SPEAKER_04]: I did it to, well, three of them so far.

109
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have one more that I haven't done yet because they're a bitch.

110
00:06:16,017 --> 00:06:18,319
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest though, it may look cool, but it sucks.

111
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is that?

112
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:28,544
[SPEAKER_04]: The brand of clear case I bought, which I think it was like a ghost case or something like that, they suck.

113
00:06:29,124 --> 00:06:30,184
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't fit right.

114
00:06:31,165 --> 00:06:35,246
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for example, you'll notice that one has still the old faceplate on it.

115
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:37,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's a clear faceplate for it.

116
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:39,168
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is it jams the DVD drive.

117
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Tigerclaw has a very good point in our chatroom.

118
00:06:42,989 --> 00:06:46,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Modding the 360 may be cool, but it also voids the warranty.

119
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,571
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you just, you know,

120
00:06:47,998 --> 00:06:49,859
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't care about the warranty, you'll just take your chances?

121
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just like I did the other one.

122
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,741
[SPEAKER_04]: That one was modded in the other way.

123
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:54,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

124
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:56,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well we'll get into that a little later.

125
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go around and check.

126
00:06:58,102 --> 00:07:04,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, we'll have the wonderful Christmas light effect on there since it's got three flashing lights on it.

127
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:07,026
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

128
00:07:07,046 --> 00:07:07,867
[SPEAKER_04]: The red rings of death.

129
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:08,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray!

130
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:09,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations on that.

131
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:17,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go around and ask the question about our gaming weeks because that's how we're supposed to start off the show before we get into ooh and aahing over a blue 360.

132
00:07:18,317 --> 00:07:19,517
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

133
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:22,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a Christmas present last night.

134
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:24,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Portal.

135
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:26,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet!

136
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:39,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I totally knew Dan got it for me because I checked our online banking and I saw that he had already told me how much it was used at his store and then I saw that much come out of the bank spent at GameCrazy and then

137
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:43,352
[SPEAKER_03]: That day I felt a game in my stocking.

138
00:07:43,973 --> 00:07:45,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't take it out, but I knew what it was.

139
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:51,196
[SPEAKER_03]: And so last night I went in there and was just playing around with him.

140
00:07:51,376 --> 00:07:54,617
[SPEAKER_03]: And his friend Will was visiting.

141
00:07:54,737 --> 00:08:00,400
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dan said, oh, and by the way, and took it out of my stocking.

142
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,860
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, hey, cool.

143
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they were taunting me with it.

144
00:08:03,661 --> 00:08:04,521
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I got it back.

145
00:08:04,561 --> 00:08:08,623
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Dan was going to play like a level.

146
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,844
[SPEAKER_03]: He ended up playing up to the Weighted Companion Cube level.

147
00:08:14,524 --> 00:08:14,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

148
00:08:15,345 --> 00:08:15,946
[SPEAKER_03]: It's addicting.

149
00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:16,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

150
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,509
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was pretty funny.

151
00:08:19,609 --> 00:08:20,930
[SPEAKER_03]: He was very silly.

152
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:29,477
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I played World Cup Soccer Pinball last night because I hadn't played any pinball in a week.

153
00:08:30,558 --> 00:08:31,659
[SPEAKER_03]: And lots of Ragnarok.

154
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:34,502
[SPEAKER_03]: And a little Elendon.

155
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:36,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

156
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:47,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I gotta ask you though, since you put on your investigative hat to find out that your husband had bought you the orange box for Christmas, were you the type of child that looked under the bed for what mom got you for Christmas, or what?

157
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:56,551
[SPEAKER_03]: No, first of all, mom kept everything in the closet, and then second of all, the only reason... I like how you know, you have to correct me.

158
00:08:56,872 --> 00:08:59,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, no, if I wanted to look at the presents, I went to the closet.

159
00:08:59,893 --> 00:09:02,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's because that's where she kept them because my mom is not creative.

160
00:09:03,696 --> 00:09:09,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I happened to be checking the online banking to see if my bonus got in.

161
00:09:10,238 --> 00:09:11,478
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I was looking.

162
00:09:11,558 --> 00:09:15,139
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I saw 40-something dollars spent at GameCrazy.

163
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:20,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, oh, gee, who's been the one talking about wanting Orange Box for Christmas?

164
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,400
[SPEAKER_03]: And there it was.

165
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:26,321
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's when I got my investigative hat on when the clue presented itself.

166
00:09:27,822 --> 00:09:28,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.

167
00:09:28,826 --> 00:09:31,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I ever tell you the story about when I got my Super Nintendo when I was 12?

168
00:09:31,828 --> 00:09:33,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I've told the story on this program.

169
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:34,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I might have been 11.

170
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:34,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

171
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:39,912
[SPEAKER_05]: But I asked for that for Christmas, and that's all I really wanted was a Super Nintendo, right?

172
00:09:40,273 --> 00:09:48,758
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we opened up all the presents under the tree, and I saved the big, big present for last because I kind of guessed that maybe it was the Super Nintendo I wanted for Christmas, right?

173
00:09:49,218 --> 00:09:52,940
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I opened the very last present, and it's a San Francisco Giants jacket.

174
00:09:53,915 --> 00:09:56,136
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you know me, you know I love sports.

175
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:57,936
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like crushed.

176
00:09:58,076 --> 00:09:59,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like about ready to cry.

177
00:09:59,637 --> 00:10:01,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't want to cry because I didn't want to look like a baby.

178
00:10:01,657 --> 00:10:05,038
[SPEAKER_05]: But inside the gamer nerd in me is like wanting to cry and sob and throw things.

179
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:06,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Be the spoiled brat I am, right?

180
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:15,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then finally after everybody opens their presents, my sister comes to me with one tiny, tiny, tiny little gift and says there's one more thing.

181
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:19,322
[SPEAKER_05]: And on it was written on an index card a hint.

182
00:10:19,841 --> 00:10:19,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Drakken

183
00:10:41,852 --> 00:10:43,773
[SPEAKER_05]: which I don't think anybody ever played.

184
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:44,954
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard of it.

185
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:47,316
[SPEAKER_05]: It was based on an old PC game, and it wasn't bad.

186
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:51,899
[SPEAKER_05]: The sequel to it, which I believe was called Dungeon View, Drakken 2, was awesome.

187
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:56,742
[SPEAKER_05]: But the first one was a little meh, because it was a role-playing game where you didn't really control your characters at all.

188
00:10:56,922 --> 00:11:00,525
[SPEAKER_05]: You just kind of hoped they would beat the monster in their own way.

189
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:01,366
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really odd.

190
00:11:01,386 --> 00:11:03,007
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of neat, I guess, in its own way.

191
00:11:03,447 --> 00:11:07,610
[SPEAKER_05]: But the reason why they bought that, because the guy at Sears told them it was a big seller.

192
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:08,901
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, okay.

193
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:09,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Liar!

194
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:13,028
[SPEAKER_05]: To this day, nobody fucking knows Drakken.

195
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:17,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when we bought a PC from Sears a long time ago.

196
00:11:18,116 --> 00:11:19,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Or thinking about it.

197
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:19,458
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

198
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,001
[SPEAKER_04]: That was crap.

199
00:11:21,762 --> 00:11:22,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Never buy PCs from them.

200
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:25,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at comments from chat.

201
00:11:25,577 --> 00:11:26,057
[SPEAKER_05]: This is good.

202
00:11:26,697 --> 00:11:28,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiger Claw says, Drakken was a 3D RPG.

203
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:31,378
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not the only one that knows what Drakken is.

204
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:33,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there's other listeners that go, I remember that game.

205
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:39,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Amaze Satsuma, I like this, says, When I was younger, I wasn't only the type to hunt for my Christmas.

206
00:11:39,401 --> 00:11:44,042
[SPEAKER_05]: I also opened the game boxes and replaced the game inside with the game I already own.

207
00:11:45,783 --> 00:11:46,703
[SPEAKER_05]: That's messed up.

208
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:49,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, another year.

209
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:57,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I, uh, I, my mom went to Target and got all this stuff, and I was, like, looking in the bags when she came back from Target.

210
00:11:57,657 --> 00:12:01,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Not, like, intentionally, I wasn't really hunting around for Christmas presents, I was actually looking for candy.

211
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:03,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I wanted to see if she bought candy, because I wanted candy.

212
00:12:03,996 --> 00:12:09,459
[SPEAKER_05]: and I freaking saw a copy of Fester's Quest on the NES in one of the bags and I was like, oh crap.

213
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:20,325
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I decided to screw with my mom later because we went to the video store and I wanted to rent a game so I grabbed the box for Fester's Quest and I'm like, let me rent this game, let me rent this game and my mom's like, no, you don't need to rent a game tonight.

214
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:23,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm such a bastard.

215
00:12:23,386 --> 00:12:25,227
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Loki, how was your game week?

216
00:12:26,308 --> 00:12:27,488
[SPEAKER_04]: It was okay.

217
00:12:27,989 --> 00:12:32,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, I played Saints Row again, more of that and I played

218
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:35,275
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

219
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:04,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the way the crashes look.

220
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

221
00:13:07,672 --> 00:13:14,917
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little hard to see where the shortcuts and stuff are in the game, but I guess that's why you gotta drive around more and stuff.

222
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,799
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll probably pick it up when it comes out in January.

223
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:25,004
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, let's see, other than that, I think a little bit more Zelda Phantom Hourglass.

224
00:13:25,024 --> 00:13:26,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty much done with that game now.

225
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:28,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

226
00:13:29,315 --> 00:13:30,416
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

227
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:49,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

228
00:13:50,316 --> 00:13:53,178
[SPEAKER_05]: You really can save pictures to the Wii message board.

229
00:13:53,238 --> 00:13:55,199
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of took me a little bit to figure out how to do it.

230
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:58,261
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically, if you have Pokemon Snap, you take the pictures.

231
00:13:58,281 --> 00:14:02,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, by the way, Pokemon Snap doesn't control quite as nice as I remember it.

232
00:14:02,184 --> 00:14:03,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, the controls are kind of shitty.

233
00:14:03,825 --> 00:14:04,745
[SPEAKER_05]: But the game itself is fun.

234
00:14:05,086 --> 00:14:06,907
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you take the pictures of the Pokemon, right?

235
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:09,548
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can save your favorites to this gallery.

236
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:15,993
[SPEAKER_05]: If you back out all the way to the main menu and then go into gallery, you can look at the pictures you took.

237
00:14:16,073 --> 00:14:17,414
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Nintendo 64, kind of like...

238
00:14:18,394 --> 00:14:23,839
[SPEAKER_05]: up-rezes them from when you took them in-game to, I guess, the highest quality picture that Nintendo 64 could render.

239
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:32,886
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're in that mode, you hit the minus key on your classic controller, and that is what will post your picture to the Wii message board.

240
00:14:33,146 --> 00:14:34,567
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can only post one a day.

241
00:14:34,948 --> 00:14:36,469
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can send the pictures.

242
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:41,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I took a picture, and I didn't know who to send it to, so I sent it to Bobby Blackwolf because I thought he'd get a kick out of it.

243
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:43,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

244
00:15:07,752 --> 00:15:10,294
[SPEAKER_05]: VX, JasonXVR, Webmaster wants me to send the picture to him.

245
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:11,315
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will do that a little later.

246
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:11,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

247
00:15:12,576 --> 00:15:14,517
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's doing the Check Me Out channel.

248
00:15:14,938 --> 00:15:16,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other stuff I've looked at.

249
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:19,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually looked at this last week, but I forgot to mention it on the show.

250
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:22,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox 360, a little demo came out for a game called Cold Step Saga.

251
00:15:23,644 --> 00:15:30,969
[SPEAKER_05]: And the thing about Cold Step is it was kind of like a cult game, if you will, on the PlayStation 2, where not a lot of people had heard of it or played it.

252
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:32,810
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a great game.

253
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Cold Step on the PlayStation 2.

254
00:15:35,111 --> 00:15:41,355
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you've read any reviews about this game, it's probably... Most of the reviews on it are pretty accurate.

255
00:15:41,415 --> 00:15:42,576
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Monopoly meets...

256
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:48,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Magic the Gathering, where you're moving around this board and you're trying to collect the most magical points.

257
00:15:48,658 --> 00:15:50,938
[SPEAKER_05]: And you do that by laying these monsters down.

258
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:57,760
[SPEAKER_05]: And when opponents land on the square where you've put down a monster, they can either challenge the monster with one of their own monsters or pay a toll.

259
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, you're paying boardwalk, so they have to pay with some of their magic.

260
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,482
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's basically the gist of the game.

261
00:16:03,622 --> 00:16:06,142
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it translated the 360 pretty nicely.

262
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:07,843
[SPEAKER_05]: The only downside...

263
00:16:08,803 --> 00:16:16,905
[SPEAKER_05]: is that in playing, you know, obviously it's only the demo, I'm basing my assumptions off the demo, but the demo appeared to be one of the exact same boards from the PlayStation 2 version, I think the very first board.

264
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:24,788
[SPEAKER_05]: And it does look like there's some more cards and things, but really it looks like all they've done on the 360 is made it widescreen and up-res'd everything to 720p.

265
00:16:25,808 --> 00:16:26,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

266
00:16:48,362 --> 00:16:49,083
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

267
00:17:10,808 --> 00:17:13,329
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not for somebody who likes a fast, action-paced game.

268
00:17:13,629 --> 00:17:21,751
[SPEAKER_05]: But if something like Puzzle Quest is more up your alley or something you think before you make your moves and stuff like that, it's fun.

269
00:17:21,811 --> 00:17:23,172
[SPEAKER_05]: It's certainly not fast-paced.

270
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:25,753
[SPEAKER_04]: There you have it.

271
00:17:25,813 --> 00:17:35,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of card games, I just wanted to mention, I vaguely remember the amount because it wasn't that much, but a little update to the Eye of Judgment sales in the U.S.

272
00:17:35,796 --> 00:17:36,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, lordy.

273
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:44,262
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we sold yet another 17,000 units last month, so we're up to a whopping 32,000-ish around there.

274
00:17:44,562 --> 00:17:50,487
[SPEAKER_05]: So 32,000 Eye of Judgment units sold, and the goal is, again, 1 million for Loki to wear the Tingle suit here on the program.

275
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck with that.

276
00:17:51,147 --> 00:17:53,229
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think he'll sell 1 million, period.

277
00:17:54,629 --> 00:17:55,190
[SPEAKER_05]: One other quick...

278
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:56,714
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

279
00:18:25,823 --> 00:18:26,143
[SPEAKER_05]: and Harvey.

280
00:18:56,091 --> 00:18:56,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's Harvey?

281
00:18:57,111 --> 00:18:58,232
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the giant rabbit.

282
00:18:58,372 --> 00:18:59,092
[SPEAKER_05]: The giant rabbit?

283
00:18:59,152 --> 00:19:03,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have Pikachu and Kirby behind us and Cartman.

284
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:05,774
[SPEAKER_04]: And the clear it up in chat room.

285
00:19:05,814 --> 00:19:08,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the 32,000 was domestic sales.

286
00:19:08,675 --> 00:19:10,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea what it's selling worldwide.

287
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:13,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I can guarantee, though, it's not anything over 100,000 units already.

288
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:18,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fairly confident that it's never going to sell a million units.

289
00:19:20,218 --> 00:19:23,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Rossdale UT in chat says, Kind of like Diablo equals kind of repetitive.

290
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:24,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I right?

291
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:25,769
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

292
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:31,553
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't get that same feeling from Diablo, but I think a lot of the strength that Diablo had was the multiplayer mode.

293
00:19:31,853 --> 00:19:38,538
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be fair, I didn't get to try that mode out on this demo yet, so maybe that's where this game shines, is being able to do multiplayer.

294
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:40,439
[SPEAKER_05]: That might make the game a hell of a lot more fun.

295
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,060
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why I put that disclaimer out there.

296
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,322
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm completely basing my judgment of this game off the demo.

297
00:19:44,622 --> 00:19:46,983
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, that's what a lot of Xbox users do.

298
00:19:47,003 --> 00:19:51,626
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're going to put a demo out there, make sure it sells everything the game's got in it, right?

299
00:19:52,006 --> 00:19:52,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I right?

300
00:19:52,647 --> 00:19:52,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

301
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:54,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

302
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,480
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll still happen, okay?

303
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:08,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, okay.

304
00:20:08,561 --> 00:20:13,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's given a little on the bet and says if the game can ever sell a million, a million worldwide even?

305
00:20:13,122 --> 00:20:14,463
[SPEAKER_05]: A million worldwide.

306
00:20:14,483 --> 00:20:15,103
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, nice.

307
00:20:15,183 --> 00:20:20,145
[SPEAKER_05]: If the game can sell a million worldwide ever, then Loki will wear the Tingle suit.

308
00:20:20,205 --> 00:20:22,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch one of our listeners win the lottery and buy 900,000 of them.

309
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:23,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Just watch it.

310
00:20:24,486 --> 00:20:25,946
[SPEAKER_05]: So it might be like three years from now.

311
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:33,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope we're still doing this show three years from now or, you know, that could happen like in 30 years and Loki's, you know, getting old going, what do you mean I gotta wear this suit?

312
00:20:34,508 --> 00:20:36,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

313
00:20:36,954 --> 00:20:37,735
[SPEAKER_05]: I have Judgment.

314
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:38,818
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember that game.

315
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:40,121
[SPEAKER_05]: The fuck?

316
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:41,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

317
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:47,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into some housekeeping tonight before we start tonight's news of the gaming type.

318
00:20:48,188 --> 00:20:49,568
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no show next week.

319
00:20:49,588 --> 00:20:50,449
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to be here next week.

320
00:20:50,469 --> 00:20:57,391
[SPEAKER_05]: We're taking December 23rd off for the holidays because DarkSakura, myself, and Loki all have family and friends stuff to attend to.

321
00:20:57,711 --> 00:20:59,452
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're not going to be here on December 23rd.

322
00:20:59,512 --> 00:21:08,775
[SPEAKER_05]: However, for those of you that listen live, it is my understanding there is a very special OLR Christmas that's going to happen thanks to some of our...

323
00:21:09,295 --> 00:21:10,816
[SPEAKER_05]: and other OLR personalities.

324
00:21:10,856 --> 00:21:11,757
[SPEAKER_05]: So stay tuned for that.

325
00:21:12,158 --> 00:21:18,703
[SPEAKER_05]: That will not hit the podcast feed, but it will go up on our MySpace and our LiveJournal and Facebook and all the fan communities we have.

326
00:21:19,024 --> 00:21:25,369
[SPEAKER_05]: You will still be able to grab a recorded copy of whatever mischief happens on the station next Sunday, which I'm sure is going to be very interesting.

327
00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:29,833
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be back on December 30th for our year-end special and more to come on the website.

328
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,215
[SPEAKER_05]: About that, a little closer to the day.

329
00:21:34,264 --> 00:21:34,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Hero 3

330
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:04,585
[SPEAKER_04]: It's getting a brand new patch to fix a few things and add a couple things.

331
00:22:05,305 --> 00:22:14,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the things that they're fixing, improving the online quick match results and also adding a calibration screen improvements, I guess.

332
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,211
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of cool.

333
00:22:17,051 --> 00:22:22,754
[SPEAKER_04]: And also one of the things that they're adding for like PlayStation 3 users, the co-op quick play mode.

334
00:22:23,935 --> 00:22:28,577
[SPEAKER_04]: So other than that, various other stability improvements and fixes.

335
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,194
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish they'd add some new characters or something.

336
00:22:32,514 --> 00:22:32,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

337
00:22:33,355 --> 00:22:33,655
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

338
00:22:34,476 --> 00:22:37,858
[SPEAKER_04]: But, other than that, there's also going to be a new download pack.

339
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:40,780
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've added two different ones.

340
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,183
[SPEAKER_04]: One of which is from the Warner Reprise track pack, I guess.

341
00:22:46,343 --> 00:22:55,389
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's going to include Pretty Handsome Awkward by The Used, Sleeping Giant by Mastodon, and No More Sorrow by Linkin Park.

342
00:22:56,429 --> 00:22:58,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they have single download packs.

343
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:26,655
[SPEAKER_04]: including some, I guess it's from popular European bands, So Peoso by Extremodoro, and Antisocial by Trust, and Ernton Was We're Saying by Der Fentigen Veer, I don't know, I probably butchered all that stuff, and then I guess a free exclusive rock rendition of a holiday classic, We Three Kings by Steve Oyment.

344
00:23:27,168 --> 00:23:28,049
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's kind of funny, though.

345
00:23:28,329 --> 00:23:31,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have hoped that they would have had more Christmas songs and stuff.

346
00:23:31,051 --> 00:23:33,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, get the London Symphony Orchestra or something like that.

347
00:23:33,553 --> 00:23:34,394
[SPEAKER_04]: There's stuff in there.

348
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:35,255
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

349
00:23:35,315 --> 00:23:36,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the Trans-Siberian Orchestra.

350
00:23:36,756 --> 00:23:38,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Twisted Sister Christmas.

351
00:23:38,858 --> 00:23:39,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that idea.

352
00:23:39,698 --> 00:23:40,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Twisted Sister Christmas.

353
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:45,063
[SPEAKER_03]: A friend of mine's been linking me a lot of the songs on them because someone uploaded them on YouTube.

354
00:23:45,283 --> 00:23:45,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but seriously, though.

355
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Trans-Siberian Orchestra.

356
00:23:48,005 --> 00:23:48,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that would be perfect.

357
00:23:49,026 --> 00:23:50,728
[SPEAKER_04]: You can even do that as a free download pack.

358
00:23:50,788 --> 00:23:51,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I like free.

359
00:23:52,008 --> 00:23:55,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Free is good, especially for Christmas, come on, or the holidays.

360
00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:58,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, we have to say the politically correct term, the holidays.

361
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:09,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Credit to Activision or Harmonix, I'm going to say Activision, for actually giving a free song for Guitar Hero 3.

362
00:24:09,512 --> 00:24:12,352
[SPEAKER_04]: But, hey, the rest of those packs, of course, is going to be $6.25.

363
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:14,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, there you have it.

364
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:23,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, here's why I never wish listeners a happy birthday on the program, because of course now we had someone else pipe up and FootyMonster says, it was my birthday last week too.

365
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday, FootyMonster.

366
00:24:26,628 --> 00:24:31,751
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, just so we don't get any more emails going, it was my birthday, it was my birthday, and all that stuff.

367
00:24:32,272 --> 00:24:39,897
[SPEAKER_05]: If you had a birthday between December 9th and December 15th, which would have been last week, or today, December 16th, happy birthday to you.

368
00:24:40,637 --> 00:24:43,039
[SPEAKER_05]: The rest of you, sit on it and wait for your turn.

369
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:44,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Best to you, if you...

370
00:24:44,895 --> 00:24:46,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy unbirthday to you.

371
00:24:46,876 --> 00:24:47,157
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

372
00:24:48,638 --> 00:24:53,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, there's drama.

373
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:58,044
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's like these two are having some real drama, pillow fights and everything between them.

374
00:24:58,485 --> 00:24:59,525
[SPEAKER_05]: But here it is.

375
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,387
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how, of course, there's the compatibility issues with the guitar.

376
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:10,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what was supposed to happen is that Rock Band was going to get an update on the PlayStation 3 so that the Guitar Hero 3 controller will work with it.

377
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:15,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it didn't happen, and Harmonix took to their forums to explain the reason why.

378
00:25:15,618 --> 00:25:28,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Quote, Two weeks ago, Harmonix created a software patch for the Sony PlayStation 3 version of Rock Band that allowed for guitar compatibility and support for third-party peripherals, including enabling use of Activision's Guitar Hero 3 controller with Rock Band.

379
00:25:29,204 --> 00:25:33,685
[SPEAKER_05]: The compatibility patch was submitted, approved, and has been scheduled for release by Sony on Tuesday, December 4th.

380
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:37,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, Activision objected to the compatibility patch's release.

381
00:25:38,146 --> 00:25:45,248
[SPEAKER_05]: The patch remains with Sony, but we have been told that it will unfortunately not be released due to Activision's continued objection.

382
00:25:45,328 --> 00:25:47,829
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, boo Activision to doing that.

383
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:49,309
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure they have their own reasons.

384
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:50,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Money.

385
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Motivating people to just go out and buy.

386
00:25:54,431 --> 00:25:55,011
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

387
00:25:55,231 --> 00:25:55,551
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

388
00:25:57,076 --> 00:25:57,777
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of too bad.

389
00:26:18,456 --> 00:26:19,356
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your fault that you left.

390
00:26:49,538 --> 00:26:59,509
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying that they willfully deceived the consumer with a statement that it had Dolby ProLogic 2 surround sound instead of mono.

391
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,394
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a universe of difference between Dolby and mono.

392
00:27:05,656 --> 00:27:07,839
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand, but still, lawsuit?

393
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:09,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

394
00:27:10,704 --> 00:27:16,888
[SPEAKER_03]: You know they've promised to put out replacement discs that have the sound issue corrected.

395
00:27:17,989 --> 00:27:19,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Activision's not making any comment, though.

396
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:24,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that they really, it's in their best interest to make a comment at this time.

397
00:27:26,474 --> 00:27:28,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Not while they're going through litigation.

398
00:27:28,195 --> 00:27:30,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not, especially when they're trying to fix things.

399
00:27:30,217 --> 00:27:35,280
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would think if anybody wants to bring the smackdown on Activision, it ought to be Nintendo.

400
00:27:36,215 --> 00:27:38,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the consumer suing them in this whole thing.

401
00:27:38,856 --> 00:27:41,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think the consumer is suing Nintendo.

402
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:43,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're suing Activision.

403
00:27:44,117 --> 00:27:47,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I'm saying if anybody should put the smackdown on Activision, it ought to be Nintendo.

404
00:27:47,998 --> 00:27:53,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Nintendo should go to Activision and go, you gave us a subpar version of the game than what you gave the other systems.

405
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:55,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Naughty, naughty, naughty.

406
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:55,959
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that whole thing.

407
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:58,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't be surprised if they would do something too.

408
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's a subpar version on the Wii.

409
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's true.

410
00:28:02,261 --> 00:28:02,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I disagree.

411
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:03,981
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not as powerful.

412
00:28:04,591 --> 00:28:06,031
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, in terms of graphics.

413
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,092
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have that whole thing as well.

414
00:28:07,112 --> 00:28:11,173
[SPEAKER_04]: No, look at, like, okay, look, for example, Far Cry Instincts on the Wii.

415
00:28:11,313 --> 00:28:12,133
[SPEAKER_04]: It was crap.

416
00:28:12,453 --> 00:28:14,074
[SPEAKER_04]: That two-player deathmatch.

417
00:28:14,254 --> 00:28:14,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo-hoo!

418
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:15,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Two players.

419
00:28:16,275 --> 00:28:18,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, you really pushed yourselves there.

420
00:28:18,755 --> 00:28:21,496
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, some of the other control issues that they have.

421
00:28:21,536 --> 00:28:23,197
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of crappy ports of games.

422
00:28:23,217 --> 00:28:24,477
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at you, Ubisoft.

423
00:28:25,197 --> 00:28:27,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And, I don't know, overall, they just don't care.

424
00:28:28,238 --> 00:28:33,880
[SPEAKER_04]: You see, the problem is also I think a lot of these people are used to putting out crappy games without, you know, quality checking them very...

425
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,510
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

426
00:29:05,393 --> 00:29:06,496
[SPEAKER_04]: At least you'll be able to play it.

427
00:29:07,377 --> 00:29:08,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully you can find a copy.

428
00:29:09,021 --> 00:29:15,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, if you're waiting for the PlayStation 2 version in Canada, well, they haven't really confirmed on when that's coming too.

429
00:29:16,107 --> 00:29:18,569
[SPEAKER_05]: But seriously, why settle for Rock Band on the PlayStation 2?

430
00:29:19,149 --> 00:29:23,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Because with the amount you're going to pay for that, you really ought to just put that down towards another console, right?

431
00:29:23,952 --> 00:29:24,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I right?

432
00:29:24,772 --> 00:29:25,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the thing.

433
00:29:26,093 --> 00:29:37,520
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do buy it on PlayStation 2, at least if you do get a new console later that happens to be PlayStation 3, you can use all the instruments from that on the PlayStation 3 version because they are identical.

434
00:29:38,921 --> 00:29:42,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but then you have to buy a PlayStation 3, and I don't know if everybody wants to do that.

435
00:29:43,384 --> 00:29:43,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Good point.

436
00:29:44,925 --> 00:29:45,225
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

437
00:29:46,294 --> 00:29:51,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anyhow, moving on to other PlayStation 3 games, including one that I know a lot of people are excited about.

438
00:29:51,535 --> 00:29:56,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Metal Gear Solid 4 could be the game that definitely drives sales of the PlayStation 3.

439
00:29:57,137 --> 00:30:02,058
[SPEAKER_05]: And another little perk included in the game to further make people want to buy this.

440
00:30:02,098 --> 00:30:13,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember an earlier story, which I think was blown out of proportion, but nevertheless, it was reported on previously that Metal Gear Solid was supposed to move a million units in its first day in order to recover the cost or whatever.

441
00:30:13,162 --> 00:30:14,002
[SPEAKER_04]: It would need to, yeah.

442
00:30:14,142 --> 00:30:14,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

443
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:16,123
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

444
00:30:37,918 --> 00:30:38,599
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I take that back.

445
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:44,563
[SPEAKER_05]: It was originally going to be two separate games, and now it looks like actually they are going to be coming together with one game.

446
00:30:44,903 --> 00:30:50,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And Metal Gear Online will have 16-player support, deathmatch, team deathmatch, King of the Hill, team sneak.

447
00:30:51,048 --> 00:30:52,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Could this be PlayStation 3's version of Halo 3?

448
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

449
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:54,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, certainly not.

450
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there are different types of games, of course.

451
00:30:56,973 --> 00:31:00,455
[SPEAKER_05]: You could say Unreal Tournament is kind of their Halo, but, you know, kind of neat.

452
00:31:00,695 --> 00:31:01,176
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, though.

453
00:31:01,196 --> 00:31:06,760
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just like seeing Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops was its own game, and then the online portion was another game.

454
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:08,701
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still the same damn game.

455
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:14,314
[SPEAKER_04]: And the college is Metal Gear Online, so Metal Gear 4, the online portion of it, I think it's stupid.

456
00:31:14,955 --> 00:31:16,800
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of deceiving the buyer.

457
00:31:17,236 --> 00:31:31,138
[SPEAKER_05]: I think here's where it comes from, why is this just a demo or is this a full game, is because they are saying in the magazine, quote, expecting five maps in the starter pack that will provide the basic setup to get your Metal Gear Solid multiplayer fix moving.

458
00:31:31,478 --> 00:31:42,120
[SPEAKER_05]: So is starter pack a fancy term for demo, or is starter pack something like a luminous starter pack that you get on Xbox 360 Arcade, and then you have to buy all these freaking add-ons to get more stuff for it?

459
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,641
[SPEAKER_04]: They like them add-ons.

460
00:31:44,001 --> 00:31:44,541
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

461
00:31:45,121 --> 00:31:45,561
[SPEAKER_05]: So who knows?

462
00:31:46,181 --> 00:31:46,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

463
00:31:47,321 --> 00:31:47,861
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

464
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:14,426
[SPEAKER_05]: The original Xbox series.

465
00:32:15,006 --> 00:32:17,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought there was one I didn't recognize, but that's it.

466
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:19,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Luckily, I can buy them separately.

467
00:32:19,728 --> 00:32:21,029
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't have to buy all the crappy ones.

468
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:23,490
[SPEAKER_05]: But you get a discount if you buy all the crap together.

469
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

470
00:32:24,451 --> 00:32:24,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

471
00:32:25,551 --> 00:32:27,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I like how they try to trick you to do that kind of stuff.

472
00:32:27,793 --> 00:32:31,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, if you buy ten bags of potatoes, you get them for a buck.

473
00:32:32,315 --> 00:32:33,916
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, ten for a dollar.

474
00:32:34,716 --> 00:32:37,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, there are like ten for ten dollars.

475
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:39,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, Loki's talking about potatoes.

476
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:39,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Please save us.

477
00:32:41,037 --> 00:32:45,678
[SPEAKER_03]: How about some asshattery from Sony?

478
00:32:45,858 --> 00:32:46,238
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

479
00:32:47,419 --> 00:33:00,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the Sony CEO, Howard Stringer, is full of crap because he's quoted as saying, I'm happy the Wii seems to be running a bit short of hardware.

480
00:33:00,782 --> 00:33:06,704
[SPEAKER_03]: The PlayStation 3 will come into its own because its games are infinitely more fun, demanding, and exciting.

481
00:33:07,484 --> 00:33:08,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's bullshit.

482
00:33:10,273 --> 00:33:12,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, the Wii is short on hardware?

483
00:33:12,154 --> 00:33:17,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's a variety of third-party things out there for the Wii.

484
00:33:17,635 --> 00:33:19,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, most of them are shit.

485
00:33:19,556 --> 00:33:23,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I think about that little plastic golf club and stuff that you can get, the little fake tennis racket.

486
00:33:24,197 --> 00:33:25,637
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, there's the Wii Zapper and stuff.

487
00:33:25,657 --> 00:33:27,258
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're meaning the Wii itself.

488
00:33:28,638 --> 00:33:31,539
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're just saying the Wii isn't as fun as the PlayStation 3?

489
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:32,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.

490
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I dispute that claim.

491
00:33:34,665 --> 00:33:36,927
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had a lot more fun playing games on Wii than on PS3.

492
00:33:36,947 --> 00:33:38,468
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii is a lot of fun.

493
00:33:38,548 --> 00:33:44,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, granted, you know, it's not that the PlayStation 3 is horrible, but right now it's kind of close.

494
00:33:44,972 --> 00:33:51,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're thinking that they're going to sell more PlayStation 3s, but honestly, we saw the stack at Best Buy.

495
00:33:52,778 --> 00:33:54,819
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it's not just at that one.

496
00:33:54,879 --> 00:33:57,201
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at a multitude of stores that

497
00:33:57,805 --> 00:33:59,286
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not moving the units.

498
00:33:59,346 --> 00:34:00,488
[SPEAKER_03]: People want a Wii.

499
00:34:00,588 --> 00:34:06,993
[SPEAKER_04]: He does understand that the reason there are no Wiis is because people want them so bad and so they keep selling out.

500
00:34:07,574 --> 00:34:11,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas the PlayStation 3 doesn't have that problem because they're not selling out.

501
00:34:12,118 --> 00:34:14,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't understand.

502
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:18,424
[SPEAKER_04]: And where does he get off saying that their games are more fun?

503
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you like first-person shooters and broken games, that's awesome.

504
00:34:22,481 --> 00:34:25,081
[SPEAKER_05]: I see the PlayStation 3 has a lot of potential.

505
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:26,502
[SPEAKER_04]: It does have potential.

506
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:27,722
[SPEAKER_04]: It just hasn't done anything.

507
00:34:27,962 --> 00:34:29,863
[SPEAKER_05]: I watched that trailer for Final Fantasy XIII.

508
00:34:29,883 --> 00:34:32,543
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a new one that came out this week, and it looks fucking amazing.

509
00:34:32,663 --> 00:34:34,084
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks absolutely fucking amazing.

510
00:34:34,104 --> 00:34:38,785
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be fucking amazing when it comes out Christmas 2009, but I'm not going to wait that long for that shit.

511
00:34:38,825 --> 00:34:44,226
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am so all over a PlayStation 3, like, I don't know, like candy.

512
00:34:44,246 --> 00:34:47,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if they had that, like, you know... Like a fat kid on candy, but I...

513
00:34:48,551 --> 00:34:53,775
[SPEAKER_05]: That trailer was amazing, but for right now, there's not a lot that's making me want to get a PlayStation 3.

514
00:34:53,815 --> 00:34:56,857
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if they had that at launch, we wouldn't be talking about it.

515
00:34:56,877 --> 00:35:03,881
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd be like saying, wow, look at the PlayStation 3, selling millions and millions of units, and Final Fantasy XIII's fucking awesome, I can play this all day long.

516
00:35:04,282 --> 00:35:14,669
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, it's just, the problem is it's not going to come out for a long time, and we got more stories talking about some of the other things that were promised to be out earlier, you know, in 2008, but are probably not, so...

517
00:35:18,345 --> 00:35:25,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, just to illustrate a point, Dan says that he gets about maybe 50 calls a day for people asking for a Wii.

518
00:35:26,009 --> 00:35:29,451
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think he's mentioned anyone calling it at all for a PS3.

519
00:35:30,484 --> 00:35:31,705
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii is selling on fat appeal.

520
00:35:49,696 --> 00:35:50,217
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

521
00:36:08,348 --> 00:36:09,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Money for Nintendo.

522
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:13,409
[SPEAKER_05]: And when this whole Wii Fit thing comes out, I'm going to tell you, it's going to happen all over again.

523
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:16,550
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to continue this fad craze of the Wii until 2008.

524
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:21,071
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just hope it's a good game and fun and useful.

525
00:36:21,331 --> 00:36:22,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares how they're selling systems?

526
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:24,012
[SPEAKER_04]: At least they're selling systems.

527
00:36:24,032 --> 00:36:28,453
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't even fucking pick a damn approach to how they're selling your systems.

528
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:29,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's a PC.

529
00:36:29,673 --> 00:36:30,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's a Blu-ray player.

530
00:36:30,754 --> 00:36:31,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's a game system.

531
00:36:32,294 --> 00:36:33,734
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't fucking make your mind up.

532
00:36:34,434 --> 00:36:35,515
[SPEAKER_04]: So whatever.

533
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:36,635
[SPEAKER_04]: At least it's selling.

534
00:36:38,263 --> 00:36:39,083
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on.

535
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:09,593
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

536
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:32,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, OLRPSP.com I think needs an update badly, especially if that ends up coming out over here.

537
00:37:33,114 --> 00:37:34,376
[SPEAKER_04]: We need people to be able to listen to OLR.

538
00:37:34,396 --> 00:37:35,858
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't broadcast over Shoutcast, though.

539
00:37:36,018 --> 00:37:36,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, sort of.

540
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:40,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you can tap the Live365 feed into Shoutcast somehow.

541
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:40,665
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

542
00:37:40,745 --> 00:37:41,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't you?

543
00:37:41,546 --> 00:37:41,706
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

544
00:37:41,907 --> 00:37:42,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it!

545
00:37:43,436 --> 00:37:44,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how, at least.

546
00:37:45,236 --> 00:37:46,156
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could, that'd be awesome.

547
00:37:46,417 --> 00:37:47,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we'll have to look into that.

548
00:37:47,497 --> 00:37:50,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know we get emails once in a while from people, right?

549
00:37:50,397 --> 00:37:52,398
[SPEAKER_05]: They say, we listen on PSP, we listen on PSP.

550
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:59,499
[SPEAKER_05]: If that stuff comes out over here, heck, even if it doesn't come out over here, I bet there's got to be at least a handful of people that listen on their PSPs to this program in Japan.

551
00:38:00,439 --> 00:38:02,859
[SPEAKER_05]: We ought to be able to let them listen live on their PSPs.

552
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:03,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

553
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:03,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

554
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Get on that, Loki.

555
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Make it happen.

556
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, let me just figure out how to broadcast and shoutcast.

557
00:38:10,161 --> 00:38:10,961
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be awesome.

558
00:38:10,981 --> 00:38:11,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you do that.

559
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:12,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Homework assignment.

560
00:38:12,642 --> 00:38:14,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I've already tried doing that stuff.

561
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:15,944
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't figure it out.

562
00:38:16,104 --> 00:38:17,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm too stupid.

563
00:38:17,585 --> 00:38:18,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to hear that.

564
00:38:18,805 --> 00:38:20,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to some release dates.

565
00:38:20,206 --> 00:38:23,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of our friends over in Japan, I've got the Japanese release dates for you.

566
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:29,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming on the Xbox 360 December 20th, FIFA 08 World Class Soccer comes out in Japan.

567
00:38:29,451 --> 00:38:32,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on with the release dates, we also have a release of FIFA 08 on the PlayStation 3.

568
00:38:33,014 --> 00:38:37,656
[SPEAKER_05]: The GunCon makes its way to the PlayStation 3 separately, I assume.

569
00:38:37,976 --> 00:38:40,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, Time Crisis finally comes out in Japan as well.

570
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:46,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Time Crisis 4 makes its way to the PlayStation 3 in Japan this week, also on the 20th.

571
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:52,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Medal of Honor Airborne also makes its way from EA to the PlayStation 3 in Japan this week.

572
00:38:53,068 --> 00:38:56,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Crazy Climber Wii.

573
00:38:56,671 --> 00:38:59,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember we reported on this earlier a couple months ago.

574
00:38:59,273 --> 00:39:03,837
[SPEAKER_05]: They were remaking the classic 80s game Crazy Climber for the Wii.

575
00:39:04,037 --> 00:39:06,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Japan will finally get its first look at that this week.

576
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:07,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we will soon.

577
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Meet the Robinsons Attack of the Toybots

578
00:39:21,243 --> 00:39:22,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Cats with a Z2 and Dogs with a Z2

579
00:39:41,187 --> 00:39:43,448
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not awesome, but they're not horrible.

580
00:40:04,358 --> 00:40:04,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

581
00:40:05,518 --> 00:40:10,640
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it's stupid, but hey, over here, at least in the United States, it's only like 30 bucks.

582
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,821
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, wait, find one used for like 10 bucks or something like that, there you go.

583
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you feel like paying twice as much, you could import the one from Japan.

584
00:40:18,782 --> 00:40:21,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I would rather not, because it's already out over here.

585
00:40:21,303 --> 00:40:23,023
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no point in importing.

586
00:40:23,996 --> 00:40:25,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, moving on with other release dates.

587
00:40:25,997 --> 00:40:29,198
[SPEAKER_05]: The PlayStation 2 is getting some releases as well.

588
00:40:29,918 --> 00:40:32,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Myself, Yourself is a game that's coming out.

589
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:35,220
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a limited edition of it as well on the 20th.

590
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Another game called Pia Carrot y Yokoso, G.O.

591
00:40:39,322 --> 00:40:39,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Summer Fair.

592
00:40:40,382 --> 00:40:41,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Also has a limited edition.

593
00:40:41,863 --> 00:40:43,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Pia Carrot's old school too.

594
00:40:43,623 --> 00:40:45,044
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an old school anime, right?

595
00:40:45,084 --> 00:40:47,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the games have been out for quite a while.

596
00:40:48,185 --> 00:40:50,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess it's another one coming out.

597
00:40:51,427 --> 00:40:53,988
[SPEAKER_05]: December 20th, just in time for Christmas over in Japan.

598
00:40:55,629 --> 00:40:57,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking at a couple other games.

599
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:01,551
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see if there's anything on the DS or PSP, because of course those are always crazy.

600
00:41:02,732 --> 00:41:04,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Port of Meet the Robinsons on the DS.

601
00:41:04,972 --> 00:41:07,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Doku Demo Pilates comes out.

602
00:41:07,773 --> 00:41:10,534
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not Pirates, that's Pilates comes out in Japan as well.

603
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:17,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Dora Base, Dorimon Chao Yakyu Gaiden comes out from Namco on the Nintendo DS.

604
00:41:17,757 --> 00:41:19,578
[SPEAKER_05]: A puzzler called DS Puzzler.

605
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:24,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Numbluff DS Puzzler comes out as well on the Nintendo DS.

606
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,541
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure a lot of people are very excited about this.

607
00:41:26,581 --> 00:41:28,321
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one that folks might even be importing.

608
00:41:28,761 --> 00:41:33,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy IV, the remake, hits Japan this week on the Nintendo DS.

609
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:37,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure that's going to be the best-selling game of the week as far as the new stuff goes.

610
00:41:38,045 --> 00:41:39,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the sound of this game, though.

611
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:41,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Pinky Street Kira Kira Music Night.

612
00:41:42,306 --> 00:41:43,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, fun!

613
00:41:43,147 --> 00:41:44,847
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have Pinky Street dolls.

614
00:41:45,528 --> 00:41:45,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

615
00:41:46,788 --> 00:41:49,129
[SPEAKER_03]: What they are, they're these little plastic dolls.

616
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:52,657
[SPEAKER_03]: and there may be about, I would want to say like three inches tall.

617
00:41:53,237 --> 00:41:54,098
[SPEAKER_03]: They're smurf-sized.

618
00:41:54,758 --> 00:41:56,539
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, no, that's three apples high.

619
00:41:56,919 --> 00:42:08,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, you can take off their heads and change them out and take off their hair and change them out and it's like you snap them into place is how they work.

620
00:42:09,463 --> 00:42:16,066
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're fully customizable and I guess it would be the same type of thing on the game as you customize your pinky and

621
00:42:17,226 --> 00:42:19,108
[SPEAKER_03]: and I've got like a few of them by now.

622
00:42:19,148 --> 00:42:24,291
[SPEAKER_03]: They even did Street Fighter and King of Fighters themed ones and Sakura Taisen.

623
00:42:24,952 --> 00:42:25,912
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got a few of those.

624
00:42:26,853 --> 00:42:27,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, very interesting.

625
00:42:28,394 --> 00:42:29,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any interest in getting this game?

626
00:42:29,995 --> 00:42:30,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Importing it maybe?

627
00:42:30,776 --> 00:42:30,976
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

628
00:42:31,356 --> 00:42:31,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

629
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:33,177
[SPEAKER_05]: After all that.

630
00:42:33,577 --> 00:42:35,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that's it for Japanese release.

631
00:42:35,259 --> 00:42:37,020
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I'm going to cover on Japanese release dates.

632
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

633
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,283
[SPEAKER_04]: So is that like, you know, build a human type thing?

634
00:42:41,943 --> 00:42:42,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.

635
00:42:42,363 --> 00:42:43,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll find a link for the chat room.

636
00:42:43,744 --> 00:42:44,905
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea.

637
00:42:44,945 --> 00:42:45,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go over to Europe.

638
00:42:45,986 --> 00:42:46,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

639
00:42:46,793 --> 00:42:48,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Only one game is on the list.

640
00:42:48,414 --> 00:42:48,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

641
00:42:49,214 --> 00:42:51,195
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 19th, Sensible World of Soccer.

642
00:42:52,456 --> 00:42:55,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, coming out finally to the Xbox 360 Live Arcade.

643
00:42:55,777 --> 00:42:56,278
[SPEAKER_03]: That is it.

644
00:42:56,718 --> 00:42:59,159
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I guess it's slowing down because it's Christmas time.

645
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:00,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess so.

646
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,380
[SPEAKER_04]: How about the U.S.?

647
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:02,681
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the U.S.

648
00:43:02,721 --> 00:43:03,621
[SPEAKER_04]: has got a few things.

649
00:43:03,721 --> 00:43:04,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Not as much as usual.

650
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:06,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, a few things.

651
00:43:07,343 --> 00:43:15,126
[SPEAKER_04]: MX vs. ATV Untamed coming out on PSP, PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 and DS.

652
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:20,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Elements of Destruction is coming out on DS and that game is kind of neat looking.

653
00:43:20,743 --> 00:43:26,227
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically you kind of play Mother Nature so you can cause tornadoes and fires and stuff.

654
00:43:26,628 --> 00:43:29,910
[SPEAKER_04]: It is also coming to Xbox Live Arcade at some point.

655
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:31,091
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of neat.

656
00:43:32,072 --> 00:43:34,153
[SPEAKER_04]: And then let's see here.

657
00:43:34,233 --> 00:43:37,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Warhammer 40,000 Squad Command on the DS.

658
00:43:38,216 --> 00:43:42,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Dyson Ryaku Exceed coming to the PlayStation 2.

659
00:43:44,661 --> 00:43:45,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see here.

660
00:43:46,143 --> 00:43:46,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Also

661
00:43:48,386 --> 00:43:50,088
[SPEAKER_04]: The PlayStation 2 of Rock Band.

662
00:43:50,868 --> 00:43:52,710
[SPEAKER_04]: That game's coming out this week as well.

663
00:43:53,591 --> 00:43:55,012
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see here.

664
00:43:55,052 --> 00:43:57,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Atari Classics Evolved for the PSP.

665
00:43:57,654 --> 00:43:59,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Another one of those compilation sets.

666
00:43:59,976 --> 00:44:01,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Luxor 2 on the DS.

667
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:06,862
[SPEAKER_04]: And Knights Journey of Dreams on the Wii.

668
00:44:09,164 --> 00:44:11,205
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can get your Knights fix here pretty soon.

669
00:44:11,245 --> 00:44:12,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie's applauding over there.

670
00:44:12,326 --> 00:44:14,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been getting my Knights fix already.

671
00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:17,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you ask Santa for that for Christmas?

672
00:44:17,704 --> 00:44:20,604
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm probably going to get it, but we've been playing Christmas nights.

673
00:44:22,145 --> 00:44:25,686
[SPEAKER_04]: And then one other thing I was going to mention here real quick.

674
00:44:25,886 --> 00:44:28,627
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a game, but I thought it's interesting anyways.

675
00:44:29,007 --> 00:44:32,548
[SPEAKER_04]: MadCatz is putting out an HDMI conversion kit.

676
00:44:32,608 --> 00:44:38,309
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for all those people like me that do not have an Xbox 360 with HDMI out.

677
00:44:38,669 --> 00:44:44,331
[SPEAKER_04]: It plugs into the back of your system and it allows you to do HDMI and optical out as well.

678
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:48,983
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, although the only sting to it is it retails for $89.99.

679
00:44:51,465 --> 00:44:51,826
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

680
00:44:54,588 --> 00:45:01,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo announced this week, you know, obviously they're having some issues staying on top of manufacturing enough Wii's for everybody out there.

681
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:04,416
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is their contingency plan they announced this week.

682
00:45:05,457 --> 00:45:09,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Reggie Fils-Aimé came out this week and said, hey, we're joining up with GameStop.

683
00:45:10,181 --> 00:45:12,743
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to create this Wii Rain Check program.

684
00:45:13,363 --> 00:45:13,923
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

685
00:45:37,013 --> 00:45:39,995
[SPEAKER_05]: to be able to take these type of deposits for games.

686
00:45:40,575 --> 00:45:42,696
[SPEAKER_05]: That's at least the reason why they did it.

687
00:45:42,856 --> 00:45:49,700
[SPEAKER_05]: The only days, however, that you can do this, December 20th and 21st, are the only days that you are going to be able to do this.

688
00:45:50,440 --> 00:46:00,745
[SPEAKER_05]: However, there are supposed to be tens of thousands of rain checks available, and who knows, that may still not be enough for the demand of the console, because it's the Furby of 2007.

689
00:46:01,165 --> 00:46:02,446
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Cabbage Patch Kid.

690
00:46:03,266 --> 00:46:04,847
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the gift of this year.

691
00:46:04,927 --> 00:46:06,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I waited in line.

692
00:46:07,148 --> 00:46:07,608
[SPEAKER_05]: for a Wii.

693
00:46:07,909 --> 00:46:08,489
[SPEAKER_03]: For my Wii.

694
00:46:08,709 --> 00:46:09,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

695
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:11,272
[SPEAKER_05]: I made my roommate wait in line for mine and it worked.

696
00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:12,633
[SPEAKER_05]: It did very well.

697
00:46:13,074 --> 00:46:16,577
[SPEAKER_03]: See, it just goes to show that sometimes, you know, waiting in line for...

698
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:19,092
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, these things actually does pay off.

699
00:46:19,393 --> 00:46:19,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

700
00:46:19,873 --> 00:46:22,897
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, how would you feel if you were one of those kids?

701
00:46:23,117 --> 00:46:23,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's flash back.

702
00:46:23,918 --> 00:46:27,222
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I told the story earlier in the show about me as the spoiled brat when I was a kid.

703
00:46:27,642 --> 00:46:31,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's flash back to me as the spoiled brat as a kid who wanted a Nintendo Wii this Christmas.

704
00:46:32,048 --> 00:46:34,651
[SPEAKER_05]: And I open up my present to get one of these rain checks.

705
00:46:35,211 --> 00:46:37,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I going to be a satisfied kid or am I going to cry?

706
00:46:39,465 --> 00:46:39,886
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

707
00:46:55,609 --> 00:46:59,250
[SPEAKER_04]: We couldn't get you one right now, but we will get you one by the end of January.

708
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:01,470
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to say, here's a fucking rain check for you.

709
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,210
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's just like, kids are like, what?

710
00:47:04,811 --> 00:47:06,051
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand this.

711
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:07,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not kidding.

712
00:47:07,231 --> 00:47:08,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the controller?

713
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:09,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's Mario?

714
00:47:09,151 --> 00:47:10,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Santa hates me.

715
00:47:10,672 --> 00:47:15,852
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to go take the rain check and soak it with his tears is what he's going to do.

716
00:47:17,013 --> 00:47:17,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what?

717
00:47:18,473 --> 00:47:24,834
[SPEAKER_03]: In my family, when I was a kid, if there was something that I wanted and didn't get, I lived with it.

718
00:47:27,927 --> 00:47:33,188
[SPEAKER_05]: or you get a job mowing lawns or selling lemonade and you save up and you buy the fucking thing yourself.

719
00:47:33,248 --> 00:47:34,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I stole it from my brother.

720
00:47:35,249 --> 00:47:36,669
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly what you do.

721
00:47:36,709 --> 00:47:45,471
[SPEAKER_03]: See, the year you wanted your Super Nintendo and everything, my brothers went into Super Nintendo and my mom asked me, should I give them a Super Nintendo or a Genesis?

722
00:47:45,731 --> 00:47:48,151
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to give them a Super Nintendo and you need to get these games.

723
00:47:49,091 --> 00:47:51,632
[SPEAKER_03]: She got them a Super Scope, Zelda.

724
00:47:52,392 --> 00:47:54,773
[SPEAKER_03]: She picked out Home Alone for some retarded reason.

725
00:47:54,793 --> 00:47:56,133
[SPEAKER_03]: That game sucked ass.

726
00:47:56,738 --> 00:47:59,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Home Alone, Kevin McAllister's so cute.

727
00:48:01,902 --> 00:48:06,566
[SPEAKER_03]: And so my brothers played like five seconds of Home Alone and then I beat Zelda that week.

728
00:48:08,567 --> 00:48:11,670
[SPEAKER_05]: So did your brothers even play the Super Nintendo or was this your present?

729
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:13,991
[SPEAKER_05]: They played Home Alone and they're like, what did I do bad?

730
00:48:14,111 --> 00:48:16,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, why am I being punished?

731
00:48:16,513 --> 00:48:23,819
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they actually, my brothers and I played a lot of Blastress and the mole thing.

732
00:48:25,174 --> 00:48:32,657
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to get Jamie a copy of Home Alone on the Super Nintendo for Christmas and wrap it in coal and put it in her stocking.

733
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:34,857
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be great.

734
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:41,180
[SPEAKER_03]: My little brothers are too busy running around being little terrorists in the neighborhood, so I have the Super Nintendo.

735
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Comments from chat, love it.

736
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,142
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt says, Dear little Billy, I owe you a Wii.

737
00:48:47,222 --> 00:48:47,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Love, Santa.

738
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:49,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiger Claw.

739
00:48:49,812 --> 00:48:51,293
[SPEAKER_05]: What if you lose the rain check?

740
00:48:51,313 --> 00:48:52,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't you be screwed?

741
00:48:53,193 --> 00:48:54,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you would be.

742
00:48:54,253 --> 00:48:56,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you would because GameStop sucks.

743
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:58,054
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd be like, oh, you don't have your receipt.

744
00:48:58,374 --> 00:48:59,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Billy.

745
00:48:59,614 --> 00:49:00,955
[SPEAKER_05]: You ain't ever getting a win.

746
00:49:00,975 --> 00:49:07,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I seem to recall I didn't have my receipt once for a $5 pre-order and they still gave it to me because it was in the phone number in the system.

747
00:49:07,156 --> 00:49:12,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not only that, they actually keep a copy of your...

748
00:49:13,587 --> 00:49:15,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I love this comment from Gerardimo.

749
00:49:15,128 --> 00:49:21,070
[SPEAKER_04]: My mommy wrote me a note from Santa that said the elves couldn't find a copy of Hey You Pikachu because the store was sold out and I would get it eventually.

750
00:49:42,912 --> 00:49:43,873
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so cute.

751
00:49:45,735 --> 00:49:47,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, what's this?

752
00:49:48,977 --> 00:49:51,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma says, fuck rain checks, give me a gift card.

753
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,343
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ross Steel UT in response says, even that would be better than a fucking IOU.

754
00:49:56,004 --> 00:50:00,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, seriously, because, you know, this is why I love the concept of gift cards.

755
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:03,771
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because, especially for me being picky as a kid...

756
00:50:04,466 --> 00:50:11,689
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, you know, if I got something I didn't want, I always took it back to the store myself, returned it myself, and got what I wanted.

757
00:50:11,969 --> 00:50:13,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I was just thinking something there.

758
00:50:14,691 --> 00:50:28,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo's quite smart teaming up with GameStop, you know, with this whole rain check thing, because if for whatever reason Nintendo can't deliver those Wii's by the end of January, people are going to be fucking pissed off at GameStop, but no one's going to remember that it's Nintendo's fault.

759
00:50:28,837 --> 00:50:32,539
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to hear more about 10-year-old Jamie marching into the store and returning your gifts.

760
00:50:34,349 --> 00:50:43,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's like, my family would buy me ugly clothes, so I... Okay, now it's just funny, sorry.

761
00:50:43,276 --> 00:50:47,260
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would make them drop me off at the mall, and then I'd go do all my exchanges myself.

762
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,044
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes I'd get cash back and then go over to Babbage's, because we had Babbage's.

763
00:50:52,804 --> 00:50:56,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Before, you know, before GameStop took them all over.

764
00:50:57,308 --> 00:50:58,409
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm not going to wear this.

765
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:00,451
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm taking it back.

766
00:51:01,271 --> 00:51:01,912
[SPEAKER_04]: To get games.

767
00:51:02,773 --> 00:51:03,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead.

768
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:05,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, shoes.

769
00:51:06,733 --> 00:51:10,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, you know, if they wouldn't, I would just, you know, get like a different pair of jeans or something.

770
00:51:10,955 --> 00:51:18,198
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like, and it wasn't that I was, I am not, it wasn't that I was ungrateful or anything.

771
00:51:18,278 --> 00:51:20,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a sick bastard, as GS68 put it.

772
00:51:20,859 --> 00:51:28,943
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it wasn't that I was ungrateful or anything, you know, because I was plenty grateful for the stuff that I got because, you know, when I was growing up, we didn't actually have a whole lot of money.

773
00:51:29,643 --> 00:51:29,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

774
00:51:30,791 --> 00:51:35,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, you know, when I was, you know, in first and second grade, we were actually poverty level.

775
00:51:35,895 --> 00:51:42,660
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I remember having, you know, icicles in my bathtub one winter, and I'm not even joking.

776
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,802
[SPEAKER_03]: So, now I think I'm really spoiled.

777
00:51:47,363 --> 00:51:52,307
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I was a kid, I didn't have, you know, if I got something...

778
00:51:53,081 --> 00:51:56,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, if it wasn't what I wanted, I found a way to turn it into what I wanted.

779
00:51:57,385 --> 00:51:59,487
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it was just a matter of that.

780
00:51:59,687 --> 00:52:03,390
[SPEAKER_03]: And all these kids who say, Oh, but I want a Wii.

781
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:04,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, tough shit.

782
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:07,214
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no Wiis.

783
00:52:08,094 --> 00:52:08,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Get something else.

784
00:52:09,616 --> 00:52:10,136
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll live.

785
00:52:10,356 --> 00:52:11,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a job, Billy.

786
00:52:13,699 --> 00:52:15,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Santa didn't buy you a Wii because you don't have a job.

787
00:52:16,542 --> 00:52:16,782
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

788
00:52:17,162 --> 00:52:18,864
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, but you see...

789
00:52:20,488 --> 00:52:33,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there's just way too much of, oh, well, you know, I, and Dan is actually saying, and I'm not going to go into any detail on this, but this person is saying, oh, I spent all this money in your store and I'm entitled to a Wii.

790
00:52:33,514 --> 00:52:34,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we don't have any.

791
00:52:34,514 --> 00:52:35,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Tough shit.

792
00:52:35,935 --> 00:52:42,798
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think that people need to learn to be, I guess, to take no for an answer and find something else.

793
00:52:43,513 --> 00:52:48,736
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I can just imagine if Jamie had a kid, or maybe I would do this to my kid, and I wasn't able to get a Wii for my kid.

794
00:52:48,877 --> 00:52:51,038
[SPEAKER_05]: I would leave a note under the tree for something like this.

795
00:52:51,058 --> 00:52:51,818
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something like this.

796
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:55,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Santa is very sorry that he could not get you a Wii this year.

797
00:52:55,721 --> 00:52:59,163
[SPEAKER_05]: He has more important things to do, like ending genocide in Darfur.

798
00:52:59,804 --> 00:53:00,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

799
00:53:00,804 --> 00:53:02,425
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't do any of that kind of crap.

800
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:03,146
[SPEAKER_04]: He just delivers.

801
00:53:03,326 --> 00:53:06,028
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a fucking glorified UPS driver, is what he is.

802
00:53:06,488 --> 00:53:07,449
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but seriously, though...

803
00:53:09,437 --> 00:53:13,260
[SPEAKER_04]: All these people that think they need special treatment stuff are finding Wiis and stuff like that.

804
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I get customers asking, you know, yeah, I have someone looking for a Wii.

805
00:53:17,283 --> 00:53:19,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, you know, it's like two weeks before Christmas.

806
00:53:19,325 --> 00:53:21,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Why the fuck are they just now looking for a Wii?

807
00:53:21,487 --> 00:53:22,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Why didn't they plan this out?

808
00:53:23,248 --> 00:53:24,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they didn't know it was going to be so hard to find.

809
00:53:24,949 --> 00:53:26,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, tough shit for them!

810
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:29,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Why should we cater to the fact that they're stupid?

811
00:53:29,393 --> 00:53:30,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

812
00:53:31,454 --> 00:53:33,356
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure we've got lots of holiday stories.

813
00:53:33,416 --> 00:53:35,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we'll get some of them in our mailbag later from our listeners.

814
00:53:36,238 --> 00:53:38,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to be, you know, all kinds of

815
00:53:39,042 --> 00:53:41,744
[SPEAKER_03]: ZenoCore in chat says, Dude, I would do that too.

816
00:54:04,969 --> 00:54:06,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on with more news.

817
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:09,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, what's the latest news at Jamie's Gaming Outlet?

818
00:54:09,693 --> 00:54:11,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, virtual console stuff.

819
00:54:11,854 --> 00:54:17,058
[SPEAKER_03]: For our friends in the UK, we have Pokemon Snap that was on the Nintendo 64.

820
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:22,462
[SPEAKER_03]: And Pokemon Snap is great and it's fun and lovely.

821
00:54:23,243 --> 00:54:26,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have Top Hunter that was on Neo Geo.

822
00:54:26,385 --> 00:54:32,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I didn't really like Top Hunter all that much, so I'm not going to talk about it.

823
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:44,436
[SPEAKER_03]: And the last one, which is almost as cool as Pokemon Snap, but cooler in its own respect, is Mega Man 2 from Nintendo Entertainment System.

824
00:54:45,976 --> 00:54:50,158
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't know what Mega Man 2 is, you need to climb out of that cave you've been living in for the past 20 years.

825
00:54:50,178 --> 00:54:52,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they have Mega Man 1 on Virtual Console over there?

826
00:54:52,839 --> 00:54:53,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

827
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is Mega Man 2 the first game they're getting?

828
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Mega Man 2 is the first.

829
00:54:56,581 --> 00:54:57,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I want both!

830
00:54:58,362 --> 00:54:59,162
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want Mega Man 3!

831
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:01,163
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one was great!

832
00:55:02,463 --> 00:55:02,964
[SPEAKER_05]: It really was!

833
00:55:02,984 --> 00:55:04,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of the Cutman weapon.

834
00:55:04,685 --> 00:55:07,988
[SPEAKER_05]: It was different than all the others, but it was great, and it had some awesome music.

835
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:11,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of my favorite music ever from a video game was, like, a Lechman stage.

836
00:55:11,651 --> 00:55:12,112
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great.

837
00:55:12,132 --> 00:55:17,296
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really liked the Metal Blades, though, and Mega Man 2.

838
00:55:17,877 --> 00:55:22,681
[SPEAKER_03]: But I totally loved Mega Man 3, because you had to beat the game with the top, with, like, the most useless weapon.

839
00:55:23,822 --> 00:55:25,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, Ross Steel UT has a good point, though.

840
00:55:25,644 --> 00:55:27,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I already have Mega Man Collection.

841
00:55:27,606 --> 00:55:28,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Good point.

842
00:55:28,905 --> 00:55:32,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not just get the Mega Man collection and do the backwards compatibility with the GameCube disc?

843
00:55:33,148 --> 00:55:33,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Good thought.

844
00:55:34,689 --> 00:55:36,470
[SPEAKER_05]: F the virtual console for Mega Man, huh?

845
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, F the virtual console.

846
00:55:40,152 --> 00:55:41,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Why should I have to buy games again?

847
00:55:42,134 --> 00:55:45,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn you, Nintendo, and trying to get me to purchase stuff I've already purchased again.

848
00:55:46,356 --> 00:55:46,917
[SPEAKER_05]: And it works.

849
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:48,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, stupid Game Boy.

850
00:55:49,278 --> 00:55:49,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways...

851
00:55:51,283 --> 00:55:55,184
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that we're going to be getting over here pretty soon, Dragon Quest Swords.

852
00:55:55,524 --> 00:55:57,224
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been announced to come to the U.S.

853
00:55:57,504 --> 00:55:58,324
[SPEAKER_04]: on February 26th.

854
00:55:58,584 --> 00:56:00,705
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a really fucking long name.

855
00:56:01,645 --> 00:56:04,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragon Quest Swords, The Masked Queen, and The Tower of Mirrors.

856
00:56:06,246 --> 00:56:07,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Too long of a subtitle.

857
00:56:09,646 --> 00:56:10,647
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like a pretty fun game.

858
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:18,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not yet played the Japanese version of it, but you use the Wiimote to slash at slime, so that can't be that bad.

859
00:56:19,841 --> 00:56:22,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't they have that same thing on the PlayStation 2, I seem to recall?

860
00:56:23,002 --> 00:56:29,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I remember going to some anime convention and in a back room they had a Dragon Quest game that had a giant sword and you'd slash slimes.

861
00:56:29,265 --> 00:56:30,345
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, yeah.

862
00:56:30,545 --> 00:56:32,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they had an arcade version of that.

863
00:56:32,706 --> 00:56:34,187
[SPEAKER_04]: They did have an arcade version, so.

864
00:56:34,327 --> 00:56:34,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

865
00:56:34,767 --> 00:56:35,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's the same thing.

866
00:56:36,988 --> 00:56:37,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of neat.

867
00:56:37,348 --> 00:56:39,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps, but I guess this has taken a while.

868
00:56:39,949 --> 00:56:42,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't this supposed to be a launch game and we're just now getting it?

869
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:43,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah.

870
00:56:43,671 --> 00:56:43,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

871
00:56:44,682 --> 00:56:47,124
[SPEAKER_05]: along with the whole Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

872
00:56:47,484 --> 00:56:48,385
[SPEAKER_05]: What the F-square?

873
00:56:48,425 --> 00:56:49,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Where the hell did your Wii games go?

874
00:56:50,026 --> 00:56:52,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Crystal Chronicles, I want to say, was like June now.

875
00:56:52,908 --> 00:56:54,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeez, that was supposed to be a launch game.

876
00:56:54,569 --> 00:56:55,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I crazy?

877
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:55,870
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

878
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:56,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was.

879
00:56:56,931 --> 00:56:57,331
[SPEAKER_04]: No, wait.

880
00:56:57,391 --> 00:56:57,711
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

881
00:56:57,751 --> 00:56:58,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, not June.

882
00:56:58,692 --> 00:57:01,134
[SPEAKER_04]: It's spring, but it's only the DS version.

883
00:57:01,154 --> 00:57:03,615
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't announced the Wii version yet.

884
00:57:03,936 --> 00:57:05,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Crystal Chronicles was kind of underrated.

885
00:57:05,697 --> 00:57:06,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I really loved that game.

886
00:57:06,758 --> 00:57:11,461
[SPEAKER_05]: The only problem with it is that, God, you had to have a lot of shit in order to be able to play that game, including four people.

887
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:16,413
[SPEAKER_05]: and four Game Boy Advances and four Link Kills and everything.

888
00:57:17,273 --> 00:57:24,235
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, if you want a Wii to be playing the Dragon Quest game on, of course, we've been talking about that they're practically impossible to find.

889
00:57:24,255 --> 00:57:33,077
[SPEAKER_05]: But one thing to keep in mind is that the Nintendo World Store in New York City in Rockefeller Center, they get more shipments of the Wii every morning.

890
00:57:34,118 --> 00:57:42,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, a reporter from Game Daily visited the store recently and observed that there were 20 Wiis lined up behind the main counter just waiting for whoever's in line.

891
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:53,604
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's been going on is that more and more recently, WCBS Radio reported not that long ago that there were over 200 people camped out outside the store before the store even opened.

892
00:57:54,505 --> 00:57:59,467
[SPEAKER_05]: And some folks are traveling all the way from Virginia to get a freaking Nintendo Wii.

893
00:57:59,487 --> 00:58:02,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Well shit, that's a good way to do it if you know that they're going to get some in every day.

894
00:58:03,449 --> 00:58:07,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, if you don't get it the first day, go see some sites, come back and camp later.

895
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:09,892
[SPEAKER_04]: What about like your day job?

896
00:58:10,012 --> 00:58:10,852
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, is it just me?

897
00:58:12,011 --> 00:58:12,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck that.

898
00:58:12,771 --> 00:58:14,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting a Wii for Billy is more important.

899
00:58:16,072 --> 00:58:17,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I digress, but never mind.

900
00:58:17,793 --> 00:58:19,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on with some more gaming news.

901
00:58:21,374 --> 00:58:31,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, more Wii stuff is the game Castle Shikigami 3 will be coming out to Nintendo Wii next year.

902
00:58:33,318 --> 00:58:35,819
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a lot to do with dodging bullets.

903
00:58:36,499 --> 00:58:37,280
[SPEAKER_04]: It's bullet hell.

904
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:38,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

905
00:58:40,305 --> 00:58:40,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

906
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:43,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Good for those fans of Ikaruga and stuff like that.

907
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:46,707
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very interesting shooter.

908
00:58:46,787 --> 00:58:48,327
[SPEAKER_03]: And also you collect coins while you play.

909
00:58:49,048 --> 00:58:50,368
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder how that's going to control the Wii.

910
00:58:50,388 --> 00:58:55,210
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if it's going to be like Geometry Wars where you point at the screen where you want to shoot or if it's going to have that kind of functionality in it.

911
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:56,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

912
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:59,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're probably thinking way too much into it.

913
00:58:59,451 --> 00:59:01,531
[SPEAKER_04]: No, seriously, seriously.

914
00:59:01,551 --> 00:59:06,513
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll probably just have the controller turned sideways and playing it like a virtual console game.

915
00:59:07,529 --> 00:59:08,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, I guess that'll work too, huh?

916
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:12,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because, I mean, a lot of these games don't use the motion controls and stuff like that.

917
00:59:13,031 --> 00:59:14,952
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be too hard, especially with, like, pinpoint stuff.

918
00:59:15,892 --> 00:59:16,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that works.

919
00:59:16,893 --> 00:59:21,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, um, so, there's another game coming to the Wii.

920
00:59:21,854 --> 00:59:23,355
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of interesting, actually.

921
00:59:23,695 --> 00:59:29,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I laughed when I saw it because even though there's a game that's just like it that's already been announced, we don't know when that's coming out.

922
00:59:29,897 --> 00:59:33,679
[SPEAKER_04]: This game, though, however, is coming out, I want to say, in March.

923
00:59:34,379 --> 00:59:34,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

924
00:59:35,302 --> 00:59:36,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Wild Earth, African Safari

925
00:59:53,147 --> 00:59:54,108
[SPEAKER_04]: How can you say that?

926
00:59:54,148 --> 00:59:56,049
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know anything about Africa.

927
00:59:56,809 --> 01:00:00,450
[SPEAKER_05]: They are similar in the regards they are both about Africa.

928
01:00:00,951 --> 01:00:03,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Africa is a giant fucking place.

929
01:00:03,292 --> 01:00:04,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you are aware.

930
01:00:04,632 --> 01:00:09,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I will have you know that there's photography in this game much like Africa.

931
01:00:10,535 --> 01:00:12,996
[SPEAKER_04]: There are animals just like Africa.

932
01:00:13,836 --> 01:00:14,917
[SPEAKER_04]: They both take place in Africa.

933
01:00:15,097 --> 01:00:18,618
[SPEAKER_04]: If anything else, I would say this is more authentic because they spelled Africa correctly.

934
01:00:19,058 --> 01:00:20,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so whatever.

935
01:00:21,198 --> 01:00:25,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, Safari Photo Africa Wild Earth is a PC game.

936
01:00:25,299 --> 01:00:36,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it got released a while ago and took home some awards in the 2003 Independent Games Festival, including the coveted Seamus McNally Grand Prize.

937
01:00:36,903 --> 01:00:38,024
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck that's supposed to mean?

938
01:00:38,524 --> 01:00:50,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, this game takes place... You are a photojournalist exploring Africa's Serengeti National Park, tasked with taking photos of 30 different animals in their natural habitat.

939
01:00:50,882 --> 01:00:57,925
[SPEAKER_04]: and apparently if you get close to the animals for the perfect shot or if you get too close the Wiimote will rumble making it harder to snap the picture.

940
01:00:59,045 --> 01:01:07,028
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Wii version will include co-op, multiplayer, one player to drive while the other two shoot photos.

941
01:01:07,548 --> 01:01:09,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately we can't run over the animals with the

942
01:01:09,921 --> 01:01:11,902
[SPEAKER_04]: The Jeep, at least I don't think you can.

943
01:01:12,102 --> 01:01:13,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Boring.

944
01:01:13,362 --> 01:01:16,423
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only one I'm going to play in these games, is if I can run over the animals.

945
01:01:16,783 --> 01:01:17,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get it.

946
01:01:17,484 --> 01:01:19,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, what the hell's going on here?

947
01:01:19,064 --> 01:01:25,106
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting Africa on the PlayStation 3, this Safari game on the Wii, yet still no Jumbo Safari.

948
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,027
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell is wrong with this world?

949
01:01:27,687 --> 01:01:31,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, we have no Jumbo Safari, but we also have no Planet Harrier.

950
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:33,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi!

951
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:37,511
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all those games that came out around that time.

952
01:01:37,571 --> 01:01:37,911
[SPEAKER_03]: We have...

953
01:01:38,872 --> 01:01:45,716
[SPEAKER_03]: If Sega would give us a dedicated platform, a dedicated system, then we would have all this awesome.

954
01:01:46,276 --> 01:01:46,717
[SPEAKER_03]: But no!

955
01:01:47,077 --> 01:01:48,197
[SPEAKER_05]: OMG, Dreamcast 2.

956
01:01:48,718 --> 01:01:49,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish!

957
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:50,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Jumbo Safari packing game.

958
01:01:50,819 --> 01:01:53,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't Jumbo Safari kind of a gun game almost?

959
01:01:53,781 --> 01:01:55,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was.

960
01:01:55,602 --> 01:01:56,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Harpoon.

961
01:01:57,623 --> 01:01:58,283
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Harpoon.

962
01:01:58,523 --> 01:01:58,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Harpoon.

963
01:02:00,404 --> 01:02:01,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Harpoon.

964
01:02:01,025 --> 01:02:02,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Harpoon.

965
01:02:03,026 --> 01:02:05,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisbee calls it Pokemon Snafrica.

966
01:02:06,388 --> 01:02:06,868
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

967
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:13,153
[SPEAKER_04]: The only bad thing about this thing, and no offense to Majesco, but Majesco's putting it out.

968
01:02:14,394 --> 01:02:16,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, what was the last good game from Majesco that came out?

969
01:02:19,337 --> 01:02:20,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you a hint.

970
01:02:20,037 --> 01:02:27,422
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one game that they put out in the Wii that I remember, and that was that... Oh, fuck, what was it called?

971
01:02:27,722 --> 01:02:29,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Bust a Move Bash or whatever.

972
01:02:30,244 --> 01:02:30,824
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a puzzle game.

973
01:02:30,965 --> 01:02:31,965
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't really innovate that much.

974
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:32,786
[SPEAKER_04]: But let me put it this way.

975
01:02:32,806 --> 01:02:34,527
[SPEAKER_04]: The screenshots don't show much detail.

976
01:02:36,807 --> 01:02:38,048
[SPEAKER_04]: There's probably a reason for that.

977
01:03:03,941 --> 01:03:32,278
[SPEAKER_05]: and the kiosks where you play the games on instead of there just being one there's a ton of them now they're opening one of these in San Jose and gosh part of me kind of wants to go down and check it out maybe do a report for the show because it's not that far and I go there a lot but anyhow apparently these places are going to have 24 networked gaming stations they're all going to have plasma display on it and they're supposed to be doing various competitions in these places most weekends are when they're supposed to be doing it they're going to kick it off with a Madden tournament

978
01:03:33,138 --> 01:03:40,383
[SPEAKER_05]: and the winner of the Madden Tournament gets a $1,000 GameStop shopping spree which they could spend right there in the store.

979
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:44,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't see how this is going to make them any money.

980
01:03:44,806 --> 01:03:48,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this like their idea of countering a LAN center?

981
01:03:49,449 --> 01:03:50,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the thing.

982
01:03:51,231 --> 01:04:00,597
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they're going to be countering LAN centers, but one of their competition chains that's kind of up and coming, they're starting to do this more, Play and Trade.

983
01:04:01,261 --> 01:04:02,901
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

984
01:04:27,028 --> 01:04:28,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I imagine they have to be.

985
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:36,859
[SPEAKER_05]: You pay like a $20, $30 entry fee, and if you get 50 people to enter it, there's your $1,000 prize right there, and anything additional is just extra money.

986
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:40,282
[SPEAKER_05]: And with a game like Madden that's so competitive... I don't know.

987
01:04:40,322 --> 01:04:44,507
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be tough, though, because I know like those other places, they don't charge...

988
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,141
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, for tournaments and stuff.

989
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:50,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, plus, you get all those gamers in one place and then what are you going to do?

990
01:04:50,044 --> 01:04:54,167
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to put out a table full of Madden merchandise out there for them to buy, right?

991
01:04:54,968 --> 01:05:01,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I can think of DDR tournaments I went to where Red Octane would come in and they would have a table because this was back before Red Octane was big for Guitar Hero.

992
01:05:01,994 --> 01:05:07,819
[SPEAKER_05]: They would come and they would sell dance pads and soundtracks and all the DDR crap there at the tournament.

993
01:05:08,219 --> 01:05:09,060
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how they made money.

994
01:05:10,021 --> 01:05:11,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Or at conventions, anime conventions.

995
01:05:11,622 --> 01:05:13,023
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really a good idea.

996
01:05:13,403 --> 01:05:14,044
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, honestly.

997
01:05:14,819 --> 01:05:17,221
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like selling t-shirts at a concert.

998
01:05:17,741 --> 01:05:18,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I suppose.

999
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:24,205
[SPEAKER_04]: So GS68, they've seen one at the San Tomas and Stevens Creek GameStop.

1000
01:05:24,285 --> 01:05:25,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I've shopped there before, by the way.

1001
01:05:26,146 --> 01:05:28,447
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually right next to my grand princess.

1002
01:05:28,808 --> 01:05:31,489
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

1003
01:05:33,731 --> 01:05:38,634
[SPEAKER_04]: The only reason why is I know a lot of people that own land centers and they own places like this where they ran out of time.

1004
01:05:38,654 --> 01:05:41,075
[SPEAKER_04]: And hell, we knew it was Arena.

1005
01:05:41,135 --> 01:05:42,696
[SPEAKER_04]: They used to have something similar like this.

1006
01:05:43,109 --> 01:05:44,569
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it will be.

1007
01:05:44,589 --> 01:05:44,929
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1008
01:05:44,949 --> 01:05:45,290
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1009
01:06:05,268 --> 01:06:06,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, let's move on with some more gaming news.

1010
01:06:07,089 --> 01:06:10,010
[SPEAKER_05]: If we have any listeners in San Jose who happen to check this place out, let us know.

1011
01:06:10,351 --> 01:06:13,152
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, I'll try to make it a point to go by there in the near future.

1012
01:06:13,172 --> 01:06:13,512
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1013
01:06:14,153 --> 01:06:20,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there are some details released about Tomb Raider Underworld that's being developed by Crystal Dynamics.

1014
01:06:21,616 --> 01:06:26,159
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be out next year on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1015
01:06:27,239 --> 01:06:34,423
[SPEAKER_03]: And is going to be... They were actually quoted in...

1016
01:06:36,601 --> 01:06:39,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Play Magazine is saying it was Pure Woman vs. Wild.

1017
01:06:41,323 --> 01:06:43,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really... I don't know.

1018
01:06:44,684 --> 01:06:46,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think there's way too many Tomb Raider games already.

1019
01:06:47,885 --> 01:06:55,348
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did think, though, that it's pretty cool that they have a new lighting model for what'll be going on in the game.

1020
01:06:55,648 --> 01:06:56,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's pretty cool.

1021
01:06:56,989 --> 01:07:05,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the more technical side of it, so I would check it out just to at least look at something online to see how it turns out

1022
01:07:08,486 --> 01:07:10,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Tomb Raider is one of those series that just won't die.

1023
01:07:11,548 --> 01:07:12,828
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is forced on to prove it.

1024
01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:16,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's another series.

1025
01:07:16,430 --> 01:07:20,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know if it's going to be a series, but maybe a game that should die.

1026
01:07:21,233 --> 01:07:25,175
[SPEAKER_04]: The Prince's Bride game, which doesn't look all that wonderful.

1027
01:07:25,195 --> 01:07:28,116
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it looks like, to be honest, like a CDI game.

1028
01:07:30,197 --> 01:07:37,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, according to a new G4 interview, they've gotten some information direct from the developer's mouths.

1029
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:45,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, well, the game itself, the target demographic, I believe, was women for it.

1030
01:07:46,588 --> 01:07:49,889
[SPEAKER_04]: They said that they're not going to be using a lot of the voice actors.

1031
01:07:49,969 --> 01:07:51,970
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually going to be sound-alikes for the voices.

1032
01:07:53,470 --> 01:08:01,773
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, they're saying that the game's going to be out spring of 2008 on PC.

1033
01:08:03,294 --> 01:08:06,675
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you'd like, you can pre-order it at the official site, princessbridegame.com.

1034
01:08:08,544 --> 01:08:09,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, the game doesn't look that good.

1035
01:08:10,805 --> 01:08:13,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked at that picture, it does look like a CDI game.

1036
01:08:14,686 --> 01:08:20,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they'd have to use, you know, soundalikes anyway, at least for some of them, because, you know, Andre the Giant's dead.

1037
01:08:22,129 --> 01:08:23,389
[SPEAKER_04]: They should make him talk anyways.

1038
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:28,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Splice clips together, like that one show after Chef left the show.

1039
01:08:29,011 --> 01:08:29,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

1040
01:08:30,071 --> 01:08:30,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind.

1041
01:08:31,352 --> 01:08:31,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

1042
01:08:32,674 --> 01:08:37,237
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to debut a brand new segment on tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1043
01:08:37,737 --> 01:08:48,082
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't say this is necessarily going to be a weekly segment, but it is going to be a segment that we're going to do on the show whenever something makes us feel like we need to do this segment.

1044
01:08:48,463 --> 01:08:49,603
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a new game.

1045
01:08:49,683 --> 01:08:53,685
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a new advice column or anything like that.

1046
01:08:53,786 --> 01:08:58,068
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it is something we call here at Orange Lounge Radio the Stupid Award.

1047
01:09:02,489 --> 01:09:13,761
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, whenever we here at Orange Lounge Radio feel like somebody has done something extraordinarily stupid this week in the gaming industry, we're going to award them with the OLR Stupid Award.

1048
01:09:15,884 --> 01:09:24,313
[SPEAKER_05]: So this week, the Stupid Award goes to this kid, and I'm probably going to mispronounce his name, but that's okay, he's stupid, Alyusha.

1049
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:26,201
[SPEAKER_05]: What did he do?

1050
01:09:26,701 --> 01:09:34,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he went on to Xbox Live and he was playing Call of Duty 4 and he sent messages to kids on Xbox Live.

1051
01:09:34,326 --> 01:09:41,130
[SPEAKER_05]: He was playing Call of Duty 4 and he told them that he was going to shoot up his school and tell everybody on there how he was going to do it.

1052
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:52,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, sure enough, a Call of Duty 4 player from Oregon went to the police department and Microsoft ended up letting out the IP who tracked down this guy and arrested him.

1053
01:09:54,272 --> 01:09:56,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the kid later admitted that the whole thing was just a joke.

1054
01:09:57,293 --> 01:09:59,453
[SPEAKER_05]: He had no intention of actually going through with it.

1055
01:09:59,673 --> 01:10:01,654
[SPEAKER_05]: There were no guns to be found or whatever.

1056
01:10:02,674 --> 01:10:06,074
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, why would you say this kind of crap on Xbox Live?

1057
01:10:07,035 --> 01:10:09,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially in this day and age, in the world we live in.

1058
01:10:10,095 --> 01:10:17,457
[SPEAKER_05]: So, congratulations, Alyusha, winner of the inaugural OLR Stupid Award!

1059
01:10:17,777 --> 01:10:18,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

1060
01:10:19,417 --> 01:10:19,877
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1061
01:10:24,102 --> 01:10:24,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of the gene pool.

1062
01:10:25,503 --> 01:10:25,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Get out.

1063
01:10:26,724 --> 01:10:27,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get a little bleach in there.

1064
01:10:28,405 --> 01:10:28,665
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1065
01:10:29,185 --> 01:10:36,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to a segment that we've done for a while now, and it's a well-loved segment here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1066
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:49,119
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the classic game of the week, and every week DarkSakura picks a favorite classic game of hers, and we basically pay tribute to our elders and respect them a little bit through our classic game of the week.

1067
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:53,742
[SPEAKER_05]: So DarkSakura, tell us about what game you picked out for us this week.

1068
01:10:54,992 --> 01:10:58,833
[SPEAKER_03]: The game of the week is the X-Men arcade game.

1069
01:10:59,274 --> 01:11:03,055
[SPEAKER_03]: The old one you could find either one screen or two screens.

1070
01:11:04,476 --> 01:11:07,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe that the differences were a four player and a six player.

1071
01:11:08,437 --> 01:11:13,179
[SPEAKER_03]: And I played the hell out of this game when I was in 10th grade.

1072
01:11:14,439 --> 01:11:18,221
[SPEAKER_03]: My arcade actually had the two screen setup.

1073
01:11:18,261 --> 01:11:20,162
[SPEAKER_03]: So you used to play a whole craplet of this.

1074
01:11:20,182 --> 01:11:21,302
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was put out by Konami.

1075
01:11:22,604 --> 01:11:34,093
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's the final fight style game, you know, the side-scrolling beat-crap-up game, you know, or like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games, even though a lot of these floating around that time.

1076
01:11:34,794 --> 01:11:41,859
[SPEAKER_03]: But you could play as Cyclops, Colossus, Wolverine, Storm, Nightcrawler, or Gavler, and I actually use Gavler almost all the time.

1077
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:47,784
[SPEAKER_03]: And you beat up the world's shortest Sentinels, because they're really supposed to be massive, but they were, like, little.

1078
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:57,106
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had the most, I swear, this would have all been candidates for English.com, the things that they would say in the game.

1079
01:11:58,467 --> 01:12:09,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I didn't realize this for quite a while, but the version that I played at one of the, not my main arcade, but the second arcade was actually a Japanese version.

1080
01:12:10,655 --> 01:12:17,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they would drop extra power-ups that would refill the power meter, and apparently the German one did not.

1081
01:12:18,706 --> 01:12:20,607
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, this is hard!

1082
01:12:21,568 --> 01:12:23,169
[SPEAKER_03]: It was too easy.

1083
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:28,873
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, but it was full of crap.

1084
01:12:29,093 --> 01:12:37,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was a really fun game, and I wish that there had been, um, you know, a home release list without me having to bust out the maze.

1085
01:12:38,959 --> 01:12:39,840
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was a lot of fun.

1086
01:12:41,687 --> 01:12:43,328
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, some comments from chatroom.

1087
01:12:43,348 --> 01:12:47,729
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw wants to remind us this was also the only X-Men game released by Konami.

1088
01:12:48,109 --> 01:12:50,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Hence why it feels so much like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

1089
01:12:50,891 --> 01:12:53,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's what I was saying, that it was in that type.

1090
01:12:55,272 --> 01:12:57,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Actdeft sounds like he has the best arcade ever.

1091
01:12:58,053 --> 01:13:02,195
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, my arcade used to have this, TMNT Arcade, and Turtles in Time.

1092
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:03,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Turtles in Time was freaking great.

1093
01:13:04,756 --> 01:13:07,837
[SPEAKER_03]: But this was my game before Turtles in Time.

1094
01:13:08,649 --> 01:13:11,811
[SPEAKER_05]: However, Dillinger would like to share that the Simpsons arcade game was better.

1095
01:13:12,371 --> 01:13:12,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I doubt.

1096
01:13:13,592 --> 01:13:14,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Simpsons did it.

1097
01:13:14,873 --> 01:13:17,815
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1098
01:13:17,915 --> 01:13:20,396
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually really liked this one a whole lot better.

1099
01:13:21,177 --> 01:13:25,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so there it is, your classic game of the week, X-Men, as done by the arcade.

1100
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:27,781
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just pausing our little YouTube-age of the game here.

1101
01:13:28,181 --> 01:13:30,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Bonus, you are granted a special mutant power.

1102
01:13:30,803 --> 01:13:35,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Note that mutant power can be used only when the energy indicator is at three or less.

1103
01:13:35,946 --> 01:13:37,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that like now a second mutation?

1104
01:13:38,817 --> 01:13:39,057
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1105
01:13:39,077 --> 01:13:40,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone who reads the comics.

1106
01:13:40,459 --> 01:13:40,759
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1107
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:44,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, that's going to bring this part A of our program to a close.

1108
01:13:44,963 --> 01:13:49,608
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take a quick break and we will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1109
01:13:50,309 --> 01:13:55,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1110
01:13:55,754 --> 01:14:00,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
