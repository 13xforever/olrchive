5888	14730	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15450	19131	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19731	21471	And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
21491	24212	We are live on this Sunday evening, December 2nd of 2007.
24312	25192	The year's almost up.
27136	28176	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
54858	56959	DivX Support, and Xvid Support.
57139	61903	So now we can play all the porn that we downloaded on our computers on our 360.
62563	63103	Hell yeah.
63644	67506	And then, of course, the Xbox Live Arcade hits.
68087	75391	Those are going to be reduced price games that basically have been released before, sold lots of copies, and now you can buy them cheaper.
76572	82056	I believe some of those Bankshot Billiards 2 is going to be like 800 points.
83516	84237	Luminous Live
84744	86725	The Marketplace is getting a whole facelift.
107154	109415	They're going to have things sorted completely differently.
109815	113176	In fact, they're going to also have... Are they going to make heads or tails of the movies on there?
113196	116737	Because trying to find movies right now is not easy.
116777	123218	I don't know about the movie stuff, but they're going to have this kind of thing where you can... I guess people are kind of calling it a cross-media bar.
123939	129060	It's ways of sorting the live marketplace stuff.
129080	132301	They have a whole section for free shit, so that's kind of cool.
133656	137059	Other things, Xbox Live Originals, of course, is coming up there.
137459	140822	The Parental Timer as well, Friends of Friends.
141722	144264	By the way, the Parental Timer made the front page of Yahoo today.
144284	145225	I don't know if you saw that.
145245	147046	I don't know if you visit Yahoo, but it's like my homepage.
147567	157054	So it comes up and, yeah, it was mentioning that, oh, the new Xbox will limit how much your kids can play games.
157074	158095	Kind of interesting.
158115	158515	Interesting.
159434	167660	The Friends of Friends functionality where you can actually say, for example, Rob, I have a lot of people that are probably on your friends list that I don't have friended to mine.
168120	173103	If you have that enabled, I can look at your friends list, see who's on, and add people off that.
173303	182349	Also, there's going to be a section where you can add a bio to your user tag where you can actually have a thousand words or whatever in there.
182959	188583	Um, there's also going to be a section where you put your real name and where you're located and stuff if you want to do that.
188603	189844	If I want people to know that about me.
190344	192065	Yeah, if you want people to know that about you.
192645	194947	Um, what else do they have in there?
195247	199390	I want to say I set that functionality to friends only earlier this week when the email went out.
199410	201071	I don't know, it's just a little weird.
202432	205714	So, when are they going to let you... They're trying to turn the Xbox into MySpace.
205754	207235	That's exactly what I was going to say.
207475	208856	In a way, well, I mean, it's smart.
208896	211858	They're capitalizing on that whole social networking phenomenon, but...
213854	215275	It's not my space.
216616	217076	It's really not.
217096	224500	Can I remake my profile to look god-awfully ugly in little flash graphics and web bling and glitter graphics?
225581	229223	I have a completely... Oh man, we should have brought that up during the break.
229403	229863	Never mind.
230043	231324	I'll bring it up maybe in Afterbirth.
232025	239869	Other things that they're changing too, they're going to add a new Xbox Live Blade where it's going to have RSS feeds.
240669	248075	including stuff from Major Nelson and other tidbits of information and or advertisements.
251178	251899	Let's see.
253760	255682	Yeah, I think that's pretty much it.
256102	259605	And, of course, this is all going to be available Tuesday.
261207	261447	Nice.
262888	267172	Yeah, Frisbee says in chat room, chat.orange.com, thanks for the ad.
268925	269545	What's up, sexy gal?
269585	270186	Yeah, I know.
270206	270826	What is it, the...
287728	294411	My Say Sexiest Person Alive Award Actually, if you really want to... Copy and paste this to ten people or else you'll be ugly tomorrow.
294451	300154	You know, if you do have the Xbox Live Vision camera, you can send wonderful pictures like that.
300194	306196	You may have to take a picture of your computer monitor or something like that with the image on there, but you could.
307057	310598	Or girls can just take pictures of their tits and guys can take pictures of their wangs.
310798	314280	I approve all pictures of women's tits sent to my...
315258	317360	Not all of them.
317520	319201	You'll redirect the wangs to your wife.
321163	325566	I'm just going to take a picture of someone pooing and be like, this is what I think of you.
326186	327047	Stop posting this crap.
327127	330369	Irene's going to send pictures of two girls, one cup to her whole friends list.
340884	343265	You can make that your icon, you know, using the vision camera.
343285	348669	You remember a while back when Microsoft was banning people for 24 hours for questionable bio lines?
349749	354532	I wonder if anybody's tried Two Girls, One Cup fan to see if that gets them banned.
356413	360196	I don't see why that would be offensive, just putting something like that.
361616	362937	Because it's not offensive.
362957	365239	Like, oh my god, you said Two Girls, One Cup.
365379	366820	Like, we ban you.
371080	375204	Anyhow, moving on to other things that will soon be on Xbox Live.
375304	376185	Bioshock!
376926	382672	We've all been waiting for some more content for the game Bioshock, and a patch is going to be coming out soon.
383292	386775	It's actually going to have downloadable content with the patch.
387676	389797	Actually, the patch is going to enable this downloadable content.
390177	394221	I assume, isn't the patch supposed to fix the widescreen thing too, or has that already been done?
394681	395522	No, it's going to do that.
395662	398044	I see, so that's the whole thing that this patch is fixing.
398704	405609	The new downloadable content will, I assume, be a new level or something, but they don't really say a lot about what it is.
405990	406790	Ooh, new plasmids.
407251	412915	New plasmids, and there's supposed to be a new difficulty in there that's going to disable the Vita Chambers.
413328	413588	Nice.
414688	416489	So that's pretty cool.
416569	418790	Guitar Hero 3 had a new download pack.
419610	422211	This time in the form of some indie love.
423832	428533	And included in there are three songs from artists you might not be familiar with.
429293	433615	Including you get The State of Massachusetts by Dropkick Murphys.
434095	434855	Pretty good punk band.
435776	439337	You Should Be Ashamed of Myself by The Bled.
440132	444134	and Memories of the Groove by Maylene and the Sons of Disasters.
446235	446676	You're fired, Loki.
469061	473203	I'm not listening to Orange Challenge Radio anymore.
473243	475725	You fired Loki.
475905	479988	He fired me for a better view of download content for Guitar Hero.
480088	480868	Oh my god.
481148	482689	Where's one up on my lawn?
486612	487853	I do love this show sometimes.
488253	490474	Other times it sucks.
491695	495878	Xbox Live Arcade is going to be getting a classic game
496832	499513	Actually, I thought we already had this game on Xbox Live.
499573	501653	Chess is going to be coming to Xbox Live.
501693	503014	Isn't that part of the Spyglass?
503234	504534	Yeah, Chess Master, though.
504614	510876	I know, it's Chess Master, specifically the Chess Master series, which was a huge series on PC, from what I remember.
510916	512696	Like, every year there was a new Chess Master game.
513276	515197	But all I know is that it isn't Battle Chess.
515717	517257	So for that, epic fail.
517758	518558	Or Battleship.
518938	520258	I want Battleship in life.
520498	522039	Battleship is kind of hokey.
522079	523299	Why are you beeping over there?
523655	528777	I'm not... My new phone is... Because someone sunk her battleship, apparently.
529297	531058	Yeah, Chess Master is going to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
531298	535120	Hopefully it's a little better and a little polished than the Spyglass thing was.
535660	539181	It's supposed to have lots of different AI opponents of varying difficulty.
539721	540102	We'll see.
540842	541902	Camera support as well.
542703	543223	So we'll see.
544903	548885	I would say, coming to Xbox Live Arcade very soon,
549542	551305	The Sensible World of Soccer
567378	569639	I don't know, soccer fans are pretty rowdy sometimes.
570279	571559	The game actually looked kind of fun.
571599	572319	I saw a trailer.
572420	573540	I never played this game.
573660	576401	As much of a Commodore fan as I was back in the day, I didn't have an Amiga.
576421	580362	I only ever had a Commodore 64, so I never really played this game.
580782	582482	Anyway, Sensible World of Soccer.
582683	587204	It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade on December 19th.
588064	588584	Wow.
588644	590045	So, hooray.
591205	591865	Be excited.
594086	594266	Hmm.
594716	595397	I don't know.
595737	596198	You know me.
596518	597199	Stupid American.
597519	598159	Don't like soccer.
598179	600442	DarkTetsuya says it looks like a Game Boy Color game.
601222	603945	It doesn't look like a Game Boy Color game, but it does look like a Super Nintendo game.
603965	605747	It's an older computer system, you know?
606067	606427	Hey, yeah.
606447	607749	It's supposed to look a little older.
609130	614155	Some of the games on live arcade look a little crappy because they're old 80s game ports.
614255	617018	But hey, it might play better than Pro Evo 2008.
617118	619140	Well, yeah, because it's sensible.
620140	621660	Xbox 360 Backwards Compatibility Update
639807	641227	that are backwards compatible.
642068	663935	Some of the highlights of games that are now in there, Blitz the League, Blood Omen 2, Burnout 2, Point of Impact, Fight Night Round 3, Forgotten Realms, Demon's Stone, Freedom Fighters, a lot of sports games like MVP Baseball, 03, 04, 05, NCAA March Madness, 05, 06,
667094	674498	A lot of NHL games, 2K3, 205, 2K... 2K3's on there twice, I think they cheated.
675698	676759	NHL 2K3.
677579	679960	Oh, there's NFL and NHL, my bad, one letter off.
680020	681021	Playboy The Mansion!
681761	683542	I'm sure a lot of folks are looking forward to that.
683862	687023	Here's the one game on the entire list that I actually own for whatever reason.
687364	691405	Tecmo Classic Arcade is now backwards compatible as well.
692526	694727	I know Loki owns this game, this is worth noting.
695185	697566	The Guy Game, Worms 3D, Not Playable Still, Good Games, Rising,
717182	720584	Dance Dance Revolution series, still not playable, backwards compatible.
720824	723446	Wow, I should be clamoring to get an Xbox 360.
723486	728589	Beyond Good and Evil, I think.
729049	735473	One interesting thing, the Xbox Live video marketplace is going to be coming to Europe pretty soon.
735954	739956	And this is actually coming from one of those prepaid cards.
740316	743638	Apparently, written on the back in very small print, said...
744898	751400	You can access the Xbox Live video marketplace available in the UK, Ireland, France, and Germany.
752100	757721	So apparently this hasn't happened soon, but the cards, being already printed, have that information on there.
757881	767004	So soon you will be able to watch videos and enjoy all the rest of the download content that we have around the world.
769124	769824	Be excited.
771545	771945	I'm not.
772830	788478	I don't know if you saw this hit the internet earlier this week, but there was a video that went out on the internet that... It was kind of a social experiment, I guess you could call it, where a guy whose nickname was XGayboyX signed on to Halo 3.
788518	789518	Triple X, Gayboy.
789558	790659	Was it Triple X, GayboyX?
790679	791139	Sorry about that.
791519	797282	He signed on to Halo 3 and basically got all these people to say, really, now...
798493	799313	We'll see you next time.
819722	820863	Whatever.
820903	832011	Hey, what's up, gay boy?
832031	835813	We should hook up.
836174	836974	I'm Friendly Uncle.
837374	839516	Gay boy and Friendly Uncle coming at ya.
840336	842818	Something that should be noted, because you notice, like, that isn't so bad.
842878	846661	There are a few things in here that are not necessarily negative.
847221	848242	For instance, you know, but
848735	856280	Who knows if it's somebody... You know how, like, sometimes jocks in high school would befriend the nerds on a dare type thing?
856340	857921	You don't know if maybe it's something like that.
857961	858441	But I doubt it.
858481	859262	It seems pretty genuine.
860062	860763	One, two, punch.
861203	862784	I hope gay marriage never gets passed.
863244	864265	Have fun being single.
865586	869448	And make it say, single boy.
869949	870649	Shut the fuck up.
871009	871890	You're still a faggot.
872871	875772	Well, it doesn't matter, dude, because... I'm sorry, you're not a faggot.
875793	877093	You give a bad name to gays.
877614	877874	You're...
878863	880024	A fucking nuke!
881564	882164	You're a niggit!
882264	883025	Don't worry, guys.
883445	883985	Ah, there you go.
884585	885226	That's enough.
885246	885406	Wow.
885706	893369	If I hadn't already heard all this stuff before in games, like, I'd probably be a little more shocked, but that's still very perturbing.
893409	895190	It's really, like, I don't know.
896331	898012	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
924176	939641	I mean, in a way, and I'm a little bit torn, because yes, I think these people are really fucked up, and yes, I think it's fucking sad that there's ignorant people like that out there, but at the same time, it's a little bit entrapment or provoking it when the guy goes on there with a name like Gay Boy.
940321	941862	But I don't see it that way.
941962	945683	Why does it have to be seen as entrapment if you have a name like Gay Boy?
945703	946703	How about Hetero Boy?
946723	949764	I would be interested to see what Hetero Boy would
950652	952934	Yeah, like, that's dumb.
953455	953855	I don't know.
954316	956958	Like, on the one hand, I'm infuriated.
957018	960041	I'm kind of, like, livid that people would say that kind of stuff.
960101	961863	Or I heart Jesus or something like that.
962363	966768	Yeah, but at the same time, it's just kind of like, well, you know, successful.
967281	968042	That was funny, though.
968082	971064	This is why I only like to play with friends and OLR listeners.
971284	977789	I want to say, like, Fox News or somebody ran some sort of report on this, and they were talking about, like... I saw that, about the trash talk.
977829	979551	Yeah, there's some other YouTube out there.
979571	981052	Yeah, Fox just did a report this week.
981332	981752	I saw that.
981832	985655	And the whole thing was, like, they're all, you know, are you guys surprised that this is on there?
985695	987057	And they're like, no.
987337	991180	And then, like, I remember reading some comments on that, and they're like, yeah, of course they're not surprised.
991200	993181	They're the ones fucking saying that shit.
993201	995944	They're interviewing, like, 12-year-olds and stuff, 13-year-olds.
997927	1002549	Now, the reason why I want to bring this up is that, you know, obviously these things make their way around the Internet.
1002609	1013153	And if anybody, Microsoft has proven they're very good about kind of staying on top of the Internet buzz and trying to thwomp this mob mentality when they see it.
1013513	1023682	And, you know, one of their representatives, Trixie, was actually posting on the GayGamer.net blog post where this showed up and just trying to kind of, you know, say, hey, I think these guys are assholes too.
1024263	1027646	And when you see this happen, report it because we do follow up on that shit.
1027966	1029968	And Major Nelson basically kind of says the same thing.
1029988	1034912	Major Nelson posts about it in his blog and says, I just watched or listened to the video you posted on your site.
1034932	1037655	This is what he wrote back to GayGamer.net who posted the original thing.
1038055	1041098	Needless to say, it was disappointing to see how some Xbox Live members behaved.
1041478	1043540	As you know, that's not the type of behavior we support.
1043580	1046803	With over 8 million members, it's unfortunate that some members decide to act like this.
1047343	1051867	I want to point out a few things that all Xbox Live members can do to ensure an enjoyable experience.
1052228	1058033	And reiterates, you know, you can turn off voice from people that aren't your friends, only play with friends, file complaints.
1058133	1063037	And he reiterates, we do act on complaints, so I highly encourage people to file complaints where appropriate.
1063840	1064260	And you know what?
1064360	1064880	I do that.
1065261	1074544	When I play on Xbox Live, if somebody is, like, being annoying, because some people will get, I swear to God, you'll get on Halo 3 and you'll get into some matches and somebody will be doing this the whole time.
1075484	1079186	Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
1084685	1090030	I swear to God, for the entire match, somebody did that to me once.
1091191	1095294	That's kind of funny, but then if I ever met that person in real life, I'd punch him.
1095314	1099318	I muted the little fucker, finally, so he was just sitting there by himself.
1100719	1103522	Maybe he had a mental problem, I don't know.
1103542	1105323	That's what I was going to say, maybe he had a headache.
1105443	1108426	I don't think the mental problem was that severe because he was kicking my ass in Halo.
1110103	1113464	The other, well, maybe he's like Rain Man or something.
1113744	1117745	He's really good at Halo, but he just says, meh, meh, meh, meh, a lot.
1117845	1121326	You know, like, that could be his thing, but, yeah.
1122507	1125807	So what I did, I muted him, and then I rated the fucker down.
1126048	1127468	You go into the little thing, and you can rate.
1128028	1130929	And you know how, like, everybody on Xbox Live has a five-star rating?
1131812	1133373	Well, not if you play with me in Halo 3.
1133733	1137814	I'll rate you down so fast if you get on there and say something nasty.
1137914	1145217	And I had somebody get on there going, you know, n-word, n-word, n-word over and over and I reported it as abuse.
1146057	1147258	That's just disgusting.
1147378	1148938	Like, it's gross.
1148978	1149839	It's like, why do you have to say that?
1149859	1155061	Because Mommy and Daddy aren't looking and they're acting out to make themselves feel better about themselves.
1155081	1161123	Because Mommy and Daddy bought them an M-rated game and obviously aren't paying attention to what they do and they'll pay for their damn live account because
1161547	1165912	Give Mommy and Daddy a few moments to breathe and make more babies.
1166432	1166613	Yep.
1167494	1168715	Frisbee brings up a good point.
1168795	1169396	Is he a cat?
1171709	1174430	Oh God, I hope I wasn't getting my ass kicked by a cat.
1174831	1175871	Laser cat.
1175911	1177131	That would be kind of sad.
1177171	1179132	I think I'd have to quit video gaming forever.
1179212	1180453	Man, that must be a stupid cat.
1180753	1182513	Meow, meow, meow, meow.
1183414	1184674	You can't even meow right.
1184754	1185634	Shut up, cat.
1186755	1187475	I'm muting you.
1187635	1190336	Hey, my cat couldn't meow right for a while.
1190476	1191757	It took her time to figure it out.
1191777	1193737	I know, I really had to restrain myself from meowing.
1193817	1196438	Stupid faggot cat, stop meowing so fucking much.
1196458	1198039	N-word, N-word cat, jeez.
1199884	1201565	Black Cat, what's that, huh?
1204547	1205948	That's terrible.
1205968	1207569	Sephiroth1215 says something else really good.
1207969	1209010	Listen to these people, though.
1209030	1210691	They're not really 12 and 13.
1210771	1212332	These people are usually in their 20s.
1212792	1216015	Yeah, those people did sound a little bit older, but they sounded like hicks, too.
1216175	1218096	They sounded like frat boys in a dorm room.
1219617	1220397	Gay boy.
1222038	1222399	Look at this.
1222539	1224020	I just totally told this guy.
1224400	1225881	Man, I'm awesome.
1226587	1227548	Doyle Rules!
1227868	1230230	See, and they all have lame nicknames too.
1230290	1233932	It's usually like, oh, Halo Lover and stuff like that.
1233992	1235793	Or like, I love unicorns or something.
1235833	1237935	Like, how could you make fun of a name gay boy?
1237955	1239056	Master Chief is my butt buddy.
1239256	1240076	Exactly!
1240216	1241337	Like, and he really is.
1241737	1244019	Like, they're stupid.
1244039	1245820	They can't think of anything more creative.
1246020	1251504	Like, a more creative way to make fun of someone instead of gay boy.
1251624	1252465	Oh, you're gay.
1252865	1253886	And you're a boy.
1254066	1254206	Like,
1254960	1255600	That's stupid.
1255820	1263044	But it's just, the parts of it that are really significant to me is that people will suddenly jump on there and then they'll be like, I hope gay marriage is banned forever and you're single forever.
1263084	1263825	It's like, dude.
1264345	1264885	Like, wow.
1265106	1267907	It's just some guy on the internet playing Halo.
1267947	1269728	Oh, that hurt my ego.
1269748	1272009	I can't fight back in Halo now.
1273850	1274431	Oh, man.
1275451	1276192	What am I to do?
1276212	1278233	I don't know.
1278253	1281535	But then Nintendo looks at this shit and goes, that's why we've got friend codes.
1283672	1284953	Oh, Nintendo's so smart.
1285713	1286334	I don't know about that.
1286534	1286834	Anyhow.
1287194	1288395	Kicking you, kicking you.
1288415	1290537	So, even more ridiculous news here.
1290737	1302805	Apparently, there is a guy filing a class action lawsuit because he believes that Microsoft created defective copies of Halo 3 that are causing Xbox 360s to blow up everywhere.
1305446	1306667	No, that wasn't Microsoft.
1306687	1307187	That was me.
1307268	1312031	Anyways, apparently this guy out of San Diego, Randy Nunes, is...
1313061	1317504	Going ahead with a lawsuit against them.
1317544	1326369	Apparently, he purchased a copy of Halo 3 from GameStop and was plagued by system lockups and freezes and crashes when he tried to play it.
1326669	1328210	Well, where's the explosions?
1329631	1331352	I was being sarcastic!
1331432	1336455	If you blow up the 360, I'm thinking I put Halo, close it, and then suddenly, tick, tick, tick, BOOM!
1337216	1338096	Sarcasm, okay.
1338256	1339317	I'd be actually kind of rad.
1340180	1341001	I'd buy another one.
1341101	1342103	I would not.
1343004	1347790	Did he try a different copy of the game, return a defective one, the game stopped for replacement?
1349993	1350754	The story doesn't say.
1351294	1352376	No, he was using a 360.
1354158	1354939	But here's the thing, though.
1355239	1355480	I mean...
1356764	1363408	This is a bunch of bullshit anyways, because I remember this story came out before that, oh, maybe Halo's breaking systems.
1363508	1366970	No, actually it's because you're playing the game so much that your system's overheating.
1367411	1371953	If you happen to have that overheating problem, then you get three rings of death or whatever.
1373074	1373775	It's stupid.
1374115	1377157	And the fact that this guy's getting sued for this shit, I hope he fails.
1377637	1380759	But, you know, unfortunately nowadays a lot of times these people succeed.
1381740	1385482	And of course, whenever we hear about the frivolous lawsuits, we get a little bit angsty.
1386151	1389721	and nothing inspires our next segment like frivolous lawsuits.
1389801	1392108	It's time to bring on the FUs of the week.
1407717	1425965	Hey, I guess I would say this is a pre-FU for my work review that's going to be this week, which I'm demanding a raise, which I'm sure I will not get, but I haven't gotten one in three years, and I'm well deserving of one, since I have four times the accounts that certain other sales reps do at my company.
1427326	1432328	So, basically, my whole thing is I'm going to go in there and just say, okay, am I getting a review or not?
1432388	1434529	And if I'm not, then I'm going to be a complete asshole.
1434769	1435189	You should.
1435769	1436750	So, fuck you...
1437745	1442888	Stupid managers at my work that aren't, you know, willing to pay me a decent salary.
1442929	1444209	I'm already underpaid as it is.
1444269	1447271	If I get a fucking raise, then I'll be just slightly less underpaid.
1450433	1451094	I'll go next.
1451194	1453856	My FU of the week goes to the fact that I don't own a house.
1454176	1455297	I rent, but I don't own.
1456117	1458339	Because I went to a party last night with William.
1458379	1461461	These guys own this house, and it was just beautiful what they'd done with it.
1461501	1463302	The backyard was all, like...
1463792	1465013	FU to cats that can't meow properly.
1465093	1466054	They need to, uh... Meow meow meow meow!
1491175	1492036	Shut up, cat!
1493757	1494717	Yeah, that's it.
1496578	1496938	All right.
1497919	1499400	That does it for the FUs of the week.
1500000	1500981	That was really short.
1501241	1501601	Wow.
1501901	1504262	Usually there's a lot of angst built up for this.
1504502	1506403	It's because we stopped reading chat FUs.
1506424	1507864	In the same way, it got a lot shorter.
1507964	1510346	Wow, that lasted like a minute and a half.
1512007	1515829	Black Labs in chat says, An internet radio will not be getting you a house, Rob.
1516689	1518470	Truer words have not been spoken.
1518970	1519711	Wait a minute, what?
1519751	1519851	What?
1520595	1520795	What?
1520855	1521655	Nonbeliever.
1523576	1523856	What?
1523936	1524377	Where's that?
1524457	1525617	Is that a chat name or something?
1526077	1526237	No.
1526798	1529239	And internet radio will not be getting you a house, Rob.
1529399	1529619	Yeah.
1529959	1530859	So you think.
1531780	1532620	You don't know.
1533040	1533321	Rob.
1533361	1533701	Geez.
1533761	1534001	What?
1534541	1534981	I have to.
1535161	1536582	No, Eidos is building me a house.
1537082	1538803	I have to divert our attention real quick.
1538903	1540844	There's the last minute story.
1541124	1542444	And I need you to pull this up.
1542805	1544605	Gamersreports.com.
1545586	1546506	This better be good.
1546526	1548287	Has a brand new trailer.
1549687	1552429	for... for... Africa.
1553430	1554811	GamersReports.com?
1554831	1557894	Yeah, Gamers with an S, Reports.com.
1557934	1558174	Aha!
1559015	1559195	Oh!
1559495	1560096	New Africa.
1560156	1562057	A new Africa trailer for the PS3.
1562338	1563358	I think we should watch.
1563639	1565500	Is this real or is this something to be seen?
1565600	1567962	No, it's real.
1568002	1568503	Oh, okay.
1568583	1569584	And it has a song.
1569664	1569884	Oh, shit!
1569964	1570364	Oh, shit!
1583500	1586262	I want to know what is worthy about interrupting the show with this.
1586302	1587463	I don't know.
1587543	1588904	I just... I forgot.
1589184	1591006	Do we get to find out what the hell you do in this game?
1591286	1591906	I don't know.
1592086	1595389	I didn't watch the whole trailer.
1597110	1598952	I see dudes riding a jeep.
1599112	1599632	I don't know.
1608433	1609614	There's a retarded cat.
1609694	1612415	No, I'm just kidding.
1613576	1616437	So basically there's just a bunch of animals walking around.
1616477	1617277	You know what?
1617357	1618698	It looks gorgeous.
1618778	1621199	I mean, this is something I'm sure that's going to really show off.
1621359	1624001	Can I fast forward a little bit?
1624121	1626782	Hopefully see if we get to the part where the animals get shot.
1626822	1627802	Hyena, the unicorn.
1633462	1634983	Where's the fucking game?
1635683	1637444	Where's the fucking dysentery?
1638444	1641185	Goddammit, this is the most boring game ever.
1641205	1643725	Oh, hey!
1643826	1645166	Oh, the hippo is saying hi.
1645206	1645946	Yeah, like...
1649068	1651789	Thank you for watching!
1669038	1676024	It makes me think it's Jumbo Safari, like every time I see it and I see the little... I want to be able to hit all the animals with that jeep.
1676104	1678066	That is the only way I'm buying that game.
1678086	1679267	Are you going to summon the jeep?
1680508	1683090	Loki, goddammit, that wasn't worth stopping the show for.
1683310	1685092	Sorry, it's Africa.
1685412	1686233	I mean, I had to.
1687435	1688735	Wow, that's... It could be interesting.
1688755	1689055	You know what?
1689135	1691356	I'm all about games that are outside the box.
1691496	1694496	I just kind of want to know, like, what's the catch with Africa.
1694516	1695276	That's all I want to know.
1695516	1696057	You know what it is?
1696077	1696597	What's the catch?
1696617	1698077	It's going to be like Manhunt.
1698117	1700157	You get to kill the animals in, like, crazy ways.
1700177	1701397	No, no, I doubt it.
1701818	1707479	No, you take, like, a, you know... I think it's some type of exploration game, but I want to know, like, what it is.
1708619	1709099	Interesting.
1709319	1709899	Yeah.
1709919	1713420	Yeah, well, stay tuned for more information about Africa.
1713440	1714080	Yeah, right.
1714200	1715460	In six months.
1716328	1717208	Woop-dee-doo.
1717548	1719509	Man, I'm waiting in eager anticipation for that time.
1719529	1723749	Metal Gear Solid V. Let's move on to the gaming news, shall we?
1724310	1731751	And, you know, here on Orange Dawn Radio, we like to talk about the current systems and everything the kids are playing, so that's why this next article is about the Commodore 64.
1731911	1732431	Whoa!
1733351	1733911	Radical!
1734231	1741753	And, yes, on the Commodore 64, somebody, with a lot of free time, has managed to make a Guitar Hero 3D.
1742273	1744254	Clone type thing for the Commodore 64.
1744334	1746035	Now, I shouldn't say it's a full game yet.
1746415	1747896	It's still in its concept stages.
1747956	1750097	But it's called Shreds 64.
1750998	1757041	And what they did is they took their PlayStation 2 guitar and basically adapted it so that it can be read in the joystick ports.
1757541	1761784	And, yeah, now they've made it so that, you know, the notes fall and it reads the guitar.
1762204	1765586	And they have what's called the Shredocity and the Applause.
1765646	1770288	And the Applause is basically the meter, you know, how well you're doing just looking in the game.
1770308	1771449	And I guess Shredocity is...
1772930	1773490	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1804067	1804668	Still kind of cool.
1805668	1806089	I like it.
1806249	1807669	I approve of this project.
1807729	1808230	Me too.
1808310	1808750	Thumbs up.
1809530	1815474	Anyway, I'm disappointed to see that we don't have a Dreamcast game yet of Guitar Hero or something like that.
1816394	1822137	Because, you know, the Dreamcast has tons of games coming out for some reason, even though... Sure enough.
1823458	1827480	Anyways, another mod also kind of dealing with a music game.
1828101	1828601	Rock Band.
1828801	1830202	As you remember me complaining about
1830779	1837583	The drums and how loud they were, apparently a lot of people were looking for homebrew ways of making them quieter.
1838043	1847088	And there's a couple different methods that you can use out there, one of which is self-adhesive rubber and self-adhesive colored felt.
1847648	1849329	And you basically shove that on there.
1849750	1851551	Why does it have to be colored felt?
1852251	1857474	Just so that you know which color, because if you're covering the whole drum, you're not going to know what color is what.
1858700	1859381	You don't have to.
1859441	1861442	You can do all black if you're emo like that.
1862063	1862924	Maybe I am.
1863464	1864145	So whatever.
1864245	1866386	But there's another one I saw also.
1866447	1871791	There was a rubber mouse pad, and you glue that on there.
1872792	1877216	Apparently, though, it works pretty well in reducing the sound, I guess, by 70%.
1877276	1880438	Well, there you go.
1880498	1882440	Maybe the wife will let you play if you can reduce the sound.
1883884	1890147	Oh, by the way, she bought Rock Band for me, or she gave me a check for it because I paid with it, my money.
1890328	1897151	But she only paid for $100 of it because she says that the remainder of the money would have been for the drum kit, and she's not supporting the drum kit.
1897171	1899692	That's awesome.
1900153	1901253	Your wife is hilarious.
1903674	1904995	Tell her we need to, I'm going to take her out.
1905015	1906756	We're going to go to Olive Garden, have a fancy dinner.
1907817	1908237	All right.
1908337	1909397	Happy Olive Garden.
1910238	1911598	I'll take her to Red Lobster if she wants.
1911839	1912539	Spare no expense.
1914124	1915485	BSG Something's getting postponed.
1915605	1916747	It might even be altogether cancelled.
1938911	1939051	What?
1939071	1940172	Because of this damn strike.
1940252	1940672	Yeah.
1940692	1942173	They can't cancel Battlestar Galactica.
1942193	1942673	They can.
1942693	1943834	They sure as shit can.
1943894	1944435	Rawr.
1945375	1947136	Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
1947156	1951139	To be honest with Heroes, man, I think that's actually kind of good for them.
1951259	1954081	No, I think Heroes has been just fine this season.
1954861	1957203	It just was slow to develop, like the first season.
1957523	1959024	But the past few episodes have been amazing.
1959064	1959404	It's all right.
1959724	1960725	And Elle is awesome.
1962026	1964227	I swear to God, if they kill her off Monday, I'm going to be so pissed.
1964287	1964507	Anyway...
1966778	1968419	What?
1968439	1970321	I said two of them are supposed to die.
1971081	1971842	Don't remind me.
1971922	1972322	M&L, probably.
1972702	1973062	No!
1974383	1976305	Riders Strike is going on.
1976405	1980648	Well, one thing that they are not striking against is video games.
1981308	1986612	And the Riders Guild is allowed to write for video games currently while this strike is going on.
1987152	1989454	So, something to think about.
1990149	1990209	E.A.
1990229	1991470	did for their European ad campaign.
2017912	2022413	were these two sexy models that were naked to promote the game.
2023374	2024054	I approve.
2024254	2030636	Okay, did you guys see the new Wii commercial for... What game was it?
2031056	2040438	Where they're kind of, like, sort of parodying Fast Times at Ridgemont High where the girl's coming out of the pool and they're, like, in bikinis.
2041159	2042339	What game was it promoting?
2042399	2046000	I don't know, but, like, Nintendo's using sex to sell, like...
2046593	2047874	What's going on here?
2048014	2049114	Wholesome Nintendo?
2049874	2051075	Putting girls in bikinis?
2051255	2053195	Maybe they finally figured out that sex sells?
2053275	2053636	I don't know.
2053956	2055096	Girls in bikinis?
2055456	2056837	Yeah, they're like two girls.
2057377	2058577	I don't remember what game it was.
2058617	2059738	It was a competitive game.
2060778	2062579	Because there was like four people in the room.
2063139	2063899	Damn it, I don't remember.
2063919	2064840	Gosh, you're so good at this.
2064860	2065180	Smarty Pants?
2065220	2066020	Shut up.
2066120	2066280	What?
2066640	2067681	Like Smarty Pants?
2067801	2068141	No.
2068741	2069201	No way.
2069281	2070082	Are you talking to me?
2070102	2071002	Maybe it's seen it.
2071562	2072343	No, it's not seen it.
2072423	2073403	No, it was like...
2076383	2078704	And it was a game that I didn't know.
2078804	2080866	The chat is saying Smackdown vs. Raw 08.
2080966	2082787	Oh, maybe that's what it was, yeah.
2082827	2084448	And they say it's the publisher, not Nintendo.
2084608	2086109	Yeah, that would be a third-party publisher.
2086269	2087369	Okay, yeah.
2087689	2088770	That's like, I guess.
2088790	2091071	Mario Galaxy, now with more nipples.
2091812	2093433	Hot.
2093713	2094093	Awesome.
2095574	2097315	You should replace the stars with boobies.
2097825	2099648	Thank you for watching!
2115384	2119066	I don't know if you've ever seen this game, the Nuts and Milk, which is a Japanese game.
2120807	2122067	Yeah, Nuts and Milk.
2122128	2126270	Somebody turned the game into just nuts, and you were a little wandering penis.
2127090	2129892	I mean, people do the stupidest stuff.
2130132	2132173	That's great.
2132253	2136655	If Irene ruled the world, even the next-gen games, you're going to collect boobies.
2137035	2138256	Yeah, and pandas.
2139170	2139891	Mostly boobies.
2139991	2141832	Boobies and pandas, the game.
2141892	2142212	Great.
2142653	2147677	So we have Loki's World of Randomness, and Rice Princess presents Boobies and Pandas.
2148857	2150639	Yeah, it sounds like a good idea.
2150659	2151059	No, I need a game.
2151079	2152820	What about you, Rob?
2152840	2153381	What do you make?
2153521	2153961	I don't know.
2154502	2155803	I'll think about a game a little later.
2157564	2161527	AJ Mix in chat says, ET the Extra Testicle.
2163669	2164189	Brilliant testicle.
2165638	2166819	Oh my god, and you know what?
2166879	2170461	It could be a penis that, like, gets erect so he can get out of the pit.
2170902	2175205	Because remember how you had to, like, extend his neck to get out?
2175805	2177486	You are so stupid.
2177847	2179128	You're stupid.
2179148	2182990	It's like, wait a minute, better watch some porn.
2183150	2183811	Boop!
2184451	2185232	And, like, it'll, like...
2185578	2188940	DrewNami wants to remind us about Magic Penjel, where we already did all of this.
2189900	2191821	Oh yeah, I remember that game.
2191921	2194762	Boy, Magic Penjel gets brought up at least once a month on this program.
2194822	2204947	You know what, we need to go back and play Graffiti Kingdom, where it's basically like a Zelda-type game, but you can draw your own characters, so you could do...
2205837	2206618	All of that stuff.
2207278	2208439	Panda Boob Man!
2208519	2211161	Boobies and pandas can actually be a reality?
2211221	2212141	It can be a reality.
2212261	2214243	Oh my god, I'm so there.
2214463	2218065	Or, you can get drawn to life, which you can do the same thing, just in 2D.
2219046	2221288	You can make your enemies, you know, where it's giant pieces.
2221308	2222729	Just flat boobies and pandas.
2224009	2224510	Boring.
2224570	2225070	Anyhow.
2225170	2228332	If I wanted flat boobies, I'd go to Africa.
2228352	2229974	What? !
2231812	2237437	I don't know, because every time they show the National Geographic ladies with their boobies, they're like flat and long.
2237457	2238198	Not always.
2238778	2239339	Most of the time.
2239359	2240960	I've seen some big boobies.
2240980	2241981	In National Geographic.
2242081	2244884	I know, I'm like, this conversation is not going to a happy place.
2246525	2246946	It's true.
2247306	2251650	So let's talk about toys and children's toys.
2252131	2252411	Okay.
2252431	2252511	Okay.
2253203	2256125	and that, you know, like all these toys have been getting recalled this year.
2256205	2258146	Like the, what was the, oh God, what was that?
2258166	2262128	The dots thing that had a date rape drug in it apparently.
2262509	2262709	Oh my God.
2262729	2262929	No, no.
2263209	2266951	It was something you could use as an ingredient in creating the date rape drug.
2266971	2267551	Oh, if you eat it.
2267571	2268632	No, if you eat it, it has the same effect.
2268652	2269052	Oh, if you eat it.
2269072	2269312	That's right.
2269333	2269893	It has the same effect.
2269913	2270473	What was that called?
2270493	2271594	The dots or whatever?
2272674	2273495	We need to get a bunch of that.
2273515	2274115	What the hell was it?
2274195	2274375	Why?
2274415	2275136	You just want to eat it.
2275666	2276307	I don't want to eat it.
2276507	2278048	I want to make dot creations.
2278468	2280390	You want to make the cat eat it and see what happens.
2280450	2281291	Oh, no, I wouldn't.
2281391	2282952	I wouldn't make sure Kitty eat that.
2283252	2283753	That's mean.
2284193	2284533	No, it is mean.
2284553	2287255	The cat would go, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma.
2288537	2291079	Yeah, that's... Aquadots.
2291179	2292380	Thank you, Raven's Dolphin.
2292620	2294141	Aquadots is what they were called.
2294621	2295162	Well, anyhow...
2296481	2311649	According to a recent article in the Los Angeles Times, apparently because of all these recalls, apparently game publishers are seeing a 19% increase in sales because I guess games are safe and they're not going to try to drug your children as you are aware.
2311669	2314411	They'll just show them pictures of murder and everything like that.
2315011	2317012	Pictures of murder, yes.
2317052	2318393	Murder!
2318413	2321154	Do you remember Manhunt 2 is murder?
2321755	2322475	Murder Sims?
2323616	2323896	Anyhow.
2324807	2327008	Listen, we don't need to give Manhunt 2 any more press.
2327068	2328789	I mean, the game's not that good.
2329569	2338573	Anyway, this is coming from a quote from Jarek Johnson, who's an analyst from Capital Market, says, There's definitely money leaving the toy sector.
2338673	2343015	It's logical to assume that video games might be viewed by some parents as an alternative.
2343495	2344716	He's an analyst.
2347197	2349237	Why you gotta take this show to the toilet, Rice Princess?
2349798	2350218	I don't know.
2351173	2351793	Anyhow.
2352054	2352494	Anyways.
2352514	2353474	Just an impulse.
2354235	2354835	Yeah.
2355755	2356796	This picture's naughty.
2357116	2357496	Anyways.
2358977	2359237	Sorry.
2359557	2361538	What are you doing over there on your laptop?
2361678	2363879	You don't have to announce it on the show.
2364279	2366060	Yeah, this picture's naughty.
2366160	2367361	Oh, yeah, that's real butter.
2369001	2370622	No, anyways.
2371342	2372843	Completely off topic here.
2372923	2374664	Space Invaders Extreme.
2375149	2378951	is being released for the Nintendo DS in Japan.
2379291	2380792	And why should I even mention this?
2380852	2383253	Because, you know, hey, it's Space Invaders and it's a remake.
2383733	2384613	It actually looks pretty cool.
2384693	2388015	It kind of incorporates music a little bit to it.
2388035	2391717	And they have a YouTube video on Joystick right now worth checking out.
2392097	2399620	And it reminds me a lot of Rez or even like Luminous a little bit.
2400081	2400541	Really?
2400641	2402282	Yeah, it's really cool looking, actually.
2402302	2402682	Hmm.
2404255	2407316	So, you know, if it comes out over here, I'm definitely going to have to check it out.
2407837	2411118	But, you know, it kind of changes a little bit of the pace at the end of the game and stuff.
2411138	2412539	They have power-ups and stuff you can get.
2412919	2417261	But, you know, each ship that you blow up kind of adds beats to the music and stuff.
2417461	2418081	So it's pretty cool.
2418441	2420922	It's got a little, like, trippy background and stuff, too.
2421122	2427465	Is it based on also the BPM, kind of like how they did on VibRibbon, like the speed of the stuff coming towards you?
2427505	2429826	I don't know about that, but it just looks really cool, though.
2430266	2431507	That would be cool.
2431527	2431647	Mm-hmm.
2433788	2433908	Yeah.
2434873	2435253	All right.
2436274	2439795	Well, let's go ahead and move on to our mailbag segment.
2439815	2440135	That's right.
2440175	2443196	Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeonstrater.com.
2443396	2445797	We're going to open up the mailbag and choose a few of our favorites.
2446137	2449639	Since DarkSakura is not here this week, I will be doing the honors, whether you like it or not.
2451780	2452980	I am here.
2453480	2453760	Too bad.
2456221	2461483	Email number one this week comes to us from... I don't know.
2461503	2462204	They didn't sign it.
2462504	2462604	Um...
2464360	2470643	We're going to say this is from Richard M. Says, alright, I'm listening right now.
2470703	2472303	Apparently this person is listening to the show right now.
2472644	2474765	I'm playing Halo 3 and blah blah blah.
2474825	2477346	I just wanted to say hi because I haven't listened for about four weeks.
2477806	2482808	I just got an Xbox 360 and Xbox Live and I sent a request to you two, Sky and Loki and DarkSakura.
2483248	2484749	Who's not there right now, but let her know.
2485390	2487890	We'll do, but I'm sure she'll see the friends request when she logs in next.
2488291	2491191	I'm still adding most of the other OLR members, but most are pending right now.
2491611	2494632	But I would like to know which good games I should get.
2495052	2498232	I mean, I only have Fear, Condemned, Halo 3, and Guitar Hero 2.
2499012	2501153	Give me at least three games you guys think would be great.
2501473	2503053	I'll play anything but sports games.
2503293	2504373	Okay, that wraps it up.
2504493	2505234	Until later, guys.
2505414	2505934	See ya.
2506014	2507034	Two thumbs up for you guys.
2508974	2509614	Three games.
2509654	2512335	Well, if you like Guitar Hero 2, you probably should get Guitar Hero 3.
2514995	2519377	If you like RPGs, get either Eternal Sonata or maybe Blue Dragon.
2519417	2521938	I don't know, try the demo first because that's getting some mixed reviews.
2521978	2523798	I don't know, it's kind of a hit or miss thing.
2527020	2527580	Let's see.
2529220	2532082	I don't know how into shooters you are, but Bioshock's pretty awesome.
2533222	2534502	If you want to try a shooter, Bioshock.
2534522	2536543	Yeah, if you're playing Halo 3, I say get Bioshock.
2537564	2541385	And if you're looking for cheap shit, I would say Earth Defense Force 2017.
2541425	2541645	It's $19.99 now.
2544631	2548414	Seriously, you deserve to play that game.
2548474	2553997	I mean, I understand it's really cheesy and stupid, but it draws me in, and I don't know why.
2555658	2556079	Anything else?
2557680	2564684	I would say also, well, these are a bit older, but even Saints Row's not bad, or Crackdown.
2565024	2565805	Crackdown I liked.
2566826	2567126	All right.
2568327	2569768	Next email, shall we?
2569868	2571529	This is from Tensai Noob.
2572282	2572782	Emails us.
2572822	2575884	Dear OLR crew, I have a few comments and one request.
2576464	2578105	First of all, the necessary praise.
2578165	2584008	I continue to admire your devotion to the show and quite impressed that you managed to release such a funny, informative podcast each week.
2584328	2585289	This podcast is funny.
2587451	2594814	I always worry each week that I'm just kind of breezing over stories and just being too much of an ass and just talking randomness.
2594854	2596215	I don't even know what I'm saying half the time.
2596995	2600737	I don't know how much quality I put into this.
2600837	2604838	We start to feel we're slipping a little bit, so thank you for your kind words.
2605479	2607039	It helps our egos.
2607700	2610961	Now that that's out of the way, a while ago you were talking about zombie games.
2611061	2614883	Not that you don't frequently anyway, but ironic considering our game of the week.
2615540	2617701	But this was an especially concentrated instance.
2618121	2622023	And you were discussing how it would be great to have a game where you are the zombie.
2622343	2625685	Have you ever heard of the game Stubs the Zombie, Rebel Without a Pulse?
2625745	2626906	Yes, unfortunately I haven't.
2626946	2628326	It's a really crappy game.
2628607	2632148	I tried a demo of it once, and it wasn't revolutionary, but it wasn't horrible either.
2632548	2636350	You control a zombie who can eat brains, turning the victims into zombie minions.
2636731	2640012	Take off his hand and take control of others and produce toxic farts.
2640512	2641493	Oh, this game sounds classy.
2642569	2647514	Anyway, I thought you might appreciate knowing about a game where you actually get to be a zombie instead of always shooting them.
2647534	2649216	But you weren't a big fan of that, Loki?
2650297	2651358	It just got horrible reviews.
2651638	2653500	It was a bad, bad game.
2653800	2657444	It had a funny premise to it, but... Alright.
2658665	2658705	Um...
2659645	2669511	Secondly, again referring a number of episodes back, I would like to state that Halo 3's story does make sense, but you really need to have played the previous games and maybe even have read the books to fully comprehend it.
2670031	2675635	If you need any clarification, I am perfectly willing to help clear up any confusion, as I am yet another devoted Halo fan.
2675695	2683320	On a related note, I completed Halo 3 first time through on Legendary in three days, so I can also provide any gameplay advice you may require, especially for later levels.
2683840	2687082	Okay, my advice I need, how do I not suck so bad at it?
2688302	2688762	You can't.
2688962	2689743	It's impossible.
2690763	2693004	It's just like I was thinking about buying Unreal Tournament 3.
2694745	2700367	For some reason I thought there was a single player mode in it, but I'm an idiot because Unreal Tournament does not have single player.
2700867	2703688	Well, I mean, it does, but it's still fucking Unreal Tournament, you know?
2704289	2705949	I was like, ooh, I can make mods and stuff.
2705989	2706870	Mods are cool.
2707190	2712592	Because I'm thinking like Quake, you know, back when they had mods like Cujo and the Grappling Hook.
2712612	2714533	Because I love Cujo and the Grappling Hook.
2715393	2715894	I know, I'm weird.
2716194	2716714	But, um...
2717346	2718387	I'm not going to buy that game anymore.
2720087	2723189	Well, you know, also I want to say about the whole Halo 3 story thing.
2723209	2732354	I think there was a great video floating around out there that was basically Halo 1 and 2's story kind of condensed into a few minutes that was something you could watch to catch up.
2732414	2733495	I have the collector's edition.
2733535	2736096	I just haven't watched any of the videos on that second disc.
2736777	2738878	Aren't you glad you spent all that extra money?
2738898	2743420	Hey, the only reason I bought the collector's edition was for the video calibration tool.
2743560	2744681	That is the only reason.
2745163	2748830	and ironically enough, I have not used the video calibration tool yet.
2748850	2751115	You tool!
2751435	2751676	Ouch.
2752217	2753760	Alright, moving on.
2753820	2755363	Next email comes to us from...
2757102	2759444	Johnny S, because they didn't sign it.
2759884	2763648	Remember, if you don't sign your emails, I don't know what to call you, so I'll just use your first name and last initial.
2764508	2766030	Loki, I have a question.
2766150	2768432	I'm thinking about buying an 80 gigabyte PlayStation 3.
2769092	2776218	I've got to have Metal Gear Solid 4 and Gran Turismo 5, but other than that, is there anything else that warrants my $600?
2777860	2783865	Maybe Resistance, Fallen Man, and depending on what kind of games you like, maybe Uncharted.
2784724	2789787	Ratchet & Clank, you know, my friend's been playing tons of Ratchet & Clank, and I've watched him play a little bit of it.
2790188	2791348	I'm just not that impressed by it.
2791629	2796111	But then again, I didn't play any of the other Ratchet & Clank games, and I don't know.
2796212	2798733	He loves Ratchet & Clank, he loves that game, so maybe that game.
2798893	2799914	Heavenly Sword, maybe.
2800194	2801055	The Blu-ray player?
2801475	2802576	Yeah, Blu-ray's good.
2802796	2806918	If you like online shooter games, maybe like Warhawk might be good.
2807539	2807639	Um...
2808148	2808748	PlayStation Network
2835376	2836557	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2857978	2858678	and stuff like that.
2858978	2861519	Because they get a lot of demos and stuff that we don't get out over here.
2862459	2862979	So do that.
2863639	2869561	If you want to check out some of the games that are on there like Flow is pretty fun.
2870001	2871481	Everyday Shooter is supposed to be good.
2872662	2873742	Pain just came up.
2873922	2875863	That might be something I like but I don't know.
2876863	2883644	And then maybe if you're into Tekken 5 they have the Tekken 5 multiplayer online game.
2883724	2885545	And you know what game I strongly recommend?
2888044	2890626	Oh my god.
2890946	2893849	I'm not playing that game unless I can hit the game.
2894970	2896332	That's the only way I'm playing that game.
2896392	2900316	I gotta say, despite all the smack we're talking about, the gate looks fucking gorgeous.
2900376	2901216	Yeah, it looks awesome.
2901256	2903118	This is like a game I could just sit and look at.
2903899	2905741	Yeah, and you know what else I can sit and look at?
2906041	2907763	Discovery Channel HD.
2907923	2908583	And porn.
2909084	2909645	And porn.
2909685	2909945	I don't...
2910464	2912506	Just look at games.
2912666	2914127	I like to play them too.
2914207	2916749	But there are a lot of people that do like to just watch other people play games.
2916869	2920331	Anyway, we've got to move on and get to some more emails.
2920631	2926135	Fergatron writes us and says, I know this email is late, but I'm seriously behind my list of podcasts.
2926155	2928137	It's titled Late Entry Episode 255.
2928697	2929558	So it's a few episodes back.
2930228	2933730	Take-Two Interactive had to dish out about $2 million for this hot coffee leak.
2933770	2937733	I'm concerned about the programmer or project manager responsible for the original hot coffee feature.
2938133	2938974	What's going to happen to them?
2939034	2942136	Did they get lynched, raped, or mobbed by corporate?
2944378	2944798	I don't know.
2944898	2945879	We never really heard about it.
2945919	2948620	But those type of internal things are company dealings.
2948701	2949621	We never know.
2950202	2950702	I imagine...
2952652	2957795	I imagine there were multiple people responsible for it, and it was probably part of the original concept as it was.
2958175	2965619	And if you think way back to when we were first talking about Hot Coffee, I think the whole problem was is that the mode was never taken out of the game.
2966199	2972503	Whatever pointed to the mode, you know, like if you think about programming, the way it works, every game is like a giant flow chart, right?
2972803	2981768	So basically what they did, they took that arrow out that enables something to go to the sex mode and turn it on, and all that cheat did was put that arrow back in, basically.
2982769	2985551	I don't think one person was solely responsible for that.
2985911	2989754	I think that was part of a larger screw-up, basically.
2990875	2999561	That's why the game took so freaking long to come out in its sanitized version, because they had to go back and actually take out the entire thing.
2999581	3006626	To be honest, if there's some content that's in the game that they leave in there, people will find it.
3006646	3010549	They found stuff in Zelda, like the debug levels, they found stuff
3011107	3012188	Wind Waker, of course.
3012888	3016969	They found stuff in pretty much any game that has stuff hidden in there.
3017270	3019250	Smash Brothers, hidden characters, stuff like that.
3020711	3033276	We were getting into a talk earlier about, just want to say, before I get back to the email, because now I'm looking at chat room, and we talked about porn earlier, and DMM wanted to remind us that the porn industry actually supports HD DVD, not Blu-ray.
3033556	3034417	They support both.
3034457	3036477	They support wherever people are going to buy shit.
3036698	3038598	Legend of Zaku says Blu-ray forbids porn.
3038638	3039039	Hope you know.
3039899	3040059	Hmm.
3040808	3049211	That's bullshit because I know Pirates, that porno that's pretty funny actually, high production value, is on both Blu-ray and HD DVD.
3049792	3050192	Oh, snap.
3051212	3051472	Let's see.
3051492	3052413	What else did Furgatron say here?
3052613	3055774	Sky, you mentioned that you play a lot of WoW instead of other games.
3056174	3057455	I'm in the same situation.
3057515	3063877	I have only a limited amount of time to play games, so when it comes time to play, I end up playing whatever game I can get the most out of, which ends up being WoW.
3064317	3066298	What server do you play on and what's your character's name?
3066478	3069940	Mine is... I don't know if he wants me to read this on the air.
3070040	3070580	So there you have it.
3071833	3078539	Hey, if you want to find out more information about the Orange Lounge Guild that we all play on in WoW, it's all on the forums.
3078979	3080060	So check it out, forums.
3080601	3081262	Nice plug, huh?
3081642	3083444	Go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com and click on forums.
3084945	3088649	I don't know if my character name is posted, but if you join the guild, it won't be hard to figure out who I am.
3090530	3092292	Honestly, if you listen to the show long enough, you'll know.
3093893	3095795	The last email tonight comes to us from...
3097074	3098015	Ali, I believe it's Ali.
3098855	3102738	I was listening to episode 255 part B and you just mentioned Logo.
3103198	3105220	Oh my God, I was a beast at Logo.
3105300	3108282	I remember me and my one friend had a working Tetris on Logo.
3108582	3110063	You have no idea how hard that is.
3110423	3113525	However, because the language was highly inefficient, it would go wicked slow.
3113885	3116227	We had this running on a one gigahertz Celeron.
3116287	3118028	It was called Micro Worlds on those machines.
3118328	3119930	And the processor would be maxed out.
3119990	3122491	The fan would be going full tilt to play Tetris.
3122912	3123532	Yeah, I'm a nerd.
3123877	3127639	Other than that, I remember I would make some hardcore art with logo fractals and stuff.
3127679	3128259	Good times.
3129439	3129920	Good times.
3129960	3131380	I only ever had logo on the Commodore 64.
3133061	3143485	And for a reminder for those that weren't listening that week, logo is that language where you had a little turtle and you would point, you know, pen down, up 10, right 10, you know, and all that stuff.
3143545	3148227	And it was basically how people of a younger age could learn programming more easily.
3149307	3151008	Why are you giving me dirty looks, Rice Princess?
3151028	3152929	I'm not giving you dirty looks, Rice Princess.
3154486	3156127	I'm just pooping.
3157628	3158668	That's what it looks like.
3159108	3160349	Yeah, mind your own business, pal.
3160389	3161549	Try not to in the room.
3161569	3161830	All right.
3162490	3165551	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us some more email.
3166052	3167732	Skype line will be open very soon.
3167792	3170534	We have about three more stories for you guys before we get there, though.
3170694	3172595	So get your dialing fingers ready.
3172615	3178357	1-877-GAME-OLR or use name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, right after a few more news stories.
3178617	3178978	All right.
3179198	3182119	Including one talking about Boom Boom Rocket.
3182537	3183178	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3209548	3212329	So it sounds like Rice Princess was doing earlier in the corner.
3212929	3216370	It looks like I incline rock music.
3218290	3219731	I downloaded the five new songs.
3219751	3220231	They're okay.
3220291	3228212	They are more rock influenced than Synthie, but I wasn't that impressed because they are, again, just classic remix songs.
3228632	3235634	And one other thing I was going to say, I believe that you can also use the rock band drums for this as well, if you are ever so inclined.
3236246	3237287	If you're really bored.
3237627	3238727	Yeah, really bored.
3238988	3239428	Really bored.
3240849	3246251	And basically, the five songs are free for right now until December 16th.
3246572	3249433	Then afterwards, it's going to set you back 250 Microsoft points.
3249513	3254356	So if you have a chance, get on live, get the update, get the free songs, play it later.
3255416	3259118	Even if you don't think you'll want to play them now, get it anyway while it's still free, right?
3259559	3261520	Free is always good.
3261540	3262560	Free is good.
3262660	3265762	Unless it's Yaris, in which case it's not good.
3267244	3268845	Thank you for watching!
3295367	3300889	But if you think about it, a lot of the principles you learn here, you could apply to a lot of different crafts.
3300949	3303110	I mean, who's to say you can make a weighted companion cube out of it?
3303270	3307132	Now, is that with clay or is that like styrofoam that they're carving or something?
3307652	3312214	It says the materials in it are, I quote, Okay, so it's clay.
3312234	3313134	It's sculpted clay.
3313154	3314274	Yeah, sculpted clay.
3314294	3314374	Yeah.
3322765	3323505	So that's what they use.
3323525	3330107	And you actually, I guess, make a cube out of it and then carve into it and then you bake it and then you color it, basically.
3330127	3331148	And then you feed it to your cat.
3331928	3332848	Or make your cat look at it.
3334889	3335229	Cute.
3336829	3340510	And Sculpey, if I remember correctly, because my sister makes a ton of shit out of that stuff.
3341251	3342651	She loves doing that.
3343371	3343991	You can use it.
3344071	3345212	You can fire it in your oven.
3345652	3347753	Frisbee says that needs to be my Christmas gift.
3347893	3350693	That might be actually a fun Christmas gift for people.
3352014	3352314	Fun.
3353322	3353762	Well, you know.
3353862	3355042	Fantastic.
3355562	3357663	I don't know about you guys, but I like homemade gifts.
3357703	3362124	I think they mean a lot more than something bought at Target on clearance.
3362604	3364564	Well, then I'll poop in a bag for you.
3365545	3366705	I can make a lot of those.
3367945	3369045	You guys are obscene.
3369605	3371746	Enough for all of my friends.
3372386	3373446	No, I know what you mean, Rob.
3373646	3374486	I like homemade stuff.
3374526	3377027	Let's make arcs and crafts together for Christmas gifts.
3377087	3377727	No.
3378087	3379807	I'm going to get you a coaster for Christmas.
3379827	3380408	Don't you want one of those?
3380428	3382568	I'm going to make candy with the aqua dots inside.
3383911	3385133	Special Rice Krispie Treats
3403037	3409141	And then another game, as I mentioned earlier, possibly going to import, Wii Fit has come out in Japan.
3409421	3412383	And of course, there are lines for it.
3412843	3416885	Lots of people looking to play this game, including there's going to be a lot of cool stuff in there.
3416965	3420267	There's yoga, which looks pretty cool.
3420928	3429733	Balance, including they have a skiing game, soccer, ski jump, some sort of like monkey ball thing, and tight rope.
3430236	3431357	and Cardio.
3431377	3433899	They have Hulu Hoop, Jogging and Dancing.
3434820	3435481	Awesome.
3435761	3436622	Can't wait.
3436662	3439084	This game is fucking expensive if you import it.
3439104	3439805	It's like $189.
3439925	3441346	Oh my god.
3441947	3442527	Why so much?
3442547	3443909	Is that just because of the shipping and everything?
3444029	3444429	Import.
3445550	3447152	The import fees can't be that high.
3447552	3448673	It's high demand.
3448733	3449754	Christ.
3450815	3452016	I still might get it though.
3452597	3453658	Oh my god, you're insane.
3453718	3456581	Why can't you just wait a few months for the version to come out here in the US?
3456901	3459945	Because I have bonus money to burn and I can do it that way.
3460045	3460866	Give me money!
3461006	3462527	I'll spend it on a good cause.
3462547	3463188	I know.
3463408	3464209	Oh, you're crazy.
3465791	3466332	Hello everyone!
3466632	3467032	Hi, who's this?
3493177	3496360	It's Rice Princess's other BF, Ranma.
3496380	3497862	Ah, Rice Princess's better half.
3498202	3498963	Her other BF.
3499043	3499784	Oh, other boyfriend.
3500224	3501626	Oh, whoa.
3502527	3503888	Competition.
3503908	3505149	You know she poops a lot, right?
3506271	3506871	And fart.
3507372	3507932	Don't forget that.
3508052	3509254	Ranma, what's on your mind?
3510435	3511215	A couple of things.
3511776	3516038	The first thing I want to talk about is the whole GameStop charging more money for accessories.
3516838	3524482	I mean, I've seen them do this on a regular basis because when Beatmania came out, I went over to Best Buy and they had it for like, I think it was $59.
3525823	3527504	And I went over to GameStop, they had it for $69.
3528084	3535768	I mean, normally the games are known price everywhere else, but when it comes to anything with an accessory, they're known for charging $5 to $10 more for it.
3537375	3538716	That's why you gotta shop around.
3538776	3540617	Do they price match there, out of curiosity?
3541458	3543319	No, because they don't advertise.
3543380	3544060	That's what it is.
3544400	3544841	Interesting.
3545741	3545921	Yeah.
3546242	3549444	Plus that they do a lot of sales with used games and stuff, they don't price match.
3549924	3552206	Well, that's why you want to do your research before you go out and buy.
3552266	3554768	I mean, sometimes GameStop may have the best deal.
3554868	3560212	Like, you know, Final Fantasy XII had that collector's edition that was only available at GameStop, had some extra stuff with it.
3560252	3561713	You know, sometimes it's a good place to get games.
3562093	3563955	But sometimes you're better off going somewhere else.
3565175	3569938	I did go to GameStop to get my collector's edition, but other than that, there wasn't going to be one.
3569958	3572739	I would have gone to Best Buy.
3572759	3577602	I remember when Nintendogs first came out, I ended up going to Best Buy.
3577922	3583985	I was going to go to GameStop, but that day I found out there was a $5 gift card or something you would get if you bought it at Best Buy.
3585265	3589928	That's why that website, CheapAssGamer, that's why that website is so insanely popular.
3591175	3595576	Because that's like gamers getting together to share their resources about where to find the best deal.
3596536	3596917	Seriously.
3597557	3599477	Whoever thought of that, honestly, genius idea.
3599657	3600177	Genius idea.
3600978	3601618	Wish I'd thought of it.
3601658	3602078	I'm jealous.
3605619	3606159	Anything else?
3606919	3612441	Yeah, I want to talk about this whole controversy of this guy getting fired over his honest review of Kane and Lynch.
3612761	3613121	Ah, yes.
3613971	3621603	This is going to open up into a lawsuit for wrongful termination because I think it's really fucked up that someone gets fired for their honest opinion on something, you know?
3622144	3624528	I mean, is that fair?
3624568	3628615	But Ranma, like I said earlier in the show, we don't know for sure that's the reason yet.
3629292	3640335	and especially in the state of California where this guy works, we have this whole law about the whole at-will employment where basically an employee can leave an organization no questions asked.
3640375	3643216	An employer can terminate them essentially no questions asked.
3643556	3645796	It's kind of to avoid those types of situations.
3646137	3656659	In order for him to claim wrongful termination, it would almost have to be like they were setting him up in a way or they were like entrapping him into this or something.
3656719	3657740	I don't know.
3657800	3658380	It would be kind of –
3659924	3660925	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3681112	3688737	At the same time, if you're a talented writer, maybe he'll decide this whole thing has him jaded from the games industry and he's going to go review movies or go write for a newspaper.
3688957	3689657	It's really up to him.
3689677	3691318	Pretty much.
3691418	3693019	I know there are other states that are like that.
3693039	3701364	I know here in New York, it's not at Will State, they have to find a reason for you to be fired unless you're like during your first 30 or 90 days.
3702825	3705447	Then they can just like, oh, fired, done, you know, whatever.
3705467	3705827	All right.
3709525	3712906	Well, Ranma, do you have any other comments or anything else you want to talk about tonight?
3713527	3716128	Last thing and then I'll be on my merry little way.
3716668	3722790	I'm probably one of the few people in the chatroom that's really against this whole Activision Vivendi buyout thing.
3723230	3724811	I'm just really appalled by it.
3725011	3727412	Are you sure you're not being a little tinfoil hat-ish?
3728372	3728592	No.
3729953	3730993	What's so scary about it?
3731834	3732374	It's not scary.
3732394	3734975	It's just that Activision is like one of the last –
3735754	3760270	long-running independent game publishers going back to the 70s they have like this long decorative career of great things that they've done and now boom they're part of some like multi-global unit it's like look at Atari for example they more like a good thing going and then Infogrames bought them renamed it to Atari and now look at them I guess that's true
3761107	3765489	I guess maybe this is just a little bit of fear, but, you know, mergers aren't necessarily always a bad thing.
3765529	3767250	Like, Square Enix didn't work out so bad.
3767890	3772672	I just find the Square Enix merger funny because Square's doing more profits than Enix.
3772772	3775694	Enix walks up, I know it, what a big thing of cash.
3775714	3777195	You're like, hi, we're buying you.
3780936	3781196	Hmm.
3782537	3782897	All right.
3783177	3786879	Well, the thing is that this is not really like a merger per se.
3786939	3790841	It's just that all the venue has just like a controlling stake in the company.
3791325	3793246	They haven't said it's a merger or anything, you know?
3795407	3799189	Alright, well, we'll see if your tinfoil hat things come true or not.
3800490	3801170	I hope not, though.
3802191	3812016	I'm not scared yet, but, you know, yeah, when we start seeing the whole, you know, the orcs and tauren showing up in Guitar Hero, then I will be a little scared.
3813737	3813957	Alright.
3814237	3815337	We'll see what happens, as you said.
3815577	3816538	Alright, well, take care, Ranma.
3816558	3817639	We gotta get some more calls.
3818359	3818739	You got it.
3818899	3819239	Bye-bye.
3819499	3820280	Bye, Ranma.
3820708	3825533	1877-GAME-OLR is the magic number to call, or you can give us a call on our Skype line.
3825993	3828575	Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype.
3829256	3830137	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3830157	3830517	Who's this?
3832079	3832900	It's Puppy.
3833220	3834121	Hello, Puppy.
3834241	3835262	What's on your mind, Puppy?
3838985	3842569	A lot of stuff, but mostly just a lot of rock band issues.
3843249	3843890	What's going on?
3843930	3844831	Did your stuff break?
3846778	3852101	Yeah, my guitar got that bad strum bar problem that's been popping up with a lot of people.
3853342	3854862	I know you can fix that yourself.
3856763	3862667	Yeah, but I'm not that handy with electronics, so I'd rather not risk tinkering with it.
3862887	3864908	Or you're just lazy.
3865048	3866128	It really isn't that hard.
3866249	3870711	You basically unscrew the back, and what it is is the contact switch in there gets kind of,
3871556	3876143	I guess turned, and all you have to do is just loosen the screw, line it back up, and tighten it again.
3876343	3877325	And then you're good to go.
3878867	3880770	That doesn't sound too hard when Loki says it.
3882898	3884459	Well, I've actually got my thumb away already, man.
3884479	3887801	Apparently, though, they actually are giving away free games, too, if you have your guitar fixed.
3887821	3888422	You get a free game with it.
3888442	3889963	But they haven't said what the game is yet, right?
3905419	3918666	I read that story earlier and I think it said that people that had put their origin for replacements like a week ago and it was getting delayed because of a lack of stocks and they were getting that free game.
3919006	3932074	Yeah, I think I heard our old buddy Bobby Blackwolf talking about that because he's been having problems with not just the drums but now his guitar as well and they sent him an email because his drums got delayed but then they told him it was the guitar in the email so he's just all kinds of confused.
3932274	3934775	I was listening to that on his show this week and it just kind of
3935222	3940646	Yeah, I've used my Guitar Hero 3 controller for my guitar My guitar actually started acting up only like 4 or 5 days after I got the system And...
3962876	3967220	It just got progressively worse, and now it's to the point where the downstream doesn't work at all.
3967421	3969663	So the Guitar Hero 3 controller works on Rock Band?
3971384	3974207	My Guitar Hero 3 controller, my wireless one, does work.
3975208	3977670	There's only the PlayStation 3 version that does not play nice.
3977691	3979292	Oh, I thought that worked out.
3979452	3982996	Okay, maybe I'll get the Guitar Hero 3 controller then, because I do kind of want a wireless controller.
3983016	3983516	That would be fun.
3984017	3984297	We'll see.
3984938	3985658	Oh, that's a lot of money.
3985698	3991961	The wireless controller is nice, but I like the design for the Rock Band controller a lot better.
3992101	3993902	I love the design on the Rock Band controller.
3994682	3996623	It's a bummer that they're having all the problems they are.
3997083	4001024	Hopefully by the time they start selling them separately next year, they can fix some of those problems.
4001085	4001805	I really hope so.
4003606	4007727	Yeah, that would be nice, because having an extra controller would be good for parties and whatnot.
4008608	4008888	Nice.
4009748	4011929	Just that you didn't get Guitar Hero 3.
4013047	4015548	I'm sure there's very few of those people out there at this point.
4017749	4028034	Not much, other than the fact that I finished Assassin's Creed and I jumped up and screamed at the ending.
4029335	4031356	I heard the ending is kind of shocking a lot of people.
4031476	4032176	Very interesting.
4033276	4034337	I'd be very curious about that.
4035049	4037531	I wouldn't want to go into detail and spoil it, but yeah.
4037551	4037891	Thank you.
4037951	4038832	You don't see it coming.
4039532	4040433	Interesting.
4040713	4043195	Isn't the ending supposedly kind of a trip, too?
4045216	4054302	Yeah, the ending itself is really trippy, and the way it's kind of set up is that they basically knew ahead of time that this was going to be a trilogy.
4054442	4056444	But the beginning is weird, too, right?
4057785	4058225	Oh, yeah.
4058305	4061247	When I first started, I'm like, okay, what's going on here?
4061287	4064029	This doesn't look like a game in the Crusades.
4064676	4066196	Hmm, interesting.
4066256	4072838	It took me a good two or three hours into it before I started to catch the whole timeline of the game, so.
4072878	4073098	All right.
4074738	4077519	All right, well, Puppy, we've got to let you go to get more calls, but thanks so much for the call, all right?
4078459	4078739	All right.
4079059	4079419	Bye-bye.
4080539	4088001	If you have a call you want to get through to us, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio is the username on Skype.
4090101	4091421	Waiting for a call to drop.
4091441	4093402	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4093422	4093782	Who's this?
4095199	4096019	Good evening, guys.
4096099	4096779	It's DMN.
4097019	4098240	Hello, DMN.
4098320	4099320	What's on your mind, my friend?
4100900	4103221	First of all, if you haven't bought Mass Effect, buy it.
4103301	4104181	It's the game of the year.
4105862	4108563	I'm waiting on Pins and Needles to check it out.
4108703	4109443	I'm so excited.
4109483	4111723	I'm supposed to be borrowing my friend's copy very soon, so we'll see.
4112804	4114824	I got a free copy from my buddy at Microsoft.
4114844	4116265	But anyway, that is not why I called.
4118145	4121646	I have called because I think everybody who listens to this show...
4122153	4129259	should thank you, Loki, DarkSakura, and everybody else who reports news on this station because we don't get paid to do a damn thing.
4131181	4141910	The reason I say this is the story that led into the show tonight was Jeff Kurtzman getting fired from GameSpot over his review of Kane and Lynch, which was an acceptable review.
4142410	4149376	Everybody gave that review the most of seven across the board, and the fact that Eidos...
4151642	4164717	I think that's the most lowest, unobjective thing I've ever seen a media publication do.
4165818	4170924	But again, do you think you might be filling in some gaps with hearsay, though?
4171775	4181039	That's the only thing I'm kind of challenging here is that, you know, yes, we know Eidos pulled the ad campaign, but did they necessarily do it because of the bad review itself?
4181400	4184621	Did they maybe do it because of all this, you know, fallout that happened because of it?
4186082	4199188	Well, I mean, I was going on Eidos' forums this morning, and I saw people, you know, telling Eidos, shame on them for doing what they did, and those threads were getting locked and deleted, which means I think Eidos...
4199731	4203272	knows a little more than they want to say about the situation.
4204533	4207154	And I just hate the gaming companies being so intimidating.
4208715	4211436	If I recall, we had Beautiful Katamari.
4212116	4219939	We had an exclusive release date, and we were intimidated by Namco to pull that because, I want to say, what was it, 1UP?
4221620	4224721	Apparently bought the rights to that, which I think is retarded.
4226637	4230260	I don't think anybody should ever have to buy news.
4231160	4236483	Money should not be involved only when it's purchasing games and or the gaming review magazines.
4236543	4242387	I don't think that the companies should be in bed with the gaming review magazines ever.
4243228	4244889	It creates bad situations like this.
4245549	4246890	It's going to blow things wide open.
4247563	4249364	It's going to make a lot of these publishers look bad.
4249384	4250664	Eidos has lost my business.
4250724	4252545	I was going to buy Conan I, Boring Adventures.
4252925	4255086	I'm taking my $50 and going elsewhere with that.
4255286	4265029	I just want to say, as we referenced earlier in the show, and you do definitely bring up a sore subject around these parts, but it's a fair comparison, so fine.
4266030	4275193	But yeah, it just kind of goes to show you that there's a lot of shady things that go on behind the scenes, and that's why a lot of this corporate stuff
4275888	4277989	has a very sour taste in my mouth a lot of the times.
4278169	4293214	And I'm, if anything, you know, I'm kind of very interested to see how, you know, whether it be mob mentality or not, there's going to be a lot of people that are going to open themselves up to getting the news from gamers who aren't necessarily paid to do it.
4293334	4297756	I'm just kind of, I'm very interested to see, you know, kind of where that takes us, the independent folks.
4298236	4299316	Yeah.
4299916	4304678	Because I would honestly say if this were to happen to Orange Lounge Radio, the same situation with an editor,
4306267	4306787	DarkSakura.com
4327942	4333025	I guess that's just kind of the difference, but we're not, you know, we don't pretend to be a money-making corporation either.
4333085	4334486	Maybe that's why we're not making money.
4334686	4335467	That's kind of the sad thing.
4335487	4337428	You're making tons of money, you just don't know about it.
4339289	4339549	Really?
4339590	4340950	Where's my cut?
4341251	4342611	I blew all of it on crack.
4346394	4348195	DMN, anything else you want to share with the listeners?
4348215	4349276	We've got to get some more calls, though.
4351497	4353178	It's raining like hell in Seattle.
4353198	4353738	Have a good night.
4354179	4354499	All right.
4355387	4357228	Thank you for the weather report, DMN.
4357288	4358188	I appreciate it.
4359908	4361729	I'm going to log you out.
4361789	4364710	That was an even better report than the forecast channel, to be honest.
4364750	4366731	We got more calls ringing off the hook tonight.
4367071	4367971	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4367991	4368371	Who's this?
4369091	4369872	RavensDolphin.
4369932	4370972	What?
4371212	4371432	Hello.
4371592	4372753	I'm okay.
4372933	4373833	How are you, RavensDolphin?
4374953	4375573	I'm okay.
4375814	4378334	I just want to shed some more light on the Gershman trial.
4378474	4380615	Not Gershman trial, the Gershman thing.
4381095	4382236	Yes, not a trial yet.
4382256	4382776	Who knows?
4384301	4385843	See what this is?
4385943	4386984	Hold on a minute, Ravens.
4387024	4390187	See, this is exactly what happens when you play the internet game of telephone.
4390227	4394751	Now suddenly on a blog it's going to show up, oh my god, the Gersman firing case goes to trial.
4395091	4396553	I heard it on OLR, it's true.
4397434	4398354	It's not true.
4398414	4399696	Right, no one will believe that.
4399836	4407063	That's right, no one believes the poo that falls out of our mouths every Sunday night on this program.
4407283	4409405	If the corporate sites are to be believed.
4411341	4413162	What's on your mind Raven's Dolphin?
4413182	4414303	When does that particular show come out?
4414343	4414763	Wednesday
4439963	4442585	That's the day supposedly he was canned.
4442865	4444306	Let's use the word allegedly.
4444346	4445747	That makes it sound professional.
4445967	4450791	Allegedly Wednesday was the day he was locked out of the office and his boxes were thrown out on the curb.
4452852	4454593	That just sounds wrong.
4455154	4460998	It's going to feel like I'm going to feel dumb if this happens when he goes like, well, it wasn't over Kane and Lynch or he had some...
4461667	4464749	I mean, the gaming community would owe these guys one hell of an apology if that came to light.
4464769	4465309	Never gonna happen.
4465349	4465750	Yeah, I know.
4490789	4493610	DMN wants to know, did the podcasters over on GameSpot sound morose?
4494130	4497971	DMN wants to know, did the podcasters over on GameSpot sound morose?
4521380	4521981	DarkSakura.com
4540564	4541105	Is she a lawyer?
4541505	4542265	No, she is.
4542385	4543066	Of course she is.
4543126	4543386	Come on.
4543426	4544607	We would never do that.
4544947	4545808	But yeah, it's just funny.
4546428	4548470	She's being buried in there now.
4549270	4549771	Never.
4550331	4554194	I'm surprised she hasn't called in, but she's probably sleeping if she flew back tonight.
4554234	4559958	But anyway, yeah, it's a lot of answers to come next week.
4560599	4562680	I think this is going to be one of the hot coffees of 2007.
4565022	4567664	I think we're going to see this pop up again before we know it.
4568547	4581159	I can tell you this, as a person that likes GameSpot, and I'm the person that, I always go to GameSpot for my things, I always reference to them, and this is kind of just, I just can't just go there anymore and trust them anymore.
4582320	4593330	I respect them, I respect Jeff for giving an honest review of the game, even though that it got pulled, we don't know until Tuesday, so I respect him for that, and I hope he gets a better job.
4593928	4602800	You know, I gotta say, GameSpot was one of my more... If I was going to go look at corpse sites, it was probably one of the ones I...
4604808	4606570	I thought it was better written.
4606830	4607611	It had a pretty good written.
4607631	4610875	It was very professional in a lot of the stuff I read.
4611235	4616941	Some of the corpse sites feel a little unprofessional to me, but that particular one felt professional in some of the things.
4616961	4625870	Because obviously when we were in the news a lot because of Beautiful Katamari and the Konami thing, we saw what some of these sites were writing about us, and I thought GameSpot was probably the most fair.
4627092	4630634	They put it in the rumor control instead of the other.
4631414	4632294	They mention your name.
4632374	4632975	That's the thing.
4633875	4634275	Interesting.
4635416	4635616	All right.
4635656	4637757	Well, Raven Stolfen, any other quick thoughts?
4637817	4639257	I'm echoing, so we've got to let you go here.
4639317	4639838	Oh, I'm sorry.
4639998	4640218	Bye.
4640678	4640978	Bye-bye.
4642759	4643059	All right.
4643439	4646180	If you want to give us a call, we'll take a couple more calls.
4646200	4648481	877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
4648841	4649842	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4649862	4650182	Who's this?
4651323	4651583	Hey, guys.
4651603	4651823	What's up?
4651843	4652603	This is Footy Monster.
4652683	4653503	Hello, Footy Monster.
4653563	4654564	Hi, Footy Monster.
4655092	4661416	Well, a little special hello from Rice Princess over there.
4661456	4663857	I like your avatar on Skype, by the way.
4663897	4665678	It's some girl with big boobies.
4667839	4668920	Of course, boobs are the win.
4669880	4674403	I think this is going to star in Rice Princess' upcoming game, Boobies and Pandas.
4675884	4678265	All right, what's on your mind, Footy?
4679405	4681487	Well, of course, it has to be this whole thing with games, right?
4681507	4681627	Yeah.
4682930	4683971	Here's two things.
4684291	4689756	First off, when people are actually looking for reviews, they don't go to one place alone.
4689877	4698945	They go to all of the places, and they make an evaluation, a general consensus of what they think they want to think of the game after they read all the reviews, not just one review.
4699619	4700139	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4726849	4731970	and not because of what was written, because I'm sure that what he wrote is the same thing that everybody else wrote.
4733871	4744013	The problem with that is that not only were they an advertiser, but also the number didn't fit with the PR department, which is usually the problem with everything in this gaming industry that we're in.
4744193	4751535	So, like, you know, we're making this sound like, oh, you know, whatever, this is a huge deal, but in truth, it happens every day.
4751755	4753936	It just so happens that this guy, you know,
4754855	4756596	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4783556	4801180	Someone did comment on the joystick story that they wrote on this thing, and apparently it's someone from inside GameSpot, and the guys actually said how the process went, and apparently the management in GameSpot changed, and now it's just a bunch of suits, and apparently this kind of thing is going to keep happening in GameSpot.
4802714	4805817	Well, I don't know, but after this huge backlash, money rules everything.
4805837	4815965	And if it's true that people are canceling their accounts not just by the hundreds but by the thousands, then there are board of directors that are over those suits, and those suits will be out very soon.
4818988	4819808	Are you sure about that?
4819928	4821930	I mean the thing is that suits are there for a reason.
4821990	4823531	That's the reason why they bring them in.
4823551	4825433	Money changes everything.
4825553	4826634	Remember that old song?
4826734	4828896	If it's true that people are canceling their accounts –
4829318	4832579	I don't want to see games go under, I don't, but already they lost credibility.
4854375	4855516	and not the editors.
4855756	4859279	I mean, the editors themselves, if they go somewhere else, they're going to have the credibility back.
4859940	4869648	But if they go, if they stay there like scaredy cats and you will never know if their writing is their honest opinion or something that they're doing just because they don't want to lose their jobs.
4869668	4871310	Well, I was going to say, they may not have a choice.
4871330	4872671	They may have families and stuff.
4872951	4875333	The job market is not that easy sometimes.
4875994	4876214	Yeah.
4876815	4878396	Oh, I mean, trust me, I understand that.
4878456	4888659	But the thing is like we as gamers and as consumers who are about to spend whatever money, okay, not me because I pirate everything, but people who actually pay for stuff, you know, like they want to know what they're paying for.
4888959	4895341	So it's not fair for them to buy crap because you don't know if they're lying to you when they're supposed to be telling you the objective truth.
4895361	4900523	So, you know, I mean, for some reason, there's a reason why it's journalism, you know.
4900922	4905767	It's a niche, but it's journalism, a kind of journalism.
4905827	4907428	So they're supposed to be objective.
4907768	4915255	And if money's in the way, I forgot who was the caller that said that, but if money's in the way, then forget it.
4915976	4925685	The whole thing gets screwed, and the only way we're looking at it is everything's going to be Game of the Year material because we never know who's going to be paying for the paycheck at the end of the month.
4926566	4926846	All right.
4928463	4930764	One more thing, then we've got to wrap up and let you go.
4931185	4931805	I'm looking here.
4933265	4941029	Dr3ev, or whatever this guy's name is in chat, who I can't pronounce his name, I'm sorry, says, FootyMonster takes payola for RPG reviews.
4941209	4942189	Are these accusations true?
4943630	4944330	I wish they were.
4944350	4950212	Trust me, the minute it happens, I'm buying myself a 360.
4951493	4952093	Just know it.
4952933	4953934	No, so far, no.
4954334	4956615	About that, guys, you need to check out The Witcher.
4957071	4957692	Such a good game.
4959193	4960614	What system is this on?
4961054	4961515	It's PC.
4961895	4962095	What?
4962455	4963096	It's PC only?
4963116	4964837	Yeah, it's PC only.
4964877	4966659	But, you know, I don't have a great setup.
4966719	4968981	I have a really crappy video card, like a 60-bug video card.
4969021	4973484	It works exceptionally good in medium detail, but it's such a fun game.
4973704	4977568	I mean, obligatory plug, check for the review on The Ultimate Quest.
4977828	4978288	What's it called?
4978308	4978849	The Witcher?
4980170	4980970	The Witcher, yeah.
4981010	4984693	It's based on some Polish guy's books, and it's actually pretty good.
4984873	4985574	You've heard of this, Loki?
4986680	4987681	It sounds like a scary game.
4988102	4988963	That's what I guess.
4989564	4989944	Interesting.
4990024	4990905	All right, I'll check it out, footy.
4991846	4994329	It's not a scary game at all, but it has sex, which is good.
4994549	4995690	All right, sex is great.
4996091	4996451	I'm there.
4997192	4998293	All right, footy, we've got to let you go.
4998714	4999114	Take care, buddy.
4999134	4999795	All right, take care, guys.
5000255	5000696	Bye-bye.
5000716	5001597	Bye, footy.
5001697	5001797	Bye.
5004927	5008549	I think that's going to do it for calls tonight, because we're looking at two long segments tonight.
5008589	5012312	I guess doing a short show last week has made this show very large this week.
5012832	5018536	So we've got to go around and start getting everybody's final thoughts, but not before we get some last-minute stories.
5019476	5022158	Loki, do you have any last-minute stories for us tonight, by chance?
5023819	5024039	No.
5024579	5026000	Wow, that's a first.
5026080	5026701	It's a slow week.
5027967	5036332	Well, I mean, there's been a couple huge bombshells, like, of course, the GameSpot thing and everything, and the Activision Vivendi thing, but then, yeah, the rest of it's been kind of a quiet week.
5036952	5038733	Oh, American Idol 2 for February.
5039894	5039994	Oh.
5041254	5041514	Really?
5041714	5044896	PlayStation 3, 360 Wii, PlayStation 2.
5045477	5045617	Oh.
5045817	5046097	Maybe.
5046397	5048598	Karaoke Revolution.
5048838	5049359	Interesting.
5049539	5053601	That's very interesting considering Harmonix and Konami aren't in bed together anymore, are they?
5054922	5055302	I don't know.
5055882	5057283	I could still make it, though, without them.
5057608	5057948	I just pooped.
5057968	5058409	You're welcome.
5058509	5059850	Oh yeah, and Disney Channel Mix.
5084485	5085426	When's that coming out?
5085606	5085986	January.
5086286	5086386	Oh.
5086947	5087247	All right.
5087907	5088428	If at all.
5088668	5089928	It keeps getting delayed.
5090429	5090709	All right.
5090769	5093171	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
5093231	5097413	Rice Princess, thanks so much for being here tonight, even if you didn't contribute much besides your poop jokes.
5098074	5098614	No, I'm just kidding.
5098654	5100015	We always appreciate having you here.
5100395	5100855	Thank you.
5101116	5101676	You're welcome.
5102176	5103557	Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
5103797	5104037	No.
5105358	5105859	Okay, then.
5107409	5108970	You contribute so much to this program.
5109050	5110091	I appreciate it.
5110572	5113094	Loki, any final thoughts from you?
5113254	5114595	I just have a lot of games to play this week.
5114735	5115876	Probably won't get to most of them.
5117798	5128086	My final thought is I need to charge my iPod so I can listen to lots of podcasts tomorrow at work because I'm writing tomorrow so I want to be able to listen to podcasts and music.
5129207	5129908	Good idea.
5129948	5130788	That sounds good to me.
5131689	5132730	I need a new job.
5135256	5137237	I hope your employers don't listen to this program.
5137377	5138477	They do, whatever.
5139137	5142718	I don't think my manager knows how to operate a podcast anyways, to be honest.
5143018	5145299	I know I have coworkers that listen to this show sometimes.
5145799	5146279	They like it.
5147139	5149280	No, but seriously, though, I mean, I need a new job.
5150160	5151060	This doesn't pay enough.
5151660	5157222	The problem is, though, in the area that we're at, like, since we don't live in the Bay Area, you know, there's not, like, game companies all over Sacramento.
5157242	5159343	The Bay Area is a highly competitive job market, too.
5159423	5159763	Yeah.
5159823	5161863	Hey, I hear there's a couple job openings at GameSpot.
5163024	5164204	That's in the Bay Area, though.
5164264	5164664	See, you know,
5165479	5166399	I don't want to be an editor.
5166419	5167440	You could take the train over there.
5167460	5168120	I can't write.
5168140	5170801	I can hardly see.
5170821	5172981	Can you imagine Loki's game reviews on GameSpot?
5173261	5174602	Oh my god, this game sucks!
5174882	5176002	There wasn't enough boobs!
5176182	5192787	No, I would be objective, but you know, I just honestly, when we're talking about games during our Game of the Week and stuff like that, I can't go into an in-depth review about stuff, because honestly, I don't play a lot of stuff, and I don't have the free time to
5193565	5195366	Review a game every week or something like that.
5195446	5197527	I don't have enough time to play anything.
5197547	5199488	You barely have enough time to do this damn show.
5200168	5200468	I do.
5200808	5202429	I barely have enough time to do this damn show.
5203029	5207771	I would love to do a review show.
5208432	5211313	One of the things I'm planning on doing with my...
5211934	5212174	Nice.
5212194	5212435	Nice.
5212455	5212595	Nice.
5212715	5213155	All right.
5232702	5238567	Well, anyhow, I guess we'll see what the future holds in 2008 for Loki and, you know, all the rest of us here at Orange Lounge Radio.
5239568	5244071	Meantime, thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting by listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
5244111	5244912	We really appreciate it.

5256561	5259624	You can make some friends on our forums at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, but you can also...
5260154	5261595	Leave us a review on iTunes.
5261715	5265396	That would be fair as well because we need some more five-star reviews on iTunes.
5265416	5266497	We haven't gotten any in a while.
5266517	5267357	That kind of makes me sad.
5268837	5269478	Make me happy.
5269538	5270898	Leave some more five-star reviews this week.
5271399	5272179	That's it, guys.
5272219	5273319	Thank you so much for tuning in.
