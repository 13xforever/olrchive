15000	19500	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19500	25500	And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this Sunday evening, December 2nd of 2007.
25500	27000	The year's almost up.
27000	32000	We'll be doing our year-end special before you know it. We'll announce more details on that in the upcoming weeks.
32000	35000	When Dark Sakura returns to us, hopefully next week.
35000	38000	But in the meantime, we get back into the gaming news for this week.
38000	39500	And Loki's going to start us off.
39500	46000	Let's see. Let's start off with talking a little bit about the Xbox 360 Fall Dashboard Update.
46000	50000	It's going to add a lot of fun things and now they've fleshed out all the details.
50000	57000	Including in the Dashboard Update, Divix support and Xvid support.
57000	63000	So now we can play all the porn that we downloaded on our computers on our 360. Hell yeah.
63000	68000	And then of course the Xbox Live Arcade hits.
68000	73000	Those are going to be reduced price games that basically have been released before.
73000	76000	Sold lots of copies and now you can buy them cheaper.
76000	80000	I believe some of those Bank Shop Billiards.
80000	83000	Two's going to be like 800 points.
83000	86000	Luminous Live, 800 points.
86000	90000	And then there's going to be a couple for 400 like Zuma and stuff like that.
90000	93000	But that's not really part of a Dashboard Update. That's just kind of a...
93000	96000	Well the section that they're going to have for it.
96000	98000	It's going to basically be...
98000	100000	Oh they're going to have a whole section for it.
100000	101000	Oh okay.
101000	103000	Yeah so that's new.
103000	107000	Other things that they're going to be changing. The marketplace is kind of getting a whole facelift.
107000	110000	They're going to have things sorted completely differently.
110000	111000	In fact they're going to also have...
111000	113000	Are they going to make heads or tails of the movies on there?
113000	116000	Because the movies... trying to find movies right now is not what you see.
116000	118000	I don't know about the movies stuff.
118000	121000	But they're going to have this kind of thing where you can...
121000	124000	I guess people are kind of calling it like a cross media bar.
124000	126000	It's you know...
126000	129000	Ways of sorting the live marketplace stuff.
129000	133000	They have a whole section for free shit. So that's kind of cool.
133000	137000	Other things. Xbox Live Originals of course is coming up there.
137000	141000	The parental timer as well. Friends of Friends.
141000	144000	By the way the parental timer made the front page of Yahoo today.
144000	145000	I don't know if you saw that.
145000	147000	I don't know if you visit Yahoo but it's like my home page.
147000	149000	So it comes up and...
149000	151000	It was mentioning...
151000	157000	Oh the new Xbox will limit how much your kids can play games.
157000	159000	Kind of interesting.
159000	163000	The Friends of Friends functionality where you can actually say for example...
163000	167000	Rob I have a lot of people that are probably on your friends list that I don't have a friend into mine.
167000	170000	If you have that enabled I can look at your friends list.
170000	173000	See who's on and add people off that.
173000	178000	Also there's going to be a section where you can add a bio to your user tag.
178000	182000	Where you can actually have a thousand words or whatever in there.
182000	188000	There's also going to be a section where you can put your real name and where you're locating stuff if you wanted to.
188000	190000	If I want people to know that about me.
190000	192000	If you want people to know that about you.
192000	195000	What else do they have in there?
195000	199000	I want to say I set that functionality to friends only earlier this week when the email went out.
199000	201000	I don't know it's just a little weird.
201000	204000	So when are they going to let you...
204000	206000	They're trying to turn the Xbox into MySpace.
206000	207000	That's exactly what I was going to say.
207000	212000	In a way well I mean it's smart they're capitalizing on that whole social networking phenomenon.
212000	214000	But you know I don't know.
214000	216000	It's not MySpace.
216000	217000	It's really not.
217000	225000	Can I remake my profile to look god awfully ugly and little like flash graphics and web bling and glitter graphics?
225000	226000	I have a completely...
226000	229000	Oh man we should have brought that up during the break.
229000	230000	Never mind.
230000	232000	I'll bring it up maybe an afterword.
232000	234000	Other things that they're changing too.
234000	240000	They're going to add a new Xbox Live blade where it's going to have RSS feeds.
240000	245000	Including you know stuff from like Major Nelson and other tidbits of information.
245000	248000	And or advertisements.
248000	252000	Let's see.
252000	256000	Yeah I think that's pretty much it.
256000	260000	And of course this is all going to be available Tuesday.
260000	262000	Nice.
262000	265000	Yeah Frisbee says in chat room.
265000	266000	chat.orangesonshare.com
266000	268000	Thanks for the ad.
268000	272000	Can we start leaving notes on people's Xbox 360s.
272000	273000	Hey thanks for the ad.
273000	274000	Appreciate it.
274000	276000	Comment back please.
276000	281000	Like those god awful like glitter graphics that are like you know.
281000	282000	How are you doing?
282000	283000	Happy Thanksgiving.
283000	285000	What's up sexy gal.
285000	286000	Yeah I know.
286000	290000	You're in the what is it the MySpace sexiest person alive award.
290000	294000	Actually copy and paste this to 10 people or else you'll be ugly tomorrow.
294000	300000	You know if you do have the Xbox Live vision camera you can send wonderful like pictures like that.
300000	304000	You know you may have to take a picture of your computer monitor or something like that.
304000	307000	You know with the image on there but you could you know.
307000	311000	Or girls can just take pictures of their tits and guys can take pictures of their wangs.
311000	312000	I mean that's.
312000	316000	I approve all pictures of women's tits sent to my account on there.
316000	320000	Not all of them.
320000	321000	You'll redirect the wangs to your wife.
321000	325000	I'm just going to take a picture of someone pooing and be like this is what I think of
325000	326000	you.
326000	327000	Stop posting this crap.
327000	332000	I wonder if anyone's been banned like off of live yet for like inappropriate pictures
332000	333000	in their profile.
333000	338000	Irene's going to send pictures of two girls one cup to her full friends list.
338000	339000	Yes.
339000	340000	Videos even.
340000	343000	You could make that your icon you know using the vision camera.
343000	348000	You remember a while back when Microsoft was banning people for 24 hours for questionable
348000	349000	bio lines.
349000	355000	I wonder if anybody's tried two girls one cup fan to see if that gets them banned.
355000	361000	I don't see why that would be offensive just putting something like that.
361000	363000	Because it's not offensive.
363000	366000	Like oh my God you said two girls one cup.
366000	370000	We ban you.
370000	372000	Anyhow.
372000	375000	Moving on to other things that will soon be on Xbox Live.
375000	377000	BioShock.
377000	381000	We've all been waiting for some more content for the game BioShock and a patch is going
381000	383000	to be coming out soon.
383000	387000	It's actually going to have downloadable content with the patch.
387000	390000	Or actually the patch is going to enable this download content.
390000	394000	I assume isn't the patch supposed to fix the wide screen thing too or is that already been
394000	395000	done?
395000	396000	No it's going to do that.
396000	398000	I see so that's the whole thing that this patch is fixing.
398000	404000	The new downloadable content will I assume be a new level or something but they don't
404000	405000	really say a lot about what it is.
405000	406000	New plasmids.
406000	407000	Oh new plasmids.
407000	411000	New plasmids and there's supposed to be a new difficulty in there that's going to disable
411000	413000	the vitachambers.
413000	414000	Nice.
414000	416000	So that's pretty cool.
416000	419000	Guitar Hero 3 had a new download pack.
419000	427000	This time in the form of some indie love and included in there three songs from artists
427000	429000	you might not be familiar with.
429000	434000	Including you get State of Massachusetts by Dropkick Murphys.
434000	435000	Pretty good punk band.
435000	443000	You Should Be Ashamed of Myself by The Bled and Memories of the Groove by Maylene and
443000	446000	Sons of Disasters.
446000	448000	Now this is a pack for Guitar Hero 2.
448000	449000	Oh Guitar Hero 2.
449000	450000	Right?
450000	454000	I was going to say yeah this is a pack for Guitar Hero 2 and that kind of made me go
454000	457000	well that's interesting because now Guitar Hero 3 is out but then you have to kind of
457000	462000	think about well oh yeah Guitar Hero 2 and 3 were kind of made by different companies
462000	463000	so.
463000	464000	Yeah.
464000	466000	That threw me off.
466000	467000	Right.
467000	468000	You're fired Loki.
468000	469000	Sorry.
469000	470000	I'll play Guitar Hero 3 right now.
470000	471000	Alright.
471000	473000	I'm not listening to Orange on the radio anymore.
473000	474000	You fired Loki.
474000	475000	I'm quitting my song.
475000	480000	He fired me for a bad review of download content for Guitar Hero.
480000	481000	Oh my god.
481000	483000	Where's one up on my lawn?
483000	488000	I do love this show sometimes.
488000	490000	Other times it sucks.
490000	492000	Which is like 99%.
492000	497000	Xbox Live Arcade is going to be getting a classic game.
497000	499000	Actually I thought we already had this game on Xbox Live.
499000	502000	Chess is going to be coming to Xbox Live.
502000	503000	Isn't that part of the Spyglass?
503000	504000	Yeah.
504000	505000	Chess Master though.
505000	506000	I know.
506000	507000	It's Chess Master.
507000	511000	Specifically the Chess Master series which was a huge series on PC from what I remember.
511000	513000	Like every year there was a new Chess Master game.
513000	514000	Yeah.
514000	516000	But all I know is that it isn't Battle Chess.
516000	518000	So for that, epic fail.
518000	519000	Or Battleship.
519000	521000	I want Battleship in life.
521000	522000	Battleship is kind of hokey.
522000	524000	Why are you beeping over there?
524000	525000	I'm not.
525000	526000	My new phone is.
526000	528000	Because someone sunk her Battleship apparently.
528000	529000	Yeah.
529000	531000	Chess Master is going to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
531000	535000	Hopefully it's a little better and a little polished than the Spyglass thing was.
535000	539000	It's supposed to have lots of different AI opponents of varying difficulty.
539000	540000	We'll see.
540000	542000	Camera support as well.
542000	544000	So we'll see.
544000	552000	And I would say coming to Xbox Live Arcade very soon would be the most ironic name of
552000	553000	the game I'd say.
553000	555000	The sensible world of soccer.
555000	559000	I don't know about you but I don't think the world of soccer is very sensible.
559000	561000	That's a real game.
561000	562000	I know.
562000	563000	That's why I'm laughing.
563000	566000	It's like when I think of sensible, I think of soccer.
566000	568000	I don't know.
568000	570000	Soccer fans are pretty rowdy sometimes.
570000	572000	The game actually looked kind of fun.
572000	573000	I saw a trailer.
573000	574000	I never played this game.
574000	576000	As much of a Commodore fan as I was back in the day, I didn't have Amiga.
576000	579000	I only ever had a Commodore 64.
579000	581000	I never really played this game.
581000	588000	Anyway, Sensible World of Soccer is coming to Xbox Live Arcade on December 19th.
588000	589000	Wow.
589000	591000	So, hooray.
591000	593000	Be excited.
593000	595000	I don't know.
595000	598000	You know me, stupid American, don't like soccer.
598000	601000	Dark Tetsuya says it looks like a Game Boy Color game.
601000	604000	It doesn't look like a Game Boy Color game, but it does look like a Super Nintendo game.
604000	606000	It looks like an older computer system, you know?
606000	607000	Hey, yeah.
607000	609000	It's supposed to look a little older.
609000	614000	Some of the games on Live Arcade look a little crappy because they're old 80s game ports,
614000	618000	but hey, it might play better than Pro Evo 2008.
618000	620000	Well, yeah, because it's sensible.
620000	626000	Well, also on the Xbox 360, this week it already happened a brand new backwards compatibility update.
626000	629000	Some folks were thinking that this fell off the face of the earth,
629000	634000	that they were never going to release new updates for backwards compatibility again, but it happened.
634000	637000	They added 84 new games to the backwards compatibility list.
637000	642000	There are now 465 games that are backwards compatible.
642000	645000	Some of the highlights of games that are now in there,
645000	652000	Blitz the League, Blood Omen 2, Burnout 2, Point of Impact,
652000	657000	Fight Night Round 3, Forgotten Realms Demon Stone,
657000	661000	Freedom Fighters, a lot of sports games like MVP Baseball,
661000	667000	03, 04, 05, NCAA March Madness, 05, 06,
667000	675000	a lot of NHL games, 2K3, 05, 2K3 is on there twice, I think they cheated.
675000	677000	NHL 2K3.
677000	680000	Oh, there's NFL and NHL, my bad, one letter off.
680000	683000	Playboy the Mansion, I'm sure a lot of folks are looking forward to that.
683000	687000	Here's the one game on the entire list that I actually own for whatever reason,
687000	692000	Tecmo Classic Arcade is now backwards compatible as well.
692000	696000	I know Loki owns this game, this is worth noting, The Guy Game.
696000	698000	I don't own it on Xbox, though.
698000	699000	Oh, really?
699000	701000	I don't technically own it either.
701000	703000	I thought you bought it on PlayStation 2 or something.
703000	704000	Yeah, bought it.
704000	705000	Yeah, all right.
705000	706000	Quote, end quote.
706000	709000	Worms 3D, I don't know if you're a fan of the Worms series, Loki.
709000	710000	Worms is fun.
710000	711000	There you have it.
711000	712000	Not the 3D Worms.
712000	716000	Not playable still, games such as Advent Rising,
716000	720000	Dance Dance Revolution series still not playable, backwards compatible.
720000	723000	Wow, I should be clamoring to get an Xbox 360.
723000	725000	Beyond Good and Evil, I think.
725000	726000	All right.
726000	729000	Anyways.
729000	732000	One interesting thing, the Xbox Live Video Marketplace
732000	736000	is going to be coming to Europe pretty soon.
736000	740000	And this is actually coming from one of those prepaid cards.
740000	743000	Apparently, written on the back in very small print,
743000	748000	said you can access the Xbox Live Video Marketplace
748000	752000	available in the UK, Ireland, France, and Germany.
752000	754000	So apparently this hasn't happened soon,
754000	758000	the cards now being already printed have that information on there.
758000	761000	So soon you will be able to watch videos
761000	765000	and enjoy all the rest of the download content
765000	769000	that we have around the world.
769000	771000	Be excited.
771000	773000	I'm not.
773000	776000	I don't know if you saw this hit the internet earlier this week,
776000	779000	but there was a video that went out on the internet
779000	783000	that it was kind of a social experiment, I guess you could call it,
783000	787000	a guy whose nickname was X Gay Boy X
787000	789000	signed on to Halo 3.
789000	791000	Triple X Gay Boy X.
791000	792000	Sorry about that.
792000	794000	He signed on to Halo 3
794000	797000	and basically got all these people to say really,
797000	799000	I mean, I shouldn't say he,
799000	801000	because that makes it sound like he provoked it,
801000	806000	but people would respond to his name and taunt him.
806000	808000	I'd love to see it.
808000	809000	Irene wants to see a little clip of this.
809000	811000	I don't know if legally we can play the whole thing.
811000	812000	Yeah, we should.
812000	813000	That's long.
813000	814000	I don't want to play the whole thing.
814000	815000	Yeah, don't play the whole thing.
815000	816000	I just want to see interesting things.
816000	817000	We'll play some clips.
817000	820000	We'll play some clips for Rice Princess.
820000	825000	Have your dad give you bloody butt again, faggot.
825000	827000	Yeah, fuck you, Gay Boy, you piece of shit.
827000	830000	Gay Boy, quit sucking off dudes and play.
830000	831000	Gay Boy.
831000	832000	Gay Boy.
832000	833000	Gay Boy.
833000	834000	Fucking Gay Boy.
834000	835000	Hey, what's up, Gay Boy?
835000	836000	We should hook up.
836000	837000	I'm Friendly Uncle.
837000	840000	Gay Boy and Friendly Uncle coming at you.
840000	841000	Something that should be noted,
841000	843000	because you notice that isn't so bad.
843000	848000	There are a few things in here that are not necessarily negative, for instance,
848000	850000	but who knows if it's somebody.
850000	856000	You know how sometimes jocks in high school would befriend the nerds on a dare type thing?
856000	857000	Yeah.
857000	858000	You don't know.
858000	859000	Maybe it's something like that, but I doubt it.
859000	860000	It seems pretty genuine.
860000	861000	One, two, punch.
861000	863000	Hope gay marriage never gets passed.
863000	865000	Have fun being single.
865000	870000	Well, we'll make it to a single boy.
870000	871000	Shut the fuck up.
871000	872000	You're still a faggot.
872000	874000	Well, it doesn't matter, dude.
874000	875000	I'm sorry.
875000	876000	You're not a faggot.
876000	878000	You give a bad name to gays.
878000	880000	You're a fucking nuke.
880000	882000	You're a niggit.
882000	883000	Don't worry, guys.
883000	884000	Ah, there you go.
884000	885000	That's enough.
885000	886000	Wow.
886000	889000	If I hadn't already heard all this stuff before in games,
889000	893000	I'd probably be a little more shocked, but that's still very perturbing.
893000	896000	It's really like, I don't know.
896000	897000	Well, I don't know.
897000	900000	You'd think I'd have a strong opinion on this because I am the gay host here
900000	901000	on Orange Launch Radio.
901000	903000	Yeah, that's just Halo for you.
903000	905000	Whatever, gay boy.
905000	911000	I watched this clip, and I was just tapping my fingers.
911000	912000	And don't get me wrong.
912000	916000	This is incredibly fucked up, but in my mind, it's kind of like,
916000	917000	it's not news.
917000	919000	This is why Xbox Live is infamous.
919000	921000	Hello and welcome to the internet.
921000	924000	Where have you been for years?
924000	927000	I mean, in a way, I'm a little bit torn because yes,
927000	929000	I think these people are really fucked up, and yes,
929000	932000	I think it's fucking sad that there's ignorant people like that out there,
932000	936000	but at the same time, it's a little bit entrapment or provoking it
936000	940000	when the guy goes on there with a name like, you know, gay boy.
940000	942000	But I don't see it that way.
942000	946000	Why does it have to be seen as entrapment if you have a name like gay boy?
946000	947000	I'm a hetero boy.
947000	950000	I would be interested to see what hetero boy would...
950000	953000	Yeah, like, that's dumb.
953000	954000	I don't know.
954000	957000	Like, on the one hand, I'm infuriated.
957000	960000	I'm kind of like livid that people would say that kind of stuff.
960000	962000	Or I heart Jesus or something like that.
962000	966000	Yeah, but at the same time, it's just kind of like, well, you know,
966000	967000	successful.
967000	968000	It was funny, though.
968000	971000	This is why I only like to play with friends and OLR listeners.
971000	975000	I want to say like Fox News or somebody ran some sort of report on this
975000	976000	and they were talking about like...
976000	978000	I saw that about the trash talk.
978000	979000	Yeah, there's some other YouTube out there.
979000	981000	Yeah, Fox just did a report this week.
981000	982000	I saw that.
982000	984000	And the whole thing was like they're all, you know,
984000	986000	are you guys surprised that this is on there?
986000	987000	And they're like, no.
987000	990000	And then like I remember reading some comments on that and they're like,
990000	991000	yeah, of course they're not surprised.
991000	993000	They're the ones fucking saying that shit.
993000	997000	They're going to be like 12-year-olds and stuff, 13-year-olds.
997000	1000000	Now, the reason why I want to bring this up is that, you know,
1000000	1002000	obviously these things make their way around the Internet.
1002000	1008000	And if anybody, Microsoft, has proven they're very good about kind of
1008000	1012000	staying on top of the Internet buzz and trying to plomp this mob mentality
1012000	1013000	when they see it.
1013000	1016000	And, you know, one of their representatives, Trixie,
1016000	1019000	was actually posting on the GayGamer.net blog post where this showed up
1019000	1021000	and just trying to kind of, you know, say,
1021000	1023000	hey, I think these guys are assholes too.
1023000	1027000	And when you see this happen, report it because we do follow up on that shit.
1027000	1030000	And Major Nelson basically kind of says the same thing.
1030000	1032000	Major Nelson posts about it in his blog and says,
1032000	1035000	I just watched or listened to the video you posted on your site.
1035000	1037000	This is what he wrote back to GayGamer.net who posted the original thing.
1037000	1041000	Needless to say, it was disappointing to see how some Xbox Live members behaved.
1041000	1043000	As you know, that's not the type of behavior we support.
1043000	1047000	With over 8 million members, it's unfortunate that some members decide to act like this.
1047000	1050000	I want to point out a few things that all Xbox Live members can do
1050000	1052000	to ensure an enjoyable experience.
1052000	1055000	And reiterates, you know, you can turn off voice from people that aren't your friends,
1055000	1058000	only play with friends, file complaints.
1058000	1060000	And he reiterates, we do act on complaints,
1060000	1063000	so I highly encourage people to file complaints where appropriate.
1063000	1065000	And you know what? I do that.
1065000	1069000	When I play on Xbox Live, if somebody is being annoying,
1069000	1071000	because some people will get, I swear to God,
1071000	1073000	you'll get on Halo 3 and you'll get into some matches
1073000	1075000	and somebody will be doing this the whole time.
1085000	1091000	I swear to God, for the entire match, somebody did that to me once.
1091000	1093000	That's kind of funny.
1093000	1095000	Then if I ever met that person in real life, I'd punch him.
1095000	1100000	I muted the little fucker, finally, so he was just sitting there by himself.
1100000	1102000	Maybe he had a mental problem.
1102000	1104000	That's what I was going to say.
1104000	1105000	Maybe he had a headache.
1105000	1110000	I don't think the mental problem was that severe because he was kicking my ass in Halo.
1110000	1113000	Maybe he's like Rain Man or something.
1113000	1118000	He's really good at Halo, but he just says meh meh meh meh a lot.
1118000	1122000	That could be his thing, but yeah.
1122000	1126000	I muted him and then I rated the fucker down.
1126000	1128000	You go into the little thing and you can rate.
1128000	1132000	You know how everybody on Xbox Live has a five-star rating?
1132000	1134000	Not if you play with me in Halo 3.
1134000	1138000	I'll rate you down so fast if you get on there and say something nasty.
1138000	1143000	I had somebody get on there going n-word, n-word, n-word over and over
1143000	1146000	and I reported it as abuse.
1146000	1148000	That's just disgusting.
1148000	1149000	It's gross.
1149000	1150000	Why do you have to say that?
1150000	1153000	It's because Mommy and Daddy aren't looking and they're acting out
1153000	1155000	to make themselves feel better about themselves.
1155000	1157000	It's because Mommy and Daddy bought them an M-rated game
1157000	1159000	and obviously aren't paying attention to what they're doing
1159000	1161000	and they'll pay for their damn live account
1161000	1164000	because it gives Mommy and Daddy a few moments to breathe
1164000	1167000	and make more babies.
1167000	1169000	Frisbee brings up a good point.
1169000	1171000	Is he a cat?
1171000	1175000	Oh God, I hope I wasn't getting my ass kicked by a cat.
1175000	1176000	Laser cat.
1176000	1177000	That would be kind of sad.
1177000	1179000	I think I'd have to quit video gaming forever.
1179000	1180000	Man, that must be a stupid cat.
1180000	1183000	Meow, meow, meow, meow.
1183000	1184000	You can't even meow right.
1184000	1186000	Shut up, cat.
1186000	1187000	I'm muting you.
1187000	1190000	Hey, my cat couldn't meow right for a while.
1190000	1191000	It took her time to figure out.
1191000	1192000	I know.
1192000	1193000	I really had to restrain myself from meowing.
1193000	1196000	Stupid faggot cat, stop meowing so fucking much.
1196000	1199000	N-word, n-word cat, geez.
1199000	1204000	Black cat, what's that, huh?
1204000	1205000	That's terrible.
1205000	1207000	Sephiroth1215 says something else really good.
1207000	1209000	Listen to these people, though.
1209000	1210000	They're not really 12 and 13.
1210000	1212000	These people are usually in their 20s.
1212000	1214000	Yeah, those people did sound a little bit older,
1214000	1216000	but they sounded like pigs, too.
1216000	1218000	They sounded like frat boys in a dorm room.
1218000	1221000	Gay boy.
1221000	1222000	Look at this.
1222000	1224000	I just totally told this guy.
1224000	1226000	Man, I'm awesome.
1226000	1227000	Dorm rules.
1227000	1230000	See, and they all have lame nicknames, too.
1230000	1233000	It's usually like, oh, halo lover and stuff like that,
1233000	1235000	or like, I love unicorns or something.
1235000	1237000	Like, how could you make fun of a name, gay boy?
1237000	1239000	Master Chief is my butt buddy.
1239000	1240000	Exactly.
1240000	1243000	And he really is.
1243000	1244000	They're stupid.
1244000	1246000	They can't think of anything more creative,
1246000	1250000	like a more creative way to make fun of someone,
1250000	1251000	instead of gay boy.
1251000	1255000	Oh, you're gay, and you're a boy.
1255000	1256000	It's stupid.
1256000	1258000	But the parts of it that are really singing to me
1258000	1260000	is that people will suddenly jump on there,
1260000	1262000	and then they'll be like, I hope gay marriage is banned forever
1262000	1263000	and you're single forever.
1263000	1264000	It's like, dude.
1264000	1265000	Like, wow.
1265000	1267000	It's just some guy on the internet playing Halo.
1267000	1269000	Oh, that hurt my ego.
1269000	1273000	I can't fight back in Halo now.
1273000	1275000	Oh, man.
1275000	1278000	What am I to do?
1278000	1280000	But then Nintendo looks at this shit and goes,
1280000	1283000	that's why we've got friend codes.
1283000	1285000	Oh, Nintendo's so smart.
1285000	1286000	I don't know about that.
1286000	1287000	Anyhow.
1287000	1288000	Kicking you, kicking you.
1288000	1290000	So even more ridiculous news here.
1290000	1293000	Apparently, there is a guy filing a class action lawsuit
1293000	1298000	because he believes that Microsoft created defective copies
1298000	1305000	of Halo 3 that are causing Xbox 360s to blow up everywhere.
1305000	1306000	No, that wasn't Microsoft.
1306000	1307000	That was me.
1307000	1310000	Anyways, apparently, this guy out of San Diego,
1310000	1317000	Randy Nunez, is going ahead with a lawsuit against them.
1317000	1320000	Apparently, he purchased a copy of Halo 3 from GameStop
1320000	1325000	and was plagued by system lockups and freezes and crashes
1325000	1326000	when he tried to play it.
1326000	1328000	Well, where's the explosions?
1328000	1329000	When you say that the...
1329000	1331000	I was being sarcastic.
1331000	1332000	Blow up the 360.
1332000	1333000	I'm thinking I played Halo.
1333000	1334000	Sarcasm.
1334000	1336000	Close it and then suddenly tick, tick, tick.
1336000	1337000	Boom.
1337000	1338000	Sarcasm.
1338000	1339000	Rad.
1339000	1340000	I'll be actually kind of rad.
1340000	1341000	I'd buy another one.
1341000	1342000	No, he...
1342000	1343000	I would not.
1343000	1345000	Did he try a different copy of the game,
1345000	1349000	return a defective one to GameStop for replacement?
1349000	1351000	That, the story doesn't say.
1351000	1353000	You know he was using a 360.
1353000	1355000	So, but here's the thing, though.
1355000	1358000	But, I mean, this is a bunch of bullshit anyways
1358000	1361000	because I remember this story came out, like, you know,
1361000	1363000	before that, oh, maybe Halo's breaking systems.
1363000	1365000	No, it actually is because you're playing the game
1365000	1367000	so much that your system's overheating
1367000	1369000	if you happen to have that overheating problem
1369000	1373000	and then you get three rings of death or whatever.
1373000	1374000	It's stupid.
1374000	1376000	And the fact that this guy's going to sue for this shit,
1376000	1377000	I hope he fails.
1377000	1379000	But, you know, unfortunately nowadays
1379000	1381000	a lot of times these people succeed, so.
1381000	1384000	And, of course, whenever we hear about the frivolous lawsuits
1384000	1385000	we get a little bit angsty.
1385000	1389000	And nothing inspires our next segment like frivolous lawsuits.
1389000	1392000	It's time to bring on the FUs of the week.
1392000	1407000	Music
1407000	1410000	Hey, I guess I would say this is a pre-FU
1410000	1413000	for my work review that's going to be this week
1413000	1417000	which I'm demanding a raise, which I'm sure I will not get.
1417000	1419000	But I haven't gotten one in three years
1419000	1421000	and I'm well deserving of one
1421000	1423000	since I have four times the accounts
1423000	1427000	that certain other sales reps do at my company.
1427000	1429000	So basically my whole thing is I'm going to go in there
1429000	1432000	and just say, okay, am I getting a review or not?
1432000	1434000	And if I'm not, then I'm going to be a complete asshole.
1434000	1435000	You should.
1435000	1439000	So fuck you stupid managers at my work
1439000	1442000	that aren't willing to pay me a decent salary.
1442000	1444000	I'm already underpaid as it is.
1444000	1445000	If I get a fucking raise,
1445000	1450000	then I'll be just slightly less underpaid.
1450000	1451000	I'll go next.
1451000	1454000	My FU of the week goes to the fact that I don't own a house.
1454000	1456000	I rent, but I don't own
1456000	1458000	because I went to a party last night with William.
1458000	1459000	These guys own this house.
1459000	1461000	It was just beautiful what they've done with it.
1461000	1465000	The backyard was all like an island getaway.
1465000	1466000	I mean, seriously,
1466000	1469000	they had spent obviously a lot of time remodeling this place.
1469000	1471000	I'm just like, I want a house that's cool.
1471000	1472000	Don't get me wrong.
1472000	1474000	I love this house, but I can't really change it
1474000	1475000	because it's not mine.
1475000	1476000	Does that make sense?
1476000	1477000	So FU to not owning a house.
1477000	1479000	I'll be rich one day, damn it.
1479000	1480000	One of these days.
1480000	1481000	Yeah, that's right.
1481000	1483000	Rice Princess, do you have anything?
1483000	1488000	FU to cats that can't meow properly.
1488000	1491000	They need to make a speech.
1491000	1493000	Shut up, cat.
1493000	1496000	Yeah, that's it.
1496000	1498000	All right.
1498000	1500000	That does it for the FUs of the week.
1500000	1501000	That was really short.
1501000	1502000	Wow.
1502000	1504000	Usually there's a lot of angst built up for this.
1504000	1506000	It's because we stopped reading chat FUs.

1716240	1721840	whoopty-doo all right i'm waiting an eager and your solid five
1721840	1725440	let's move on to the gaming news shall we and uh you know here on
1725440	1728960	orange entre do we like to talk about the current systems and everything the
1728960	1733280	kids are playing so that's why this next article is about the commodore 64 whoa
1733280	1739520	radical and uh yes on the commodore 64 somebody with a lot of free time has
1739520	1744240	managed to make a guitar hero clone type thing for the commodore 64
1744240	1748000	now i shouldn't say it's a full game yet it's still in its concept stages but
1748000	1751920	it's called shreds 64 and what they did is they took
1751920	1755280	their playstation 2 guitar and basically adapted it so that it can
1755280	1759200	be read in the uh joystick ports and uh yeah now they've made it so that
1759200	1762640	you know the notes fall and it reads the guitar and they have
1762640	1766400	what's called the shredocity and the applause and the applause is
1766400	1769840	basically the uh meter you know um how well you're doing just like in
1769840	1774400	the game and i guess shredocity is uh kind of like your you know when you tilt
1774400	1777360	up your uh crowd crowd meter or whatever
1777360	1781760	crowd boost stuff so shredos yes your shredocity that is
1781760	1786400	so rad i like that a lot so somebody yeah you're a commodore 64 fangirl aren't
1786400	1788640	you i kind of am yeah it started off with this
1788640	1790640	little tech demo where somebody did this and
1790640	1794560	the it was able to recognize the controller strum up strum down
1794560	1798720	lifting up all that stuff kind of neat loki i'm surprised you're not into this
1798720	1801520	kind of stuff then again it is commodore 64 i know that's not your thing
1801520	1805520	that's commodore 64 ain't my thing still kind of cool
1805520	1809360	i like it i approve of this project me too thumbs up
1809360	1813120	anyway i'm disappointed to see that we don't have a dreamcast game yet
1813120	1816320	of like you know guitar hero or something like that
1816320	1820080	because you know the dreamcast has tons of games coming out for some reason even
1820080	1824480	though you know sure enough uh anyways um
1824480	1827600	another mod also kind of dealing with a music game
1827600	1830640	um rock band as you remember me complaining about
1830640	1835040	the drums and how loud they were apparently a lot of people are looking
1835040	1838880	for homebrew ways of making them quieter and there's a couple
1838880	1840480	different methods that you can use out there
1840480	1844000	uh one of which is self self-adhesive rubber
1844000	1850000	and self-adhesive colored felt and you basically shove that on there and it
1850000	1854160	doesn't have to be colored felt just so that you know you know which
1854160	1856080	color because if you're covering the whole drum
1856080	1860000	you're not going to know what color is what you don't have to you can do all
1860000	1865360	black if you're emo like that i mean so whatever but um there's another
1865360	1869680	one i saw also there was a rubber mouse pad
1869680	1874320	and you glue that on there so apparently though it works pretty well
1874320	1877920	and um reducing the sound i guess by um
1877920	1883360	70 well there you go maybe the wife will let you play if you can reduce the sound
1883360	1887200	she oh by the way um she bought rock band for me
1887200	1891280	or she gave me a check for because i paid with it my money but she only
1891280	1894560	she only paid for 100 of it because she says that the remainder of the money
1894560	1898400	would have been for the drum kit and she's not supporting the drum kit
1898400	1903280	that's awesome your wife is hilarious
1903520	1906160	tell her we need i'm gonna take her out we're gonna go to olive garden have a
1906160	1910400	fancy dinner all right happy olive garden i'll take
1910400	1914800	it a red lobster if she wants spare no expense all right
1914800	1917920	well uh if you've been following the entertainment world at all which i'm
1917920	1921040	sure many of you folks that play video games also enjoy the occasional movie or
1921040	1923120	tv show and i'm sure you are aware of the
1923120	1925440	current writers guild strike that's going on
1925440	1928960	uh which is you know gonna kind of end some of your favorite shows a little
1928960	1933840	early this year like heroes next week's battle star galactica is that
1933840	1936720	is that something like some no something's getting postponed it might
1936720	1940560	even be all together cancelled what because of this damn strike they can't
1940560	1948320	they can't cancel battle star they can be sure shit can be honest with heroes
1948320	1950800	man i think that's actually kind of good for
1950800	1954160	them no i i think heroes has been just fine this season
1954160	1957360	there's it's it was slow to develop like the first season
1957360	1961760	but the past few episodes have been amazing it's all right and l is awesome
1961760	1965040	i swear to god if they kill her off monday i'm gonna be so pissed anyway
1965040	1970320	um well obviously the right what i said two of them are supposed to die
1970320	1974240	yeah don't remind me all right and l probably no
1974240	1979200	writer's strike uh is going on well one thing that they are not striking against
1979200	1984960	is video games and uh the writer's guild is allowed to write for video games
1984960	1990240	currently while the strike is going on so um something to think about they are
1990240	1992560	allowing the members to work on games during the strike that's
1992560	1995840	that could be a good thing because honestly some of these games could use a
1995840	1999680	few better writers so i say uh this is a good thing for the
1999680	2003920	video game industry bad for tv movies good for video games
2003920	2010320	so anyways um another good thing that's good for video
2010320	2013520	games is using topless models to promote them
2013520	2017760	and that's what ea did for their european ad campaign
2017760	2021360	where they use two sexy models that were naked to
2021360	2027840	you know promote the game i approve okay did you guys see the new we commercial
2027840	2031760	for what game was it where they're kind of
2031760	2036640	like sort of parodying um fast times at richmont high where the
2036640	2041040	girls coming out of the um pool and they're like in bikinis and
2041040	2043440	what game was it promoting i don't know but like
2043440	2049680	nintendo's using sex to sell like what's going on here wholesome nintendo
2049680	2053280	putting girls in bikinis maybe they finally figured out that sex sells i
2053280	2055920	don't know girls in bikinis i don't yeah they're
2055920	2060400	like two girls i don't remember what game it was it was a competitive game
2060400	2063760	um because there was like four people in the room and damn it i don't remember
2063760	2068800	gosh you're so good at these shut up what like smarty pants no no no
2068800	2071360	wait are you talking to me maybe it's seen it
2071360	2079280	no it's not seen it no it was like fuck and it was a game kabuki uh the chat
2079280	2082880	is saying smackdown versus raw 08 oh maybe that's what it was yeah and they
2082880	2086160	say it's the publisher not nintendo yeah that would be a third party publisher
2086160	2092560	okay yeah that's like mario galaxy now with more nipples
2092560	2097520	hot awesome uh anything replace the stars of boobies
2097520	2101440	anything else you have to go around and collect 100 boobies
2101440	2105440	that's what people do in those 8-bit hacks like you know when they hack the
2105440	2107840	old games they'll turn everything into porn
2107840	2111520	you know that's awesome i approve like somebody one of the first ones i ever
2111520	2115600	saw was somebody took that um japanese only game i don't know if
2115600	2117600	you've ever seen this game then nuts and milk

2232960	2235840	show the national geographic ladies with their boobies
2235840	2240560	they're like flat and not always i've seen some big boobies
2240560	2244560	i'm seeing that i know i'm like this conversation is not going to a happy
2244560	2250400	place it's true so let's talk about uh toys
2250400	2254960	and children's toys okay and uh that you know what like all these toys have been
2254960	2257360	getting recalled this year like the uh what was the
2257360	2260560	oh god what was that the dots thing that had a
2260560	2264720	date rape drug in it apparently oh no no it was something you could use as an
2264720	2268000	ingredient in creating the date rape drug if you eat it
2268000	2271200	oh that's right yeah the same effect what was that called the dots or
2271200	2274000	whatever we need a bunch of that the hell was
2274000	2276400	why you just want to eat it i don't want to eat it
2276400	2280320	i want to make dot creations you want to make the cat eat it and see what happens
2280320	2284000	oh no i wouldn't i wouldn't make sure kitty eat that that's mean
2284000	2287000	That would go, mama mama.
2287000	2288000	Yeah.
2288000	2289000	Awkward kitty.
2289000	2290000	Awkward dots.
2290000	2291000	Thank you, Raven's Dolphin.
2291000	2292000	Awkward dots.
2292000	2294000	That's what they were called.
2294000	2299000	Well, anyhow, according to a recent article in the Los Angeles Time, apparently because
2299000	2305000	of all these recalls, apparently game publishers are seeing a 19% increase in sales because
2305000	2311000	I guess games are safe and they're not going to try to drug your children as you are aware.
2311000	2315000	They'll just show them pictures of murder and everything like that, you know?
2315000	2317000	Pictures of murder, yes.
2317000	2318000	Like, murder.
2318000	2321000	You remember Manhunt 2 is murder.
2321000	2322000	Murder Sims.
2322000	2327000	Anyhow, listen, we don't need to give Manhunt 2 any more press.
2327000	2329000	I mean, the game's not that good.
2329000	2336000	Anyway, this is coming from a quote from Jarek Johnson, who's an analyst from Capital Markets,
2336000	2338000	says, there's definitely money leaving the toy sector.
2338000	2343000	It's logical to assume that video games might be viewed by some parents as an alternative.
2343000	2347000	He's an analyst.
2347000	2349000	Why you gotta take this show to the Toilet Rice Princess?
2349000	2351000	I don't know.
2351000	2352000	Anyhow, anyways.
2352000	2354000	Just an impulse.
2354000	2355000	Yeah.
2355000	2357000	This picture's naughty.
2357000	2359000	Anyways, sorry.
2359000	2361000	What are you doing over there on your laptop?
2361000	2364000	You don't have to announce it on the show.
2364000	2366000	Yeah, this picture's naughty.
2366000	2369000	Oh yeah, that's real butter.
2369000	2373000	No, anyways, completely off topic here.
2373000	2379000	Space Invaders Extreme is being released for the Nintendo DS in Japan.
2379000	2381000	And why should I even mention this?
2381000	2384000	Because, you know, hey, it's Space Invaders and it's a remake.
2384000	2385000	It actually looks pretty cool.
2385000	2391000	It kind of incorporates music a little bit to it, and they have a YouTube video on Joystick right now.
2391000	2392000	Worth checking out.
2392000	2400000	And it reminds me a lot of Rez or even, like, Luminous a little bit.
2400000	2401000	Really?
2401000	2404000	Yeah, it's really cool looking, actually.
2404000	2408000	So, you know, if it comes out over here, I'm definitely going to have to check it out.
2408000	2411000	But, you know, it kind of changes a little bit of the pacing of the game and stuff.
2411000	2413000	They have power-ups and stuff you can get.
2413000	2417000	But, you know, each ship that you blow up kind of, you know, adds beats to the music and stuff.
2417000	2419000	So it's pretty cool.
2419000	2421000	It's got a little, like, trippy background and stuff, too.
2421000	2423000	Is it based on, also, the BPM?
2423000	2427000	Kind of like how they did on Vibrib and, like, the speed of the stuff coming towards you?
2427000	2430000	Um, I don't know about that, but it just looks really cool, though.
2430000	2432000	That would be cool.
2432000	2433000	Mm-hmm.
2433000	2434000	Yeah.
2434000	2435000	Yep.
2435000	2436000	All right.
2436000	2440000	Well, let's go ahead and move on to our mailbag segment.
2440000	2441000	That's right.
2441000	2443000	Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangehontrader.com.

2446000	2450000	Since Dark Sakura is not here this week, I will be doing the honors, whether you like it or not.
2450000	2453000	I am, too.
2453000	2456000	Too bad.
2456000	2461000	Email number one this week comes to us from...
2461000	2462000	I don't know.
2462000	2464000	They didn't sign it.
2464000	2469000	We're going to say this is from Richard M.
2469000	2471000	He says, all right, I'm listening right now.
2471000	2473000	Apparently, this person's listening to the show right now.
2473000	2475000	I'm playing Halo 3 and blah, blah, blah.
2475000	2478000	I just wanted to say hi because I haven't listened for about four weeks.
2478000	2483000	I just got an Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, and I sent a request to you two, Sky and Loki and Dark Sakura.
2483000	2485000	Who's not there right now, but let her know.
2485000	2488000	Will do, but I'm sure she'll see the friend's request when she logs in next.
2488000	2491000	I'm still adding most of the other OLR members, but most are pending right now.
2491000	2495000	But I would like to know which good games I should get.
2495000	2499000	I mean, I only have Fear, Condemned, Halo 3, and Guitar Hero 2.
2499000	2501000	Give me at least three games you guys think would be great.
2501000	2503000	I'll play anything but sports games.
2503000	2504000	Okay, that wraps it up.
2504000	2506000	Until later, guys, see ya.
2506000	2509000	Two thumbs up for you guys.
2509000	2510000	Three games.
2510000	2515000	Well, if you like Guitar Hero 2, you probably should get Guitar Hero 3.
2515000	2519000	If you like RPGs, get either Eternal Sonata or maybe Blue Dragon.
2519000	2522000	I don't know, try the demo first because that's getting some extra views.
2522000	2527000	I don't know, it's kind of a hit or miss thing.
2527000	2529000	Let's see.
2529000	2533000	I don't know how into shooters you are, but BioShock's pretty awesome.
2533000	2534000	If you want to try a shooter, BioShock.
2534000	2538000	Yeah, if you're playing Halo 3, I said get BioShock.
2538000	2542000	And if you're looking for cheap shit, I would say Earth Defense Force 2017.
2542000	2544000	It's 1999 now.
2544000	2548000	Seriously, you deserve to play that game.
2548000	2555000	I mean, I understand it's really cheesy and stupid, but it draws me in, and I don't know why.
2555000	2557000	Anything else?
2557000	2565000	I would say also, well, these are a bit older, but even Saints Row's not bad, or Crackdown.
2565000	2567000	Crackdown I liked.
2567000	2568000	All right.
2568000	2570000	Next email, shall we?
2570000	2573000	This is from Tensei Noob, emails us.
2573000	2576000	Dear OLR crew, I have a few comments and one request.
2576000	2578000	First of all, the necessary praise.
2578000	2584000	I continue to admire your devotion to the show and quite impressed that you managed to release such a funny, informative podcast each week.
2584000	2586000	This podcast is funny.
2586000	2587000	And informative.
2587000	2595000	You know, I always worry each week that I'm just kind of being, you know, kind of breezing over stories and just being too much of an ass and just like talking randomness.
2595000	2597000	I don't even know what I'm saying half the time.
2597000	2598000	I know.
2598000	2601000	I don't know how much quality I put into this.
2601000	2605000	We start to feel we're slipping a little bit, so thank you for your kind words.
2605000	2607000	It helps our egos.
2607000	2608000	Untrue words.
2608000	2611000	Now that that's out of the way, a while ago you were talking about zombie games.
2611000	2615000	Not that you don't frequently anyway, but ironic considering our Game of the Week.
2615000	2618000	But this is an especially concentrated instance.
2618000	2622000	And you were discussing how it would be great to have a game where you are the zombie.
2622000	2625000	Have you ever heard of the game Stubbs the Zombie, Rebel Without a Pulse?
2625000	2628000	Yes, unfortunately I haven't. It's a really crappy game.
2628000	2632000	I tried a demo of it once and it wasn't revolutionary, but it wasn't horrible either.
2632000	2636000	You control a zombie who can eat brains, turning the victims into zombie minions.
2636000	2640000	Take off his hand and take control of others and produce toxic farts.
2640000	2642000	Oh, this game sounds classy.
2642000	2647000	Anyway, I thought you might appreciate knowing about a game where you actually get to be a zombie instead of always shooting them.
2647000	2650000	But you weren't a big fan of that, Loki?
2650000	2654000	It just got horrible reviews. It was a bad game.
2654000	2657000	It had a funny premise to it, but...
2657000	2659000	Alright.
2659000	2665000	Secondly, again referring a number of episodes back, I would like to state that Halo 3's story does make sense.
2665000	2670000	But you really need to have played the previous games and maybe even have read the books to fully comprehend it.
2670000	2676000	If you need any clarification, I am perfectly willing to help clear up any confusion, as I am yet another devoted Halo fan.
2676000	2684000	On a related note, I completed Halo 3 first time through on Legendary in three days, so I can also provide any gameplay advice you may require, especially for later levels.
2684000	2688000	Okay, my advice I need, how do I not suck so bad at it?
2688000	2691000	You can't. It's impossible.
2691000	2695000	It's just like I was thinking about buying Unreal Tournament 3.
2695000	2701000	For some reason I thought there was a single player mode in it, but I'm an idiot because Unreal Tournament does not have single player.
2701000	2704000	Well, I mean, it does, but it's still fucking Unreal Tournament, you know?
2704000	2707000	I was like, ooh, I can make mods and stuff. Mods are cool.
2707000	2713000	Because I'm thinking like Quake, you know, back when they had mods like Kujo and the grappling hook.
2713000	2715000	Because I love Kujo and the grappling hook.
2715000	2717000	I know, I'm weird.
2717000	2720000	But I'm not going to buy that game anymore.
2720000	2730000	Well, you know, also I want to say about the whole Halo 3 story thing, I think there was a great video floating around out there that was basically Halo 1 and 2's story kind of condensed into a few minutes.
2730000	2732000	That was something you could watch to catch up.
2732000	2736000	I have the collector's edition, I just haven't watched any of the videos on that second disc.
2736000	2739000	Aren't you glad you spent all that extra money?
2739000	2743000	Hey, the only reason I bought the collector's edition was for the video calibration tool.
2743000	2745000	That is the only reason.
2745000	2748000	And ironically enough, I have not used the video calibration tool.
2748000	2750000	You tool!
2750000	2752000	Ouch.
2752000	2754000	Alright, moving on.
2754000	2760000	Next email comes to us from Johnny S. because they didn't sign it.
2760000	2764000	Remember, if you don't sign your emails, I don't know what to call you, so I'll just use your first name and last initial.
2764000	2766000	Loki, I have a question.
2766000	2769000	I'm thinking about buying an 80 gigabyte PlayStation 3.
2769000	2774000	I've got to have Metal Gear Solid 4 and Grand Theft 5, no, I'm sorry, Gran Turismo 5.
2774000	2777000	But other than that, is there anything else that warrants my 600 bucks?
2777000	2784000	Maybe Resistance, Fallen Man, and depending on what kind of games you like, maybe Uncharted.
2784000	2790000	Ratchet and Clank, you know, my friend's been playing tons of Ratchet and Clank, and I've watched him play a little bit of it.
2790000	2792000	I'm just not that impressed by it.
2792000	2795000	But then again, I didn't play any of the other Ratchet and Clank games.
2795000	2799000	I don't know, he loves Ratchet and Clank, he loves that game, so maybe that game.
2799000	2800000	Heavenly Sword, maybe.
2800000	2802000	The Blu-Ray player?
2802000	2808000	Blu-Ray's good, if you like online shooter games, maybe like Warhawk might be good.
2808000	2813000	You know, there's stuff out there definitely, but not as much as maybe like Xbox 360.
2813000	2816000	But just, you know, wait, be patient about it, I guess.
2816000	2821000	And if you can get your hands on the 60 gig system, you'll probably appreciate that a lot better.
2821000	2828000	Because to be honest, you know, you don't really need the extra hard drive space right now.
2828000	2831000	There really is not a lot to download on there.
2831000	2836000	Is there anything on the PlayStation Network worth getting?
2836000	2840000	Yeah, the first thing you need to get is a Japanese account, that's for sure.
2840000	2846000	You can do that for free, so I recommend looking up on the internet to get a Japanese account and do that.
2846000	2850000	Because when you do that, you'll really get some really kickass demos from Japan.
2850000	2853000	You'll also be able to download the Gran Turismo 5 prologue demo,
2853000	2859000	and especially if you're interested in Gran Turismo 5, and stuff like that.
2859000	2862000	Because they get a lot of demos and stuff that we don't get out over here.
2862000	2870000	So do that. If you want to check out some of the games that are on there, like Flow is pretty fun,
2870000	2874000	Everyday Shooter is supposed to be good, Pain just came up.
2874000	2878000	That might be something I like, but I don't know.
2878000	2884000	And then maybe if you're into Tekken 5, they have the Tekken 5 multiplayer online game.
2884000	2886000	And you know what game I strongly recommend?
2886000	2891000	It's Africa!
2891000	2895000	I love playing that game, it's less than a condition.
2895000	2896000	That's the only way I'm playing that game.
2896000	2900000	I gotta say, despite all the smack we're talking about, the game looks fucking gorgeous.
2900000	2901000	Yeah, it looks awesome.
2901000	2903000	This is like a game I can just sit and look at.
2903000	2906000	Yeah, and you know what else I can sit and look at?
2906000	2908000	Discovery Channel HD.
2908000	2909000	And porn.
2909000	2914000	I don't just look at games, I like to play them too.
2914000	2917000	But there are a lot of people that do like to just watch other people play games.
2917000	2920000	Anyway, we've got to move on and get to some more emails.
2920000	2922000	Furgatron writes us and says,
2922000	2926000	I know this email is late, but I'm seriously behind my list of podcasts.
2926000	2928000	It's titled Late Entry Episode 255.
2928000	2930000	So it's a few episodes back.
2930000	2933000	Take-Two Interactive had to dish out about 2 million for this hot coffee leak.
2933000	2938000	I'm concerned about the programmer or project manager responsible for the original hot coffee feature.
2938000	2939000	What's going to happen to them?
2939000	2943000	Did they get lynched, raped, or mobbed by corporate?
2943000	2945000	I don't know.
2945000	2946000	We never really heard about it.
2946000	2949000	But those type of internal things are company dealings.
2949000	2950000	We never know.
2950000	2955000	I imagine there were multiple people responsible for it,
2955000	2958000	and it was probably part of the original concept as it was.
2958000	2961000	And if you think way back to when we were first talking about hot coffee,
2961000	2966000	I think the whole problem was is that the mode was never taken out of the game.
2966000	2969000	Whatever pointed to the mode,
2969000	2972000	if you think about programming, the way it works every game is like a giant flow chart, right?
2972000	2973000	So basically what they did,
2973000	2978000	they took that arrow out that enables something to go to the sex mode and turn it on,
2978000	2982000	and all that cheat did was put that arrow back in, basically.
2982000	2985000	So I don't think one person was solely responsible for that.
2985000	2990000	I think that was part of a larger screw-up, basically.
2990000	2996000	That's why the game took so freaking long to come out in its sanitized version,
2996000	2999000	because they had to go back and actually take out the entire thing,
2999000	3004000	and to be honest, if there's some content that's in the game that they leave in there,
3004000	3006000	people will find it.
3006000	3009000	I mean, shit, they found stuff in Zelda, like the debug levels.
3009000	3012000	They found stuff in Wind Waker, of course.
3012000	3017000	They found stuff in pretty much any game that has stuff hidden in there.
3017000	3020000	Smash Brothers, hidden characters, stuff like that.
3020000	3022000	We were getting into a talk earlier about,
3022000	3024000	just want to say, before I get back to the email,
3024000	3025000	because now I'm looking at chat room,
3025000	3028000	and we talked about porn earlier,
3028000	3032000	and DML wanted to remind us that the porn industry actually supports HD DVD,
3032000	3033000	not Blu-Ray.
3033000	3034000	They support both.
3034000	3036000	They support wherever people are going to buy shit.
3036000	3039000	Legezaku says Blu-Ray forbids porn, hope you know.
3039000	3040000	Hmm.
3040000	3042000	That's bullshit, because I know Pirates,
3042000	3046000	that porno that's pretty funny, actually, high production value,
3046000	3049000	is on both Blu-Ray and HD DVD.
3049000	3050000	Oh, snap.
3050000	3052000	Let's see, what else did Fergotron say here?
3052000	3056000	Sky, you mentioned that you play a lot of WoW instead of other games.
3056000	3057000	I'm in the same situation.
3057000	3059000	I have only a limited amount of time to play games,
3059000	3060000	so when it comes time to play,
3060000	3062000	I end up playing whatever game I can get the most out of,
3062000	3064000	which ends up being WoW.
3064000	3066000	What server do you play on, and what's your character's name?
3066000	3069000	Mine is, I don't know if he wants me to read this on the air.
3069000	3071000	So there you have it.
3071000	3073000	Hey, if you want to find out more information
3073000	3077000	about the Orange Lounge Guild that we all play on in WoW,
3077000	3079000	it's all on the forums, so check it out.
3079000	3080000	Forums.
3080000	3081000	Ah, nice plug, huh?
3081000	3084000	Go to orangeloungevideo.com and click on Forums.
3084000	3086000	I don't know if my character name's posted,
3086000	3089000	but if you join the Guild, it won't be hard to figure out who I am.
3089000	3093000	Honestly, if you listen to this show long enough, you'll know.
3093000	3098000	The last email tonight comes to us from Ali, I believe it's Ali.
3098000	3103000	I was listening to Episode 255, Part B, and you just mentioned Logo.
3103000	3105000	Oh my God, I was a beast at Logo.
3105000	3108000	I remember me and my one friend had a working Tetris on Logo.
3108000	3110000	You have no idea how hard that is.
3110000	3112000	However, because the language was highly inefficient,
3112000	3114000	it would go wicked slow.
3114000	3116000	They had this running on a 1 GHz Celeron,
3116000	3118000	it was called MicroWorlds on those machines,
3118000	3120000	and the processor would be maxed out,
3120000	3123000	the fan would be going full tilt to play Tetris.
3123000	3124000	Yeah, I'm a nerd.
3124000	3127000	Other than that, I remember I would make some hardcore art with Logo,
3127000	3128000	fractals and stuff.
3128000	3129000	Good times.
3129000	3130000	Good times.
3130000	3133000	I only ever had Logo on the Commodore 64.
3133000	3135000	And for a reminder for those that weren't listening that week,
3135000	3138000	Logo is that language where you have the little turtle
3138000	3142000	and you would point, you know, pen down, up 10, right 10,
3142000	3144000	you know, and all that stuff.
3144000	3147000	And it was basically how people of a younger age
3147000	3149000	could learn programming more easily.
3149000	3151000	Why are you giving me dirty looks, Rice Princess?
3151000	3154000	I'm not giving you dirty looks, Rice Princess.
3154000	3155000	Not right then.
3155000	3157000	I'm just pooping.
3157000	3159000	That's what it looks like.
3159000	3161000	Yeah, mind your own business, Tom.
3161000	3162000	Try not to in the room.
3162000	3163000	All right.
3163000	3164000	Mailbag at OrangeLunchrated.com
3164000	3166000	if you want to send us some more email.
3166000	3168000	Skyline will be open very soon.
3168000	3171000	We have about three more stories for you guys before we get there, though.
3171000	3172000	Get your dialing fingers ready.
3172000	3174000	1-877-GAME-OLR.
3174000	3177000	Our username on Skype, OrangeLunchRadio,
3177000	3178000	right after a few more news stories.
3178000	3179000	All right.
3179000	3182000	Including one talking about Boom Boom Rocket.
3182000	3186000	Of course, we mentioned it in the past about an upcoming update.
3186000	3191000	Well, now it's live and there's a little bit of bonus with that.
3191000	3195000	Not only will you be able to play with dance mats and guitars,
3195000	3199000	but you will also be able to play five new songs,
3199000	3204000	including Cannon and Dee, Sugar High, Sting of the Bumblebee,
3204000	3209000	Explode to Joy.
3209000	3212000	That's what it sounds like Rice Princess was doing earlier in the corner.
3212000	3213000	It was.
3213000	3218000	It looks like Ein Klein rock music.
3218000	3219000	I downloaded the five new songs.
3219000	3220000	They're okay.
3220000	3222000	They are more rock influenced than Synthy,
3222000	3226000	but I wasn't that impressed because they are, again,
3226000	3228000	just classic remix songs.
3228000	3230000	And one other thing I was going to say,
3230000	3234000	I believe that you can also use the rock band drums for this as well,
3234000	3236000	if you are ever so inclined.
3236000	3237000	If you're really bored.
3237000	3238000	Yeah, really bored.
3238000	3240000	Really bored.
3240000	3246000	And basically, the five songs are free for right now until December 16th.
3246000	3249000	Then afterwards, it's going to set you back 250 Microsoft points.
3249000	3253000	So if you have a chance, get on live, get the update, get the free songs,
3253000	3255000	play it later.
3255000	3257000	Even if you don't think you'll want to play them now,
3257000	3258000	get it anyway while it's still free.
3258000	3259000	Exactly.
3259000	3261000	Free is always good.
3261000	3262000	Free is good.
3262000	3266000	Unless it's Yaris, in which case it's not good.
3266000	3268000	Free is good.
3268000	3272000	Well, I know there is so much love out there for Portal
3272000	3274000	and the Weighted Companion Cube.
3274000	3278000	And this is a whole how to do it yourself guide
3278000	3281000	to making a weighted companion cube paperweight.
3281000	3284000	It comes from the site demon-alley.com.
3284000	3286000	If you go to demon-alley.com slash WCC,
3286000	3291000	you get a whole do it yourself guide on how to make a weighted companion cube.
3291000	3295000	But I think the problem is you still have to be somewhat good at art to make this.
3295000	3299000	But if you think about it, a lot of the principles you learn here,
3299000	3301000	you could apply to a lot of different crafts.
3301000	3303000	I mean, who's to say you can make a weighted companion cube out of it?
3303000	3307000	Is that with clay or is that like styrofoam that they're carving or something?
3307000	3310000	It says the materials in it are, I quote,
3310000	3316000	Sculpey, armature wire, acrylic paints, sandpaper and or steel wool, sculpting tools,
3316000	3318000	and optional, terpenoid.
3318000	3320000	Okay, so it's clay. It's Sculpey clay.
3320000	3322000	Yeah, Sculpey is clay.
3322000	3323000	So that's what they use.
3323000	3326000	And you actually, I guess, make a cube out of it and then carve into it.
3326000	3330000	And then you bake it and then you color it, basically.
3330000	3333000	And then you feed it to your cat or make your cat look at it.
3333000	3336000	So, cute.
3336000	3338000	And Sculpey, if I remember correctly,
3338000	3341000	because my sister makes a ton of shit out of that stuff.
3341000	3343000	She loves doing that.
3343000	3345000	You can use it. You can fire it in your oven.
3345000	3347000	Frisbee says that needs to be my Christmas gift.
3347000	3351000	That might be actually a fun Christmas gift for people.
3351000	3353000	Fun.
3353000	3354000	Well, you know.
3354000	3355000	Fun-tastic.
3355000	3357000	I don't know about you guys, but I like homemade gifts.
3357000	3362000	I think they mean a lot more than something bought at Target on clearance.
3362000	3365000	Well, then I'll poop in a bag for you.
3365000	3367000	I can make a lot of those.
3367000	3369000	You guys are obscene.
3369000	3372000	Enough for all of my friends.
3372000	3373000	No, I know what you mean, Rob.
3373000	3374000	I like homemade stuff.
3374000	3377000	Let's make Arcs and Craps together for Christmas gifts.
3377000	3378000	No.
3378000	3379000	I'm going to get you a coaster for Christmas.
3379000	3380000	Don't you want one of those?
3380000	3384000	I'm going to make candy with the aqua dots in it.
3384000	3385000	Like, you know, cookies.
3385000	3387000	What are these special chips?
3387000	3388000	Aqua dots.
3388000	3389000	Oh, crap.
3389000	3390000	I'm tripping.
3390000	3391000	Want to make out.
3391000	3394000	Date-rape-licious.
3394000	3395000	Yeah, that's fun.
3395000	3396000	That's terrible.
3396000	3399000	Special Rice Krispie treats.
3399000	3402000	Oh, they're special already.
3402000	3403000	Anyways.
3403000	3408200	And then another game, as I mentioned earlier, possibly going to import Wii Fit has come
3408200	3409200	out in Japan.
3409200	3413000	And, of course, there are lines for it.
3413000	3416200	Lots of people looking to play this game, including there's going to be a lot of cool
3416200	3417200	stuff in there.
3417200	3421000	There's yoga, which looks pretty cool.
3421000	3427000	There's balance, including they have a skiing game, soccer, ski jump, some sort of, like,
3427000	3430000	monkey ball thing, and tight rope.
3430000	3434000	And then cardio, they have hula hoop, jogging, and dancing.
3434000	3435000	Awesome.
3435000	3436000	Can't wait for it.
3436000	3439000	This game is fucking expensive if you import it.
3439000	3440000	It's like $189.
3440000	3441000	Oh, my God.
3441000	3442000	Oh, Jesus.
3442000	3443000	Why so much?
3443000	3444000	Is that just because of the shipping and everything?
3444000	3445000	Import.
3445000	3448000	Because the import fees can't be that high.
3448000	3450000	High demand, so.
3450000	3452000	I still might get it, though.
3452000	3453000	Oh, my God.
3453000	3454000	You're insane.
3454000	3457000	Why can't you just wait a few months for the version to come out here in the U.S.?
3457000	3460000	Because I have bonus money to burn, and I can do it that way.
3460000	3461000	Give me money.
3461000	3463000	I'll spend it on a good cause.
3463000	3464000	I know.
3464000	3465000	Oh, you're crazy.
3465000	3466000	All right.
3466000	3471000	We are now going to go to the Skype lines at www.orangelandrado.com.
3471000	3474000	Click on interact with us, and you can get all the information on the Skype line.
3474000	3476000	Our user name is orangelandrado on Skype.
3476000	3479800	Or if that doesn't work for you, all that technical stuff is too much for you, you can
3479800	3483800	always give us a call on our 800 line, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3483800	3486300	I believe we have a call right now.
3486300	3488800	Hello, caller, are you there on Orange Land Radio?
3488800	3490800	Hello, everyone.
3490800	3491800	Hi.
3491800	3492800	Who's this?
3492800	3495800	It's Rice Princesses on behalf of Rana.
3495800	3498800	Ah, Rice Princesses, better half, or other BF.
3498800	3499800	Oh, other boyfriend.
3499800	3500800	Oh, whoa.
3500800	3501800	Oh, snap.
3501800	3502800	Ooh.
3502800	3503800	Ooh, competition.
3503800	3504800	All right.
3504800	3505800	You know she poops a lot, right?
3505800	3506800	And fart.
3506800	3507800	Don't forget that.
3507800	3509800	Rama, what's on your mind?
3509800	3511800	A couple of things.
3511800	3516800	The first thing I want to talk about is the whole GameStop charging more money for accessories.
3516800	3522000	I mean, I've seen them do this on a regular basis because when BeatMania came out, I went
3522000	3527080	over to Best Buy and they had it for like, I think it was $59, and I went over to GameStop,
3527080	3528080	they had it for $69.
3528080	3533640	I mean, normally the games are no price everywhere else, but when it comes to anything with an
3533640	3537560	accessory, they're known for charging $5 to $10 more for it.
3537560	3538840	That's why you got to shop around.
3538840	3541360	Do they price match there, out of curiosity?
3541360	3543560	No, because they don't advertise.
3543560	3544560	That's what it is.
3544560	3545560	Interesting.
3545560	3546560	Yeah.
3546560	3549680	Plus that they do a lot of sales with huge games and stuff they don't price match.
3549680	3552360	Well, that's why you want to do your research before you go out and buy.
3552360	3557520	I mean, sometimes GameStop may have the best deal, like Final Fantasy XII had that collector's
3557520	3560320	edition that was only available at GameStop that had some extra stuff with it.
3560320	3563400	You know, sometimes it's a good place to get games, but sometimes you're better off going
3563400	3564400	somewhere else.
3564400	3569400	Yeah, I did go to GameStop to get my collector's edition, but other than that, there wasn't
3569400	3570400	going to be one.
3570400	3572760	I would have gone to Best Buy.
3572760	3577840	I remember when Nintendogs first came out, I ended up going to Best Buy.
3577840	3581920	I was going to go to GameStop, but that day I found out there was a $5 gift card or something
3581920	3585440	you would get if you bought it at Best Buy.
3585440	3592560	That's why that website CheapAssGamer, that's why that website is so insanely popular, because
3592560	3595320	it's like gamers getting together to share their resources about where to find the best
3595320	3596320	deal.
3596320	3597320	Seriously.
3597320	3598320	Mm-hmm.
3598320	3599320	Whoever thought of that, honestly?
3599320	3600320	Genius idea.
3600320	3601320	Genius idea.
3601320	3602320	Wish I'd thought of it.
3602320	3603320	I'm jealous.
3603320	3604320	Anything else?
3604320	3610920	Yeah, I want to talk about this whole controversy of this guy getting fired over his honest
3610920	3614080	review of Kane & Lynch.
3614080	3618560	This is going to open up a lawsuit for wrongful termination, because I think it's really fucked
3618560	3621840	up that someone gets fired for their honest opinion on something, you know?
3621840	3622840	Mm-hmm.
3622840	3624800	I mean, is that fair, you know?
3624800	3629400	But Rama, like I said earlier in the show, we don't know for sure that's the reason yet.
3629400	3633880	And especially in the state of California, where this guy works, we have this whole law
3633880	3639440	about the whole at-will employment, where basically an employee can leave an organization
3639440	3643640	no questions asked, an employer can terminate them, essentially, no questions asked.
3643640	3646160	It's kind of to avoid those types of situations.
3646160	3651000	In order for him to claim wrongful termination, it would almost have to be like they were
3651000	3656720	setting him up in a way, or they were like, you know, trapping him into this or something,
3656720	3657720	you know?
3657720	3662240	Like, I don't know, it'd be kind of, it'd be very hard for them to pull it off.
3662240	3664040	I don't know if I'd go that far.
3664040	3667720	I think this guy's going to land a job somewhere else in the industry, even though I had no
3667720	3670800	idea who he was before this week, he's obviously very well respected.
3670800	3675200	Hell, if the people at 1UP love him so much, I think it might be kind of, you know, and
3675200	3679120	they're only a couple blocks away, I think that kind of shows you where he might go,
3679120	3680120	but who knows?
3680120	3681120	It works.
3681120	3684680	At the same time, if you're a talented writer, maybe he'll decide this whole thing hasn't
3684680	3688800	jaded from the games industry and he's going to go review movies or go write for a newspaper.
3688800	3691040	It's really up to him.
3691040	3692040	Pretty much.
3692040	3693040	I know there are other states that are like that.
3693040	3696160	I know here in New York, it's not at Will State.
3696160	3701320	They have to find a reason for you to be fired, unless you're like, during your first 30 or
3701320	3702320	90 days.
3702320	3707360	Then they can just like, oh, fired, done, you know, whatever.
3707360	3708360	Right.
3708360	3713840	Well, Rama, do you have any other comments or anything else you want to talk about tonight?
3713840	3716560	Last thing, and then I'll be on My Merry Little Way.
3716560	3719880	I'm probably one of the few people in the chat room that's really against this whole
3719880	3722920	Activision Vivendi buyout thing.
3722920	3725020	I'm just really appalled by it.
3725020	3727520	Are you sure you're not being a little tinfoil hat-ish?
3727520	3728520	No.
3728520	3729520	I know.
3729520	3731320	What's so scary about it?
3731320	3737120	It's not scary, it's just that Activision is like one of the last long-running independent
3737120	3739040	game publishers going back to the 70s.
3739040	3744680	They have like this long, decorative career of great things that they've done, and now
3744680	3747960	boom, they're part of some like multi-global unit.
3747960	3750520	It's like, look at Atari, for example.
3750520	3757120	They wanted like a good thing going, and then Infogrames bought them, renamed it to Atari,
3757120	3758400	and now look at them.
3758400	3761040	I guess that's true.
3761040	3764940	I guess maybe this is a little bit of a fear, but you know, mergers aren't necessarily always
3764940	3765940	a bad thing.
3765940	3767800	Square Enix didn't work out so bad.
3767800	3772760	I just find the Square Enix merger funny because Square is doing more profits than Enix.
3772760	3777120	Enix walks up out of nowhere with a big thing of cash, and they're like, hi, we're buying
3777120	3779120	you.
3779120	3787920	The thing is that this is not really like a merger per se, it's just that all Vivendi
3787920	3791360	has is just like a controlling stake in the company.
3791360	3794160	They haven't said it's a merger or anything, you know?
3794160	3800400	All right, well, we'll see if your tinfoil hat things come true or not.
3800400	3801600	I hope not, though.
3801600	3808920	I'm not scared yet, but you know, yeah, when we start seeing the whole, you know, the orcs
3808920	3812840	and torrents showing up in Guitar Hero, then I will be a little scared.
3812840	3813840	All right.
3813840	3815440	We'll see what happens, as you said.
3815440	3816440	All right.
3816440	3817440	Well, take care, Rama.
3817440	3818440	We've got to get some more calls.
3818440	3819440	You got it.
3819440	3820440	Bye-bye.
3820440	3821440	Bye, Rama.
3821440	3826000	7 Game O-L-R is the magic number to call, or you can give us a call on our Skype line.
3826000	3828400	Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype.
3828400	3830200	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3830200	3831200	Who's this?
3831200	3832200	It's Puppy.
3832200	3833200	Hello, Puppy.
3833200	3834200	What's on your mind, Puppy?
3834200	3843360	Oh, just a lot of stuff, but mostly just a lot of rock band issues.
3843360	3844360	What's going on?
3844360	3845360	Did your stuff break?
3845360	3853280	Yeah, my guitar got that bad strum bar problem that's been popping up with a lot of people.
3853280	3855480	I know you can fix that yourself.
3855480	3862880	Yeah, but I'm not that handy with electronics, so I'd rather not risk tinkering with it.
3862880	3863880	Or you're just lazy.
3863880	3864880	It's not lazy.
3864880	3866280	It really isn't that hard.
3866280	3870600	You basically unscrew the back, and what it is is the contact switch in there gets kind
3870600	3875400	of, I guess, turned, and all you have to do is just loosen the screw, line it back up,
3875400	3877840	and tighten it again, and then you're good to go.
3877840	3881400	That doesn't sound too hard when Loki says it.
3881400	3886400	Well, I've actually got my thumb away already, man.
3886400	3890480	Oh, your guitar's already set back, because I was going to say, if you want, if Op 11's
3890480	3893960	back up and running next week and you trust Loki enough, we could take your guitar apart
3893960	3895360	live on air and fix it.
3895360	3899560	Apparently, though, they actually are giving away free games, too, if you have your guitar
3899560	3901520	fixed, you get a free game winner.
3901520	3905240	But they haven't said what the game is yet, right?
3905240	3911520	I read that story earlier, and I think it said that people that had put their oars in
3911520	3916720	for replacement like a week ago, and it was getting delayed because of a lack of stock
3916720	3918880	for them to send out, and they were getting that free game.
3918880	3921840	Yeah, I think I heard our old buddy Bobby Black Wolf talking about that, because he's
3921840	3926080	been having problems with not just the drums, but now his guitar as well, and they sent
3926080	3929920	him an email because his drums got delayed, but then they told him it was the guitar in
3929920	3933480	the email, so he's just all kinds of confused, and I was listening to that on his show this
3933480	3936600	week, and it's just kind of unfortunate.
3936600	3940560	Makes me glad I didn't buy the whole Rock Band bundle, although I've got to say, on
3940560	3944080	my Guitar Hero 2 controller, I have the Explorer controller, which is pretty much what I'm
3944080	3947560	using to play Guitar Hero 3 in Rock Band, my yellow button is sticking a little bit,
3947560	3951240	which is pissing me off, because I don't want to buy a new controller.
3951240	3952240	But I guess that's what I get for not touching the game.
3952240	3957240	I ended up using my Guitar Hero 3 controller for my guitar, because my guitar actually
3957240	3964560	started acting up only like four or five days after I got the system, and it just got progressively
3964560	3967520	worse, and now it's to the point where the down strum doesn't work at all.
3967520	3971440	So the Guitar Hero 3 controller works on Rock Band?
3971440	3975080	My Guitar Hero 3 controller, my wireless one, does work on my system.
3975080	3978200	It's only the PlayStation 3 version that does not play nice with each other.
3978200	3979200	Oh, I thought that worked on...
3979200	3982560	Okay, maybe I'll get the Guitar Hero 3 controller then, because I do kind of want a wireless
3982560	3983560	controller.
3983560	3984560	That'll be fun.
3984560	3985560	We'll see.
3985560	3986560	That's a lot of money.
3986560	3991360	The wireless controller is nice, but I like the design for the Rock Band controller a
3991360	3992360	lot better.
3992360	3994760	I love the design on the Rock Band controller.
3994760	3997380	It's a bummer that they're having all the problems they are.
3997380	4000480	Hopefully by the time they start selling them separately next year, they can fix some of
4000480	4001480	those problems.
4001480	4002760	I really hope so.
4002760	4007160	Yeah, that would be nice, because having an extra controller would be good for parties
4007160	4008560	and whatnot.
4008560	4009560	It'd be nice.
4009560	4015040	They didn't get Guitar Hero 3, so I'm sure there's very few of those people out there
4015040	4016040	at this point.
4016040	4021960	All right, well, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, Puppy?
4021960	4027520	Not much, other than the fact that I finished Assassin's Creed and I jumped up and screamed
4027520	4028520	at the ending.
4028520	4031600	I heard the ending is kind of shocking a lot of people.
4031600	4032600	Very interesting.
4032600	4034600	I'd be very curious about that.
4034600	4038000	I wouldn't want to go into details and spoil it, but yeah.
4038000	4040000	You don't see it coming.
4040000	4041000	Interesting.
4041000	4044080	Isn't the ending supposedly kind of a trip, too?
4044080	4050600	Yeah, the ending itself is really trippy, and the way it's kind of set up is that they
4050600	4054280	basically knew ahead of time that this was going to be a trilogy.
4054280	4057000	But the beginning is weird, too, right?
4057000	4058360	Oh, yeah.
4058360	4061360	When I first started, I'm like, okay, what's going on here?
4061360	4066600	This doesn't look like a game in the Crusades.
4066600	4072120	It took me a good two or three hours into it before I started to catch the whole timeline
4072120	4073120	of the game.
4073120	4074120	All right.
4074120	4077920	Well, Puppy, we've got to let you go to get more calls, but thanks so much for the call,
4077920	4078920	all right?
4078920	4079920	All right.
4079920	4080920	Bye-bye.
4080920	4085360	If you have a call, you want to get through to us, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype.
4085360	4088520	Orange Lounge Radio is the username on Skype.
4088520	4091480	Waiting for a call to drop.
4091480	4093480	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4093480	4094480	Who's this?
4094480	4095480	Good evening, guys.
4095480	4096680	It's DMN.
4096680	4098440	Hello, DMN.
4098440	4101120	What's on your mind, my friend?
4101120	4103400	First of all, if you haven't bought Mass Effect, buy it.
4103400	4105720	It's the game of the year.
4105720	4108640	I'm waiting on pins and needles to check it out.
4108640	4109640	I'm so excited.
4109640	4112360	I'm supposed to be borrowing my friend's copy very soon, so we'll see.
4112360	4114920	I got a free copy from my buddy at Microsoft.
4114920	4118080	But anyway, that is not what I call.
4118080	4124080	I have called because I think everybody who listens to this show should thank you, Loki,
4124080	4128240	Max Dacher, and everybody else who reports news on this station because we don't get
4128240	4131240	paid to do a damn thing.
4131240	4137000	The reason I say this is the story that led into the show tonight was Jeff Gertzman getting
4137000	4142760	fired from GameSpot over his review of Kane & Lynch, which was an acceptable review.
4142760	4148360	Everybody gave that review at the most a seven across the board.
4148360	4155240	The fact that Eidos dropped their advertising, which then I don't know what happened, but
4155240	4162880	it forced him to get fired, I think that's the most lowest unobjected thing I've ever
4162880	4165920	seen a media publication do.
4165920	4171920	But again, do you think you might be filling in some gaps with hearsay, though?
4171920	4176560	That's the only thing I'm kind of challenging here is that, yes, we know Eidos pulled the
4176560	4181520	bad campaign, but did they necessarily do it because of the bad review itself?
4181520	4185000	Did they maybe do it because of all this fallout that happened because of it?
4185000	4187360	Well, I mean, not up to then.
4187360	4194480	I was going on Eidos' forums this morning, and I saw people telling Eidos shame on them
4194480	4198400	for doing what they did, and those threads were getting locked and deleted, which means
4198400	4204640	I think Eidos knows a little more than they want to say about the situation.
4204640	4207440	And I just hate the gaming companies being so intimidating.
4207440	4212200	If I recall, we had Beautiful Katamari.
4212200	4218400	We had an exclusive release date, and we were intimidated by Namco to pull that, because
4218400	4221960	I want to say, what was it, 1UP?
4221960	4226600	Apparently bought the rights to that, which I think is retarded.
4226600	4229240	I don't think anybody should ever have to buy news.
4229240	4231320	I don't think anybody should have to.
4231320	4235880	Companies should not be involved only when it's purchasing games and or the gaming review
4235880	4236880	magazines.
4236880	4242640	I don't think that the companies should be in bed with the gaming review magazines ever.
4242640	4247680	It's going to create bad situations like this, it's going to blow things wide open, it's
4247680	4249400	going to make a lot of these publishers look bad.
4249400	4250680	Eidos has lost my business.
4250680	4252840	I was going to buy Conan and I Boring Adventures.
4252840	4255280	I'm taking my $50 and going elsewhere with that now.
4255280	4261840	As we referenced earlier in the show, and you do definitely bring up a source subject
4261840	4267440	around these parts, but it's a fair comparison, so fine.
4267440	4271800	It just goes to show you that there's a lot of shady things that go on behind the scenes,
4271800	4277520	and that's why a lot of this corporate stuff has a very sour taste in my mouth a lot of
4277520	4279160	the times.
4279160	4286120	If anything, I'm very interested to see whether it be mob mentality or not, there's going
4286120	4291800	to be a lot of people that are going to open themselves up to getting the news from gamers
4291800	4294160	who aren't necessarily paid to do it.
4294160	4298320	I'm very interested to see where that takes us, the independent folks.
4298320	4304020	I would honestly say if this were to happen to Orange Lounge Radio, the same situation
4304020	4309200	with an editor, I think a lot of the listeners here would go away.
4309200	4314280	I think it would look bad on Orange Lounge Radio, and that's why I'm glad we're independent.
4314280	4318280	That's why I'm glad we're not too coerced by money.
4318280	4321960	Crouere-We're the type of people that would have come on air and said, can you believe
4321960	4325420	Eidos wants us to pull the ad campaign over this review?
4325420	4327720	We kicked them to the curb.
4327720	4332760	I guess that's just the difference, but we don't pretend to be a money-making corporation
4332760	4333760	either.
4333760	4334760	We're not making money.
4334760	4335760	That's kind of the sad thing.
4335760	4336760	We're making tons of money.
4336760	4337760	You just don't know about it.
4337760	4338760	Really?
4338760	4339760	Where's my cut?
4339760	4344760	I blow all of it on crack.
4344760	4348280	DMN, anything else you want to share with the listeners?
4348280	4351600	We've got to get some more calls, though.
4351600	4353240	It's raining like hell in Seattle.
4353240	4354240	Have a good night.
4354240	4355240	All right.
4355240	4357240	Thank you for the weather report, DMN.
4357240	4358240	I appreciate it.
4358240	4361880	I'm going to log you out.
4361880	4364840	That was an even better report than the forecast channel, to be honest.
4364840	4365840	We've got more calls.
4365840	4366840	We're ringing off the hook tonight.
4366840	4368080	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.
4368080	4369080	Who's this?
4369080	4370080	Raven's Dolphin.
4370080	4371080	How are you tonight, Sky?
4371080	4372080	Hello.
4372080	4373080	I'm okay.
4373080	4374760	How are you, Raven's Dolphin?
4374760	4375760	I'm okay.
4375760	4380000	I just want to shed some more light on the Gershman trial, or not Gershman trial, the
4380000	4381000	Gershman thing.
4381000	4382000	Yes.
4382000	4383000	Not a trial yet.
4383000	4384000	Who knows?
4384000	4385000	Jumping the gun.
4385000	4386000	See?
4386000	4387000	Hold on a minute, Raven's Dolphin.
4387000	4388000	See?
4388000	4390280	This is exactly what happens when you play the Internet game of telephone.
4390280	4394040	Now suddenly on a blog, it's going to show up, oh my God, the Gershman firing case goes
4394040	4395040	to trial.
4395040	4396160	I heard it on OLR.
4396160	4397480	It's true.
4397480	4398480	It's not true.
4398480	4399480	It's not true.
4399480	4400480	I'm right.
4400480	4401480	No one will believe that.
4401480	4402480	I forgot.
4402480	4403480	That's right.
4403480	4407300	No one believes the poo that falls out of our mouths every Sunday night on this program,
4407300	4410200	if the corporate sites are to be deplete.
4410200	4413280	Anyway, what's on your mind, Raven's Dolphin?
4413280	4414520	I'm going to shed some light.
4414520	4417000	So basically, I did some investigation work.
4417000	4421520	So I usually listen to their podcast, I'm going to withhold their name, and he wasn't
4421520	4422520	on it.
4422520	4423520	He's always on it.
4423520	4424520	He wasn't on it.
4424520	4429840	So I'm believing that he got fired before the podcast went live.
4429840	4430840	And that's pretty shady.
4430840	4433180	And they didn't even mention he went on vacation or anything.
4433180	4435020	They just said nothing.
4435020	4436840	So that's pretty shady right there.
4436840	4439040	When does that particular show come out?
4439040	4440160	Wednesday.
4440160	4443300	That's the day supposedly he was canned.
4443300	4444400	Let's use the word allegedly.
4444400	4445400	That makes us sound professional.
4445400	4446400	But they recorded it.
4446400	4450200	Apparently, Wednesday was the day he was locked out of the office and his boxes were thrown
4450200	4452960	out on the curb.
4452960	4453960	That just sounds wrong.
4453960	4458120	Even, you know, it's going to feel like, I'm going to feel dumb if this happens when he
4458120	4463040	goes like, well, it wasn't over Kane and Lynch or he had some girl in the background fondling
4463040	4464320	in the GameSpot office.
4464320	4465320	I'm going to feel bad.
4465320	4468360	Now, see, that would be awesome if that was...
4468360	4470240	The man gets a raise.
4470240	4473120	That's the kind of teamwork I like to see here.
4473120	4478080	This guy was having an illicit affair with somebody else in the office and poor Idus
4478080	4482240	gets thrown under the bus over this whole thing.
4482240	4487840	I mean, the gaming community would owe these guys one hell of an apology if that came to
4487840	4488840	light.
4488840	4489840	Never going to happen.
4489840	4490840	Yeah, I know.
4490840	4492200	It's just funny to imagine these things.
4492200	4493200	I don't know.
4493200	4494200	I live in a weird world.
4494200	4496200	Anyway, sorry, Raven's Dolphin.
4496200	4501240	I usually follow GameSpot for years and this guy, I trust the guy, you know, he gives a
4501240	4505440	pretty good review and just seeing him on the curve and, you know, and a lot of people
4505440	4508180	are boycotting the network now.
4508180	4513880	They're canceling their descriptions to GameSpot and I kind of support that.
4513880	4521400	DMN wants to know, did the podcasters over on GameSpot sound morose?
4521400	4523560	They just went on with their normal lives.
4523560	4525980	They just went like, well, they didn't say anything.
4525980	4532160	They just went like, we were going on with our podcast and it just felt so weird.
4532160	4535840	Felt like they were hiding something and they were.
4535840	4538800	Maybe dark soccer really isn't in Alabama, Raven's Dolphin.
4538800	4541400	Was she a lawyer?
4541400	4542400	No, she is.
4542400	4543400	Of course she is.
4543400	4544400	Come on.
4544400	4545400	We would never do that.
4545400	4546840	But yeah, it's just funny.
4546840	4548560	Being buried in Alabama.
4548560	4549560	Never.
4549560	4554280	I'm surprised she hasn't called in, but she's probably sleeping if she flew back tonight.
4554280	4560440	But anyway, yeah, it's a lot of answers to come next week.
4560440	4564360	I think this is going to be one of the hot coffees of 2007.
4564360	4568480	I think we're going to see this pop up again before we know it.
4568480	4572680	I can tell you this, as a person that likes GameSpot and I'm the person that I always
4572680	4574200	go to GameSpot for my things.
4574200	4580160	I always reference to them and this is kind of just, I just can't just go there anymore
4580160	4582240	and trust them anymore.
4582240	4583240	I respect them.
4583240	4588760	I respect Jeff for giving an honest review of the game, even though that it got pulled.
4588760	4593980	We don't know until Tuesday, so I respect him for that and I hope he gets a better job.
4593980	4601160	You know, I got to say, GameSpot was one of my more, if I was going to go look at corp
4601160	4606520	sites, it was probably one of the ones I thought was better written.
4606520	4608640	It had a pretty good written.
4608640	4611360	It was very professional in a lot of the stuff I read.
4611360	4615840	Some of the corp sites feel a little unprofessional to me, but that particular one felt professional
4615840	4617680	in some of the things.
4617680	4621160	Obviously, when we were in the news a lot, because of the beautiful Katamari and the
4621160	4625040	Konami thing, we saw what some of these sites were writing about us and I thought GameSpot
4625040	4626040	was probably the most fair.
4626040	4627040	There they were.
4627040	4632520	They put it in the rumor control instead of the other, like, they mentioned your name.
4632520	4633520	That's the thing.
4633520	4634520	Interesting.
4634520	4635520	Interesting.
4635520	4636520	All right.
4636520	4637760	Well, Ravenstaufen, any other quick thoughts?
4637760	4639440	I'm echoing, so we've got to let you go here.
4639440	4640440	Oh, I'm sorry.
4640440	4641440	Bye-bye.
4641440	4642440	All right.
4642440	4647200	If you want to give us a call, we'll take a couple more calls, 877-GAME-OLR, username
4647200	4648520	on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
4648520	4649520	Hello.
4649520	4650520	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
4650520	4651520	Who's this?
4651520	4652520	Hey, guys.
4652520	4653520	What's up?
4653520	4654520	This is Footy Monster.
4654520	4655520	Hello, Footy Monster.
4655520	4656520	What's up?
4656520	4657520	Hi, Footy Monster.
4657520	4658520	Nothing much.
4658520	4659520	Special hello from Rice Princess over there.
4659520	4660520	I haven't talked to you in a while.
4660520	4661520	Geez.
4661520	4662520	All right.
4662520	4663520	What's up?
4663520	4664520	I like your avatar on Skype, by the way.
4664520	4667840	It's some girl with big boobies.
4667840	4669800	Of course, boobs are the win.
4669800	4673840	I think this is going to star in Rice Princess' upcoming game, Boobies and Pandas.
4673840	4674840	All right.
4674840	4676840	What's in your mind, Footy?
4676840	4684520	Well, of course, it has to be this whole thing with GameSpot, and here's two things.
4684520	4689920	First off, when people are actually looking for reviews, they don't go to one place alone.
4689920	4693880	They go to all of the places, and they make an evaluation and a general consensus of what
4693880	4698200	they think they want to think of the game after they read all the reviews, not just
4698200	4699200	one review.
4699200	4700200	That's the first thing.
4700200	4701200	That's the second thing.
4701200	4702200	Are you sure?
4702200	4703200	No.
4703200	4704200	Are you sure?
4704200	4707080	Because some of those people who are paying for that site and stuff, I don't know.
4707080	4708080	Okay.
4708080	4709640	Here's what you guys need to do if you're looking at reviews.
4709640	4711240	If you're going to spend 60 bucks, if you're going to spend 60 bucks...
4711240	4714920	Don't just look at the numbers that they give the game.
4714920	4719120	Just look at the pros and cons that they list.
4719120	4720120	That's another thing.
4720120	4721120	That's another thing.
4721120	4724960	People also, that's my second reason, it's like they were pissed, and whatever happened
4724960	4729040	happened because of the number and not because of what was written, because I'm sure that
4729040	4733920	what he wrote is the same thing that everybody else wrote.
4733920	4738160	The problem with that is that they were an advertiser, but also the number didn't fit
4738160	4743440	with the PR department, which is usually the problem with everything in this gaming industry
4743440	4746440	that we're in.
4746440	4750960	We're making this sound like, whatever, this is a huge deal, but in truth, it happens
4750960	4751960	every day.
4751960	4759720	It also happens that this guy thought to do it this way, just for, I don't know, it
4759720	4763640	just happened this way, and this is the guy that fell down this line.
4763640	4768360	It's like they tried to make an example out of him.
4768360	4769880	I don't know.
4769880	4772880	I think there's so much more to come on this in the upcoming weeks.
4772880	4775680	I feel like some of the gaps eventually will have to be filled in.
4775680	4777360	This guy's going to talk at some point.
4777360	4781880	It'll be very interesting to see what he has to say.
4781880	4789320	Actually, someone did comment on the joystick story that they wrote on this thing, and apparently
4789320	4795320	someone from inside GameSpot, and the guys actually said how the process went, and apparently
4795320	4799280	the management in GameSpot changed, and now it's just a bunch of suits, and apparently
4799280	4801880	this kind of thing is going to keep happening in GameSpot.
4801880	4806360	Well, I don't know, but after this huge backlash, money rules everything, and if it's
4806360	4810800	true that people are canceling their accounts not just by the hundreds, but by the thousands,
4810800	4815140	then there are a board of directors that are over those suits, and those suits will be
4815140	4819000	out very soon.
4819000	4820000	Are you sure about that?
4820000	4822520	I mean, the thing is that suits are there for a reason.
4822520	4823520	That's the reason why they bring them in.
4823520	4825560	Money changes everything.
4825560	4826740	Remember that old song?
4826740	4829760	If it's true that people are canceling their accounts, and this is their...
4829760	4832720	I mean, if it's like five people...
4832720	4836440	Sometimes a lot of people threaten to do things, but they don't actually do it, but if it's
4836440	4841880	true that people are canceling their accounts en masse, that money goes to pay these people's
4841880	4848400	paychecks, and management will be the first thing to go if this company starts losing
4848400	4849400	money and they have to lay off.
4849400	4851000	I don't want to see GameSpot go under.
4851000	4855400	I don't, but already they lost credibility, and not the editors.
4855400	4858460	I mean, the editors themselves, if they go somewhere else, they're going to have their
4858460	4863960	credibility back, but if they go, if they stay there like scaredy cats, and you will
4863960	4868360	never know if their writing is their honest opinion or something that they're doing just
4868360	4869360	because they don't want to lose their jobs.
4869360	4871400	Well, I was going to say, they may not have a choice.
4871400	4873360	They may have families and stuff.
4873360	4875600	The job market's not that easy sometimes.
4875600	4880920	Oh, I mean, trust me, I understand that, but the thing is we as gamers and as consumers
4880920	4883000	who are about to spend whatever our money...
4883000	4887420	Okay, not me because I hired everything, but people who actually pay for stuff, they want
4887420	4892040	to know what they're paying for, so it's not fair for them to buy crap because you don't
4892040	4897520	know if they're lying to you when they're supposed to be telling you the objective truth.
4897520	4900960	For some reason, there's a reason why it's journalism.
4900960	4907820	It's a niche, but it's journalism, a kind of journalism, so they're supposed to be objective,
4907820	4914240	and if money's in the way, I forgot who was it called that said that, but if money's in
4914240	4916000	the way, then forget it.
4916000	4920400	The whole thing gets screwed, and what we're looking at is everything's going to be game
4920400	4925000	of the year material because we never know who's going to be paying for the paycheck
4925000	4928480	at the end of the month.
4928480	4931120	One more thing, then we've got to wrap up and let you go.
4931120	4936440	I'm looking here at Dr. 3ev, or whatever this guy's name is in chat.
4936440	4937440	I can't pronounce his name.
4937440	4938440	I'm sorry.
4938440	4943400	It says, �Footy Monster takes payola for RPG reviews.� Are these accusations true?
4943400	4944800	I wish they were.
4944800	4950360	Trust me, the minute it happens, I'm buying myself out the receipt.
4950360	4951680	I'm 60.
4951680	4953160	Just know it.
4953160	4954160	So far, no.
4954160	4957200	About that, guys, you need to check out The Witcher.
4957200	4958200	Such a good game.
4958200	4959200	I'll tell you.
4959200	4960200	What system is this on?
4960200	4961200	PC only.
4961200	4962200	What's PC?
4962200	4963200	What?
4963200	4964200	It's PC only?
4964200	4965200	It's PC only.
4965200	4966680	Yeah, but I don't have a great setup.
4966680	4971220	I have a really crappy video card, like 60-buck video card, and it works acceptably good in
4971220	4973880	medium detail, but it's such a fun game.
4973880	4975880	I mean, obligatory plug.
4975880	4977960	Check for the review on The Ultimate Quest.
4977960	4978960	What's it called?
4978960	4979960	The Witcher?
4979960	4980960	Yeah.
4980960	4981960	The Witcher.
4981960	4984960	It's based on some Polish guy's books, and it's actually pretty good.
4984960	4985960	You've heard of this, Loki?
4985960	4986960	Yeah.
4986960	4987960	It sounds like a scary game.
4987960	4988960	I guess.
4988960	4989960	Interesting.
4989960	4990960	All right.
4990960	4991960	I'll check it out, Footy.
4991960	4994520	It's not a scary game at all, but it has sex, which is good.
4994520	4995520	All right.
4995520	4996520	Sex is great.
4996520	4997520	I'm there.
4997520	4998520	All right, Footy.
4998520	4999520	We've got to let you go.
4999520	5000520	Take care, buddy.
5000520	5001520	All right.
5001520	5002520	Take care, guys.
5002520	5003520	Bye-bye.
5003520	5004520	You too.
5004520	5005520	Bye, Footy.
5005520	5006520	Bye.
5006520	5008280	I think this is going to do it for calls tonight, because we're looking at two long segments
5008280	5009280	tonight.
5009280	5014600	The short show last week has made this show very large this week, so we've got to go around
5014600	5018440	and start getting everybody's final thoughts, but not before we get some last-minute stories.
5018440	5023160	Loki, do you have any last-minute stories for us tonight, by chance?
5023160	5024160	No.
5024160	5025160	Wow.
5025160	5026160	That's a first.
5026160	5027160	It's a slow week.
5027160	5028160	Yeah.
5028160	5032160	Well, I mean, there's been a couple huge bombshells, like, of course, the GameSpot thing and everything
5032160	5036160	and the Activision, if anything, but then, yeah, the rest of it's been kind of a quiet
5036160	5037160	week.
5037160	5038160	Oh.
5038160	5039160	We'll be back for February.
5039160	5040160	Oh.
5040160	5041160	Really?
5041160	5048520	PlayStation 3, 360 Wii, PlayStation 2, maybe, Karaoke Revolution, so.
5048520	5049520	Mmm.
5049520	5050520	Interesting.
5050520	5053040	That's going to be very interesting, considering harmonics and Konami aren't in bed together
5053040	5054040	anymore, are they?
5054040	5055800	I don't know.
5055800	5056800	I would like...
5056800	5057800	They could still make it, though, without them.
5057800	5060000	I would like to see American Idol on the 360, though.
5060000	5063160	That would be kind of fun, because I like the Karaoke Revolution series.
5063160	5064160	Yeah.
5064160	5065160	Very cool.
5065160	5066160	I hope Universe 2 doesn't suck.
5066160	5067160	I hope not either.
5067160	5068160	I hope not either.
5068160	5069160	We'll see.
5069160	5070160	Yeah.
5070160	5074280	Uh, Rice Princess, any last-minute stories from you?
5074280	5075920	Have you been keeping tabs on the game industry?
5075920	5076920	I just pooped.
5076920	5077920	Yeah, great.
5077920	5078920	That's great.
5078920	5079920	Thank you very much.
5079920	5080920	You're welcome.
5080920	5081920	All right.
5081920	5082920	Oh, yeah.
5082920	5083920	Disney Channel.
5083920	5084920	Next.
5084920	5085920	When's that coming out?
5085920	5086920	January.
5086920	5087920	Oh.
5087920	5088920	All right.
5088920	5089920	If at all.
5089920	5090920	It keeps getting delayed.
5090920	5091920	All right.
5091920	5093280	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
5093280	5096320	Rice Princess, thanks so much for being here tonight, even if you didn't contribute much
5096320	5097320	besides your poop jokes.
5097320	5098660	No, I'm just kidding.
5098660	5100560	We always appreciate having you here.
5100560	5101560	Thank you.
5101560	5102560	You're welcome.
5102560	5104560	Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
5104560	5105560	No.
5105560	5106560	Okay.
5106560	5107560	No.
5107560	5109040	You contribute so much to this program.
5109040	5110040	I appreciate it.
5110040	5111040	Thanks.
5111040	5113200	Loki, any final thoughts from you?
5113200	5114920	I just have a lot of games to play this week.
5114920	5117800	Probably won't get to most of them.
5117800	5123680	My final thought is I need to charge my iPod so I can listen to lots of podcasts tomorrow
5123680	5127680	at work because I'm writing tomorrow so I want to be able to listen to podcasts and
5127680	5128680	music.
5128680	5129680	Good idea.
5129680	5131240	That sounds good to me.
5131240	5132240	All right.
5132240	5135240	I need a new job.
5135240	5137440	I hope your employers don't listen to this program.
5137440	5138440	They do.
5138440	5139440	Whatever.
5139440	5142960	I don't think my manager knows how to operate a podcast anyways, to be honest.
5142960	5145880	I know I have coworkers who listen to this show sometimes.
5145880	5146880	They like it.
5146880	5149920	No, but seriously though, I mean, I need a new job.
5149920	5151280	This doesn't pay enough.
5151280	5154880	The problem is though in the area that we're at, like since we don't live in the Bay Area,
5154880	5157200	you know, there's not like game companies all over Sacramento.
5157200	5159400	The Bay Area is a highly competitive job market too.
5159400	5160400	Yeah.
5160400	5162120	Hey, I hear there's a couple job openings at GameSpot.
5162120	5165400	That's in the Bay Area though, see?
5165400	5166400	I don't want to be an editor.
5166400	5167400	You could take the train over there.
5167400	5168400	I can't write.
5168400	5169720	You could take the train.
5169720	5170720	I can hardly see.
5170720	5172920	Can you imagine Loki's game reviews on GameSpot?
5172920	5174960	Oh my God, this game sucks.
5174960	5176160	There wasn't enough boobs.
5176160	5177160	No.
5177160	5183440	I would be objective, but you know, I just honestly, when we're talking about games during
5183440	5187560	our game of the week and stuff like that, I can't go into an in-depth review about stuff
5187560	5193800	because honestly, I don't play a lot of stuff and I don't have the free time to like review
5193800	5195400	a game every week or something like that.
5195400	5197960	I don't have enough time to play anything.
5197960	5200080	You barely have enough time to do this damn show.
5200080	5201080	I do.
5201080	5206200	I barely have enough time to do this damn show, but no, I don't know.
5206200	5212080	I would love to do a review show and one of the things I'm planning on doing with my money
5212080	5219080	they get for my bonus is building a new computer and going to have a nice new video card that's
5219080	5223440	going to hopefully have something that I can import component video to so I can do stuff
5223440	5225280	like that, video editing and stuff.
5225280	5226280	Nice.
5226280	5230600	I just have to have the time to do all that stuff too because, you know.
5230600	5231600	Alright.
5231600	5237200	Well, anyhow, I guess we'll see what the future holds in 2008 for Loki and, you know, all
5237200	5239080	the rest of us here at Orange Launch Radio.
5239080	5243320	Meantime, thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting by listening
5243320	5244320	to Orange Launch Radio.
5244320	5245320	We really appreciate it.
5245320	5249220	If you like what you heard, please tell two friends about our station because then when
5249220	5254440	everybody tells two people, slowly we take over the world and if you don't have any friends,
5254440	5258680	I'm sorry to hear that first of all, you can make some friends on our forums at orangelaunchradio.com,
5258680	5261800	but you can also leave us a review on iTunes.
5261800	5265040	That would be fair as well because we need some more five star reviews on iTunes.
5265040	5266600	We haven't gotten any in a while.
5266600	5267600	It kind of makes me sad.
5267600	5268600	Aww.
5268600	5269600	Yeah.
5269600	5270600	Make me happy.
5270600	5271600	Leave some more five star reviews this week.
5271600	5272600	That's it guys.
5272600	5273600	Thank you so much for tuning in.
5273600	5274600	Have a great week.
