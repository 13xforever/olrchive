4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,800
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,600
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this Sunday evening,

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,400
and I just want to remind you guys, you know, there are some more perks that you get when listening live.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,500
You know, we try to deliver a quality show to those of you guys who listen on the podcast,

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,300
vlogcast, Zooncast, whatever the hell you call it, whatever you're listening to right now.

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:41,000
But there's more perks when you listen live. We do tape on Sunday nights live at 6 o'clock Pacific time.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
All the details are on our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,700
We have a live 365 stream and a video stream through Operator 11,

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,900
and we were just showing off a new game on the Wii called No More Heroes during the bonus segment.

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,700
So those are the kind of perks you get only when you listen live.

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,500
But we still try to show a lot of love to those of you guys who listen to us on the podcast,

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,500
because we realize not everybody can be here Sunday night.

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,700
But you can try. You should try, at least once. See what it's like.

17
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,700
All right, let's get back into the gaming news then, since we're already in the second half of the show.

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,500
All right. Anyways, let's see here.

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:23,500
Super Smash Bros. coming out over here, you know, obviously it was delayed a little bit.

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,900
Previously it was supposed to be out this year, now it's February.

21
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,700
Not so for Europe, at least. You're going to have to wait a little bit longer.

22
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,300
And they haven't really said exactly when, but it's going to be Quarter 2 of next year.

23
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,900
So, you know, I don't know. That's not good, I guess.

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,500
But at least you're not waiting until Christmas of next year.

25
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,700
But aren't the Brits kind of used to getting screwed like this in a way, you know?

26
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:56,300
Maybe. But here's the thing, though. I don't really see what they... I mean, other than changing the screen resolution stuff that it renders at,

27
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,300
you're not really localizing it for Europe, so...

28
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:04,900
That's what I want to know. Like, are they having to, you know, produce extra copies and that takes so freaking long?

29
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,900
Or what is it? What causes things to be so slow? I don't get it.

30
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,300
I guess it's just, you know, changing some of the programming.

31
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,900
Because, I mean, if you think about it, a lot of the games that they get in Europe we don't get over here for a while, so...

32
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,100
Yeah, that kind of sucks.

33
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,700
MacMan says Europe, the shaft of the gaming world.

34
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,100
You know, I know we have quite a few people over there to listen. I'm sure aren't happy about this.

35
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,100
They've already gotten some games we haven't had over here yet.

36
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:30,100
Like, they have Endless Ocean already, which, you know, I'm sure given the opportunity they would say,

37
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,100
Fuck Endless Ocean, let's get Super Smash Brothers.

38
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,700
But, you know, they do get a few games before we do, so... I don't know.

39
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,100
RossDlut in chat says, Loki, menus and stuff need to be made in other languages. Any announcer?

40
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:52,100
Well, true. But, I mean, still, though, you know, for, like, some of the territories, they can release it in English-speaking territories or stuff like that.

41
00:02:52,100 --> 00:03:00,500
And, also, a lot of the games, like, you know, Excite Truck and that kind of thing, when they were putting them out, they develop them for, like, usually it's English, Spanish, and French, I think.

42
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,500
Especially, all the Nintendo titles seem to be English, Spanish, and French even when they come out over here.

43
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,500
Because, you know, Canada and Mexico, you need French for Canada and Spanish for Mexico, so, you know, it's kind of like a region.

45
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,900
I wouldn't think that that would, I mean, hold them back, really, too much.

46
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:23,900
Alright, well, sorry Europe, it looks like you're going to get screwed there, but, you know, we'll tell you how fun it is.

47
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,300
No, I'm just kidding, that's so mean.

48
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:36,900
Alright, one, I guess, interesting kind of piece of news is that Nintendo is kind of, in a way, fessed up that they're not able to meet the needs of the Wii demand that's out there.

49
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:43,900
You know how the Wii seems to be, once again, for the second year in a row, the hot holiday toy that everybody's dying to get.

50
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:53,300
Nintendo has decided to pull ads for its Wii console, and this actually, this story is out of the UK, actually, although I do believe it affects everybody,

51
00:03:53,300 --> 00:04:01,300
that Nintendo's actually going to be redistributing the commercials that they had scheduled up until Christmas through the first quarter of 2008.

52
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:09,900
A Nintendo spokesman said, quote, we have been running the campaign all year round, but we want to take a responsible stance this Christmas and not fuel demand.

53
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,900
An ad industry insider said, quote, you can tell what's been happening.

54
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,900
They have a lot of spots on TV, but I'm seeing more ads for the DS than I am for the Wii, so you can draw your own conclusions.

55
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,300
So maybe that some of these ads got shifted to Nintendo DS ads, who knows.

56
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:31,300
Production has been stepped up to 1.8 million units a month, and Nintendo still cannot meet the demand.

57
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:37,300
According to RasteelUT in chat, it says eBay vultures are the only people buying the systems.

58
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,300
Sad but true, there probably are quite a few of those folks buying it.

59
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,300
RasteelUT also says software sales are still pathetic.

60
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,300
You know why? I have a theory. Why?

61
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,300
Because most people that are buying that system are perfectly content with Wii Sports.

62
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,300
A lot of people are buying this just for Wii Sports.

63
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:59,300
Especially when you start to look at the older crowd and the more casual gamers.

64
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:05,300
That's the enabling game for the Nintendo Wii, and when it comes with the system, people don't think they need anything else.

65
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:12,300
I mean, back in the day when we were buying 8-bit Nintendo systems with Super Mario Brothers and Duck Hunt, did we buy another game to go with it?

66
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,300
Not necessarily, not always. Many kids found just that pack under their tree for Christmas.

67
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,300
You know what I mean?

68
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:26,300
Granted, I would also humor probably the implied statement there that there's not a lot of must-have software on the Wii right now outside of the Wii like Mario Galaxy.

69
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:33,300
Well, there's a lot of good games out there, but there's a lot more really crappy games, and it's really hard to tell.

70
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,300
But at the same time, those really crappy games kind of cater to the 7 and 8 year olds, you know what I mean?

71
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,300
Like all the movie tie-in games, like Happy Feet and stuff.

72
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:47,300
That ties into the child audience, that there are a lot of kids out there getting Wiis.

73
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,300
Yeah.

74
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:59,300
Anyhow, that's good, though, that Nintendo at least is not going to be making it even worse by continuing to advertise it on TV and reminding people who may not have thought to run out and get one otherwise.

75
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:05,300
So if you still haven't gotten a Wii for whatever reason, maybe it'll be a little bit easier?

76
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,300
Little bit?

77
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,300
But probably not. You probably want to get online in the stock inventory.

78
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,300
Well, some of us waited in line.

79
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:19,300
That's true. I bet all the Nintendo fanboys and fangirls waited in line day one anyway, and they're just looking at this and laughing.

80
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,300
Some of us just didn't care to buy a Wii.

81
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,300
That's true, and some people are like, eh, fuck Wii.

82
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,300
Oh, I should tell you, my mom told me she wanted a Wii.

83
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:39,300
You know, you're not the first person to tell me that story, which is, I'm just kind of saying like, you know, I'm hearing a lot of people, their parents are wanting Wiis and getting into that, but it's the sports game.

84
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,300
I know a parent that wants it for Wii bowling because she likes to bowl.

85
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:48,300
I thought it was funny because my mom almost played my old Nintendo more than I did.

86
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,300
And, you know, actually she probably played it as much as I did.

87
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:59,300
She wouldn't admit to it, but my mom was a gamer once, and she had her Game Boy and played lots of Breakout.

88
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:05,300
But, you know, now hearing my mom say, I want a Wii, can you get me a Wii?

89
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,300
I was like, I don't have $300, but we'll see.

90
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,300
Pika Uno has a very interesting perspective.

91
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,300
He's one of our listeners that lives over in Japan, and he says, I just bought one for my friend in the UK.

92
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,300
There are plenty of Wiis in Japan.

93
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,300
So, kind of interesting.

94
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,300
I wonder what effect that's going to have, though, if you bought one for your friend in the UK, because aren't the TVs different?

95
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,300
Yeah, Japan's NTSC.

96
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,300
I'm sure there's some converter.

97
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,300
Well, I mean, if you have an HDTV, it's moot anyway.

98
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:44,300
But for our friends in the UK, speaking of which, there is a couple of things that are out on the Virtual Console now.

99
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:49,300
We have Light Crusader, which is one of Treasure's games.

100
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,300
I love Treasure.

101
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,300
Treasure gave us Silhouette Mirage.

102
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:00,300
But this was one of their Mega Drive releases, which over here was the Genesis.

103
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:07,300
And it's also coming out with, I do believe, Rolling Thunder 2.

104
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:17,300
And also coming out is Cybernator, which was called Assault Suits Vulcan in Japan.

105
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,300
Pika Uno wanted to clarify something, speaking of the whole UK and how he's sending one to his friend.

106
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:31,300
He said modern PAL TVs are NTSC-compatible, which I guess that explains that. That's kind of cool.

107
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:42,300
But he says 99% of NTSC TVs are not PAL-compatible, which he discovered when he went over to Japan from London, where he was originally at.

108
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,300
Isn't High Def supposed to be all the same no matter where you are?

109
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,300
It is.

110
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,300
Then we need to get on that quick.

111
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,300
Because these whole differing TV formats make things very frustrating.

112
00:08:53,300 --> 00:09:02,300
Well, just for example, when I was really big into my Gorillaz fandom, I was importing some of the DVD CDs.

113
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,300
And I would just run it through my laptop to the TV and no problem.

114
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,300
Yeah, so there you go.

115
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:19,300
Anyways, let's see here. So for the US, you've got some good stuff coming out on the Virtual Console.

116
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:26,300
Including, we talked about it last week, Pokemon Snap. That's going to be coming out.

117
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,300
Baseball Stars 2 for the Neo Geo.

118
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,300
And also Ghosts and Goblins. That was on the NES.

119
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:41,300
Hooray for Pokemon Snap! I can't wait to download this and play this and send all of you pictures of Pokemon I take.

120
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:47,300
Which means you, and you, and are you on my Wiilet? You don't have a Wii. Well then screw you.

121
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,300
I'm going to definitely actually give that a download, but I won't say I'll be downloading Ghosts and Goblins.

122
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:57,300
Because we actually broke out our Saturn for our annual tradition and Dan was playing Capcom Collection Volume 2.

123
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,300
Nice.

124
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,300
The game is too damn hard.

125
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,300
It is too damn hard.

126
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,300
I will not be downloading it.

127
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,300
Because guess what? You play all the way through it and guess what? You have to play all the way through it again to beat the game.

128
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,300
And then what do you get? Congratulations, the story is happy end.

129
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,300
You beat, you kicked Satan's butt.

130
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,300
Well anyway, I will definitely check out Pokemon Snap, so I'm excited about that.

131
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,300
This is something I'm kind of curious to check out as well.

132
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:27,300
A Ninja Party game is coming to the Nintendo Wii and the Nintendo DS in March of next year.

133
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,300
Ninja Reflex is the name of the game.

134
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:36,300
It's being published by EA, but also a company called Nunchuck Games.

135
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,300
How appropriate.

136
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,300
It's being developed by Sanzaru Games, which is a brand new studio in California.

137
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,300
It's seven former Activision developers.

138
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,300
And what a great first game to be putting out.

139
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,300
A game all about ninjas.

140
00:10:50,300 --> 00:11:02,300
EA notes that Ninja Reflexes will center around doing challenges and testing your reaction time, which is very appropriate for a ninja game.

141
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,300
Here's a quote.

142
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,300
Millisecond precision.

143
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,300
Sounds like fun.

144
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,300
We'll see.

145
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,300
I hope you can calibrate it or something to give it that extra precision.

146
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,300
We'll see.

147
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,300
That just sounds sort of nifty cool.

148
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,300
We'll see.

149
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,300
I'll check it out.

150
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:27,300
This is fairly, fairly interesting stuff for anyone who has a Wii.

151
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:42,300
If you join Club Nintendo and you would use your previous Nintendo website login, you can buy Wii points for four stars for every Wii point using your old stars from the Nintendo Club.

152
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,300
And this is actually nintendo-europe.com.

153
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,300
I don't know if they're doing anything like that in the U.S.

154
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,300
I wish.

155
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:55,300
But it was a loyalty program that they had going on where if you did stuff you had all these stars.

156
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:01,300
So you can go through and use your points to buy games or go shopping or do stuffs.

157
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,300
It's kind of nice that you can finally get something for it, you know?

158
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,300
Yeah, I think it's pretty cool.

159
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:12,300
As for all those people who saved up your stars, congrats to you.

160
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,300
Anyways, let's see here.

161
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,300
This is also kind of interesting.

162
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:31,300
Usually you would think Gamefly with rentals for games and stuff, but now they're offering Gamefly Tunes, which is a partnership with a company called Brand Racket.

163
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:37,300
And they're offering the subscribers five free preselected songs to download each month.

164
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:48,300
And I guess it's going to highlight up and coming and established artists, and apparently people that aren't subscribed to the service can download one.

165
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:59,300
And I guess this month, music including artists like RJD2, Thievery Corporation, Shadows Fall, OK Go, and Little Brother.

166
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,300
That's interesting that they would be doing that kind of stuff.

167
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,300
And as far as I'm aware, I don't think that's actually any video game music, so...

168
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:14,300
Yeah, I actually downloaded some of those songs, and I mean, they are up and coming artists, so they aren't really...

169
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,300
Some of them are OK, others aren't that great.

170
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:23,300
And I imagine that probably every month it's going to be more of the same.

171
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,300
Well, I mean, OK Go, they're in Rock Band, but I don't know.

172
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,300
Free's good, I guess.

173
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:36,300
I already have both of OK Go's other albums, and the rest of their stuff just sounds the same.

174
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,300
Just less entertaining.

175
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,300
Kind of boring in some cases.

176
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,300
I don't listen to a lot of the stuff that you kids are listening to these days.

177
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,300
You and your old radio discs.

178
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,300
80s forever!

179
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,300
8-track tapes.

180
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,300
Well, anyway, that's cassette tapes.

181
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:04,300
Let's move on to talking about something that could be all the rage in a couple of years, or very soon, who knows.

182
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:10,300
Apparently a patent was filed by Apple back in September of 2006.

183
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:15,300
And now it has just come out to light, because I guess these things take a while to hit the public internet.

184
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,300
Apparently, there is going to be multi-touch technology in this game.

185
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,300
So, apparently, what it is, basically...

186
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:30,300
I mean, obviously, they already have the iPhone, but they want to apply this touch technology, the multi-touch thing, to gaming.

187
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,300
So, they say, quote, this is being used for a game or a gaming application.

188
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:43,300
And, of course, we all know about the iPhone, but now we're kind of talking about that possibly this patent was actually filed to do gaming on the iPhone.

189
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,300
Possibly a music-based game.

190
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:52,300
But, I mean, this really doesn't come as much as a surprise, because on the current iPods, they've gone into gaming a little bit.

191
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,300
So, it just makes sense to me that on the iPhones and the iTouches and all this stuff, they're going to get into this as well.

192
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:02,300
Yes, and remember how wonderful those games are on the iPods already.

193
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,300
I'm being sarcastic, by the way, because they're not very good.

194
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,300
Well, what about the one that came out from Harmonix?

195
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,300
Faze.

196
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,300
Thank you.

197
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,300
Faze was okay, but, seriously, the rest of them sucked.

198
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,300
I mean, I don't know.

199
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:26,300
But then again, I mean, there's not much you can do with just a jog wheel, so, you know, having multiple touch screen stuff on there, yeah, that would be a lot better, obviously.

200
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:34,300
But, I wouldn't, I don't know, you're going to get as much gaming out of this as you are an N-Gage, so, seriously.

201
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:39,300
Well, I guess time will tell, but it is very interesting that that came up, nevertheless.

202
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:44,300
Always interesting are the emails that you guys send us every week at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

203
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:52,300
And every week, Jamie dives in head first into our big old mailbag and pulls out a few of the emails that she likes and reads them for us here, live on air.

204
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,300
And that's what she's going to do right now in our mailbag segment.

205
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:06,300
Email, email, email.

206
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:16,300
And just as a point of order, I will say that I have read every email that comes through, and some are not being read, you know, on air, because we got a bunch of them.

207
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,300
So, I will read a few of these.

208
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,300
And one of them was sent from an iPhone, and that makes me laugh.

209
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:28,300
This is from jazz432 slash ps3.

210
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,300
Okay.

211
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,300
Anyway, hey, guys, I love the show.

212
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,300
You guys keep me going on the podcast at work.

213
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,300
I just wanted to say that I found a new game for me.

214
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:45,300
I know you guys are not very big on the PS3, but you need to give it time and a chance.

215
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,300
I was on the PSN store last night and saw that they had added some new games.

216
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,300
I had never heard of a game called Wild Arms.

217
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,300
Have you never heard of Wild Arms?

218
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,300
I know you guys slash ladies may have.

219
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,300
It's a good RPG for the PSP.

220
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,300
Well, it was a PlayStation game.

221
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,300
Way better on PlayStation LOL anyway.

222
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,300
I heard on your last podcast that you don't get reviewed much on iTunes.

223
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,300
I will give you a good score when I get home from work.

224
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,300
I love the show and keep it up.

225
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,300
Jamie, I love your input on the show.

226
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,300
It's always good to get info from the ladies and not from just us geek guys.

227
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:24,300
Got to go back to work before the boss finds out I am emailing you guys, LOLJK.

228
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,300
I'm telling.

229
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,300
Actually, I just sold my copy of Ratchet and Clank Tools of Destruction.

230
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:37,300
It's just not the full Ratchet and Clank, it's just I don't like the Ratchet and Clank series.

231
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:43,300
That game is probably pretty good, but the person I sold it to loves it a lot more than I do.

232
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:48,300
There's a lot of games though for the PS3.

233
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:54,300
I was going to give Unreal Tournament 3 a chance, but for some reason,

234
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,300
part of me thought that there was an actual good single player portion of that game,

235
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:04,300
but it's Unreal Tournament and there's not, so I don't really want to buy it.

236
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,300
I don't know, there will be more stuff that comes out later on.

237
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,300
It's just right now, there's not a lot of great games for it.

238
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,300
Not to say that there won't ever be.

239
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,300
Some interesting comments on chat on Wild Arms.

240
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,300
It's kind of polarizing the chat room.

241
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,300
Separat1215 said,

242
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,300
Wild Arms was never a huge game.

243
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,300
I'm not surprised if no one knows what it is.

244
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,300
RossDeelUT says,

245
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,300
How the fuck has this guy never heard of Wild Arms?

246
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,300
Jonathan F. says,

247
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,300
Wild Arms is a killer RPG held up well against Final Fantasy VII,

248
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,300
I think in my opinion.

249
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,300
Wild Arms is just as it sounds, a Wild West RPG,

250
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,300
although it's not that at the same time.

251
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,300
So, I already have some comments on Wild Arms from the chat.

252
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,300
Any more emails?

253
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,300
No, none at all.

254
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,300
Yeah, there's some.

255
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,300
All right.

256
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,300
Next email,

257
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,300
Hey folks at OLR.

258
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,300
I was just emailing to say that I was just about in tears at work

259
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,300
from laughing so hard at Loki flipping out about one up protesting for publicity.

260
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:02,300
I'm glad someone gets fired up about something and Loki offered up some radio gold.

261
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,300
You guys host a fantastic show and I always look forward to listening.

262
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,300
Keep putting out fantastic shows and us fans will be extremely saddened

263
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,300
with the loss of this show because it really kicks the crap out of those

264
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:16,300
other big name corporate podcasts with its real enthusiasm and passion.

265
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,300
Ego++, thank you.

266
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,300
And again, this email is sponsored by the Olive Garden,

267
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,300
home of the Never Ending South.

268
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,300
It's J-Rod.

269
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,300
Dude, the Olive Garden is awesome.

270
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,300
Next,

271
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,300
Dear OLR,

272
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,300
I was thinking,

273
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,300
would those jot guys act the same way if it said gay girl?

274
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,300
Oh, you missed the video last week.

275
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,300
Somebody did this experiment where they went on the internet with Halo 3

276
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,300
and their gamer tag was gay boy and they went into all these rooms

277
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,300
and you can just imagine, I mean,

278
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,300
Xbox Live, you can probably fill in the blanks with what happened.

279
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,300
So, this is probably what this person is responding to is what would happen

280
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,300
if this person went in the room with the name gay girl.

281
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,300
Because when two girls make out, that's hot.

282
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,300
But when two guys make out, that's gross.

283
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,300
Dude, I think that guys making out is really hot.

284
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,300
Anyway, they probably wouldn't.

285
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
It's a sad truth of the world we live in.

286
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,300
There's people who only like one part of something but not the other part.

287
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,300
I'm just waiting until gaming is blamed for bigotry.

288
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,300
Siaion671.

289
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,300
PS, Sky already has the game.

290
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,300
Sky's voice is a little different.

291
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,300
Sky has the game. Sky's voice is the game.

292
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,300
Don't get me started.

293
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,300
But good point brought up.

294
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,300
I would like to see an experiment done.

295
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,300
I would like to see the same person go back on the Halo 3 with the name

296
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,300
gay girl or lesbian girl or something like that.

297
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,300
Because you say gay girl and a lot of folks get the stereotypical

298
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,300
butchy girl who likes girls in their mind.

299
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,300
But lesbians is a more exotic word.

300
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:53,300
Lesbians is the lipstick wherein pillow fighting lesbians.

301
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,300
Porn star.

302
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,300
When I would tell you that most lesbians I know are in neither category.

303
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,300
Yeah.

304
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,300
So continuing forward, shall I?

305
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,300
You shall.

306
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,300
Greetings.

307
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,300
This is Kripatkin from the Kripatkin and Hendricks Game Review Show.

308
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,300
Sorry, I'm being tongue tied.

309
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,300
While listening to your show last week, second part,

310
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,300
I noticed that Loki casually dismissed Sensible Soccer

311
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,300
as of little to no interest to anyone

312
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,300
and then Sky and Rice Princess began to laugh at its name.

313
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,300
Oh dear.

314
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,300
I had to count to ten before writing this email

315
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,300
as one should never write an email in anger for yes,

316
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,300
such a dismissive attitude filled me with both fury and despair.

317
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,300
Sensible World of Soccer, a.k.a. Sensei,

318
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,300
is part of the holy trinity of British video game titles

319
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,300
that cannot be slighted.

320
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,300
It was an all-time classic footy game made by Sensible Software,

321
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:47,300
hence the name, that built on Kickoff 2 title from back in 1989

322
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
on the Atari ST and Amiga.

323
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,300
To see it arrive on Xbox Live Arcade is nothing short of wondrous news.

324
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,300
To put it into perspective, try to imagine someone saying

325
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,300
Super Mario 3 is a bit meh

326
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:02,300
and that is what you did last week as far as your British listenership were concerned.

327
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,300
Oh, and in case you're wondering what other two games are in the trinity there,

328
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,300
Speedball 2, already on Xbox Live Arcade, and Paragoid.

329
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,300
If you want to know more about these three games, search on Wiki.

330
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,300
It has some great pages for all three games.

331
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,300
I've actually heard of Paragoid.

332
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,300
Keep up the good work and just be careful over games

333
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,300
that originate from the British Isles in the future.

334
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,300
I mean, you might even start saying things like

335
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,300
Lords of Midnight are a bit overrated.

336
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,300
Not a good idea.

337
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,300
So basically what Karpatkin's trying to tell us is that

338
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:34,300
Guardian Legend is to Orange Lounge Radio

339
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,300
as Sensible World of Soccer is to all of the UK.

340
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,300
Is that kind of what this email is to summarize?

341
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,300
That's the general...

342
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,300
I see. Well, we are sorry for poking fun at your sacred game.

343
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,300
Or he was just saying Loki was wrong.

344
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,300
Which a lot of our emailers like to do.

345
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,300
Dude, okay, no offense, but I mean...

346
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,300
Uh-oh.

347
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,300
You know, even...

348
00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:00,300
Okay, I'll give you, you know, yeah, Super Mario World 3 may be not the shit.

349
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,300
And to be honest, it was the shit at one time,

350
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,300
but times have changed, okay?

351
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,300
Sensible World of Soccer may have been a great game at the time,

352
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
and it still may be a great game now.

353
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,300
But you know what, though?

354
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,300
I ain't gonna download it.

355
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,300
You know why I'm not gonna download it?

356
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,300
Because it's a soccer game, for one.

357
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:22,300
I don't play sports games, and I definitely don't play soccer games.

358
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,300
And two, it's like an Amiga game.

359
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,300
I'll check out the demo, and if I like it, I'll buy it.

360
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,300
That's what I do with most games.

361
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,300
I'll be sensible about it.

362
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,300
Back in the day, I used to play Blades of Steel and stuff like that,

363
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,300
so I have tried games and stuff like that.

364
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,300
It's just not my thing.

365
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,300
And I'm not saying that you're wrong for downloading it.

366
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,300
I'm not faulting you for doing that, but you know what?

367
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,300
I sure as hell am not downloading it.

368
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,300
But you're wrong for being British, is what we're trying to say.

369
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,300
I'm not British.

370
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,300
I'm just kidding. Never mind.

371
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,300
Rob.

372
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,300
What?

373
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,300
You remember, though, what I went crazy about finding at the store Friday night?

374
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:04,300
Super High Impact, which is the only American football game that I like, ever.

375
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,300
I like Tecmo Bowl on the Nintendo.

376
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
That's my favorite.

377
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,300
Super High Impact on Super Nintendo, I think.

378
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,300
But I also played...

379
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,300
What was it that was on Super Nintendo? Was it Mario Stryker?

380
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,300
Wasn't that it?

381
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,300
No, Mario Stryker's a new one, isn't it?

382
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,300
No, that's the new one.

383
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,300
Oh, that's probably like a new sequel or something.

384
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,300
It was an old one on Super Nintendo, another soccer game.

385
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,300
I used to play that all the time.

386
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
Uh-oh, the chat room's requesting my British accent.

387
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,300
No.

388
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,300
You better go to next email.

389
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,300
No, next email.

390
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,300
Oh, I think I'll be logging on to Xbox Live this week and downloading some sensible World

391
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,300
of Soccer.

392
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,300
Sensible.

393
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,300
Cheerio.

394
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,300
Or Scottish.

395
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,300
Okay, see, I'm not doing that shit, so I mean, come on.

396
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,300
And they're getting mad at me.

397
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,300
Whatever.

398
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,300
Yeah, but I'm cute.

399
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,300
Uh-huh.

400
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,300
Yeah.

401
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,300
Hey, OLR.

402
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:55,300
I've been listening to your show for over a year now, and I think it's the best.

403
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,300
Aww.

404
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,300
My question is mainly for Loki, but others could chime in.

405
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,300
Well, thank you for your permission.

406
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,300
I bought a PSP slim and need to know how to install custom firmwares.

407
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:09,300
Do I need Pandora's battery and how to?

408
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:14,300
Um, your show is awesome, great, and with a PSP, I will hopefully be listening live

409
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,300
more often.

410
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,300
Thanks, Ryan.

411
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:23,300
Yeah, you do need Pandora's battery in order to install custom firmware on there, and there's

412
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,300
instructions online on how to do it, and you actually have to create a different Pandora's

413
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:32,300
battery than the one that they use for the fat PSPs, but basically it involves you making

414
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:38,300
the standard Pandora's battery, then you patch the file with some other thing, and then once

415
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:43,300
you've done that, you run the Pandora's battery on the system, and then you can install custom

416
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,300
firmwares.

417
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:49,300
Don't ask me how to do it, because I didn't know at the time, I had to read a very, you

418
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,300
know, stupid walkthrough on how to do it, and it took me about three times before I

419
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,300
finally got it right.

420
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,300
So, it's not easy, but it's not super difficult.

421
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,300
Do you have to mod your PSP?

422
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,300
I mean, Jesus, just play the games.

423
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,300
Me, I don't!

424
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,300
Hey, I have to mod everything.

425
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,300
Everything!

426
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,300
There is not anything that I don't break open.

427
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,300
Except for my DS, I haven't done that yet.

428
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,300
I'm working on it right now, though.

429
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:22,300
We broke open my old Game Boy Advance to put an afterburner in it.

430
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,300
That's different, because it really needed that.

431
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,300
I mean, that really enhanced the damn Game Boy Advance.

432
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,300
My friend did that for me for my birthday, but I'm just saying, you know, the PSP, yeah,

433
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:35,300
I installed, when they were first out, I installed the stuff that let me play Kid Icarus on the

434
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:39,300
PSP so I could go, hee, hee, hee, I have Kid Icarus everywhere, but now it's kind of old.

435
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,300
And so, I just, I don't care anymore.

436
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,300
I don't care about modding anymore.

437
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,300
I haven't hacked my iPhone, though, and I'm not going to.

438
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,300
Not my thing.

439
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,300
Next email.

440
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,300
DMN says, Loki modded his penis.

441
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,300
Exactly.

442
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,300
Because you did say you have to mod everything.

443
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,300
Game consoles, okay.

444
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:03,300
Yes, please, next email, quick.

445
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,300
Next email says words.

446
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,300
Hey, Loki, Dark Soccer, and Sky.

447
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,300
I just wanted to thank you guys so much for helping me get through a really hard first

448
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,300
semester at college.

449
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,300
Looking forward to the next podcast kept me going and helped me look around for some fellow

450
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:20,300
gamers that need play, so I quickly found a whole bunch of Wii players, and I've been

451
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,300
having fun with Mario Strikers since I'm one of those more social gamers, although I don't

452
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,300
play online a lot.

453
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,900
Anyway, keep up the good work, and once again, thanks for making this transition all that

454
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,340
much more manageable.

455
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,660
All the best, Cliff R.

456
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,660
Wow, lots of good ego emails tonight.

457
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,620
No, but I'm glad to hear about the Wii Club that's forming at your campus.

458
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,620
That's kind of fun.

459
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,500
That's pretty cool.

460
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,500
Last email.

461
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,820
Remember when we were going to do a show live at a college campus?

462
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,060
We actually, no, we were having talks.

463
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,060
Remember that?

464
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,740
We were going to do that at East Davis.

465
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,340
We were going to be doing it in their big theater they had there, but it didn't work

466
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:59,220
out because our hookup left, and we no longer had a hookup to do our show there.

467
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,620
We were going to do one of our big shows there.

468
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:04,660
I don't remember if it was 150 or 200, but oh well.

469
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,180
Maybe we should have a contest.

470
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,580
OLR comes to your school.

471
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,580
Apparently.

472
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,580
That'd be fun.

473
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,780
Yeah, and to win, you pay for it.

474
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:15,220
No, I'm just kidding.

475
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,220
Last email.

476
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,220
Yes.

477
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,220
Hey, it's me, Dr. Burst.

478
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:22,740
I took a few months off to get my grades up, but I'm pulling an all-nighter tonight to

479
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,500
get this essay done, and I'm listening live for motivation.

480
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,900
You can do it!

481
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,740
Oh, Jamie, always the inspirational one.

482
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,980
All I have to say is you guys have gotten four times better while I was gone.

483
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,940
I'm glad that the price changes on Live 365 did not kill you.

484
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,560
The show has helped me get over two pages out of three.

485
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,560
Good job, guys.

486
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
Keep it up.

487
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,180
That's 10,000 cups of coffee for the win, Dr. Burst.

488
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,180
Nice.

489
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,740
We've gotten four times better.

490
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:59,100
We must have been really bad before to be four times better now because I would say

491
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,500
we're only about, and we're like on the line right now.

492
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,500
You know what?

493
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:13,020
I lied because there's, well, it's an article that Robwith2B is linked to that I actually

494
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,220
think is pretty cool.

495
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:22,700
It's from Engadget as soon as it loads, but it's Sega protecting the Dreamcast trademark

496
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,340
but not doing another console.

497
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,340
Oh, God.

498
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,340
That whole debacle.

499
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,340
I forgot about that.

500
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:36,060
Well, if it'll ever load, but basically, Sega is saying that they're going to keep that

501
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:44,380
trademark so that they can, I guess, protect their rights in the Dreamcast name, but they're

502
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,460
not going to be doing any.

503
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:50,020
I want to know how the hell someone jumped to that conclusion that they're doing a Dreamcast

504
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,500
2 from them renewing the trademarks.

505
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,340
How did that rumor even start?

506
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,540
Because that kind of seems stupid to me.

507
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:01,020
They're quoted as saying they have no plans to get back into the console business.

508
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,020
Which is no surprise.

509
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,020
When I first read that rumor, I'm like, yeah, right.

510
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,020
Yeah, right.

511
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,540
They're going to put out a Dreamcast 2 right now and the market is crowded.

512
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,060
I just don't see Sega getting back into consoles anytime soon.

513
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:15,660
I mean, let's face it, sorry Sega fans, but the last few offerings from Sega have not

514
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:19,140
been all that, even in the console market.

515
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,300
So they got a lot of catching up to do, you know what I mean, before they start thinking

516
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,300
about a console again.

517
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,220
Okay, we got one last email.

518
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,220
All right.

519
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,220
Hurry up.

520
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,220
I was blinking.

521
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,220
Fine.

522
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,220
It says boobies.

523
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,220
I'm not joking.

524
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,220
The first word in it is boobies.

525
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,220
Is that from DMN?

526
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,220
No.

527
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,220
It's from the doctor.

528
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,220
Oh, okay.

529
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,220
LOL.

530
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,780
I'm thinking a lot of LOLs in my emails.

531
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,780
What is that about?

532
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,780
I love you guys.

533
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:45,020
Anyway, I'm going to try and buy some 360 before Christmas.

534
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,700
Thanks for the idea, Sky and Loki, the doctor.

535
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:54,100
Send me a TARDIS so I can, you know, go elsewhere and else win.

536
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,340
And now here, RossdielUT actually has a really good idea here.

537
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:02,740
He says I can imagine, for once, ha ha ha, no, just kidding, he says I can imagine they'll

538
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:06,620
just repackage a flashback-type console for Dreamcast games.

539
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,540
Now that I could see happening.

540
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:13,780
That is a sensible world of Dreamcast to me.

541
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:18,700
By the way, it was Mega Man Soccer I was trying to think of.

542
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,700
Let's see.

543
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,700
What else?

544
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,340
I'm getting lulled today with boobies.

545
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,620
Somebody else had a sensible joke.

546
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,620
Oh, yes.

547
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:29,620
ActDeft said when we go to the college campuses, it could be OLR, the Sensible World of Podcasting

548
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,620
Tour.

549
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,620
I like that name.

550
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:36,620
We should have that contest, contest, pay for us to come see you.

551
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,620
I like that idea.

552
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,620
Pay for our vacation.

553
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:46,420
Here's our new contest, pay for OLR to come to your town.

554
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,820
And they can make fun of your town and then maybe show some people how to do podcasting.

555
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,460
We'll record our podcast in your town if you pay.

556
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,860
But not at your house, because that would be creepy.

557
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:00,740
And you might not have good internet either.

558
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,740
Exactly.

559
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,740
My God.

560
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,420
The show is breaking our internet at this house.

561
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,860
We kind of tried to prep for it.

562
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,860
All right.

563
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,860
End of mailbag.

564
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,300
Let's get to some more stuff.

565
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,500
If you want to send in an email, give us some ego plus plus.

566
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,500
We always love that.

567
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,820
Mailbag at orangeontrado.com or some ego minus minus.

568
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,860
I think Jamie skipped some of the ego minus minus this week.

569
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:29,980
I skipped a reminder of manners addressed to one of our three that isn't you or me.

570
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,220
I was looking forward to that email because it was kind of funny.

571
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,220
Do you want me to read it?

572
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,220
Yes.

573
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,220
Read it because it's funny.

574
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,220
Okay.

575
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,220
You'll see why in a minute.

576
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,220
I have to open the email box again.

577
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,220
Hold on.

578
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,220
All right.

579
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,220
We're going to give her a minute.

580
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,500
Because there's an email that's criticizing Loki that I actually found kind of funny and

581
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,260
I want her to read it.

582
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,820
And it's funny because it's true.

583
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,820
It is so fucking true.

584
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,820
It is true.

585
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,920
And I've been listening all night long tonight and it is completely true and so that's why

586
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,920
I want to...

587
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,920
I know Loki's like, what the fuck did I do now?

588
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,920
I'm trying to log back into...

589
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,920
Okay.

590
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,920
Here we go.

591
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,920
I have to go in the old mail.

592
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:05,000
All criticisms of me are true.

593
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
So whatever.

594
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:19,540
Of course when you start playing the music now the email starts to load.

595
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,540
Old mail.

596
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,740
I can't wait to see.

597
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,920
I know because Op 11 is running.

598
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,920
Op 11 is going to...

599
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,920
Damn you, Op 11.

600
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,560
Yeah, yeah, Loki's like, oh, take your time.

601
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,360
Here we go.

602
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,760
Oh, hooray.

603
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,000
And this is from Mario.

604
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,080
Oh, shit.

605
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,280
You know that Mario's calling you out now.

606
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,760
Yeah, there are other people in the world named Mario

607
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,320
other than the video game character.

608
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,480
I will not say last names on the air, so.

609
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,600
All right.

610
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,800
Loki, I find that you are very rude to your co-hosts

611
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,600
and audience when you cut them off

612
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,000
with your standard introduction anyways.

613
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,240
Saying anyways after someone states

614
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,320
that whatever is said is not important.

615
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,300
What everyone says is important, even your thoughts

616
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,160
and comments.

617
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,480
Learn to stop saying anyways after anyone's statements

618
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,960
except your own statements.

619
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,200
Anyways, I don't really care.

620
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,480
It is true, though.

621
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,200
No, he does.

622
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:16,720
He does.

623
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,360
Well, there's people that interrupt me

624
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,560
all the fucking time.

625
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,600
You'll hear me going, hey, hey, I'm not doing talking yet.

626
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,160
Hey, listen.

627
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,080
Hey, listen.

628
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,760
Hey, listen.

629
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,400
It's over.

630
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,200
I'll say anyways.

631
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:31,880
It's over.

632
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,760
Well, please.

633
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,440
No, it's just funny.

634
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,960
We're just poking fun at you because I

635
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,680
don't think you really mean it to be rude,

636
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,520
but it's been kind of your transition word.

637
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,280
Like, you know, we've been working on our transit.

638
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,800
You know, going from one story to another, we try to be smooth.

639
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,960
Like, you know, oh, we're going to go from one,

640
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,280
we eat a story, another, we story.

641
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,280
When Loki's ready to go on a story,

642
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,480
it's like, OK, anyways, we got this game coming out.

643
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,880
Oh, my god, Rob, your light's just seizures.

644
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,820
Did they?

645
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,720
Yeah, they're just sitting here and we're on.

646
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,880
Blink.

647
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,360
And then it's because he has them on that one

648
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,720
where they cycle.

649
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,760
Yeah, they're on the cycle one where it goes to anything.

650
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,360
They cycle, you know, with a fake hand.

651
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,440
Well, I just happened to look over there when they were.

652
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,840
All right, anyways, can we get back into the gaming news now?

653
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,160
Definitely, we can get back into the gaming news,

654
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,240
and I'll stop shopping.

655
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,360
I want to get a little bell, and every time Loki

656
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,800
says anyways, I go, bing.

657
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
Weren't you going to get a bell for something else?

658
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,360
I know, there was something else I was going to get a bell for,

659
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,400
and I never did.

660
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,480
Oh, well, because I'm lazy.

661
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:31,160
So rock band ain't coming out in Canada until the 28th.

662
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,360
Sucks for you guys, but guess what?

663
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,960
You know, the problem is they don't

664
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,880
have enough guitars and instruments and stuff

665
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,480
to go around.

666
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,560
It doesn't help that their first batch of them also sucked.

667
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,160
Because they're having to send all the Canadian guitars out

668
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,520
as replacements for all the broken American ones,

669
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,640
and you know it's true.

670
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,240
Oh, yeah, probably.

671
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,840
So yeah, no rock band for you.

672
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,680
All right, sorry.

673
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,200
Moving on to the PSP.

674
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,160
PSP got a new game on the PC PlayStation Store.

675
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,320
How the hell does that work?

676
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,560
Well, there's this new game, and it's called Beats.

677
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,240
And for $4.99, what you do is you download this,

678
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,880
and you use this little tool on your PC

679
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,160
to put it on the memory stick.

680
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,000
And the game itself was developed

681
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,760
by Sony Computer Entertainment in Europe.

682
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,240
I guess apparently this was going

683
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,200
to be a UMD project, like an actual full game.

684
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,840
And there was actually going to be licensed music and videos.

685
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,720
Apparently the Sugar Babes, which is a British band,

686
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,200
was going to be involved.

687
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,480
But they decided to scrap that idea, thank god.

688
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,480
And what they did instead is that now for this $5 game,

689
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,520
it'll actually run off the MP3s that's on your PSP.

690
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,000
So it's very similar to that iPod game that just

691
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,240
came out phase.

692
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,040
But, well, it doesn't look the same.

693
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,680
To me, the game itself looks like one of those cut scenes

694
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,280
and get there, not cut scenes, but one

695
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,720
of the parts of Guitar Man.

696
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,680
Not the part where you're moving the analog stick around,

697
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,680
but the part where all the notes are

698
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,800
coming in towards the center.

699
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,760
When you are doing the attacks.

700
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,260
Yes.

701
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,920
Counting the attacks.

702
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,680
That's what this looks like to me.

703
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,280
Oh my god, you're right.

704
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,280
Now you can't get that on the PlayStation 3 store

705
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,880
for whatever reason, maybe soon.

706
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,240
But right now you can only get it on the PC store.

707
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,800
So there you go.

708
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,040
It looks very plain.

709
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,580
So, oh, I guess Tiger Claw actually

710
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:26,400
linked a YouTube video of our buddy Bobby playing beats.

711
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,720
So I'm curious about this.

712
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,240
And since the OP11's done, we should actually

713
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,080
have bandwidth now.

714
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,720
I want to look at this.

715
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,200
Let's see.

716
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,240
All right, there's a little watermark.

717
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,440
OK, here we go.

718
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,560
Let's take a look at this.

719
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,600
Looks kind of cute.

720
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,160
Let's see.

721
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,360
Let's get into the actual game play.

722
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,640
Oh, he's playing to his own show.

723
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,200
That's cute.

724
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,840
That's something else.

725
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,120
I don't know, the game itself doesn't

726
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,240
look that exciting, though.

727
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,680
There you have it.

728
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,080
Nice job, Bobby.

729
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,840
Good promotional piece, I got to say.

730
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,240
That's a good one.

731
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,400
Anyhow, that's it.

732
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,360
PSP beats.

733
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,440
Not something I think I'm going to run and grab my PSP for.

734
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,240
I don't know, it doesn't look that exciting to me.

735
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,640
You know what?

736
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,600
I'm not going to download it.

737
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,640
However, this is something I do want.

738
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,760
And by do want, I mean do want.

739
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,840
Finally.

740
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:28,280
Lumines is now available on the PC, yay.

741
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,600
My god, what else are they going to put this thing on?

742
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,200
The N-Gage?

743
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,960
Or is it already there?

744
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,480
I mean, the PC is like the last platform

745
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,720
I think this game is coming out on.

746
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,120
You've got a skin editing mode.

747
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,600
You have online score ranking.

748
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,280
It's going to be $19.99.

749
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:56,920
And there is a pay per play on a, bleh.

750
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,920
You can pay per play, or you can use a free version

751
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,800
that has ads all over it.

752
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,680
Does it have shine in?

753
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,040
That's all I really care about.

754
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,680
I don't know, but I'll get it.

755
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,960
All right, you let me know, and then I'll download it

756
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,960
if it has shine in it.

757
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,720
I'm going on there right now.

758
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,960
Shine in.

759
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:23,600
Anyways, yeah, because I didn't care what you're talking about.

760
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,480
You're all about shine in on it, because I'm not

761
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,560
going to play the game unless it has shine in.

762
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,320
He's at your home with Bell, so fuck off.

763
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,880
OK, so anyways, as I mentioned earlier in part A,

764
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,920
the Independent Games Festival is kind of wrapping up

765
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,420
here.

766
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,680
They have the finalists announced,

767
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,160
and it's a bunch of cool free games.

768
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,920
So definitely worth checking them out.

769
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,480
Some of the ones that they actually have available there

770
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,320
include some things that you'll see on Xbox Live Arcade soon,

771
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:56,840
actually.

772
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:01,240
In fact, they have one by the WIC developer.

773
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,120
I want to say it was Axiom Overdrive,

774
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:08,240
and that's going to be heading, I know, to live arcade

775
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,960
here pretty soon.

776
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,160
Some of the nominees here, they've

777
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,480
got best web browser game, including

778
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,000
IronDuke, Globus.com, and Triacnid.

779
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,220
Some of the games I've liked that I played here, Excellence

780
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,760
in Visual Art, Clean Asia.

781
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,600
Like I said, it's a good shoot-em-up game.

782
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,120
If you like Warning Forever, you might like that one.

783
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,240
There's also another one that you might like if you

784
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,720
like Warning Forever, which is called Battleships Forever.

785
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,160
It was inspired by that game, and it's another shoot-em-up

786
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,000
game.

787
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,440
So definitely worth checking out.

788
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,040
And also, if you want something to waste some time on,

789
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,320
also check out CRAN Physics Deluxe.

790
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,760
They have CRAN Physics, which you can play for free as well.

791
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,960
Fret Nice, also fun if you've got a Guitar Hero controller.

792
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,840
Highly recommend that game as well.

793
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,120
But anyways, just check it out.

794
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:05,800
It's at www.igf.com slash 02finalists.html.

795
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,640
And there's a bunch of links to free games,

796
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,440
and also go to all those sites.

797
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,120
You'll notice that there's also more free games on there

798
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,640
as well.

799
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,600
You know, I'm glad we really did that story tonight,

800
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,020
because I think sometimes we don't

801
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,280
give independent games enough loving on this show.

802
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,280
And for as much as we say rah, rah, rah, support

803
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,600
independent podcasting, we should

804
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,520
be talking more and more about independent games.

805
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,280
So we definitely should all take an effort

806
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,880
to check out some of these winners

807
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,360
and talk about them on the show.

808
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:29,880
Definitely.

809
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,840
And if you're also interested, there's links.

810
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:36,280
This is a 2008 one.

811
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,840
They also have links for the last 10 years in there.

812
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,800
They're winners, entrants, and mods, and whatnot.

813
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,520
So you can go ahead and check all those out as well.

814
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:51,120
In fact, last year, one of the winners for Design Innovation,

815
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,880
you might recognize Everyday Shooter.

816
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,640
So that's pretty cool.

817
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,660
Another Audience Award winner from last year,

818
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,760
Castle Crashers.

819
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,800
Also the GameTap Indie Awards, RoboBlitz,

820
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,880
and Everyday Shooter won that as well.

821
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,160
So a lot of these games, play them now,

822
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,680
because you'll probably see them on an online service

823
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:18,360
like the PlayStation Network or Xbox Live Arcade soon.

824
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,080
All right.

825
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,640
Well, something you might be seeing making a comeback soon

826
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,240
are the franchises MechWarrior, Shadowrun, and Crimson Skies.

827
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:31,160
Because Jordan Weissman has this new startup company, Smith

828
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,000
and Tinker.

829
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,120
And he basically has licensed back the electronic entertainment

830
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:39,360
rights to those franchises back from Microsoft.

831
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,720
And basically, these franchises were originally

832
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,600
developed by FASA.

833
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,520
And then Microsoft had it in 1999.

834
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,080
And they recently dissolved that.

835
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:55,040
So no really plans to further these franchises by Microsoft.

836
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,440
Which is probably good news, because Shadowrun really

837
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,800
didn't get a lot of love.

838
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,000
And it kind of seemed like these series were kind of done for.

839
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,280
But they are a lot of fans, especially Shadowrun.

840
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,360
You look at that, especially the old school

841
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,920
versions of Shadowrun, lots of people love those games

842
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,320
and are very excited at this news,

843
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:17,800
because maybe this is a sign that these series can

844
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,160
make a comeback.

845
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,600
So who knows?

846
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,400
Of course, the company who just bought them in Jordan Weissman's

847
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,000
group not said anything about it yet.

848
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,920
But you never know.

849
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,020
There is a cryptic posting that says, quote,

850
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,000
our goal is to surprise and delight

851
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,120
old fans while welcoming new fans to these fantastic worlds.

852
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:40,120
I used to play Shadowrun tabletop,

853
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,360
like the original Shadowrun, which

854
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,400
was RPG, actual D&D-style gaming.

855
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,820
But I'm going to guess you were just totally not interested

856
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,960
in the 360 one that came out recently.

857
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,520
No.

858
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,680
That's what happened with a lot of people.

859
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,520
So I think this is probably good news

860
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,720
that the franchise is back away from Microsoft, who

861
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,360
some would say ruined it.

862
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,440
But you can't win them all.

863
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,840
Microsoft's done a lot of things right,

864
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,280
but sometimes they get them wrong.

865
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,040
Yeah.

866
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,480
We forgive them sometimes.

867
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,160
Sometimes.

868
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,000
If they beg us.

869
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,400
Well, there has been a list released

870
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,160
of the top 20 games in Japan.

871
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,640
This is actually put out by, I think, let me see.

872
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,480
I'm trying to find the list that put it out, Next Gen.

873
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,840
2007 is Japan's top 20 games.

874
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,520
So we're not talking sales-wise, though.

875
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,640
We're talking like it's December,

876
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,840
here comes everybody's top 10 list, and all that stuff,

877
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,360
right?

878
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,880
Well, I've got a top 20, so I'm just

879
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,840
going to sort of skim through it.

880
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,480
Sure.

881
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,960
OK, number 20, DS Literature Companion,

882
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,200
which was on the DS.

883
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:49,080
And I don't see how that would be interesting,

884
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,720
but they were doing these cartridges for different,

885
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,720
classic Japanese novels, so that you know more about it.

886
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,120
I guess like Cliff Notes or something.

887
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:06,880
19 was Blade Storm for PS3, and Xbox 360 put out by Koei.

888
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,320
More Dynasty Warriors-ish game.

889
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,000
18 was Vision Training, Flash Focus

890
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,920
on Nintendo DS, which is exactly what it says.

891
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,600
It's little mini games for training your vision.

892
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,800
Wild Arms XF on PSP number 17.

893
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,200
Number 16, Game Center CX on Nintendo DS,

894
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,280
which is by Bandai Namco, which is actually

895
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,600
based off of a TV show.

896
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,520
And let's see, moving forward.

897
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:42,760
On number 15 is Trusty Bell, which was Eternal Sonata.

898
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,960
I like that game a lot.

899
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,800
14 is Face Training, to where you use the DS

900
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,720
camera to mimic a face.

901
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,960
That sounds stupid.

902
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,840
I know, it's sort of like how to smile a certain way.

903
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,120
It's one of the top games of the year.

904
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,320
13 was Ace Combat 6, which I don't see why,

905
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,480
because it's kind of boring.

906
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:10,280
12 was Subarashiki Konosekai, It's a Wonderful World

907
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,440
on Nintendo DS.

908
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,040
That's the one by Square Enix that's pretty awesome looking.

909
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,200
I like how the article says, the battle system plays

910
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,880
something like DDR for kids with ADHD.

911
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,040
That's interesting.

912
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,680
11, Treasure Island Z, The Adventures of Zack and Wiki

913
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,080
on Wii by Capcom.

914
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,600
Moving forward.

915
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,540
Come on.

916
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:36,720
There we go.

917
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,680
10, Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII on PSP.

918
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,320
Like, I have to explain that.

919
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,520
9, Legend of Zelda, The Phantom Hourglass.

920
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:51,000
8, Armor Dine, which was on PlayStation 2.

921
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,520
Another one of those mecha fighting weird strategy RPG

922
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,840
things.

923
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:04,040
7, Yusho no Kusei ni Namaihita on PSP,

924
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,800
which is put out by Acquire.

925
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,120
Acquire gave us Tenchu, by the way.

926
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,600
6, No More Heroes, which we were just

927
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:17,680
going over during our break.

928
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,640
Very interesting looking little game.

929
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,800
And then the last few, the top five.

930
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:29,120
Number five is Lost Odyssey, Xbox 360.

931
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,960
I've been hearing some not so great things

932
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,880
about Lost Odyssey.

933
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:36,000
I'm very curious to check it out when it comes out here.

934
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,040
I'm kind of of two minds about it, I'm thinking about it.

935
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,880
Four is Super Mario Galaxy.

936
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,560
Three is Wii Fit.

937
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:49,800
Two is Professor Layton and the Curious Village on Nintendo DS,

938
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,360
put up by level five.

939
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,720
And number one is Pac-Man Championship Edition,

940
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,520
Xbox Live Arcade.

941
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,680
Interesting.

942
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,280
Interesting choices.

943
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,560
That game gets a lot of play in my house.

944
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,120
I'm actually curious about this.

945
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,320
We were posted a link in chat from Rossdiel UT.

946
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,120
It's a commercial for face training straight out of Japan.

947
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,720
So this ought to be a hoot.

948
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:16,160
DS, the kono training.

949
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:23,120
Pokkaku to hou hichiangemasu, ichii, ni, san, shii.

950
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,560
You have to smile and turn your face.

951
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:32,960
Yoho no mai wo hichiangemasu, ichii, ni, san, shii.

952
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:39,280
Yojo yutakani isho apu, otona no DS, kao to renin.

953
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,680
My god, it looks like it's creepy.

954
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:47,880
That commercial's creepy because it makes it seem like we will be

955
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:52,880
absorbing your brain in five, four, three, two, one.

956
00:48:52,880 --> 00:49:00,280
Are they trying to imply that the Japanese people do not

957
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,200
have emotion?

958
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:01,840
That's racist.

959
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:08,760
That they need to, you know, look like everybody else.

960
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,320
You know, it's basically a trainer for pod people

961
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,200
so that we can't see who they are.

962
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,320
That's really what it is.

963
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,620
That's a strange looking game.

964
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,120
All right.

965
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,520
Well, one thing that you won't be smiling about,

966
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,120
well, maybe you will be because I know I haven't been here

967
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,520
in a while, CompUSA.

968
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,480
Apparently, they are shutting down the remaining stores

969
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,480
that they have.

970
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:39,240
And so yeah, I think closing 126 stores that are left.

971
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,040
Which you know what that means.

972
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,200
Liquidation sales.

973
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:43,840
Yay.

974
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,480
So make your way down to your local CompUSA

975
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,000
for some sweet deals on old games, I'm sure.

976
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,400
Except for the fact I looked and there's

977
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,880
no more CompUSAs in Sacramento.

978
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,000
They got rid of all of them.

979
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,680
Already, yeah.

980
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,520
Closest ones are in the Bay Area.

981
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,880
So I'm not driving all the way over there just

982
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,760
for some cheap games.

983
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,080
So sorry, CompUSA.

984
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,880
Nice knowing you when you were still around.

985
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,440
We bought one of our computers from CompUSA one time,

986
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,080
like way back in the day, with its whopping one meg of RAM.

987
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:17,640
Something that some people wish would go away and close down

988
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,320
for business forever is the Dr. Phil show.

989
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,920
Of course, Dr. Phil burned a lot of bridges with gamers

990
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,880
earlier this year with some of his comments.

991
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,960
However, it's very interesting because he

992
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,400
had that show about, well, I guess the whole show

993
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,000
wasn't about Second Life.

994
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,840
But he had the show about shocking teen trends.

995
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,320
And it actually focused on the, I'm sorry,

996
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,600
it actually wasn't Second Life.

997
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,160
It was a Second Life type of game called There.

998
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,880
And I should know There a little better

999
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,360
because one of the folks who used

1000
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,120
to come on the show a lot back in the day, DDR Angel,

1001
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,440
she was really into There.

1002
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,560
And I want to say for a time worked for the company.

1003
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,520
She may still even be there.

1004
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,480
I don't know.

1005
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,800
That's why we haven't heard from her in a while.

1006
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,640
Maybe she needs to go on the Dr. Phil show.

1007
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,240
No, no, I, that's, well, apparently this girl,

1008
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,320
this 13-year-old girl, Lexi, she spends

1009
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,600
like all her time on there.

1010
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,120
She had a boyfriend in there.

1011
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,040
And she had, like, they would make out

1012
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,480
on their bed and everything.

1013
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,760
Like, she had real feelings for this guy, I think.

1014
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,320
So.

1015
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,320
Sadly.

1016
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:14,840
What?

1017
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,000
I saw the show.

1018
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,720
Oh, what?

1019
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,200
You watched the Dr. Phil show.

1020
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,120
My wife watches the Dr. Phil show.

1021
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,720
Oh, and it just happened to be there.

1022
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,280
You couldn't, like, you know, go to the other room or anything?

1023
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,480
I had already been in the other room the entire day.

1024
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,440
So, you know, I have to come out some time

1025
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,160
and spend quality time with my wife and also eat dinner.

1026
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,840
Well, then, did you have fun watching the Dr. Phil show?

1027
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,640
No, because we always make fun of Dr. Phil.

1028
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,320
We always mock him.

1029
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,320
I'm Dr. Phil, OK?

1030
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,760
He's like a lot like Mr. Mackey.

1031
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,040
He's like, yeah, I'm Dr. Phil, and you should stop doing that.

1032
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,120
Well, what's interesting.

1033
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,400
OK, what's interesting is what Dr. Phil, and you

1034
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,680
may think that, you know, he's going

1035
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,400
to say something kind of narrow-minded and stupid,

1036
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,240
but he actually ends up having some pretty decent advice.

1037
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,840
He says, quote, because he actually

1038
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:06,920
had the CEO from there come on the show and kind of defend.

1039
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,600
So, like, you know, he got all ends of it.

1040
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,320
He said, quote, the problem is not with the game.

1041
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,400
The problem is the use of it.

1042
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,360
The game is very creative, and it's there

1043
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,320
for you to use or abuse.

1044
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,440
Are you abusing it?

1045
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,680
Yeah, and she said yes.

1046
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,080
She's like, yes, I am abusing it.

1047
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,200
And it's like, oh, OK, that was easy.

1048
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,440
And here's the thing.

1049
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,120
Mom limited play to four hours a day.

1050
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,480
And so Dr. Phil says, four hours a day?

1051
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,600
It's ridiculous.

1052
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,600
Mom, you've got to step up and shut this down, OK?

1053
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,160
Once she's at a point where she can play the game instead

1054
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,360
of being absorbed in the game, OK, then

1055
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,480
perhaps she can attempt to get back to it.

1056
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,320
That was the official advice from Dr. Phil.

1057
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:50,040
So it actually seems like that was good at telling the parent

1058
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,200
that the parent needs to pull the plug on the game

1059
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,960
and get the kid to do something else

1060
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,160
and stop passively accepting it.

1061
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,600
Well, the parent is the one paying the credit.

1062
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,920
This has a monthly subscription fee, I believe,

1063
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:07,040
where you can buy money in this game using your credit card.

1064
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,520
Well, the kid does not have a credit card,

1065
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:14,040
so stop giving her money, you moron.

1066
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,760
Wasn't this also the episode of Dr. Phil

1067
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,320
that the lawyer of no name was claiming

1068
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,800
that he was supposed to be invited to and never

1069
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,280
went through with it?

1070
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,360
Who cares about that guy?

1071
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,520
Yeah, he's going to be disbarred at the end of the year.

1072
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,320
So over him.

1073
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,000
So over him.

1074
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,240
Yeah, he's going to be gone.

1075
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,640
He ain't.

1076
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:39,200
Well, there is a new games rating system, a campaign

1077
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,760
to be launched for renting the games.

1078
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,440
There's a couple of Delaware political folks

1079
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,200
are hanging out with the ESRB and trying

1080
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,000
to bring out new public service announcements

1081
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,520
that these new ratings are supposed

1082
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,240
to be adhered to or whatever.

1083
00:53:59,240 --> 00:53:59,840
You know what?

1084
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,280
Can't they look at the box?

1085
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,960
Parents don't know the rating system, I swear.

1086
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,080
True story, last night I'm at Walmart

1087
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,880
and I'm looking at the Wii games because I kind of still

1088
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,880
want to get trauma centers.

1089
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,440
I was kind of looking how much they're charging for it

1090
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,240
because I was there to get some other stuff.

1091
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:21,120
And there's this parent and the kid is playing Xbox 360,

1092
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,680
the little demo kiosk, right?

1093
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,080
And he's going, I want this game.

1094
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:24,800
I want this game.

1095
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,360
And she goes, well, what's it rated?

1096
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,760
So OK, good question.

1097
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,880
She says, what's it rated?

1098
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,480
And the kid goes, RP.

1099
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,240
And the mom's all, what's that mean?

1100
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,440
She's all, what does RP mean?

1101
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:34,960
I don't know.

1102
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:35,520
And I'm just kind of thinking to myself.

1103
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,640
RP's not even on the list.

1104
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:38,920
It's rating pending.

1105
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:39,800
RP is rating pending.

1106
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,880
They do have it on the ESRB poster.

1107
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,440
Yeah, but that's what I'll bring to fill the wall.

1108
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:45,360
I've got some ESRB.

1109
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,800
That would be a good thing to fill the wall with.

1110
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,240
So if any parents watch our show, it reminds me of that.

1111
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,440
I have like hundreds of them.

1112
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,520
And me being the nosy fucker I am, I jumped in there

1113
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,360
and I said, I was like, it means rating pending.

1114
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,240
It's like a movie that hasn't been rated.

1115
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,240
I was thinking RPGs.

1116
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,440
Oh, no.

1117
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,640
No, well, that's the thing.

1118
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,680
I've been saying this for years.

1119
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,320
It should mirror the movie system.

1120
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:10,280
If it said R or PG-13 or not yet rated,

1121
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,920
people would know what that meant.

1122
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,320
And I said, well, what's the game?

1123
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,440
And she said it was Naruto.

1124
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,560
And I told her, I said Naruto is based on a cartoon.

1125
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,320
The worst thing you're going to see in it is cartoon violence.

1126
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,440
It's a team.

1127
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,120
It's rated team.

1128
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,120
It's rated team?

1129
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,280
Why?

1130
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,560
Because of cartoon violence.

1131
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,000
Because it's beating up?

1132
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,120
Oh, whoops.

1133
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,960
I told her, I'm like, it's a cartoon.

1134
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,520
It's fine for your seven-year-old.

1135
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,520
Oops.

1136
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,360
Well, that's actually the same thing.

1137
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,040
I think that the anime community has

1138
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:40,080
been sort of arguing against people for years now.

1139
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:43,160
That just because it's animated doesn't mean it's for kids.

1140
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:43,660
Hm.

1141
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:44,880
Oops.

1142
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,040
Have you seen Perfect Blue?

1143
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,440
But I said the worst thing you're going to see in it

1144
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,520
is cartoon violence.

1145
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,280
Or boobs.

1146
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,000
So.

1147
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,800
They do not have boobs in Naruto.

1148
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,440
They do not have boobs in Naruto.

1149
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,920
Yes, they do.

1150
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,200
I would like to see this on Cartoon Network.

1151
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:58,680
I mean.

1152
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:03,240
The sexy no-jokes, so yes, you do get boobies.

1153
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,320
All right.

1154
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:04,800
Ha ha.

1155
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,280
If that were the case, that show would be a lot more popular.

1156
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,400
There are cloud-covered boobies, but there's still boobies.

1157
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,120
OK.

1158
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:10,640
Yeah, yeah.

1159
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,300
Here's the thing.

1160
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:11,800
Look.

1161
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,160
DS68 is like Sky.

1162
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,000
You know the Japanese anime cartoons,

1163
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,200
not necessarily kid safe.

1164
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,080
OK, it wasn't La Blue Girl the Game, OK?

1165
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:19,760
It wasn't that.

1166
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,760
It was freaking Naruto.

1167
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:21,520
That's rated E.

1168
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,960
Which is on a rated EC for early childhood.

1169
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,840
Naruto's on freaking Cartoon Network.

1170
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,120
I know that.

1171
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,600
I didn't think it would be that bad.

1172
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,080
Oh, well.

1173
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,640
So what's the worst that happens?

1174
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,520
Some seven-year-old kid sees boobies.

1175
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,320
I mean, come on.

1176
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,560
Moving on.

1177
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,400
Anyways.

1178
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,720
Ding.

1179
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,920
I did that on purpose.

1180
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:52,320
So anyways, I love doing that.

1181
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:55,720
A watchdog group, of course, the Nymph,

1182
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:00,520
they've gave the game industry a C. Of course, each year,

1183
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:04,440
they put out their video game report card.

1184
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,520
You know, this is like one of those things where,

1185
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,960
who the fuck are these people, and why should I care?

1186
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,480
Well, they are the National Institute

1187
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,720
on Media and the Family.

1188
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:19,760
They basically will do those wonderful undercover stings

1189
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,040
where they'll see if people will sell them M-rated games

1190
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:27,200
and stuff like that, or their kids and whatnot.

1191
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,600
Really, my thing is, who gives a shit if they're rating?

1192
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,040
So if I rated the industry an F, would people

1193
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,600
give a shit that I'm rating an F?

1194
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,640
No one really cares.

1195
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,720
This industry, or watchdog organization, excuse me,

1196
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,520
this watchdog organization sounds

1197
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,880
like the group in Footloose that told the townspeople they

1198
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:43,960
can't dance.

1199
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,840
Something like that.

1200
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:49,400
But apparently, they've conducted a lot of research.

1201
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,600
They found that 52% of the parents

1202
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,840
claim to use the ESRB rating system,

1203
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:57,920
but 72% know little or nothing about the rating system

1204
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,760
overall.

1205
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,320
72 plus 52 does not equal 100.

1206
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,320
I'm confused.

1207
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,840
But people use it, despite the fact

1208
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,640
that they don't know anything about it.

1209
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:13,320
That has, so that game's rated M. I like the letter M. Go,

1210
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,880
son, you can buy it.

1211
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,720
Is that how they do it?

1212
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,160
Seriously.

1213
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,640
Everybody cut loose, Footloose.

1214
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,920
Apparently, undercover shoppers that were under the age of 18

1215
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:31,080
were able to buy M-rated games at nearly 50% of the time.

1216
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,800
But really, here's the thing, though.

1217
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,880
It's store policy not to sell M-rated games to minors.

1218
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,960
There's no law that says they have to do that.

1219
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,520
So what's it matter?

1220
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,680
And in fact, I would tell them that.

1221
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,880
To their faces?

1222
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,840
Yes, if I was a person that, oh, you sold me an M-rated game,

1223
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:51,080
and I'm under 18, I'd be like, so?

1224
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,400
Loki, you should join one of these watchdog organizations

1225
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,400
just for laughs.

1226
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,160
Maybe like an undercover report.

1227
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:01,000
What really goes on in these watchdog organizations?

1228
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,160
I would like to see a watchdog organization

1229
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,680
for the watchdog organizations.

1230
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,680
I like that.

1231
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,880
I'm going to rate them.

1232
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,720
I think this is a fabulous idea.

1233
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:13,720
So what would we call our watchdog organization?

1234
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:14,560
You think about that.

1235
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,200
Chat room.

1236
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,920
I'm putting that challenge to you guys.

1237
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,120
Ooh, ooh, ooh, what?

1238
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,400
I know, I know.

1239
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,480
Their nymph, I'll be nymph-o.

1240
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,040
I like that.

1241
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,760
I don't know what the O would stand for.

1242
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,280
Overseer, there we go.

1243
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,160
That'll work.

1244
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:39,120
I'll be the National Institute on Media and Family Overseer.

1245
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,400
Nymph-o.

1246
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,680
Love it.

1247
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,880
That's beautiful.

1248
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,960
That's one of the greatest insights to come.

1249
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,280
And the years I've been doing this radio program,

1250
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,000
that's one of the greatest, I'll tell you.

1251
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:53,520
Anyhow.

1252
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,720
That's lovely.

1253
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,360
Oh, RossDielUT.

1254
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,560
You did it, too.

1255
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,400
I like this.

1256
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,000
You did it.

1257
00:59:59,000 --> 00:59:59,500
What?

1258
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:00,040
You said it.

1259
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,400
Oh, forget it.

1260
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,320
Who cares?

1261
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:05,720
RossDielUT says, the Institute for a Media Whore,

1262
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:06,360
Free America.

1263
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:13,320
Dark Tetsuya says, National Institute Media Family, OLR.

1264
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,800
Frisbee says, OLR is watching you poop.

1265
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:17,960
I don't know about that one.

1266
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,840
I don't want to watch that.

1267
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,640
The hell is wrong with you people?

1268
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,280
OLR is watching you poop in a tube.

1269
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,320
That's gross.

1270
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,520
I mean, Loki watched those two girls poop in a cup,

1271
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,560
but that's something completely different.

1272
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,120
I think a lot of people watch that.

1273
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,040
Anyhow, moving on.

1274
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,440
Let's talk about Eve Online.

1275
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:40,600
This is a game that has quite a bit of a following to it.

1276
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,580
And I know when I was on another show a couple weeks

1277
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:44,800
ago, there was definitely a lot of talk about Eve Online.

1278
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:49,760
Well, Eve Online went offline earlier this week.

1279
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,760
What happened is that there was a new update that went out.

1280
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,280
It was the Premium Trinity patch.

1281
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,280
And it went out a little earlier this week,

1282
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,560
I think about Thursday-ish.

1283
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,720
And what happened is that it added a bunch of new features

1284
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,440
to the game.

1285
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:07,000
But the patch also removed the boot.ini file off

1286
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:15,880
of your Windows XP, which kind of fucks your operating system.

1287
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,080
And there was a quote from the official support page.

1288
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,880
Quote, if you are only using the classic client

1289
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,400
or installed the premium client using the full premium

1290
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,120
installer, then you are not affected.

1291
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:28,000
If you upgraded the classic client to the premium client

1292
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,280
using the content upgrade, then please read on.

1293
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,120
Check the root directory of your hard drive

1294
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,120
and see if you have a boot.ini file.

1295
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,720
If so, then you are not affected.

1296
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,400
The file is normally hidden, so you

1297
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,240
need to click Tools Folder Options View

1298
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,360
and select Show Hidden Files and Folders

1299
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,440
and uncheck Hide Protected Operating System Files

1300
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,440
to be able to see it.

1301
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,920
You can also blah, blah, blah, blah, so on and so on.

1302
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,600
What the fuck were you doing touching

1303
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,920
that file in the first place?

1304
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,920
That's what I want to know.

1305
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,640
How did that happen?

1306
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,280
Seriously, there's a part of me that goes, some pissed off

1307
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,160
bitch in this organization threw that in there,

1308
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,760
just to fuck with these guys.

1309
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,320
That's so sad.

1310
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,160
I bet she's planning on quitting.

1311
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:09,640
And so, program delete boot.ini.

1312
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,080
Bye, my two weeks are on.

1313
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:15,120
Let me know how the program works.

1314
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:15,840
For real.

1315
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,040
I quit.

1316
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,360
Frisbee says, uh-oh, SpaghettiOs.

1317
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,280
I'll take my severance pay now.

1318
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,720
Have fun storming the castle.

1319
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,720
I mean, yeah, don't touch the boot.ini file.

1320
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,800
But at the same time, Windows XP should,

1321
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,360
if you're going to delete a file like that, it should go,

1322
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,280
are you sure?

1323
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,640
Windows XP should have a little dialog box that says,

1324
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,080
when you delete this file, you will fuck your whole computer

1325
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:43,640
up.

1326
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,680
Are you sure you want to delete this file?

1327
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,640
And a little picture Bill Gates going, no, no, no.

1328
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,880
I bet there is something.

1329
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:54,520
But even if it does, this person now that I'm imagining

1330
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,680
is going, click yes for, are you sure?

1331
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,520
Rob D says, it sounds like the simcopter bug.

1332
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,120
Do you remember the simcopter bug?

1333
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:08,160
Where it was one of the first appearances of same sex

1334
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,720
relations in the game, because a gay programmer actually

1335
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:14,320
programmed it in there that guys would kiss guys

1336
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,320
on this guy's birthday.

1337
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,640
And then left the company.

1338
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:18,840
That's great.

1339
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,320
It was more than that, I think.

1340
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,120
There was a lot more than kissing going on there.

1341
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,400
Please, this is a family show.

1342
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,320
We don't need to go there.

1343
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,360
Right, this is a family show.

1344
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,040
This is a dysfunctional family show.

1345
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,880
All right, we're going to open up the Skype line

1346
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,340
and welcome the extended members of our dysfunctional family.

1347
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:36,960
That would be you folks, the listeners.

1348
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,280
1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1349
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,880
And I am dying to see how this works tonight when I only

1350
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:46,160
have half the strength out here on the Wi-Fi network

1351
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,160
out in the garage, and we're trying to stream a show.

1352
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,600
This could be very interesting, so we'll see what happens.

1353
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,200
Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1354
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,200
Or our username is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

1355
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:56,680
We have a call.

1356
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:57,760
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

1357
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,840
Who's this?

1358
01:03:58,840 --> 01:03:59,920
This is Ravenstaufen.

1359
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:00,800
How are you today?

1360
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:01,920
I am super.

1361
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:02,760
Thanks for asking.

1362
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,160
How are you?

1363
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,900
I am fine, and I got two things for you tonight.

1364
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,520
You was talking about the Dreamcast?

1365
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,160
We was.

1366
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,600
I actually found my Dreamcast, and my brother owned one.

1367
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:17,120
So I found my old Dreamcast, and it was see-through.

1368
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,280
I don't know why.

1369
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,480
I can't remember why.

1370
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,400
But it's see-through, and it's beautiful.

1371
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,280
Because you probably bought a case mod.

1372
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,080
Probably.

1373
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:27,840
Or maybe eBay.

1374
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,080
I can't remember anymore.

1375
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:30,200
My memory's fading.

1376
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:34,080
They did sell, though, a new case for the Dreamcast

1377
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,760
that you could make that was clear.

1378
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:40,280
And they also sold a bootleg of the Hello Kitty one, too.

1379
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,080
Does Rob got that one?

1380
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,520
Do I have what?

1381
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,880
The Hello Kitty Dreamcast?

1382
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,320
No, I do not have the Hello Kitty Dreamcast.

1383
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,040
I was actually very excited, because I

1384
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,200
found that I have two Dreamcasts.

1385
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,720
But then this guy named Loki said that one of his is his.

1386
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,960
So what's up with that?

1387
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,200
Why am I hearing myself?

1388
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:00,840
Is that better?

1389
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:01,160
Sorry about that.

1390
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:01,960
Yes, much better.

1391
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:04,080
Thank you.

1392
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,240
So what else is on your mind?

1393
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:05,880
That was one thing.

1394
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:06,480
What's the other?

1395
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,000
GameTap.

1396
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,120
GameTap's on my mind.

1397
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,720
I got a free month from GameTap.

1398
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:10,760
Very nice of them.

1399
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,960
You realize they released a Mac client

1400
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,720
to their beautiful GameTap?

1401
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,160
I did.

1402
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:15,480
I heard.

1403
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,320
Wait, hold on.

1404
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:20,160
Is SimCopter one of the games you can play in the GameTap?

1405
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,360
No.

1406
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:22,760
Oh, it's one of the ones you remove?

1407
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:23,720
Well, here's the thing.

1408
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,840
We got linked the Wikipedia article.

1409
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:26,480
Here it is.

1410
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,600
The game gained controversy when a designer

1411
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:32,520
inserted sprites of shirtless himbos, male bimbos,

1412
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:33,440
in speedo trunks.

1413
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:34,880
I love that term, himbos.

1414
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,880
I'm going to use that in the sentence every day.

1415
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,920
In speedo trunks, who hugged and kissed

1416
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,840
each other, who appear in great numbers on certain dates,

1417
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,680
their fluorescent nipples were drawn

1418
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,040
with a special rendering mode.

1419
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:49,080
It's usually reserved for fog-piercing runway landing

1420
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:52,280
lights, so they could easily be seen from long distances

1421
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:53,640
and bad weathers.

1422
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,720
An unintended emergent behavior of the code

1423
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:58,040
caused hundreds of himbos to swarm and crowd

1424
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:00,400
around the helicopter, where they would be slashed up

1425
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,800
by the blades and then need to be

1426
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:05,240
airlifted to the hospital, which earned the player easy money.

1427
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,120
The Easter egg was caught shortly after release

1428
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,560
and removed from future copies of the game.

1429
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:10,560
Here's how you access it.

1430
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:11,880
And then the designer was fired.

1431
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:12,640
He didn't leave.

1432
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:13,560
He got fired.

1433
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:15,280
Here's how you access it, too.

1434
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,800
Apparently, if you go into the game,

1435
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:19,280
you go into career mode, hit Control-Alt-X,

1436
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:25,960
and then you type in, warp me to career 29, or colon 29.

1437
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:29,240
And then once you've done that, you do Control-Alt-X,

1438
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,760
been there, done that.

1439
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,400
And then apparently, in a few seconds,

1440
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,680
about 300 guys in bathing suits will appear.

1441
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,560
It says, for fun, since there are no military helicopters

1442
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:43,560
in the game, fire tear gas at them.

1443
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,360
That's just wrong.

1444
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:46,720
All right, sorry, Ravenstauffer.

1445
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:47,600
I agree with that.

1446
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,240
I think it was disgruntled someone.

1447
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:52,480
But who the fuck is messing with the frickin' IDF

1448
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,480
file to corrupt your computer?

1449
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,000
They ever thought to them that it doesn't

1450
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,520
start your operating system?

1451
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,680
So how the hell do you find it in the first place?

1452
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,440
Somebody needs to explain funny, not funny.

1453
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,760
Deleting my boot INI file, not funny.

1454
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,840
Himbos, funny.

1455
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:12,160
So if you're going to do something disgruntled,

1456
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,800
make it funny.

1457
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,000
Yeah, but you can't find it.

1458
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,800
They said their thing is like, you

1459
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:21,000
can't get in the operating system, how do you find it?

1460
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:21,840
You're screwed.

1461
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:24,320
You have to use a disk, basically.

1462
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,520
So anyhow, I'm sorry.

1463
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,680
What was the other thing you wanted to call in about tonight?

1464
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,840
It's about the Mac client of GameTap.

1465
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:33,440
There's a brand new Mac client.

1466
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,000
I need to check it out.

1467
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,260
But do you still have to have the Intel

1468
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:38,800
chip in your Mac for it to work?

1469
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,800
Oh, then never mind.

1470
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,760
Nah, I can't use it.

1471
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,000
Lame.

1472
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,480
But it's much lighter.

1473
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,200
More games run smoothly on the Mac.

1474
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,000
And on the Windows side as well, everything

1475
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,440
runs great on both sides.

1476
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,720
But now you can't run the Windows-based games

1477
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:53,440
on the Mac, right?

1478
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,760
They just took that category out ahead.

1479
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:55,840
No, no, that's gone.

1480
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:56,360
I figured.

1481
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:59,600
The Windows games, so you lost like 800 games on the Mac side.

1482
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,320
Oh, Jesus.

1483
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:02,760
Well, but that makes sense.

1484
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:05,040
I mean, but you still get all the arcade games.

1485
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,520
You get the Genesis games.

1486
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:07,520
Oh, well, that's cool.

1487
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:08,840
Atari 2600?

1488
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,040
DOS.

1489
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,600
Oh, you get the DOS games?

1490
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,800
You get DOS games as well.

1491
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,240
Well, that makes sense because of the chip.

1492
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,040
Well, that's cool.

1493
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:15,560
Well, good.

1494
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:16,200
I'm glad.

1495
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,640
There were a lot of people really pissed off

1496
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,800
about the fact that there was no GameTap Mac client.

1497
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,520
So good for them.

1498
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:21,960
I'm making good on that.

1499
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:22,800
I think one thing.

1500
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:26,000
I'm going to add one thing to that.

1501
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,360
I got a free month from them, so I'm happy about that.

1502
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,760
Who'd you have to blow to get that?

1503
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:31,240
No one.

1504
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,240
I just said I have problems with the PC version.

1505
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:37,240
I'm like, well, we'll just add another free month for you.

1506
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,920
Dang, I'm going to call GameTap and tell

1507
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:41,440
them I have some problems.

1508
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:45,200
Yeah, my boot INI file got deleted by your client.

1509
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,280
Let's see what happens.

1510
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,240
All right, Raven's Dolphin, any other quick thoughts

1511
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,160
before I let you go and get to somebody else?

1512
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,720
No, but I think that sucks.

1513
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,840
How do you get a game like that and just boot a game

1514
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,720
and you go like, well, I got it.

1515
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:00,080
And then you restart your computer, and you're like,

1516
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:00,880
what the fuck?

1517
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:01,800
What happened?

1518
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,440
Yeah, it sucks to be those guys.

1519
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,560
I'm really sorry to all the EVE Online players who

1520
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:06,800
got fucked over by that one.

1521
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:07,440
It sucks to be you.

1522
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:08,680
All right, I'm going back to Godfather.

1523
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,600
All right, see you.

1524
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,120
All right, if you want to give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR.

1525
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,160
Our user name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1526
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,920
We'll also get to some last minute stories,

1527
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,400
and then the show is done.

1528
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,080
Hooray.

1529
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,980
I mean, aw, that's sad, because then there's

1530
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:23,520
no more OLR till next week.

1531
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,000
What are you going to do?

1532
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,880
All right, phone's not ringing just yet,

1533
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,200
so let's get a couple of quick last minute stories.

1534
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,120
Oh, I lied.

1535
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:31,760
Here it comes.

1536
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,120
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

1537
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,280
Who's this?

1538
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:37,280
Hey, Sky, it's Jonathan F. Your fantasy star whore.

1539
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,240
Well, hello, our fantasy star whore.

1540
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:40,960
How are you?

1541
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,640
I'm doing just fine here.

1542
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:46,200
Are you playing the abortion of the aluminous,

1543
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:48,360
or whatever that's called?

1544
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,000
Ambition of the aluminous, actually.

1545
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,760
I see.

1546
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,480
Yeah, you can find me running around with a rappy called

1547
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,880
Brightstar.

1548
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,720
Anyway, I wanted to just call in,

1549
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:00,080
let you know about some of the big stories that are

1550
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,200
going on right now with this.

1551
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,600
The first big one is that there's actually

1552
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,600
another expansion coming out.

1553
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:10,360
But the thing about this one is that it's for the PSP only.

1554
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:12,000
And funny enough, it's named.

1555
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,680
Wait, the PSP?

1556
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,360
Yeah, PSP's getting a fantasy star game.

1557
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,120
So wait, this can't be an expansion.

1558
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,440
This is a whole new game, right?

1559
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,880
Yeah, it's a whole new game.

1560
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,600
Well, basically what it is, it's going

1561
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,560
to expand upon the story that's already there

1562
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:28,120
and add some new missions into it.

1563
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:29,480
And the real funny thing about it

1564
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,960
is that when you condense it from its original name,

1565
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:35,520
fantasy star portable, it makes PSP.

1566
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,440
Oh, no, there you go.

1567
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:39,080
So PSP on the PSP.

1568
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,280
Exactly.

1569
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:41,800
There you have it.

1570
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:42,320
Interesting.

1571
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,840
So what else is going on in the fantasy star world?

1572
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,800
How was the new expansion received?

1573
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,680
Because I know the fantasy star universe kind of

1574
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,480
turned some people off to the series.

1575
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,080
It wasn't all that and a bag of chips for some people.

1576
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:57,320
But I guess some of the things they added back in

1577
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,880
with this expansion are supposedly

1578
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:02,480
making the game a little more kind of like it used to be?

1579
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,280
Exactly.

1580
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,960
In fact, go ahead.

1581
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,640
I'm sorry, go ahead.

1582
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,600
Oh, OK.

1583
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,800
Basically what's coming back in this version,

1584
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,600
actually, starting in just a couple of short weeks

1585
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,680
here in Japan, or over in Japan, I mean,

1586
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:22,240
there's going to be an event called the Maximum Attack G,

1587
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:24,880
whereby they are bringing back some of the original fantasy

1588
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,200
star online stages.

1589
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,560
Now that could be kind of cool.

1590
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,760
I know.

1591
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,680
They're going to bring back Cave.

1592
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:37,000
And what were the names of those stages in the old one?

1593
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
They had Cave and, what, Ship?

1594
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,120
Well, yeah, the Forest Cave, Mines, and Ruins,

1595
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,160
they are all confirmed at this point, pretty much.

1596
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:48,320
Wow, that's kind of cool.

1597
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,640
Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any episode two, three,

1598
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,600
or four stages coming back.

1599
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,200
But who knows?

1600
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,400
That could be for yet another expansion.

1601
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:56,800
You know, I need to get back.

1602
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,080
You know what, dammit, I am getting

1603
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,920
so sick of some of the MMOs I'm playing now,

1604
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,880
I think I need to give PSU another shot.

1605
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:03,760
I think I need to give this game another shot.

1606
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:04,280
I really do.

1607
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,080
You want mine?

1608
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:05,580
Huh?

1609
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:06,160
You want mine?

1610
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,160
No, I have the game.

1611
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,360
Oh, I was going to burn mine.

1612
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,160
I was thinking about, wait, how much

1613
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:15,960
does Abortion of the Illuminous cost to download on Xbox?

1614
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:19,640
I think it was 2,000 points.

1615
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:20,880
I'm trying to remember.

1616
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:21,720
That's not too bad.

1617
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,040
That's about 20 bucks.

1618
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,960
I don't know, I'll have to think about it.

1619
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,640
You know what, there was some things about PSU I kind of miss.

1620
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:28,880
It wasn't horrible.

1621
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:29,640
So I don't know.

1622
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,400
I miss PSO.

1623
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,720
I heard there, you know what, we got news coming in.

1624
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:34,640
Is this true?

1625
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,080
That they're shutting off Blue Burst is going on.

1626
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:37,580
No.

1627
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:39,640
Yeah, so it's going to be the next thing.

1628
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:43,080
The US Blue Burst servers are going down.

1629
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,640
That's stupid, because I was actually

1630
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,180
going to start playing that again.

1631
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:49,680
Go ahead.

1632
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:51,600
Yeah, one of the big questions right now

1633
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,480
is, is the clumsy orbit and the rest of the GM team

1634
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:00,060
going to try to get in contact with the Japanese team

1635
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:02,760
to see if they can merge our characters over?

1636
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,840
As far as I know, there hasn't been a response yet,

1637
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,680
but they've at least passed the idea over.

1638
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,400
Because I still have Blue Burst installed on my computer,

1639
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:18,000
and I still have an account with active characters on it.

1640
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:23,920
Yeah, and basically it shuts down in March.

1641
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:24,920
Well, sorry to hear it.

1642
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:25,880
How dare they?

1643
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:27,880
All right, well, we've got to let you go here

1644
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:28,960
as soon as we get some more calls,

1645
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,800
but any last thoughts from our Phantasy Star

1646
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,640
horror, Jonathan F?

1647
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,480
Just one thing.

1648
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,080
I wanted to announce a little project

1649
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:38,280
I'm working on for the 20th anniversary of Phantasy Star.

1650
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,080
Oh, go for it.

1651
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:43,280
It's called Phantasy Star Dreams Forever.

1652
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:46,280
And basically what it is, it's a remix album,

1653
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,480
which basically goes through the history of Phantasy

1654
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,200
Star from the original Sega Master System game

1655
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,560
all the way up to Phantasy Star Universe.

1656
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,800
And it's going to be a track list of about 108 tracks

1657
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,280
that's going to basically be all developed by the community.

1658
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,640
I'm just going to take more of a general manager position

1659
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:03,880
on things here, aside from maybe just a couple of contributions.

1660
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:06,920
And you can read up all the details at the website

1661
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:21,380
phantasystarmun

1662
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:27,360
online right now, if you want, I'll send you a link to it

1663
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,360
through the chat.

1664
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:29,360
Do that.

1665
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:30,360
All right.

1666
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:31,360
Please do.

1667
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:32,360
All right.

1668
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:33,360
Thanks you so much.

1669
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,360
And have fun with Phantasy Star.

1670
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:35,360
Maybe see you soon.

1671
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,360
All right.

1672
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:37,360
Always glad to be on the show.

1673
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:38,360
All right.

1674
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:39,360
Take care, buddy.

1675
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,360
Jonathan was out here a long time ago.

1676
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:41,360
Remember him?

1677
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,360
He came out here a long, long time ago,

1678
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,360
and he was talking about tech TV and stuff.

1679
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,360
It was pretty good.

1680
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,360
I'm glad to hear he's listening again.

1681
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,360
All right.

1682
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:47,360
Call us.

1683
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:52,080
We're on Game OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

1684
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,560
Let's get some last minute stories real quick.

1685
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,560
Loki.

1686
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:55,560
They're breaking the studio.

1687
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:56,560
I know.

1688
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:57,560
They're throwing away.

1689
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,560
Look, the stuffed animals are there to look cute,

1690
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:00,560
not to be thrown.

1691
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:01,560
I don't care if all that is off.

1692
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:03,800
One last minute story here real quick.

1693
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:11,700
Apparently a dad has caught, or there was a dad who caught his son smoking pot.

1694
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:15,480
So what he did was he put his son's Guitar Hero 3 Christmas gift

1695
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:19,720
up on eBay to punish him.

1696
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,360
That's news.

1697
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,360
That is news.

1698
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,360
That's smart.

1699
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,360
That's great parenting.

1700
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,840
That is wonderful parenting.

1701
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,000
I love it.

1702
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
It's actually still on eBay right now.

1703
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Nice.

1704
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

1705
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Who's this?

1706
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
It's like Yuzaku.

1707
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Hey, Yuzaku.

1708
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
What's on your mind?

1709
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:42,840
Nah, just nothing chilling, you know, going through the gaming league as usual.

1710
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:43,840
All right.

1711
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:44,840
Let me rephrase the question.

1712
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,600
How much do we owe this telephone call tonight?

1713
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,320
I don't know.

1714
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:55,720
The usual arrow smashing news, like how Supernova 2 is supposed to come out this month, and

1715
01:15:55,720 --> 01:16:02,600
the fact that Betsun is being dicks about holding EMUs back.

1716
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:07,080
Yeah, I guess I've heard about Supernova 2, but I want to share with you my revelation

1717
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,080
I had the other day.

1718
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,760
Can I talk to you man-to-man a little bit?

1719
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:15,200
Here's a revelation I had the other day, is that I was on Xbox Live and I was playing

1720
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:19,160
Portal because I've been playing Portal a lot this week, and my buddy Shane used to

1721
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:24,760
work at Konami, had a big part in DDR, and he doesn't live here in California, he lives

1722
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:29,200
in Kansas, so we talk a lot over Xbox Live, and I noticed that he was playing DDR Universe

1723
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:33,480
2, and he sent me a message on Xbox Live and he said, you know, Universe 2, blah blah blah,

1724
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:37,360
and he was telling me his thoughts on the game, and I came to a realization, Zaku, and

1725
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,080
that realization was, I'm kind of over DDR.

1726
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:43,080
I really am.

1727
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:46,360
There's not a lot that I care about that's going on in DDR anymore.

1728
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:52,160
I'm not getting a boner over Supernova 2 like a lot of people are, and it's sad to say,

1729
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:56,320
because obviously without DDR the show would not exist, without DDR I would not know Jamie,

1730
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:01,680
without DDR I would not know Loki, without DDR I would not know Puppy, DDR has fucked

1731
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:06,680
up my life in so many good ways, and bad, I mean, because there was that house I lived

1732
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:08,800
in five years ago, but that's a whole other story.

1733
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,960
In the real world, Rob edition.

1734
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:11,960
Oh my god.

1735
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:12,960
Oh wow.

1736
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:18,680
That's not so bad, I mean, people grow out of it, people stay on, and move on with their

1737
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:19,680
lives.

1738
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:22,240
Zaku, I didn't grow out of DDR.

1739
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:23,600
Just don't care about it as much anymore.

1740
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:27,600
DDR has refused to change over the past five years.

1741
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,920
That's the problem I'm having with it.

1742
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:32,760
It's the same fucking game I played five years ago, and I'm just kind of done with it.

1743
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:37,360
Yeah, but I mean, I know people, most of the people that I know that used to, you know,

1744
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:41,160
they're like some of the best in the city, they don't play as much anymore, they pretty

1745
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:42,560
much moved on.

1746
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:49,200
I'm telling you, if Konami wants to bring me back, they just need to innovate the game.

1747
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,320
It's possible.

1748
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:54,320
They're trying to do it in little ways on the consoles, but they need to do it in a

1749
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,400
major way in the arcade, and bring people back.

1750
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,840
I mean, yeah, in the arcade they tried EMUs, but there's other factors that are holding

1751
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:00,840
it back.

1752
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:05,520
From what I hear, Betson is the reason why it's not happening in this country at all.

1753
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:14,640
They don't believe that it's going to be successful, but I know Konami tries their damn hardest

1754
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:20,600
and it's just other folks that are just being dicks about it, and they're just non-believers

1755
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:26,040
and it's like they don't really give a shit about it.

1756
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,640
I wish I knew more about programming.

1757
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:32,120
I would want to design my own music game that was dancing that's not a rip-off of DDR or

1758
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,240
In the Groove, or any of that stuff.

1759
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,840
I have a lot of ideas floating around my head for the past five years.

1760
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:36,840
I just wish I could do it.

1761
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:37,840
What?

1762
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,200
Why don't they make a Para Para game without Para Para music?

1763
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:44,880
Because I remember when fucking Prestige used to fucking break out the Para shit, that was

1764
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:45,880
kind of cool-looking.

1765
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:52,320
Granted, you know, people make fun of it just like DDR, but it was a little different.

1766
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:56,640
Or they could just add a Ticket Redemption game to DDR and there you go, it's going to

1767
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:57,640
sell.

1768
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:00,440
Oh, just throw it in a grave while you're at it.

1769
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:02,440
Ever heard of that game Spider Stomp?

1770
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:09,320
Those red buttons on the floor, and you get tickets out of them, and they light up.

1771
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:14,800
Isn't that pretty DDR a little bit more than it already is?

1772
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:19,360
Zaku, let me tell you this too, this is just going to make you cry even more.

1773
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:24,920
I'm very sorry, but I have to admit, okay, when we went to John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza,

1774
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:27,520
they have a DDR Supernova machine there, right?

1775
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,280
And we were like, oh, Supernova.

1776
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:33,600
But then I looked to my left, and I was like, oh my god, they have Jumpin' Jackpot!

1777
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,640
And I ran over, and I played Jumpin' Jackpot!

1778
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:42,040
Last time I played Supernova was yesterday, and then before that it was like, you know,

1779
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:43,040
weeks.

1780
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,760
I could go, I literally just threw up the line.

1781
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:49,760
We saw the DDR machine, and Dan and I were like, because my husband was here with us,

1782
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:57,040
we were like, hey look, it's the new, oh shoot, Airplane Game, After Burner.

1783
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:02,000
And we spent most of the time either on the After Burner or on that ride that William

1784
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
and I rode.

1785
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:08,440
Not even that, I mean, I'm also getting into other arcade games like Wangan, I'm playing

1786
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:14,640
more Initial D now, so I mean, and I'm playing a lot more other Hermione games, so I mean,

1787
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:18,200
DDR is not really this much of an aspect in my life as it would be.

1788
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:22,840
Sure, I mean, I try to go out to, you know, most of the tournaments, but as far as, you

1789
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:25,520
know, trying to get better, it's the least of my worries right now.

1790
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:29,720
Well see, I got the thing though, another thing there about DDR tournaments, that's

1791
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:35,040
another thing that hasn't changed in years because it's already hit that plateau where

1792
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:38,120
everybody's getting triple A's in the last couple years.

1793
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:43,880
In the group, right, you know, R21, folks are able to innovate it by just creating pure

1794
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:46,840
sight read tournaments through custom songs.

1795
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:52,240
I just went to one yesterday where they had like about 18 songs, 18 brand new, you know,

1796
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:58,040
18 sim files never before released until that day, and it was just a pure sight read, you

1797
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:00,400
know, sight read tournament that just flexed out the ability to do that.

1798
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:04,520
I can't get too excited about people putting sim files on a cabinet and then saying, ooh,

1799
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,120
it's never been released before!

1800
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:10,680
That's a little different than Konami saying, hey, look at this bitches, Supernova 3, yeah,

1801
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:14,040
we're going to have the final round, that shit, now that's exciting, we got to wrap.

1802
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:18,600
That's one aspect, you could argue with that, I mean, it's an aspect of, you know, how our

1803
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:25,000
arrow smashers were, you know, for a better of a word, just, you know, continue the community

1804
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,320
or they just, you know, they just stay active.

1805
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:31,560
Here's the thing, and we got to get this call wrapped up so we can move on, take some more

1806
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:37,280
calls, but I will always have a soft, warm, fuzzy, cute spot in my heart for Bemani in

1807
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:42,080
general as well as DER for the many like good things the community brought, but if the game

1808
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,480
doesn't adapt, it's going to die.

1809
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:50,600
It is dying, currently, and the game has to adapt for it to survive, and I don't mean,

1810
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:59,280
oh my god, I got sent pictures of that, my first DDR, like, if that's adapting, then

1811
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,280
I want off the boat.

1812
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:05,400
That's basically Konami's intent of trying to, you know, suck money out of the dry, and

1813
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:11,360
eventually, remember, it's kind of like oil, it's not going to last forever, so, I mean,

1814
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:17,200
it has to find an alternative means of just keeping the series alive by trying to please

1815
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,480
as many people as possible.

1816
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:22,800
I've got to let you go, buddy, Zaku, but thank you for bringing up Bemani, as you usually

1817
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:28,240
do, and, you know, kind of allowing me to share my revelations with you.

1818
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:31,040
I was going to bring up other things, but I had to get it out.

1819
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,120
It's all right.

1820
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,120
Next time, Zaku.

1821
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,120
I'll talk to you next time.

1822
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:35,120
All right.

1823
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,200
We'll do one more call, if anything comes through.

1824
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,200
877-GAME-OLR.

1825
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:41,560
Yeah, that will play social commentary about oil, too.

1826
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:42,560
No more stories?

1827
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,560
Really?

1828
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:44,560
Jamie, you have anything?

1829
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:45,560
Today's boring week.

1830
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:46,560
This is boring.

1831
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:47,560
All right.

1832
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:48,560
Well, then one more call, and we'll call it a show.

1833
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:52,840
Have you seen, read the story that came up a couple days ago about that new PSP game

1834
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,040
called, I think it's Potsipon.

1835
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:58,160
It's like another, like a, it's like a music game where you have all these little armies

1836
01:22:58,160 --> 01:22:59,160
of creatures.

1837
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:02,440
Is that related to Panledipon, which is, um, no, okay.

1838
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:03,920
It's a little bit different.

1839
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:08,560
It looks like, I don't know, it's a little stretch, but looks like LocoRoco, a little

1840
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:09,560
bit.

1841
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:10,560
Hmm.

1842
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:13,560
You know, I'm actually looking in chat, and caller, just hold on just a minute, we'll

1843
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:16,440
get to you in a second, because I picked up a call and I haven't acknowledged them yet,

1844
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:19,600
but, um, let's see, I'm just looking at some interesting, because obviously a lot of our

1845
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:23,180
hardcore listeners have been listening to us since the days where we were like nothing

1846
01:23:23,180 --> 01:23:24,180
but BomaniTalk.

1847
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:28,520
GS191 says, the problem with DDR in arcades is basically that arcades are basically dead

1848
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,660
and nobody wants to do shit about it.

1849
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:34,560
The problem with DDR console releases is that the music is way too mainstream and alienates

1850
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:41,180
the core audience, um, and Jaded says, because the concept is overdone, but the music concept

1851
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:42,180
is great.

1852
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:47,040
Um, and I, you know, I kind of, I kind of agree a little bit, a little bit, although

1853
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:51,560
there is some type of allure to being able to play like popular radio songs on there,

1854
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:57,640
I do think that DDR kind of opened my eyes, so to speak, to a whole other genres of music

1855
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:01,520
that I didn't know existed before, you know, and some of those, you know, and who could

1856
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:07,040
forget, I, I, I, I'm your little butterfly, who could forget how catchy that freaking

1857
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:10,920
song was the first time they heard it, except for Loki, you're just Mr. Negative, or Boom

1858
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:16,200
Boom Dollar, or you know, just a variety of music that was in that game, and that, I think

1859
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:20,440
the Dance Maniacs series in general that kind of brought us a lot of music has been lost

1860
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,440
over the past few years, which is kind of sad.

1861
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:26,840
Because after, you know, after I started playing DDR for the first year or so, I actually started

1862
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:31,440
going out and looking up these artists and finding what other music they had, and you

1863
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:37,160
know, finding some good stuff that I still listen to, but it's kind of a, it just opens

1864
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:38,640
your eyes a little bit.

1865
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:43,640
Well, the whole, the going to the Dance Mania CDs, all they are now is just more rehashes

1866
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:44,640
of the same.

1867
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:45,640
Yeah.

1868
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:46,640
They're not exciting.

1869
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:50,920
But then I look at UltraMix 2, and that opened my eyes to the whole synth pop, and what,

1870
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:54,120
you know, indie, different drum label stuff, and there's some awesome music on there, and

1871
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:57,160
some of the bands that were in UltraMix 2 are like my favorite bands right now.

1872
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:58,160
It's good stuff.

1873
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:01,720
Anyway, I just want to say real quick, Rob D in chat says, I disagree with that.

1874
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:03,560
I just think that DDR needs something new.

1875
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:07,000
Releasing games with new songs just isn't going to cut it, and that's absolutely what

1876
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
I'm saying too.

1877
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
That's absolutely what I'm saying.

1878
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,520
All right, anyway, let's, I'm sorry, I've made our caller wait.

1879
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,520
Caller, are you still there?

1880
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,520
Uh, yeah.

1881
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:14,520
Hi, who is this?

1882
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:15,520
It's GS68.

1883
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:16,520
Hi, GS68, what's on your mind?

1884
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:17,520
Sorry to make you wait.

1885
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:18,520
Uh, yeah.

1886
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:26,480
I've read about Super Smash Bros. Brawl online, and it's looking good.

1887
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:29,480
I'm sorry, you read it, you're cutting out a little bit, you read about it online, and

1888
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:31,400
it is looking good, or it isn't?

1889
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:32,400
It isn't.

1890
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,560
I just sent you a link to show you why.

1891
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,160
Okay, let me look at this.

1892
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:39,040
Why, and in your mind, why is this not looking good?

1893
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,040
Is this about the friend codes?

1894
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:45,240
Well, for example, if you get disconnected, and the CPU takes over, like, no one will

1895
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:49,960
know that you disconnected, I mean, they'll keep on thinking that it's the same person,

1896
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:54,960
which really bugs me, because now you can't tell if someone will have a, just plain computer

1897
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:55,960
instead.

1898
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:56,960
Yeah, but here's the thing, though.

1899
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,800
I don't know if it's not really indicating that the person's disconnected, or that it

1900
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:03,800
might say they've disconnected, but the computer player's still being, or the player is being

1901
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,680
controlling the computer now.

1902
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:07,240
That is, that is a very good point, yeah.

1903
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,880
I read about that earlier this week, where basically, just to recap for those who may

1904
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:14,240
not have heard, if you get disconnected, or your, you know, your Wii gets shut off, or

1905
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:17,280
your power goes off, or whatever, in the middle of a match, you lose connection, the computer

1906
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:21,080
will automatically take control of your character, so you're not having to wait, there's no buffer,

1907
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:22,080
anything like that.

1908
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:25,560
It's just that the computer takes over, but I understand what GSCCA is saying, is that,

1909
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:29,480
you know, how does this, you know, if all the players disconnect, and you're fighting

1910
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:33,560
the computer, how does online play differ from versus at all?

1911
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:40,300
Yeah, exactly, and plus, since no one knows that you disconnected, like, there's no shame

1912
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:43,480
in disconnecting anymore.

1913
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:46,560
That is true, there should be a swift kick in the butt for when you disconnect.

1914
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:47,560
But hopefully...

1915
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:50,640
But it's gonna reflect on their, their ranking, their stats, right?

1916
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:57,240
Actually, no, you won't, you won't see their names or anything, like, so you won't know

1917
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:58,440
who you're fighting in.

1918
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:02,480
I think that they're gonna address this stuff, I mean, this, what they've shown so far, they're

1919
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:06,480
just kinda going over features, they haven't really delved into the details of what's gonna

1920
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:07,480
be available on this.

1921
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:11,800
I love it, Jonathan F. says, send in Mr. Resetti if they disconnect.

1922
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:12,800
Brilliant idea.

1923
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,920
And Mr. Resetti's in there, isn't he?

1924
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:16,920
He is.

1925
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:17,920
So, there you go.

1926
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:22,400
But, you know, the Wii online stuff in general just kinda sucks, like, it really needs an

1927
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:28,440
upgrade or a backbone or something, because, like, I think, I think Nintendo's, go ahead,

1928
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:33,520
I think Nintendo's, like, trying to make online accessible for everyone, but in doing so,

1929
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,680
they're oversimplifying online.

1930
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:39,160
But let me tell you, okay, two stories for you.

1931
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:43,680
Hey, I'm in Geometry Wars Galaxies, and Geometry Wars Galaxies has online leaderboards, which

1932
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,680
is kinda cool.

1933
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:48,080
You can go there, you register your name when you first go on, you can go look at the leaderboards.

1934
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:52,840
But here's the thing, you can look at the leaderboards for the top ten scores or where

1935
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:55,240
you are on the leaderboards, and that's it.

1936
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:59,600
And you're just looking at a big list of names that mean nothing to you, because you can't

1937
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:04,240
filter the list by the friends on your Wii, you can't filter the list by anything but

1938
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:07,320
those things, so it's kinda pointless, it's kinda stupid.

1939
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:11,820
I applaud Bazaar for trying to, you know, but I get the feeling they're just really

1940
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:15,240
restricted by Nintendo's lack of an online mainframe.

1941
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:20,280
Well, that whole thing with the leaderboards is the same for Ghost Squad and the new Trauma

1942
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,760
Center as well.

1943
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:26,600
Oh, I guess, well, yeah, I guess that's true, I forgot, Trauma Center has the leaderboards

1944
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:27,600
too.

1945
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:28,600
So.

1946
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:31,960
At least I recognized a couple names on the leaderboards.

1947
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:32,960
Did you?

1948
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:36,760
Yeah, because they're from Game Facts, and I posted on Game Facts.

1949
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:37,760
Gotcha.

1950
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:38,760
There you go.

1951
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,080
I feel sorry for you for posting on Game Facts.

1952
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:43,440
Well, maybe there's some of that going on with Geometry Wars too, but my name on there

1953
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:48,240
is Rob O-L-R. At first I was just Rob, but then when I saw what the leaderboards looked

1954
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:52,180
like, I'm like, oh, I should be Rob O-L-R. But also, you don't automatically get your

1955
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:56,040
scores posted to the leaderboards, you have to go in, connect to the Wi-Fi connection

1956
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:59,420
and all that BS before your score finally gets posted.

1957
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:03,680
That's what really, that's what kinda tells me that it's not Bazaar's fault or, you know,

1958
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:08,240
the people that made the game, it's, you know, Nintendo's fault for having a weird online

1959
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:09,240
system.

1960
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:10,240
So.

1961
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:11,240
Anyhow.

1962
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:13,600
Anything else you want to share with listeners tonight?

1963
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:14,600
Um, no.

1964
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:15,600
All right.

1965
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,920
Well, thank you very much for calling and listening to the show.

1966
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:18,920
We appreciate it.

1967
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:19,920
Have a good one.

1968
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:20,920
You too.

1969
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:21,920
Bye bye.

1970
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,920
All right.

1971
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:27,140
Well, I guess that is going to be it for the calls tonight, and that's going to bring our

1972
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:30,640
show to a close as well, but thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening tonight.

1973
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:31,920
Let's get to everybody's final thoughts.

1974
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:35,960
Puppy, thank you for being here, and I hope you enjoyed the new studio and the...

1975
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:37,840
It's much easier to breathe in here.

1976
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,000
Yes, it is.

1977
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,680
It's not nearly as uncomfortable as all cramming into an eight-foot space.

1978
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:43,680
Exactly.

1979
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,920
Well, any final thoughts, sir?

1980
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:51,240
Um, I am not looking forward to the next three months of class.

1981
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:52,920
Sorry to hear it.

1982
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,720
Loki, anyways, what's your final thought?

1983
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:59,520
I'm buying computer parts.

1984
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:04,680
My final thought is I want pie again.

1985
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:06,760
I say that every week, but I really, really do want pie.

1986
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:09,160
I have frozen pies in my freezer right now.

1987
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:10,440
Well, did you bring one with you?

1988
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:11,440
I did not.

1989
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:12,440
Bastard.

1990
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:13,920
I also have Smirnoff's too.

1991
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,440
Dark Soccer.

1992
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:16,440
Was that you?

1993
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:18,960
We were playing rock band last night, and you're like, yeah, I've just been having two

1994
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:19,960
Smirnoff's.

1995
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:20,960
This should be fun.

1996
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:21,960
Yeah.

1997
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:22,960
It was fun.

1998
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:23,960
Yeah, I played rock band this week too.

1999
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:24,960
It was a good time.

2000
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:25,960
So we did a whole band last night.

2001
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,800
Anyway, Dark Soccer, your final thought?

2002
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:31,200
I just got a message on MySpace from some guy I went to high school with.

2003
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:34,680
Was it somebody you want to hear from or not?

2004
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:40,600
I messaged him once and forgot that I did it, and then like, you know, six months later,

2005
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:42,600
he's messaging me back.

2006
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:43,600
So I think it's kind of funny.

2007
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,640
Now that is not checking your MySpace regularly.

2008
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:46,640
Well, no.

2009
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:47,640
It's too bad.

2010
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:48,640
No.

2011
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:49,640
All right.

2012
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:51,320
Anyhow, I guess that's it.

2013
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:53,400
We're going to call it a show.

2014
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:56,520
Thank you guys so much for downloading us and supporting independent podcasting.

2015
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:57,560
We couldn't do it without you guys.

2016
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:01,240
If you like what you hear, please tell two friends about the program or two enemies.

2017
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:04,440
We really don't care who it is just as long as the word gets out there because then we

2018
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:06,120
can slowly take over the world.

2019
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:08,120
We will see you next week.

If you're not dead.

2031
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:32,480
Why is my phone ringing?

2032
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,480
I don't know.

2033
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:34,480
