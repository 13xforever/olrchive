[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:21,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio

3
00:00:35,112 --> 00:00:35,933
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

4
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:03,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Smash Bros.

5
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,306
[SPEAKER_14]: and they haven't really said exactly when, but it's going to be quarter two of next year.

6
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:39,411
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, I don't know.

7
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:43,317
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not good, I guess, but at least you're not waiting until Christmas of next year.

8
00:01:43,597 --> 00:01:47,383
[SPEAKER_14]: But aren't the Brits kind of used to getting screwed like this in a way, you know?

9
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:59,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, maybe, but here's the thing though, I don't really see what they, I mean, other than changing the screen resolution and stuff that it renders at, you're not really localizing it for Europe, so.

10
00:01:59,356 --> 00:02:05,579
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to know, like, are they having to, you know, produce extra copies and that takes so freaking long, or what is it?

11
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,440
[SPEAKER_14]: What causes things to be so slow?

12
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:07,740
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get it.

13
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:14,664
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess it's just, you know, changing some of the programming, because, I mean, if you think about it, a lot of the games that they get in Europe we don't get over here for a while, so.

14
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:16,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that kind of sucks.

15
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,791
[SPEAKER_04]: MacMan says, Europe, the shaft of the gaming world.

16
00:02:19,811 --> 00:02:21,831
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I know we have quite a few people over there that listen.

17
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:22,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure aren't happy about this.

18
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:25,212
[SPEAKER_14]: They've already gotten some games we haven't had over here yet.

19
00:02:25,252 --> 00:02:32,134
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, they have Endless Ocean already, which, you know, I'm sure given the opportunity, they would say, fuck Endless Ocean, let's get Super Smash Bros.

20
00:02:32,214 --> 00:02:37,596
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, they do get a few games before we do, so... I don't know.

21
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:42,077
[SPEAKER_04]: RossDLUT in chat says, Loki, menus and stuff need to be made in other languages.

22
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:42,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Any announcer?

23
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:45,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, true, but I mean, still though...

24
00:02:46,938 --> 00:02:48,419
[SPEAKER_14]: for, like, some of the territories.

25
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,980
[SPEAKER_14]: They can release it in the English-speaking territories and stuff like that.

26
00:02:52,100 --> 00:03:00,384
[SPEAKER_14]: And also a lot of the games like, you know, Excite Truck and that kind of thing, when they were putting them out, they develop them for, like, usually it's English, Spanish, and French, I think.

27
00:03:01,285 --> 00:03:05,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially, all the Nintendo titles seem to be English, Spanish, and French even when they come out over here.

28
00:03:05,747 --> 00:03:05,987
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

29
00:03:06,147 --> 00:03:11,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, Canada and Mexico, you need French for Canada and Spanish for Mexico, so, you know, it's kind of like a region.

30
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:14,711
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I wouldn't think that that would, I mean, hold them back really too much.

31
00:03:15,651 --> 00:03:15,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

32
00:03:17,253 --> 00:03:23,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, sorry Europe, it looks like you're going to get screwed there, but we'll tell you how fun it is.

33
00:03:24,044 --> 00:03:25,106
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding, that's so mean.

34
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:36,947
[SPEAKER_04]: One, I guess, interesting kind of piece of news is that Nintendo is kind of, in a way, fessed up that they're not able to meet the needs of the Wii demand that's out there.

35
00:03:36,987 --> 00:03:43,791
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how the Wii seems to be, once again, for the second year in a row, the hot holiday toy that everybody's dying to get.

36
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:48,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo has decided to pull ads for its Wii console.

37
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:53,196
[SPEAKER_04]: And this story is out of the UK, actually, although I do believe it affects everybody.

38
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:59,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo is actually going to be redistributing the commercials they had scheduled up until Christmas through the first quarter of 2008.

39
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:09,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo spokesman said, "...we have been running the campaign all year round, but we want to take a responsible stance this Christmas and not fuel demand."

40
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:17,171
[SPEAKER_04]: An ad industry insider said, Production has been stepped up to 1.8 million units a month and Nintendo still cannot meet the demand.

41
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:37,133
[SPEAKER_04]: According to RawSteelUT in chat, eBay vultures are the only people buying the systems.

42
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:41,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Sad but true, there probably are quite a few of those folks buying it.

43
00:04:41,757 --> 00:04:44,679
[SPEAKER_04]: RawSteelUT also says software sales are still pathetic.

44
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,439
[SPEAKER_04]: You know why?

45
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a theory why.

46
00:04:47,062 --> 00:04:50,003
[SPEAKER_04]: because most people that are buying that system are perfectly content with Wii Sports.

47
00:04:50,643 --> 00:04:58,806
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people are buying this just for Wii Sports, especially when you start to look at the older crowd and the more casual gamers.

48
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:04,907
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the enabling game for the Nintendo Wii, and when it comes with the system, people don't think they need anything else.

49
00:05:05,227 --> 00:05:09,089
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, back in the day when we were buying 8-bit Nintendo systems with Super Mario Bros.

50
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:11,949
[SPEAKER_04]: and Duck Hunt, did we buy another game to go with it?

51
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:12,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily.

52
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Not always.

53
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Many kids found just that pack under their tree for Christmas.

54
00:05:16,111 --> 00:05:16,911
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

55
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:26,745
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, granted, I would also humor probably the implied statement there that there's not a lot of must-have software on the Wii right now outside of maybe like Mario Galaxy.

56
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:32,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there's a lot of good games out there, but there's a lot more really crappy games, and it's really hard to tell.

57
00:05:33,587 --> 00:05:34,147
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

58
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:05,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it'll be a little bit easier?

59
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,010
Little bit?

60
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,210
[SPEAKER_04]: But probably not.

61
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,971
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably want to get online in the stock inventory.

62
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:12,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, some of us waited in line.

63
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:14,272
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

64
00:06:14,612 --> 00:06:19,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet all the Nintendo fanboys and fangirls waited in line day one anyway, and they're just looking at this and laughing.

65
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,874
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of us just didn't care to buy a Wii.

66
00:06:23,275 --> 00:06:25,195
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true, and some people are like, eh, fuck Wii.

67
00:06:25,395 --> 00:06:28,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I should tell you, my mom told me she wanted a Wii.

68
00:06:30,271 --> 00:06:32,372
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you're not the first person to tell me that story.

69
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:38,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is, I'm just kind of saying, like, you know, I'm hearing a lot of people, their parents are wanting Wii's and getting into that.

70
00:06:38,534 --> 00:06:39,454
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's the sports game.

71
00:06:39,914 --> 00:06:42,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a parent that wants it for Wii Bowling.

72
00:06:42,395 --> 00:06:43,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Because she likes to bowl.

73
00:06:43,996 --> 00:06:47,617
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was funny because my mom almost played my old Nintendo more than I did.

74
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:51,979
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, actually she probably played it as much as I did.

75
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:55,660
[SPEAKER_11]: She wouldn't admit to it, but my mom was a gamer once.

76
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,621
[SPEAKER_11]: And she had her Game Boy and played lots of...

77
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:03,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Breakout, but, you know, now hearing my mom say, I want a Wii.

78
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:04,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you get me a Wii?

79
00:07:05,602 --> 00:07:08,765
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, I don't have $300, but we'll see.

80
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:12,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Piker Uno has a very interesting perspective.

81
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:16,872
[SPEAKER_04]: He's one of our listeners that lives over in Japan, and he says, I just bought one for my friend in the U.K.

82
00:07:18,614 --> 00:07:20,215
[SPEAKER_04]: There are plenty of Wiis in Japan.

83
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,317
[SPEAKER_04]: So, kind of interesting.

84
00:07:22,357 --> 00:07:25,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder what effect that's going to have, though, if you bought one for your friend in the U.K.,

85
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,240
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

86
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,379
[SPEAKER_11]: Assault Suits Vulcan

87
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:22,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Picaruno wanted to clarify something, speaking of the whole UK and how he's sending one to his friend.

88
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:29,345
[SPEAKER_04]: He said modern PAL TVs are NTSC compatible, which I guess that explains that.

89
00:08:29,365 --> 00:08:29,926
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool.

90
00:08:32,147 --> 00:08:40,633
[SPEAKER_04]: But he says 99% of NTSC TVs are not PAL compatible, which he discovered when he went over to Japan from London, where he was originally at.

91
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:46,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh boy, isn't high def supposed to be all the same no matter where you are?

92
00:08:46,878 --> 00:08:47,098
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

93
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:48,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we need to get on that quick.

94
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Because these whole differing TV formats makes things very frustrating.

95
00:08:53,251 --> 00:09:02,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, just for example, when I was really big into my Gorillaz fandom, I was importing some of the DVD CDs.

96
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:06,175
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would just run it through my laptop to the TV and no problem.

97
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:09,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so there you go.

98
00:09:09,976 --> 00:09:12,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, let's see here.

99
00:09:13,593 --> 00:09:19,356
[SPEAKER_14]: So for the US, you've got some good stuff coming out on the Virtual Console.

100
00:09:21,537 --> 00:09:24,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Including, you know, we talked about it last week, Pokemon Snap.

101
00:09:25,418 --> 00:09:26,239
[SPEAKER_14]: That's going to be coming out.

102
00:09:27,219 --> 00:09:29,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Baseball Stars 2 for the Neo Geo.

103
00:09:30,941 --> 00:09:33,282
[SPEAKER_14]: And also Ghosts and Goblins.

104
00:09:33,942 --> 00:09:34,903
[SPEAKER_14]: That was on the NES.

105
00:09:35,383 --> 00:09:36,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray for Pokemon Snap!

106
00:09:37,124 --> 00:09:41,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait to download this and play this and send all of you pictures of Pokemon I take.

107
00:09:42,768 --> 00:09:45,709
[SPEAKER_04]: which means you and you and are you on my Wii?

108
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:46,549
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have a Wii.

109
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:47,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then screw you.

110
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:57,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm going to definitely actually give that a download but I won't say I'll be downloading Ghosts and Goblins because we've actually broke out our Saturn for our annual tradition and Dan was playing Capcom Collection Volume 2.

111
00:09:58,332 --> 00:09:58,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.

112
00:09:58,912 --> 00:10:00,013
[SPEAKER_14]: This game is too damn hard.

113
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,473
[SPEAKER_14]: It is too damn hard.

114
00:10:01,493 --> 00:10:02,613
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to be downloading it.

115
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:03,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Because guess what?

116
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:04,974
[SPEAKER_11]: You play all the way through it and guess what?

117
00:10:05,154 --> 00:10:07,555
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to play all the way through it again to beat the game.

118
00:10:07,835 --> 00:10:08,655
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what do you get?

119
00:10:08,915 --> 00:10:09,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

120
00:10:09,915 --> 00:10:10,956
[SPEAKER_04]: The story is happy end.

121
00:10:10,976 --> 00:10:11,976
[SPEAKER_11]: You kick Satan's butt.

122
00:10:12,603 --> 00:10:12,783
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

123
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:17,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyway, I will definitely check out Pokemon Snap, so I'm excited about that.

124
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:20,266
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something I'm kind of curious to check out as well.

125
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:27,228
[SPEAKER_04]: A Ninja Party game is coming to the Nintendo Wii and the Nintendo DS in March of next year.

126
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninja Reflex is the name of the game.

127
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:30,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

128
00:10:50,950 --> 00:11:02,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyway, EA notes that ninja reflexes will center around doing challenges and testing your reaction time, which is very appropriate for a ninja game.

129
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:04,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a quote.

130
00:11:04,994 --> 00:11:06,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Millisecond precision.

131
00:11:07,775 --> 00:11:08,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like fun.

132
00:11:09,775 --> 00:11:10,175
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

133
00:11:10,555 --> 00:11:13,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you can calibrate it or something to give it that extra precision.

134
00:11:13,616 --> 00:11:13,976
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

135
00:11:14,936 --> 00:11:17,397
[SPEAKER_11]: That just sounds sort of nifty cool.

136
00:11:17,717 --> 00:11:17,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

137
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:18,698
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

138
00:11:19,938 --> 00:11:20,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll check it out.

139
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:27,336
[SPEAKER_11]: This is fairly, fairly interesting stuff for anyone who has a Wii.

140
00:11:27,617 --> 00:11:42,289
[SPEAKER_11]: If you join Club Nintendo and you would use your previous Nintendo website login, you can buy Wii Points for four stars for every Wii Point using your old stars from the Nintendo Club.

141
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:45,092
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is actually Nintendo-Europe.com.

142
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:48,495
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if they're doing anything like that in the U.S., but

143
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:49,409
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish.

144
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:55,250
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a loyalty program that they had going on where if you did stuff, you had all these stars.

145
00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:00,471
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can go through and use your points to buy games or go shopping or do stuff.

146
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:03,692
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of nice that you can finally get something for it, you know?

147
00:12:04,052 --> 00:12:05,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think it's pretty cool.

148
00:12:06,112 --> 00:12:09,513
[SPEAKER_11]: As for all those people who saved up your stars, congrats to you.

149
00:12:13,053 --> 00:12:15,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, let's see here.

150
00:12:15,794 --> 00:12:17,434
[SPEAKER_14]: This is also kind of interesting.

151
00:12:17,961 --> 00:12:37,475
[SPEAKER_14]: Usually you would think Gamefly with rentals for games and stuff, but now they're offering Gamefly Tunes, which is a partnership with a company called Brand Racket, and they're offering the subscribers five free pre-selected songs to download each month.

152
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:44,280
[SPEAKER_14]: And I guess that's going to highlight up-and-coming and established artists, and

153
00:12:45,251 --> 00:12:48,513
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, people that aren't subscribed to the service can download one.

154
00:12:49,213 --> 00:12:59,177
[SPEAKER_14]: And I guess this month, music including artists like RJD2, Thievery Corporation, Shadows Fall, OK Go, and Little Brother.

155
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Hmm, that's interesting that they would be doing that kind of stuff.

156
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:06,601
[SPEAKER_14]: And as far as I'm aware, I don't think that's actually any video game music.

157
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:10,702
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I actually downloaded some of those songs.

158
00:13:10,943 --> 00:13:13,984
[SPEAKER_15]: And, I mean, they are up-and-coming artists, so they aren't really...

159
00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:17,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of them are okay, others aren't that great.

160
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:20,703
[SPEAKER_15]: I imagine that probably every month is going to be more of the same.

161
00:13:23,305 --> 00:13:27,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I mean, OK Go was, they're in Rock Band, but, I don't know.

162
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:29,870
[SPEAKER_14]: Free's good, I guess.

163
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:31,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Free's good.

164
00:13:31,692 --> 00:13:35,935
[SPEAKER_15]: I already have both of OK Go's other albums, and the rest of their stuff just sounds the same.

165
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:38,237
[SPEAKER_15]: Just less entertaining.

166
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:40,899
[SPEAKER_15]: And kind of boring in some cases.

167
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:44,302
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't listen to a lot of the stuff that you kids are listening to these days.

168
00:13:45,302 --> 00:13:49,166
[SPEAKER_15]: You and your old radio discs.

169
00:13:49,506 --> 00:13:50,087
[SPEAKER_15]: 80s Forever.

170
00:13:50,107 --> 00:13:52,990
[SPEAKER_15]: 8-track tapes.

171
00:13:55,332 --> 00:13:56,734
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's cassette tapes.

172
00:13:57,935 --> 00:13:58,475
[SPEAKER_04]: That's too old.

173
00:13:58,615 --> 00:14:04,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on to talking about something that could be all the rage in a couple of years, or very soon, who knows.

174
00:14:04,548 --> 00:14:15,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently a patent was filed by Apple back in September of 2006 and now it has just come out to light because I guess these things take a while to hit the public internet.

175
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:20,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently there is going to be multi-touch technology in this game.

176
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:30,073
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently what it is basically, I mean obviously they already have the iPhone, but they want to apply this touch technology, the multi-touch thing, to gaming.

177
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:35,374
[SPEAKER_04]: So they say, quote, this is being used for a game or a gaming application.

178
00:14:35,914 --> 00:14:46,157
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, we all know about the iPhone, but now we're kind of talking about that possibly this patent was actually filed to do gaming on the iPhone, possibly a music-based game.

179
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:52,139
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, this really doesn't come as much as a surprise because on the current iPods, they've gone into gaming a little bit.

180
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:57,240
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just makes sense to me that on the iPhones and the iTouches and all this stuff, they're going to get into this as well.

181
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:02,243
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, and remember how wonderful those games are on the iPods already.

182
00:15:04,024 --> 00:15:06,966
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm being sarcastic, by the way, because they're not very good.

183
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:10,268
[SPEAKER_14]: What about the one that came out from Harmonix?

184
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:11,929
[SPEAKER_14]: Phase, thank you.

185
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:15,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Phase was okay, but seriously, the rest of them sucked.

186
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:16,913
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I don't know.

187
00:15:17,173 --> 00:15:25,699
[SPEAKER_14]: But then again, there's not much you can do with just a jog wheel, so having multiple touch screen stuff on there, yeah, that would be a lot better, obviously.

188
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:26,379
[SPEAKER_14]: But

189
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:34,099
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't, I don't know, you're going to get as much gaming out of this as you are an N-Gage, so, seriously.

190
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess time will tell, but it is very interesting that that came up, nevertheless.

191
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:55,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Always interesting are the emails that you guys send us every week at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, and every week, Jamie dives in headfirst into our big old mailbag and pulls out a few of the emails that she likes and reads them for us here, live on air, and that's what she's going to do right now in our mailbag segment.

192
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Email, email, email.

193
00:16:06,985 --> 00:16:16,435
[SPEAKER_11]: And just as a point of order, I will say that I have read every email that comes through and some are not being read, you know, on air because we got a bunch of them.

194
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:18,357
[SPEAKER_11]: So I will read a few of these.

195
00:16:18,657 --> 00:16:21,060
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of them was sent from an iPhone and that makes me laugh.

196
00:16:23,752 --> 00:16:32,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey guys, I love the show.

197
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:35,158
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys keep me going on the podcast at work.

198
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:39,381
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to say that I found a new game for me.

199
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:44,483
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you guys are not very big on the PS3, but you need to give it time and a chance.

200
00:16:45,324 --> 00:16:49,186
[SPEAKER_11]: I was on the PSN store last night and saw that they had added some new games.

201
00:16:49,246 --> 00:16:51,507
[SPEAKER_11]: I had never heard of a game called Wild Arms before.

202
00:16:52,432 --> 00:16:56,814
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you guys slash ladies may have.

203
00:16:57,254 --> 00:16:59,815
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a good RPG for the PSP.

204
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:01,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it was a PlayStation game.

205
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:04,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Way better on PlayStation LOL anyway.

206
00:17:04,778 --> 00:17:07,499
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the show and keep it up.

207
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:08,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie, I love your input on the show.

208
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,740
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always good to get info from the ladies and not from just us geek guys.

209
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Gotta go back to work before the boss finds out I'm emailing you guys, LOLJK.

210
00:17:25,402 --> 00:17:25,982
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm telling.

211
00:17:26,342 --> 00:17:30,543
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually just sold my copy of Ratchet & Clank Tools of Destruction.

212
00:17:30,944 --> 00:17:36,925
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just... Not the full Ratchet & Clank, it's just I don't like the Ratchet & Clank series.

213
00:17:37,326 --> 00:17:44,908
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not... I mean, that game's probably pretty good, but the person I sold it to loves it a lot more than I do, so... I don't know.

214
00:17:44,948 --> 00:17:47,129
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of games, though, for the PS3...

215
00:17:48,573 --> 00:18:02,844
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, I was going to give Unreal Tournament 3 a chance, but for some reason, part of me thought that there was an actual good single player portion of that game, but it's Unreal Tournament and there's not, so I don't really want to buy it.

216
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:10,430
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, there will be more stuff that comes out later on, it's just right now, there's not a lot of great games for it.

217
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Not to say that there won't ever be.

218
00:18:13,689 --> 00:18:15,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Some interesting comments on chat on Wild Arms.

219
00:18:15,771 --> 00:18:17,312
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of polarizing the chat room.

220
00:18:17,332 --> 00:18:20,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Separat1215 said, Wild Arms was never a huge game.

221
00:18:20,414 --> 00:18:22,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not surprised if no one knows what it is.

222
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:25,898
[SPEAKER_04]: RossDLUT says, How the fuck has this guy never heard of Wild Arms?

223
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:29,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Jonathan F. says, Wild Arms is a killer RPG.

224
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Held up well against Final Fantasy VII, I think, in my opinion.

225
00:18:32,722 --> 00:18:34,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Wild Arms is just as it sounds.

226
00:18:34,224 --> 00:18:35,484
[SPEAKER_04]: A Wild West RPG.

227
00:18:35,825 --> 00:18:37,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Although it's not that at the same time.

228
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:41,709
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there you have some comments on Wild Arms from the chat.

229
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:43,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Any more emails?

230
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:45,057
[SPEAKER_11]: No, none at all.

231
00:18:45,137 --> 00:18:45,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's some.

232
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,238
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

233
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Next email.

234
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, folks at OLR.

235
00:18:49,581 --> 00:18:56,308
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just emailing to say that I was just about in tears at work from laughing so hard at Loki flipping out about one protesting for publicity.

236
00:18:57,129 --> 00:19:02,374
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad someone gets fired up about something and Loki offered up some radio gold.

237
00:19:02,904 --> 00:19:05,505
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys host a fantastic show, and I always look forward to listening.

238
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:15,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep putting out fantastic shows, and us fans will be extremely saddened with the loss of this show because it really kicks the crap out of those, quote, other big-name corporate podcasts with its real enthusiasm and passion.

239
00:19:17,132 --> 00:19:17,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Ego++, thank you.

240
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:22,074
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, this email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salads.

241
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:23,235
[SPEAKER_11]: It's J-Rod.

242
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, the Olive Garden is awesome.

243
00:19:25,596 --> 00:19:27,137
[SPEAKER_11]: The Olive Garden is awesome.

244
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:32,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Next, Dear OLR, I was thinking, would those Jot Guys act the same way...

245
00:19:32,992 --> 00:19:34,193
[SPEAKER_11]: If it said gay girl?

246
00:20:02,908 --> 00:20:03,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't get me started.

247
00:20:26,069 --> 00:20:27,290
[SPEAKER_04]: But good point brought up.

248
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see an experiment done.

249
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:35,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see the same person go back on to Halo 3 with the name gay girl or lesbian girl or something like that.

250
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:43,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you say gay girl and a lot of folks get the stereotypical, you know, butchy girl who likes girls in their mind.

251
00:20:43,737 --> 00:20:46,699
[SPEAKER_04]: But lesbians, you know, is a more exotic word.

252
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:53,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Lesbians is the, you know, lipstick wearing, you know, pillow fighting lesbians.

253
00:20:54,328 --> 00:20:54,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Porn star.

254
00:20:55,069 --> 00:20:59,031
[SPEAKER_04]: When I would tell you that most lesbians I know are in neither category.

255
00:20:59,632 --> 00:20:59,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

256
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:03,974
[SPEAKER_11]: So, continuing forward, shall I?

257
00:21:05,075 --> 00:21:05,535
[SPEAKER_12]: You shall.

258
00:21:06,256 --> 00:21:11,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Greetings, this is Kropotkin from the Kropotkin and Hendrix Game Review Show.

259
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I'm getting tongue-tied.

260
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:21,686
[SPEAKER_11]: While listening to your show last week, second part, I noticed that Loki casually dismissed Sensible Soccer as of little to no interest to anyone, and then Sky and Rice Princess began to laugh at its name.

261
00:21:21,886 --> 00:21:22,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, dear.

262
00:21:23,246 --> 00:21:30,868
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to count to ten before writing this email as one should never write an email in anger for yes, such a dismissive attitude filled me with both fury and despair.

263
00:21:31,509 --> 00:21:38,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Sensible World of Soccer, aka or Sensi, is part of the holy trinity of British video game titles that cannot be slighted.

264
00:21:39,051 --> 00:21:49,274
[SPEAKER_11]: It was an all-time classic footy game made by Sensible Software, hence the name, that built on Kickoff 2 title from back in 1989 on the Atari ST and Amiga.

265
00:21:49,926 --> 00:21:52,867
[SPEAKER_11]: To see it arrive on Xbox Live Arcade is nothing short of wondrous news.

266
00:21:53,227 --> 00:21:56,889
[SPEAKER_11]: To put it into perspective, try to imagine someone saying Super Mario 3 is a bit meh.

267
00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:02,471
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is what you did last week as far as your British listenership were concerned.

268
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:08,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and in case you're wondering what other two games are in the Trinity, they are Speedball 2, already on Xbox Live Arcade, and Paragroid.

269
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:12,398
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to know more about these three games, search on wiki.

270
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:14,479
[SPEAKER_11]: It has some great pages for all three games.

271
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:15,760
[SPEAKER_11]: I've actually heard of Paradroid.

272
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:20,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep up the good work and just be careful over games that originate from the British Isles in the future.

273
00:22:21,443 --> 00:22:25,025
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you might even start saying things like Lords of Midnight are a bit overrated.

274
00:22:25,165 --> 00:22:25,805
[SPEAKER_11]: Not a good idea.

275
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:37,831
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically what Kropotkin's trying to tell us is that Guardian Legend is to Orange Lounge Radio as Sensible World of Soccer is to all of the UK.

276
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that kind of what this email is to summarize?

277
00:22:41,382 --> 00:22:43,724
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the general... I see.

278
00:22:43,764 --> 00:22:46,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we are sorry for poking fun at your sacred game.

279
00:22:46,946 --> 00:22:48,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Or he was just saying Loki was wrong.

280
00:22:49,108 --> 00:22:50,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Which a lot of our emailers like to do.

281
00:22:50,629 --> 00:22:53,952
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, okay, no offense, but... I mean, uh-oh.

282
00:22:54,012 --> 00:22:58,956
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, even... Okay, I'll give you, you know, yeah, Super Mario Bros.

283
00:22:59,156 --> 00:23:00,657
[SPEAKER_14]: 3 may be not the shit.

284
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:03,279
[SPEAKER_14]: And to be honest, it was the shit at one time.

285
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,001
[SPEAKER_14]: But times have changed, okay?

286
00:23:06,021 --> 00:23:06,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

287
00:23:06,502 --> 00:23:11,426
[SPEAKER_14]: Sensible World Soccer may have been a great game at the time, and it still may be a great game now.

288
00:23:11,626 --> 00:23:12,547
[SPEAKER_14]: But you know what, though?

289
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:15,029
[SPEAKER_14]: I ain't gonna download it.

290
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:16,871
[SPEAKER_14]: You know why I'm not gonna download it?

291
00:23:16,951 --> 00:23:18,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's a soccer game, for one.

292
00:23:18,873 --> 00:23:22,636
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't play sports games, and I definitely don't play soccer games.

293
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:25,035
[SPEAKER_14]: and two, it's like an Amiga game.

294
00:23:25,295 --> 00:23:26,216
[SPEAKER_14]: So, no thanks.

295
00:23:26,236 --> 00:23:28,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll check out the demo and if I like it, I'll buy it.

296
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,177
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I do with most games.

297
00:23:29,858 --> 00:23:31,559
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be sensible about it.

298
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:38,262
[SPEAKER_14]: Back in the day, I used to play Blades of Steel and stuff like that, so I have tried games and stuff like that.

299
00:23:38,302 --> 00:23:39,083
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just not my thing.

300
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:41,804
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not saying that you're wrong for downloading it.

301
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,945
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not faulting you for doing that, but you know what?

302
00:23:44,106 --> 00:23:45,426
[SPEAKER_14]: I sure as hell am not downloading it.

303
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:48,268
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're wrong for being British, is what we're trying to say.

304
00:23:48,448 --> 00:23:49,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not British.

305
00:23:49,188 --> 00:23:49,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

306
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:50,449
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

307
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:51,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

308
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:51,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just teasing.

309
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:52,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

310
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:53,011
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

311
00:23:54,273 --> 00:23:57,335
[SPEAKER_11]: You remember, though, what I went crazy about finding at the store Friday night?

312
00:23:58,356 --> 00:24:02,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Super High Impact, which is the only American football game that I like, ever.

313
00:24:04,742 --> 00:24:07,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Tecmo Bowl on the Nintendo.

314
00:24:07,505 --> 00:24:08,626
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my favorite.

315
00:24:08,686 --> 00:24:10,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Super High Impact on Super Nintendo was my thing.

316
00:24:10,788 --> 00:24:14,512
[SPEAKER_11]: But I also played, what was it that was on Super Nintendo?

317
00:24:14,532 --> 00:24:15,553
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it Mario Striker?

318
00:24:16,153 --> 00:24:16,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't that it?

319
00:24:17,276 --> 00:24:18,557
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Mario Stalker's the new one, isn't it?

320
00:24:18,597 --> 00:24:19,497
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's the new one.

321
00:24:19,577 --> 00:24:21,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's probably like a new sequel or something.

322
00:24:21,238 --> 00:24:24,479
[SPEAKER_11]: It was an old one on Super Nintendo, another soccer game.

323
00:24:24,499 --> 00:24:25,540
[SPEAKER_11]: I used to play that all the time.

324
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh, the chat room's requesting my British accent.

325
00:24:29,021 --> 00:24:29,342
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

326
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:30,462
[SPEAKER_04]: You better go to next email.

327
00:24:30,622 --> 00:24:31,042
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

328
00:24:31,242 --> 00:24:31,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Next email.

329
00:24:32,363 --> 00:24:36,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I think I'll be logging on to Xbox Live this week and downloading some Sensible World of Soccer.

330
00:24:36,925 --> 00:24:37,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Sensible!

331
00:24:38,826 --> 00:24:39,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheerio!

332
00:24:39,326 --> 00:24:40,247
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm more Scottish.

333
00:24:41,127 --> 00:24:43,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, see, I'm not doing that shit, so I mean, come on.

334
00:24:43,988 --> 00:24:44,989
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're getting mad at me.

335
00:24:46,906 --> 00:24:47,226
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

336
00:24:47,246 --> 00:24:47,906
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but I'm cute.

337
00:24:48,727 --> 00:24:49,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh-huh.

338
00:24:49,627 --> 00:24:50,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

339
00:24:50,928 --> 00:24:51,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, OLR.

340
00:24:52,289 --> 00:24:55,190
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been listening to your show for over a year now, and I think it's the best.

341
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Aw.

342
00:24:56,951 --> 00:24:59,452
[SPEAKER_11]: My question is mainly for Loki, but others could chime in.

343
00:24:59,492 --> 00:25:00,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank you for your permission.

344
00:25:01,273 --> 00:25:04,975
[SPEAKER_11]: I bought a PSP Slim and need to know how to install custom firmwares.

345
00:25:05,855 --> 00:25:08,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Do I need Pandora's battery and how to?

346
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:15,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Your show is awesome, great, and with a PSP, I will hopefully be listening live more often.

347
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:15,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

348
00:25:16,644 --> 00:25:44,197
[SPEAKER_14]: Ryan Yeah, you do need Pandora's battery in order to install custom firmware on there and there's instructions online on how to do it and you actually have to create a different Pandora's battery than the one that they use for the fat PSPs but basically it involves you making the standard Pandora's battery then you patch the file with some other thing and then once you've done that you run the Pandora's battery on the system and then you can install custom firmwares

349
00:25:45,438 --> 00:25:47,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't ask me how to do it because I didn't know at the time.

350
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,383
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a very stupid walkthrough on how to do it.

351
00:25:51,923 --> 00:25:54,485
[SPEAKER_14]: And it took me about three times before I finally got it right.

352
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:58,569
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not easy, but it's not super difficult.

353
00:25:58,589 --> 00:26:00,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have to mod your PSP?

354
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,912
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Jesus, just play the games.

355
00:26:02,692 --> 00:26:03,873
[SPEAKER_14]: Me, I don't!

356
00:26:05,294 --> 00:26:06,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, I have to mod everything.

357
00:26:07,176 --> 00:26:08,017
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything!

358
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:11,519
[SPEAKER_14]: There's not anything that I don't break open.

359
00:26:13,101 --> 00:26:13,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Except for my DS.

360
00:26:13,801 --> 00:26:14,502
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't done that yet.

361
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,492
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm working on it right now, though.

362
00:26:16,812 --> 00:26:22,321
[SPEAKER_11]: We broke open my old Game Boy Advance to put an afterburner in it.

363
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,151
[SPEAKER_04]: That's different because it really needed that.

364
00:26:25,191 --> 00:26:27,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that really enhanced the damn Game Boy Advance.

365
00:26:27,433 --> 00:26:28,593
[SPEAKER_04]: My friend did that for me for my birthday.

366
00:26:28,613 --> 00:26:38,019
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just saying, you know, the PSP, yeah, I installed, when they were first out, I installed the stuff that let me play Kid Icarus on the PSP so I could go, hee, hee, hee, I have Kid Icarus everywhere.

367
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:39,060
[SPEAKER_04]: But now it's kind of old.

368
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,761
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I just, I don't care anymore.

369
00:26:40,781 --> 00:26:41,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care about modding anymore.

370
00:26:41,861 --> 00:26:44,203
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't hacked my iPhone, though, and I'm not going to.

371
00:26:44,223 --> 00:26:45,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Not my thing.

372
00:26:47,465 --> 00:26:48,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Next email.

373
00:26:48,285 --> 00:26:50,646
[SPEAKER_04]: DMN says, Loki modded his penis.

374
00:26:50,827 --> 00:26:51,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I checked.

375
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:53,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Game consoles, okay.

376
00:26:53,851 --> 00:26:54,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Next email says words.

377
00:27:06,423 --> 00:27:07,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Loki, DarkSakura, and Sky.

378
00:27:07,764 --> 00:27:11,708
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to thank you guys so much for helping me get through a really hard first semester at college.

379
00:27:12,148 --> 00:27:13,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking forward to the next podcast.

380
00:27:13,989 --> 00:27:17,733
[SPEAKER_11]: It kept me going and helped me look around for some fellow gamers that need play.

381
00:27:17,753 --> 00:27:25,199
[SPEAKER_11]: So I quickly found a whole bunch of Wii players, and I've been having fun with Mario Strikers since I'm one of those more social gamers, although I don't play online a lot.

382
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:29,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, keep up the good work, and once again, thanks for making this transition all that much more manageable.

383
00:27:31,272 --> 00:27:32,473
[SPEAKER_11]: All the best, Cliff R.

384
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:57,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Burst

385
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,381
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

386
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:40,402
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad that the price changes on live through 65 did not kill you.

387
00:28:40,902 --> 00:28:43,864
[SPEAKER_11]: This show has helped me get over two pages out of three.

388
00:28:44,445 --> 00:28:45,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job, guys.

389
00:28:45,165 --> 00:28:45,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep it up.

390
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:48,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Over 9,000 cups of coffee for the win, Dr. Burst.

391
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:50,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

392
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:53,272
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gotten four times better.

393
00:28:55,353 --> 00:29:01,378
[SPEAKER_04]: We must have been really bad before to be four times better now because I would say we're only about... We're like on the line right now.

394
00:29:02,138 --> 00:29:02,459
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

395
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:05,281
[SPEAKER_11]: I lied because there's... Well...

396
00:29:06,648 --> 00:29:13,914
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an article that Rob with 2B's linked to that I actually think is pretty cool.

397
00:29:14,114 --> 00:29:17,556
[SPEAKER_11]: It's from Endgadget, as soon as it loads.

398
00:29:17,657 --> 00:29:24,101
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's Sega protecting the Dreamcast trademark but not doing another console.

399
00:29:24,482 --> 00:29:26,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God, that whole debacle.

400
00:29:26,063 --> 00:29:26,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot about that.

401
00:29:27,944 --> 00:29:28,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if it'll ever load.

402
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:45,704
[SPEAKER_11]: But basically, Sega is saying that they are going to keep that trademark so that they can, I guess, protect their rights in the Dreamcast name, but they're not going to be doing any...

403
00:29:46,573 --> 00:29:52,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know how the hell someone jumped to that conclusion that they're doing a Dreamcast 2 from them renewing the trademarks.

404
00:29:52,481 --> 00:29:54,844
[SPEAKER_04]: How did that rumor even start?

405
00:29:55,204 --> 00:29:56,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that kind of seems stupid to me.

406
00:29:57,467 --> 00:30:00,952
[SPEAKER_11]: They're quoted as saying they have no plans to get back into the console business.

407
00:30:00,972 --> 00:30:02,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is no surprise.

408
00:30:02,054 --> 00:30:03,796
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first read that rumor, I'm like, yeah, right.

409
00:30:04,488 --> 00:30:08,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right, they're going to put out a Dreamcast 2 right now when the market is crowded.

410
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't see Sega getting back into consoles anytime soon.

411
00:30:11,132 --> 00:30:18,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, let's face it, sorry Sega fans, but the last few offerings from Sega have not been all that, even in the console market.

412
00:30:19,096 --> 00:30:21,197
[SPEAKER_04]: So they've got a lot of catching up to do, you know what I mean?

413
00:30:21,637 --> 00:30:23,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Before they start thinking about a console again.

414
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:25,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, we've got one last email.

415
00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:26,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I was blinking.

416
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:27,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

417
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:28,921
[SPEAKER_11]: It says boobies!

418
00:30:30,407 --> 00:30:30,947
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not joking.

419
00:30:30,967 --> 00:30:32,187
[SPEAKER_11]: The first word in it is boobies.

420
00:30:32,308 --> 00:30:33,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that from DMN?

421
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:33,448
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

422
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:34,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

423
00:30:34,048 --> 00:30:34,608
[SPEAKER_11]: From the doctor.

424
00:30:34,888 --> 00:30:35,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

425
00:30:36,189 --> 00:30:36,989
[SPEAKER_11]: LOL.

426
00:30:37,209 --> 00:30:39,429
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm thinking a lot of LOLs in my emails.

427
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,010
[SPEAKER_04]: What is up with that?

428
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,870
[SPEAKER_11]: I love you guys.

429
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:44,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, I'm going to try and buy some 360 before Christmas.

430
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:47,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for the idea, Sky and Loki, the doctor.

431
00:30:48,592 --> 00:30:53,333
[SPEAKER_11]: Send me a TARDIS so I can, you know, go elsewhere and else when.

432
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:57,234
[SPEAKER_04]: And now here, Rostio UT actually has a really good idea here.

433
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:59,655
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, I can imagine, for once, ha ha ha,

434
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:01,246
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just kidding.

435
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:06,147
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, I can imagine they'll just repackage a flashback-type console for Dreamcast games.

436
00:31:06,587 --> 00:31:08,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I could see happening.

437
00:31:08,787 --> 00:31:11,928
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a sensible world of Dreamcast to me.

438
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:15,569
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, it was Mega Man Soccer I was trying to think of.

439
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:19,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, what else?

440
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:21,690
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm getting lulled today in boobies.

441
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody else had a sensible joke.

442
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:23,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

443
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:29,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft said when we go to the college campuses, it could be OLR, the Sensible World of Podcasting Tour.

444
00:31:32,114 --> 00:31:34,795
[SPEAKER_11]: We should have that contest.

445
00:31:34,975 --> 00:31:35,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Pay for us to come see you.

446
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:38,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that idea.

447
00:31:38,235 --> 00:31:39,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Pay for our vacation.

448
00:31:39,596 --> 00:31:42,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's our new contest.

449
00:31:43,496 --> 00:31:45,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Pay for ORR to come to your town.

450
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:50,378
[SPEAKER_15]: And they can make fun of your town and then maybe show some people how to do podcasts.

451
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:52,998
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll record our podcast in your town if you pay.

452
00:31:54,378 --> 00:31:56,199
[SPEAKER_04]: But not at your house because that would be creepy.

453
00:31:59,383 --> 00:32:00,664
[SPEAKER_15]: And you might not have good internet either.

454
00:32:00,724 --> 00:32:01,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

455
00:32:01,384 --> 00:32:06,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, my God, the show's breaking our internet at this house, and we kind of tried to prep for it.

456
00:32:07,007 --> 00:32:08,108
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, end of mailbag.

457
00:32:08,148 --> 00:32:10,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to some more stuff.

458
00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:13,411
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to send in an email, give us some ego++.

459
00:32:13,451 --> 00:32:14,051
[SPEAKER_04]: We always love that.

460
00:32:14,091 --> 00:32:15,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at orangeongeradio.com.

461
00:32:15,732 --> 00:32:17,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Or some ego-minus-minus.

462
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Jamie skipped some of the ego-minus-minus this week.

463
00:32:21,216 --> 00:32:22,136
[SPEAKER_11]: I skipped a...

464
00:32:24,446 --> 00:32:28,748
[SPEAKER_11]: reminder of manners addressed to one of our three that isn't you or me.

465
00:32:31,048 --> 00:32:33,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking forward to that email because it was kind of funny.

466
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:34,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want me to read it?

467
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, read it because it's funny.

468
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,291
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see why in a minute.

469
00:32:37,611 --> 00:32:38,971
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to open the email box again.

470
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:39,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on.

471
00:32:39,271 --> 00:32:39,572
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

472
00:32:40,572 --> 00:32:46,154
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to give her a minute because there's an email that's criticizing Loki that I actually found kind of funny and I want her to read it.

473
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,711
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's funny because it's true.

474
00:32:48,771 --> 00:32:49,831
[SPEAKER_04]: It is so fucking true.

475
00:32:50,091 --> 00:32:53,293
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been listening all night long tonight and it is completely true.

476
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:56,854
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's why I want to... I know Loki's like, what the fuck did I do now?

477
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:57,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, here we go.

478
00:32:57,654 --> 00:32:58,615
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to go in the old mail.

479
00:32:58,755 --> 00:33:00,515
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

480
00:33:00,535 --> 00:33:03,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, we'll get some email loading music here.

481
00:33:03,116 --> 00:33:05,377
[SPEAKER_14]: All criticisms of me are true, so whatever.

482
00:33:05,397 --> 00:33:11,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, when you start playing the music now, the email starts to load, so...

483
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:15,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Old mail.

484
00:33:15,615 --> 00:33:19,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be critical of Loki for another week.

485
00:33:20,317 --> 00:33:21,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait to see.

486
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:23,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, because Op 11's running.

487
00:33:23,939 --> 00:33:25,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn you, Op 11!

488
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Op 11's going to shut off.

489
00:33:28,201 --> 00:33:30,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, Loki's like, oh, take your time.

490
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:30,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

491
00:33:31,362 --> 00:33:31,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hooray.

492
00:33:32,743 --> 00:33:34,524
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is from Mario.

493
00:33:36,073 --> 00:33:39,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh shit, you know that Mario's calling you out now.

494
00:33:39,615 --> 00:33:43,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, there are other people in the world named Mario other than the video game character.

495
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:47,740
[SPEAKER_11]: I will not say last names on the air.

496
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:55,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, I find that you are very rude to your co-hosts and audience when you cut them off with your standard introduction, anyways.

497
00:33:57,045 --> 00:34:00,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Saying anyways after someone states that whatever is said is not important.

498
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:04,832
[SPEAKER_11]: What everyone says is important, even your thoughts and comments.

499
00:34:05,132 --> 00:34:08,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Learn to stop saying anyways after anyone's statements except your own statements.

500
00:34:09,934 --> 00:34:10,975
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, I don't really care.

501
00:34:14,496 --> 00:34:15,816
[SPEAKER_14]: It is true, though.

502
00:34:15,836 --> 00:34:19,558
[SPEAKER_14]: No, he just... There's people that interrupt me all the fucking time.

503
00:34:19,578 --> 00:34:22,499
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll hear me going, hey, hey, I'm not done talking yet.

504
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:23,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, listen.

505
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, listen.

506
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, listen.

507
00:34:28,749 --> 00:34:28,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey!

508
00:34:29,009 --> 00:34:29,609
[SPEAKER_09]: It's over!

509
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:31,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say anyways.

510
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:31,771
[SPEAKER_04]: It's over!

511
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:32,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, please.

512
00:34:32,711 --> 00:34:33,231
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's just funny.

513
00:34:33,532 --> 00:34:39,175
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's just, you know, we're just poking fun at you because I don't think you really mean it to be rude, but it's been kind of your transition word.

514
00:34:39,515 --> 00:34:42,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, we've been working on our transition, you know, going from one story to another.

515
00:34:42,676 --> 00:34:45,958
[SPEAKER_04]: We try to be smooth, like, you know, oh, we're going to go from one wee story to another wee story.

516
00:34:46,278 --> 00:34:50,040
[SPEAKER_04]: When Loki's ready to go on a story, it's like, okay, anyways, we got this game coming out.

517
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, Rob, your light's just seizured.

518
00:34:52,862 --> 00:34:53,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they?

519
00:34:53,846 --> 00:34:57,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they're just sitting here and we're on and all of a sudden BLINK!

520
00:34:57,627 --> 00:35:00,248
[SPEAKER_14]: It's because he has them on that one where they cycle.

521
00:35:00,728 --> 00:35:02,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're on the cycle one where it goes through anything.

522
00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:04,289
[SPEAKER_04]: They cycle, you know, with the baby on.

523
00:35:04,449 --> 00:35:06,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I just happened to look over there when they were on.

524
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyways, can we get back into the gaming news now?

525
00:35:08,851 --> 00:35:10,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Definitely we can get back into the gaming news.

526
00:35:11,171 --> 00:35:12,192
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll stop shopping.

527
00:35:15,353 --> 00:35:18,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get a little bell and every time Loki says anyways I go BING!

528
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Weren't you going to get a bell for something else?

529
00:35:20,794 --> 00:35:22,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, there was something else I was going to get a bell for and I never did.

530
00:35:23,447 --> 00:35:24,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh well, because I'm lazy.

531
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:30,289
[SPEAKER_14]: So Rock Band ain't coming out in Canada until the 28th.

532
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Sucks for you guys, but guess what?

533
00:35:34,851 --> 00:35:41,133
[SPEAKER_14]: The problem is they don't have enough guitars and instruments and stuff to go around and it doesn't help that their first batch of them also sucked.

534
00:35:41,694 --> 00:35:47,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're having to send all the Canadian guitars out as replacements for all the broken American ones and you know it's true.

535
00:35:48,216 --> 00:35:48,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.

536
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:51,277
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah.

537
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,451
[SPEAKER_14]: No Rock Band for you.

538
00:36:21,815 --> 00:36:28,538
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess apparently this was going to be a UMD project, like an actual full game, and there was actually going to be licensed music and videos.

539
00:36:28,878 --> 00:36:32,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently the Sugar Babes, which is a British band, was going to be involved.

540
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:36,080
[SPEAKER_04]: But they decided to scrap that idea, thank God.

541
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,083
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they did instead is that now for this $5 game, it'll actually run off the MP3s that's on your PSP.

542
00:36:42,603 --> 00:36:45,624
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very similar to that iPod game that just came out, Phase.

543
00:36:46,644 --> 00:36:47,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it doesn't look the same.

544
00:36:48,085 --> 00:36:48,545
[SPEAKER_04]: To me...

545
00:36:49,443 --> 00:36:55,685
[SPEAKER_04]: The game itself looks like one of those cutscenes, or not cutscenes, but one of the parts of Guitar Room Man.

546
00:36:55,745 --> 00:36:59,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the part where you're moving the analog stick around, but the part where all the notes are coming in towards the center.

547
00:36:59,946 --> 00:37:02,626
[SPEAKER_11]: When you are doing the attacks.

548
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:03,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

549
00:37:03,586 --> 00:37:06,087
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what this looks like to me.

550
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:07,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, you're right.

551
00:37:08,288 --> 00:37:12,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you can't get that on the PlayStation 3 store for whatever reason.

552
00:37:12,229 --> 00:37:15,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe soon, but right now you can only get it on the PC store.

553
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:15,809
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

554
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,190
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks very plain.

555
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:26,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I guess Tigerclaw actually linked a YouTube video of our buddy Bobby playing beats.

556
00:37:26,464 --> 00:37:31,028
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm curious about this, and since the Op 11's done, we should actually have bandwidth now.

557
00:37:31,128 --> 00:37:31,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to look at this.

558
00:37:32,729 --> 00:37:33,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

559
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there's a little watermark.

560
00:37:35,891 --> 00:37:36,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here we go.

561
00:37:37,412 --> 00:37:38,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take a look at this.

562
00:37:40,575 --> 00:37:41,535
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks kind of cute.

563
00:37:41,595 --> 00:37:41,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

564
00:37:42,156 --> 00:37:43,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into actual gameplay.

565
00:37:44,377 --> 00:37:45,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he's playing to his own show.

566
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:46,139
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cute.

567
00:37:50,595 --> 00:37:51,456
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something else.

568
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:54,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, the game itself doesn't look that exciting, though.

569
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, there you have it.

570
00:37:59,721 --> 00:38:00,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice job, Bobby.

571
00:38:01,082 --> 00:38:02,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Good promotional piece, I gotta say.

572
00:38:02,783 --> 00:38:03,324
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good one.

573
00:38:04,384 --> 00:38:05,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, that's it.

574
00:38:05,405 --> 00:38:06,186
[SPEAKER_04]: PSP Beats.

575
00:38:06,446 --> 00:38:09,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Not something I think I'm gonna run and grab my PSP for.

576
00:38:09,448 --> 00:38:11,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it doesn't look that exciting to me.

577
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:12,810
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

578
00:38:13,651 --> 00:38:14,511
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not gonna download it.

579
00:38:15,652 --> 00:38:18,094
[SPEAKER_11]: However, this is something I do want.

580
00:38:18,686 --> 00:38:20,547
[SPEAKER_11]: And by do want, I mean do want.

581
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:23,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Finally.

582
00:38:23,888 --> 00:38:25,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Luminous is now available on the PC.

583
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:27,370
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

584
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,531
[SPEAKER_04]: My God, what else are they going to put this thing on?

585
00:38:30,571 --> 00:38:31,231
[SPEAKER_04]: The N-Gage?

586
00:38:32,231 --> 00:38:33,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it already there?

587
00:38:33,992 --> 00:38:38,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the PC is like the last platform I think this game is coming out on.

588
00:38:39,815 --> 00:38:42,095
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got a skin editing mode.

589
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:42,716
[SPEAKER_11]: You have...

590
00:38:44,415 --> 00:39:01,979
[SPEAKER_11]: Online score ranking, it's going to be $19.99, and there is a pay-per-play on a... You can pay-per-play, or you can use a free version that has ads all over it.

591
00:39:02,819 --> 00:39:03,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it have Shinen?

592
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:04,720
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I really care about.

593
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,680
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, but I'll get it.

594
00:39:08,885 --> 00:39:11,887
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, you let me know, and then I'll download it if it has Shinin' in it.

595
00:39:12,007 --> 00:39:12,968
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going on there right now.

596
00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:14,289
[SPEAKER_14]: Shinin'.

597
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,291
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways.

598
00:39:20,814 --> 00:39:22,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I didn't care what you were talking about.

599
00:39:23,636 --> 00:39:28,480
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it has Shinin' on it, because I'm not going to play the game unless it has Shinin'.

600
00:39:31,222 --> 00:39:33,023
[SPEAKER_14]: Sad you're home with Bell, so fuck off.

601
00:39:33,844 --> 00:39:33,944
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

602
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:36,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Axiom Overdrive

603
00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:08,938
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's going to be heading, I know, to live arcade here pretty soon.

604
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:20,805
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the nominees here, they've got best web browser game, including Iron Dukes, Globus.com, and Triacnid.

605
00:40:22,926 --> 00:40:26,708
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the games I've liked that I played here, Excellence in Visual Art, Clean Asia.

606
00:40:27,028 --> 00:40:31,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I said, it's a good shoot-em-up game if you like Warning Forever.

607
00:40:32,652 --> 00:40:36,634
[SPEAKER_14]: There's also another one that you might like if you like Warning Forever, which is called Battleships Forever.

608
00:40:36,654 --> 00:40:39,356
[SPEAKER_14]: It was inspired by that game, and it's another shoot-em-up game.

609
00:40:40,076 --> 00:40:41,337
[SPEAKER_14]: So definitely worth checking out.

610
00:40:41,477 --> 00:40:47,740
[SPEAKER_14]: And also, if you want something to waste some time on, also check out Crayon Physics Deluxe.

611
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:51,342
[SPEAKER_14]: They have Crayon Physics, which you can play for free as well.

612
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,904
[SPEAKER_14]: Fret Nice, also fun if you've got a Guitar Hero controller.

613
00:40:56,044 --> 00:40:57,485
[SPEAKER_14]: Highly recommend that game as well.

614
00:40:57,952 --> 00:40:59,053
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyways, just check it out.

615
00:40:59,193 --> 00:41:04,857
[SPEAKER_14]: It's at www.igf.com slash 02finalist.html

616
00:41:05,876 --> 00:41:11,358
[SPEAKER_14]: and there's a bunch of links to free games and also go to all those sites you'll notice that there's also more free games on there as well.

617
00:41:11,658 --> 00:41:29,384
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I'm glad we really did that story tonight because I think sometimes we don't give independent games enough loving on this show and for you know as much as we say rah rah rah support independent podcasting we should be talking more and more about independent games so we definitely should all take an effort to kind of check out some of these winners and talk about them on the show.

618
00:41:29,424 --> 00:41:33,225
[SPEAKER_14]: Definitely and if you're also interested there's links this is the 2008

619
00:41:35,612 --> 00:41:36,553
[SPEAKER_14]: GameTapIndia Awards

620
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:06,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Roboblitz and Everyday Shooter won that as well.

621
00:42:06,988 --> 00:42:16,484
[SPEAKER_14]: So a lot of these games, play them now because you'll probably see them on an online service like the PlayStation Network or Xbox Live Arcade soon.

622
00:42:18,456 --> 00:42:46,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well something you might be seeing making a comeback soon are the franchises MechWarrior, Shadowrun, and Crimson Skies because Jordan Weissman has this new startup company Smith & Tinker and he basically has licensed back the electronic entertainment rights to those franchises back from Microsoft and basically these franchises were originally developed by FASA and then Microsoft had it in 1999 and they recently dissolved

623
00:42:48,326 --> 00:42:49,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that.

624
00:42:49,107 --> 00:42:52,910
[SPEAKER_04]: So, no really plans to further these franchises.

625
00:42:54,031 --> 00:42:58,414
[SPEAKER_04]: By Microsoft, which is probably good news, because Shadowrun really didn't get a lot of love.

626
00:42:58,975 --> 00:43:02,938
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, you know, kind of seemed like these series were kind of done for.

627
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:05,260
[SPEAKER_04]: But they are a lot of fans, especially Shadowrun.

628
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,262
[SPEAKER_04]: You look at that, you know, especially the old school versions of Shadowrun.

629
00:43:08,682 --> 00:43:14,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of people love those games and are very excited at this news because, you know, maybe this is a sign that...

630
00:43:15,731 --> 00:43:19,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to play Shadowrun Tabletop, like the original Shadowrun, which was RPG, actual.

631
00:43:44,994 --> 00:43:45,815
[SPEAKER_11]: D&D Style Gaming

632
00:44:16,162 --> 00:44:21,086
[SPEAKER_11]: This is actually put out by, I think, let me see.

633
00:44:21,647 --> 00:44:23,028
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to find the list that put it out.

634
00:44:23,288 --> 00:44:26,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Next Gen, 2007's Japan's Top 20 Games.

635
00:44:27,171 --> 00:44:28,492
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're not talking sales-wise, though.

636
00:44:28,512 --> 00:44:34,157
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking like, it's December, here comes everybody's Top 10 list, you know, and all that stuff, right?

637
00:44:34,417 --> 00:44:36,779
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I've got a Top 20, so I'm just going to sort of skim through it.

638
00:44:36,859 --> 00:44:37,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

639
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,843
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, on number 20, DS Literature Companion, which was on the DS.

640
00:44:43,405 --> 00:44:43,545
[SPEAKER_11]: And...

641
00:44:47,023 --> 00:44:53,809
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see how that would be interesting, but they were doing these cartridges for different classic Japanese novels.

642
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:56,612
[SPEAKER_11]: So that you know more about it.

643
00:44:56,932 --> 00:44:58,333
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess like Cliff Notes or something?

644
00:44:59,975 --> 00:45:00,495
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

645
00:45:00,515 --> 00:45:05,960
[SPEAKER_11]: 19 was Bladestorm for PS3 and Xbox 360 put out by Koei.

646
00:45:06,921 --> 00:45:10,644
[SPEAKER_11]: More Dynasty Warriors-ish game.

647
00:45:10,664 --> 00:45:13,867
[SPEAKER_11]: 18 was Vision Training Flash Focus on Nintendo DS.

648
00:45:14,468 --> 00:45:30,492
[SPEAKER_11]: Wild Arms XF on PSP number 17, number 16, Game Center CX on Nintendo DS, which is by Bandai Namco, which is, it's actually based off of a TV show.

649
00:45:32,932 --> 00:45:34,713
[SPEAKER_11]: And let's see, moving forward.

650
00:45:36,773 --> 00:45:41,034
[SPEAKER_11]: On number 15 is Trustee Bell, which was Eternal Sonata.

651
00:45:42,795 --> 00:45:43,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that game a lot.

652
00:45:43,835 --> 00:45:44,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Mm-hmm.

653
00:45:45,403 --> 00:45:51,427
[SPEAKER_11]: 14 is face training to where you use the DS camera to mimic a face.

654
00:45:53,729 --> 00:45:54,730
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds stupid.

655
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:55,550
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

656
00:45:55,951 --> 00:45:57,792
[SPEAKER_11]: It's sort of like how to smile a certain way.

657
00:45:57,832 --> 00:45:59,033
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the top games of the year.

658
00:46:00,554 --> 00:46:03,216
[SPEAKER_11]: 13 was Ace Combat 6, which I don't see why because it's kind of boring.

659
00:46:03,236 --> 00:46:12,283
[SPEAKER_11]: 12 was Tsuburashiki Kono Sekai It's a Wonderful World on Nintendo DS.

660
00:46:12,443 --> 00:46:14,045
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the one by Square Enix.

661
00:46:14,747 --> 00:46:15,747
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty awesome looking.

662
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:20,209
[SPEAKER_11]: I like how the article says the battle system plays something like DDR for kids with ADHD.

663
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:23,430
[SPEAKER_11]: That's interesting.

664
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:29,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Eleven, Treasure Island Z, The Adventures of Zack and Wiki on Wii by Capcom.

665
00:46:32,093 --> 00:46:33,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving forward.

666
00:46:34,614 --> 00:46:35,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on.

667
00:46:35,535 --> 00:46:35,935
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.

668
00:46:36,775 --> 00:46:40,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Ten, Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII on PSP.

669
00:46:40,677 --> 00:46:41,717

00:46:42,764 --> 00:46:44,486

673
00:46:51,052 --> 00:46:54,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Another one of those mecha fighting weird strategy RPG things.

674
00:46:56,517 --> 00:46:54,856
7.

675
00:46:57,058 --> 00:47:05,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Yushin no Kusei ni Namaikita on PSP, which is put out by Acquire.

676
00:47:06,847 --> 00:47:08,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Acquire gave us Tenchu, by the way.

677
00:47:10,241 --> 00:47:15,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Six, No More Heroes, which we were just going over during our break.

678
00:47:17,783 --> 00:47:19,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Very interesting looking little game.

679
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:23,184
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the last few, the top five.

680
00:47:23,844 --> 00:47:26,865
[SPEAKER_11]: Number five is Lost Odyssey, Xbox 360.

681
00:47:29,226 --> 00:47:31,846
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been hearing some not so great things about Lost Odyssey.

682
00:47:31,886 --> 00:47:33,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very curious to check it out when it comes out here.

683
00:47:36,047 --> 00:47:37,408
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of of two minds about it.

684
00:47:37,448 --> 00:47:38,188
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm thinking about it.

685
00:47:39,312 --> 00:47:54,562
[SPEAKER_11]: 4 is Super Mario Galaxy, 3 is Wii Fit, 2 is Professor Layton and the Curious Village on Nintendo DS, put up by level 5, and number 1 is Pac-Man Championship Edition on Xbox Live Arcade.

686
00:47:55,603 --> 00:47:56,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

687
00:47:57,684 --> 00:47:58,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting choices.

688
00:47:58,585 --> 00:48:00,907
[SPEAKER_11]: We've actually, that game gets a lot of play in my house.

689
00:48:01,207 --> 00:48:01,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

690
00:48:02,585 --> 00:48:03,967
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually curious about this.

691
00:48:04,167 --> 00:48:06,288
[SPEAKER_04]: We were posted a link in chat from Rosteel UT.

692
00:48:06,328 --> 00:48:09,031
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a commercial for face training straight out of Japan.

693
00:48:09,111 --> 00:48:10,292
[SPEAKER_04]: So this ought to be a hoot.

694
00:48:11,713 --> 00:48:11,893
[SPEAKER_00]: DSで顔のトレーニング 口角と頬を引き上げます 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 両方の眉を引き上げます

695
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,636
[SPEAKER_04]: My god, it looks like it's like, like, it's creepy.

696
00:48:42,696 --> 00:48:49,421
[SPEAKER_04]: That commercial's creepy because it makes it seem like, you know, we will be absorbing your brain in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

697
00:48:52,907 --> 00:48:57,110
[SPEAKER_11]: It's strange to teach everybody to smile and make expressions the same way.

698
00:48:57,330 --> 00:49:01,093
[SPEAKER_14]: Are they trying to imply that the Japanese people do not have emotion?

699
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:03,514
[SPEAKER_14]: That's racist.

700
00:49:04,195 --> 00:49:08,738
[SPEAKER_14]: That they need to look like everybody else.

701
00:49:09,018 --> 00:49:13,641
[SPEAKER_14]: It's basically a trainer for pod people so that we can't see who they are.

702
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,062
[SPEAKER_14]: That's really what it is.

703
00:49:15,122 --> 00:49:16,563
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a strange looking game.

704
00:49:16,603 --> 00:49:16,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

705
00:49:19,369 --> 00:49:20,390
[SPEAKER_14]: CompUSA Liquidation Sales

706
00:49:44,702 --> 00:49:48,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Make your way down to your local CompUSA for some sweet deals on old games, I'm sure.

707
00:49:49,064 --> 00:49:52,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Except for the fact I looked, and there's no more CompUSAs in Sacramento.

708
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:53,665
[SPEAKER_04]: They got rid of all of them.

709
00:49:54,306 --> 00:49:55,926
[SPEAKER_04]: The closest ones are in the Bay Area.

710
00:49:57,447 --> 00:49:59,668
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not driving all the way over there just for some cheap games.

711
00:50:02,169 --> 00:50:03,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, CompUSA.

712
00:50:03,269 --> 00:50:04,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice knowing you when you were still around.

713
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:11,012
[SPEAKER_14]: We bought one of our computers from CompUSA one time, like way back in the day, with its whopping one meg of RAM.

714
00:50:13,171 --> 00:50:13,792
[SPEAKER_04]: www.darksakura.com

00:50:20,697 --> 00:50:22,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Phil Burned a Lot of Bridges with Gamers

716
00:50:47,243 --> 00:50:50,504
[SPEAKER_04]: She was really into there, and I want to say for a time worked for the company.

717
00:50:50,544 --> 00:50:51,464
[SPEAKER_04]: She may still even be there.

718
00:50:51,564 --> 00:50:51,904
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

719
00:50:52,444 --> 00:50:53,704
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we haven't heard from her in a while.

720
00:50:53,724 --> 00:50:55,224
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe she needs to go on the Dr. Phil show.

721
00:50:55,404 --> 00:50:57,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

722
00:50:57,885 --> 00:51:02,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, apparently this girl, this 13-year-old girl, Lexi, she spends all her time on there.

723
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:08,587
[SPEAKER_04]: She had a boyfriend in there, and they would make out on their bed and everything.

724
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:12,287
[SPEAKER_04]: She had real feelings for this guy, I think.

725
00:51:13,388 --> 00:51:15,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, I saw the show.

726
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:17,994
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

727
00:51:18,715 --> 00:51:20,036
[SPEAKER_14]: You watch the Dr. Phil show?

728
00:51:20,076 --> 00:51:22,137
[SPEAKER_14]: My wife watches the Dr. Phil show.

729
00:51:22,157 --> 00:51:23,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and it just happened to be there.

730
00:51:23,718 --> 00:51:25,980
[SPEAKER_04]: You couldn't, like, you know, go to the other room or anything?

731
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:34,886
[SPEAKER_14]: I had already been in the other room the entire day, so, you know, I have to come out sometime and spend quality time with my wife and also eat dinner.

732
00:51:35,151 --> 00:51:38,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then, did you have fun watching the Dr. Phil show?

733
00:51:38,836 --> 00:51:40,598
[SPEAKER_14]: No, because we always make fun of Dr. Phil.

734
00:51:40,618 --> 00:51:42,240
[SPEAKER_01]: We always mock him.

735
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,243
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Dr. Phil, okay?

736
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:47,707
[SPEAKER_14]: He's a lot like Mr. Mackey.

737
00:51:47,727 --> 00:51:51,512
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, yeah, I'm Dr. Phil, and you should stop doing that.

738
00:51:52,034 --> 00:52:00,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what's interesting is what Dr. Phil, and you may think that he's going to say something kind of narrow-minded and stupid, but he actually ends up having some pretty decent advice.

739
00:52:01,279 --> 00:52:06,921
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, quote, because he actually had the CEO from there come on the show and kind of defend.

740
00:52:06,941 --> 00:52:08,362
[SPEAKER_04]: So he got all ends of it.

741
00:52:08,642 --> 00:52:11,284
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, quote, the problem is not with the game.

742
00:52:11,364 --> 00:52:13,044
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is the use of it.

743
00:52:13,405 --> 00:52:16,906
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is very creative, and it's there for you to use or abuse.

744
00:52:17,387 --> 00:52:18,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you abusing it?

745
00:52:19,454 --> 00:52:20,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and she said yes.

746
00:52:20,715 --> 00:52:22,076
[SPEAKER_14]: She's like, yes, I am abusing it.

747
00:52:22,116 --> 00:52:23,957
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's like, oh, okay, that was easy.

748
00:52:24,217 --> 00:52:24,818
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the thing.

749
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:28,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Mom limited play to four hours a day.

750
00:52:30,161 --> 00:52:32,423
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Dr. Phil says, four hours a day?

751
00:52:32,503 --> 00:52:33,223
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ridiculous.

752
00:52:33,644 --> 00:52:36,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Mom, you've got to step up and shut this down, okay?

753
00:52:36,766 --> 00:52:43,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Once she's at a point where she can play the game instead of being absorbed in the game, okay, then perhaps she can attempt to get back to it.

754
00:52:44,471 --> 00:52:46,212
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the official advice from Dr. Phil.

755
00:52:46,272 --> 00:52:47,573
[SPEAKER_04]: So it actually seems like...

756
00:52:48,311 --> 00:52:58,139
[SPEAKER_04]: That was good at telling the parent that the parent needs to pull the plug on the game and get the kid to do something else and stop passively accepting it.

757
00:52:58,199 --> 00:53:00,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the parent is the one paying the credit.

758
00:53:00,641 --> 00:53:07,026
[SPEAKER_14]: This has a monthly subscription fee, I believe, where you can buy money in this game using your credit card.

759
00:53:07,066 --> 00:53:12,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the kid does not have a credit card, so stop giving her money, you moron.

760
00:53:14,102 --> 00:53:21,487
[SPEAKER_15]: Wasn't this also the episode of Dr. Phil that the lawyer of no name was claiming that he was supposed to be invited to and never went through with it?

761
00:53:23,248 --> 00:53:24,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Eh, who cares about that guy?

762
00:53:24,408 --> 00:53:25,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's gonna be disbarred at the end of the day.

763
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:26,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so over him.

764
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:28,051
[SPEAKER_03]: So over him.

765
00:53:29,111 --> 00:53:29,852
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, he's gonna be gone.

766
00:53:30,232 --> 00:53:30,552
[SPEAKER_15]: Yay.

767
00:53:31,753 --> 00:53:37,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there is a new games rating system.

768
00:53:38,557 --> 00:53:41,699
[SPEAKER_11]: A campaign to be launched for renting the games.

769
00:53:41,779 --> 00:53:42,740
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a group...

770
00:53:43,302 --> 00:53:57,726
[SPEAKER_11]: A couple of the Delaware political folks are hanging out with the ESRB and trying to bring out new public service announcements that these new ratings are supposed to be adhered to or whatever.

771
00:53:59,327 --> 00:53:59,787
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

772
00:54:02,588 --> 00:54:03,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Can't they look at the box?

773
00:54:04,315 --> 00:54:06,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Parents don't know the rating system, I swear.

774
00:54:07,016 --> 00:54:13,840
[SPEAKER_04]: True story, last night I'm at Walmart and I'm looking at the Wii games because I kind of still want to get Trauma Centers.

775
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I was kind of looking at how much they're charging for it because I was there to get some other stuff.

776
00:54:17,162 --> 00:54:22,585
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's this parent and the kid is playing Xbox 360, the little demo kiosk, right?

777
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:24,646
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's going, I want this game, I want this game.

778
00:54:24,706 --> 00:54:26,067
[SPEAKER_04]: And she goes, well, what's it rated?

779
00:54:26,707 --> 00:54:27,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good question.

780
00:54:27,768 --> 00:54:28,568
[SPEAKER_04]: She says, what's it rated?

781
00:54:28,888 --> 00:54:30,049
[SPEAKER_04]: And the kid goes, RP.

782
00:54:30,549 --> 00:54:32,070
[SPEAKER_04]: And the mom's all, what's that mean?

783
00:54:33,523 --> 00:54:34,364
[SPEAKER_04]: What does RP mean?

784
00:54:34,424 --> 00:54:34,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

785
00:54:34,964 --> 00:54:37,125
[SPEAKER_11]: RP is not even on the list.

786
00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:38,386
[SPEAKER_04]: It's rating pending.

787
00:54:38,726 --> 00:54:38,806
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

788
00:54:38,986 --> 00:54:39,747
[SPEAKER_14]: RP is rating pending.

789
00:54:39,767 --> 00:54:41,307
[SPEAKER_04]: They do have it on the ESRB poster.

790
00:54:42,208 --> 00:54:44,389
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, that's what will fill the wall.

791
00:54:44,429 --> 00:54:46,030
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got some ESRB rating posters.

792
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:47,731
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a good thing to fill the wall with.

793
00:54:47,831 --> 00:54:49,132
[SPEAKER_04]: So if any parents watch our show, remind them.

794
00:54:49,152 --> 00:54:50,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I have like hundreds of them.

795
00:54:50,352 --> 00:54:57,336
[SPEAKER_04]: And me being the nosy fucker I am, I jumped in there and I said, I was like, it means rating pending.

796
00:54:57,376 --> 00:54:59,097
[SPEAKER_04]: It means like, it's like a movie that hasn't been rated.

797
00:54:59,117 --> 00:55:00,278
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just thinking RPGs.

798
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:00,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.

799
00:55:00,578 --> 00:55:01,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

800
00:55:01,934 --> 00:55:03,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's the thing.

801
00:55:03,655 --> 00:55:04,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been saying this for years.

802
00:55:04,655 --> 00:55:06,216
[SPEAKER_04]: It should mirror the movie system.

803
00:55:06,416 --> 00:55:11,217
[SPEAKER_04]: If it said R or PG-13 or not yet rated, people would know what that meant.

804
00:55:12,018 --> 00:55:13,238
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, well, what's the game?

805
00:55:13,338 --> 00:55:14,699
[SPEAKER_04]: And she said it was Naruto.

806
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,540
[SPEAKER_04]: And I told her, I said, Naruto is based on a cartoon.

807
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,301
[SPEAKER_04]: The worst thing you're going to see in it is cartoon violence.

808
00:55:20,341 --> 00:55:20,881
[SPEAKER_04]: It's teen.

809
00:55:21,421 --> 00:55:22,041
[SPEAKER_04]: It's rated teen.

810
00:55:22,061 --> 00:55:23,081
[SPEAKER_04]: It's rated teen?

811
00:55:23,162 --> 00:55:23,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

812
00:55:24,202 --> 00:55:25,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of cartoon violence.

813
00:55:25,562 --> 00:55:26,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's beating up.

814
00:55:27,163 --> 00:55:27,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

815
00:55:28,145 --> 00:55:29,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I told her, I'm like, ah, it's a cartoon.

816
00:55:30,006 --> 00:55:31,287
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fine for your seven-year-old.

817
00:55:31,307 --> 00:55:32,847
[SPEAKER_11]: Oops!

818
00:55:33,568 --> 00:55:39,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, that's actually the same thing I think that the anime community has been sort of arguing against people for years now.

819
00:55:40,111 --> 00:55:42,692
[SPEAKER_11]: That just because it's animated doesn't mean it's for kids.

820
00:55:43,753 --> 00:55:44,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops.

821
00:55:44,953 --> 00:55:45,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you seen Perfect Blue?

822
00:55:46,114 --> 00:55:49,395
[SPEAKER_04]: But I said the worst thing you're going to see in it is cartoon violence.

823
00:55:49,595 --> 00:55:50,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Or boobs.

824
00:55:51,036 --> 00:55:52,657
[SPEAKER_04]: They do not have boobs in Naruto.

825
00:55:52,857 --> 00:55:54,438
[SPEAKER_14]: They do not have boobs in Naruto.

826
00:55:54,478 --> 00:55:54,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, they do.

827
00:55:56,064 --> 00:55:57,085
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to see you let your boobs.

828
00:55:57,105 --> 00:55:58,566
[SPEAKER_14]: This is on Cartoon Network, I mean.

829
00:55:58,706 --> 00:56:01,067
[SPEAKER_11]: The sexy nojutsu, yes, you do get boobies.

830
00:56:03,309 --> 00:56:03,609
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

831
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:04,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Ha ha.

832
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:07,011
[SPEAKER_14]: If that were the case, that show would be a lot more popular.

833
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:09,113
[SPEAKER_11]: They are cloud-covered boobies, but they're still boobies.

834
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:11,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah, yeah, here's the thing.

835
00:56:11,254 --> 00:56:16,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, and GS68 is like Sky, you know, the Japanese anime cartoons, not necessarily Kid Safe.

836
00:56:16,198 --> 00:56:18,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it wasn't La Blue Girl the game, okay?

837
00:56:19,099 --> 00:56:19,700
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't that.

838
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,701
[SPEAKER_04]: It was freaking Naruto.

839
00:56:20,741 --> 00:56:24,203
[SPEAKER_04]: That's rated E. Which is on a rated EC for early childhood.

840
00:56:24,998 --> 00:56:26,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Naruto's on freaking Cartoon Network.

841
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:27,320
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that.

842
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think it would be that bad.

843
00:56:30,623 --> 00:56:32,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, so what's the worst that happens?

844
00:56:32,665 --> 00:56:34,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Some seven-year-old kid sees boobies.

845
00:56:34,467 --> 00:56:35,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

846
00:56:39,331 --> 00:56:39,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

847
00:56:41,573 --> 00:56:42,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

848
00:56:43,455 --> 00:56:43,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Ding.

849
00:56:45,757 --> 00:56:46,618
[SPEAKER_14]: I did that on purpose.

850
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:49,760
[SPEAKER_14]: So, anyways.

851
00:56:50,962 --> 00:56:51,442
[SPEAKER_14]: I love doing that.

852
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:54,996
[SPEAKER_14]: A watchdog group, of course, the Nymph.

853
00:56:55,716 --> 00:56:59,017
[SPEAKER_14]: They gave the game industry AC.

854
00:56:59,317 --> 00:57:03,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, each year they put out their video game report card.

855
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:08,340
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, this is like one of those things... WHO THE FUCK ARE THESE PEOPLE AND WHY SHOULD I CARE?

856
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:15,162
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, they are the National Institute on Media and the Family.

857
00:57:15,862 --> 00:57:24,869
[SPEAKER_14]: They basically will do those wonderful undercover stings where they'll see if people will sell them M-rated games and stuff like that, or their kids and whatnot.

858
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:34,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Really, my thing is, who gives a shit if they're rating so... You know, if I rated the industry an F, would people give a shit that I'm rating an F?

859
00:57:34,677 --> 00:57:35,638
[SPEAKER_14]: No one really cares.

860
00:57:35,678 --> 00:57:43,364
[SPEAKER_04]: This industry, or watchdog organization, excuse me, this watchdog organization sounds like the group in Footloose that told the townspeople they can't dance.

861
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:44,919
[SPEAKER_14]: Something like that.

862
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,580
[SPEAKER_14]: But apparently they've conducted a lot of research.

863
00:57:49,461 --> 00:57:58,424
[SPEAKER_14]: They found that 52% of the parents claim to use the ESRB rating system, but 72% know little or nothing about the rating system overall.

864
00:58:01,204 --> 00:58:02,625
[SPEAKER_14]: 72 plus 52 does not equal 100.

865
00:58:03,445 --> 00:58:04,265
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm confused.

866
00:58:04,405 --> 00:58:07,907
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, people use it despite the fact that they don't know anything about it.

867
00:58:08,687 --> 00:58:12,548
[SPEAKER_14]: That has... So that game's rated M. I like the letter M!

868
00:58:13,055 --> 00:58:13,695
[SPEAKER_14]: Go, son!

869
00:58:13,755 --> 00:58:14,375
[SPEAKER_14]: You can buy it!

870
00:58:14,576 --> 00:58:16,396
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, is that how they do it?

871
00:58:16,416 --> 00:58:17,237
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, seriously.

872
00:58:18,017 --> 00:58:20,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody cut loose, put loose.

873
00:58:20,678 --> 00:58:29,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, undercover shoppers that were under the age of 18 were able to buy M-rated games at nearly 50% of the time.

874
00:58:31,122 --> 00:58:32,422
[SPEAKER_14]: But really, here's the thing, though.

875
00:58:32,882 --> 00:58:35,743
[SPEAKER_14]: It's store policy not to sell M-rated games to minors.

876
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:37,904
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no law that says they have to do that.

877
00:58:38,004 --> 00:58:38,944
[SPEAKER_14]: So what's it matter?

878
00:58:39,545 --> 00:58:40,785
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I would tell them that.

879
00:58:41,704 --> 00:58:42,404
[SPEAKER_14]: To their faces?

880
00:58:42,905 --> 00:58:45,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, if I was a person, they'd be like, why?

881
00:58:45,386 --> 00:58:48,048
[SPEAKER_01]: You sold me an emery to game and I'm under 18.

882
00:58:48,348 --> 00:58:50,930
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, so?

883
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you should join one of these watchdog organizations just for laughs.

884
00:58:55,432 --> 00:58:56,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe like an undercover report.

885
00:58:57,193 --> 00:58:59,335
[SPEAKER_04]: What really goes on in these watchdog organizations?

886
00:59:00,896 --> 00:59:04,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see a watchdog organization for the watchdog organizations.

887
00:59:05,774 --> 00:59:06,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

888
00:59:06,715 --> 00:59:07,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to rate them.

889
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:09,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a fabulous idea.

890
00:59:09,716 --> 00:59:11,757
[SPEAKER_04]: So what would we call our watchdog organization?

891
00:59:12,538 --> 00:59:12,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

892
00:59:13,198 --> 00:59:13,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

893
00:59:13,798 --> 00:59:14,499
[SPEAKER_04]: You think about that.

894
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:15,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat room.

895
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:16,540
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm putting that challenge to you guys.

896
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:17,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.

897
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:17,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.

898
00:59:17,681 --> 00:59:17,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.

899
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:18,081
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

900
00:59:18,141 --> 00:59:18,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

901
00:59:18,581 --> 00:59:18,901
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

902
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:21,823
[SPEAKER_14]: Their nymph, I'll be nympho.

903
00:59:24,905 --> 00:59:25,485
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that.

904
00:59:26,065 --> 00:59:27,646
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what the O would stand for.

905
00:59:31,248 --> 00:59:31,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Overseer.

906
00:59:31,828 --> 00:59:32,289
[SPEAKER_14]: There we go.

907
00:59:32,309 --> 00:59:32,929
[SPEAKER_14]: That'll work.

908
00:59:34,178 --> 00:59:37,580
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be the National Institute on Media and Family Overseer.

909
00:59:39,181 --> 00:59:39,641
[SPEAKER_14]: Nympho.

910
00:59:40,562 --> 00:59:40,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Love it.

911
00:59:41,702 --> 00:59:42,643
[SPEAKER_09]: That's beautiful.

912
00:59:44,864 --> 00:59:46,925
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the greatest insights to come.

913
00:59:46,965 --> 00:59:50,888
[SPEAKER_03]: And, like, the years I've been doing this radio program, that's one of the greatest, I'll tell you.

914
00:59:53,069 --> 00:59:53,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

915
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:54,270
[SPEAKER_11]: That's lovely.

916
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:56,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Rosteel, you too.

917
00:59:56,411 --> 00:59:57,191
[SPEAKER_11]: You did it, too.

918
00:59:57,551 --> 00:59:58,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this.

919
00:59:58,452 --> 00:59:59,252
[SPEAKER_10]: You did it.

920
00:59:59,332 --> 00:59:59,753
[SPEAKER_04]: You did it.

921
00:59:59,773 --> 00:59:59,893
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

922
01:00:00,113 --> 01:00:00,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, forget it.

923
01:00:01,434 --> 01:00:01,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

924
01:00:02,367 --> 01:00:06,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Rostio UT says, The Institute for a Media Whore Free America.

925
01:00:09,169 --> 01:00:12,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Tetsuya says, National Institute Media Family, OLR.

926
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:15,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Frisbee says, OLR is watching you poop.

927
01:00:17,131 --> 01:00:17,911
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about that one.

928
01:00:17,931 --> 01:00:18,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to watch that.

929
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:21,952
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is wrong with you people?

930
01:00:22,693 --> 01:00:24,233
[SPEAKER_04]: OLR is watching you poop in a tube.

931
01:00:24,313 --> 01:00:25,013
[SPEAKER_04]: That's gross.

932
01:00:26,334 --> 01:00:30,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Loki watched those two girls poop in a cup, but that's something completely different.

933
01:00:30,535 --> 01:00:31,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of people watch that

934
01:00:32,205 --> 01:00:36,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, moving on, let's talk about EVE Online.

935
01:00:49,785 --> 01:00:52,728
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened is that there was a new update that went out.

936
01:00:52,768 --> 01:00:54,870
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the Premium Trinity patch.

937
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:58,313
[SPEAKER_04]: And it went out a little earlier this week, I think about Thursday-ish.

938
01:00:58,633 --> 01:01:08,521
[SPEAKER_04]: And what happened is that it added a bunch of new features to the game, but the patch also removed the boot.ini file off of your Windows XP.

939
01:01:09,822 --> 01:01:10,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray!

940
01:01:11,644 --> 01:01:13,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Which kind of fucks your operating system.

941
01:01:15,953 --> 01:01:18,014
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was a quote from the official support page.

942
01:01:18,094 --> 01:01:24,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote, if you are only using the classic client or installed the premium client using the full premium installer, then you are not affected.

943
01:01:25,237 --> 01:01:29,899
[SPEAKER_04]: If you upgraded the classic client to the premium client using the content upgrade, then please read on.

944
01:01:30,339 --> 01:01:34,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Check the root directory of your hard drive and see if you have a boot.ini file.

945
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,861
[SPEAKER_04]: If so, then you are not affected.

946
01:01:36,753 --> 01:01:44,259
[SPEAKER_04]: The file is normally hidden, so you need to click Tools, Folder Options, View and Select, show hidden files and folders, and uncheck Hide Protected Operating System.

947
01:01:44,299 --> 01:01:45,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just be able to see it.

948
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,341
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also blah, blah, blah, blah, so on and so on.

949
01:01:48,122 --> 01:01:50,884
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck were you doing touching that file in the first place?

950
01:01:50,944 --> 01:01:51,885
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to know.

951
01:01:52,686 --> 01:01:53,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, how did that happen?

952
01:01:54,487 --> 01:02:01,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, seriously, there's a part of me that goes, some pissed off bitch in this organization, like, threw that in there just to, like, fuck with these guys.

953
01:02:02,073 --> 01:02:02,834
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so sad.

954
01:02:02,874 --> 01:02:04,135
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet she's planning on quitting.

955
01:02:05,256 --> 01:02:05,476
[SPEAKER_10]: And so...

956
01:02:06,178 --> 01:02:11,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Program, delete, boot.ini Bye, my two weeks are up.

957
01:02:12,122 --> 01:02:13,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know how the program works.

958
01:02:15,165 --> 01:02:15,805
[SPEAKER_04]: For real.

959
01:02:15,925 --> 01:02:16,546
[SPEAKER_10]: I quit.

960
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:20,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Frisbee says, uh-oh, SpaghettiOs.

961
01:02:20,368 --> 01:02:22,150
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll take my severance pay now.

962
01:02:25,592 --> 01:02:27,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun storming the castle.

963
01:02:27,754 --> 01:02:27,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

964
01:02:29,113 --> 01:02:30,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, don't touch the boot.info.

965
01:02:30,733 --> 01:02:37,335
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, Windows XP should, like, you know, if you're going to delete a file like that, it should go, are you sure?

966
01:02:38,115 --> 01:02:43,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Windows XP should have a little dialog box that says, when you delete this file, you will fuck your whole computer up.

967
01:02:43,697 --> 01:02:45,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you sure you want to delete this file?

968
01:02:45,677 --> 01:02:47,517
[SPEAKER_04]: And a little picture of Bill Gates going, no, no, no.

969
01:02:47,537 --> 01:02:48,478
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet there is something.

970
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:57,540
[SPEAKER_11]: But, like, even if it is, like, if this person now that I'm imagining is going, click yes for are you sure.

971
01:03:00,976 --> 01:03:03,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob D says it sounds like the SimCopter bug.

972
01:03:03,497 --> 01:03:04,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember the SimCopter bug?

973
01:03:05,178 --> 01:03:17,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Where it was one of the first appearances of same-sex relations in a game because a gay programmer actually programmed it in there that guys would kiss guys on this guy's birthday and then left the company.

974
01:03:17,644 --> 01:03:18,244
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great.

975
01:03:18,985 --> 01:03:20,085
[SPEAKER_14]: It was more than that, I think.

976
01:03:21,306 --> 01:03:23,087
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a lot more than kissing going on there.

977
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, this is a family show.

978
01:03:25,393 --> 01:03:26,133
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need to go there.

979
01:03:26,393 --> 01:03:27,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, this is a family show.

980
01:03:28,354 --> 01:03:30,594
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a dysfunctional family show.

981
01:03:31,194 --> 01:03:35,275
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we're going to open up the Skype line and welcome the extended members of our dysfunctional family.

982
01:03:35,315 --> 01:03:38,136
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be you folks, the listeners.

983
01:03:38,156 --> 01:03:39,036
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

984
01:03:39,156 --> 01:03:40,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

985
01:03:41,277 --> 01:03:48,218
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am dying to see how this works tonight when I only have half the strength out here on the Wi-Fi network out in the garage and we're trying to stream a show.

986
01:03:49,198 --> 01:03:51,519
[SPEAKER_04]: This could be very interesting, so we'll see what happens.

987
01:03:51,559 --> 01:03:52,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

988
01:03:54,261 --> 01:03:54,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Who are you?

989
01:03:54,741 --> 01:03:55,422
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your name?

990
01:04:22,463 --> 01:04:24,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you probably bought a case mod.

991
01:04:25,325 --> 01:04:25,746
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably.

992
01:04:27,147 --> 01:04:27,827
[SPEAKER_12]: Or maybe eBay.

993
01:04:27,847 --> 01:04:28,828
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't remember anymore.

994
01:04:29,128 --> 01:04:29,809
[SPEAKER_12]: My memory's fading.

995
01:04:30,229 --> 01:04:35,453
[SPEAKER_11]: They did sell though a new case for the Dreamcast that you could make that was clear.

996
01:04:35,754 --> 01:04:38,476
[SPEAKER_11]: And they also sold a bootleg of the Hello Kitty one too.

997
01:04:40,317 --> 01:04:41,298
[SPEAKER_12]: Does Rob got that one?

998
01:04:42,098 --> 01:04:42,619
[SPEAKER_12]: Do I have what?

999
01:04:43,578 --> 01:04:44,759
[SPEAKER_12]: The Hello Kitty Dreamcast?

1000
01:04:44,979 --> 01:04:46,461
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I do not have the Hello Kitty Dreamcast.

1001
01:04:46,561 --> 01:04:53,427
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually very excited because I found that I have two Dreamcasts, but then this guy named Loki said that one of his is his.

1002
01:04:56,209 --> 01:04:56,750
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up with that?

1003
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:58,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Why am I hearing myself?

1004
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:00,774
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that better?

1005
01:05:00,954 --> 01:05:01,374
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry about that.

1006
01:05:01,394 --> 01:05:01,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, much better.

1007
01:05:01,975 --> 01:05:02,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1008
01:05:06,509 --> 01:05:08,010
[SPEAKER_12]: GameTap, GameTap's on my mind.

1009
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:10,571
[SPEAKER_12]: I got Fremont from GameTap, very nice of them.

1010
01:05:10,832 --> 01:05:14,554
[SPEAKER_12]: You've realized they released a Mac client to their beautiful GameTap?

1011
01:05:14,574 --> 01:05:14,854
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1012
01:05:21,454 --> 01:05:22,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's one of the ones that's getting removed.

1013
01:05:22,635 --> 01:05:23,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the thing.

1014
01:05:23,736 --> 01:05:25,817
[SPEAKER_04]: We got linked the Wikipedia article.

1015
01:05:25,837 --> 01:05:26,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

1016
01:05:26,538 --> 01:05:33,463
[SPEAKER_04]: The game game controversy when a designer inserted sprites of shirtless himbos, male bimbos, in speedo trunks.

1017
01:05:33,503 --> 01:05:34,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that term, himbos.

1018
01:05:34,884 --> 01:05:36,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to use that in a sentence every day.

1019
01:05:36,985 --> 01:05:41,488
[SPEAKER_04]: In speedo trunks who hugged and kissed each other who appear in great numbers on certain dates.

1020
01:05:41,889 --> 01:05:49,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Their fluorescent nipples were drawn with a special rendering mode usually reserved for fog-piercing runway landing lights.

1021
01:05:49,813 --> 01:05:53,054
[SPEAKER_04]: So they could easily be seen from long distances in bad weathers.

1022
01:05:53,634 --> 01:06:04,738
[SPEAKER_04]: An unintended emergent behavior of the code caused hundreds of himbos to swarm and crowd around the helicopter where they would be slashed up by the blades and then need to be airlifted to the hospital, which earned the player easy money.

1023
01:06:05,218 --> 01:06:08,819
[SPEAKER_04]: The Easter egg was caught shortly after release and removed from future copies of the game.

1024
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:11,700
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the designer was fired.

1025
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:12,221
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't leave.

1026
01:06:12,261 --> 01:06:13,201
[SPEAKER_04]: He got fired.

1027
01:06:13,521 --> 01:06:14,821
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's how you access it, too.

1028
01:06:15,142 --> 01:06:19,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, if you go into the game, you go into career mode, hit control, alt, X.

1029
01:06:19,605 --> 01:06:27,748
[SPEAKER_14]: Warp Me to Career 29 Control Alt X 300 guys in bathing suits will appear For fun, since there are no military helicopters in the game, fire tear gas at them.

1030
01:06:27,768 --> 01:06:28,248
[SPEAKER_14]: That's just wrong.

1031
01:06:45,362 --> 01:06:46,382
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, sorry, Ravenstaff.

1032
01:06:46,682 --> 01:06:47,802
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree with that.

1033
01:06:47,842 --> 01:06:54,384
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was disgruntled someone, but who the fuck is messing with the freaking IDF file to corrupt your computer?

1034
01:06:54,484 --> 01:06:59,445
[SPEAKER_12]: They ever thought to them that it doesn't start your operating system.

1035
01:06:59,585 --> 01:07:01,505
[SPEAKER_12]: So how the hell do you find it in the first place?

1036
01:07:01,525 --> 01:07:04,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody needs to explain funny, not funny.

1037
01:07:04,385 --> 01:07:07,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Deleting my boot INI file, not funny.

1038
01:07:07,766 --> 01:07:08,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Himbos, funny.

1039
01:07:09,906 --> 01:07:12,747
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're going to do something disgruntled, make it funny.

1040
01:07:14,795 --> 01:07:15,855
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but you can't find it.

1041
01:07:15,955 --> 01:07:20,957
[SPEAKER_12]: They said their thing is like, you can't get into the operating system, how do you find it?

1042
01:07:20,997 --> 01:07:21,517
[SPEAKER_04]: You're screwed.

1043
01:07:21,857 --> 01:07:23,638
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to use a disk, basically.

1044
01:07:24,638 --> 01:07:27,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, what was the other thing you wanted to call in about tonight?

1045
01:07:27,659 --> 01:07:29,379
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about the Mac client of GameTap.

1046
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,961
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a brand new Mac client.

1047
01:07:33,461 --> 01:07:35,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to check it out.

1048
01:07:35,461 --> 01:07:38,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you still have to have the Intel chip in your Mac?

1049
01:07:38,282 --> 01:07:38,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1050
01:07:39,343 --> 01:07:40,523
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't use it.

1051
01:07:41,823 --> 01:07:42,103
[SPEAKER_12]: Lame.

1052
01:07:43,024 --> 01:07:44,004
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's much lighter than

1053
01:07:44,545 --> 01:07:48,607
[SPEAKER_12]: More games run smoothly on the Mac and on the Windows side as well.

1054
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:50,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything runs great on both sides.

1055
01:07:50,467 --> 01:07:53,388
[SPEAKER_04]: But now you can't run the Windows-based games on the Mac, right?

1056
01:07:53,408 --> 01:07:54,789
[SPEAKER_04]: They just took that category out of it.

1057
01:07:54,829 --> 01:07:55,629
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, that's gone.

1058
01:07:55,949 --> 01:07:56,309
[SPEAKER_12]: I figured.

1059
01:07:56,370 --> 01:08:00,391
[SPEAKER_12]: The Windows games, so you lost like 800 games on the Mac side.

1060
01:08:01,371 --> 01:08:04,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, but you still get all the arcade games.

1061
01:08:05,033 --> 01:08:06,413
[SPEAKER_04]: You get the Genesis games.

1062
01:08:06,553 --> 01:08:07,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, that's cool.

1063
01:08:07,434 --> 01:08:07,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Atari 2600?

1064
01:08:08,871 --> 01:08:09,211
[SPEAKER_04]: DOS.

1065
01:08:10,112 --> 01:08:11,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you get the DOS games?

1066
01:08:11,613 --> 01:08:12,835
[SPEAKER_04]: You get DOS games as well.

1067
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:14,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that makes sense, because of the chip.

1068
01:08:14,196 --> 01:08:14,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's cool.

1069
01:08:15,137 --> 01:08:15,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, good.

1070
01:08:15,737 --> 01:08:15,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad.

1071
01:08:15,957 --> 01:08:21,142
[SPEAKER_04]: There were a lot of people really pissed off about the fact that there was no GameTab Mac client, so good for them making good on that.

1072
01:08:22,843 --> 01:08:24,505
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to add one thing to that.

1073
01:08:26,066 --> 01:08:28,208
[SPEAKER_12]: I got a free month from them, so I'm happy about that.

1074
01:08:28,588 --> 01:08:29,689
[SPEAKER_12]: Who'd you have to blow to get that?

1075
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:31,211
[SPEAKER_12]: No one.

1076
01:08:31,231 --> 01:08:36,015
[SPEAKER_12]: I just said I had problems with the PC version, and I'm like, well, we'll just add another free month for you.

1077
01:08:37,639 --> 01:08:39,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Dang, I'm going to call GameTap and tell them I have some problems.

1078
01:08:41,602 --> 01:08:44,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, my boot.ini file got deleted by your client.

1079
01:08:45,065 --> 01:08:45,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what happens.

1080
01:08:46,286 --> 01:08:49,229
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, RavensDolphin, any other quick thoughts before we let you go and get to somebody else?

1081
01:08:50,197 --> 01:08:52,057
[SPEAKER_12]: No, but I think that sucks.

1082
01:08:52,097 --> 01:09:00,680
[SPEAKER_12]: How do you get a game like that and just boot a game and you go like, well, I got it, and then you restart your computer and you're like, what the fuck?

1083
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:01,440
What happened?

1084
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it sucks to be those guys.

1085
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:06,601
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really sorry to all the EVE Online players who got fucked over by that one.

1086
01:09:06,621 --> 01:09:07,361
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks to you.

1087
01:09:07,481 --> 01:09:08,341
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'm going back to Godfather.

1088
01:09:08,661 --> 01:09:09,222
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, see ya.

1089
01:09:10,602 --> 01:09:12,983
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, if you want to give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR.

1090
01:09:13,043 --> 01:09:15,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1091
01:09:15,103 --> 01:09:17,784
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll also get to some last-minute stories, and then the show is done.

1092
01:09:18,344 --> 01:09:18,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray!

1093
01:09:20,074 --> 01:09:23,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, aw, that's sad, because then there's no more OLR till next week.

1094
01:09:23,416 --> 01:09:24,077
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you going to do?

1095
01:09:24,978 --> 01:09:28,660
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, phone's not ringing just yet, so let's get a couple quick last-minute stories.

1096
01:09:29,361 --> 01:09:30,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I lied, here it comes.

1097
01:09:31,762 --> 01:09:33,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1098
01:09:34,244 --> 01:09:37,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Sky, it's Jonathan F., your fantasy star whore.

1099
01:09:37,286 --> 01:09:39,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hello, our fantasy star whore, how are you?

1100
01:09:41,129 --> 01:09:43,591
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing just fine here.

1101
01:09:43,671 --> 01:09:46,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you playing The Abortion of the Illuminists, or whatever that's called?

1102
01:09:48,388 --> 01:09:49,849
[SPEAKER_13]: Ambition of the Illuminist, actually.

1103
01:09:50,089 --> 01:09:50,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, I see.

1104
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:54,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you can find me running around in a rappy called Brightstar.

1105
01:09:55,914 --> 01:10:01,018
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, I wanted to just call in and let you know about some of the big stories that are going on right now with this.

1106
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,701
[SPEAKER_13]: The first big one is that there's actually another expansion coming out.

1107
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:09,665
[SPEAKER_13]: But the thing about this one is that it's for the PSP only.

1108
01:10:10,485 --> 01:10:13,207
[SPEAKER_13]: And funny enough, it's named... Wait, the PSP?

1109
01:10:13,708 --> 01:10:15,349
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, PSP's getting a fancy Stargame.

1110
01:10:16,417 --> 01:10:18,039
[SPEAKER_14]: So wait, this can't be an expansion.

1111
01:10:18,059 --> 01:10:18,999
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a whole new game, right?

1112
01:10:19,019 --> 01:10:19,500
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a whole new game.

1113
01:10:20,881 --> 01:10:26,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, basically what it is, it's going to expand upon the story that's already there and add some new missions into it.

1114
01:10:28,268 --> 01:10:34,013
[SPEAKER_13]: And the real funny thing about it is that when you condense it from its original name, Phantasy Star Portable, it makes PSP.

1115
01:10:35,714 --> 01:10:36,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there you go.

1116
01:10:36,495 --> 01:10:37,716
[SPEAKER_04]: So PSP on the PSP.

1117
01:10:39,238 --> 01:10:39,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1118
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:40,739
[SPEAKER_04]: There you have it.

1119
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:42,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1120
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:42,620
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, go ahead.

1121
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, go ahead.

1122
01:11:08,638 --> 01:11:08,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

1123
01:11:09,618 --> 01:11:26,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, what's coming back in this version, actually, starting in just a couple of short weeks here in Japan, or over in Japan, I mean, there's going to be an event called the Maximum Attack G, whereby they are bringing back some of the original Phantasy Star Online stages.

1124
01:11:27,222 --> 01:11:28,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, that could be kind of cool.

1125
01:11:29,542 --> 01:11:31,523
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

1126
01:11:31,763 --> 01:11:33,003
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to bring back Cave...

1127
01:11:33,829 --> 01:11:36,951
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, what were the names of those stages in the old one?

1128
01:11:36,971 --> 01:11:38,693
[SPEAKER_04]: They had Cave and, what, Ship?

1129
01:11:40,154 --> 01:11:44,977
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the Forest, Cave, Mines, and Ruins, they are all confirmed at this point, pretty much.

1130
01:11:45,157 --> 01:11:46,178
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, that's kind of cool.

1131
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:54,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any Episode 2, 3, or 4 stages coming back, but who knows, that could be for yet another expansion.

1132
01:11:55,364 --> 01:11:56,745
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I need to get back.

1133
01:11:56,805 --> 01:12:01,629
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, dammit, I am getting so sick of some of the MMOs I'm playing now, I think I need to give PSU another shot.

1134
01:12:02,358 --> 01:12:03,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I need to give this game another shot.

1135
01:12:03,759 --> 01:12:04,039
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do.

1136
01:12:04,059 --> 01:12:04,499
[SPEAKER_10]: You want mine?

1137
01:12:05,099 --> 01:12:05,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

1138
01:12:05,519 --> 01:12:05,899
[SPEAKER_10]: You want mine?

1139
01:12:05,939 --> 01:12:06,640
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I have the game.

1140
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:08,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I was going to burn mine.

1141
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:13,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking about, wait, how much does Abortion of the Illuminous cost to download on Xbox?

1142
01:12:16,043 --> 01:12:19,744
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was 2,000 points.

1143
01:12:19,764 --> 01:12:20,404
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm trying to remember.

1144
01:12:20,845 --> 01:12:21,305
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not too bad.

1145
01:12:21,385 --> 01:12:22,025
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about 20 bucks.

1146
01:12:22,985 --> 01:12:23,225
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1147
01:12:23,245 --> 01:12:23,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to think about it.

1148
01:12:25,126 --> 01:12:25,546
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1149
01:12:25,626 --> 01:12:27,507
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some things about PSU I kind of miss.

1150
01:12:27,907 --> 01:12:29,568
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't horrible, so I don't know.

1151
01:12:29,588 --> 01:12:30,408
[SPEAKER_11]: I miss PSO.

1152
01:12:31,391 --> 01:12:33,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard they're, you know what, we got news coming in.

1153
01:12:33,693 --> 01:12:36,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this true that they're shutting off Blue Burst?

1154
01:12:36,655 --> 01:12:36,795
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

1155
01:12:36,855 --> 01:12:38,696
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that was going to be the next thing.

1156
01:12:39,637 --> 01:12:40,237
[SPEAKER_13]: The U.S.

1157
01:12:40,297 --> 01:12:42,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Blue Burst servers are going down.

1158
01:12:43,059 --> 01:12:44,160
[SPEAKER_11]: That's stupid.

1159
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I was actually going to start playing that again.

1160
01:12:50,184 --> 01:12:56,669
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the big questions right now is, is the, is Clumsy Orbit and the rest of the GM team going to,

1161
01:12:57,099 --> 01:12:57,840
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1162
01:13:25,854 --> 01:13:31,538
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, we've got to let you go here as soon as we can get some more calls, but any last thoughts from our Phantasy Star whore, Jonathan F.?

1163
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:33,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Just one thing.

1164
01:13:33,459 --> 01:13:37,982
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to announce a little project I'm working on for the 20th anniversary of Phantasy Star.

1165
01:13:38,282 --> 01:13:39,503
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, go for it.

1166
01:13:40,283 --> 01:13:53,031
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called Phantasy Star Dreams Forever, and basically what it is, it's a remix album, which basically goes through the history of Phantasy Star from the original Sega Master System game all the way up to the Phantasy Star universe,

1167
01:13:53,570 --> 01:13:58,233
[SPEAKER_13]: and it's going to be a track list of about 108 tracks that's going to basically be all developed by the community.

1168
01:13:58,273 --> 01:14:03,517
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just going to take more of a general manager position on things here aside from maybe just a couple of contributions.

1169
01:14:04,017 --> 01:14:08,200
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can read up all the details at the website, fantasystarmonthly.com.

1170
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:09,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.

1171
01:14:09,741 --> 01:14:10,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, good luck on that project.

1172
01:14:10,761 --> 01:14:12,763
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a pretty big project you guys are taking on.

1173
01:14:13,163 --> 01:14:19,587
[SPEAKER_04]: And since we are a radio station, send us some of the upbeat radio-friendly tracks when it's done and we'll put some in rotation on the station.

1174
01:14:20,731 --> 01:14:22,133
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, there's one online right now.

1175
01:14:22,193 --> 01:14:24,817
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want, I'll send you a link to it through the chat.

1176
01:14:25,237 --> 01:14:25,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Do that.

1177
01:14:26,819 --> 01:14:27,060
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1178
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:27,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Please do.

1179
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:27,701
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1180
01:14:27,721 --> 01:14:28,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to you so much.

1181
01:14:28,902 --> 01:14:30,264
[SPEAKER_04]: And have fun with Phantasy Star.

1182
01:14:30,785 --> 01:14:31,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe see you soon.

1183
01:14:31,446 --> 01:14:31,686
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1184
01:14:31,826 --> 01:14:32,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Always glad to be on the show.

1185
01:14:33,028 --> 01:14:33,268
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1186
01:14:33,308 --> 01:14:33,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

1187
01:14:36,951 --> 01:14:38,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Jonathan was out here a long time ago.

1188
01:14:39,414 --> 01:14:39,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember him?

1189
01:14:40,075 --> 01:14:43,479
[SPEAKER_04]: He came out here a long, long time ago and he was talking about tech TV and stuff.

1190
01:14:43,499 --> 01:14:43,979
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty good.

1191
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:45,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to hear he's listening again.

1192
01:14:45,741 --> 01:14:50,827
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, call us, 877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1193
01:14:51,968 --> 01:14:53,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get some last minute stories real quick.

1194
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:53,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1195
01:14:53,870 --> 01:14:55,232
[SPEAKER_14]: They're breaking the studio.

1196
01:14:56,112 --> 01:14:57,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, they're throwing those stuff.

1197
01:14:57,674 --> 01:15:00,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, the stuffed animals are there to look cute, not to be thrown.

1198
01:15:01,077 --> 01:15:02,178
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care if all the lead is off.

1199
01:15:02,198 --> 01:15:03,379
[SPEAKER_14]: One last story here real quick.

1200
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:11,346
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently a dad has caught, or there was a dad who caught his son smoking pot.

1201
01:15:11,647 --> 01:15:17,752
[SPEAKER_14]: So what he did was he put his son's Guitar Hero 3 Christmas gift up on the eBay to punish him.

1202
01:15:19,514 --> 01:15:20,275
[SPEAKER_14]: That's news?

1203
01:15:21,138 --> 01:15:21,858
[SPEAKER_14]: That is news.

1204
01:15:21,878 --> 01:15:22,739
[SPEAKER_11]: That's smart.

1205
01:15:22,759 --> 01:15:24,080
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great parenting.

1206
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:25,820
[SPEAKER_14]: That is wonderful parenting.

1207
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:26,241
[SPEAKER_14]: I love it.

1208
01:15:26,781 --> 01:15:28,482
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's actually still on eBay right now.

1209
01:15:29,642 --> 01:15:29,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1210
01:15:31,744 --> 01:15:32,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1211
01:15:32,944 --> 01:15:33,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1212
01:15:34,105 --> 01:15:34,845
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Legend of Zaku.

1213
01:15:35,145 --> 01:15:35,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Zaku.

1214
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:36,406
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

1215
01:15:37,486 --> 01:15:39,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Nah, just nothing chilling.

1216
01:15:39,547 --> 01:15:41,929
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, going through the gaming week as usual.

1217
01:15:42,809 --> 01:15:44,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let me rephrase the question.

1218
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:46,311
[SPEAKER_04]: To what do we owe this telephone call tonight?

1219
01:15:47,439 --> 01:15:58,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I don't know, the usual arrow-smashing news, like, you know, how Supernova 2 is supposed to come out this month, and the fact that Betson is being dicks about holding EMUs back.

1220
01:16:00,909 --> 01:16:07,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm, um, yeah, I mean, I guess I've heard about Supernova 2, but, you know, I had a real... Zach, I want to share with you my revelation I had the other day.

1221
01:16:07,954 --> 01:16:10,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I talk to you, you know, man-to-man a little bit?

1222
01:16:10,656 --> 01:16:12,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a revelation I had the other day, is that...

1223
01:16:13,733 --> 01:16:17,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I was on Xbox Live and I was playing Portal, because I've been playing Portal a lot this week.

1224
01:16:17,415 --> 01:16:26,781
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know my buddy Shane used to work at Konami, has had a big part in DDR, and he doesn't live here in California, he lives in Kansas, so we talk a lot over Xbox Live.

1225
01:16:27,061 --> 01:16:29,102
[SPEAKER_04]: And I noticed that he was playing DDR Universe 2.

1226
01:16:29,742 --> 01:16:34,805
[SPEAKER_04]: And he sent me a message on Xbox Live and he said, you know, Universe 2, blah, blah, blah, and he was telling me his thoughts on the game.

1227
01:16:34,845 --> 01:16:38,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And I came to a realization, Zaku, and that realization was,

1228
01:16:38,769 --> 01:16:39,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of over DDR.

1229
01:16:40,110 --> 01:16:40,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I really am.

1230
01:16:42,372 --> 01:16:46,095
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a lot that I care about that's going on in DDR anymore.

1231
01:16:46,455 --> 01:16:49,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not getting a boner over Supernova 2 like a lot of people are.

1232
01:16:49,778 --> 01:16:54,602
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's sad to say, because obviously without DDR this show would not exist.

1233
01:16:54,682 --> 01:16:56,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Without DDR I would not know Jamie.

1234
01:16:56,263 --> 01:16:57,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Without DDR I would not know Loki.

1235
01:16:58,025 --> 01:16:59,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Without DDR I would not know Puppy.

1236
01:17:00,286 --> 01:17:03,549
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR has fucked up my life in so many good ways.

1237
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:04,570
[SPEAKER_04]: And bad.

1238
01:17:05,086 --> 01:17:07,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because there was that house I lived in five years ago.

1239
01:17:07,367 --> 01:17:08,287
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a whole other story.

1240
01:17:08,868 --> 01:17:10,868
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR has... Real World Rob Edition.

1241
01:17:11,008 --> 01:17:11,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

1242
01:17:11,969 --> 01:17:12,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

1243
01:17:12,509 --> 01:17:13,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.

1244
01:17:13,489 --> 01:17:14,510
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not so bad.

1245
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:15,930
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, people grow out of it.

1246
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:19,052
[SPEAKER_07]: People stay on and live all of their lives.

1247
01:17:19,192 --> 01:17:21,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Zaku, I didn't grow out of DDR.

1248
01:17:21,933 --> 01:17:23,494
[SPEAKER_04]: You just don't care about it as much anymore.

1249
01:17:23,514 --> 01:17:27,295
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR has refused to change over the past five years.

1250
01:17:27,415 --> 01:17:28,776
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the problem I'm having with it.

1251
01:17:28,836 --> 01:17:31,757
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same fucking game I played five years ago, and I'm just kind of done with it.

1252
01:17:33,123 --> 01:17:39,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but I mean, I know people, most of the people that I know, they used to, you know, they're like some of the best in the city.

1253
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:40,849
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't play as much anymore.

1254
01:17:40,889 --> 01:17:41,930
[SPEAKER_07]: They pretty much moved on.

1255
01:17:43,334 --> 01:17:48,897
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you, if Konami wants to bring me back, they just need to innovate the game.

1256
01:17:49,117 --> 01:17:49,877
[SPEAKER_04]: It's possible.

1257
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:56,441
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to do it in little ways on the consoles, but they need to do it in a major way in the arcade and bring people back.

1258
01:17:56,461 --> 01:18:00,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, in the arcade they tried EMUs, but there's other factors that are holding it back.

1259
01:18:00,543 --> 01:18:05,065
[SPEAKER_07]: From what I hear, Betson is the reason why it's not happening in this country at all.

1260
01:18:05,465 --> 01:18:07,626
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't believe that it's going to be successful.

1261
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:17,096
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know Konami does their, you know, tries their damn hardest and it's just other folks that are just being dicks about it.

1262
01:18:17,236 --> 01:18:23,583
[SPEAKER_07]: And not, you know, they're just, they're just non-believers and, you know, it's like they don't really give a shit about it.

1263
01:18:25,536 --> 01:18:27,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I knew more about programming.

1264
01:18:27,697 --> 01:18:33,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I would want to design my own music game that was dancing that's not a ripoff of DDR or in the groove or any of that stuff.

1265
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:35,742
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I have a lot of ideas floating around my head for the past five years.

1266
01:18:35,902 --> 01:18:36,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wish I could do it.

1267
01:18:36,742 --> 01:18:36,942
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1268
01:18:37,162 --> 01:18:40,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't they make a ParaPara game but without ParaPara music?

1269
01:18:40,204 --> 01:18:44,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I remember when fucking Prestige used to fucking break out the Para shit.

1270
01:18:44,647 --> 01:18:45,707
[SPEAKER_14]: That was kind of cool looking.

1271
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:50,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Granted, you know, people would make fun of it just like DDR, but it was a little different.

1272
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:50,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

1273
01:18:52,293 --> 01:18:57,595
[SPEAKER_15]: or they could just add a Ticket Redemption game to DDR and there you go.

1274
01:18:57,615 --> 01:19:00,276
[SPEAKER_15]: Just throw it in a grave while you're at it.

1275
01:19:00,356 --> 01:19:01,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Ever heard of that game Spider Stomp?

1276
01:19:02,357 --> 01:19:04,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Spider Stomp?

1277
01:19:04,257 --> 01:19:07,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Those red buttons on the floor and you get tickets out of them.

1278
01:19:07,579 --> 01:19:13,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't that predate DDR a little bit more than it already is?

1279
01:19:14,642 --> 01:19:16,364
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1280
01:19:24,346 --> 01:19:27,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they have a DDR Supernova machine there, right?

1281
01:19:27,489 --> 01:19:28,910
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were like, oh, Supernova.

1282
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:33,474
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I looked to my left, and I was like, oh my god, they have Jumpin' Jackpot!

1283
01:19:33,554 --> 01:19:36,656
[SPEAKER_04]: And I ran over, and I played Jumpin' Jackpot!

1284
01:19:36,696 --> 01:19:42,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Last time I played Supernova was yesterday, and then before that, it was like, you know, weeks.

1285
01:19:42,922 --> 01:19:45,043
[SPEAKER_07]: I could go... Wait, let's let Jamie have her say it.

1286
01:19:45,064 --> 01:19:45,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, Jamie.

1287
01:19:45,744 --> 01:19:52,510
[SPEAKER_11]: We saw the DDR machine, and Dan and I were like, because my husband was here with us, we're like, hey, look, it's the new, um, uh...

1288
01:19:53,485 --> 01:19:54,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, shoot.

1289
01:19:54,085 --> 01:19:54,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Airplane game.

1290
01:19:54,986 --> 01:19:55,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Afterburner.

1291
01:19:55,286 --> 01:19:55,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Afterburner.

1292
01:19:55,926 --> 01:19:56,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1293
01:19:56,907 --> 01:20:02,590
[SPEAKER_11]: And we spent most of the time either on the Afterburner or on that ride that William and I rode.

1294
01:20:04,331 --> 01:20:04,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Not even that.

1295
01:20:05,012 --> 01:20:07,833
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm also getting into other arcade games like Wangan.

1296
01:20:07,873 --> 01:20:09,714
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm playing more Initial D now.

1297
01:20:09,794 --> 01:20:14,117
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, and I'm playing a lot more other Vermont games.

1298
01:20:14,157 --> 01:20:18,279
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, DDR is not really as much of an aspect in my life as it would be.

1299
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:21,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, I mean, I try to go out to most of the tournaments.

1300
01:20:21,957 --> 01:20:22,878
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

1301
01:20:45,712 --> 01:20:46,394
[SPEAKER_07]: CustomSongs

1302
01:20:54,258 --> 01:20:56,698
[SPEAKER_07]: for a better word just you know continue

1303
01:21:24,566 --> 01:21:25,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1304
01:21:56,514 --> 01:21:57,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god.

1305
01:21:57,955 --> 01:22:00,298
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's adapting, then I want off the boat.

1306
01:22:00,418 --> 01:22:04,982
[SPEAKER_07]: That's basically Konami's attempt of trying to suck money out of it dry.

1307
01:22:05,343 --> 01:22:08,126
[SPEAKER_07]: And eventually, remember, it's kind of like oil.

1308
01:22:08,386 --> 01:22:09,507
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to last forever.

1309
01:22:10,188 --> 01:22:14,953
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, he has to find an alternative means of just keeping the series alive.

1310
01:22:15,868 --> 01:22:18,410
[SPEAKER_07]: by trying to please as many people as possible.

1311
01:22:18,550 --> 01:22:27,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to let you go, buddy, Zaku, but thank you for bringing up Bomani, as you usually do, and, you know, kind of allowing me to share my revelations with you.

1312
01:22:28,396 --> 01:22:30,497
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to bring up other things, but I had to get it out.

1313
01:22:30,978 --> 01:22:31,398
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all right.

1314
01:22:31,938 --> 01:22:32,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Next time, Zaku.

1315
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:33,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk to you next time.

1316
01:22:33,859 --> 01:22:34,140
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1317
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,841
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do one more call, if anything comes through.

1318
01:22:36,861 --> 01:22:38,582
[SPEAKER_04]: 877-GAME-OLR.

1319
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:41,284
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that will play social commentary about oil, too.

1320
01:22:41,544 --> 01:22:42,565
[SPEAKER_04]: No more stories, really?

1321
01:22:42,985 --> 01:22:43,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, you have anything?

1322
01:22:43,706 --> 01:22:44,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Today's a boring week.

1323
01:22:45,133 --> 01:22:45,573
[SPEAKER_15]: This is boring.

1324
01:22:45,614 --> 01:22:48,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well then one more call and we'll call it a show.

1325
01:22:48,495 --> 01:22:54,399
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you seen, read the story that came up a couple days ago about that new PSP game called, I think it's Potsapon?

1326
01:22:54,959 --> 01:22:59,542
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like another, it's like a music game where you have all these little armies of creatures.

1327
01:22:59,562 --> 01:23:01,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that related to Panel de Pon?

1328
01:23:01,163 --> 01:23:03,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is, um, no, okay.

1329
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:03,845
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little bit different.

1330
01:23:03,925 --> 01:23:08,768
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like, I don't know, it's a little stretched, but it looks like LocoRoco, a little bit.

1331
01:23:09,188 --> 01:23:09,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1332
01:23:10,899 --> 01:23:15,862
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm actually looking in chat, and caller, just hold on just a minute, we'll get to you in a second, because I picked up a call and I haven't acknowledged him yet.

1333
01:23:16,262 --> 01:23:24,226
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, let's see, I'm just looking at some interesting, because obviously a lot of our hardcore listeners have been listening to us since the days where we were like nothing but Bomani Talk.

1334
01:23:24,586 --> 01:23:30,229
[SPEAKER_04]: GS191 says, the problem with DDR and arcades is basically that arcades are basically dead and nobody wants to do shit about it.

1335
01:23:30,649 --> 01:23:35,531
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem with DDR console releases is that the music is way too mainstream and alienates the core audience.

1336
01:23:36,312 --> 01:23:36,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1337
01:23:37,299 --> 01:23:41,820
[SPEAKER_04]: and Jaded says, because the concept is overdone, but the music concept is great.

1338
01:23:43,861 --> 01:23:46,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of agree a little bit.

1339
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:59,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Although there is some type of allure to being able to play popular radio songs on there, I do think that DDR kind of opened my eyes, so to speak, to whole other genres of music that I didn't know existed before.

1340
01:23:59,424 --> 01:23:59,924
[SPEAKER_04]: And who could forget

1341
01:24:02,897 --> 01:24:08,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye, aye, aye, I'm your little butterfly Who could forget how catchy that freaking song was the first time they heard it?

1342
01:24:08,401 --> 01:24:09,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Except for Loki.

1343
01:24:09,482 --> 01:24:10,323
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just Mr. Negative.

1344
01:24:10,643 --> 01:24:11,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Boom Boom Dollar.

1345
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:15,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, just a variety of music that was in that game.

1346
01:24:15,367 --> 01:24:22,232
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, I think, the Dance Maniacs series in general that kind of brought us a lot of music has been lost over the past few years, which is kind of sad.

1347
01:24:22,252 --> 01:24:30,198
[SPEAKER_15]: Because after I started playing DDR for the first year or so, I actually started going out and looking up these artists and finding what other music they had.

1348
01:24:31,038 --> 01:24:57,656
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know finding some good stuff that I still listen to but it's kind of a it just opens your eyes a little bit well the whole though going to the Dance Mania CDs all they are now is just more rehashes of the same yeah they're not exciting but then I look at Ultramix 2 and that opened my eyes to the whole synth pop and what you know indie a different drum label stuff and there's some awesome music on there and some of the bands that were in Ultramix 2 are like my favorite bands right now it's good stuff

1349
01:24:58,271 --> 01:25:07,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I just want to say real quick, Rob D in chat says, I disagree with that, I just think the DDR needs something new, releasing games with new songs just isn't going to cut it, and that's absolutely what I'm saying too.

1350
01:25:07,938 --> 01:25:09,098
[SPEAKER_04]: That's absolutely what I'm saying.

1351
01:25:09,399 --> 01:25:11,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyway, let's, I'm sorry, I've made our caller wait.

1352
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:12,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Caller, are you still there?

1353
01:25:13,121 --> 01:25:13,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.

1354
01:25:13,581 --> 01:25:14,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, who is this?

1355
01:25:15,202 --> 01:25:15,963
[SPEAKER_06]: It's GS68.

1356
01:25:16,203 --> 01:25:17,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi GS68, what's on your mind?

1357
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:17,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to make you wait.

1358
01:25:18,264 --> 01:25:22,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I've read about Super Smash Bros.

1359
01:25:22,187 --> 01:25:24,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Brawl online, and it's looking good.

1360
01:25:26,519 --> 01:25:30,620
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, you read it, you're cutting out a little bit, you read about it online and it is looking good or it isn't?

1361
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:31,841
[SPEAKER_06]: It isn't.

1362
01:25:32,001 --> 01:25:34,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I just sent you a link to show you why.

1363
01:25:34,781 --> 01:25:35,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let me look at this.

1364
01:25:36,042 --> 01:25:38,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Why, and in your mind, why is this not looking good?

1365
01:25:38,823 --> 01:25:39,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this about the friend codes?

1366
01:25:39,823 --> 01:25:46,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, for example, if you get disconnected and the CPU takes over, like, no one will know that you disconnected, I mean...

1367
01:25:47,796 --> 01:25:55,163
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll keep on thinking that it's the same person, which really bugs me because now I can't tell if someone quit and just played computer and stuff.

1368
01:25:55,183 --> 01:25:55,984
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but here's the thing, though.

1369
01:25:56,004 --> 01:25:59,647
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if it's not really indicating that the person's disconnected or not.

1370
01:25:59,667 --> 01:26:04,832
[SPEAKER_14]: It might say they've disconnected, but the player is being controlled by a computer now.

1371
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:07,110
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a very good point.

1372
01:26:07,150 --> 01:26:19,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I read about that earlier this week where basically just to recap for those who may not have heard, if you get disconnected or your Wii gets shut off or your power goes off or whatever in the middle of a match, you lose connection, the computer will automatically take control of your characters.

1373
01:26:19,138 --> 01:26:20,179
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're not having to wait.

1374
01:26:20,219 --> 01:26:21,660
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no buffer or anything like that.

1375
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,161
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the computer takes over.

1376
01:26:23,221 --> 01:26:33,007
[SPEAKER_04]: But I understand what GSTCA is saying is that if all the players disconnect and you're fighting the computer, how does online play differ from versus at all?

1377
01:26:34,188 --> 01:26:34,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1378
01:26:35,316 --> 01:26:41,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly, and plus since no one knows that you disconnected, there's no shame in disconnecting anymore.

1379
01:26:43,366 --> 01:26:50,314
[SPEAKER_04]: That is true, there should be a swift kick in the butt for when you disconnect, but hopefully... But it's going to reflect on their rankings, their stats.

1380
01:26:50,715 --> 01:26:54,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, no, you won't see their names or anything like...

1381
01:26:57,794 --> 01:27:00,015
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that they're going to address this stuff.

1382
01:27:00,055 --> 01:27:03,757
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, what they've shown so far, they're just kind of going over features.

1383
01:27:03,777 --> 01:27:07,279
[SPEAKER_14]: They haven't really delved into the details of what's going to be available on this.

1384
01:27:07,420 --> 01:27:07,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

1385
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:10,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Jonathan F. says, send in Mr. Resetti if they disconnect.

1386
01:27:11,502 --> 01:27:13,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Brilliant idea.

1387
01:27:13,463 --> 01:27:14,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Resetti's in there, isn't he?

1388
01:27:15,024 --> 01:27:15,424
[SPEAKER_04]: He is.

1389
01:27:16,485 --> 01:27:17,145
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there you go.

1390
01:27:18,006 --> 01:27:21,348
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, the Wii Online stuff in general just kind of sucks.

1391
01:27:21,428 --> 01:27:24,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it really needs an upgrade or a backbone or something.

1392
01:27:24,690 --> 01:27:25,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Nintendo's

1393
01:27:28,049 --> 01:27:28,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

1394
01:27:28,509 --> 01:27:35,012
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Nintendo is trying to make it online accessible for everyone, but in doing so, they're oversimplifying online.

1395
01:27:35,632 --> 01:27:38,794
[SPEAKER_04]: But let me tell you, okay, two stories for you.

1396
01:27:39,174 --> 01:27:44,357
[SPEAKER_04]: A, I'm in Geometry Wars Galaxies, and Geometry Wars Galaxies has online leaderboards, which is kind of cool.

1397
01:27:45,057 --> 01:27:47,719
[SPEAKER_04]: You register your name when you first go on, and you can go look at the leaderboards.

1398
01:27:47,999 --> 01:27:48,619
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the thing.

1399
01:27:48,879 --> 01:27:50,280
[SPEAKER_04]: You can look at the leaderboards for...

1400
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:54,143
[SPEAKER_04]: The top 10 scores or where you are on the leaderboards.

1401
01:27:54,523 --> 01:27:55,043
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

1402
01:27:55,184 --> 01:27:58,266
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're just looking at a big list of names that mean nothing to you.

1403
01:27:58,646 --> 01:28:02,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you can't filter the list by the friends on your Wii.

1404
01:28:02,609 --> 01:28:04,691
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't filter the list by anything but those things.

1405
01:28:04,711 --> 01:28:05,752
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of pointless.

1406
01:28:05,812 --> 01:28:06,652
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of stupid.

1407
01:28:07,413 --> 01:28:15,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I applaud Bizarre for trying to, you know, but I get the feeling they're just really restricted by Nintendo's lack of an online mainframe.

1408
01:28:15,865 --> 01:28:20,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that whole thing with the leaderboards is the same for Ghost Squad and the new Trauma Center as well.

1409
01:28:23,312 --> 01:28:24,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, yeah, I guess that's true.

1410
01:28:24,753 --> 01:28:26,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot Trauma Center has the leaderboards too.

1411
01:28:28,697 --> 01:28:30,919
[SPEAKER_06]: At least I recognized a couple names on the leaderboards.

1412
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:32,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you?

1413
01:28:33,361 --> 01:28:36,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because they're from GameFAQs and I post on GameFAQs.

1414
01:28:37,103 --> 01:28:39,865
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel sorry for you for posting on GameFAQs.

1415
01:29:05,009 --> 01:29:08,550
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, Nintendo's fault for having a weird online system.

1416
01:29:09,231 --> 01:29:11,432
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyhow.

1417
01:29:11,712 --> 01:29:13,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

1418
01:29:14,133 --> 01:29:15,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, no.

1419
01:29:15,553 --> 01:29:15,793
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1420
01:29:16,073 --> 01:29:17,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you very much for calling and listening to the show.

1421
01:29:17,874 --> 01:29:18,514
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

1422
01:29:18,594 --> 01:29:19,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.

1423
01:29:19,955 --> 01:29:20,495
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.

1424
01:29:20,795 --> 01:29:21,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

1425
01:29:22,476 --> 01:29:22,716
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1426
01:29:23,294 --> 01:29:30,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess that is going to be it for the calls tonight, and that's going to bring our show to a close as well, but thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening tonight.

1427
01:29:30,499 --> 01:29:31,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to everybody's final thoughts.

1428
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:35,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Puppy, thank you for being here, and I hope you enjoyed the new studio.

1429
01:29:35,523 --> 01:29:37,664
[SPEAKER_04]: It's much easier to breathe in here.

1430
01:29:38,045 --> 01:29:38,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.

1431
01:29:38,925 --> 01:29:43,148
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not nearly as uncomfortable as all cramming into an eight-foot space.

1432
01:29:43,309 --> 01:29:43,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1433
01:29:43,709 --> 01:29:44,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Any final thoughts, sir?

1434
01:29:47,151 --> 01:29:51,094
[SPEAKER_15]: I am not looking forward to the next three months of class.

1435
01:29:51,755 --> 01:29:52,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to hear it.

1436
01:29:52,919 --> 01:29:55,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, anyways, what's your final thought?

1437
01:29:55,821 --> 01:29:57,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm buying computer parts.

1438
01:29:59,482 --> 01:30:04,204
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is I want pie again.

1439
01:30:04,745 --> 01:30:06,746
[SPEAKER_04]: I say that every week, but I really, really do want pie.

1440
01:30:06,826 --> 01:30:09,027
[SPEAKER_15]: I have frozen pies in my freezer right now.

1441
01:30:09,327 --> 01:30:10,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, did you bring one with you?

1442
01:30:10,547 --> 01:30:11,068
[SPEAKER_15]: I did not.

1443
01:30:11,268 --> 01:30:11,708
[SPEAKER_15]: Bastard.

1444
01:30:12,428 --> 01:30:13,529
[SPEAKER_15]: I also have Smirnoffs, too.

1445
01:30:13,729 --> 01:30:14,609
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

1446
01:30:15,370 --> 01:30:16,270
