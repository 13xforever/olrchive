0	19920	Tonight, December 16th, 2007, internet radio hits the PSP in one part of the world, Mass
19920	24600	Effect and Assassin's Creed boast big sales, and how would you feel about a wee rain check
24600	31600	under the tree this Christmas?
31600	35120	Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
35120	36120	Radio.
36120	40440	We are that program on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,
40440	41520	and the gamer lifestyle.
41520	46000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always, say hello to the one and only, Dark Sakura,
46000	47000	Jamie Summers.
47000	48000	Yo.
48000	51000	How you doing, Miss Summers?
51000	52000	Long day?
52000	53320	Long weekend?
53320	54320	I don't know.
54320	55320	Yeah?
55320	56320	I'm thinking about it still.
56320	57320	I'm making a decision.
57320	58320	A decision?
58320	61120	But I can't do it without having, you know, without being fully informed.
61120	62280	Okay, well that's good.
62280	64640	You should always be fully informed when making a decision.
64640	65640	Yeah.
65640	68360	And I would like to say a nice decision on your shirt to wear to the show tonight.
68360	71080	I know the Op 11ers can't see it because the way our cam is, but...
71080	72800	I could go put my boobs in front of the camera.
72800	74760	A lovely, I bet the boys would like that.
74760	75760	A lovely...
75760	76760	That's quite all right.
76760	78840	A lovely pyramid head t-shirt she's wearing today with Silenil.
78840	82640	I'm wearing my very, very favorite long-sleeved shirt.
82640	83640	Very nice.
83640	84640	Keeps you warm.
84640	86160	Pyramid head keeps you warm during these winter months.
86160	87160	Keeps you warm with evil.
87160	88160	All right.
88160	89160	Sounds good.
89160	90880	Say hello as well to the one and only tech master, Loki.
90880	91880	Hello.
91880	92880	How are you doing, Loki?
92880	93880	I'm okay, I guess.
93880	94880	You're okay, you guess?
94880	97600	Uh, feeling a little ripped off.
97600	98600	What happened?
98600	103200	Um, well just a company I've been buying, like, stuff from my new computer with, uh,
103200	107960	EVGA, and I bought my motherboard and my graphics card from them.
107960	113600	Uh, literally the day after I bought my graphics card, NVIDIA went and redesigned it.
113600	117640	Made it cheaper, faster, and, um, better.
117640	118920	So that sucks.
118920	126760	And then, the motherboard that I bought doesn't have an onboard speaker, um, also doesn't
126760	132800	have, some of the motherboards have these little LED readouts for error codes.
132800	134480	So mine has none of that.
134480	139840	So, go figure, I go to boot up my computer, and nothing comes up.
139840	142400	So either the graphics card or the motherboard's broken.
142400	146560	Of course, I can't tell what's wrong, since there's no beeps, nor indication of what's
146560	147560	wrong.
147560	153200	And, I'm looking at the motherboard that they sell on EVGA's site, and there's stuff missing
153200	154200	off mine.
154200	160200	Like, um, I don't know, a PCI express slot that's supposed to be there that's not, and
160200	165000	uh, some other shit, so, they're gonna get an angry call tomorrow.
165000	166000	Sorry to hear that.
166000	169400	And now you just talked smack about them on your internet show, so, that's just lovely
169400	170400	to know.
170400	171400	Oh yeah, now they're feeling hurt.
171400	175760	Our always present fourth guest here on the program, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, our chat
175760	178840	room, we always tape live on Sunday nights, I know there's a lot of folks that listen
178840	184120	to us in our taped form on the podcast, um, but, of course listening live is a whole other
184120	190040	element where you get to, uh, do interactivity, um, question from AZHP, which graphics card
190040	191040	was it?
191040	193240	It's a 8800 GTS.
193240	195240	That means nothing to me, I have no idea what that's about.
195240	199480	It's a Nvidia card, they redesigned the GT, um, which made it a little bit faster using,
199480	205680	you know, the 65, uh, nanometer chips, and now they did the same thing with the, uh,
205680	206680	8800 GTS's.
206680	213640	So, for example, I paid for my card, it was like, um, let's see here, I think it was about
213640	214640	$364.99.
214640	215640	Wow.
215640	220560	Yeah, well that sounds, that's, that's quite a bit for a card.
220560	224280	Well here's the best part though, cause see, now I can get an even faster card, I wanna
224280	227560	save for about $100 cheaper.
227560	228560	Which is annoying.
228560	236000	I mean, it'll have, it'll have slightly less, um, graphics memory cause I had, uh, 640 megs
236000	243360	of RAM on there, but let's see here, the one now, the GTS, uh, it'd be 512 megs of, um,
243360	248880	RAM, and, okay, well it's not at that cheaper I guess, it's only, uh, it's $359.99, but
248880	252840	still, okay, it's a little bit cheaper, and it's even faster.
252840	256600	Alright, jeez, suddenly we're turning into the PC, uh, graphics card podcast, but that's
256600	260440	alright cause I know there's a lot of PC gamers who, um, are really into this graphics card.
260440	263800	For me, I just need something to play WoW on, but you all know about that addiction.
263800	267220	Here's what I really wanna ask about though, uh, I noticed you brought one of your Xboxes
267220	269480	with you tonight, I don't know if this is when you wanted to bring this up or not, but
269480	270480	I'm bringing it up.
270480	271480	Sure.
271480	273940	You gotta show the OP11 people, I know this isn't great for the podcast, but we can kinda
273940	278840	talk about this, you've got your Xbox modded, and I don't mean like the, you know, piracy
278840	280840	mods or whatever, I mean the other ones.
280840	285360	You have like a, you have like a glass thing on your Xbox, that's really cool.
285360	287960	What is this, where did you buy this, why did you do this, can you, can we show this
287960	288960	to the OP11 people?
288960	291120	Um, I have to plug it in for it to look good.
291120	292680	Oh, is it not plugged in?
292680	293680	It's not plugged in right now.
293680	294680	Oh, okay.
294680	295680	Remember you said not to plug to me.
295680	297440	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, alright, yeah, yeah, yeah.
297440	298760	You know, I can plug it in real quick.
298760	300520	Yeah, do it real quick, do it real quick.
300520	304040	Hopefully we don't blow a circuit and the, uh, show comes to a screeching halt, but if
304040	305700	we suddenly go off air, you know what happened.
305700	306700	We, uh.
306700	308400	Hey, if it explodes, it'll hit you guys first.
308400	309400	It's, exactly.
309400	315040	So, Jamie, maybe duck a little bit, uh, have Pyramid Head protect you with his blade while
315040	318440	we do this, and hopefully the folks on cam can see this.
318440	324240	Um, again, there's always, I, I think, I think the archives on OP11 are working again, so
324240	327880	you might be able to see this in the archives on OP11, but yeah, you turn it on, and it
327880	331080	glows blue inside, which I think is all kinds of awesome.
331080	335080	It looks like, it's like how a lot of people have modded their PC cases to do.
335080	336080	That's pretty rad.
336080	342040	Um, okay, I guess the folks in chat have seen enough of that, so, uh, what exactly, why,
342040	343040	why did you do that?
343040	344520	Was it just for the challenge, or what was it?
344520	349160	Let me, uh, Loki's not near a microphone.
349160	352240	Excellent live radio.
352240	357240	I understand ya.
357240	362180	So why exactly did you, um, decide to mod this and make it blue in there?
362180	363180	Because it's cool.
363180	367520	You just, you just wanted something the other kids didn't have, right?
367520	368520	Exactly.
368520	369520	Alright.
369520	372520	I just, um, I did it to, well, three of them so far.
372520	376040	I still have one more that I haven't done yet, because they're a bitch.
376040	379120	To be honest, though, it may look cool, but it sucks.
379120	380120	Why is that?
380120	386360	Um, the brand of clear case I bought, which I think it was like a ghost case or something
386360	389160	like that, uh, they suck.
389160	391200	They don't fit right.
391200	395560	So for example, you'll notice that one has still the old faceplate on it.
395560	397400	Well, there's a clear faceplate for it.
397400	400080	The problem is it jams DVD drive.
400080	403200	Now, Tigerclaw has a very good point in our chatroom.
403200	408160	Modding the 360 may be cool, but it also voids the warranty, so you just, you know, you don't
408160	410120	care about the warranty, you'll just take your chances.
410120	411880	Yeah, just like I did the other one.
411880	414040	That one was modded in the other way, so.
414040	415040	I see.
415040	416600	Alright, well, we'll get into that a little later.
416600	417600	Let's go around and check.
417600	420880	Well, and then, yeah, we'll also, we'll have, you know, the wonderful Christmas light effect
420880	425320	on there, since it's got the flashing green, er, three flashing lights on it.
425320	426320	It's awesome.
426320	427320	Alright.
427320	428320	The red rings of death.
428320	429320	Hooray!
429320	430320	Congratulations on that.
430320	434040	Uh, let's, let's go around and ask the question about our gaming weeks, because that's how
434040	437600	we're supposed to start off the show before we get into ooh and aah-ing over a blue 360.
437600	440120	Uh, Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
440120	443640	Um, I had a Christmas present last night.
443640	445240	I have Portal.
445240	446240	Sweet!
446240	450200	Yeah, and I knew that, I totally knew Dan got it for me, because I checked our online
450200	455540	banking, and I saw that, um, he had already told me how much it was used at his store,
455540	458920	and then I saw that much come out of the bank spent at GameCrazy.
458920	463880	And then, that day, I felt a game in my stocking.
463880	466400	I didn't take it out, but I knew what it was.
466400	471480	And so, last night, um, I went in there, um, and was just, uh, playing around with him,
471480	477800	and, uh, our friend, well, his friend Will was visiting, and we, uh, Dan said, oh, and
477800	482460	by the way, and took it out of my, uh, stocking, and I was like, hey, cool!
482460	487160	And then they were taunting me with it, and then I got it back, and so, uh, Dan, like,
487160	489480	was gonna play, like, a level.
489480	494040	He ended up playing, like, up to, uh, the Weighted Companion Cube level.
494040	495040	Nice.
495040	496040	It's addicting!
496040	497040	Yeah.
497040	499640	And, um, it was pretty funny.
499640	501600	He was, he was very silly.
501600	508080	And then, um, I, uh, played World Cup soccer pinball last night, because I hadn't played
508080	513520	any pinball in a week, and lots of Ragnarok.
513520	514520	And a little Olendan.
514520	515520	Very cool.
515520	520160	Hey, I gotta ask you, though, um, since, you know, you, you put on your investigative hat
520160	523840	to find out that your husband had bought you the, uh, orange box for Christmas, were you
523840	527560	the type of child that looked under the bed for what mom got you for Christmas, or what?
527560	532520	No, first of all, mom kept everything in the closet, and then, second of all, I, the only
532520	533520	reason...
533520	538920	I like how you know, you have to correct me, like, no, if I wanted to look at the presents,
538920	539920	I went to the closet.
539920	543440	Well, that's cause, that's where she kept them, cause my mom was not creative.
543440	550560	Um, but, I happened to be checking the online banking to see if my bonus got in, and that's
550560	551600	why I was looking.
551600	557720	And then I saw, forty-something dollars spent at Game Crazy, I'm like, oh, gee, who's been
557720	562560	the one talking about wanting orange box for Christmas, and there it was.
562560	567960	So that's when I, I got my investigative hat on when the clue presented itself.
567960	568960	Very nice.
568960	571800	Did I ever tell you the story about when I got my Super Nintendo when I was twelve?
571800	574080	I don't know if I've told the story on this program, actually I might have been eleven,
574080	578720	I don't remember, but I asked for that for Christmas, and that's all I really wanted,
578720	580320	was the Super Nintendo, right?
580320	584320	And so we opened up all the presents under the tree, and, you know, I saved the big,
584320	587960	big present for last, cause I, I kinda guessed that maybe it was the Super Nintendo I wanted
587960	589240	for Christmas, right?
589240	593120	And so I opened the very last present, and it's a San Francisco Giants jacket.
593120	594120	Ah!
594120	596760	And if you know me, you know I love sports.
596760	600040	So I was, like, crushed, and I was, like, about ready to cry, you know, I didn't, I
600040	602680	didn't want to cry cause I didn't want to look like a baby, but, you know, inside the
602680	605920	gamer nerd in me is, like, wanting to cry and sob and throw things, be the spoiled brat
605920	606920	I am, right?
606920	611680	Well then, finally, after everybody opens their present, presents, my sister comes to
611680	616680	me with one tiny, tiny, tiny little gift and says, there's one more thing, and on it was
616680	621560	written on an index card, um, a hint, and so I had to find where the next index card
621560	625000	was, and where the next card was, the next card, and finally about five times it took
625000	627640	me, like, out in the garage or something up in the rafters and that's where the Super
627640	628640	Nintendo was.
628640	629640	That's cool.
629640	633600	And so the moral of the story is I get what I want, cause I'm a spoiled brat.
633600	637180	And I got a Super Nintendo with Super Mario World, and then they bought one more game
637180	638180	for me, right?
638180	639680	You know what game they ended up getting for me?
639680	645140	A game called Drakken, which I don't think anybody ever played, but the reason, it was
645140	649360	based on an old PC game, and it wasn't bad, the sequel to it, which I believe was called
649360	653760	Dungeon View, Drakken 2, was awesome, but the first one was a little meh, cause it was
653760	657920	a role-playing game where you didn't really control your characters at all, you just kinda
657920	662000	hoped they would beat the monster in their own way, it was really odd, it was kinda neat
662000	666400	I guess in its own way, but the reason why they bought that, because the guy at Sears
666400	672280	told them it was a big seller, and I'm like, okay, to this day, nobody, like, fucking knows
672280	673280	Drakken.
673280	679960	I remember when we bought a PC from Sears a long time ago, or thinking about it, no,
679960	681880	that was crap.
681880	683880	Never buy PCs from them.
683880	686760	I'm looking at comments from chat, this is good.
686760	691400	Tiger Claw says Drakken was a 3D RPG, so I'm not the only one that knows what Drakken is,
691400	693920	I'm sure there's other listeners that go, I remember that game.
693920	698360	Amaze Satsuma, I like this, says, when I was younger, I wasn't only the type to hunt for
698360	703320	my Christmas, I also opened the game boxes and replaced the game inside with the game
703320	705960	I already own.
705960	707840	That's messed up.
707840	715120	Actually, another year, my mom went to Target and got all this stuff, and I was like, looking
715120	719160	in the bags, when she came back from Target, not like intentionally, I wasn't really hunting
719160	722000	around for Christmas presents, I was actually looking for candy, like, I wanted to see if
722000	726100	she bought candy, because I wanted candy, and I freaking saw a copy of Fester's Quest
726100	731140	on the NES in one of the bags, and I was like, oh, crap, but then I decided to screw with
731140	735120	my mom later, because we went to the video store and I wanted to rent a game, so I grabbed
735120	738240	the box for Fester's Quest, I'm like, let me rent this game, let me rent this game,
738240	742480	and my mom's like, no, you don't need to rent a game tonight.
742480	743480	I'm such a bastard.
743480	745720	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
745720	748120	It was okay.
748120	753800	Let's see, I played Saints Row again, more of that, and I played a little bit of Rock
753800	759880	Band last night, actually, that was pretty fun, played more of the drums for that, and
759880	768120	then, let's see, Burnout Paradise Demo, it's okay, I like it a lot better than some of
768120	772720	the other Burnout games, because you get to kind of free drive around the city and then
772720	777760	you start events, whatever, definitely don't recommend playing on a small TV, as we were
777760	783040	doing before the show, but it's pretty good otherwise.
783040	791360	I like the way the crashes look, I don't know, it's a little hard to see where the shortcuts
791360	796080	and stuff are in the game, but I guess that's why you gotta drive around more and stuff,
796080	800240	but I'll probably pick it up when it comes out in January, and then, let's see, other
800240	806440	than that, I think a little bit more Zelda Phantom Hourglass, pretty much done with that
806440	807440	game now.
807440	808440	Oh, very cool.
808440	816720	Would have been playing Crysis if my computer hadn't fucking sucked, stupid EVGA.
816720	820560	My gaming week, you know, kind of the usual stuff, been playing more World of Warcraft,
820560	823520	of course, Geometry Wars Galaxies, I've been getting a little further in, which I talked
823520	828960	about last week, fucking around with some of the stuff on the Wii, like Pokemon Snap,
828960	834080	awesome, you really can save pictures to the Wii message board, it kind of took me a little
834080	838480	bit to figure out how to do it, but basically if you have Pokemon Snap, you take the pictures,
838480	842820	by the way, Pokemon Snap doesn't control quite as nice as I remember it, like the controls
842820	845120	are kind of shitty, but the game itself is fun.
845120	848600	You know, you take the pictures of the Pokemon, right, and you can save your favorites to
848600	850200	this gallery.
850200	854960	If you back out all the way to the main menu and then go into gallery, you can look at
854960	860040	the pictures you took, but the Nintendo 64 kind of up-reses them from when you took them
860040	864480	in game to I guess the highest quality picture the Nintendo 64 could render.
864480	869360	When you're in that mode, you hit the minus key on your classic controller, and that is
869360	875080	what will post your picture to the Wii message board, and you can only post one a day, but
875080	878800	you can send the pictures, like I took a picture and I didn't know who to send it to, so I
878800	882520	sent it to Bobby Blackwolf because I thought he'd get a kick out of it, because something
882520	886080	told me Bobby's probably not a Pokemon Snap fan, so I took a dumb little picture of like
886080	889520	Pikachu or something and sent it to Bobby, so hopefully he got it.
889520	892520	I don't know, I didn't hear his show tonight to see if he said that he got any mail from
892520	894520	me, but we'll see.
894520	897760	I think that's a cute little feature, but you can only do that once a day, which is
897760	901560	kind of weird, but I'm assuming that must be the way the files are saved within the
901560	902560	Wii message board.
902560	905800	You don't want to fill up the hard drive with all these crappy Pokemon pictures, but that's
905800	906800	kind of cool.
906800	910880	Okay, VX JasonXVR, a webmaster, wants me to send the picture to him, so I will do that
910880	912680	a little later, absolutely.
912680	915020	And he's doing the Check Me Out channel.
915020	918400	Some other stuff I've looked at, I actually looked at this last week, but I forgot to
918400	919400	mention it on the show.
919400	924720	Xbox 360, a little demo came out for a game called Cultsep Saga, and the thing about Cultsep
924720	929760	is it was kind of like a cult game, if you will, on the PlayStation 2, where not a lot
929760	932840	of people had heard of it or played it, but it's a great game.
932840	939160	I love Cultsep on the PlayStation 2, and if you've read any reviews about this game, most
939160	941480	of the reviews on it are pretty accurate.
941480	946160	It's Monopoly meets Magic the Gathering, where you're moving around this board, and you're
946160	951320	trying to collect the most magical points, and you do that by laying these monsters down,
951320	954740	and when opponents land on the square where you've put down a monster, they can either
954740	958420	challenge the monster with one of their own monsters, or pay a toll, like, you know, you're
958420	961080	paying boardwalk, so they have to pay with some of their magic.
961080	966920	So that's basically the gist of the game, and I think it translated the 360 pretty nicely.
966920	971080	The only downside is that in playing, you know, obviously it's only the demo, I'm basing
971080	974820	my assumptions off the demo, but the demo appeared to be one of the exact same boards
974820	977860	from the PlayStation 2 version, I think the very first board, and it does look like there's
977860	982480	some more cards and things, but really it looks like all they've done on the 360 is
982480	987060	made it widescreen and up-resed everything to 720p, because when you're in the battles,
987060	991240	the cards do these cheesy little animations, like if you have a fighter attacking something,
991240	996520	a giant sword will swing and cut the card in half, or if you have these wolves attacking
996520	1002000	whatever, giant jaws will descend on the other card, it's so cheesy, and you'd think they
1002000	1005240	would have changed some of that for the Xbox 360, like maybe they could have had these
1005240	1009920	really cool cutscene battles with the cards, but they didn't do it for whatever reason,
1009920	1016240	so I imagine the biggest draw to this game is going to be the Xbox Live Play, which I
1016240	1018960	can't imagine this game doesn't have, I mean I don't know for sure if it's in there, but
1018960	1022880	I can't imagine it doesn't, because you weren't able to do that on the PlayStation 2 version,
1022880	1026640	but it's a fun game, I like that game a lot.
1026640	1030880	RossdielUT says, Skye, seriously, this even sounds boring.
1030880	1035760	It's not for somebody who likes a fast action paced game, but if something like Puzzle Quest
1035760	1040160	is more up your alley, or something you think before you make your moves and stuff like
1040160	1045880	that, it's fun, it's certainly not fast paced, so there you have it.
1045880	1050640	Speaking of card games, I just wanted to mention, I vaguely remember the amount, because it
1050640	1057400	wasn't that much, but a little update to the Eye of Judgment sales in the US, I think we
1057400	1064160	sold yet another 17,000 units last month, so we're up to a whopping 32,000-ish around
1064160	1065160	there.
1065160	1069240	So 32,000 Eye of Judgment units sold, and the goal is, again, 1 million for Loki to
1069240	1070560	wear the tingle suit here on the program.
1070560	1074680	Good luck with that, I don't think he'll sell 1 million, period.
1074680	1078920	One other quick assessment, a game I completely judged based off the demo alone, which I know
1078920	1081600	is a big no-no, but I'm just putting that out there in front.
1081600	1086800	That new arcade release this week on Xbox, Arcadian Warriors, is that what it's called?
1086800	1091240	It's kind of like Diablo, which is pretty rad, because I think a game like Diablo would
1091240	1095840	be rad on Xbox 360, but I couldn't help but feel like it was just a bit of button mashing,
1095840	1099160	and I don't know if that's just because Fighter is the only class you can play in the demo.
1099160	1106400	I love the idea of a quest RPG fantasy type of game on Xbox Live Arcade, but this didn't
1106400	1109840	make me go, oh, I've got to buy the full game.
1109840	1113240	I love the fact that when I was kind of first playing it, I was like, wow, this is kind
1113240	1116080	of like Diablo, but then as I was playing it more and more, I was like, wow, this is
1116080	1117520	kind of repetitive.
1117520	1123840	So I don't know, I wish a friend of mine had the full version so I could get a taste of
1123840	1126520	what some of the other classes play like, but unfortunately that's not the way it's
1126520	1127520	set up.
1127520	1128520	So there it is.
1128520	1131840	All right, well, that's it for our gaming weeks.
1131840	1134760	No special guests in the studio tonight, just the three of us.
1134760	1135760	And Harvey.
1135760	1136760	All right.
1136760	1137760	Who's Harvey?
1137760	1138760	He's the giant rabbit.
1138760	1139760	The giant rabbit?
1139760	1144360	Well, we have some of our, we have Pikachu and Kirby behind us and Cartman.
1144360	1145360	That's rude.
1145360	1148600	And the cleared up in chat room, yeah, the 32,000 was domestic sales.
1148600	1150200	I have no idea what it's selling worldwide.
1150200	1155160	I can guarantee, though, it's not anything over 100,000 units already, so.
1155160	1160160	I'm fairly confident that, you know, it's never going to sell a million units.
1160160	1165400	Ross Steel UT in chat says, kind of like Diablo equals kind of repetitive, am I right?
1165400	1166400	I don't know.
1166400	1170160	I didn't get that same feeling from Diablo, but I think a lot of the strength that Diablo
1170160	1174600	had was the multiplayer mode, and to be fair, I didn't get to try that mode out on this
1174600	1179000	demo yet, so maybe that's where this game shines is being able to do multiplayer.
1179000	1181920	That might make the game a hell of a lot more fun, so that's why I put that disclaimer out
1181920	1182920	there.
1182920	1184720	I'm completely basing my judgment of this game off the demo.
1184720	1187840	But then again, that's what a lot of Xbox users do, so if you're going to put a demo
1187840	1191920	out there, you know, make sure it sells everything the game's got in it, right?
1191920	1192920	Am I right?
1192920	1193920	Yeah.
1193920	1197000	In fact, I think I'm going to change the bet a little bit to make it a little bit more
1197000	1199520	fair for everybody.
1199520	1205280	If the game ever sells a million units, and this could be like five years from now, it'll
1205280	1206280	still happen.
1206280	1207280	Okay?
1207280	1208280	Wow.
1208280	1209280	Ever.
1209280	1212360	Loki's given a little on the bet and says if the game can ever sell a million, a million
1212360	1213420	worldwide even?
1213420	1214420	Million worldwide.
1214420	1215420	Alright, nice.
1215420	1220320	If the game can sell a million worldwide ever, then Loki will wear the Tingle Suit.
1220320	1224520	Watch one of our listeners win the lottery and buy 900,000 of them, just watch it.
1224520	1226640	So it might be like three years from now.
1226640	1230560	I hope we're still doing this show three years from now or, you know, that could happen like
1230560	1233760	in 30 years and Loki's, you know, getting old going, what do you mean I gotta wear this
1233760	1234760	suit?
1234760	1235760	Alright.
1235760	1236760	I have judgment.
1236760	1238760	I don't remember that game.
1238760	1240760	What the fuck?
1240760	1241760	Alright.
1241760	1248280	Let's get into some housekeeping tonight before we start tonight's news of the gaming type.
1248280	1249640	There is no show next week.
1249640	1250640	We're not gonna be here next week.
1250640	1255680	We're taking December 23rd off for the holidays because Dark Soccer, myself and Loki all have,
1255680	1257760	you know, family and friends stuff to attend to.
1257760	1259880	So we're not gonna be here on December the 23rd.
1259880	1264960	However, for those of you that listen live, it is my understanding there is a very special
1264960	1271080	OLR Christmas that's gonna happen thanks to some of our other OLR personalities, so stay
1271080	1272280	tuned for that.
1272280	1276520	That will not hit the podcast feed, but it will go up on our MySpace and our live journal
1276520	1279060	and Facebook and all the fan communities we have.
1279060	1283200	You will still be able to grab a recorded copy of whatever mischief happens on the station
1283200	1285660	next Sunday, which I'm sure is gonna be very interesting.
1285660	1290500	We will be back on December 30th for our year-end special, and more to come on the website.
1290500	1293000	About that, a little closer to the day.
1293000	1296240	Also, I need to wish one of our listeners.
1296240	1300280	Sephiroth1215 had a birthday yesterday, so I'm supposed to say happy birthday.
1300280	1302860	And I know he's been a longtime listener of the show and has come out and met him in New
1302860	1306740	York City on some of the OLR meetups and stuff, so happy birthday!
1306740	1307740	Happy birthday.
1307740	1308740	Thank your mother.
1308740	1309740	Thank your mother.
1309740	1310740	Yes.
1310740	1311740	For having you.
1311740	1312740	Yes.
1312740	1313740	For giving birth.
1313740	1314740	Good idea.
1314740	1315740	All right.
1315740	1316740	Anyways.
1316740	1317740	Gaming news time, yes?
1317740	1318740	Yes.
1318740	1319740	All right.
1319740	1320740	So starting the show off here.
1320740	1321740	Guitar Hero 3.
1321740	1325400	It's getting a brand new patch to fix a few things and add a couple things.
1325400	1332000	Some of the things that they're fixing, improving the online quick match results, and also adding
1332000	1335520	a calibration screen improvements, I guess.
1335520	1337240	So that's kinda cool.
1337240	1342520	And also, one of the things that they're adding for PlayStation 3 users, the co-op quick play
1342520	1343520	mode.
1343520	1348880	So, other than that, various other stability improvements and fixes.
1348880	1352440	I wish they'd add some new characters or something.
1352440	1353440	I don't know.
1353440	1354440	I don't know.
1354440	1359840	But, other than that also, there's also going to be a new download pack, and they've added
1359840	1366400	two different ones, one of which is from the Warner Reprise track pack, I guess.
1366400	1373320	And that's going to include Pretty Handsome Awkward by The Used, Sleeping Giant by Mastodon,
1373320	1375920	and No More Sorrow by Linkin Park.
1375920	1384320	Also, they have single download packs, including some, I guess, from popular European bands.
1384320	1395640	So Peyoso by Extremaduro, and Antisocial by Trust, and Erton Was We're Sayin' by Durf
1395640	1396640	and Fantisian Vere.
1396640	1397640	I don't know.
1397640	1399160	I probably butchered all that stuff.
1399160	1404920	And then, I guess, a free exclusive rock rendition of a holiday classic, We Three Kings by Steve
1404920	1405920	Oymette.
1405920	1408120	You know what's kind of funny, though?
1408120	1411400	I would have hoped that they would have had more Christmas songs and stuff, like get the
1411400	1416200	London Symphony Orchestra or something like that stuff in there, or the Trans-Siberian
1416200	1417200	Orchestra.
1417200	1418200	That has that.
1418200	1419200	Twisted Sister Christmas.
1419200	1420200	I like that idea.
1420200	1421200	Twisted Sister Christmas.
1421200	1424320	A friend of mine's been linking me to a lot of the songs on them because someone uploaded
1424320	1425320	them on YouTube.
1425320	1429080	But seriously, though, Trans-Siberian Orchestra, that would be perfect.
1429080	1430760	You can even do that as a free download pack.
1430760	1431760	I like free.
1431760	1432760	Free is good.
1432760	1433760	Especially for Christmas.
1433760	1434760	Come on.
1434760	1435760	Or the holidays.
1435760	1436760	Sorry.
1436760	1437760	We have to say the politically correct term.
1437760	1438760	The holidays.
1438760	1445800	Credit to Activision or Harmonix, I'm going to say Activision, for actually giving a free
1445800	1449720	song for Guitar Hero 3.
1449720	1454120	But the rest of those packs, of course, is going to be $6.25.
1454120	1455360	There you have it.
1455360	1458760	Now here's why I never wish listeners a happy birthday on the program, because of course
1458760	1463240	now we had someone else pipe up and Footy Monster says, it was my birthday last week
1463240	1465240	too.
1465240	1466600	Happy birthday, Footy Monster.
1466600	1471160	In fact, just so we don't get any more emails going, it was my birthday, it was my birthday,
1471160	1472280	and all that stuff.
1472280	1476680	If you had a birthday between December 9th and December 15th, which would have been last
1476680	1480640	week, or today, December 16th, happy birthday to you.
1480640	1483360	The rest of you, sit on it and wait for your turn.
1483360	1485080	Just to you a few.
1485080	1487160	Happy unbirthday to you.
1487160	1488680	All right.
1488680	1492960	Speaking of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, there's drama.
1492960	1497960	I mean, it's like these two are having some real drama, pillow fights and everything between
1497960	1498960	them.
1498960	1499960	But here it is.
1499960	1502560	You know how, of course, there's the compatibility issues with the guitar.
1502560	1506420	Well, what was supposed to happen is that Rock Band was going to get an update on the
1506420	1510800	PlayStation 3 so that the Guitar Hero 3 controller will work with it.
1510800	1516240	Well, it didn't happen, and Harmonix took to their forums to explain the reason why.
1516240	1520040	Two weeks ago, Harmonix created a software patch for the Sony PlayStation 3 version of
1520040	1525120	Rock Band that allowed for guitar compatibility and support for third-party peripherals, including
1525120	1529240	enabling use of Activision's Guitar Hero 3 controller with Rock Band.
1529240	1532520	The compatibility patch was submitted, approved, and had been scheduled for release by Sony
1532520	1534320	on Tuesday, December 4th.
1534320	1538200	Unfortunately, Activision objected to the compatibility patch's release.
1538200	1542680	The patch remains with Sony, but we have been told that it will unfortunately not be released
1542680	1545360	due to Activision's continued objection.
1545360	1547840	So, you know, boo Activision to doing that.
1547840	1554120	I'm sure they had their own reasons, money, motivating people to just go out and buy little
1554120	1555120	wine bitches.
1555120	1556120	I don't know.
1556120	1557120	I don't know.
1557120	1558120	That's kind of too bad.
1558120	1562160	Well, did you see the whole thing where Activision was blaming Harmonix for that, saying it's
1562160	1563160	their fault?
1563160	1564360	Because that's kind of stupid.
1564360	1565360	No.
1565360	1566360	What happened to that?
1566360	1567360	So, Activision followed up and said, no, it's Harmonix's fault.
1567360	1568360	It's their fault.
1568360	1569840	I don't even remember the reasoning why.
1569840	1572640	I'm like, well, why would they not do that?
1572640	1577000	Is it their fault because they left, you know, Activision to make a game with another company?
1577000	1578000	Is that why?
1578000	1579400	It's your fault that you left.
1579400	1584720	I mean, it's like getting caught in the middle of exes fighting, and that's never any fun.
1584720	1587800	Like, I don't know if you've been in that situation where you're caught in the middle
1587800	1591000	of these two exes, but that's what it feels like, and you know what?
1591000	1595440	We all lose when that happens, so boo to everybody involved for not being able to kiss and make
1595440	1596440	up.
1596440	1599580	There's a lot more whiny bitchery happening.
1599580	1605840	There is a class action lawsuit now going on against Activision for the whole mono sound
1605840	1609720	on the Wii edition of Guitar Hero 3.
1609720	1615840	They're saying that they willfully deceived the consumer with a statement that it had
1615840	1620400	Dolby Pro Logic 2 surround sound instead of mono.
1620400	1625160	There's a universe of difference between Dolby and mono.
1625160	1626160	So
1626160	1629280	It's a scam, but still, lawsuit?
1629280	1636400	Well, you know they've promised to put out replacement discs that have the sound issue
1636400	1638400	corrected?
1638400	1640720	Activision's not making any comment, though.
1640720	1646520	I don't think that they really, it's in their best interest to make a comment at this time.
1646520	1648360	Not while they're going through litigation.
1648360	1651960	Probably not, especially when they're trying to fix things, but I would think if anybody
1651960	1656040	wants to bring the smackdown on Activision, it ought to be Nintendo.
1656040	1658760	Not the consumer suing them in this whole thing.
1658760	1663280	I don't think the consumer is suing Nintendo, I think they're suing Activision.
1663280	1666940	Yeah, but I'm saying if anybody should put the smackdown on Activision, it ought to be
1666940	1672000	Nintendo, because Nintendo should go to Activision and go, you gave us a subpar version of the
1672000	1675520	game, then what you gave the other systems, naughty, naughty, naughty, you know, that
1675520	1676520	whole thing.
1676520	1678880	I wouldn't be surprised if they would do something too.
1678880	1681240	Everything's a subpar version on the Wii.
1681240	1682240	I guess that's true.
1682240	1683240	I disagree.
1683240	1687160	It's not just powerful, I mean in terms of graphics, so you have that whole thing as
1687160	1688160	well.
1688160	1691320	No, look at like, okay, look for example, Far Cry, Instincts on the Wii.
1691320	1692320	It was crap.
1692320	1695960	It had two player deathmatch, woohoo, two players.
1695960	1700900	Wow, you really pushed yourselves there, and you know, some of the other control issues
1700900	1706840	that they have, a lot of crappy ports of games, I'm looking at you Ubisoft, and I don't know,
1706840	1708280	overall they just don't care.
1708280	1711460	You see, the problem is also I think a lot of these people are used to putting out crappy
1711460	1716200	games without, you know, quality checking them very thoroughly because they can patch
1716200	1719840	them now on the PlayStation 3 and the, you know, Xbox 360.
1719840	1723280	I guess it's Nintendo's fault for not having a wonderful patch system so they can release
1723280	1725520	this crap and then fix it later.
1725520	1729560	Oh well, anyways.
1729560	1734320	One thing that's also going to need to be fixed is getting Rock Band to Canada.
1734320	1739200	Luckily though, they have confirmed now that Rock Band will be coming to Canada December
1739200	1740680	20th.
1740680	1746440	So a slight delay from, I don't know, November 20th, but at least you'll be able to play
1746440	1747640	it.
1747640	1748640	Hopefully you can find a copy.
1748640	1752740	Oh yeah, if you're waiting for the PlayStation 2 version in Canada, well they haven't really
1752740	1756160	confirmed on when that's coming too, so.
1756160	1759360	But seriously, why settle for Rock Band on the PlayStation 2?
1759360	1761920	Because with the amount you're going to pay for that, you really ought to just put that
1761920	1763520	down towards another console, right?
1763520	1764800	Am I right?
1764800	1766100	Well, here's the thing.
1766100	1771220	If you do buy it on PlayStation 2, at least if you do get a new console later that happens
1771220	1776760	to be PlayStation 3, you can use all the instruments from that on the PlayStation 3 version, because
1776760	1777760	they are identical.
1777760	1782320	Yeah, but then you have to buy a PlayStation 3, and I don't know if everybody wants to
1782320	1783320	do that.
1783320	1784320	Good point.
1784320	1785320	Alright.
1785320	1790560	Well, anyhow, moving on to other PlayStation 3 games, including one that I know a lot of
1790560	1795440	people are excited about, Metal Gear Solid 4 could be the game that definitely drives
1795440	1801040	sales of the PlayStation 3, and another little perk included in the game to further make
1801040	1802160	people want to buy this.
1802160	1806240	Remember an earlier story, which I think was blown out of proportion, but nevertheless
1806240	1810600	it was reported on previously that Metal Gear Solid was supposed to move a million units
1810600	1813120	in its first day in order to recover the cost or whatever?
1813120	1814400	It would need to, yeah.
1814400	1815400	Yeah.
1815400	1817800	Well, this could do it, because this is another inclusion that's pretty awesome, and this
1817800	1821160	came from PlayStation, the official magazine, and their latest issue.
1821160	1827560	They have confirmed that Metal Gear Online is going to be included, or at least, sorry,
1827560	1831520	there's going to be like a demo version of it, or some type of limited version of Metal
1831520	1836560	Gear Online included with Metal Gear Solid 4, Guns of the Patriots.
1836560	1841160	Actually, no, I take that back, it was originally going to be two separate games, and now it
1841160	1845000	looks like actually they are going to be coming together with one game.
1845000	1849600	And Metal Gear Online will have 16 player support, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, King
1849600	1853440	of the Hill, Team Sneak, could this be PlayStation 3's version of Halo 3?
1853440	1854440	Who knows?
1854440	1855440	Well, certainly not.
1855440	1856440	No.
1856440	1857960	Well, they're different types of games, of course, and you could say Unreal Tournament
1857960	1860600	is kind of their Halo, but, you know, kind of neat.
1860600	1865040	I don't know, though, that's just like saying Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops was its own
1865040	1867560	game, and then the online portion was another game.
1867560	1872040	It's still the same damn game, and the college is Metal Gear Online, so Metal Gear 4, the
1872040	1875020	online portion of it, I think it's stupid.
1875020	1877160	It's kind of deceiving the buyer.
1877160	1881560	I think here's where it comes from, why is this just a demo or is this a full game, is
1881560	1887280	because they are saying in the magazine, quote, expecting five maps in the starter pack that
1887280	1891520	will provide the basic setup to get your Metal Gear Solid multiplayer fix moving.
1891520	1896680	So is starter pack a fancy term for demo, or is starter pack something like a luminous
1896680	1900580	starter pack that you get on Xbox 360 Arcade, and then you have to buy all these freaking
1900580	1902920	add-ons to get more stuff for it?
1902920	1903920	Like the mad-ons.
1903920	1904920	Who knows?
1904920	1905920	That's true.
1905920	1910040	This is a little off topic, but it is talking about Konami, though.
1910040	1911040	All right, sure, why not?
1911040	1915200	I don't know if you noticed the first download pack for DDR Universe 2's up.
1915200	1919800	Yeah, I did actually notice that the other day, because I was poking around the marketplace,
1919800	1922840	because I myself was downloading the Burnout Paradise demo, I just haven't gotten a chance
1922840	1924640	to play it yet, and I did notice that.
1924640	1927520	I saw there were downloads for Universe 2.
1927520	1928960	Nothing I'm really excited about, though.
1928960	1933400	Well, because all the songs, from what I understand, are just crossing over from the Xbox series.
1933400	1934400	The original Xbox series.
1934400	1937400	I thought there was one I didn't recognize, but that's it.
1937400	1941360	Luckily, I can buy them separately, so I don't have to buy all the crappy ones.
1941360	1943880	But you get a discount if you buy all the crap together.
1943880	1945480	Nope, sorry.
1945480	1947800	I like how they try to trick you to do that kind of stuff.
1947800	1952000	Hey, if you buy ten bags of potatoes, you get them for a buck.
1952000	1957760	You know, ten for a dollar, really, there are ten for ten dollars.
1957760	1959520	Jamie, Loki's talking about potatoes.
1959520	1961120	Please save us.
1961120	1965840	How about some ass hattery from Sony?
1965840	1966840	Alright.
1966840	1975640	Well, the Sony CEO, Howard Stringer, is full of crap, because he's quoted as saying,
1975640	1980840	I'm happy the Wii seems to be running a bit short of hardware.
1980840	1986120	The PlayStation 3 will come into its own because its games are infinitely more fun, demanding,
1986120	1987120	and exciting.
1987120	1989400	Yeah, that's bullshit.
1989400	1992120	Wait, the Wii is short on hardware?
1992120	1997680	I mean, there's a variety of third-party things out there for the Wii.
1997680	1999640	Granted, most of them are shit.
1999640	2002760	Like I think about that little plastic golf club and stuff that you can get, the little
2002760	2003760	fake tennis racket.
2003760	2005600	But, you know, there's the Wii Zapper and stuff.
2005600	2008680	I mean, they're meaning the Wii itself.
2008680	2011960	So they're just saying, like, the Wii just isn't as fun as the PlayStation 3?
2011960	2012960	Pretty much.
2012960	2013960	I dispute that claim.
2013960	2017420	I've had a lot more fun playing games on Wii than on PS3.
2017420	2018480	The Wii is a lot of fun.
2018480	2024440	I mean, granted, you know, it's not that the PlayStation 3 is horrible, but right now it's
2024440	2025440	kind of close.
2025440	2030480	Well, they're thinking that they're going to sell more PlayStation 3s, but honestly,
2030480	2034960	we saw the stack at Best Buy, you know, and it's not just at that one.
2034960	2039400	It's at a multitude of stores that they're not moving the units.
2039400	2040600	People want a Wii.
2040600	2045580	He does understand that the reason there are no Wiis is because people want them so bad,
2045580	2050080	and so they keep selling out, whereas the PlayStation 3 doesn't have that problem because
2050080	2052040	they're not selling out.
2052040	2057840	I mean, I don't understand, and where does he get off saying, you know, that their games
2057840	2059500	are more fun?
2059500	2062360	Because if you like first-person shooters and broken games, that's awesome.
2062360	2065580	I see the PlayStation 3 has a lot of potential.
2065580	2066580	It does have potential.
2066580	2067840	It just hasn't done anything.
2067840	2070000	I watched that trailer for Final Fantasy 13.
2070000	2072440	There's a new one that came out this week and it looks fucking amazing.
2072440	2074000	It looks absolutely fucking amazing.
2074000	2078080	It's fucking amazing when it comes out Christmas 2009, but I'm not going to wait that long
2078080	2079080	for that shit.
2079080	2086360	And I am so all over a PlayStation 3 like, I don't know, like candy, like a fat kid on
2086360	2092640	candy, but that trailer is amazing, but for right now, there's not a lot that's making
2092640	2094360	me want to get a PlayStation 3.
2094360	2096840	If they had that at launch, we wouldn't be talking about that.
2096840	2098680	We'd be like saying, wow, look at the PlayStation 3.
2098680	2102800	It's selling millions and millions of units, and Final Fantasy 13 is fucking awesome.
2102800	2104400	I can play this all day long.
2104400	2108640	But no, it's just, the problem is it's not going to come out for a long time and we got
2108640	2113160	more stories talking about some of the other things that were promised to be out earlier,
2113160	2117520	you know, in 2008, but are probably not.
2117520	2123780	So well, just to illustrate a point, Dan says that he gets about maybe 50 calls a day for
2123780	2128880	people asking for a Wii, and I don't think he's mentioned anyone calling it at all for
2128880	2129880	a PS3.
2129880	2134200	RustyLUT in chat makes a good point, the Wii is selling on fat appeal.
2134200	2138160	Look for the shitty software sales for even the good games, right, Zack and Wiki?
2138160	2143320	Although granted, when you consider the Wii, now my thing is, the Wii is selling to families,
2143320	2148240	and so games like Zack and Wiki that might be good games for people who follow the gaming
2148240	2152800	scene and read game reviews, that doesn't quite catch mom's eye, but you know, games
2152800	2156700	based on movies and all that stuff, and Mario, like Super Mario Galaxy, that kind of shit
2156700	2157700	catches mom's eye.
2157700	2161560	And when Wii Fit comes out over here, it's going to start all over again.
2161560	2166920	I think he kind of has a point, the Wii does make a lot of its sales on fat appeal, but
2166920	2171760	I mean, that's money for Nintendo, and when this whole Wii Fit thing comes out, I'm going
2171760	2175740	to tell you, it's going to happen all over again, it's going to continue this fad craze
2175740	2181360	of the Wii until 2008, and I just hope it's a good game, and fun, and useful.
2181360	2184440	Who cares how they're selling systems, at least they're selling systems, you can't even
2184440	2189840	fucking pick a damn approach to how they're selling your systems, oh it's a PC, oh it's
2189840	2194500	a Blu-ray player, oh it's a game system, you can't fucking make your mind up.
2194500	2197320	So whatever, at least it's selling.
2197320	2199720	Alright, let's move on.
2199720	2203040	If we want to pay attention to these analysts and say, oh yeah, the PS3 is going to take
2203040	2207440	over in 2011, oh good for them, by that time the next system will be coming out.
2207440	2213400	Anyways, so the PSP got some pretty cool improvements with the new Japanese firmware, one of which
2213400	2218640	we're never going to see over here, but that's fine, it's a new DVR, but that's for their
2218640	2222000	TV service that they have, because they have the TV card.
2222000	2225720	The other thing though, which I hope we see over here, and hopefully we'll be able to
2225720	2229080	utilize, is internet radio.
2229080	2233800	You'll actually be able to tune in different channels, I think it's over Shoutcast actually,
2233800	2237720	yeah it is powered by Shoutcast, so that's kind of cool that they have that kind of support,
2237720	2243440	I know for a while there they had the Homebrew PSP radio that you could use and it looks
2243440	2248200	kind of similar, so, you know, we need to broadcast on Shoutcast.
2248200	2252160	I was going to say, OLRPSP.com I think needs an update badly, especially if that ends up
2252160	2253160	coming out over here.
2253160	2254160	We need people to be able to listen to OLR.
2254160	2256080	Well, we don't broadcast over Shoutcast though.
2256080	2260240	Well sort of, I think you can tap the live 365 feed into Shoutcast somehow.
2260240	2261240	No.
2261240	2262240	Can't you?
2262240	2263240	No.
2263240	2264240	Damn it!
2264240	2265240	I don't know how, at least.
2265240	2266240	Interesting.
2266240	2267240	If you could, that'd be awesome.
2267240	2270120	I'm going to have to do that, because I know we get emails once in a while from people,
2270120	2271120	right?
2271120	2272840	That say we listen on PSP, we listen on PSP.
2272840	2276200	If that stuff comes out over here, heck, even if it doesn't come out over here, I bet there's
2276200	2280520	got to be at least a handful of people that listen on their PSPs to this program in Japan.
2280520	2283200	We ought to be able to let them listen live on their PSPs.
2283200	2284200	Why not?
2284200	2285200	Why not?
2285200	2287120	Get on that, Loki!
2287120	2288120	Make it happen!
2288120	2290760	Oh, well let me just figure out how to broadcast on Shoutcast, that'd be awesome.
2290760	2292600	Hey, you do that homework assignment.
2292600	2295000	I've already tried doing that stuff.
2295000	2296080	I can't figure it out.
2296080	2297480	I'm too stupid.
2297480	2298960	Sorry to hear that.
2298960	2300280	Let's get to some release dates.
2300280	2303680	Speaking of our friends over in Japan, I've got the Japanese release dates for you coming
2303680	2306000	on the Xbox 360, December 20th.
2306000	2309640	FIFA 08 World Class Soccer comes out in Japan.
2309640	2312920	Moving on with the release dates, we also have a release of FIFA 08 on the PlayStation
2312920	2314000	3.
2314000	2317600	The GunCon makes its way to the PlayStation 3 separately, I assume.
2317600	2320960	Oh no, Time Crisis finally comes out in Japan as well.
2320960	2323100	It's a little later down my list here.
2323100	2327160	So Time Crisis 4 makes its way to the PlayStation 3 in Japan this week, also on the 20th.
2327160	2332240	Medal of Honor Airborne also makes its way from EA to the PlayStation 3 in Japan this
2332240	2333280	week.
2333280	2336440	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Crazy Climber Wii.
2336440	2339360	Remember we reported on this earlier a couple months ago.
2339360	2344440	They were remaking the classic 80s game Crazy Climber for the Wii.
2344440	2346760	Japan will finally get its first look at that this week.
2346760	2348360	And maybe we will soon, too.
2348360	2349360	Who knows?
2349360	2353840	Mr. Robinson's from Disney makes its way to the Japanese market December 20th with their
2353840	2355140	own game on the Wii.
2355140	2357080	Another port of FIFA 08 as well.
2357080	2364360	And SpongeBob SquarePants, Attack of the ToyBots, comes out as well from THQ on December 20th.
2364360	2367680	Cats with a Z2 and Dogs with a Z2.
2367680	2371480	If you thought this was the only country that got those shitty games with Zs on the end
2371480	2372960	They're not bad, actually.
2372960	2374300	Nintendo Wii, really?
2374300	2375480	They're not that bad.
2375480	2376480	Really?
2376480	2377480	Cats, too.
2377480	2378480	I want to hear about this.
2378480	2379480	I want to hear about this.
2379480	2384000	They're not awesome, but they're not horrible.
2384000	2386040	Cats 2 actually got a pretty decent review.
2386040	2390960	It's funny because they even have that stupid frog cat that you see on Caturday and stuff
2390960	2391960	like that.
2391960	2392960	They have that kind of stuff.
2392960	2396000	You literally can dress up your animals like that.
2396000	2397960	But then your cat will hate you.
2397960	2399360	Dark Deceus is right there.
2399360	2401720	Cats 2 equals frog cat.
2401720	2405560	It seriously does have the frog cat on there.
2405560	2410960	So it's stupid, but hey, over here, at least in the United States, it's only like 30 bucks.
2410960	2414520	So wait, find one to use for like 10 bucks or something like that.
2414520	2415520	There you go.
2415520	2418720	Or if you feel like paying twice as much, you could import the one from Japan.
2418720	2421400	I'd rather not because it's already out over here.
2421400	2424820	There's no point importing.
2424820	2429920	Moving on with other release dates, the PlayStation 2 is getting some releases as well.
2429920	2432720	Myself Yourself is a game that's coming out.
2432720	2436000	There's a limited edition of it as well on the 20th.
2436000	2439480	Another game called Pia Carrot y Yokoso, G.O.
2439480	2440560	Summer Fair.
2440560	2441560	Also has a limited edition.
2441560	2443760	Pia Carrot's old school too.
2443760	2445720	That's an old school anime, right?
2445720	2448080	The games have been out for quite a while.
2448080	2453240	Well, I guess it's another one coming out December 20th, just in time for Christmas
2453240	2455860	over in Japan.
2455860	2460280	Looking at a couple other games, I want to see if there's anything on the DS or PSP because
2460280	2463000	of course those are always crazy.
2463000	2465040	Port of Meet the Robinsons on the DS.
2465040	2467880	Doko Demo Pilates comes out.
2467880	2468880	That's not pirates.
2468880	2471600	That's Pilates comes out in Japan as well.
2471600	2472600	Dora Base.
2472600	2477480	Doraemon Chow Yaku Gaiden comes out from Namco on the Nintendo DS.
2477480	2480000	A puzzler called DS Puzzler.
2480000	2484760	Numpla DS Puzzler comes out as well on the Nintendo DS.
2484760	2486560	And I'm sure a lot of people are very excited about this.
2486560	2488960	This is one that folks might even be importing.
2488960	2493560	Final Fantasy IV, the remake, hits Japan this week on the Nintendo DS.
2493560	2497200	I'm sure that's going to be the best selling game of the week as far as the new stuffs
2497200	2498200	go.
2498200	2499680	I like the sound of this game though.
2499680	2502080	Pinky Street Kira Kira Music Night.
2502080	2503080	Ah, fun!
2503080	2505280	I actually have Pinky Street dolls.
2505280	2506880	Really?
2506880	2511080	What they are, they're these little plastic dolls and they're maybe about, I would want
2511080	2513320	to say like three inches tall.
2513320	2514320	They're smurf sized.
2514320	2521000	But anyway, no that's three apples high.
2521000	2523880	You can take off their heads and change them out and take off their hair and change them
2523880	2529560	out and it's like you snap them into place is how they work.
2529560	2534200	And so they're fully customizable and I guess it would be the same type of thing on the
2534200	2539200	game as you customize your Pinky and I've got like a few of them by now.
2539200	2545040	They even did Street Fighter and King of Fighters themed ones in Sakura Taisen.
2545040	2546760	So I've got a few of those.
2546760	2548280	Oh, very interesting.
2548280	2550280	Is there any interest in getting this game?
2550280	2551280	Importing it maybe?
2551280	2552280	No.
2552280	2553280	Alright.
2553280	2554280	After all that.
2554280	2555280	Alright, that's it for Japanese release.
2555280	2557160	That's all I'm going to cover on Japanese release dates.
2557160	2558160	Let's move on.
2558160	2562060	So is that like, you know, build a human type thing?
2562060	2563060	Not really.
2563060	2564060	I'll find a link for the chat room.
2564060	2565060	I have no idea.
2565060	2566960	Let's go over to Europe.
2566960	2568720	Only one game is on the list.
2568720	2569720	Yeah.
2569720	2571880	On the 19th Sensible World of Soccer.
2571880	2575960	Oh, coming out finally to the Xbox 360 Live Arcade.
2575960	2576960	That is it.
2576960	2579920	So I guess it's slowing down because it's Christmas time.
2579920	2580920	I guess so.
2580920	2581920	How about the US?
2581920	2585160	The US has got a few things, not as much as usual.
2585160	2587320	Anyways, a few things.
2587320	2596760	MX vs ATV Untamed coming out on PSP, Playstation 2, Xbox 360, and Playstation 3 and DS.
2596760	2600800	Elements of Destruction is coming out on DS and that game is kind of neat looking.
2600800	2607240	It's basically, you kind of play mother nature so you can cause tornadoes and fires and stuff.
2607240	2613400	It is also coming to Xbox Live Arcade at some point, so that's kind of neat.
2613400	2618240	And then let's see here, Warhammer 40,000 Squad Command on the DS.
2618240	2624800	Dyson Ryaku Exceed coming to the Playstation 2.
2624800	2632040	And let's see here, also the Playstation 2 of Rock Band, that game is coming out this
2632040	2633680	week as well.
2633680	2639200	So let's see here, Atari Classics Evolved for the PSP, another one of those compilation
2639200	2640200	sets.
2640200	2643720	Luxor 2 on the DS.
2643720	2650840	And Night's Journey of Dreams on the Wii, so you can get your night's fix here pretty
2650840	2651840	soon.
2651840	2652840	Jamie's applauding over there.
2652840	2654920	I'm getting my night's fix already.
2654920	2657640	Did you ask Santa for that for Christmas?
2657640	2662280	I'm probably going to get it, but we've been playing Christmas night.
2662280	2667440	And then one other thing I was going to mention here real quick, it's not a game but I thought
2667440	2669040	it's interesting anyways.
2669040	2672600	Mad Catz is putting out an HDMI conversion kit.
2672600	2677880	It actually, it's for all those people like me that do not have an Xbox 360 with HDMI
2677880	2678880	out.
2678880	2686360	It plugs into the back of your system and allows you to do HDMI and optical out as well.
2686360	2694960	Although the only sting to it is that it retails for $89.99.
2694960	2699600	Nintendo announced this week, obviously they're having some issues staying on top of manufacturing
2699600	2704040	enough Wiis for everybody out there, so this is their contingency plan they announced this
2704040	2705480	week.
2705480	2710240	Reggie Fils-Aime came out this week and said, hey, we're joining up with GameStop.
2710240	2713600	We're going to create this Wii rain check program.
2713600	2718580	Basically what happens is that if you pay GameStop $250, then you get a rain check that
2718580	2724520	promises you a Wii by January 29th, I believe was the day, the end of next month.
2724520	2730360	So this is for all those people who are having issues trying to get the Nintendo Wii at the
2730360	2731600	store or what have you.
2731600	2734840	And the reason why Nintendo wanted to partner up with GameStop is because GameStop really
2734840	2740720	already has it in their system to be able to take these type of deposits for games.
2740720	2742880	That's at least the reason why they did it.
2742880	2748460	The only days, however, that you can do this, December 20th and 21st are the only days that
2748460	2749840	you are going to be able to do this.
2749840	2754680	However, there are supposed to be tens of thousands of rain checks available and who
2754680	2759900	knows, that may still not be enough for the demand of the console because it's the Furby
2759900	2761220	of 2007.
2761220	2763340	It's the Cabbage Patch Kid.
2763340	2765320	That's the gift of this year.
2765320	2767200	I waited in line.
2767200	2768200	For a Wii?
2768200	2769200	For my Wii.
2769200	2770200	I know.
2770200	2772080	I made my roommate wait in line for mine and it worked.
2772080	2773080	Did very well.
2773080	2778840	See, it just goes to show that sometimes waiting in line for these things actually does pay
2778840	2779840	off.
2779840	2780840	Right.
2780840	2783240	But at the same time, how would you feel if you were one of those kids?
2783240	2784240	Let's flashback.
2784240	2787760	I told the story earlier in the show about me as the spoiled brat when I was a kid.
2787760	2792120	Let's flashback to me as the spoiled brat as a kid who wanted a Nintendo Wii this Christmas.
2792120	2794680	Now I open up my present to get one of these rain checks.
2794680	2799520	Am I going to be a satisfied kid or am I going to cry?
2799520	2802280	You're a bad parent if you give your kid a rain check.
2802280	2803280	Really?
2803280	2804280	Yeah, I think so.
2804280	2805280	I think it's an okay alternative.
2805280	2809240	I mean, the kids aren't going to understand at first, but at the same time, they're going
2809240	2810240	to get a Wii.
2810240	2813880	You don't need to wrap up a rain check because they don't fucking understand that.
2813880	2818200	You just say, listen, we couldn't get you one right now, but we will get you one by
2818200	2819200	the end of January.
2819200	2821640	You don't have to say, here's a fucking rain check for you.
2821640	2824680	I mean, that's just like, kids are like, what?
2824680	2826360	I don't understand this.
2826360	2827360	I'm not getting a Wii.
2827360	2828360	Where's the controller?
2828360	2829360	Where's Mario?
2829360	2830360	Santa hates me.
2830360	2837160	He's going to go take the rain check and soak it with his tears is what he's going to do.
2837160	2842920	Well you know what, in my family when I was a kid, if there was something that I wanted
2842920	2847960	and didn't get, I lived with it.
2847960	2852920	Or you get a job mowing lawns or selling lemonade and you save up and you buy the fucking thing
2852920	2853920	yourself.
2853920	2855420	Or I stole it from my brother.
2855420	2857520	That's exactly what you do.
2857520	2862640	The year you wanted your Super Nintendo and everything, my brothers went into Super Nintendo.
2862640	2865800	And my mom asked me, should I get them a Super Nintendo or a Genesis?
2865800	2869140	You need to get them a Super Nintendo and you need to get these games.
2869140	2872460	She got them a Super Scope, Zelda.
2872460	2874840	She picked out Home Alone for some retarded reason.
2874840	2876200	That game sucked ass.
2876200	2878200	Home Alone?
2878200	2881960	Kevin McCallister's so cute.
2881960	2885480	And so my brothers played like five seconds of Home Alone.
2885480	2888800	And I beat Zelda that week.
2888800	2891720	Did your brothers even play the Super Nintendo or was this your present?
2891720	2894240	They played Home Alone and they're like, what did I do bad?
2894240	2895240	Seriously?
2895240	2896600	Why am I being punished?
2896600	2905040	No, they actually, my brothers and I played a lot of Blastress and the mole thing.
2905040	2909120	I'm going to get Jamie a copy of Home Alone on the Super Nintendo for Christmas and wrap
2909120	2914160	it in coal and put it in her stocking.
2914160	2915960	That'd be great.
2915960	2920120	My little brothers were too busy running around being little terrorists in the neighborhood
2920120	2921760	so I had the Super Nintendo.
2921760	2923560	Comments from chat, love it.
2923560	2928840	SSJ100Matt says, dear little Billy, I owe you a wee, love Santa.
2928840	2931400	Tiger Claw, what if you lose the rain check?
2931400	2933120	Wouldn't you be screwed?
2933120	2937480	I don't know if you would be because GameStop sucks because they'd be like, oh, you don't
2937480	2938480	have your receipt.
2938480	2940760	Sorry, Billy, you ain't ever getting away.
2940760	2944920	I seem to recall I didn't have my receipt once for a $5 pre-order and they still gave
2944920	2947580	it to me because it was in the phone number.
2947580	2956200	Not only that, they actually keep a copy of your receipt in the store, a physical copy,
2956200	2957200	and they file them.
2957200	2958220	Yeah, see, I've done that before.
2958220	2959720	They lost my receipt in the store.
2959720	2963240	I had my receipt still and they gave it to them and showed them and stuff and they're
2963240	2972280	like, well, we can't find your receipt here, so I don't know what to do.
2972280	2976360	My mommy wrote me a note from Santa that said the elves couldn't find a copy of Hey You
2976360	2995280	Pikachu because the store was sold out and I would get it eventually.
2995280	3006480	Well, seriously, this is why I love the concept of gift cards, especially for me being picky
3006480	3007480	as a kid.
3007480	3009360	Again, if I got something I didn't want, I always took it back to the store myself, returned
3009360	3011800	it myself, and got what I wanted.
3011800	3014560	Actually, I was just thinking something there.
3014560	3019600	Nintendo's quite smart teaming up with GameStop with this whole rain check thing because if
3019600	3024360	for whatever reason Nintendo can't deliver those Wiiis by the end of January, people
3024360	3028200	are going to be fucking pissed off at GameStop, but no one's going to remember that it's Nintendo's
3028200	3029200	fault.
3029200	3032440	I want to hear more about 10-year-old Jamie marching into the store and returning your
3032440	3033440	gifts.
3033440	3044640	Well, it's like my family would buy me ugly clothes, so I would make them drop me off
3044640	3049440	at the mall and then I'd go do all my exchanges myself and sometimes I'd get cash back and
3049440	3057320	then go over to Babbage's because we had Babbage's before GameStop took them all over.
3057320	3059440	You know I'm not going to wear this.
3059440	3062920	I'm taking it back to get games instead.
3062920	3066720	Oh my god, shoes.
3066720	3072400	Or if they wouldn't, I would just get a different pair of jeans or something.
3072400	3078280	It wasn't that I was ungrateful or anything.
3078280	3080640	Or a sick bastard, as GS68 put it.
3080640	3084960	No, it wasn't that I was ungrateful or anything because I was plenty grateful for the stuff
3084960	3091880	that I got because when I was growing up, we didn't actually have a whole lot of money.
3091880	3096680	When I was in first and second grade, we were actually poverty level.
3096680	3104520	I remember having icicles in my bathtub one winter and I'm not even joking.
3104520	3114080	Now I think I'm really spoiled, but when I was a kid, if I got something, then if it
3114080	3118920	wasn't what I wanted, I found a way to turn it into what I wanted, so it was just a matter
3118920	3119920	of that.
3119920	3126400	All these kids who say, oh, but I want a Wii, well, tough shit.
3126400	3128160	There are no Wiis.
3128160	3129160	Get something else.
3129160	3130160	You'll live.
3130160	3136240	Get a job, Billy, Sam, I didn't buy you a Wii because you don't have a job.
3136240	3146720	No, but you see, I think that there's just way too much of, oh, well, you know, and Dan
3146720	3150200	is actually saying, and I'm not going to go into any detail on this, this person is saying,
3150200	3153200	oh, I spent all this money in your store and I'm entitled to a Wii.
3153200	3154640	Well, we don't have any.
3154640	3156760	Tough shit.
3156760	3162560	I think that people need to learn to be, I guess, to take no for an answer and find something
3162560	3163560	else.
3163560	3166940	You know, I can just imagine if Jamie had a kid, or maybe I would do this to my kid
3166940	3170540	and I wasn't able to get a Wii for my kid, I would leave a no under the tree for something
3170540	3171540	like this.
3171540	3172540	This isn't like this.
3172540	3175720	Santa is very sorry that he could not get you a Wii this year.
3175720	3180840	He has more important things to do, like ending genocide in Darfur, right?
3180840	3182440	He doesn't do any of that kind of crap.
3182440	3183440	He just delivers.
3183440	3186280	He's a fucking glorified UPS driver is what he is.
3186280	3191720	No, but seriously, though, all these people that think they need special treatment stuff
3191720	3196400	or finding Wiis and stuff like that, I get customers asking, you know, yeah, I have someone
3196400	3197400	looking for a Wii.
3197400	3200320	I'm like, you know, it's like two weeks before Christmas, why the fuck are they just now
3200320	3201320	looking for a Wii?
3201320	3202600	Why didn't they plan this out?
3202600	3205000	Oh, well, they didn't know it was going to be so hard to find.
3205000	3207320	Well, tough shit for them.
3207320	3210120	Why should we cater to the fact that they're stupid?
3210120	3211120	All right.
3211120	3213600	I'm sure we've got lots of holiday stories.
3213600	3215960	Maybe we'll get some of them in our mailbag later from our listeners.
3215960	3220320	I'm not trying to be, you know, all kinds of, you know, rawr on it.
3220320	3226720	It's just I get kind of irritated with people expecting too much, you know, thinking they're
3226720	3234040	entitled to something when really what you're entitled to is a roof and food.
3234040	3239360	Xenocore in chat says, the toughest retail store in the US, Jamie's Gaming Outlet.
3239360	3240360	You'll get it when it's here.
3240360	3241360	Now, get out of my store.
3241360	3244360	Dude, I would do that, too.
3244360	3247480	All right, let's move on with more news, Jamie.
3247480	3249440	What's the latest news at Jamie's Gaming Outlet?
3249440	3251920	Hey, virtual console stuff.
3251920	3260040	For our friends in the UK, we have Pokemon Snap that was on the Nintendo 64 and, you
3260040	3263360	know, Pokemon Snap is great and it's fun and lovely.
3263360	3267320	And then we have Top Hunter that was on Neo Geo.
3267320	3272600	Yeah, I didn't really like Top Hunter all that much, so I'm not going to talk about
3272600	3273600	it.
3273600	3278960	The last one, which is almost as cool as Pokemon Snap, but cooler in its own respect, is Mega
3278960	3286020	Man 2 from Nintendo Entertainment System.
3286020	3288720	And if you don't know what Mega Man 2 is, you need to climb out of that cave you've
3288720	3290160	been living in for the past 20 years.
3290160	3292680	Do they have Mega Man 1 on virtual console over there?
3292680	3293680	I don't know.
3293680	3294880	Or is Mega Man 2 the first game they're getting?
3294880	3296560	I think Mega Man 2 is the first.
3296560	3300160	Dude, I want both and I want Mega Man 3.
3300160	3302480	The first one was great.
3302480	3303480	It really was.
3303480	3304480	Mega Man weapon.
3304480	3308080	It was different than all the others, but it was great and it had some awesome music.
3308080	3311440	Some of my favorite music ever from a video game was like a Lekkman stage.
3311440	3317520	But I really liked the metal blades, though, in Mega Man 2.
3317520	3321560	But I totally loved Mega Man 3 because you had to beat the game with the top, with like
3321560	3323040	the most useless weapon.
3323040	3325600	Ah, RasteelUT has a good point, though.
3325600	3327720	Yeah, I already have Mega Man Collection.
3327720	3328980	Good point.
3328980	3332200	Why not just get the Mega Man Collection and do the backwards compatibility with the GameCube
3332200	3333200	disc?
3333200	3334200	Good thought.
3334200	3337040	F the Virtual Console for Mega Man, huh?
3337040	3338960	Yeah, F the Virtual Console.
3338960	3341560	Why should I have to buy games again?
3341560	3346400	Damn you, Nintendo, and trying to get me to purchase stuff I've already purchased again.
3346400	3347400	And it works.
3347400	3349640	Yeah, stupid Game Boy.
3349640	3354600	Anyways, one thing that we're going to be getting over here pretty soon, Dragon Quest
3354600	3355600	Swords.
3355600	3359360	It's been announced to come to the US on February 26th.
3359360	3361680	It has a really fucking long name.
3361680	3366320	Dragon Quest Swords, The Masked Queen, and The Tower of Mirrors.
3366320	3368320	Too long of a subtitle.
3368320	3370920	But it looks like a pretty fun game.
3370920	3376640	I have not yet played the Japanese version of it, but you used the Wiimote to slash at
3376640	3379120	slimes, so that can't be that bad.
3379120	3382680	Didn't they have that same thing on the PlayStation 2, I seem to recall?
3382680	3386640	Like, I remember going to some anime convention and in a back room they had a Dragon Quest
3386640	3389160	game, they had a giant sword, and you'd slash slimes.
3389160	3390160	I think, yeah.
3390160	3392760	Well, they had an arcade version of that.
3392760	3396240	They did have an arcade version, so maybe it's the same thing.
3396240	3397400	Kind of neat.
3397400	3400040	Perhaps, but I guess this is taking a while.
3400040	3403440	Wasn't this supposed to be a launch game and we're just now getting it?
3403440	3404880	Uh, yeah.
3404880	3407600	Along with the whole Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles?
3407600	3408600	What the F square?
3408600	3409600	Where the hell did your Wii games go?
3409600	3412440	Uh, Crystal Chronicles, I want to say, was like June now.
3412440	3414600	Geez, that was supposed to be a launch game.
3414600	3415600	Am I crazy?
3415600	3416600	No.
3416600	3417600	I thought it was.
3417600	3418600	No, wait.
3418600	3419600	No, no, I'm sorry, not June.
3419600	3420600	I'm just kidding.
3420600	3421600	But it's only the DS version.
3421600	3424000	They haven't announced the Wii version yet.
3424000	3425600	Crystal Chronicles was kind of underrated.
3425600	3426760	I really loved that game.
3426760	3429960	The only problem with it is that, god, you had to have a lot of shit in order to be able
3429960	3432480	to play that game, including four people.
3432480	3436920	Four Game Boy Advances and four Link Kables and everything.
3436920	3437920	Yeah, everything.
3437920	3441520	Alright, well, if you want a Wii to be playing the Dragon Quest game on, of course we've
3441520	3445060	been talking about that they're practically impossible to find, but one thing to keep
3445060	3450440	in mind is that the Nintendo World Store in New York City and Rockefeller Center, they
3450440	3454120	get more shipments of the Wii every morning.
3454120	3458200	Apparently a reporter from Game Daily visited the store recently and observed that there
3458200	3464000	were 20 Wiis lined up behind the main counter just waiting for whoever's in line, but what's
3464000	3468920	been going on is that more and more recently, WCBS Radio reported not that long ago that
3468920	3474600	there were over 200 people camped out outside the store before the store even opened, and
3474600	3479680	some folks are traveling all the way from Virginia to get a freaking Nintendo Wii.
3479680	3483160	Oh shit, that's a good way to do it if you know they're going to get some in every day.
3483160	3488720	Hey, if you don't get it the first day, go see some sites, come back and camp later.
3488720	3489720	What about your day job?
3489720	3492160	I don't know, is it just me?
3492160	3495960	Fuck that, getting a Wii for Billy is more important.
3495960	3497880	I digress, but never mind.
3497880	3500680	Let's move on with some more gaming news.
3500680	3511760	Well, more Wii stuff is the game Castle Shigigami 3 will be coming out to Nintendo Wii next
3511760	3513320	year.
3513320	3516560	It has a lot to do with dodging bullets.
3516560	3518440	It's bullet hell.
3518440	3519720	Yeah.
3519720	3521200	Yay!
3521200	3524320	Good for those fans of Ikaruga and stuff like that, of course I think you can get...
3524320	3528440	It's a very interesting shooter, and also you collect coins while you play.
3528440	3531560	I wonder how that's going to control the Wii, I wonder if it's going to be like Geometry
3531560	3534120	Wars where you point at the screen where you want to shoot, or if it's going to have
3534120	3535440	that kind of functionality in it.
3535440	3536440	I don't know, it doesn't...
3536440	3540440	Uh, I think you're probably thinking way too much into it, they'll probably have this...
3540440	3541440	No, seriously, seriously.
3541440	3546000	They'll probably just have the controller turned sideways and playing it like a virtual
3546000	3547000	console game.
3547000	3549000	Oh, yeah, I guess that'll work too, huh?
3549000	3552120	Yeah, because I mean, a lot of these games don't use the motion controls and stuff like
3552120	3553120	that.
3553120	3556000	It'd be too hard, especially with pinpoint stuff.
3556000	3557000	Well that works.
3557000	3563480	Anyways, so, there's another game coming to the Wii, this is kind of interesting actually.
3563480	3567920	I laughed when I saw it, because even though there's a game that's just like it that's
3567920	3569980	already been announced, we don't know when that's coming out.
3569980	3574600	This game though, however, is coming out, I want to say in March.
3574600	3579920	Anyways, the game is called Wild Earth, African Safari.
3579920	3584520	Oh great, now the Wii's getting on the Africa craze as well.
3584520	3585520	Yes.
3585520	3586520	Wonderful.
3586520	3589700	Wild Earth, Africa, Safari.
3589700	3593000	Very similar to Africa, and it's...
3593000	3594200	How can you say that?
3594200	3596880	We don't know anything about Africa.
3596880	3601240	They are similar in the regards they are both about Africa.
3601240	3604600	Africa is a giant fucking place, I don't know if you are aware.
3604600	3610680	Hey, I will have you know that there's photography in this game, much like Africa.
3610680	3615120	There are animals just like Africa, they both take place in Africa.
3615120	3619320	If anything else, I would say this is more authentic, because they spelled Africa correctly.
3619320	3621560	Okay, so, whatever.
3621560	3627160	Anyways, Safari Photo Africa Wild Earth is a PC game, I guess it got released a while
3627160	3632920	ago and took home some awards in the 2003 Independent Games Festival, including the
3632920	3639040	coveted Sumas McNally Grand Prize, whatever the fuck that's supposed to mean.
3639040	3644720	Anyways, this game takes place, you are a photojournalist exploring Africa's Serengeti
3644720	3650960	National Park, tasked with taking photos of 30 different animals in their natural habitat.
3650960	3654880	And apparently if you get close to the animals for the perfect shot, or if you get too close,
3654880	3659160	the Wii remote will rumble, making it harder to snap the picture.
3659160	3665760	And the Wii version will include co-op multiplayer, one player to drive, while the other two shoot
3665760	3666760	photos.
3666760	3671600	Unfortunately, we can't run over the animals with the jeep, at least I don't think you
3671600	3672600	can.
3672600	3673600	Boring.
3673600	3676640	The only way I'm going to play any of these games is if I can run over the animals.
3676640	3677640	I don't get it.
3677640	3679160	Jamie, what the hell's going on here?
3679160	3684160	We're getting Africa on the Playstation 3, this Safari game on the Wii, yet still no
3684160	3686000	Jumbo Safari.
3686000	3687440	What the hell is wrong with this world?
3687440	3692920	Well, you know, we have no Jumbo Safari, but we also have no Planet Harrier.
3692920	3694960	Hi!
3694960	3700620	It's all those games that came out around that time, we have, you know, if Sega would
3700620	3706400	give us a dedicated platform, a dedicated system, then we would have all this awesome,
3706400	3707400	but no!
3707400	3708600	OMG, Dreamcast 2.
3708600	3709600	I wish!
3709600	3710600	Jumbo Safari packet game.
3710600	3713840	Well, wasn't Jumbo Safari, like, kind of a gun game almost?
3713840	3714840	Sort of.
3714840	3715840	Yeah, it was.
3715840	3716840	Well, it's like a harpoon thing.
3716840	3717840	No, you lassoed him.
3717840	3718840	It's a harpoon.
3718840	3719840	Harpoon.
3719840	3720840	Har-poo.
3720840	3721840	Har-poo.
3721840	3725480	Frisbee calls it Pokemon Snafrica.
3725480	3727360	There you go.
3727360	3731800	The only bad thing about this thing, and, you know, no offense to Majesco, but Majesco's
3731800	3736680	putting it out, and, I mean, seriously, what was the last good game for Majesco to come
3736680	3737680	out?
3737680	3743000	I'll give you a hint, there's one game that they put out in the Wii that I remember, and
3743000	3747760	that was at, oh, fuck, what was it called?
3747760	3751640	Bust a Move Bash or whatever, you know, it was a puzzle game, you can't really innovate
3751640	3756800	that much, but let me put it this way, the screenshots don't show much detail.
3756800	3758320	But there's a dead wildebeest.
3758320	3762360	I want to know why I can't run these things over with my car.
3762360	3765360	I'm going to be able to do that in Far Cry 2, so that's, at least I have that to look
3765360	3766360	forward to.
3766360	3769760	Alright, well, earlier in the show we were talking about GameStop and one of their latest
3769760	3770760	adventures with Nintendo.
3770760	3775220	Well, that's not the only adventure GameStop has announced that they're going on this week.
3775220	3779560	They are going to start creating tournament centers.
3779560	3784360	What this is, is it's something that's in addition to a standard retail store, and the
3784360	3789040	kiosks where you play the games on, instead of there just being one, there's a ton of
3789040	3790040	them.
3790040	3793440	Now, they're opening one of these in San Jose, and gosh, part of me kind of wants to go down
3793440	3796040	and check it out, maybe do a report for the show because it's not that far, and I go there
3796040	3797040	a lot.
3797040	3801880	But anyhow, apparently these places are going to have 24 networked gaming stations.
3801880	3805540	They're all going to have plasma display on it, and they're supposed to be doing various
3805540	3807980	competitions in these places.
3807980	3810580	Most weekends are when they're supposed to be doing it.
3810580	3813260	They're going to kick it off with a Madden tournament.
3813260	3818640	And the winner of the Madden tournament gets a $1,000 GameStop shopping spree, which they
3818640	3821640	could spend right there in the store.
3821640	3824820	I can't see how this is going to make them any money.
3824820	3829840	Is this like their idea of countering a LAN center, and that way of putting it on them?
3829840	3834140	Well, here's the thing, I don't know if they're going to be countering LAN centers, but one
3834140	3839560	of their competition chains that's kind of up and coming, they're starting to do this
3839560	3843360	play-and-trade is really, I think they're starting to take notes of that, and their
3843360	3847040	big thing is that they run tournaments, and they organize them nationwide and stuff like
3847040	3850340	that, and they run tournaments in the store a lot.
3850340	3851800	So they may be trying to compete with that.
3851800	3856440	But here's the thing, I don't understand how they're going to make any money from this.
3856440	3861560	I mean, really, I just, I don't know.
3861560	3864920	I mean, they're going to have all these TVs set up, unless they're charging people to
3864920	3866720	play on this stuff, like running out time.
3866720	3868600	Well, I imagine they have to be.
3868600	3874740	You pay a $20, $30 entry fee, and if you get 50 people to enter it, there's a $1,000 prize
3874740	3876880	right there, and anything additional is just extra money.
3876880	3880360	And with a game like Madden that's so competitive, I don't know.
3880360	3885400	It's going to be tough, though, because I know those other places, they don't charge
3885400	3886400	for tournaments and stuff.
3886400	3890000	Okay, plus, you get all those gamers in one place, and then what are you going to do?
3890000	3894200	You're going to put out a table full of Madden merchandise out there for them to buy, right?
3894200	3898600	Like, I can think of DDR tournaments I went to where Red Octane would come in and they
3898600	3902040	would have a table, because this was back before Red Octane was big for Guitar Hero.
3902040	3906820	They would come and they would sell dance pads and soundtracks and all the DDR crap
3906820	3911440	there at the tournament, and that's how they made money.
3911440	3914760	It's really a good idea, I mean, honestly.
3914760	3915760	But I don't know.
3915760	3917920	It's like selling t-shirts at a concert.
3917920	3919920	Yeah, I suppose.
3919920	3924240	Also, GS68, they've seen one at the Santa Más at the Stevens Creek GameStop.
3924240	3928920	I've shopped there before, by the way, that's actually right next to my Grand Princess.
3928920	3933760	But I don't know.
3933760	3937360	The only reason why is I know a lot of people that own land centers, and they own places
3937360	3942160	like this where they rent out time, and hell, we knew, was it Rina, they used to have something
3942160	3943200	similar like this.
3943200	3947840	It's very hard to make money from them, and I know it may be tied in with GameStop, and
3947840	3951560	you run any tournaments and stuff, but I don't think it's going to work out for them.
3951560	3954400	I really don't think that they're going to make enough money to make it worth their wild,
3954400	3961480	so I mean, they're testing it, but we'll just see if it actually ends up working out for
3961480	3962480	them.
3962480	3963480	I don't think it will be.
3963480	3964480	We'll see.
3964480	3965480	We'll see.
3965480	3967080	All right, well, let's move on with some more gaming news.
3967080	3969600	If we have any listeners in San Jose that have happened to check this place out, let
3969600	3970600	us know.
3970600	3973240	If not, I'll try to make it a point to go by there in the near future.
3973240	3974240	We'll see.
3974240	3979200	There are some details released about Tomb Raider Underworld that's being developed by
3979200	3981600	Crystal Dynamics.
3981600	3993040	It should be out next year on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC, and is going to be...
3993040	4001120	They were actually quoted in Play Magazine as saying it was pure woman versus wild.
4001120	4008040	I'm really, I don't know, because I think there's way too many Tomb Raider games already,
4008040	4012680	but I did think, though, that it is pretty cool that they have a new lighting model for
4012680	4015560	what will be going on in the game.
4015560	4018800	I think it's pretty cool that they're...
4018800	4024420	I like the more technical side of it, so I would check it out just to at least look at
4024420	4027320	something online to see how it turns out.
4027320	4032680	Well, Tomb Raider is one of those series that just won't die, and this is for us to approve
4032680	4035360	it.
4035360	4036360	Here's another series.
4036360	4041280	Well, I don't know if it's going to be a series, but maybe a game that should die.
4041280	4045080	The Prince's Bride game, which doesn't look all that wonderful.
4045080	4049920	I mean, it looks like, to be honest, like a CDI game.
4049920	4056840	Anyways, according to a new G4 interview, they've gotten some information direct from
4056840	4058600	the developer's mouths.
4058600	4066640	Apparently, well, the game itself, the target demographic, I believe, was women for it.
4066640	4070000	They said that they're not going to be using a lot of the voice actors.
4070000	4073560	It's actually going to be sound-alikes for the voices.
4073560	4083360	And of course, they're saying that the game's going to be out spring of 2008 on PC.
4083360	4086960	And if you like, you can pre-order it at the official site, princessbridegame.com.
4086960	4090720	Oh, the game doesn't look that good.
4090720	4091720	I looked at that picture.
4091720	4093760	It does look like a CDI game.
4093760	4099160	I mean, they'd have to use sound-alikes anyway, at least for some of them, because, you know,
4099160	4101800	Andre the Giant's dead.
4101800	4104720	So you should make him talk anyways.
4104720	4110200	Splice clips together, like that one show after Chef left the show, right?
4110200	4111200	Never mind.
4111200	4117800	Anyhow, we're going to debut a brand new segment on tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
4117800	4121880	And I can't say this is necessarily going to be a weekly segment, but it is going to
4121880	4126600	be a segment that we're going to do on the show whenever something makes us feel like
4126600	4128560	we need to do this segment.
4128560	4129780	It's not a new game.
4129780	4133960	It's not a new advice column or anything like that.
4133960	4142680	So, it is something we call here at Orange Lounge Radio the Stupid Award.
4142680	4143680	That's right.
4143680	4147580	Whenever we here at Orange Lounge Radio feel like somebody has done something extraordinarily
4147580	4155920	stupid this week in the gaming industry, we're going to award them with the OLR Stupid Award.
4155920	4161080	So this week, the Stupid Award goes to this kid, and I'm probably going to mispronounce
4161080	4162080	his name, but that's okay.
4162080	4163080	He's stupid.
4163080	4165440	He's going to be playing Aliyu Shaw.
4165440	4166440	And what did he do?
4166440	4173560	Well, he went on to Xbox Live and he was playing Call of Duty 4, and he sent messages to kids
4173560	4174560	on Xbox Live.
4174560	4178880	He was playing Call of Duty 4, and he told them that he was going to shoot up his school
4178880	4181560	and tell everybody on there how he was going to do it.
4181560	4187120	Well, sure enough, a Call of Duty 4 player from Oregon went to the police department
4187120	4193680	and Microsoft ended up letting out the IP who tracked down this guy and arrested him.
4193680	4198040	Now, the kid later admitted that the whole thing was just a joke, he had no intention
4198040	4203840	of actually going through with it, there were no guns to be found or whatever, but still,
4203840	4209080	why would you say this kind of crap on Xbox Live, especially in this day and age in the
4209080	4210080	world we live in.
4210080	4217760	So, congratulations, Aliyu Shaw, winner of the inaugural OLR Stupid Award!
4217760	4218760	Yay!
4218760	4225600	That's right, out of the gene pool.
4225600	4226600	Get out.
4226600	4228360	Let's get a little bleach in there.
4228360	4234880	All right, let's move on to a segment that we've done for a while now and it's a well-loved
4234880	4236440	segment here at Orange Lounge Radio.
4236440	4243160	It is the Classic Game of the Week and every week DarkSakura picks a favorite classic game
4243160	4248040	of hers and we basically pay tribute to our elders and respect them a little bit through
4248040	4253000	our Classic Game of the Week, so DarkSakura, tell us about what game you picked out for
4253000	4255000	us this week.
4255000	4262160	The Game of the Week is the X-Men arcade game, the old one you could find either one screen
4262160	4269520	or two screens, I do believe that the differences were a four-player and a six-player.
4269520	4274440	I played the hell out of this game when I was in tenth grade.
4274440	4280120	My arcade actually had a two-screen set-up, so I used to play a whole crap-let of this,
4280120	4288080	but it was put out by Konami and it's the final fight-style game, you know, the side-scrolling
4288080	4292560	beat-crap-up game, you know, or like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games, even though a lot
4292560	4294400	of these were floating around that time.
4294400	4299720	But you could play as Cyclops, Colossus, Wolverine, Storm, Nightcrawler, or Gavlar, and I actually
4299720	4302680	use Gavlar almost all the time.
4302680	4306320	And you beat up the world's shortest sentinels, because they were really supposed to be massive,
4306320	4308920	but they were like, little.
4308920	4315840	And it had the most, I swear, this would have all been candidates for everse.com, the things
4315840	4318160	that they would say in the game.
4318160	4326600	Now, I didn't realize this for quite a while, but the version that I played at one of the,
4326600	4331440	not my main arcade, but the second arcade, was actually a Japanese version, because they
4331440	4337280	would drop extra power-ups that would refuel the power meter, and apparently the American
4337280	4338760	ones did not.
4338760	4340960	So I was like, this is hard!
4340960	4344080	It was too easy.
4344080	4349000	So it was full of crap.
4349000	4356080	I mean, it was a really fun game, and I wish that there had been, you know, a home release
4356080	4361400	without me having to bust out the maze, but it was a lot of fun.
4361400	4363400	Alright, well, some comments from Chatroom.
4363400	4368560	Tigerclaw wants to remind us, this was also the only X-Men game released by Konami, hence
4368560	4370880	why it feels so much like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
4370880	4375200	That's why I was saying that it was in that type.
4375200	4378080	Now, ActDeft sounds like he has the best arcade ever.
4378080	4382240	He says, my arcade used to have this, TMNT Arcade, and Turtles in Time.
4382240	4388280	Turtles in Time was freaking great, but this was my game before Turtles in Time.
4388280	4392280	However, Dillinger would like to share that the Simpsons arcade game was better.
4392280	4393480	I doubt that.
4393480	4394920	Simpsons did it.
4394920	4397560	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
4397560	4400960	I actually really liked this one a whole lot better.
4400960	4405240	Alright, so there it is, your classic game of the week, X-Men, as done by the arcade,
4405240	4408080	and I'm just pausing our little YouTubage of the game here.
4408080	4410940	Bonus, you are granted a special mutant power.
4410940	4415980	Note that mutant power can be used only when the energy indicator is at three or less.
4415980	4417680	Is that like now a second mutation?
4417680	4418680	I don't know.
4418680	4420400	For anyone who reads the comics.
4420400	4421400	I don't know.
4421400	4424800	Anyhow, that's going to bring this part A of our program to a close.
4424800	4428920	We're going to take a quick break and we will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio
4428920	4429920	right after this.
4429920	4434880	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice
4434880	4435880	a week.
4435880	4459320	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
