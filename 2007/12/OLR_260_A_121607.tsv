14031	25986	Tonight, December 16th, 2007, internet radio hits the PSP in one part of the world, Mass Effect and Assassin's Creed boast big sales, and how would you feel about a wee rain check under the tree this Christmas?
31667	35608	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35628	41449	We are that program on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41489	42589	My name is Rob Roberts.
42689	46650	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
46890	47190	Yo.
47530	48250	How you doing, Ms.
48290	48590	Summers?
51070	51470	Long day?
51610	52130	Long weekend?
53431	53791	I don't know.
54791	55771	I'm thinking about it still.
55791	57011	I'm making a decision.
57351	57611	A decision?
57631	60132	But I can't do it without being fully informed.
62235	64236	You should always be fully informed when making a decision
91578	92258	How are you doing, Loki?
92799	93959	I'm okay, I guess.
94319	94900	Okay, I guess.
95860	96901	Feeling a little ripped off.
97521	97921	What happened?
99202	107345	Well, just a company I've been buying stuff for my new computer with, EVGA, and I bought my motherboard and my graphics card from them.
108686	116550	Literally the day after I bought my graphics card, NVIDIA went and redesigned it, made it cheaper, faster, and better.
117570	118271	So that sucks.
118851	120972	And then the motherboard that I bought
122139	126483	I can't tell what's wrong since there's no beeps nor indication of what's wrong.
148280	153804	and I'm looking at the motherboard that they sell on EVGA's site and there's stuff missing off mine.
154805	161110	Like, I don't know, a PCI Express slot that's supposed to be there that's not and some other shit.
161210	164092	So, they're going to get an angry call tomorrow.
165123	165763	Sorry to hear that.
165883	168204	And now you just talked smack about them on your internet show.
168264	169224	So that's just lovely.
169244	171105	Now they're feeling hurt.
171345	176046	Our always present fourth guest here on the program, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, our chat room.
176086	177627	We always tape live on Sunday nights.
177667	181368	I know there's a lot of folks that listen to us in our taped form on the podcast.
182308	186209	But, of course, listening live is a whole other element where you get to do interactivity.
187870	189070	Question from AZHP.
189230	190410	Which graphics card was it?
191071	191491	It's an 8800 GTS.
193186	194027	That means nothing to me.
194067	195048	I have no idea what that's about.
195068	195788	It's an NVIDIA card.
195808	202694	They redesigned the GT, which made it a little bit faster using the 65 nanometer chips.
202874	206637	And now they did the same thing with the 8800 GTSs.
206998	209039	So, for example, I paid for my card.
209620	210401	It was like...
212042	212742	Let's see here.
212862	214123	I think it was about $364.99.
215283	215923	Wow.
216283	220204	Yeah, well, that's quite a bit for a card.
220484	224025	Well, here's the best part, though, because, see, now I can get an even faster card.
224105	228287	I want to save for about $100 cheaper, which is annoying.
228707	236909	I mean, it'll have slightly less graphics memory because I had 640 megs of RAM on there.
237389	238110	But let's see here.
238150	239410	The one now, the GTS...
241387	244430	It'd be 512 megs of RAM.
244530	246692	Okay, well, it's not that cheaper, I guess.
246792	249335	It's $359.99, but still.
250216	252699	It's a little bit cheaper, and it's even faster.
252819	256383	All right, geez, suddenly we're turning into the PC graphics card podcast.
256403	260407	But that's all right, because I know there's a lot of PC gamers who are really into this graphics card.
260427	263350	For me, I just need something to play WoW on, but you all know about that addiction.
263670	265190	Here's what I really want to ask about, though.
265931	267651	I noticed you brought one of your Xboxes with you tonight.
267671	270032	I don't know if this is when you wanted to bring this up or not, but I'm bringing it up.
270552	271992	You've got to show the Op11 people.
272092	274493	I know this isn't great for the podcast, but we can kind of talk about this.
274853	279215	You've got your Xbox modded, and I don't mean like the piracy mods or whatever.
279335	280275	No, that's the other one.
280775	284816	You have like a glass thing on your Xbox that's really cool.
285276	285696	What is this?
285716	286357	Where did you buy this?
286397	287037	Why did you do this?
287397	289057	Can we show this to the Op11 people?
289377	291038	I had to plug it in for it to look good.
291678	292498	Oh, is it not plugged in?
292598	293519	It's not plugged in right now.
293579	293819	Oh, okay.
294059	295540	Remember you said not to plug to me.
295860	296480	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
296540	297581	All right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
297661	298822	I can plug it in real quick.
298902	299542	Yeah, do it real quick.
299682	300142	Do it real quick.
300442	303904	Hopefully we don't blow a circuit and the show comes to a screeching halt.
303924	305625	But if we suddenly go off air, you know what happened.
305665	308146	Hey, if it explodes, it'll hit you guys first.
308886	309367	Exactly.
309427	311208	So, Jamie, maybe duck a little bit.
312108	315650	Have Pyramid Head protect you with his blade while we do this.
316370	317951	And hopefully the folks on cam can see this.
319342	321844	It's protected by the power of awesome.
321924	325667	I think the archives in Op 11 are working again, so you might be able to see this in the archives in Op 11.
326207	330751	But yeah, you turn it on, and it glows blue inside, which I think is all kinds of awesome.
331591	334473	It's like how a lot of people have modded their PC cases to do.
334934	335894	That's pretty rad.
337496	339417	Okay, I guess the folks in chat have seen enough of that.
341118	342699	Why did you do that?
342740	344221	Was it just for the challenge, or what was it?
346182	347423	Loki's not near a microphone.
349096	349897	Excellent live radio.
354720	355301	I understand you.
357202	361366	So why exactly did you decide to mod this and make it blue in there?
361986	362747	Because it's cool.
364148	366169	You just wanted something the other kids didn't have, right?
368211	368691	Exactly.
370193	372374	I did it to, well, three of them so far.
373875	375737	I still have one more that I haven't done yet because they're a bitch.
376017	378319	To be honest though, it may look cool, but it sucks.
379020	379620	Why is that?
381421	388544	The brand of clear case I bought, which I think it was like a ghost case or something like that, they suck.
389124	390184	They don't fit right.
391165	395246	So, for example, you'll notice that one has still the old faceplate on it.
395786	397327	Well, there's a clear faceplate for it.
397367	399168	The problem is it jams the DVD drive.
401109	402969	Now, Tigerclaw has a very good point in our chatroom.
402989	406010	Modding the 360 may be cool, but it also voids the warranty.
406090	407571	So, you just, you know,
407998	409859	You don't care about the warranty, you'll just take your chances?
410479	411740	Yeah, just like I did the other one.
412120	413741	That one was modded in the other way.
414161	414441	I see.
415001	416462	Alright, well we'll get into that a little later.
416542	418042	Let's go around and check.
418102	424825	Also, we'll have the wonderful Christmas light effect on there since it's got three flashing lights on it.
425626	427026	It's awesome.
427046	427867	The red rings of death.
428167	428807	Hooray!
428927	429928	Congratulations on that.
431175	437317	Let's go around and ask the question about our gaming weeks because that's how we're supposed to start off the show before we get into ooh and aahing over a blue 360.
438317	439517	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
440838	442658	I had a Christmas present last night.
443799	444839	I have Portal.
445699	446119	Sweet!
446759	459183	Yeah, and I totally knew Dan got it for me because I checked our online banking and I saw that he had already told me how much it was used at his store and then I saw that much come out of the bank spent at GameCrazy and then
460411	463352	That day I felt a game in my stocking.
463973	465673	I didn't take it out, but I knew what it was.
466334	471196	And so last night I went in there and was just playing around with him.
471376	474617	And his friend Will was visiting.
474737	480400	And Dan said, oh, and by the way, and took it out of my stocking.
480500	481860	And I was like, hey, cool.
482400	483641	And then they were taunting me with it.
483661	484521	And then I got it back.
484561	488623	And so Dan was going to play like a level.
489460	493844	He ended up playing up to the Weighted Companion Cube level.
494524	494745	Nice.
495345	495946	It's addicting.
496266	496546	Yeah.
497407	499509	And it was pretty funny.
499609	500930	He was very silly.
501510	509477	And then I played World Cup Soccer Pinball last night because I hadn't played any pinball in a week.
510558	511659	And lots of Ragnarok.
513481	514502	And a little Elendon.
515683	516103	Very cool.
516360	527166	Hey, I gotta ask you though, since you put on your investigative hat to find out that your husband had bought you the orange box for Christmas, were you the type of child that looked under the bed for what mom got you for Christmas, or what?
527506	536551	No, first of all, mom kept everything in the closet, and then second of all, the only reason... I like how you know, you have to correct me.
536872	539873	Like, no, if I wanted to look at the presents, I went to the closet.
539893	542875	Well, that's because that's where she kept them because my mom is not creative.
543696	549337	Um, but I happened to be checking the online banking to see if my bonus got in.
550238	551478	And that's why I was looking.
551558	555139	And then I saw 40-something dollars spent at GameCrazy.
555159	560200	I'm like, oh, gee, who's been the one talking about wanting Orange Box for Christmas?
560460	561400	And there it was.
562521	566321	So that's when I got my investigative hat on when the clue presented itself.
567822	568242	Very nice.
568826	571448	Did I ever tell you the story about when I got my Super Nintendo when I was 12?
571828	573289	I don't know if I've told the story on this program.
573349	574089	Actually, I might have been 11.
574129	574609	I don't remember.
575230	579912	But I asked for that for Christmas, and that's all I really wanted was a Super Nintendo, right?
580273	588758	And so we opened up all the presents under the tree, and I saved the big, big present for last because I kind of guessed that maybe it was the Super Nintendo I wanted for Christmas, right?
589218	592940	And so I opened the very last present, and it's a San Francisco Giants jacket.
593915	596136	And if you know me, you know I love sports.
596696	597936	So I was like crushed.
598076	599597	I was like about ready to cry.
599637	601617	I didn't want to cry because I didn't want to look like a baby.
601657	605038	But inside the gamer nerd in me is like wanting to cry and sob and throw things.
605278	606558	Be the spoiled brat I am, right?
607179	615681	Well, then finally after everybody opens their presents, my sister comes to me with one tiny, tiny, tiny little gift and says there's one more thing.
616021	619322	And on it was written on an index card a hint.
619841	619981	Drakken
641852	643773	which I don't think anybody ever played.
643833	644954	I've heard of it.
645014	647316	It was based on an old PC game, and it wasn't bad.
647416	651899	The sequel to it, which I believe was called Dungeon View, Drakken 2, was awesome.
651919	656742	But the first one was a little meh, because it was a role-playing game where you didn't really control your characters at all.
656922	660525	You just kind of hoped they would beat the monster in their own way.
660545	661366	It was really odd.
661386	663007	It was kind of neat, I guess, in its own way.
663447	667610	But the reason why they bought that, because the guy at Sears told them it was a big seller.
668260	668901	And I'm like, okay.
668961	669402	Liar!
669602	673028	To this day, nobody fucking knows Drakken.
675151	677896	I remember when we bought a PC from Sears a long time ago.
678116	679078	Or thinking about it.
679258	679458	No.
679779	681001	That was crap.
681762	682864	Never buy PCs from them.
684296	685537	I'm looking at comments from chat.
685577	686057	This is good.
686697	688998	Tiger Claw says, Drakken was a 3D RPG.
689038	691378	So I'm not the only one that knows what Drakken is.
691398	693279	I'm sure there's other listeners that go, I remember that game.
693899	699041	Amaze Satsuma, I like this, says, When I was younger, I wasn't only the type to hunt for my Christmas.
699401	704042	I also opened the game boxes and replaced the game inside with the game I already own.
705783	706703	That's messed up.
708664	709564	Actually, another year.
710510	717317	I, uh, I, my mom went to Target and got all this stuff, and I was, like, looking in the bags when she came back from Target.
717657	721381	Not, like, intentionally, I wasn't really hunting around for Christmas presents, I was actually looking for candy.
721461	723443	Like, I wanted to see if she bought candy, because I wanted candy.
723996	729459	and I freaking saw a copy of Fester's Quest on the NES in one of the bags and I was like, oh crap.
729959	740325	But then I decided to screw with my mom later because we went to the video store and I wanted to rent a game so I grabbed the box for Fester's Quest and I'm like, let me rent this game, let me rent this game and my mom's like, no, you don't need to rent a game tonight.
742626	743286	I'm such a bastard.
743386	745227	All right, Loki, how was your game week?
746308	747488	It was okay.
747989	752591	Let's see, I played Saints Row again, more of that and I played
753274	755275	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
783049	784310	I like the way the crashes look.
785351	787072	I don't know.
787672	794917	It's a little hard to see where the shortcuts and stuff are in the game, but I guess that's why you gotta drive around more and stuff.
795958	797799	But I'll probably pick it up when it comes out in January.
798579	805004	And then, let's see, other than that, I think a little bit more Zelda Phantom Hourglass.
805024	806685	I'm pretty much done with that game now.
808206	808566	Very cool.
809315	810416	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
828895	829275	Awesome.
830316	833178	You really can save pictures to the Wii message board.
833238	835199	It kind of took me a little bit to figure out how to do it.
835579	838261	But basically, if you have Pokemon Snap, you take the pictures.
838281	842144	Which, by the way, Pokemon Snap doesn't control quite as nice as I remember it.
842184	843505	Like, the controls are kind of shitty.
843825	844745	But the game itself is fun.
845086	846907	You know, you take the pictures of the Pokemon, right?
846947	849548	And you can save your favorites to this gallery.
850189	855993	If you back out all the way to the main menu and then go into gallery, you can look at the pictures you took.
856073	857414	But the Nintendo 64, kind of like...
858394	863839	up-rezes them from when you took them in-game to, I guess, the highest quality picture that Nintendo 64 could render.
864339	872886	When you're in that mode, you hit the minus key on your classic controller, and that is what will post your picture to the Wii message board.
873146	874567	And you can only post one a day.
874948	876469	But you can send the pictures.
876569	881513	I took a picture, and I didn't know who to send it to, so I sent it to Bobby Blackwolf because I thought he'd get a kick out of it.
881837	883337	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
907752	910294	VX, JasonXVR, Webmaster wants me to send the picture to him.
910334	911315	So I will do that a little later.
911475	911915	Absolutely.
912576	914517	And he's doing the Check Me Out channel.
914938	916499	Some other stuff I've looked at.
916879	919261	I actually looked at this last week, but I forgot to mention it on the show.
919401	922604	Xbox 360, a little demo came out for a game called Cold Step Saga.
923644	930969	And the thing about Cold Step is it was kind of like a cult game, if you will, on the PlayStation 2, where not a lot of people had heard of it or played it.
931429	932810	But it's a great game.
932950	934511	I love Cold Step on the PlayStation 2.
935111	941355	And if you've read any reviews about this game, it's probably... Most of the reviews on it are pretty accurate.
941415	942576	It's Monopoly meets...
943056	948278	Magic the Gathering, where you're moving around this board and you're trying to collect the most magical points.
948658	950938	And you do that by laying these monsters down.
951278	957760	And when opponents land on the square where you've put down a monster, they can either challenge the monster with one of their own monsters or pay a toll.
958020	960661	Like, you know, you're paying boardwalk, so they have to pay with some of their magic.
961041	963482	So that's basically the gist of the game.
963622	966142	And I think it translated the 360 pretty nicely.
966883	967843	The only downside...
968803	976905	is that in playing, you know, obviously it's only the demo, I'm basing my assumptions off the demo, but the demo appeared to be one of the exact same boards from the PlayStation 2 version, I think the very first board.
977226	984788	And it does look like there's some more cards and things, but really it looks like all they've done on the 360 is made it widescreen and up-res'd everything to 720p.
985808	986328	Thanks for watching!
1008362	1009083	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1030808	1033329	It's not for somebody who likes a fast, action-paced game.
1033629	1041751	But if something like Puzzle Quest is more up your alley or something you think before you make your moves and stuff like that, it's fun.
1041811	1043172	It's certainly not fast-paced.
1045252	1045753	There you have it.
1045813	1055756	Speaking of card games, I just wanted to mention, I vaguely remember the amount because it wasn't that much, but a little update to the Eye of Judgment sales in the U.S.
1055796	1056256	Oh, lordy.
1057057	1064262	I think we sold yet another 17,000 units last month, so we're up to a whopping 32,000-ish around there.
1064562	1070487	So 32,000 Eye of Judgment units sold, and the goal is, again, 1 million for Loki to wear the Tingle suit here on the program.
1070527	1071087	Good luck with that.
1071147	1073229	I don't think he'll sell 1 million, period.
1074629	1075190	One other quick...
1075774	1076714	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1105823	1106143	and Harvey.
1136091	1136591	Who's Harvey?
1137111	1138232	He's the giant rabbit.
1138372	1139092	The giant rabbit?
1139152	1143893	Well, we have Pikachu and Kirby behind us and Cartman.
1144233	1145774	And the clear it up in chat room.
1145814	1148395	Yeah, the 32,000 was domestic sales.
1148675	1150135	I have no idea what it's selling worldwide.
1150155	1153876	I can guarantee, though, it's not anything over 100,000 units already.
1155196	1158817	I'm fairly confident that it's never going to sell a million units.
1160218	1163959	Rossdale UT in chat says, Kind of like Diablo equals kind of repetitive.
1164039	1164499	Am I right?
1165429	1165769	I don't know.
1166490	1171553	I didn't get that same feeling from Diablo, but I think a lot of the strength that Diablo had was the multiplayer mode.
1171853	1178538	And to be fair, I didn't get to try that mode out on this demo yet, so maybe that's where this game shines, is being able to do multiplayer.
1178858	1180439	That might make the game a hell of a lot more fun.
1180479	1182060	So that's why I put that disclaimer out there.
1182100	1184322	I'm completely basing my judgment of this game off the demo.
1184622	1186983	But then again, that's what a lot of Xbox users do.
1187003	1191626	So if you're going to put a demo out there, make sure it sells everything the game's got in it, right?
1192006	1192627	Am I right?
1192647	1192727	Yeah.
1193038	1194280	Thank you for watching!
1205200	1206480	It'll still happen, okay?
1207021	1208301	Wow, okay.
1208561	1213102	Loki's given a little on the bet and says if the game can ever sell a million, a million worldwide even?
1213122	1214463	A million worldwide.
1214483	1215103	All right, nice.
1215183	1220145	If the game can sell a million worldwide ever, then Loki will wear the Tingle suit.
1220205	1222725	Watch one of our listeners win the lottery and buy 900,000 of them.
1222805	1223286	Just watch it.
1224486	1225946	So it might be like three years from now.
1226747	1233929	I hope we're still doing this show three years from now or, you know, that could happen like in 30 years and Loki's, you know, getting old going, what do you mean I gotta wear this suit?
1234508	1236793	Alright.
1236954	1237735	I have Judgment.
1237755	1238818	I don't remember that game.
1239519	1240121	The fuck?
1241343	1241604	Alright.
1242826	1247448	Let's get into some housekeeping tonight before we start tonight's news of the gaming type.
1248188	1249568	There is no show next week.
1249588	1250449	We're not going to be here next week.
1250469	1257391	We're taking December 23rd off for the holidays because DarkSakura, myself, and Loki all have family and friends stuff to attend to.
1257711	1259452	So we're not going to be here on December 23rd.
1259512	1268775	However, for those of you that listen live, it is my understanding there is a very special OLR Christmas that's going to happen thanks to some of our...
1269295	1270816	and other OLR personalities.
1270856	1271757	So stay tuned for that.
1272158	1278703	That will not hit the podcast feed, but it will go up on our MySpace and our LiveJournal and Facebook and all the fan communities we have.
1279024	1285369	You will still be able to grab a recorded copy of whatever mischief happens on the station next Sunday, which I'm sure is going to be very interesting.
1285649	1289833	We will be back on December 30th for our year-end special and more to come on the website.
1290333	1292215	About that, a little closer to the day.
1294264	1294524	Guitar Hero 3
1321363	1324585	It's getting a brand new patch to fix a few things and add a couple things.
1325305	1334990	Some of the things that they're fixing, improving the online quick match results and also adding a calibration screen improvements, I guess.
1335470	1336211	So that's kind of cool.
1337051	1342754	And also one of the things that they're adding for like PlayStation 3 users, the co-op quick play mode.
1343935	1348577	So other than that, various other stability improvements and fixes.
1350333	1352194	I wish they'd add some new characters or something.
1352514	1352835	I don't know.
1353355	1353655	I don't know.
1354476	1357858	But, other than that, there's also going to be a new download pack.
1359038	1360780	And they've added two different ones.
1361600	1366183	One of which is from the Warner Reprise track pack, I guess.
1366343	1375389	And that's going to include Pretty Handsome Awkward by The Used, Sleeping Giant by Mastodon, and No More Sorrow by Linkin Park.
1376429	1378711	Also, they have single download packs.
1379501	1406655	including some, I guess it's from popular European bands, So Peoso by Extremodoro, and Antisocial by Trust, and Ernton Was We're Saying by Der Fentigen Veer, I don't know, I probably butchered all that stuff, and then I guess a free exclusive rock rendition of a holiday classic, We Three Kings by Steve Oyment.
1407168	1408049	No, it's kind of funny, though.
1408329	1411031	I would have hoped that they would have had more Christmas songs and stuff.
1411051	1413533	Like, get the London Symphony Orchestra or something like that.
1413553	1414394	There's stuff in there.
1414814	1415255	You know what?
1415315	1416696	Or the Trans-Siberian Orchestra.
1416756	1418177	Twisted Sister Christmas.
1418858	1419618	I like that idea.
1419698	1420859	Twisted Sister Christmas.
1420879	1425063	A friend of mine's been linking me a lot of the songs on them because someone uploaded them on YouTube.
1425283	1425964	Yeah, but seriously, though.
1426024	1427645	Trans-Siberian Orchestra.
1428005	1428826	I mean, that would be perfect.
1429026	1430728	You can even do that as a free download pack.
1430788	1431248	I like free.
1432008	1435129	Free is good, especially for Christmas, come on, or the holidays.
1435289	1438950	Sorry, we have to say the politically correct term, the holidays.
1439050	1449232	Credit to Activision or Harmonix, I'm going to say Activision, for actually giving a free song for Guitar Hero 3.
1449512	1452352	But, hey, the rest of those packs, of course, is going to be $6.25.
1453533	1454573	Alright, there you have it.
1455340	1463506	Now, here's why I never wish listeners a happy birthday on the program, because of course now we had someone else pipe up and FootyMonster says, it was my birthday last week too.
1465047	1466548	Happy birthday, FootyMonster.
1466628	1471751	In fact, just so we don't get any more emails going, it was my birthday, it was my birthday, and all that stuff.
1472272	1479897	If you had a birthday between December 9th and December 15th, which would have been last week, or today, December 16th, happy birthday to you.
1480637	1483039	The rest of you, sit on it and wait for your turn.
1483119	1484160	Best to you, if you...
1484895	1486076	Happy unbirthday to you.
1486876	1487157	All right.
1488638	1493101	Speaking of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, there's drama.
1493241	1498044	I mean, it's like these two are having some real drama, pillow fights and everything between them.
1498485	1499525	But here it is.
1499665	1502387	You know how, of course, there's the compatibility issues with the guitar.
1502467	1510213	Well, what was supposed to happen is that Rock Band was going to get an update on the PlayStation 3 so that the Guitar Hero 3 controller will work with it.
1510916	1515498	Well, it didn't happen, and Harmonix took to their forums to explain the reason why.
1515618	1528364	Quote, Two weeks ago, Harmonix created a software patch for the Sony PlayStation 3 version of Rock Band that allowed for guitar compatibility and support for third-party peripherals, including enabling use of Activision's Guitar Hero 3 controller with Rock Band.
1529204	1533685	The compatibility patch was submitted, approved, and has been scheduled for release by Sony on Tuesday, December 4th.
1534125	1537746	Unfortunately, Activision objected to the compatibility patch's release.
1538146	1545248	The patch remains with Sony, but we have been told that it will unfortunately not be released due to Activision's continued objection.
1545328	1547829	So, you know, boo Activision to doing that.
1547849	1549309	I'm sure they have their own reasons.
1550490	1550750	Money.
1551890	1553951	Motivating people to just go out and buy.
1554431	1555011	I don't know.
1555231	1555551	I don't know.
1557076	1557777	That's kind of too bad.
1578456	1579356	It's your fault that you left.
1609538	1619509	They're saying that they willfully deceived the consumer with a statement that it had Dolby ProLogic 2 surround sound instead of mono.
1620250	1623394	There's a universe of difference between Dolby and mono.
1625656	1627839	I understand, but still, lawsuit?
1629300	1629601	Well...
1630704	1636888	You know they've promised to put out replacement discs that have the sound issue corrected.
1637989	1639930	Activision's not making any comment, though.
1640791	1644713	I don't think that they really, it's in their best interest to make a comment at this time.
1646474	1648155	Not while they're going through litigation.
1648195	1650157	Probably not, especially when they're trying to fix things.
1650217	1655280	But I would think if anybody wants to bring the smackdown on Activision, it ought to be Nintendo.
1656215	1658756	Not the consumer suing them in this whole thing.
1658856	1661356	I don't think the consumer is suing Nintendo.
1661376	1663437	I think they're suing Activision.
1664117	1667697	Yeah, but I'm saying if anybody should put the smackdown on Activision, it ought to be Nintendo.
1667998	1673799	Because Nintendo should go to Activision and go, you gave us a subpar version of the game than what you gave the other systems.
1674179	1675119	Naughty, naughty, naughty.
1675199	1675959	You know, that whole thing.
1676039	1678080	I wouldn't be surprised if they would do something too.
1678600	1681420	Everything's a subpar version on the Wii.
1681560	1682241	I guess that's true.
1682261	1682741	I disagree.
1682881	1683981	They're not as powerful.
1684591	1686031	I mean, in terms of graphics.
1686051	1687092	So you have that whole thing as well.
1687112	1691173	No, look at, like, okay, look, for example, Far Cry Instincts on the Wii.
1691313	1692133	It was crap.
1692453	1694074	That two-player deathmatch.
1694254	1694774	Woo-hoo!
1694834	1695534	Two players.
1696275	1698115	Wow, you really pushed yourselves there.
1698755	1701496	And, you know, some of the other control issues that they have.
1701536	1703197	A lot of crappy ports of games.
1703217	1704477	I'm looking at you, Ubisoft.
1705197	1707858	And, I don't know, overall, they just don't care.
1708238	1713880	You see, the problem is also I think a lot of these people are used to putting out crappy games without, you know, quality checking them very...
1714790	1715510	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1745393	1746496	At least you'll be able to play it.
1747377	1748600	Hopefully you can find a copy.
1749021	1755475	Oh yeah, if you're waiting for the PlayStation 2 version in Canada, well, they haven't really confirmed on when that's coming too.
1756107	1758569	But seriously, why settle for Rock Band on the PlayStation 2?
1759149	1763372	Because with the amount you're going to pay for that, you really ought to just put that down towards another console, right?
1763952	1764412	Am I right?
1764772	1765813	Well, here's the thing.
1766093	1777520	If you do buy it on PlayStation 2, at least if you do get a new console later that happens to be PlayStation 3, you can use all the instruments from that on the PlayStation 3 version because they are identical.
1778921	1782884	Yeah, but then you have to buy a PlayStation 3, and I don't know if everybody wants to do that.
1783384	1783804	Good point.
1784925	1785225	All right.
1786294	1791475	Well, anyhow, moving on to other PlayStation 3 games, including one that I know a lot of people are excited about.
1791535	1796517	Metal Gear Solid 4 could be the game that definitely drives sales of the PlayStation 3.
1797137	1802058	And another little perk included in the game to further make people want to buy this.
1802098	1813142	Remember an earlier story, which I think was blown out of proportion, but nevertheless, it was reported on previously that Metal Gear Solid was supposed to move a million units in its first day in order to recover the cost or whatever.
1813162	1814002	It would need to, yeah.
1814142	1814322	Yeah.
1814522	1816123	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1837918	1838599	No, I take that back.
1838679	1844563	It was originally going to be two separate games, and now it looks like actually they are going to be coming together with one game.
1844903	1850768	And Metal Gear Online will have 16-player support, deathmatch, team deathmatch, King of the Hill, team sneak.
1851048	1852889	Could this be PlayStation 3's version of Halo 3?
1853750	1854130	Who knows?
1854210	1854751	Well, certainly not.
1854811	1856612	Well, there are different types of games, of course.
1856973	1860455	You could say Unreal Tournament is kind of their Halo, but, you know, kind of neat.
1860695	1861176	I don't know, though.
1861196	1866760	That's just like seeing Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops was its own game, and then the online portion was another game.
1867458	1868701	It's still the same damn game.
1868801	1874314	And the college is Metal Gear Online, so Metal Gear 4, the online portion of it, I think it's stupid.
1874955	1876800	It's kind of deceiving the buyer.
1877236	1891138	I think here's where it comes from, why is this just a demo or is this a full game, is because they are saying in the magazine, quote, expecting five maps in the starter pack that will provide the basic setup to get your Metal Gear Solid multiplayer fix moving.
1891478	1902120	So is starter pack a fancy term for demo, or is starter pack something like a luminous starter pack that you get on Xbox 360 Arcade, and then you have to buy all these freaking add-ons to get more stuff for it?
1902620	1903641	They like them add-ons.
1904001	1904541	That's true.
1905121	1905561	So who knows?
1906181	1906261	Um...
1907321	1907861	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1933365	1934426	The original Xbox series.
1935006	1937127	I thought there was one I didn't recognize, but that's it.
1937687	1939028	Luckily, I can buy them separately.
1939728	1941029	So I don't have to buy all the crappy ones.
1941289	1943490	But you get a discount if you buy all the crap together.
1943790	1944431	Nope.
1944451	1944811	Sorry.
1945551	1947713	I like how they try to trick you to do that kind of stuff.
1947793	1951254	Hey, if you buy ten bags of potatoes, you get them for a buck.
1952315	1953916	You know, ten for a dollar.
1954716	1957678	Really, there are like ten for ten dollars.
1957798	1959339	Jamie, Loki's talking about potatoes.
1959419	1959959	Please save us.
1961037	1965678	How about some asshattery from Sony?
1965858	1966238	All right.
1967419	1980362	Well, the Sony CEO, Howard Stringer, is full of crap because he's quoted as saying, I'm happy the Wii seems to be running a bit short of hardware.
1980782	1986704	The PlayStation 3 will come into its own because its games are infinitely more fun, demanding, and exciting.
1987484	1988344	Yeah, that's bullshit.
1990273	1992014	Wait, the Wii is short on hardware?
1992154	1997595	I mean, there's a variety of third-party things out there for the Wii.
1997635	1999116	Granted, most of them are shit.
1999556	2003737	Like, I think about that little plastic golf club and stuff that you can get, the little fake tennis racket.
2004197	2005637	But, you know, there's the Wii Zapper and stuff.
2005657	2007258	I think they're meaning the Wii itself.
2008638	2011539	So they're just saying the Wii isn't as fun as the PlayStation 3?
2011839	2012399	Pretty much.
2012820	2013980	I dispute that claim.
2014665	2016927	I've had a lot more fun playing games on Wii than on PS3.
2016947	2018468	The Wii is a lot of fun.
2018548	2024952	I mean, granted, you know, it's not that the PlayStation 3 is horrible, but right now it's kind of close.
2024972	2031997	Well, they're thinking that they're going to sell more PlayStation 3s, but honestly, we saw the stack at Best Buy.
2032778	2034819	You know, and it's not just at that one.
2034879	2037201	It's at a multitude of stores that
2037805	2039286	They're not moving the units.
2039346	2040488	People want a Wii.
2040588	2046993	He does understand that the reason there are no Wiis is because people want them so bad and so they keep selling out.
2047574	2051117	Whereas the PlayStation 3 doesn't have that problem because they're not selling out.
2052118	2054560	I mean, I don't understand.
2055521	2058424	And where does he get off saying that their games are more fun?
2059380	2062261	Because if you like first-person shooters and broken games, that's awesome.
2062481	2065081	I see the PlayStation 3 has a lot of potential.
2065542	2066502	It does have potential.
2066542	2067722	It just hasn't done anything.
2067962	2069863	I watched that trailer for Final Fantasy XIII.
2069883	2072543	There's a new one that came out this week, and it looks fucking amazing.
2072663	2074084	It looks absolutely fucking amazing.
2074104	2078785	It will be fucking amazing when it comes out Christmas 2009, but I'm not going to wait that long for that shit.
2078825	2084226	And I am so all over a PlayStation 3, like, I don't know, like candy.
2084246	2087147	Well, if they had that, like, you know... Like a fat kid on candy, but I...
2088551	2093775	That trailer was amazing, but for right now, there's not a lot that's making me want to get a PlayStation 3.
2093815	2096857	You know, if they had that at launch, we wouldn't be talking about it.
2096877	2103881	We'd be like saying, wow, look at the PlayStation 3, selling millions and millions of units, and Final Fantasy XIII's fucking awesome, I can play this all day long.
2104282	2114669	But no, it's just, the problem is it's not going to come out for a long time, and we got more stories talking about some of the other things that were promised to be out earlier, you know, in 2008, but are probably not, so...
2118345	2125108	Well, just to illustrate a point, Dan says that he gets about maybe 50 calls a day for people asking for a Wii.
2126009	2129451	And I don't think he's mentioned anyone calling it at all for a PS3.
2130484	2131705	The Wii is selling on fat appeal.
2149696	2150217	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2168348	2169388	Money for Nintendo.
2169568	2173409	And when this whole Wii Fit thing comes out, I'm going to tell you, it's going to happen all over again.
2173449	2176550	It's going to continue this fad craze of the Wii until 2008.
2176970	2181071	And I just hope it's a good game and fun and useful.
2181331	2182872	Who cares how they're selling systems?
2182932	2184012	At least they're selling systems.
2184032	2188453	You can't even fucking pick a damn approach to how they're selling your systems.
2188753	2189513	Oh, it's a PC.
2189673	2190634	Oh, it's a Blu-ray player.
2190754	2191874	Oh, it's a game system.
2192294	2193734	You can't fucking make your mind up.
2194434	2195515	So whatever.
2195875	2196635	At least it's selling.
2198263	2199083	All right, let's move on.
2228792	2229593	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2247205	2252873	I was going to say, OLRPSP.com I think needs an update badly, especially if that ends up coming out over here.
2253114	2254376	We need people to be able to listen to OLR.
2254396	2255858	We don't broadcast over Shoutcast, though.
2256018	2256559	Well, sort of.
2256699	2260164	I think you can tap the Live365 feed into Shoutcast somehow.
2260384	2260665	No.
2260745	2261125	Can't you?
2261546	2261706	No.
2261907	2262207	Damn it!
2263436	2264316	I don't know how, at least.
2265236	2266156	If we could, that'd be awesome.
2266417	2267337	Yeah, we'll have to look into that.
2267497	2270377	Because I know we get emails once in a while from people, right?
2270397	2272398	They say, we listen on PSP, we listen on PSP.
2272778	2279499	If that stuff comes out over here, heck, even if it doesn't come out over here, I bet there's got to be at least a handful of people that listen on their PSPs to this program in Japan.
2280439	2282859	We ought to be able to let them listen live on their PSPs.
2282879	2283239	Why not?
2283479	2283840	Why not?
2284940	2285700	Get on that, Loki.
2286980	2287540	Make it happen.
2287560	2290141	Oh, well, let me just figure out how to broadcast and shoutcast.
2290161	2290961	That'd be awesome.
2290981	2291481	Hey, you do that.
2291521	2292221	Homework assignment.
2292642	2294103	I've already tried doing that stuff.
2295043	2295944	I can't figure it out.
2296104	2297004	I'm too stupid.
2297585	2298265	Sorry to hear that.
2298805	2300126	Let's get to some release dates.
2300206	2303448	Speaking of our friends over in Japan, I've got the Japanese release dates for you.
2303488	2309071	Coming on the Xbox 360 December 20th, FIFA 08 World Class Soccer comes out in Japan.
2309451	2312933	Moving on with the release dates, we also have a release of FIFA 08 on the PlayStation 3.
2313014	2317656	The GunCon makes its way to the PlayStation 3 separately, I assume.
2317976	2320758	Oh no, Time Crisis finally comes out in Japan as well.
2322179	2326663	Time Crisis 4 makes its way to the PlayStation 3 in Japan this week, also on the 20th.
2327083	2332608	Medal of Honor Airborne also makes its way from EA to the PlayStation 3 in Japan this week.
2333068	2336311	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Crazy Climber Wii.
2336671	2339233	Remember we reported on this earlier a couple months ago.
2339273	2343837	They were remaking the classic 80s game Crazy Climber for the Wii.
2344037	2346599	Japan will finally get its first look at that this week.
2346619	2347460	Maybe we will soon.
2347500	2349843	Meet the Robinsons Attack of the Toybots
2361243	2362544	Cats with a Z2 and Dogs with a Z2
2381187	2383448	They're not awesome, but they're not horrible.
2404358	2404938	Wow.
2405518	2410640	So, you know, it's stupid, but hey, over here, at least in the United States, it's only like 30 bucks.
2410900	2414821	So, you know, wait, find one used for like 10 bucks or something like that, there you go.
2415121	2418042	Or if you feel like paying twice as much, you could import the one from Japan.
2418782	2421243	I would rather not, because it's already out over here.
2421303	2423023	There's no point in importing.
2423996	2425957	Alright, moving on with other release dates.
2425997	2429198	The PlayStation 2 is getting some releases as well.
2429918	2432579	Myself, Yourself is a game that's coming out.
2432599	2435220	There's a limited edition of it as well on the 20th.
2435840	2439262	Another game called Pia Carrot y Yokoso, G.O.
2439322	2439942	Summer Fair.
2440382	2441623	Also has a limited edition.
2441863	2443223	Pia Carrot's old school too.
2443623	2445044	That's an old school anime, right?
2445084	2447305	Well, the games have been out for quite a while.
2448185	2450546	Well, I guess it's another one coming out.
2451427	2453988	December 20th, just in time for Christmas over in Japan.
2455629	2457750	Looking at a couple other games.
2457830	2461551	I want to see if there's anything on the DS or PSP, because of course those are always crazy.
2462732	2464452	Port of Meet the Robinsons on the DS.
2464972	2467753	Doku Demo Pilates comes out.
2467773	2470534	That's not Pirates, that's Pilates comes out in Japan as well.
2471535	2477157	Dora Base, Dorimon Chao Yakyu Gaiden comes out from Namco on the Nintendo DS.
2477757	2479578	A puzzler called DS Puzzler.
2479938	2484100	Numbluff DS Puzzler comes out as well on the Nintendo DS.
2484600	2486541	And I'm sure a lot of people are very excited about this.
2486581	2488321	This is one that folks might even be importing.
2488761	2493543	Final Fantasy IV, the remake, hits Japan this week on the Nintendo DS.
2493583	2497385	I'm sure that's going to be the best-selling game of the week as far as the new stuff goes.
2498045	2499325	I like the sound of this game, though.
2499665	2501846	Pinky Street Kira Kira Music Night.
2502306	2503027	Ah, fun!
2503147	2504847	I actually have Pinky Street dolls.
2505528	2505888	Really?
2506788	2509129	What they are, they're these little plastic dolls.
2509676	2512657	and there may be about, I would want to say like three inches tall.
2513237	2514098	They're smurf-sized.
2514758	2516539	But anyway, no, that's three apples high.
2516919	2528763	Anyway, you can take off their heads and change them out and take off their hair and change them out and it's like you snap them into place is how they work.
2529463	2536066	And so they're fully customizable and I guess it would be the same type of thing on the game as you customize your pinky and
2537226	2539108	and I've got like a few of them by now.
2539148	2544291	They even did Street Fighter and King of Fighters themed ones and Sakura Taisen.
2544952	2545912	So I've got a few of those.
2546853	2547693	Oh, very interesting.
2548394	2549855	Is there any interest in getting this game?
2549995	2550655	Importing it maybe?
2550776	2550976	No.
2551356	2551596	Alright.
2552517	2553177	After all that.
2553577	2555058	Alright, that's it for Japanese release.
2555259	2557020	That's all I'm going to cover on Japanese release dates.
2557040	2557520	Let's move on.
2557960	2561283	So is that like, you know, build a human type thing?
2561943	2562343	Not really.
2562363	2563564	I'll find a link for the chat room.
2563744	2564905	I have no idea.
2564945	2565626	Let's go over to Europe.
2565986	2566066	Um,
2566793	2568134	Only one game is on the list.
2568414	2568674	Wow.
2569214	2571195	On the 19th, Sensible World of Soccer.
2572456	2575297	Oh, coming out finally to the Xbox 360 Live Arcade.
2575777	2576278	That is it.
2576718	2579159	So, I guess it's slowing down because it's Christmas time.
2580079	2580640	I guess so.
2580800	2581380	How about the U.S.?
2582160	2582681	No, the U.S.
2582721	2583621	has got a few things.
2583721	2584601	Not as much as usual.
2585182	2586923	Anyways, a few things.
2587343	2595126	MX vs. ATV Untamed coming out on PSP, PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 and DS.
2596860	2600343	Elements of Destruction is coming out on DS and that game is kind of neat looking.
2600743	2606227	It's basically you kind of play Mother Nature so you can cause tornadoes and fires and stuff.
2606628	2609910	It is also coming to Xbox Live Arcade at some point.
2610390	2611091	So that's kind of neat.
2612072	2614153	And then let's see here.
2614233	2617116	Warhammer 40,000 Squad Command on the DS.
2618216	2622740	Dyson Ryaku Exceed coming to the PlayStation 2.
2624661	2625922	And let's see here.
2626143	2626563	Also
2628386	2630088	The PlayStation 2 of Rock Band.
2630868	2632710	That game's coming out this week as well.
2633591	2635012	So let's see here.
2635052	2637354	Atari Classics Evolved for the PSP.
2637654	2639335	Another one of those compilation sets.
2639976	2641777	Luxor 2 on the DS.
2643519	2646862	And Knights Journey of Dreams on the Wii.
2649164	2651205	So you can get your Knights fix here pretty soon.
2651245	2652306	Jamie's applauding over there.
2652326	2654288	I've been getting my Knights fix already.
2655783	2657243	Did you ask Santa for that for Christmas?
2657704	2660604	I'm probably going to get it, but we've been playing Christmas nights.
2662145	2665686	And then one other thing I was going to mention here real quick.
2665886	2668627	It's not a game, but I thought it's interesting anyways.
2669007	2672548	MadCatz is putting out an HDMI conversion kit.
2672608	2678309	It's for all those people like me that do not have an Xbox 360 with HDMI out.
2678669	2684331	It plugs into the back of your system and it allows you to do HDMI and optical out as well.
2685460	2688983	And that's, although the only sting to it is it retails for $89.99.
2691465	2691826	All right.
2694588	2701333	Nintendo announced this week, you know, obviously they're having some issues staying on top of manufacturing enough Wii's for everybody out there.
2701433	2704416	So this is their contingency plan they announced this week.
2705457	2709560	Reggie Fils-Aimé came out this week and said, hey, we're joining up with GameStop.
2710181	2712743	We're going to create this Wii Rain Check program.
2713363	2713923	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2737013	2739995	to be able to take these type of deposits for games.
2740575	2742696	That's at least the reason why they did it.
2742856	2749700	The only days, however, that you can do this, December 20th and 21st, are the only days that you are going to be able to do this.
2750440	2760745	However, there are supposed to be tens of thousands of rain checks available, and who knows, that may still not be enough for the demand of the console, because it's the Furby of 2007.
2761165	2762446	It's the Cabbage Patch Kid.
2763266	2764847	It's the gift of this year.
2764927	2766288	Hey, I waited in line.
2767148	2767608	for a Wii.
2767909	2768489	For my Wii.
2768709	2769070	I know.
2769290	2771272	I made my roommate wait in line for mine and it worked.
2771812	2772633	It did very well.
2773074	2776577	See, it just goes to show that sometimes, you know, waiting in line for...
2777270	2779092	You know, these things actually does pay off.
2779393	2779573	Right.
2779873	2782897	But at the same time, how would you feel if you were one of those kids?
2783117	2783898	Let's flash back.
2783918	2787222	You know, I told the story earlier in the show about me as the spoiled brat when I was a kid.
2787642	2791707	Let's flash back to me as the spoiled brat as a kid who wanted a Nintendo Wii this Christmas.
2792048	2794651	And I open up my present to get one of these rain checks.
2795211	2797414	Am I going to be a satisfied kid or am I going to cry?
2799465	2799886	DarkSakura.com
2815609	2819250	We couldn't get you one right now, but we will get you one by the end of January.
2819290	2821470	You don't have to say, here's a fucking rain check for you.
2821610	2824210	I mean, that's just like, kids are like, what?
2824811	2826051	I don't understand this.
2826451	2827211	I'm not kidding.
2827231	2828051	Where's the controller?
2828091	2829111	Where's Mario?
2829151	2830652	Santa hates me.
2830672	2835852	He's going to go take the rain check and soak it with his tears is what he's going to do.
2837013	2837933	Well, you know what?
2838473	2844834	In my family, when I was a kid, if there was something that I wanted and didn't get, I lived with it.
2847927	2853188	or you get a job mowing lawns or selling lemonade and you save up and you buy the fucking thing yourself.
2853248	2854408	Or I stole it from my brother.
2855249	2856669	That's exactly what you do.
2856709	2865471	See, the year you wanted your Super Nintendo and everything, my brothers went into Super Nintendo and my mom asked me, should I give them a Super Nintendo or a Genesis?
2865731	2868151	You need to give them a Super Nintendo and you need to get these games.
2869091	2871632	She got them a Super Scope, Zelda.
2872392	2874773	She picked out Home Alone for some retarded reason.
2874793	2876133	That game sucked ass.
2876738	2879720	Home Alone, Kevin McAllister's so cute.
2881902	2886566	And so my brothers played like five seconds of Home Alone and then I beat Zelda that week.
2888567	2891670	So did your brothers even play the Super Nintendo or was this your present?
2891690	2893991	They played Home Alone and they're like, what did I do bad?
2894111	2896493	Seriously, why am I being punished?
2896513	2903819	No, they actually, my brothers and I played a lot of Blastress and the mole thing.
2905174	2912657	I'm going to get Jamie a copy of Home Alone on the Super Nintendo for Christmas and wrap it in coal and put it in her stocking.
2913997	2914857	That'd be great.
2915958	2921180	My little brothers are too busy running around being little terrorists in the neighborhood, so I have the Super Nintendo.
2921620	2923020	Comments from chat, love it.
2923500	2927142	SSJ100Matt says, Dear little Billy, I owe you a Wii.
2927222	2927842	Love, Santa.
2928792	2929472	Tiger Claw.
2929812	2931293	What if you lose the rain check?
2931313	2932353	Wouldn't you be screwed?
2933193	2934053	I don't know if you would be.
2934253	2936514	Yeah, you would because GameStop sucks.
2936534	2938054	They'd be like, oh, you don't have your receipt.
2938374	2939354	Sorry, Billy.
2939614	2940955	You ain't ever getting a win.
2940975	2947136	I seem to recall I didn't have my receipt once for a $5 pre-order and they still gave it to me because it was in the phone number in the system.
2947156	2952297	Well, not only that, they actually keep a copy of your...
2953587	2955108	I love this comment from Gerardimo.
2955128	2961070	My mommy wrote me a note from Santa that said the elves couldn't find a copy of Hey You Pikachu because the store was sold out and I would get it eventually.
2982912	2983873	That's so cute.
2985735	2987496	Let's see, what's this?
2988977	2991400	Ranma says, fuck rain checks, give me a gift card.
2991780	2995343	And Ross Steel UT in response says, even that would be better than a fucking IOU.
2996004	3000688	Well, seriously, because, you know, this is why I love the concept of gift cards.
3001289	3003771	It's because, especially for me being picky as a kid...
3004466	3011689	And again, you know, if I got something I didn't want, I always took it back to the store myself, returned it myself, and got what I wanted.
3011969	3013990	Actually, I was just thinking something there.
3014691	3028617	Nintendo's quite smart teaming up with GameStop, you know, with this whole rain check thing, because if for whatever reason Nintendo can't deliver those Wii's by the end of January, people are going to be fucking pissed off at GameStop, but no one's going to remember that it's Nintendo's fault.
3028837	3032539	I want to hear more about 10-year-old Jamie marching into the store and returning your gifts.
3034349	3043016	Well, it's like, my family would buy me ugly clothes, so I... Okay, now it's just funny, sorry.
3043276	3047260	So I would make them drop me off at the mall, and then I'd go do all my exchanges myself.
3047960	3052044	And sometimes I'd get cash back and then go over to Babbage's, because we had Babbage's.
3052804	3056748	Before, you know, before GameStop took them all over.
3057308	3058409	You know, I'm not going to wear this.
3059570	3060451	I'm taking it back.
3061271	3061912	To get games.
3062773	3063173	Instead.
3064352	3065152	Oh my god, shoes.
3066733	3070915	Or, you know, if they wouldn't, I would just, you know, get like a different pair of jeans or something.
3070955	3078198	But it's like, and it wasn't that I was, I am not, it wasn't that I was ungrateful or anything.
3078278	3080339	Or a sick bastard, as GS68 put it.
3080859	3088943	No, it wasn't that I was ungrateful or anything, you know, because I was plenty grateful for the stuff that I got because, you know, when I was growing up, we didn't actually have a whole lot of money.
3089643	3089883	I mean...
3090791	3095434	I actually, you know, when I was, you know, in first and second grade, we were actually poverty level.
3095895	3102660	So, I remember having, you know, icicles in my bathtub one winter, and I'm not even joking.
3103240	3105802	So, now I think I'm really spoiled.
3107363	3112307	But when I was a kid, I didn't have, you know, if I got something...
3113081	3116824	Then, if it wasn't what I wanted, I found a way to turn it into what I wanted.
3117385	3119487	So, it was just a matter of that.
3119687	3123390	And all these kids who say, Oh, but I want a Wii.
3123430	3124771	Well, tough shit.
3126333	3127214	There are no Wiis.
3128094	3128855	Get something else.
3129616	3130136	You'll live.
3130356	3131377	Get a job, Billy.
3133699	3135701	Santa didn't buy you a Wii because you don't have a job.
3136542	3136782	No.
3137162	3138864	But, I mean, but you see...
3140488	3153014	I think that there's just way too much of, oh, well, you know, I, and Dan is actually saying, and I'm not going to go into any detail on this, but this person is saying, oh, I spent all this money in your store and I'm entitled to a Wii.
3153514	3154354	Well, we don't have any.
3154514	3155015	Tough shit.
3155935	3162798	You know, I think that people need to learn to be, I guess, to take no for an answer and find something else.
3163513	3168736	You know, I can just imagine if Jamie had a kid, or maybe I would do this to my kid, and I wasn't able to get a Wii for my kid.
3168877	3171038	I would leave a note under the tree for something like this.
3171058	3171818	This is something like this.
3172599	3175621	Santa is very sorry that he could not get you a Wii this year.
3175721	3179163	He has more important things to do, like ending genocide in Darfur.
3179804	3180044	Right?
3180804	3182425	He doesn't do any of that kind of crap.
3182445	3183146	He just delivers.
3183326	3186028	He's a fucking glorified UPS driver, is what he is.
3186488	3187449	No, but seriously, though...
3189437	3193260	All these people that think they need special treatment stuff are finding Wiis and stuff like that.
3193680	3197243	I get customers asking, you know, yeah, I have someone looking for a Wii.
3197283	3199245	I'm like, you know, it's like two weeks before Christmas.
3199325	3201246	Why the fuck are they just now looking for a Wii?
3201487	3202647	Why didn't they plan this out?
3203248	3204909	Well, they didn't know it was going to be so hard to find.
3204949	3206070	Well, tough shit for them!
3207271	3209373	Why should we cater to the fact that they're stupid?
3209393	3210614	Alright.
3211454	3213356	I'm sure we've got lots of holiday stories.
3213416	3215978	Maybe we'll get some of them in our mailbag later from our listeners.
3216238	3218540	I'm not trying to be, you know, all kinds of
3219042	3221744	ZenoCore in chat says, Dude, I would do that too.
3244969	3246490	Alright, let's move on with more news.
3246550	3249132	Jamie, what's the latest news at Jamie's Gaming Outlet?
3249693	3251134	Hey, virtual console stuff.
3251854	3257058	For our friends in the UK, we have Pokemon Snap that was on the Nintendo 64.
3258339	3262462	And Pokemon Snap is great and it's fun and lovely.
3263243	3266365	And then we have Top Hunter that was on Neo Geo.
3266385	3272630	Yeah, I didn't really like Top Hunter all that much, so I'm not going to talk about it.
3273311	3284436	And the last one, which is almost as cool as Pokemon Snap, but cooler in its own respect, is Mega Man 2 from Nintendo Entertainment System.
3285976	3290158	And if you don't know what Mega Man 2 is, you need to climb out of that cave you've been living in for the past 20 years.
3290178	3292419	Do they have Mega Man 1 on Virtual Console over there?
3292839	3293120	I don't know.
3293140	3294780	Or is Mega Man 2 the first game they're getting?
3294940	3296421	I think Mega Man 2 is the first.
3296581	3297761	Dude, I want both!
3298362	3299162	And I want Mega Man 3!
3299262	3301163	The first one was great!
3302463	3302964	It really was!
3302984	3304004	Because of the Cutman weapon.
3304685	3307988	It was different than all the others, but it was great, and it had some awesome music.
3308388	3311111	Some of my favorite music ever from a video game was, like, a Lechman stage.
3311651	3312112	It was great.
3312132	3317296	But I really liked the Metal Blades, though, and Mega Man 2.
3317877	3322681	But I totally loved Mega Man 3, because you had to beat the game with the top, with, like, the most useless weapon.
3323822	3325564	Ah, Ross Steel UT has a good point, though.
3325644	3327505	Yeah, I already have Mega Man Collection.
3327606	3328106	Good point.
3328905	3332507	Why not just get the Mega Man collection and do the backwards compatibility with the GameCube disc?
3333148	3333568	Good thought.
3334689	3336470	F the virtual console for Mega Man, huh?
3337250	3338751	Yeah, F the virtual console.
3340152	3341413	Why should I have to buy games again?
3342134	3345676	Damn you, Nintendo, and trying to get me to purchase stuff I've already purchased again.
3346356	3346917	And it works.
3347577	3348838	Yeah, stupid Game Boy.
3349278	3349759	Anyways...
3351283	3355184	One thing that we're going to be getting over here pretty soon, Dragon Quest Swords.
3355524	3357224	It's been announced to come to the U.S.
3357504	3358324	on February 26th.
3358584	3360705	It has a really fucking long name.
3361645	3364986	Dragon Quest Swords, The Masked Queen, and The Tower of Mirrors.
3366246	3367206	Too long of a subtitle.
3369646	3370647	It looks like a pretty fun game.
3371067	3378768	I have not yet played the Japanese version of it, but you use the Wiimote to slash at slime, so that can't be that bad.
3379841	3382702	Didn't they have that same thing on the PlayStation 2, I seem to recall?
3383002	3389045	Like, I remember going to some anime convention and in a back room they had a Dragon Quest game that had a giant sword and you'd slash slimes.
3389265	3390345	I think, yeah.
3390545	3392366	Well, they had an arcade version of that.
3392706	3394187	They did have an arcade version, so.
3394327	3394707	Oh, really?
3394767	3395988	Maybe it's the same thing.
3396988	3397328	Kind of neat.
3397348	3399929	Perhaps, but I guess this has taken a while.
3399949	3402630	Wasn't this supposed to be a launch game and we're just now getting it?
3403191	3403351	Uh, yeah.
3403671	3403851	Yeah.
3404682	3407124	along with the whole Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.
3407484	3408385	What the F-square?
3408425	3409946	Where the hell did your Wii games go?
3410026	3412127	Crystal Chronicles, I want to say, was like June now.
3412908	3414529	Jeez, that was supposed to be a launch game.
3414569	3415089	Am I crazy?
3415630	3415870	No.
3416070	3416630	I thought it was.
3416931	3417331	No, wait.
3417391	3417711	No, no.
3417751	3418472	I'm sorry, not June.
3418692	3421134	It's spring, but it's only the DS version.
3421154	3423615	They haven't announced the Wii version yet.
3423936	3425557	Crystal Chronicles was kind of underrated.
3425697	3426738	I really loved that game.
3426758	3431461	The only problem with it is that, God, you had to have a lot of shit in order to be able to play that game, including four people.
3432199	3436413	and four Game Boy Advances and four Link Kills and everything.
3437273	3444235	All right, well, if you want a Wii to be playing the Dragon Quest game on, of course, we've been talking about that they're practically impossible to find.
3444255	3453077	But one thing to keep in mind is that the Nintendo World Store in New York City in Rockefeller Center, they get more shipments of the Wii every morning.
3454118	3462940	Apparently, a reporter from Game Daily visited the store recently and observed that there were 20 Wiis lined up behind the main counter just waiting for whoever's in line.
3463340	3473604	But what's been going on is that more and more recently, WCBS Radio reported not that long ago that there were over 200 people camped out outside the store before the store even opened.
3474505	3479467	And some folks are traveling all the way from Virginia to get a freaking Nintendo Wii.
3479487	3482949	Well shit, that's a good way to do it if you know that they're going to get some in every day.
3483449	3487390	Hey, if you don't get it the first day, go see some sites, come back and camp later.
3488651	3489892	What about like your day job?
3490012	3490852	I don't know, is it just me?
3492011	3492471	Fuck that.
3492771	3494452	Getting a Wii for Billy is more important.
3496072	3497213	I digress, but never mind.
3497793	3499253	Let's move on with some more gaming news.
3501374	3511838	Well, more Wii stuff is the game Castle Shikigami 3 will be coming out to Nintendo Wii next year.
3513318	3515819	It has a lot to do with dodging bullets.
3516499	3517280	It's bullet hell.
3518380	3518580	Yeah.
3520305	3520805	Yay!
3521085	3523166	Good for those fans of Ikaruga and stuff like that.
3523186	3526707	It's a very interesting shooter.
3526787	3528327	And also you collect coins while you play.
3529048	3530368	I wonder how that's going to control the Wii.
3530388	3535210	I wonder if it's going to be like Geometry Wars where you point at the screen where you want to shoot or if it's going to have that kind of functionality in it.
3535570	3536010	I don't know.
3536590	3539271	I think you're probably thinking way too much into it.
3539451	3541531	No, seriously, seriously.
3541551	3546513	They'll probably just have the controller turned sideways and playing it like a virtual console game.
3547529	3548850	Oh, yeah, I guess that'll work too, huh?
3549010	3552411	Yeah, because, I mean, a lot of these games don't use the motion controls and stuff like that.
3553031	3554952	It'd be too hard, especially with, like, pinpoint stuff.
3555892	3556412	Well, that works.
3556893	3561514	Anyways, um, so, there's another game coming to the Wii.
3561854	3563355	This is kind of interesting, actually.
3563695	3569817	Um, I laughed when I saw it because even though there's a game that's just like it that's already been announced, we don't know when that's coming out.
3569897	3573679	This game, though, however, is coming out, I want to say, in March.
3574379	3574499	Um,
3575302	3576703	Wild Earth, African Safari
3593147	3594108	How can you say that?
3594148	3596049	We don't know anything about Africa.
3596809	3600450	They are similar in the regards they are both about Africa.
3600951	3603052	Africa is a giant fucking place.
3603292	3604472	I don't know if you are aware.
3604632	3609934	Hey, I will have you know that there's photography in this game much like Africa.
3610535	3612996	There are animals just like Africa.
3613836	3614917	They both take place in Africa.
3615097	3618618	If anything else, I would say this is more authentic because they spelled Africa correctly.
3619058	3620639	Okay, so whatever.
3621198	3625279	Anyways, Safari Photo Africa Wild Earth is a PC game.
3625299	3636883	I guess it got released a while ago and took home some awards in the 2003 Independent Games Festival, including the coveted Seamus McNally Grand Prize.
3636903	3638024	What the fuck that's supposed to mean?
3638524	3650068	Anyways, this game takes place... You are a photojournalist exploring Africa's Serengeti National Park, tasked with taking photos of 30 different animals in their natural habitat.
3650882	3657925	and apparently if you get close to the animals for the perfect shot or if you get too close the Wiimote will rumble making it harder to snap the picture.
3659045	3667028	And the Wii version will include co-op, multiplayer, one player to drive while the other two shoot photos.
3667548	3669169	Unfortunately we can't run over the animals with the
3669921	3671902	The Jeep, at least I don't think you can.
3672102	3673102	Boring.
3673362	3676423	That's the only one I'm going to play in these games, is if I can run over the animals.
3676783	3677304	I don't get it.
3677484	3679044	Jamie, what the hell's going on here?
3679064	3685106	We're getting Africa on the PlayStation 3, this Safari game on the Wii, yet still no Jumbo Safari.
3685887	3687027	What the hell is wrong with this world?
3687687	3691689	Well, you know, we have no Jumbo Safari, but we also have no Planet Harrier.
3692789	3693309	Hi!
3694890	3697511	It's all those games that came out around that time.
3697571	3697911	We have...
3698872	3705716	If Sega would give us a dedicated platform, a dedicated system, then we would have all this awesome.
3706276	3706717	But no!
3707077	3708197	OMG, Dreamcast 2.
3708718	3709218	I wish!
3709338	3710759	Jumbo Safari packing game.
3710819	3713620	Wasn't Jumbo Safari kind of a gun game almost?
3713781	3715081	Yeah, it was.
3715602	3716222	Like Harpoon.
3717623	3718283	It's a Harpoon.
3718523	3718983	Harpoon.
3720404	3721005	Harpoon.
3721025	3722746	Harpoon.
3723026	3725307	Frisbee calls it Pokemon Snafrica.
3726388	3726868	There you go.
3727349	3733153	The only bad thing about this thing, and no offense to Majesco, but Majesco's putting it out.
3734394	3736935	I mean, seriously, what was the last good game from Majesco that came out?
3739337	3740017	I'll give you a hint.
3740037	3747422	There's one game that they put out in the Wii that I remember, and that was that... Oh, fuck, what was it called?
3747722	3749203	Bust a Move Bash or whatever.
3750244	3750824	It was a puzzle game.
3750965	3751965	You can't really innovate that much.
3752165	3752786	But let me put it this way.
3752806	3754527	The screenshots don't show much detail.
3756807	3758048	There's probably a reason for that.
3783941	3812278	and the kiosks where you play the games on instead of there just being one there's a ton of them now they're opening one of these in San Jose and gosh part of me kind of wants to go down and check it out maybe do a report for the show because it's not that far and I go there a lot but anyhow apparently these places are going to have 24 networked gaming stations they're all going to have plasma display on it and they're supposed to be doing various competitions in these places most weekends are when they're supposed to be doing it they're going to kick it off with a Madden tournament
3813138	3820383	and the winner of the Madden Tournament gets a $1,000 GameStop shopping spree which they could spend right there in the store.
3821684	3824006	I can't see how this is going to make them any money.
3824806	3828969	Is this like their idea of countering a LAN center?
3829449	3830490	Well, here's the thing.
3831231	3840597	I don't know if they're going to be countering LAN centers, but one of their competition chains that's kind of up and coming, they're starting to do this more, Play and Trade.
3841261	3842901	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3867028	3868229	Well, I imagine they have to be.
3868590	3876859	You pay like a $20, $30 entry fee, and if you get 50 people to enter it, there's your $1,000 prize right there, and anything additional is just extra money.
3877139	3880282	And with a game like Madden that's so competitive... I don't know.
3880322	3884507	It's going to be tough, though, because I know like those other places, they don't charge...
3885120	3886141	You know, for tournaments and stuff.
3886341	3890024	Okay, plus, you get all those gamers in one place and then what are you going to do?
3890044	3894167	You're going to put out a table full of Madden merchandise out there for them to buy, right?
3894968	3901674	Like, I can think of DDR tournaments I went to where Red Octane would come in and they would have a table because this was back before Red Octane was big for Guitar Hero.
3901994	3907819	They would come and they would sell dance pads and soundtracks and all the DDR crap there at the tournament.
3908219	3909060	And that's how they made money.
3910021	3911542	Or at conventions, anime conventions.
3911622	3913023	It's really a good idea.
3913403	3914044	I mean, honestly.
3914819	3917221	It's like selling t-shirts at a concert.
3917741	3918521	Yeah, I suppose.
3919882	3924205	So GS68, they've seen one at the San Tomas and Stevens Creek GameStop.
3924285	3925526	I've shopped there before, by the way.
3926146	3928447	It's actually right next to my grand princess.
3928808	3931489	But I don't know.
3933731	3938634	The only reason why is I know a lot of people that own land centers and they own places like this where they ran out of time.
3938654	3941075	And hell, we knew it was Arena.
3941135	3942696	They used to have something similar like this.
3943109	3944569	I don't think it will be.
3944589	3944929	We'll see.
3944949	3945290	We'll see.
3965268	3966969	Alright, well, let's move on with some more gaming news.
3967089	3970010	If we have any listeners in San Jose who happen to check this place out, let us know.
3970351	3973152	If not, I'll try to make it a point to go by there in the near future.
3973172	3973512	We'll see.
3974153	3980296	Well, there are some details released about Tomb Raider Underworld that's being developed by Crystal Dynamics.
3981616	3986159	It should be out next year on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
3987239	3994423	And is going to be... They were actually quoted in...
3996601	3999782	Play Magazine is saying it was Pure Woman vs. Wild.
4001323	4003804	I'm really... I don't know.
4004684	4006845	Because I think there's way too many Tomb Raider games already.
4007885	4015348	But I did think, though, that it's pretty cool that they have a new lighting model for what'll be going on in the game.
4015648	4016308	I think it's pretty cool.
4016989	4025952	I like the more technical side of it, so I would check it out just to at least look at something online to see how it turns out
4028486	4030807	Well, Tomb Raider is one of those series that just won't die.
4031548	4032828	And this is forced on to prove it.
4035230	4036290	Here's another series.
4036430	4040212	Well, I don't know if it's going to be a series, but maybe a game that should die.
4041233	4045175	The Prince's Bride game, which doesn't look all that wonderful.
4045195	4048116	I mean, it looks like, to be honest, like a CDI game.
4050197	4057761	Anyways, according to a new G4 interview, they've gotten some information direct from the developer's mouths.
4058345	4065688	Apparently, well, the game itself, the target demographic, I believe, was women for it.
4066588	4069889	They said that they're not going to be using a lot of the voice actors.
4069969	4071970	It's actually going to be sound-alikes for the voices.
4073470	4081773	And, of course, they're saying that the game's going to be out spring of 2008 on PC.
4083294	4086675	And if you'd like, you can pre-order it at the official site, princessbridegame.com.
4088544	4089804	I don't know, the game doesn't look that good.
4090805	4093086	I looked at that picture, it does look like a CDI game.
4094686	4100248	I mean, they'd have to use, you know, soundalikes anyway, at least for some of them, because, you know, Andre the Giant's dead.
4102129	4103389	They should make him talk anyways.
4104690	4108111	Splice clips together, like that one show after Chef left the show.
4109011	4109271	Right?
4110071	4110432	Never mind.
4111352	4111672	Anyhow.
4112674	4117237	We're going to debut a brand new segment on tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
4117737	4128082	And I can't say this is necessarily going to be a weekly segment, but it is going to be a segment that we're going to do on the show whenever something makes us feel like we need to do this segment.
4128463	4129603	It's not a new game.
4129683	4133685	It's not a new advice column or anything like that.
4133786	4138068	No, it is something we call here at Orange Lounge Radio the Stupid Award.
4142489	4153761	That's right, whenever we here at Orange Lounge Radio feel like somebody has done something extraordinarily stupid this week in the gaming industry, we're going to award them with the OLR Stupid Award.
4155884	4164313	So this week, the Stupid Award goes to this kid, and I'm probably going to mispronounce his name, but that's okay, he's stupid, Alyusha.
4165500	4166201	What did he do?
4166701	4174306	Well, he went on to Xbox Live and he was playing Call of Duty 4 and he sent messages to kids on Xbox Live.
4174326	4181130	He was playing Call of Duty 4 and he told them that he was going to shoot up his school and tell everybody on there how he was going to do it.
4181990	4192997	Well, sure enough, a Call of Duty 4 player from Oregon went to the police department and Microsoft ended up letting out the IP who tracked down this guy and arrested him.
4194272	4196993	Now, the kid later admitted that the whole thing was just a joke.
4197293	4199453	He had no intention of actually going through with it.
4199673	4201654	There were no guns to be found or whatever.
4202674	4206074	But still, why would you say this kind of crap on Xbox Live?
4207035	4209795	Especially in this day and age, in the world we live in.
4210095	4217457	So, congratulations, Alyusha, winner of the inaugural OLR Stupid Award!
4217777	4218297	Yay!
4219417	4219877	That's right.
4224102	4224863	Out of the gene pool.
4225503	4225843	Get out.
4226724	4227965	Let's get a little bleach in there.
4228405	4228665	All right.
4229185	4236390	Let's move on to a segment that we've done for a while now, and it's a well-loved segment here at Orange Lounge Radio.
4236510	4249119	It is the classic game of the week, and every week DarkSakura picks a favorite classic game of hers, and we basically pay tribute to our elders and respect them a little bit through our classic game of the week.
4249199	4253742	So DarkSakura, tell us about what game you picked out for us this week.
4254992	4258833	The game of the week is the X-Men arcade game.
4259274	4263055	The old one you could find either one screen or two screens.
4264476	4267497	I do believe that the differences were a four player and a six player.
4268437	4273179	And I played the hell out of this game when I was in 10th grade.
4274439	4278221	My arcade actually had the two screen setup.
4278261	4280162	So you used to play a whole craplet of this.
4280182	4281302	But it was put out by Konami.
4282604	4294093	and it's the final fight style game, you know, the side-scrolling beat-crap-up game, you know, or like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games, even though a lot of these floating around that time.
4294794	4301859	But you could play as Cyclops, Colossus, Wolverine, Storm, Nightcrawler, or Gavler, and I actually use Gavler almost all the time.
4302600	4307784	And you beat up the world's shortest Sentinels, because they're really supposed to be massive, but they were, like, little.
4308820	4317106	And it had the most, I swear, this would have all been candidates for English.com, the things that they would say in the game.
4318467	4329714	Now, I didn't realize this for quite a while, but the version that I played at one of the, not my main arcade, but the second arcade was actually a Japanese version.
4330655	4337800	Because they would drop extra power-ups that would refill the power meter, and apparently the German one did not.
4338706	4340607	So I was like, this is hard!
4341568	4343169	It was too easy.
4344010	4348873	So, um, but it was full of crap.
4349093	4357819	I mean, it was a really fun game, and I wish that there had been, um, you know, a home release list without me having to bust out the maze.
4358959	4359840	But it was a lot of fun.
4361687	4363328	All right, well, some comments from chatroom.
4363348	4367729	TigerClaw wants to remind us this was also the only X-Men game released by Konami.
4368109	4370871	Hence why it feels so much like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
4370891	4373812	Well, that's what I was saying, that it was in that type.
4375272	4377953	Now, Actdeft sounds like he has the best arcade ever.
4378053	4382195	He says, my arcade used to have this, TMNT Arcade, and Turtles in Time.
4382295	4383895	Turtles in Time was freaking great.
4384756	4387837	But this was my game before Turtles in Time.
4388649	4391811	However, Dillinger would like to share that the Simpsons arcade game was better.
4392371	4392752	I doubt.
4393592	4394553	Simpsons did it.
4394873	4397815	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
4397915	4400396	I actually really liked this one a whole lot better.
4401177	4405159	Alright, so there it is, your classic game of the week, X-Men, as done by the arcade.
4405199	4407781	And I'm just pausing our little YouTube-age of the game here.
4408181	4410422	Bonus, you are granted a special mutant power.
4410803	4415285	Note that mutant power can be used only when the energy indicator is at three or less.
4415946	4417787	Is that like now a second mutation?
4418817	4419057	I don't know.
4419077	4420038	Anyone who reads the comics.
4420459	4420759	I don't know.
4421720	4424943	Anyhow, that's going to bring this part A of our program to a close.
4424963	4429608	We're going to take a quick break and we will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
4430309	4435294	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
4435754	4440079	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
