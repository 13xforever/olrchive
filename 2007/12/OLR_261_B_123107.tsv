15436	19078	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
35186	36167	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
60373	61334	I had to pick up a few.
61614	66919	Yeah, and unfortunately, I mean, I think there was just so many emails these past two weeks that you're just not going to be able to read them all.
67279	69341	So, Jamie's having to be choosy this week.
69401	69981	Sorry, folks.
71823	73304	So, let's open up the old mailbag.
73344	75306	Mailbag at OrangeLandsRadio.com, though, if you want to send it.
75646	78128	Even if we don't always respond to them on air, we read them all.
78409	80090	I go in there and I read them all every day.
80350	84334	There was one that had a lot of gratuitous uses of the word fuck, so I'm not reading it.
84554	84854	I see.
85775	87877	So, I'm only reading a few of these, okay.
88723	89183	That'd be Robb.
119381	122243	Adios Amigos, Dr. Noir Don't move that email out.
122283	124084	Save it in there and I'll reply with the address.
124364	126966	Also, there's a PS.
127326	127706	Oh, okay.
128007	131069	The plural form of Luchador is not Luchadors, but Luchadores.
132049	135592	With the last syllable pronounced S as in Fez, the hat.
135672	136932	Alright.
137013	144117	I did want to say, speaking of gifts sent to us, one of our listeners, our lover, Misty, sent a little care package.
144457	145698	You can see it up on the wall.
145718	146959	There's a Hello Kitty popsicle there.
147352	152614	This little penguin eye dog thing, which I thought was too cute, and lots of rice candy, which is my favorite.
153114	154595	And I ate it.
156755	158436	She sent us some candy, but you eat it.
158496	159196	But I eat it.
159976	162277	Well, speaking of Misty, I'll go ahead and read her.
162317	166219	She actually did ask about me talking about the Happy Suicide song.
166239	172181	And it's Thanatos from End of Evangelion is the one I was referring to.
172201	172961	All right.
173261	175622	The song that's just so freaking depressing.
176562	180623	Oh, I thought it was the whole end scene where they're dying.
180823	181563	It was hilarious.
182564	182924	Oh, yeah.
182964	183684	Well, yeah.
184904	187405	But to read Misty's big email.
188065	192186	So I was listening to my old OLR episodes and got stuck for some reason on episode 242.
192846	197108	And that umbrella song that I ended up ripping from 249, but let's not go there right now, LOL.
198408	198848	Excuse me.
199870	207256	I guess what inspired me to write in again, well this time anyway, was the short text message email that you read in this episode, plus I do have a question.
207676	213120	I know I shouldn't necessarily be thinking this far ahead, but face it, ASIN is my other addiction, aside from the station.
213180	216883	I know enough not to ask if there'll be a panel, though that would be fucking rad.
217523	220645	So instead I'll ask this, currently does anyone's schedule work out for ASIN?
221226	227511	It's May 16th through 18th this year, but I am to head up to Rosemont on the 15th.
229457	231418	Also, should I expect to see Chris there?
231979	233220	I didn't catch her last year.
233240	235401	Feel free to insert lame Pokemon jokes here.
236022	237623	But I really want to see her in Megzi.
238703	240885	Also, I'll leave you alone for now.
240925	245888	Sorry if there's a typo I missed, but my typing on the LGNV still sucks a bit anyway.
245968	246509	Heart, Misty.
248470	252673	I would think very much that Chris is going to be there, seeing as how she's relocating.
255015	257116	Because I get to go with her on the trip.
258296	266740	AceN probably is not in my future, although a little bit more of my time in that year has been freed up.
267080	268781	So, I don't know.
269001	273523	I would love to go, but... I'm not saying no yet.
273844	280847	Not likely right now, just due to the fact that I'm not going to have a lot of free time off work available because I'm going to Mendocino in April.
281539	290421	But, uh, never say never because I have found that flights from here to Chicago, or there's actually a lot of direct flights from SAC to Chicago, so, um, you never know.
290461	291801	And that's where ASAN's at, Chicago, right?
292021	292481	I do believe so.
292541	293342	I do believe so as well.
293722	295962	So, uh, maybe.
297062	301823	And that's more favorable maybe than you might think because, you know, why not?
301883	302343	It might be fun.
302664	308905	Especially, I'll tell you what, that maybe is a hell of a lot more likely to become a yes if we can somehow get in on getting a panel there or something.
309105	309445	Well, I'm
309997	313138	I've got other stuff planned in May and I have to double check my schedule.
314299	316880	But I've wanted to go to ASUN now for a couple years.
317720	318801	And I want to cosplay.
321022	321722	I need my costume.
322802	324283	Probably all three of us won't make it.
324503	326964	But at least maybe if one of the three of us can get out there.
326984	328905	I don't know, Loki, trip to Chicago in your future?
329345	329565	Nope.
330245	331526	The wife won't let you go, will she?
331966	333427	Yep, I'm chained to the house.
333447	334807	I'm like on house arrest.
335708	338008	Well, while I'm still single, I should probably travel.
338028	339249	Because then
339551	340692	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
368351	371172	I can't leave the room because I don't know why.
371252	375053	You need to petition PopCap to make a Bejeweled 3 fast to keep her busy.
375613	380675	That won't... That's only for like a matter of minutes and then she'll get bored of it.
381815	382035	Alright.
382475	385016	We never did realize just how prophetic that t-shirt would be.
387356	388197	It's true, huh?
388297	388857	Game over.
389417	390977	Alright, let's get some more emails.
391378	391698	Okay.
392558	392658	Um...
393459	397402	Hey, OLR, I just wanted to get in my crappy story about the lack of Wiis in the world.
397923	409813	I live in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, and at a specific department store whose name I will not mention, there was what you call a midnight madness sale where people will stay up to midnight trying to get the 15-minute only sales.
410733	414417	Well, in this particular store, the big grand prize draw was a chance to buy a Wii.
415057	419561	Not that one gets free or 50% off, but just to have a chance to purchase one.
420458	422519	I also heard about a guy in Australia purchasing one for $590.
422580	424861	Nintendo, make more Wii's.
425642	429785	Keep up the good work, LLR, PKJR92.
430925	433267	The only way to make your PC go faster is to throw it out a window.
434388	444135	And I think what also probably unfortunately sucks for this person who is emailing us, thank you for the email by the way, is the fact that they do live in a pretty remote area of Canada.
444782	462772	and A, you're in Canada, which is kind of, even though a very important, very large country, is still outside of that trinity of Japan, United States, and the big Europe regions like Germany, France, Britain, basically.
462892	464953	Basically the big ones there in Spain.
465253	469115	I'm not trying to leave anybody out, but I'm saying the ones where gaming is more prevalent there in Europe.
469774	475519	Canada kind of comes after that sometimes with some things like Rock Band we've seen.
475599	479303	So unfortunately sometimes they get the short end of the stick with the Wii shipments as well.
479783	481425	And Nintendo can only make so many of those.
482706	487930	My advice would be though, I don't remember if he said he was trying to get one or whatever, but online.
488431	491814	Because you go to a place like Amazon, they're not going to care if you're in Canada or what have you.
491834	493355	A lot of that's the same for US and Canada.
494116	495917	Unless you're buying toys from Amazon UK.
497102	502366	But that is weird though about the whole raffle to get the opportunity to buy a Wii.
502446	503067	That is weird.
503467	504067	That is kind of weird.
504107	507650	You know I have to order my UK toys from Amazon Canada.
508711	509191	Interesting.
509631	509812	Yes.
510492	511453	Just thought I'd share that with you.
512133	523082	Actdeft wanted to respond to something he heard in Dr. Noir's email and that is that there are a lot of Wiis unsold in Mexico but that's because it costs almost double than it costs in the US because of import fees.
523482	524843	Everyone import them from Mexico.
525509	526889	This is from Mark F. I stand corrected, thank you.
547671	550133	Sky talked about simple baseball games just to chime in.
550173	552274	Bases Loaded was way better than Baseball Stars.
552935	557098	And the best slash easiest baseball game was simply Baseball for the NES.
557418	557938	Fun times.
561301	564403	Moving forward for Robert M. People with your initial names.
566304	567925	Hello and hope you had a nice break.
568906	571208	Hopefully you've ironed out most of the bugs in your new studio.
571648	574510	I keep getting the podcast feed about a day late.
575237	577818	Really like the weird owl for the stupid awards.
578519	580360	And just a quick thought on the last show.
580400	584022	You mentioned Facebook as a verb instead of using it in the sense of friending.
585383	589765	My friend went more the head desk direction.
590105	591306	That is Facebooking.
591646	594488	Someone would literally entail hitting them in the face with a book.
595528	599690	Refreshing and witty comment relating online community sites and physical pain goes here.
600991	604493	You mean like every time I go to MySpace, I feel like I'm going to have an aneurysm.
612356	623178	I was wondering what your opinion would be on the massively multiplayer online sports games, such as an NFL game where all 22 players could be controlled by online gamers.
623258	624518	Hard to coordinate, probably.
625038	626799	I'd like to see how something like that would work.
630185	631745	Brilliant idea, honestly.
633066	634286	I don't know why it's not out there.
634326	635286	People don't know how to work together.
635927	645249	Maybe, yeah, it's partially that and partially probably that, you know, some people, you know, in a football team, you have your standout stars and then you have the other guys.
646049	647870	And who wants to be the other guys?
648150	650371	When you play a video game, you're trying to be something you're not.
650431	651511	I've been on the bench.
652371	658853	Well, that's why it would be like, what was that game that my husband was playing, NFL Pro or something, where...
659477	662438	Your team is all fantasy.
662939	666760	It's some of the greatest players that you've had in sports history.
667581	673544	Or maybe just that you pick from a pool of players.
673564	678526	Your team is actually a really big team that you form with friends, and then so many of you play in matches.
678606	678866	I don't know.
678886	680067	That would be really hard to coordinate, though.
680827	681768	I like the idea.
681948	682888	I like the concept.
683909	686370	The execution would be a little tricky, but I like your concept.
686510	688951	I don't think it can work with a party of more than seven people.
689246	690947	DarkSakura is having a sneeze fit.
690987	695610	So I will praise Blades of Steel a little more in the great, great hockey game it was on the NES.
695630	695750	Yeah.
719137	721118	By the way, I used the Wii gifting feature this week.
722018	722319	I did?
722459	725600	Yes, I used the Wii gifting feature to send my friend in New York a copy of Kid Icarus.
726340	729001	And I tried to send her Mario 3, but the Wii rejected it.
729321	733343	So the Wii is smart enough to not let you send games your friends already have.
733563	740125	Did you see, and I forgot to mention this on our show roll, that Microsoft did the gifting feature now in the U.S.
740305	740886	with points.
741306	743667	You can give other accounts points now.
743867	744567	Where did they do that?
745520	746741	I don't know, but I read it somewhere.
747082	751385	I read it on one of the, like, Joystick or Kotaku.
751565	753506	Is that why Xbox has been broken the past few days?
754287	754787	I don't know.
755387	766976	But that's great for me because, you know, having multiple consoles and, say, if I want to, you know, install, like, a map or something and buy it for each one, I don't have to buy point cards for every single console.
766996	768177	Interesting.
768237	768617	Interesting.
769738	774079	By the way, our entire chat room could hear your power sneezes and say, bless you.
774559	775759	Well, you know what?
775919	778680	My nose feels like a nightmare of pain and suffering.
778900	779400	Sorry to hear it.
779460	780660	So thank you, chat room.
780700	782481	I'm glad you heard me blow my nose, too.
782681	783581	All right, well, any more emails?
783601	784981	I hear you sound like a foghorn.
786181	787482	So, there are emails.
791283	796724	Hey, OLR crew, I found myself unable to sleep one night at three in the morning and popped on your radio feed on iTunes.
797264	798444	And I was able to fall asleep.
800302	816817	and I noticed it was playing much more mellow music than normal is the rotation geared more towards slow calming songs at night or did I just happen upon a random anomaly either way it helps me get to sleep so thank you guys keep up the awesome show AZHP you're welcome and you can thank the total randomness because our playlist is the same
817358	845475	All day long, we don't do anything special at night Although, maybe we should I am going to be changing the playlist up Because I have a break from work here for another week So I'm going to be working on a lot of OLR stuff And one thing I'm going to be doing is cleaning out the 24-7 show And putting in some more classic game tunes And, yeah, just cycling some stuff in and out So, check it out Alright, two emails left, thank god Alright Because we got a bunch, this is a sample
846607	850851	So I updated my PSP the other day and was very pleased with the internet radio edition.
851531	856536	Given the fact that I listened to your show on my PSP, it would be even better if I could listen to it live on there as well.
856976	858878	It would be a nice Christmas present, please.
861320	864442	We don't know how to make that happen just yet, but we have to get on that.
864763	865583	Loki, you gotta figure that out.
865603	866604	Don't look at me, I don't know how to do it.
868085	872229	You have to basically run a relay through Shoutcast.
872249	873450	Oh, it has to be Shoutcast time.
875125	875605	We'll see.
875685	882828	I want to say somebody sent me an email about some Shoutcast stuff, so I will look into that as the week goes on.
883348	890230	I would assume, well, maybe you could probably broadcast on Shoutcast and Live365 at the same time.
891490	895932	Or we could just leave Live365 and do Shoutcast with as many people as we want on the feed, but we'll see.
896553	896873	We'll see.
898694	899674	Anything is a possibility.
899714	903036	But I can say, I do know you can listen to all games on your PSP.
903156	904676	They did figure out how to set it up.
904996	910078	So if nothing else, you can always listen to our syndicated runs that air on allgames.com on Monday nights and Tuesday mornings.
910719	911679	Well, there's more to that email.
912259	913059	Okay.
913300	918121	Also, I'd like to note that when I listen to you guys, you always find a way to make me laugh, no matter what kind of mood I'm in.
918622	922423	So thank you, and I wish you all a very Merry Christmas and many more Happy New Years to come.
922623	923323	Happy Holidays.
923464	924464	Mouthpiece, Osfer.
925066	925666	Thank you.
925826	930029	And I want to say, TigerClaw says, I can listen to OLR on my PSP using PSP radio.
930709	931710	So I guess it is possible.
932130	932690	Last email.
932871	933011	Ow.
934531	936152	Maybe share that with everybody.
936473	937253	TigerClaw, send Loki an email.
937273	938814	Would you like to share with the rest of the class?
938834	939574	Send Loki an email.
939694	940515	Don't send me an email.
940555	941335	Just post it in the chat.
941355	942476	I don't want to get into it right now.
942516	943917	Fine, then post it in the chat, but I'm not reading it.
943957	945078	All right, email.
946178	948319	Hey, Sky, Loki, and DarkSakura.
948660	949100	Hi.
950987	953008	I'm going to start this out with a true fact.
953128	957351	OLR is the best, funniest, and most informative and engaging show in the world.
958331	961793	You guys, and girl, have done a great job, and for that you should be commended.
962694	963834	Good, somebody commend us, please.
966095	967096	One question, though.
967416	971898	I just got a PlayStation 3 for Christmas, and the only game I have for it right now is Motorstorm.
972259	974460	What would be the top three games you would recommend for me to get?
975440	976501	Marvel Ultimate Alliance,
978612	979633	Sell your PS3.
979873	980313	No.
981455	982235	It was a gift.
982896	983777	Alright.
984658	987841	Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Resistance, Fall of Man.
988041	988542	Oblivion.
988822	989183	Oblivion.
989303	990684	Absolutely Oblivion.
990804	992827	Those are actually the three I named right there.
993627	997772	Oblivion, Resistance,
1001460	1002680	Marvel, if you're into that.
1002880	1004121	I mean, obviously, Jamie's into that.
1004141	1004821	It's a fun game.
1005501	1009222	I'm trying to think if there's something else that maybe was something... It has a lot of awesome... Heavenly Sword.
1009722	1010802	Yeah.
1011242	1011942	Is probably fun.
1012082	1013143	If you have two hours.
1014423	1015963	SSJ100 Matt's recommending Warhawk.
1017304	1017664	There you go.
1019404	1023505	Resistance, I would say probably Uncharted, Drake's Fortune.
1024745	1027206	And depending on how you feel about...
1028123	1029884	Ratchet and Clank, Ratchet and Clank.
1030225	1033107	Otherwise, I don't know.
1033887	1034728	Motorstorm's pretty good.
1034908	1037870	But if you bought your PS3, you probably already have Motorstorm.
1037971	1038531	That's what he said.
1038551	1039612	All he has now is Motorstorm.
1039992	1041493	Well, then... Oblivion.
1043315	1045296	Nah, I wouldn't do Oblivion.
1045576	1045957	Fine.
1046297	1046877	It's old.
1046937	1049780	I mean, they're going to come out with something new year and buy it, and then all of a sudden, oh, crap.
1050020	1051301	Well, actually, I guess it is cheap.
1051361	1053362	If you don't buy the expansion, it's like a $30 game, so...
1055708	1057489	and a bunch of Blu-ray movies.
1057989	1061470	A lot of the PS3 games are really cheap now and you'll find a lot of them used.
1061650	1064190	Seth is saying Unreal Tournament in our chatroom.
1064350	1065451	That's probably not a bad pick.
1065551	1069852	Unreal Tournament and Warhawk, depending on how you feel about online-only multiplayer games.
1071312	1078954	Unreal Tournament 3, if you don't like Unreal really, really fast trigger-happy games, then you might not like that.
1080094	1080374	Alright.
1082075	1082815	Is that it for emails?
1084150	1087252	No, there was more to that one, because people keep interrupting me.
1087292	1087852	Oh, sorry.
1088493	1088853	Sir.
1090654	1101681	Also, I think Loki shouldn't get the bad rap he does from blasting Sony, because Sony really does leave us gamers out to dry in terms of innovation, besides the PS3, and new hardware such as new peripherals for the PSP.
1102242	1104063	So until they get wise, keep going strong.
1104243	1105304	Canada salutes you.
1105784	1109726	Sincerely, Josh G. Well, thank you, Canada.
1110547	1111327	I salute Canada.
1111368	1111908	I love Canada.
1112655	1115756	And I like this, what's the difference between Windows 95 and Windows 98?
1115936	1116696	Answer, three years.
1117997	1119157	That joke is like ten years old.
1119337	1121277	I know, but I think it's great that somebody put that in their email.
1122958	1125759	Alright, now we're done with emails, yes?
1126579	1129300	We are done, and I'm saving, I'm leaving out that one for you.
1129560	1130800	Alright, thank you very much.
1131360	1137622	Alright, let's get back into some news, and then we're going to get back into the Skype line and go over July and the rest of the year.
1138208	1140510	Release dates, or lack thereof.
1140770	1143232	I thought I would at least open it up if anybody has any release dates.
1143272	1143813	How about the US, Loki?
1143833	1149258	There's not much, and from what I gather, these four games are apparently a GameStop exclusive.
1149678	1161068	Good for them, I guess, scoring these awesome games, all of which are from a wonderful company named Conspiracy Entertainment, who is known for their extremely high-quality games.
1162133	1166256	Okay, no, not really, but you can get four racing games this week.
1166757	1169659	Rig Racer 2, which has you racing big rigs.
1170299	1181408	Kawasaki Quad Bikes, Monster Trucks Off-Road, and then Classic British Motor Racing.
1183870	1184671	Let me just save you time.
1184691	1186792	What exactly is Classic British Motor Racing?
1186812	1187793	Like an Aston Martin?
1188073	1189334	No, it's like racing minis.
1190115	1190255	It's
1191534	1192735	None of these games are that great.
1193036	1200202	Although, they do have a game coming out, though, that's going to be a jet ski racing game, and it looks just like Wave Race 64.
1201424	1206849	So, that has potential, but I would, if you can rent these, go for it.
1207870	1208470	They're cheap.
1208690	1213535	I think they're like $19.99, so if you have money that you want to throw away, I can tell you one thing, don't
1214367	1241359	buy monster trucks off-road because monster trucks they had off-road arena or something like that that really sucked and then there is off-road extreme special edition which got like a one on IGN it's like a piece of shit most of these are crap but just kind of know it going into it so that's all you can find this week next week I promise you better games how about the UK Jamie?
1241599	1243520	I'll give some highlights for what's coming out next week
1244551	1249914	Dancing Stage Universe, Myst on DS, SingStar on PS3, Sonic Rivals 2, and another Yu-Gi-Oh game.
1250054	1255377	But I'll go over the big massive list later.
1274329	1275169	How about the Virtual Console?
1302051	1303531	And we did get Blaze of Steel here last week.
1303571	1305712	It's so weird the way they've been releasing those games.
1305752	1309993	Like, you would think there'd be some pattern to it, but it really just seems like it's just kind of a crapshoot.
1312134	1315595	This is the part where I would go over Japanese releases, but there is nothing.
1315775	1317475	Not a damn thing I feel like mentioning.
1317775	1318576	So, that's it.
1318676	1319496	No Japanese releases.
1320404	1323225	So that being said, we are going to open up the Skype line.
1323245	1324845	1-877-GAME-OLR.
1324985	1326725	Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
1327185	1330586	And we're going to go over with you guys, our listeners, the last few months of the year.
1330606	1337247	And we also want to get your picks for the best game of 2007 and the worst game of 2007.
1338167	1339348	So go ahead and give us a call.
1339368	1347109	And remember, if you've never used Skype before, you might want to give Echo123 a call to make sure you sound okay.
1348206	1350788	Unless you're calling over the phone, then there's really nothing you can do to test.
1352549	1360215	So, since there is a little bit of a delay between the live and when the people hear it, they probably don't know it's open yet, so we're just trying to fill in a little bit of time here.
1361536	1367720	Later on in the program, we're going to be going over our top five lists of the five most fun games we played this year.
1368541	1371823	Then we'll tally it up, what overall was the best and the worst game of 2007.
1372264	1374425	And we'll give some predictions for 2008.
1374846	1378088	And we haven't forgotten the FUs either.
1380994	1385655	And of course, a lot of our regular callers are gone this week on vacation.
1386855	1387716	Away for the holidays.
1388316	1391697	So I think that's where, if you're wondering, why isn't our phone ringing off the hook?
1391717	1392777	Who leaves for New Year's?
1392797	1394498	I understand Christmas, but I don't know.
1394518	1396958	I think people are still gone from Christmas is what happens.
1400579	1401120	Oh, well.
1403980	1405601	So what's going to happen if nobody calls?
1407259	1408040	I'll do July.
1408440	1409481	Someone call us!
1409861	1411662	Or we can do it, we can always play with the chat room.
1411702	1412543	People are just being shy.
1412583	1413804	We have plenty of people in chat.
1413824	1416286	There's over, almost 50 people in chat.
1416466	1418107	So, I don't know what the heck's going on there.
1418447	1419768	Pick up your damn phone.
1419808	1421250	Don't you people have phones?
1421350	1422050	And call us.
1422070	1423891	Some folks are waiting for certain months.
1424892	1426433	No, you don't wait.
1426994	1428435	You do this on our terms.
1429856	1431497	Pick up the goddamn phone.
1431517	1432078	Hey, we're getting a call.
1432098	1433138	Your goddamn phone call.
1433459	1434079	We're getting a call.
1434479	1435880	Hi, here on Orange Lodge Radio.
1435900	1436381	Who's this?
1436481	1436641	Orange.
1438574	1441036	Oh, this is the Escapist.
1441196	1441936	Escapist is here.
1442176	1442857	I'm sorry, who's this?
1444818	1445299	Escapist.
1445779	1447400	Well, Escapist, how are you, sir?
1447441	1448001	How are you doing?
1450283	1451364	I'm doing wonderful, yourself?
1451804	1452324	Very good.
1452364	1456968	There's a little bit of a delay, but I notice you're calling us from Canada, so that's probably why there's a bit of a delay.
1456988	1458269	Okay.
1459350	1459570	Okay.
1460034	1465339	Alright, so I'm going to go through this rather quickly here, and we want to hear your thoughts on some of the highlights of 2007.
1465960	1468642	So let's talk first a little bit about July.
1469903	1478071	July, episode 237, was when a brain game in the UK was pulled over the use of the word spastic.
1478111	1484977	And I apologize if I offended anyone by saying that word just then, but we kind of hear in the US go, well, that's not a big deal, but in the UK...
1485823	1486384	Thanks for watching!
1505777	1509481	Episode 239 was the week that Mini E3 happened.
1510361	1517488	That was when Mario Kart Wii was announced for the Wii and Cena was announced for the 360 and the PSP was announced that had a redesign.
1518148	1521051	And just in general, kind of the changed E3.
1521151	1526756	I mean, do you think, Loki, the E3 is going to be very similar to how it was this year, next year?
1526876	1528438	Or do you think they're going to get kind of
1529341	1533865	you know, especially since they're moving back to the LA Convention Center, do you think they're going to get a little bit of maybe what they missed?
1534605	1536086	Um, I think it's going to be about the same.
1536627	1547295	Speaking of which, you need to talk to whoever was supposed to invite us last year and get them to invite, or this year I should say, and be ready for this next year because I want to go.
1547955	1548636	I do too, we'll see.
1549196	1556302	Um, anyways, uh, yeah, all I remember from Mini 3 is how disappointed I was with the Mario Kart and, um,
1557054	1558074	Zapper announcements.
1558435	1567858	Not necessarily Mario Kart, because Mario Kart's really fucking awesome, but the fact that it comes with a plastic steering wheel, all these peripherals, they were like, God, this is a stupid idea.
1567938	1569198	Who keeps releasing this crap?
1569218	1570819	And Nintendo's like, Hey!
1571239	1572460	We're gonna do it too!
1572940	1574180	That makes it a good idea, right?
1574200	1579442	And then the Zapper, you know, what we saw was like a pretty cool attachment, you know, kind of like the Nunchuck.
1580262	1583123	And then all of a sudden, now it's this piece of plastic crap.
1584224	1584564	I don't know...
1585592	1586733	It wasn't all that exciting.
1587073	1589315	Escapist, did you follow him in E3 news?
1589355	1592158	What did you think of this year's E3, new and improved?
1595160	1597042	I kind of really ignored it this year.
1597242	1599264	I don't know, I've never been a big fan of E3 to begin with.
1600004	1603707	It was like a whole bunch of excitement for a couple months and whatever.
1604168	1605349	What makes you not a fan of E3?
1610213	1611594	Just too much information at one time.
1611634	1613816	I get kind of overloaded and overexcited a bit.
1614779	1616060	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1638001	1639841	Which kind of made a lot of us go, wow.
1640101	1640762	And it did win.
1640942	1642722	And it did end up winning the Emmy, actually.
1642782	1649383	But, of course, the South Park Wow episode integrated the World of Warcraft very well with the South Park kids.
1649703	1652764	But, of course, the one thing I remember was, ma'am, bathroom.
1653924	1654364	Bathroom.
1655664	1655924	All right.
1656304	1664866	Escapist, out of those stories, the brain game, the price cut, Mini 3, and South Park World of Warcraft, what do you think had the biggest impact for 2007's gaming?
1669251	1676436	Well, even though I just undermined it earlier, I'd definitely say the E3 there, just because, you know, it was a whole new year for E3, a new direction they wanted to go.
1677116	1681540	It's still the same kind of information that got released from what I saw, but just a lot less people going to it.
1682420	1683101	I think you're right.
1683181	1687604	I think even though it is different, I think it definitely was the highlight of the month and the year in some ways.
1687624	1695570	I think the way that they did E3, I mean, besides the multiple hotels and it being kind of difficult to travel from one place to another...
1696224	1697566	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1718832	1723154	I think works a lot better for me than having to just navigate all around because I end up missing stuff.
1723814	1724295	I agree.
1724875	1727316	I said this before on the show.
1727876	1738521	Two years ago, the last big E3, I knew something was wrong when Paris Hilton was there and drawing these big crowds because she had some fucking crappy cell phone game coming out, right?
1738721	1739682	She got the name wrong on.
1739962	1742923	You knew that something was broken with E3 at that point.
1743303	1743543	Yeah.
1744384	1744524	So...
1745464	1745804	Interesting.
1745824	1748526	Alright, well let's move on to August, Escapist.
1748566	1752488	We're going to go over the four stories and tell us which one you think had the most impact.
1752908	1760352	Episode 241 kicked off August and it was another WoW story because that was the week that BlizzCon happened and Wrath of the Lich King was announced.
1760412	1768336	And of course, obviously, we even had some folks, I remember Extifer, one of our regular guests, actually went to BlizzCon and came back with a full report.
1768676	1772658	And of course, a lot of WoW players are very excited about the Wrath of the Lich King expansion.
1773537	1781042	Episode 242 was the week that the news was breaking that the Xbox 360 Core system was being phased out of stores.
1781062	1781922	The price dropped, too.
1782082	1792608	Yeah, when Best Buy started to phase them out of their computers and Target was phasing them out of their computers, the systems were slowly disappearing, which kind of made people go, hmm, what's going on there?
1792628	1798011	And then, of course, subsequently we learned about the Elite and all that stuff.
1798452	1799272	Well, the Elite had already been out.
1799332	1802494	No, I'm sorry, the Elite had been out, the Arcade and the other stuff.
1804052	1831911	episode 243 Toys R Us breaks the Bioshock street date Bioshock came out towards the end of August and Toys R Us broke the street date and people were taking pictures of receipts and that stuff was all over the internet and then episode 244 in August was the week we talked about a brand new game Konami was putting out called New International Track in a Field and what made this story stand out the fact that there was going to be a cartoon version of Serial Killer Pyramid Head in the game a little chibi pyramid head game
1832706	1846210	Now, the game is not out yet, but we were just talking about the announcement, although I should say that if you saw the Christmas cards that some of the big game companies put out, Konami actually had a little picture of Chibi Pyramid Head in there, and he was opening up a box with new gloves in it.
1846710	1847530	It was so cute.
1847730	1848791	He just reminded me of something.
1848831	1849151	What's that?
1850351	1853372	My husband's boss gave him one of the Portal Christmas cards.
1853912	1854212	Nice.
1856033	1856833	From Aperture Science?
1856973	1857453	I stole it.
1857873	1858333	Very good.
1859254	1860574	You got a card, but I stole it.
1861550	1872373	Alright, anyhow, escapists, out of those stories, BlizzCon, Xbox 360 Core phased out, Toys R Us breaking a street date, a new international track and field, or anything you can think of, what do you think had the most impact?
1872413	1876094	I know that's a little bit of a tougher month, because it was after E3, but what do you think had the most impact?
1879695	1880255	Oh, jeepers.
1881636	1885497	For me, I definitely have to say the Toys R Us thing was kind of a
1886294	1887075	Big deal there.
1887335	1891458	Another insight into the distribution chain there that people are really excited to get their games now.
1891538	1896062	And Toys R Us isn't really paying attention.
1896362	1896662	I don't know.
1896822	1898323	I'm kind of a shot in the head.
1898544	1900305	I'm excited to be on air, that's all.
1900545	1901306	No, it's all good.
1901346	1911834	No, that's a very good point that you're saying there is that, you know, a big chain like Toys R Us you would think would know better, but sometimes down on the lower levels, you know, folks kind of make their mistakes and all that stuff, you know.
1912213	1913414	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1937452	1940515	How many people were actually playing Halo 3 before that came out?
1955123	1955403	I did.
1956344	1956824	Excellent point.
1956844	1958284	I'd already beaten it before it came up.
1958344	1958885	There you go.
1958965	1960485	And that was another huge one, Halo 3.
1961266	1961786	Absolutely.
1961826	1963547	And that was in August as well, right?
1963687	1964087	October.
1964907	1965387	September.
1965527	1966348	September, almost.
1966428	1966748	End of September.
1966768	1967648	When we get into the next month.
1968168	1968409	All right.
1968769	1978833	Well, Escapist, before we let you go, we have a few more things to ask you, and that would be, what, in your opinion, was the worst freaking game of 2007 that should be avoided at all costs?
1981943	1987305	Well, normally I would go with the obvious pick like the artist, except I actually didn't play it, so that would kind of be a cop-out on my part.
1988505	1989286	Well, that's fair enough.
1989546	1990486	Then we have to change it up.
1990626	1991606	What do you think then?
1994587	1997769	I'm going to have to be annoying and say I didn't really like Call of Duty all that much.
1997869	1999829	Call of Duty 4 never really did anything for me.
2000049	2002070	Maybe it might be I'm not a true shooter fan or whatnot.
2002090	2004371	Maybe it's because I had a horrible time online playing it, but...
2005379	2006520	Adam Montana
2028863	2030064	Hannah Montana was the worst game?
2030184	2031244	No, it was the best, I think.
2031264	2031785	Gears of War.
2031805	2032365	No, it was different.
2032465	2033365	No, yes, it was Gears of War.
2033385	2035326	I think somebody said Gears of War was the worst game that came out.
2035907	2038868	Yeah, I think it was Michelle from Video Game Outsiders.
2038948	2039349	I think.
2039449	2039829	I don't remember.
2039849	2040709	I'd have to go back and listen.
2040749	2041110	But anyway.
2041630	2041890	All right.
2042190	2042530	Never mind.
2042550	2043191	That was last year.
2043311	2044491	That was so 2006.
2044831	2045292	Let's talk about 2007.
2045332	2049414	The best game of 2007, Escapist, in your opinion?
2053156	2053236	Uh...
2054116	2056857	Last time I tried to avoid the obvious pick, but I have to go the obvious with this one.
2056877	2057857	It would have to be the Orange Box.
2057877	2060278	It's probably the best gaming value I've ever seen in my freaking life.
2061838	2065339	Five classic games all crammed in one bundle, and ignore the Portal.
2066239	2067740	I can't say I disagree with you, sir.
2067780	2072621	The Orange Box is a great deal, and that right there makes it definitely a worthy candidate for Game of the Year.
2072741	2076562	And then you have Portal in there as well, which of course is a brilliant game in itself.
2077443	2079803	Escapists, thanks so much for being on the show tonight.
2079843	2081784	Even though we had a little bit of a delay with the cross...
2083154	2084775	Thank you very much for having me.
2084795	2085956	I hope you have a great 2008.
2085996	2086617	All right, take care, buddy.
2086717	2087177	All right, you too.
2087197	2087378	Bye-bye.
2087398	2089820	Unfortunately, because of the distance there, he was breaking up a little bit.
2106431	2106691	All right.
2107652	2107992	Let's see.
2108012	2111113	We're going to move on to September.
2111673	2115455	We're going to get a call here and talk about September and October.
2115935	2118897	So the Skype line is open at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2119457	2120237	September and October.
2120477	2123719	And remember, if you don't get through for this one, there is still November and December.
2123819	2124839	We still have that to go over.
2125339	2126320	So let's see who's on the line.
2126340	2127280	Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.
2127300	2127641	Who's this?
2128961	2129101	GS68.
2129721	2131862	Hey, you were the one that was waiting for September, weren't you?
2132503	2133683	Yeah.
2133843	2134103	Oh, wow.
2134163	2135304	You lucked out, didn't you?
2136252	2138032	because somebody else might have beat you to it.
2138072	2138813	All right, well, here it is.
2139173	2140253	We got September and October.
2140313	2141173	Let's start with September.
2141393	2142773	Now, September was our biggest month.
2142833	2147274	There were five Sundays in the month of September, so we did more shows in September than any other month.
2148015	2153116	Starting off with episode 245, Neo Geo titles were announced for the Nintendo Wii's virtual console.
2153476	2160177	So, of course, a lot of people were like, OMG, Magician's Lair and Magician Lord and OMG, Fatal Fury and all this stuff.
2160217	2162858	And what always surprised me about this was that
2164295	2171821	Fatal Fury is like $9 on the Nintendo Wii, or you can get the souped-up version with the improved HD and online play for $5.
2172161	2175424	Or you can get the original card for like $100.
2176685	2179727	Well, I think that kind of goes out the window now with Virtual Console.
2180127	2183570	Actually, Jamie, you collect the old-school Neo Geo cartridges.
2183590	2183930	I have some.
2183950	2184730	You've paid hundreds of dollars.
2185431	2187212	But you do have some that you've paid hundreds of dollars for, right?
2187232	2190194	The only one that I paid, and I got it for $200 and something...
2191579	2198961	was I got a chance to buy King of Fighters 2000 for relatively cheap.
2199881	2202142	And so that's the one that we've paid the most for.
2202242	2206743	But we've got like Samurai Shodown, Samurai Shodown 2, Baseball Stars.
2207603	2209163	What do you think as a collector?
2209203	2211824	What do you think about all this stuff now coming out on Virtual Console for less than $10?
2212564	2212964	Good.
2214464	2216825	Because I don't have the money to spend on this crap.
2217505	2218945	Although I did want Samurai Shodown 5.
2219086	2221066	I would pay the money for that.
2221940	2246618	Well, episode 246 was the episode where Sony was sending out to all the critics out there a review guide for Lair Well, IGN kind of like posted it, but they were sending it to several critics This whole little guide on Lair And they said, no, we're not trying to sway people's decisions But they just want to make sure everybody understood the game And the six axis control, right?
2247722	2249382	But it was a very nicely bound little book.
2250143	2253663	Episode number 247 was the episode where Project Hammer was cancelled.
2253683	2257424	I wonder if any of those review guides went on the, you know, old eBay.
2258104	2259484	You know, we never looked.
2259544	2259985	We should have.
2260225	2261525	We could have put one up here in the studio.
2261545	2263205	It would have been fun.
2263225	2265906	Anyway, 247 was when Project Hammer was cancelled.
2266166	2271547	This was a game that looked to be a hell of a lot of fun when we saw it at E3, but apparently somebody at Nintendo decided it wasn't.
2272145	2272525	Good enough.
2272745	2277308	Sorry, Project Hammer reminds me too much of MC Hammer, and that's like so ten years ago.
2277508	2277929	Exactly.
2279250	2280390	Project MC Hammer.
2280490	2281351	Reverend Hammer.
2284273	2287615	Episode number 248 was the week that Smash Bros.
2287715	2290097	was announced that it was going to be going online.
2290537	2292958	And of course, that caused a lot of people to go, Woo!
2292998	2295700	Of course, later on it was announced that it still has friend codes.
2296641	2298222	And the whole...
2299656	2306498	The whole like thing with people just getting in the computer, taking over and stuff Okay, you know what I heard?
2306518	2324725	Oh yeah, yeah, that's weird I'm trying to get off topic here a little bit Apparently, what was it, not Brothers in Arms Medal of Honor 2, or Heroes 2 Is online, 32 players, and if I remember correctly Does not have friends codes for the Wii Nice So why can't everybody do that?
2326326	2327266	Your guess is as good as mine
2329889	2332792	So that was episode 248, and of course it was a five-week month.
2333332	2343422	Episode 249, that was the week that the Sex Pistols announced that they were getting back together to re-record the song Anarchy in the UK for Guitar Hero 3.
2344258	2368006	and of course this is big news I think not so much like just the song itself or what have you but just the fact that you know video games and especially a series like Guitar Hero 3 has transcended the music game genre so much that bands that had been broken up were coming back together for the purposes of recording for the game I mean that in my mind is huge especially as an old school music gaming fan so
2368906	2370668	I have my own from episode 247, I think.
2370688	2370908	What's that?
2371068	2374111	It's one about the New Jersey parents being upset about the Wii Zapper.
2394404	2397165	You know, I was looking at that one when I was going through the show rules today.
2397205	2399827	Yeah, the New Jersey parents being upset about the Wii Zapper.
2399887	2401467	Why do you think that was the biggest impact?
2402508	2410391	Well, I mean, like, 20 years ago, the Wii Zapper, like, I mean, the NES Zapper, I mean, no one complained about that.
2410491	2414373	And then Super Nintendo had a Super Skill.
2414473	2415574	I don't think anyone complained.
2415834	2417835	And a whole bunch of systems after that.
2417875	2421036	But, like, a gun proof on the Wii?
2421556	2422757	Oh my gosh, you must ban this.
2425287	2427468	Well, I have a pick for the news story.
2427788	2428648	What do you think, Loki?
2428748	2430109	Halo 3 is released!
2430189	2430709	Come on!
2430749	2431650	I mean, seriously!
2431830	2433331	Everyone's like, oh my god, Halo 3!
2433851	2436493	Yeah, so, that's a big news story.
2436533	2437233	Yeah, but I don't know.
2437273	2438274	Well, yeah, it was.
2438594	2442976	I think the reason why it was overlooked here is because, you know, it kind of... I know, we don't care about Halo 3.
2443016	2449880	Well, no, it's not that, because I do care about Halo 3, but just that most of the Halo 3 news was everything leading up to its release.
2450180	2450640	You know what I mean?
2450960	2452201	Yeah, I wonder.
2453700	2454401	Okay, how about this?
2454521	2456222	Episode 246 or whatever.
2456522	2458744	It is announced that you cannot put the helmets on your cat.
2459644	2460465	That is disappointing.
2460905	2462326	Biggest news of the month.
2462686	2464147	Biggest news of 2007, honestly.
2466129	2466669	You okay, Jamie?
2468110	2468751	Blink, blink, blink.
2470452	2471713	Would you try to put the helmet on your cat?
2472073	2472433	On Shermie?
2473214	2474235	Shermie's too stupid.
2474375	2474635	Alright.
2475175	2475676	Yes, GS68.
2475716	2480219	Wait, can we put it on the... Can we put a helmet on the ferrets?
2481323	2482504	Can we put the helmet on the ferret?
2482524	2483124	We probably could.
2483164	2484665	If we could find the ferret, we could.
2484685	2488667	The ferret ran hiding since Rob threatened to put him down the food trash compactor.
2488827	2489407	I did, I did.
2489567	2491608	I think Skirgo's the penguin.
2492668	2494449	Possibly the new penguin from Argentina.
2494469	2495790	The penguin is frightening.
2495870	2496630	He is pretty fierce.
2496730	2497811	He's very punk rock.
2498251	2499452	All right, let's go on to October.
2499472	2500632	Our show's going to go on all night.
2501393	2502373	October, episode 250.
2502433	2505635	That was a big week for us because it was our 250th episode.
2506035	2507996	That was also the week that Nintendo...
2508533	2508953	Thanks for watching!
2523786	2524387	Working episodes.
2547472	2548333	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2568749	2573473	I'm so excited right now and it's going to be very disappointing when the game actually comes out.
2573573	2576456	And I wonder if he's going to kill Hitler at the end.
2576476	2576736	I hope so.
2594650	2596071	That would be definitely the coup de grace.
2596691	2605758	And then the last show we taped in October, episode number 253, was the week that it was discovered that Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3 are not playing nice.
2606018	2608580	The controllers were not compatible with each other.
2609001	2611783	If you wanted to play both games, you had to use your Guitar Hero 2 controllers.
2612443	2615625	But Guitar Hero 3 on at least PlayStation 3 was not compatible with each other.
2616026	2617667	We've been using our Xbox ones.
2618223	2620824	Xbox, I think, works one way, but it doesn't work the other way.
2620844	2621605	It works with Rock Band.
2621765	2624486	Yeah, it works with Rock Band, but the controller doesn't work with Guitar Hero 3.
2624846	2626767	It'd be better if they made a controller that didn't break.
2627647	2632990	Or just that they just would let them both be, you know, a lot of people are like, this just sucks that they can't get along.
2634090	2635671	And I agree, it sucks that they can't get along.
2636011	2639353	What do you think GS68 was the biggest, or if you have one of your own, feel free to share.
2639673	2641934	Nintendo offering Wii condoms, Smash Bros.
2641974	2647096	delayed, Capcom announced the Street Fighter 4 and Bionic Commando, or Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3 just can't play nice.
2648693	2649433	I'm not too sure.
2649493	2652534	I'm not... I don't really remember October too well.
2653855	2661917	But... I would probably guess... I would probably guess 354, the Wiimote gloves, I guess.
2662497	2663337	The Wiimote gloves?
2664458	2665438	Yeah, that was pretty big.
2665538	2665858	I don't know.
2665898	2667679	Me, personally, I would say the Smash Bros.
2667699	2667939	delay.
2667979	2671480	I know that seems weird, because then you kind of go, well, that's a 2008 story.
2671740	2677862	But that was a game that people were so looking forward to, and especially on the Wii, that really needed some powerhouse games.
2677902	2678322	Although, I guess...
2678717	2679458	I guess it didn't.
2679878	2681600	It did pretty well this Christmas regardless.
2682020	2684282	But, you know, so many people were looking forward to that game.
2684322	2686424	It was just a real disappointment when that game got delayed.
2686604	2689227	If most of it were to delay, I'd be playing it right now.
2690067	2690628	We all would.
2691168	2692330	We probably wouldn't be doing this show.
2692350	2693410	We would be playing Smash Bros.
2693431	2693971	Brawl right now.
2694912	2699396	And that's, you know, again, all the more reason why that game's got to be twice as good.
2700077	2703199	Or, you know, people are going to kind of go, oh, we waited all this time for this?
2703480	2703780	You know what?
2704397	2708458	Given all these delays, I have a feeling people are going to start calling it Super Smash Bros.
2708498	2708939	Forever.
2709319	2711079	I think somebody did earlier in chat, actually.
2711239	2711820	Yeah, that was me.
2712320	2717001	Alright, GS68, what in your opinion was the worst freaking game of 2007?
2717061	2729306	I haven't played a lot of crappy games that were released in 2007, but I might have... I'd probably give it to Initial D4.
2731934	2733655	Initial D4.
2733715	2734396	Initial D4.
2734436	2735256	Why initial D4?
2736697	2758831	Well, mainly because it wasn't programmed so, like, apparently there's this whole speed limit system where if you go too fast on a certain corner, your wheel locks and your acceleration suffers and there's this penalty cancel glitch where you hit the brake to remove the acceleration problem and from what I've read, like,
2759591	2768195	The recent official initial D tournament is the last one they're going to do because I've read that initial D4 is not doing very well in Japan.
2768335	2774898	In fact, over in Hong Kong, for example, version 3 is doing better than initial D4.
2775158	2777679	Wow, that is something else.
2778019	2782681	That's a bummer that it really sucked it up on its fourth version.
2783042	2785042	I haven't even really played that one.
2785062	2786143	I played initial D3, though.
2786163	2786743	That's a fun time.
2786843	2788484	Anyway, I'm sorry, go ahead.
2789919	2795343	Yeah, and... Yeah, and what else?
2796824	2798905	I was going to say... Like the tuning system for the game.
2799806	2807812	Like... If you want to... Sorry.
2808693	2809053	That's alright.
2810314	2813737	You were going to say another game that you thought was the worst of the year?
2813957	2814898	No, actually, no.
2814918	2816199	I was going to bring up the...
2816974	2820341	whole customizing shop feature instead of
2822024	2839017	You have to eject your card three times just to get to that, so you have to point to another continuous screen, eject your card, and then put your coins in, and then start the game again, so that way you can get to the tuning shop faster.
2839298	2843201	In other words, it's a way to keep sucking up your money and sucking up your tokens.
2843881	2851007	Actually, that would only be in the case of if you had discounted continuous, like five coins to start and four coins to continue.
2851027	2851087	Hmm.
2852541	2852881	Interesting.
2853722	2860206	Well, okay, let's move on and stop talking about games that suck and let's talk about the best freaking game of 2007 in your opinion.
2860226	2861387	What was the best game in your opinion?
2863388	2864469	Maximum Tune 3.
2866170	2866570	Interesting.
2866610	2869652	You must be a real racing game fan because you got both for your best and worst.
2869933	2872234	Why was Maximum Tune 3 your best game of the year?
2873595	2875656	I like what they did with the battle system.
2875696	2881160	Instead of picking a set course, you can now pick the route partway through the game.
2881857	2889683	They also added new courses, like, you can now race on the whole Wangen line instead of just, like, a six-kilometer stretch, which was pretty cool.
2890864	2894367	The soundtrack was pretty cool, more Yuzuka Shiro stuff.
2894607	2895328	Absolutely.
2896128	2903874	And the Ghost Bell system, like, the whole idea of racing a virtual opponent instead of them having to be there.
2903894	2911100	Yeah, I've been listening to the soundtrack to Maximum Tune 3 in my car recently, actually.
2911160	2911260	It's
2911727	2914868	And the thing I find about it, though, is if I listen to it too much, I drive too fast.
2914908	2917508	I speed way more often when I'm listening to Wangan music than anything else.
2917948	2920149	So there you go.
2920229	2920849	Go ahead.
2921549	2924430	It's in my CD player like 80% to 90% of the time.
2926290	2932012	I think it's music that was designed to put the pedal to the floor, and it happens in my real car.
2932052	2933032	That's the only unfortunate thing.
2934775	2944461	I think the soundtrack and the graphics are meant to give the game a rave-ish look.
2944601	2951606	Several years ago, there was a game called Wangan Midnight, and the graphics and soundtrack were nothing like Maximum Tunes.
2954427	2959030	Sometimes it happens that you have a series that's kind of similar, but I don't know.
2960151	2960911	What are you talking about?
2961732	2962232	Nothing.
2962972	2963593	There were older...
2964694	2970259	One Good Midnight Games released in 2001, and they were based on Tokyo Extreme Racer.
2971740	2975343	And they looked and sounded nothing like Maximum Tune.
2975983	2979066	I guess Maximum Tune was made to be more arcade-friendly.
2981828	2982448	I guess it's true.
2982509	2986232	Well, One Good Midnight was actually... I was finding the stuff on the manga.
2988413	2990375	Yeah, it was a manga.
2990395	2990475	Yeah.
2991698	3002461	Alright, well, hey, GS68, we've got to let you go because we've got some more months to go over, but I'll leave you with this thought of us all raving in the car right now.
3004641	3006322	Let's drop some ecstasy while it's hot.
3006342	3006922	No, just kidding.
3007462	3011723	Alright, we've got to let you go, GS68, but thank you so much and have a great 2008, alright?
3012343	3012943	Thanks, you too.
3013183	3013904	Alright, take care, buddy.
3016044	3019245	Alright, we're looking for one more call to help us close out the year.
3020046	3020646	What is up, my friend?
3020666	3021647	Nothing much, just waiting till tomorrow.
3021667	3021987	What's tomorrow?
3022007	3022548	Waiting for that ball.
3043206	3047249	You know, that ball dropping in that middle of that big city on the face of the earth?
3047489	3048770	Oh yes, I've heard of that before.
3048890	3050371	Are you going out to Times Square tomorrow?
3051632	3052613	Uh, probably not.
3053493	3055134	But I am getting drunk.
3055955	3056235	Tomorrow.
3056255	3057276	Legitimately.
3057616	3058437	You're not drunk now?
3058517	3059237	I'm with friends.
3059678	3059858	No.
3060078	3061139	Alright, but you'll be drunk tomorrow.
3062700	3064601	Yeah, just going over the year that was 2007 in gaming.
3064661	3064881	Uh-huh.
3071038	3073380	Are you ready to go over November with us?
3075048	3078211	I think, I don't know if my memory's still shady, but let's do it.
3078771	3079311	I'll help you.
3079712	3082674	I've got four stories here to help remind you what happened in November.
3083134	3087036	Episode 254... Whoa, we just had a crash here in the studio.
3087297	3088217	Everyone's okay.
3088237	3089298	We're dropping the alcohol.
3089338	3090819	Sorry, the alcohol got dropped.
3090899	3101086	All right, episode number 254 was the week that Manhunt 2 on the PSP was hacksawed to remove some of the... And target, basically.
3101833	3112921	and Target quickly rushed to judgment and pulled it off even though there's no way in hell you're going to get to it unless you have massive experience in PSP hacking.
3112961	3116324	But Loki, you did it the day this thing came out, didn't you?
3116344	3121388	You had your PSP stripped of the censored stuff in it.
3122048	3122609	Was it worth it?
3122889	3123169	No.
3124370	3130975	Was it worth it for fucking genitals getting like, I don't know, you know, basically hurt
3132480	3134542	His network got censored.
3134562	3138624	Weren't the generals, what do you call it, hurt?
3139505	3139965	Yes.
3140225	3141746	Electrocuted, mashed.
3142086	3143767	They were ripped off with pliers.
3144308	3144388	Ew.
3144568	3145668	Oh, wow.
3147698	3150580	Yeah, this game sounds pretty horrible.
3150920	3151821	I didn't even play it.
3151861	3152381	I don't need to.
3153302	3153662	Let's see.
3153862	3155203	Episode number 255.
3155263	3155903	That was the week.
3156183	3157084	This was a slow news week.
3157124	3158105	I didn't have a lot from this week.
3158685	3161207	NPD withholds sales numbers from the press.
3161647	3170012	And actually, it is kind of relevant because, you know, obviously it kind of leaves it in the company's hands to be kind of bragging.
3170032	3173754	And you've seen companies kind of stretch these reports out a little bit.
3174014	3174715	Of course.
3174735	3176256	They want to appease their stockholders.
3176681	3177241	Exactly.
3178903	3179443	What the hell?
3179483	3180964	Are you at a 7-Eleven or something?
3181004	3185167	I heard a little phone go off.
3185227	3186888	It sounds like the phone's at 7-Eleven.
3187008	3189189	Yeah, my phone just went off.
3189229	3190690	Just keep coming quickly.
3191171	3191631	Sorry, sir.
3193032	3195433	When we say withhold, they didn't withhold everything.
3195473	3201998	They just reduced some of the information that was going out there and caused the companies to basically be on their own.
3202038	3203759	Jesus Christ, you got a beeper, too?
3207732	3209213	Maybe we should get another caller.
3209233	3210033	He's got a pimp!
3210693	3213314	Hold on a second.
3213374	3214594	You are not putting us on hold.
3215394	3217095	We will hang up on you.
3217115	3219336	Okay, bye.
3219416	3220116	Yeah, hello.
3223137	3223477	Alright.
3224657	3227298	I can't believe we got put on hold by a caller.
3227338	3227738	No, no, no.
3227758	3228198	It was only quickly.
3228218	3228639	Strike one, Zaku.
3228659	3229379	Episode 256 was the week.
3229399	3230999	What a way to end the year.
3239689	3245651	Week number 256, episode 256, that was the week that the Xbox download service was announced.
3246311	3251253	On the Xbox 360, you would be able to download original Xbox games to the service.
3251293	3254934	And, of course, we've seen this come out now, and you can get Psychonauts and Indigo Prophecy.
3255235	3258336	Kind of a way to rediscover Xbox games you may have missed the first time around.
3258836	3261757	Or, for some people, a way overpriced way to do it.
3263137	3264658	Well, yeah, of course, the marketplace.
3265659	3276887	Who the hell would put price tags on fucking icons and themes and basically do it against the will of game developers as well when they don't want to charge for that shit, for downloadable content?
3277067	3277847	Loki, do you agree?
3279188	3280309	Like Epic, for example.
3280369	3285493	They don't want to do that shit, but they're forced to because they have no choice most of the time.
3285893	3291137	Why do you think Unreal Tournament 3 is being held up for the 360 besides the user-created stuff?
3291753	3300520	It's being held up because they can't do cross-platform play between the PC and the... Well, they were doing it... But user-created mods is the other hinging factor.
3301441	3302902	Well, they can worry about that later.
3303222	3306024	That's not really a factor to keep it from being released.
3309366	3311888	Jesus Christ, is someone at the door now?
3311908	3314490	Just go through the last song, the last one.
3314710	3315170	Yes, sir.
3315230	3319333	Guitar Hero's 80s edition sued because the song is too similar.
3319834	3322515	The romantic sued Guitar Hero 80s edition.
3323016	3324117	And as we all know, they lost.
3324157	3325297	The judge laughed that out of court.
3325318	3328660	All right, out of those stories, Manhunt 2, Guitar Hero.
3328680	3329160	The first one.
3330321	3330942	All right, got it.
3330962	3333163	What, are you going to give us your best?
3333183	3336606	That's why you don't answer the phone.
3336646	3337907	You let it go to voicemail.
3337967	3338387	All right.
3344420	3346762	Tony, you're the one that keeps answering the calls from him, man.
3348264	3349225	That's just not cool.
3349265	3350286	He's nipping in the butt.
3350847	3352148	That's just not cool.
3354751	3355371	I'm sorry.
3355551	3360917	I'm not offended because I think it's hilarious, honestly.
3360937	3362138	I'm offended.
3363119	3364180	All right, the first one, bye.
3365321	3366222	No, no, no, no, no, no.
3366443	3366863	Fuck that.
3366903	3367644	I'm doing December.
3369595	3371876	Let me open up Skype, see if anybody else wants to call.
3371896	3374417	Let's give it a couple minutes.
3374437	3379120	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3380801	3383302	Actdeft in chat says, best call ever, ever.
3385464	3392948	If somebody would like to call us and take Zaku's place, you can call us right now.
3392968	3396970	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3400407	3404592	I'm going to give it like 10 seconds, and I'm just going to say, Loki, fuck it, you can just do it.
3406674	3408316	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
3409518	3410018	This is DT.
3410278	3413362	Praise be to God, Dark Tetsuya, how are you, my friend?
3414704	3415224	Oh, good.
3415645	3417547	Think you can do a better job than the last caller?
3418628	3419029	Yeah.
3419549	3420010	Alright.
3420603	3421663	Oh, Manhunt 2, definitely.
3421683	3421983	Oh, yeah.
3422044	3422364	Absolutely.
3448598	3448698	Oh, no.
3448718	3448858	Oh, no.
3448878	3449018	Oh, no.
3470009	3471711	Yeah, because people have that much free time.
3495385	3498647	Honestly, though, if no one brought it back up, would you still remember?
3499287	3505011	I completely forgot about this, and thank God, because all you need to know is not to trust the bigger sites.
3505271	3506651	Trust us, because we're awesome.
3506892	3511374	Well, I stand by what I said before, that there's multiple sides to every story.
3511434	3520059	And actually, oddly enough, you would think me, of all people, would be the biggest critic of GameSpot in this situation, but I actually think people didn't give them enough credit.
3520667	3522669	I think we're too quick to blame the big corpse.
3522989	3523829	I just didn't care.
3523969	3525150	I was getting annoyed at that point.
3525170	3526651	I'm like, thank God they fired you.
3526691	3528012	This story's taking too long.
3529313	3531194	All right, well, there was other news in December.
3531555	3537819	Episode 259 was Nintendo pulls ads due to the high demand of the Nintendo Wii.
3537859	3542522	They basically said, okay, we can't make these Wiis fast enough.
3542941	3544123	Everybody still wants one.
3544163	3547787	You know, maybe we'll hold off on the advertising until the first quarter next year.
3547807	3548448	That makes sense.
3548689	3554216	I mean, if you're having no problem selling one item, why do you need to advertise it?
3554276	3561165	Advertise for one that may not be selling as well, and they have a little bit more of, so it makes sense to me.
3562220	3568343	Episode 260, DVR and Internet Radio launches on Sony PSPs in Japan.
3588334	3600198	and in part A we talked about Akira Yamaoka comes out and says that Japanese development's in trouble and that the American development's where it's at right now and of course Silent Hill 5 is being developed right here in America.
3600538	3605520	What do you think out of those four stories DarkSakura had the biggest impact on gaming in 2007?
3606320	3616304	Jeff Gertzman in the fallout there, Nintendo pulling ads due to the Wii demand, DVR and internet radio hits the PSP or Akira Yamaoka saying that development is...
3618231	3619391	It's in America is where it's at.
3621052	3622332	Oh, Gershman, definitely.
3622932	3624113	Yeah, I think that's kind of a no-brainer.
3624433	3625613	But why do you say that?
3625653	3627314	What do you think is the fallout that that could have in 2008?
3627354	3630494	I don't know.
3630574	3644558	It was like back in the day, I don't know if you remember, it was when EGM gave Super Street Fighter 2 poor scores, Capcom full of advertising.
3646363	3647143	Back in March.
3647163	3647363	Yeah.
3647383	3647463	Yeah.
3666251	3670534	You know, and again, as I do a lot, I compare things to the movie industry.
3670894	3691448	You know, just because Siskel and Ebert might give a movie a bad review, well, Siskel doesn't review anything anymore, but just because Ebert and Roper, Ebert gives a thumbs up, Siskel's, just because Ebert and Roper might give something a bad review doesn't mean that suddenly, you know, they're going to stop advertising in the Chicago newspapers.
3691508	3694250	Siskel, get me out of Ebert's stomach.
3699115	3699635	Oh, forget it.
3699956	3700977	It's been plenty of time.
3701037	3702318	It's not too soon anymore.
3702599	3703640	I want this show to be over.
3703740	3706162	So we need to get to the best and worst games of the year.
3706223	3709987	DarkTetsuya, in your big opinion, what was the worst freaking game of 2007?
3710087	3712710	Oh, God.
3712790	3717315	I hadn't really played all that much, so I guess I'll go with Yaris.
3719344	3720785	When in doubt, Yaris, right?
3720925	3721626	When in doubt.
3722326	3724648	You drive a car with a claw.
3725268	3726089	Enough said.
3726209	3729391	Alright, what was the best game of 2007 in your opinion?
3730672	3732153	Oh god, I just rented it.
3732233	3733534	Super Mario Galaxy.
3735535	3736396	And why this game?
3738717	3743380	Well, it's what Super Mario 64 2 should have been.
3744341	3746903	Instead of what we got on the GameCube, Super Mario Sunshine?
3746963	3747283	Yeah.
3748124	3748444	Gotcha.
3749073	3750473	Exactly.
3750933	3752474	Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?
3755094	3756074	No, that's about it.
3757015	3757395	All right.
3758415	3758735	All right.
3758795	3762656	Well, Dark Tetsuya, thanks so much for calling and helping us out with the rest of the year.
3762696	3763316	We appreciate it.
3763356	3763816	Have a good one.
3763956	3765276	Yeah, you too.
3765457	3765777	All right.
3767597	3767897	Take care.
3768457	3773078	Dark Tetsuya, of course, writes for our website once in a while when there's news to report on.
3774438	3776979	Legend of Zaku posted his pics in chat.
3777634	3803304	He would have picked God of War 2 for the best game of the year And Kane and Lynch for the worst game of the year Well, haha, you were answering the phone while you were on the phone with us So yours doesn't count, rude person But there you have it, if you were curious Alright, that took us through the whole year What a trip down memory lane, what a long trip down memory lane I don't remember A fucking lot's happened this year A lot's happened this year
3805126	3805647	ManHunt2 ManHunt2 ManHunt2
3836969	3837830	Was it Smash Bros.
3837870	3838570	getting delayed?
3838730	3841092	Was it Codemasters and the broken Bubble Bobble game?
3841432	3848377	Was it the lady dying over the Nintendo Wii that so many people wanted a Wii that she drank so much she died?
3849398	3850558	I think it was Proteus.
3851379	3851859	Proteus?
3852540	3854561	I would say probably the biggest story of the year.
3854661	3854981	I don't know.
3855001	3857583	For me, it's the Bubble Bobble thing.
3858164	3862987	It really is because seriously, seriously, how do you do that?
3864048	3864808	How does that happen?
3864828	3865288	Seriously.
3865409	3865969	Seriously.
3868663	3869283	But that's just me.
3870204	3877326	Alright, I would say... Not Bubble Bobble.
3879146	3881727	I mean, seriously, how many people bought Bubble Bobble?
3881807	3883908	I mean, that affected what, five people?
3883988	3884808	I mean, seriously.
3887469	3893091	I would say probably... I don't know.
3894754	3902521	The fact that it's a crime that Activision released three Guitar Hero games this year, huh?
3903662	3904423	Yeah, that's a crime.
3905424	3908887	I don't know, let me think.
3911987	3913408	Was that last year or this year?
3913488	3916949	I can't remember when Red Octane was purchased by Activision.
3917209	3917569	Last year.
3917789	3918350	That was last year.
3919210	3920690	Alright, well let's move on.
3920750	3925672	Let's talk about our top five games of the year and our picks for the worst game of the year.
3925712	3927233	Let's get the worst out of the way.
3927733	3928713	The worst game of the year.
3928733	3931994	We're going to tally it up with what the listeners say and figure it out here.
3932335	3934175	DarkSakura, what in your opinion was the worst game of the year?
3934655	3935276	The worst game?
3935316	3936336	I actually have a list of five.
3937077	3938298	You have a list of five.
3938338	3938778	All right.
3938858	3939779	Worst games of the year.
3940019	3945482	I'm going to say Manhunt 2 was one of them just because, you know, I got sick of hearing all the crap.
3945562	3946263	Imagine Babies.
3947984	3949465	Although that was a funny picture with you.
3949585	3950925	Anything with the Bratz franchise.
3951766	3953467	And I'll say Yaris 2 just because.
3954067	3955728	But I got warning so I didn't play it.
3956469	3960531	And then I have to put this one on here for sauce.
3960751	3961672	And this is a quote from...
3962239	3968045	Heroes of Mana is the worst game of 2007 because you need a doctorate in electrical engineering to understand how to play the fucking game.
3969606	3970767	So I'm going to pick that one.
3970887	3971388	Heroes of Mana.
3971448	3972108	On her suggestion.
3972429	3975532	God damn, the Mana games started sucking after Secret of Mana, didn't they?
3976132	3977393	It's very unfortunate.
3977534	3981637	I wish that we had gotten, um, uh, Second Sense 2.
3981778	3983439	You never know in the virtual console.
3983459	3983900	You never know.
3984901	3985301	Loki!
3985321	3985401	Loki!
3985919	3988140	Your pick for the worst fucking game of 2007.
3988280	3989340	I, too, had five.
3989440	3991900	Actually, six, if you can't... Jeez, I only had one.
3991920	3992781	This is easy.
3992801	3997662	Well, I was thinking... I am my... Okay, my number one is not yours.
3998122	3998582	But, anyways.
4000442	4006504	So, number six, Offroad Extreme Special Edition, although I did not play it, but it was horrible.
4006944	4009345	I did play this game, Counterforce, for the Wii.
4009865	4011585	Yet another game by Conspiracy Entertainment.
4011605	4015526	In fact, my number three would be anything from Conspiracy Entertainment.
4017076	4035373	or actually that'd be number four number three I actually this was the only the first and only game I will ever import for the PS3 Wangen Midnight is a fucking joke on the PlayStation 3 it is poor for a PlayStation 2 game I hated it it was a waste of $60
4036844	4052554	Yaris is number two and the reason it's number two is because it's free number one I paid fucking fifty dollars for and it was a ripoff Transformers the game the worst biggest disappointment of a game this year how do you fuck that up but you did
4054861	4056523	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4074065	4093002	and the way it was packaged it just felt so rushed it was just a steaming pile of poo I hated I mean there's not a lot of times I go I really fucking hate this game I hate Fusion Frenzy 2 so much that game was awful
4093722	4094782	Awful, awful, awful.
4094902	4096423	And it's definitely the worst game of the year.
4096603	4100484	And I can't believe that's highway robbery that they ever tried to charge full price for that game.
4100624	4101524	I forgot.
4102165	4104005	My wallet was raped by that game.
4104245	4105546	I forgot one more.
4107686	4110767	It's an honorable mention, I guess, because it is also free.
4112748	4116649	You remember the vision camera from Microsoft.
4117289	4118750	What's that?
4119030	4120170	Totem Ball.
4120430	4121531	Wasn't the vision cam last year?
4121591	4122691	No, it was this year.
4122871	4123051	Was it?
4123547	4126669	Yaris definitely runs away with the title of the worst game of 2007.
4151325	4152305	SuperMarioGalaxy RockBand
4178931	4181352	because, again, super cool, and Radiohead.
4181992	4183612	And one, Portal, duh.
4184512	4185033	So that's it.
4185913	4186693	Enough said, huh?
4186713	4188813	Portal was just super innovative.
4189174	4191094	And I love anything that messes with physics.
4192114	4197956	I would totally be a physics major if it wasn't for all the retarded math.
4199576	4199916	Alright.
4200776	4201317	There you go.
4202657	4203037	Loki!
4204131	4204632	GhostSquad
4227478	4233160	One of the most underrated games, at least for the Wii Zapper that's come out for the Wii this year.
4233340	4234120	It's cheap.
4234340	4235700	It's probably going to get cheaper.
4236320	4238341	And granted, the graphics aren't that great.
4238421	4240261	The game is incredibly short.
4240762	4244783	But I will tell you, I played that game through like six times in a row.
4245163	4249604	The fact that you can unlock like 50 different weapons in the game, that makes the games even harder.
4250484	4253765	And I don't know, it was the most fun I had for about four hours.
4254517	4283011	and that's all I've played of it so far but um Ghost Squad definitely worth picking up on the Wii if you like gun games um Rock Band fun um I have to give it props because I bought Guitar Hero 2 and I bought Guitar Hero for the Playstation I played it like once and I said fuck this and put it down and that's where it gathered dust Rock Band I actually played for a lot more than that and it's actually pretty fun um
4284372	4301140	Just wish there was an easier way to be able to play online with multiple people, like, you know, in a world mode or something like that, but definitely a fun game and I really, it's actually one of the games I actually look forward to the download content coming out for it, which, you know, I can't really say that about many other games.
4302341	4303101	Let's see here.
4303682	4304422	Bioshock.
4305402	4306823	It was a great game while it lasted.
4307243	4308884	I thought maybe a little bit short.
4310585	4312446	You know, not a whole lot of replays
4312725	4314586	Playability, but I had fun while playing it.
4315487	4316527	That takes us to number one.
4317408	4318148	No, that's... Oh, whoops.
4318668	4319028	Number three.
4319109	4319609	I can't count.
4319749	4319989	Okay.
4320769	4322550	Number two, Crackdown.
4323151	4326212	Best thing for a futuristic Grand Theft Auto.
4326893	4327613	Absolutely fun.
4327933	4331295	The most fun I've had in a demo for a game, ever.
4332296	4334197	Absolutely fun to play online.
4334217	4338779	Of course, that fizzles away pretty quick, and the game kind of repetitive.
4338819	4340500	Had some pretty good download content for it.
4340520	4341621	I actually went back to it.
4342074	4343535	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4372452	4378135	Just to try to get the five achievements that are in it, Earth Defense Force 2017.
4378515	4381137	Absolutely the best $20 you'll ever spend.
4381197	4383678	If you find it used, you can probably find it for even cheaper than that.
4385119	4392223	D3 really, really, really needs to bring over the simple series over here because it's absolutely, you know, good money.
4392303	4395164	It's the cheesiest, weirdest games you'll ever play.
4395504	4398506	And unfortunately, because they're so weird, they don't end up coming over here.
4399006	4400047	But I hope that changes.
4402406	4403046	My turn.
4403867	4404867	Top five games of the year.
4405667	4411149	I'm not surprised, Earth Defense Force 2017, for you, because you are a guy that's all about fun, and, you know, blowing shit up is fun.
4411990	4417412	You can blow up, you can level entire cities, and then they come back to the next level, and you can level them all over again.
4417632	4422754	It's, seriously, we've played it for, I don't know how many hours.
4422994	4424294	I have it logged in the game.
4424354	4426295	It's over 70 hours, I know that.
4426435	4426615	Wow.
4427642	4428283	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4441195	4450299	Puzzle Quest was an amazing game that took Bejeweled and just put little twists on it that made a whole role-playing game out of it and a more competitive type of game out of it.
4462825	4463686	Puzzle Quest was an amazing game.
4463706	4465087	It was my number five game of the year.
4465107	4465147	Um...
4486727	4491691	My number four game of the year is one of those games that probably most critics aren't even going to put on their top ten.
4492071	4502039	But for me, it was so great to finally see a true Japanese role-playing style game on a next-gen console and to see what it could do.
4502139	4506803	And I thought the story in this game was so amazing, yet kind of depressing.
4506943	4508805	And the way that it wove...
4509662	4525206	Real life in with this fictional scenario was just something really innovative and new and that's why Eternal Sonata for me was just a different type of gaming experience that I really enjoyed and had to be in my top five for the year, absolutely.
4526486	4530947	Say what you want about it getting stale towards the end or what have you or
4531465	4532525	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4558809	4559690	Thank you for watching!
4577341	4593893	My number two game of the year is all about fun and I did not think that this game was going to be so great because my expectations I guess were actually a little bit low because like I said earlier in the show I was not a big fan of Mario 64 as much as the next guy but Super Mario Galaxy just blew me away.
4593973	4598397	It is so much fun and is really the type of game that I think the Wii was built for.
4599237	4601879	So Super Mario Galaxy is absolutely my number two game of the year.
4602460	4603981	And that takes me to the number one game of the year
4606184	4610866	I admit it, I do not like to spend as much money as I do on gaming.
4610906	4615768	I spend a lot of money on games, and that is why value is so important to me.
4616669	4624092	And in my opinion, there is no better value out there in gaming right now, period, than the Orange Box.
4624772	4632716	And that is one of the sole reasons why the Orange Box is my game of the year, because you get these great, you know, obviously Half-Life is an incredible series of games, Team Fortress 2...
4634268	4635909	A lot of fun.
4635929	4640491	And the unique art style of Team Fortress 2 really kind of sets it apart from the other games.
4642451	4643612	And, of course, Portal.
4644132	4653356	I mean, Portal is kind of like... When you play Portal, you feel like you're starting to play the next great series of games.
4653776	4658878	Like, something truly original has kind of started with Portal that I think is going to kind of continue.
4658898	4662239	And you have all these kind of in-jokes and the whole, like, the cake is a lie.
4662640	4663640	And, like, you know, not...
4664142	4669464	Every game, especially its first time out the gate, can kind of create that kind of buzz.
4669965	4674107	So the Orange Box absolutely is the best game that came out in 2007.
4674147	4678128	It's not only the best deal in gaming, but just some of the most solid games you're going to get.
4678669	4680510	And the best 60 bucks you can spend on games.
4681710	4682190	So there it is.
4683271	4684431	My top five games of the year.
4684792	4685732	So let's tally it up.
4687113	4691855	We have, let's see, one vote for Call of Duty 4, one vote for Maximum Toon 3.
4693732	4696413	One vote for Earth Defense Force 2017.
4697194	4699194	Two votes for Super Mario Galaxy.
4699854	4704736	But if you combine Portal with Orange Box, you get four votes for Portal and Orange Box this year.
4704796	4709278	So I'm going to have to say that Orange Box is collectively Orange Lounge Radio's Game of the Year.
4709298	4713559	I did say Half-Life 2 earlier for one of my ones that didn't make the list.
4713679	4714600	Yeah, so, you know.
4715200	4715760	It's part of it.
4715780	4716901	It kind of just applied again.
4716921	4717661	It came out this year.
4718301	4720362	And, you know, it's ironic.
4721149	4724571	because I remember when I first heard about this game, The Orange Box, I was like, oh, isn't that funny?
4724611	4727033	We're Orange Launch Radio and here's this game, The Orange Box.
4727233	4728874	I built a computer called The Orange Box.
4729054	4734738	And what's also funny about it is that I remember saying, I was kind of like, oh, these are the, oh, we're not, I'm not really into these kind of games.
4734878	4736299	I don't really like the first person shooters.
4736799	4738200	Portal, it's a shooter.
4738560	4739281	I'm not going to like that.
4740361	4747866	Portal makes me enjoy first person shooters because it's, it's a different, I mean, I think even people that don't enjoy first person shooters can enjoy Portal.
4748186	4749487	And that's what makes the game so great.
4750468	4750668	Well,
4751220	4751760	There you have it.
4752960	4753560	The Orange Box.
4753580	4756541	And no, we are not changing our name to Orange Box Lounge Radio.
4756601	4757981	That would be no fun at all.
4758001	4760462	But the Orange Box is collectively our game of the year.
4763082	4764222	Which takes us to 2008.
4764262	4766363	What do you guys think?
4766483	4768243	What do you think is going to happen in 2008?
4768723	4769904	Any predictions you want to make for 2008?
4769944	4770044	Loki?
4770064	4770324	I don't know.
4770344	4770424	Gosh.
4780043	4781183	DS Redesigned Halo Wars Fable 2 Spore
4809790	4811491	Blue and Black DS in February.
4811551	4812611	I don't know.
4812891	4815552	All right.
4839537	4841819	DarkSakura, any predictions you want to make for the year 2008?
4843560	4845422	Duke Nukem, no.
4846082	4850826	Duke Nukem Forever will fucking come out at some point, and it'll be disappointing.
4852287	4856010	I think that Super Smash Bros.
4856050	4857151	Brawl will get pushed again.
4859092	4860153	I keep expecting it.
4860593	4861114	You know what?
4861614	4864857	Here's something that's kind of interesting, and I've actually looked at it.
4865477	4866638	I've been kind of following it a little bit.
4867869	4870931	I loved Saints Row, and we still play it every day.
4871432	4875135	It kind of is holding us over until Grand Theft Auto 4.
4875435	4880020	But at the same time, Saints Row 2 is supposed to be coming out, I think, this year, or 2008.
4880760	4881901	Tomorrow!
4882642	4883102	Yeah, I wish.
4884343	4885925	2008, and it actually looks pretty good.
4886225	4890389	And I'm kind of wondering, you know, I know Grand Theft Auto 4 is going to be amazing, but
4891639	4893440	Predictions I'm going to make...
4922702	4932745	In the third or fourth quarter of 2008, Sony will redesign the PlayStation 3 and do an effective relaunch, a reboot of the system the way maybe they should have done it the first time.
4932985	4937686	And the reboot will include a playable demo of Final Fantasy XIII that's going to blow everybody away.
4938886	4950370	But Metal Gear Solid 4 will not single-handedly save the PlayStation 3 and that's what's going to want to cause them to really cut corners in the cost and they're going to release this system just as dirt cheap as possible to try and get people to buy it.
4951810	4951890	Um...
4953460	4978901	somebody will challenge Nintendo to the throne of handheld gaming and it won't be Sony I think in 2008 I think this year this is a very just out there prediction I don't know I get the feeling Nintendo has such a large share of the marketplace in handheld I think someone else wants a piece of that besides Sony but I don't think it's Microsoft I think someone else I think someone we don't know about yet is going to come in and challenge Nintendo for the throne in 2008 um
4984396	4987839	And a lot of folks in the chat room are insinuating it might be Sega.
4989881	4990221	Maybe.
4990962	4991842	I don't know.
4992163	4993704	Their games have not been... I don't know.
4994465	4996386	Because Sega and Nintendo have been kind of working together.
4997287	4999349	And Sega also have tried handheld and they failed.
4999689	5000209	So I don't know.
5000950	5003072	I don't say no, but I don't think it would be Sega.
5003392	5006995	I don't think it's going to be somebody that's known for gaming.
5007055	5009197	I think it's going to be somebody that's known for electronics.
5009898	5011439	is going to try and get in here.
5011499	5013780	Kind of like what Sony did when they got into the gaming market.
5014080	5018463	I think somebody who's known for electronics now is going to try to challenge Nintendo for the gaming throne.
5019043	5019463	But we'll see.
5019783	5020484	For handheld gaming.
5021484	5027207	I think the Wii colors will come out finally this year, and I think they'll come out just in time for the holiday season.
5027508	5029369	They're going to get the Wiis in the different colors finally.
5030389	5034151	And I think something will happen to address the storage issues on the Wii.
5034692	5035092	I think...
5036081	5039923	I don't know if the color systems are going to necessarily come with more onboard memory.
5040003	5043685	I have a feeling they will, but it's not going to be a major increase, just a slight one.
5043705	5044725	Like, what do they have now, 512 megs?
5044746	5046066	Yeah, 512.
5046146	5048167	I say they up the internal memory to 2 gigs.
5049908	5053290	But there'll be a firmware that will improve the SD card support.
5053310	5061094	I can see that, because with the price of, you know, flash RAM, I mean, it's going to... This shit gets cheaper every day, so...
5061900	5063301	I wouldn't see why they wouldn't do that.
5063662	5070968	I could also see the DS with the onboard storage for downloadable games, virtual console for the DS, so to speak, I guess.
5072450	5074151	I could see something definitely like that.
5074832	5077394	I'm trying to think what else would be.
5077755	5079897	PlayStation redesign, I could see that.
5080317	5085822	Might even see a 360 redesign, especially if they get it cooler and stuff.
5088297	5096164	and let's see, I don't want to take this on too much longer with just predictions I'm pulling out of my ass, but just, you know, I think there's a possibility some of these things will happen.
5096744	5109195	I think Nintendo, I think the big Christmas game they're going to reveal, I think Animal Crossing is going to be their big winner game, and I think it is going to be an MMO, and it is going to be a bit MySpace-y.
5109596	5113559	I think there is going to be a social element to it that no other game has really done yet.
5113979	5115721	I think that's going to be their big winner game.
5116448	5120609	But I also think this will be the year that Kid Icarus is finally revived.
5121470	5122570	I don't know, call it my gut.
5123330	5126231	And Guardian Legend finally comes to Virtual Console and we all collectively orgasm.
5126271	5128872	I can see them coming out with some more peripherals for the system.
5129112	5129673	They've got to.
5130013	5132814	I mean, what, the nunchuck and, you know, classic controller?
5132834	5134094	I mean, come on, you guys.
5134794	5135355	Seriously.
5136015	5140056	I want to fucking redesign the damn remote to, uh, or make a gun thing.
5140456	5144618	I'm surprised someone hasn't hacked the remote yet to figure out how to get, you know, key presses from there, because...
5145131	5146253	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5156002	5159484	And not to leave Microsoft out, I'm going to make a bold prediction for them.
5160585	5168830	I say because this latest update has shown that they can do buffering video and they can do it very well, like if you watch the Inside Xbox stuff, that all works out very well.
5169471	5176135	I think Microsoft is going to make a Web 2.0 move this year, and I think you're going to see something YouTube-y come to the Xbox 360.
5178056	5180378	And it's going to be the reason to get a camera if you don't already have one.
5181511	5182171	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5201903	5206504	But this week it's very special because these are the FUs of the year.
5206924	5210265	So these are the things that have pissed us off the most above anything else the entire year.
5210325	5212766	DarkSakura, why don't you start us off tonight with the FUs of the year.
5212786	5223108	I guess my FU of the year is going to go towards...
5232549	5238351	The City of Citrus Heights for the crap they're doing regarding massage therapist business licenses.
5239711	5245473	Just because that completely interferes with a year's worth of hard work I've put into making my business happen.
5246213	5247434	So, fuck you.
5249254	5249635	Alright.
5250255	5251575	Loki, your FU of the year.
5252396	5256857	I don't have anything that's really all-consuming for the entire year, but for this week at least,
5257421	5285136	F you at Nvidia and your crappy graphics drivers because for whatever reason whenever I reboot my computer not only does it not save my settings to what screen resolution I have if it did for whatever reason actually boot up in my desired resolution it flashes black and then back to the picture and blacks out again and constantly does that until I change the graphics to a different aspect ratio and then change it back it's fucking annoying
5287352	5290495	and my FU of the year goes to bugs.
5291676	5293157	Because bugs suck.
5293818	5296520	Especially flies that fly around in the room when you're trying to do a show.
5298161	5298542	Alright.
5299542	5300283	That's going to do it.
5301544	5304567	Unless there's any last minute things anybody wants to say?
5304667	5304747	Sure.
5305387	5306068	Who knew?
5306108	5306749	Alright, Loki.
5307950	5315216	In case you didn't catch that earlier when I was talking about it, No More Heroes has moved up to January, or at least the end of January, so it's moved up a week.
5315822	5316782	So, hooray!
5316802	5319443	You get to play the game even sooner in the United States.
5320023	5330645	Apparently, there's a thing going around right now where some of the nunchucks that Nintendo has put out recently, I don't know if it's the coloring or something, but they're becoming discolored, like pink.
5331665	5332325	That's kind of funny.
5333286	5334306	So they're less manly.
5335446	5338227	And then I don't know if anyone saw this.
5338727	5344208	Apparently, there's a company called Pega, and they're releasing yet another gun peripheral for the Wii.
5344981	5347962	This one, though, is shaped like a shark.
5348862	5350343	It's called the Shark Gun.
5351163	5356685	In fact, they were actually... They had a whole press release for this thing.
5356765	5357545	It was hilarious.
5358185	5371249	They had something... During the gunfighting game, use the Wii Remote, Nunchuck, and Shark Gun together, holding the handle of the Shark Gun and poking the trigger with your forefinger to shoot.
5372010	5372650	We'll bring you...
5374627	5377412	We'll bring you a You Are There feeling.
5378774	5383441	But it's funny, though, because they have military guys on the cover shooting guns and stuff.
5384042	5385184	Although they're not the shark gun.
5385705	5387428	So it'd be funny if the military had shark guns.
5390225	5391185	Alright, that's enough news.
5391245	5392106	It can wait until next week.
5392166	5396588	Next week on Orange Lounge Radio, we're back to our classic format.
5396608	5399209	All three of us will be discussing the latest and greatest in gaming news.
5399269	5401029	Of course, your calls on Skype, as always.
5401950	5403791	And who knows who might put us on hold next week.
5403831	5404451	We'll see.
5404611	5405011	Oh, wait.
5405091	5406031	I got one more thing on the shark gun.
5406051	5406472	God damn it.
5406492	5407272	Sorry, this is funny.
5407712	5408713	It's one of the features on there.
5408993	5416916	With lively appearance and smooth lines, Shark Gun makes you feel comfortable and gives you a strong sense of shark-like invincible force.
5418769	5419029	Dustcap4
5448554	5449355	I have one more, actually.
5449415	5449715	Oh, yes.
5450156	5451137	Reject false icons.
5451817	5454760	It's been a while since we've had a good hearty reject false icons.
5454840	5455160	It's good.
5455941	5464309	Alright, for myself, DarkSakura, and Loki, everybody please have a happy and very safe New Year's Eve and New Year's Day.
5464409	5466791	Please don't drink and drive, because if you do, you're retarded.
5467812	5469413	And that's really it.
5470134	5471115	We'll see you guys in 2008 for our
5472791	5475032	Sixth year of broadcasting, if you can believe it.
5475132	5477893	We'll be back next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
