0	6000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
6000	15000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	19000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19000	22000	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
22000	26000	Here on this New Year's Eve Eve, we are taping December 30, 2007.
26000	32000	We're doing our year-end special, and in the first half of tonight's program, part A, we recapped with some of our listeners.
32000	35000	We had Raven's Dolphin, we had Dark Knight, we had Xenocore.
35000	39000	They all called in to talk about January, February, March, April, May, and June.
39000	40000	We recapped those months.
40000	43000	We're going to be getting into the rest of the year very soon.
43000	46000	But first, let's open up the old mailbag.
46000	50000	Dark Soccer is going to be opening up the old mailbag and pulling out some of her favorite emails.
50000	52000	Do I gotta?
52000	53000	Yeah, you gotta.
53000	57000	Because even though usually during a special show we wouldn't do it since we weren't here last week,
57000	60000	the email's building up and we gotta clean some of them out.
60000	61000	I had to pick up a few.
61000	67000	Yeah, and unfortunately, I mean, I think there was just so many emails these past two weeks that you're just not going to be able to read them all.
67000	69000	So, Jamie's having to be choosy this week.
69000	71000	Sorry, folks.
71000	73000	So, let's open up the old mailbag.
73000	75000	Mailbag at www.orangeloungeradio.com, though, if you want to send it.
75000	78000	Even if we don't always respond to them on air, we read them all.
78000	80000	I go in there and I read them all every day.
80000	84000	There was one that had a lot of gratuitous uses of the word fuck, so I'm not reading it.
84000	85000	I see.
85000	88000	So, I'm only reading a few of these, okay?
88000	93000	First one is, hey guys, greetings and salutations from Dr. Noir from Mexico City.
93000	98000	I'll skip the praise because I obviously like your show a lot else I wouldn't be writing this.
98000	101000	I want to share with you an image that I'm sure will bring tears to many.
101000	107000	Some in anger, some in grief at seeing this many Wii units waiting for a lonely four home for this Christmas.
107000	111000	It's like watching a buffet and knowing people are famished elsewhere.
111000	116000	Anyway, keep it up and please reply with a postal address to send you your holiday gifts.
116000	118000	That'd be Rob.
118000	124000	Don't move that email out. Save it in there and I'll reply with the address.
124000	127000	Also, there's a PS.
127000	128000	Oh, okay.
128000	131000	The plural form of luchador is not luchadores, but luchadores.
131000	135000	With the last syllable pronounced S as in fez, the hat.
135000	137000	All right.
137000	141000	I did want to say speaking of gifts sent to us, one of our listeners, you'll love her,
141000	144000	Misty sent a little care package.
144000	147000	You can see up on the wall there's a Hello Kitty popsicle there.
147000	153000	This little penguin eye dog thing, which I thought was too cute, and lots of rice candy, which is my favorite.
153000	156000	I ate it.
156000	158000	She sent us some candy, but you eat it.
158000	160000	But I eat it.
160000	167000	Well, speaking of Misty, I'll go ahead and read her. She actually did ask about me talking about the Happy Suicide song.
167000	173000	And it's Thanatos from End of Evangelion is the one I was referring to.
173000	176000	The song that's just so freaking depressing.
176000	182000	Oh, I thought it was the whole end scene where they're dying. It was hilarious.
182000	185000	Oh, yeah.
185000	188000	But to read Misty's big email.
188000	193000	So I was listening to my old OLR episodes and got stuck for some reason on episode 242.
193000	198000	And that umbrella song that I ended up ripping from 249, but let's not go there right now, LOL.
198000	200000	Excuse me.
200000	206000	I guess what inspired me to write in again, well, this time anyway, was the short text message email that you read in this episode.
206000	208000	Plus, I do have a question.
208000	213000	I know I shouldn't necessarily be thinking this far ahead, but they said ASIN is my other addiction, aside from the station.
213000	217000	I know enough not to ask if there will be a panel, though that would be fucking rad.
217000	221000	So instead, I'll ask this. Currently, does anyone's schedule work out for ASIN?
221000	229000	It's May 16th through 18th this year, but I am to head up to Rosemont on the 15th.
229000	232000	Also, should I expect to see Chris there?
232000	236000	I didn't catch her last year. Feel free to insert lame Pokeman's jokes here.
236000	238000	But I really want to see her in Megsy.
238000	248000	Okay, I'll leave you alone for now. Sorry if there's a typo I missed, but my typing on the LG Envy still sucks a bit anyway. Heart misty.
248000	258000	I would think very much that Chris is going to be there, seeing as how she's relocating, because I get to go with her on the trip.
258000	267000	ASIN probably is not in my future, although a little bit more of my time in that year has been freed up.
267000	271000	So, I don't know. I would love to go, but...
271000	281000	I'm not saying no yet. Not likely right now, just due to the fact that I'm not going to have a lot of free time off work available, because I'm going to Mendocino in April.
281000	290000	But never say never, because I have found that flights from here to Chicago, there's actually a lot of direct flights from SAC to Chicago, so you never know.
290000	292000	And that's where ASIN's at, Chicago, right?
292000	293000	I do believe so.
293000	302000	So, maybe. And that's more favorable maybe than you might think, because, you know, why not? It might be fun.
302000	309000	Especially, I'll tell you what, that maybe is a hell of a lot more likely to become a yes, if we can somehow get in on getting a panel there or something.
309000	313000	Well, I've got other stuff planned in May, and I have to double check my schedule.
313000	319000	But I've wanted to go to ASIN now for a couple years, and I want to cosplay.
319000	322000	I need a new costume.
322000	329000	Probably all three of us won't make it, but at least maybe if one of the three of us can get out there. I don't know, Loki, trip to Chicago in your future?
329000	330000	Nope.
330000	332000	The wife won't let you go, will she?
332000	335000	Yep, I'm chained to the house, I'm like on house arrest.
335000	341000	Well, while I'm still single, I should probably travel, because the same thing is probably going to happen to me.
341000	346000	You should have read the fine print about her being afraid of the dark end of being alone.
346000	348000	But you love her, right?
348000	349000	Sure.
349000	350000	Alright.
350000	353000	She's been giving me crap today about my new computer.
353000	357000	Aw, sorry to hear it. You should never come between a man and his computer.
357000	363000	Well, see, now at my house it's the other way around, because I'm on my computer all the time, and Dan's playing video games.
363000	371000	See, that'd be awesome though, but you know, my wife doesn't play video games, and when she does, I can't leave the room, because I don't know why.
371000	375000	You need to petition PopCap to make a Bejeweled 3 fast to keep her busy.
375000	381000	That's only for a matter of minutes, and then she'll get bored with it.
381000	385000	We never did realize just how prophetic that t-shirt would be.
385000	389000	It's true, huh? Game over.
389000	391000	Alright, let's get to some more emails.
391000	392000	Okay.
392000	397000	Hey, O.L.R., I just wanted to get in my crappy story about the lack of Wii's in the world.
397000	410000	I live in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, and at a specific department store whose name I will not mention, there is what you call a midnight madness sale where people will stay up to midnight trying to get the 15 minute only sales.
410000	415000	Well, in this particular store, the big grand prize draw was a chance to buy a Wii.
415000	420000	Not that one gets free or 50% off, but just to have a chance to purchase one.
420000	423000	I also heard about a guy in Australia purchasing one for $590.
423000	425000	Nintendo make more Wii's.
425000	430000	Keep the good work, O.L.R. PKJR 92.
430000	434000	The only way to make your PC go faster is to throw it out a window.
434000	444000	And I think what also probably unfortunately sucks for this person who is emailing us, thank you for the email by the way, is the fact that they do live in a pretty remote area of Canada.
444000	462000	And A, you're in Canada, which is kind of, even though a very important, very large country, is still outside of that trinity of Japan, United States, and the big Europe regions like Germany, France, and Britain basically.
462000	465000	Basically the big ones in Spain.
465000	469000	I'm not trying to leave anybody out, but I'm saying the ones where gaming is more prevalent there in Europe.
469000	475000	Canada kind of comes after that sometimes with some things like Rock Band we've seen.
475000	479000	So unfortunately sometimes they get the short end of the stick with the Wii shipments as well.
479000	482000	And Nintendo can only make so many of those.
482000	492000	My advice would be though, I don't remember if he said he was trying to get one or whatever, but online, because you know, you go to a place like Amazon, they're not going to care if you're in Canada or what have you.
492000	494000	A lot of that's the same for U.S. and Canada.
494000	497000	Unless you're buying toys from Amazon U.K.
497000	502000	But that is weird though about the whole raffle to get the opportunity to buy a Wii.
502000	503000	That is weird.
503000	508000	You know I have to order my U.K. toys from Amazon Canada.
508000	509000	Interesting.
509000	510000	Yes.
510000	512000	Just thought I'd share that with you.
512000	523000	ActDeft wanted to respond to something he heard in Dr. Noir's email, and that is that there are a lot of Wiis unsold in Mexico, but that's because it costs almost double than it costs in the U.S. because of import fees.
523000	525000	Everyone import them from Mexico.
525000	528000	There you go. If you want to pay more for it, you can get a Wii from Mexico.
528000	530000	That's how you could get it in remote Canada.
530000	532000	Ah, the bliss of disposable income, huh?
532000	533000	I guess.
533000	535000	So, moving on with email.
535000	542000	You guys talked about giving Zelda a hand job, but since she's the princess, call it what it is and Zelda gets fingered.
542000	545000	This is from Mark F.
545000	547000	I stand corrected. Thank you.
547000	550000	Sky talked about simple baseball games just to chime in.
550000	552000	Bases Loaded was way better than Baseball Stars.
552000	553000	Lies.
553000	557000	And the best slash easiest baseball game was simply Baseball for the NES.
557000	561000	Fun times.
561000	563000	Moving forward for Robert M.
563000	566000	People with your initial names.
566000	568000	Hello and hope you had a nice break.
568000	571000	Hopefully you've ironed out most of the bugs in your new studio.
571000	575000	I keep getting the podcast feed about a day late.
575000	578000	Really like the weird Al for the stupid awards.
578000	585000	And just a quick thought on the last show, you mentioned Facebook as a verb instead of using it in the sense of friending.
585000	590000	My friend went into, went more the head desk direction.
590000	591000	That is face booking.
591000	595000	Someone would literally entail hitting them in the face with a book.
595000	601000	Refreshing a witty comment relating online community sites and physical pain goes here.
601000	605000	You mean like every time I go to MySpace, I feel like I'm going to have an aneurysm.
605000	608000	Yep.
608000	611000	Actually your face meets a book.
611000	612000	That's face booking.
612000	613000	I like that.
613000	623000	I was wondering what your opinion would be on the massively multiplayer online sports game such as an NFL game where all 22 players could be controlled by online gamers.
623000	624000	Hard to coordinate?
624000	625000	Probably.
625000	626000	I'd like to see something like that.
626000	630000	I'd like to see how something like that would work.
630000	632000	Brilliant idea honestly.
632000	634000	I don't know why it's not out there.
634000	635000	People don't know how to work together.
635000	636000	Maybe, yeah.
636000	645000	It's partially that and partially probably that, you know, some people, you know, in a football team, you have your standout stars and then you have the other guys.
645000	648000	And who wants to be the other guys?
648000	650000	When you play a video game, you're trying to be something you're not.
650000	652000	I've been on the bench.
652000	662000	Well, that's why it would be like what was that game that my husband was playing, NFL Pro or something, where your team is all fantasy, you know.
662000	667000	It's some of the greatest players that you've had in sports history.
667000	673000	Or maybe just that, you know, maybe you pick from a pool of players.
673000	678000	Like your team is actually a really big team that you form with friends and then like so many of you play in matches.
678000	679000	I don't know.
679000	680000	That would be really hard to coordinate though.
680000	681000	People don't know how to work together.
681000	682000	I like the idea.
682000	683000	I like the concept.
683000	686000	The execution would be a little tricky of that, but I like your concept.
686000	689000	I don't think it can work with like a party of more than seven.
689000	693000	That's why, you know, it works in RPGs but not in sports.
693000	699000	I think they should do it in hockey so that like even if you aren't really controlling the puck, at least you can go beat somebody up.
699000	701000	You know a game I would like to see.
701000	702000	What?
702000	703000	Cube.
703000	709000	How about Blades of Steel 2, which by the way, original Blades of Steel came out on Virtual Console in the US last week.
709000	711000	Bless you.
711000	719000	Our Sakura's having a sneeze fit, so I will praise Blades of Steel a little more on the great, great hockey game it was on the NES.
719000	720000	Good times.
720000	721000	By the way, I used the Wii gifting feature this week.
721000	722000	Oh, you did?
722000	726000	Yes, I used the Wii gifting feature to send my friend in New York a copy of Kid Icarus.
726000	729000	And I tried to send her Mario 3, but the Wii rejected it.
729000	733000	So the Wii is smart enough to not let you send games your friends already have.
733000	741000	Did you see, and I forgot to mention this on our show roll, that Microsoft did the gifting feature now in the US with points.
741000	744000	You can give other accounts points now.
744000	745000	Where did they do that?
745000	747000	I don't know, but I read it somewhere.
747000	751000	I read it on one of the, like, JoySick or Kotaku.
751000	754000	Is that why Xbox has been broken the past few days?
754000	755000	I don't know.
755000	767000	But that's great for me because, you know, having multiple consoles and say if I want to, you know, install, like, a map or something and buy it for each one, I don't have to buy points cards for every single console.
767000	769000	Interesting.
769000	774000	By the way, our entire chat room could hear your power sneezes and say, bless you.
774000	778000	Well, you know what, my nose feels like a nightmare of pain and suffering.
778000	779000	Sorry to hear it.
779000	780000	So thank you, chat room.
780000	782000	I'm glad you heard me blow my nose, too.
782000	783000	All right.
783000	784000	Well, any more emails?
784000	786000	I sound like a foghorn.
786000	791000	So there are emails.
791000	797000	Hey, OLR crew, I found myself unable to sleep one night at 3 in the morning and popped on your radio feed on iTunes.
797000	800000	And I was able to fall asleep.
800000	803000	And I noticed it was playing much more melon music than normal.
803000	806000	Is the rotation geared more towards slow calming songs at night?
806000	809000	Or did I just happen upon a random anomaly?
809000	811000	Either way, it helps me get to sleep, so thank you, guys.
811000	813000	Keep up the awesome show, AZHP.
813000	818000	Welcome, and you can thank the total randomness, because our playlist is the same all day long.
818000	821000	We don't do anything special at night, although maybe we should.
821000	827000	I am going to be changing the playlist up because I have a break from work here for another week.
827000	829000	So I'm going to be working on a lot of OLR stuff.
829000	838000	And one thing I'm going to be doing is cleaning out the 24-7 show and putting in some more classic game tunes and, yeah, just cycling some stuff in and out.
838000	840000	So check it out.
840000	841000	All right.
841000	842000	Two emails left.
842000	843000	Thank God.
843000	844000	All right.
844000	845000	We got a bunch.
845000	846000	This is a sample.
846000	851000	So I updated my PSP the other day and was very pleased with the internet radio edition.
851000	857000	Given the fact that I listened to your show on my PSP, it would be even better if I could listen to it live on there as well.
857000	861000	It would be a nice Christmas present, please?
861000	864000	We don't know how to make that happen just yet, but we have to get on that.
864000	865000	Loki, you got to figure that out.
865000	866000	Don't look at me.
866000	868000	I don't know how to do it.
868000	872000	You have to basically run a relay through Shoutcast.
872000	874000	Oh, it has to be Shoutcast, huh?
874000	875000	Yeah.
875000	876000	We'll see.
876000	883000	I want to say somebody sent me an email about some Shoutcast stuff, so I will look into that as the week goes on.
883000	891000	I would assume, well, maybe you could probably broadcast on Shoutcast and Live 365 at the same time.
891000	896000	Or we could just leave Live 365 and do Shoutcast with as many people as we want on the feed, but we'll see.
896000	897000	We'll see.
897000	903000	Anything is a possibility, but I can say I do know you can listen to all games on your PSP.
903000	910000	They did figure out how to set it up, so if nothing else, you can always listen to our syndicated runs that air on allgames.com on Monday nights and Tuesday mornings.
910000	912000	Well, there's more to that email.
912000	913000	Okay.
913000	918000	Also, I'd like to note that when I listen to you guys, you always find a way to make me laugh no matter what kind of mood I'm in.
918000	922000	So thank you, and I wish you all a very Merry Christmas and many more Happy New Years to come.
922000	923000	Happy Holidays.
923000	925000	Smile face, Oscar.
925000	926000	Thank you.
926000	930000	I want to say Tiger Claw says, I can listen to OLR on my PSP using PSP radio.
930000	932000	So I guess it is possible.
932000	933000	Last email.
933000	934000	Ow.
934000	936000	Maybe share that with everybody.
936000	937000	Tiger Claw, send Loki an email.
937000	939000	Would you like to share with the rest of the class?
939000	940000	Send Loki an email.
940000	941000	Don't send me an email.
941000	942000	Just post it in the chat.
942000	943000	I don't want to get into it right now.
943000	944000	Fine.
944000	945000	Then post it in the chat.
945000	946000	Email.
946000	947000	All right.
947000	948000	Email.
948000	949000	Hey Sky, Loki, and Dark Sakura.
949000	951000	Hi.
951000	953000	I'm going to start this out with a true fact.
953000	958000	OLR is the best, funniest, and most informative, engaging show in the world.
958000	962000	You guys and girl have done a great job, and for that you should be commended.
962000	963000	Good.
963000	965000	Somebody commend us, please.
965000	967000	One question, though.
967000	972000	I just got a PlayStation 3 for Christmas, and the only game I have for it right now is Motorstorm.
972000	975000	What would be the top three games you would recommend for me to get?
975000	978000	Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
978000	980000	Sell your PS3.
980000	981000	No.
981000	982000	It was a gift.
982000	983000	All right.
983000	986000	Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
986000	988000	Resistance, Fall of Man.
988000	989000	Oblivion.
989000	990000	Oblivion.
990000	991000	Absolutely Oblivion.
991000	994000	Those are actually the three I'd name right there.
994000	996000	Oblivion.
996000	998000	Resistance.
998000	1003000	Marvel, if you're into that.
1003000	1004000	I mean, obviously Jamie's into that.
1004000	1005000	It's a fun game.
1005000	1008000	I'm trying to think if there's something else that maybe was something.
1008000	1009000	It has a lot of options.
1009000	1010000	Heavenly Sword.
1010000	1011000	Yeah.
1011000	1012000	It's probably fun.
1012000	1013000	If you have two hours.
1013000	1016000	It's just J100 Matt's recommending Warhawk.
1016000	1019000	There you go.
1019000	1026000	Resistance, I would say probably Uncharted, Drake's Fortune, and depending on how you
1026000	1030000	feel about Ratchet and Clank, Ratchet and Clank.
1030000	1033000	Otherwise, I don't know.
1033000	1035000	Motorstorm's pretty good.
1035000	1038000	But if you bought your PS3, you probably already have Motorstorm.
1038000	1039000	That's what he said.
1039000	1040000	All he has now is Motorstorm.
1040000	1041000	Well, then.
1041000	1042000	Oblivion.
1042000	1043000	Nah.
1043000	1045000	I wouldn't do Oblivion.
1045000	1046000	Fine.
1046000	1047000	It's old.
1047000	1050000	I mean, they're going to come out with something new here and buy it, and then all of a sudden,
1050000	1051000	oh crap.
1051000	1052000	Well, actually, I guess it is cheap.
1052000	1054000	If you don't buy the expansion, it's like a $30 game.
1054000	1055000	So, sure.
1055000	1056000	Oblivion.
1056000	1058000	And buy a bunch of Blu-Ray movies.
1058000	1062000	A lot of the PS3 games are really cheap now, and you'll find a lot of them used.
1062000	1064000	Seth is saying Unreal Tournament in our chat room.
1064000	1065000	That's probably not a bad pick.
1065000	1069500	Now, see, Unreal Tournament and Warhawk, depending on how you feel about online-only multiplayer
1069500	1070500	games.
1070500	1074880	That's, you know, in Unreal Tournament 3, if you don't like Unreal, you know, really,
1074880	1080000	really fast, you know, kind of trigger-happy games, then you might not like that.
1080000	1082120	All right.
1082120	1083120	Is that it for emails?
1083120	1084120	No?
1084120	1085120	Oh, my God.
1085120	1086120	No, there was more to that one.
1086120	1087120	All right.
1087120	1088120	Because people keep interrupting me.
1088120	1089120	Oh, sorry.
1089120	1090120	Sir.
1090120	1095160	Also, I think Loki shouldn't get the bad rap he does from blasting Sony, because Sony really
1095160	1100000	does leave us gamers out to dry in terms of innovation, besides the PS3, and new hardware
1100000	1102320	such as new peripherals for the PSP.
1102320	1104440	So until they get wise, keep going strong.
1104440	1105880	Canada salutes you.
1105880	1107400	Sincerely, Josh G.
1107400	1110440	Well, thank you, Canada.
1110440	1111440	I salute Canada.
1111440	1112760	I love Canada.
1112760	1113760	And I like this.
1113760	1116000	What's the difference between Windows 95 and Windows 98?
1116000	1118100	Answer, three years.
1118100	1119240	That joke is like 10 years old.
1119240	1123640	I know, but I think it's great that somebody put that in their email.
1123640	1124640	All right.
1124640	1126640	So now we're done with emails, yes?
1126640	1127640	We are done.
1127640	1129600	And I'm saving and leaving out that one for you.
1129600	1130600	All right.
1130600	1131600	Thank you very much.
1131600	1132600	All right.
1132600	1135360	Let's get back into some news, and then we're going to get back into the Skype line and
1135360	1138520	go over July and the rest of the year.
1138520	1140640	Release dates, or lack thereof.
1140640	1143200	I thought I would at least open it up if anybody has any release dates.
1143200	1144200	How about the US, Loki?
1144200	1145200	There is not much.
1145200	1149800	And from what I gather, these four games are apparently a GameStop exclusive.
1149800	1154600	Good for them, I guess, scoring these awesome games, all of which are from a wonderful company,
1154600	1160920	a company named Conspiracy Entertainment, who is known for their extremely high quality
1160920	1161920	games.
1161920	1166880	Okay, no, not really, but you can get four racing games this week.
1166880	1178240	Rig Racer 2, which has you racing big rigs, Kawasaki Quad Bikes, Monster Trucks Off-Road,
1178240	1183920	and then Classic British Motor Racing.
1183920	1184920	Let me just save you time.
1184920	1186760	What exactly is Classic British Motor Racing?
1186760	1188000	Like an Aston Martin or...
1188000	1191640	No, it's like racing minis.
1191640	1193080	None of these games are that great.
1193080	1197600	Although, they do have a game coming out, though, that's going to be a jet ski racing
1197600	1201480	game, and it looks just like Waverly 64.
1201480	1207940	So that has potential, but I would, if you can rent these, go for it.
1207940	1208940	They're cheap.
1208940	1212680	I think they're like $19.99, so if you have money that you want to throw away, I can tell
1212680	1219760	you one thing, don't buy Monster Trucks Off-Road, because Monster Trucks, they had Off-Road
1219760	1224540	Arena or something like that, that really sucked, and then there is Off-Road Extreme
1224540	1229600	Special Edition, which got like a one on IGN.
1229600	1231540	It's like a piece of shit.
1231540	1236840	Most of these are crap, but just kind of know it going into it.
1236840	1238080	That's all you can find this week.
1238080	1240120	Next week, I promise you better games.
1240120	1241520	How about the UK, Jamie?
1241520	1245760	I'll give some highlights for what's coming out next week, just the things that interest
1245760	1246760	me specifically.
1246760	1248960	Why not?
1248960	1260440	There is Dancing Stage Universe, Myst on DS, SingStar on PS3, Sonic Rivals 2, I like, there's
1260440	1270880	one called Teleaddicts, which I think is great, and another Yu-Gi-Oh game, but I'll go over
1270880	1272760	the big massive list later.
1272760	1275960	How about the Virtual Console?
1275960	1282160	There is stuff for Virtual Console, this is the stuff actually that has been out now.
1282160	1290400	Three games that are to be out is Blades of Steel, which we've gone over, Skate or Die,
1290400	1291400	and Monster Lair.
1291400	1292400	So there you go.
1292400	1294600	We haven't gotten Skate or Die in the US, huh?
1294600	1295600	No.
1295600	1296600	I'll bet you that'll be Monday's game.
1296600	1298880	I'll bet you Monday will be Skate or Die.
1298880	1302440	Usually when it comes out in Europe we get it the next week, I noticed, and we did get
1302440	1303640	Blades of Steel here last week.
1303640	1306360	It's so weird the way they've been releasing those games, like you would think there'd
1306360	1312200	be some pattern to it, but it really just seems like it's just kind of a crap shoot.
1312200	1316160	This is the part where I would go over Japanese releases, but there is nothing, not a damn
1316160	1320460	thing I feel like mentioning, so that's it, no Japanese releases.
1320460	1325380	So that being said, we are going to open up the Skype line, 1877 Game OLR, username on
1325380	1329440	Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, and we're going to go over with you guys, our listeners, the
1329440	1334960	last few months of the year, and we also want to get your picks for the best game of 2007
1334960	1338220	and the worst game of 2007.
1338220	1342120	So go ahead and give us a call, and remember, if you've never used Skype before, you might
1342120	1348240	want to give Echo123 a call to make sure you sound okay.
1348240	1353720	Unless you're calling over the phone, then there's really nothing you can do to test.
1353720	1356800	Because there is a little bit of a delay between the live and when the people hear it, they
1356800	1360160	probably don't know it's open yet, so we're just trying to fill in a little bit of time
1360160	1361680	here.
1361680	1366060	Later on in the program, we're going to be going over our top five lists of the five
1366060	1370960	most fun games we played this year, and then we'll tally it up what overall was the best
1370960	1376680	and the worst game of 2007, and we'll give some predictions for 2008.
1376680	1381080	And we haven't forgotten the FUs either.
1381080	1387200	And of course, a lot of our regular callers are gone this week on vacation, away from
1387200	1390520	the holidays, so I think that's where, you know, if you're wondering, like, why isn't
1390520	1391520	our phone ringing off the hook?
1391520	1392520	I think that's why.
1392520	1393520	Who leaves for, like, New Year's?
1393520	1394520	I understand Christmas, but, I mean, I don't know.
1394520	1398400	I think people are still gone from Christmas, is what happens.
1398400	1404160	Oh, well.
1404160	1407200	So what's going to happen if nobody calls?
1407200	1408200	I'll do July.
1408200	1409200	Yeah, we'll just have to do it again.
1409200	1410200	Someone call us!
1410200	1411200	We can do it.
1411200	1412200	We don't always play with the chat room.
1412200	1413200	People are just being shy.
1413200	1414200	We have plenty of people in chat.
1414200	1418600	There's over, almost 50 people in chat, so I don't know what the heck's going on there.
1418600	1420000	Pick up your damn phone.
1420000	1421200	Don't you people have phones?
1421200	1422200	And call us.
1422200	1424400	Some folks are waiting for certain months.
1424400	1427080	No, you don't wait.
1427080	1428080	You do some R-terms.
1428080	1433520	Pick up the goddamn phone and your goddamn phone call.
1433520	1434520	We're getting a call.
1434520	1436760	I hear on Orange Line's radio, who's this?
1436760	1440280	Oh, this is the escapist.
1440280	1442120	Escapist is here.
1442120	1444120	I'm sorry, who's this?
1444120	1445120	Escapist.
1445120	1447480	Well, Escapist, how are you, sir?
1447480	1448480	How you doing?
1448480	1451960	I'm doing wonderful, yourself?
1451960	1452960	Very good.
1452960	1456080	There's a little bit of a delay, but I notice you're calling us from Canada, so that's probably
1456080	1457080	why there's a bit of a delay.
1457080	1458080	Okay.
1458080	1463220	All right, so I'm going to go through this rather quickly here, and we want to hear your
1463220	1466680	thoughts on some of the highlights of 2007.
1466680	1469240	So let's talk first a little bit about July.
1469240	1477120	July, episode 237 was when a brain game in the UK was pulled over the use of the word
1477120	1482380	spastic, and I apologize if I offended anyone by saying that word just then, but we kind
1482380	1486860	of hear in the US go, well, that's not a big deal, but in the UK, because it slipped through
1486860	1492000	the cracks because of those cultural differences, the word spastic got a brain game pulled over
1492000	1493480	in the UK.
1493480	1499040	Episode number 238 was when the PlayStation 3 got a price cut, so the PlayStation 3 was
1499040	1503080	announced that it was going to be getting a price cut, and a lot of folks said it needed
1503080	1506040	that about six months earlier.
1506040	1510440	Episode 239 was the week that mini E3 happened.
1510440	1514680	That was when Mario Kart Wii was announced for the Wii, and Cena was announced for the
1514680	1519540	360, and the PSP was announced that had a redesign, and just in general kind of the
1519540	1522360	changed E3.
1522360	1526520	Do you think low-key the E3 is going to be very similar to how it was this year or next
1526520	1530740	year, or do you think they're going to get kind of, especially since they're moving back
1530740	1533240	to the LA Convention Center, do you think they're going to get a little bit of maybe
1533240	1534240	what they missed?
1534240	1536280	I think it's going to be about the same.
1536280	1541080	Speaking of which, you need to talk to whoever was supposed to invite us last year, and get
1541080	1546680	them to invite, or this year I should say, and be ready for this next year, because I
1546680	1547680	want to go.
1547680	1549680	I do too, we'll see.
1549680	1558520	Yeah, all I remember from mini E3 is how disappointed I was with the Mario Kart and Zapper announcements.
1558520	1562680	Not necessarily Mario Kart, because Mario Kart's really fucking awesome, but the fact
1562680	1566600	that it comes with a plastic steering wheel, all these peripherals, they were like, God,
1566600	1571360	this is a stupid idea, who keeps releasing this crap, and Nintendo's like, hey, we're
1571360	1576160	going to do it too, that makes it a good idea, right, and then the Zapper we saw was like
1576160	1581640	a pretty cool attachment, kind of like the nunchuck, and then all of a sudden that's
1581640	1587120	this piece of plastic crap, I don't know, it wasn't all that exciting.
1587120	1589440	Escapist, did you follow mini E3 news?
1589440	1594960	What did you think of this year's E3, new and improved?
1594960	1599200	I kind of really ignored it this year, I don't know, I've never been a big fan of E3 to begin
1599200	1600200	with.
1600200	1604240	It was like a whole bunch of excitement for a couple months, and whatever.
1604240	1606520	What makes you not a fan of E3?
1606520	1614560	Just too much information at one time, I get kind of overloaded and overexcited a bit.
1614560	1620360	I can kind of see that, it does seem like the year is entirely dead, and then E3 happens,
1620360	1628000	and then it's dead again, you know what I mean?
1628000	1632800	Episode 240 was in July, it was the last episode we taped in July, and that was the week that
1632800	1638520	South Park, the World of Warcraft episode got nominated for an Emmy, which kind of made
1638520	1640120	a lot of us go, wow.
1640120	1641120	And it did win.
1641120	1646360	And it did end up winning the Emmy, actually, but of course the South Park wow episode integrated
1646360	1650920	the World of Warcraft very well with the South Park kids, but of course the one thing I remember
1650920	1654640	was bathroom, bathroom!
1654640	1661920	Alright, Escapist, out of those stories, the brain game, the price cut, mini E3 and South
1661920	1669280	Park World of Warcraft, what do you think had the biggest impact for 2007's gaming?
1669280	1674160	Well even though I just undermined it earlier, I'd definitely say the E3 there, just because
1674160	1677760	the whole new year for E3, a new direction they wanted to go, it's still the same kind
1677760	1682240	of information that got released from what I saw, but a lot less people go into it.
1682240	1685360	I think you're right, I think even though it is different, I think it definitely was
1685360	1687560	the highlight of the month and the year in some ways.
1687560	1694140	I think the way that they did E3, I mean besides the multiple hotels and it being kind of difficult
1694140	1698860	to travel from one place to another, I like the format where it's just like those gamers
1698860	1703720	days where you sit down, you get a presentation, here's all the games that we have, here's
1703720	1708520	all the information we're going to give you, then you move along to the next group or the
1708520	1714200	next company and you kind of digest all that stuff as well, you get your press kits, and
1714200	1719320	then you go play the games at the end, just like a gamers day, and that I think works
1719320	1723600	a lot better for me than having to just navigate all around because I end up missing stuff.
1723600	1732000	I agree, and I said this before on the show, the two years ago, the last big E3, I knew
1732000	1735800	something was wrong when Paris Hilton was there and drawing these big crowds because
1735800	1738720	she had some fucking crappy cell phone game coming out, right?
1738720	1740020	She got the name wrong on.
1740020	1743440	You knew that something was broken with E3 at that point?
1743440	1744440	Yeah.
1744440	1745440	Interesting.
1745440	1749520	All right, well let's move on to August, scapists, we're going to go over the four
1749520	1753200	stories and then you tell us which one you think had the most impact.
1753200	1757680	Episode 241 kicked off August and it was another WoW story because that was the week that Blizzcon
1757680	1763000	happened and Wrath of the Lich King was announced and of course obviously we even had some folks,
1763000	1767680	I remember Extifer, one of our regular guests, actually went to Blizzcon and came back with
1767680	1771960	a full report and of course a lot of WoW players were very excited about the Wrath of the Lich
1771960	1773760	King expansion.
1773760	1779480	Episode 242 was the week that the news was breaking that the Xbox 360 core system was
1779480	1781200	being phased out of stores.
1781200	1782520	And the price dropped, too.
1782520	1786920	Yeah, when Best Buy started to phase them out of their computers and Target was phasing
1786920	1790760	them out of their computers, the systems were slowly disappearing which kind of made people
1790760	1792680	go, hmm, what's going on there?
1792680	1798600	And then of course subsequently we learned about the Elite and all that stuff and the
1798600	1804280	Elite have been out, the arcade and the other stuff.
1804280	1808320	Episode 243, Toys R Us breaks the Bioshock street date.
1808320	1812560	Bioshock came out towards the end of August and Toys R Us broke the street date and people
1812560	1816320	were taking pictures of receipts and that stuff was all over the internet.
1816320	1820560	And then episode 244 in August was the week we talked about a brand new game Konami was
1820560	1825560	putting out called New International Track and Field and what made this story stand out,
1825560	1830160	the fact that there was going to be a cartoon version of Serial Killer Pyramid Head in the
1830160	1832520	game, a little chibi pyramid head game.
1832520	1836400	Now, the game is not out yet, but we were just talking about the announcement, although
1836400	1840240	I should say that if you saw the Christmas cards that some of the big game companies
1840240	1844120	put out, Konami actually had a little picture of chibi pyramid head in theirs and he was
1844120	1846640	opening up a box with new gloves in it.
1846640	1847760	It was so cute.
1847760	1848880	You just reminded me of something.
1848880	1850360	What's that?
1850360	1854480	My husband's boss gave him one of the Portal Christmas cards.
1854480	1856880	From Aperture Science?
1856880	1858040	I stole it.
1858040	1859320	Very good.
1859320	1861040	You got a card, but I stole it.
1861040	1867920	Anyhow, Escapist, out of those stories, Blizzcon, Xbox 360 core phased out, Toys R Us breaking
1867920	1871280	a street date, and New International Track and Field, or anything you can think of, what
1871280	1872280	do you think had the most impact?
1872280	1875400	I know that's a little bit of a tougher month because it was after E3, but what do you think
1875400	1877400	had the most impact?
1877400	1879400	Jeepers.
1879400	1887120	For me, I definitely have to say the Toys R Us thing was kind of a big deal there.
1887120	1890640	It's another insight into the distribution chain there that people are really excited
1890640	1894080	to get their games now and stuff like that.
1894080	1896320	Toys R Us isn't really paying attention.
1896320	1897320	I don't know.
1897320	1900600	I'm excited to be on air, that's all.
1900600	1901600	No, it's all good.
1901600	1905720	It's a very good point that you're saying there is that a big chain like Toys R Us you
1905720	1909760	would think would know better, but sometimes down on the lower levels, folks kind of make
1909760	1914160	their mistakes and all that stuff, and these things kind of slip through the cracks.
1914160	1917920	But it is very interesting when these types of things have happened, because there's been
1917920	1919920	a lot of similar stories throughout the year.
1919920	1927420	Kmart broke the Mass Effect street date, Target broke the word about the Xbox 360 arcade units
1927420	1929360	before even Microsoft had put them out, right?
1929360	1930360	Like, weren't they selling them?
1930360	1932800	Circuit City broke the PlayStation 3 prices throughout the day.
1932800	1934480	This kind of shit was happening all year long.
1934480	1941240	It's amazing to watch the internet's reaction to it all, but like the scans, the YouTubes,
1941240	1945720	the pictures of receipts in the game going, I have the biggest E-peen in the planet because
1945720	1947480	I have this game and you don't.
1947480	1951340	Like all that type of stuff is just fascinating to watch, and it was definitely a trend throughout
1951340	1952340	2007.
1952340	1955080	How many people were actually playing Halo 3 before that came out?
1955080	1956080	I did.
1956080	1957080	Excellent point.
1957080	1958460	I had already beaten it before it came out.
1958460	1962920	There you go, and that was another huge one, Halo 3, absolutely, and that was in August
1962920	1963920	as well, right?
1963920	1964920	October.
1964920	1965920	September.
1965920	1966920	Almost.
1966920	1967920	End of September.
1967920	1968920	When we get into the next month.
1968920	1969920	All right.
1969920	1972840	Well, Escapist, before we let you go, we have a few more things to ask you, and that would
1972840	1978440	be what, in your opinion, was the worst freaking game of 2007 that should be avoided at all
1978440	1979440	costs?
1979440	1984880	Well, normally I would go with the obvious pick like yours, except I actually didn't
1984880	1987600	play it, so that would kind of be a bit of a cop-out on my part.
1987600	1990680	Well, that's fair enough, but then we have to change it up.
1990680	1992680	What do you think, then?
1992680	1997720	I'm going to have to be annoying and say I didn't really like Call of Duty all that much.
1997720	2000240	Call of Duty 4 never really did anything for me.
2000240	2002040	Maybe you might see I'm not a true shooter fan or whatnot.
2002040	2005960	Maybe it's because I had a horrible time online playing it, but I don't know.
2005960	2009560	That's one of the games in my collection I'm probably going to get rid of first.
2009560	2010560	Oh, snap.
2010560	2012680	Call of Duty 4, worst game of the year.
2012680	2013680	Hey, you know what?
2013680	2014680	It happens.
2014680	2019480	I seem to remember last year, we had some of the guests from other podcasts, and I want
2019480	2023840	to say someone said that some really big game was their least favorite game of the year,
2023840	2027320	and it was definitely controversial, but it was really funny when it happened.
2027320	2031440	But Hannah Montana was the best, I think.
2031440	2032440	Gears of War.
2032440	2033440	No, that was different.
2033440	2034440	Yes, it was Gears of War.
2034440	2035440	I think somebody said Gears of War was the worst game that came out.
2035440	2038840	I think it was Michelle from Video Game Outsiders.
2038840	2039840	I think.
2039840	2040840	I don't remember.
2040840	2041840	I'd have to go back and listen, but anyway.
2041840	2042840	All right.
2042840	2043840	Never mind.
2043840	2044840	That was last year.
2044840	2045840	That was so 2006.
2045840	2046840	Let's talk about 2007.
2046840	2050400	Best game of 2007, Escapist, in your opinion?
2050400	2056880	Last time, I tried to avoid the obvious pick, but I have to go the obvious with this one.
2056880	2057880	It would have to be the Orange Box.
2057880	2061640	It's probably the best gaming value I've ever seen in my freaking life.
2061640	2062640	The Orange Box.
2062640	2065960	Five classic games all crammed in one bundle, and you can't ignore the Portal.
2065960	2067800	I can't say I disagree with you, sir.
2067800	2071940	The Orange Box is a great deal, and that right there makes it definitely a worthy candidate
2071940	2072940	for game of the year.
2072940	2076800	And then you have Portal in there as well, which of course is a brilliant game in itself.
2076800	2080480	Escapist, thanks so much for being on the show tonight, even though we had a little
2080480	2087080	bit of a delay with the cross boundaries there and everything between the U.S. and Canada,
2087080	2090360	but we really appreciate you being on the program, and thanks for listening in 2007.
2090360	2091360	Hope you have a great...
2091360	2092360	Thank you very much for having me.
2092360	2093360	Not a problem.
2093360	2094360	Hope you have a great 2008.
2094360	2095360	Hope I wasn't much more talkative yesterday.
2095360	2096360	Thanks, bud.
2096360	2097360	All right.
2097360	2098360	Take care, buddy.
2098360	2099360	All right.
2099360	2100360	You too.
2100360	2101360	All right.
2101360	2102360	Bye-bye.
2102360	2105920	Unfortunately, because of the distance there, he was breaking up a little bit.
2105920	2107760	All right.
2107760	2108760	Let's see.
2108760	2111760	We're going to move on to September.
2111760	2116000	We're going to get a call here and talk about September and October.
2116000	2119440	So the Skype line is open at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2119440	2120440	September and October.
2120440	2123860	And remember, if you don't get through for this one, there is still November and December.
2123860	2125400	We still have that to go over.
2125400	2126400	So let's see who's on the line.
2126400	2127400	Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.
2127400	2128400	Who's this?
2128400	2129400	Kia68.
2129400	2132600	Hey, you were the one that was waiting for September, weren't you?
2132600	2133600	Yeah.
2133600	2134600	Oh, wow.
2134600	2136160	You got knocked out, didn't you?
2136160	2137160	Yeah.
2137160	2138160	Because somebody else might have beat you to it.
2138160	2139160	All right.
2139160	2140160	Well, here it is.
2140160	2141160	We got September and October.
2141160	2142160	Let's start with September.
2142160	2143160	Now, September was our biggest month.
2143160	2146800	There were five Sundays in the month of September, so we did more shows in September than any
2146800	2148200	other month.
2148200	2152520	Starting off with Episode 245, Neo Geo titles were announced for the Nintendo Wii's Virtual
2152520	2153520	Console.
2153520	2159200	So of course, a lot of people were like, OMG, Magician's Lair, Magician Lord, and OMG, Fatal
2159200	2160400	Fury, and all this stuff.
2160400	2167040	What always surprised me about this was that Fatal Fury is like nine bucks on the Nintendo
2167040	2172200	Wii, or you can get the souped up version with the improved HD and online play for five
2172200	2173200	bucks.
2173200	2176240	Or you can get the original car for like a hundred.
2176240	2180000	Well, I think that kind of goes out the window now with Virtual Console.
2180000	2183520	Actually, Jamie, you collect the old school Neo Geo cartridges.
2183520	2184520	I have some.
2184520	2185520	You paid hundreds of dollars.
2185520	2187160	But you do have some that you paid hundreds of dollars for, right?
2187160	2192960	The only one that I paid, and I got it for two hundred and something, was I got a chance
2192960	2198840	to buy King of Fighters 2000 for relatively cheap.
2198840	2199920	Nice.
2199920	2204280	And so that's the one that we've paid the most for, but we've got like, Samurai Shodown,
2204280	2207680	Samurai Shodown 2, Baseball Stars.
2207680	2210560	What do you think, as a collector, what do you think about all this stuff now coming
2210560	2212960	out on Virtual Console for less than ten bucks?
2212960	2213960	Good!
2213960	2218880	Because I don't have the money to spend on this crap, although I did want Samurai Shodown
2218880	2219880	5.
2219880	2220880	Right.
2220880	2221880	I would pay the money for that.
2221880	2222880	Right.
2222880	2227400	Well, episode 246 was the episode where Sony was sending out to all the critics out there
2227400	2229160	a review guide for Lair.
2229160	2231160	It was just IGN.
2231160	2235760	Well, IGN kind of like posted it, but they were sending it to several critics, this whole
2235760	2237280	little guide on Lair.
2237280	2242000	And they said, no, we're not trying to sway people's decisions, but they just want to
2242000	2245200	make sure everybody understood the game.
2245200	2246840	And the six-axis control, right?
2246840	2250400	But it was a very nicely bound little book.
2250400	2253440	Episode number 247 was the episode where Project Hammer was cancelled.
2253440	2258160	I wonder if any of those review guides went on the old eBay.
2258160	2259560	You know, we never looked.
2259560	2260560	We should have.
2260560	2261560	We could have put one up here in the studio.
2261560	2263560	It would have been fun.
2263560	2266240	Anyway, 247 was when Project Hammer was cancelled.
2266240	2269640	This is a game that looked to be a hell of a lot of fun when we saw it at E3, but apparently
2269640	2272680	somebody at Nintendo decided it wasn't good enough.
2272680	2276800	Sorry, Project Hammer reminds me too much of MC Hammer, and that's like so ten years
2276800	2277800	ago.
2277800	2278800	Exactly.
2278800	2280560	Project MC Hammer.
2280560	2284480	Reverend Hammer.
2284480	2289000	Episode number 248 was the week that Smash Bros. was announced that it was going to be
2289000	2290600	going online.
2290600	2293000	And of course, that caused a lot of people to go, whoo!
2293000	2296560	Of course, later on it was announced that it still has frame codes.
2296560	2304160	And the whole, the whole like thing with people just getting the computer, taking over and
2304160	2305160	stuff.
2305160	2306160	Okay.
2306160	2307160	Oh yeah, yeah.
2307160	2308160	That's weird.
2308160	2311560	I'm trying to get off topic here a little bit, but apparently, what was it, not Brothers
2311560	2318640	N'Arcs, Medal of Honor 2, or Heroes 2, is online, 32 players, and if I remember correctly,
2318640	2321880	does not have friends codes for the Wii.
2321880	2322880	Nice.
2322880	2326400	So why can't everybody do that?
2326400	2329960	Your guess is as good as mine.
2329960	2334880	So that was episode 248, and of course it was a five week month, episode 249, that was
2334880	2340920	the week that the Sex Pistols, it was announced that they were getting back together to re-record
2340920	2344340	the song Anarchy in the UK for Guitar Hero 3.
2344340	2348480	And of course, this is big news, I think, not so much like just the song itself or what
2348480	2353440	have you, but just the fact that, you know, video games, and especially a series like
2353440	2359800	Guitar Hero 3 has transcended the music game genre so much that bands that had been broken
2359800	2363240	up were coming back together for the purposes of recording for the game.
2363240	2367920	I mean, that in my mind is huge, especially as an old school music gaming fan.
2367920	2374420	So GS68, those are the five stories we picked, the Neo Geo titles on the Wii, Sony sending
2374420	2378760	out a review guide for Lair, Project Hammer getting cancelled, Smash Brothers going online,
2378760	2381120	Sex Pistols re-recording Anarchy in the UK.
2381120	2383640	Do you think one of those stories was the biggest one out in September, or do you have
2383640	2384640	your own pick?
2384640	2388640	I have my own from episode 247, I think.
2388640	2389640	What's that?
2389640	2394440	It's one about the New Jersey parents being upset about the Wii Zapper.
2394440	2397520	You know, I was looking at that one when I was going through the show rules today, yeah,
2397520	2399920	the New Jersey parents being upset about the Wii Zapper.
2399920	2401920	Why do you think that was the biggest impact?
2401920	2409760	Well, I mean, like 20 years ago, the Wii Zapper, I mean, the NES Zapper, I mean, no one complained
2409760	2415960	about that, and then Super Nintendo had a Super Scope, I don't think anyone complained,
2415960	2422120	and a whole bunch of systems after that, but, like, a gunproof on the Wii, oh my gosh, you
2422120	2424120	must ban this.
2424120	2427880	I have a pick for the new story.
2427880	2428880	What do you think, Logie?
2428880	2435800	Halo 3 is released, come on, I mean, seriously, everyone's like, oh my god, Halo 3!
2435800	2438320	Yeah, but I don't know, well, yeah, it was.
2438320	2443640	I think the reason why it was overlooked here is because, you know, it kind of, well, no,
2443640	2448120	it's not that, because I do care about Halo 3, but just that most of the Halo 3 news was
2448120	2452600	everything leading up to its release, you know what I mean?
2452600	2453600	Yeah, I wonder.
2453600	2457600	Okay, how about this, episode, you know, 246 or whatever, it is announced that you cannot
2457600	2459560	put the helmets on your cat.
2459560	2461120	But that is disappointing.
2461120	2462840	Biggest news of the month.
2462840	2466160	Biggest news of 2007, honestly.
2466160	2468120	You okay, Jamie?
2468120	2470520	Blink blink blink.
2470520	2473400	Would you try to put the helmet on your cat, on Shermie?
2473400	2474400	Shermie's too stupid.
2474400	2475400	Yes, GS68.
2475400	2480520	Wait, can we put it on the, can we put the helmet on the ferret?
2480520	2482360	Can we put the helmet on the ferret?
2482360	2483360	We probably could.
2483360	2484680	If we could find the ferret, we could.
2484680	2488720	The ferret ran hiding since Rob threatened to put him down the food trash compactor.
2488720	2489720	I did, I did.
2489720	2492640	I think, I think Scarecrow's the penguin.
2492640	2494440	Possibly the new penguin from Argentina.
2494440	2495840	The penguin is frightening.
2495840	2498160	He is pretty fierce, he's very punk rock.
2498160	2501240	Alright, let's go on to October, our show's going to go on all night.
2501240	2506080	October, episode 250, that was a big week for us, because it was our 250th episode.
2506080	2510720	That was also the week that Nintendo announced that they were going to be offering what we
2510720	2515160	call the Wii Condoms, or, you know, the Wii, what are they officially called?
2515160	2517160	The Wii Sleeves or something like that?
2517160	2518160	Yeah.
2518160	2519160	But they look like giant Wii Condoms.
2519160	2520160	If it's true.
2520160	2523280	When you mode into the TV, you're probably stupid.
2523280	2524280	Exactly.
2524280	2526440	So it was definitely a way of nerfing the Wiimote.
2526440	2529720	But what was weird about that story is that no one was really expecting it.
2529720	2530720	You know what I mean?
2530720	2531720	Like, it came out of nowhere.
2531720	2534760	And like, it's like, oh, we're going to put out these straps that are better in this.
2534760	2537360	And then finally, it's like, oh, we're also going to put out these giant things that make
2537360	2539480	your Wiimote look like it's wrapped in a condom.
2539480	2541480	And people were like, what?
2541480	2542480	Why?
2542480	2543480	This is very interesting.
2543480	2546880	Episode 251 was- A broken episode.
2546880	2549560	Yes, that was a broken episode.
2549560	2554860	And the week that it was announced that Smash Brothers was delayed to 2008.
2554860	2558240	So Smash Brothers was completely delayed to 2008.
2558240	2563920	And that did not sit well with a lot of Nintendo Wii fans, sadly.
2563920	2568680	252 was a very big week, because that was the week that Capcom announced their goodies
2568680	2573960	for 2008, including Street Fighter IV was announced that week, as well as the next generation
2573960	2575440	version of Bionic Commando.
2575440	2576440	Fuck yeah.
2576440	2578240	Did you see the trailer for that?
2578240	2579400	Yeah, I've seen that one.
2579400	2580400	Isn't it pretty?
2580400	2581400	It is.
2581400	2582400	And it plays the music.
2582400	2585800	These little fangasms that we're having now is just reminiscent of what was happening
2585800	2586800	that third week in October.
2586800	2590240	I'm so excited right now, and it's going to be very disappointing when the game actually
2590240	2591240	comes out.
2591240	2593680	And I wonder if he's going to kill Hitler at the end.
2593680	2594680	I hope so.
2594680	2596760	That would be definitely the coup de grace.
2596760	2601640	And then the last show we taped in October, episode number 253, was the week that it was
2601640	2606120	discovered that Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3 are not playing nice.
2606120	2609040	The controllers were not compatible with each other.
2609040	2612720	If you wanted to play both games, you had to use Guitar Hero 2 controllers, but Guitar
2612720	2616040	Hero 3 on at least Playstation 3 was not compatible with each other.
2616040	2618120	We've been using our Xbox ones.
2618120	2620920	Xbox, I think, works one way, but it doesn't work the other way.
2620920	2621920	It works with Rock Band.
2621920	2624760	Yeah, it works with Rock Band, but the controller doesn't work with Guitar Hero 3.
2624760	2627720	It'd be better if they made a controller that didn't break.
2627720	2631400	Or just that they just would let them both be, you know, a lot of people are like, this
2631400	2634160	just sucks that they can't get along.
2634160	2636140	And I agree, it sucks that they can't get along.
2636140	2639120	What do you think GS68 was the biggest, or if you have one of your own, feel free to
2639120	2640120	share.
2640120	2644360	Nintendo offering Wii Condoms, Smash Brothers delayed, Capcom announces Street Fighter IV
2644360	2648720	and Bionic Commando, or Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3 just can't play nice.
2648720	2654020	I'm not too sure, I'm not, I don't really remember October too well.
2654020	2662560	But I'll probably guess, I'll probably guess Street Fighter IV, the Wiimote gloves, I guess.
2662560	2663560	The Wiimote gloves?
2663560	2665480	Yeah, that was pretty big.
2665480	2668800	I don't know, me personally, I would say the Smash Brothers delay, I know that seems weird
2668800	2673040	because then you kind of go, well that's a 2008 story, but that was a game that people
2673040	2677760	were so looking forward to and especially on the Wii that really needed some powerhouse
2677760	2682120	games, although I guess, I guess it didn't, it did pretty well this Christmas regardless,
2682120	2685600	but you know, just so many people were looking forward to that game, it was just a real disappointment
2685600	2686600	when that game got delayed.
2686600	2690120	If it wasn't for the delay, I'd be playing it right now.
2690120	2691200	We all would.
2691200	2693760	We probably wouldn't be doing this show, we would be playing Smash Brothers Brawl right
2693760	2695000	now.
2695000	2698960	And that's, you know, again, all the more reason why that game's got to be twice as
2698960	2703440	good or, you know, people are going to kind of go, oh we waited all this time for this?
2703440	2708000	Given all these delays, I have a feeling people are going to start calling it Super Smash
2708000	2709240	Brothers Forever.
2709240	2711360	I think somebody did earlier in chat actually.
2711360	2712360	It was me.
2712360	2717600	Alright, GS68, what in your opinion was the worst freaking game of 2007?
2717600	2725960	I'll probably have, I haven't played a lot of crappy games that were released in 2007,
2725960	2731920	but I might have, I'll probably give it to Initial D4.
2731920	2735760	Initial D4, Initial D4, why Initial D4?
2735760	2743680	Well, mainly because it was a program, so like, apparently there's this whole speed
2743680	2748960	limit system where if you go too fast on a certain corner your wheel locks and your acceleration
2748960	2755880	submers, and there's this penalty cancel glitch where you hit the brake to remove the acceleration
2755880	2762880	problem, and from what I've read, like, the recent official Initial D tournament is the
2762880	2767600	last one they're going to do because I've read that Initial D4 stopped doing very well
2767600	2768600	in Japan.
2768600	2775240	Like, over in Hong Kong, for example, Version 3 is doing better than Initial D4.
2775240	2777720	Wow, that is something else.
2777720	2782840	Well, that's a bummer that it really sucked it up on its fourth version.
2782840	2785040	I haven't even really played that one.
2785040	2787240	I've played Initial D3 though, that's a fun time.
2787240	2789240	Anyway, I'm sorry, go ahead.
2789240	2791560	Yeah, and what else?
2791560	2808800	Like, the tuning system for the game, like, if you want to, yeah, sorry.
2808800	2809800	That's alright.
2809800	2814000	You were going to say another game that you thought was the worst of the year?
2814000	2822080	Actually, no, I was going to bring up the whole customizing shop feature, instead of,
2822080	2828520	you have to eject your card three times just to get to that, so you have to point to the
2828520	2834560	continue screen, eject your card, and then to play, and then put your coins in, and then
2834560	2839320	start the game again, so that way you can get to the tuning shop faster.
2839320	2843640	In other words, it's a way to keep sucking up your money and sucking up your tokens.
2843640	2849120	Actually, that will only be in the case of if you had discounted continues, like five
2849120	2852680	points to start and four points to continue.
2852680	2853680	Interesting.
2853680	2857760	Well, okay, let's move on and stop talking about games that suck, and let's talk about
2857760	2860320	the best freaking game of 2007 in your opinion.
2860320	2863720	What was the best game in your opinion?
2863720	2865400	Maximum Tune 3.
2865400	2866640	Interesting.
2866640	2869980	You must be a real racing game fan, because you got both for your best and worst.
2869980	2873560	Why was Maximum Tune 3 your best game of the year?
2873560	2877880	I like what they did with the battle system, like instead of picking a set course, you
2877880	2881900	can now pick the route like partway through the game.
2881900	2886920	They also added new courses, like you cannot race on the whole one gun line instead of
2886920	2890800	just like a six kilometer stretch, which was pretty cool.
2890800	2894480	The soundtrack was pretty cool, more music-assuring stuff.
2894480	2895480	Absolutely.
2895480	2902920	And the ghost battle system, like the idea of racing a virtual opponent instead of them
2902920	2905400	having to be there.
2905400	2911800	Yeah, I've been listening to the soundtrack to Maximum Tune 3 in my car recently, actually.
2911800	2914880	And the thing I find about it, though, is if I listen to it too much, I drive too fast.
2914880	2918000	I speed way more often when I'm listening to wang game music than anything else, so
2918000	2919000	there you go.
2919000	2920000	Well, do you...
2920000	2921000	Yo, go ahead.
2921000	2926200	Isn't my CD player like 80 to 90 percent of the time?
2926200	2931400	I think it's music that was designed to put the pedal to the floor, and it happens in
2931400	2932400	my real car.
2932400	2933400	It's an unfortunate thing.
2933400	2944760	I think the soundtrack and the graphics are meant to give the game a rave-ish look.
2944760	2949920	Several years ago, there was a game called Wanken Midnight, and the graphics and soundtrack
2949920	2952320	were nothing like Maximum Tunes.
2952320	2959360	Well, sometimes it happens that you have a series that's kind of similar, but I don't
2959360	2960360	know.
2960360	2962360	What are you talking about?
2962360	2969320	Like, there were older Wanken Midnight games released in 2001, and they were based on Tokyo
2969320	2971920	Extreme Racer.
2971920	2977240	And they looked and sounded nothing like Maximum Tune, because I guess Maximum Tune was made
2977240	2982240	to be more arcade-friendly.
2982240	2983240	I guess true.
2983240	2986760	Well, Wanken Midnight was actually us fighting the stuff on the manga.
2986760	2991280	Yeah, that was bullshit on manga.
2991280	2995240	All right, well, hey, GS68, we've got to let you go, because we've got some more months
2995240	3004720	to go over, but I'll leave you with this thought of us all raving in the car right now.
3004720	3006400	Let's drop some ecstasy while it's hot.
3006400	3007400	No, just kidding.
3007400	3008400	All right.
3008400	3012200	We've got to let you go, GS68, but thank you so much, and have a great 2008, all right?
3012200	3013200	Thanks, you too.
3013200	3015200	All right, take care, buddy.
3015200	3020560	All right, we're looking for one more call to help us close out the year with November
3020560	3021560	and December.
3021560	3026620	If you want to give us a call right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
3026620	3027620	But we've got our caller.
3027620	3029000	Hi, who's on the air?
3029000	3030000	Yeah.
3030000	3032880	I'd recognize that laugh anywhere.
3032880	3034800	This is Legend of Zaku, isn't it?
3034800	3036160	Yes, it is.
3036160	3037480	What is up, my friend?
3037480	3041400	Nothing much, just waiting till tomorrow.
3041400	3042400	What's tomorrow?
3042400	3043400	Waiting for that ball.
3043400	3047400	You know, that ball dropping in that middle of that big city on the base of the earth.
3047400	3048920	Oh, yes, I've heard of that before.
3048920	3052200	Are you going out to Times Square tomorrow?
3052200	3057720	Probably not, but I am getting drunk tomorrow legitimately.
3057720	3058720	You're not drunk now?
3058720	3059720	With friends, no.
3059720	3061920	All right, but you'll be drunk tomorrow.
3061920	3068960	Yeah, just going over the year that was 2007 in gaming.
3068960	3075000	Are you ready to go over November with us?
3075000	3078440	I don't have my memory associated, but let's do it.
3078440	3079520	I'll help you.
3079520	3083400	I've got four stories here to help remind you what happened in November.
3083400	3100160	Episode 254 was the week that Manhunt 2 on the PSP was hack-sored to remove some of the
3100160	3108480	target basically quickly rushed to judgment and pulled it off even though there's no way
3108480	3113120	in hell you're going to get to it unless you have massive experience in PSP hacking.
3113120	3116520	But Loki, you did it the day this thing came out, didn't you?
3116520	3122120	You had your PSP stripped of the censored stuff in it.
3122120	3123120	Was it worth it?
3123120	3124120	No.
3124120	3131360	Was it worth it for fucking genitals getting like, I don't know, basically hurt?
3131360	3134160	Isn't that what got censored?
3134160	3139480	Weren't the genitals, what do you call it, hurt?
3139480	3140480	Yes.
3140480	3142120	Electrocuted, mashed.
3142120	3144440	They were ripped off of pliers.
3144440	3145440	Ew.
3145440	3147440	Oh, wow.
3147440	3150800	Yeah, this game sounds pretty horrible.
3150800	3151840	I didn't even play it.
3151840	3153440	I don't need to.
3153440	3154440	Let's see.
3154440	3155440	Episode number 255.
3155440	3156440	That was the week.
3156440	3157440	This was a slow news week.
3157440	3158720	I didn't have a lot from this week.
3158720	3161720	NPD withholds sales numbers from the press.
3161720	3167040	And actually, it is kind of relevant because, you know, obviously it kind of leaves it in
3167040	3169920	the company's hands to be kind of bragging.
3169920	3173960	And you've seen companies kind of stretch these reports out a little bit.
3173960	3174960	Of course.
3174960	3175960	They want a piece.
3175960	3176960	They're stockholders.
3176960	3177960	Exactly.
3177960	3178960	You don't want to.
3178960	3179960	What the hell?
3179960	3180960	Are you at a 7-Eleven or something?
3180960	3184320	I heard a little phone go off.
3184320	3185320	Yeah, what's up?
3185320	3187320	It sounds like the phone's at 7-Eleven when they ring.
3187320	3189360	Yeah, my phone just went off.
3189360	3190360	Just keep coming quickly.
3190360	3191360	Sorry, sir.
3191360	3195480	But when we say withhold, they didn't withhold everything.
3195480	3200200	They just reduced some of the information that was going out there and caused the companies
3200200	3201960	to basically be on their own.
3201960	3204360	Jesus Christ, you got a beeper too?
3204360	3205360	Yeah.
3205360	3207240	He's got a beeper.
3207240	3209240	Maybe we should get another caller.
3209240	3210240	He's got a pimp.
3210240	3211240	All right.
3211240	3212240	Hold on a second.
3212240	3213240	I'll be right back.
3213240	3214240	Yeah.
3214240	3215240	What happened?
3215240	3216240	You are not putting us on hold.
3216240	3217240	We will hang up on you.
3217240	3218240	Okay.
3218240	3219240	Okay.
3219240	3220240	Okay.
3220240	3221240	Bye.
3221240	3222240	Yeah.
3222240	3223240	Hello.
3223240	3224240	All right.
3224240	3227240	I can't believe we got put on hold by a caller.
3227240	3228240	No, no, no.
3228240	3229240	It was only quickly.
3229240	3230240	All right.
3230240	3231240	Let's.
3231240	3232240	All right.
3232240	3233240	Let's.
3233240	3234240	All right.
3234240	3235240	Ooh.
3235240	3236240	Strike one, Zaku.
3236240	3237240	All right.
3237240	3238240	Episode 256 was the week.
3238240	3239240	What a way to end the year.
3239240	3240240	Yeah.
3240240	3241240	Week number 256.
3241240	3242240	Episode 256.
3242240	3247280	That was the week that the Xbox download service was announced on the Xbox 360.
3247280	3251780	You would be able to download original Xbox games to the service, and of course we've
3251780	3255360	seen this come out now, and you can get Psychonauts and Indigo Prophecy.
3255360	3258880	Kind of a way to rediscover Xbox games you may have missed the first time around.
3258880	3262240	Or for some people, a way overpriced way to do it.
3262240	3263240	Well, yeah.
3263240	3264240	Of course.
3264240	3265240	The marketplace.
3265240	3271680	So who the hell would put price tags on fucking icons and themes, and basically do it against
3271680	3276400	the will of game developers as well when they don't want to charge for that shit for downloadable
3276400	3277400	content?
3277400	3278400	Loki, do you agree?
3278400	3279400	You don't.
3279400	3280400	Like Epic, for example.
3280400	3285040	They don't want to do that shit, but they're forced to, because they have no choice most
3285040	3286040	of the time.
3286040	3290800	Why do you think Unreal Tournament 3 is being held up for the 360, besides the user-created
3290800	3291800	stuff?
3291800	3295600	Well, it's being held up because they can't do cross-platform play between the PC and
3295600	3296600	the PC.
3296600	3300880	Well, that too, but user-created mods is the other hinging factor.
3300880	3303440	Well, they can worry about that later.
3303440	3306320	That's not really a factor to keep it from being released.
3306320	3309040	Ah, god damn it.
3309040	3310040	Jesus Christ!
3310040	3312040	Is someone at the door now?
3312040	3313280	Just go through the last song.
3313280	3314280	The last one.
3314280	3315280	Yes, sir.
3315280	3319880	Guitar Hero's 80s edition sued because the song is too similar.
3319880	3324720	The romantic suit Guitar Hero 80s edition, and as we all know they lost, the judge laughed
3324720	3325720	that out of court.
3325720	3328680	All right, out of those stories, Van Hunt, too, Guitar Hero.
3328680	3329680	The first one.
3329680	3333440	Wait, are you going to give us your best one?
3333440	3336700	That's why you don't answer the phone.
3336700	3339440	You let it go to voicemail.
3339440	3348520	Tony, you're the one that keeps answering the calls for him, man.
3348520	3349520	That's just not cool.
3349520	3351040	Dip it in the butt.
3351040	3354600	That's just not cool.
3354600	3358000	I'm sorry.
3358000	3361400	I'm not offended because I think it's hilarious, honestly.
3361400	3362400	I'm offended.
3362400	3364480	All right, the first one, bye.
3364480	3366560	No, no, no, no, no, no.
3366560	3367560	Fuck that.
3367560	3368560	I'm doing December.
3368560	3369880	All right, no, I will see.
3369880	3372120	Let me open up Skype, see if anybody else wants to call us.
3372120	3373560	Give it a couple minutes.
3373560	3380880	One eight seven seven game O-L-R or our user name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3380880	3385520	Act deft in chat says best call ever, ever.
3385520	3391800	If somebody would like to call us and take Zaku's place, you can call us right now.
3391800	3400360	One eight seven seven game O-L-R or our user name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3400360	3404120	I'm going to give it like 10 seconds and I'm just going to say, Loki, fuck it, you can
3404120	3405120	just do it.
3405120	3407960	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3407960	3408960	Who's this?
3408960	3409960	This is DT.
3409960	3412360	Praise be to God, Dark Tetsuya.
3412360	3413920	How are you, my friend?
3413920	3415760	Oh, good.
3415760	3418160	Think you can do a better job than the last caller?
3418160	3419160	Yeah.
3419160	3420160	All right.
3420160	3422560	Well, let me recap for you, Dark Tetsuya.
3422560	3424760	When we left off, we were in November.
3424760	3427000	Manhunt 2 on the PSP was hacked.
3427000	3431440	MPD withholds sales numbers from the press, Xbox originals are announced for download
3431440	3436480	on Xbox 360, and Guitar Hero's 80s edition gets sued because the songs are too similar.
3436480	3439120	What do you think had the biggest impact in November?
3439120	3442600	Oh, Manhunt 2, definitely.
3442600	3443600	Definitely.
3443600	3446120	Just because of the fallout that came with that, right?
3446120	3447120	Oh, yeah.
3447120	3448120	Absolutely.
3448120	3452600	You would have thought they would have learned with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, but no.
3452600	3454960	Oh, no, no.
3454960	3457680	Everything tells me this won't be the last time, either.
3457680	3458680	Oh, no.
3458680	3459680	All right.
3459680	3464560	Well, then we move on to December, and in December, we had episode number 258.
3464560	3468440	Now, technically, this happened in November, but we covered it in December, so we're putting
3468440	3470160	it in December's news.
3470160	3476480	That was the week that a certain editor was let go from a certain major gaming blog, allegedly
3476480	3480000	due to a certain review that he had written about a certain game that was being heavily
3480000	3481680	advertised on the site.
3481680	3482680	That's right.
3482680	3488720	That's Jeff Gerstmann, and really, you could just say that name, The Gerstmann Incident,
3488720	3491880	and have you even seen, now there's movie trailers and shit and everything, like fake
3491880	3492880	movie trailers?
3492880	3493880	Yeah, because people have that much free time.
3493880	3499920	Honestly, though, if no one brought it back up, would you still remember, I completely
3499920	3504920	forgot about this, and thank God, because all you need to know is not to trust the bigger
3504920	3505920	sites.
3505920	3506920	Trust us, because we're awesome.
3506920	3511480	Well, I stand by what I said before, that there's multiple sides to every story, and
3511480	3516440	actually, oddly enough, you would think me, of all people, would be the biggest critic
3516440	3520240	of GameSpot in this situation, but I actually think people didn't give them enough credit.
3520240	3521240	No.
3521240	3522880	And I think we're too quick to blame the big corpse.
3522880	3523880	I just didn't care.
3523880	3525200	I was getting annoyed at that point.
3525200	3526760	I'm like, thank God they fired you.
3526760	3528400	This story's taking too long.
3528400	3531840	All right, well, there was other news in December.
3531840	3537880	Episode 259 was Nintendo pulls ads due to the high demand of the Nintendo Wii.
3537880	3543240	They basically said, okay, we can't make these Wiis fast enough.
3543240	3544240	Everybody still wants one.
3544240	3547880	You know, maybe we'll hold off on the advertising until the first quarter next year.
3547880	3548880	Well, that makes sense.
3548880	3553200	I mean, if you're going to, you know, you're having no problem selling one item, why do
3553200	3554520	you need to advertise it?
3554520	3559240	Advertise it for one, that may not be selling as well, and they have a little bit more of,
3559240	3562080	so it makes sense to me.
3562080	3568840	In episode number 260, DVR and internet radio launches on Sony PSPs in Japan.
3568840	3573480	And funny enough, later that week, internet radio actually followed in the US, and that
3573480	3575380	was released on the PSPs a little later.
3575380	3580320	So the PSPs get the doors open to DVR and internet radio in Japan and internet radio
3580320	3581760	here in the US.
3581760	3588380	And then that takes us all the way to episode number 261, which was earlier tonight.
3588380	3593760	And in part A, we talked about Akira Yamaoka comes out and says that Japanese development's
3593760	3597880	in trouble, and that the American development's where it's at right now, and of course Silent
3597880	3600640	Hill 5 is being developed right here in America.
3600640	3604200	What do you think out of those four stories, Dark Tetsuya had the biggest impact on gaming
3604200	3606360	in 2007?
3606360	3611240	Jeff Gertzman in the fallout there, Nintendo pulling ads due to the Wii demand, DVR and
3611240	3618760	internet radio hits the PSP, or Akira Yamaoka saying that development is, it's in America
3618760	3619760	is where it's at.
3619760	3620760	Oh, Gertzman, definitely.
3620760	3625720	Yeah, I think that's kind of a no-brainer, but why do you say that?
3625720	3628120	What do you think is the fallout that that could have in 2008?
3628120	3639080	Well, I don't know, it was like back in the day, I don't know if you remember, it was
3639080	3646280	when EGM gave Super Street Fighter II poor scores, Capcom pulled advertising.
3646280	3650240	I don't recall this so much, but now that you're saying it, I kind of go, yeah, you
3650240	3651560	know what, that does kind of sound familiar.
3651560	3655040	I do remember something like that happening, right?
3655040	3656040	Yeah.
3656040	3661480	So it kind of just goes to show this is something that kind of has happened before and has kind
3661480	3667200	of made a lot of people go, you know, there needs to be responsibility on both ends.
3667200	3671540	And again, as I do a lot, I compare things to the movie industry, you know, just because
3671540	3675000	Siskel and Ebert might give a movie a bad review, well, Siskel doesn't review anything
3675000	3683720	anymore, but just because Ebert and Roper, Ebert gives a thumbs up, Siskel's rrrr brains,
3683720	3689160	Ebert and Roper might give something a bad review doesn't mean that suddenly, you know,
3689160	3691040	they're going to stop advertising in the Chicago newspaper.
3691040	3696200	Siskel won't get me out of Ebert's stomach.
3696200	3702520	Ah, forget it, it's been plenty of time, it's not too soon anymore.
3702520	3706320	I want this show to be over, so we need to get to the best and worst games of the year.
3706320	3710960	Dark Tetsuya, in your big opinion, what was the worst freaking game of 2007?
3710960	3719480	Oh, God, I hadn't really played all that much, so I guess it goes with Yaris.
3719480	3721040	When in doubt, Yaris, right?
3721040	3722040	When in doubt.
3722040	3723040	Right.
3723040	3725960	You drive a car with a claw, enough said.
3725960	3729480	Alright, what was the best game of 2007, in your opinion?
3729480	3735560	Oh, God, I just rented it, Super Mario Galaxy.
3735560	3737120	And why this game?
3737120	3744600	Well, it's what Mario 64 2 should have been.
3744600	3747160	Instead of what we got on the GameCube, Super Mario Sunshine?
3747160	3748160	Yeah.
3748160	3749160	Gotcha.
3749160	3750160	Exactly.
3750160	3751160	Alright.
3751160	3754160	Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?
3754160	3756880	No, that's about it.
3756880	3757880	Alright.
3757880	3762480	Alright, well, Dark Tetsuya, thanks so much for calling and helping us out with the rest
3762480	3763480	of the year.
3763480	3764480	We appreciate it.
3764480	3765480	Have a good one.
3765480	3766480	Yeah, you too.
3766480	3767480	Alright.
3767480	3768480	Take care.
3768480	3772760	Dark Tetsuya, of course, writes for our website once in a while when there's news to report
3772760	3773760	on.
3773760	3777660	Legend of Zaku posted his picks in chat.
3777660	3781120	He would have picked God of War 2 for the best game of the year and Kane and Lynch for
3781120	3782120	the worst game of the year.
3782120	3785640	Well, ha ha, you were answering the phone while you were on the phone with us, so yours
3785640	3790000	doesn't count, rude person.
3790000	3792840	There you have it if you were curious.
3792840	3795840	Alright, that took us through the whole year.
3795840	3796940	What a trip down memory lane.
3796940	3798120	What a long trip down memory lane.
3798120	3802360	But it just goes to show us a fucking lot's happened this year.
3802360	3805260	A lot's happened this year.
3805260	3810280	What do you guys think was the biggest story out of them all?
3810280	3813760	What do you think, of all those stories we did tonight, what do you think maybe had the
3813760	3815940	most impact in gaming altogether?
3815940	3819360	When we called your mom.
3819360	3822180	And how did that impact the gaming scene?
3822180	3826520	It put me in a good mood and I went home and played a game.
3826520	3829320	I hate you.
3829320	3831200	We called my mom too.
3831200	3833640	What would you say is the story of the year?
3833640	3837040	Was it Manhunt 2?
3837040	3838800	Was it Smash Brothers getting delayed?
3838800	3841500	Was it Codemasters and the broken Bubble Bobble game?
3841500	3844100	Was it the lady dying over the Nintendo Wii?
3844100	3849360	So many people wanted a Wii that she drank so much she died?
3849360	3851360	I think it was Proteus.
3851360	3852360	Proteus?
3852360	3854560	I would say probably the biggest story of the year.
3854560	3855560	I don't know.
3855560	3858160	For me, it's the Bubble Bobble thing.
3858160	3859160	It really is.
3859160	3864100	Because seriously, seriously, how do you do that?
3864100	3866040	How does that happen?
3866040	3867360	Seriously.
3867360	3870240	But that's just me.
3870240	3871240	All right.
3871240	3872240	Loki?
3872240	3882440	I would say, not Bubble Bobble, because seriously, how many people bought Bubble Bobble?
3882440	3883440	That affected what?
3883440	3884440	Five people?
3884440	3887200	Seriously.
3887200	3897320	I would say probably, I don't know, the fact that it's a crime that Activision released
3897320	3902360	three Guitar Hero games this year.
3902360	3903360	Huh?
3903360	3905360	Yeah, that's a crime.
3905360	3912080	I don't know, let me think.
3912080	3913440	Was that last year or this year?
3913440	3917400	I can't remember when Red Octane was purchased by Activision.
3917400	3918400	Last year?
3918400	3919400	That was last year.
3919400	3920400	All right.
3920400	3921400	Well, let's move on.
3921400	3925520	Let's talk about our top five games of the year and our picks for the worst game of the
3925520	3926520	year.
3926520	3927760	We're just out of the way.
3927760	3931320	The worst game of the year, we're going to tally it up with what the listeners say and
3931320	3932320	figure it out here.
3932320	3934680	DarkStalker, what in your opinion was the worst game of the year?
3934680	3935680	The worst game?
3935680	3936680	I actually have a list of five.
3936680	3938120	You have a list of five?
3938120	3939120	All right.
3939120	3940120	The worst games of the year.
3940120	3944960	I'm going to say Manhunt 2 was one of them, just because I got sick of hearing all the
3944960	3945960	crap.
3945960	3946960	Imagine Babies.
3946960	3947960	Okay.
3947960	3949800	Although that was a funny picture with you.
3949800	3954200	Anything with the Bratz franchise, and I'll say Yaris too, just because.
3954200	3956540	But I got warnings, so I didn't play it.
3956540	3960880	And then I have to put this one on here for sauce.
3960880	3961880	This is a quote.
3961880	3966520	Heroes of Mana is the worst game of 2007 because you need a doctorate in electrical engineering
3966520	3969640	to understand how to play the fucking game.
3969640	3971120	So I'm going to pick that one.
3971120	3972120	Heroes of Mana.
3972120	3973120	On her suggestion.
3973120	3976160	God damn, the Mana games started sucking after Secret of Mana, didn't they?
3976160	3977400	It's very unfortunate.
3977400	3982040	I wish that we had gotten Second Sense 3.
3982040	3984920	You never know in the virtual console, you never know.
3984920	3988160	Loki, your pick for the worst fucking game of 2007.
3988160	3990720	I too had five, actually six if you can.
3990720	3991960	Jeez, I only had one.
3991960	3992960	This is easy.
3992960	3998240	Well, I was thinking, okay, my number one is not Yaris.
3998240	4000520	But anyways.
4000520	4006760	So number six, Off-Road Extreme Special Edition, although I did not play it, but it was horrible.
4006760	4011560	I did play this game, Counterforce, for the Wii, yet another game by Conspiracy Entertainment.
4011560	4015240	In fact, my number three would be anything from Conspiracy Entertainment.
4015240	4019120	Or actually, that'd be number four.
4019120	4024800	Number three, I actually, this was the only, the first and only game I will ever import
4024800	4026600	for the PS3.
4026600	4030520	Wangan Midnight is a fucking joke on the PlayStation 3.
4030520	4033640	It is poor for a PlayStation 2 game.
4033640	4034640	I hated it.
4034640	4036680	It was a waste of $60.
4036680	4040960	Yaris is number two, and the reason it's number two is because it's free.
4040960	4045680	Number one, I paid fucking $50 for it, and it was a ripoff.
4045680	4050880	Transformers The Game, the worst, biggest disappointment of a game this year.
4050880	4052120	How do you fuck that up?
4052120	4054800	But you did.
4054800	4059840	I only had picked one game as the worst game of the year, and I also did not pick Yaris.
4059840	4061800	It was tempting, but it was free.
4061800	4063040	We do have to remember Yaris was free.
4063040	4064040	Yeah, free.
4064040	4065120	If it sucked, it's a big deal.
4065120	4071400	There is a game that I bought because I was excited at the prospects of the game, and
4071400	4077800	the way it was put together and the way it was packaged, it just felt so rushed.
4077800	4079760	It was just a steaming pile of poo.
4079760	4085680	I hated, I mean, there's not a lot of times I go, I really fucking hate this game.
4085680	4091840	I hate Fusion Frenzy 2 so much.
4091840	4094980	That game was awful, awful, awful, awful.
4094980	4098320	That is definitely the worst game of the year, and I can't believe they would, that's highway
4098320	4100520	robbery that they ever tried to charge full price for that game.
4100520	4102200	I forgot.
4102200	4104160	My wallet was raped by that game.
4104160	4112840	I forgot one more honorable mention, I guess, because it is also free.
4112840	4120600	You remember the vision camera from Microsoft, which was that totem ball.
4120600	4121760	Wasn't the vision cam last year?
4121760	4122920	No, it was this year.
4122920	4123920	Was it?
4123920	4124920	Yeah.
4124920	4125920	It was last year.
4125920	4126920	It was last year.
4126920	4127920	Who gives a shit?
4127920	4128920	Totem ball still sucks.
4128920	4133480	It sucked in 2007 as well as 2006, all right.
4133480	4137320	So when you add it all up though, let's see, you get one vote for Fusion Frenzy 2, one
4137320	4141440	vote for Transformers the Game, one vote for Heroes of Mana, one vote for Initial D4, one
4141440	4144560	vote for Call of Duty 4, and four votes for Yaris.
4144560	4151420	So Yaris gets, definitely runs away with the title of the worst game of 2007.
4151420	4153500	How about the best games of 2007?
4153500	4157040	Here it is, the time for us to name our five top games of the year.
4157040	4159080	Do you want to just name all five at once, Jamie?
4159080	4160080	Sure.
4160080	4162080	All right, Jamie, give us your top five and why.
4162080	4166040	Number five is a wind on two, because when I got to play it, it was pretty fun, although
4166040	4168040	I still suck at wind on.
4168040	4172440	So four would be Silent Hill Origins, just what I got to see of it again, because I've
4172440	4174720	had a really busy, crazy year.
4174720	4177520	Three is Super Mario Galaxy, I thought was really cool.
4177520	4182080	Two is Rock Band, because again, super cool, and Radiohead.
4182080	4184560	And one, Portal, duh.
4184560	4185560	So that's it.
4185560	4186560	Enough said, huh?
4186560	4192560	The Portal was just super innovative, and I love anything that messes with physics.
4192560	4198040	I would totally be a physics major if it wasn't for the retarded math.
4198040	4200880	All right.
4200880	4201880	There you go.
4201880	4202880	Loki.
4202880	4203880	Okay, like I said.
4203880	4207080	Now remember, these are the top five games.
4207080	4208920	We can use any criteria we want.
4208920	4209920	Exactly.
4209920	4213060	They're all in order of just how much fun I've had with them.
4213060	4218960	By no means does that mean that they're a great game or that they're impressive to look
4218960	4220480	at or anything like that.
4220480	4223960	It's just how much fun I've had with each one.
4223960	4226360	Number five, Ghost Squad.
4226360	4232400	Seriously, one of the most underrated games, at least for the Wii Zapper that's come out
4232400	4234420	for the Wii this year, it's cheap.
4234420	4236480	It's probably going to get cheaper.
4236480	4241600	And granted, the graphics aren't that great, the game is incredibly short, but I will tell
4241600	4245160	you, I played that game through like six times in a row.
4245160	4249440	The fact that you can unlock like 50 different weapons in the game that makes the games even
4249440	4254640	harder, and I don't know, it was the most fun I had for about four hours.
4254640	4259200	And that's all I've played of it so far, but Ghost Squad, definitely worth picking up on
4259200	4262860	the Wii, if you like gun games.
4262860	4265960	Rock Band, fun.
4265960	4273800	I have to give it props because I bought Guitar Hero 2, and I bought Guitar Hero for the Playstation,
4273800	4278520	I played it like once, and I said fuck this, and put it down, and that's where it gathered
4278520	4279520	dust.
4279520	4284520	Rock Band actually played for a lot more than that, and it's actually pretty fun.
4284520	4287800	Just wish there was an easier way to be able to play online with multiple people, like
4287800	4293880	in a world mode or something like that, but definitely a fun game, and it's actually one
4293880	4297240	of the games I actually look forward to the download content coming out for it, which
4297240	4302480	I can't really say bad about many other games.
4302480	4307120	Let's see here, Bioshock, it was a great game while it lasted.
4307120	4314000	I thought maybe a little bit short, not a whole lot of replayability, but I had fun
4314000	4315000	while playing it.
4315000	4317000	Alright, and that takes us to number one.
4317000	4319040	No, that's number three.
4319040	4320880	I can't count, okay.
4320880	4322360	Number two, Crackdown.
4322360	4327960	The best thing for a futuristic Grand Theft Auto, absolutely fun.
4327960	4332920	The most fun I've had in a demo for a game, ever.
4332920	4338200	Absolutely fun to play online, of course that fizzles away pretty quick, and the game kind
4338200	4339200	of got repetitive.
4339200	4342440	Had some pretty good download content for it, I actually went back to it because I thought
4342440	4347220	my save had gotten corrupted, luckily all that happened was I erased an update once
4347220	4349760	I downloaded that again, it worked just fine.
4349760	4354560	Real fun game to play online, and then of course that takes me to number one, and once
4354560	4362480	again, the game did not have good graphics, the game had really crappy AI, the game is
4362480	4368680	extremely cheesy, but I cannot tell you how many fucking hours I've played this game,
4368680	4374580	just to beat it, just to unlock all the weapons, just to try to get the five achievements that
4374580	4376320	are in it.
4376320	4381960	Earth Defense Force 2017, absolutely the best $20 you'll ever spend, if you find it used
4381960	4385200	you can probably find it for even cheaper than that.
4385200	4390000	D3 really, really, really needs to bring over the simple series over here, because it's
4390000	4396280	absolutely good money, it's the cheesiest, weirdest games you'll ever play, and unfortunately
4396280	4402440	because they're so weird they don't end up coming over here, but I hope that changes.
4402440	4405560	My turn, top five games of the year.
4405560	4408840	I'm not surprised, Earth Defense Force 2017, for you, because you are a guy that's all
4408840	4412020	about fun, and you know, blowing shit up is fun.
4412020	4415920	You can blow up, you can level entire cities, and then they come back to the next level,
4415920	4417720	and you can level them all over again.
4417720	4424240	It's seriously, we've played it for, I don't know how many hours, I have it logged in the
4424240	4427680	game, it's over 70 hours, I know that.
4427680	4435880	My number five game of the year is a game that really transcended that kind of what
4435880	4441800	is a casual game and what is a hardcore game type of thing, and the thing I think that
4441800	4446680	makes this game great is that it's really a game that anybody can get into, and it took
4446680	4452140	this game that had no depth at all, and gave it an amazing amount of depth, and that's
4452140	4458480	Puzzle Quest, was an amazing game that bejeweled and just put little twists on it that made
4458480	4463040	a whole role-playing game out of it, and a more competitive type of game out of it, that
4463040	4466960	made this game a hell of a lot of fun, and I've watched my roommate spend countless hours
4466960	4469680	on Puzzle Quest, he doesn't play anything else but Puzzle Quest.
4469680	4473300	There's certainly a lot of people who may not even be into games otherwise that Puzzle
4473300	4478240	Quest has kind of brought them in, so Puzzle Quest obviously was released on damn near
4478240	4482900	every system this year because there was just that much demand for it, so Puzzle Quest was
4482900	4486760	an amazing game, it was my number five game of the year.
4486760	4490520	My number four game of the year is one of those games that probably most critics aren't
4490520	4498240	even going to put on their top ten, but for me it was so great to finally see a true Japanese
4498240	4502440	role-playing style game on a next-gen console and to see what it could do, and I thought
4502440	4509880	the story in this game was so amazing, yet kind of depressing, and the way that it wove
4509880	4516120	real life in with this fictional scenario was just something really innovative and new,
4516120	4520920	and that's why Eternal Sonata for me was just a different type of gaming experience that
4520920	4526580	I really enjoyed and had to be in my top five for the year, absolutely.
4526580	4531960	Say what you want about it getting stale towards the end or what have you, or how insanely
4531960	4536320	difficult and, or not so much difficult but how redundant some of the battles can get
4536320	4544640	later on, but Eternal Sonata is just an amazing game that I would play more and more.
4544640	4548520	My number three game has been lauded by a lot of people as one of the best games of
4548520	4555400	the year, and you know, it deserves to be here graphically, it's a triumph.
4555400	4561600	The mood this game creates, few games are able to pull off, and it's something I don't
4561600	4566240	usually experience outside of a Silent Hill game, but Bioshock totally scared the hell
4566240	4571680	out of me the first time I played it, because it is a scary fucking game, and it really
4571680	4577360	is kind of like playing a movie, it really is, so Bioshock is just amazing.
4577360	4581760	My number two game of the year is all about fun, and I just, I did not think that this
4581760	4585800	game was going to be so great because my expectations I guess were actually a little bit low because
4585800	4590720	like I said earlier in the show, I was not a big fan of Mario 64 as much as the next
4590720	4596800	guy, but Super Mario Galaxy just blew me away, it is so much fun and is really the type of
4596800	4601240	game that I think the Wii was built for, so Super Mario Galaxy is absolutely my number
4601240	4602240	two game of the year.
4602240	4609360	And that takes me to number one game of the year, I admit it, I do not like to spend as
4609360	4614400	much money as I do on gaming, I spend a lot of money on games, and that is why value is
4614400	4621680	so important to me, and in my opinion, there is no better value out there in gaming right
4621680	4626800	now, period, than the Orange Box, and that is one of the sole reasons why the Orange
4626800	4630840	Box is my game of the year, because you get these great, obviously Half Life is an incredible
4630840	4638520	series of games, Team Fortress 2, a lot of fun, the unique art style of Team Fortress
4638520	4649840	2 really sets it apart from the other games, and of course Portal, when you play Portal
4649840	4654320	you feel like you are starting to play the next great series of games, like something
4654320	4659520	truly original has started with Portal that I think is going to continue, and you have
4659520	4665400	all these in-jokes and the whole the cake is a lie, and not every game, especially its
4665400	4673240	first time out the gate, can create that kind of buzz, so the Orange Box absolutely is the
4673240	4676460	best game that came out in 2007, it is not only the best deal in gaming, but just some
4676460	4681740	of the most solid games you are going to get, and the best 60 bucks you can spend on games,
4681740	4688960	so there it is, my top 5 games of the year, so let us tally it up, we have one vote for
4688960	4697400	Call of Duty 4, one vote for Maximum Tune 3, one vote for Earth Defense Force 2017, two
4697400	4703040	votes for Super Mario Galaxy, but if you combine Portal with Orange Box you get four votes
4703040	4706560	for Portal and Orange Box this year, so I am going to have to say that Orange Box is
4706560	4709480	collectively Orange Launch Radio's game of the year.
4709480	4715560	I did say Half Life 2 earlier for one of my ones that did not make the list, it is part
4715560	4723320	of the game, it is ironic, because I remember when I first heard about this game, the Orange
4723320	4726160	Box, I was like, oh isn't that funny, we are Orange Launch Radio and here is this game
4726160	4730040	the Orange Box, I built a computer called the Orange Box, and what is also funny about
4730040	4733820	it is that I remember saying, I was kind of like, oh these are the, oh I am not really
4733820	4738080	into these kind of games, I don't really like the first person shooters, Portal, it is a
4738080	4742800	shooter, I am not going to like that, Portal makes me enjoy first person shooters, because
4742800	4747140	it is a different, I mean I think even people that don't enjoy first person shooters can
4747140	4749920	enjoy Portal, and that is what makes the game so great.
4749920	4755680	There you have it, the Orange Box, and no we are not changing our name to Orange Box
4755680	4760080	Lounge Radio, that would be no fun at all, but the Orange Box is collectively our game
4760080	4763200	of the year.
4763200	4768800	Which takes us to 2008, what do you guys think, what do you think is going to happen in 2008,
4768800	4774800	any predictions you want to make for 2008, Loki?
4774800	4787860	I don't know, gosh, probably see the DS redesigned again, I don't know, they need to put out
4787860	4793000	some good games for the PS3, or else they are going to be hurting, I know we will see
4793000	4802760	Metal Gear Solid 4 come out, Grand Theft Auto will probably push to fall, bastards, Halo
4802760	4807680	Wars probably coming out towards the end of the year, hopefully Fable 2, hopefully Spore
4807680	4812480	actually makes it out this spring, because I need a good game to run on my new PC, and
4812480	4820720	then I might hear about another portable platform or something like that, maybe they will redesign
4820720	4826340	an online service like Nintendo Mail, Nintendo really needs to do something with their online
4826340	4839680	service, I don't know, you might see a blue and black DS in February, I don't know.
4839680	4846520	Dark Sakura, any predictions you want to make for the year 2008, Duke Nukem, Duke Nukem
4846520	4853240	Forever will fucking come out at some point, and it will be disappointing.
4853240	4860640	I think that Super Smash Brothers Brawl will get pushed again, I keep expecting it.
4860640	4864000	You know what, here is something that is kind of interesting, and I have actually looked
4864000	4870120	at it, I have been kind of following it a little bit, I loved Saints Row, and we still
4870120	4876600	play it every day, it kind of is holding us over until Grand Theft Auto IV, but at the
4876600	4884920	same time, Saints Row 2 is supposed to be coming out, I think this year, or 2008, and
4884920	4889080	it actually looks pretty good, and I'm kind of wondering, I know Grand Theft Auto IV is
4889080	4895440	going to be amazing, but Saints Row 2 can be a really good contender for it, especially
4895440	4903920	if that gets pushed back to October or something for Grand Theft Auto IV, that game might surprise
4903920	4907520	people, I know they're going to plan on doing co-op through the entire story mode, just
4907520	4912560	like Crackdown, which is an excellent idea, and then they're going to tweak the online
4912560	4919700	play a little bit more and stuff like that, but I think it's awesome, I can't wait.
4919700	4925640	Because I'm going to make, in the third or fourth quarter of 2008, Sony will redesign
4925640	4931600	the PlayStation 3 and do an effective relaunch, a reboot of the system, the way maybe they
4931600	4935780	should have done it the first time, and the reboot will include a playable demo of Final
4935780	4941040	Fantasy XIII that's going to blow everybody away, but Metal Gear Solid 4 will not single-handedly
4941040	4945000	save the PlayStation 3, and that's what's going to want to cause them to really cut
4945000	4949080	corners in the cost, and they're going to release the system just as dirt-cheap as possible,
4949080	4953800	to try and get people to buy it.
4953800	4958960	Somebody will challenge Nintendo to the throne of handheld gaming, and it won't be Sony.
4958960	4963120	I think in 2008, I think this year, this is a very just out there prediction, I don't
4963120	4966600	know, I get the feeling Nintendo has such a large share of the marketplace in handheld,
4966600	4972380	I think someone else wants a piece of that besides Sony, but I don't think it's Microsoft.
4972380	4977000	I think someone else, I think someone we don't know about yet, is going to come in and challenge
4977000	4983960	Nintendo for the throne in 2008.
4983960	4990840	You know what, and a lot of folks in the chat room are insinuating it might be Sega, maybe.
4990840	4994640	I don't know, I don't know, I mean their games have not been, but I don't know.
4994640	4997920	Because Sega and Nintendo have been kind of working together, you know, and Sega also
4997920	5000840	have tried handheld and they failed, so I don't know.
5000840	5005120	I don't say no, but I don't think it would be Sega, but I think somebody, I don't think
5005120	5007000	it's going to be someone that's known for gaming.
5007000	5009380	I think it's going to be somebody that's known for electronics.
5009380	5013300	It's going to try and get in here, kind of like what Sony did when they got into the
5013300	5014300	gaming market.
5014300	5017600	I think somebody who is known for electronics now is going to try to challenge Nintendo
5017600	5019800	for the gaming throne, but we'll see.
5019800	5021380	For handheld gaming.
5021380	5026080	I think the Wii colors will come out finally this year, and I think they'll come out just
5026080	5029000	in time for the holiday season, and you're going to get the Wiis in the different colors
5029000	5034540	finally, and I think something will happen to address the storage issues on the Wii.
5034540	5039540	I think, I don't know if the color systems are going to necessarily come with more on-board
5039540	5043640	memory, I have a feeling they will, but it's not going to be a major increase, just a slight
5043640	5044640	one.
5044640	5045640	Like what do they have now, 512 megs?
5045640	5046640	Yeah, 512.
5046640	5051980	I say they up the internal memory to 2 gigs, but there will be a firmware that will improve
5051980	5052980	the SD card support.
5052980	5060020	I can see that because with the price of flash ram, I mean, it's going to, it gets cheaper
5060020	5063580	every day, so I wouldn't see why they wouldn't do that.
5063580	5069100	I can also see on the DS with the on-board storage for downloadable games, virtual console
5069100	5072300	for the DS, so to speak, I guess.
5072300	5078300	I can see something definitely like that, I'm trying to think what else would be, PlayStation
5078300	5085260	redesign, I can see that, might even see a 360 redesign, especially if they get it cooler
5085260	5088420	and stuff.
5088420	5091800	And let's see, I don't want to take this on too much longer with just predictions I'm
5091800	5095540	pulling out of my ass, but just, you know, I think there's a possibility some of these
5095540	5096540	things will happen.
5096540	5102900	I think Nintendo, I think the big Christmas game they're going to reveal, I think Animal
5102900	5107040	Crossing is going to be their big winner game, and I think it is going to be an MMO, and
5107040	5109500	it is going to be a bit MySpace-y.
5109500	5113860	I think there is going to be a social element to it that no other game is really done yet.
5113860	5116540	I think that's going to be their big winner game.
5116540	5121420	But I also think this will be the year that Kid Icarus is finally revived.
5121420	5122420	I don't know.
5122420	5123420	Call it my gut.
5123420	5126220	And Guardian Legend finally comes to Virtual Console and we all collectively orgasm.
5126220	5129220	I can see them coming out with some more peripherals for the system.
5129220	5130220	They've got to.
5130220	5132700	I mean, what, the nunchuck and, you know, classic controller?
5132700	5135880	I mean, come on, you guys, seriously.
5135880	5140420	I want to fucking redesign the damn remote to, or make a gun thing.
5140420	5143780	I'm surprised someone hasn't hacked the remote yet to figure out how to get, you know, key
5143780	5149040	presses from there, because through that one port there to remove, like, the B button back
5149040	5153060	to where Trigger is, like the actual Zapper gun, because apparently that probably could
5153060	5154060	have been done.
5154060	5155740	I don't know.
5155740	5156740	But...
5156740	5160420	And not to leave Microsoft out, I'm going to make a bold prediction for them.
5160420	5164420	I say because this latest update has shown that they can do buffering video and they
5164420	5168740	can do it very well, like if you watch the Inside Xbox stuff, that all works out very
5168740	5169740	well.
5169740	5173900	I think Microsoft is going to make a Web 2.0 move this year and I think you're going to
5173900	5178100	see something YouTubey come to the Xbox 360.
5178100	5181380	And it's going to be the reason to get a camera if you don't already have one.
5181380	5185220	I think something YouTubey is going to happen on Xbox 360 in either the spring or the fall
5185220	5186220	update.
5186220	5189220	So, we'll see.
5189220	5190980	All right.
5190980	5194220	So those are our bold 2008 predictions.
5194220	5198220	And there's one more thing we could not do a show without.
5198220	5201980	It just would not be a show if we did not do the FUs of the week.
5201980	5206980	But this week it's very special because these are the FUs of the year.
5206980	5210220	So these are the things that have pissed us off the most above anything else the entire
5210220	5211220	year.
5211220	5214940	Dark Soccer, I want you to start us off tonight with the FUs of the year.
5214940	5235860	I guess my FU of the year is going to go towards the city of Citrus Heights for the crap they're
5235860	5241420	doing regarding massage therapist business licenses just because that completely interferes
5241420	5246260	with a year's worth of hard work I've put into making my business happen.
5246260	5249260	So fuck you.
5249260	5250260	All right.
5250260	5251900	Loki, your FU of the year.
5251900	5255680	I don't have anything that's like really all consuming for the entire year.
5255680	5260940	But for this week at least, FU at Nvidia and your crappy graphics drivers because for whatever
5260940	5266180	reason whenever I reboot my computer, not only does it not save my settings to what
5266180	5272540	screen resolution I have, if it did for whatever reason actually boot up in my desired resolution,
5272540	5277860	it flashes black and then back to the picture and blacks out again and constantly does that
5277860	5283540	until I change the graphics to a different aspect ratio and then change it back.
5283540	5287380	It's fucking annoying.
5287380	5295260	And my FU of the year goes to bugs because bugs suck, especially flies that fly around
5295260	5298180	in the room when you're trying to do a show.
5298180	5299700	All right.
5299700	5304700	That's going to do it unless there's any last minute things anybody wants to say.
5304700	5305700	Sure.
5305700	5306700	Who knew?
5306700	5307700	All right, Loki.
5307700	5311940	In case you didn't catch that earlier when I was talking about it, No More Heroes has
5311940	5315880	moved up to January or at least the end of January, so it's moved up a week.
5315880	5319500	So hooray, get to play the game even sooner in the United States.
5319500	5323500	Apparently there's a thing going around right now where some of the nunchucks that Nintendo
5323500	5329220	has put out recently, I don't know if it's the coloring or something, but they're becoming
5329220	5331780	discolored like pink.
5331780	5333360	That's kind of funny.
5333360	5336660	So they're less manly.
5336660	5339180	And then I don't know if anyone saw this.
5339180	5343420	Apparently there is a company called PEGA and they're releasing yet another gun peripheral
5343420	5345100	for the Wii.
5345100	5348380	This one, though, is shaped like a shark.
5348380	5351180	It's called the Shark Gun.
5351180	5356740	In fact, they were actually, they had a whole press release for this thing.
5356740	5358220	It was hilarious.
5358220	5365220	They had something, was it, during the gun fighting game, use the Wii remote, nunchuck,
5365220	5370040	and shark gun together, holding the handle of the shark gun and poking the trigger with
5370040	5372060	your forefinger to shoot.
5372060	5378900	We'll bring you a you are there feeling.
5378900	5384060	But it's funny though because they have military guys on the cover shooting guns and stuff,
5384060	5385740	although they're not the shark gun.
5385740	5390260	So it'd be funny if the military had shark guns.
5390260	5391260	All right, that's enough news.
5391260	5392340	It can wait until next week.
5392340	5396660	Next week on Orange Lounge Radio, we're back to our classic format.
5396660	5399260	All three of us will be discussing the latest and greatest in gaming news.
5399260	5403540	Of course, your call's on Skype as always, and who knows who might put us on hold next
5403540	5404540	week.
5404540	5405540	We'll see.
5405540	5406540	Wait, wait, wait.
5406540	5407540	I got one more thing on the Shark Gun.
5407540	5408540	God damn it.
5408540	5409540	Sorry, this is funny.
5409540	5410540	It's one of the features on there.
5410540	5413340	With lively appearance and smooth lines, Shark Gun makes you feel comfortable and gives you
5413340	5418880	a strong sense of shark-like invincible force.
5418880	5419880	That isn't a new name.
5419880	5420880	I don't know what is.
5420880	5425860	Let's get around, go around and get everybody's final thoughts until next year.
5425860	5428700	I'll start off because I was going last for most of the other stuff.
5428700	5433020	So my final thought is I want more penguins.
5433020	5434780	I want a real one to live in the garage.
5434780	5435780	That's what I want.
5435780	5438260	DarkSakara, what's your final thought?
5438260	5440300	I want money.
5440300	5441300	Give me.
5441300	5442300	Money is good.
5442300	5443300	Loki, your final thought?
5443300	5448100	My prediction for 2008, Dusk Cap 4.
5448100	5449580	I have one more actually.
5449580	5450580	Oh, yes.
5450580	5451580	Reject false icons.
5451580	5454900	It's been a while since we've had a good, hearty reject false icons.
5454900	5455900	It's good.
5455900	5462140	All right, for myself, DarkSakara and Loki, everybody please have a happy and very safe
5462140	5464580	New Year's Eve, New Year's Day.
5464580	5468900	Please don't drink and drive because if you do, you're retarded.
5468900	5469900	That's really it.
5469900	5475180	We'll see you guys in 2008 for our sixth year of broadcasting, if you can believe it.
5475180	5478020	We'll be back next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
