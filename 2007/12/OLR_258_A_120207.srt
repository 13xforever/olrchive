00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,440
Today, December 2nd, 2007, the Wii gets DS demo downloads, Sony swaps out their ad agency,

2
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:32,240
and DIVX comes to Xbox in the next update.

3
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,240
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

4
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,240
Radio.

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,600
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

6
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,720
lifestyle.

7
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,900
For those of you out there who have recently turned to independent radio this week in light

8
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,320
of recent events, a warm welcome from all of us here at OLR.

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,640
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me not tonight is the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers,

10
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,000
she is still on vacation, I believe she's coming back to town tonight, we'll see her

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,680
back on the show next week, but meanwhile holding down the old fort is the one and only

12
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,680
Loki.

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
Yes, I'm here.

14
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,680
How you doing?

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,680
Good.

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
Good.

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,000
Playing Phantom Hourglass right up until the last second I see.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes I am.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,440
But we'll get to your gaming week in just a little bit.

20
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,400
We are joined tonight by the lovely Rice Princess filling in tonight.

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,400
Hello.

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,440
So it's not just the Rob and Loki show, because otherwise.

23
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,000
It'd be pretty fucking boring.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,040
It might be pretty fucking boring, you put two nerds together and stuff.

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,360
So we brought in a third nerd.

26
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,360
So hello Rice Princess.

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,380
And then it becomes great, like three nerds makes it better.

28
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,960
I think there was a sitcom, wasn't there, like three nerds, three mics and a pizza place,

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,960
I don't know.

30
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,600
Anyhow, I hate that the cam is down this week and I'll talk more about that later because

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,280
Irene has the greatest nerdy shirt in the world.

32
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,480
And where'd you, is this something you got from Hot Gothic?

33
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
Yeah.

34
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
Okay, it's a Metroid shirt.

35
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,520
It's basically the box art from Metroid.

36
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,520
And what does it say?

37
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,520
Can you defeat the mother brain?

38
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,520
Or no, beat the mother brain.

39
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,520
Beat the mother brain.

40
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,200
But you bought me a shirt too from Hot Topic, right?

41
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,200
I did.

42
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
I'm so excited.

43
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
I love presents.

44
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,200
I'm going to open it.

45
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
I haven't actually opened it yet.

46
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,480
So I'm opening it here live on air.

47
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,040
Really sucks that the cam's down this week.

48
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,720
I know, but it's not gaming related at all.

49
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
It's not.

50
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,720
It's not gaming related at all.

51
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,720
Oh well.

52
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,720
That's okay.

53
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,280
I'll pretend I didn't see the tag.

54
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,280
Yeah.

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,280
You should do that.

56
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
Oh my God.

57
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,280
What is it?

58
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,880
Hey, that's awesome.

59
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,880
It's a Pee Wee Herman shirt.

60
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,880
It's cherry.

61
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,600
No, you should turn it over to the front because that's the back, I'm sure.

62
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Oh, Pee Wee's Playhouse.

63
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Oh, that's awesome.

64
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,920
Yeah, it was me at the back that had Pee Wee on cherry.

65
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,920
You're like, wow.

66
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
Isn't that a Pee Wee?

67
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,920
It's so exciting.

68
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,920
Pee Wee and cherry.

69
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920
It's awesome.

70
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
I love Pee Wee's Playhouse.

71
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,920
I'm glad you do.

72
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,920
It's great.

73
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,560
Because otherwise that'd be a pretty shitty present.

74
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,920
Otherwise it's like, here's a shirt of a show you don't like.

75
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,160
I just thought you needed new clothes, Rob.

76
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
That's great.

77
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,600
I will definitely wear that next week.

78
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,480
Hopefully the cam's back next week.

79
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,880
What happened to the cam, BTW?

80
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,400
I'll talk more about that in a little bit.

81
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Okay.

82
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,520
But let's start it off with how was your gaming week?

83
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,520
Loki wants to start us off tonight.

84
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
How was your gaming week?

85
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,920
I didn't play as much as I thought I would be playing this week, but mainly my week was

86
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,480
filled with Phantom Hourglass, and it's fun.

87
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,760
It's a normal Zelda game.

88
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,840
Don't really know what more you'd want.

89
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,560
Sorry, can I interject here for a minute?

90
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,560
Yeah.

91
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,560
I'm looking at our chat room, which I neglected to introduce.

92
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,560
Sorry, chat.

93
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,560
Chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

94
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
We love the chat room.

95
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
They always crack us up.

96
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,080
And you know how just a little bit ago I was saying, what, three nerds, a mic, and whatever.

97
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,360
DJ Jinai comments, where's the cup?

98
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Get it?

99
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
Yeah.

100
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
All right, anyway.

101
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
Sorry.

102
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
Ew.

103
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Delayed reaction.

104
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
Yeah.

105
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,360
Totally didn't get it.

106
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,440
You were the one that kept asking me all week long, have you seen the two girls, one cup

107
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
thing yet?

108
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,960
I did not ask you.

109
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,480
That's perverted and gross.

110
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,520
Anyway, sorry, Loki.

111
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,520
Anyways.

112
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,160
So yeah, I've been playing Phantom Hourglass and it's fun.

113
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,480
So what else they play?

114
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,200
I tried the Wii version of the Golden Compass because Nellie wanted me to demonstrate the

115
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:21,240
game for her since she's really into Golden Compass and that's who I got the game for

116
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,240
her.

117
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,640
So it's OK.

118
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,400
It's pretty easy.

119
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,280
But I guess it's based off of a video game, obviously.

120
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,480
Your starts off is...

121
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,480
You mean based off a movie?

122
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,480
Well, yeah, it's based off a movie.

123
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,920
Excellent reviews by the one and only Loki.

124
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,800
It's based off of a book, also.

125
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,680
And you play a giant fucking polar bear that, you know, abuses wolves, apparently.

126
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,420
Because it's like, I kind of feel bad for the wolves because they're attacking you and

127
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,360
you're just like this giant fucking polar bear with armor on it.

128
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,480
It's like, as if, you know, a wolf versus a polar bear was going to win in the first

129
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
place.

130
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,080
This bear is fucking tricked out with armor.

131
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,760
There's no fucking way it's going to win.

132
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,080
OK, but like, look at Final Fantasy XI, where like, you could fight a bunny and the bunny

133
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,000
rapes you for 500 points of damage.

134
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,320
I mean, it's...

135
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,840
Sometimes video games don't make sense.

136
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,840
Well, I haven't fought any bunnies yet, but as far as the wolves go, I kick the crap out

137
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,400
of them over and over and over again.

138
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,480
I don't know, you make the Golden Compass sound pretty awesome when you talk about polar

139
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,960
bears and sets of armor.

140
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
Well, apparently...

141
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,960
Oh, wait, you don't even know.

142
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,280
I haven't read the book or seen the movie yet, but apparently the characters in this

143
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,560
story have their souls outside of their body as an animal, and the animal like, talks in

144
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,220
the same voice as the girl in the game.

145
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,120
So it's confusing, because it sounds like the girl's having conversations with herself,

146
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,440
and it's like, you know, one will say, yeah, let's do that again, and the girl's like,

147
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,440
I don't want to do that again.

148
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,440
It's like, what the fuck?

149
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,440
Make up your mind.

150
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,840
Maybe she really is talking to herself, and she's crazy.

151
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,480
No, she has this like, panther cat thing on the back.

152
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,680
It looks like a house cat, but apparently it's like a panther or something like that,

153
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,400
and then it can transform into a sloth too, so I don't know, it's some crazy shit.

154
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,900
But I will not be playing any more of that game.

155
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,760
I did play Super Mario Galaxy, though, because I was sick this week.

156
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,760
What did you think of it?

157
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,040
Well, I'm still playing it, and it's fun.

158
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:16,080
It's very, very, very much like Mario 64, I mean, same kind of setup, just, you know,

159
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,080
no red coins.

160
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:29,160
Other than that, I don't know, that's pretty much it, I think, from Saints Row, and yeah.

161
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,680
What's so funny about Saints Row?

162
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,280
No, just like, you're playing Saints Row.

163
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,400
Oh, and Earth Defense Force 2017.

164
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Of course.

165
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Still playing some of that.

166
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Of course.

167
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,040
We went and tried to beat the second to last level on Inferno, and that's like getting

168
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,720
raped by thousands of ants at the same time.

169
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
It's not very fun.

170
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
Nice.

171
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,640
Let's see, my gaming week, I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff, unfortunately, I've

172
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,640
just been very busy.

173
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,400
I've been watching my roommate play a hell of a lot of puzzle quests, though, on Xbox

174
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,480
Live Arcade, which is kind of funny, because he doesn't get into a lot of video games,

175
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,120
but when he does, he definitely puts, he's committed.

176
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,640
So he's been very committed to puzzle quests, he's already at like level 20, he's gotten

177
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,400
way further in the game than I have.

178
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
That's crazy.

179
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:15,760
Yeah, so he's enjoying that, and other than that, I've just been playing the regular World

180
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,840
of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XI, you know, because I just love my MMOs.

181
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,840
Ew.

182
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,840
I know.

183
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,800
I've been playing Rock Band, I went online with Rock Band this week, and I gotta say,

184
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,040
I'm just pissed off that you can't do band co-op mode, I mean, what the hell, why did

185
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,040
they leave that out?

186
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,640
Because you can do band competitive, well, it's not even really competitive, but you

187
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,640
can do like the one song stuff online, like one song at a time, but you can't do the World

188
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,560
Tour mode online, which seems kind of stupid, because it's not like the game's unable to

189
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,580
let four people play online at once.

190
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,560
That was kind of, like, one of the reasons I was excited about Rock Band is I kind of

191
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,880
thought you were going to be able to make these bands together with people from far

192
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
away.

193
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,680
Shane, who hasn't been on the show in a long time because he lives in Kansas, also bought

194
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,360
the game, and I was thinking, oh, we could have a band, and we'd play together, it'd

195
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
be fun.

196
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,240
But we do have a band already.

197
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:13,160
A Rock Band, not a real band, where, you know, I play Kazoo, and Irene plays the tambourine.

198
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,800
You know, a Rock Band band.

199
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
Anyhow.

200
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Good times.

201
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,960
So I was just pissed that co-op mode was kind of missing in that regard.

202
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,440
Otherwise, they did have a David Bowie pack come out this week, and that was pretty awesome.

203
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
Oh, really?

204
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,560
Because David Bowie is very awesome.

205
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
He is.

206
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
Yes.

207
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
There's like a cover of Heroes.

208
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
It's good.

209
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,560
Good times.

210
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
Nice.

211
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,560
That's really it.

212
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,560
Not a lot else to note.

213
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
Not a lot of new games this week.

214
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,000
Oh, I did play Undertow, but I don't know, just not my kind of game.

215
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I wasn't feeling it.

216
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,160
I tried to, it was hard to, I mean, it wasn't hard to figure it out or figure the game out,

217
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,240
but I thought the tutorial could have been a little better, because there was so many

218
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
different little features.

219
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,740
I forgot to mention it last week, and it hasn't really been on any of the websites yet, but

220
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:02,000
they released the Pay the Unlock content for Katamari.

221
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
We love Katamari.

222
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,700
Or, not we love Katamari, beautiful Katamari.

223
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,120
And so I bought that, and then afterwards, I'm like, why did I buy that?

224
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,200
That's a good question.

225
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Why did you buy that?

226
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
It was an impulse buy.

227
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:21,440
I bought one of those $20 cards, 1600 point cards, well I didn't buy it per se, I got

228
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:29,680
crap that I didn't want, and I traded it for a free card, so I can thank a PS3 copy of

229
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:36,920
Assassin's Creed that bought me Rock Band songs and beautiful Katamari download content.

230
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,720
Sephiroth1215 in our chatroom says Rock Band World Tour wouldn't work online.

231
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
Why not?

232
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
I don't get it.

233
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
It should.

234
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,200
I mean, yeah, I see Black Lab talking about the vocals in the game, how you don't actually

235
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:54,960
hear the people singing, although you kind of do, but you can have a full band in the

236
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,960
play one song at a time mode co-op, I don't know what it is, just quick play or whatever

237
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:04,200
it's called, and you can have a guitar, and I actually signed on Xbox Live and got a random

238
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,480
band thrown together where some guy was on vocals, I was on guitar, somebody else was

239
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,880
on bass, and somebody else was on drums, and we could hear the vocalist singing, it was

240
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,800
just a little bit faint and very, very lagged because it was transmitting through his headset

241
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,240
or whatever while he was singing.

242
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,000
Oh, I fucking hate that shit.

243
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,960
Yeah, but the game itself doesn't support that.

244
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,360
It plays the normal backtrack because of the lag.

245
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,360
Hey, that'd be kind of cool if you didn't do the vocal parts without people hearing

246
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,360
you.

247
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
I like that idea.

248
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,120
Yeah, if you just turn your headset off, you can do it without people hearing you.

249
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,400
They don't hear you.

250
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,760
Loki has a secret desire to sing a little more often, doesn't he?

251
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,760
No, I don't.

252
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,760
I really don't.

253
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,760
All right.

254
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,600
I have a secret desire to get achievement points, and...

255
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
All right.

256
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,080
Rice Princess, have you been playing anything this week at all?

257
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,080
Just WoW, really.

258
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
WoW!

259
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
How's WoW been going for you?

260
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,080
It's been going excellent.

261
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:03,600
I was going to deactivate my account, but for some reason I just decided not to, and

262
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,240
then I leveled up like five levels this past week, so...

263
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,560
Wait, WoW's been going great, so you were going to deactivate your account?

264
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,160
No, it was being really boring, and I was like, I'm just using it as a glorified chat

265
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,240
room, and then I was going to deactivate it.

266
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,280
Then I just started leveling, and I was like, wait a minute, I like WoW again.

267
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,280
What's going on?

268
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,920
No, this is kind of fun again.

269
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,160
Yeah, this is weird.

270
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,240
Yeah, because, I don't know, WoW's been kind of boring for the past couple months, but

271
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,240
now it's not.

272
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,800
It's because our guild's too small.

273
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,800
It's kind of sad.

274
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
We have no tanks.

275
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
We can't run instances together.

276
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
We have no tanks.

277
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,840
That's kind of what I think brought me back to playing is that, I don't know, some people

278
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,800
were running me through instances, and I ran people through instances, and we have a guild

279
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,880
bank now, and I'm totally into that.

280
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,880
Guild banks are awesome.

281
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,880
I don't know.

282
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,520
It just became fun again.

283
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
Well, good.

284
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
Yeah.

285
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
All right.

286
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,680
All right, well, let's get into some housekeeping tonight, and then we'll get into the gaming

287
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,680
news.

288
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,760
Obviously, Dark Sakura is not here tonight, but she will be back next week.

289
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,180
Perhaps we'll hear from her later in the show, but I think she's recovering from her trip.

290
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,560
Our webcam, I said I'd say more about this later, Operator 11 is the service that we

291
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,360
use to deliver the webcam feeds of our show, and they're down this week.

292
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,000
They randomly went offline midweek, and then they've come back up with a placeholder page

293
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,920
saying they're down.

294
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,520
So that kind of sucks, but at the same time, you can't really complain because, A, they

295
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,600
were in alpha, so it was an early thing, and B, it's free.

296
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,720
It was very hard to complain about something that's free when it breaks, so we're trying

297
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,160
not to be bitchy.

298
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,520
But if it's not up next week, we probably will look into alternatives for what we can

299
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,560
do to do the cam and everything, because the only bummer about that is that after last

300
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,160
week's show, we finally did the great Zapper challenge.

301
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,520
We had Loki on the regular Wiimote, and I used the Zapper, and we played Link's crossbow

302
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,720
training, and the funny thing that happened is that in the practice round that we played,

303
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,520
I fucking wasted Loki.

304
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,320
My score was 10 times his score.

305
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,320
It was crazy.

306
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,560
I just obliterated him, but it was a practice round.

307
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,440
And then when we did it for reals, Loki beat me by a thousand points.

308
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,440
I was so mad.

309
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,720
So Loki won the great Zapper challenge, proving that the Zapper does nothing to enhance the

310
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
gameplay.

311
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,680
And honestly, you playing the Zapper, it was crap, wasn't it?

312
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,400
It wasn't that great.

313
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,940
I can't say the experience was any better with the Zapper, but the crossbow training

314
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,880
game was kind of fun, actually.

315
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,060
To be devil's advocate and a little bit fair here, from what I hear, Ghost Squad, it's

316
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,060
really good.

317
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,080
And the reason why is because they have a good calibration system on it, where you aim

318
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,600
down the Zapper at one corner of the screen, aim down the Zapper at the other corner of

319
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,360
the screen, and then spot on after that.

320
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,520
So I don't know why every game for the Wii doesn't have something like that in the first

321
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,520
place.

322
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
Really shouldn't have.

323
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:54,320
I mean, that should be fucking a default thing to have in there, I mean, come on.

324
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,340
But yeah, so if they add something like that to all the games, it'll be good.

325
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,200
That's one good thing that Ghost Squad has going for it, and hopefully they'll have the

326
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,520
same thing, I assume they'll have the same thing in House of the Dead 2 and 3.

327
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:14,440
So I mean, the whole thing is only, what, 25 bucks for the Zapper and crossbow training?

328
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,720
Technically $20, but GameStop is ripping everyone off by $5, they're overcharging over retail

329
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
for it.

330
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,200
So the Wii mode itself and Link's crossbow training is only 20 bucks?

331
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,760
Well yeah, the Wii Zapper and the Link's crossbow training is only $20 retail.

332
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,400
That's not bad, all things considered.

333
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,440
That really isn't a bad deal.

334
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,640
I mean, granted, the game is probably worth a little more money than, and the game is

335
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,000
short, I mean, it's something you're going to beat pretty quickly, but I think it's,

336
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,280
you know, it's a Wii Sports-ish kind of thing where the game doesn't have a lot of depth,

337
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,240
but you're going to have a lot of people that want to just kind of pick it up and play it

338
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,240
and have fun with it.

339
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,800
Because it's not like the game was that difficult to figure out.

340
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,600
So I thought it was kind of fun.

341
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,100
But that sucks that Loki won the bet.

342
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,640
So no date for me and Loki gets, is the wife going to let me take her out or what?

343
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
I don't know.

344
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
I'm going to have to talk about that this week.

345
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
I think that happened.

346
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,640
So you can have your night of peace.

347
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,640
Yeah.

348
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:09,960
Anyways, I was going to say for next week, because I have a whole bunch of games on,

349
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,560
you know, I guess a queue to play.

350
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,720
A bunch of import stuff.

351
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,080
Dragon Quest Swords for the Wii, Harvest Moon for the Wii, why the fuck am I going to play

352
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,080
Harvest Moon?

353
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,800
I fucking hate Harvest Moon, but I'm going to try it anyways on the Wii for the hell

354
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,160
of it.

355
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,200
Devil Kings 2 for the Wii, which I hear is really fucking good.

356
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,440
I'm going to try that out.

357
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,320
And then DDR Haas Party for the Wii, the Japanese version, because they have a few different

358
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,600
songs that I want to try out.

359
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,520
And I'm going to do the All Controller Controller Revolution, because it does support the classic

360
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,920
controller to do that, which I didn't know.

361
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:54,000
I was like, oh, okay, I'll do it that way, because I don't want to buy a dance bet.

362
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,260
And then, I'm trying to think of what else I had, Cruis'n, probably one of the worst

363
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:05,160
racing games out there, by, you know, screenshots at least, so I'm going to play it to see how

364
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,280
crappy it is.

365
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,280
Then another game that I know is going to be even worse, which is Off-Road Extreme Special

366
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,040
Edition is what it's called, and it's another piece of shit that's coming out there.

367
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,040
I'll play them so you don't have to.

368
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,440
Hey, you know what though?

369
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
Crappy games can be good.

370
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,200
In fact, I saw today they have the box shots for the Simple Series 3 and 4 coming out for

371
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,200
the Wii in Japan.

372
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,840
Simple Series 1, I'm also going to be playing Meet-a-Dick Kart Race, another kart racing

373
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,840
game.

374
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,200
So, lots of stuff for next week.

375
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,640
When do we get the WiiWare?

376
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,640
Is that ever going to come out?

377
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,640
I thought that was supposed to come out this year.

378
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,640
I know, I know.

379
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,720
Oh, and when I get paid this week, I'm going to import Wii Fit.

380
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,080
Interesting.

381
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,360
And I'm going to use Wii Fit.

382
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,240
You must really want to get Wii Fit.

383
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,680
I do want to get Wii Fit.

384
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,880
Wow, I hope it works for you.

385
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,880
I would be very curious to see how Wii Fit works for you.

386
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,600
We should make a diary of your progress and all that fun stuff.

387
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,000
I think that would be a good idea.

388
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,600
Alright, we'll have to get on that.

389
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Alright, let's see.

390
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,800
Looking in the chat room, DJ Jenai, talking about the Wii, says, I noticed that Nintendo

391
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,840
released a game on Virtual Console that Compile made, so maybe it's possible for Nintendo

392
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,080
to release the Guardian Legend.

393
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,960
God, I only hope so.

394
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,080
Those who have been listening to Orange and Andreo for any length of time know that we

395
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,840
have a very soft spot in our hearts for the 8-bit classic, the Guardian Legend, so the

396
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:23,720
day that comes out on the Wii, I'm calling in sick to work.

397
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
Let's see.

398
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,600
Odd1 says, the damn system will tell you six ways from Sunday.

399
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,280
Don't kill people with your Wii mode and go out once in a while, you fat fuck, on every

400
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,800
game, but they don't think to help us calibrate the things to play the game better.

401
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,200
And I love that new warnings grant they have, that thing looks like a fucking condom on

402
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,200
there.

403
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
I'm sorry.

404
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,200
It is the ugliest.

405
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,200
With the Wii condom.

406
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
It is the ugliest thing.

407
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
You know what?

408
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,400
I'm playing fucking dangerously, okay?

409
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,300
I don't use the wrist strap, and even if I did, I have the original wrist strap.

410
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,040
No fucking condom on it, man.

411
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,720
I'm living dangerously.

412
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,400
You're playing your Wii promiscuously.

413
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
You bad boy.

414
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,720
It's all skin against skin with my Wii there.

415
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
Nice.

416
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,720
Wow.

417
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,520
Oh, Dillinger's been playing a game I really want to play.

418
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
Trauma Center New Blood.

419
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,400
I need to go out and get that game.

420
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Yes you do.

421
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Trauma Center.

422
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
I can take it from you and play it.

423
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
No.

424
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
Yes.

425
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
My game.

426
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
You can't take my game.

427
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,400
Yeah, I can.

428
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,400
Do you want to borrow something else on Wii?

429
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Sure.

430
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
Like Metroid or something?

431
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
I don't know.

432
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
No.

433
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
Not fucking Metroid.

434
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
What?

435
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
You sure it says Metroid on it.

436
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
It says old school Metroid, damn it.

437
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,080
I don't want to play no damn 3D Metroid, that blasphemous piece of crap.

438
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,760
I mean, Metroid's great.

439
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,240
AZHP says Trauma Center New Blood is the best game ever.

440
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,240
Shut up.

441
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,240
Interesting.

442
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
I mean, it's okay that you said that, but I want to play it.

443
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,240
I guess that's it for housekeeping.

444
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,080
I don't have a lot else to add, so let's get into some, oh, actually one quick thing is

445
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,600
that there's like a 90% chance next week, I know I've been saying this for a while now,

446
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,240
but we'll finally be out in the actual studio for those keeping track.

447
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,240
We've been in our temporary studio, quote unquote, for like the past three months, but

448
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,400
I'm hoping next week, just due to some things that are going around in the personal life,

449
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,000
we're going to try and get out there next week.

450
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,080
I'm very excited about it, which is why I really want the cam to come back.

451
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:22,040
So if Op11's not back next week, we're probably going to look into either Justin.tv or Ustream.

452
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:27,160
I really haven't thought about what else is a good service, because I kind of liked how

453
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,040
Op11 had the episodic stuff.

454
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,640
But anyhow, let's get into gaming news.

455
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
Loki.

456
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,120
Anyways, the thing that everybody's been talking about this week is a certain GameStop editor

457
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,800
was rumored to have been fired for a negative review over Kane and Lynch.

458
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:51,320
Anyways, the person responsible for this, I can't remember his name, they just have

459
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,920
his last name up here, anyways, and I don't even know how to pronounce that, Gershwin,

460
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,920
I guess?

461
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,880
I want to see if it's like a, anyways, Jeff Gershwin, yes.

462
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:08,400
Anyways, so the rumor is, because no one's coming out to say otherwise, the rumor is

463
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,900
this is because of his negative review on Kane and Lynch, Eidos threatened to pull the

464
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:19,920
ad support, because they have the whole fucking site skinned like Kane and Lynch, and because

465
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:27,440
of that, since the ads pay their salaries, basically, rather than lose them as a ad supporter,

466
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,880
they fired him instead.

467
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,920
And everybody is just up in arms, because now people have finally figured out, hey,

468
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:45,560
guess what, maybe ad contributions from publishers and stuff affect scores of games.

469
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,560
Really?

470
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,560
You think?

471
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,560
Hmm?

472
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,560
You're kidding.

473
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,440
Wow, welcome to the real world, folks.

474
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:57,120
Anyways, so yeah, tons of stuff, in fact, I think there were some other people that

475
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,080
also got fired too, at least there's one other person I know that got fired and I think other

476
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:06,160
people are talking about leaving, but yeah, it's a big mess right now.

477
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:15,840
Hmm, okay, you know, can I be honest, this guy is, okay, I'll lie, I've totally known

478
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,520
about this guy and followed his career for a long, long time, is that a good lie?

479
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,520
No.

480
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,680
Okay, here's the truth, I had no idea who the hell this guy was until I read this article

481
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,680
on the internet, apparently he's been some respected game journalist for the past ten

482
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:34,160
years, but honestly, I don't read a lot of corporate sites, so I don't, there's a lot

483
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,200
of independent blogs I read and maybe some of them are somewhat corporate because I read

484
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,920
Joystiq, they're AOL, Kotaku, whatever, but I don't really read a lot of the big box sites

485
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,920
very often.

486
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,720
I used to read one up maybe like three years ago, I don't really read them a lot anymore

487
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,600
either, so I had no idea who the hell this guy was.

488
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,200
Nevertheless, I can't help but think, so I'm trying to look at this as objectively as possible

489
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,840
because I can't help but think, and this may not be the popular opinion, but I actually

490
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,060
think there's a bit of mob mentality going on here.

491
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:09,200
I think the gaming scene is jumping to a lot of conclusions with this stuff, when there's

492
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,800
a lot of people that really can't talk about what's going on in this situation, and I think

493
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,680
there's been quite a bit of jumping to conclusions and things that have probably gotten blown

494
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
out of proportions.

495
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
Oh yeah.

496
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,360
And the interesting thing about it, I mean honestly, these companies involved are kind

497
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:29,440
of screwed because of it, and it's kind of alarming, I think if anything, from this what

498
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:36,960
we're learning is that the video game scene can be very sensationalist sometimes, in some

499
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
regards.

500
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,960
This isn't the first time this stuff's happened.

501
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,960
Not really, no.

502
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:46,160
I mean, first off, people give him crap anyways because he had that, you know, non-ten review

503
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,600
on Twilight Princess.

504
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,920
Listen, if I were to review Twilight Princess, it wouldn't fucking get a ten, okay?

505
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,700
Seriously, that game is not God's gift to fucking gaming, seriously, it's just a fucking

506
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,960
Zelda game, just like Phantom Hourglass is a fucking Zelda game, they're good, but they're

507
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,860
never great, okay?

508
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,860
So whatever.

509
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,000
I digress, but whatever, that's- Anyways.

510
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Everybody's allowed to have their own opinion, that's fine.

511
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,240
I'm just saying, you know, everybody was fucking, like, giving Zelda a fucking blowjob or some

512
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,160
shit like that, it is goddamn just a game.

513
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,160
Anyways.

514
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,480
I don't know, it kind of deserved at least a handjob, I mean it was a really good game.

515
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,860
Oh absolutely, yeah.

516
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,720
It was not that great of a game, seriously.

517
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,080
Wind Waker is a better game.

518
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,960
Whoa, that's crossing the line.

519
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,520
Oh wow, yeah, no, you did not just go there.

520
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
Ouch.

521
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
Alright, back on topic.

522
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,520
Anyways.

523
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,880
I mean, does anyone remember Driver 3?

524
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,720
How the whole story came out that people were, that Atari was paying for good reviews on

525
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,720
that game?

526
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,880
I mean, this isn't the first time, this isn't the last time this is going to happen, I'm

527
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:48,680
sure it's happened hundreds of times between those, so I'm not surprised, it's just people

528
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,640
are finally figuring it out, that this is going on behind the scenes.

529
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,480
And to be honest, people don't really know why this guy was let go.

530
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,540
I mean, think about it, just hypothetically, the company, and again, I don't know shit

531
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,240
about what's going on in this situation, I'm not going to pretend like I know what's going

532
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,480
on in this situation, I just know what I'm reading out there on the internet, what people

533
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:13,260
were saying, and hypothetically, in the corporate world, they could have fired this guy because

534
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,960
he was late to work too many times.

535
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,960
Yep.

536
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
Who knows?

537
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,280
Okay, does it confirm that he was fired?

538
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,280
He did not quit?

539
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,280
He was laid off?

540
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,120
Well, he was basically locked out of his office.

541
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:30,900
But again, that's all talk, but you feel like there is some validity to that, because obviously

542
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,520
employees of the company are stepping forward anonymously and saying these things, so he

543
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,520
was fired.

544
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,520
Okay.

545
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,440
He'd been at the company for like 10 years.

546
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,620
But anyhow, I've seen people in the corporate world work at a company for like 10, 15 years

547
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:49,080
and get fired over a really bad thing or whatever goes on, so who knows?

548
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,720
This guy could have been like late to work for an entire month or something.

549
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,000
Again, I'm being very hypothetical.

550
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,760
And the company could fire him, but the company can't say why they fired him.

551
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,920
And if he gets fired over something like that, is he going to say, oh yeah, they fired me

552
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,620
because I was late to work too many times?

553
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,880
Or is he going to let people draw their own conclusions?

554
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,200
He probably also can't, well, I'm not even really saying that, I think he can't actually

555
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,520
say why he was fired.

556
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,300
I think he has to sign something when he's leaving.

557
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,080
This is why, you know, you're not allowed to say that.

558
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,400
Okay, so he has to sign something or what?

559
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,200
It's probably actually something he signed when he was, in confidentiality agreements

560
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,840
he signed when he started with the company, not when he was leaving.

561
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,400
Oh, sign this, you can't tell anyone why you're fired if we fire you.

562
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,040
Well, I don't know.

563
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,920
I think he can say why he's fired, he probably just didn't want to yet.

564
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,200
I don't know.

565
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,000
Well, I don't think he would purposefully do that because then they could, I don't know.

566
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,600
It's not really slander, I guess, but...

567
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:56,280
I'm pretty sure this is going on, I mean, it's just, sure it could be all these things,

568
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,280
but it just smells a little fishy to me.

569
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,500
The gut side of me says, I mean, where there's smoke there's fire, right?

570
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,360
The gut side of me tells me there is some validity to this, and I think one theory I

571
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:11,040
read somewhere that makes a lot of sense is that they wanted to change wording in the

572
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,440
review to make it more accurate as to whatever would the change were between the Xbox 360

573
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:22,880
and PlayStation 3 were, and he didn't want to do that, and he got let go for being somewhat

574
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,640
of a difficult person on this and other issues in the past, and that, you know, because the

575
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,880
wording got changed, the internet changed that into, you know, the great game of internet

576
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:37,920
telephone, that got changed into, oh my gosh, he refused to change the article to give it

577
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,360
a good score, so Eidos made them fire him.

578
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,440
Okay, so why didn't they just not publish the review?

579
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,400
Why didn't they just, like, say, hey, okay, well, this is not in line with what we're

580
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,520
looking for, we're not going to publish it, I mean, I know he could just as easily go

581
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,800
to his own personal blog and post it or whatever, but that's his own personal blog, they don't

582
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,800
have jurisdiction on it.

583
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,200
Well, the thing is, though, is they use a lot of these reviews as advertising for their

584
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
game as well.

585
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,960
I mean, that's why you see them boxes, you know, games where I gave it a five out of

586
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,920
five or ten out of ten or whatever, you know, they use that shit in the fucking commercials,

587
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:17,560
they use it in, you know, their press advertisements and all that stuff, it's a big deal for them

588
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:23,560
if, you know, they're paying, you know, GameSpot, you know, like, say, a million dollars for,

589
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,680
like, advertising or something like that, and then all of a sudden, they get a shitty

590
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,800
ass review out of it and it causes people not to buy the game, what's going to incentivize

591
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,160
them to give them more money when they can give it to some other site that's going to

592
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,560
give it a more favorable review?

593
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:42,560
Yeah, but if they don't publish it from that particular journalist, can't they just get

594
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,240
one of their other journalists to publish a positive review?

595
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,040
Yeah, but then it's going to come out that this guy had wrote a review on it and then

596
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:53,400
all of a sudden, oh, wait a second, there's, you know, they didn't print it because this

597
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,460
one's more favorable.

598
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,480
It would come out one way or another.

599
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,840
I just think that's a little far to be going, like, oh, we're going to fire you because

600
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,840
you gave a bad review.

601
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,360
And also, because they have deadlines, you know, when these reviews need to get out there,

602
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,200
and they may not have time to, you know, it takes time to play through the game and be

603
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,520
able to review it correctly.

604
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,800
Granted, there are also rumors of people just writing reviews without playing the game.

605
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,640
That happens too.

606
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,840
Odd1 has a very interesting, and obviously our chat room is lit up with this, chat.orangehouseradio.com.

607
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,500
Odd1 says, but seriously, who here was really looking forward to Kane and Lynch?

608
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,480
Where the fuck was the hype for that recently?

609
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
We're kind of swamped.

610
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,720
I doubt even GameSpot's words could make it a million seller.

611
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,600
Let's see, what else do we have here?

612
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,520
Raven's Dolphin says, I heard he got fired of the video review.

613
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,480
Well, maybe, but again, this is all hearsay.

614
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,400
GZDr4ev says, people canceled their GameSpot accounts, yet people are leaving the site

615
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,440
en masse over this whole thing, but again, I partially blame mob mentality for why that's

616
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,160
happening because people don't really know what's going on yet, but people are making

617
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,780
up stories that sure seem to make a lot of sense.

618
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,720
Frisbee says, but if the game sucks, then the players will get the truth out there.

619
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,720
Absolutely.

620
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,920
Which I think just goes to show the lesson learned here.

621
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:15,560
If you are getting all your gaming news and reviews from one person on one corporate gaming

622
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:20,400
site, you might need to take off the blinders.

623
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,560
If you're looking for accurate reviews on stuff, don't rely on one website.

624
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,520
You can go to websites like Metacritic.

625
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:33,600
They've got a compilation of scores from all sorts of sites and stuff, and that'll give

626
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,640
you a good baseline of what the game is, and also you can read review and see what it is.

627
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,640
Wait a minute.

628
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,840
Did Metacritic pay you money for that low-key, for that endorsement?

629
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,800
I just happened to use that site because it compiles reviews.

630
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
Anyways.

631
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,800
Fired!

632
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,240
I don't get paid for shit, okay?

633
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Seriously.

634
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,680
Yeah, you're right about that.

635
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,920
The truth be told now, because at work we sell Kane & Lynch and stuff, and Kane & Lynch

636
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:08,000
is one of those titles that was kind of a, what we call select style, it's a title we

637
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
push because we're getting paid money to push the title a little bit.

638
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,520
The thing is though, Eidos set our goal so high it was impossible to hit anyways so that

639
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,720
it wouldn't have to pay out any money to us, because we had people that make these deals

640
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,200
are fucking retarded or something.

641
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,960
But yeah, they have a lot of, I mean, Eidos is really pushing to make this game big.

642
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,720
I mean, doing it in little ways I probably wouldn't, you know, they're advertising, marketing

643
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,920
people, little creative ways like, you know, teaming up with Playboy, for example, to do

644
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,640
that model search.

645
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:47,460
They had interviews with the fake characters in the game in Playboy.

646
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,040
They did reach out to the independent media.

647
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,400
They flew a bunch of them out there to San Francisco to go.

648
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,440
We weren't invited, and we could just drive there, but that's okay.

649
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,440
We're not bitter.

650
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,440
Oh yeah, sure.

651
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,240
You know, because we drive there, you know, that's why they don't invite us to this stuff.

652
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,240
Bastards.

653
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,240
Anyways, you know.

654
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:10,520
But I also think there's definitely a certain type of audience I think this show caters

655
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,520
to.

656
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,000
I mean, granted, I think we have people from all walks of gaming that listen to this program,

657
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,560
but I think people know that we are mostly the one you want to hear for the music, the

658
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
RPGs.

659
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,920
There's a certain niche that Kane & Lynch doesn't fit into, I think.

660
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,760
Listen, I'm not saying Kane & Lynch is a bad game.

661
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,240
It probably could have been a good game, but this...

662
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,240
I've never played it.

663
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,240
I don't know.

664
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,800
I haven't played it either, but you know, just from whatever I've been reading and the

665
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:39,360
way it looks, to me, this game's kind of fallen into the same problem that, you know, Black

666
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:45,000
Sight Area 51 and some of these other games have gotten in their rush to make it out for

667
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Christmas.

668
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,920
And this year, I think also next year, you're going to see a lot of these games that are

669
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,560
going to be spread out throughout the year instead of all in November, and that might

670
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:58,840
help some of these games, you know, because like Army of Two, for example, that one was

671
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,480
going to be released in November as well along with Kane & Lynch and all this other stuff,

672
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,520
but it wasn't done yet.

673
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,880
And so instead of releasing it, they're putting more time into polishing it and making sure

674
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,760
that it's a good game before they release it, and so now it's coming out later on.

675
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,080
It missed, you know, the holiday thing, but it's going to be a better game.

676
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,440
Same with like, you know, Grand Theft Auto IV, Metal Gear Solid IV, you know, stuff like

677
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,440
that.

678
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,280
Take the extra time and make the game good, and then that way you will get a better score

679
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:33,920
for it instead of rushing this piece of shit out and then having to be broken.

680
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,840
Here's the other thing that kind of makes me think there's more than meets the eye with

681
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,000
this whole thing.

682
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,120
Is a 6 out of 10 a bad review?

683
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,160
I mean, I realize the way the scale has been kind of skewed over the years by many people,

684
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:50,700
I guess yes, but I always thought a 5 was average, like right in the middle you're average,

685
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:56,520
so a 5 is average, so technically a score of 6 is a slightly above average game.

686
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,520
Right?

687
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,520
True.

688
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,680
And it wouldn't be that bad if it were in a month that was, you know, a bit slower with

689
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,800
games, but this is November where you have, you know, 60 billion releases coming out,

690
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:11,040
and a 6 game may not be played by as many people as, say, but here's what you need to

691
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,040
do though.

692
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,200
I'm not sure if the game's going to be good, I'm also just trying to take a jab at the

693
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,760
fact that most games in this day and age are rated on a scale of 5 to 10, not a scale of

694
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,760
1 to 10.

695
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,760
7 to 10.

696
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:26,520
No, but seriously though, if you're unsure the games can be good, rent it.

697
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:32,320
I mean, rent it from Gamefly, rent it from your local Blockbuster, Hollywood, whoever,

698
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,240
you know, rent it and see if it's any good.

699
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:40,680
Shadowslier wants to give insight on that, he says, on the GameSpot scale a 6.0 is fair.

700
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:46,040
Okay, but fair is not a bad word, it's not a good word either, it's just a fair word.

701
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,720
There really is no better description for that.

702
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,120
See, I don't even really like scale-based reviews in the first place, because then you

703
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,320
just put all your trust, you're like having them make the decision for you.

704
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,280
Like Loki said, just rent the game if you're so unsure about it.

705
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,080
I mean, if it catches your eye in the first place, read the review, then go rent it, but

706
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,440
if not, then I wouldn't even worry about it.

707
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,200
Like, numbers are nothing.

708
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:14,720
There are games that most of the critics out there on the internet have given fair scores

709
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,160
to, such as I think Eternal Sonata was a game that got mostly sevens and stuff.

710
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,160
I freaking love that game, that game was incredible.

711
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,480
This is only one person's opinion on it.

712
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,640
You're basing your entire, whether you're going to play this game or not, on one person's

713
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,640
opinion.

714
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:34,120
I mean, God, it's not like this was reviewed by a panel of scientists or something like

715
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:38,240
that, where they had thousands of people playing this game and this is the score they came

716
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,240
up with.

717
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,880
It's one dude, whether he likes the game or not, he may just hate Eidos or something,

718
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,120
they may have rubbed them the wrong way before, and now he's embittered and now it's a six

719
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,880
or something because they fucking pissed him off.

720
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,200
Or like, you know, if I reviewed Madden or something like that, I don't like fucking

721
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,440
football games, one, or something like that.

722
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,800
I mean, that's the kind of, you're supposed to be unbiased when you're playing this stuff,

723
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,000
but you know, it's, what, I'm actually kind of curious, what do you think about the fact

724
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,280
that, you know, after all this, the competitors down the street at 1UP did this little protest

725
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,200
or something on their lunch, this whole, like, kind of, you know, having the signs Free Jeff

726
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,680
and whatever all that stuff was.

727
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,680
What do you think of that?

728
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,960
Because I certainly have an opinion on it.

729
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,040
Fucking attention whores is what that is.

730
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,360
This is bullshit.

731
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,360
Interesting.

732
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:27,480
The same fucking shit's going on over at 1UP where most of the, you know, most of the internet

733
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,040
would say the exact, what a great sign of support these guys are doing on their lunch

734
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,040
break.

735
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,360
This isn't going to support shit.

736
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,680
All they're doing is just fucking, you know, oh, let's do this because, okay, if they were

737
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,200
doing it genuinely and, you know, it was to support them, they wouldn't have put it in

738
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,400
their fucking Flickr and then posted that shit everywhere.

739
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,400
This is, you know, it's just like those fucking tobacco companies, oh, we donated a million

740
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,840
dollars to this charity, praise us for doing some good.

741
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,840
Fuck that.

742
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,840
Interesting.

743
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,800
You know, other people, if they noticed it or something like that and posted it in their

744
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,880
fucking Flickr blogs, then it would be good, but the fact that they're, like, promoting

745
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,360
themselves, look at what we did, we're so awesome.

746
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,360
No, fuck that.

747
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,360
I'm not, wow.

748
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,280
Oh, we're going to get some angry e-mails this week.

749
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,720
Mailbag at orangehonstroyer.com.

750
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,720
Here's the thing is that I don't know what the motivation is, whatever, I'm not going

751
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,640
to pretend to know, but I do think it was a little premature because, again, I find

752
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,500
that a little strange that they would jump in on that mob mentality when none of us truly

753
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,400
know what's going on.

754
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,960
And they have waited until more news came out when, I mean, these guys do represent

755
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,080
a corporation, so that's my only, like, I don't know if that was smart type of thing.

756
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,680
Wait, so it was a bunch of employees from one up, like, during their lunch break.

757
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,200
I think that there's reviewers and critics over there.

758
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,200
Yeah.

759
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,200
Yeah, Ziff Davis or whatever.

760
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,200
During their lunch break?

761
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Oh, yeah, something like that.

762
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,280
I mean, you can't control what somebody, that's right, they can do whatever the hell they

763
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,280
want.

764
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,600
But here's the thing, though, and I, what were they, you know, protesting that they

765
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:58,520
support independent reviews or unbiased reviews or something like that, so what they're basically

766
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,780
saying is that they support that so that one up has unbiased reviews.

767
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,080
That's the impression that you're supposed to get from that.

768
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,800
It's just fucking advertising for themselves is all it is.

769
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,800
I'm sorry, I don't see it as very genuine at all.

770
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,040
All I see that is is, hey, some manager came up with an idea to have them go out during

771
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,040
their lunch break and fucking protest in front of them.

772
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,080
No, I don't believe this shit, that they're such a tight-knit group or whatever, that

773
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,600
they would do that kind of crap.

774
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,800
But hold on, hold on, hold on, the few times we have been to these media events and things

775
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,600
like that, it's always the same fucking people, so I think in some regard they are somewhat

776
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
of a family.

777
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,240
Okay, okay, let's say that they're a tight-knit group, okay, if I fucking got fired, say that

778
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,440
we were corporate or whatever, and I got fired because, you know, I wrote a bad review on

779
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,120
Kane and Lynch, would fucking one up be on my lawn protesting for that shit?

780
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:53,080
No, they would be there twiddling their thumbs in their office going, ah, those fuckers that

781
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,080
like DDR serves them right.

782
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,940
I mean, seriously, that's the shit that would happen.

783
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:02,000
This is not fucking, you know, advertising or anything like that.

784
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,480
It's just, it, I'm sorry, I saw that, I'm like, oh, come on, seriously.

785
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,480
And then I read it on every single blog, I got the same thing, oh, good one up, go them.

786
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,400
I'm like, fuck that shit, I'm going there less now because of this.

787
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,280
I'm going there less now, 25% less because of that, like.

788
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,760
Yeah, let's see their, I bet you that fucking protest shit's in their goddamn EGM, too.

789
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:30,480
How much you want to bet that shit is, oh, they're so, so independent and awesome that,

790
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,480
you know, and unbiased.

791
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,480
Let's put it in our magazine, too.

792
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,480
Look how holy we are.

793
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,880
You know, I just realized I have Tuesday off work.

794
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,000
Maybe I should go down there with a sign that says, thank you for firing him.

795
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,260
Orange Lounge Radio.

796
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,920
Those fuckers who like DDR.

797
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,920
Just to see what happens.

798
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,920
No, I'm kidding.

799
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,920
I have better things to do on Tuesday.

800
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,920
No, you don't.

801
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,920
Go down there.

802
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,920
No, I'm going to see the Spice Girls.

803
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,920
What are you talking about?

804
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
You said you had better things to do.

805
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,080
I have much better things to do on Tuesday.

806
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,080
Whatever.

807
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,760
Okay, let's just, you know, okay, the fact of the matter is, okay, we don't know why

808
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,760
he was fired.

809
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,120
We assume it's because of this.

810
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,320
Yeah, this is going on in the industry, big whoop, you know, other things going on in

811
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,320
the industry, too.

812
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:12,960
Like, I don't know, certain media outlets getting to break street on certain news stories

813
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,800
and stuff like that or no such embargo for them because, you know, they make a lot of

814
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,440
money in advertising and that kind of thing.

815
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,920
Yeah, that kind of stuff happens as well.

816
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,480
There's a whole lot of shit you don't see that happens behind the scene, you know, day

817
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,580
to day but, you know, we all deal with it and guess what, things aren't going to change

818
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,280
so get over it.

819
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,040
And really, in a month, who's going to be fucking talking about this?

820
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,040
Who's going to give a shit?

821
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,040
Nobody.

822
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,680
If you want genuine reviews, ask someone that's actually played a damn game.

823
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
Your friends.

824
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
Irene, I don't know.

825
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,840
I do think there is going to be some type of long lasting effect this whole thing has

826
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,880
because I think people are going to, I think companies are going to watch what happens

827
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,760
to the whole rah, rah, rah, my mentality, we hate you, GameSpot type thing that goes

828
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:58,300
on and I think there's going to be a lot of, you're going to see, I think the big sites

829
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,960
post about their integrity, like I think you're going to see the competitors like OneUp and

830
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,280
IGM make things about their integrity in their reviews and their corporate policies.

831
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:13,720
Well, wait a minute, let's revert back to an old situation that concerned, you know,

832
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:18,840
mishandling or mistreatment of employees at a gaming establishment.

833
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,760
Like look at, what was it, the EA spouse?

834
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,040
How long did we talk about that?

835
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,680
You know, the EA spouse that was like, oh, my husband's working too long or whatever

836
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,480
lasted about a month.

837
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,760
Yeah, they've raised issues of like, you know, oh, you know, look at them, they're evil and

838
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,800
blah, blah, blah, blah, but people still go and work for them.

839
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,280
People still buy their games.

840
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,320
No one's really like EA did not go under as a company, like no one gives a shit anymore.

841
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,760
Like did they put a hit on her?

842
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,160
I mean, I don't know because nobody talks about it anymore.

843
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,160
How the fuck do I know?

844
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,160
No, I think I remember seeing it.

845
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,160
I know I'm just teasing obviously.

846
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,000
I think I remember seeing a story like a year ago, like she was unmasked and we found out

847
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,240
who she really was and all this stuff.

848
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,600
Also writing reviews and then the companies can start paying me because I need money.

849
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:07,640
No, but seriously, though, I mean, if I had the free time, I'd write reviews, but I don't

850
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,640
have the fucking free time.

851
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,840
I have to work and then have a wife that I want to go home and a cat that wants me to

852
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,840
play with it.

853
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,960
So, you know, I have to do these things.

854
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,960
I can't write reviews.

855
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,200
Do you want me to put a hit out on your cat?

856
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,200
Maybe my wife, but.

857
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,200
Are you like?

858
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,200
Wow.

859
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
Wow.

860
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,200
That was mean.

861
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
Dang.

862
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,200
Oh, snap.

863
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,200
Is that Freudian?

864
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,200
Was that intentional?

865
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,120
I'm using opinions expressed on this program.

866
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,840
Let's see.

867
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,200
The chat room has been lining up and I've been ignoring them.

868
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,200
Sorry, guys.

869
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,560
Odd One says, I don't know, did I already read this one?

870
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,880
I think, I don't think I did.

871
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,400
I think the developers give the gaming press more credit than they're worth, especially

872
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,760
in the face of the internet.

873
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,760
The word gets out.

874
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,760
We have our ears to the ground.

875
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,960
Yes, you can get exclusive news from the corporate sites, but the message boards, podcasts and

876
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,580
indie sites are where it's at.

877
00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:00,120
If Eidos was stupid enough to push this, seriously, I'd love to see them burn.

878
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:04,520
I have a feeling actually, I have kind of a strange feeling, Eidos has nothing to do

879
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,520
with this.

880
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,440
I think maybe they were like, they were probably a little pissed and they probably let GameSpot

881
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,320
know that, but you know, they also probably kind of realized that there wasn't a lot they

882
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,320
could do about it.

883
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,320
So, I don't know.

884
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,400
I have a feeling if anybody's probably getting a bad rap over this, actually probably them.

885
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
I don't know.

886
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,400
It's just kind of one of my gut tells me about this whole mom mentality thing.

887
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,600
Yeah, I don't think they had much to do with it.

888
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,600
I don't think they can directly say, fire this person.

889
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:30,720
I mean, if it was EA maybe, you know, maybe, but I mean, we're talking Eidos here, what,

890
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,240
Tomb Raider, Hitman.

891
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,240
That's it.

892
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,240
I mean, seriously.

893
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:39,520
Gerardimo says, dear world, go get your own opinion and decide if the game is good or

894
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,020
not yourself.

895
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:44,880
Mac Man says, I like the idea from All Games Interactive, sound effect reviews.

896
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,000
Okay, this game is audience laughter out of Mario Jump.

897
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,360
That's brilliant.

898
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,520
Let's see.

899
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,480
Tiger Claw in response to the 1UP protest says, maybe it's a sign that 1UP would like

900
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,880
Gertzmann to work for them.

901
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,880
Who knows?

902
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,480
Odd1 says, Ziff is all about the publicity.

903
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,840
They're good with Flickr and all that shit.

904
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,320
I'm not surprised they videotape almost everything they do.

905
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,360
Let's see.

906
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:15,600
Yeah, I don't see Eidos pressuring them to fire this guy.

907
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,560
I mean, EA or something, like if they gave Madden like a really shitty score or something

908
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,800
like that, because they're a big company and have a lot of money to throw around, but...

909
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:29,680
Eidos, I mean, what, would they have come out recently, Tomb Raider Anniversary Edition?

910
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,680
I mean...

911
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,240
All right, well, we've spent a lot of time talking about this topic.

912
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:37,600
We want to move on to some other news, but I'm sure we'll hear a lot about this on the

913
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:42,560
Skype line later, and of course, there always is our mailbag at orangeonsradio.com.

914
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,240
Meanwhile, more news, and let's talk about the Virtual Console on the Wii.

915
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,480
We'll start off with some Wii news tonight.

916
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,600
This is great news.

917
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:55,960
This makes me think Nintendo finally gets it, what we really want, in a way.

918
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:01,120
Pokemon Snap is coming out on the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan, and usually this would be

919
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:07,280
no big deal, however, the pictures that you take inside the game, you can now post to

920
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,040
your Wii message board and send around on the address book.

921
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,040
So if you've taken a picture of Pikachu doing a little dance or something, and you think

922
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:20,240
it's really cute, I could send that over to the Wii that Rice Princess has and make her

923
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,240
look at it.

924
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,240
No, you won't.

925
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,240
I just might.

926
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,240
I'll just delete it.

927
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,840
I'll befriend you, if that's possible.

928
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:30,760
Now, I think a lot of us have been shouting for the mountaintops for years, well, at least

929
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,320
years, since the Wii came out.

930
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:38,420
We want to see additional functionality in the Virtual Console games, like online play

931
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,740
and things like this.

932
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:43,520
So the fact that they've done this for Pokemon Snap shows that it's possible, right?

933
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,400
Why did they have to do it with Pokemon Snap?

934
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,320
God damn it, why couldn't they pick a better game to do it with?

935
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,000
Like nobody gives a shit about taking pictures of stupid Pokemon.

936
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,960
Hey, I love Pokemon Snap, shut up.

937
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,600
Yeah, well, it's stupid, and you're stupid.

938
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:07,160
Anyways, Odd1 says, message board posts of Pokemon in near sexual positions up 500%.

939
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,400
Pokemon Snap has now become Pokemon Slash.

940
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,480
Good job, everybody.

941
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,880
Of course they're making a lot of money off of Pokemon Snap and other Virtual Console

942
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,880
titles.

943
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,900
Nintendo estimates that they've made $33 million on the Virtual Console alone, and that kind

944
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:27,960
of includes 7.8 million downloads across the service.

945
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,960
Wow.

946
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,440
Lots of money.

947
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,360
And it's free money, essentially.

948
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,440
I can't imagine the Virtual Console takes that much work.

949
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,440
All that bandwidth.

950
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:42,000
Well, it's not just that, but obviously they kind of have rewritten all the manuals in

951
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,320
the Wii, because the Wii thing has their own manuals and stuff, and I'm sure they still

952
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,760
have to do QA on all the games and what have you.

953
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,360
So it's not like they do it completely free, but it's certainly much cheaper than making

954
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,360
a new game.

955
00:45:53,360 --> 00:46:00,640
So this is probably very high cost efficiency type thing, cost gains, whatever they call

956
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,640
that in the business world.

957
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:04,360
Remember, they sell each one of those consoles at a profit.

958
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:11,160
All right, well, speaking of the Virtual Console, some more titles coming out have been spoiled

959
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,560
by the one and only ESRB, so you can expect in the near future, Top Hunter for the Neo

960
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:21,040
Geo, Puyo Puyo 2 for the Genesis, King of Fighters 94 on the Neo Geo, Baseball Stars

961
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:25,720
2, Bases Loaded on the NES, that game was pretty awesome, actually, the Dynastic Hero

962
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,160
on the Turbografx-16, and Power Golf on the Neo Geo as well.

963
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,160
Wow.

964
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,120
All must be making their way sometime in the near future.

965
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,380
Also just wanted to say really quickly that it's also been spoiled that on the Japanese

966
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:42,560
Virtual Console, they'll be getting Treasure Hunter G, which is a game I vaguely remember.

967
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,400
Why aren't they releasing better titles?

968
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,400
I don't understand.

969
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,360
Well, Treasure Hunter G was actually a pretty awesome RPG 16-bit.

970
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,040
It kind of reminiscent of Final Fantasy VI a little bit.

971
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,400
That's pretty cool, but I mean, the other games, like fucking Power Golf, who the hell

972
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,400
played that?

973
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,200
Bases Loaded, whatever, that's an okay game, I guess.

974
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,680
Bases Loaded was kind of cool, but Baseball Stars was better on the NES.

975
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:07,680
I like that game.

976
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,880
I didn't play any baseball games on the NES, because I don't care about sports games.

977
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,880
You know what's weird?

978
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,940
Usually I'm not into sports games either, but I liked, here's the thing, I liked sports

979
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:19,680
games a lot when they were simple.

980
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,560
That's why I loved NBA Jam so much.

981
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:26,160
I mean, that game was relatively, I mean that game was kind of made for, you know, dummies

982
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,920
who can't really play basketball, but enjoy to watch it, you know?

983
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,440
That's why I liked NBA Jam.

984
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:40,200
Anyhow, anyways, in Japan, the Everybody's Nintendo Wii Channel has been launched, and

985
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:44,000
of course, for those who may not know, it's a brand new channel that offers all sorts

986
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,480
of things, including release dates, promotional videos, and DS demos that you can stream to

987
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,200
your DS.

988
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:56,880
So that's actually pretty cool, and it will allow you to view commercials, gameplay footage,

989
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:03,480
they'll have interviews about various Nintendo products, box art, release schedules for the

990
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,600
DS and the Wii, and other fun stuff.

991
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:11,040
And hopefully soon, demos for Wii games as well.

992
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,920
But right now they've got some different touch generation title demos, and of course the

993
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,640
Japanese versions of Pokemon Diamond and Pearl.

994
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,160
Now this seems like a very natural thing that Nintendo probably should have had a while

995
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,160
ago.

996
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,960
Do you have a word on when we might get this in the US at all?

997
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,120
Fuck if I know, but this is something they were promising, what, before the Wii ever

998
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,120
came out?

999
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,120
Mm-hmm.

1000
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:35,640
Well, I don't know if they were ever necessarily promising it, but I think a lot of people

1001
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:41,460
kind of inferred that, hey, the DS has Wi-Fi in it, hey, so does your Wii, hmm, could the

1002
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,300
Wii interface with the DS later?

1003
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,040
And then, you know, you saw games like the Pokemon Stadium or whatever that game was.

1004
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,400
What ever happened to my new content every fucking day?

1005
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,080
Wii Connect 24, come on.

1006
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,920
Well, you get new weather reports every day, don't you?

1007
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,920
Granted you might be looking-

1008
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,760
No, because I have Wii Connect 24 turned off.

1009
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,640
You're looking at your Wii at 5 o'clock at night, and you see the weather from midnight

1010
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,640
that morning, but-

1011
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,840
Wii Connect 24 doesn't like my mod chip.

1012
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,840
Wow-s.

1013
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:10,040
All right, let's see.

1014
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:15,400
Mac Man says, everybody's Nintendo channel in America, now Nintendo, kill the chibi motherfucking

1015
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,280
robo team and get to work on it.

1016
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,040
That's an order from Mac Man in chat.

1017
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,320
Yeah, stop making chibi robo games, they suck.

1018
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,200
That's right, just knock it off.

1019
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,400
We're not saying fire those guys, just put them to work elsewhere.

1020
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,920
I'm saying fire those guys.

1021
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,960
Anyhow, you might have heard earlier in the show I mentioned that I was a fan of the game

1022
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,000
Eternal Sonata that came out a little earlier this year.

1023
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,760
Trycrescendo was the folks that made, Crescendo made this game, and they're now working on

1024
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:50,040
a new game called Fragile, and it's a new RPG that's going to be coming out for the

1025
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,520
Nintendo Wii, which is a system that Eternal Sonata was not on.

1026
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,000
It's on 360 and going to be coming out on PS3, but Fragile is going to be coming out

1027
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,740
on the Nintendo Wii.

1028
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:05,360
All we know so far is that the main character is a guy named Set, and you explore various

1029
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,360
cities.

1030
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,800
It takes place in a post-apocalyptic world.

1031
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:18,640
Most of the details at this time are in Japanese, but there is an official website up at fragile.namco-ch.net.

1032
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,800
There's also a little teaser trailer out there on the internet for the game, and I'm sure

1033
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,400
a lot of people are kind of excited about this because, you know, obviously the first

1034
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,760
generation of Wii games felt like ported PlayStation 2 games with motion control, so these type

1035
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,760
of game announcements get people excited for what the Wii can really do.

1036
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:39,680
Cool, and that reminds me, there's another game that's going to be coming out here,

1037
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:46,240
Opuna, that came out in Japan, I believe, and it's coming out over here in like February,

1038
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,760
I want to say, I'm going to check out the Japanese version next week, hopefully, too.

1039
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,880
Although I don't really know how much I'm going to be able to play out of those games,

1040
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,360
especially role-playing games, because they're all in Japanese, and I speak no Japanese,

1041
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,920
or at least very little Japanese.

1042
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:05,160
Anyways, the Nintendo DS in the UK has set some new sales records.

1043
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:13,880
They have sold 191,000 units in the UK, and that's more than any other hardware format

1044
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:21,480
has achieved in a seven-day period, so that's a pretty good week for them, I guess.

1045
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:27,280
The previous record was held by the PSP during its launch in September of 05, where it sold

1046
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,280
185,000 units.

1047
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:36,080
Alrighty, how about we start looking at some release dates, travel the world, and look

1048
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:41,120
at games that you can pick up in the UK right now if you think another game should be selling

1049
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,120
a lot of units.

1050
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:46,200
But first, before we get into release dates, one thing we promised a few weeks ago on the

1051
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:52,600
show is that we would be tracking sales numbers, because we have ways of getting the MPD sales

1052
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:58,320
numbers, and obviously, one game you guys want to know the sales on is Eye of Judgment,

1053
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,960
and that's because of the bet.

1054
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:04,220
If you recall, a bet was made on this program that Eye of Judgment, as Loki said, would

1055
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:08,080
no way in hell sell a million copies within six months of release.

1056
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:14,040
In fact, if the game manages to sell one million copies in six months within its release, Loki

1057
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:19,560
has said he will dress up in a tingle outfit and dance around in the garage, setting an

1058
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:27,480
Eye of Judgment on fire while playing a game versus Bobby Blackwolf, all on video for YouTube

1059
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,160
for years to come.

1060
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:33,160
However, we have to get the game to sell a million units first, and we have an update

1061
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,160
on the numbers.

1062
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,360
Loki, how many units are we there?

1063
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,360
Are we there yet?

1064
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:42,880
At least in the US, we're up to 17,600 units.

1065
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,760
But I will have you know, though, that's just from launch to December 3rd.

1066
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,120
I haven't gotten the new numbers yet.

1067
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,920
Hopefully, in the next couple of weeks, I'll have new numbers for us.

1068
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,800
So that's about within the first three weeks of release?

1069
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,800
Like two or three, yeah.

1070
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:56,800
All right.

1071
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,880
So we're 1.7% of the way there.

1072
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,320
Yay!

1073
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,320
Making good progress.

1074
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,660
Keep at it, guys.

1075
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:06,800
Good luck to you.

1076
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,520
I'm looking at the chat room to see what's going on.

1077
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,440
Dark Tetsuya says, that's it?

1078
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,600
Sorry, folks.

1079
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:20,720
I wish I had better news for you, but that's it so far.

1080
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,280
All right.

1081
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,240
Anyhow, let's look at the release dates.

1082
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,400
We'll start off in Europe since the last story was about Europe, and coming out on the seventh

1083
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:34,400
in Europe, Alvin and the Chipmunks, the movie game tie-in on the DS, PC, and Wii.

1084
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,780
Game movie tie-ins, Beowulf comes out on the PSP, also Brother in Arms, Road to Hill 30

1085
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:45,720
comes out on the Wii, Disgaea makes its way to the PSP, Dragon Blade Wrath of Fire comes

1086
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:51,920
out on the Wii, Juiced 2 on the PC, hey, hey, Link's Crossbow Training comes out on the

1087
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,280
Nintendo Wii, Myst comes out on the DS.

1088
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,560
I forgot that they were remaking the old Myst games on DS.

1089
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,560
That's what this is, right?

1090
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,560
That's pretty rad.

1091
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:03,880
Is that out here in the US?

1092
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,760
I don't think on the DS, but I know it's on the PSP.

1093
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,840
Pokemon Battle Revolution finally comes out on the Wii, over in Europe this week, Pro

1094
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:17,200
Evo Soccer 2008 on the DS, also this week on the seventh, Sing Star PlayStation 3 finally

1095
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:22,920
this week on the seventh, SOCOM on the PSP, Soldier of Fortune Payback on the 360 on the

1096
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:28,960
PC, Sonic Rivals 2 on the PSP, couple ports of the Golden Compass on PBS and PC, Tomb

1097
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,080
Raider Anniversary makes its way to the Wii, and Ultimate Mortal Kombat on the DS, and

1098
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:37,360
PlayStation 3 isn't left out, Uncharted, Drake's Fortune comes out.

1099
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:41,080
And if you're looking for something a little more casual, something mom can get into, Who

1100
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:44,240
Wants to Be a Millionaire comes out on the Wii this week.

1101
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,000
No word yet if Meredith Vieira stars or not.

1102
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Okay.

1103
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,720
In the US, we have Alvin and the Chipmunks.

1104
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,280
Actually she wouldn't, because those are the Europe release dates, and they have a different

1105
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,200
host over there, so I look stupid.

1106
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:02,740
In the US, Alvin and the Chipmunks coming out on PC, DS, PlayStation 2, and I believe

1107
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:05,520
the Wii.

1108
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:11,720
American Girl, Julie Finds Away, with I must say the most creepy cover for a game I have

1109
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,320
ever seen, this crazy chick.

1110
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,320
What the hell?

1111
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,320
I don't know.

1112
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,080
She's just kind of creepy looking.

1113
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,540
Wait, what the hell game is this?

1114
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:26,200
American Girl, Julie Finds Away, finds a way to pull the Doom Switch is the way it looks

1115
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,400
like here.

1116
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:34,520
It looks like Julie, like, you know how blind people use that white cane?

1117
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,760
That's kind of what it looks like to me.

1118
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,600
She looks like she's like rowing a gondola or something.

1119
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,720
Can you post that in chat so you can see that?

1120
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,800
She finds a way to make some money rowing a gondola.

1121
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,200
What is the game about?

1122
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,200
I don't know.

1123
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,200
I don't know.

1124
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,760
Who gives a shit?

1125
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,360
For those listening on the archive, seriously, look up this game in the box art, it's kind

1126
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,360
of scary.

1127
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:01,640
Anyways, the Golden Compass is coming out this week as well and that's on Playstation

1128
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:08,840
2, Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PSP, probably did DS as well.

1129
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:16,480
Let's see, Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3 on the Wii, it's coming out as well.

1130
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,760
Draglade on the DS, which is supposed to be a pretty good game, I think that's sort of

1131
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,440
a music game too, actually.

1132
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:30,480
A small little game here called Dance Dance Revolution Universe 2, the bundle only is

1133
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,120
coming out this week.

1134
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,080
Universe at War, Earth Assault.

1135
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,520
When does the game itself come out?

1136
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,520
Do we know?

1137
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,520
January.

1138
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,640
You want to hear something even weirder?

1139
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:47,280
DDR Caught as a Party, the game only version, it's not coming out until April now.

1140
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:53,000
What the fuck, I mean seriously, the game is out right now in a bundle, but for some

1141
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,960
reason cannot release the game by itself until April.

1142
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:56,960
Nope.

1143
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,920
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

1144
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,420
Anyways, Yu-Gi-Oh!

1145
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:11,800
World Championship 2008 on the DS, let's see here, I know this week is pretty light, Left

1146
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,280
Behind Eternal Forces expansion pack is coming out this week.

1147
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,920
Godzilla Unleashed on the Wii, which I'm sure is wonderful.

1148
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:29,000
Strawberry Shortcake, the Four Seasons cake on the DS.

1149
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:35,120
Jenga on the Wii, absolutely the best idea for a game ever.

1150
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,440
Jenga?

1151
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,540
It's $30, folks, that's actually more than the actual game cost.

1152
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:45,920
What I want to know is are you still supposed to chant Jenga, Jenga, while someone's removing

1153
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,920
the block?

1154
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,080
Because you know you're supposed to do that in the regular game?

1155
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,080
Is that what it says in the rules?

1156
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,080
I don't know.

1157
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:57,240
It's something my friend told me when I was a kid, so it probably was made up, just to

1158
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,240
make me look stupid.

1159
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:03,480
Everyone's like, what the hell are you talking about, Rob, we don't do that.

1160
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,200
I believe that would be made up, Rob.

1161
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,720
Anyways, that's it.

1162
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:15,440
Then let's go over to Japan, where they get some games before we do, and one of the biggies

1163
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:19,920
is Lost Odyssey, making its way to the Xbox 360 on December 6th.

1164
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:26,280
Also on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, Conan, as well as Virtua Fighter 5, which I know

1165
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,600
is one that people are looking forward to.

1166
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,880
A game that people are probably not looking forward to so much, Viva Pinata Party Animals,

1167
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:38,760
or as they call it, Atsumare, Viva Pinata, Let's Party, coming out on the Xbox 360.

1168
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,260
On the PlayStation 3, Conan as well.

1169
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:45,720
Also Pirates of the Caribbean, At World's End comes out on December 6th.

1170
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:50,720
Also Uncharted, Drake's Fortune, and a brand new USB headset, if you're into that.

1171
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:55,760
Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii, we have No More Heroes coming out on the 6th, as well

1172
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:01,120
as Rayman Raving Rabbids 2, or Rabbids Party Returns, is what the localized version is.

1173
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,280
Okay, did they really need to make a sequel to that shitty-ass game?

1174
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,960
Oh my god, that game was awful.

1175
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,640
Actually, I hear the second one is pretty good.

1176
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,640
It's pretty fun.

1177
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:09,640
It's probably not bad.

1178
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,680
Because they've taken over Earth.

1179
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,160
Namco's putting out a game called, or I'm sorry, Bandai, well, it's the same thing.

1180
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:20,760
Mina de Asubo de Namco Carnival comes out on the Wii, which I'm sure is just probably

1181
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:26,300
a collection of past games, or it might be, I don't know, this might be some type of like

1182
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,460
Mario Party game, but starring the Namco characters.

1183
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:36,880
I think that's actually the, what was it, the Namco collection that came out over here.

1184
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,240
Oh, okay, with the upgraded games and stuff?

1185
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,240
Yeah.

1186
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,240
That makes sense.

1187
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:49,400
Also coming out on the Wii from Sega, Doraemon Wii, Himitsu Dougo Ketai Sen is coming out.

1188
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:54,640
Also, wait for it, Disney Princess Enchanted Journey this week on the Wii.

1189
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,640
Yay!

1190
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,640
Yay!

1191
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:01,000
Also another Tamagotchi game, Tamagotchi no Furi Furi Kaje Kaiden comes out as well.

1192
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,720
I hope I want to play No More Heroes, that looks fun.

1193
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:07,240
On the PlayStation 2, lots of stuff as well, another version of Pirates of the Caribbean

1194
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,640
at World's End.

1195
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:13,280
Another Mahjong game, hurray, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories finally comes out on

1196
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,480
the PlayStation 2, and another version of Disney Princess Enchanted Journey, as well

1197
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,720
as a game called Finalist.

1198
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,240
I think that's just a price reduction, though, it was already a game out there from Princess

1199
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:28,200
Soft, one of our favorite Japanese companies.

1200
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,200
Princess Soft?

1201
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,560
They put out a lot of games.

1202
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:36,040
Also on the Nintendo DS this week in Japan, Arkanoid DS, that's the one that comes with

1203
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:40,000
a little paddle that goes in the Game Boy band slot, that's kind of neat.

1204
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:46,600
Also coming out, we have Doko Demo Raku Raku DS Kaibou comes out, I don't know if that's

1205
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:52,940
a price reduction or what that is, but this is the thing though, you always kind of worry

1206
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:57,160
because they advertise on the box how cheap it is.

1207
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,160
So that's always...

1208
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,920
Very cheapo game!

1209
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:07,520
So K1 World GP comes out on the DS, and you want me to try to pronounce this one?

1210
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,760
This one's going to be kind of fun, here it is.

1211
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:21,240
Maru Kaitei Dondon Obaru Kyui no Sugawa Shiki Kanji Kyoku Jutsu Kaiso Gaku Shu-hen.

1212
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:24,000
It's a language learning program, which apparently I need.

1213
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,040
Yeah, you really do.

1214
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:32,920
I can special order this game from Japan, said it probably won't help me because it's

1215
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:38,200
probably for Japanese people to learn other languages, so I'll be screwed.

1216
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:44,900
Also on the DS, Tales of Innocence comes out, that's a Namco game, and wow, pretty big week

1217
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,740
in Japan I must say.

1218
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:50,320
But I guess they don't have the big shopping day like we do here, so they get games right

1219
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,280
up until Christmas.

1220
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:57,080
Coming out on PSP, another version of Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, also Silent

1221
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:01,320
Hill Zero comes out, which was Silent Hill Origins here.

1222
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:08,320
Minano Golf Portable 2, that's just hotshots golf, comes out over there as well, and that's

1223
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,320
it.

1224
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,320
Awesome.

1225
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:20,480
Anyways, so this is actually pretty recent news, Activision and VinVidi have merged into

1226
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:25,880
one super company, Activision you'll know of course behind the such wonderful series

1227
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:32,560
as Call of Duty, Tony Hawk, and the lesser known Cabela's, and VinVidi of course behind

1228
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:39,440
such wonderful games as Spyro, Scarface, oh and a small little game called World of Warcraft,

1229
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,720
or they own Blizzard, which is behind World of Warcraft.

1230
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:50,080
Of course, this whole merger, you know, it's gonna be pretty good I'd say for both companies,

1231
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,240
but you know, millions of dollars here, actually billions of dollars.

1232
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,240
Bad for the gamers.

1233
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,240
No, I'm just kidding.

1234
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,240
I have no idea.

1235
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,240
18 billion dollar deal.

1236
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,240
Woo!

1237
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,240
That's a lot of money.

1238
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,240
That's a lot of money.

1239
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,000
So, I don't know.

1240
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,640
But the new company is called Activision Blizzard, yes?

1241
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:06,640
Yes.

1242
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,640
That's a little lame.

1243
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:08,640
I don't like the name.

1244
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:13,720
So is it gonna be like, Activision Blizzcon, is it gonna be like...

1245
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:18,240
I think you will see little things like that probably happen.

1246
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:21,800
Why can't they just call it Act of Avendi or whatever?

1247
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:25,560
Or just decide which company gets to keep its name.

1248
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,920
Or VivendiVision or something.

1249
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,440
I just hope this means we get the level 70 Tauren Chieftain Warrior Songs and Guitar

1250
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:33,440
Hero.

1251
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,440
You already made that joke earlier, Rob.

1252
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,440
When we weren't on air.

1253
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:39,320
Why don't they just call the company World of Warcraft?

1254
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:40,320
There you go.

1255
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,320
They should, yeah.

1256
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,320
There you go.

1257
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:46,400
World of Warcraft, World of Warcraft for World of Warcraft players.

1258
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,560
That's a great idea.

1259
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:52,080
That means now Activision is gonna have my bank account number.

1260
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:55,960
I don't know how I feel about that.

1261
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:02,200
All of a sudden you'll get, you know, soldiers coming in from Call of Duty 4.

1262
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:06,440
You know, Blizzard swears up and down this is not gonna have any effect on...

1263
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,440
I doubt it.

1264
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,440
I don't think it will either.

1265
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,440
Why would it?

1266
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,440
I mean...

1267
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,440
I don't know.

1268
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,440
But wouldn't that be interesting though?

1269
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:17,480
Does this happen when like, you know, Activision got Red Octane who had done Guitar Hero, right?

1270
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,800
Then Guitar Hero 3 went to Neversoft.

1271
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,080
Does this mean now that Activision...

1272
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,880
I mean, this is something I could seriously see happening.

1273
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,360
Does this mean now that Activision is another resource for companies such as Blizzard, does

1274
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:31,800
this mean that Activision could send off something that everybody's been waiting for?

1275
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:35,800
Like Starcraft Ghost somewhere else to be developed and finished?

1276
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:36,800
It's possible.

1277
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,280
That's the ramification I think could happen out of this.

1278
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:47,720
Or we could have such wonderful games as Project Gotham Racing World of Warcraft Edition where

1279
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:51,160
you're racing cars through World of Warcraft.

1280
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:54,800
Yes, because there's so many cars in World of War...

1281
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:55,800
Hey!

1282
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:56,800
Hey!

1283
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:57,800
Listen.

1284
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:58,800
Fictional tracks, okay?

1285
01:04:58,800 --> 01:04:59,800
Come on.

1286
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,200
Obviously there's not real cars there, but they could have flying mounts.

1287
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,200
It would have to be...

1288
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,200
You could race your mounts.

1289
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,200
Project...

1290
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,360
Project Gotham Kodo Racing would work.

1291
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,360
Oh my god.

1292
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:12,480
That's terrible.

1293
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:17,720
That would be my guess on what's going to happen is that some of the Blizzard franchises

1294
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,720
that Blizzard has not had time to pay attention to...

1295
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:20,920
Guitar Hero is the new...

1296
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:24,480
Activision will make Diablo III.

1297
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,480
Somebody's going to do it.

1298
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,080
Guitar Hero is the new class in the next Warcraft.

1299
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,240
Oh, that would be awesome!

1300
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:31,240
Expansion.

1301
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,240
Being able to play instruments.

1302
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:34,240
Yeah.

1303
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:38,080
We could come up with tons of dumb ideas.

1304
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:42,640
Frisbee says, there's no tracks in World of Warcraft, in reference to that commercial

1305
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,800
from a little while ago.

1306
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:49,560
I want a game, though, that would be cool to have a role-playing game online that has

1307
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:53,620
a bunch of weird shit in it that makes no sense whatsoever, because I've never played

1308
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:54,620
a game like that.

1309
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:55,620
Exactly!

1310
01:05:55,620 --> 01:06:02,400
But I'm talking absolutely crazy shit, where you can summon a giant jeep to come through

1311
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,720
and crush people, just for no apparent reason.

1312
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:06,720
Just crazy shit.

1313
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,720
Oh my god.

1314
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:11,240
And so are you proposing that you need to meet with the heads of Activision Blizzard

1315
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,920
to propose Loki's World of Randomness?

1316
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,760
Hey, I like the ring of that.

1317
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:19,880
I think I might buy that.

1318
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:24,280
Chat room, would you buy a game called Loki's World of Randomness?

1319
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,980
I'm going to attack you with my cat.

1320
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:28,980
Laser cats.

1321
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:29,980
Laser cats.

1322
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:32,640
We'll license laser cats.

1323
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,800
There you have it.

1324
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,080
Ten million right there.

1325
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,080
Jellybean attacks.

1326
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:42,080
Oh no, zap it with a laser cat.

1327
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:46,160
I summon the truck to run it over, never mind.

1328
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,520
Less QQ, more Mew Mew.

1329
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,800
That was awful.

1330
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,840
We should move on.

1331
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:56,440
The doctor says I would pay $300.

1332
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:02,560
Dark Tetsuya says do want.

1333
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:06,120
Dark Tetsuya gave you a LOL Irene for your less QQ, more Mew Mew.

1334
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,120
Yay.

1335
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,120
I like that.

1336
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,120
That was good.

1337
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,120
Good times.

1338
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,120
Alrighty.

1339
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,120
Sony.

1340
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,120
What the hell is that?

1341
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:17,760
Talking dolphins?

1342
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:21,720
It's unfortunately a reference to a book that sucks.

1343
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:28,280
Anyhow, Sony has decided to drop their ad agency of the past 13 years.

1344
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,960
Why did they decide to drop it now?

1345
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:37,240
Well, I'm guessing probably after what happened in hindsight of the whole PlayStation 3 debacle

1346
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:39,880
where the ads were not so hot.

1347
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,160
Well, that was like last year.

1348
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,160
I mean, come on.

1349
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,520
There's like, you know, we really should drop them.

1350
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,520
I mean, come on.

1351
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,840
It hasn't really done that well for us.

1352
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,080
Let's give it some more time.

1353
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,080
Come on.

1354
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,800
Well, maybe the people will turn around a year later.

1355
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:56,160
Maybe we should really drop them now because these ads have kind of sucked.

1356
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,160
Okay.

1357
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:05,080
So in reference, the ad agency was TBWA Chiade was the full name of the ad agency.

1358
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:10,200
And if you're wondering, does this affect both the U.S. and Europe, yes, it does.

1359
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:13,560
They were also the ones that created the whole black and white campaign.

1360
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:17,960
Remember that thing for the PSP that some people called racist and the other like circus

1361
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,620
to Soleil one they have going on.

1362
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:22,480
This has been kind of a long time coming.

1363
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,700
Oh my God.

1364
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,200
Some might say.

1365
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:29,920
Anyways, just in case you're worried that Grand Theft Auto might not be coming out pretty

1366
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:30,920
soon.

1367
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,500
Well, we still don't know when it's coming out.

1368
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:38,320
But they are starting to run some more videos and stuff for it, including a box art reveal

1369
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:45,480
trailer, which they elaborately painted a, you know, giant copy of the box art for Grand

1370
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:48,760
Theft Auto IV on a giant canvas painting.

1371
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,320
And it looks pretty awesome, but you know, your typical Grand Theft Auto.

1372
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,040
It's like every other Grand Theft Auto game I've ever seen.

1373
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,040
Yeah, your typical Grand Theft Auto one.

1374
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:58,000
Of course, people are dissecting to say, Oh my God, there's motorcycles and helicopters

1375
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
in the game.

1376
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Oh, really?

1377
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Like every other game.

1378
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,600
Anyways, so I hope the giant air tram can be used as like a weapon or something.

1379
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,880
Yeah, I hope you can cut the cables to that thing.

1380
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:13,800
Oh, I wish anyways.

1381
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:18,480
But there's going to be a brand new trailer on December 6th, which is entitled Move Up

1382
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:21,480
Ladies.

1383
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:32,800
Next Thursday at 3 p.m. Eastern Time is when you can expect that trailer, when the internet

1384
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:33,800
explodes with it all over the place.

1385
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:37,440
Yeah, but you can expect to see it 24 hours later after the traffic dies down because

1386
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:40,480
you know their servers are going to get killed when the trailer comes out.

1387
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:46,480
Because like, didn't they say when the first one came out that it broke the internet?

1388
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:48,120
Yeah, something like that.

1389
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:51,560
But hey, that's good that they're showing trailers because that means that there's more

1390
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,280
work being done on it.

1391
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:56,640
At least that's what I'd like to assume.

1392
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,920
Some new details have come out for another game that's getting an anticipated sequel

1393
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:00,920
next year.

1394
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:05,780
Silent Hill 5 comes out next year and some new details have come out about the game.

1395
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:10,560
The flashlight and radio static is going to be returning to the game.

1396
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,420
Those kind of features didn't really exist in Silent Hill 4.

1397
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:16,800
But then again, that's not very surprising because Silent Hill 4 was not even originally

1398
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,320
going to be a Silent Hill game, so what have you.

1399
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:25,160
Light apparently is going to actually kind of have a pretty major function in this game.

1400
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:29,120
The enemies will respond based on whatever the light is doing.

1401
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:33,600
There's also going to be some puzzles that involve an x-ray viewer and nurses that you

1402
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,880
know are doing scary things.

1403
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:41,200
It sounds like the game of course is being greatly inspired by the Silent Hill movie

1404
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,240
but I don't think that's such a bad thing to be honest.

1405
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,920
I loved the movie.

1406
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:45,920
Here's the other biggest change.

1407
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,480
Silent Hill 5 will not have preset camera angles.

1408
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:50,480
Really?

1409
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,560
You will control the entire visuals.

1410
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:56,840
That's actually, I'm not sure how I feel about that.

1411
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:00,240
That could be a double edged sword there.

1412
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:03,760
And then the other thing that's kind of weird about it too is the damage system that they

1413
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:08,600
have in it now is going to be like Metal Gear Solid 3 where there's just not health power

1414
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,520
ups anymore to heal you.

1415
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,840
You have to like, I don't know.

1416
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,160
Kill a snake and eat it.

1417
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:19,080
Break a grenade open and like, you know.

1418
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:22,520
Silent Hill 5, break a grenade open and.

1419
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,480
Like Rambo style or something, I don't know.

1420
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:26,520
That's going to be interesting.

1421
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:31,700
Also there's supposed to be a mini game that has puzzles from like God of War which were

1422
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:34,560
like DDR-ish in a way, button tapping things.

1423
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:40,680
Oh god, like every other fucking game on earth now with the stupid context sensitive shit.

1424
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:43,600
Yes, but Konami made DDR so it's okay.

1425
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:48,720
Wait, it's not like DDR, it's just Shenmue did it first.

1426
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:49,720
Whatever.

1427
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:56,040
Anyways, Metal Gear Solid 4, according to the producer, must sell a million copies day

1428
01:11:56,040 --> 01:12:00,920
one in order for them to make their money.

1429
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:07,440
So with that being released exclusively on the Playstation 3 right now, that's going

1430
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,640
to be pretty hard for them to do.

1431
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:13,080
I mean the Eye of Judgment could only sell 17,000 in the first three weeks.

1432
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:20,280
Let me put it this way, no Playstation 3 to date has sold a million copies day one.

1433
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:24,960
I don't know if any of them have sold a million copies at all.

1434
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:29,600
So I mean, granted, if there was going to be a game that's going to do that, I'd say

1435
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,960
Metal Gear Solid 4 would probably be it.

1436
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,760
Are we sure this guy wasn't just exaggerating a little bit?

1437
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:41,360
No, just because of the price it cost to develop this stuff.

1438
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:47,400
It's got to sell that many units in order to make up its production costs.

1439
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:51,200
But anyway, that might be worldwide.

1440
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:55,280
I don't know, if it's worldwide I could see that it could probably do that.

1441
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,820
It will sell a million units probably.

1442
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:02,360
But then again, also people wanting to draw that conclusion, well if they can't sell a

1443
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:07,280
million units on the Playstation 3, maybe if they developed it for the Xbox 360 as well

1444
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:12,940
they could sell a million units and whatever.

1445
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:15,400
Maybe it will come out on the Xbox 360 someday.

1446
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:20,520
Alright, well PC gamers are going to be very happy to hear, especially those that are into

1447
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:25,280
first person shooters blended with RPGs, that Deus Ex is getting another sequel.

1448
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:28,760
Deus Ex 3 is coming out from Eidos.

1449
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:32,080
This was announced when they were talking about their newest studio in Montreal, which

1450
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,640
opened up a little earlier this year.

1451
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:41,480
The studio hopes to expand about 350 people in the year 2009, and they just recently have

1452
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:42,680
started development on the game.

1453
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:46,960
It just passed proof of concept stage, Deus Ex 3.

1454
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,000
We will see what develops on this game.

1455
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,680
I'm sure lots of people are foaming at the mouth because I know this is a very popular

1456
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:55,760
game on the PC.

1457
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:59,480
Here's a strange rumor that's coming from a very unusual source.

1458
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:05,520
The unofficial Artie Lang site, you might know him from the Howard Stern show.

1459
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:11,600
Apparently Lang will be voicing the role of a character named Big Al in an upcoming Leisure

1460
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:17,160
Suit Larry game, which I think is pretty cool that they are making another Leisure Suit

1461
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:20,480
Larry game.

1462
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:25,260
That's a very interesting way that they found out that a new game is coming.

1463
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:31,440
No word on when it's coming or what it's going to be, but interesting.

1464
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:37,920
Yeah, I don't think a new Leisure Suit Larry game is going to really be that impressive,

1465
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:38,920
to be honest.

1466
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:39,920
Nah, the last one wasn't.

1467
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:40,920
Alright.

1468
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:49,600
Well, IGN has recently published their list of the OMG Top 100 Games of All Time list,

1469
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,600
which it seems like...

1470
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,060
Don't we get a list like this every couple of years?

1471
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:53,060
Every year.

1472
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:57,440
Here's the reason why I actually wanted to bring it up, is that I got to say, I think

1473
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:00,000
the list isn't that bad, all things considered.

1474
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,360
I know I've given corporate websites a hard time in the past, but all things considered,

1475
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:09,440
I actually think this list is not too far different from what my list might look like

1476
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,160
of the top games of all time.

1477
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,160
I'll just run down.

1478
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:15,640
Obviously, I don't have time to read all 100, but let's recap maybe the top 20 real quick.

1479
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:19,080
I'll breeze through the bottom 10, and I'll go over the top 10.

1480
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,680
Metal Gear Solid was number 20.

1481
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,880
Doom was number 19.

1482
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,440
Chrono Trigger was number 18.

1483
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:26,440
Boo!

1484
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,440
It should be number 1.

1485
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:33,360
17 was Super Mario World, 16 was Shadow of the Colossus, 15 was Castlevania Symphony

1486
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:41,740
of the Night, 14 was Pirates by Sid Meier, 13 was Ms. Pac-Man, 12 was Star Wars TIE Fighter.

1487
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:43,840
I like that this list included PC games, too.

1488
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:44,840
11 was StarCraft.

1489
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,500
Alright, then here's the top 10.

1490
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:53,360
Resident Evil 4 was number 10 on the GameCube, and obviously that game got a lot of game

1491
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:56,840
of the year accolades when it came out, and it is a pretty great game.

1492
01:15:56,840 --> 01:16:04,040
Final Fantasy III or VI by the Japanese scale was the number 9 game of all time, which I

1493
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:07,720
believe is the highest ranking Final Fantasy game on the list, so Final Fantasy VII was

1494
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:12,460
not in the top 10, which I'm sure makes fanboys mad, but I think that's okay.

1495
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:17,040
Number 8 was The Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past.

1496
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:22,420
Number 7 was Super Metroid, which would probably be my number 1, honestly.

1497
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:25,320
Number 6 was Half-Life 2.

1498
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:30,280
Number 5 was Super Mario 64, which a lot of people would probably put as their number

1499
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:33,300
1, so it's kind of interesting that there's still some more games to go here.

1500
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:35,640
Number 4 is The Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time.

1501
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:38,800
So that's two Zeldas in the top 10?

1502
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,680
Well, you know, the Zelda games are great games.

1503
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:42,680
We're just confirming.

1504
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:45,840
Yeah, no, it's two Zelda games in the top 10 so far.

1505
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,920
Number 3 is Civilization II.

1506
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:52,880
God bless them for remembering the Civilization series, because it is a great series.

1507
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,480
It does deserve to be that high on the list.

1508
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:58,380
Although I would have put the original Civilization, but that's just me.

1509
01:16:58,380 --> 01:16:59,640
Number 2 is Tetris.

1510
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:00,640
Tetris.

1511
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,760
Hmm, what's number 1?

1512
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:02,760
What do you think number 1?

1513
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:05,000
The number 1 greatest game of all time?

1514
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,360
Pac-Man?

1515
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:12,600
Super Mario Bros. on the NES, the very first original Super Mario Bros. game.

1516
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:17,280
That does make a lot of sense, because who doesn't remember Super Mario Bros.?

1517
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:21,240
If you played the theme for somebody, who doesn't know that theme and what that is?

1518
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,560
Yeah, Mario is part of pop culture.

1519
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:27,800
People know who Mario is, so it makes a lot of sense.

1520
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,280
And it was a pretty good game at the time.

1521
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,280
Well, yeah.

1522
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,280
So there you go.

1523
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,280
Still is.

1524
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,200
Alright, well, there's a different website.

1525
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:38,720
I also happen to be affiliated with IGN, doing another Top 10 list.

1526
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:45,400
This of course is AskMen's Top 10 Hottest Women in Tech.

1527
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:48,380
We'll run down this list here real quick, too.

1528
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:54,040
Number 10, Wendy Chang, who apparently is a...

1529
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,040
Let's see here.

1530
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,040
Don't know her.

1531
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,040
Don't know her.

1532
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:04,040
She apparently does vidcasts on a network, clicknetwork.tv.

1533
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:05,200
But she has big boobies.

1534
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,200
So that's fine.

1535
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:07,200
And she's Asian.

1536
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,880
So, two points there.

1537
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,840
Rise Princess has big boobies, and she's Asian.

1538
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:11,840
Oh, stop it.

1539
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:12,840
Anyways.

1540
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:15,280
I don't do my own video games, though.

1541
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:28,160
Let's see, Blair Butler, who is a stand-up comedian, and she's on X-Play, or she's a

1542
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:30,160
writer on X-Play.

1543
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:39,320
And she also has a reoccurring bit and tell geek out that appears on G4's website.

1544
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:42,280
All these people G4 people, no.

1545
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:46,120
Kristen Holt, she was a Dallas Cowboy...

1546
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:47,440
No, she was on American Idol.

1547
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,120
Yes, she was on American Idol.

1548
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,120
I've heard of her.

1549
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:56,400
She was also a Dallas Cowboy's cheerleader, and now she's the host of G4's Cheat.

1550
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,560
Wow.

1551
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:04,440
And she also hosts a new game called Shout About Television.

1552
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:07,320
And she's working also as a tech reporter on Attack of the Shout.

1553
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:13,000
Some might call this podcast Shout About Video Games, especially when Loki reviews things.

1554
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,800
Hey, enough back talk.

1555
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,400
That was a good one, Rahab.

1556
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:23,640
Anyways, Amanda Cogdon, I don't know her either.

1557
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:28,360
She apparently has a gig on Rocketboom, a daily video blog.

1558
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:29,760
Wow.

1559
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,080
Whatever.

1560
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:38,920
Anyways, Veronica Belmont, not related, no relation to Simon Belmont.

1561
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:41,880
Boring, then I don't give a shit about her.

1562
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,260
Never heard of her.

1563
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:50,960
She has, I guess, she's acted as a producer and sound engineer for CNET's Buzz Out Loud

1564
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,680
podcast.

1565
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:55,200
Let's move it a little faster, Loki.

1566
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,200
Sorry.

1567
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,200
Any guesses?

1568
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,200
Number one, Morgan Webb?

1569
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,200
No, this is not number one.

1570
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:00,880
Actually, here, I'll just skip to number one.

1571
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,160
We'll do the top three here real quick.

1572
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,160
Thank you.

1573
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:09,600
Anyways, number three, Jessica Chobot.

1574
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,600
She's the one that licked the PSP, right?

1575
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,640
She's the one that licked the PSP, and she's also...

1576
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:13,640
Okay, have her to her.

1577
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:14,640
Who is she?

1578
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:15,640
She's also...

1579
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:16,640
She was Friday Inn.

1580
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:23,120
She was a model, and she does a lot of stuff on IGN, including their on the street stuff,

1581
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:26,880
and she does the IGN Weekly and all that kind of crap.

1582
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,880
Number two is Morgan Webb.

1583
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:32,380
And only IGN could hire a woman to walk the streets and get paid for it.

1584
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:33,600
That's what women do naturally.

1585
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,000
They're so good at it.

1586
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,920
Morgan Webb, of course, she's on X-Play, and we all know who she is.

1587
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,100
She's the number one, then.

1588
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:45,840
Number one is Amber McArthur, and apparently she's on...

1589
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:46,840
I've never heard of her.

1590
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:50,560
She's on G4's Tech2Be Canada's Call for Help show.

1591
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,000
Okay, I have to see what she looks like.

1592
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
She's...

1593
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
No.

1594
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
I want to see if she's pretty.

1595
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
That's stand out.

1596
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
I mean, she's cute, but...

1597
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
She's very plain.

1598
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,240
You know who she looks like?

1599
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:03,240
What the hell was her name from Melrose Place?

1600
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:04,240
Was it Melrose?

1601
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:05,240
Heather Locklear?

1602
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:06,240
No.

1603
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,240
Oh.

1604
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,240
So maybe it was...

1605
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:09,240
Was it Melrose Place?

1606
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:10,240
Come on, Courtney?

1607
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,240
I know who you're talking about.

1608
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:12,240
Courtney, yeah.

1609
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:13,240
She was...

1610
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:14,240
I don't know.

1611
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,240
I don't know about her.

1612
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,240
I don't know who she looks like.

1613
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,240
Yes, her.

1614
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,640
I don't fucking remember, but she looks exactly like her.

1615
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:20,640
She's...

1616
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,680
The very plain looking one on Ally McBeal, too.

1617
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:31,560
Yes, and also Ally McBeal, the character, but wow, whoop-dee-doo.

1618
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:36,640
But hey, I mean, seriously, why are they doing a top ten list?

1619
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:37,920
Stop doing top ten lists, people.

1620
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,720
People that nobody knows or cares about.

1621
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:42,120
The chat room is naming some other people.

1622
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:45,880
Miranda Cosgrove says Sakura Max, don't know who that is.

1623
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:49,040
Olivia Munn says DJ Dark Knight.

1624
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,960
Don't know who that is.

1625
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,040
She's on Attack of the Show, right?

1626
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:53,040
Diane Miyazoda.

1627
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,040
Oh.

1628
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:55,040
Yeah.

1629
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,040
That's what Son of Dad says.

1630
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,040
Diane Miyazoda.

1631
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:02,240
She doesn't do Cheetah anymore, though, or not Cheetah, Filter.

1632
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,240
She does...

1633
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:05,920
She actually does some, like, I want to see, like a...

1634
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:06,920
Rama says that's her name.

1635
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:07,920
Courtney Thorne-Smith.

1636
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,280
Courtney Thorne-Smith.

1637
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,280
That's what it is.

1638
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:15,440
It's like a... was it a makeover show or something like that, like for kids or something?

1639
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,440
It's like a...

1640
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:17,440
It's not...

1641
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,440
Makeover for kids.

1642
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,140
It's not for kids.

1643
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:21,140
It's like...

1644
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:23,680
Damn, my kid is ugly, Diane.

1645
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:26,520
Not like that, like a room makeover.

1646
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,760
It's like, you know, trading spaces, but for kids.

1647
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,480
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

1648
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:31,480
I've seen that before.

1649
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:32,480
So...

1650
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,560
No, it's not a makeover.

1651
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,560
You're too fat, Timmy.

1652
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:36,560
You're gonna get liposuction.

1653
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,040
Well, haven't you ever seen that store at the mall?

1654
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,760
What's it called, the Libby Loo or whatever?

1655
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:41,760
Like it...

1656
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:42,760
That's what...

1657
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:44,480
It's like a makeover for little seven-year-old girls store.

1658
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:47,080
And then, like, it's like a place where girls are supposed to have, like, their birthday

1659
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:49,120
parties and stuff, and they'll get...

1660
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:53,060
They'll all get makeovers together, and then, like, I swear to God, one day we were walking

1661
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:54,060
by there.

1662
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:58,000
I think it was Shane and I were at the mall, walking by there, and the little seven-year-old

1663
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,240
girls were putting on a little dance routine that they'd learn, and oh my God, they look

1664
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,240
like little sluts.

1665
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:08,400
I mean, this is a horrible thing to say about seven-year-olds, but who would let their seven-year-old

1666
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,400
learn these type of dances?

1667
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:11,440
I mean, they looked like they were training to become strippers.

1668
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:14,720
It was horrible.

1669
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:15,720
And I think...

1670
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:18,560
I don't remember who it was that said it, but somebody that I was with said something

1671
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,960
about like, wow, they look like a bunch of little sluts, and one of the kids' parents

1672
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:22,960
was right there.

1673
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:23,960
And they're like...

1674
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:29,120
They turn around, and they're like, yes, that's what we wanted.

1675
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:30,760
Mission accomplished.

1676
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:31,760
Anyhow.

1677
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:38,560
Let's go ahead and move on with some other news, such as Super Smash Brothers.

1678
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,920
We were talking about the Wii earlier in the show.

1679
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:45,400
Super Smash Brothers Brawl, just the news does not stop about Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

1680
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:50,520
And what's pretty awesome is that some of the old stages from Melee are going to return

1681
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:52,040
in Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

1682
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:56,480
So like the Zelda II temple is coming back.

1683
01:23:56,480 --> 01:24:00,680
But what they did is they actually, I think they like combined two stages to make this

1684
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:01,680
stage.

1685
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:02,680
Is that better?

1686
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:05,040
No, that looks like the stage.

1687
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,640
To me, that was a full stage.

1688
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:15,640
Let me actually look at the original post here on the dojo about what it is.

1689
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,200
Oh no, I guess it is the same stage.

1690
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:18,440
Yeah, it looks exactly the same.

1691
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:23,640
And they also posted the music from the stage there on the website.

1692
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:28,280
That's a little bit of a remix.

1693
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:29,880
Very cool.

1694
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:33,320
That's on the SmashBrothers.com website.

1695
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,320
Check that out.

1696
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,760
Alright, well gosh, part A is running long tonight.

1697
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,160
We're almost at an hour and a half.

1698
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:42,880
But we want to go ahead and close out part A here, the way we always do, by paying tribute

1699
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:46,200
to the classic games of yesteryear.

1700
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:49,600
And Dark Soccer is not here tonight to do the classic game of the week, but we've been

1701
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,600
filling in.

1702
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:53,440
Last week I picked a game, Equinox, if you forgot.

1703
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:58,440
And this week, Loki's going to pick a game for us as his classic game of the week.

1704
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:05,800
Yes, classic game, I was torn on what I should pick.

1705
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,160
Almost picked Gals Pamming.

1706
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:12,540
But no, we'll save that for another episode when she's gone as well.

1707
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:18,800
This week I decided to pick a wonderful game that I loved on the Super Nintendo and was

1708
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,760
also on the Genesis as well.

1709
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:24,920
It's a game called Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

1710
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:26,880
And it's absolutely awesome.

1711
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:27,880
It's very cheesy.

1712
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:33,440
It's kind of like a spoof on a bunch of horror films from the 1950s and 60s.

1713
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:38,520
It was made by LucasArts, actually published by Konami.

1714
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:41,160
And definitely a game you should check out.

1715
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:46,920
I wish it would come out on virtual consoles so we can play it again.

1716
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:50,800
But tons and tons and tons of different levels you can play.

1717
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:58,320
They have like squirt guns, grenades, all sorts of things you can fight.

1718
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,480
Things from giant babies to UFOs, zombies.

1719
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:02,480
You name it.

1720
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,400
It's an awesome game.

1721
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,120
Really fun.

1722
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,640
I've actually never played this game.

1723
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:08,640
No, I really have.

1724
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:11,000
This is one of those games I just kind of missed.

1725
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
You need to go do this.

1726
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Well then that's why they need to put it out on virtual console.

1727
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:19,760
Yeah, you basically run through the stages trying to rescue people and stuff and collect

1728
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:24,920
weapons and then sometimes they'll have you fight different things.

1729
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:27,640
And each one of the stages is titled after a movie.

1730
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:28,640
It's kind of like spoofed.

1731
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:33,680
So they'll have a bunch that are like Night of the Living Dead and stuff like that.

1732
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:34,680
That's cool.

1733
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:35,680
He's freezing the zombies in this one.

1734
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:40,840
Yeah, it might sound like it's kind of a generic game but it's really stylized and it's like

1735
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:41,840
really fun.

1736
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:42,840
You really just have to play it.

1737
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:43,840
It's really interesting.

1738
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:48,080
I always hear folks talking about this game but I've never really seen it in action so

1739
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:50,480
there's a little cheerleader.

1740
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,560
So by running over them they're saving them or something?

1741
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:53,560
Yeah.

1742
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:54,840
Oh, I think I remember seeing something like this.

1743
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:57,440
He bounces on a trampoline to get over the hedge, right?

1744
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,440
Yep.

1745
01:26:58,440 --> 01:26:59,440
Or he can...

1746
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:00,440
Can he...

1747
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:02,440
Oh yeah, he's saving that guy.

1748
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:03,440
Interesting.

1749
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,440
Oh, somebody else is bouncing on a trampoline.

1750
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,440
Oh, that's kind of neat.

1751
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:08,440
Alright, pretty cool.

1752
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:11,360
Zombies Ate My Neighbors, your classic video game of the week.

1753
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,040
Thank you very much, Loki.

1754
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:15,040
Good job.

1755
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,040
You're welcome.

1756
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:20,320
Well, Loki, you sound like you've got a makeover.

1757
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:24,920
Alright, anyhow, let's use this opportunity to take a little break and when we come back,

1758
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,640
plenty more gaming news.

1759
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,920
We have Xbox news we haven't even touched.

1760
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:30,840
Xbox has a new dashboard update coming out soon.

1761
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:34,240
We've got all the details when we come back from this little break.

1762
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:35,240
Stay tuned.

1763
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:36,640
Now you touched it.

1764
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:41,960
Well, we'll get our hands real dirty with it when we come back, especially you and naughty

1765
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:42,960
Rice Princess.

1766
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:43,960
Yeah, because it's a piece of crap.

1767
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:44,960
Alright.

1768
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:48,040
The update for the Xbox continues all segment long.

1769
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:50,480
Alright, let's take a break.

1770
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:54,880
