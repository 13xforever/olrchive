00:00:14,106 --> 00:00:23,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, December 2nd, 2007, the Wii gets DS demo downloads, Sony swaps out their ad agency, and Dimix comes to Xbox in the next update.

2
00:00:32,153 --> 00:00:36,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,956 --> 00:00:43,301
[SPEAKER_04]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:52,107
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you out there who have recently turned to independent radio this week in light of recent events, a warm welcome from all of us here at OLR.

5
00:00:52,287 --> 00:00:53,628
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:55,006
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

7
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:21,940
[SPEAKER_04]: We are joined tonight by the lovely Rice Princess filling in tonight.

8
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:22,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

9
00:01:23,301 --> 00:01:27,843
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not just the Rob and Loki show, because otherwise... It'd be pretty fucking boring.

10
00:01:27,943 --> 00:01:29,324
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be pretty fucking boring.

11
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,945
[SPEAKER_04]: You put two nerds together and stuff.

12
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,145
[SPEAKER_04]: So we brought in a third nerd.

13
00:01:32,265 --> 00:01:32,766
[SPEAKER_04]: So hello, Rice Princess.

14
00:01:32,786 --> 00:01:34,086
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it becomes great.

15
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:36,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, three nerds makes it better.

16
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there was a sitcom, wasn't there?

17
00:01:37,608 --> 00:01:39,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, three nerds, three mics in a pizza place?

18
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:40,249
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

19
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:40,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow...

20
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:49,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate that the cam is down this week, and I'll talk more about that later, because Irene has the greatest nerdy shirt in the world.

21
00:01:49,895 --> 00:01:51,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this something you got from Hot Gothic?

22
00:01:51,456 --> 00:01:52,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

23
00:01:52,057 --> 00:01:53,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it's a Metroid shirt.

24
00:01:53,378 --> 00:01:55,120
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically the box art from Metroid.

25
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:55,960
[SPEAKER_04]: And what does it say?

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you defeat the Mother Brain?

27
00:01:57,202 --> 00:01:58,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Or no, beat the Mother Brain.

28
00:01:58,403 --> 00:01:58,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

29
00:01:59,003 --> 00:01:59,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Beat the Mother Brain.

30
00:01:59,784 --> 00:02:02,186
[SPEAKER_04]: But you bought me a shirt too from Hot Topic, right?

31
00:02:02,306 --> 00:02:02,947
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.

32
00:02:03,027 --> 00:02:03,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so excited.

33
00:02:03,927 --> 00:02:04,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I love presents.

34
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:05,489
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to open it.

35
00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:06,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't actually opened it yet.

36
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,911
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm opening it here live on air.

37
00:02:08,351 --> 00:02:09,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Really sucks that the cam's down this week.

38
00:02:10,032 --> 00:02:13,215
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, but it's not gaming related at all.

39
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:14,356
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not gaming related at all.

40
00:02:14,376 --> 00:02:15,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, I didn't take the tag off.

41
00:02:16,017 --> 00:02:16,598
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.

42
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:18,059
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll pretend I didn't see the tag.

43
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you should do that.

44
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:21,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, what is it?

45
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:24,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, that's awesome!

46
00:02:24,787 --> 00:02:26,629
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Pee Wee Herman shirt.

47
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,511
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cherry.

48
00:02:29,252 --> 00:02:32,555
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you should turn it over to the front, because that's the back, I'm sure.

49
00:02:32,635 --> 00:02:33,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Pee Wee's Playhouse.

50
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:34,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's awesome.

51
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:38,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking at the back that had PeeWee on Cherry.

52
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:39,978
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, wow.

53
00:02:40,058 --> 00:02:40,598
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you, PeeWee.

54
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,199
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so exciting.

55
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:43,240
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.

56
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I love PeeWee's Playhouse.

57
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,701
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you do.

58
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:46,041
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.

59
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:48,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Because otherwise I'd be a pretty shitty present.

60
00:02:48,703 --> 00:02:52,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise it's like, here's a shirt of a show you don't like.

61
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,745
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought you needed new clothes, Rob.

62
00:02:53,885 --> 00:02:54,526
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

63
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,507
[SPEAKER_04]: I will definitely wear that next week.

64
00:02:56,527 --> 00:02:58,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully the cam's back next week.

65
00:02:58,448 --> 00:03:00,629
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened to the cam, BTW?

66
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:02,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk more about that in a little bit.

67
00:03:02,786 --> 00:03:04,768
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's start it off with how was your gaming week?

68
00:03:05,308 --> 00:03:07,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, why don't you start us off tonight, how was your gaming week?

69
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:24,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't play as much as I thought I would be playing this week, but mainly my week was filled with Phantom Hourglass And it's fun, it's a normal Zelda game, don't really know what more you'd want Sorry, can I interject here for a minute?

70
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at our chat room, which I neglected to introduce, sorry chat

71
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:30,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com We love the chat room.

72
00:03:30,242 --> 00:03:31,362
[SPEAKER_04]: They always crack us up.

73
00:03:31,682 --> 00:03:35,463
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know how just a little bit ago I was saying, what, three nerds, a mic, whatever.

74
00:03:36,063 --> 00:03:38,203
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Janai comments, where's the cup?

75
00:03:41,224 --> 00:03:41,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

76
00:03:41,824 --> 00:03:42,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Funny.

77
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:42,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it?

78
00:03:42,825 --> 00:03:43,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

79
00:03:43,345 --> 00:03:43,885
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway.

80
00:03:44,585 --> 00:03:44,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

81
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:45,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Ew.

82
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:47,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Delayed reaction.

83
00:03:48,566 --> 00:03:50,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally didn't get it.

84
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:54,907
[SPEAKER_04]: You were the one that kept, like, asking me, like, all week long, have you seen the two girls, one cup thing yet?

85
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,248
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not ask you.

86
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,540
[SPEAKER_01]: That's perverted and gross.

87
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, sorry, Loki.

88
00:04:05,142 --> 00:04:08,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so yeah, I've been playing Phantom Hourglass and it's fun.

89
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,283
[SPEAKER_03]: So, what else did I play?

90
00:04:11,643 --> 00:04:20,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried the Wii version of the Golden Compass because Nelly wanted me to demonstrate the game for her since she's really into Golden Compass and that's who I got the game for.

91
00:04:21,185 --> 00:04:23,506
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's okay.

92
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:24,306
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty easy.

93
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,807
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess it's based off a video game, obviously.

94
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:30,168
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

95
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:52,558
[SPEAKER_03]: As if, you know, a wolf versus a polar bear was gonna win in the first place.

96
00:04:52,578 --> 00:04:54,579
[SPEAKER_03]: This bear is fucking tricked out with armor.

97
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,661
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no fucking way it's gonna win.

98
00:04:56,761 --> 00:05:02,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but like, look at Final Fantasy XI, where like, you could fight a bunny, and the bunny rapes you for 500 points of damage.

99
00:05:03,025 --> 00:05:05,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's... sometimes video games don't make sense.

100
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:11,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I haven't fought any bunnies yet, but as far as the wolves go, I get the crap out of them.

101
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:13,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Over and over and over again.

102
00:05:13,677 --> 00:05:17,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, you make the Golden Compass sound pretty awesome when you're talking about polar bears and sets of armor.

103
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, you don't even know.

104
00:05:19,882 --> 00:05:31,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't read the book or seen the movie yet, but apparently the characters in this story have their souls outside of their body as an animal, and the animal, like, talks in the same voice as the girl in the game.

105
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:37,514
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's confusing because it sounds like the girl's having conversations with herself, and it's like...

106
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:38,882
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

107
00:06:04,136 --> 00:06:06,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I did play Super Mario Galaxy, though, because I was sick this week.

108
00:06:06,938 --> 00:06:07,518
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you think of it?

109
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm still playing it, and it's fun.

110
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:13,482
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very, very, very much like Mario 64.

111
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:15,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, same kind of setup.

112
00:06:15,423 --> 00:06:16,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, you know, no red coins.

113
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, I don't know.

114
00:06:22,127 --> 00:06:25,188
[SPEAKER_03]: This is pretty much it, I think, from Saints Row.

115
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,870
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yeah.

116
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:30,600
[SPEAKER_04]: What's so funny about Saints Row?

117
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,302
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just like you're playing Saints Row.

118
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:34,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and Earth Defense Force 2017.

119
00:06:35,403 --> 00:06:35,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.

120
00:06:36,024 --> 00:06:36,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Still playing some of that.

121
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:37,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.

122
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:44,550
[SPEAKER_03]: We went and tried to beat the second to last level on Inferno, and that's like getting raped by thousands of ants at the same time.

123
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:45,850
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not very fun.

124
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

125
00:06:48,272 --> 00:06:49,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, My Gaming Week...

126
00:06:50,325 --> 00:07:19,749
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff unfortunately I've just been very busy I've been watching my roommate play a hell of a lot of Puzzle Quest though on Xbox Live Arcade which is kind of funny because he doesn't get into a lot of video games but when he does he definitely puts he's committed so he's been very committed to Puzzle Quest he's already at level 20 he's gotten way further in the game than I have that's kind of funny yeah so he's enjoying that and other than that I've just been playing the regular World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XI you know because I just love my MMOs

127
00:07:21,215 --> 00:07:21,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

128
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:22,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing Rock Band.

129
00:07:23,197 --> 00:07:29,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I went online with Rock Band this week, and I gotta say, I'm just pissed off that you can't do band co-op mode.

130
00:07:29,904 --> 00:07:31,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, why did they leave that out?

131
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:33,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you can do band competitive.

132
00:07:33,547 --> 00:07:44,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not even really competitive, but you can do the one song stuff online, like one song at a time, but you can't do the world tour mode online, which seems kind of stupid, because it's not like

133
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:47,166
[SPEAKER_04]: The Game's Unable to let four people play online at once.

134
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:55,250
[SPEAKER_04]: That was kind of like one of the reasons I was excited about Rock Band is I kind of thought you were going to be able to make these bands together with people from far away.

135
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:59,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, Shane, who hasn't been on the show in a long time because he lives in Kansas, also bought the game.

136
00:07:59,973 --> 00:08:02,194
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was thinking, oh, we could have a band and we'd play together.

137
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:02,754
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be fun.

138
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:04,695
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do have a band already.

139
00:08:06,336 --> 00:08:10,098
[SPEAKER_04]: A rock band, not a real band where, you know, I play kazoo and...

140
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:21,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just pissed that co-op mode was kind of missing in that regard.

141
00:08:21,894 --> 00:08:25,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, they did have a David Bowie pack come out this week, and that was pretty awesome.

142
00:08:25,656 --> 00:08:26,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?

143
00:08:26,196 --> 00:08:27,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Because David Bowie is very awesome.

144
00:08:27,557 --> 00:08:28,358
[SPEAKER_01]: He is.

145
00:08:28,678 --> 00:08:28,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

146
00:08:28,838 --> 00:08:30,199
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like a cover of Heroes.

147
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:30,679
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good.

148
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:31,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

149
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

150
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,141
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really it.

151
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a lot else of note.

152
00:08:34,602 --> 00:08:35,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a lot of new games this week.

153
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:38,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I did play Undertow, but...

154
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:40,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, just not my kind of game.

155
00:08:40,065 --> 00:08:40,765
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't feeling it.

156
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:51,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to... It was hard to... I mean, it wasn't hard to figure it out or figure the game out, but I thought the tutorial could have been a little better because there were so many different little features in this strategy game.

157
00:08:51,828 --> 00:09:01,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot to mention it last week, and it hasn't really been on any of the websites yet, but they released the Pay the Unlock content for Katamari.

158
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:01,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah?

159
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,710
[SPEAKER_03]: We Love Katamari.

160
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Or not We Love Katamari, Beautiful Katamari.

161
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,191
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I bought that, and then afterwards I'm like,

162
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did I buy that?

163
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:12,101
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good question.

164
00:09:12,141 --> 00:09:12,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did you buy that?

165
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:14,321
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an impulse buy.

166
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:16,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought one of those $20 cards.

167
00:09:16,962 --> 00:09:17,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

168
00:09:17,902 --> 00:09:18,323
[SPEAKER_03]: 1600 point cards.

169
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:20,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I didn't buy it per se.

170
00:09:20,723 --> 00:09:24,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I got crap that I didn't want and I traded it for a free card.

171
00:09:24,924 --> 00:09:25,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotcha.

172
00:09:25,785 --> 00:09:35,207
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I can thank a PS3 copy of Assassin's Creed that bought me Rock Band songs and beautiful Katamari download content.

173
00:09:36,565 --> 00:09:40,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Sephiroth1215 on our chatroom says, Rock Band World Tour wouldn't work online.

174
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:41,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

175
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,431
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get it.

176
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:43,072
[SPEAKER_04]: It should.

177
00:09:43,812 --> 00:09:50,639
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, you can't hear, I mean, I see Black Lab talking about the vocals in the game, how you don't actually hear the people singing, although you kind of do.

178
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:56,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if you play, but you can have a full band in the, um, play one song at a time mode co-op.

179
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:59,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what it is, just quick play or whatever it's called.

180
00:09:59,908 --> 00:10:00,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

181
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,001
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, you can have a guitar.

182
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:09,846
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually signed on Xbox Live and got a random band thrown together where some guy was on vocals, I was on guitar, somebody else was on bass, and somebody else was on drums.

183
00:10:10,546 --> 00:10:12,647
[SPEAKER_04]: And we could hear the vocalist singing.

184
00:10:12,688 --> 00:10:19,492
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just a little bit faint and very, very lagged because it was transmitting through his headset or whatever while he was, you know, singing.

185
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:20,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking hate that shit.

186
00:10:21,073 --> 00:10:23,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but the game itself doesn't support that.

187
00:10:23,674 --> 00:10:26,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it plays the normal backtrack because of the lag.

188
00:10:26,436 --> 00:10:27,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, that'd be kind of cool.

189
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:29,518
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do the vocal parts without people hearing you.

190
00:10:29,858 --> 00:10:30,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that idea.

191
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if you just turn your headset off, you can do it without people hearing you.

192
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:37,962
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't hear you.

193
00:10:38,402 --> 00:10:41,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki has a secret desire to sing a little more often, doesn't he?

194
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:42,024
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't.

195
00:10:42,745 --> 00:10:43,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't.

196
00:10:43,265 --> 00:10:43,745
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't.

197
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a secret desire to get achievement points.

198
00:10:46,006 --> 00:10:49,028
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

199
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:53,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Rice Princess, have you been playing anything this week at all?

200
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:54,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Just WoW, really.

201
00:10:55,331 --> 00:10:55,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

202
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:56,772
[SPEAKER_04]: How's WoW been going for you?

203
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

204
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:31,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because, I don't know, WoW's been kind of boring for the past couple months, but now it's not.

205
00:11:31,156 --> 00:11:32,617
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because our guild's too small.

206
00:11:32,737 --> 00:11:33,278
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of sad.

207
00:11:33,298 --> 00:11:34,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we have, like, no tanks.

208
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:35,920
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't run instances together.

209
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,620
[SPEAKER_04]: We have no tanks.

210
00:11:36,941 --> 00:11:48,690
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what I think brought me back to playing is that, like, I don't know, some people were running me through instances, and I ran people through instances, and, like, we have a guild bank now, and I'm totally into that.

211
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Guild banks are awesome.

212
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:51,872
[SPEAKER_01]: And, I don't know, it just became fun again.

213
00:11:51,992 --> 00:11:53,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, good.

214
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:53,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

215
00:11:53,994 --> 00:11:54,254
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty.

216
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,915
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, let's get into some housekeeping tonight, and then we'll get into the gaming news.

217
00:11:59,015 --> 00:12:02,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, DarkSakura is not here tonight, but she will be back next week.

218
00:12:03,317 --> 00:12:04,137
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

219
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:28,379
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

220
00:12:49,964 --> 00:12:52,885
[SPEAKER_04]: and I used the Zapper and we played Link's Crossbow Training.

221
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:58,207
[SPEAKER_04]: And the funny thing that happened is that in the practice round that we played, I fucking wasted Loki.

222
00:12:58,307 --> 00:13:00,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, my score was ten times his score.

223
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:01,008
[SPEAKER_04]: It was crazy.

224
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:02,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I just obliterated him.

225
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:04,089
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was a practice round.

226
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:07,550
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when we did it for reals, Loki beat me by a thousand points.

227
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I was so mad.

228
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:14,012
[SPEAKER_04]: So Loki won the Great Zapper Challenge, proving that the Zapper does nothing to enhance the gameplay.

229
00:13:14,052 --> 00:13:17,193
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, you playing the Zapper, it was crap, wasn't it?

230
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:18,333
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't that great.

231
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,922
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't say the experience was any better.

232
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,585
[SPEAKER_04]: But the crossbow training game was kind of fun, actually.

233
00:13:25,825 --> 00:13:30,749
[SPEAKER_03]: To be devil's advocate and a little bit fair here, from what I hear, Ghost Squad, it's really good.

234
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:40,777
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why is because they have a good calibration system on it where you aim down the zapper at one corner of the screen, aim down the zapper at the other corner of the screen, and then spot on after that.

235
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:41,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good.

236
00:13:41,338 --> 00:13:47,923
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know why every game for the Wii doesn't have something like that in the first place.

237
00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:48,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Really shouldn't have.

238
00:13:48,644 --> 00:13:48,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

239
00:13:49,617 --> 00:13:52,862
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be fucking a default thing to have in there.

240
00:13:52,902 --> 00:13:53,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

241
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:59,891
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so if they add something like that to all the games, they'll be good.

242
00:14:00,211 --> 00:14:02,474
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one good thing that Ghost Squad has going for it.

243
00:14:02,514 --> 00:14:03,756
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully they'll have the same thing.

244
00:14:04,016 --> 00:14:07,081
[SPEAKER_03]: I assume they'll have the same thing in House of the Dead 2 and 3.

245
00:14:07,952 --> 00:14:13,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so, I mean, the whole thing is only, what, $25 for the Zapper and Crossbow Training?

246
00:14:13,713 --> 00:14:17,334
[SPEAKER_03]: It's technically $20, but GameStop is ripping everyone off by $5.

247
00:14:17,374 --> 00:14:19,894
[SPEAKER_03]: They're overcharging over retail for it.

248
00:14:19,914 --> 00:14:22,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so the Wii Mode itself and Link's Crossbow Training is only $20?

249
00:14:22,274 --> 00:14:26,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, the Wii Zapper and the Link's Crossbow Training is only $20 retail.

250
00:14:26,635 --> 00:14:28,155
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not bad, all things considered.

251
00:14:28,236 --> 00:14:29,396
[SPEAKER_04]: That really isn't a bad deal.

252
00:14:29,456 --> 00:14:33,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, granted, the game is probably worth a little more money than... And the game is short.

253
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:36,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's something you're going to beat pretty quickly, but I think it's... You know, it's a...

254
00:14:37,521 --> 00:14:44,964
[SPEAKER_04]: We Sports-ish kind of thing where the game doesn't have a lot of depth, but you're going to have a lot of people that want to just kind of pick it up and play it and have fun with it.

255
00:14:45,144 --> 00:14:47,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's not like the game was that difficult to figure out.

256
00:14:47,986 --> 00:14:48,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

257
00:14:49,206 --> 00:14:51,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was kind of fun.

258
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:52,948
[SPEAKER_04]: But that sucks that Loki won the bet.

259
00:14:53,028 --> 00:14:57,530
[SPEAKER_04]: So no date for me and Loki gets... Is the wife going to let me take her out or what?

260
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

261
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to talk about that this week.

262
00:15:00,011 --> 00:15:00,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that happened.

263
00:15:01,051 --> 00:15:02,172
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can have your night of peace.

264
00:15:02,772 --> 00:15:02,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

265
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:11,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, I was going to say for next week, because I have a whole bunch of games on queue to play.

266
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:14,634
[SPEAKER_03]: A bunch of import stuff.

267
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:17,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragon Quest Swords for the Wii.

268
00:15:18,056 --> 00:15:19,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Harvest Moon for the Wii.

269
00:15:19,176 --> 00:15:20,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Why the fuck am I going to play Harvest Moon?

270
00:15:20,677 --> 00:15:25,159
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking hate Harvest Moon, but I'm going to try it anyways on the Wii for the hell of it.

271
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:32,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Devil Kings 2 for the Wii, which I hear is really fucking good.

272
00:15:32,928 --> 00:15:34,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try that out.

273
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:40,610
[SPEAKER_03]: And then DDR Haas Party for the Wii, the Japanese version, because they have a few different songs that I want to try out.

274
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:47,892
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to do the All Controller Controller Revolution because it does support the classic controller to do that, which I didn't know.

275
00:15:47,912 --> 00:15:49,572
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh, okay.

276
00:15:50,112 --> 00:15:52,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do it that way because I don't want to buy a dance bed.

277
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:56,074
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm trying to think what else I had.

278
00:15:56,614 --> 00:16:00,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Cruisin', probably one of the worst racing games out there.

279
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:05,731
[SPEAKER_03]: by, you know, screenshots at least, so I'm going to play it to see how crappy it is.

280
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:15,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Then another game that I know is going to be even worse, which is Offroad Extreme Special Edition, is what it's called, and it's another piece of shit that's coming out there.

281
00:16:16,115 --> 00:16:18,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll play them so you don't have to.

282
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:19,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you know what, though?

283
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:21,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Crappy games can be good.

284
00:16:21,492 --> 00:16:28,379
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I saw today they have the box shots for the Simple Series 3 and 4 coming out for the Wii in Japan.

285
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:29,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Simple Series 1.

286
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also going to be playing Mita de Kart Race, another kart racing game.

287
00:16:34,085 --> 00:16:34,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of stuff for next week.

288
00:16:35,106 --> 00:16:36,307
[SPEAKER_03]: When do we get the WiiWare?

289
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:37,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that ever going to come out?

290
00:16:37,548 --> 00:16:39,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was supposed to come out this year.

291
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and when I get paid this week, I'm going to import Wii Fit.

292
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:44,352
[SPEAKER_03]: WeFit

293
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:11,074
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Janai talking about the Wii says, I noticed that Nintendo released a game on Virtual Console that Compile made, so maybe it's possible for Nintendo to release The Guardian Legend.

294
00:17:11,454 --> 00:17:12,374
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I only hope so.

295
00:17:12,395 --> 00:17:17,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Those who have been listening to Orange Lounge Radio for any length of time know that we have a very soft spot in our hearts for the 8-bit classic The Guardian Legend.

296
00:17:18,018 --> 00:17:21,580
[SPEAKER_04]: So the day that comes out on the Wii, I'm calling in sick to work.

297
00:17:23,641 --> 00:17:23,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

298
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:27,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Odd1 says, the damn system will tell you six ways from Sunday.

299
00:17:28,405 --> 00:17:35,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't kill people with your Wiimote and go out once in a while, you fat fuck, on every game, but they don't think to help us calibrate the things to play the game better.

300
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:39,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that new warning screen they have.

301
00:17:39,389 --> 00:17:41,290
[SPEAKER_03]: That thing looks like a fucking condom on there.

302
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:41,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

303
00:17:43,051 --> 00:17:45,431
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the ugliest thing.

304
00:17:45,551 --> 00:17:46,012
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

305
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:48,192
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm playing fucking dangerously, okay?

306
00:17:48,553 --> 00:17:52,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't use the wrist strap, and even if I did, I have the original wrist strap.

307
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:53,981
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

308
00:18:10,822 --> 00:18:14,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, oh, Dillinger's been playing a game I really want to play, Trauma Center New Blood.

309
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:15,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to go out and get that game.

310
00:18:16,005 --> 00:18:19,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes you do, so I can take it from you and play it.

311
00:18:19,427 --> 00:18:19,907
[SPEAKER_01]: No!

312
00:18:20,027 --> 00:18:20,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes!

313
00:18:20,588 --> 00:18:21,208
[SPEAKER_04]: My game!

314
00:18:21,248 --> 00:18:22,168
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't take my game!

315
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:23,169
[SPEAKER_01]: No, yeah, I can.

316
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:26,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to borrow something else on Wii, like Metroid or something?

317
00:18:26,411 --> 00:18:26,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

318
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:28,532
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not fucking Metroid.

319
00:18:29,113 --> 00:18:30,574
[SPEAKER_04]: You're sure it says Metroid on it?

320
00:18:30,654 --> 00:18:33,035
[SPEAKER_01]: It says old school Metroid, dammit!

321
00:18:33,455 --> 00:18:37,758
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to play no damn 3D Metroid, that blasphemous piece of crap.

322
00:18:38,704 --> 00:18:39,685
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Metroid's great.

323
00:18:39,805 --> 00:18:42,827
[SPEAKER_04]: AZHP says Trauma Center New Blood is the best game ever.

324
00:18:43,308 --> 00:18:43,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up!

325
00:18:44,188 --> 00:18:46,610
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's okay that you said that, but I want to play it.

326
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,511
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

327
00:18:48,932 --> 00:18:50,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's it for housekeeping.

328
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:57,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a lot else to add, so let's get into some... Oh, actually, one quick thing is that there's like a 90% chance next week, I know I've been saying this for a while now,

329
00:18:57,748 --> 00:19:02,050
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll finally be out in the actual studio for those keeping track.

330
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,611
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been in our temporary studio, quote unquote, for like the past three months.

331
00:19:06,171 --> 00:19:12,973
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm hoping next week, just due to some things that are going around in the personal life, we're going to try and get out there next week.

332
00:19:13,013 --> 00:19:15,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very excited about it, which is why I really want the cam to come back.

333
00:19:16,034 --> 00:19:21,857
[SPEAKER_04]: So if Op 11 is not back next week, we're probably going to look into either Justin TV or Ustream.

334
00:19:22,337 --> 00:19:23,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I really haven't.

335
00:19:24,352 --> 00:19:26,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Thought about what else is a good service.

336
00:19:26,434 --> 00:19:28,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I kind of liked how Op 11 had the episodic stuff.

337
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,257
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyhow, let's get into gaming news.

338
00:19:31,377 --> 00:19:31,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

339
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:41,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, the thing that everybody's been talking about this week is a certain GameStop editor was rumored to have been fired for a negative review over Kane and Lynch.

340
00:19:43,146 --> 00:19:50,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, the person responsible for this... God, I can't remember his name.

341
00:19:51,012 --> 00:19:52,233
[SPEAKER_03]: They just have his last name up here.

342
00:19:52,553 --> 00:19:52,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways...

343
00:19:54,605 --> 00:19:57,286
[SPEAKER_03]: and I don't even know how to pronounce that, Gerstmann, I guess?

344
00:19:57,827 --> 00:20:00,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say it was like a... It was Jeff, I think it was his first name.

345
00:20:00,568 --> 00:20:01,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff Gerstmann, yes.

346
00:20:02,229 --> 00:20:23,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so the rumor is, because no one's coming out to say otherwise, the rumor is because of his negative review on Kane and Lynch, Eidos threatened to pull the ad support, because they have the whole fucking site skinned like Kane and Lynch, and because of that, since the ads pay their salaries, basically,

347
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:28,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Rather than lose them as an ad supporter, they fired him instead.

348
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:37,292
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody is just up in arms because now people have finally figured out, hey, guess what?

349
00:20:37,332 --> 00:20:45,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe contributions from publishers and stuff affect scores of games.

350
00:20:45,498 --> 00:20:45,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

351
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:47,039
[SPEAKER_03]: You think?

352
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,661
[SPEAKER_03]: You're kidding.

353
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, welcome to the real world, folks.

354
00:20:52,244 --> 00:20:53,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so yeah, tons of stuff.

355
00:20:54,491 --> 00:20:56,092
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

356
00:21:13,218 --> 00:21:14,919
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy is... Okay, I'll lie.

357
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:18,081
[SPEAKER_04]: I've totally known about this guy and followed his career for a long, long time.

358
00:21:18,481 --> 00:21:19,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a good lie?

359
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:19,622
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

360
00:21:19,662 --> 00:21:20,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here's the truth.

361
00:21:21,324 --> 00:21:25,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no idea who the hell this guy was until I read this article on the internet.

362
00:21:25,186 --> 00:21:39,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, he's been some respected game journalist for the past 10 years, but honestly, I don't read a lot of corporate sites, so I don't... There's a lot of independent blogs I read, and maybe some of them are somewhat corporate, because I read Joystick, they're AOL...

363
00:21:39,757 --> 00:22:08,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Kotaku is whatever but I don't really read a lot of the big box sites very often I used to read one up maybe like three years ago I don't really read them a lot anymore either so I had no idea who the hell this guy was nevertheless I can't help but think so I'm trying to look at this like objectively as possible because I can't help but think and this may not be the popular opinion but I actually think there's a bit of mob mentality going on here I don't I think that the gaming scene is jumping to like a lot of conclusions with this stuff when

364
00:22:09,091 --> 00:22:13,152
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of people that really can't talk about what's going on in this situation.

365
00:22:13,212 --> 00:22:18,553
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there's been quite a bit of jumping to conclusions and things that have probably gotten blown out of proportions.

366
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:24,755
[SPEAKER_04]: The interesting thing about it, I mean, honestly, these companies involved are kind of screwed because of it.

367
00:22:25,255 --> 00:22:27,136
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of alarming.

368
00:22:27,176 --> 00:22:35,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if anything, from this, what we're learning is that the video game scene can be very sensationalist sometimes.

369
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:39,131
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't the first time this stuff's happened.

370
00:22:39,231 --> 00:22:40,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really, no.

371
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:47,312
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, people give him crap anyways because he had that non-10 review on Twilight Princess.

372
00:22:47,892 --> 00:22:51,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, if I were to review Twilight Princess, it wouldn't fucking get a 10, okay?

373
00:22:51,873 --> 00:22:55,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, that game is not God's gift to fucking gaming.

374
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:57,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, it's just a fucking Zelda game.

375
00:22:57,614 --> 00:23:02,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like Phantom Hourglass is a fucking Zelda game, they're good, but they're never great, okay?

376
00:23:03,276 --> 00:23:04,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I digress, but whatever.

377
00:23:04,937 --> 00:23:05,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

378
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:06,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's allowed to have their own opinion.

379
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:11,982
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, you know, everybody was fucking, like, giving Zelda a fucking blowjob or some shit like that.

380
00:23:12,423 --> 00:23:14,084
[SPEAKER_03]: It is goddamn just a game.

381
00:23:14,764 --> 00:23:15,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

382
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it kind of deserved at least a handjob.

383
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:18,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was a really good game.

384
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:19,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely, yeah.

385
00:23:19,888 --> 00:23:22,289
[SPEAKER_03]: It was not that great of a game, seriously.

386
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Wind Waker is a better game.

387
00:23:24,391 --> 00:23:26,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, that's crossing the line.

388
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:27,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa, wow, yeah, no, you did not just go there.

389
00:23:28,794 --> 00:23:29,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Ouch.

390
00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:29,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Back on topic.

391
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:30,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

392
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, does anyone remember Driver 3?

393
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:38,194
[SPEAKER_03]: How the whole story came out that Atari was paying for good reviews on that game?

394
00:23:38,474 --> 00:23:39,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this isn't the first time.

395
00:23:39,895 --> 00:23:41,555
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't the last time this is going to happen.

396
00:23:41,816 --> 00:23:45,017
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's happened hundreds of times between those.

397
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:48,058
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm not surprised.

398
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:52,300
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just people are finally figuring it out that this is going on behind the scenes.

399
00:23:53,573 --> 00:23:57,475
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest, people don't really know why this guy was let go.

400
00:23:57,555 --> 00:23:58,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, think about it.

401
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:02,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Just hypothetically, the company, and again, I don't know shit about what's going on in this situation.

402
00:24:02,917 --> 00:24:05,058
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to pretend like I know what's going on in this situation.

403
00:24:05,098 --> 00:24:07,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I just know what I'm reading out there on the internet, what people are saying.

404
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:14,783
[SPEAKER_04]: And hypothetically, in the corporate world, they could have fired this guy because he was late to work too many times.

405
00:24:14,883 --> 00:24:15,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

406
00:24:15,783 --> 00:24:16,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

407
00:24:16,203 --> 00:24:18,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, does it confirm that he was fired?

408
00:24:19,245 --> 00:24:19,985
[SPEAKER_01]: He did not quit?

409
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:24,542
[SPEAKER_04]: He was basically locked out of his office.

410
00:24:26,443 --> 00:24:35,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, that's all talk, but you feel like there is some validity to that because obviously employees of the company are stepping forward anonymously and saying these things.

411
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:36,970
[SPEAKER_04]: He was fired.

412
00:24:38,031 --> 00:24:39,192
[SPEAKER_04]: He'd been at the company for like 10 years.

413
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:48,089
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyhow, you know, I've seen people in the corporate world work at a company for like 10, 15 years and get fired over a really bad thing or whatever goes on.

414
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:48,649
[SPEAKER_04]: So who knows?

415
00:24:48,969 --> 00:24:52,550
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy could have been like late to work for an entire month or something.

416
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I'm being very hypothetical.

417
00:24:54,851 --> 00:24:58,992
[SPEAKER_04]: And the company could fire him, but the company can't say why they fired him.

418
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:04,692
[SPEAKER_04]: and if he gets fired over something like that, is he going to say, oh yeah, they fired me because I was late to work too many times?

419
00:25:05,593 --> 00:25:07,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is he going to let people draw their own conclusions?

420
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:15,080
[SPEAKER_03]: He probably also can't... Well, I'm not even really saying that... I think he can't actually say why he was fired.

421
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he has to sign something when he's leaving.

422
00:25:18,222 --> 00:25:22,966
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why, you know, you're not allowed to say... Okay, so he has to sign something or what?

423
00:25:24,327 --> 00:25:27,870
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably actually something he signed when he was... Confidentiality agreements he signed when he...

424
00:25:29,358 --> 00:25:31,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sign this.

425
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:34,121
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't tell anyone why you're fired if we fire you.

426
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:35,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's just...

427
00:25:54,258 --> 00:25:54,998
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

428
00:26:09,053 --> 00:26:17,820
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted to change wording in the review to make it more accurate as to whatever the changes were between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 were.

429
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,182
[SPEAKER_04]: And he didn't want to do that.

430
00:26:20,862 --> 00:26:25,566
[SPEAKER_04]: And he got let go for being somewhat of a difficult person on this and other issues in the past.

431
00:26:26,226 --> 00:26:32,671
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, you know, because the wording got changed, the internet changed that into, you know, the great game of internet telephone, blah blah

432
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,847
[SPEAKER_04]: That got changed into, oh my gosh, he refused to change the article to give it a good score, so Eidos made them fire him.

433
00:26:40,288 --> 00:26:44,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so why didn't they just not publish the review?

434
00:26:44,372 --> 00:26:48,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Why didn't they just say, hey, okay, well, this is not in line with what we're looking for?

435
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:50,619
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to publish it.

436
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,562
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know he could just as easily go to his own personal blog and post it or whatever, but that's his own personal blog.

437
00:26:56,602 --> 00:26:57,423
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have jurisdiction.

438
00:26:57,443 --> 00:27:02,025
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is, though, is they use a lot of these reviews as advertising for their game as well.

439
00:27:02,065 --> 00:27:07,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's why you see on boxes, you know, GameSpot gave it a 5 out of 5 or 10 out of 10 or whatever.

440
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:10,809
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they use that shit in the fucking commercials.

441
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:15,191
[SPEAKER_03]: They use it in, you know, their press advertisements and all that stuff.

442
00:27:16,311 --> 00:27:17,752
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big deal for them if...

443
00:27:18,701 --> 00:27:31,494
[SPEAKER_03]: They're paying GameSpot a million dollars for advertising or something like that and then all of a sudden they get a shitty ass review out of it and it causes people not to buy the game.

444
00:27:31,814 --> 00:27:37,480
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going to incentivize them to give them more money when they can give it to some other site that's going to give it a more favorable review?

445
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but if they don't publish it...

446
00:27:40,211 --> 00:27:45,313
[SPEAKER_01]: From that particular journalist, can't they just get one of their other journalists to publish a positive review?

447
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:54,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but then it's going to come out that this guy had wrote a review on it, and then all of a sudden, oh, wait a second, they didn't print it because this one's more favorable.

448
00:27:54,457 --> 00:27:56,298
[SPEAKER_03]: It would come out one way or another.

449
00:27:57,518 --> 00:28:01,740
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think that's a little far to be going, like, oh, we're going to fire you because you gave a bad review.

450
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:06,862
[SPEAKER_03]: And also because they have deadlines when these reviews need to get out there, and they may not have time to

451
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:08,305
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com.

452
00:28:39,535 --> 00:28:42,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Raven's Dolphin says, I heard he got fired of the video review.

453
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:44,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe, but again, this is all hearsay.

454
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:50,305
[SPEAKER_04]: GZDr4ev says, people canceled their GameSpot accounts.

455
00:28:50,325 --> 00:28:52,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, people are leaving the site in mass over this whole thing.

456
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:58,112
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, I partially blame mob mentality for why that's happening because people don't really know what's going on yet.

457
00:28:58,432 --> 00:29:01,515
[SPEAKER_04]: But people are making up stories that sure seem to make a lot of sense.

458
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:06,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Frisbee says, but if the game sucks, then the players will get the truth out there.

459
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:06,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

460
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I think just goes to show the lesson learned here.

461
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:17,922
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are getting all your gaming news and reviews from one person on one corporate gaming site, you might need to take off the blinders.

462
00:29:20,363 --> 00:29:24,504
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking for accurate reviews on stuff, don't rely on one website.

463
00:29:24,524 --> 00:29:26,444
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go to websites like Metacritic.

464
00:29:27,385 --> 00:29:32,746
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got a compilation of scores from all sorts of sites and stuff.

465
00:29:33,086 --> 00:29:36,467
[SPEAKER_03]: And that'll give you a good baseline of what the game is.

466
00:29:36,867 --> 00:29:40,308
[SPEAKER_03]: And also you can read each review and see what it is.

467
00:29:40,628 --> 00:29:41,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a minute.

468
00:29:41,428 --> 00:29:44,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Did Metacritic pay you money for that, Loki?

469
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:45,849
[SPEAKER_01]: For that endorsement?

470
00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:49,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I just happened to use that site because it compiles reviews.

471
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:50,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

472
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:50,750
[SPEAKER_03]: FIRED!

473
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,750
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get paid for shit, okay?

474
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

475
00:29:56,231 --> 00:29:56,931
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're right about that.

476
00:29:57,683 --> 00:30:07,490
[SPEAKER_03]: The truth be told, we actually, because at work we sell Kane and Lynch and stuff, and Kane and Lynch is one of those titles that was kind of a what we call select title.

477
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:11,253
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a title we push because we're getting paid money to push the title a little bit.

478
00:30:11,973 --> 00:30:20,219
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is, though, Eidos set our goal so high it was impossible to hit anyways, so that it wouldn't have to pay out any money to us.

479
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,262
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because the people that make these deals are fucking retarded or something.

480
00:30:24,702 --> 00:30:25,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways...

481
00:30:26,538 --> 00:30:29,720
[SPEAKER_03]: IDOS was really pushing to make this game big.

482
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing it in little ways I probably wouldn't.

483
00:30:33,502 --> 00:30:35,103
[SPEAKER_03]: They're advertising and marketing people.

484
00:30:35,823 --> 00:30:40,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Little creative ways like teaming up with Playboy, for example, to do that model search.

485
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:45,768
[SPEAKER_03]: They had interviews with the fake characters in the game in Playboy.

486
00:30:46,448 --> 00:30:48,990
[SPEAKER_04]: They did reach out to the independent media.

487
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,751
[SPEAKER_04]: They flew a bunch of them out there to San Francisco to go.

488
00:30:52,355 --> 00:30:55,879
[SPEAKER_04]: We weren't invited, and we could just drive there, but that's okay, we're not bitter.

489
00:30:55,939 --> 00:31:01,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, sure, you know, because we drive there, you know, that's why they don't invite us or stuff.

490
00:31:01,906 --> 00:31:02,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Bastards.

491
00:31:02,767 --> 00:31:04,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, you know, and...

492
00:31:05,205 --> 00:31:10,666
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also think there's definitely a certain type of audience I think this show caters to.

493
00:31:10,706 --> 00:31:20,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, granted, I think we have people from all walks of gaming that listen to this program, but I think people know that we are mostly the one you want to hear for the music, the RPGs.

494
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:24,950
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a certain niche that Kane and Lynch doesn't fit into, I think.

495
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,750
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying Kane and Lynch is a bad game.

496
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,871
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably could have been a good game.

497
00:31:28,311 --> 00:31:28,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never played it.

498
00:31:29,031 --> 00:31:29,351
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

499
00:31:29,371 --> 00:31:33,532
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played it either, but just from what I've ever been reading and the way it looks...

500
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:42,134
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, this game's kind of fallen into the same problem that Blacksite Area 51 and some of these other games have gotten in.

501
00:31:42,254 --> 00:31:45,435
[SPEAKER_03]: They're rushed to make it out for Christmas.

502
00:31:45,895 --> 00:31:52,858
[SPEAKER_03]: And this year, I think also next year, you're going to see a lot of these games that are going to be spread out throughout the year instead of all in November.

503
00:31:53,018 --> 00:31:54,659
[SPEAKER_03]: And that might help some of these games.

504
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Because like Army of Two, for example, that one was going to be released in...

505
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:04,152
[SPEAKER_03]: November as well, along with Kane Lynch and all this other stuff.

506
00:32:04,412 --> 00:32:05,253
[SPEAKER_03]: But it wasn't done yet.

507
00:32:05,473 --> 00:32:11,858
[SPEAKER_03]: And so instead of releasing it, they're putting more time into polishing it and making sure that it's a good game before they release it.

508
00:32:12,219 --> 00:32:13,540
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now it's coming out later on.

509
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,762
[SPEAKER_03]: It missed the holiday thing, but it's going to be a better game.

510
00:32:16,922 --> 00:32:22,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with Grand Theft Auto 4, Metal Gear Solid 4, stuff like that.

511
00:32:23,528 --> 00:32:31,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Take the extra time and make the game good, and then that way you will get a better score for it instead of rushing this piece of shit out and then having to be broken.

512
00:32:33,784 --> 00:32:37,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the other thing that kind of makes me think there's more than meets the eye with this whole thing.

513
00:32:37,966 --> 00:32:40,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Is a 6 out of 10 a bad review?

514
00:32:41,228 --> 00:32:45,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I realize the way the scale has been kind of skewed over the years by many people, I guess yes.

515
00:32:46,251 --> 00:32:50,634
[SPEAKER_04]: But I always thought a 5 was average, like right in the middle, you're average.

516
00:32:50,674 --> 00:32:51,614
[SPEAKER_04]: So a 5 is average.

517
00:32:51,634 --> 00:32:57,038
[SPEAKER_04]: So technically a score of 6 is a slightly above average game, right?

518
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:57,758
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

519
00:32:57,778 --> 00:32:57,858
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

520
00:32:58,163 --> 00:33:01,785
[SPEAKER_03]: and it wouldn't be that bad if it were in a month that was a bit slower with games.

521
00:33:01,845 --> 00:33:11,192
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is November where you have 60 billion releases coming out and a sixth game may not be played by as many people as say... But here's what you need to do, though.

522
00:33:11,512 --> 00:33:19,297
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're unsure if the game's going to be good... I'm also just trying to take a jab at the fact that most games in this day and age are rated on a scale of 5 to 10, not a scale of 1 to 10.

523
00:33:19,337 --> 00:33:19,957
[SPEAKER_04]: 7 to 10.

524
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:25,921
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but seriously, though, if you're unsure the game's going to be good, rent it.

525
00:33:26,582 --> 00:33:26,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

526
00:33:27,461 --> 00:33:32,204
[SPEAKER_03]: rent it from Gamefly, rent it from your local Blockbuster, Hollywood, whoever.

527
00:33:33,425 --> 00:33:34,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Rent it and see if it's any good.

528
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:37,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Shadowslyer wants to give insight on that.

529
00:33:37,628 --> 00:33:40,610
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, on the GameSpot scale, a 6.0 is fair.

530
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:43,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair is not a bad word.

531
00:33:43,352 --> 00:33:44,353
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a good word either.

532
00:33:44,413 --> 00:33:45,694
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a fair word.

533
00:33:46,454 --> 00:33:48,916
[SPEAKER_04]: There really is no better description.

534
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:57,949
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I don't even really like scale-based reviews in the first place, because then you just put all your trust, you're like, having them make the decision for you.

535
00:33:58,209 --> 00:34:01,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Loki said, just rent the game if you're so unsure about it.

536
00:34:01,413 --> 00:34:07,239
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if it catches your eye in the first place, read the review, then go rent it, but if not, then I wouldn't even worry about it.

537
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:07,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Like,

538
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:08,620
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

539
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:38,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, god, it's not like this was reviewed by a panel of, like, scientists or something like that, you know, where they had, you know, thousands of people playing this game, and this is the score they came up with.

540
00:34:38,563 --> 00:34:55,411
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one dude, whether he likes the game or not, he may just hate Eidos or something, they may have rubbed him the wrong way before, and now he's embittered, and now it's a six or something, because they fucking pissed him off, or like, you know, if I reviewed Madden or something like that, I don't like fucking football games, one, or something like that.

541
00:34:55,451 --> 00:34:56,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's the kind of

542
00:34:56,732 --> 00:35:01,935
[SPEAKER_03]: You're supposed to be unbiased when you're playing this stuff, but, you know, it's... I'm actually kind of curious.

543
00:35:01,955 --> 00:35:14,742
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about the fact that, you know, after all this, the competitors down the street at 1UP did this little protest or something on their lunch, this whole, like, kind of, you know, having the signs, Free Jeff, and whatever all that stuff was.

544
00:35:14,762 --> 00:35:15,402
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of that?

545
00:35:15,522 --> 00:35:16,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I certainly have an opinion on it.

546
00:35:17,665 --> 00:35:18,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

547
00:35:35,695 --> 00:35:36,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

548
00:35:51,278 --> 00:35:53,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Praise us for doing some good.

549
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:54,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck that.

550
00:35:55,340 --> 00:36:00,842
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, other people, if they noticed it or something like that and posted it in their fucking Flickr blogs, then it would be good.

551
00:36:00,902 --> 00:36:04,123
[SPEAKER_03]: But the fact that they're promoting themselves, look at what we did.

552
00:36:04,143 --> 00:36:05,104
[SPEAKER_03]: We're so awesome.

553
00:36:05,304 --> 00:36:05,904
[SPEAKER_03]: No, fuck that.

554
00:36:05,924 --> 00:36:06,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

555
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:10,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we're going to get some angry emails this week.

556
00:36:10,267 --> 00:36:13,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeHunter.com Here's the thing.

557
00:36:13,448 --> 00:36:16,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the motivation is, whatever.

558
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:17,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to pretend to know.

559
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:26,453
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do think it was a little premature because, again, I find that a little strange that they would jump in on that mob mentality when none of us truly know what's going on.

560
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:29,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Shouldn't they have waited until more news came out?

561
00:36:29,634 --> 00:36:31,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, these guys do represent a corporation.

562
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:35,716
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's my only, like, I don't know if that was smart type of thing.

563
00:36:36,141 --> 00:36:39,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, so it was a bunch of employees from 1UP?

564
00:36:39,584 --> 00:36:42,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the reviewers and critics over there.

565
00:36:42,687 --> 00:36:43,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Zip Davis or whatever.

566
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:46,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, something like that.

567
00:36:46,231 --> 00:36:49,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can't control what somebody, that's right, they can do whatever the hell they want.

568
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:53,398
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the thing though, what were they protesting?

569
00:36:53,438 --> 00:36:57,101
[SPEAKER_03]: That they support independent reviews or unbiased reviews or something like that?

570
00:36:57,502 --> 00:37:00,645
[SPEAKER_03]: So what they're basically saying is that they support that so that

571
00:37:01,723 --> 00:37:03,484
[SPEAKER_03]: OneUp has unbiased reviews.

572
00:37:03,564 --> 00:37:05,905
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the impression that you're supposed to get from that.

573
00:37:06,005 --> 00:37:09,266
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just fucking advertising for themselves is all it is.

574
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,567
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sorry, I don't see it as very genuine at all.

575
00:37:12,727 --> 00:37:20,370
[SPEAKER_03]: All I see that is is, hey, some manager came up with an idea to have them go out during their lunch break and fucking protest in front of them.

576
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:26,012
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't believe this shit that they're such a tight-knit group or whatever that they would do that kind of crap.

577
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:28,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, hold on.

578
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:31,241
[SPEAKER_04]: The few times we have been to these media events and things like that,

579
00:37:32,023 --> 00:37:33,344
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always the same fucking people.

580
00:37:33,964 --> 00:37:37,265
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think in some regard they are somewhat of a family.

581
00:37:37,445 --> 00:37:39,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's say that they're a tight-knit group.

582
00:37:39,706 --> 00:37:48,950
[SPEAKER_03]: If I fucking got fired, say that we were corporate or whatever, and I got fired because I wrote a bad review on Kane and Lynch, would fucking one-up be on my lawn protesting for that shit?

583
00:37:49,211 --> 00:37:54,953
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they would be there twiddling their thumbs in their office going, those fuckers that like DDR serves them right.

584
00:37:55,313 --> 00:37:57,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously, that's the shit that would happen.

585
00:37:57,854 --> 00:38:01,196
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not fucking advertising or anything like that.

586
00:38:01,909 --> 00:38:05,171
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just... I'm sorry.

587
00:38:05,311 --> 00:38:07,192
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that and I'm like, oh, come on.

588
00:38:07,672 --> 00:38:08,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

589
00:38:08,393 --> 00:38:10,094
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I read it on every single blog.

590
00:38:10,134 --> 00:38:10,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the same thing.

591
00:38:10,814 --> 00:38:11,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good one up.

592
00:38:11,815 --> 00:38:12,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Go them.

593
00:38:12,495 --> 00:38:13,856
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, fuck that shit.

594
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:16,197
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going there less now because of this.

595
00:38:16,557 --> 00:38:17,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Going there less now.

596
00:38:18,638 --> 00:38:19,679
[SPEAKER_01]: 25% less because of that.

597
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:25,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's see their... I bet you that fucking protest shit's in their goddamn EGM, too.

598
00:38:25,162 --> 00:38:26,583
[SPEAKER_03]: How much you want to bet that shit is?

599
00:38:27,165 --> 00:38:31,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they're so independent and awesome and unbiased.

600
00:38:31,288 --> 00:38:32,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's put it in our magazine, too.

601
00:38:32,508 --> 00:38:33,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Look how holy we are.

602
00:38:33,689 --> 00:38:35,650
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I just realized I have Tuesday off work.

603
00:38:36,691 --> 00:38:40,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I should go down there with a sign that says, Thank you for firing him.

604
00:38:41,914 --> 00:38:43,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio.

605
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:46,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Those fuckers who like DDR.

606
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:47,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to see what happens.

607
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:48,198
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

608
00:38:48,218 --> 00:38:49,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I have better things to do on Tuesday.

609
00:38:50,143 --> 00:38:50,863
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you don't.

610
00:38:50,983 --> 00:38:52,684
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm going to see the Spice Girls.

611
00:38:52,704 --> 00:38:54,085
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you talking about?

612
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I have much better things to do on Tuesday.

613
00:38:56,026 --> 00:38:56,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

614
00:38:56,406 --> 00:38:57,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's just, you know.

615
00:38:58,547 --> 00:39:01,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the fact of the matter is, okay, we don't know why he was fired.

616
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,869
[SPEAKER_03]: We assume it's because of this.

617
00:39:03,329 --> 00:39:04,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is going on in the industry.

618
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Big whoop.

619
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:06,971
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, other things go on in the industry, too.

620
00:39:07,051 --> 00:39:13,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't know, certain media outlets getting to break street on certain news stories and stuff like that.

621
00:39:14,075 --> 00:39:15,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Or no such embargo for them.

622
00:39:16,176 --> 00:39:16,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, they...

623
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Make a lot of money in advertising, that kind of thing.

624
00:39:19,435 --> 00:39:20,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that kind of stuff happens as well.

625
00:39:21,156 --> 00:39:27,657
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a whole lot of shit you don't see that happens behind the scene day to day, but we all deal with it, and guess what?

626
00:39:27,717 --> 00:39:30,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Things aren't going to change, so get over it.

627
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:33,998
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, in a month, who's going to be fucking talking about this?

628
00:39:34,018 --> 00:39:34,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's going to give a shit?

629
00:39:34,978 --> 00:39:39,039
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want genuine reviews, ask someone that's actually played a damn game, your friends.

630
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:40,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Irene, I don't know.

631
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:44,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think there is going to be some type of long-lasting effect this whole thing has.

632
00:39:44,921 --> 00:39:53,087
[SPEAKER_04]: because I think people are going to, I think companies are going to watch what happens to the whole rah, rah, rah, my mentality, we hate you GameSpot type thing that goes on.

633
00:39:53,628 --> 00:40:00,153
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there's going to be a lot of, you're going to see, I think the big sites post about their integrity.

634
00:40:00,193 --> 00:40:06,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I think you're going to see the competitors like 1UP and IGM make things about their integrity and their reviews and their corporate policies.

635
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:07,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, wait a minute.

636
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:12,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's refer it back to an old situation that concerned, you know,

637
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:18,699
[SPEAKER_01]: and mishandling or mistreatment of employees at a gaming establishment.

638
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:20,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, look at, what was it, the EA spouse?

639
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,181
[SPEAKER_01]: How long did we talk about that?

640
00:40:24,002 --> 00:40:27,743
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the EA spouse that was like, oh, my husband's working too long or whatever.

641
00:40:28,484 --> 00:40:29,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Lasted about a month.

642
00:40:29,544 --> 00:40:35,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they raised issues of like, you know, oh, you know, look at them, they're evil and blah, blah, blah.

643
00:40:35,327 --> 00:40:37,409
[SPEAKER_01]: But people still go and work for them.

644
00:40:37,549 --> 00:40:38,969
[SPEAKER_01]: People still buy their games.

645
00:40:39,249 --> 00:40:40,130
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's really like,

646
00:40:40,743 --> 00:40:42,444
[SPEAKER_01]: EA did not go under as a company.

647
00:40:42,564 --> 00:40:44,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, no one gives a shit anymore.

648
00:40:44,165 --> 00:40:45,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they put a hit on her?

649
00:40:45,846 --> 00:40:46,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean... I don't know.

650
00:40:47,787 --> 00:40:49,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Because nobody talks about it anymore.

651
00:40:49,268 --> 00:40:49,969
[SPEAKER_01]: How the fuck do I know?

652
00:40:50,029 --> 00:40:52,110
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think I remember seeing... No, I'm just teasing, obviously.

653
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:55,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I remember seeing a story like a year ago, like she was unmasked.

654
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,513
[SPEAKER_04]: And we found out who she really was and all that stuff.

655
00:40:58,014 --> 00:40:59,255
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll start writing reviews.

656
00:40:59,515 --> 00:41:01,116
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the companies can start paying me.

657
00:41:01,316 --> 00:41:02,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I need money.

658
00:41:03,517 --> 00:41:04,438
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but seriously, though.

659
00:41:04,518 --> 00:41:07,219
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if I had the free time, I'd write reviews.

660
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,500
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't have the fucking free time.

661
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to work.

662
00:41:09,481 --> 00:41:09,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

663
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,302
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I have a wife that I want to go home and a cat that wants me to play with it.

664
00:41:13,422 --> 00:41:16,425
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I have to do these things.

665
00:41:16,445 --> 00:41:19,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want me to put a head out on your cat?

666
00:41:21,068 --> 00:41:21,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe my wife.

667
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:23,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

668
00:41:24,911 --> 00:41:26,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that was mean.

669
00:41:26,552 --> 00:41:27,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Dang.

670
00:41:28,393 --> 00:41:28,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Ow.

671
00:41:29,374 --> 00:41:29,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, snap.

672
00:41:29,794 --> 00:41:32,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that Freudian or was that intentional?

673
00:41:32,116 --> 00:41:33,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Views and opinions expressed on this program.

674
00:41:34,818 --> 00:41:35,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

675
00:41:35,818 --> 00:41:37,680
[SPEAKER_04]: The chat room's been lighting up and I've been ignoring them.

676
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, guys.

677
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:41,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Odd1 says, I don't know, did I already read this one?

678
00:41:41,734 --> 00:41:42,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I did.

679
00:41:43,015 --> 00:41:47,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the developers give the gaming press more credit than they're worth, especially in the face of the internet.

680
00:41:47,737 --> 00:41:49,658
[SPEAKER_04]: The word gets out, we have our ears to the ground.

681
00:41:49,738 --> 00:41:55,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you can get exclusive news from the corporate sites, but the message boards, podcasts, and indie sites are where it's at.

682
00:41:55,562 --> 00:41:59,164
[SPEAKER_04]: If Eidos was stupid enough to push this, seriously, I'd love to see them burn.

683
00:42:00,424 --> 00:42:03,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a feeling, actually, I have kind of a strange feeling that

684
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:04,840
[SPEAKER_04]: IDOS has nothing to do with this.

685
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:12,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I think maybe they were like, they were probably a little pissed, and they probably let GameSpot know that, but, you know, they also probably kind of realized that there wasn't a lot they could do about it.

686
00:42:13,465 --> 00:42:14,345
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

687
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:18,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a feeling if anybody's probably getting a bad rap over this, it's actually probably them.

688
00:42:18,448 --> 00:42:18,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

689
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:21,410
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of what my gut tells me about this whole mom mentality thing.

690
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:22,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't think they had much to do with it.

691
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,132
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they can directly, say, fire this person.

692
00:42:25,652 --> 00:42:30,255
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if it was EA, maybe, you know, maybe, but, I mean, we're talking IDOS here.

693
00:42:30,275 --> 00:42:31,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what, Tomb Raider, Hitman?

694
00:42:33,052 --> 00:42:34,813
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

695
00:42:35,074 --> 00:42:40,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Gerardimo says, Dear world, go get your own opinion and decide if the game is good or not yourself.

696
00:42:40,998 --> 00:42:43,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Macman says, I like the idea from all games interactive.

697
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Sound effect reviews.

698
00:42:45,061 --> 00:42:47,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this game is audience laughter out of Mario Jump.

699
00:42:50,366 --> 00:42:50,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Brilliant.

700
00:42:52,247 --> 00:42:52,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

701
00:42:53,468 --> 00:42:58,432
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw in response to the 1UP protest says, Maybe it's a sign that 1UP would like Gertzman to work for them.

702
00:42:59,482 --> 00:42:59,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

703
00:43:00,622 --> 00:43:02,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Odd1 says, Ziff is all about the publicity.

704
00:43:02,383 --> 00:43:03,843
[SPEAKER_04]: They're good with Flickr and all that shit.

705
00:43:03,863 --> 00:43:06,344
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not surprised they videotape almost everything they do.

706
00:43:07,104 --> 00:43:07,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

707
00:43:09,185 --> 00:43:10,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

708
00:43:10,065 --> 00:43:14,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't see Eidos pressuring them to fire this guy.

709
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:22,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, EA or something, like if they gave Madden a really shitty score or something like that, because they're a big company and have a lot of money to throw around, but...

710
00:43:24,699 --> 00:43:25,860
[SPEAKER_03]: IDOS, I mean, what?

711
00:43:26,221 --> 00:43:27,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Would they have come out recently?

712
00:43:28,062 --> 00:43:29,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomb Raider Anniversary Edition?

713
00:43:29,984 --> 00:43:33,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean... Alright, well, we've spent a lot of time talking about this topic.

714
00:43:33,228 --> 00:43:38,453
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to move on to some other news, but I'm sure we'll hear a lot about this on the Skype line later.

715
00:43:38,793 --> 00:43:42,697
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, there always is our mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

716
00:43:43,418 --> 00:43:47,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, more news, and let's talk about the virtual console on the Wii.

717
00:43:47,182 --> 00:43:48,443
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start off with some Wii news tonight.

718
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:50,427
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great news.

719
00:43:50,507 --> 00:43:55,091
[SPEAKER_04]: This makes me think Nintendo finally gets it, what we really want, in a way.

720
00:43:55,951 --> 00:44:01,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Pokemon Snap is coming out on the Wii's virtual console in Japan, and usually this would be no big deal.

721
00:44:01,936 --> 00:44:10,562
[SPEAKER_04]: However, the pictures that you take inside the game, you can now post to your Wii message board and send around on the address book.

722
00:44:10,983 --> 00:44:17,348
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you've taken a picture of Pikachu doing a little dance or something, and you think it's really cute, I could send that over to

723
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:21,879
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you won't.

724
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:23,000
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just delete it.

725
00:44:23,461 --> 00:44:25,363
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll defriend you, if that's possible.

726
00:44:25,936 --> 00:44:31,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I think a lot of us have been shouting from the mountaintops for years, well, at least years, since the Wii came out.

727
00:44:32,279 --> 00:44:39,223
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to see additional functionality in the virtual console games, like online play and things like this.

728
00:44:39,703 --> 00:44:44,245
[SPEAKER_04]: So the fact that they've done this for Pokemon Snap shows that it's possible, right?

729
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did they have to do it with Pokemon Snap?

730
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:46,926
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn it.

731
00:44:46,966 --> 00:44:48,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Why couldn't they pick a better game to do it with?

732
00:44:49,267 --> 00:44:51,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, nobody gives a shit about taking pictures of stupid Pokemon.

733
00:44:52,709 --> 00:44:54,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I love Pokemon Snap.

734
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:54,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

735
00:44:55,154 --> 00:44:56,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, it's stupid.

736
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,835
[SPEAKER_01]: You're stupid.

737
00:44:58,335 --> 00:44:58,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

738
00:44:59,475 --> 00:45:04,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Odd1 says, Message board posts of Pokemon in near sexual positions up 500%.

739
00:45:06,797 --> 00:45:09,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Pokemon Snap has now become Pokemon Slash.

740
00:45:09,318 --> 00:45:10,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, everybody.

741
00:45:12,479 --> 00:45:16,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, they're making a lot of money off of Pokemon Snap and other virtual console titles.

742
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:25,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo estimates that they've made $33 million on the Virtual Console alone, and that kind of includes 7.8 million downloads across the service.

743
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:27,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

744
00:45:28,735 --> 00:45:29,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of money.

745
00:45:30,376 --> 00:45:32,097
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's free money, essentially.

746
00:45:32,157 --> 00:45:35,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can't imagine the Virtual Console takes that much work.

747
00:45:35,598 --> 00:45:36,799
[SPEAKER_03]: All that bandwidth!

748
00:45:37,558 --> 00:45:51,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not just that, but obviously, you know, they kind of have rewritten all the manuals in the Wii, because, you know, the Wii thing has their own manuals and stuff, and I'm sure they still have to do QA on all the games and what have you, so it's not like they do it completely free, but it's certainly much cheaper than making a new game.

749
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:52,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

750
00:45:53,310 --> 00:46:01,236
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this is very, probably very high cost efficiency type thing, cost gains, whatever they call that in the business world.

751
00:46:01,256 --> 00:46:05,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, they sell each one of those consoles at, you know, profit, so.

752
00:46:05,908 --> 00:46:12,733
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, speaking of the Virtual Console, some more titles coming out have been spoiled by the one and only ESRB.

753
00:46:12,773 --> 00:46:23,221
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can expect in the near future Top Hunter for the Neo Geo, Puyo Puyo 2 for the Genesis, King of Fighters 94 on the Neo Geo, Baseball Stars 2, Bases Loaded on the NES.

754
00:46:23,261 --> 00:46:24,382
[SPEAKER_04]: That game was pretty awesome, actually.

755
00:46:24,702 --> 00:46:29,766
[SPEAKER_04]: The Dynastic Hero on the TurboGrafx-16 and Power Golf on the Neo Geo as well.

756
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:29,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

757
00:46:30,778 --> 00:46:33,501
[SPEAKER_04]: All must be making their way sometime in the near future.

758
00:46:33,962 --> 00:46:42,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Also just wanted to say really quickly that it's also been spoiled that on the Japanese Virtual Console they'll be getting Treasure Hunter G, which is a game I vaguely remember.

759
00:46:43,271 --> 00:46:46,373
[SPEAKER_01]: Why aren't they releasing better titles?

760
00:46:46,493 --> 00:46:47,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand.

761
00:46:47,794 --> 00:46:51,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Treasure Hunter G was actually a pretty awesome RPG 16-bit.

762
00:46:51,377 --> 00:46:53,759
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of reminisced in a Final Fantasy 6 a little bit.

763
00:46:53,779 --> 00:46:58,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it looks pretty cool, but I mean, the other games, like fucking Power Golf, who the hell played that?

764
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:02,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Bases Loaded, whatever, that's an okay game, I guess.

765
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:05,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Bases Loaded was kind of cool, but Baseball Stars was better.

766
00:47:06,853 --> 00:47:11,777
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't play any baseball games on the NES because I don't care about sports games.

767
00:47:11,857 --> 00:47:12,457
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's weird?

768
00:47:12,578 --> 00:47:18,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually I'm not into sports games either, but I liked, here's the thing, I liked sports games a lot when they were simple.

769
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,525
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I loved NBA Jam so much.

770
00:47:21,585 --> 00:47:28,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that game was relatively, I mean, that game was kind of made for, you know, dummies who can't really play basketball but enjoy to watch it, you know?

771
00:47:29,772 --> 00:47:31,013
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I liked NBA Jam.

772
00:47:31,714 --> 00:47:31,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

773
00:47:32,162 --> 00:47:33,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Gameplay footage, interviews, etc.

774
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:06,215
[SPEAKER_03]: BoxArt, release schedules for the DS and the Wii, and other fun stuff.

775
00:48:06,495 --> 00:48:10,338
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully soon, demos for Wii games as well.

776
00:48:10,919 --> 00:48:19,627
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now they've got some different Touch Generation title demos, and of course the Japanese versions of Pokemon Diamond and Pearl.

777
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:24,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this seems like a very natural thing that Nintendo probably should have had a while ago.

778
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:26,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Any word on when we might get this in the U.S.

779
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:26,940
[SPEAKER_04]: at all?

780
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck if I know, but this is something they were promising, what, before the Wii ever came out?

781
00:48:30,848 --> 00:48:31,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

782
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:32,420
[SPEAKER_04]: WeConnect24, come on!

783
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:56,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, you might be looking... No, I don't, because I have Wii Connect 24 turned off.

784
00:48:56,659 --> 00:49:03,886
[SPEAKER_04]: You're looking at your Wii at 5 o'clock at night, and you see the weather from midnight that morning, but... Wii Connect 24 doesn't like my mod chip.

785
00:49:06,028 --> 00:49:06,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Wows.

786
00:49:07,068 --> 00:49:07,389
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

787
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:09,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

788
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:12,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Macman says, Everybody's Nintendo channel in America.

789
00:49:12,914 --> 00:49:16,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Nintendo, kill the chibi motherfucking robo team and get to work on it!

790
00:49:19,175 --> 00:49:20,896
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an order from Macman in chat.

791
00:49:21,116 --> 00:49:22,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, stop making chibi robo games.

792
00:49:22,737 --> 00:49:23,178
[SPEAKER_04]: They suck.

793
00:49:23,198 --> 00:49:23,618
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

794
00:49:23,678 --> 00:49:24,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Just knock it off.

795
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,880
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not saying fire those guys.

796
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Just put them to work elsewhere.

797
00:49:29,022 --> 00:49:29,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

798
00:49:29,182 --> 00:49:30,122
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying fire those guys.

799
00:49:31,681 --> 00:49:38,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, you might have heard earlier in the show I mentioned that I was a fan of the game Eternal Sonata that came out a little earlier this year.

800
00:49:38,848 --> 00:49:42,992
[SPEAKER_04]: TriCrescendo was the folks that made this game.

801
00:49:43,773 --> 00:49:46,676
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're now working on a new game called Fragile.

802
00:49:47,056 --> 00:49:53,362
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a new RPG that's going to be coming out for the Nintendo Wii, which is a system that Eternal Sonata was not on.

803
00:49:53,442 --> 00:49:55,805
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on 360 and going to be coming on PS3.

804
00:49:56,545 --> 00:49:59,026
[SPEAKER_04]: but Fragile is going to be coming out on the Nintendo Wii.

805
00:49:59,706 --> 00:50:05,608
[SPEAKER_04]: All we know so far is that the main character is a guy named Set and you explore various cities.

806
00:50:05,688 --> 00:50:08,709
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes place in a post-apocalyptic world.

807
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:21,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the details at this time are in Japanese but there is an official website up at fragile.nomco-ch.net and there's also a little teaser trailer out there on the internet for the game.

808
00:50:22,567 --> 00:50:30,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure a lot of people are kind of excited about this because, you know, obviously the first generation of Wii games felt like ported PlayStation 2 games with motion control.

809
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:34,351
[SPEAKER_04]: So these type of game announcements get people excited for what the Wii can really do.

810
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:34,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

811
00:50:35,211 --> 00:50:46,894
[SPEAKER_03]: And that reminds me, there's another game that's going to be coming out here, Opuna, that came out in Japan, I believe, and it's coming out over here in like February, I want to say.

812
00:50:46,914 --> 00:50:49,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to check out the Japanese version next week, hopefully, too.

813
00:50:50,111 --> 00:51:19,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I don't really know how much I'm going to be able to play of those games Especially roleplaying games because they're all in Japanese And I speak no Japanese Or at least very little Japanese Anyways, the Nintendo DS in the UK has set some new sales records They have sold 191,000 units in the UK And that's more than any other hardware format has achieved in a 7 day period So that's a pretty good week for them I guess

814
00:51:21,466 --> 00:51:29,653
[SPEAKER_03]: The previous record was held by the PSP during its launch in September of 2005, where it sold 185,000 units.

815
00:51:32,776 --> 00:51:34,537
[SPEAKER_04]: How about we start looking at some release dates?

816
00:51:35,138 --> 00:51:41,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Travel the world and look at games that you can pick up in the UK right now, if you think another game should be selling a lot of units.

817
00:51:41,823 --> 00:51:48,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, first, before we get into release dates, one thing we promised a few weeks ago on the show is that we would be tracking sales numbers.

818
00:51:49,069 --> 00:51:52,670
[SPEAKER_04]: because we have ways of getting the MPD sales numbers.

819
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:57,852
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously one game you guys want to know the sales on is Eye of Judgment.

820
00:51:58,232 --> 00:51:59,412
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's because of the bet.

821
00:51:59,912 --> 00:52:07,974
[SPEAKER_04]: If you recall, a bet was made on this program that Eye of Judgment, as Loki said, would no way in hell sell a million copies within six months of release.

822
00:52:08,314 --> 00:52:17,497
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, if the game manages to sell one million copies in six months within its release, Loki has said he will dress up in a Tingle outfit and dance around

823
00:52:17,924 --> 00:52:22,788
[SPEAKER_04]: in the garage, setting an eye of judgment on fire while playing a game versus Bobby Blackwolf.

824
00:52:24,509 --> 00:52:25,150
[SPEAKER_04]: All on video.

825
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:28,392
[SPEAKER_04]: All on video for YouTube for years to come.

826
00:52:29,373 --> 00:52:33,817
[SPEAKER_04]: However, we have to get the game to sell a million units first, and we have an update on the numbers.

827
00:52:33,957 --> 00:52:36,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how many units are we there?

828
00:52:36,359 --> 00:52:36,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we there yet?

829
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at least in the US, we're up to 17,600 units.

830
00:52:42,724 --> 00:52:45,386
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will have you know, though, that's just from

831
00:52:46,005 --> 00:52:47,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Launch to December 3rd.

832
00:52:47,846 --> 00:52:49,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't gotten the new numbers yet.

833
00:52:49,226 --> 00:52:53,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, in the next couple weeks, I'll have new numbers for... So that's about within the first three weeks of release.

834
00:52:54,728 --> 00:52:55,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Like two or three, yeah.

835
00:52:55,549 --> 00:52:55,809
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

836
00:52:56,129 --> 00:52:58,830
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're 1.7% of the way there.

837
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:00,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.

838
00:53:01,251 --> 00:53:02,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Making good progress.

839
00:53:02,211 --> 00:53:03,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep at it, guys.

840
00:53:03,552 --> 00:53:04,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck to you.

841
00:53:06,853 --> 00:53:08,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at the chat room to see what's going on.

842
00:53:09,494 --> 00:53:11,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Dartetsuya says, that's it?

843
00:53:14,847 --> 00:53:16,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Desgaea makes his way to the PSP

844
00:53:44,047 --> 00:54:00,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragon Blade, Wrath of Fire comes out on the Wii Juiced 2 on the PC Link's Crossbow Training comes out on the Nintendo Wii Myst comes out on the DS I forgot that they were remaking the old Myst games on DS That's what this is, right?

845
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:03,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah That's pretty rad Is that out here in the US?

846
00:54:03,941 --> 00:54:05,523
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think on the DS, I know it's on PSP

847
00:54:06,696 --> 00:54:10,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Pokemon Battle Revolution finally comes out on the Wii over in Europe this week.

848
00:54:10,697 --> 00:54:14,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Pro Evo Soccer 2008 on the DS also this week on the 7th.

00:54:50,476 --> 00:54:54,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, she wouldn't because those are the Europe release dates and they have a different host over there, so I look stupid.

[SPEAKER_03]: in the US, Alvin and the Chipmunks coming out on PC, DS, Playstation 2 and I believe the Wii American Girl, Julie Finds A Way with I must say the most creepy cover for a game I have ever seen

879
00:57:50,305 --> 00:57:52,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what it says in the rules?

880
00:57:53,067 --> 00:57:53,628
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

881
00:57:53,668 --> 00:57:58,432
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something my friend told me when I was a kid, so it probably was made up just to make me look stupid.

882
00:57:59,233 --> 00:58:01,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's like, what the hell are you talking about, Rob?

883
00:58:01,655 --> 00:58:02,536
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't do that.

884
00:58:03,096 --> 00:58:05,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I believe that would be made up, Rob.

885
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, that's it.

886
00:58:10,629 --> 00:58:14,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Viva Piñata Party Animals, or as they call it, Atsumare Viva Piñata Let's Party

891
00:58:50,561 --> 00:59:00,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii, we have No More Heroes coming out on the 6th, as well as Rayman Raving Rabbids 2, or Rabbids Party Returns.

892
00:59:00,888 --> 00:59:04,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they really need to make a sequel to that shitty-ass game?

893
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:05,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, that game was awful.

894
00:59:05,791 --> 00:59:07,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I hear the second one is pretty good.

895
00:59:07,592 --> 00:59:08,032
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty fun.

896
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:10,631
[SPEAKER_04]: because they've taken over Earth.

897
00:59:11,351 --> 00:59:14,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Namco's putting out a game called, or I'm sorry, Bandai, well, it's the same thing.

898
00:59:15,114 --> 00:59:29,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Mina de Asubo de Namco Carnival comes out on the Wii, which I'm sure is just probably a collection of past games, or it might be, I don't know, this might be some type of Mario Party game, but starring the Namco characters.

899
00:59:29,606 --> 00:59:36,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's actually the Namco collection that came out over here.

900
00:59:36,692 --> 00:59:36,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah.

901
00:59:37,604 --> 00:59:40,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, with the upgraded games and stuff?

902
00:59:40,266 --> 00:59:40,946
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.

903
00:59:41,666 --> 00:59:49,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Also coming out on the Wii from Sega, Doraemon Wii, Himitsu Dugoketaisen is coming out.

904
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:54,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, wait for it, Disney Princess Enchanted Journey this week on the Wii.

905
00:59:54,433 --> 00:59:54,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

906
00:59:55,753 --> 01:00:00,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Also another Tamagotchi game, Tamagotchi no Fury Fury, Kajikaiden comes out as well.

907
01:00:00,936 --> 01:00:03,778
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope, I want to play No More Heroes, that looks fun.

908
01:00:03,798 --> 01:00:07,980
[SPEAKER_04]: The PlayStation 2, lots of stuff as well, another version of Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End.

909
01:00:08,501 --> 01:00:13,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Another Mahjong game, hooray, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories finally comes out on the PlayStation 2.

910
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:20,227
[SPEAKER_04]: And another version of Disney Princess Enchanted Journey, as well as a game called Finalist.

911
01:00:20,788 --> 01:00:24,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's just a price reduction though, it was already a game out there from Princess Soft.

912
01:00:25,728 --> 01:00:26,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Doko Demo Raku Raku DS Kakkaibo

913
01:00:50,983 --> 01:00:51,764
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the thing, though.

914
01:00:52,064 --> 01:00:55,665
[SPEAKER_04]: You always kind of worry because they advertise on the box how cheap it is.

915
01:00:57,706 --> 01:00:59,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cheap old game.

916
01:01:00,667 --> 01:01:05,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, K1 World GP comes out on the DS.

917
01:01:05,849 --> 01:01:07,309
[SPEAKER_04]: And you want me to try to pronounce this one?

918
01:01:07,429 --> 01:01:08,450
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's going to be a ton of fun.

919
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:08,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

920
01:01:11,316 --> 01:01:23,605
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a language learning program, which apparently I need.

921
01:01:24,185 --> 01:01:25,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you really do.

922
01:01:27,067 --> 01:01:30,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I can special order this game from Japan.

923
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:35,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Except it probably won't help me because it's probably for Japanese people to learn other languages.

924
01:01:36,334 --> 01:01:37,215
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll be screwed.

925
01:01:38,034 --> 01:01:40,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Also on the DS, Tales of Innocence comes out.

926
01:01:41,057 --> 01:01:42,418
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a Namco game.

927
01:01:43,899 --> 01:01:46,060
[SPEAKER_04]: And, wow, pretty big week in Japan, I must say.

928
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:51,004
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess they don't have the big shopping day like we do here, so they get games right up until Christmas.

929
01:01:52,145 --> 01:01:55,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming out on PSP, another version of Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.

930
01:01:56,388 --> 01:01:59,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Silent Hill Zero comes out, which was Silent Hill Origins here.

931
01:02:01,272 --> 01:02:06,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Minano Golf Portable 2, that's just Hot Shots Golf, comes out over there as well.

932
01:02:07,097 --> 01:02:07,277
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

933
01:02:08,083 --> 01:02:08,443
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

934
01:02:09,784 --> 01:02:10,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

935
01:02:11,905 --> 01:02:15,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so this is actually pretty recent news.

936
01:02:15,926 --> 01:02:21,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Activision and Vividi have merged into one super company.

937
01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:29,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Activision, you'll know, of course, behind the such wonderful series as Call of Duty, Tony Hawk, and the lesser known Cabela's.

938
01:02:30,232 --> 01:02:34,334
[SPEAKER_03]: And Vividi, of course, behind such wonderful games as Spyro,

939
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Scarface, and a small little game called World of Warcraft.

940
01:02:39,943 --> 01:02:41,985
[SPEAKER_03]: They own Blizzard, which is behind World of Warcraft.

941
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:49,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, this whole merger, you know, it's going to be pretty good, I'd say, for both companies.

942
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:52,131
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, millions of dollars here.

943
01:02:52,151 --> 01:02:52,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, billions of dollars.

944
01:02:53,012 --> 01:02:54,113
[SPEAKER_03]: But bad for the gamers.

945
01:02:54,593 --> 01:02:55,213
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just kidding.

946
01:02:55,233 --> 01:02:55,854
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea.

947
01:02:55,874 --> 01:02:56,674
[SPEAKER_03]: $18 billion deal.

948
01:02:56,714 --> 01:02:56,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo!

949
01:02:56,854 --> 01:02:58,115
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of money.

950
01:02:58,135 --> 01:02:58,315
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

951
01:03:02,503 --> 01:03:03,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Activision BlizzCon Activivendi Activivendi

952
01:03:23,405 --> 01:03:25,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Decide which company gets to keep its name.

953
01:03:25,546 --> 01:03:27,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Or VivendiVision or something.

954
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:32,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I just hope this means we get the level 70 Torrent Chieftain Warrior songs in Guitar Hero.

955
01:03:32,751 --> 01:03:35,072
[SPEAKER_01]: You already made that joke earlier, Rob.

956
01:03:35,392 --> 01:03:36,373
[SPEAKER_01]: When we weren't on air.

957
01:03:36,393 --> 01:03:39,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't they just call the company World of Warcraft?

958
01:03:39,234 --> 01:03:40,135
[SPEAKER_03]: They should.

959
01:03:40,175 --> 01:03:41,396
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

960
01:03:41,436 --> 01:03:44,878
[SPEAKER_03]: World of Warcraft for World of Warcraft players.

961
01:03:46,259 --> 01:03:47,199
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great idea.

962
01:03:49,289 --> 01:03:49,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I doubt it.

963
01:03:49,849 --> 01:03:50,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it will either.

964
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:50,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would it?

965
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:51,050
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

966
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:10,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

967
01:04:40,168 --> 01:04:41,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Project Gotham Kodo Racing

968
01:05:11,573 --> 01:05:19,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I, I, that would be my guess on what's going to happen is that, you know, some of the Blizzard franchises that Blizzard has not had time to pay attention to.

969
01:05:19,557 --> 01:05:22,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero is the new... Activision will make Diablo 3.

970
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:25,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody's, somebody's going to do it.

971
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:28,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Hero is the new class in the next Warcraft.

972
01:05:28,142 --> 01:05:29,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that'd be awesome!

973
01:05:30,363 --> 01:05:30,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Expansion.

974
01:05:31,003 --> 01:05:32,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Being able to play instruments.

975
01:05:34,429 --> 01:05:37,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we can come up with tons of dumb ideas.

976
01:05:38,031 --> 01:05:43,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Frisbee says there's no trucks in World of Warcraft, making reference to that commercial from a little while ago.

977
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:45,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a game, though.

978
01:05:45,915 --> 01:05:54,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be cool to have a role-playing game online that has a bunch of weird shit in it that makes no sense whatsoever, because I've never played a game like that.

979
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:55,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly!

980
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:59,622
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm talking like absolutely like crazy shit.

981
01:05:59,662 --> 01:06:03,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, where you can summon a giant jeep to come through and like crash people.

982
01:06:03,665 --> 01:06:05,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for no apparent reason, you know?

983
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:06,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like crazy shit.

984
01:06:07,006 --> 01:06:07,607
Oh my god.

985
01:06:07,767 --> 01:06:13,710
[SPEAKER_04]: So are you proposing that you need to meet with the heads of Activision Blizzard to propose Loki's World of Randomness?

986
01:06:14,691 --> 01:06:16,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I like the ring of that.

987
01:06:18,813 --> 01:06:19,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I might buy that.

988
01:06:19,813 --> 01:06:22,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Chatroom, would you buy a game called Loki's World of Randomness?

989
01:06:24,389 --> 01:06:26,030
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to attack you with my cat.

990
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:28,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Laser cats.

991
01:06:29,951 --> 01:06:30,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Laser cats.

992
01:06:30,612 --> 01:06:31,952
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll license laser cats.

993
01:06:34,233 --> 01:06:34,733
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it.

994
01:06:34,753 --> 01:06:35,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Ten million right there.

995
01:06:36,734 --> 01:06:38,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Giant jelly bean attacks.

996
01:06:38,775 --> 01:06:40,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, zap it with a laser cat.

997
01:06:40,956 --> 01:06:41,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.

998
01:06:42,237 --> 01:06:45,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I summon the truck to run it over.

999
01:06:45,538 --> 01:06:46,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind, forget it.

1000
01:06:46,218 --> 01:06:47,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Less QQ, more Mew Mew.

1001
01:06:48,919 --> 01:06:49,740
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awful.

1002
01:06:52,082 --> 01:06:52,802
[SPEAKER_01]: You should move on.

1003
01:06:52,822 --> 01:06:54,043
[SPEAKER_04]: The doctor says, I would pay $300.

1004
01:06:54,603 --> 01:06:57,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Tetsuya says, do want.

1005
01:07:02,486 --> 01:07:05,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Tetsuya gave you a LOL Irene for your less QQ, more Mew Mew.

1006
01:07:06,228 --> 01:07:06,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

1007
01:07:06,508 --> 01:07:06,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

1008
01:07:06,888 --> 01:07:07,328
[SPEAKER_04]: That was good.

1009
01:07:07,788 --> 01:07:08,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

1010
01:07:09,349 --> 01:07:09,789
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty.

1011
01:07:10,629 --> 01:07:11,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony.

1012
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:13,390
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is that?

1013
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:13,731
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1014
01:07:13,851 --> 01:07:15,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony has just... Talking Dolphin?

1015
01:07:16,072 --> 01:07:16,232
[SPEAKER_03]: It's...

1016
01:07:17,668 --> 01:07:20,549
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unfortunately a reference to a book that sucks.

1017
01:07:20,809 --> 01:07:21,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1018
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:21,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

1019
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:28,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony has decided to drop their ad agency of the past 13 years.

1020
01:07:28,873 --> 01:07:30,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did they decide to drop it now?

1021
01:07:30,814 --> 01:07:40,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm guessing probably after what happened in hindsight of the whole PlayStation 3 debacle where the ads were not so hot.

1022
01:07:41,058 --> 01:07:41,718
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1023
01:07:56,167 --> 01:07:56,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1024
01:07:56,947 --> 01:08:04,450
[SPEAKER_04]: For reference, the ad agency was TBWA Chiat Day was the full name of the ad agency.

1025
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:08,852
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're wondering, does this affect both the U.S.

1026
01:08:09,012 --> 01:08:09,432
[SPEAKER_04]: and Europe?

1027
01:08:09,492 --> 01:08:10,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it does.

1028
01:08:10,153 --> 01:08:13,354
[SPEAKER_04]: They were also the ones that created the whole black and white campaign.

1029
01:08:13,394 --> 01:08:16,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that thing for the PSP that some people called racist?

1030
01:08:16,995 --> 01:08:20,316
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other like Circus de Soleil one they have going on.

1031
01:08:20,557 --> 01:08:22,197
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been kind of a long time coming.

1032
01:08:23,158 --> 01:08:23,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

1033
01:08:23,638 --> 01:08:24,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Some might say.

1034
01:08:25,362 --> 01:08:32,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, just in case you're worried that Grand Theft Auto might not be coming out pretty soon, well, we still don't know when it's coming out.

1035
01:08:32,266 --> 01:08:47,835
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are starting to run some more videos and stuff for it, including a box art reveal trailer, which they elaborately painted a giant copy of the box art for Grand Theft Auto 4 on a giant canvas painting.

1036
01:08:48,667 --> 01:08:51,289
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks pretty awesome, but, you know, your typical Grand Theft Auto game.

1037
01:08:51,309 --> 01:08:52,890
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like every other Grand Theft Auto game I've ever seen.

1038
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:54,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, your typical Grand Theft Auto one.

1039
01:08:54,051 --> 01:08:58,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, people are dissecting it and saying, oh my god, there's motorcycles and helicopters in the game.

1040
01:08:58,594 --> 01:08:59,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, really?

1041
01:08:59,134 --> 01:09:00,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Like every other game.

1042
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:02,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, um, so.

1043
01:09:02,217 --> 01:09:05,539
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope the giant air tram can be used as like a weapon or something.

1044
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:07,080
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome.

1045
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you can cut the cables to that thing.

1046
01:09:11,363 --> 01:09:12,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, I wish.

1047
01:09:13,243 --> 01:09:19,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, but there's going to be a brand new trailer on December 6th, which is entitled Move Up, Ladies.

1048
01:09:21,388 --> 01:09:22,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Move up, ladies!

1049
01:09:23,509 --> 01:09:27,351
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?

1050
01:09:27,391 --> 01:09:29,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Next Thursday at 3 p.m.

1051
01:09:29,512 --> 01:09:33,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Eastern time is when you can expect that trailer, when the internet explodes with it all over the place.

1052
01:09:33,855 --> 01:09:39,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but you can expect to see it 24 hours later after the traffic dies down, because you know their servers are going to get killed when the trailer comes out.

1053
01:09:40,339 --> 01:09:42,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, like, didn't they say when the first one came out,

1054
01:09:43,306 --> 01:09:46,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that it broke the internet?

1055
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:48,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, something like that.

1056
01:09:48,973 --> 01:09:52,697
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, that's good that they're showing trailers because that means that there's more work being done on it.

1057
01:09:52,717 --> 01:09:55,560
[SPEAKER_03]: At least that's what I'd like to assume.

1058
01:09:56,545 --> 01:10:00,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Some new details have come out for another game that's getting an anticipated sequel next year.

1059
01:10:00,506 --> 01:10:03,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Silent Hill 5 comes out next year.

1060
01:10:03,787 --> 01:10:05,307
[SPEAKER_04]: And some new details have come out about the game.

1061
01:10:05,747 --> 01:10:09,889
[SPEAKER_04]: The flashlight and radio static is going to be returning to the game.

1062
01:10:10,109 --> 01:10:12,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Those kind of features didn't really exist in Silent Hill 4.

1063
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:17,851
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, that's not very surprising because Silent Hill 4 was not even originally going to be a Silent Hill game.

1064
01:10:17,971 --> 01:10:18,851
[SPEAKER_04]: So what have you.

1065
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:24,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Light apparently is going to actually kind of have a pretty major function in this game.

1066
01:10:25,117 --> 01:10:28,499
[SPEAKER_04]: The enemies will respond based on whatever the light is doing.

1067
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:35,425
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also going to be some puzzles that involve an x-ray viewer and nurses that, you know, are doing scary things.

1068
01:10:35,925 --> 01:10:43,051
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sounds like the game, of course, is being greatly inspired by the Silent Hill movie, but I don't think that's such a bad thing, to be honest.

1069
01:10:43,644 --> 01:10:44,485
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved the movie.

1070
01:10:44,745 --> 01:10:45,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the other biggest change.

1071
01:10:45,846 --> 01:10:49,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Silent Hill 5 will not have preset camera angles.

1072
01:10:49,888 --> 01:10:50,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

1073
01:10:50,209 --> 01:10:52,550
[SPEAKER_04]: You will control the entire visuals.

1074
01:10:53,271 --> 01:10:56,553
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually... I'm not sure how I feel about that.

1075
01:10:57,374 --> 01:10:59,715
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be a double-edged sword there.

1076
01:11:00,176 --> 01:11:11,463
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other thing that's kind of weird about it too is the damage system that they have in it now is going to be like Metal Gear Solid 3 where there's just not health power-ups anymore to heal you.

1077
01:11:11,503 --> 01:11:12,204
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to like

1078
01:11:13,314 --> 01:11:13,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1079
01:11:14,714 --> 01:11:15,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Kill a snake and eat it.

1080
01:11:15,955 --> 01:11:24,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Break a grenade open and like, you know... Silent Hill 5, break a grenade open and... Like Rambo style or something, I don't know.

1081
01:11:24,437 --> 01:11:24,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

1082
01:11:25,318 --> 01:11:26,238
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gonna be interesting.

1083
01:11:26,338 --> 01:11:34,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, there's supposed to be a minigame that has puzzles from like God of War, which were like DDR-ish in a way, button tapping things.

1084
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:40,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh God, like every other fucking game on Earth now with the stupid context sensitive shit.

1085
01:11:41,082 --> 01:11:42,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but Konami made DDR, so...

1086
01:11:43,824 --> 01:11:47,647
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like DDR, it's just Shenmue did it first.

1087
01:11:48,627 --> 01:11:49,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1088
01:11:49,788 --> 01:11:57,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, Metal Gear Solid 4, according to the producer, must sell a million copies day one in order for them to make their money.

1089
01:12:00,855 --> 01:12:08,520
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being released exclusively on the PlayStation 3 right now, that's going to be pretty hard for them to do.

1090
01:12:09,656 --> 01:12:13,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if the Eye of Judgment could only sell 17,000 in the first three weeks.

1091
01:12:13,197 --> 01:12:13,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it this way.

1092
01:12:14,137 --> 01:12:17,519
[SPEAKER_03]: No PlayStation 3 to date has sold a million copies day one.

1093
01:12:20,359 --> 01:12:24,581
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if any of them have sold a million copies at all.

1094
01:12:25,101 --> 01:12:31,623
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, granted, if there was going to be a game that's going to do that, I'd say Metal Gear Solid 4 would probably be it.

1095
01:12:31,923 --> 01:12:34,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we sure this guy wasn't just exaggerating a little bit?

1096
01:12:35,364 --> 01:12:36,645
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just because of the...

1097
01:12:38,044 --> 01:12:38,705
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1098
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:14,077
[SPEAKER_03]: but then again also people wanting to draw that conclusion well if they can't sell a million units on the Playstation 3 maybe if they developed it for the Xbox 360 as well they could sell a million units and whatever maybe it'll come out on Xbox 360 someday

1099
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:25,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, PC gamers are going to be very happy to hear, especially those that are into first-person shooters blended with RPGs, that Deus Ex is getting another sequel.

1100
01:13:25,241 --> 01:13:27,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Deus Ex 3 is coming out from Eidos.

1101
01:13:28,671 --> 01:13:33,595
[SPEAKER_04]: This was announced when they were talking about their newest studio in Montreal, which opened up a little earlier this year.

1102
01:13:34,656 --> 01:13:37,858
[SPEAKER_04]: The studio hopes to expand to about 350 people in the year 2009.

1103
01:13:38,459 --> 01:13:42,642
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just recently have started development on the game.

1104
01:13:42,682 --> 01:13:45,745
[SPEAKER_04]: It just passed proof-of-concept stage, Deus Ex 3.

1105
01:13:45,845 --> 01:13:48,988
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will see what develops on this game.

1106
01:13:49,028 --> 01:13:53,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure lots of people are foaming at the mouth because I know this is a very popular game on the PC.

1107
01:13:54,092 --> 01:13:54,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1108
01:13:55,424 --> 01:13:58,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, here's a strange rumor that's coming from a very unusual source.

1109
01:13:59,446 --> 01:14:05,328
[SPEAKER_03]: The unofficial Artie Lang site, and Artie Lang, you might know him from the Howard Stern show.

1110
01:14:05,488 --> 01:14:12,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, Lang will be voicing the role of a character named Big Al in an upcoming Leisure Suit Larry game.

1111
01:14:13,592 --> 01:14:13,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

1112
01:14:13,752 --> 01:14:17,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I think is pretty cool that they're making another Leisure Suit Larry game.

1113
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:19,494
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so fitting.

1114
01:14:20,174 --> 01:14:24,657
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very interesting way, I guess, that they found out that a new game was coming.

1115
01:14:25,238 --> 01:14:30,221
[SPEAKER_03]: No word on when it's coming or what it's going to be, but interesting.

1116
01:14:34,524 --> 01:14:38,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't think a new Leisure Suit Larry game is going to really be that impressive, to be honest.

1117
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:39,488
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the last one wasn't.

1118
01:14:40,669 --> 01:14:49,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, IGN has recently published their list of the OMG Top 100 Games of All Time list.

1119
01:14:49,715 --> 01:14:51,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't we get a list like this every couple of years?

1120
01:14:51,929 --> 01:14:52,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Every year.

1121
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:54,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Metal Gear Solid was number 24.

1122
01:15:21,607 --> 01:15:23,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Doom was number 19.

1123
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:25,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Chrono Trigger was number 18.

1124
01:15:25,889 --> 01:15:27,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Boo, it should be number 1.

1125
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:28,930
[SPEAKER_04]: 17 was Super Mario World.

1126
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:31,210
[SPEAKER_04]: 16 was Shadow of the Colossus.

1127
01:15:32,211 --> 01:15:33,811
[SPEAKER_04]: 15 was Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

1128
01:15:34,752 --> 01:15:37,032
[SPEAKER_04]: 14 was Pirates by Sid Meier.

1129
01:15:37,052 --> 01:15:37,573
[SPEAKER_04]: 13 was Ms.

1130
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:38,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Pac-Man.

1131
01:15:39,073 --> 01:15:40,714
[SPEAKER_04]: 12 was Star Wars Tie Fighter.

1132
01:15:41,834 --> 01:15:43,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that this list included PC games too.

1133
01:15:43,655 --> 01:15:44,955
[SPEAKER_04]: 11 was StarCraft.

1134
01:15:45,255 --> 01:15:46,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, then here's the top 10.

1135
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:49,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Resident Evil 4 was number 10 on the GameCube.

1136
01:15:49,897 --> 01:15:49,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1137
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:54,661
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, obviously that game got a lot of Game of the Year accolades when it came out.

1138
01:15:54,701 --> 01:15:55,521
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a pretty great game.

1139
01:15:56,682 --> 01:16:06,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy III or VI by the Japanese scale was the number nine game of all time, which I believe is the highest ranking Final Fantasy game on the list.

1140
01:16:06,389 --> 01:16:11,232
[SPEAKER_04]: So Final Fantasy VII was not in the top ten, which I'm sure makes fanboys mad, but I think that's okay.

1141
01:16:12,273 --> 01:16:15,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Number eight was The Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past.

1142
01:16:16,876 --> 01:16:18,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Number seven was Super Metroid.

1143
01:16:19,449 --> 01:16:20,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I love Super Metroid.

1144
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:21,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Which will probably be my number one, honestly.

1145
01:16:22,271 --> 01:16:23,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Number six was Half-Life 2.

1146
01:16:25,153 --> 01:16:32,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Number five was Super Mario 64, which a lot of people would probably put as their number one, so it's kind of interesting that there's still some more games to go here.

1147
01:16:33,118 --> 01:16:35,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Number four is The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.

1148
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:38,362
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's two Zeldas in the top ten?

1149
01:16:38,662 --> 01:16:41,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, the Zelda games are great games.

1150
01:16:41,624 --> 01:16:42,264
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just confirming.

1151
01:16:42,525 --> 01:16:44,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, it's two Zelda games in the top ten so far.

1152
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:47,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three is Civilization 2.

1153
01:16:48,846 --> 01:16:51,967
[SPEAKER_04]: God bless them for remembering the Civilization series because it is a great series.

1154
01:16:52,827 --> 01:16:54,267
[SPEAKER_04]: It does deserve to be that high on the list.

1155
01:16:55,428 --> 01:16:57,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I would have put the original Civilization, but that's just me.

1156
01:16:58,188 --> 01:16:59,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two is Tetris.

1157
01:16:59,669 --> 01:17:00,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Tetris.

1158
01:17:00,389 --> 01:17:01,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm, what's number one?

1159
01:17:01,649 --> 01:17:02,589
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think number one?

1160
01:17:02,629 --> 01:17:04,370
[SPEAKER_04]: The number one greatest game of all time.

1161
01:17:04,910 --> 01:17:05,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Pac-Man?

1162
01:17:07,170 --> 01:17:08,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Mario Bros.

1163
01:17:08,051 --> 01:17:08,591
[SPEAKER_04]: on the NES.

1164
01:17:08,611 --> 01:17:10,691
[SPEAKER_04]: The very first original Super Mario Bros.

1165
01:17:10,731 --> 01:17:12,031
[SPEAKER_04]: game.

1166
01:17:12,432 --> 01:17:14,052
[SPEAKER_04]: That does make a lot of sense because...

1167
01:17:14,981 --> 01:17:16,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Who doesn't remember Super Mario Bros.?

1168
01:17:17,123 --> 01:17:20,826
[SPEAKER_04]: If you play the theme for somebody, who doesn't know that theme and what that is?

1169
01:17:20,846 --> 01:17:23,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Mario is part of pop culture.

1170
01:17:23,207 --> 01:17:25,109
[SPEAKER_01]: People know who Mario is.

1171
01:17:26,029 --> 01:17:27,611
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes a lot of sense.

1172
01:17:27,691 --> 01:17:28,892
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a pretty good game at the time.

1173
01:17:29,072 --> 01:17:29,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.

1174
01:17:29,632 --> 01:17:30,133
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

1175
01:17:31,013 --> 01:17:31,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Still is.

1176
01:17:32,054 --> 01:17:32,334
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1177
01:17:32,494 --> 01:17:34,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a different website.

1178
01:17:34,936 --> 01:17:36,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Also happens to be affiliated with IGN.

1179
01:17:36,557 --> 01:17:38,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing another top ten list.

1180
01:17:38,619 --> 01:17:42,702
[SPEAKER_03]: This, of course, is Ask Men's Top Ten Hottest Women in Tech.

1181
01:17:44,918 --> 01:17:45,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.

1182
01:17:45,258 --> 01:17:47,299
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll run down this list here real quick, too.

1183
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:54,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 10, Wendy Chang, who apparently is, let's see here.

1184
01:17:54,881 --> 01:17:55,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know her.

1185
01:17:55,681 --> 01:17:56,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know her.

1186
01:17:56,221 --> 01:18:02,383
[SPEAKER_03]: She apparently does vidcasts on a network, clicknetwork.tv.

1187
01:18:03,984 --> 01:18:05,764
[SPEAKER_03]: But she has big boobies, so that's fine.

1188
01:18:06,004 --> 01:18:08,445
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's Asian, so two points there.

1189
01:18:08,845 --> 01:18:10,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Bryce Princess has big boobies, and she's Asian.

1190
01:18:10,706 --> 01:18:11,206
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, stop it.

1191
01:18:11,846 --> 01:18:12,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

1192
01:18:12,546 --> 01:18:14,227
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do my own video games, so...

1193
01:18:16,546 --> 01:18:22,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, Blair Butler, who is a stand-up comedian.

1194
01:18:22,429 --> 01:18:23,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know her.

1195
01:18:25,151 --> 01:18:29,134
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's on X-Play, apparently, or she's a writer on X-Play.

1196
01:18:30,034 --> 01:18:37,079
[SPEAKER_03]: And she also has a reoccurring bit in Tell Geek Out that appears on G4's website.

1197
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Are all these people G4 people?

1198
01:18:40,961 --> 01:18:41,041
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1199

[SPEAKER_03]: She also hosts a new game called Shout About Television.

1201
01:19:04,391 --> 01:19:07,293
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's working also as a tech reporter on Attack of the Shell.

1202
01:19:07,313 --> 01:19:10,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Some might call this podcast Shout About Video Games.

1203
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:11,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Veronica Belmont

[SPEAKER_01]: and get paid for it.

[SPEAKER_01]: That's what women do naturally.

01:20:34,179 --> 01:20:35,520
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so good at it.

[SPEAKER_03]: She's on G4's TechTV Canada's Call for Help show.

1217
01:20:50,990 --> 01:20:52,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I have to see what she looks like.

1218
01:20:52,831 --> 01:20:56,393
[SPEAKER_03]: She's not that standout.

1219
01:20:56,894 --> 01:20:57,794
[SPEAKER_03]: She's very plain.

1220
01:20:58,275 --> 01:21:00,176

[SPEAKER_03]: She doesn't do Cheat anymore, though.

01:22:11,388 --> 01:22:11,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it a...

1242
01:22:12,606 --> 01:22:15,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Makeover show or something like that, like for kids or something.

1243
01:22:15,349 --> 01:22:19,273
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a... Not makeover for kids.

1244
01:22:19,313 --> 01:22:19,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Not for kids.

1245
01:22:20,054 --> 01:22:22,737
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like... Bam, my kid is ugly, Diane.

1246
01:22:23,517 --> 01:22:26,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Not like that, like a room makeover.

1247
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,283
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know, trading spaces, but for kids.

1248
01:22:29,343 --> 01:22:30,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I know what you're talking about.

1249
01:22:30,505 --> 01:22:31,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that before.

1250
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:31,626
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1251
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:34,169
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not a makeover.

1252
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:35,709
[SPEAKER_03]: You're too fat to me.

1253
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:37,010
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get liposuction.

1254
01:23:01,912 --> 01:23:04,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, they look like little sluts.

1255
01:23:04,474 --> 01:23:09,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is a horrible thing to say about seven-year-olds, but who would let their seven-year-old learn these type of dances?

1256
01:23:09,437 --> 01:23:11,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they looked like they were training to become strippers.

1257
01:23:11,799 --> 01:23:12,319
[SPEAKER_04]: It was horrible.

1258
01:23:14,661 --> 01:23:22,506
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, I don't remember who it was that said it, but somebody that I was with said something about like, wow, they look like a bunch of little sluts, and one of the kid's parents was right there.

1259
01:23:22,526 --> 01:23:25,988
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, they turn around and they're like, yes!

1260
01:23:26,709 --> 01:23:28,130
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we wanted.

1261
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:29,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Mission accomplished.

1262
01:23:31,486 --> 01:23:31,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

1263
01:23:34,195 --> 01:23:34,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Smash Bros.

1264
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:35,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Brawl

1265
01:24:04,967 --> 01:24:06,488
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, that was a full stage.

1266
01:24:06,828 --> 01:24:09,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me actually look at the original post here on the dojo.

1267
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:10,690
[SPEAKER_01]: The dojo.

1268
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:11,551
[SPEAKER_01]: About what it is.

1269
01:24:15,713 --> 01:24:17,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, I guess it is the same stage.

1270
01:24:17,294 --> 01:24:18,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it looks exactly the same.

1271
01:24:18,354 --> 01:24:21,016
[SPEAKER_04]: And they also posted the music from the stage there on the website.

1272
01:24:23,857 --> 01:24:26,939
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit remixed.

1273
01:24:28,139 --> 01:24:28,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

1274
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:32,801
[SPEAKER_04]: That's on the smashbrothers.com website.

1275
01:24:33,382 --> 01:24:33,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Check that out.

1276
01:24:34,622 --> 01:24:36,683
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, gosh, Part A is running long tonight.

1277
01:24:36,703 --> 01:24:45,507
[SPEAKER_04]: We're almost at an hour and a half, but we want to go ahead and close out Part A here the way we always do, by paying tribute to the classic games of yesteryear.

1278
01:24:46,067 --> 01:24:50,169
[SPEAKER_04]: And DarkSakura is not here tonight to do the classic game of the week, but we've been filling in.

1279
01:24:50,209 --> 01:24:53,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week, I picked a game, Equinox, if you forgot.

1280
01:24:53,311 --> 01:24:57,273
[SPEAKER_04]: And this week, Loki's going to pick a game for us as his classic game of the week.

1281
01:24:59,894 --> 01:25:01,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, classic game.

1282
01:25:01,915 --> 01:25:01,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I...

1283
01:25:03,095 --> 01:25:04,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I was torn on what I should pick.

1284
01:25:05,516 --> 01:25:06,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost picked Dallas Panic.

1285
01:25:08,077 --> 01:25:11,938
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, we'll save that for another episode when she's gone as well.

1286
01:25:12,439 --> 01:25:20,442
[SPEAKER_03]: This week, I decided to pick a wonderful game that I loved on the Super Nintendo and was also on the Genesis as well.

1287
01:25:20,682 --> 01:25:23,783
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a game called Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

1288
01:25:24,823 --> 01:25:26,724
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's absolutely awesome.

1289
01:25:26,804 --> 01:25:27,724
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very cheesy.

1290
01:25:27,744 --> 01:25:30,885
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like a spoof on a bunch of horror films from the 1950s and 60s.

1291
01:25:33,384 --> 01:25:37,505
[SPEAKER_03]: It was made by LucasArts, actually published by Konami.

1292
01:25:39,586 --> 01:25:41,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a game you should check out.

1293
01:25:41,207 --> 01:25:46,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish it would come out on virtual consoles so we can play it again.

1294
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:50,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Tons and tons and tons of different levels you can play.

1295
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:56,951
[SPEAKER_03]: They have squirt guns, grenades, all sorts of things you can fight.

1296
01:25:58,192 --> 01:26:01,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Things from giant babies to UFOs, zombies, you name it.

1297
01:26:03,172 --> 01:26:03,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome game.

1298
01:26:04,653 --> 01:26:05,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Really fun.

1299
01:26:05,853 --> 01:26:05,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1300
01:26:06,194 --> 01:26:07,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually never played this game.

1301
01:26:08,035 --> 01:26:08,635
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I really have.

1302
01:26:08,655 --> 01:26:10,296
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one of those games I just kind of missed.

1303
01:26:10,956 --> 01:26:11,876
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to go do this.

1304
01:26:11,936 --> 01:26:12,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1305
01:26:12,877 --> 01:26:14,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then that's why they need to put it out on virtual console.

1306
01:26:15,518 --> 01:26:20,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you basically run through the stages trying to rescue people and stuff and collect weapons.

1307
01:26:20,801 --> 01:26:24,883
[SPEAKER_03]: And then sometimes they'll have you fight different things.

1308
01:26:24,923 --> 01:26:27,564
[SPEAKER_03]: And each one of the stages is titled after a movie.

1309
01:26:27,604 --> 01:26:28,765
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like a spoof.

1310
01:26:29,565 --> 01:26:32,807
[SPEAKER_03]: So they'll have a bunch that are like Night of the Living Dead and stuff like that

1311
01:26:33,533 --> 01:26:35,514
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool, he's freezing the zombies in this one.

1312
01:26:36,535 --> 01:26:41,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it might sound like it's kind of a generic game, but it's really stylized, and it's, like, really fun.

1313
01:26:41,558 --> 01:26:42,658
[SPEAKER_01]: You really just have to play it.

1314
01:26:42,678 --> 01:26:44,800
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really an action game.

1315
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:49,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I always hear folks talking about this game, but I've never really seen it in action, so... Oh, there's a little cheerleader.

1316
01:26:49,422 --> 01:26:50,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they have cheerleaders, that's right.

1317
01:26:50,443 --> 01:26:52,464
[SPEAKER_04]: So, wait, by running over them, they're saving him or something?

1318
01:26:52,664 --> 01:26:53,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1319
01:26:53,445 --> 01:26:54,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I think I remember seeing something like this.

1320
01:26:54,705 --> 01:26:56,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, he bounces on the trampoline to get over the hedge, right?

1321
01:26:56,987 --> 01:26:57,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1322
01:26:57,067 --> 01:26:57,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Or something?

1323
01:26:58,067 --> 01:26:58,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1324
01:26:59,588 --> 01:27:01,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Can he... Oh, yeah, he's saving that guy.

1325
01:27:01,389 --> 01:27:02,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1326
01:27:03,593 --> 01:27:05,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, somebody else is bouncing on the trampoline.

1327
01:27:05,156 --> 01:27:05,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's kind of neat.

1328
01:27:07,299 --> 01:27:08,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, pretty cool.

1329
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:11,405
