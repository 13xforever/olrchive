Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:05.800 --> 00:11.800
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com

00:11.800 --> 00:15.300
for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.300 --> 00:19.800
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.800 --> 00:23.600
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this Sunday evening,

00:23.600 --> 00:27.400
and I just want to remind you guys, you know, there are some more perks that you get when listening live.

00:27.400 --> 00:31.500
You know, we try to deliver a quality show to those of you guys who listen on the podcast,

00:31.500 --> 00:35.300
vlogcast, Zooncast, whatever the hell you call it, whatever you're listening to right now.

00:35.300 --> 00:41.000
But there's more perks when you listen live. We do tape on Sunday nights live at 6 o'clock Pacific time.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.800
All the details are on our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

00:43.800 --> 00:47.700
We have a live 365 stream and a video stream through Operator 11,

00:47.700 --> 00:51.900
and we were just showing off a new game on the Wii called No More Heroes during the bonus segment.

00:51.900 --> 00:55.700
So those are the kind of perks you get only when you listen live.

00:55.700 --> 00:59.500
But we still try to show a lot of love to those of you guys who listen to us on the podcast,

00:59.500 --> 01:02.500
because we realize not everybody can be here Sunday night.

01:02.500 --> 01:05.700
But you can try. You should try, at least once. See what it's like.

01:05.700 --> 01:09.700
All right, let's get back into the gaming news then, since we're already in the second half of the show.

01:11.500 --> 01:16.500
All right. Anyways, let's see here.

01:16.500 --> 01:23.500
Super Smash Bros. coming out over here, you know, obviously it was delayed a little bit.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.900
Previously it was supposed to be out this year, now it's February.

01:26.900 --> 01:31.700
Not so for Europe, at least. You're going to have to wait a little bit longer.

01:31.700 --> 01:36.300
And they haven't really said exactly when, but it's going to be Quarter 2 of next year.

01:36.300 --> 01:40.900
So, you know, I don't know. That's not good, I guess.

01:40.900 --> 01:43.500
But at least you're not waiting until Christmas of next year.

01:43.500 --> 01:47.700
But aren't the Brits kind of used to getting screwed like this in a way, you know?

01:47.700 --> 01:56.300
Maybe. But here's the thing, though. I don't really see what they... I mean, other than changing the screen resolution stuff that it renders at,

01:56.300 --> 01:59.300
you're not really localizing it for Europe, so...

01:59.300 --> 02:04.900
That's what I want to know. Like, are they having to, you know, produce extra copies and that takes so freaking long?

02:04.900 --> 02:07.900
Or what is it? What causes things to be so slow? I don't get it.

02:07.900 --> 02:10.300
I guess it's just, you know, changing some of the programming.

02:10.300 --> 02:14.900
Because, I mean, if you think about it, a lot of the games that they get in Europe we don't get over here for a while, so...

02:15.900 --> 02:17.100
Yeah, that kind of sucks.

02:17.100 --> 02:19.700
MacMan says Europe, the shaft of the gaming world.

02:19.700 --> 02:23.100
You know, I know we have quite a few people over there to listen. I'm sure aren't happy about this.

02:23.100 --> 02:25.100
They've already gotten some games we haven't had over here yet.

02:25.100 --> 02:30.100
Like, they have Endless Ocean already, which, you know, I'm sure given the opportunity they would say,

02:30.100 --> 02:32.100
Fuck Endless Ocean, let's get Super Smash Brothers.

02:32.100 --> 02:37.700
But, you know, they do get a few games before we do, so... I don't know.

02:37.700 --> 02:43.100
RossDlut in chat says, Loki, menus and stuff need to be made in other languages. Any announcer?

02:43.100 --> 02:52.100
Well, true. But, I mean, still, though, you know, for, like, some of the territories, they can release it in English-speaking territories or stuff like that.

02:52.100 --> 03:00.500
And, also, a lot of the games, like, you know, Excite Truck and that kind of thing, when they were putting them out, they develop them for, like, usually it's English, Spanish, and French, I think.

03:00.500 --> 03:05.500
Especially, all the Nintendo titles seem to be English, Spanish, and French even when they come out over here.

03:05.500 --> 03:06.000
Yeah.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.500
Because, you know, Canada and Mexico, you need French for Canada and Spanish for Mexico, so, you know, it's kind of like a region.

03:11.500 --> 03:14.900
I wouldn't think that that would, I mean, hold them back, really, too much.

03:16.900 --> 03:23.900
Alright, well, sorry Europe, it looks like you're going to get screwed there, but, you know, we'll tell you how fun it is.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.300
No, I'm just kidding, that's so mean.

03:25.300 --> 03:36.900
Alright, one, I guess, interesting kind of piece of news is that Nintendo is kind of, in a way, fessed up that they're not able to meet the needs of the Wii demand that's out there.

03:36.900 --> 03:43.900
You know how the Wii seems to be, once again, for the second year in a row, the hot holiday toy that everybody's dying to get.

03:43.900 --> 03:53.300
Nintendo has decided to pull ads for its Wii console, and this actually, this story is out of the UK, actually, although I do believe it affects everybody,

03:53.300 --> 04:01.300
that Nintendo's actually going to be redistributing the commercials that they had scheduled up until Christmas through the first quarter of 2008.

04:01.300 --> 04:09.900
A Nintendo spokesman said, quote, we have been running the campaign all year round, but we want to take a responsible stance this Christmas and not fuel demand.

04:09.900 --> 04:13.900
An ad industry insider said, quote, you can tell what's been happening.

04:13.900 --> 04:19.900
They have a lot of spots on TV, but I'm seeing more ads for the DS than I am for the Wii, so you can draw your own conclusions.

04:19.900 --> 04:24.300
So maybe that some of these ads got shifted to Nintendo DS ads, who knows.

04:24.300 --> 04:31.300
Production has been stepped up to 1.8 million units a month, and Nintendo still cannot meet the demand.

04:31.300 --> 04:37.300
According to RasteelUT in chat, it says eBay vultures are the only people buying the systems.

04:37.300 --> 04:41.300
Sad but true, there probably are quite a few of those folks buying it.

04:41.300 --> 04:44.300
RasteelUT also says software sales are still pathetic.

04:44.300 --> 04:46.300
You know why? I have a theory. Why?

04:46.300 --> 04:50.300
Because most people that are buying that system are perfectly content with Wii Sports.

04:50.300 --> 04:53.300
A lot of people are buying this just for Wii Sports.

04:53.300 --> 04:59.300
Especially when you start to look at the older crowd and the more casual gamers.

04:59.300 --> 05:05.300
That's the enabling game for the Nintendo Wii, and when it comes with the system, people don't think they need anything else.

05:05.300 --> 05:12.300
I mean, back in the day when we were buying 8-bit Nintendo systems with Super Mario Brothers and Duck Hunt, did we buy another game to go with it?

05:12.300 --> 05:16.300
Not necessarily, not always. Many kids found just that pack under their tree for Christmas.

05:16.300 --> 05:18.300
You know what I mean?

05:18.300 --> 05:26.300
Granted, I would also humor probably the implied statement there that there's not a lot of must-have software on the Wii right now outside of the Wii like Mario Galaxy.

05:26.300 --> 05:33.300
Well, there's a lot of good games out there, but there's a lot more really crappy games, and it's really hard to tell.

05:33.300 --> 05:38.300
But at the same time, those really crappy games kind of cater to the 7 and 8 year olds, you know what I mean?

05:38.300 --> 05:41.300
Like all the movie tie-in games, like Happy Feet and stuff.

05:41.300 --> 05:47.300
That ties into the child audience, that there are a lot of kids out there getting Wiis.

05:47.300 --> 05:48.300
Yeah.

05:48.300 --> 05:59.300
Anyhow, that's good, though, that Nintendo at least is not going to be making it even worse by continuing to advertise it on TV and reminding people who may not have thought to run out and get one otherwise.

05:59.300 --> 06:05.300
So if you still haven't gotten a Wii for whatever reason, maybe it'll be a little bit easier?

06:05.300 --> 06:06.300
Little bit?

06:06.300 --> 06:10.300
But probably not. You probably want to get online in the stock inventory.

06:10.300 --> 06:13.300
Well, some of us waited in line.

06:13.300 --> 06:19.300
That's true. I bet all the Nintendo fanboys and fangirls waited in line day one anyway, and they're just looking at this and laughing.

06:19.300 --> 06:22.300
Some of us just didn't care to buy a Wii.

06:22.300 --> 06:25.300
That's true, and some people are like, eh, fuck Wii.

06:25.300 --> 06:29.300
Oh, I should tell you, my mom told me she wanted a Wii.

06:29.300 --> 06:39.300
You know, you're not the first person to tell me that story, which is, I'm just kind of saying like, you know, I'm hearing a lot of people, their parents are wanting Wiis and getting into that, but it's the sports game.

06:39.300 --> 06:43.300
I know a parent that wants it for Wii bowling because she likes to bowl.

06:43.300 --> 06:48.300
I thought it was funny because my mom almost played my old Nintendo more than I did.

06:48.300 --> 06:52.300
And, you know, actually she probably played it as much as I did.

06:52.300 --> 06:59.300
She wouldn't admit to it, but my mom was a gamer once, and she had her Game Boy and played lots of Breakout.

06:59.300 --> 07:05.300
But, you know, now hearing my mom say, I want a Wii, can you get me a Wii?

07:05.300 --> 07:09.300
I was like, I don't have $300, but we'll see.

07:09.300 --> 07:12.300
Pika Uno has a very interesting perspective.

07:12.300 --> 07:17.300
He's one of our listeners that lives over in Japan, and he says, I just bought one for my friend in the UK.

07:17.300 --> 07:21.300
There are plenty of Wiis in Japan.

07:21.300 --> 07:22.300
So, kind of interesting.

07:22.300 --> 07:27.300
I wonder what effect that's going to have, though, if you bought one for your friend in the UK, because aren't the TVs different?

07:27.300 --> 07:29.300
Yeah, Japan's NTSC.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.300
I'm sure there's some converter.

07:31.300 --> 07:35.300
Well, I mean, if you have an HDTV, it's moot anyway.

07:35.300 --> 07:44.300
But for our friends in the UK, speaking of which, there is a couple of things that are out on the Virtual Console now.

07:44.300 --> 07:49.300
We have Light Crusader, which is one of Treasure's games.

07:49.300 --> 07:51.300
I love Treasure.

07:51.300 --> 07:54.300
Treasure gave us Silhouette Mirage.

07:54.300 --> 08:00.300
But this was one of their Mega Drive releases, which over here was the Genesis.

08:00.300 --> 08:07.300
And it's also coming out with, I do believe, Rolling Thunder 2.

08:07.300 --> 08:17.300
And also coming out is Cybernator, which was called Assault Suits Vulcan in Japan.

08:17.300 --> 08:22.300
Pika Uno wanted to clarify something, speaking of the whole UK and how he's sending one to his friend.

08:22.300 --> 08:31.300
He said modern PAL TVs are NTSC-compatible, which I guess that explains that. That's kind of cool.

08:31.300 --> 08:42.300
But he says 99% of NTSC TVs are not PAL-compatible, which he discovered when he went over to Japan from London, where he was originally at.

08:42.300 --> 08:46.300
Isn't High Def supposed to be all the same no matter where you are?

08:46.300 --> 08:47.300
It is.

08:47.300 --> 08:49.300
Then we need to get on that quick.

08:49.300 --> 08:53.300
Because these whole differing TV formats make things very frustrating.

08:53.300 --> 09:02.300
Well, just for example, when I was really big into my Gorillaz fandom, I was importing some of the DVD CDs.

09:02.300 --> 09:06.300
And I would just run it through my laptop to the TV and no problem.

09:06.300 --> 09:09.300
Yeah, so there you go.

09:09.300 --> 09:19.300
Anyways, let's see here. So for the US, you've got some good stuff coming out on the Virtual Console.

09:19.300 --> 09:26.300
Including, we talked about it last week, Pokemon Snap. That's going to be coming out.

09:26.300 --> 09:29.300
Baseball Stars 2 for the Neo Geo.

09:29.300 --> 09:34.300
And also Ghosts and Goblins. That was on the NES.

09:34.300 --> 09:41.300
Hooray for Pokemon Snap! I can't wait to download this and play this and send all of you pictures of Pokemon I take.

09:41.300 --> 09:47.300
Which means you, and you, and are you on my Wiilet? You don't have a Wii. Well then screw you.

09:47.300 --> 09:51.300
I'm going to definitely actually give that a download, but I won't say I'll be downloading Ghosts and Goblins.

09:51.300 --> 09:57.300
Because we actually broke out our Saturn for our annual tradition and Dan was playing Capcom Collection Volume 2.

09:57.300 --> 09:58.300
Nice.

09:58.300 --> 09:59.300
The game is too damn hard.

09:59.300 --> 10:01.300
It is too damn hard.

10:01.300 --> 10:02.300
I will not be downloading it.

10:02.300 --> 10:07.300
Because guess what? You play all the way through it and guess what? You have to play all the way through it again to beat the game.

10:07.300 --> 10:10.300
And then what do you get? Congratulations, the story is happy end.

10:10.300 --> 10:12.300
You beat, you kicked Satan's butt.

10:12.300 --> 10:17.300
Well anyway, I will definitely check out Pokemon Snap, so I'm excited about that.

10:17.300 --> 10:20.300
This is something I'm kind of curious to check out as well.

10:20.300 --> 10:27.300
A Ninja Party game is coming to the Nintendo Wii and the Nintendo DS in March of next year.

10:27.300 --> 10:29.300
Ninja Reflex is the name of the game.

10:29.300 --> 10:36.300
It's being published by EA, but also a company called Nunchuck Games.

10:36.300 --> 10:37.300
How appropriate.

10:37.300 --> 10:42.300
It's being developed by Sanzaru Games, which is a brand new studio in California.

10:42.300 --> 10:45.300
It's seven former Activision developers.

10:45.300 --> 10:48.300
And what a great first game to be putting out.

10:48.300 --> 10:50.300
A game all about ninjas.

10:50.300 --> 11:02.300
EA notes that Ninja Reflexes will center around doing challenges and testing your reaction time, which is very appropriate for a ninja game.

11:02.300 --> 11:04.300
Here's a quote.

11:04.300 --> 11:06.300
Millisecond precision.

11:06.300 --> 11:08.300
Sounds like fun.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.300
We'll see.

11:10.300 --> 11:13.300
I hope you can calibrate it or something to give it that extra precision.

11:13.300 --> 11:14.300
We'll see.

11:14.300 --> 11:17.300
That just sounds sort of nifty cool.

11:17.300 --> 11:19.300
We'll see.

11:19.300 --> 11:21.300
I'll check it out.

11:21.300 --> 11:27.300
This is fairly, fairly interesting stuff for anyone who has a Wii.

11:27.300 --> 11:42.300
If you join Club Nintendo and you would use your previous Nintendo website login, you can buy Wii points for four stars for every Wii point using your old stars from the Nintendo Club.

11:42.300 --> 11:45.300
And this is actually nintendo-europe.com.

11:45.300 --> 11:48.300
I don't know if they're doing anything like that in the U.S.

11:48.300 --> 11:49.300
I wish.

11:49.300 --> 11:55.300
But it was a loyalty program that they had going on where if you did stuff you had all these stars.

11:55.300 --> 12:01.300
So you can go through and use your points to buy games or go shopping or do stuffs.

12:01.300 --> 12:04.300
It's kind of nice that you can finally get something for it, you know?

12:04.300 --> 12:06.300
Yeah, I think it's pretty cool.

12:06.300 --> 12:12.300
As for all those people who saved up your stars, congrats to you.

12:12.300 --> 12:15.300
Anyways, let's see here.

12:15.300 --> 12:17.300
This is also kind of interesting.

12:17.300 --> 12:31.300
Usually you would think Gamefly with rentals for games and stuff, but now they're offering Gamefly Tunes, which is a partnership with a company called Brand Racket.

12:31.300 --> 12:37.300
And they're offering the subscribers five free preselected songs to download each month.

12:37.300 --> 12:48.300
And I guess it's going to highlight up and coming and established artists, and apparently people that aren't subscribed to the service can download one.

12:48.300 --> 12:59.300
And I guess this month, music including artists like RJD2, Thievery Corporation, Shadows Fall, OK Go, and Little Brother.

12:59.300 --> 13:03.300
That's interesting that they would be doing that kind of stuff.

13:03.300 --> 13:07.300
And as far as I'm aware, I don't think that's actually any video game music, so...

13:07.300 --> 13:14.300
Yeah, I actually downloaded some of those songs, and I mean, they are up and coming artists, so they aren't really...

13:14.300 --> 13:18.300
Some of them are OK, others aren't that great.

13:18.300 --> 13:23.300
And I imagine that probably every month it's going to be more of the same.

13:23.300 --> 13:28.300
Well, I mean, OK Go, they're in Rock Band, but I don't know.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.300
Free's good, I guess.

13:30.300 --> 13:36.300
I already have both of OK Go's other albums, and the rest of their stuff just sounds the same.

13:36.300 --> 13:39.300
Just less entertaining.

13:39.300 --> 13:41.300
Kind of boring in some cases.

13:41.300 --> 13:45.300
I don't listen to a lot of the stuff that you kids are listening to these days.

13:45.300 --> 13:49.300
You and your old radio discs.

13:49.300 --> 13:51.300
80s forever!

13:51.300 --> 13:54.300
8-track tapes.

13:54.300 --> 13:57.300
Well, anyway, that's cassette tapes.

13:57.300 --> 14:04.300
Let's move on to talking about something that could be all the rage in a couple of years, or very soon, who knows.

14:04.300 --> 14:10.300
Apparently a patent was filed by Apple back in September of 2006.

14:10.300 --> 14:15.300
And now it has just come out to light, because I guess these things take a while to hit the public internet.

14:15.300 --> 14:20.300
Apparently, there is going to be multi-touch technology in this game.

14:20.300 --> 14:23.300
So, apparently, what it is, basically...

14:23.300 --> 14:30.300
I mean, obviously, they already have the iPhone, but they want to apply this touch technology, the multi-touch thing, to gaming.

14:30.300 --> 14:35.300
So, they say, quote, this is being used for a game or a gaming application.

14:35.300 --> 14:43.300
And, of course, we all know about the iPhone, but now we're kind of talking about that possibly this patent was actually filed to do gaming on the iPhone.

14:43.300 --> 14:46.300
Possibly a music-based game.

14:46.300 --> 14:52.300
But, I mean, this really doesn't come as much as a surprise, because on the current iPods, they've gone into gaming a little bit.

14:52.300 --> 14:57.300
So, it just makes sense to me that on the iPhones and the iTouches and all this stuff, they're going to get into this as well.

14:57.300 --> 15:02.300
Yes, and remember how wonderful those games are on the iPods already.

15:02.300 --> 15:06.300
I'm being sarcastic, by the way, because they're not very good.

15:06.300 --> 15:10.300
Well, what about the one that came out from Harmonix?

15:10.300 --> 15:11.300
Faze.

15:11.300 --> 15:12.300
Thank you.

15:12.300 --> 15:15.300
Faze was okay, but, seriously, the rest of them sucked.

15:15.300 --> 15:17.300
I mean, I don't know.

15:17.300 --> 15:26.300
But then again, I mean, there's not much you can do with just a jog wheel, so, you know, having multiple touch screen stuff on there, yeah, that would be a lot better, obviously.

15:26.300 --> 15:34.300
But, I wouldn't, I don't know, you're going to get as much gaming out of this as you are an N-Gage, so, seriously.

15:34.300 --> 15:39.300
Well, I guess time will tell, but it is very interesting that that came up, nevertheless.

15:39.300 --> 15:44.300
Always interesting are the emails that you guys send us every week at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

15:44.300 --> 15:52.300
And every week, Jamie dives in head first into our big old mailbag and pulls out a few of the emails that she likes and reads them for us here, live on air.

15:52.300 --> 15:55.300
And that's what she's going to do right now in our mailbag segment.

15:55.300 --> 16:06.300
Email, email, email.

16:06.300 --> 16:16.300
And just as a point of order, I will say that I have read every email that comes through, and some are not being read, you know, on air, because we got a bunch of them.

16:16.300 --> 16:18.300
So, I will read a few of these.

16:18.300 --> 16:23.300
And one of them was sent from an iPhone, and that makes me laugh.

16:23.300 --> 16:28.300
This is from jazz432 slash ps3.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.300
Okay.

16:30.300 --> 16:32.300
Anyway, hey, guys, I love the show.

16:32.300 --> 16:35.300
You guys keep me going on the podcast at work.

16:35.300 --> 16:39.300
I just wanted to say that I found a new game for me.

16:39.300 --> 16:45.300
I know you guys are not very big on the PS3, but you need to give it time and a chance.

16:45.300 --> 16:49.300
I was on the PSN store last night and saw that they had added some new games.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.300
I had never heard of a game called Wild Arms.

16:51.300 --> 16:53.300
Have you never heard of Wild Arms?

16:53.300 --> 16:57.300
I know you guys slash ladies may have.

16:57.300 --> 17:00.300
It's a good RPG for the PSP.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.300
Well, it was a PlayStation game.

17:02.300 --> 17:07.300
Way better on PlayStation LOL anyway.

17:07.300 --> 17:10.300
I heard on your last podcast that you don't get reviewed much on iTunes.

17:10.300 --> 17:12.300
I will give you a good score when I get home from work.

17:12.300 --> 17:13.300
I love the show and keep it up.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.300
Jamie, I love your input on the show.

17:15.300 --> 17:19.300
It's always good to get info from the ladies and not from just us geek guys.

17:19.300 --> 17:24.300
Got to go back to work before the boss finds out I am emailing you guys, LOLJK.

17:24.300 --> 17:26.300
I'm telling.

17:26.300 --> 17:30.300
Actually, I just sold my copy of Ratchet and Clank Tools of Destruction.

17:30.300 --> 17:37.300
It's just not the full Ratchet and Clank, it's just I don't like the Ratchet and Clank series.

17:37.300 --> 17:43.300
That game is probably pretty good, but the person I sold it to loves it a lot more than I do.

17:43.300 --> 17:48.300
There's a lot of games though for the PS3.

17:48.300 --> 17:54.300
I was going to give Unreal Tournament 3 a chance, but for some reason,

17:54.300 --> 17:58.300
part of me thought that there was an actual good single player portion of that game,

17:58.300 --> 18:04.300
but it's Unreal Tournament and there's not, so I don't really want to buy it.

18:04.300 --> 18:07.300
I don't know, there will be more stuff that comes out later on.

18:07.300 --> 18:11.300
It's just right now, there's not a lot of great games for it.

18:11.300 --> 18:13.300
Not to say that there won't ever be.

18:13.300 --> 18:15.300
Some interesting comments on chat on Wild Arms.

18:15.300 --> 18:17.300
It's kind of polarizing the chat room.

18:17.300 --> 18:18.300
Separat1215 said,

18:18.300 --> 18:20.300
Wild Arms was never a huge game.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.300
I'm not surprised if no one knows what it is.

18:22.300 --> 18:23.300
RossDeelUT says,

18:23.300 --> 18:26.300
How the fuck has this guy never heard of Wild Arms?

18:26.300 --> 18:27.300
Jonathan F. says,

18:27.300 --> 18:31.300
Wild Arms is a killer RPG held up well against Final Fantasy VII,

18:31.300 --> 18:32.300
I think in my opinion.

18:32.300 --> 18:35.300
Wild Arms is just as it sounds, a Wild West RPG,

18:35.300 --> 18:38.300
although it's not that at the same time.

18:38.300 --> 18:42.300
So, I already have some comments on Wild Arms from the chat.

18:42.300 --> 18:43.300
Any more emails?

18:43.300 --> 18:45.300
No, none at all.

18:45.300 --> 18:46.300
Yeah, there's some.

18:46.300 --> 18:47.300
All right.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.300
Next email,

18:48.300 --> 18:49.300
Hey folks at OLR.

18:49.300 --> 18:52.300
I was just emailing to say that I was just about in tears at work

18:52.300 --> 18:56.300
from laughing so hard at Loki flipping out about one up protesting for publicity.

18:56.300 --> 19:02.300
I'm glad someone gets fired up about something and Loki offered up some radio gold.

19:02.300 --> 19:05.300
You guys host a fantastic show and I always look forward to listening.

19:05.300 --> 19:08.300
Keep putting out fantastic shows and us fans will be extremely saddened

19:08.300 --> 19:11.300
with the loss of this show because it really kicks the crap out of those

19:11.300 --> 19:16.300
other big name corporate podcasts with its real enthusiasm and passion.

19:16.300 --> 19:18.300
Ego++, thank you.

19:18.300 --> 19:20.300
And again, this email is sponsored by the Olive Garden,

19:20.300 --> 19:22.300
home of the Never Ending South.

19:22.300 --> 19:23.300
It's J-Rod.

19:23.300 --> 19:25.300
Dude, the Olive Garden is awesome.

19:25.300 --> 19:26.300
Next,

19:26.300 --> 19:27.300
Dear OLR,

19:27.300 --> 19:28.300
I was thinking,

19:28.300 --> 19:32.300
would those jot guys act the same way if it said gay girl?

19:32.300 --> 19:36.300
Oh, you missed the video last week.

19:36.300 --> 19:39.300
Somebody did this experiment where they went on the internet with Halo 3

19:39.300 --> 19:43.300
and their gamer tag was gay boy and they went into all these rooms

19:43.300 --> 19:45.300
and you can just imagine, I mean,

19:45.300 --> 19:48.300
Xbox Live, you can probably fill in the blanks with what happened.

19:48.300 --> 19:52.300
So, this is probably what this person is responding to is what would happen

19:52.300 --> 19:55.300
if this person went in the room with the name gay girl.

19:55.300 --> 19:57.300
Because when two girls make out, that's hot.

19:57.300 --> 20:00.300
But when two guys make out, that's gross.

20:00.300 --> 20:04.300
Dude, I think that guys making out is really hot.

20:04.300 --> 20:07.300
Anyway, they probably wouldn't.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.300
It's a sad truth of the world we live in.

20:09.300 --> 20:12.300
There's people who only like one part of something but not the other part.

20:12.300 --> 20:15.300
I'm just waiting until gaming is blamed for bigotry.

20:15.300 --> 20:17.300
Siaion671.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.300
PS, Sky already has the game.

20:19.300 --> 20:21.300
Sky's voice is a little different.

20:21.300 --> 20:24.300
Sky has the game. Sky's voice is the game.

20:24.300 --> 20:26.300
Don't get me started.

20:26.300 --> 20:28.300
But good point brought up.

20:28.300 --> 20:30.300
I would like to see an experiment done.

20:30.300 --> 20:33.300
I would like to see the same person go back on the Halo 3 with the name

20:33.300 --> 20:36.300
gay girl or lesbian girl or something like that.

20:36.300 --> 20:40.300
Because you say gay girl and a lot of folks get the stereotypical

20:40.300 --> 20:44.300
butchy girl who likes girls in their mind.

20:44.300 --> 20:47.300
But lesbians is a more exotic word.

20:47.300 --> 20:53.300
Lesbians is the lipstick wherein pillow fighting lesbians.

20:53.300 --> 20:55.300
Porn star.

20:55.300 --> 20:59.300
When I would tell you that most lesbians I know are in neither category.

20:59.300 --> 21:02.300
Yeah.

21:02.300 --> 21:05.300
So continuing forward, shall I?

21:05.300 --> 21:06.300
You shall.

21:06.300 --> 21:07.300
Greetings.

21:07.300 --> 21:11.300
This is Kripatkin from the Kripatkin and Hendricks Game Review Show.

21:11.300 --> 21:13.300
Sorry, I'm being tongue tied.

21:13.300 --> 21:15.300
While listening to your show last week, second part,

21:15.300 --> 21:17.300
I noticed that Loki casually dismissed Sensible Soccer

21:17.300 --> 21:19.300
as of little to no interest to anyone

21:19.300 --> 21:21.300
and then Sky and Rice Princess began to laugh at its name.

21:21.300 --> 21:23.300
Oh dear.

21:23.300 --> 21:25.300
I had to count to ten before writing this email

21:25.300 --> 21:27.300
as one should never write an email in anger for yes,

21:27.300 --> 21:31.300
such a dismissive attitude filled me with both fury and despair.

21:31.300 --> 21:34.300
Sensible World of Soccer, a.k.a. Sensei,

21:34.300 --> 21:36.300
is part of the holy trinity of British video game titles

21:36.300 --> 21:38.300
that cannot be slighted.

21:38.300 --> 21:42.300
It was an all-time classic footy game made by Sensible Software,

21:42.300 --> 21:47.300
hence the name, that built on Kickoff 2 title from back in 1989

21:47.300 --> 21:49.300
on the Atari ST and Amiga.

21:49.300 --> 21:53.300
To see it arrive on Xbox Live Arcade is nothing short of wondrous news.

21:53.300 --> 21:55.300
To put it into perspective, try to imagine someone saying

21:55.300 --> 21:57.300
Super Mario 3 is a bit meh

21:57.300 --> 22:02.300
and that is what you did last week as far as your British listenership were concerned.

22:02.300 --> 22:05.300
Oh, and in case you're wondering what other two games are in the trinity there,

22:05.300 --> 22:09.300
Speedball 2, already on Xbox Live Arcade, and Paragoid.

22:09.300 --> 22:12.300
If you want to know more about these three games, search on Wiki.

22:12.300 --> 22:14.300
It has some great pages for all three games.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.300
I've actually heard of Paragoid.

22:16.300 --> 22:19.300
Keep up the good work and just be careful over games

22:19.300 --> 22:21.300
that originate from the British Isles in the future.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.300
I mean, you might even start saying things like

22:23.300 --> 22:25.300
Lords of Midnight are a bit overrated.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.300
Not a good idea.

22:26.300 --> 22:29.300
So basically what Karpatkin's trying to tell us is that

22:29.300 --> 22:34.300
Guardian Legend is to Orange Lounge Radio

22:34.300 --> 22:38.300
as Sensible World of Soccer is to all of the UK.

22:38.300 --> 22:41.300
Is that kind of what this email is to summarize?

22:41.300 --> 22:43.300
That's the general...

22:43.300 --> 22:46.300
I see. Well, we are sorry for poking fun at your sacred game.

22:46.300 --> 22:48.300
Or he was just saying Loki was wrong.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.300
Which a lot of our emailers like to do.

22:50.300 --> 22:53.300
Dude, okay, no offense, but I mean...

22:53.300 --> 22:54.300
Uh-oh.

22:54.300 --> 22:55.300
You know, even...

22:55.300 --> 23:00.300
Okay, I'll give you, you know, yeah, Super Mario World 3 may be not the shit.

23:00.300 --> 23:03.300
And to be honest, it was the shit at one time,

23:03.300 --> 23:06.300
but times have changed, okay?

23:06.300 --> 23:09.300
Sensible World of Soccer may have been a great game at the time,

23:09.300 --> 23:11.300
and it still may be a great game now.

23:11.300 --> 23:13.300
But you know what, though?

23:13.300 --> 23:15.300
I ain't gonna download it.

23:15.300 --> 23:16.300
You know why I'm not gonna download it?

23:16.300 --> 23:18.300
Because it's a soccer game, for one.

23:18.300 --> 23:22.300
I don't play sports games, and I definitely don't play soccer games.

23:22.300 --> 23:25.300
And two, it's like an Amiga game.

23:25.300 --> 23:27.300
I'll check out the demo, and if I like it, I'll buy it.

23:27.300 --> 23:29.300
That's what I do with most games.

23:29.300 --> 23:31.300
I'll be sensible about it.

23:31.300 --> 23:35.300
Back in the day, I used to play Blades of Steel and stuff like that,

23:35.300 --> 23:37.300
so I have tried games and stuff like that.

23:37.300 --> 23:39.300
It's just not my thing.

23:39.300 --> 23:41.300
And I'm not saying that you're wrong for downloading it.

23:41.300 --> 23:43.300
I'm not faulting you for doing that, but you know what?

23:43.300 --> 23:45.300
I sure as hell am not downloading it.

23:45.300 --> 23:48.300
But you're wrong for being British, is what we're trying to say.

23:48.300 --> 23:49.300
I'm not British.

23:49.300 --> 23:51.300
I'm just kidding. Never mind.

23:51.300 --> 23:52.300
Rob.

23:52.300 --> 23:53.300
What?

23:53.300 --> 23:57.300
You remember, though, what I went crazy about finding at the store Friday night?

23:57.300 --> 24:04.300
Super High Impact, which is the only American football game that I like, ever.

24:04.300 --> 24:07.300
I like Tecmo Bowl on the Nintendo.

24:07.300 --> 24:08.300
That's my favorite.

24:08.300 --> 24:10.300
Super High Impact on Super Nintendo, I think.

24:10.300 --> 24:12.300
But I also played...

24:12.300 --> 24:15.300
What was it that was on Super Nintendo? Was it Mario Stryker?

24:15.300 --> 24:17.300
Wasn't that it?

24:17.300 --> 24:18.300
No, Mario Stryker's a new one, isn't it?

24:18.300 --> 24:19.300
No, that's the new one.

24:19.300 --> 24:21.300
Oh, that's probably like a new sequel or something.

24:21.300 --> 24:24.300
It was an old one on Super Nintendo, another soccer game.

24:24.300 --> 24:26.300
I used to play that all the time.

24:26.300 --> 24:28.300
Uh-oh, the chat room's requesting my British accent.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.300
No.

24:29.300 --> 24:30.300
You better go to next email.

24:30.300 --> 24:32.300
No, next email.

24:32.300 --> 24:36.300
Oh, I think I'll be logging on to Xbox Live this week and downloading some sensible World

24:36.300 --> 24:37.300
of Soccer.

24:37.300 --> 24:38.300
Sensible.

24:38.300 --> 24:39.300
Cheerio.

24:39.300 --> 24:40.300
Or Scottish.

24:40.300 --> 24:43.300
Okay, see, I'm not doing that shit, so I mean, come on.

24:43.300 --> 24:45.300
And they're getting mad at me.

24:45.300 --> 24:46.300
Whatever.

24:46.300 --> 24:47.300
Yeah, but I'm cute.

24:47.300 --> 24:48.300
Uh-huh.

24:48.300 --> 24:49.300
Yeah.

24:49.300 --> 24:50.300
Hey, OLR.

24:50.300 --> 24:55.300
I've been listening to your show for over a year now, and I think it's the best.

24:55.300 --> 24:56.300
Aww.

24:56.300 --> 24:59.300
My question is mainly for Loki, but others could chime in.

24:59.300 --> 25:00.300
Well, thank you for your permission.

25:00.300 --> 25:04.300
I bought a PSP slim and need to know how to install custom firmwares.

25:04.300 --> 25:09.300
Do I need Pandora's battery and how to?

25:09.300 --> 25:14.300
Um, your show is awesome, great, and with a PSP, I will hopefully be listening live

25:14.300 --> 25:15.300
more often.

25:15.300 --> 25:16.300
Thanks, Ryan.

25:16.300 --> 25:23.300
Yeah, you do need Pandora's battery in order to install custom firmware on there, and there's

25:23.300 --> 25:27.300
instructions online on how to do it, and you actually have to create a different Pandora's

25:27.300 --> 25:32.300
battery than the one that they use for the fat PSPs, but basically it involves you making

25:32.300 --> 25:38.300
the standard Pandora's battery, then you patch the file with some other thing, and then once

25:38.300 --> 25:43.300
you've done that, you run the Pandora's battery on the system, and then you can install custom

25:43.300 --> 25:44.300
firmwares.

25:44.300 --> 25:49.300
Don't ask me how to do it, because I didn't know at the time, I had to read a very, you

25:49.300 --> 25:53.300
know, stupid walkthrough on how to do it, and it took me about three times before I

25:53.300 --> 25:54.300
finally got it right.

25:54.300 --> 25:58.300
So, it's not easy, but it's not super difficult.

25:58.300 --> 26:00.300
Do you have to mod your PSP?

26:00.300 --> 26:02.300
I mean, Jesus, just play the games.

26:02.300 --> 26:04.300
Me, I don't!

26:04.300 --> 26:07.300
Hey, I have to mod everything.

26:07.300 --> 26:08.300
Everything!

26:08.300 --> 26:12.300
There is not anything that I don't break open.

26:12.300 --> 26:14.300
Except for my DS, I haven't done that yet.

26:14.300 --> 26:17.300
I'm working on it right now, though.

26:17.300 --> 26:22.300
We broke open my old Game Boy Advance to put an afterburner in it.

26:22.300 --> 26:25.300
That's different, because it really needed that.

26:25.300 --> 26:27.300
I mean, that really enhanced the damn Game Boy Advance.

26:27.300 --> 26:30.300
My friend did that for me for my birthday, but I'm just saying, you know, the PSP, yeah,

26:30.300 --> 26:35.300
I installed, when they were first out, I installed the stuff that let me play Kid Icarus on the

26:35.300 --> 26:39.300
PSP so I could go, hee, hee, hee, I have Kid Icarus everywhere, but now it's kind of old.

26:39.300 --> 26:40.300
And so, I just, I don't care anymore.

26:40.300 --> 26:41.300
I don't care about modding anymore.

26:41.300 --> 26:44.300
I haven't hacked my iPhone, though, and I'm not going to.

26:44.300 --> 26:47.300
Not my thing.

26:47.300 --> 26:48.300
Next email.

26:48.300 --> 26:51.300
DMN says, Loki modded his penis.

26:51.300 --> 26:52.300
Exactly.

26:52.300 --> 26:55.300
Because you did say you have to mod everything.

26:55.300 --> 26:58.300
Game consoles, okay.

26:58.300 --> 27:03.300
Yes, please, next email, quick.

27:03.300 --> 27:05.300
Next email says words.

27:05.300 --> 27:07.300
Hey, Loki, Dark Soccer, and Sky.

27:07.300 --> 27:10.300
I just wanted to thank you guys so much for helping me get through a really hard first

27:10.300 --> 27:12.300
semester at college.

27:12.300 --> 27:16.300
Looking forward to the next podcast kept me going and helped me look around for some fellow

27:16.300 --> 27:20.300
gamers that need play, so I quickly found a whole bunch of Wii players, and I've been

27:20.300 --> 27:24.300
having fun with Mario Strikers since I'm one of those more social gamers, although I don't

27:24.300 --> 27:25.300
play online a lot.

27:25.300 --> 27:28.900
Anyway, keep up the good work, and once again, thanks for making this transition all that

27:28.900 --> 27:31.340
much more manageable.

27:31.340 --> 27:32.660
All the best, Cliff R.

27:32.660 --> 27:34.660
Wow, lots of good ego emails tonight.

27:34.660 --> 27:38.620
No, but I'm glad to hear about the Wii Club that's forming at your campus.

27:38.620 --> 27:39.620
That's kind of fun.

27:39.620 --> 27:41.500
That's pretty cool.

27:41.500 --> 27:42.500
Last email.

27:42.500 --> 27:45.820
Remember when we were going to do a show live at a college campus?

27:45.820 --> 27:47.060
We actually, no, we were having talks.

27:47.060 --> 27:48.060
Remember that?

27:48.060 --> 27:49.740
We were going to do that at East Davis.

27:49.740 --> 27:53.340
We were going to be doing it in their big theater they had there, but it didn't work

27:53.340 --> 27:59.220
out because our hookup left, and we no longer had a hookup to do our show there.

27:59.220 --> 28:00.620
We were going to do one of our big shows there.

28:00.620 --> 28:04.660
I don't remember if it was 150 or 200, but oh well.

28:04.660 --> 28:06.180
Maybe we should have a contest.

28:06.180 --> 28:07.580
OLR comes to your school.

28:07.580 --> 28:08.580
Apparently.

28:08.580 --> 28:09.580
That'd be fun.

28:09.580 --> 28:11.780
Yeah, and to win, you pay for it.

28:11.780 --> 28:15.220
No, I'm just kidding.

28:15.220 --> 28:16.220
Last email.

28:16.220 --> 28:17.220
Yes.

28:17.220 --> 28:18.220
Hey, it's me, Dr. Burst.

28:18.220 --> 28:22.740
I took a few months off to get my grades up, but I'm pulling an all-nighter tonight to

28:22.740 --> 28:26.500
get this essay done, and I'm listening live for motivation.

28:26.500 --> 28:29.900
You can do it!

28:29.900 --> 28:32.740
Oh, Jamie, always the inspirational one.

28:32.740 --> 28:36.980
All I have to say is you guys have gotten four times better while I was gone.

28:36.980 --> 28:40.940
I'm glad that the price changes on Live 365 did not kill you.

28:40.940 --> 28:44.560
The show has helped me get over two pages out of three.

28:44.560 --> 28:45.560
Good job, guys.

28:45.560 --> 28:46.560
Keep it up.

28:46.560 --> 28:50.180
That's 10,000 cups of coffee for the win, Dr. Burst.

28:50.180 --> 28:51.180
Nice.

28:51.180 --> 28:53.740
We've gotten four times better.

28:53.740 --> 28:59.100
We must have been really bad before to be four times better now because I would say

28:59.100 --> 29:01.500
we're only about, and we're like on the line right now.

29:01.500 --> 29:02.500
You know what?

29:02.500 --> 29:13.020
I lied because there's, well, it's an article that Robwith2B is linked to that I actually

29:13.020 --> 29:14.220
think is pretty cool.

29:14.220 --> 29:22.700
It's from Engadget as soon as it loads, but it's Sega protecting the Dreamcast trademark

29:22.700 --> 29:24.340
but not doing another console.

29:24.340 --> 29:25.340
Oh, God.

29:25.340 --> 29:26.340
That whole debacle.

29:26.340 --> 29:27.340
I forgot about that.

29:27.340 --> 29:36.060
Well, if it'll ever load, but basically, Sega is saying that they're going to keep that

29:36.060 --> 29:44.380
trademark so that they can, I guess, protect their rights in the Dreamcast name, but they're

29:44.380 --> 29:46.460
not going to be doing any.

29:46.460 --> 29:50.020
I want to know how the hell someone jumped to that conclusion that they're doing a Dreamcast

29:50.020 --> 29:52.500
2 from them renewing the trademarks.

29:52.500 --> 29:55.340
How did that rumor even start?

29:55.340 --> 29:57.540
Because that kind of seems stupid to me.

29:57.540 --> 30:01.020
They're quoted as saying they have no plans to get back into the console business.

30:01.020 --> 30:02.020
Which is no surprise.

30:02.020 --> 30:04.020
When I first read that rumor, I'm like, yeah, right.

30:04.020 --> 30:05.020
Yeah, right.

30:05.020 --> 30:08.540
They're going to put out a Dreamcast 2 right now and the market is crowded.

30:08.540 --> 30:11.060
I just don't see Sega getting back into consoles anytime soon.

30:11.060 --> 30:15.660
I mean, let's face it, sorry Sega fans, but the last few offerings from Sega have not

30:15.660 --> 30:19.140
been all that, even in the console market.

30:19.140 --> 30:22.300
So they got a lot of catching up to do, you know what I mean, before they start thinking

30:22.300 --> 30:23.300
about a console again.

30:23.300 --> 30:25.220
Okay, we got one last email.

30:25.220 --> 30:26.220
All right.

30:26.220 --> 30:27.220
Hurry up.

30:27.220 --> 30:28.220
I was blinking.

30:28.220 --> 30:29.220
Fine.

30:29.220 --> 30:30.220
It says boobies.

30:30.220 --> 30:31.220
I'm not joking.

30:31.220 --> 30:32.220
The first word in it is boobies.

30:32.220 --> 30:33.220
Is that from DMN?

30:33.220 --> 30:34.220
No.

30:34.220 --> 30:35.220
It's from the doctor.

30:35.220 --> 30:36.220
Oh, okay.

30:36.220 --> 30:37.220
LOL.

30:37.220 --> 30:39.780
I'm thinking a lot of LOLs in my emails.

30:39.780 --> 30:40.780
What is that about?

30:40.780 --> 30:41.780
I love you guys.

30:41.780 --> 30:45.020
Anyway, I'm going to try and buy some 360 before Christmas.

30:45.020 --> 30:48.700
Thanks for the idea, Sky and Loki, the doctor.

30:48.700 --> 30:54.100
Send me a TARDIS so I can, you know, go elsewhere and else win.

30:54.100 --> 30:57.340
And now here, RossdielUT actually has a really good idea here.

30:57.340 --> 31:02.740
He says I can imagine, for once, ha ha ha, no, just kidding, he says I can imagine they'll

31:02.740 --> 31:06.620
just repackage a flashback-type console for Dreamcast games.

31:06.620 --> 31:09.540
Now that I could see happening.

31:09.540 --> 31:13.780
That is a sensible world of Dreamcast to me.

31:13.780 --> 31:18.700
By the way, it was Mega Man Soccer I was trying to think of.

31:18.700 --> 31:19.700
Let's see.

31:19.700 --> 31:20.700
What else?

31:20.700 --> 31:22.340
I'm getting lulled today with boobies.

31:22.340 --> 31:23.620
Somebody else had a sensible joke.

31:23.620 --> 31:24.620
Oh, yes.

31:24.620 --> 31:29.620
ActDeft said when we go to the college campuses, it could be OLR, the Sensible World of Podcasting

31:29.620 --> 31:30.620
Tour.

31:30.620 --> 31:31.620
I like that name.

31:31.620 --> 31:36.620
We should have that contest, contest, pay for us to come see you.

31:36.620 --> 31:37.620
I like that idea.

31:37.620 --> 31:38.620
Pay for our vacation.

31:38.620 --> 31:46.420
Here's our new contest, pay for OLR to come to your town.

31:46.420 --> 31:50.820
And they can make fun of your town and then maybe show some people how to do podcasting.

31:50.820 --> 31:54.460
We'll record our podcast in your town if you pay.

31:54.460 --> 31:56.860
But not at your house, because that would be creepy.

31:56.860 --> 32:00.740
And you might not have good internet either.

32:00.740 --> 32:01.740
Exactly.

32:01.740 --> 32:02.740
My God.

32:02.740 --> 32:05.420
The show is breaking our internet at this house.

32:05.420 --> 32:06.860
We kind of tried to prep for it.

32:06.860 --> 32:07.860
All right.

32:07.860 --> 32:08.860
End of mailbag.

32:08.860 --> 32:10.300
Let's get to some more stuff.

32:10.300 --> 32:13.500
If you want to send in an email, give us some ego plus plus.

32:13.500 --> 32:14.500
We always love that.

32:14.500 --> 32:17.820
Mailbag at orangeontrado.com or some ego minus minus.

32:17.820 --> 32:20.860
I think Jamie skipped some of the ego minus minus this week.

32:20.860 --> 32:29.980
I skipped a reminder of manners addressed to one of our three that isn't you or me.

32:29.980 --> 32:33.220
I was looking forward to that email because it was kind of funny.

32:33.220 --> 32:34.220
Do you want me to read it?

32:34.220 --> 32:35.220
Yes.

32:35.220 --> 32:36.220
Read it because it's funny.

32:36.220 --> 32:37.220
Okay.

32:37.220 --> 32:38.220
You'll see why in a minute.

32:38.220 --> 32:39.220
I have to open the email box again.

32:39.220 --> 32:40.220
Hold on.

32:40.220 --> 32:41.220
All right.

32:41.220 --> 32:42.220
We're going to give her a minute.

32:42.220 --> 32:45.500
Because there's an email that's criticizing Loki that I actually found kind of funny and

32:45.500 --> 32:47.260
I want her to read it.

32:47.260 --> 32:48.820
And it's funny because it's true.

32:48.820 --> 32:49.820
It is so fucking true.

32:49.820 --> 32:50.820
It is true.

32:50.820 --> 32:53.920
And I've been listening all night long tonight and it is completely true and so that's why

32:53.920 --> 32:54.920
I want to...

32:54.920 --> 32:55.920
I know Loki's like, what the fuck did I do now?

32:55.920 --> 32:56.920
I'm trying to log back into...

32:56.920 --> 32:57.920
Okay.

32:57.920 --> 32:58.920
Here we go.

32:58.920 --> 32:59.920
I have to go in the old mail.

32:59.920 --> 33:05.000
All criticisms of me are true.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
So whatever.

33:06.000 --> 33:19.540
Of course when you start playing the music now the email starts to load.

33:19.540 --> 33:20.540
Old mail.

33:20.540 --> 33:21.740
I can't wait to see.

33:21.740 --> 33:23.920
I know because Op 11 is running.

33:23.920 --> 33:26.920
Op 11 is going to...

33:26.920 --> 33:27.920
Damn you, Op 11.

33:27.920 --> 33:30.560
Yeah, yeah, Loki's like, oh, take your time.

33:30.560 --> 33:31.360
Here we go.

33:31.360 --> 33:32.760
Oh, hooray.

33:32.760 --> 33:36.000
And this is from Mario.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.080
Oh, shit.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.280
You know that Mario's calling you out now.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.760
Yeah, there are other people in the world named Mario

33:41.760 --> 33:45.320
other than the video game character.

33:45.320 --> 33:47.480
I will not say last names on the air, so.

33:47.480 --> 33:48.600
All right.

33:48.600 --> 33:51.800
Loki, I find that you are very rude to your co-hosts

33:51.800 --> 33:53.600
and audience when you cut them off

33:53.600 --> 33:57.000
with your standard introduction anyways.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.240
Saying anyways after someone states

33:59.240 --> 34:01.320
that whatever is said is not important.

34:01.320 --> 34:04.300
What everyone says is important, even your thoughts

34:04.300 --> 34:05.160
and comments.

34:05.160 --> 34:07.480
Learn to stop saying anyways after anyone's statements

34:07.480 --> 34:09.960
except your own statements.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.200
Anyways, I don't really care.

34:14.480 --> 34:15.480
It is true, though.

34:15.480 --> 34:16.200
No, he does.

34:16.200 --> 34:16.720
He does.

34:16.720 --> 34:18.360
Well, there's people that interrupt me

34:18.360 --> 34:19.560
all the fucking time.

34:19.560 --> 34:22.600
You'll hear me going, hey, hey, I'm not doing talking yet.

34:22.600 --> 34:24.160
Hey, listen.

34:24.160 --> 34:26.080
Hey, listen.

34:26.080 --> 34:28.760
Hey, listen.

34:28.760 --> 34:30.400
It's over.

34:30.400 --> 34:31.200
I'll say anyways.

34:31.200 --> 34:31.880
It's over.

34:31.880 --> 34:32.760
Well, please.

34:32.760 --> 34:34.440
No, it's just funny.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.960
We're just poking fun at you because I

34:35.960 --> 34:37.680
don't think you really mean it to be rude,

34:37.680 --> 34:39.520
but it's been kind of your transition word.

34:39.520 --> 34:41.280
Like, you know, we've been working on our transit.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.800
You know, going from one story to another, we try to be smooth.

34:43.800 --> 34:44.960
Like, you know, oh, we're going to go from one,

34:44.960 --> 34:46.280
we eat a story, another, we story.

34:46.280 --> 34:47.280
When Loki's ready to go on a story,

34:47.280 --> 34:50.480
it's like, OK, anyways, we got this game coming out.

34:50.480 --> 34:52.880
Oh, my god, Rob, your light's just seizures.

34:52.880 --> 34:53.820
Did they?

34:53.820 --> 34:55.720
Yeah, they're just sitting here and we're on.

34:55.720 --> 34:56.880
Blink.

34:56.880 --> 34:59.360
And then it's because he has them on that one

34:59.360 --> 35:00.720
where they cycle.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.760
Yeah, they're on the cycle one where it goes to anything.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.360
They cycle, you know, with a fake hand.

35:04.360 --> 35:06.440
Well, I just happened to look over there when they were.

35:06.440 --> 35:08.840
All right, anyways, can we get back into the gaming news now?

35:08.840 --> 35:11.160
Definitely, we can get back into the gaming news,

35:11.160 --> 35:12.240
and I'll stop shopping.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.360
I want to get a little bell, and every time Loki

35:17.360 --> 35:18.800
says anyways, I go, bing.

35:18.800 --> 35:20.800
Weren't you going to get a bell for something else?

35:20.800 --> 35:22.360
I know, there was something else I was going to get a bell for,

35:22.360 --> 35:23.400
and I never did.

35:23.400 --> 35:25.480
Oh, well, because I'm lazy.

35:25.480 --> 35:31.160
So rock band ain't coming out in Canada until the 28th.

35:31.160 --> 35:33.360
Sucks for you guys, but guess what?

35:33.360 --> 35:35.960
You know, the problem is they don't

35:35.960 --> 35:37.880
have enough guitars and instruments and stuff

35:37.880 --> 35:38.480
to go around.

35:38.480 --> 35:41.560
It doesn't help that their first batch of them also sucked.

35:41.560 --> 35:44.160
Because they're having to send all the Canadian guitars out

35:44.160 --> 35:46.520
as replacements for all the broken American ones,

35:46.520 --> 35:47.640
and you know it's true.

35:47.640 --> 35:50.240
Oh, yeah, probably.

35:50.240 --> 35:55.840
So yeah, no rock band for you.

35:55.840 --> 35:59.680
All right, sorry.

35:59.680 --> 36:02.200
Moving on to the PSP.

36:02.200 --> 36:06.160
PSP got a new game on the PC PlayStation Store.

36:06.160 --> 36:07.320
How the hell does that work?

36:07.320 --> 36:09.560
Well, there's this new game, and it's called Beats.

36:09.560 --> 36:12.240
And for $4.99, what you do is you download this,

36:12.240 --> 36:13.880
and you use this little tool on your PC

36:13.880 --> 36:16.160
to put it on the memory stick.

36:16.160 --> 36:18.000
And the game itself was developed

36:18.000 --> 36:21.760
by Sony Computer Entertainment in Europe.

36:21.760 --> 36:23.240
I guess apparently this was going

36:23.240 --> 36:26.200
to be a UMD project, like an actual full game.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.840
And there was actually going to be licensed music and videos.

36:28.840 --> 36:31.720
Apparently the Sugar Babes, which is a British band,

36:31.720 --> 36:33.200
was going to be involved.

36:33.200 --> 36:36.480
But they decided to scrap that idea, thank god.

36:36.480 --> 36:39.480
And what they did instead is that now for this $5 game,

36:39.480 --> 36:42.520
it'll actually run off the MP3s that's on your PSP.

36:42.520 --> 36:45.000
So it's very similar to that iPod game that just

36:45.000 --> 36:46.240
came out phase.

36:46.240 --> 36:48.040
But, well, it doesn't look the same.

36:48.040 --> 36:51.680
To me, the game itself looks like one of those cut scenes

36:51.680 --> 36:54.280
and get there, not cut scenes, but one

36:54.280 --> 36:55.720
of the parts of Guitar Man.

36:55.720 --> 36:57.680
Not the part where you're moving the analog stick around,

36:57.680 --> 36:58.680
but the part where all the notes are

36:58.680 --> 36:59.800
coming in towards the center.

36:59.800 --> 37:02.760
When you are doing the attacks.

37:02.760 --> 37:03.260
Yes.

37:03.260 --> 37:04.920
Counting the attacks.

37:04.920 --> 37:06.680
That's what this looks like to me.

37:06.680 --> 37:08.280
Oh my god, you're right.

37:08.280 --> 37:11.280
Now you can't get that on the PlayStation 3 store

37:11.280 --> 37:12.880
for whatever reason, maybe soon.

37:12.880 --> 37:15.240
But right now you can only get it on the PC store.

37:15.240 --> 37:16.800
So there you go.

37:16.800 --> 37:19.040
It looks very plain.

37:19.040 --> 37:21.580
So, oh, I guess Tiger Claw actually

37:21.580 --> 37:26.400
linked a YouTube video of our buddy Bobby playing beats.

37:26.400 --> 37:27.720
So I'm curious about this.

37:27.720 --> 37:30.240
And since the OP11's done, we should actually

37:30.240 --> 37:31.080
have bandwidth now.

37:31.080 --> 37:32.720
I want to look at this.

37:32.720 --> 37:34.200
Let's see.

37:34.200 --> 37:36.240
All right, there's a little watermark.

37:36.240 --> 37:37.440
OK, here we go.

37:37.440 --> 37:40.560
Let's take a look at this.

37:40.560 --> 37:41.600
Looks kind of cute.

37:41.600 --> 37:42.160
Let's see.

37:42.160 --> 37:44.360
Let's get into the actual game play.

37:44.360 --> 37:45.640
Oh, he's playing to his own show.

37:45.640 --> 37:46.200
That's cute.

37:50.600 --> 37:51.840
That's something else.

37:51.840 --> 37:53.120
I don't know, the game itself doesn't

37:53.120 --> 37:54.240
look that exciting, though.

37:58.200 --> 37:59.680
There you have it.

37:59.680 --> 38:01.080
Nice job, Bobby.

38:01.080 --> 38:02.840
Good promotional piece, I got to say.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.240
That's a good one.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.400
Anyhow, that's it.

38:05.400 --> 38:06.360
PSP beats.

38:06.360 --> 38:09.440
Not something I think I'm going to run and grab my PSP for.

38:09.440 --> 38:12.240
I don't know, it doesn't look that exciting to me.

38:12.240 --> 38:13.640
You know what?

38:13.640 --> 38:15.600
I'm not going to download it.

38:15.600 --> 38:18.640
However, this is something I do want.

38:18.640 --> 38:22.760
And by do want, I mean do want.

38:22.760 --> 38:23.840
Finally.

38:23.840 --> 38:28.280
Lumines is now available on the PC, yay.

38:28.280 --> 38:30.600
My god, what else are they going to put this thing on?

38:30.600 --> 38:32.200
The N-Gage?

38:32.200 --> 38:33.960
Or is it already there?

38:33.960 --> 38:36.480
I mean, the PC is like the last platform

38:36.480 --> 38:39.720
I think this game is coming out on.

38:39.720 --> 38:42.120
You've got a skin editing mode.

38:42.120 --> 38:46.600
You have online score ranking.

38:46.600 --> 38:49.280
It's going to be $19.99.

38:49.280 --> 38:56.920
And there is a pay per play on a, bleh.

38:56.920 --> 39:00.920
You can pay per play, or you can use a free version

39:00.920 --> 39:02.800
that has ads all over it.

39:02.800 --> 39:03.680
Does it have shine in?

39:03.680 --> 39:05.040
That's all I really care about.

39:05.040 --> 39:08.680
I don't know, but I'll get it.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.960
All right, you let me know, and then I'll download it

39:10.960 --> 39:11.960
if it has shine in it.

39:11.960 --> 39:13.720
I'm going on there right now.

39:13.720 --> 39:15.960
Shine in.

39:15.960 --> 39:23.600
Anyways, yeah, because I didn't care what you're talking about.

39:23.600 --> 39:26.480
You're all about shine in on it, because I'm not

39:26.480 --> 39:28.560
going to play the game unless it has shine in.

39:31.160 --> 39:35.320
He's at your home with Bell, so fuck off.

39:35.320 --> 39:37.880
OK, so anyways, as I mentioned earlier in part A,

39:37.880 --> 39:41.920
the Independent Games Festival is kind of wrapping up

39:41.920 --> 39:42.420
here.

39:42.420 --> 39:43.680
They have the finalists announced,

39:43.680 --> 39:45.160
and it's a bunch of cool free games.

39:45.160 --> 39:47.920
So definitely worth checking them out.

39:47.920 --> 39:52.480
Some of the ones that they actually have available there

39:52.480 --> 39:56.320
include some things that you'll see on Xbox Live Arcade soon,

39:56.320 --> 39:56.840
actually.

39:56.840 --> 40:01.240
In fact, they have one by the WIC developer.

40:01.240 --> 40:04.120
I want to say it was Axiom Overdrive,

40:04.120 --> 40:08.240
and that's going to be heading, I know, to live arcade

40:08.240 --> 40:10.960
here pretty soon.

40:10.960 --> 40:13.160
Some of the nominees here, they've

40:13.160 --> 40:16.480
got best web browser game, including

40:16.480 --> 40:20.000
IronDuke, Globus.com, and Triacnid.

40:22.820 --> 40:25.220
Some of the games I've liked that I played here, Excellence

40:25.220 --> 40:26.760
in Visual Art, Clean Asia.

40:26.760 --> 40:28.600
Like I said, it's a good shoot-em-up game.

40:28.600 --> 40:32.120
If you like Warning Forever, you might like that one.

40:32.120 --> 40:34.240
There's also another one that you might like if you

40:34.240 --> 40:36.720
like Warning Forever, which is called Battleships Forever.

40:36.720 --> 40:39.160
It was inspired by that game, and it's another shoot-em-up

40:39.160 --> 40:40.000
game.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.440
So definitely worth checking out.

40:41.440 --> 40:45.040
And also, if you want something to waste some time on,

40:45.040 --> 40:48.320
also check out CRAN Physics Deluxe.

40:48.320 --> 40:51.760
They have CRAN Physics, which you can play for free as well.

40:51.760 --> 40:55.960
Fret Nice, also fun if you've got a Guitar Hero controller.

40:55.960 --> 40:57.840
Highly recommend that game as well.

40:57.840 --> 40:59.120
But anyways, just check it out.

40:59.120 --> 41:05.800
It's at www.igf.com slash 02finalists.html.

41:05.800 --> 41:07.640
And there's a bunch of links to free games,

41:07.640 --> 41:09.440
and also go to all those sites.

41:09.440 --> 41:11.120
You'll notice that there's also more free games on there

41:11.120 --> 41:11.640
as well.

41:11.640 --> 41:13.600
You know, I'm glad we really did that story tonight,

41:13.600 --> 41:15.020
because I think sometimes we don't

41:15.020 --> 41:17.280
give independent games enough loving on this show.

41:17.280 --> 41:20.280
And for as much as we say rah, rah, rah, support

41:20.280 --> 41:21.600
independent podcasting, we should

41:21.600 --> 41:23.520
be talking more and more about independent games.

41:23.520 --> 41:25.280
So we definitely should all take an effort

41:25.280 --> 41:26.880
to check out some of these winners

41:26.880 --> 41:29.360
and talk about them on the show.

41:29.360 --> 41:29.880
Definitely.

41:29.880 --> 41:32.840
And if you're also interested, there's links.

41:32.840 --> 41:36.280
This is a 2008 one.

41:36.280 --> 41:39.840
They also have links for the last 10 years in there.

41:39.840 --> 41:43.800
They're winners, entrants, and mods, and whatnot.

41:43.800 --> 41:46.520
So you can go ahead and check all those out as well.

41:46.520 --> 41:51.120
In fact, last year, one of the winners for Design Innovation,

41:51.120 --> 41:53.880
you might recognize Everyday Shooter.

41:53.880 --> 41:55.640
So that's pretty cool.

41:55.640 --> 41:58.660
Another Audience Award winner from last year,

41:58.660 --> 42:00.760
Castle Crashers.

42:00.760 --> 42:04.800
Also the GameTap Indie Awards, RoboBlitz,

42:04.800 --> 42:06.880
and Everyday Shooter won that as well.

42:06.880 --> 42:09.160
So a lot of these games, play them now,

42:09.160 --> 42:11.680
because you'll probably see them on an online service

42:11.680 --> 42:18.360
like the PlayStation Network or Xbox Live Arcade soon.

42:18.360 --> 42:19.080
All right.

42:19.080 --> 42:21.640
Well, something you might be seeing making a comeback soon

42:21.640 --> 42:25.240
are the franchises MechWarrior, Shadowrun, and Crimson Skies.

42:25.240 --> 42:31.160
Because Jordan Weissman has this new startup company, Smith

42:31.160 --> 42:32.000
and Tinker.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.120
And he basically has licensed back the electronic entertainment

42:35.120 --> 42:39.360
rights to those franchises back from Microsoft.

42:39.360 --> 42:42.720
And basically, these franchises were originally

42:42.720 --> 42:44.600
developed by FASA.

42:44.600 --> 42:46.520
And then Microsoft had it in 1999.

42:46.520 --> 42:49.080
And they recently dissolved that.

42:49.080 --> 42:55.040
So no really plans to further these franchises by Microsoft.

42:55.040 --> 42:57.440
Which is probably good news, because Shadowrun really

42:57.440 --> 42:58.800
didn't get a lot of love.

42:58.800 --> 43:03.000
And it kind of seemed like these series were kind of done for.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.280
But they are a lot of fans, especially Shadowrun.

43:05.280 --> 43:07.360
You look at that, especially the old school

43:07.360 --> 43:09.920
versions of Shadowrun, lots of people love those games

43:09.920 --> 43:11.320
and are very excited at this news,

43:11.320 --> 43:17.800
because maybe this is a sign that these series can

43:17.800 --> 43:19.160
make a comeback.

43:19.160 --> 43:20.600
So who knows?

43:20.600 --> 43:24.400
Of course, the company who just bought them in Jordan Weissman's

43:24.400 --> 43:27.000
group not said anything about it yet.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.920
But you never know.

43:28.920 --> 43:31.020
There is a cryptic posting that says, quote,

43:31.020 --> 43:33.000
our goal is to surprise and delight

43:33.000 --> 43:37.120
old fans while welcoming new fans to these fantastic worlds.

43:37.120 --> 43:40.120
I used to play Shadowrun tabletop,

43:40.120 --> 43:42.360
like the original Shadowrun, which

43:42.360 --> 43:45.400
was RPG, actual D&D-style gaming.

43:45.400 --> 43:47.820
But I'm going to guess you were just totally not interested

43:47.820 --> 43:49.960
in the 360 one that came out recently.

43:49.960 --> 43:50.520
No.

43:50.520 --> 43:51.680
That's what happened with a lot of people.

43:51.680 --> 43:53.520
So I think this is probably good news

43:53.520 --> 43:57.720
that the franchise is back away from Microsoft, who

43:57.720 --> 43:59.360
some would say ruined it.

43:59.360 --> 44:00.440
But you can't win them all.

44:00.440 --> 44:01.840
Microsoft's done a lot of things right,

44:01.840 --> 44:03.280
but sometimes they get them wrong.

44:03.280 --> 44:04.040
Yeah.

44:04.040 --> 44:05.480
We forgive them sometimes.

44:05.480 --> 44:06.160
Sometimes.

44:06.160 --> 44:09.000
If they beg us.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.400
Well, there has been a list released

44:11.400 --> 44:16.160
of the top 20 games in Japan.

44:16.160 --> 44:21.640
This is actually put out by, I think, let me see.

44:21.640 --> 44:24.480
I'm trying to find the list that put it out, Next Gen.

44:24.480 --> 44:26.840
2007 is Japan's top 20 games.

44:26.840 --> 44:28.520
So we're not talking sales-wise, though.

44:28.520 --> 44:30.640
We're talking like it's December,

44:30.640 --> 44:33.840
here comes everybody's top 10 list, and all that stuff,

44:33.840 --> 44:34.360
right?

44:34.360 --> 44:35.880
Well, I've got a top 20, so I'm just

44:35.880 --> 44:36.840
going to sort of skim through it.

44:36.840 --> 44:37.480
Sure.

44:37.480 --> 44:40.960
OK, number 20, DS Literature Companion,

44:40.960 --> 44:43.200
which was on the DS.

44:43.200 --> 44:49.080
And I don't see how that would be interesting,

44:49.080 --> 44:52.720
but they were doing these cartridges for different,

44:52.720 --> 44:56.720
classic Japanese novels, so that you know more about it.

44:56.720 --> 45:00.120
I guess like Cliff Notes or something.

45:00.120 --> 45:06.880
19 was Blade Storm for PS3, and Xbox 360 put out by Koei.

45:06.880 --> 45:10.320
More Dynasty Warriors-ish game.

45:10.320 --> 45:13.000
18 was Vision Training, Flash Focus

45:13.000 --> 45:15.920
on Nintendo DS, which is exactly what it says.

45:15.920 --> 45:18.600
It's little mini games for training your vision.

45:18.600 --> 45:21.800
Wild Arms XF on PSP number 17.

45:21.800 --> 45:25.200
Number 16, Game Center CX on Nintendo DS,

45:25.200 --> 45:29.280
which is by Bandai Namco, which is actually

45:29.280 --> 45:32.600
based off of a TV show.

45:32.600 --> 45:36.520
And let's see, moving forward.

45:36.520 --> 45:42.760
On number 15 is Trusty Bell, which was Eternal Sonata.

45:42.760 --> 45:44.960
I like that game a lot.

45:44.960 --> 45:49.800
14 is Face Training, to where you use the DS

45:49.800 --> 45:53.720
camera to mimic a face.

45:53.720 --> 45:54.960
That sounds stupid.

45:54.960 --> 45:57.840
I know, it's sort of like how to smile a certain way.

45:57.840 --> 46:00.120
It's one of the top games of the year.

46:00.120 --> 46:02.320
13 was Ace Combat 6, which I don't see why,

46:02.320 --> 46:04.480
because it's kind of boring.

46:04.480 --> 46:10.280
12 was Subarashiki Konosekai, It's a Wonderful World

46:10.280 --> 46:12.440
on Nintendo DS.

46:12.440 --> 46:16.040
That's the one by Square Enix that's pretty awesome looking.

46:16.040 --> 46:18.200
I like how the article says, the battle system plays

46:18.200 --> 46:19.880
something like DDR for kids with ADHD.

46:22.520 --> 46:24.040
That's interesting.

46:24.040 --> 46:27.680
11, Treasure Island Z, The Adventures of Zack and Wiki

46:27.680 --> 46:29.080
on Wii by Capcom.

46:32.040 --> 46:34.600
Moving forward.

46:34.600 --> 46:35.540
Come on.

46:35.540 --> 46:36.720
There we go.

46:36.720 --> 46:40.680
10, Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII on PSP.

46:40.680 --> 46:42.320
Like, I have to explain that.

46:42.320 --> 46:45.520
9, Legend of Zelda, The Phantom Hourglass.

46:45.520 --> 46:51.000
8, Armor Dine, which was on PlayStation 2.

46:51.000 --> 46:54.520
Another one of those mecha fighting weird strategy RPG

46:54.520 --> 46:55.840
things.

46:55.840 --> 47:04.040
7, Yusho no Kusei ni Namaihita on PSP,

47:04.040 --> 47:06.800
which is put out by Acquire.

47:06.800 --> 47:10.120
Acquire gave us Tenchu, by the way.

47:10.120 --> 47:13.600
6, No More Heroes, which we were just

47:13.600 --> 47:17.680
going over during our break.

47:17.680 --> 47:20.640
Very interesting looking little game.

47:20.640 --> 47:23.800
And then the last few, the top five.

47:23.800 --> 47:29.120
Number five is Lost Odyssey, Xbox 360.

47:29.120 --> 47:30.960
I've been hearing some not so great things

47:30.960 --> 47:31.880
about Lost Odyssey.

47:31.880 --> 47:36.000
I'm very curious to check it out when it comes out here.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.040
I'm kind of of two minds about it, I'm thinking about it.

47:39.040 --> 47:41.880
Four is Super Mario Galaxy.

47:41.880 --> 47:45.560
Three is Wii Fit.

47:45.560 --> 47:49.800
Two is Professor Layton and the Curious Village on Nintendo DS,

47:49.800 --> 47:51.360
put up by level five.

47:51.360 --> 47:53.720
And number one is Pac-Man Championship Edition,

47:53.720 --> 47:55.520
Xbox Live Arcade.

47:55.520 --> 47:57.680
Interesting.

47:57.680 --> 47:59.280
Interesting choices.

47:59.280 --> 48:02.560
That game gets a lot of play in my house.

48:02.560 --> 48:04.120
I'm actually curious about this.

48:04.120 --> 48:06.320
We were posted a link in chat from Rossdiel UT.

48:06.320 --> 48:09.120
It's a commercial for face training straight out of Japan.

48:09.120 --> 48:11.720
So this ought to be a hoot.

48:11.720 --> 48:16.160
DS, the kono training.

48:16.160 --> 48:23.120
Pokkaku to hou hichiangemasu, ichii, ni, san, shii.

48:23.120 --> 48:25.560
You have to smile and turn your face.

48:25.560 --> 48:32.960
Yoho no mai wo hichiangemasu, ichii, ni, san, shii.

48:32.960 --> 48:39.280
Yojo yutakani isho apu, otona no DS, kao to renin.

48:39.280 --> 48:42.680
My god, it looks like it's creepy.

48:42.680 --> 48:47.880
That commercial's creepy because it makes it seem like we will be

48:47.880 --> 48:52.880
absorbing your brain in five, four, three, two, one.

48:52.880 --> 49:00.280
Are they trying to imply that the Japanese people do not

49:00.280 --> 49:01.200
have emotion?

49:01.200 --> 49:01.840
That's racist.

49:01.840 --> 49:08.760
That they need to, you know, look like everybody else.

49:08.760 --> 49:11.320
You know, it's basically a trainer for pod people

49:11.320 --> 49:14.200
so that we can't see who they are.

49:14.200 --> 49:15.320
That's really what it is.

49:15.320 --> 49:16.620
That's a strange looking game.

49:16.620 --> 49:19.120
All right.

49:19.120 --> 49:21.520
Well, one thing that you won't be smiling about,

49:21.520 --> 49:24.120
well, maybe you will be because I know I haven't been here

49:24.120 --> 49:26.520
in a while, CompUSA.

49:26.520 --> 49:29.480
Apparently, they are shutting down the remaining stores

49:29.480 --> 49:30.480
that they have.

49:30.480 --> 49:39.240
And so yeah, I think closing 126 stores that are left.

49:39.240 --> 49:41.040
Which you know what that means.

49:41.040 --> 49:43.200
Liquidation sales.

49:43.200 --> 49:43.840
Yay.

49:43.840 --> 49:46.480
So make your way down to your local CompUSA

49:46.480 --> 49:49.000
for some sweet deals on old games, I'm sure.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.400
Except for the fact I looked and there's

49:51.400 --> 49:52.880
no more CompUSAs in Sacramento.

49:52.880 --> 49:54.000
They got rid of all of them.

49:54.000 --> 49:54.680
Already, yeah.

49:54.680 --> 49:56.520
Closest ones are in the Bay Area.

49:56.520 --> 49:58.880
So I'm not driving all the way over there just

49:58.880 --> 50:00.760
for some cheap games.

50:00.760 --> 50:03.080
So sorry, CompUSA.

50:03.080 --> 50:04.880
Nice knowing you when you were still around.

50:04.880 --> 50:07.440
We bought one of our computers from CompUSA one time,

50:07.440 --> 50:11.080
like way back in the day, with its whopping one meg of RAM.

50:13.600 --> 50:17.640
Something that some people wish would go away and close down

50:17.640 --> 50:20.320
for business forever is the Dr. Phil show.

50:20.320 --> 50:22.920
Of course, Dr. Phil burned a lot of bridges with gamers

50:22.920 --> 50:24.880
earlier this year with some of his comments.

50:24.880 --> 50:26.960
However, it's very interesting because he

50:26.960 --> 50:30.400
had that show about, well, I guess the whole show

50:30.400 --> 50:32.000
wasn't about Second Life.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.840
But he had the show about shocking teen trends.

50:34.840 --> 50:37.320
And it actually focused on the, I'm sorry,

50:37.320 --> 50:38.600
it actually wasn't Second Life.

50:38.600 --> 50:41.160
It was a Second Life type of game called There.

50:41.160 --> 50:42.880
And I should know There a little better

50:42.880 --> 50:44.360
because one of the folks who used

50:44.360 --> 50:47.120
to come on the show a lot back in the day, DDR Angel,

50:47.120 --> 50:48.440
she was really into There.

50:48.440 --> 50:50.560
And I want to say for a time worked for the company.

50:50.560 --> 50:51.520
She may still even be there.

50:51.520 --> 50:52.480
I don't know.

50:52.480 --> 50:53.800
That's why we haven't heard from her in a while.

50:53.800 --> 50:55.640
Maybe she needs to go on the Dr. Phil show.

50:55.640 --> 50:59.240
No, no, I, that's, well, apparently this girl,

50:59.240 --> 51:01.320
this 13-year-old girl, Lexi, she spends

51:01.320 --> 51:02.600
like all her time on there.

51:02.600 --> 51:05.120
She had a boyfriend in there.

51:05.120 --> 51:07.040
And she had, like, they would make out

51:07.040 --> 51:08.480
on their bed and everything.

51:08.480 --> 51:10.760
Like, she had real feelings for this guy, I think.

51:10.760 --> 51:13.320
So.

51:13.320 --> 51:14.320
Sadly.

51:14.320 --> 51:14.840
What?

51:14.840 --> 51:16.000
I saw the show.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.720
Oh, what?

51:18.720 --> 51:20.200
You watched the Dr. Phil show.

51:20.200 --> 51:22.120
My wife watches the Dr. Phil show.

51:22.120 --> 51:23.720
Oh, and it just happened to be there.

51:23.720 --> 51:26.280
You couldn't, like, you know, go to the other room or anything?

51:26.280 --> 51:28.480
I had already been in the other room the entire day.

51:28.480 --> 51:31.440
So, you know, I have to come out some time

51:31.440 --> 51:35.160
and spend quality time with my wife and also eat dinner.

51:35.160 --> 51:38.840
Well, then, did you have fun watching the Dr. Phil show?

51:38.840 --> 51:40.640
No, because we always make fun of Dr. Phil.

51:40.640 --> 51:42.320
We always mock him.

51:42.320 --> 51:45.320
I'm Dr. Phil, OK?

51:45.320 --> 51:47.760
He's like a lot like Mr. Mackey.

51:47.760 --> 51:52.040
He's like, yeah, I'm Dr. Phil, and you should stop doing that.

51:52.040 --> 51:53.120
Well, what's interesting.

51:53.120 --> 51:55.400
OK, what's interesting is what Dr. Phil, and you

51:55.400 --> 51:56.680
may think that, you know, he's going

51:56.680 --> 51:58.400
to say something kind of narrow-minded and stupid,

51:58.400 --> 52:01.240
but he actually ends up having some pretty decent advice.

52:01.240 --> 52:02.840
He says, quote, because he actually

52:02.840 --> 52:06.920
had the CEO from there come on the show and kind of defend.

52:06.920 --> 52:08.600
So, like, you know, he got all ends of it.

52:08.600 --> 52:11.320
He said, quote, the problem is not with the game.

52:11.320 --> 52:13.400
The problem is the use of it.

52:13.400 --> 52:15.360
The game is very creative, and it's there

52:15.360 --> 52:17.320
for you to use or abuse.

52:17.320 --> 52:19.440
Are you abusing it?

52:19.440 --> 52:20.680
Yeah, and she said yes.

52:20.680 --> 52:22.080
She's like, yes, I am abusing it.

52:22.080 --> 52:24.200
And it's like, oh, OK, that was easy.

52:24.200 --> 52:25.440
And here's the thing.

52:25.440 --> 52:30.120
Mom limited play to four hours a day.

52:30.120 --> 52:32.480
And so Dr. Phil says, four hours a day?

52:32.480 --> 52:33.600
It's ridiculous.

52:33.600 --> 52:36.600
Mom, you've got to step up and shut this down, OK?

52:36.600 --> 52:39.160
Once she's at a point where she can play the game instead

52:39.160 --> 52:41.360
of being absorbed in the game, OK, then

52:41.360 --> 52:44.480
perhaps she can attempt to get back to it.

52:44.480 --> 52:46.320
That was the official advice from Dr. Phil.

52:46.320 --> 52:50.040
So it actually seems like that was good at telling the parent

52:50.040 --> 52:53.200
that the parent needs to pull the plug on the game

52:53.200 --> 52:54.960
and get the kid to do something else

52:54.960 --> 52:58.160
and stop passively accepting it.

52:58.160 --> 53:00.600
Well, the parent is the one paying the credit.

53:00.600 --> 53:02.920
This has a monthly subscription fee, I believe,

53:02.920 --> 53:07.040
where you can buy money in this game using your credit card.

53:07.040 --> 53:09.520
Well, the kid does not have a credit card,

53:09.520 --> 53:14.040
so stop giving her money, you moron.

53:14.040 --> 53:15.760
Wasn't this also the episode of Dr. Phil

53:15.760 --> 53:18.320
that the lawyer of no name was claiming

53:18.320 --> 53:20.800
that he was supposed to be invited to and never

53:20.800 --> 53:23.280
went through with it?

53:23.280 --> 53:24.360
Who cares about that guy?

53:24.360 --> 53:26.520
Yeah, he's going to be disbarred at the end of the year.

53:26.520 --> 53:27.320
So over him.

53:27.320 --> 53:29.000
So over him.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.240
Yeah, he's going to be gone.

53:30.240 --> 53:31.640
He ain't.

53:31.640 --> 53:39.200
Well, there is a new games rating system, a campaign

53:39.200 --> 53:41.760
to be launched for renting the games.

53:41.760 --> 53:46.440
There's a couple of Delaware political folks

53:46.440 --> 53:50.200
are hanging out with the ESRB and trying

53:50.200 --> 53:53.000
to bring out new public service announcements

53:53.000 --> 53:56.520
that these new ratings are supposed

53:56.520 --> 53:59.240
to be adhered to or whatever.

53:59.240 --> 53:59.840
You know what?

54:02.560 --> 54:04.280
Can't they look at the box?

54:04.280 --> 54:06.960
Parents don't know the rating system, I swear.

54:06.960 --> 54:10.080
True story, last night I'm at Walmart

54:10.080 --> 54:12.880
and I'm looking at the Wii games because I kind of still

54:12.880 --> 54:13.880
want to get trauma centers.

54:13.880 --> 54:15.440
I was kind of looking how much they're charging for it

54:15.440 --> 54:17.240
because I was there to get some other stuff.

54:17.240 --> 54:21.120
And there's this parent and the kid is playing Xbox 360,

54:21.120 --> 54:22.680
the little demo kiosk, right?

54:22.680 --> 54:24.080
And he's going, I want this game.

54:24.080 --> 54:24.800
I want this game.

54:24.800 --> 54:26.360
And she goes, well, what's it rated?

54:26.360 --> 54:27.760
So OK, good question.

54:27.760 --> 54:28.880
She says, what's it rated?

54:28.880 --> 54:30.480
And the kid goes, RP.

54:30.480 --> 54:33.240
And the mom's all, what's that mean?

54:33.240 --> 54:34.440
She's all, what does RP mean?

54:34.440 --> 54:34.960
I don't know.

54:34.960 --> 54:35.520
And I'm just kind of thinking to myself.

54:35.520 --> 54:37.640
RP's not even on the list.

54:37.640 --> 54:38.920
It's rating pending.

54:38.920 --> 54:39.800
RP is rating pending.

54:39.800 --> 54:41.880
They do have it on the ESRB poster.

54:41.880 --> 54:44.440
Yeah, but that's what I'll bring to fill the wall.

54:44.440 --> 54:45.360
I've got some ESRB.

54:45.360 --> 54:47.800
That would be a good thing to fill the wall with.

54:47.800 --> 54:49.240
So if any parents watch our show, it reminds me of that.

54:49.240 --> 54:50.440
I have like hundreds of them.

54:50.440 --> 54:53.520
And me being the nosy fucker I am, I jumped in there

54:53.520 --> 54:57.360
and I said, I was like, it means rating pending.

54:57.360 --> 54:59.240
It's like a movie that hasn't been rated.

54:59.240 --> 55:00.240
I was thinking RPGs.

55:00.240 --> 55:01.440
Oh, no.

55:01.440 --> 55:03.640
No, well, that's the thing.

55:03.640 --> 55:04.680
I've been saying this for years.

55:04.680 --> 55:06.320
It should mirror the movie system.

55:06.320 --> 55:10.280
If it said R or PG-13 or not yet rated,

55:10.280 --> 55:11.920
people would know what that meant.

55:11.920 --> 55:13.320
And I said, well, what's the game?

55:13.320 --> 55:15.440
And she said it was Naruto.

55:15.440 --> 55:18.560
And I told her, I said Naruto is based on a cartoon.

55:18.560 --> 55:20.320
The worst thing you're going to see in it is cartoon violence.

55:20.320 --> 55:21.440
It's a team.

55:21.440 --> 55:22.120
It's rated team.

55:22.120 --> 55:23.120
It's rated team?

55:23.120 --> 55:24.280
Why?

55:24.280 --> 55:25.560
Because of cartoon violence.

55:25.560 --> 55:27.000
Because it's beating up?

55:27.000 --> 55:28.120
Oh, whoops.

55:28.120 --> 55:29.960
I told her, I'm like, it's a cartoon.

55:29.960 --> 55:32.520
It's fine for your seven-year-old.

55:32.520 --> 55:33.520
Oops.

55:33.520 --> 55:35.360
Well, that's actually the same thing.

55:35.360 --> 55:37.040
I think that the anime community has

55:37.040 --> 55:40.080
been sort of arguing against people for years now.

55:40.080 --> 55:43.160
That just because it's animated doesn't mean it's for kids.

55:43.160 --> 55:43.660
Hm.

55:43.660 --> 55:44.880
Oops.

55:44.880 --> 55:46.040
Have you seen Perfect Blue?

55:46.040 --> 55:48.440
But I said the worst thing you're going to see in it

55:48.440 --> 55:49.520
is cartoon violence.

55:49.520 --> 55:50.280
Or boobs.

55:50.280 --> 55:51.000
So.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.800
They do not have boobs in Naruto.

55:52.800 --> 55:54.440
They do not have boobs in Naruto.

55:54.440 --> 55:55.920
Yes, they do.

55:55.920 --> 55:58.200
I would like to see this on Cartoon Network.

55:58.200 --> 55:58.680
I mean.

55:58.680 --> 56:03.240
The sexy no-jokes, so yes, you do get boobies.

56:03.240 --> 56:04.320
All right.

56:04.320 --> 56:04.800
Ha ha.

56:04.800 --> 56:07.280
If that were the case, that show would be a lot more popular.

56:07.280 --> 56:09.400
There are cloud-covered boobies, but there's still boobies.

56:09.400 --> 56:10.120
OK.

56:10.120 --> 56:10.640
Yeah, yeah.

56:10.640 --> 56:11.300
Here's the thing.

56:11.300 --> 56:11.800
Look.

56:11.800 --> 56:13.160
DS68 is like Sky.

56:13.160 --> 56:15.000
You know the Japanese anime cartoons,

56:15.000 --> 56:16.200
not necessarily kid safe.

56:16.200 --> 56:19.080
OK, it wasn't La Blue Girl the Game, OK?

56:19.080 --> 56:19.760
It wasn't that.

56:19.760 --> 56:20.760
It was freaking Naruto.

56:20.760 --> 56:21.520
That's rated E.

56:21.520 --> 56:24.960
Which is on a rated EC for early childhood.

56:24.960 --> 56:26.840
Naruto's on freaking Cartoon Network.

56:26.840 --> 56:28.120
I know that.

56:28.120 --> 56:30.600
I didn't think it would be that bad.

56:30.600 --> 56:31.080
Oh, well.

56:31.080 --> 56:32.640
So what's the worst that happens?

56:32.640 --> 56:34.520
Some seven-year-old kid sees boobies.

56:34.520 --> 56:35.320
I mean, come on.

56:39.280 --> 56:41.560
Moving on.

56:41.560 --> 56:43.400
Anyways.

56:43.400 --> 56:45.720
Ding.

56:45.720 --> 56:48.920
I did that on purpose.

56:48.920 --> 56:52.320
So anyways, I love doing that.

56:52.320 --> 56:55.720
A watchdog group, of course, the Nymph,

56:55.720 --> 57:00.520
they've gave the game industry a C. Of course, each year,

57:00.520 --> 57:04.440
they put out their video game report card.

57:04.440 --> 57:06.520
You know, this is like one of those things where,

57:06.520 --> 57:08.960
who the fuck are these people, and why should I care?

57:08.960 --> 57:13.480
Well, they are the National Institute

57:13.480 --> 57:15.720
on Media and the Family.

57:15.720 --> 57:19.760
They basically will do those wonderful undercover stings

57:19.760 --> 57:22.040
where they'll see if people will sell them M-rated games

57:22.040 --> 57:27.200
and stuff like that, or their kids and whatnot.

57:27.200 --> 57:30.600
Really, my thing is, who gives a shit if they're rating?

57:30.600 --> 57:33.040
So if I rated the industry an F, would people

57:33.040 --> 57:34.600
give a shit that I'm rating an F?

57:34.600 --> 57:35.640
No one really cares.

57:35.640 --> 57:38.720
This industry, or watchdog organization, excuse me,

57:38.720 --> 57:40.520
this watchdog organization sounds

57:40.520 --> 57:42.880
like the group in Footloose that told the townspeople they

57:42.880 --> 57:43.960
can't dance.

57:43.960 --> 57:45.840
Something like that.

57:45.840 --> 57:49.400
But apparently, they've conducted a lot of research.

57:49.400 --> 57:51.600
They found that 52% of the parents

57:51.600 --> 57:53.840
claim to use the ESRB rating system,

57:53.840 --> 57:57.920
but 72% know little or nothing about the rating system

57:57.920 --> 58:00.760
overall.

58:00.760 --> 58:03.320
72 plus 52 does not equal 100.

58:03.320 --> 58:04.320
I'm confused.

58:04.320 --> 58:06.840
But people use it, despite the fact

58:06.840 --> 58:08.640
that they don't know anything about it.

58:08.640 --> 58:13.320
That has, so that game's rated M. I like the letter M. Go,

58:13.320 --> 58:14.880
son, you can buy it.

58:14.880 --> 58:16.720
Is that how they do it?

58:16.720 --> 58:18.160
Seriously.

58:18.160 --> 58:20.640
Everybody cut loose, Footloose.

58:20.640 --> 58:24.920
Apparently, undercover shoppers that were under the age of 18

58:24.920 --> 58:31.080
were able to buy M-rated games at nearly 50% of the time.

58:31.080 --> 58:32.800
But really, here's the thing, though.

58:32.800 --> 58:35.880
It's store policy not to sell M-rated games to minors.

58:35.880 --> 58:37.960
There's no law that says they have to do that.

58:37.960 --> 58:39.520
So what's it matter?

58:39.520 --> 58:41.680
And in fact, I would tell them that.

58:41.680 --> 58:42.880
To their faces?

58:42.880 --> 58:46.840
Yes, if I was a person that, oh, you sold me an M-rated game,

58:46.840 --> 58:51.080
and I'm under 18, I'd be like, so?

58:51.080 --> 58:53.400
Loki, you should join one of these watchdog organizations

58:53.400 --> 58:55.400
just for laughs.

58:55.400 --> 58:57.160
Maybe like an undercover report.

58:57.160 --> 59:01.000
What really goes on in these watchdog organizations?

59:01.000 --> 59:03.160
I would like to see a watchdog organization

59:03.160 --> 59:05.680
for the watchdog organizations.

59:05.680 --> 59:06.680
I like that.

59:06.680 --> 59:07.880
I'm going to rate them.

59:07.880 --> 59:09.720
I think this is a fabulous idea.

59:09.720 --> 59:13.720
So what would we call our watchdog organization?

59:13.720 --> 59:14.560
You think about that.

59:14.560 --> 59:15.200
Chat room.

59:15.200 --> 59:16.920
I'm putting that challenge to you guys.

59:16.920 --> 59:18.120
Ooh, ooh, ooh, what?

59:18.120 --> 59:19.400
I know, I know.

59:19.400 --> 59:21.480
Their nymph, I'll be nymph-o.

59:24.920 --> 59:26.040
I like that.

59:26.040 --> 59:27.760
I don't know what the O would stand for.

59:31.160 --> 59:32.280
Overseer, there we go.

59:32.280 --> 59:34.160
That'll work.

59:34.160 --> 59:39.120
I'll be the National Institute on Media and Family Overseer.

59:39.120 --> 59:40.400
Nymph-o.

59:40.400 --> 59:41.680
Love it.

59:41.680 --> 59:44.880
That's beautiful.

59:44.880 --> 59:46.960
That's one of the greatest insights to come.

59:46.960 --> 59:49.280
And the years I've been doing this radio program,

59:49.280 --> 59:53.000
that's one of the greatest, I'll tell you.

59:53.000 --> 59:53.520
Anyhow.

59:53.520 --> 59:55.720
That's lovely.

59:55.720 --> 59:56.360
Oh, RossDielUT.

59:56.360 --> 59:57.560
You did it, too.

59:57.560 --> 59:58.400
I like this.

59:58.400 --> 59:59.000
You did it.

59:59.000 --> 59:59.500
What?

59:59.500 --> 01:00:00.040
You said it.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.400
Oh, forget it.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:02.320
Who cares?

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:05.720
RossDielUT says, the Institute for a Media Whore,

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:06.360
Free America.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:13.320
Dark Tetsuya says, National Institute Media Family, OLR.

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:16.800
Frisbee says, OLR is watching you poop.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:17.960
I don't know about that one.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:20.840
I don't want to watch that.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.640
The hell is wrong with you people?

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.280
OLR is watching you poop in a tube.

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:26.320
That's gross.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.520
I mean, Loki watched those two girls poop in a cup,

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.560
but that's something completely different.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.120
I think a lot of people watch that.

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:34.040
Anyhow, moving on.

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:36.440
Let's talk about Eve Online.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:40.600
This is a game that has quite a bit of a following to it.

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.580
And I know when I was on another show a couple weeks

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:44.800
ago, there was definitely a lot of talk about Eve Online.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:49.760
Well, Eve Online went offline earlier this week.

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:52.760
What happened is that there was a new update that went out.

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:55.280
It was the Premium Trinity patch.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.280
And it went out a little earlier this week,

01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.560
I think about Thursday-ish.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.720
And what happened is that it added a bunch of new features

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:01.440
to the game.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:07.000
But the patch also removed the boot.ini file off

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:15.880
of your Windows XP, which kind of fucks your operating system.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.080
And there was a quote from the official support page.

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:20.880
Quote, if you are only using the classic client

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.400
or installed the premium client using the full premium

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:25.120
installer, then you are not affected.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:28.000
If you upgraded the classic client to the premium client

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.280
using the content upgrade, then please read on.

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:32.120
Check the root directory of your hard drive

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.120
and see if you have a boot.ini file.

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.720
If so, then you are not affected.

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.400
The file is normally hidden, so you

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.240
need to click Tools Folder Options View

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.360
and select Show Hidden Files and Folders

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.440
and uncheck Hide Protected Operating System Files

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.440
to be able to see it.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.920
You can also blah, blah, blah, blah, so on and so on.

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.600
What the fuck were you doing touching

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.920
that file in the first place?

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.920
That's what I want to know.

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:54.640
How did that happen?

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:57.280
Seriously, there's a part of me that goes, some pissed off

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.160
bitch in this organization threw that in there,

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.760
just to fuck with these guys.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:03.320
That's so sad.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.160
I bet she's planning on quitting.

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:09.640
And so, program delete boot.ini.

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.080
Bye, my two weeks are on.

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:15.120
Let me know how the program works.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:15.840
For real.

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:18.040
I quit.

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:20.360
Frisbee says, uh-oh, SpaghettiOs.

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.280
I'll take my severance pay now.

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.720
Have fun storming the castle.

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:30.720
I mean, yeah, don't touch the boot.ini file.

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:33.800
But at the same time, Windows XP should,

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.360
if you're going to delete a file like that, it should go,

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:38.280
are you sure?

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:40.640
Windows XP should have a little dialog box that says,

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:43.080
when you delete this file, you will fuck your whole computer

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:43.640
up.

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:45.680
Are you sure you want to delete this file?

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.640
And a little picture Bill Gates going, no, no, no.

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:48.880
I bet there is something.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:54.520
But even if it does, this person now that I'm imagining

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.680
is going, click yes for, are you sure?

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.520
Rob D says, it sounds like the simcopter bug.

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.120
Do you remember the simcopter bug?

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:08.160
Where it was one of the first appearances of same sex

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.720
relations in the game, because a gay programmer actually

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.320
programmed it in there that guys would kiss guys

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.320
on this guy's birthday.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.640
And then left the company.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.840
That's great.

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.320
It was more than that, I think.

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:24.120
There was a lot more than kissing going on there.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.400
Please, this is a family show.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.320
We don't need to go there.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.360
Right, this is a family show.

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:31.040
This is a dysfunctional family show.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.880
All right, we're going to open up the Skype line

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.340
and welcome the extended members of our dysfunctional family.

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:36.960
That would be you folks, the listeners.

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:41.280
1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.880
And I am dying to see how this works tonight when I only

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:46.160
have half the strength out here on the Wi-Fi network

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.160
out in the garage, and we're trying to stream a show.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.600
This could be very interesting, so we'll see what happens.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.200
Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:56.200
Or our username is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:56.680
We have a call.

01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:57.760
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:58.840
Who's this?

01:03:58.840 --> 01:03:59.920
This is Ravenstaufen.

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:00.800
How are you today?

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.920
I am super.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:02.760
Thanks for asking.

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.160
How are you?

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:06.900
I am fine, and I got two things for you tonight.

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:08.520
You was talking about the Dreamcast?

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.160
We was.

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:13.600
I actually found my Dreamcast, and my brother owned one.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:17.120
So I found my old Dreamcast, and it was see-through.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.280
I don't know why.

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.480
I can't remember why.

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:22.400
But it's see-through, and it's beautiful.

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.280
Because you probably bought a case mod.

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.080
Probably.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:27.840
Or maybe eBay.

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:29.080
I can't remember anymore.

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.200
My memory's fading.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:34.080
They did sell, though, a new case for the Dreamcast

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.760
that you could make that was clear.

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:40.280
And they also sold a bootleg of the Hello Kitty one, too.

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:42.080
Does Rob got that one?

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:43.520
Do I have what?

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:44.880
The Hello Kitty Dreamcast?

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.320
No, I do not have the Hello Kitty Dreamcast.

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.040
I was actually very excited, because I

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:51.200
found that I have two Dreamcasts.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:54.720
But then this guy named Loki said that one of his is his.

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.960
So what's up with that?

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.200
Why am I hearing myself?

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:00.840
Is that better?

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:01.160
Sorry about that.

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:01.960
Yes, much better.

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:04.080
Thank you.

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:05.240
So what else is on your mind?

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:05.880
That was one thing.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:06.480
What's the other?

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:07.000
GameTap.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.120
GameTap's on my mind.

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:09.720
I got a free month from GameTap.

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:10.760
Very nice of them.

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:12.960
You realize they released a Mac client

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.720
to their beautiful GameTap?

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:15.160
I did.

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:15.480
I heard.

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:16.320
Wait, hold on.

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:20.160
Is SimCopter one of the games you can play in the GameTap?

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.360
No.

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:22.760
Oh, it's one of the ones you remove?

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:23.720
Well, here's the thing.

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:25.840
We got linked the Wikipedia article.

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:26.480
Here it is.

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:28.600
The game gained controversy when a designer

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:32.520
inserted sprites of shirtless himbos, male bimbos,

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.440
in speedo trunks.

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.880
I love that term, himbos.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:36.880
I'm going to use that in the sentence every day.

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.920
In speedo trunks, who hugged and kissed

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.840
each other, who appear in great numbers on certain dates,

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:43.680
their fluorescent nipples were drawn

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:46.040
with a special rendering mode.

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:49.080
It's usually reserved for fog-piercing runway landing

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.280
lights, so they could easily be seen from long distances

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:53.640
and bad weathers.

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:55.720
An unintended emergent behavior of the code

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.040
caused hundreds of himbos to swarm and crowd

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.400
around the helicopter, where they would be slashed up

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:01.800
by the blades and then need to be

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:05.240
airlifted to the hospital, which earned the player easy money.

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:07.120
The Easter egg was caught shortly after release

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.560
and removed from future copies of the game.

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.560
Here's how you access it.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.880
And then the designer was fired.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:12.640
He didn't leave.

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:13.560
He got fired.

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.280
Here's how you access it, too.

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.800
Apparently, if you go into the game,

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:19.280
you go into career mode, hit Control-Alt-X,

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:25.960
and then you type in, warp me to career 29, or colon 29.

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:29.240
And then once you've done that, you do Control-Alt-X,

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.760
been there, done that.

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:32.400
And then apparently, in a few seconds,

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:35.680
about 300 guys in bathing suits will appear.

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:38.560
It says, for fun, since there are no military helicopters

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:43.560
in the game, fire tear gas at them.

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.360
That's just wrong.

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:46.720
All right, sorry, Ravenstauffer.

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.600
I agree with that.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.240
I think it was disgruntled someone.

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:52.480
But who the fuck is messing with the frickin' IDF

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:54.480
file to corrupt your computer?

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:58.000
They ever thought to them that it doesn't

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.520
start your operating system?

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.680
So how the hell do you find it in the first place?

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:04.440
Somebody needs to explain funny, not funny.

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:07.760
Deleting my boot INI file, not funny.

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.840
Himbos, funny.

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:12.160
So if you're going to do something disgruntled,

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:14.800
make it funny.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.000
Yeah, but you can't find it.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.800
They said their thing is like, you

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:21.000
can't get in the operating system, how do you find it?

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:21.840
You're screwed.

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.320
You have to use a disk, basically.

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:25.520
So anyhow, I'm sorry.

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:27.680
What was the other thing you wanted to call in about tonight?

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.840
It's about the Mac client of GameTap.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:33.440
There's a brand new Mac client.

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:35.000
I need to check it out.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.260
But do you still have to have the Intel

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:38.800
chip in your Mac for it to work?

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.800
Oh, then never mind.

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.760
Nah, I can't use it.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.000
Lame.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.480
But it's much lighter.

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:47.200
More games run smoothly on the Mac.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.000
And on the Windows side as well, everything

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.440
runs great on both sides.

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:52.720
But now you can't run the Windows-based games

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.440
on the Mac, right?

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:54.760
They just took that category out ahead.

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:55.840
No, no, that's gone.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:56.360
I figured.

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:59.600
The Windows games, so you lost like 800 games on the Mac side.

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:01.320
Oh, Jesus.

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:02.760
Well, but that makes sense.

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:05.040
I mean, but you still get all the arcade games.

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:06.520
You get the Genesis games.

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:07.520
Oh, well, that's cool.

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.840
Atari 2600?

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.040
DOS.

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:11.600
Oh, you get the DOS games?

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:12.800
You get DOS games as well.

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.240
Well, that makes sense because of the chip.

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:15.040
Well, that's cool.

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:15.560
Well, good.

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:16.200
I'm glad.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:17.640
There were a lot of people really pissed off

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.800
about the fact that there was no GameTap Mac client.

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:20.520
So good for them.

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:21.960
I'm making good on that.

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:22.800
I think one thing.

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:26.000
I'm going to add one thing to that.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.360
I got a free month from them, so I'm happy about that.

01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:30.760
Who'd you have to blow to get that?

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:31.240
No one.

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:33.240
I just said I have problems with the PC version.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:37.240
I'm like, well, we'll just add another free month for you.

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:38.920
Dang, I'm going to call GameTap and tell

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:41.440
them I have some problems.

01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:45.200
Yeah, my boot INI file got deleted by your client.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.280
Let's see what happens.

01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:48.240
All right, Raven's Dolphin, any other quick thoughts

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.160
before I let you go and get to somebody else?

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.720
No, but I think that sucks.

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:55.840
How do you get a game like that and just boot a game

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.720
and you go like, well, I got it.

01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:00.080
And then you restart your computer, and you're like,

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:00.880
what the fuck?

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:01.800
What happened?

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:03.440
Yeah, it sucks to be those guys.

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.560
I'm really sorry to all the EVE Online players who

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:06.800
got fucked over by that one.

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:07.440
It sucks to be you.

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:08.680
All right, I'm going back to Godfather.

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:10.600
All right, see you.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.120
All right, if you want to give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:15.160
Our user name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:16.920
We'll also get to some last minute stories,

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:18.400
and then the show is done.

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:20.080
Hooray.

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:21.980
I mean, aw, that's sad, because then there's

01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:23.520
no more OLR till next week.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.000
What are you going to do?

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.880
All right, phone's not ringing just yet,

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:29.200
so let's get a couple of quick last minute stories.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.120
Oh, I lied.

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:31.760
Here it comes.

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:33.120
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.280
Who's this?

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:37.280
Hey, Sky, it's Jonathan F. Your fantasy star whore.

01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:39.240
Well, hello, our fantasy star whore.

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:40.960
How are you?

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:43.640
I'm doing just fine here.

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:46.200
Are you playing the abortion of the aluminous,

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:48.360
or whatever that's called?

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:50.000
Ambition of the aluminous, actually.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.760
I see.

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:54.480
Yeah, you can find me running around with a rappy called

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:55.880
Brightstar.

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:57.720
Anyway, I wanted to just call in,

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:00.080
let you know about some of the big stories that are

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.200
going on right now with this.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:04.600
The first big one is that there's actually

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.600
another expansion coming out.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:10.360
But the thing about this one is that it's for the PSP only.

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:12.000
And funny enough, it's named.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.680
Wait, the PSP?

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:16.360
Yeah, PSP's getting a fantasy star game.

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:18.120
So wait, this can't be an expansion.

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.440
This is a whole new game, right?

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.880
Yeah, it's a whole new game.

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:23.600
Well, basically what it is, it's going

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:25.560
to expand upon the story that's already there

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:28.120
and add some new missions into it.

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.480
And the real funny thing about it

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:31.960
is that when you condense it from its original name,

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:35.520
fantasy star portable, it makes PSP.

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:36.440
Oh, no, there you go.

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:39.080
So PSP on the PSP.

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.280
Exactly.

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:41.800
There you have it.

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:42.320
Interesting.

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.840
So what else is going on in the fantasy star world?

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.800
How was the new expansion received?

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:49.680
Because I know the fantasy star universe kind of

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.480
turned some people off to the series.

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:54.080
It wasn't all that and a bag of chips for some people.

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:57.320
But I guess some of the things they added back in

01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.880
with this expansion are supposedly

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:02.480
making the game a little more kind of like it used to be?

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:03.280
Exactly.

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:06.960
In fact, go ahead.

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:08.640
I'm sorry, go ahead.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.600
Oh, OK.

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.800
Basically what's coming back in this version,

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:15.600
actually, starting in just a couple of short weeks

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:18.680
here in Japan, or over in Japan, I mean,

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:22.240
there's going to be an event called the Maximum Attack G,

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.880
whereby they are bringing back some of the original fantasy

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.200
star online stages.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.560
Now that could be kind of cool.

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.760
I know.

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.680
They're going to bring back Cave.

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:37.000
And what were the names of those stages in the old one?

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000
They had Cave and, what, Ship?

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.120
Well, yeah, the Forest Cave, Mines, and Ruins,

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:45.160
they are all confirmed at this point, pretty much.

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:48.320
Wow, that's kind of cool.

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.640
Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any episode two, three,

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.600
or four stages coming back.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:53.200
But who knows?

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:55.400
That could be for yet another expansion.

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:56.800
You know, I need to get back.

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.080
You know what, dammit, I am getting

01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.920
so sick of some of the MMOs I'm playing now,

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:01.880
I think I need to give PSU another shot.

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:03.760
I think I need to give this game another shot.

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:04.280
I really do.

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:05.080
You want mine?

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:05.580
Huh?

01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:06.160
You want mine?

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.160
No, I have the game.

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:09.360
Oh, I was going to burn mine.

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.160
I was thinking about, wait, how much

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:15.960
does Abortion of the Illuminous cost to download on Xbox?

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:19.640
I think it was 2,000 points.

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:20.880
I'm trying to remember.

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:21.720
That's not too bad.

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:23.040
That's about 20 bucks.

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.960
I don't know, I'll have to think about it.

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.640
You know what, there was some things about PSU I kind of miss.

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:28.880
It wasn't horrible.

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:29.640
So I don't know.

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:31.400
I miss PSO.

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:33.720
I heard there, you know what, we got news coming in.

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:34.640
Is this true?

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:37.080
That they're shutting off Blue Burst is going on.

01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:37.580
No.

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:39.640
Yeah, so it's going to be the next thing.

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:43.080
The US Blue Burst servers are going down.

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.640
That's stupid, because I was actually

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.180
going to start playing that again.

01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:49.680
Go ahead.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.600
Yeah, one of the big questions right now

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:56.480
is, is the clumsy orbit and the rest of the GM team

01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:00.060
going to try to get in contact with the Japanese team

01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:02.760
to see if they can merge our characters over?

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.840
As far as I know, there hasn't been a response yet,

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.680
but they've at least passed the idea over.

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:14.400
Because I still have Blue Burst installed on my computer,

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:18.000
and I still have an account with active characters on it.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.920
Yeah, and basically it shuts down in March.

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:24.920
Well, sorry to hear it.

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:25.880
How dare they?

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:27.880
All right, well, we've got to let you go here

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:28.960
as soon as we get some more calls,

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:30.800
but any last thoughts from our Phantasy Star

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:32.640
horror, Jonathan F?

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:33.480
Just one thing.

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.080
I wanted to announce a little project

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:38.280
I'm working on for the 20th anniversary of Phantasy Star.

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.080
Oh, go for it.

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:43.280
It's called Phantasy Star Dreams Forever.

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:46.280
And basically what it is, it's a remix album,

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:48.480
which basically goes through the history of Phantasy

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:51.200
Star from the original Sega Master System game

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:53.560
all the way up to Phantasy Star Universe.

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.800
And it's going to be a track list of about 108 tracks

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:58.280
that's going to basically be all developed by the community.

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:00.640
I'm just going to take more of a general manager position

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:03.880
on things here, aside from maybe just a couple of contributions.

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:06.920
And you can read up all the details at the website

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:21.380
phantasystarmun

01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:27.360
online right now, if you want, I'll send you a link to it

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.360
through the chat.

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:29.360
Do that.

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:30.360
All right.

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:31.360
Please do.

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:32.360
All right.

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:33.360
Thanks you so much.

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:34.360
And have fun with Phantasy Star.

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:35.360
Maybe see you soon.

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:36.360
All right.

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:37.360
Always glad to be on the show.

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:38.360
All right.

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:39.360
Take care, buddy.

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:40.360
Jonathan was out here a long time ago.

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:41.360
Remember him?

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:42.360
He came out here a long, long time ago,

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:43.360
and he was talking about tech TV and stuff.

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:44.360
It was pretty good.

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:45.360
I'm glad to hear he's listening again.

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.360
All right.

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:47.360
Call us.

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:52.080
We're on Game OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:53.560
Let's get some last minute stories real quick.

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:54.560
Loki.

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.560
They're breaking the studio.

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:56.560
I know.

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.560
They're throwing away.

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.560
Look, the stuffed animals are there to look cute,

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.560
not to be thrown.

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:01.560
I don't care if all that is off.

01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:03.800
One last minute story here real quick.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:11.700
Apparently a dad has caught, or there was a dad who caught his son smoking pot.

01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:15.480
So what he did was he put his son's Guitar Hero 3 Christmas gift

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:19.720
up on eBay to punish him.

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:21.360
That's news.

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.360
That is news.

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.360
That's smart.

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.360
That's great parenting.

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:25.840
That is wonderful parenting.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.000
I love it.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
It's actually still on eBay right now.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Nice.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Who's this?

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000
It's like Yuzaku.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Hey, Yuzaku.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000
What's on your mind?

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:42.840
Nah, just nothing chilling, you know, going through the gaming league as usual.

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:43.840
All right.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:44.840
Let me rephrase the question.

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.600
How much do we owe this telephone call tonight?

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:48.320
I don't know.

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:55.720
The usual arrow smashing news, like how Supernova 2 is supposed to come out this month, and

01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:02.600
the fact that Betsun is being dicks about holding EMUs back.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:07.080
Yeah, I guess I've heard about Supernova 2, but I want to share with you my revelation

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:08.080
I had the other day.

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:10.760
Can I talk to you man-to-man a little bit?

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:15.200
Here's a revelation I had the other day, is that I was on Xbox Live and I was playing

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:19.160
Portal because I've been playing Portal a lot this week, and my buddy Shane used to

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:24.760
work at Konami, had a big part in DDR, and he doesn't live here in California, he lives

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:29.200
in Kansas, so we talk a lot over Xbox Live, and I noticed that he was playing DDR Universe

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:33.480
2, and he sent me a message on Xbox Live and he said, you know, Universe 2, blah blah blah,

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:37.360
and he was telling me his thoughts on the game, and I came to a realization, Zaku, and

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:40.080
that realization was, I'm kind of over DDR.

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:43.080
I really am.

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:46.360
There's not a lot that I care about that's going on in DDR anymore.

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:52.160
I'm not getting a boner over Supernova 2 like a lot of people are, and it's sad to say,

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:56.320
because obviously without DDR the show would not exist, without DDR I would not know Jamie,

01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:01.680
without DDR I would not know Loki, without DDR I would not know Puppy, DDR has fucked

01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:06.680
up my life in so many good ways, and bad, I mean, because there was that house I lived

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:08.800
in five years ago, but that's a whole other story.

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.960
In the real world, Rob edition.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:11.960
Oh my god.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:12.960
Oh wow.

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:18.680
That's not so bad, I mean, people grow out of it, people stay on, and move on with their

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:19.680
lives.

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:22.240
Zaku, I didn't grow out of DDR.

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:23.600
Just don't care about it as much anymore.

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:27.600
DDR has refused to change over the past five years.

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:28.920
That's the problem I'm having with it.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:32.760
It's the same fucking game I played five years ago, and I'm just kind of done with it.

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:37.360
Yeah, but I mean, I know people, most of the people that I know that used to, you know,

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:41.160
they're like some of the best in the city, they don't play as much anymore, they pretty

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:42.560
much moved on.

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:49.200
I'm telling you, if Konami wants to bring me back, they just need to innovate the game.

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:50.320
It's possible.

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:54.320
They're trying to do it in little ways on the consoles, but they need to do it in a

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.400
major way in the arcade, and bring people back.

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:59.840
I mean, yeah, in the arcade they tried EMUs, but there's other factors that are holding

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:00.840
it back.

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:05.520
From what I hear, Betson is the reason why it's not happening in this country at all.

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:14.640
They don't believe that it's going to be successful, but I know Konami tries their damn hardest

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:20.600
and it's just other folks that are just being dicks about it, and they're just non-believers

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:26.040
and it's like they don't really give a shit about it.

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:27.640
I wish I knew more about programming.

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:32.120
I would want to design my own music game that was dancing that's not a rip-off of DDR or

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:33.240
In the Groove, or any of that stuff.

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:35.840
I have a lot of ideas floating around my head for the past five years.

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:36.840
I just wish I could do it.

01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:37.840
What?

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:40.200
Why don't they make a Para Para game without Para Para music?

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:44.880
Because I remember when fucking Prestige used to fucking break out the Para shit, that was

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:45.880
kind of cool-looking.

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:52.320
Granted, you know, people make fun of it just like DDR, but it was a little different.

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:56.640
Or they could just add a Ticket Redemption game to DDR and there you go, it's going to

01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:57.640
sell.

01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:00.440
Oh, just throw it in a grave while you're at it.

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:02.440
Ever heard of that game Spider Stomp?

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:09.320
Those red buttons on the floor, and you get tickets out of them, and they light up.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:14.800
Isn't that pretty DDR a little bit more than it already is?

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:19.360
Zaku, let me tell you this too, this is just going to make you cry even more.

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:24.920
I'm very sorry, but I have to admit, okay, when we went to John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza,

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:27.520
they have a DDR Supernova machine there, right?

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:29.280
And we were like, oh, Supernova.

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:33.600
But then I looked to my left, and I was like, oh my god, they have Jumpin' Jackpot!

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:36.640
And I ran over, and I played Jumpin' Jackpot!

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:42.040
Last time I played Supernova was yesterday, and then before that it was like, you know,

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:43.040
weeks.

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.760
I could go, I literally just threw up the line.

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:49.760
We saw the DDR machine, and Dan and I were like, because my husband was here with us,

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:57.040
we were like, hey look, it's the new, oh shoot, Airplane Game, After Burner.

01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:02.000
And we spent most of the time either on the After Burner or on that ride that William

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000
and I rode.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.440
Not even that, I mean, I'm also getting into other arcade games like Wangan, I'm playing

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:14.640
more Initial D now, so I mean, and I'm playing a lot more other Hermione games, so I mean,

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:18.200
DDR is not really this much of an aspect in my life as it would be.

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:22.840
Sure, I mean, I try to go out to, you know, most of the tournaments, but as far as, you

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:25.520
know, trying to get better, it's the least of my worries right now.

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:29.720
Well see, I got the thing though, another thing there about DDR tournaments, that's

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:35.040
another thing that hasn't changed in years because it's already hit that plateau where

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:38.120
everybody's getting triple A's in the last couple years.

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:43.880
In the group, right, you know, R21, folks are able to innovate it by just creating pure

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:46.840
sight read tournaments through custom songs.

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:52.240
I just went to one yesterday where they had like about 18 songs, 18 brand new, you know,

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:58.040
18 sim files never before released until that day, and it was just a pure sight read, you

01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:00.400
know, sight read tournament that just flexed out the ability to do that.

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:04.520
I can't get too excited about people putting sim files on a cabinet and then saying, ooh,

01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:06.120
it's never been released before!

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:10.680
That's a little different than Konami saying, hey, look at this bitches, Supernova 3, yeah,

01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:14.040
we're going to have the final round, that shit, now that's exciting, we got to wrap.

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:18.600
That's one aspect, you could argue with that, I mean, it's an aspect of, you know, how our

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:25.000
arrow smashers were, you know, for a better of a word, just, you know, continue the community

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.320
or they just, you know, they just stay active.

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:31.560
Here's the thing, and we got to get this call wrapped up so we can move on, take some more

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:37.280
calls, but I will always have a soft, warm, fuzzy, cute spot in my heart for Bemani in

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:42.080
general as well as DER for the many like good things the community brought, but if the game

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:44.480
doesn't adapt, it's going to die.

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:50.600
It is dying, currently, and the game has to adapt for it to survive, and I don't mean,

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:59.280
oh my god, I got sent pictures of that, my first DDR, like, if that's adapting, then

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:00.280
I want off the boat.

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:05.400
That's basically Konami's intent of trying to, you know, suck money out of the dry, and

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:11.360
eventually, remember, it's kind of like oil, it's not going to last forever, so, I mean,

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:17.200
it has to find an alternative means of just keeping the series alive by trying to please

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:18.480
as many people as possible.

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:22.800
I've got to let you go, buddy, Zaku, but thank you for bringing up Bemani, as you usually

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:28.240
do, and, you know, kind of allowing me to share my revelations with you.

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:31.040
I was going to bring up other things, but I had to get it out.

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:32.120
It's all right.

01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.120
Next time, Zaku.

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:34.120
I'll talk to you next time.

01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:35.120
All right.

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.200
We'll do one more call, if anything comes through.

01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:38.200
877-GAME-OLR.

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:41.560
Yeah, that will play social commentary about oil, too.

01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:42.560
No more stories?

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:43.560
Really?

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:44.560
Jamie, you have anything?

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:45.560
Today's boring week.

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:46.560
This is boring.

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:47.560
All right.

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:48.560
Well, then one more call, and we'll call it a show.

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:52.840
Have you seen, read the story that came up a couple days ago about that new PSP game

01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:55.040
called, I think it's Potsipon.

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:58.160
It's like another, like a, it's like a music game where you have all these little armies

01:22:58.160 --> 01:22:59.160
of creatures.

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:02.440
Is that related to Panledipon, which is, um, no, okay.

01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:03.920
It's a little bit different.

01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:08.560
It looks like, I don't know, it's a little stretch, but looks like LocoRoco, a little

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:09.560
bit.

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:10.560
Hmm.

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:13.560
You know, I'm actually looking in chat, and caller, just hold on just a minute, we'll

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:16.440
get to you in a second, because I picked up a call and I haven't acknowledged them yet,

01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:19.600
but, um, let's see, I'm just looking at some interesting, because obviously a lot of our

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:23.180
hardcore listeners have been listening to us since the days where we were like nothing

01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:24.180
but BomaniTalk.

01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:28.520
GS191 says, the problem with DDR in arcades is basically that arcades are basically dead

01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:30.660
and nobody wants to do shit about it.

01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:34.560
The problem with DDR console releases is that the music is way too mainstream and alienates

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:41.180
the core audience, um, and Jaded says, because the concept is overdone, but the music concept

01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:42.180
is great.

01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:47.040
Um, and I, you know, I kind of, I kind of agree a little bit, a little bit, although

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:51.560
there is some type of allure to being able to play like popular radio songs on there,

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:57.640
I do think that DDR kind of opened my eyes, so to speak, to a whole other genres of music

01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:01.520
that I didn't know existed before, you know, and some of those, you know, and who could

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:07.040
forget, I, I, I, I'm your little butterfly, who could forget how catchy that freaking

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:10.920
song was the first time they heard it, except for Loki, you're just Mr. Negative, or Boom

01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:16.200
Boom Dollar, or you know, just a variety of music that was in that game, and that, I think

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:20.440
the Dance Maniacs series in general that kind of brought us a lot of music has been lost

01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:22.440
over the past few years, which is kind of sad.

01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:26.840
Because after, you know, after I started playing DDR for the first year or so, I actually started

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:31.440
going out and looking up these artists and finding what other music they had, and you

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:37.160
know, finding some good stuff that I still listen to, but it's kind of a, it just opens

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:38.640
your eyes a little bit.

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:43.640
Well, the whole, the going to the Dance Mania CDs, all they are now is just more rehashes

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:44.640
of the same.

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:45.640
Yeah.

01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:46.640
They're not exciting.

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:50.920
But then I look at UltraMix 2, and that opened my eyes to the whole synth pop, and what,

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:54.120
you know, indie, different drum label stuff, and there's some awesome music on there, and

01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:57.160
some of the bands that were in UltraMix 2 are like my favorite bands right now.

01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.160
It's good stuff.

01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:01.720
Anyway, I just want to say real quick, Rob D in chat says, I disagree with that.

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:03.560
I just think that DDR needs something new.

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:07.000
Releasing games with new songs just isn't going to cut it, and that's absolutely what

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000
I'm saying too.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000
That's absolutely what I'm saying.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.520
All right, anyway, let's, I'm sorry, I've made our caller wait.

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:12.520
Caller, are you still there?

01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:13.520
Uh, yeah.

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:14.520
Hi, who is this?

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:15.520
It's GS68.

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:16.520
Hi, GS68, what's on your mind?

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:17.520
Sorry to make you wait.

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:18.520
Uh, yeah.

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:26.480
I've read about Super Smash Bros. Brawl online, and it's looking good.

01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:29.480
I'm sorry, you read it, you're cutting out a little bit, you read about it online, and

01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:31.400
it is looking good, or it isn't?

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:32.400
It isn't.

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.560
I just sent you a link to show you why.

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:36.160
Okay, let me look at this.

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:39.040
Why, and in your mind, why is this not looking good?

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.040
Is this about the friend codes?

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:45.240
Well, for example, if you get disconnected, and the CPU takes over, like, no one will

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:49.960
know that you disconnected, I mean, they'll keep on thinking that it's the same person,

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:54.960
which really bugs me, because now you can't tell if someone will have a, just plain computer

01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:55.960
instead.

01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:56.960
Yeah, but here's the thing, though.

01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:59.800
I don't know if it's not really indicating that the person's disconnected, or that it

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:03.800
might say they've disconnected, but the computer player's still being, or the player is being

01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:05.680
controlling the computer now.

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:07.240
That is, that is a very good point, yeah.

01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:09.880
I read about that earlier this week, where basically, just to recap for those who may

01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:14.240
not have heard, if you get disconnected, or your, you know, your Wii gets shut off, or

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:17.280
your power goes off, or whatever, in the middle of a match, you lose connection, the computer

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:21.080
will automatically take control of your character, so you're not having to wait, there's no buffer,

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.080
anything like that.

01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:25.560
It's just that the computer takes over, but I understand what GSCCA is saying, is that,

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:29.480
you know, how does this, you know, if all the players disconnect, and you're fighting

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:33.560
the computer, how does online play differ from versus at all?

01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:40.300
Yeah, exactly, and plus, since no one knows that you disconnected, like, there's no shame

01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:43.480
in disconnecting anymore.

01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:46.560
That is true, there should be a swift kick in the butt for when you disconnect.

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:47.560
But hopefully...

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:50.640
But it's gonna reflect on their, their ranking, their stats, right?

01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:57.240
Actually, no, you won't, you won't see their names or anything, like, so you won't know

01:26:57.240 --> 01:26:58.440
who you're fighting in.

01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:02.480
I think that they're gonna address this stuff, I mean, this, what they've shown so far, they're

01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:06.480
just kinda going over features, they haven't really delved into the details of what's gonna

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:07.480
be available on this.

01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:11.800
I love it, Jonathan F. says, send in Mr. Resetti if they disconnect.

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:12.800
Brilliant idea.

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:15.920
And Mr. Resetti's in there, isn't he?

01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:16.920
He is.

01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:17.920
So, there you go.

01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:22.400
But, you know, the Wii online stuff in general just kinda sucks, like, it really needs an

01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:28.440
upgrade or a backbone or something, because, like, I think, I think Nintendo's, go ahead,

01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:33.520
I think Nintendo's, like, trying to make online accessible for everyone, but in doing so,

01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:35.680
they're oversimplifying online.

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:39.160
But let me tell you, okay, two stories for you.

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:43.680
Hey, I'm in Geometry Wars Galaxies, and Geometry Wars Galaxies has online leaderboards, which

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:44.680
is kinda cool.

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:48.080
You can go there, you register your name when you first go on, you can go look at the leaderboards.

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:52.840
But here's the thing, you can look at the leaderboards for the top ten scores or where

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:55.240
you are on the leaderboards, and that's it.

01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:59.600
And you're just looking at a big list of names that mean nothing to you, because you can't

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:04.240
filter the list by the friends on your Wii, you can't filter the list by anything but

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:07.320
those things, so it's kinda pointless, it's kinda stupid.

01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:11.820
I applaud Bazaar for trying to, you know, but I get the feeling they're just really

01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:15.240
restricted by Nintendo's lack of an online mainframe.

01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:20.280
Well, that whole thing with the leaderboards is the same for Ghost Squad and the new Trauma

01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:21.760
Center as well.

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:26.600
Oh, I guess, well, yeah, I guess that's true, I forgot, Trauma Center has the leaderboards

01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:27.600
too.

01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:28.600
So.

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:31.960
At least I recognized a couple names on the leaderboards.

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:32.960
Did you?

01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:36.760
Yeah, because they're from Game Facts, and I posted on Game Facts.

01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:37.760
Gotcha.

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:38.760
There you go.

01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:40.080
I feel sorry for you for posting on Game Facts.

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:43.440
Well, maybe there's some of that going on with Geometry Wars too, but my name on there

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:48.240
is Rob O-L-R. At first I was just Rob, but then when I saw what the leaderboards looked

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:52.180
like, I'm like, oh, I should be Rob O-L-R. But also, you don't automatically get your

01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:56.040
scores posted to the leaderboards, you have to go in, connect to the Wi-Fi connection

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:59.420
and all that BS before your score finally gets posted.

01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:03.680
That's what really, that's what kinda tells me that it's not Bazaar's fault or, you know,

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:08.240
the people that made the game, it's, you know, Nintendo's fault for having a weird online

01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:09.240
system.

01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:10.240
So.

01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:11.240
Anyhow.

01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:13.600
Anything else you want to share with listeners tonight?

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:14.600
Um, no.

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:15.600
All right.

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:17.920
Well, thank you very much for calling and listening to the show.

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:18.920
We appreciate it.

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:19.920
Have a good one.

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:20.920
You too.

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:21.920
Bye bye.

01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:22.920
All right.

01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:27.140
Well, I guess that is going to be it for the calls tonight, and that's going to bring our

01:29:27.140 --> 01:29:30.640
show to a close as well, but thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening tonight.

01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:31.920
Let's get to everybody's final thoughts.

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:35.960
Puppy, thank you for being here, and I hope you enjoyed the new studio and the...

01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:37.840
It's much easier to breathe in here.

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:39.000
Yes, it is.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.680
It's not nearly as uncomfortable as all cramming into an eight-foot space.

01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:43.680
Exactly.

01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:45.920
Well, any final thoughts, sir?

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:51.240
Um, I am not looking forward to the next three months of class.

01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:52.920
Sorry to hear it.

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:55.720
Loki, anyways, what's your final thought?

01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:59.520
I'm buying computer parts.

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:04.680
My final thought is I want pie again.

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:06.760
I say that every week, but I really, really do want pie.

01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:09.160
I have frozen pies in my freezer right now.

01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:10.440
Well, did you bring one with you?

01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:11.440
I did not.

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:12.440
Bastard.

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.920
I also have Smirnoff's too.

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:15.440
Dark Soccer.

01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:16.440
Was that you?

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:18.960
We were playing rock band last night, and you're like, yeah, I've just been having two

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:19.960
Smirnoff's.

01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:20.960
This should be fun.

01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:21.960
Yeah.

01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:22.960
It was fun.

01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:23.960
Yeah, I played rock band this week too.

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:24.960
It was a good time.

01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:25.960
So we did a whole band last night.

01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:27.800
Anyway, Dark Soccer, your final thought?

01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:31.200
I just got a message on MySpace from some guy I went to high school with.

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:34.680
Was it somebody you want to hear from or not?

01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:40.600
I messaged him once and forgot that I did it, and then like, you know, six months later,

01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:42.600
he's messaging me back.

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:43.600
So I think it's kind of funny.

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:45.640
Now that is not checking your MySpace regularly.

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:46.640
Well, no.

01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:47.640
It's too bad.

01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:48.640
No.

01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:49.640
All right.

01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:51.320
Anyhow, I guess that's it.

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:53.400
We're going to call it a show.

01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:56.520
Thank you guys so much for downloading us and supporting independent podcasting.

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:57.560
We couldn't do it without you guys.

01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:01.240
If you like what you hear, please tell two friends about the program or two enemies.

01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:04.440
We really don't care who it is just as long as the word gets out there because then we

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:06.120
can slowly take over the world.

01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:08.120
We will see you next week.

01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:13.400
Same bat time, same bat channel.

01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:14.400
Do we know kind of anything?

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:19.580
Hopefully, we're going to do a game next week or something, kind of mix things up a little

01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:20.580
bit.

01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:23.720
I don't know if we're going to have any guests or anything in the studio, but we'll try for

01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:24.720
you guys.

01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:25.720
Yay.

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:26.720
So we'll see.

01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:28.200
We'll see you next week, puppy, if you can.

01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:30.480
I will try to if I'm not dead.

01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:31.480
If you're not dead.

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:32.480
Why is my phone ringing?

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:33.480
I don't know.

01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:34.480
All right.

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:35.480
Have a good week, everybody.

01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:36.480
