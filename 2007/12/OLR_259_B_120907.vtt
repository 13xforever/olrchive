[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

00:20.553 --> 00:21.394
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio

00:35.112 --> 00:35.933
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:02.651 --> 01:03.792
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Smash Bros.

01:32.020 --> 01:36.306
[SPEAKER_14]: and they haven't really said exactly when, but it's going to be quarter two of next year.

01:36.467 --> 01:39.411
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, I don't know.

01:39.571 --> 01:43.317
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not good, I guess, but at least you're not waiting until Christmas of next year.

01:43.597 --> 01:47.383
[SPEAKER_14]: But aren't the Brits kind of used to getting screwed like this in a way, you know?

01:48.150 --> 01:59.276
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, maybe, but here's the thing though, I don't really see what they, I mean, other than changing the screen resolution and stuff that it renders at, you're not really localizing it for Europe, so.

01:59.356 --> 02:05.579
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to know, like, are they having to, you know, produce extra copies and that takes so freaking long, or what is it?

02:05.659 --> 02:07.440
[SPEAKER_14]: What causes things to be so slow?

02:07.460 --> 02:07.740
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get it.

02:07.760 --> 02:14.664
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess it's just, you know, changing some of the programming, because, I mean, if you think about it, a lot of the games that they get in Europe we don't get over here for a while, so.

02:16.165 --> 02:16.925
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that kind of sucks.

02:17.250 --> 02:19.791
[SPEAKER_04]: MacMan says, Europe, the shaft of the gaming world.

02:19.811 --> 02:21.831
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I know we have quite a few people over there that listen.

02:21.851 --> 02:22.832
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure aren't happy about this.

02:22.852 --> 02:25.212
[SPEAKER_14]: They've already gotten some games we haven't had over here yet.

02:25.252 --> 02:32.134
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, they have Endless Ocean already, which, you know, I'm sure given the opportunity, they would say, fuck Endless Ocean, let's get Super Smash Bros.

02:32.214 --> 02:37.596
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, they do get a few games before we do, so... I don't know.

02:37.976 --> 02:42.077
[SPEAKER_04]: RossDLUT in chat says, Loki, menus and stuff need to be made in other languages.

02:42.297 --> 02:42.937
[SPEAKER_04]: Any announcer?

02:43.917 --> 02:45.978
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, true, but I mean, still though...

02:46.938 --> 02:48.419
[SPEAKER_14]: for, like, some of the territories.

02:48.459 --> 02:51.980
[SPEAKER_14]: They can release it in the English-speaking territories and stuff like that.

02:52.100 --> 03:00.384
[SPEAKER_14]: And also a lot of the games like, you know, Excite Truck and that kind of thing, when they were putting them out, they develop them for, like, usually it's English, Spanish, and French, I think.

03:01.285 --> 03:05.566
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially, all the Nintendo titles seem to be English, Spanish, and French even when they come out over here.

03:05.747 --> 03:05.987
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

03:06.147 --> 03:11.489
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, Canada and Mexico, you need French for Canada and Spanish for Mexico, so, you know, it's kind of like a region.

03:11.509 --> 03:14.711
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I wouldn't think that that would, I mean, hold them back really too much.

03:15.651 --> 03:15.771
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

03:17.253 --> 03:23.804
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, sorry Europe, it looks like you're going to get screwed there, but we'll tell you how fun it is.

03:24.044 --> 03:25.106
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding, that's so mean.

03:26.881 --> 03:36.947
[SPEAKER_04]: One, I guess, interesting kind of piece of news is that Nintendo is kind of, in a way, fessed up that they're not able to meet the needs of the Wii demand that's out there.

03:36.987 --> 03:43.791
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how the Wii seems to be, once again, for the second year in a row, the hot holiday toy that everybody's dying to get.

03:44.551 --> 03:48.373
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo has decided to pull ads for its Wii console.

03:48.613 --> 03:53.196
[SPEAKER_04]: And this story is out of the UK, actually, although I do believe it affects everybody.

03:53.816 --> 03:59.600
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo is actually going to be redistributing the commercials they had scheduled up until Christmas through the first quarter of 2008.

04:00.120 --> 04:09.586
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo spokesman said, "...we have been running the campaign all year round, but we want to take a responsible stance this Christmas and not fuel demand."

04:10.665 --> 04:17.171
[SPEAKER_04]: An ad industry insider said, Production has been stepped up to 1.8 million units a month and Nintendo still cannot meet the demand.

04:32.470 --> 04:37.133
[SPEAKER_04]: According to RawSteelUT in chat, eBay vultures are the only people buying the systems.

04:37.494 --> 04:41.697
[SPEAKER_04]: Sad but true, there probably are quite a few of those folks buying it.

04:41.757 --> 04:44.679
[SPEAKER_04]: RawSteelUT also says software sales are still pathetic.

04:44.959 --> 04:45.439
[SPEAKER_04]: You know why?

04:45.639 --> 04:46.480
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a theory why.

04:47.062 --> 04:50.003
[SPEAKER_04]: because most people that are buying that system are perfectly content with Wii Sports.

04:50.643 --> 04:58.806
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people are buying this just for Wii Sports, especially when you start to look at the older crowd and the more casual gamers.

04:59.166 --> 05:04.907
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the enabling game for the Nintendo Wii, and when it comes with the system, people don't think they need anything else.

05:05.227 --> 05:09.089
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, back in the day when we were buying 8-bit Nintendo systems with Super Mario Bros.

05:09.149 --> 05:11.949
[SPEAKER_04]: and Duck Hunt, did we buy another game to go with it?

05:12.050 --> 05:12.930
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily.

05:12.990 --> 05:13.510
[SPEAKER_04]: Not always.

05:13.590 --> 05:16.091
[SPEAKER_04]: Many kids found just that pack under their tree for Christmas.

05:16.111 --> 05:16.911
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

05:18.093 --> 05:26.745
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, granted, I would also humor probably the implied statement there that there's not a lot of must-have software on the Wii right now outside of maybe like Mario Galaxy.

05:26.785 --> 05:32.613
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there's a lot of good games out there, but there's a lot more really crappy games, and it's really hard to tell.

05:33.587 --> 05:34.147
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

06:03.089 --> 06:05.030
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it'll be a little bit easier?

06:05.530 --> 06:06.010
Little bit?

06:06.590 --> 06:07.210
[SPEAKER_04]: But probably not.

06:07.270 --> 06:09.971
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably want to get online in the stock inventory.

06:10.631 --> 06:12.652
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, some of us waited in line.

06:13.772 --> 06:14.272
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

06:14.612 --> 06:19.314
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet all the Nintendo fanboys and fangirls waited in line day one anyway, and they're just looking at this and laughing.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.874
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of us just didn't care to buy a Wii.

06:23.275 --> 06:25.195
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true, and some people are like, eh, fuck Wii.

06:25.395 --> 06:28.096
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I should tell you, my mom told me she wanted a Wii.

06:30.271 --> 06:32.372
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you're not the first person to tell me that story.

06:32.772 --> 06:38.234
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is, I'm just kind of saying, like, you know, I'm hearing a lot of people, their parents are wanting Wii's and getting into that.

06:38.534 --> 06:39.454
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's the sports game.

06:39.914 --> 06:42.055
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a parent that wants it for Wii Bowling.

06:42.395 --> 06:43.316
[SPEAKER_04]: Because she likes to bowl.

06:43.996 --> 06:47.617
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was funny because my mom almost played my old Nintendo more than I did.

06:48.917 --> 06:51.979
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, actually she probably played it as much as I did.

06:52.799 --> 06:55.660
[SPEAKER_11]: She wouldn't admit to it, but my mom was a gamer once.

06:56.640 --> 06:58.621
[SPEAKER_11]: And she had her Game Boy and played lots of...

06:59.417 --> 07:03.901
[SPEAKER_11]: Breakout, but, you know, now hearing my mom say, I want a Wii.

07:04.041 --> 07:04.982
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you get me a Wii?

07:05.602 --> 07:08.765
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, I don't have $300, but we'll see.

07:10.187 --> 07:12.168
[SPEAKER_04]: Piker Uno has a very interesting perspective.

07:12.208 --> 07:16.872
[SPEAKER_04]: He's one of our listeners that lives over in Japan, and he says, I just bought one for my friend in the U.K.

07:18.614 --> 07:20.215
[SPEAKER_04]: There are plenty of Wiis in Japan.

07:21.316 --> 07:22.317
[SPEAKER_04]: So, kind of interesting.

07:22.357 --> 07:25.160
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder what effect that's going to have, though, if you bought one for your friend in the U.K.,

07:26.500 --> 07:27.240
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

07:54.639 --> 07:55.379
[SPEAKER_11]: Assault Suits Vulcan

08:17.797 --> 08:22.641
[SPEAKER_04]: Picaruno wanted to clarify something, speaking of the whole UK and how he's sending one to his friend.

08:22.941 --> 08:29.345
[SPEAKER_04]: He said modern PAL TVs are NTSC compatible, which I guess that explains that.

08:29.365 --> 08:29.926
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool.

08:32.147 --> 08:40.633
[SPEAKER_04]: But he says 99% of NTSC TVs are not PAL compatible, which he discovered when he went over to Japan from London, where he was originally at.

08:42.455 --> 08:46.437
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh boy, isn't high def supposed to be all the same no matter where you are?

08:46.878 --> 08:47.098
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

08:47.509 --> 08:48.989
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we need to get on that quick.

08:49.850 --> 08:53.151
[SPEAKER_04]: Because these whole differing TV formats makes things very frustrating.

08:53.251 --> 09:02.014
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, just for example, when I was really big into my Gorillaz fandom, I was importing some of the DVD CDs.

09:03.014 --> 09:06.175
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would just run it through my laptop to the TV and no problem.

09:07.595 --> 09:09.096
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so there you go.

09:09.976 --> 09:12.597
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, let's see here.

09:13.593 --> 09:19.356
[SPEAKER_14]: So for the US, you've got some good stuff coming out on the Virtual Console.

09:21.537 --> 09:24.718
[SPEAKER_14]: Including, you know, we talked about it last week, Pokemon Snap.

09:25.418 --> 09:26.239
[SPEAKER_14]: That's going to be coming out.

09:27.219 --> 09:29.460
[SPEAKER_14]: Baseball Stars 2 for the Neo Geo.

09:30.941 --> 09:33.282
[SPEAKER_14]: And also Ghosts and Goblins.

09:33.942 --> 09:34.903
[SPEAKER_14]: That was on the NES.

09:35.383 --> 09:36.664
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray for Pokemon Snap!

09:37.124 --> 09:41.726
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait to download this and play this and send all of you pictures of Pokemon I take.

09:42.768 --> 09:45.709
[SPEAKER_04]: which means you and you and are you on my Wii?

09:45.929 --> 09:46.549
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have a Wii.

09:46.629 --> 09:47.269
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then screw you.

09:47.309 --> 09:57.732
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm going to definitely actually give that a download but I won't say I'll be downloading Ghosts and Goblins because we've actually broke out our Saturn for our annual tradition and Dan was playing Capcom Collection Volume 2.

09:58.332 --> 09:58.612
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.

09:58.912 --> 10:00.013
[SPEAKER_14]: This game is too damn hard.

10:00.533 --> 10:01.473
[SPEAKER_14]: It is too damn hard.

10:01.493 --> 10:02.613
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to be downloading it.

10:02.653 --> 10:03.334
[SPEAKER_11]: Because guess what?

10:03.354 --> 10:04.974
[SPEAKER_11]: You play all the way through it and guess what?

10:05.154 --> 10:07.555
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to play all the way through it again to beat the game.

10:07.835 --> 10:08.655
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what do you get?

10:08.915 --> 10:09.855
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

10:09.915 --> 10:10.956
[SPEAKER_04]: The story is happy end.

10:10.976 --> 10:11.976
[SPEAKER_11]: You kick Satan's butt.

10:12.603 --> 10:12.783
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

10:13.763 --> 10:17.745
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyway, I will definitely check out Pokemon Snap, so I'm excited about that.

10:17.785 --> 10:20.266
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something I'm kind of curious to check out as well.

10:20.886 --> 10:27.228
[SPEAKER_04]: A Ninja Party game is coming to the Nintendo Wii and the Nintendo DS in March of next year.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.629
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninja Reflex is the name of the game.

10:30.029 --> 10:30.629
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

10:50.950 --> 11:02.593
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyway, EA notes that ninja reflexes will center around doing challenges and testing your reaction time, which is very appropriate for a ninja game.

11:03.773 --> 11:04.374
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a quote.

11:04.994 --> 11:06.234
[SPEAKER_04]: Millisecond precision.

11:07.775 --> 11:08.655
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like fun.

11:09.775 --> 11:10.175
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

11:10.555 --> 11:13.556
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you can calibrate it or something to give it that extra precision.

11:13.616 --> 11:13.976
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

11:14.936 --> 11:17.397
[SPEAKER_11]: That just sounds sort of nifty cool.

11:17.717 --> 11:17.877
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

11:18.377 --> 11:18.698
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

11:19.938 --> 11:20.458
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll check it out.

11:21.411 --> 11:27.336
[SPEAKER_11]: This is fairly, fairly interesting stuff for anyone who has a Wii.

11:27.617 --> 11:42.289
[SPEAKER_11]: If you join Club Nintendo and you would use your previous Nintendo website login, you can buy Wii Points for four stars for every Wii Point using your old stars from the Nintendo Club.

11:42.309 --> 11:45.092
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is actually Nintendo-Europe.com.

11:45.773 --> 11:48.495
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if they're doing anything like that in the U.S., but

11:48.789 --> 11:49.409
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish.

11:49.709 --> 11:55.250
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a loyalty program that they had going on where if you did stuff, you had all these stars.

11:55.770 --> 12:00.471
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can go through and use your points to buy games or go shopping or do stuff.

12:01.271 --> 12:03.692
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of nice that you can finally get something for it, you know?

12:04.052 --> 12:05.392
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think it's pretty cool.

12:06.112 --> 12:09.513
[SPEAKER_11]: As for all those people who saved up your stars, congrats to you.

12:13.053 --> 12:15.734
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, let's see here.

12:15.794 --> 12:17.434
[SPEAKER_14]: This is also kind of interesting.

12:17.961 --> 12:37.475
[SPEAKER_14]: Usually you would think Gamefly with rentals for games and stuff, but now they're offering Gamefly Tunes, which is a partnership with a company called Brand Racket, and they're offering the subscribers five free pre-selected songs to download each month.

12:38.496 --> 12:44.280
[SPEAKER_14]: And I guess that's going to highlight up-and-coming and established artists, and

12:45.251 --> 12:48.513
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, people that aren't subscribed to the service can download one.

12:49.213 --> 12:59.177
[SPEAKER_14]: And I guess this month, music including artists like RJD2, Thievery Corporation, Shadows Fall, OK Go, and Little Brother.

13:00.738 --> 13:03.239
[SPEAKER_14]: Hmm, that's interesting that they would be doing that kind of stuff.

13:03.579 --> 13:06.601
[SPEAKER_14]: And as far as I'm aware, I don't think that's actually any video game music.

13:06.641 --> 13:10.702
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I actually downloaded some of those songs.

13:10.943 --> 13:13.984
[SPEAKER_15]: And, I mean, they are up-and-coming artists, so they aren't really...

13:15.499 --> 13:17.600
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of them are okay, others aren't that great.

13:18.281 --> 13:20.703
[SPEAKER_15]: I imagine that probably every month is going to be more of the same.

13:23.305 --> 13:27.668
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I mean, OK Go was, they're in Rock Band, but, I don't know.

13:29.130 --> 13:29.870
[SPEAKER_14]: Free's good, I guess.

13:30.951 --> 13:31.652
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Free's good.

13:31.692 --> 13:35.935
[SPEAKER_15]: I already have both of OK Go's other albums, and the rest of their stuff just sounds the same.

13:36.696 --> 13:38.237
[SPEAKER_15]: Just less entertaining.

13:39.618 --> 13:40.899
[SPEAKER_15]: And kind of boring in some cases.

13:41.179 --> 13:44.302
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't listen to a lot of the stuff that you kids are listening to these days.

13:45.302 --> 13:49.166
[SPEAKER_15]: You and your old radio discs.

13:49.506 --> 13:50.087
[SPEAKER_15]: 80s Forever.

13:50.107 --> 13:52.990
[SPEAKER_15]: 8-track tapes.

13:55.332 --> 13:56.734
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's cassette tapes.

13:57.935 --> 13:58.475
[SPEAKER_04]: That's too old.

13:58.615 --> 14:04.061
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on to talking about something that could be all the rage in a couple of years, or very soon, who knows.

14:04.548 --> 14:15.530
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently a patent was filed by Apple back in September of 2006 and now it has just come out to light because I guess these things take a while to hit the public internet.

14:15.850 --> 14:20.691
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently there is going to be multi-touch technology in this game.

14:20.791 --> 14:30.073
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently what it is basically, I mean obviously they already have the iPhone, but they want to apply this touch technology, the multi-touch thing, to gaming.

14:31.153 --> 14:35.374
[SPEAKER_04]: So they say, quote, this is being used for a game or a gaming application.

14:35.914 --> 14:46.157
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, we all know about the iPhone, but now we're kind of talking about that possibly this patent was actually filed to do gaming on the iPhone, possibly a music-based game.

14:46.537 --> 14:52.139
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, this really doesn't come as much as a surprise because on the current iPods, they've gone into gaming a little bit.

14:52.519 --> 14:57.240
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just makes sense to me that on the iPhones and the iTouches and all this stuff, they're going to get into this as well.

14:57.660 --> 15:02.243
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, and remember how wonderful those games are on the iPods already.

15:04.024 --> 15:06.966
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm being sarcastic, by the way, because they're not very good.

15:07.066 --> 15:10.268
[SPEAKER_14]: What about the one that came out from Harmonix?

15:11.069 --> 15:11.929
[SPEAKER_14]: Phase, thank you.

15:12.070 --> 15:15.132
[SPEAKER_14]: Phase was okay, but seriously, the rest of them sucked.

15:15.712 --> 15:16.913
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I don't know.

15:17.173 --> 15:25.699
[SPEAKER_14]: But then again, there's not much you can do with just a jog wheel, so having multiple touch screen stuff on there, yeah, that would be a lot better, obviously.

15:26.179 --> 15:26.379
[SPEAKER_14]: But

15:27.478 --> 15:34.099
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't, I don't know, you're going to get as much gaming out of this as you are an N-Gage, so, seriously.

15:34.639 --> 15:38.540
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess time will tell, but it is very interesting that that came up, nevertheless.

15:39.280 --> 15:55.603
[SPEAKER_04]: Always interesting are the emails that you guys send us every week at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, and every week, Jamie dives in headfirst into our big old mailbag and pulls out a few of the emails that she likes and reads them for us here, live on air, and that's what she's going to do right now in our mailbag segment.

16:03.922 --> 16:05.384
[SPEAKER_11]: Email, email, email.

16:06.985 --> 16:16.435
[SPEAKER_11]: And just as a point of order, I will say that I have read every email that comes through and some are not being read, you know, on air because we got a bunch of them.

16:16.856 --> 16:18.357
[SPEAKER_11]: So I will read a few of these.

16:18.657 --> 16:21.060
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of them was sent from an iPhone and that makes me laugh.

16:23.752 --> 16:32.577
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey guys, I love the show.

16:32.617 --> 16:35.158
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys keep me going on the podcast at work.

16:35.779 --> 16:39.381
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to say that I found a new game for me.

16:39.501 --> 16:44.483
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you guys are not very big on the PS3, but you need to give it time and a chance.

16:45.324 --> 16:49.186
[SPEAKER_11]: I was on the PSN store last night and saw that they had added some new games.

16:49.246 --> 16:51.507
[SPEAKER_11]: I had never heard of a game called Wild Arms before.

16:52.432 --> 16:56.814
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you guys slash ladies may have.

16:57.254 --> 16:59.815
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a good RPG for the PSP.

17:00.396 --> 17:01.696
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it was a PlayStation game.

17:02.637 --> 17:04.758
[SPEAKER_11]: Way better on PlayStation LOL anyway.

17:04.778 --> 17:07.499
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the show and keep it up.

17:07.519 --> 17:08.539
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie, I love your input on the show.

17:08.559 --> 17:10.740
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always good to get info from the ladies and not from just us geek guys.

17:19.980 --> 17:23.821
[SPEAKER_11]: Gotta go back to work before the boss finds out I'm emailing you guys, LOLJK.

17:25.402 --> 17:25.982
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm telling.

17:26.342 --> 17:30.543
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually just sold my copy of Ratchet & Clank Tools of Destruction.

17:30.944 --> 17:36.925
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just... Not the full Ratchet & Clank, it's just I don't like the Ratchet & Clank series.

17:37.326 --> 17:44.908
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not... I mean, that game's probably pretty good, but the person I sold it to loves it a lot more than I do, so... I don't know.

17:44.948 --> 17:47.129
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of games, though, for the PS3...

17:48.573 --> 18:02.844
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, I was going to give Unreal Tournament 3 a chance, but for some reason, part of me thought that there was an actual good single player portion of that game, but it's Unreal Tournament and there's not, so I don't really want to buy it.

18:04.866 --> 18:10.430
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, there will be more stuff that comes out later on, it's just right now, there's not a lot of great games for it.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.932
[SPEAKER_14]: Not to say that there won't ever be.

18:13.689 --> 18:15.690
[SPEAKER_04]: Some interesting comments on chat on Wild Arms.

18:15.771 --> 18:17.312
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of polarizing the chat room.

18:17.332 --> 18:20.034
[SPEAKER_04]: Separat1215 said, Wild Arms was never a huge game.

18:20.414 --> 18:22.135
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not surprised if no one knows what it is.

18:22.535 --> 18:25.898
[SPEAKER_04]: RossDLUT says, How the fuck has this guy never heard of Wild Arms?

18:26.538 --> 18:29.520
[SPEAKER_04]: Jonathan F. says, Wild Arms is a killer RPG.

18:29.620 --> 18:32.302
[SPEAKER_04]: Held up well against Final Fantasy VII, I think, in my opinion.

18:32.722 --> 18:34.164
[SPEAKER_04]: Wild Arms is just as it sounds.

18:34.224 --> 18:35.484
[SPEAKER_04]: A Wild West RPG.

18:35.825 --> 18:37.646
[SPEAKER_04]: Although it's not that at the same time.

18:39.047 --> 18:41.709
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there you have some comments on Wild Arms from the chat.

18:42.569 --> 18:43.130
[SPEAKER_04]: Any more emails?

18:44.016 --> 18:45.057
[SPEAKER_11]: No, none at all.

18:45.137 --> 18:45.798
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's some.

18:45.958 --> 18:46.238
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

18:47.840 --> 18:48.420
[SPEAKER_11]: Next email.

18:48.460 --> 18:49.461
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, folks at OLR.

18:49.581 --> 18:56.308
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just emailing to say that I was just about in tears at work from laughing so hard at Loki flipping out about one protesting for publicity.

18:57.129 --> 19:02.374
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad someone gets fired up about something and Loki offered up some radio gold.

19:02.904 --> 19:05.505
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys host a fantastic show, and I always look forward to listening.

19:05.525 --> 19:15.691
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep putting out fantastic shows, and us fans will be extremely saddened with the loss of this show because it really kicks the crap out of those, quote, other big-name corporate podcasts with its real enthusiasm and passion.

19:17.132 --> 19:17.892
[SPEAKER_04]: Ego++, thank you.

19:18.192 --> 19:22.074
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, this email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salads.

19:22.675 --> 19:23.235
[SPEAKER_11]: It's J-Rod.

19:23.295 --> 19:24.556
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, the Olive Garden is awesome.

19:25.596 --> 19:27.137
[SPEAKER_11]: The Olive Garden is awesome.

19:28.418 --> 19:32.300
[SPEAKER_11]: Next, Dear OLR, I was thinking, would those Jot Guys act the same way...

19:32.992 --> 19:34.193
[SPEAKER_11]: If it said gay girl?

20:02.908 --> 20:03.548
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't get me started.

20:26.069 --> 20:27.290
[SPEAKER_04]: But good point brought up.

20:27.790 --> 20:29.211
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see an experiment done.

20:29.491 --> 20:35.313
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see the same person go back on to Halo 3 with the name gay girl or lesbian girl or something like that.

20:35.333 --> 20:43.697
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you say gay girl and a lot of folks get the stereotypical, you know, butchy girl who likes girls in their mind.

20:43.737 --> 20:46.699
[SPEAKER_04]: But lesbians, you know, is a more exotic word.

20:47.119 --> 20:53.282
[SPEAKER_04]: Lesbians is the, you know, lipstick wearing, you know, pillow fighting lesbians.

20:54.328 --> 20:54.949
[SPEAKER_09]: Porn star.

20:55.069 --> 20:59.031
[SPEAKER_04]: When I would tell you that most lesbians I know are in neither category.

20:59.632 --> 20:59.872
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

21:01.853 --> 21:03.974
[SPEAKER_11]: So, continuing forward, shall I?

21:05.075 --> 21:05.535
[SPEAKER_12]: You shall.

21:06.256 --> 21:11.199
[SPEAKER_11]: Greetings, this is Kropotkin from the Kropotkin and Hendrix Game Review Show.

21:11.319 --> 21:12.100
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I'm getting tongue-tied.

21:13.120 --> 21:21.686
[SPEAKER_11]: While listening to your show last week, second part, I noticed that Loki casually dismissed Sensible Soccer as of little to no interest to anyone, and then Sky and Rice Princess began to laugh at its name.

21:21.886 --> 21:22.206
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, dear.

21:23.246 --> 21:30.868
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to count to ten before writing this email as one should never write an email in anger for yes, such a dismissive attitude filled me with both fury and despair.

21:31.509 --> 21:38.171
[SPEAKER_11]: Sensible World of Soccer, aka or Sensi, is part of the holy trinity of British video game titles that cannot be slighted.

21:39.051 --> 21:49.274
[SPEAKER_11]: It was an all-time classic footy game made by Sensible Software, hence the name, that built on Kickoff 2 title from back in 1989 on the Atari ST and Amiga.

21:49.926 --> 21:52.867
[SPEAKER_11]: To see it arrive on Xbox Live Arcade is nothing short of wondrous news.

21:53.227 --> 21:56.889
[SPEAKER_11]: To put it into perspective, try to imagine someone saying Super Mario 3 is a bit meh.

21:57.789 --> 22:02.471
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is what you did last week as far as your British listenership were concerned.

22:02.971 --> 22:08.953
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and in case you're wondering what other two games are in the Trinity, they are Speedball 2, already on Xbox Live Arcade, and Paragroid.

22:09.577 --> 22:12.398
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to know more about these three games, search on wiki.

22:12.759 --> 22:14.479
[SPEAKER_11]: It has some great pages for all three games.

22:14.519 --> 22:15.760
[SPEAKER_11]: I've actually heard of Paradroid.

22:16.921 --> 22:20.983
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep up the good work and just be careful over games that originate from the British Isles in the future.

22:21.443 --> 22:25.025
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you might even start saying things like Lords of Midnight are a bit overrated.

22:25.165 --> 22:25.805
[SPEAKER_11]: Not a good idea.

22:26.745 --> 22:37.831
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically what Kropotkin's trying to tell us is that Guardian Legend is to Orange Lounge Radio as Sensible World of Soccer is to all of the UK.

22:38.900 --> 22:41.122
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that kind of what this email is to summarize?

22:41.382 --> 22:43.724
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the general... I see.

22:43.764 --> 22:46.826
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we are sorry for poking fun at your sacred game.

22:46.946 --> 22:48.327
[SPEAKER_04]: Or he was just saying Loki was wrong.

22:49.108 --> 22:50.609
[SPEAKER_04]: Which a lot of our emailers like to do.

22:50.629 --> 22:53.952
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, okay, no offense, but... I mean, uh-oh.

22:54.012 --> 22:58.956
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, even... Okay, I'll give you, you know, yeah, Super Mario Bros.

22:59.156 --> 23:00.657
[SPEAKER_14]: 3 may be not the shit.

23:00.797 --> 23:03.279
[SPEAKER_14]: And to be honest, it was the shit at one time.

23:04.540 --> 23:06.001
[SPEAKER_14]: But times have changed, okay?

23:06.021 --> 23:06.101
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

23:06.502 --> 23:11.426
[SPEAKER_14]: Sensible World Soccer may have been a great game at the time, and it still may be a great game now.

23:11.626 --> 23:12.547
[SPEAKER_14]: But you know what, though?

23:12.567 --> 23:15.029
[SPEAKER_14]: I ain't gonna download it.

23:15.850 --> 23:16.871
[SPEAKER_14]: You know why I'm not gonna download it?

23:16.951 --> 23:18.372
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's a soccer game, for one.

23:18.873 --> 23:22.636
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't play sports games, and I definitely don't play soccer games.

23:23.194 --> 23:25.035
[SPEAKER_14]: and two, it's like an Amiga game.

23:25.295 --> 23:26.216
[SPEAKER_14]: So, no thanks.

23:26.236 --> 23:28.137
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll check out the demo and if I like it, I'll buy it.

23:28.157 --> 23:29.177
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I do with most games.

23:29.858 --> 23:31.559
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be sensible about it.

23:31.799 --> 23:38.262
[SPEAKER_14]: Back in the day, I used to play Blades of Steel and stuff like that, so I have tried games and stuff like that.

23:38.302 --> 23:39.083
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just not my thing.

23:39.483 --> 23:41.804
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not saying that you're wrong for downloading it.

23:41.824 --> 23:43.945
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not faulting you for doing that, but you know what?

23:44.106 --> 23:45.426
[SPEAKER_14]: I sure as hell am not downloading it.

23:45.927 --> 23:48.268
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're wrong for being British, is what we're trying to say.

23:48.448 --> 23:49.168
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not British.

23:49.188 --> 23:49.929
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

23:50.129 --> 23:50.449
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

23:50.549 --> 23:51.069
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

23:51.129 --> 23:51.830
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just teasing.

23:51.850 --> 23:52.070
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

23:52.731 --> 23:53.011
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

23:54.273 --> 23:57.335
[SPEAKER_11]: You remember, though, what I went crazy about finding at the store Friday night?

23:58.356 --> 24:02.841
[SPEAKER_11]: Super High Impact, which is the only American football game that I like, ever.

24:04.742 --> 24:07.445
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Tecmo Bowl on the Nintendo.

24:07.505 --> 24:08.626
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my favorite.

24:08.686 --> 24:10.548
[SPEAKER_11]: Super High Impact on Super Nintendo was my thing.

24:10.788 --> 24:14.512
[SPEAKER_11]: But I also played, what was it that was on Super Nintendo?

24:14.532 --> 24:15.553
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it Mario Striker?

24:16.153 --> 24:16.694
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't that it?

24:17.276 --> 24:18.557
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Mario Stalker's the new one, isn't it?

24:18.597 --> 24:19.497
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's the new one.

24:19.577 --> 24:21.218
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's probably like a new sequel or something.

24:21.238 --> 24:24.479
[SPEAKER_11]: It was an old one on Super Nintendo, another soccer game.

24:24.499 --> 24:25.540
[SPEAKER_11]: I used to play that all the time.

24:26.740 --> 24:28.841
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh, the chat room's requesting my British accent.

24:29.021 --> 24:29.342
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

24:29.542 --> 24:30.462
[SPEAKER_04]: You better go to next email.

24:30.622 --> 24:31.042
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

24:31.242 --> 24:31.763
[SPEAKER_11]: Next email.

24:32.363 --> 24:36.865
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I think I'll be logging on to Xbox Live this week and downloading some Sensible World of Soccer.

24:36.925 --> 24:37.505
[SPEAKER_04]: Sensible!

24:38.826 --> 24:39.306
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheerio!

24:39.326 --> 24:40.247
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm more Scottish.

24:41.127 --> 24:43.928
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, see, I'm not doing that shit, so I mean, come on.

24:43.988 --> 24:44.989
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're getting mad at me.

24:46.906 --> 24:47.226
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

24:47.246 --> 24:47.906
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but I'm cute.

24:48.727 --> 24:49.347
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh-huh.

24:49.627 --> 24:50.688
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

24:50.928 --> 24:51.928
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, OLR.

24:52.289 --> 24:55.190
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been listening to your show for over a year now, and I think it's the best.

24:55.990 --> 24:56.150
[SPEAKER_11]: Aw.

24:56.951 --> 24:59.452
[SPEAKER_11]: My question is mainly for Loki, but others could chime in.

24:59.492 --> 25:00.733
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank you for your permission.

25:01.273 --> 25:04.975
[SPEAKER_11]: I bought a PSP Slim and need to know how to install custom firmwares.

25:05.855 --> 25:08.316
[SPEAKER_11]: Do I need Pandora's battery and how to?

25:10.697 --> 25:15.039
[SPEAKER_11]: Your show is awesome, great, and with a PSP, I will hopefully be listening live more often.

25:15.660 --> 25:15.980
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

25:16.644 --> 25:44.197
[SPEAKER_14]: Ryan Yeah, you do need Pandora's battery in order to install custom firmware on there and there's instructions online on how to do it and you actually have to create a different Pandora's battery than the one that they use for the fat PSPs but basically it involves you making the standard Pandora's battery then you patch the file with some other thing and then once you've done that you run the Pandora's battery on the system and then you can install custom firmwares

25:45.438 --> 25:47.460
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't ask me how to do it because I didn't know at the time.

25:47.500 --> 25:51.383
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a very stupid walkthrough on how to do it.

25:51.923 --> 25:54.485
[SPEAKER_14]: And it took me about three times before I finally got it right.

25:54.586 --> 25:58.569
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not easy, but it's not super difficult.

25:58.589 --> 26:00.250
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have to mod your PSP?

26:00.470 --> 26:01.912
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Jesus, just play the games.

26:02.692 --> 26:03.873
[SPEAKER_14]: Me, I don't!

26:05.294 --> 26:06.796
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, I have to mod everything.

26:07.176 --> 26:08.017
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything!

26:09.418 --> 26:11.519
[SPEAKER_14]: There's not anything that I don't break open.

26:13.101 --> 26:13.781
[SPEAKER_14]: Except for my DS.

26:13.801 --> 26:14.502
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't done that yet.

26:15.330 --> 26:16.492
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm working on it right now, though.

26:16.812 --> 26:22.321
[SPEAKER_11]: We broke open my old Game Boy Advance to put an afterburner in it.

26:22.950 --> 26:25.151
[SPEAKER_04]: That's different because it really needed that.

26:25.191 --> 26:27.393
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that really enhanced the damn Game Boy Advance.

26:27.433 --> 26:28.593
[SPEAKER_04]: My friend did that for me for my birthday.

26:28.613 --> 26:38.019
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just saying, you know, the PSP, yeah, I installed, when they were first out, I installed the stuff that let me play Kid Icarus on the PSP so I could go, hee, hee, hee, I have Kid Icarus everywhere.

26:38.279 --> 26:39.060
[SPEAKER_04]: But now it's kind of old.

26:39.440 --> 26:40.761
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I just, I don't care anymore.

26:40.781 --> 26:41.841
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care about modding anymore.

26:41.861 --> 26:44.203
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't hacked my iPhone, though, and I'm not going to.

26:44.223 --> 26:45.003
[SPEAKER_04]: Not my thing.

26:47.465 --> 26:48.225
[SPEAKER_11]: Next email.

26:48.285 --> 26:50.646
[SPEAKER_04]: DMN says, Loki modded his penis.

26:50.827 --> 26:51.407
[SPEAKER_04]: I checked.

26:53.211 --> 26:53.831
[SPEAKER_04]: Game consoles, okay.

26:53.851 --> 26:54.412
[SPEAKER_04]: Next email says words.

27:06.423 --> 27:07.744
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Loki, DarkSakura, and Sky.

27:07.764 --> 27:11.708
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to thank you guys so much for helping me get through a really hard first semester at college.

27:12.148 --> 27:13.729
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking forward to the next podcast.

27:13.989 --> 27:17.733
[SPEAKER_11]: It kept me going and helped me look around for some fellow gamers that need play.

27:17.753 --> 27:25.199
[SPEAKER_11]: So I quickly found a whole bunch of Wii players, and I've been having fun with Mario Strikers since I'm one of those more social gamers, although I don't play online a lot.

27:25.719 --> 27:29.903
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, keep up the good work, and once again, thanks for making this transition all that much more manageable.

27:31.272 --> 27:32.473
[SPEAKER_11]: All the best, Cliff R.

27:57.083 --> 27:57.644
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Burst

28:18.820 --> 28:19.381
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

28:37.239 --> 28:40.402
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad that the price changes on live through 65 did not kill you.

28:40.902 --> 28:43.864
[SPEAKER_11]: This show has helped me get over two pages out of three.

28:44.445 --> 28:45.125
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job, guys.

28:45.165 --> 28:45.626
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep it up.

28:46.126 --> 28:48.908
[SPEAKER_11]: Over 9,000 cups of coffee for the win, Dr. Burst.

28:50.049 --> 28:50.369
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

28:51.931 --> 28:53.272
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gotten four times better.

28:55.353 --> 29:01.378
[SPEAKER_04]: We must have been really bad before to be four times better now because I would say we're only about... We're like on the line right now.

29:02.138 --> 29:02.459
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

29:02.599 --> 29:05.281
[SPEAKER_11]: I lied because there's... Well...

29:06.648 --> 29:13.914
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an article that Rob with 2B's linked to that I actually think is pretty cool.

29:14.114 --> 29:17.556
[SPEAKER_11]: It's from Endgadget, as soon as it loads.

29:17.657 --> 29:24.101
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's Sega protecting the Dreamcast trademark but not doing another console.

29:24.482 --> 29:26.023
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God, that whole debacle.

29:26.063 --> 29:26.943
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot about that.

29:27.944 --> 29:28.945
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if it'll ever load.

29:29.700 --> 29:45.704
[SPEAKER_11]: But basically, Sega is saying that they are going to keep that trademark so that they can, I guess, protect their rights in the Dreamcast name, but they're not going to be doing any...

29:46.573 --> 29:52.120
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know how the hell someone jumped to that conclusion that they're doing a Dreamcast 2 from them renewing the trademarks.

29:52.481 --> 29:54.844
[SPEAKER_04]: How did that rumor even start?

29:55.204 --> 29:56.887
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that kind of seems stupid to me.

29:57.467 --> 30:00.952
[SPEAKER_11]: They're quoted as saying they have no plans to get back into the console business.

30:00.972 --> 30:02.034
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is no surprise.

30:02.054 --> 30:03.796
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first read that rumor, I'm like, yeah, right.

30:04.488 --> 30:08.170
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right, they're going to put out a Dreamcast 2 right now when the market is crowded.

30:08.590 --> 30:11.071
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't see Sega getting back into consoles anytime soon.

30:11.132 --> 30:18.355
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, let's face it, sorry Sega fans, but the last few offerings from Sega have not been all that, even in the console market.

30:19.096 --> 30:21.197
[SPEAKER_04]: So they've got a lot of catching up to do, you know what I mean?

30:21.637 --> 30:23.138
[SPEAKER_04]: Before they start thinking about a console again.

30:23.278 --> 30:25.219
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, we've got one last email.

30:25.639 --> 30:26.960
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I was blinking.

30:27.340 --> 30:27.580
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

30:28.100 --> 30:28.921
[SPEAKER_11]: It says boobies!

30:30.407 --> 30:30.947
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not joking.

30:30.967 --> 30:32.187
[SPEAKER_11]: The first word in it is boobies.

30:32.308 --> 30:33.128
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that from DMN?

30:33.248 --> 30:33.448
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

30:33.708 --> 30:34.028
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

30:34.048 --> 30:34.608
[SPEAKER_11]: From the doctor.

30:34.888 --> 30:35.268
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

30:36.189 --> 30:36.989
[SPEAKER_11]: LOL.

30:37.209 --> 30:39.429
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm thinking a lot of LOLs in my emails.

30:39.590 --> 30:40.010
[SPEAKER_04]: What is up with that?

30:40.070 --> 30:40.870
[SPEAKER_11]: I love you guys.

30:41.010 --> 30:44.271
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, I'm going to try and buy some 360 before Christmas.

30:44.791 --> 30:47.012
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for the idea, Sky and Loki, the doctor.

30:48.592 --> 30:53.333
[SPEAKER_11]: Send me a TARDIS so I can, you know, go elsewhere and else when.

30:54.053 --> 30:57.234
[SPEAKER_04]: And now here, Rostio UT actually has a really good idea here.

30:57.314 --> 30:59.655
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, I can imagine, for once, ha ha ha,

31:00.726 --> 31:01.246
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just kidding.

31:01.526 --> 31:06.147
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, I can imagine they'll just repackage a flashback-type console for Dreamcast games.

31:06.587 --> 31:08.247
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I could see happening.

31:08.787 --> 31:11.928
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a sensible world of Dreamcast to me.

31:13.748 --> 31:15.569
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, it was Mega Man Soccer I was trying to think of.

31:18.609 --> 31:19.329
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, what else?

31:19.349 --> 31:21.690
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm getting lulled today in boobies.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.490
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody else had a sensible joke.

31:23.550 --> 31:23.810
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

31:24.390 --> 31:29.811
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft said when we go to the college campuses, it could be OLR, the Sensible World of Podcasting Tour.

31:32.114 --> 31:34.795
[SPEAKER_11]: We should have that contest.

31:34.975 --> 31:35.975
[SPEAKER_11]: Pay for us to come see you.

31:36.695 --> 31:38.175
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that idea.

31:38.235 --> 31:39.135
[SPEAKER_04]: Pay for our vacation.

31:39.596 --> 31:42.256
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's our new contest.

31:43.496 --> 31:45.077
[SPEAKER_11]: Pay for ORR to come to your town.

31:46.337 --> 31:50.378
[SPEAKER_15]: And they can make fun of your town and then maybe show some people how to do podcasts.

31:50.398 --> 31:52.998
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll record our podcast in your town if you pay.

31:54.378 --> 31:56.199
[SPEAKER_04]: But not at your house because that would be creepy.

31:59.383 --> 32:00.664
[SPEAKER_15]: And you might not have good internet either.

32:00.724 --> 32:01.344
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

32:01.384 --> 32:06.667
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, my God, the show's breaking our internet at this house, and we kind of tried to prep for it.

32:07.007 --> 32:08.108
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, end of mailbag.

32:08.148 --> 32:10.229
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to some more stuff.

32:10.269 --> 32:13.411
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to send in an email, give us some ego++.

32:13.451 --> 32:14.051
[SPEAKER_04]: We always love that.

32:14.091 --> 32:15.432
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at orangeongeradio.com.

32:15.732 --> 32:17.293
[SPEAKER_04]: Or some ego-minus-minus.

32:17.894 --> 32:20.455
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Jamie skipped some of the ego-minus-minus this week.

32:21.216 --> 32:22.136
[SPEAKER_11]: I skipped a...

32:24.446 --> 32:28.748
[SPEAKER_11]: reminder of manners addressed to one of our three that isn't you or me.

32:31.048 --> 32:33.069
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking forward to that email because it was kind of funny.

32:33.429 --> 32:34.070
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want me to read it?

32:34.190 --> 32:35.710
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, read it because it's funny.

32:35.810 --> 32:37.291
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see why in a minute.

32:37.611 --> 32:38.971
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to open the email box again.

32:38.991 --> 32:39.251
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on.

32:39.271 --> 32:39.572
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

32:40.572 --> 32:46.154
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to give her a minute because there's an email that's criticizing Loki that I actually found kind of funny and I want her to read it.

32:47.170 --> 32:48.711
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's funny because it's true.

32:48.771 --> 32:49.831
[SPEAKER_04]: It is so fucking true.

32:50.091 --> 32:53.293
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been listening all night long tonight and it is completely true.

32:53.373 --> 32:56.854
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's why I want to... I know Loki's like, what the fuck did I do now?

32:56.874 --> 32:57.634
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, here we go.

32:57.654 --> 32:58.615
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to go in the old mail.

32:58.755 --> 33:00.515
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

33:00.535 --> 33:03.076
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, we'll get some email loading music here.

33:03.116 --> 33:05.377
[SPEAKER_14]: All criticisms of me are true, so whatever.

33:05.397 --> 33:11.540
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, when you start playing the music now, the email starts to load, so...

33:12.653 --> 33:15.575
[SPEAKER_04]: Old mail.

33:15.615 --> 33:19.517
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be critical of Loki for another week.

33:20.317 --> 33:21.778
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait to see.

33:21.918 --> 33:23.238
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, because Op 11's running.

33:23.939 --> 33:25.740
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn you, Op 11!

33:26.200 --> 33:28.121
[SPEAKER_04]: Op 11's going to shut off.

33:28.201 --> 33:30.262
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, Loki's like, oh, take your time.

33:30.542 --> 33:30.942
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

33:31.362 --> 33:31.783
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hooray.

33:32.743 --> 33:34.524
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is from Mario.

33:36.073 --> 33:39.135
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh shit, you know that Mario's calling you out now.

33:39.615 --> 33:43.337
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, there are other people in the world named Mario other than the video game character.

33:43.357 --> 33:47.740
[SPEAKER_11]: I will not say last names on the air.

33:48.660 --> 33:55.624
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, I find that you are very rude to your co-hosts and audience when you cut them off with your standard introduction, anyways.

33:57.045 --> 34:00.807
[SPEAKER_11]: Saying anyways after someone states that whatever is said is not important.

34:01.331 --> 34:04.832
[SPEAKER_11]: What everyone says is important, even your thoughts and comments.

34:05.132 --> 34:08.594
[SPEAKER_11]: Learn to stop saying anyways after anyone's statements except your own statements.

34:09.934 --> 34:10.975
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, I don't really care.

34:14.496 --> 34:15.816
[SPEAKER_14]: It is true, though.

34:15.836 --> 34:19.558
[SPEAKER_14]: No, he just... There's people that interrupt me all the fucking time.

34:19.578 --> 34:22.499
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll hear me going, hey, hey, I'm not done talking yet.

34:22.599 --> 34:23.679
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, listen.

34:24.180 --> 34:25.160
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, listen.

34:26.100 --> 34:27.541
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, listen.

34:28.749 --> 34:28.909
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey!

34:29.009 --> 34:29.609
[SPEAKER_09]: It's over!

34:30.370 --> 34:31.110
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say anyways.

34:31.130 --> 34:31.771
[SPEAKER_04]: It's over!

34:31.851 --> 34:32.471
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, please.

34:32.711 --> 34:33.231
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's just funny.

34:33.532 --> 34:39.175
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's just, you know, we're just poking fun at you because I don't think you really mean it to be rude, but it's been kind of your transition word.

34:39.515 --> 34:42.636
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, we've been working on our transition, you know, going from one story to another.

34:42.676 --> 34:45.958
[SPEAKER_04]: We try to be smooth, like, you know, oh, we're going to go from one wee story to another wee story.

34:46.278 --> 34:50.040
[SPEAKER_04]: When Loki's ready to go on a story, it's like, okay, anyways, we got this game coming out.

34:50.060 --> 34:52.121
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, Rob, your light's just seizured.

34:52.862 --> 34:53.142
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they?

34:53.846 --> 34:57.287
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they're just sitting here and we're on and all of a sudden BLINK!

34:57.627 --> 35:00.248
[SPEAKER_14]: It's because he has them on that one where they cycle.

35:00.728 --> 35:02.569
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're on the cycle one where it goes through anything.

35:02.589 --> 35:04.289
[SPEAKER_04]: They cycle, you know, with the baby on.

35:04.449 --> 35:06.510
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I just happened to look over there when they were on.

35:06.530 --> 35:08.711
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyways, can we get back into the gaming news now?

35:08.851 --> 35:10.751
[SPEAKER_14]: Definitely we can get back into the gaming news.

35:11.171 --> 35:12.192
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll stop shopping.

35:15.353 --> 35:18.534
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get a little bell and every time Loki says anyways I go BING!

35:19.534 --> 35:20.774
[SPEAKER_14]: Weren't you going to get a bell for something else?

35:20.794 --> 35:22.775
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, there was something else I was going to get a bell for and I never did.

35:23.447 --> 35:24.908
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh well, because I'm lazy.

35:25.568 --> 35:30.289
[SPEAKER_14]: So Rock Band ain't coming out in Canada until the 28th.

35:31.190 --> 35:33.050
[SPEAKER_14]: Sucks for you guys, but guess what?

35:34.851 --> 35:41.133
[SPEAKER_14]: The problem is they don't have enough guitars and instruments and stuff to go around and it doesn't help that their first batch of them also sucked.

35:41.694 --> 35:47.476
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're having to send all the Canadian guitars out as replacements for all the broken American ones and you know it's true.

35:48.216 --> 35:48.616
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.

35:50.317 --> 35:51.277
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah.

35:53.570 --> 35:54.451
[SPEAKER_14]: No Rock Band for you.

36:21.815 --> 36:28.538
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess apparently this was going to be a UMD project, like an actual full game, and there was actually going to be licensed music and videos.

36:28.878 --> 36:32.559
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently the Sugar Babes, which is a British band, was going to be involved.

36:33.179 --> 36:36.080
[SPEAKER_04]: But they decided to scrap that idea, thank God.

36:36.560 --> 36:42.083
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they did instead is that now for this $5 game, it'll actually run off the MP3s that's on your PSP.

36:42.603 --> 36:45.624
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very similar to that iPod game that just came out, Phase.

36:46.644 --> 36:47.745
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it doesn't look the same.

36:48.085 --> 36:48.545
[SPEAKER_04]: To me...

36:49.443 --> 36:55.685
[SPEAKER_04]: The game itself looks like one of those cutscenes, or not cutscenes, but one of the parts of Guitar Room Man.

36:55.745 --> 36:59.665
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the part where you're moving the analog stick around, but the part where all the notes are coming in towards the center.

36:59.946 --> 37:02.626
[SPEAKER_11]: When you are doing the attacks.

37:02.806 --> 37:03.566
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

37:03.586 --> 37:06.087
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what this looks like to me.

37:06.667 --> 37:07.547
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, you're right.

37:08.288 --> 37:12.128
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you can't get that on the PlayStation 3 store for whatever reason.

37:12.229 --> 37:15.049
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe soon, but right now you can only get it on the PC store.

37:15.309 --> 37:15.809
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

37:16.930 --> 37:18.190
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks very plain.

37:19.740 --> 37:26.004
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I guess Tigerclaw actually linked a YouTube video of our buddy Bobby playing beats.

37:26.464 --> 37:31.028
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm curious about this, and since the Op 11's done, we should actually have bandwidth now.

37:31.128 --> 37:31.868
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to look at this.

37:32.729 --> 37:33.149
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

37:34.390 --> 37:35.811
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there's a little watermark.

37:35.891 --> 37:36.812
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here we go.

37:37.412 --> 37:38.133
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take a look at this.

37:40.575 --> 37:41.535
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks kind of cute.

37:41.595 --> 37:41.936
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

37:42.156 --> 37:43.377
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into actual gameplay.

37:44.377 --> 37:45.598
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he's playing to his own show.

37:45.638 --> 37:46.139
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cute.

37:50.595 --> 37:51.456
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something else.

37:51.836 --> 37:54.057
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, the game itself doesn't look that exciting, though.

37:58.080 --> 37:58.681
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, there you have it.

37:59.721 --> 38:00.442
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice job, Bobby.

38:01.082 --> 38:02.643
[SPEAKER_04]: Good promotional piece, I gotta say.

38:02.783 --> 38:03.324
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good one.

38:04.384 --> 38:05.325
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, that's it.

38:05.405 --> 38:06.186
[SPEAKER_04]: PSP Beats.

38:06.446 --> 38:09.008
[SPEAKER_04]: Not something I think I'm gonna run and grab my PSP for.

38:09.448 --> 38:11.209
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it doesn't look that exciting to me.

38:12.270 --> 38:12.810
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

38:13.651 --> 38:14.511
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not gonna download it.

38:15.652 --> 38:18.094
[SPEAKER_11]: However, this is something I do want.

38:18.686 --> 38:20.547
[SPEAKER_11]: And by do want, I mean do want.

38:22.868 --> 38:23.268
[SPEAKER_11]: Finally.

38:23.888 --> 38:25.729
[SPEAKER_11]: Luminous is now available on the PC.

38:25.869 --> 38:27.370
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

38:28.290 --> 38:30.531
[SPEAKER_04]: My God, what else are they going to put this thing on?

38:30.571 --> 38:31.231
[SPEAKER_04]: The N-Gage?

38:32.231 --> 38:33.092
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it already there?

38:33.992 --> 38:38.434
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the PC is like the last platform I think this game is coming out on.

38:39.815 --> 38:42.095
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got a skin editing mode.

38:42.195 --> 38:42.716
[SPEAKER_11]: You have...

38:44.415 --> 39:01.979
[SPEAKER_11]: Online score ranking, it's going to be $19.99, and there is a pay-per-play on a... You can pay-per-play, or you can use a free version that has ads all over it.

39:02.819 --> 39:03.659
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it have Shinen?

39:03.679 --> 39:04.720
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I really care about.

39:05.080 --> 39:06.680
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, but I'll get it.

39:08.885 --> 39:11.887
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, you let me know, and then I'll download it if it has Shinin' in it.

39:12.007 --> 39:12.968
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going on there right now.

39:13.849 --> 39:14.289
[SPEAKER_14]: Shinin'.

39:15.990 --> 39:16.291
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways.

39:20.814 --> 39:22.575
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I didn't care what you were talking about.

39:23.636 --> 39:28.480
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it has Shinin' on it, because I'm not going to play the game unless it has Shinin'.

39:31.222 --> 39:33.023
[SPEAKER_14]: Sad you're home with Bell, so fuck off.

39:33.844 --> 39:33.944
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

39:35.339 --> 39:36.200
[SPEAKER_14]: Axiom Overdrive

40:04.195 --> 40:08.938
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's going to be heading, I know, to live arcade here pretty soon.

40:11.099 --> 40:20.805
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the nominees here, they've got best web browser game, including Iron Dukes, Globus.com, and Triacnid.

40:22.926 --> 40:26.708
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the games I've liked that I played here, Excellence in Visual Art, Clean Asia.

40:27.028 --> 40:31.251
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I said, it's a good shoot-em-up game if you like Warning Forever.

40:32.652 --> 40:36.634
[SPEAKER_14]: There's also another one that you might like if you like Warning Forever, which is called Battleships Forever.

40:36.654 --> 40:39.356
[SPEAKER_14]: It was inspired by that game, and it's another shoot-em-up game.

40:40.076 --> 40:41.337
[SPEAKER_14]: So definitely worth checking out.

40:41.477 --> 40:47.740
[SPEAKER_14]: And also, if you want something to waste some time on, also check out Crayon Physics Deluxe.

40:48.380 --> 40:51.342
[SPEAKER_14]: They have Crayon Physics, which you can play for free as well.

40:51.782 --> 40:54.904
[SPEAKER_14]: Fret Nice, also fun if you've got a Guitar Hero controller.

40:56.044 --> 40:57.485
[SPEAKER_14]: Highly recommend that game as well.

40:57.952 --> 40:59.053
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyways, just check it out.

40:59.193 --> 41:04.857
[SPEAKER_14]: It's at www.igf.com slash 02finalist.html

41:05.876 --> 41:11.358
[SPEAKER_14]: and there's a bunch of links to free games and also go to all those sites you'll notice that there's also more free games on there as well.

41:11.658 --> 41:29.384
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I'm glad we really did that story tonight because I think sometimes we don't give independent games enough loving on this show and for you know as much as we say rah rah rah support independent podcasting we should be talking more and more about independent games so we definitely should all take an effort to kind of check out some of these winners and talk about them on the show.

41:29.424 --> 41:33.225
[SPEAKER_14]: Definitely and if you're also interested there's links this is the 2008

41:35.612 --> 41:36.553
[SPEAKER_14]: GameTapIndia Awards

42:04.083 --> 42:06.768
[SPEAKER_14]: Roboblitz and Everyday Shooter won that as well.

42:06.988 --> 42:16.484
[SPEAKER_14]: So a lot of these games, play them now because you'll probably see them on an online service like the PlayStation Network or Xbox Live Arcade soon.

42:18.456 --> 42:46.606
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well something you might be seeing making a comeback soon are the franchises MechWarrior, Shadowrun, and Crimson Skies because Jordan Weissman has this new startup company Smith & Tinker and he basically has licensed back the electronic entertainment rights to those franchises back from Microsoft and basically these franchises were originally developed by FASA and then Microsoft had it in 1999 and they recently dissolved

42:48.326 --> 42:49.027
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that.

42:49.107 --> 42:52.910
[SPEAKER_04]: So, no really plans to further these franchises.

42:54.031 --> 42:58.414
[SPEAKER_04]: By Microsoft, which is probably good news, because Shadowrun really didn't get a lot of love.

42:58.975 --> 43:02.938
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, you know, kind of seemed like these series were kind of done for.

43:02.998 --> 43:05.260
[SPEAKER_04]: But they are a lot of fans, especially Shadowrun.

43:05.280 --> 43:08.262
[SPEAKER_04]: You look at that, you know, especially the old school versions of Shadowrun.

43:08.682 --> 43:14.467
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of people love those games and are very excited at this news because, you know, maybe this is a sign that...

43:15.731 --> 43:19.174
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to play Shadowrun Tabletop, like the original Shadowrun, which was RPG, actual.

43:44.994 --> 43:45.815
[SPEAKER_11]: D&D Style Gaming

44:16.162 --> 44:21.086
[SPEAKER_11]: This is actually put out by, I think, let me see.

44:21.647 --> 44:23.028
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to find the list that put it out.

44:23.288 --> 44:26.791
[SPEAKER_11]: Next Gen, 2007's Japan's Top 20 Games.

44:27.171 --> 44:28.492
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're not talking sales-wise, though.

44:28.512 --> 44:34.157
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking like, it's December, here comes everybody's Top 10 list, you know, and all that stuff, right?

44:34.417 --> 44:36.779
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I've got a Top 20, so I'm just going to sort of skim through it.

44:36.859 --> 44:37.039
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

44:37.440 --> 44:41.843
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, on number 20, DS Literature Companion, which was on the DS.

44:43.405 --> 44:43.545
[SPEAKER_11]: And...

44:47.023 --> 44:53.809
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see how that would be interesting, but they were doing these cartridges for different classic Japanese novels.

44:54.730 --> 44:56.612
[SPEAKER_11]: So that you know more about it.

44:56.932 --> 44:58.333
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess like Cliff Notes or something?

44:59.975 --> 45:00.495
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

45:00.515 --> 45:05.960
[SPEAKER_11]: 19 was Bladestorm for PS3 and Xbox 360 put out by Koei.

45:06.921 --> 45:10.644
[SPEAKER_11]: More Dynasty Warriors-ish game.

45:10.664 --> 45:13.867
[SPEAKER_11]: 18 was Vision Training Flash Focus on Nintendo DS.

45:14.468 --> 45:30.492
[SPEAKER_11]: Wild Arms XF on PSP number 17, number 16, Game Center CX on Nintendo DS, which is by Bandai Namco, which is, it's actually based off of a TV show.

45:32.932 --> 45:34.713
[SPEAKER_11]: And let's see, moving forward.

45:36.773 --> 45:41.034
[SPEAKER_11]: On number 15 is Trustee Bell, which was Eternal Sonata.

45:42.795 --> 45:43.615
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that game a lot.

45:43.835 --> 45:44.035
[SPEAKER_11]: Mm-hmm.

45:45.403 --> 45:51.427
[SPEAKER_11]: 14 is face training to where you use the DS camera to mimic a face.

45:53.729 --> 45:54.730
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds stupid.

45:55.210 --> 45:55.550
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

45:55.951 --> 45:57.792
[SPEAKER_11]: It's sort of like how to smile a certain way.

45:57.832 --> 45:59.033
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the top games of the year.

46:00.554 --> 46:03.216
[SPEAKER_11]: 13 was Ace Combat 6, which I don't see why because it's kind of boring.

46:03.236 --> 46:12.283
[SPEAKER_11]: 12 was Tsuburashiki Kono Sekai It's a Wonderful World on Nintendo DS.

46:12.443 --> 46:14.045
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the one by Square Enix.

46:14.747 --> 46:15.747
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty awesome looking.

46:16.148 --> 46:20.209
[SPEAKER_11]: I like how the article says the battle system plays something like DDR for kids with ADHD.

46:22.510 --> 46:23.430
[SPEAKER_11]: That's interesting.

46:24.090 --> 46:29.272
[SPEAKER_11]: Eleven, Treasure Island Z, The Adventures of Zack and Wiki on Wii by Capcom.

46:32.093 --> 46:33.094
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving forward.

46:34.614 --> 46:35.014
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on.

46:35.535 --> 46:35.935
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.

46:36.775 --> 46:40.176
[SPEAKER_11]: Ten, Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII on PSP.

46:40.677 --> 46:41.717
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I have to explain that.

46:42.764 --> 46:44.486
[SPEAKER_11]: 9.

46:42.805 --> 46:44.486
[SPEAKER_11]: Legend of Zelda The Phantom Hourglass 8.

46:46.348 --> 46:49.591
[SPEAKER_11]: Armordyne, which was on PlayStation 2.

46:51.052 --> 46:54.856
[SPEAKER_11]: Another one of those mecha fighting weird strategy RPG things.

46:56.517 --> 46:54.856
7.

46:57.058 --> 47:05.746
[SPEAKER_11]: Yushin no Kusei ni Namaikita on PSP, which is put out by Acquire.

47:06.847 --> 47:08.188
[SPEAKER_11]: Acquire gave us Tenchu, by the way.

47:10.241 --> 47:15.722
[SPEAKER_11]: Six, No More Heroes, which we were just going over during our break.

47:17.783 --> 47:19.343
[SPEAKER_11]: Very interesting looking little game.

47:20.804 --> 47:23.184
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the last few, the top five.

47:23.844 --> 47:26.865
[SPEAKER_11]: Number five is Lost Odyssey, Xbox 360.

47:29.226 --> 47:31.846
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been hearing some not so great things about Lost Odyssey.

47:31.886 --> 47:33.667
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very curious to check it out when it comes out here.

47:36.047 --> 47:37.408
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of of two minds about it.

47:37.448 --> 47:38.188
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm thinking about it.

47:39.312 --> 47:54.562
[SPEAKER_11]: 4 is Super Mario Galaxy, 3 is Wii Fit, 2 is Professor Layton and the Curious Village on Nintendo DS, put up by level 5, and number 1 is Pac-Man Championship Edition on Xbox Live Arcade.

47:55.603 --> 47:56.284
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

47:57.684 --> 47:58.485
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting choices.

47:58.585 --> 48:00.907
[SPEAKER_11]: We've actually, that game gets a lot of play in my house.

48:01.207 --> 48:01.347
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

48:02.585 --> 48:03.967
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually curious about this.

48:04.167 --> 48:06.288
[SPEAKER_04]: We were posted a link in chat from Rosteel UT.

48:06.328 --> 48:09.031
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a commercial for face training straight out of Japan.

48:09.111 --> 48:10.292
[SPEAKER_04]: So this ought to be a hoot.

48:11.713 --> 48:11.893
[SPEAKER_00]: DSで顔のトレーニング 口角と頬を引き上げます 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 両方の眉を引き上げます

48:39.333 --> 48:42.636
[SPEAKER_04]: My god, it looks like it's like, like, it's creepy.

48:42.696 --> 48:49.421
[SPEAKER_04]: That commercial's creepy because it makes it seem like, you know, we will be absorbing your brain in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

48:52.907 --> 48:57.110
[SPEAKER_11]: It's strange to teach everybody to smile and make expressions the same way.

48:57.330 --> 49:01.093
[SPEAKER_14]: Are they trying to imply that the Japanese people do not have emotion?

49:01.333 --> 49:03.514
[SPEAKER_14]: That's racist.

49:04.195 --> 49:08.738
[SPEAKER_14]: That they need to look like everybody else.

49:09.018 --> 49:13.641
[SPEAKER_14]: It's basically a trainer for pod people so that we can't see who they are.

49:14.201 --> 49:15.062
[SPEAKER_14]: That's really what it is.

49:15.122 --> 49:16.563
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a strange looking game.

49:16.603 --> 49:16.943
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

49:19.369 --> 49:20.390
[SPEAKER_14]: CompUSA Liquidation Sales

49:44.702 --> 49:48.363
[SPEAKER_04]: Make your way down to your local CompUSA for some sweet deals on old games, I'm sure.

49:49.064 --> 49:52.845
[SPEAKER_04]: Except for the fact I looked, and there's no more CompUSAs in Sacramento.

49:52.865 --> 49:53.665
[SPEAKER_04]: They got rid of all of them.

49:54.306 --> 49:55.926
[SPEAKER_04]: The closest ones are in the Bay Area.

49:57.447 --> 49:59.668
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not driving all the way over there just for some cheap games.

50:02.169 --> 50:03.209
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, CompUSA.

50:03.269 --> 50:04.630
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice knowing you when you were still around.

50:04.850 --> 50:11.012
[SPEAKER_14]: We bought one of our computers from CompUSA one time, like way back in the day, with its whopping one meg of RAM.

50:13.171 --> 50:13.792
[SPEAKER_04]: www.darksakura.com

50:20.697 --> 50:22.838
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Phil Burned a Lot of Bridges with Gamers

50:47.243 --> 50:50.504
[SPEAKER_04]: She was really into there, and I want to say for a time worked for the company.

50:50.544 --> 50:51.464
[SPEAKER_04]: She may still even be there.

50:51.564 --> 50:51.904
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

50:52.444 --> 50:53.704
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we haven't heard from her in a while.

50:53.724 --> 50:55.224
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe she needs to go on the Dr. Phil show.

50:55.404 --> 50:57.685
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

50:57.885 --> 51:02.266
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, apparently this girl, this 13-year-old girl, Lexi, she spends all her time on there.

51:02.626 --> 51:08.587
[SPEAKER_04]: She had a boyfriend in there, and they would make out on their bed and everything.

51:08.607 --> 51:12.287
[SPEAKER_04]: She had real feelings for this guy, I think.

51:13.388 --> 51:15.568
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, I saw the show.

51:17.674 --> 51:17.994
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

51:18.715 --> 51:20.036
[SPEAKER_14]: You watch the Dr. Phil show?

51:20.076 --> 51:22.137
[SPEAKER_14]: My wife watches the Dr. Phil show.

51:22.157 --> 51:23.658
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and it just happened to be there.

51:23.718 --> 51:25.980
[SPEAKER_04]: You couldn't, like, you know, go to the other room or anything?

51:26.340 --> 51:34.886
[SPEAKER_14]: I had already been in the other room the entire day, so, you know, I have to come out sometime and spend quality time with my wife and also eat dinner.

51:35.151 --> 51:38.575
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then, did you have fun watching the Dr. Phil show?

51:38.836 --> 51:40.598
[SPEAKER_14]: No, because we always make fun of Dr. Phil.

51:40.618 --> 51:42.240
[SPEAKER_01]: We always mock him.

51:42.460 --> 51:44.243
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Dr. Phil, okay?

51:44.643 --> 51:47.707
[SPEAKER_14]: He's a lot like Mr. Mackey.

51:47.727 --> 51:51.512
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, yeah, I'm Dr. Phil, and you should stop doing that.

51:52.034 --> 52:00.798
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what's interesting is what Dr. Phil, and you may think that he's going to say something kind of narrow-minded and stupid, but he actually ends up having some pretty decent advice.

52:01.279 --> 52:06.921
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, quote, because he actually had the CEO from there come on the show and kind of defend.

52:06.941 --> 52:08.362
[SPEAKER_04]: So he got all ends of it.

52:08.642 --> 52:11.284
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, quote, the problem is not with the game.

52:11.364 --> 52:13.044
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is the use of it.

52:13.405 --> 52:16.906
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is very creative, and it's there for you to use or abuse.

52:17.387 --> 52:18.227
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you abusing it?

52:19.454 --> 52:20.455
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and she said yes.

52:20.715 --> 52:22.076
[SPEAKER_14]: She's like, yes, I am abusing it.

52:22.116 --> 52:23.957
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's like, oh, okay, that was easy.

52:24.217 --> 52:24.818
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the thing.

52:25.458 --> 52:28.280
[SPEAKER_04]: Mom limited play to four hours a day.

52:30.161 --> 52:32.423
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Dr. Phil says, four hours a day?

52:32.503 --> 52:33.223
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ridiculous.

52:33.644 --> 52:36.265
[SPEAKER_04]: Mom, you've got to step up and shut this down, okay?

52:36.766 --> 52:43.490
[SPEAKER_04]: Once she's at a point where she can play the game instead of being absorbed in the game, okay, then perhaps she can attempt to get back to it.

52:44.471 --> 52:46.212
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the official advice from Dr. Phil.

52:46.272 --> 52:47.573
[SPEAKER_04]: So it actually seems like...

52:48.311 --> 52:58.139
[SPEAKER_04]: That was good at telling the parent that the parent needs to pull the plug on the game and get the kid to do something else and stop passively accepting it.

52:58.199 --> 53:00.180
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the parent is the one paying the credit.

53:00.641 --> 53:07.026
[SPEAKER_14]: This has a monthly subscription fee, I believe, where you can buy money in this game using your credit card.

53:07.066 --> 53:12.590
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the kid does not have a credit card, so stop giving her money, you moron.

53:14.102 --> 53:21.487
[SPEAKER_15]: Wasn't this also the episode of Dr. Phil that the lawyer of no name was claiming that he was supposed to be invited to and never went through with it?

53:23.248 --> 53:24.168
[SPEAKER_04]: Eh, who cares about that guy?

53:24.408 --> 53:25.809
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's gonna be disbarred at the end of the day.

53:25.829 --> 53:26.530
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so over him.

53:27.530 --> 53:28.051
[SPEAKER_03]: So over him.

53:29.111 --> 53:29.852
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, he's gonna be gone.

53:30.232 --> 53:30.552
[SPEAKER_15]: Yay.

53:31.753 --> 53:37.196
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there is a new games rating system.

53:38.557 --> 53:41.699
[SPEAKER_11]: A campaign to be launched for renting the games.

53:41.779 --> 53:42.740
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a group...

53:43.302 --> 53:57.726
[SPEAKER_11]: A couple of the Delaware political folks are hanging out with the ESRB and trying to bring out new public service announcements that these new ratings are supposed to be adhered to or whatever.

53:59.327 --> 53:59.787
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

54:02.588 --> 54:03.588
[SPEAKER_11]: Can't they look at the box?

54:04.315 --> 54:06.476
[SPEAKER_04]: Parents don't know the rating system, I swear.

54:07.016 --> 54:13.840
[SPEAKER_04]: True story, last night I'm at Walmart and I'm looking at the Wii games because I kind of still want to get Trauma Centers.

54:13.880 --> 54:16.622
[SPEAKER_04]: I was kind of looking at how much they're charging for it because I was there to get some other stuff.

54:17.162 --> 54:22.585
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's this parent and the kid is playing Xbox 360, the little demo kiosk, right?

54:22.885 --> 54:24.646
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's going, I want this game, I want this game.

54:24.706 --> 54:26.067
[SPEAKER_04]: And she goes, well, what's it rated?

54:26.707 --> 54:27.748
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good question.

54:27.768 --> 54:28.568
[SPEAKER_04]: She says, what's it rated?

54:28.888 --> 54:30.049
[SPEAKER_04]: And the kid goes, RP.

54:30.549 --> 54:32.070
[SPEAKER_04]: And the mom's all, what's that mean?

54:33.523 --> 54:34.364
[SPEAKER_04]: What does RP mean?

54:34.424 --> 54:34.844
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

54:34.964 --> 54:37.125
[SPEAKER_11]: RP is not even on the list.

54:37.625 --> 54:38.386
[SPEAKER_04]: It's rating pending.

54:38.726 --> 54:38.806
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

54:38.986 --> 54:39.747
[SPEAKER_14]: RP is rating pending.

54:39.767 --> 54:41.307
[SPEAKER_04]: They do have it on the ESRB poster.

54:42.208 --> 54:44.389
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, that's what will fill the wall.

54:44.429 --> 54:46.030
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got some ESRB rating posters.

54:46.050 --> 54:47.731
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a good thing to fill the wall with.

54:47.831 --> 54:49.132
[SPEAKER_04]: So if any parents watch our show, remind them.

54:49.152 --> 54:50.072
[SPEAKER_04]: I have like hundreds of them.

54:50.352 --> 54:57.336
[SPEAKER_04]: And me being the nosy fucker I am, I jumped in there and I said, I was like, it means rating pending.

54:57.376 --> 54:59.097
[SPEAKER_04]: It means like, it's like a movie that hasn't been rated.

54:59.117 --> 55:00.278
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just thinking RPGs.

55:00.298 --> 55:00.558
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.

55:00.578 --> 55:01.018
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

55:01.934 --> 55:03.595
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's the thing.

55:03.655 --> 55:04.595
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been saying this for years.

55:04.655 --> 55:06.216
[SPEAKER_04]: It should mirror the movie system.

55:06.416 --> 55:11.217
[SPEAKER_04]: If it said R or PG-13 or not yet rated, people would know what that meant.

55:12.018 --> 55:13.238
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, well, what's the game?

55:13.338 --> 55:14.699
[SPEAKER_04]: And she said it was Naruto.

55:16.559 --> 55:18.540
[SPEAKER_04]: And I told her, I said, Naruto is based on a cartoon.

55:18.560 --> 55:20.301
[SPEAKER_04]: The worst thing you're going to see in it is cartoon violence.

55:20.341 --> 55:20.881
[SPEAKER_04]: It's teen.

55:21.421 --> 55:22.041
[SPEAKER_04]: It's rated teen.

55:22.061 --> 55:23.081
[SPEAKER_04]: It's rated teen?

55:23.162 --> 55:23.502
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

55:24.202 --> 55:25.542
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of cartoon violence.

55:25.562 --> 55:26.523
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's beating up.

55:27.163 --> 55:27.363
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

55:28.145 --> 55:29.526
[SPEAKER_04]: I told her, I'm like, ah, it's a cartoon.

55:30.006 --> 55:31.287
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fine for your seven-year-old.

55:31.307 --> 55:32.847
[SPEAKER_11]: Oops!

55:33.568 --> 55:39.551
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, that's actually the same thing I think that the anime community has been sort of arguing against people for years now.

55:40.111 --> 55:42.692
[SPEAKER_11]: That just because it's animated doesn't mean it's for kids.

55:43.753 --> 55:44.033
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops.

55:44.953 --> 55:45.954
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you seen Perfect Blue?

55:46.114 --> 55:49.395
[SPEAKER_04]: But I said the worst thing you're going to see in it is cartoon violence.

55:49.595 --> 55:50.616
[SPEAKER_11]: Or boobs.

55:51.036 --> 55:52.657
[SPEAKER_04]: They do not have boobs in Naruto.

55:52.857 --> 55:54.438
[SPEAKER_14]: They do not have boobs in Naruto.

55:54.478 --> 55:54.758
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, they do.

55:56.064 --> 55:57.085
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to see you let your boobs.

55:57.105 --> 55:58.566
[SPEAKER_14]: This is on Cartoon Network, I mean.

55:58.706 --> 56:01.067
[SPEAKER_11]: The sexy nojutsu, yes, you do get boobies.

56:03.309 --> 56:03.609
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

56:04.410 --> 56:04.770
[SPEAKER_11]: Ha ha.

56:04.830 --> 56:07.011
[SPEAKER_14]: If that were the case, that show would be a lot more popular.

56:07.031 --> 56:09.113
[SPEAKER_11]: They are cloud-covered boobies, but they're still boobies.

56:09.433 --> 56:11.194
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah, yeah, here's the thing.

56:11.254 --> 56:16.138
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, and GS68 is like Sky, you know, the Japanese anime cartoons, not necessarily Kid Safe.

56:16.198 --> 56:18.439
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it wasn't La Blue Girl the game, okay?

56:19.099 --> 56:19.700
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't that.

56:19.760 --> 56:20.701
[SPEAKER_04]: It was freaking Naruto.

56:20.741 --> 56:24.203
[SPEAKER_04]: That's rated E. Which is on a rated EC for early childhood.

56:24.998 --> 56:26.760
[SPEAKER_04]: Naruto's on freaking Cartoon Network.

56:26.820 --> 56:27.320
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that.

56:27.400 --> 56:29.322
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think it would be that bad.

56:30.623 --> 56:32.345
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, so what's the worst that happens?

56:32.665 --> 56:34.327
[SPEAKER_04]: Some seven-year-old kid sees boobies.

56:34.467 --> 56:35.227
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

56:39.331 --> 56:39.852
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

56:41.573 --> 56:42.394
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

56:43.455 --> 56:43.715
[SPEAKER_14]: Ding.

56:45.757 --> 56:46.618
[SPEAKER_14]: I did that on purpose.

56:49.020 --> 56:49.760
[SPEAKER_14]: So, anyways.

56:50.962 --> 56:51.442
[SPEAKER_14]: I love doing that.

56:52.475 --> 56:54.996
[SPEAKER_14]: A watchdog group, of course, the Nymph.

56:55.716 --> 56:59.017
[SPEAKER_14]: They gave the game industry AC.

56:59.317 --> 57:03.578
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, each year they put out their video game report card.

57:04.519 --> 57:08.340
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, this is like one of those things... WHO THE FUCK ARE THESE PEOPLE AND WHY SHOULD I CARE?

57:09.140 --> 57:15.162
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, they are the National Institute on Media and the Family.

57:15.862 --> 57:24.869
[SPEAKER_14]: They basically will do those wonderful undercover stings where they'll see if people will sell them M-rated games and stuff like that, or their kids and whatnot.

57:27.311 --> 57:34.597
[SPEAKER_14]: Really, my thing is, who gives a shit if they're rating so... You know, if I rated the industry an F, would people give a shit that I'm rating an F?

57:34.677 --> 57:35.638
[SPEAKER_14]: No one really cares.

57:35.678 --> 57:43.364
[SPEAKER_04]: This industry, or watchdog organization, excuse me, this watchdog organization sounds like the group in Footloose that told the townspeople they can't dance.

57:44.159 --> 57:44.919
[SPEAKER_14]: Something like that.

57:45.900 --> 57:48.580
[SPEAKER_14]: But apparently they've conducted a lot of research.

57:49.461 --> 57:58.424
[SPEAKER_14]: They found that 52% of the parents claim to use the ESRB rating system, but 72% know little or nothing about the rating system overall.

58:01.204 --> 58:02.625
[SPEAKER_14]: 72 plus 52 does not equal 100.

58:03.445 --> 58:04.265
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm confused.

58:04.405 --> 58:07.907
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, people use it despite the fact that they don't know anything about it.

58:08.687 --> 58:12.548
[SPEAKER_14]: That has... So that game's rated M. I like the letter M!

58:13.055 --> 58:13.695
[SPEAKER_14]: Go, son!

58:13.755 --> 58:14.375
[SPEAKER_14]: You can buy it!

58:14.576 --> 58:16.396
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, is that how they do it?

58:16.416 --> 58:17.237
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, seriously.

58:18.017 --> 58:20.498
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody cut loose, put loose.

58:20.678 --> 58:29.281
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, undercover shoppers that were under the age of 18 were able to buy M-rated games at nearly 50% of the time.

58:31.122 --> 58:32.422
[SPEAKER_14]: But really, here's the thing, though.

58:32.882 --> 58:35.743
[SPEAKER_14]: It's store policy not to sell M-rated games to minors.

58:35.903 --> 58:37.904
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no law that says they have to do that.

58:38.004 --> 58:38.944
[SPEAKER_14]: So what's it matter?

58:39.545 --> 58:40.785
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I would tell them that.

58:41.704 --> 58:42.404
[SPEAKER_14]: To their faces?

58:42.905 --> 58:45.366
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, if I was a person, they'd be like, why?

58:45.386 --> 58:48.048
[SPEAKER_01]: You sold me an emery to game and I'm under 18.

58:48.348 --> 58:50.930
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, so?

58:51.110 --> 58:53.931
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you should join one of these watchdog organizations just for laughs.

58:55.432 --> 58:56.793
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe like an undercover report.

58:57.193 --> 58:59.335
[SPEAKER_04]: What really goes on in these watchdog organizations?

59:00.896 --> 59:04.578
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see a watchdog organization for the watchdog organizations.

59:05.774 --> 59:06.474
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

59:06.715 --> 59:07.515
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to rate them.

59:08.295 --> 59:09.636
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a fabulous idea.

59:09.716 --> 59:11.757
[SPEAKER_04]: So what would we call our watchdog organization?

59:12.538 --> 59:12.998
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

59:13.198 --> 59:13.478
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

59:13.798 --> 59:14.499
[SPEAKER_04]: You think about that.

59:14.579 --> 59:15.019
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat room.

59:15.199 --> 59:16.540
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm putting that challenge to you guys.

59:16.940 --> 59:17.120
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.

59:17.380 --> 59:17.480
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.

59:17.681 --> 59:17.861
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.

59:17.921 --> 59:18.081
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

59:18.141 --> 59:18.401
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

59:18.581 --> 59:18.901
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

59:19.522 --> 59:21.823
[SPEAKER_14]: Their nymph, I'll be nympho.

59:24.905 --> 59:25.485
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that.

59:26.065 --> 59:27.646
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what the O would stand for.

59:31.248 --> 59:31.808
[SPEAKER_14]: Overseer.

59:31.828 --> 59:32.289
[SPEAKER_14]: There we go.

59:32.309 --> 59:32.929
[SPEAKER_14]: That'll work.

59:34.178 --> 59:37.580
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be the National Institute on Media and Family Overseer.

59:39.181 --> 59:39.641
[SPEAKER_14]: Nympho.

59:40.562 --> 59:40.802
[SPEAKER_14]: Love it.

59:41.702 --> 59:42.643
[SPEAKER_09]: That's beautiful.

59:44.864 --> 59:46.925
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the greatest insights to come.

59:46.965 --> 59:50.888
[SPEAKER_03]: And, like, the years I've been doing this radio program, that's one of the greatest, I'll tell you.

59:53.069 --> 59:53.369
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

59:53.489 --> 59:54.270
[SPEAKER_11]: That's lovely.

59:55.790 --> 59:56.391
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Rosteel, you too.

59:56.411 --> 59:57.191
[SPEAKER_11]: You did it, too.

59:57.551 --> 59:58.312
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this.

59:58.452 --> 59:59.252
[SPEAKER_10]: You did it.

59:59.332 --> 59:59.753
[SPEAKER_04]: You did it.

59:59.773 --> 59:59.893
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

01:00:00.113 --> 01:00:00.833
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, forget it.

01:00:01.434 --> 01:00:01.774
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

01:00:02.367 --> 01:00:06.628
[SPEAKER_04]: Rostio UT says, The Institute for a Media Whore Free America.

01:00:09.169 --> 01:00:12.330
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Tetsuya says, National Institute Media Family, OLR.

01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:15.631
[SPEAKER_04]: Frisbee says, OLR is watching you poop.

01:00:17.131 --> 01:00:17.911
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about that one.

01:00:17.931 --> 01:00:18.771
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to watch that.

01:00:18.791 --> 01:00:21.952
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is wrong with you people?

01:00:22.693 --> 01:00:24.233
[SPEAKER_04]: OLR is watching you poop in a tube.

01:00:24.313 --> 01:00:25.013
[SPEAKER_04]: That's gross.

01:00:26.334 --> 01:00:30.515
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Loki watched those two girls poop in a cup, but that's something completely different.

01:00:30.535 --> 01:00:31.635
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of people watch that

01:00:32.205 --> 01:00:36.391
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, moving on, let's talk about EVE Online.

01:00:49.785 --> 01:00:52.728
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened is that there was a new update that went out.

01:00:52.768 --> 01:00:54.870
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the Premium Trinity patch.

01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:58.313
[SPEAKER_04]: And it went out a little earlier this week, I think about Thursday-ish.

01:00:58.633 --> 01:01:08.521
[SPEAKER_04]: And what happened is that it added a bunch of new features to the game, but the patch also removed the boot.ini file off of your Windows XP.

01:01:09.822 --> 01:01:10.583
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray!

01:01:11.644 --> 01:01:13.986
[SPEAKER_04]: Which kind of fucks your operating system.

01:01:15.953 --> 01:01:18.014
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was a quote from the official support page.

01:01:18.094 --> 01:01:24.857
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote, if you are only using the classic client or installed the premium client using the full premium installer, then you are not affected.

01:01:25.237 --> 01:01:29.899
[SPEAKER_04]: If you upgraded the classic client to the premium client using the content upgrade, then please read on.

01:01:30.339 --> 01:01:34.060
[SPEAKER_04]: Check the root directory of your hard drive and see if you have a boot.ini file.

01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:35.861
[SPEAKER_04]: If so, then you are not affected.

01:01:36.753 --> 01:01:44.259
[SPEAKER_04]: The file is normally hidden, so you need to click Tools, Folder Options, View and Select, show hidden files and folders, and uncheck Hide Protected Operating System.

01:01:44.299 --> 01:01:45.080
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just be able to see it.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.341
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also blah, blah, blah, blah, so on and so on.

01:01:48.122 --> 01:01:50.884
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck were you doing touching that file in the first place?

01:01:50.944 --> 01:01:51.885
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to know.

01:01:52.686 --> 01:01:53.726
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, how did that happen?

01:01:54.487 --> 01:02:01.593
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, seriously, there's a part of me that goes, some pissed off bitch in this organization, like, threw that in there just to, like, fuck with these guys.

01:02:02.073 --> 01:02:02.834
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so sad.

01:02:02.874 --> 01:02:04.135
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet she's planning on quitting.

01:02:05.256 --> 01:02:05.476
[SPEAKER_10]: And so...

01:02:06.178 --> 01:02:11.202
[SPEAKER_10]: Program, delete, boot.ini Bye, my two weeks are up.

01:02:12.122 --> 01:02:13.744
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know how the program works.

01:02:15.165 --> 01:02:15.805
[SPEAKER_04]: For real.

01:02:15.925 --> 01:02:16.546
[SPEAKER_10]: I quit.

01:02:18.067 --> 01:02:20.188
[SPEAKER_04]: Frisbee says, uh-oh, SpaghettiOs.

01:02:20.368 --> 01:02:22.150
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll take my severance pay now.

01:02:25.592 --> 01:02:27.353
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun storming the castle.

01:02:27.754 --> 01:02:27.974
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

01:02:29.113 --> 01:02:30.713
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, don't touch the boot.info.

01:02:30.733 --> 01:02:37.335
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, Windows XP should, like, you know, if you're going to delete a file like that, it should go, are you sure?

01:02:38.115 --> 01:02:43.296
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Windows XP should have a little dialog box that says, when you delete this file, you will fuck your whole computer up.

01:02:43.697 --> 01:02:45.597
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you sure you want to delete this file?

01:02:45.677 --> 01:02:47.517
[SPEAKER_04]: And a little picture of Bill Gates going, no, no, no.

01:02:47.537 --> 01:02:48.478
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet there is something.

01:02:48.998 --> 01:02:57.540
[SPEAKER_11]: But, like, even if it is, like, if this person now that I'm imagining is going, click yes for are you sure.

01:03:00.976 --> 01:03:03.417
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob D says it sounds like the SimCopter bug.

01:03:03.497 --> 01:03:04.758
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember the SimCopter bug?

01:03:05.178 --> 01:03:17.204
[SPEAKER_04]: Where it was one of the first appearances of same-sex relations in a game because a gay programmer actually programmed it in there that guys would kiss guys on this guy's birthday and then left the company.

01:03:17.644 --> 01:03:18.244
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great.

01:03:18.985 --> 01:03:20.085
[SPEAKER_14]: It was more than that, I think.

01:03:21.306 --> 01:03:23.087
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a lot more than kissing going on there.

01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:25.353
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, this is a family show.

01:03:25.393 --> 01:03:26.133
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need to go there.

01:03:26.393 --> 01:03:27.554
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, this is a family show.

01:03:28.354 --> 01:03:30.594
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a dysfunctional family show.

01:03:31.194 --> 01:03:35.275
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we're going to open up the Skype line and welcome the extended members of our dysfunctional family.

01:03:35.315 --> 01:03:38.136
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be you folks, the listeners.

01:03:38.156 --> 01:03:39.036
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:03:39.156 --> 01:03:40.996
[SPEAKER_04]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

01:03:41.277 --> 01:03:48.218
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am dying to see how this works tonight when I only have half the strength out here on the Wi-Fi network out in the garage and we're trying to stream a show.

01:03:49.198 --> 01:03:51.519
[SPEAKER_04]: This could be very interesting, so we'll see what happens.

01:03:51.559 --> 01:03:52.119
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:03:54.261 --> 01:03:54.721
[SPEAKER_04]: Who are you?

01:03:54.741 --> 01:03:55.422
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your name?

01:04:22.463 --> 01:04:24.164
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you probably bought a case mod.

01:04:25.325 --> 01:04:25.746
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably.

01:04:27.147 --> 01:04:27.827
[SPEAKER_12]: Or maybe eBay.

01:04:27.847 --> 01:04:28.828
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't remember anymore.

01:04:29.128 --> 01:04:29.809
[SPEAKER_12]: My memory's fading.

01:04:30.229 --> 01:04:35.453
[SPEAKER_11]: They did sell though a new case for the Dreamcast that you could make that was clear.

01:04:35.754 --> 01:04:38.476
[SPEAKER_11]: And they also sold a bootleg of the Hello Kitty one too.

01:04:40.317 --> 01:04:41.298
[SPEAKER_12]: Does Rob got that one?

01:04:42.098 --> 01:04:42.619
[SPEAKER_12]: Do I have what?

01:04:43.578 --> 01:04:44.759
[SPEAKER_12]: The Hello Kitty Dreamcast?

01:04:44.979 --> 01:04:46.461
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I do not have the Hello Kitty Dreamcast.

01:04:46.561 --> 01:04:53.427
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually very excited because I found that I have two Dreamcasts, but then this guy named Loki said that one of his is his.

01:04:56.209 --> 01:04:56.750
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up with that?

01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:58.912
[SPEAKER_04]: Why am I hearing myself?

01:05:00.333 --> 01:05:00.774
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that better?

01:05:00.954 --> 01:05:01.374
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry about that.

01:05:01.394 --> 01:05:01.855
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, much better.

01:05:01.975 --> 01:05:02.235
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

01:05:06.509 --> 01:05:08.010
[SPEAKER_12]: GameTap, GameTap's on my mind.

01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:10.571
[SPEAKER_12]: I got Fremont from GameTap, very nice of them.

01:05:10.832 --> 01:05:14.554
[SPEAKER_12]: You've realized they released a Mac client to their beautiful GameTap?

01:05:14.574 --> 01:05:14.854
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

01:05:21.454 --> 01:05:22.475
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's one of the ones that's getting removed.

01:05:22.635 --> 01:05:23.155
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the thing.

01:05:23.736 --> 01:05:25.817
[SPEAKER_04]: We got linked the Wikipedia article.

01:05:25.837 --> 01:05:26.117
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

01:05:26.538 --> 01:05:33.463
[SPEAKER_04]: The game game controversy when a designer inserted sprites of shirtless himbos, male bimbos, in speedo trunks.

01:05:33.503 --> 01:05:34.804
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that term, himbos.

01:05:34.884 --> 01:05:36.345
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to use that in a sentence every day.

01:05:36.985 --> 01:05:41.488
[SPEAKER_04]: In speedo trunks who hugged and kissed each other who appear in great numbers on certain dates.

01:05:41.889 --> 01:05:49.394
[SPEAKER_04]: Their fluorescent nipples were drawn with a special rendering mode usually reserved for fog-piercing runway landing lights.

01:05:49.813 --> 01:05:53.054
[SPEAKER_04]: So they could easily be seen from long distances in bad weathers.

01:05:53.634 --> 01:06:04.738
[SPEAKER_04]: An unintended emergent behavior of the code caused hundreds of himbos to swarm and crowd around the helicopter where they would be slashed up by the blades and then need to be airlifted to the hospital, which earned the player easy money.

01:06:05.218 --> 01:06:08.819
[SPEAKER_04]: The Easter egg was caught shortly after release and removed from future copies of the game.

01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:11.700
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the designer was fired.

01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:12.221
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't leave.

01:06:12.261 --> 01:06:13.201
[SPEAKER_04]: He got fired.

01:06:13.521 --> 01:06:14.821
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's how you access it, too.

01:06:15.142 --> 01:06:19.063
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, if you go into the game, you go into career mode, hit control, alt, X.

01:06:19.605 --> 01:06:27.748
[SPEAKER_14]: Warp Me to Career 29 Control Alt X 300 guys in bathing suits will appear For fun, since there are no military helicopters in the game, fire tear gas at them.

01:06:27.768 --> 01:06:28.248
[SPEAKER_14]: That's just wrong.

01:06:45.362 --> 01:06:46.382
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, sorry, Ravenstaff.

01:06:46.682 --> 01:06:47.802
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree with that.

01:06:47.842 --> 01:06:54.384
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was disgruntled someone, but who the fuck is messing with the freaking IDF file to corrupt your computer?

01:06:54.484 --> 01:06:59.445
[SPEAKER_12]: They ever thought to them that it doesn't start your operating system.

01:06:59.585 --> 01:07:01.505
[SPEAKER_12]: So how the hell do you find it in the first place?

01:07:01.525 --> 01:07:04.105
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody needs to explain funny, not funny.

01:07:04.385 --> 01:07:07.386
[SPEAKER_04]: Deleting my boot INI file, not funny.

01:07:07.766 --> 01:07:08.946
[SPEAKER_04]: Himbos, funny.

01:07:09.906 --> 01:07:12.747
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're going to do something disgruntled, make it funny.

01:07:14.795 --> 01:07:15.855
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but you can't find it.

01:07:15.955 --> 01:07:20.957
[SPEAKER_12]: They said their thing is like, you can't get into the operating system, how do you find it?

01:07:20.997 --> 01:07:21.517
[SPEAKER_04]: You're screwed.

01:07:21.857 --> 01:07:23.638
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to use a disk, basically.

01:07:24.638 --> 01:07:27.019
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, what was the other thing you wanted to call in about tonight?

01:07:27.659 --> 01:07:29.379
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about the Mac client of GameTap.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.961
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a brand new Mac client.

01:07:33.461 --> 01:07:35.381
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to check it out.

01:07:35.461 --> 01:07:38.182
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you still have to have the Intel chip in your Mac?

01:07:38.282 --> 01:07:38.742
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

01:07:39.343 --> 01:07:40.523
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't use it.

01:07:41.823 --> 01:07:42.103
[SPEAKER_12]: Lame.

01:07:43.024 --> 01:07:44.004
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's much lighter than

01:07:44.545 --> 01:07:48.607
[SPEAKER_12]: More games run smoothly on the Mac and on the Windows side as well.

01:07:48.647 --> 01:07:50.427
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything runs great on both sides.

01:07:50.467 --> 01:07:53.388
[SPEAKER_04]: But now you can't run the Windows-based games on the Mac, right?

01:07:53.408 --> 01:07:54.789
[SPEAKER_04]: They just took that category out of it.

01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:55.629
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, that's gone.

01:07:55.949 --> 01:07:56.309
[SPEAKER_12]: I figured.

01:07:56.370 --> 01:08:00.391
[SPEAKER_12]: The Windows games, so you lost like 800 games on the Mac side.

01:08:01.371 --> 01:08:04.993
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, but you still get all the arcade games.

01:08:05.033 --> 01:08:06.413
[SPEAKER_04]: You get the Genesis games.

01:08:06.553 --> 01:08:07.214
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, that's cool.

01:08:07.434 --> 01:08:07.634
[SPEAKER_04]: Atari 2600?

01:08:08.871 --> 01:08:09.211
[SPEAKER_04]: DOS.

01:08:10.112 --> 01:08:11.073
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you get the DOS games?

01:08:11.613 --> 01:08:12.835
[SPEAKER_04]: You get DOS games as well.

01:08:12.855 --> 01:08:14.176
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that makes sense, because of the chip.

01:08:14.196 --> 01:08:14.756
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's cool.

01:08:15.137 --> 01:08:15.677
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, good.

01:08:15.737 --> 01:08:15.937
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad.

01:08:15.957 --> 01:08:21.142
[SPEAKER_04]: There were a lot of people really pissed off about the fact that there was no GameTab Mac client, so good for them making good on that.

01:08:22.843 --> 01:08:24.505
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to add one thing to that.

01:08:26.066 --> 01:08:28.208
[SPEAKER_12]: I got a free month from them, so I'm happy about that.

01:08:28.588 --> 01:08:29.689
[SPEAKER_12]: Who'd you have to blow to get that?

01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:31.211
[SPEAKER_12]: No one.

01:08:31.231 --> 01:08:36.015
[SPEAKER_12]: I just said I had problems with the PC version, and I'm like, well, we'll just add another free month for you.

01:08:37.639 --> 01:08:39.821
[SPEAKER_04]: Dang, I'm going to call GameTap and tell them I have some problems.

01:08:41.602 --> 01:08:44.665
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, my boot.ini file got deleted by your client.

01:08:45.065 --> 01:08:45.706
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what happens.

01:08:46.286 --> 01:08:49.229
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, RavensDolphin, any other quick thoughts before we let you go and get to somebody else?

01:08:50.197 --> 01:08:52.057
[SPEAKER_12]: No, but I think that sucks.

01:08:52.097 --> 01:09:00.680
[SPEAKER_12]: How do you get a game like that and just boot a game and you go like, well, I got it, and then you restart your computer and you're like, what the fuck?

01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:01.440
What happened?

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:02.980
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it sucks to be those guys.

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:06.601
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really sorry to all the EVE Online players who got fucked over by that one.

01:09:06.621 --> 01:09:07.361
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks to you.

01:09:07.481 --> 01:09:08.341
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'm going back to Godfather.

01:09:08.661 --> 01:09:09.222
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, see ya.

01:09:10.602 --> 01:09:12.983
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, if you want to give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR.

01:09:13.043 --> 01:09:15.083
[SPEAKER_04]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

01:09:15.103 --> 01:09:17.784
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll also get to some last-minute stories, and then the show is done.

01:09:18.344 --> 01:09:18.804
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray!

01:09:20.074 --> 01:09:23.396
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, aw, that's sad, because then there's no more OLR till next week.

01:09:23.416 --> 01:09:24.077
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you going to do?

01:09:24.978 --> 01:09:28.660
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, phone's not ringing just yet, so let's get a couple quick last-minute stories.

01:09:29.361 --> 01:09:30.501
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I lied, here it comes.

01:09:31.762 --> 01:09:33.023
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

01:09:34.244 --> 01:09:37.066
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Sky, it's Jonathan F., your fantasy star whore.

01:09:37.286 --> 01:09:39.748
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hello, our fantasy star whore, how are you?

01:09:41.129 --> 01:09:43.591
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing just fine here.

01:09:43.671 --> 01:09:46.913
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you playing The Abortion of the Illuminists, or whatever that's called?

01:09:48.388 --> 01:09:49.849
[SPEAKER_13]: Ambition of the Illuminist, actually.

01:09:50.089 --> 01:09:50.410
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, I see.

01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:54.973
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you can find me running around in a rappy called Brightstar.

01:09:55.914 --> 01:10:01.018
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, I wanted to just call in and let you know about some of the big stories that are going on right now with this.

01:10:02.239 --> 01:10:05.701
[SPEAKER_13]: The first big one is that there's actually another expansion coming out.

01:10:06.602 --> 01:10:09.665
[SPEAKER_13]: But the thing about this one is that it's for the PSP only.

01:10:10.485 --> 01:10:13.207
[SPEAKER_13]: And funny enough, it's named... Wait, the PSP?

01:10:13.708 --> 01:10:15.349
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, PSP's getting a fancy Stargame.

01:10:16.417 --> 01:10:18.039
[SPEAKER_14]: So wait, this can't be an expansion.

01:10:18.059 --> 01:10:18.999
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a whole new game, right?

01:10:19.019 --> 01:10:19.500
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a whole new game.

01:10:20.881 --> 01:10:26.867
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, basically what it is, it's going to expand upon the story that's already there and add some new missions into it.

01:10:28.268 --> 01:10:34.013
[SPEAKER_13]: And the real funny thing about it is that when you condense it from its original name, Phantasy Star Portable, it makes PSP.

01:10:35.714 --> 01:10:36.475
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there you go.

01:10:36.495 --> 01:10:37.716
[SPEAKER_04]: So PSP on the PSP.

01:10:39.238 --> 01:10:39.638
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

01:10:40.319 --> 01:10:40.739
[SPEAKER_04]: There you have it.

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:42.040
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:42.620
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, go ahead.

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:43.120
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, go ahead.

01:11:08.638 --> 01:11:08.998
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

01:11:09.618 --> 01:11:26.002
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, what's coming back in this version, actually, starting in just a couple of short weeks here in Japan, or over in Japan, I mean, there's going to be an event called the Maximum Attack G, whereby they are bringing back some of the original Phantasy Star Online stages.

01:11:27.222 --> 01:11:28.582
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, that could be kind of cool.

01:11:29.542 --> 01:11:31.523
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

01:11:31.763 --> 01:11:33.003
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to bring back Cave...

01:11:33.829 --> 01:11:36.951
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, what were the names of those stages in the old one?

01:11:36.971 --> 01:11:38.693
[SPEAKER_04]: They had Cave and, what, Ship?

01:11:40.154 --> 01:11:44.977
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the Forest, Cave, Mines, and Ruins, they are all confirmed at this point, pretty much.

01:11:45.157 --> 01:11:46.178
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, that's kind of cool.

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:54.744
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any Episode 2, 3, or 4 stages coming back, but who knows, that could be for yet another expansion.

01:11:55.364 --> 01:11:56.745
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I need to get back.

01:11:56.805 --> 01:12:01.629
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, dammit, I am getting so sick of some of the MMOs I'm playing now, I think I need to give PSU another shot.

01:12:02.358 --> 01:12:03.698
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I need to give this game another shot.

01:12:03.759 --> 01:12:04.039
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do.

01:12:04.059 --> 01:12:04.499
[SPEAKER_10]: You want mine?

01:12:05.099 --> 01:12:05.279
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

01:12:05.519 --> 01:12:05.899
[SPEAKER_10]: You want mine?

01:12:05.939 --> 01:12:06.640
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I have the game.

01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:08.060
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I was going to burn mine.

01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:13.722
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking about, wait, how much does Abortion of the Illuminous cost to download on Xbox?

01:12:16.043 --> 01:12:19.744
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was 2,000 points.

01:12:19.764 --> 01:12:20.404
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm trying to remember.

01:12:20.845 --> 01:12:21.305
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not too bad.

01:12:21.385 --> 01:12:22.025
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about 20 bucks.

01:12:22.985 --> 01:12:23.225
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:12:23.245 --> 01:12:23.946
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to think about it.

01:12:25.126 --> 01:12:25.546
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

01:12:25.626 --> 01:12:27.507
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some things about PSU I kind of miss.

01:12:27.907 --> 01:12:29.568
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't horrible, so I don't know.

01:12:29.588 --> 01:12:30.408
[SPEAKER_11]: I miss PSO.

01:12:31.391 --> 01:12:33.653
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard they're, you know what, we got news coming in.

01:12:33.693 --> 01:12:36.194
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this true that they're shutting off Blue Burst?

01:12:36.655 --> 01:12:36.795
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

01:12:36.855 --> 01:12:38.696
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that was going to be the next thing.

01:12:39.637 --> 01:12:40.237
[SPEAKER_13]: The U.S.

01:12:40.297 --> 01:12:42.559
[SPEAKER_13]: Blue Burst servers are going down.

01:12:43.059 --> 01:12:44.160
[SPEAKER_11]: That's stupid.

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:47.082
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I was actually going to start playing that again.

01:12:50.184 --> 01:12:56.669
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the big questions right now is, is the, is Clumsy Orbit and the rest of the GM team going to,

01:12:57.099 --> 01:12:57.840
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:13:25.854 --> 01:13:31.538
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, we've got to let you go here as soon as we can get some more calls, but any last thoughts from our Phantasy Star whore, Jonathan F.?

01:13:32.658 --> 01:13:33.419
[SPEAKER_13]: Just one thing.

01:13:33.459 --> 01:13:37.982
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to announce a little project I'm working on for the 20th anniversary of Phantasy Star.

01:13:38.282 --> 01:13:39.503
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, go for it.

01:13:40.283 --> 01:13:53.031
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called Phantasy Star Dreams Forever, and basically what it is, it's a remix album, which basically goes through the history of Phantasy Star from the original Sega Master System game all the way up to the Phantasy Star universe,

01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:58.233
[SPEAKER_13]: and it's going to be a track list of about 108 tracks that's going to basically be all developed by the community.

01:13:58.273 --> 01:14:03.517
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just going to take more of a general manager position on things here aside from maybe just a couple of contributions.

01:14:04.017 --> 01:14:08.200
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can read up all the details at the website, fantasystarmonthly.com.

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:09.681
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.

01:14:09.741 --> 01:14:10.741
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, good luck on that project.

01:14:10.761 --> 01:14:12.763
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a pretty big project you guys are taking on.

01:14:13.163 --> 01:14:19.587
[SPEAKER_04]: And since we are a radio station, send us some of the upbeat radio-friendly tracks when it's done and we'll put some in rotation on the station.

01:14:20.731 --> 01:14:22.133
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, there's one online right now.

01:14:22.193 --> 01:14:24.817
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want, I'll send you a link to it through the chat.

01:14:25.237 --> 01:14:25.578
[SPEAKER_04]: Do that.

01:14:26.819 --> 01:14:27.060
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:27.380
[SPEAKER_04]: Please do.

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:27.701
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:14:27.721 --> 01:14:28.462
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to you so much.

01:14:28.902 --> 01:14:30.264
[SPEAKER_04]: And have fun with Phantasy Star.

01:14:30.785 --> 01:14:31.426
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe see you soon.

01:14:31.446 --> 01:14:31.686
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:14:31.826 --> 01:14:32.828
[SPEAKER_04]: Always glad to be on the show.

01:14:33.028 --> 01:14:33.268
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:14:33.308 --> 01:14:33.689
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

01:14:36.951 --> 01:14:38.933
[SPEAKER_04]: Jonathan was out here a long time ago.

01:14:39.414 --> 01:14:39.914
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember him?

01:14:40.075 --> 01:14:43.479
[SPEAKER_04]: He came out here a long, long time ago and he was talking about tech TV and stuff.

01:14:43.499 --> 01:14:43.979
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty good.

01:14:44.279 --> 01:14:45.341
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to hear he's listening again.

01:14:45.741 --> 01:14:50.827
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, call us, 877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:14:51.968 --> 01:14:53.510
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get some last minute stories real quick.

01:14:53.710 --> 01:14:53.850
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:55.232
[SPEAKER_14]: They're breaking the studio.

01:14:56.112 --> 01:14:57.473
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, they're throwing those stuff.

01:14:57.674 --> 01:15:00.456
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, the stuffed animals are there to look cute, not to be thrown.

01:15:01.077 --> 01:15:02.178
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care if all the lead is off.

01:15:02.198 --> 01:15:03.379
[SPEAKER_14]: One last story here real quick.

01:15:03.799 --> 01:15:11.346
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently a dad has caught, or there was a dad who caught his son smoking pot.

01:15:11.647 --> 01:15:17.752
[SPEAKER_14]: So what he did was he put his son's Guitar Hero 3 Christmas gift up on the eBay to punish him.

01:15:19.514 --> 01:15:20.275
[SPEAKER_14]: That's news?

01:15:21.138 --> 01:15:21.858
[SPEAKER_14]: That is news.

01:15:21.878 --> 01:15:22.739
[SPEAKER_11]: That's smart.

01:15:22.759 --> 01:15:24.080
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great parenting.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.820
[SPEAKER_14]: That is wonderful parenting.

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:26.241
[SPEAKER_14]: I love it.

01:15:26.781 --> 01:15:28.482
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's actually still on eBay right now.

01:15:29.642 --> 01:15:29.923
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

01:15:31.744 --> 01:15:32.904
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:15:32.944 --> 01:15:33.364
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

01:15:34.105 --> 01:15:34.845
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Legend of Zaku.

01:15:35.145 --> 01:15:35.806
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Zaku.

01:15:35.906 --> 01:15:36.406
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

01:15:37.486 --> 01:15:39.387
[SPEAKER_07]: Nah, just nothing chilling.

01:15:39.547 --> 01:15:41.929
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, going through the gaming week as usual.

01:15:42.809 --> 01:15:44.190
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let me rephrase the question.

01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:46.311
[SPEAKER_04]: To what do we owe this telephone call tonight?

01:15:47.439 --> 01:15:58.768
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I don't know, the usual arrow-smashing news, like, you know, how Supernova 2 is supposed to come out this month, and the fact that Betson is being dicks about holding EMUs back.

01:16:00.909 --> 01:16:07.774
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm, um, yeah, I mean, I guess I've heard about Supernova 2, but, you know, I had a real... Zach, I want to share with you my revelation I had the other day.

01:16:07.954 --> 01:16:10.216
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I talk to you, you know, man-to-man a little bit?

01:16:10.656 --> 01:16:12.217
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a revelation I had the other day, is that...

01:16:13.733 --> 01:16:17.195
[SPEAKER_04]: I was on Xbox Live and I was playing Portal, because I've been playing Portal a lot this week.

01:16:17.415 --> 01:16:26.781
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know my buddy Shane used to work at Konami, has had a big part in DDR, and he doesn't live here in California, he lives in Kansas, so we talk a lot over Xbox Live.

01:16:27.061 --> 01:16:29.102
[SPEAKER_04]: And I noticed that he was playing DDR Universe 2.

01:16:29.742 --> 01:16:34.805
[SPEAKER_04]: And he sent me a message on Xbox Live and he said, you know, Universe 2, blah, blah, blah, and he was telling me his thoughts on the game.

01:16:34.845 --> 01:16:38.247
[SPEAKER_04]: And I came to a realization, Zaku, and that realization was,

01:16:38.769 --> 01:16:39.970
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of over DDR.

01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:40.931
[SPEAKER_04]: I really am.

01:16:42.372 --> 01:16:46.095
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a lot that I care about that's going on in DDR anymore.

01:16:46.455 --> 01:16:49.318
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not getting a boner over Supernova 2 like a lot of people are.

01:16:49.778 --> 01:16:54.602
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's sad to say, because obviously without DDR this show would not exist.

01:16:54.682 --> 01:16:56.203
[SPEAKER_04]: Without DDR I would not know Jamie.

01:16:56.263 --> 01:16:57.544
[SPEAKER_04]: Without DDR I would not know Loki.

01:16:58.025 --> 01:16:59.246
[SPEAKER_04]: Without DDR I would not know Puppy.

01:17:00.286 --> 01:17:03.549
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR has fucked up my life in so many good ways.

01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:04.570
[SPEAKER_04]: And bad.

01:17:05.086 --> 01:17:07.347
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because there was that house I lived in five years ago.

01:17:07.367 --> 01:17:08.287
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a whole other story.

01:17:08.868 --> 01:17:10.868
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR has... Real World Rob Edition.

01:17:11.008 --> 01:17:11.629
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

01:17:11.969 --> 01:17:12.369
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

01:17:12.509 --> 01:17:13.149
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.

01:17:13.489 --> 01:17:14.510
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not so bad.

01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:15.930
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, people grow out of it.

01:17:16.291 --> 01:17:19.052
[SPEAKER_07]: People stay on and live all of their lives.

01:17:19.192 --> 01:17:21.513
[SPEAKER_04]: Zaku, I didn't grow out of DDR.

01:17:21.933 --> 01:17:23.494
[SPEAKER_04]: You just don't care about it as much anymore.

01:17:23.514 --> 01:17:27.295
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR has refused to change over the past five years.

01:17:27.415 --> 01:17:28.776
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the problem I'm having with it.

01:17:28.836 --> 01:17:31.757
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same fucking game I played five years ago, and I'm just kind of done with it.

01:17:33.123 --> 01:17:39.108
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but I mean, I know people, most of the people that I know, they used to, you know, they're like some of the best in the city.

01:17:39.788 --> 01:17:40.849
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't play as much anymore.

01:17:40.889 --> 01:17:41.930
[SPEAKER_07]: They pretty much moved on.

01:17:43.334 --> 01:17:48.897
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you, if Konami wants to bring me back, they just need to innovate the game.

01:17:49.117 --> 01:17:49.877
[SPEAKER_04]: It's possible.

01:17:50.198 --> 01:17:56.441
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to do it in little ways on the consoles, but they need to do it in a major way in the arcade and bring people back.

01:17:56.461 --> 01:18:00.343
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, in the arcade they tried EMUs, but there's other factors that are holding it back.

01:18:00.543 --> 01:18:05.065
[SPEAKER_07]: From what I hear, Betson is the reason why it's not happening in this country at all.

01:18:05.465 --> 01:18:07.626
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't believe that it's going to be successful.

01:18:11.530 --> 01:18:17.096
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know Konami does their, you know, tries their damn hardest and it's just other folks that are just being dicks about it.

01:18:17.236 --> 01:18:23.583
[SPEAKER_07]: And not, you know, they're just, they're just non-believers and, you know, it's like they don't really give a shit about it.

01:18:25.536 --> 01:18:27.637
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I knew more about programming.

01:18:27.697 --> 01:18:33.120
[SPEAKER_04]: I would want to design my own music game that was dancing that's not a ripoff of DDR or in the groove or any of that stuff.

01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:35.742
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I have a lot of ideas floating around my head for the past five years.

01:18:35.902 --> 01:18:36.642
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wish I could do it.

01:18:36.742 --> 01:18:36.942
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

01:18:37.162 --> 01:18:40.144
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't they make a ParaPara game but without ParaPara music?

01:18:40.204 --> 01:18:44.486
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I remember when fucking Prestige used to fucking break out the Para shit.

01:18:44.647 --> 01:18:45.707
[SPEAKER_14]: That was kind of cool looking.

01:18:46.347 --> 01:18:50.250
[SPEAKER_14]: Granted, you know, people would make fun of it just like DDR, but it was a little different.

01:18:50.690 --> 01:18:50.870
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

01:18:52.293 --> 01:18:57.595
[SPEAKER_15]: or they could just add a Ticket Redemption game to DDR and there you go.

01:18:57.615 --> 01:19:00.276
[SPEAKER_15]: Just throw it in a grave while you're at it.

01:19:00.356 --> 01:19:01.977
[SPEAKER_07]: Ever heard of that game Spider Stomp?

01:19:02.357 --> 01:19:04.217
[SPEAKER_07]: Spider Stomp?

01:19:04.257 --> 01:19:07.339
[SPEAKER_07]: Those red buttons on the floor and you get tickets out of them.

01:19:07.579 --> 01:19:13.881
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't that predate DDR a little bit more than it already is?

01:19:14.642 --> 01:19:16.364
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:19:24.346 --> 01:19:27.429
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they have a DDR Supernova machine there, right?

01:19:27.489 --> 01:19:28.910
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were like, oh, Supernova.

01:19:29.210 --> 01:19:33.474
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I looked to my left, and I was like, oh my god, they have Jumpin' Jackpot!

01:19:33.554 --> 01:19:36.656
[SPEAKER_04]: And I ran over, and I played Jumpin' Jackpot!

01:19:36.696 --> 01:19:42.341
[SPEAKER_07]: Last time I played Supernova was yesterday, and then before that, it was like, you know, weeks.

01:19:42.922 --> 01:19:45.043
[SPEAKER_07]: I could go... Wait, let's let Jamie have her say it.

01:19:45.064 --> 01:19:45.724
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, Jamie.

01:19:45.744 --> 01:19:52.510
[SPEAKER_11]: We saw the DDR machine, and Dan and I were like, because my husband was here with us, we're like, hey, look, it's the new, um, uh...

01:19:53.485 --> 01:19:54.005
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, shoot.

01:19:54.085 --> 01:19:54.746
[SPEAKER_11]: Airplane game.

01:19:54.986 --> 01:19:55.266
[SPEAKER_05]: Afterburner.

01:19:55.286 --> 01:19:55.806
[SPEAKER_05]: Afterburner.

01:19:55.926 --> 01:19:56.267
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:19:56.907 --> 01:20:02.590
[SPEAKER_11]: And we spent most of the time either on the Afterburner or on that ride that William and I rode.

01:20:04.331 --> 01:20:04.972
[SPEAKER_07]: Not even that.

01:20:05.012 --> 01:20:07.833
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm also getting into other arcade games like Wangan.

01:20:07.873 --> 01:20:09.714
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm playing more Initial D now.

01:20:09.794 --> 01:20:14.117
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, and I'm playing a lot more other Vermont games.

01:20:14.157 --> 01:20:18.279
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, DDR is not really as much of an aspect in my life as it would be.

01:20:18.319 --> 01:20:21.421
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, I mean, I try to go out to most of the tournaments.

01:20:21.957 --> 01:20:22.878
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

01:20:45.712 --> 01:20:46.394
[SPEAKER_07]: CustomSongs

01:20:54.258 --> 01:20:56.698
[SPEAKER_07]: for a better word just you know continue

01:21:24.566 --> 01:21:25.447
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

01:21:56.514 --> 01:21:57.855
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god.

01:21:57.955 --> 01:22:00.298
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's adapting, then I want off the boat.

01:22:00.418 --> 01:22:04.982
[SPEAKER_07]: That's basically Konami's attempt of trying to suck money out of it dry.

01:22:05.343 --> 01:22:08.126
[SPEAKER_07]: And eventually, remember, it's kind of like oil.

01:22:08.386 --> 01:22:09.507
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to last forever.

01:22:10.188 --> 01:22:14.953
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, he has to find an alternative means of just keeping the series alive.

01:22:15.868 --> 01:22:18.410
[SPEAKER_07]: by trying to please as many people as possible.

01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:27.595
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to let you go, buddy, Zaku, but thank you for bringing up Bomani, as you usually do, and, you know, kind of allowing me to share my revelations with you.

01:22:28.396 --> 01:22:30.497
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to bring up other things, but I had to get it out.

01:22:30.978 --> 01:22:31.398
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all right.

01:22:31.938 --> 01:22:32.679
[SPEAKER_04]: Next time, Zaku.

01:22:33.199 --> 01:22:33.839
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk to you next time.

01:22:33.859 --> 01:22:34.140
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.841
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do one more call, if anything comes through.

01:22:36.861 --> 01:22:38.582
[SPEAKER_04]: 877-GAME-OLR.

01:22:38.662 --> 01:22:41.284
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that will play social commentary about oil, too.

01:22:41.544 --> 01:22:42.565
[SPEAKER_04]: No more stories, really?

01:22:42.985 --> 01:22:43.686
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, you have anything?

01:22:43.706 --> 01:22:44.266
[SPEAKER_04]: Today's a boring week.

01:22:45.133 --> 01:22:45.573
[SPEAKER_15]: This is boring.

01:22:45.614 --> 01:22:48.095
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well then one more call and we'll call it a show.

01:22:48.495 --> 01:22:54.399
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you seen, read the story that came up a couple days ago about that new PSP game called, I think it's Potsapon?

01:22:54.959 --> 01:22:59.542
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like another, it's like a music game where you have all these little armies of creatures.

01:22:59.562 --> 01:23:01.103
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that related to Panel de Pon?

01:23:01.163 --> 01:23:03.024
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is, um, no, okay.

01:23:03.044 --> 01:23:03.845
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little bit different.

01:23:03.925 --> 01:23:08.768
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like, I don't know, it's a little stretched, but it looks like LocoRoco, a little bit.

01:23:09.188 --> 01:23:09.328
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

01:23:10.899 --> 01:23:15.862
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm actually looking in chat, and caller, just hold on just a minute, we'll get to you in a second, because I picked up a call and I haven't acknowledged him yet.

01:23:16.262 --> 01:23:24.226
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, let's see, I'm just looking at some interesting, because obviously a lot of our hardcore listeners have been listening to us since the days where we were like nothing but Bomani Talk.

01:23:24.586 --> 01:23:30.229
[SPEAKER_04]: GS191 says, the problem with DDR and arcades is basically that arcades are basically dead and nobody wants to do shit about it.

01:23:30.649 --> 01:23:35.531
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem with DDR console releases is that the music is way too mainstream and alienates the core audience.

01:23:36.312 --> 01:23:36.452
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

01:23:37.299 --> 01:23:41.820
[SPEAKER_04]: and Jaded says, because the concept is overdone, but the music concept is great.

01:23:43.861 --> 01:23:46.261
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of agree a little bit.

01:23:46.521 --> 01:23:59.284
[SPEAKER_04]: Although there is some type of allure to being able to play popular radio songs on there, I do think that DDR kind of opened my eyes, so to speak, to whole other genres of music that I didn't know existed before.

01:23:59.424 --> 01:23:59.924
[SPEAKER_04]: And who could forget

01:24:02.897 --> 01:24:08.341
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye, aye, aye, I'm your little butterfly Who could forget how catchy that freaking song was the first time they heard it?

01:24:08.401 --> 01:24:09.322
[SPEAKER_04]: Except for Loki.

01:24:09.482 --> 01:24:10.323
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just Mr. Negative.

01:24:10.643 --> 01:24:11.704
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Boom Boom Dollar.

01:24:11.904 --> 01:24:15.006
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, just a variety of music that was in that game.

01:24:15.367 --> 01:24:22.232
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, I think, the Dance Maniacs series in general that kind of brought us a lot of music has been lost over the past few years, which is kind of sad.

01:24:22.252 --> 01:24:30.198
[SPEAKER_15]: Because after I started playing DDR for the first year or so, I actually started going out and looking up these artists and finding what other music they had.

01:24:31.038 --> 01:24:57.656
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know finding some good stuff that I still listen to but it's kind of a it just opens your eyes a little bit well the whole though going to the Dance Mania CDs all they are now is just more rehashes of the same yeah they're not exciting but then I look at Ultramix 2 and that opened my eyes to the whole synth pop and what you know indie a different drum label stuff and there's some awesome music on there and some of the bands that were in Ultramix 2 are like my favorite bands right now it's good stuff

01:24:58.271 --> 01:25:07.637
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I just want to say real quick, Rob D in chat says, I disagree with that, I just think the DDR needs something new, releasing games with new songs just isn't going to cut it, and that's absolutely what I'm saying too.

01:25:07.938 --> 01:25:09.098
[SPEAKER_04]: That's absolutely what I'm saying.

01:25:09.399 --> 01:25:11.420
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyway, let's, I'm sorry, I've made our caller wait.

01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:12.401
[SPEAKER_04]: Caller, are you still there?

01:25:13.121 --> 01:25:13.401
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.

01:25:13.581 --> 01:25:14.382
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, who is this?

01:25:15.202 --> 01:25:15.963
[SPEAKER_06]: It's GS68.

01:25:16.203 --> 01:25:17.364
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi GS68, what's on your mind?

01:25:17.404 --> 01:25:17.984
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to make you wait.

01:25:18.264 --> 01:25:22.147
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I've read about Super Smash Bros.

01:25:22.187 --> 01:25:24.889
[SPEAKER_06]: Brawl online, and it's looking good.

01:25:26.519 --> 01:25:30.620
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, you read it, you're cutting out a little bit, you read about it online and it is looking good or it isn't?

01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:31.841
[SPEAKER_06]: It isn't.

01:25:32.001 --> 01:25:34.141
[SPEAKER_04]: I just sent you a link to show you why.

01:25:34.781 --> 01:25:35.842
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let me look at this.

01:25:36.042 --> 01:25:38.803
[SPEAKER_04]: Why, and in your mind, why is this not looking good?

01:25:38.823 --> 01:25:39.803
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this about the friend codes?

01:25:39.823 --> 01:25:46.785
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, for example, if you get disconnected and the CPU takes over, like, no one will know that you disconnected, I mean...

01:25:47.796 --> 01:25:55.163
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll keep on thinking that it's the same person, which really bugs me because now I can't tell if someone quit and just played computer and stuff.

01:25:55.183 --> 01:25:55.984
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but here's the thing, though.

01:25:56.004 --> 01:25:59.647
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if it's not really indicating that the person's disconnected or not.

01:25:59.667 --> 01:26:04.832
[SPEAKER_14]: It might say they've disconnected, but the player is being controlled by a computer now.

01:26:05.869 --> 01:26:07.110
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a very good point.

01:26:07.150 --> 01:26:19.118
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I read about that earlier this week where basically just to recap for those who may not have heard, if you get disconnected or your Wii gets shut off or your power goes off or whatever in the middle of a match, you lose connection, the computer will automatically take control of your characters.

01:26:19.138 --> 01:26:20.179
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're not having to wait.

01:26:20.219 --> 01:26:21.660
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no buffer or anything like that.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.161
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the computer takes over.

01:26:23.221 --> 01:26:33.007
[SPEAKER_04]: But I understand what GSTCA is saying is that if all the players disconnect and you're fighting the computer, how does online play differ from versus at all?

01:26:34.188 --> 01:26:34.388
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

01:26:35.316 --> 01:26:41.684
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly, and plus since no one knows that you disconnected, there's no shame in disconnecting anymore.

01:26:43.366 --> 01:26:50.314
[SPEAKER_04]: That is true, there should be a swift kick in the butt for when you disconnect, but hopefully... But it's going to reflect on their rankings, their stats.

01:26:50.715 --> 01:26:54.840
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, no, you won't see their names or anything like...

01:26:57.794 --> 01:27:00.015
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that they're going to address this stuff.

01:27:00.055 --> 01:27:03.757
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, what they've shown so far, they're just kind of going over features.

01:27:03.777 --> 01:27:07.279
[SPEAKER_14]: They haven't really delved into the details of what's going to be available on this.

01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:07.840
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:10.722
[SPEAKER_04]: Jonathan F. says, send in Mr. Resetti if they disconnect.

01:27:11.502 --> 01:27:13.403
[SPEAKER_04]: Brilliant idea.

01:27:13.463 --> 01:27:14.864
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Resetti's in there, isn't he?

01:27:15.024 --> 01:27:15.424
[SPEAKER_04]: He is.

01:27:16.485 --> 01:27:17.145
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there you go.

01:27:18.006 --> 01:27:21.348
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, the Wii Online stuff in general just kind of sucks.

01:27:21.428 --> 01:27:24.310
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it really needs an upgrade or a backbone or something.

01:27:24.690 --> 01:27:25.170
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Nintendo's

01:27:28.049 --> 01:27:28.289
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

01:27:28.509 --> 01:27:35.012
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Nintendo is trying to make it online accessible for everyone, but in doing so, they're oversimplifying online.

01:27:35.632 --> 01:27:38.794
[SPEAKER_04]: But let me tell you, okay, two stories for you.

01:27:39.174 --> 01:27:44.357
[SPEAKER_04]: A, I'm in Geometry Wars Galaxies, and Geometry Wars Galaxies has online leaderboards, which is kind of cool.

01:27:45.057 --> 01:27:47.719
[SPEAKER_04]: You register your name when you first go on, and you can go look at the leaderboards.

01:27:47.999 --> 01:27:48.619
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the thing.

01:27:48.879 --> 01:27:50.280
[SPEAKER_04]: You can look at the leaderboards for...

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:54.143
[SPEAKER_04]: The top 10 scores or where you are on the leaderboards.

01:27:54.523 --> 01:27:55.043
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

01:27:55.184 --> 01:27:58.266
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're just looking at a big list of names that mean nothing to you.

01:27:58.646 --> 01:28:02.189
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you can't filter the list by the friends on your Wii.

01:28:02.609 --> 01:28:04.691
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't filter the list by anything but those things.

01:28:04.711 --> 01:28:05.752
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of pointless.

01:28:05.812 --> 01:28:06.652
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of stupid.

01:28:07.413 --> 01:28:15.139
[SPEAKER_04]: I applaud Bizarre for trying to, you know, but I get the feeling they're just really restricted by Nintendo's lack of an online mainframe.

01:28:15.865 --> 01:28:20.990
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that whole thing with the leaderboards is the same for Ghost Squad and the new Trauma Center as well.

01:28:23.312 --> 01:28:24.693
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, yeah, I guess that's true.

01:28:24.753 --> 01:28:26.775
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot Trauma Center has the leaderboards too.

01:28:28.697 --> 01:28:30.919
[SPEAKER_06]: At least I recognized a couple names on the leaderboards.

01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:32.240
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you?

01:28:33.361 --> 01:28:36.364
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because they're from GameFAQs and I post on GameFAQs.

01:28:37.103 --> 01:28:39.865
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel sorry for you for posting on GameFAQs.

01:29:05.009 --> 01:29:08.550
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, Nintendo's fault for having a weird online system.

01:29:09.231 --> 01:29:11.432
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyhow.

01:29:11.712 --> 01:29:13.332
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

01:29:14.133 --> 01:29:15.013
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, no.

01:29:15.553 --> 01:29:15.793
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:29:16.073 --> 01:29:17.854
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you very much for calling and listening to the show.

01:29:17.874 --> 01:29:18.514
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

01:29:18.594 --> 01:29:19.115
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.

01:29:19.955 --> 01:29:20.495
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.

01:29:20.795 --> 01:29:21.135
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

01:29:22.476 --> 01:29:22.716
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:29:23.294 --> 01:29:30.059
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess that is going to be it for the calls tonight, and that's going to bring our show to a close as well, but thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening tonight.

01:29:30.499 --> 01:29:31.900
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to everybody's final thoughts.

01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:35.443
[SPEAKER_04]: Puppy, thank you for being here, and I hope you enjoyed the new studio.

01:29:35.523 --> 01:29:37.664
[SPEAKER_04]: It's much easier to breathe in here.

01:29:38.045 --> 01:29:38.505
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.

01:29:38.925 --> 01:29:43.148
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not nearly as uncomfortable as all cramming into an eight-foot space.

01:29:43.309 --> 01:29:43.629
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

01:29:43.709 --> 01:29:44.850
[SPEAKER_04]: Any final thoughts, sir?

01:29:47.151 --> 01:29:51.094
[SPEAKER_15]: I am not looking forward to the next three months of class.

01:29:51.755 --> 01:29:52.255
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to hear it.

01:29:52.919 --> 01:29:55.200
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, anyways, what's your final thought?

01:29:55.821 --> 01:29:57.361
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm buying computer parts.

01:29:59.482 --> 01:30:04.204
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is I want pie again.

01:30:04.745 --> 01:30:06.746
[SPEAKER_04]: I say that every week, but I really, really do want pie.

01:30:06.826 --> 01:30:09.027
[SPEAKER_15]: I have frozen pies in my freezer right now.

01:30:09.327 --> 01:30:10.307
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, did you bring one with you?

01:30:10.547 --> 01:30:11.068
[SPEAKER_15]: I did not.

01:30:11.268 --> 01:30:11.708
[SPEAKER_15]: Bastard.

01:30:12.428 --> 01:30:13.529
[SPEAKER_15]: I also have Smirnoffs, too.

01:30:13.729 --> 01:30:14.609
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

01:30:15.370 --> 01:30:16.270
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that you?

01:30:16.290 --> 01:30:19.452
[SPEAKER_04]: We were playing rock band last night, and you're like, yeah, I've just been having two Smirnoffs.

01:30:19.492 --> 01:30:20.052
[SPEAKER_04]: This should be fun.

01:30:20.392 --> 01:30:21.213
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:30:21.713 --> 01:30:22.113
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fun.

01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:23.201
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:30:50.413 --> 01:30:51.133
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's it.

01:30:51.213 --> 01:30:53.214
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to call it a show.

01:30:53.414 --> 01:30:56.455
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much for downloading us and supporting independent podcasting.

01:30:56.495 --> 01:30:57.476

01:30:57.516 --> 01:31:01.297
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like what you hear, please tell two friends about the program or two enemies.

01:31:01.357 --> 01:31:05.519
[SPEAKER_04]: We really don't care who it is just as long as the word gets out there because then we can slowly take over the world.

01:31:06.079 --> 01:31:07.200
[SPEAKER_04]: We will see you next week.

01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:10.661
[SPEAKER_04]: Same bat time, same bat channel.

01:31:13.362 --> 01:31:14.422
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we know kind of anything?

01:31:15.003 --> 01:31:17.204
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully we're going to do a game next week or something.

01:31:17.644 --> 01:31:17.904
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of

01:31:18.769 --> 01:31:20.090
