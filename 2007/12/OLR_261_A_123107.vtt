WEBVTT

00:14.641 --> 00:25.872
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, December 30th, 2007, on this special edition of Orange Lounge Radio, we take a look back at the headlines and games of 2007 with our favorite people, all of our listeners.

00:32.008 --> 00:33.429
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers Hi I have a sinus infection

01:00.948 --> 01:01.728
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to hear it.

01:02.589 --> 01:04.929
[SPEAKER_06]: You were sick quite a bit this year, I'm sorry to hear.

01:04.949 --> 01:07.990
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't like sick, sick not like when I had the plague.

01:08.431 --> 01:08.591
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

01:08.631 --> 01:10.731
[SPEAKER_01]: However, this is exactly how the plague started.

01:11.232 --> 01:11.612
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no.

01:12.152 --> 01:15.333
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hopped right on it and I have drugs that make me happy.

01:15.773 --> 01:16.633
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I hope you feel better.

01:16.693 --> 01:17.374
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your week off?

01:18.434 --> 01:21.355
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, I did absolutely nothing.

01:22.355 --> 01:22.615
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.

01:22.635 --> 01:27.017
[SPEAKER_01]: I sat on my ass and did absolutely nothing and it was beautiful.

01:27.437 --> 01:28.137
[SPEAKER_06]: Was Santa good to you?

01:28.877 --> 01:29.918
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa was decent.

01:30.158 --> 01:30.378
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

01:30.976 --> 01:38.080
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa brought me... Actually, Santa Dan gave me a game that I sort of blinked and went WTF over, but I think I'm going to play it.

01:39.040 --> 01:39.340
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

01:39.380 --> 01:39.881
[SPEAKER_06]: You care to share?

01:40.041 --> 01:41.301
[SPEAKER_01]: That was... What's it?

01:41.341 --> 01:42.142
[SPEAKER_01]: Flash Focus.

01:42.742 --> 01:43.783
[SPEAKER_06]: The vision training game.

01:43.823 --> 01:44.083
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

01:44.363 --> 01:48.365
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to play it because clearly I need my vision trained.

01:49.946 --> 01:50.986
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I hope it works for you.

01:51.387 --> 01:57.970
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started... And we... I gave him a... What did I give him?

01:59.111 --> 01:59.911
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave him Blade Runner.

02:02.155 --> 02:07.838
[SPEAKER_06]: and I bought him Ratatouille on Blu-ray for use on the Playstation 3 because it's your Blu-ray player too, right?

02:08.538 --> 02:17.222
[SPEAKER_06]: very cool it's pretty we'll hear more about your game of the week in just a minute that's not a game well, I know, but we'll get the other games as well, right?

02:17.962 --> 02:26.106
[SPEAKER_06]: well, I gotta introduce he's sitting there waiting for me to say the one and only Techmaster Loki I'm not really waiting for you, but that's fine how you doing tonight, Loki?

02:26.266 --> 02:29.027
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing fine and how was your Christmas?

02:29.047 --> 02:29.687
[SPEAKER_06]: Was Santa good to you?

02:30.528 --> 02:31.208
[SPEAKER_02]: I was good to me

02:31.869 --> 02:34.692
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I built a new computer.

02:34.832 --> 02:37.074
[SPEAKER_06]: Oftentimes we buy ourselves the best gifts, right?

02:37.374 --> 02:37.815
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

02:38.556 --> 02:44.421
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I buy everything for myself, I don't normally get anything for everyone else because they figure I've already bought it.

02:45.142 --> 02:46.163
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is usually the case.

02:47.264 --> 02:49.746
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I don't know.

02:50.127 --> 02:50.347
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:51.246 --> 02:51.666
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw

03:16.278 --> 03:22.201
[SPEAKER_06]: wants to know if Loki has heard that Black Wolf bought the Eye of Judgment.

03:22.401 --> 03:23.041
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for him.

03:23.121 --> 03:27.023
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one more towards one million, which will never, ever, ever happen.

03:28.643 --> 03:28.904
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever.

03:29.164 --> 03:34.906
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember, just to reiterate from two weeks ago, it has to sell a million copies.

03:36.272 --> 03:36.813
[SPEAKER_02]: Some day.

03:59.847 --> 04:01.487
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Bobby's doing his own year-end show tonight.

04:01.507 --> 04:02.308
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably still going.

04:02.328 --> 04:03.708
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably where some of our listeners are.

04:03.748 --> 04:04.048
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

04:04.608 --> 04:08.369
[SPEAKER_06]: But meanwhile, we actually are going to continue on doing the things we usually do.

04:08.429 --> 04:10.909
[SPEAKER_06]: We weren't here last week because of the holidays.

04:10.990 --> 04:16.611
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, Merry Christmas, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, Solstice, Ramadan, whatever the hell it is you celebrate.

04:16.671 --> 04:17.191
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it was good.

04:17.231 --> 04:18.931
[SPEAKER_06]: Or nothing at all, if you're atheist, right?

04:19.651 --> 04:20.792
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it was good, whatever you did.

04:20.812 --> 04:22.172
[SPEAKER_01]: Ramadan's not until, like, later in the year.

04:22.832 --> 04:23.892
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what am I mixing it up with?

04:24.633 --> 04:24.893
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well.

04:25.713 --> 04:26.013
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

04:26.093 --> 04:26.393
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?

04:27.396 --> 04:28.076
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody cares.

04:28.376 --> 04:29.196
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's Festivus.

04:29.817 --> 04:31.057
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they're so similar.

04:31.357 --> 04:33.558
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just trying to be PC and not leave anybody out.

04:33.998 --> 04:34.658
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you have it.

04:34.678 --> 04:36.218
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever it is you celebrate, I hope it was good.

04:37.058 --> 04:39.519
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about our gaming weeks, because we do talk about that.

04:39.799 --> 04:41.539
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I should say our gaming two weeks.

04:41.900 --> 04:43.260
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming two weeks?

04:44.380 --> 04:47.281
[SPEAKER_01]: I got Orange Box, so I played some Portal.

04:47.901 --> 04:52.582
[SPEAKER_01]: I've decided that I really like Half-Life 2 Episode 2, which Dan beat last night.

04:55.083 --> 04:56.223
[SPEAKER_01]: I played a lot of pinball.

04:57.583 --> 04:59.084
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

05:28.174 --> 05:29.294
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I have on my DS.

05:29.854 --> 05:30.295
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

05:30.535 --> 05:34.616
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've really just been more, you know, doing more Portal.

05:35.776 --> 05:36.176
[SPEAKER_06]: Portal's fun.

05:36.196 --> 05:38.337
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't play very much of it because I get sick.

05:38.517 --> 05:41.077
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and, and, and, Dan got me Rock Band.

05:42.017 --> 05:42.117
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh!

05:42.137 --> 05:44.098
[SPEAKER_01]: I said I was going to get it, and I did.

05:44.358 --> 05:44.798
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

05:44.818 --> 05:46.058
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guitar broke the first day.

05:46.759 --> 05:47.099
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't.

05:47.859 --> 05:50.660
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been using the Guitar Hero guitars because we have two.

05:50.860 --> 05:51.180
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.

05:51.560 --> 05:56.021
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we actually have a whole bunch of them because Dan's friend, Will, his stuff lives at our house sometimes.

05:56.301 --> 05:56.541
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha.

05:56.561 --> 05:56.681
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha.

05:57.080 --> 06:00.783
[SPEAKER_01]: and Dan got my Iron Lung just for me and I can't say that I like it.

06:00.803 --> 06:01.643
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to buy that.

06:03.024 --> 06:05.686
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't in the same room listening to it but it sounded like a cover.

06:06.507 --> 06:07.287
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's not the original?

06:07.307 --> 06:10.329
[SPEAKER_01]: But the music is all dead on.

06:10.429 --> 06:18.175
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the covers just are like... Well, maybe they didn't want to get sued like the Guitar Heroes 80s people did.

06:18.275 --> 06:20.797
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sing Creep and I sing it the right way.

06:20.937 --> 06:21.137
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you?

06:21.157 --> 06:21.237
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

06:21.826 --> 06:22.466
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a case for Rock Band

06:50.712 --> 06:54.893
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Knight in chat says, I would love to hear Jamie singing.

06:54.973 --> 06:57.634
[SPEAKER_06]: Any possibilities of YouTubes in the future?

07:20.152 --> 07:21.472
[SPEAKER_06]: Not on YouTube.

07:21.713 --> 07:25.434
[SPEAKER_01]: If my throat doesn't kill me and I'm drunk enough, maybe.

07:26.654 --> 07:27.254
[SPEAKER_01]: There is hope, kids.

07:27.294 --> 07:32.096
[SPEAKER_01]: My whole problem is that every year I get a sinus infection without fail.

07:32.336 --> 07:33.156
[SPEAKER_01]: This we all know.

07:33.856 --> 07:35.757
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always am sick on New Year's Eve.

07:36.037 --> 07:43.759
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you, man, we need to get that video from Eddie that has a rice princess doing sabotage.

07:44.780 --> 07:46.700
[SPEAKER_02]: Way better than me doing even Timmy.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.961
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hilarious.

07:50.012 --> 07:56.234
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at any rate, I always get very, very drunk while I'm very, very sick, which is pretty stupid.

07:56.915 --> 08:02.277
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they make me sing Karaoke Revolution, and last year I tried to sing Snake Eater, and I had no voice.

08:04.978 --> 08:05.798
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no voice.

08:07.118 --> 08:08.439
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, Snake Eater!

08:09.759 --> 08:10.700
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it sounded like.

08:12.173 --> 08:16.679
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft is in chat, and Actdeft is saying that we should go out on tour.

08:17.099 --> 08:21.565
[SPEAKER_06]: He says the OLR World Tour, the Sensible World of Podcasting Tour, a.k.a.

08:21.605 --> 08:25.530
[SPEAKER_06]: the Fag Your Anger Tour, which is an inside joke from 2007, of course.

08:25.910 --> 08:28.153
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that, the Sensible World of Podcasting Tour.

08:28.173 --> 08:28.674
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good name.

08:29.195 --> 08:29.855
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very cool.

08:29.875 --> 08:30.256
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very good.

08:30.296 --> 08:31.436
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's move on to Loki.

08:31.456 --> 08:32.457
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your gaming week, Loki?

08:33.138 --> 08:38.681
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this week, or actually last week and the week before last, I took some time off to play games.

08:39.842 --> 08:41.003
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see.

08:41.563 --> 08:50.028
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't play as much as I thought I would because I ended up playing mostly Saints Bro because I'm trying to finish it months after it's come out.

08:50.108 --> 08:51.369
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, trying to finish it.

08:51.889 --> 08:52.450
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually...

08:53.516 --> 08:54.557
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

09:11.033 --> 09:13.333
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

09:40.313 --> 09:40.893
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just weird.

09:41.574 --> 09:46.897
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think if I replace the... They have the X-clamp on there that you can replace the heatsink.

09:47.678 --> 09:48.358
[SPEAKER_02]: It should fix it.

09:48.398 --> 09:53.841
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I hear something underneath the board that sounds like... I don't know, like a ball bearing rolling around.

09:53.861 --> 09:59.345
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's actually some of the solder stripped off the board and actually kind of clumped up into a little ball.

09:59.785 --> 10:02.207
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm guessing that some of the solder is probably...

10:03.903 --> 10:05.123
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

10:25.373 --> 10:29.436
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I played a little bit of Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings.

10:29.817 --> 10:30.818
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

10:31.138 --> 10:31.578
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

10:31.718 --> 10:32.739
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little different.

10:33.080 --> 10:37.383
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the combat system is kind of similar to Final Fantasy XII a little bit.

10:37.964 --> 10:47.852
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess because I didn't play XII, the impact of these characters and when they're like, oh, this person came, it's like, okay, who are you?

10:47.992 --> 10:48.953
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who you are.

10:50.728 --> 10:55.071
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's okay for me, but probably I should have played 12 before I played the DS game.

10:55.091 --> 11:00.275
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, that's their damn fault for releasing one game on the DS and one on the PS2.

11:01.556 --> 11:02.817
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, what else did I play?

11:03.417 --> 11:07.240
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually played quite a bit of No More Heroes.

11:07.421 --> 11:08.722
[SPEAKER_02]: That game is fucking awesome.

11:09.382 --> 11:10.383
[SPEAKER_02]: It seriously is awesome.

11:10.723 --> 11:16.267
[SPEAKER_02]: After reading a fact on GameFAQs that was actually in English, I kind of figured out how to actually play the game.

11:17.568 --> 11:17.989
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool.

11:18.049 --> 11:19.730
[SPEAKER_02]: I finished the first boss and

11:20.245 --> 11:20.746
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11:41.242 --> 11:49.026
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now I've run into the problem where I need a good program to read temperatures because every single program they have reads it differently and I want to know which one's correct.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.287
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't fry something.

11:51.527 --> 11:54.328
[SPEAKER_02]: But my chip's overclocked from 2.6 GHz to 3.3 right now.

11:54.368 --> 11:55.469
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Crysis runs about 35-40 frames per second.

12:03.584 --> 12:29.758
[SPEAKER_02]: but I want it to run faster and I'm also getting another graphics card because I replaced my old GTS or my 8800 GTS with the new one that's faster the GTS 512 and then I'm getting a second one, the SLIM so hopefully Crysis will run I'm shooting for 50 frames per second or 60 I doubt that's going to happen but smoother the better

12:31.061 --> 12:32.843
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, quite a lengthy gaming week, Loki.

12:32.863 --> 12:33.884
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeez, you're busy.

12:35.125 --> 12:36.527
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine kind of pales by comparison.

12:36.847 --> 12:43.094
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, since the family of mine doesn't do a whole lot for the holidays, William and I decided to take a last-minute getaway to Reno.

12:43.895 --> 12:48.657
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, Reno, not to offend any of our listeners who might live in Reno, but it's kind of a poor man's Vegas.

12:49.117 --> 12:54.458
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's not a whole lot to do in Reno except, you know, go to the big three casinos.

12:54.478 --> 13:00.180
[SPEAKER_06]: But we did go to one of the casinos there, Harrah's, and just randomly we found ourselves in the arcade.

13:00.220 --> 13:08.403
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll tell you what, the Harrah's arcade was actually kind of cool because there was a lot of classic shit in there that we got to kind of take some time to look at, including...

13:09.643 --> 13:10.244
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR4thMix Solo Machine

13:28.486 --> 13:31.388
[SPEAKER_06]: and I haven't seen one of those in years.

13:31.849 --> 13:34.871
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, William's like, you gotta get up and dance, you gotta dance.

13:34.891 --> 13:36.232
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I haven't played DDR forever.

13:36.272 --> 13:37.413
[SPEAKER_02]: Harrah's Tahoe, you said?

13:37.793 --> 13:39.674
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's Harrah's Reno, not Tahoe.

13:39.694 --> 13:39.974
[SPEAKER_02]: Harrah's Reno.

13:40.114 --> 13:40.315
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

13:40.835 --> 13:43.397
[SPEAKER_02]: I played on that DDR 4th Plus machine.

13:43.677 --> 13:43.857
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

13:43.897 --> 13:44.738
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the solo one.

13:44.838 --> 13:45.979
[SPEAKER_02]: I do remember that now, but...

13:46.846 --> 13:47.346
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's funny.

13:47.766 --> 13:48.386
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's weird?

13:49.406 --> 13:53.387
[SPEAKER_06]: The casino is very odd because the arcade is way back there.

13:53.427 --> 13:58.028
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like Circus Circus, which has a new pump-it-up machine right in the middle of everything.

13:58.348 --> 14:03.329
[SPEAKER_06]: But at Harrah's, you have to go all the way back, and it's back in a dark corner.

14:03.349 --> 14:03.729
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of sad.

14:03.749 --> 14:09.590
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing the pump-it-up machine is probably right in the front of their arcade where the third Korean machine used to be for a while.

14:10.410 --> 14:16.211
[SPEAKER_06]: And now GS68 is telling me that at the El Dorado, they have a fourth-plus solo machine, which I completely missed somehow.

14:16.963 --> 14:17.363
[SPEAKER_06]: That's alright.

14:17.383 --> 14:18.044
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I was doing?

14:18.104 --> 14:20.046
[SPEAKER_06]: I was gambling and losing a lot of money.

14:20.226 --> 14:21.967
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay.

14:22.087 --> 14:23.008
[SPEAKER_06]: I won jackpots.

14:23.188 --> 14:24.289
[SPEAKER_06]: I won a silver jackpot.

14:24.309 --> 14:24.449
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

14:24.689 --> 14:26.450
[SPEAKER_06]: Except it was on a penny machine, so I only won $35.

14:26.490 --> 14:27.171
[SPEAKER_06]: That's alright.

14:27.211 --> 14:30.093
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to remember that Solo sucks anyways.

14:32.375 --> 14:33.176
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a dated joke.

14:33.256 --> 14:35.838
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, a DDRUSA mix machine.

14:36.398 --> 14:36.678
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

14:36.858 --> 14:37.559
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, rad.

14:37.979 --> 14:38.580
[SPEAKER_02]: That takes me back.

14:38.840 --> 14:39.741
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, that takes me back.

14:40.321 --> 14:40.741
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

14:40.802 --> 14:41.342
[SPEAKER_02]: I love DDRUSA.

14:42.248 --> 14:43.569
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, but here's the sad thing.

14:43.609 --> 14:44.670
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to play on trick.

14:45.050 --> 14:47.051
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, remember when I used to be really good at DDR?

14:47.211 --> 14:49.553
[SPEAKER_06]: And you were good at DDR, and you were good at DDR.

14:50.174 --> 14:51.614
[SPEAKER_06]: You used to play doubles, Jamie.

14:52.655 --> 14:55.937
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to play doubles on like five feet.

14:56.518 --> 15:02.462
[SPEAKER_02]: I still play doubles and hope that death comes to me, but... Those were the days.

15:03.231 --> 15:28.714
[SPEAKER_06]: and then actually it's funny because some of my actually those of you guys that know Extifer Extifer's sister got married over the weekend and she married somebody who used to work at Konami's QA department with Shane so I saw a lot of people from my DDR days because he obviously invited all his old co-workers I saw some people from the old DDR days I hadn't seen him forever so it was really cool kind of a little bit of reunion so it was nice anyhow

15:29.232 --> 15:31.493
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on, that has nothing to do with Game of the Week, that's just reminiscing.

15:32.133 --> 15:34.574
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as other games, I played some World of Warcraft, of course.

15:35.994 --> 15:50.519
[SPEAKER_06]: I now have, like, I think three PvP purples and some crafted rare epic stuff, so I'm definitely starting to exhaust everything there is to do at level 70, but I still have lots of instances to run and alts to level.

15:51.119 --> 15:52.780
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, I'll tell you what I've been playing.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.321
[SPEAKER_06]: Santa brought me a copy of Super Mario Galaxy on the Wii.

15:57.572 --> 16:06.217
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I'd played before on our preview show, but it was nice to have some more time to play it without kind of that pressure of, you know, everything we're doing is being broadcast on the internet, right?

16:06.257 --> 16:08.178
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just kind of had time to take it slow, take it easy.

16:08.879 --> 16:09.699
[SPEAKER_06]: I fucking love it.

16:09.939 --> 16:11.360
[SPEAKER_06]: It's... You know what?

16:11.720 --> 16:13.981
[SPEAKER_06]: Like... And you know, I've said this on the show before.

16:14.021 --> 16:15.282
[SPEAKER_06]: Folks have been listening for a while.

16:15.602 --> 16:17.864
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought Mario 64 was a little bit overrated.

16:18.404 --> 16:22.286
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not think Mario 64 was the best Mario game of all time or any of that stuff.

16:22.746 --> 16:24.047
[SPEAKER_06]: I just didn't see it.

16:24.087 --> 16:25.488
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's a good game, yes.

16:25.608 --> 16:27.089
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, it's a great game, but it wasn't...

16:27.629 --> 16:30.692
[SPEAKER_06]: There was something about it I didn't quite like as much.

16:30.972 --> 16:33.934
[SPEAKER_06]: But Mario Galaxy, it really is all that.

16:34.014 --> 16:39.759
[SPEAKER_06]: I love some of the puzzles in it, like that gravity puzzle where you're inside the tube and the gravity's changing in a different way.

16:40.139 --> 16:41.340
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool.

16:41.961 --> 16:42.321
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.

16:44.082 --> 16:49.907
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely recommend if you're a Wii owner, you have to get Galaxy because this is the type of game that the Wii was really made for.

16:50.808 --> 16:52.449
[SPEAKER_06]: I've definitely been spending a lot of time on that.

16:52.589 --> 16:53.930
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you, Santa, for bringing me that.

16:55.031 --> 16:56.973
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty much going to do it for my Gaming Week.

16:57.665 --> 16:59.246
[SPEAKER_06]: How about you guys on the chat room?

16:59.266 --> 17:00.467
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your guys' gaming week?

17:01.147 --> 17:03.769
[SPEAKER_06]: I see a lot of people were naming Beatmania 2DX Distorted.

17:05.890 --> 17:09.032
[SPEAKER_06]: Rock Band was played by Color of Sakura.

17:09.913 --> 17:11.454
[SPEAKER_06]: Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass.

17:13.775 --> 17:16.537
[SPEAKER_06]: Xene was playing Persona 3.

17:16.637 --> 17:20.540
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of those games that came out this year that I totally missed.

17:20.680 --> 17:21.680
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what did you think?

17:22.341 --> 17:23.141
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy.

17:23.762 --> 17:25.383
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fucking easy game.

17:25.863 --> 17:26.343
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.

17:26.744 --> 17:27.144
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't

17:27.554 --> 17:32.861
[SPEAKER_02]: The last boss is kind of, I guess, a little bit more difficult than the rest of them, but it was really easy.

17:33.502 --> 17:37.347
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, I'm not that great at games, but come on.

17:37.407 --> 17:39.289
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously, it wasn't a challenge at all.

17:41.791 --> 17:46.375
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping and then we'll get into some of tonight's news and I'll tell you how the rest of the show is going to work too.

17:47.296 --> 17:49.158
[SPEAKER_06]: Our show is going to be a little bit different tonight.

17:49.858 --> 17:52.861
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to actually open up the Skype line a little early tonight.

17:53.562 --> 18:01.809
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, now that I'm noticing that a lot of our regulars aren't here, I'm hoping that we're going to get some calls on Skype line because we really want you guys to participate.

18:01.849 --> 18:04.011
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you guys don't call, we'll figure something else out.

18:04.311 --> 18:05.232
[SPEAKER_06]: But basically what we're going to do...

18:05.752 --> 18:06.413
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

18:29.847 --> 18:30.227
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakuraLoki

18:48.683 --> 18:49.123
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

19:12.677 --> 19:13.498
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamey has one or two stories

19:30.197 --> 19:39.722
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, anyways, this week, some stuff that's probably not a big surprise happened, including Sony of America Trademarked Resistance 2.

19:40.102 --> 19:40.963
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, really?

19:41.023 --> 19:43.284
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to make a sequel to a game that sold a lot for them?

19:43.864 --> 19:45.925
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, that is such a shocker.

19:46.085 --> 19:47.386
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so surprised.

19:47.586 --> 19:49.347
[SPEAKER_02]: So surprised.

19:50.848 --> 19:53.489
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, Kira Yamaoka, one of our...

19:54.079 --> 19:54.820
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

20:19.153 --> 20:23.634
[SPEAKER_02]: He was quoted actually saying that the U.S.

20:23.674 --> 20:27.395
[SPEAKER_02]: team's graphical and technical ability is amazing.

20:27.495 --> 20:32.376
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a huge gap, actually, and he's talking about between the U.S.

20:32.456 --> 20:37.417
[SPEAKER_02]: teams and Japanese development houses with the way games are going right now.

20:39.417 --> 20:39.717
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

20:39.737 --> 20:42.158
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that makes kind of sense, especially with, you know,

20:43.277 --> 20:48.343
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the companies being in the U.S., you know, Nintendo, I mean, they're both in Japan and the U.S.

20:48.383 --> 20:52.848
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff, but I don't know, a lot of the third-party companies are in the U.S., so I guess that makes sense.

20:53.469 --> 20:55.571
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to say the Japanese can't program good games.

20:56.110 --> 21:15.354
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to go off on a tangent real fast, because this discussion was actually, I was talking to one of my friends in the car, we were up very late last night because we drove to Rocky Horror in San Francisco, and it was William, myself, and our mutual friend Jake, and Jake's a big gaming nerd like us, and we were talking about kind of Japanese versus American, I think actually I was talking about this very thing right here, because somehow we were talking about Silent Hill.

21:16.074 --> 21:21.618
[SPEAKER_06]: And it kind of occurred to me, you know, Nintendo's a very Japanese company, whereas Microsoft's a very American company.

21:22.118 --> 21:25.280
[SPEAKER_06]: And Microsoft seems to be kind of winning this.

21:25.420 --> 21:31.104
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, I guess I shouldn't say that because the Wii is obviously dominating, but the Xbox is kind of dominating in their own way.

21:31.124 --> 21:36.087
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's kind of like, you know, the Xbox kind of caters to what's really big in the American market right now.

21:36.107 --> 21:37.348
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's Internet gaming.

21:37.848 --> 21:42.770
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's something that, for whatever reason, Nintendo has never seemed to capture.

21:43.090 --> 21:45.991
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, Nintendo is not getting on board with internet gaming.

21:46.271 --> 21:49.732
[SPEAKER_06]: They did one game on the GameCube that was a third-party game to begin with, right?

21:49.772 --> 21:51.493
[SPEAKER_06]: And they really haven't done much on the Wii yet.

21:51.773 --> 21:56.034
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, granted, we have Mario Kart, but we've all seen they can't... The friend codes thing sucks and all that.

21:56.054 --> 22:02.316
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were kind of wondering, like, why is it that Nintendo does not get online gaming?

22:02.356 --> 22:05.517
[SPEAKER_06]: And it kind of struck me, it's probably a cultural difference.

22:05.657 --> 22:06.938
[SPEAKER_06]: And what it probably is...

22:08.200 --> 22:20.789
[SPEAKER_06]: is that arcades are dead here in America, and that's why we're so big on internet gaming, whereas in Japan, it seems like arcades are still, I mean, maybe not what they once were, but they're still very prevalent, and people still meet up to do the gaming.

22:21.189 --> 22:21.649
[SPEAKER_02]: So what?

22:21.929 --> 22:30.275
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand that, because they recognize, though, that the US and Europe and stuff are big gaming markets, and maybe even bigger than Japan, and...

22:31.102 --> 22:31.703
[SPEAKER_02]: They recognize it.

22:31.743 --> 22:33.924
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're getting so many we's here in the U.S.

22:34.144 --> 22:35.886
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like they don't understand that.

22:35.906 --> 22:37.447
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just they're just not doing it.

22:37.627 --> 22:44.131
[SPEAKER_06]: But kind of like why I'm relating it to this story is that when that's their culture, that's their perspective on things.

22:44.592 --> 22:55.339
[SPEAKER_06]: And so maybe I think part of the reason why like a cure of Yamaoka might be kind of really liking what the Americans are doing now is that because it's a different approach based on the way things work here.

22:55.859 --> 22:59.402
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what it is, and this is pretty much – I mean –

23:00.179 --> 23:00.900
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

23:22.677 --> 23:24.898
[SPEAKER_02]: and then, of course, it took off here.

23:25.138 --> 23:29.640
[SPEAKER_02]: Problem is, though, Nintendo didn't plan for any sort of online infrastructure.

23:29.680 --> 23:30.821
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't think it was a big deal.

23:31.281 --> 23:34.662
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, whatever, our systems sell very well by themselves.

23:34.762 --> 23:35.803
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the portable systems.

23:36.043 --> 23:38.084
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll link it up with the DS and that kind of stuff.

23:38.564 --> 23:39.985
[SPEAKER_02]: And they didn't really do anything with it.

23:40.305 --> 23:42.446
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, come to find out, guess what?

23:42.566 --> 23:44.206
[SPEAKER_02]: Online gaming is really popular.

23:44.647 --> 23:46.988
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're like, crap, what do we do now?

23:47.028 --> 23:49.709
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have any sort of infrastructure built for this stuff.

23:50.535 --> 23:52.056
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now they're way behind with all that.

23:52.096 --> 23:53.357
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with the PlayStation Network.

23:53.417 --> 23:56.198
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they didn't really have a unified online service or anything like that.

23:56.218 --> 23:59.641
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Sony's issue is that they are stretching themselves thin.

24:00.141 --> 24:04.624
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you notice when games keep getting delayed, like LittleBigPlanet Home keeps getting delayed.

24:04.944 --> 24:08.926
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that to me says that Sony, their thing is that they've been trying to do both.

24:09.607 --> 24:18.532
[SPEAKER_06]: To Sony's credit, I think everything they've been doing, they are the ones that have truly been trying to appeal to a worldwide audience the whole time.

24:19.235 --> 24:20.436
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're stretching themselves too thin.

24:20.456 --> 24:20.976
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't do it.

24:21.036 --> 24:22.236
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have the resources to do it.

24:22.756 --> 24:31.260
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas Nintendo has focused their efforts on this, and Xbox, for the most part, has focused their efforts on this, and both have excelled very well, while Sony's spread themselves too thin.

24:31.580 --> 24:34.621
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and the other thing, too, Microsoft now is starting to figure out, hey, guess what?

24:34.641 --> 24:46.566
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to think about our Japanese market as well, and that's why they're publishing games like Lost Odyssey, Blue Dragon, stuff like that, to appeal to a more variety of consumer audiences.

24:47.694 --> 24:48.274
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

25:13.943 --> 25:21.047
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though they're trying to break out of that mold and stuff, unfortunately, a lot of the games that they're still releasing, even look at first-party stuff.

25:21.067 --> 25:21.787
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what?

25:21.847 --> 25:23.848
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got Metroid Prime 3.

25:23.908 --> 25:25.069
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that would be the only game.

25:25.149 --> 25:30.552
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe Excite Truck that's first-party that would kind of appeal to more than just kids.

25:31.833 --> 25:36.335
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these games like Disaster Day of Crisis and Project Hammer, which is canceled.

25:36.755 --> 25:42.218
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, those games could have appealed to some older consumers, but they didn't do it.

25:42.859 --> 25:43.519
[SPEAKER_02]: Manhunt 2 Manhunt 2 Manhunt 2

26:05.492 --> 26:07.174
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

26:19.346 --> 26:19.546
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

26:19.566 --> 26:22.828
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was going to turn to the chat room for some comments on this.

26:23.428 --> 26:27.070
[SPEAKER_06]: Some polarizing statements made by us on Viva Pinata.

26:27.111 --> 26:29.492
[SPEAKER_06]: Flaming Bozo says, Viva did not suck.

26:29.732 --> 26:31.093
[SPEAKER_06]: And Poeater says, Viva did suck.

26:31.573 --> 26:33.414
[SPEAKER_06]: So some polarizing opinions there.

26:33.934 --> 26:34.195
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

26:34.475 --> 26:35.335
[SPEAKER_01]: What did they try to do with Viva?

26:35.355 --> 26:36.336
[SPEAKER_01]: It went from suck to blow.

26:36.756 --> 26:37.937
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put it this way.

26:38.057 --> 26:41.941
[SPEAKER_02]: Their expectations of Viva Pinata versus what actually happened were a little different.

26:41.961 --> 26:43.442
[SPEAKER_02]: They thought it was going to be the next Pokemon.

26:43.482 --> 26:44.243
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I agree.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.885
[SPEAKER_06]: They set their bar way too high on Viva Pinata.

26:47.666 --> 26:51.229
[SPEAKER_06]: I certainly would never put Viva Pinata on a bad games of the year list.

26:51.289 --> 26:53.792
[SPEAKER_02]: It just wasn't Pokemon.

26:53.832 --> 26:54.692
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a bad game.

26:54.913 --> 26:56.394
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a game I'm not going to play.

26:56.534 --> 26:59.056
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are kids, I'm sure, that love the game.

26:59.377 --> 27:00.998
[SPEAKER_02]: There are probably adults that love the game.

27:01.138 --> 27:01.879
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not for me.

27:02.219 --> 27:05.881
[SPEAKER_02]: Viva Pinata Party Animals, that's crap.

27:05.901 --> 27:10.343
[SPEAKER_06]: I think even like Major Nelson has said Viva Pinata Party Animals sucks.

27:10.383 --> 27:11.023
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put it this way.

27:11.043 --> 27:14.525
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's pretty bad when the people inside Microsoft don't like the game.

27:14.565 --> 27:17.346
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole thing was they tried to like... I don't know that to be sure.

27:17.386 --> 27:17.847
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't quote me on that.

27:17.867 --> 27:20.928
[SPEAKER_02]: They tried to look at what Pokemon has and kind of emulate that.

27:20.988 --> 27:22.729
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're like, okay, it has a cartoon series.

27:22.789 --> 27:23.009
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

27:23.229 --> 27:24.310
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do a cartoon series.

27:24.570 --> 27:25.230
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had a game.

27:25.510 --> 27:26.090
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let's do this.

27:26.371 --> 27:29.992
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if we put this out here exactly like Pokemon, it's going to have the appeal of Pokemon.

27:30.112 --> 27:30.793
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it did not.

27:31.053 --> 27:31.353
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact...

27:31.733 --> 27:35.715
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that adding the cartoon as well is kind of just shoving it down our throats even more.

27:36.215 --> 27:37.096
[SPEAKER_02]: Just leave it as a game.

27:37.136 --> 27:39.817
[SPEAKER_02]: If the game was popular enough to warrant a cartoon, great.

27:39.877 --> 27:40.237
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that.

27:40.738 --> 27:41.818
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Pooh Eater's idea.

27:41.918 --> 27:43.119
[SPEAKER_06]: Viva Manhunt Pinata.

27:43.959 --> 27:44.400
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

27:45.040 --> 27:45.340
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

27:45.360 --> 27:50.663
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not mean to derail the show with that little tangent, but when hasn't that happened before?

27:50.943 --> 27:51.863
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

27:52.144 --> 27:56.586
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week, SNK will be producing yet another new game.

27:56.686 --> 27:56.946
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait.

27:57.006 --> 27:57.486
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm sorry.

27:57.506 --> 27:57.826
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not.

27:57.846 --> 28:00.708
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be putting out Metal Slug 3 on Xbox Live Arcade.

28:03.089 --> 28:07.130
[SPEAKER_06]: And the sound of Jamie cheering, by the way, is the only person you'll hear cheering about.

28:07.431 --> 28:07.851
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

28:08.031 --> 28:08.531
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks cool.

28:08.551 --> 28:09.311
[SPEAKER_02]: Metal Slug has a cult fanbase.

28:09.331 --> 28:11.552
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to have updated HD visuals.

28:11.792 --> 28:12.192
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

28:12.272 --> 28:18.315
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever that's supposed to mean, because all the screenshots don't look updated to me, but... Okay, I'll take the word for it.

28:18.395 --> 28:18.715
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.

28:18.935 --> 28:23.496
[SPEAKER_06]: Does HD visuals mean that they've added bars on the side that are pressed?

28:23.516 --> 28:23.917
[SPEAKER_01]: That's dumb.

28:23.937 --> 28:26.077
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna do like they did with Double Dragon.

28:26.437 --> 28:26.998
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Double Dragon.

28:27.018 --> 28:27.738
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Double Dragon.

28:28.542 --> 28:29.122
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

28:29.142 --> 28:29.722
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks okay.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.023
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, hey, you know what?

28:31.483 --> 28:34.404
[SPEAKER_02]: If SNK's listening, if you want to remake the game, great.

28:34.724 --> 28:44.646
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, like, reissue it, but, like, redo all the visuals, kind of like, I don't know, Super Street Fighter 2 HD, whatever, you know, that's going to be coming out.

28:44.666 --> 28:46.247
[SPEAKER_06]: Redo all the graphics, that'd be awesome.

28:46.307 --> 28:49.308
[SPEAKER_06]: Metal Slug might actually be a really fun live game.

28:49.528 --> 28:49.788
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

28:49.808 --> 28:51.188
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, to play with people on live.

28:51.248 --> 28:54.129
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is going to have co-op over live, so that's kind of cool.

28:54.149 --> 28:54.269
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

28:54.980 --> 29:03.322
[SPEAKER_02]: and, um, so yeah, it's 800 Microsoft points, should be out Wednesday, no word on if there's going to be another game coming out as well, because it's only one game announced so far.

29:03.462 --> 29:11.605
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and to Metal Slug's credit, although Loki and I give it a hard time on this show for kind of being the same thing over and over, it really is a lot of fun, I think this will be a good title for us.

29:11.625 --> 29:12.525
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like the, you know,

29:13.632 --> 29:20.354
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to make fun of SNK because... They're still making 16-bit games all these years later.

29:20.374 --> 29:23.854
[SPEAKER_02]: The last four games that have come out from them have been anthologies.

29:24.895 --> 29:26.695
[SPEAKER_02]: No offense, I mean, hey, you know what?

29:26.955 --> 29:28.235
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not the only company that does that.

29:28.335 --> 29:29.636
[SPEAKER_02]: Capcom and Activision.

29:30.536 --> 29:31.196
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Midway.

29:31.936 --> 29:35.537
[SPEAKER_06]: But some of the anthologies, like the Mega Man anthology, kicks ass.

29:35.797 --> 29:37.097
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

29:37.578 --> 29:38.918
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, you know, seriously...

29:39.984 --> 29:44.206
[SPEAKER_02]: Metal Slug 3, Metal Slug 1, they've been re-released so many times.

29:44.847 --> 29:49.069
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, okay, great, we love these games, but let's make something new, okay?

29:49.109 --> 30:07.920
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so there's of course a new Street Fighter movie coming out, and I'm not sure whether you're going to be happy about that or not, but apparently one of the stars that they have casted so far is in the role of Chung-Li, and it's Smallville's Christine Kreek, and

30:08.604 --> 30:10.165
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, she doesn't look Asian to me.

30:10.886 --> 30:12.127
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, she looks hot.

30:12.147 --> 30:13.988
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the one that plays Lana?

30:15.669 --> 30:16.250
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe so.

30:16.670 --> 30:17.430
[SPEAKER_01]: She's Asian.

30:18.511 --> 30:19.532
[SPEAKER_02]: She doesn't look Asian.

30:21.313 --> 30:23.635
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, that's not... I don't know.

30:24.255 --> 30:26.517
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, it'll work, I think.

30:27.538 --> 30:28.198
[SPEAKER_06]: Is she hot?

30:28.538 --> 30:30.600
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's what most of the boys want to know.

30:30.680 --> 30:31.260
[SPEAKER_06]: Is she hot?

30:31.661 --> 30:32.301
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the girls.

30:32.661 --> 30:35.964
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's the most important thing, isn't it?

30:36.324 --> 30:37.665
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, ethnicity be damned.

30:38.214 --> 30:47.738
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so I don't know if you really need to be honest, the last Street Fighter movie didn't set the bar too high, so I mean, you don't have to try that hard to make a good movie here.

30:47.938 --> 30:49.098
[SPEAKER_01]: But it had Kylie.

30:49.198 --> 30:51.839
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Kylie Minogue was awesome as Cammy.

30:53.200 --> 30:53.800
[SPEAKER_06]: And who was Chun-Li?

30:53.840 --> 30:55.220
[SPEAKER_06]: Ming-Na was Chun-Li.

30:55.240 --> 30:56.101
[SPEAKER_06]: She's on ER now.

30:56.221 --> 30:56.841
[SPEAKER_06]: She wasn't bad.

30:57.801 --> 30:58.282
[SPEAKER_06]: She wasn't bad.

30:59.882 --> 31:03.263
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, anyways, I've actually watched this little video here.

31:04.264 --> 31:04.724
[SPEAKER_02]: There isn't

31:05.558 --> 31:08.740
[SPEAKER_02]: A conference that went on, a hacking conference called 24C3.

31:09.801 --> 31:20.749
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, I guess, an annual four-day conference organized by a hacking group called Chaos Computer Club, where, of course, thousands of hackers and scientists, artists, etc.

31:21.389 --> 31:21.729
[SPEAKER_02]: gather.

31:22.350 --> 31:29.395
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that they showed off was that they have completely hacked the Wii.

31:29.755 --> 31:31.116
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an unmodded Wii.

31:31.396 --> 31:32.197
[SPEAKER_02]: They were managed to...

31:32.947 --> 31:35.608
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't say it's unmodded, but there's no mod ship running in it.

31:35.789 --> 31:43.753
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've, using a specially made disc and a kind of a serial port thing, they called it, what was it, a tweezer attack.

31:44.934 --> 31:49.016
[SPEAKER_02]: They were able to run homebrew software in Wii mode.

31:49.136 --> 31:56.200
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually before that, they've only been able to do it through the GameCube operating system or whatever on there.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.401
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all been limited to GameCube.

31:59.440 --> 31:59.720
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

32:28.840 --> 32:31.202
[SPEAKER_02]: You can start and stop the drives and stuff like that.

32:31.602 --> 32:33.784
[SPEAKER_01]: That reminds me of something that I saw on YouTube.

32:34.304 --> 32:35.686
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a feeling we're thinking of the same thing.

32:35.726 --> 32:36.006
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

32:36.046 --> 32:38.628
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy did the target placing.

32:38.991 --> 32:40.692
[SPEAKER_06]: That shit, that is the same thing I'm thinking of.

32:40.732 --> 32:41.832
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't that shit amazing?

32:42.112 --> 32:42.652
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty cool.

32:42.692 --> 32:44.253
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see, okay, did you see that YouTube?

32:44.273 --> 32:51.636
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy, and I can't remember his name, I'm sorry, maybe somebody in chat remembers, but he was a student at some school and he put together this thing where I'll see if I can find it.

32:51.676 --> 32:59.979
[SPEAKER_06]: He swapped the Wiimote and the sensor bar to create this, you know, the television instead of

33:00.519 --> 33:03.981
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking like a normal Wii game, it looked like a portal into another world.

33:04.001 --> 33:07.864
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't use the sensor bar itself, he actually used two infrareds attached to goggles.

33:08.204 --> 33:11.086
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the sensor bar itself has an infrared reflect.

33:11.306 --> 33:12.247
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, and he put them in the glasses.

33:12.587 --> 33:16.429
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was basically, this YouTube is amazing, it's had over a million views, I'm sure most of you have seen it.

33:16.850 --> 33:25.215
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was basically, he kind of called out a lot of the game developers in it and said, Hey, if you want to do something this cool, you should give me a call or you should do it.

33:25.475 --> 33:26.436
[SPEAKER_06]: I just told you how to do it.

33:27.562 --> 33:28.723
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked amazing.

33:28.783 --> 33:32.225
[SPEAKER_06]: Just even in the little YouTube, the way... Oh, wow.

33:32.645 --> 33:35.807
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, yeah, it was like a head tracking, a VR head tracking is what it is.

33:35.827 --> 33:39.469
[SPEAKER_02]: They have that right now for, like, flight sims.

33:39.489 --> 33:41.510
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, they're showing flight sim 10 or whatever.

33:43.251 --> 33:49.875
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that, and you can actually do it where it will... That was not a hacking thing this guy did.

33:50.235 --> 33:56.359
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he made his own custom program, but, you know, still, the hardware he used was all pretty much, you know,

33:56.963 --> 33:58.044
[SPEAKER_06]: Stuff that could easily be done.

33:58.464 --> 33:59.225
[SPEAKER_06]: It just looked amazing.

33:59.365 --> 34:05.971
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can adjust, I guess, scale it so you don't have to look completely behind you to look behind you and stuff like that.

34:06.571 --> 34:08.193
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, it's pretty cool.

34:08.833 --> 34:15.499
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had some other things, too, like on how to make a VR whiteboard type thing and some other stuff.

34:15.779 --> 34:16.059
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

34:16.600 --> 34:22.445
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyways, other things to note here.

34:24.363 --> 34:31.467
[SPEAKER_02]: Some that may not be too happy, unfortunately, and I hate to be the one to mention this, but I'm just going to say it.

34:32.207 --> 34:41.092
[SPEAKER_02]: This hasn't really been out there that much, or actually it hasn't been out there yet, this news, but I'll just say it, I guess.

34:41.973 --> 34:45.495
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a very likely situation that Smash Bros.

34:45.555 --> 34:46.776
[SPEAKER_02]: may have been delayed another month.

34:49.117 --> 34:50.438
[SPEAKER_06]: And where is this coming from?

34:51.365 --> 34:57.989
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I just happened to see a date change in our system for March now for Smash Bros.

34:58.670 --> 35:00.150
[SPEAKER_06]: So it could just be an anomaly.

35:00.290 --> 35:01.091
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be an anomaly.

35:01.111 --> 35:02.031
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be one of those things.

35:02.632 --> 35:04.793
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here's why I think it might be true, though.

35:04.913 --> 35:06.734
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're running into problems.

35:06.774 --> 35:12.077
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there are so many, you know, places that they can manufacture Wii discs.

35:12.778 --> 35:19.101
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now they're at full production, and because of that, a lot of games are getting delayed because they can't manufacture this in time.

35:19.922 --> 35:20.002
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

35:21.070 --> 35:27.294
[SPEAKER_02]: and they've said a few months ago that all Wii games and some DS games will be affected by this.

35:28.014 --> 35:33.657
[SPEAKER_02]: And so being that the case, one of two things could be happening here.

35:33.917 --> 35:40.421
[SPEAKER_02]: One, distribution may not be getting their copies, but retail will be if there's going to be a shortage like that.

35:40.621 --> 35:46.544
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're anticipating that there's going to be a shortage, they're going to delay it for everybody else for a month, or it really is delayed a month.

35:47.445 --> 35:48.986
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now, just...

35:49.957 --> 35:55.098
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be surprised if you see that news come out, but I wouldn't confirm it 100% yet.

35:55.799 --> 35:56.279
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

35:58.359 --> 35:58.699
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

35:58.919 --> 36:02.300
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, as some folks are hoping, could it be that they've delayed it to add Mega Man?

36:04.121 --> 36:05.721
[SPEAKER_06]: I somehow doubt that.

36:05.741 --> 36:09.762
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't the guy who made Mega Man come out this week and say Mega Man is not in Smash Bros.

36:09.902 --> 36:10.362
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

36:10.422 --> 36:12.023
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm almost positive I read a story about that.

36:12.043 --> 36:16.444
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone thought that the 20th anniversary of Mega Man, they were going to announce that Mega Man was going to be in there.

36:16.821 --> 36:18.822
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

36:37.049 --> 36:39.671
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

37:04.713 --> 37:10.496
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime that we've been delayed product or whatever, like say, oh, we're not going to ship you this much or whatever, they didn't change the street date.

37:10.516 --> 37:12.797
[SPEAKER_02]: They just, here's the date for this.

37:12.978 --> 37:15.539
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, by the way, you're not getting any until this time.

37:17.620 --> 37:22.103
[SPEAKER_02]: I doubt they would change the date, but I'm just saying, you know, it's about a month.

37:22.143 --> 37:25.645
[SPEAKER_02]: I think March 9th is what we showed, but keep us posted.

37:25.845 --> 37:26.185
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

37:26.205 --> 37:26.685
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll keep you posted.

37:26.725 --> 37:27.986
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard it here first.

37:28.206 --> 37:29.347
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to mention one other thing.

37:29.427 --> 37:33.669
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two other games actually that

37:34.704 --> 37:36.024
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

37:55.720 --> 38:06.688
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to mention one other thing real quick Silent Hill Origins that was coming out on Playstation 2 in Japan it is coming out over here too

38:25.365 --> 38:27.126
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, sooner than later, March.

38:27.726 --> 38:28.007
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice!

38:29.147 --> 38:34.511
[SPEAKER_02]: Very excited about that, you know, because I didn't play too much of the PSP version, but PlayStation 2, that might be pretty cool.

38:35.491 --> 38:38.793
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I guess I could plug in my PSP to my TV and do the same thing.

38:40.234 --> 38:42.015
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, let's see here.

38:42.816 --> 38:43.496
[SPEAKER_02]: What else we've got?

38:43.816 --> 38:44.757
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the DS.

38:46.042 --> 38:47.163
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing that already.

39:13.786 --> 39:14.566
[SPEAKER_06]: How's it going?

39:14.626 --> 39:16.167
[SPEAKER_06]: You do Christmas nights this time of year, right?

39:16.187 --> 39:16.887
[SPEAKER_01]: I do Christmas nights.

39:16.947 --> 39:17.387
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times?

39:18.467 --> 39:19.708
[SPEAKER_01]: Very hard to watch on my TV.

39:20.968 --> 39:23.929
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, you got a story for us real quick, and then we're going to open up the Skype line.

39:24.189 --> 39:28.711
[SPEAKER_06]: So, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, is Orange Lounge Radio.

39:29.331 --> 39:31.131
[SPEAKER_06]: Call in and talk to us about the year 2007.

39:31.191 --> 39:42.035
[SPEAKER_01]: This is more of a humor thing, because I think it's pretty damn funny, is that Nokia's N-Gage first access platform has been delayed.

39:42.972 --> 39:43.312
[SPEAKER_01]: Dantum

40:10.646 --> 40:11.546
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, by this news.

40:11.706 --> 40:13.067
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever happened to the fucking Phantom?

40:13.427 --> 40:14.407
[SPEAKER_02]: The lap board came out.

40:15.047 --> 40:15.328
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

40:15.788 --> 40:15.968
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

40:16.548 --> 40:18.449
[SPEAKER_06]: So it went from being console to lap board?

40:18.669 --> 40:18.849
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

40:19.509 --> 40:19.949
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

40:20.169 --> 40:22.610
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think the console was going to work when they were showing it off.

40:23.370 --> 40:24.370
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was just a PC.

40:24.430 --> 40:25.371
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I don't get this.

40:25.731 --> 40:27.411
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would download PC games?

40:27.792 --> 40:30.352
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently Steam worked, so I was wrong there.

40:30.452 --> 40:33.493
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, I mean, I don't know.

40:33.653 --> 40:36.594
[SPEAKER_02]: If they had a console that was just Steam, that might be pretty cool.

40:37.535 --> 40:37.795
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

40:38.275 --> 40:38.535
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

40:39.249 --> 40:43.453
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, our Skype line is open, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

40:43.533 --> 40:45.495
[SPEAKER_06]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

40:45.535 --> 40:51.721
[SPEAKER_06]: Please remember, though, if you're going to call us on Skype, give our test call a call first.

40:51.741 --> 40:57.146
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Echo 123 on Skype, and that way you don't sound like shit when you get through on the Skype line.

40:57.606 --> 41:04.633
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we're going to do is we're going to recap some of the stories that we went over this year in the various months of the year.

41:05.595 --> 41:07.776
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll explain how that works as soon as we take our first call.

41:07.836 --> 41:08.796
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

41:08.816 --> 41:09.196
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

41:09.876 --> 41:10.917
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Raven's Dolphin.

41:10.957 --> 41:11.537
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me?

41:11.817 --> 41:12.877
[SPEAKER_06]: I can hear you, sir.

41:12.917 --> 41:13.397
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

41:14.398 --> 41:15.018
[SPEAKER_06]: I am fine.

41:15.058 --> 41:18.919
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, goddamn, if it wouldn't be a year in review show if we didn't have you here, Raven's Dolphin.

41:18.959 --> 41:20.219
[SPEAKER_06]: So I appreciate you calling in.

41:20.259 --> 41:20.820
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?

41:21.700 --> 41:22.420
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing fine.

41:22.460 --> 41:24.661
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm playing Mario Galaxy just like you are.

41:24.941 --> 41:25.881
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it fucking great?

41:27.182 --> 41:28.442
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think it's fucking great.

41:28.522 --> 41:29.062
[SPEAKER_05]: I really do.

41:29.602 --> 41:29.962
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

41:30.443 --> 41:31.723
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, go ahead.

41:32.608 --> 41:35.530
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing about Mario Galaxy that impresses me is the graphics.

41:36.331 --> 41:42.917
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the Wii's a piece of shit, that's what some people say, but I really think that the Wii can pull off some really good graphics.

41:43.197 --> 41:48.381
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and we've said it before on this show, Nintendo loves to have aces in their sleeves.

41:48.922 --> 41:56.468
[SPEAKER_06]: And their systems always have these little hidden features and are probably capable of much more than people usually give them credit for originally.

41:56.488 --> 41:58.049
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how they extend the life of their systems.

41:58.450 --> 42:01.092
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm sure you have not seen the best looking Wii game yet.

42:02.148 --> 42:04.109
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but this one is pretty good.

42:04.229 --> 42:10.032
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like what they did with the little effects, the little, like, twinkles, the little things.

42:10.052 --> 42:13.693
[SPEAKER_05]: You go in the air, you see little things here and there, you know?

42:13.753 --> 42:15.034
[SPEAKER_06]: The water shines.

42:15.154 --> 42:20.797
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, something to keep in mind, too, Raven's Dolphin, is that Mario Galaxy was not a ported GameCube game either.

42:21.117 --> 42:21.597
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

42:21.737 --> 42:26.099
[SPEAKER_06]: It was truly an original game, and I think that's part of what made it stand out.

42:26.119 --> 42:26.840
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

42:27.560 --> 42:29.521
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is colorful, so that's all I'm going to say.

42:30.217 --> 42:34.679
[SPEAKER_06]: Raven, we're going to ask you to help us kind of recap the year here a little bit.

42:34.719 --> 42:36.179
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to kind of go month by month.

42:36.219 --> 42:43.562
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to tell you about some of the top stories we went over, and I'd like to hear your thoughts on what you thought was really the standout story from that month.

42:43.642 --> 42:44.043
[SPEAKER_06]: Sound good?

42:45.183 --> 42:46.403
[SPEAKER_06]: I was waiting for this, yeah.

42:46.463 --> 42:48.924
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, then we'll get your best and worst game of the year at the end.

42:48.964 --> 42:54.387
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's take a trip all the way back to January, and January started off with Orange Ones Radio episode 215.

42:55.587 --> 42:57.067
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

43:18.180 --> 43:19.041
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

43:47.761 --> 43:52.463
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a very tragic thing, and I remember that you didn't do a show that week when that story broke.

43:52.503 --> 43:52.803
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

43:52.843 --> 43:54.184
[SPEAKER_06]: We only did three shows in January.

43:54.204 --> 43:56.865
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember what happened, but we were off for a week in January.

43:56.885 --> 43:58.226
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at Disneyland.

43:58.606 --> 44:00.027
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we both were at Disneyland.

44:00.047 --> 44:00.888
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it was.

44:00.928 --> 44:03.309
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my first trip to Disneyland in a long time, so we were off.

44:03.369 --> 44:06.350
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was Martin Luther King weekend, and that's the weekend it all went down.

44:06.911 --> 44:07.231
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right.

44:07.271 --> 44:14.635
[SPEAKER_06]: We weren't on that week, and we came back, and we were just like, you know, if you think it's bad on the internet, try living here where it's all going down.

44:15.306 --> 44:17.931
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, you were doing your little guise on the show and you recapped it there.

44:19.152 --> 44:27.005
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that I was just whole surprised that, you know, no one had ever heard of, you know, drinking too much water.

44:27.849 --> 44:46.614
[SPEAKER_06]: and it was so funny because I remember especially in Sacramento, the area where we live, there's only been so many, there has not been, I don't have a number, there have not been that many water deaths in this country, but there have been multiple ones in the Sacramento region in the past couple years because there was the frat kid.

44:47.014 --> 44:48.135
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

45:03.613 --> 45:08.934
[SPEAKER_06]: Unlike I predicted earlier in the year, I believe when this story first launched, 107.9 is still the end.

45:08.974 --> 45:10.414
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still owned by the same people.

45:11.094 --> 45:13.075
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a new morning program in place now.

45:13.095 --> 45:18.216
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember what they're called, but they have other, you know, wacky morning DJs on there doing their thing.

45:20.036 --> 45:21.716
[SPEAKER_06]: Same old stick, but with different people.

45:22.876 --> 45:31.178
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it was good that the ones that were in charge of that got fired, because honestly, I guess the majority of people in the world just don't know better.

45:32.218 --> 45:32.718
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's

45:33.707 --> 45:35.308
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

45:55.626 --> 45:58.787
[SPEAKER_06]: We had the Weather Channel was forthcoming in the News Channel.

45:58.807 --> 46:00.987
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the News Channel finally launched in January.

46:01.467 --> 46:08.449
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason why it's kind of noteworthy is because it was a game console doing something pretty major other than games.

46:09.049 --> 46:09.969
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the News Channel.

46:10.789 --> 46:13.370
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not watched the News Channel ever.

46:14.290 --> 46:14.530
[SPEAKER_06]: Ever?

46:14.650 --> 46:15.550
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need to.

46:15.670 --> 46:17.250
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anybody actually use the News Channel?

46:17.651 --> 46:18.271
[SPEAKER_06]: How about chat?

46:18.331 --> 46:19.911
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anybody in chat use the News Channel?

46:21.175 --> 46:22.676
[SPEAKER_06]: Complete waste of time.

46:22.856 --> 46:24.176
[SPEAKER_06]: Should be able to remove that crap.

46:24.256 --> 46:25.397
[SPEAKER_06]: Raven, do you use the news channel?

46:26.037 --> 46:27.518
[SPEAKER_05]: I used it when it first came out.

46:27.538 --> 46:30.539
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember what the first headline when you went to technology was?

46:31.439 --> 46:31.799
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

46:32.220 --> 46:32.700
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it was the...

46:34.022 --> 46:35.423
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't it the woman dying from the Wii?

46:35.603 --> 46:35.944
[SPEAKER_06]: Or what?

46:36.264 --> 46:39.046
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was the PlayStation 3 launching in Europe.

46:39.426 --> 46:40.287
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember that.

46:40.327 --> 46:41.107
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

46:41.348 --> 46:42.328
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, you got a good memory.

46:42.388 --> 46:42.869
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

46:42.989 --> 46:49.614
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember I was amused because the first story I brought up in the technology was a story about the PlayStation 3 launching.

46:49.654 --> 46:51.595
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I'm reading about the PlayStation 3 on my Wii.

46:51.635 --> 46:52.176
[SPEAKER_06]: This is weird.

46:54.117 --> 46:55.418
[SPEAKER_05]: Feels like an oxymoron, doesn't it?

46:56.222 --> 46:58.563
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft says my brother does use it daily.

46:59.663 --> 47:01.504
[SPEAKER_06]: Color of Sakura says I have used the channel.

47:01.864 --> 47:04.585
[SPEAKER_06]: Macman says I use the new channel to wipe my ass.

47:05.845 --> 47:07.726
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't use the channel at all.

47:08.106 --> 47:11.087
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I looked at it once and I went like, ah, don't need it.

47:11.947 --> 47:15.829
[SPEAKER_06]: I use it once in a while just kind of to spin the globe.

47:17.469 --> 47:21.331
[SPEAKER_06]: And check out, because like sometimes you really want to know what's going on and like, you know.

47:23.671 --> 47:25.392
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to spin the globe and make everyone dizzy.

47:25.412 --> 47:25.472
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

47:25.902 --> 47:28.003
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but everyone forgot about it long after.

47:28.043 --> 47:28.804
[SPEAKER_06]: It lingered like a bad smell.

47:28.824 --> 47:29.084
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

47:48.888 --> 47:49.788
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like some other ones.

47:49.948 --> 47:55.491
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, because it seemed like that story came up a couple other times, because then, like, you know, the family was going to sue Nintendo.

47:55.511 --> 47:56.571
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember that was a big follow-up story.

47:56.591 --> 47:57.432
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because they're stupid.

47:57.492 --> 48:01.373
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's ridiculous, because Nintendo didn't have anything to do with it other than making the product.

48:02.374 --> 48:02.774
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God.

48:02.814 --> 48:04.715
[SPEAKER_01]: Stupid people irritate the shit out of me.

48:04.835 --> 48:08.576
[SPEAKER_06]: But because they made the product, they engineered the desire for the product.

48:08.596 --> 48:11.457
[SPEAKER_06]: To be fair, they didn't actually sue Nintendo.

48:11.497 --> 48:12.978
[SPEAKER_06]: It was an exploratory thing.

48:13.018 --> 48:15.199
[SPEAKER_06]: They were thinking of doing it, and they decided not to.

48:15.219 --> 48:16.219
[SPEAKER_06]: So intelligence didn't prevail.

48:16.239 --> 48:17.420
[SPEAKER_01]: Even considering it stupid.

48:18.649 --> 48:19.689
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

48:36.394 --> 48:40.316
[SPEAKER_06]: A Games as Porn bill failed in the state of Utah.

48:40.997 --> 48:43.998
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, especially the games that are out now, I would not consider those porn.

48:44.879 --> 48:45.399
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeez.

48:45.719 --> 48:46.199
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's right.

48:46.279 --> 48:51.602
[SPEAKER_06]: Utah was going to, at one point, put some of the adult games, basically regulate it the same way they did porn.

48:52.623 --> 48:53.944
[SPEAKER_06]: But that bill failed in early January.

48:53.964 --> 48:56.125
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes absolutely no sense to this day.

48:56.425 --> 48:59.186
[SPEAKER_05]: I still think to myself, okay, Mario as Porn.

48:59.366 --> 49:00.807
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great idea, Utah.

49:01.868 --> 49:04.129
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Manhunt 2, though, is Manhunt 2 porn?

49:04.829 --> 49:04.969
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

49:05.150 --> 49:05.830
[SPEAKER_06]: To them, it is.

49:06.428 --> 49:08.150
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

49:29.568 --> 49:29.888
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

49:30.189 --> 49:44.308
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, moving on through the month, episode 219, one of the stick-out stories from that episode, Codemasters had to replace faulty Bubble Bobble DS cartridges when the boss in level 30 didn't fucking show up.

49:46.394 --> 49:47.074
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta love it.

50:03.702 --> 50:08.584
[SPEAKER_06]: and spilled the beans on some of the upcoming releases, including Jetpack and Tetris Online.

50:08.904 --> 50:17.366
[SPEAKER_06]: But what should also be noted is that this news came all the way back from February, and there were some other game titles that we never saw, like Juiced 2007 and Ob's Pinball.

50:17.766 --> 50:23.208
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, you know, a game like Ob's Pinball could have become the Pinball FX game that we did get.

50:23.268 --> 50:27.189
[SPEAKER_02]: Juiced 2007 is just Juiced 2 Hot Import Nights.

50:28.109 --> 50:30.450
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and it wasn't an actual arcade game or what have you?

50:30.470 --> 50:30.650
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

50:30.830 --> 50:32.591
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, gotcha.

50:32.611 --> 50:32.791
[SPEAKER_06]: It was...

50:33.737 --> 50:34.178
[SPEAKER_06]: Those people suck.

50:49.153 --> 50:57.776
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode number 221, the last show we did in February, was the week that Warhawk was announced that it was only going to be a downloadable title on the PlayStation 3.

50:57.916 --> 50:59.376
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was rumored.

50:59.416 --> 51:00.377
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it rumored?

51:00.417 --> 51:01.917
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was confirmed for a while.

51:01.937 --> 51:08.659
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was confirmed for a while, and then they came back and said, but we're also going to release it on Blu-ray with the headset and all this stuff.

51:09.139 --> 51:14.541
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was the week, though, that Warhawk was originally announced as a download-only title, which was big because...

51:15.365 --> 51:28.972
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, obviously this is one of the games that Sony was pushing and pushing when they first showed off the PlayStation 3, and for this to kind of go back and say, well, we're just going to make it a download-only game was kind of... Six-axis, all that stuff was going to be in it.

51:29.292 --> 51:40.458
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll never forget when they were showing off the six-axis, and he was trying to land the jet on the actual carrier thing, and it almost tipped it off the edge of the cliff because he didn't land it right.

51:41.001 --> 51:41.521
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hilarious.

51:41.541 --> 51:43.362
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'll remember of Warhawk.

51:43.863 --> 51:53.728
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so Raven, we have games as porn in Utah, Bubble Bobble, Broken, PartnerNet, Spills the Beans, and Warhawk download only on PlayStation 3.

51:53.768 --> 51:55.669
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think had the most impact from February?

51:55.729 --> 51:57.210
[SPEAKER_06]: The longest lasting impression on 2007 for gaming.

51:58.903 --> 52:02.346
[SPEAKER_05]: Or how about the fact that, did anybody test this game?

52:12.932 --> 52:14.693
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no testers in Codemasters.

52:14.753 --> 52:15.613
[SPEAKER_05]: That's hilarious.

52:16.093 --> 52:25.256
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently not, and it's kind of sad because I have a lot of friends who have been game testers that do very good jobs for various companies that they've worked for, and it was just kind of sad.

52:25.496 --> 52:38.721
[SPEAKER_06]: This kind of gave game testers everywhere a bad name that something like this slipped through the cracks, but obviously this was management cutting corners to meet some deadlines, and probably the game did not go through the extensive testing it should have, right?

52:38.741 --> 52:39.221
[SPEAKER_06]: It should have, right.

52:39.921 --> 52:45.223
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but to me, it just boggles the mind how the boss never showed up.

52:45.823 --> 52:47.603
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, how do you miss that?

52:48.264 --> 52:48.644
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

52:49.244 --> 52:50.084
[SPEAKER_06]: Good question.

52:50.204 --> 52:53.605
[SPEAKER_06]: Chatroom and Loki and DarkSakura, you guys agree with Raven's picks?

52:53.625 --> 52:57.707
[SPEAKER_06]: You think the Wii for a Wii and the Bubble Bobble were probably the biggest stories out of those months?

52:59.907 --> 53:00.267
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

53:00.467 --> 53:01.668
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess.

53:01.848 --> 53:02.048
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

53:02.771 --> 53:03.091
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

53:03.672 --> 53:20.467
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Raven, while we get the chatroom's impressions of your picks there, why don't you tell us what, in your opinion, and you can use any criteria you want, you don't have to listen to what the critics say or what anybody else says but yourself, what, in your opinion, was the worst game of 2007, the game that everybody should stay the hell away from?

53:21.247 --> 53:23.930
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, stay the hell away of this one game.

53:24.090 --> 53:27.593
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear to you, it's free, but it's not even more free.

53:28.334 --> 53:29.034
[SPEAKER_05]: Yaris for the 360.

53:30.168 --> 53:30.948
[SPEAKER_05]: Just stay away.

53:31.008 --> 53:34.109
[SPEAKER_06]: Toyota Yaris on the 360, the worst game of 2007.

53:34.569 --> 53:37.450
[SPEAKER_06]: Free and the robotic claw didn't do anything for you?

53:38.210 --> 53:38.970
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.

53:39.150 --> 53:40.770
[SPEAKER_05]: I want my time back.

53:40.850 --> 53:41.630
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want my money.

53:41.650 --> 53:43.091
[SPEAKER_05]: I want my time back for that.

53:44.191 --> 53:47.152
[SPEAKER_06]: Best game of 2007 in your opinion, Raven?

53:47.692 --> 53:48.112
[SPEAKER_06]: Just one?

53:48.752 --> 53:49.352
[SPEAKER_06]: Just one.

53:50.032 --> 53:53.653
[SPEAKER_06]: You can tell us what some of your runner-ups would be, but we just want to know your number one game.

53:53.673 --> 53:54.753
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only one we're writing down.

53:55.313 --> 53:55.693
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

53:55.713 --> 53:57.054
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'll go with Galaxy.

53:57.234 --> 53:58.054
[SPEAKER_05]: I really enjoy that.

54:00.219 --> 54:00.960
[SPEAKER_05]: I really enjoy it.

54:01.800 --> 54:08.464
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of those games that just shows off the Wii and just puts everything in a nice package going, Nintendo did something.

54:09.125 --> 54:11.426
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything kind of close for you?

54:12.547 --> 54:15.489
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there's a lot of things close, like Bioshock and Call of Duty 4.

54:15.569 --> 54:16.950
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't complain with those.

54:17.530 --> 54:19.552
[SPEAKER_05]: Overall, was it a good year for games, Raven's Dolphin?

54:20.152 --> 54:21.793
[SPEAKER_05]: Overall, it's a great year for games.

54:22.033 --> 54:23.934
[SPEAKER_05]: I compare it to 2004.

54:24.555 --> 54:25.295
[SPEAKER_06]: What was so hot about 2004?

54:25.335 --> 54:25.575
[SPEAKER_06]: Remind us.

54:27.355 --> 54:34.339
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas, we had Halo 2, we had Half-Life 2, we had God of War 1.

54:35.219 --> 54:36.600
[SPEAKER_05]: All those games came out in that year.

54:37.040 --> 54:37.381
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

54:37.921 --> 54:40.682
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Raven Stolten, thanks so much for reflecting on the year with us.

54:40.722 --> 54:41.663
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it, alright?

54:42.383 --> 54:43.704
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for having me on.

54:43.844 --> 54:44.945
[SPEAKER_06]: You are welcome, sir.

54:45.065 --> 54:45.905
[SPEAKER_06]: And best of luck in 2008.

54:45.965 --> 54:48.367
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll continue to hear from you in the year, right?

54:48.907 --> 54:49.307
[SPEAKER_06]: You bet.

54:49.427 --> 54:50.188
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, take care, buddy.

54:50.208 --> 54:50.268
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

54:51.510 --> 54:57.596
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to give us a call and help us out in March and April, give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

54:57.636 --> 55:02.861
[SPEAKER_06]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

55:03.281 --> 55:06.164
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to look at some of the comments in the chat room here.

55:06.224 --> 55:09.867
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkZombie says, I demand Yaris 2 for Xbox Live Arcade.

55:11.048 --> 55:13.371
[SPEAKER_06]: Shadowslayer says, Bubble Bobble is the best game ever.

55:13.431 --> 55:14.752
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming he means the original.

55:16.272 --> 55:16.973
[SPEAKER_06]: Not the newer one.

55:17.473 --> 55:20.435
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the phones and see who's going to join us for the next part of the show.

55:20.495 --> 55:21.496
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

55:21.516 --> 55:21.896
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

55:23.438 --> 55:24.979
[SPEAKER_04]: This is DJ Dark Knight in the house.

55:25.539 --> 55:26.780
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, DJ Dark Knight.

55:26.820 --> 55:27.761
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing, my friend?

55:28.721 --> 55:29.122
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm alright.

55:29.162 --> 55:30.362
[SPEAKER_06]: How about y'all guys?

55:30.703 --> 55:31.683
[SPEAKER_06]: I am excellent.

55:32.224 --> 55:36.167
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Dark Knight, are you ready to reflect on some of the previous months here in 2007?

55:36.207 --> 55:41.470
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I wanted to kind of follow up on that bubble ball thing, but it might be a little bit later on.

55:41.771 --> 55:42.151
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, sir.

55:42.171 --> 55:42.631
[SPEAKER_04]: There was another...

55:46.303 --> 55:50.525
[SPEAKER_04]: Number DS game that had that same problem, and it was SNK vs. Capcom Carfighters.

55:50.645 --> 55:54.487
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the one card that wouldn't... Yeah, I remember that.

55:54.507 --> 55:57.268
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't get past the thing because the game would lock up or something.

55:57.288 --> 56:00.149
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a card didn't... Yeah, a card froze the game or something.

56:00.169 --> 56:00.650
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

56:00.690 --> 56:04.832
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was interesting that that Bubble Bobble thing kind of started a trend, sadly.

56:05.192 --> 56:06.792
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

56:07.113 --> 56:09.994
[SPEAKER_04]: That one really hurt everybody for a while.

56:10.205 --> 56:10.906
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

56:23.542 --> 56:25.483
[SPEAKER_06]: This happened a little bit before.

56:25.603 --> 56:29.624
[SPEAKER_06]: The details were leaked before the Game Developers Conference.

56:29.704 --> 56:33.905
[SPEAKER_06]: But episode 222, the first week of March, was when we really started getting the details on PlayStation Home.

56:34.425 --> 56:39.226
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the thing about PlayStation Home was it kind of made our collective jaws drop a little bit.

56:39.546 --> 56:45.087
[SPEAKER_06]: Because at this point, a lot of us had really written off the PlayStation 3 as the joke of this generation.

56:45.627 --> 56:49.968
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when PlayStation Home was announced, a lot of us kind of turned our heads and went, Really?

56:50.949 --> 56:51.349
[SPEAKER_06]: Really now?

56:51.389 --> 56:52.229
[SPEAKER_06]: This looks interesting.

56:52.779 --> 56:53.660
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it looks interesting.

56:53.680 --> 56:54.760
[SPEAKER_06]: Wish it would come out now.

56:55.601 --> 56:55.861
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

56:56.101 --> 56:56.542
[SPEAKER_02]: Someday.

56:56.902 --> 57:01.645
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, now as we know, the damn thing still hasn't come out, but as I said before, I think Sony's spreading themselves too thin.

57:01.986 --> 57:07.049
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Home is still a great idea, and I can't wait to see it in 2008 or whenever it finally comes out.

57:07.850 --> 57:08.890
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

57:08.930 --> 57:13.173
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Knight, do you think PlayStation Home is worthy of selling PlayStation 3s?

57:14.054 --> 57:14.474
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

57:14.514 --> 57:16.976
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a good idea.

57:17.216 --> 57:18.017
[SPEAKER_04]: They try to...

57:19.179 --> 57:24.064
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it'll work.

57:24.104 --> 57:26.667
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it'll do much good.

57:27.628 --> 57:29.730
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see in 2008 when the thing finally comes out.

57:29.750 --> 57:41.962
[SPEAKER_02]: People like making their avatars and stuff, and to be honest, I wish Home was something that Nintendo was doing with the Miis, because I think that would've really launched that con- I mean, not that they really need any help selling the console, but

57:42.329 --> 57:43.830
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

58:11.369 --> 58:23.874
[SPEAKER_06]: and at the Game Developers Conference, I believe, Microsoft announced that they were going to be upping the arcade limit, which allowed some more titles to come out that were much bigger, such as Castlevania Symphony of the Night, I believe, was the first one that broke the 50 meg limit.

58:23.894 --> 58:25.254
[SPEAKER_06]: It was something like 90 megs.

58:26.095 --> 58:34.338
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously the memory card sizes had to be upgraded as well, which I certainly don't think anybody sees this as a bad decision by Microsoft.

58:34.378 --> 58:35.898
[SPEAKER_06]: It was probably one they should have made a while ago.

58:36.699 --> 58:40.500
[SPEAKER_06]: Why they ever limited it in the first place was a little weird, but I guess it was because of the memory cards.

58:41.340 --> 58:45.644
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because, I mean, and I don't think that many people actually bought them, like, talking about it.

58:45.664 --> 58:50.028
[SPEAKER_04]: I think most of the people bought the 512 one only because it came with Geometry Wars in it.

58:51.229 --> 58:52.290
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I guess that's a good point.

58:52.570 --> 58:56.274
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, you know, you just, you have the core and the memory card's all you need.

58:56.354 --> 59:06.603
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, I think most of the hardcore gamers like you and I and probably most of the people that, you know, seek out gaming podcasts and therefore listen to this program, we probably all understand why you need a hard drive.

59:07.253 --> 59:18.297
[SPEAKER_06]: But for those people that bought their Xbox 360s just so they could play Madden, you know, have it be their party machine, I suppose, you know, memory cards are what they're going to buy because that's what they're used to from PlayStation.

59:19.057 --> 59:19.877
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, right.

59:20.958 --> 59:28.380
[SPEAKER_04]: And plus, like I said, the last system, I remember the other system I had that had a hard drive in it was the Sega Saturn.

59:28.980 --> 59:33.802
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was kind of like a take back when I saw that the 360, the newer systems would have that.

59:34.545 --> 59:35.906
[SPEAKER_06]: What about the old school Xbox though?

59:35.926 --> 59:38.428
[SPEAKER_06]: The first Xbox, they all had hard drives built in.

59:39.068 --> 59:39.689
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, that's right.

59:39.729 --> 59:41.029
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot they did.

59:41.310 --> 59:42.711
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox One had a hard drive.

59:43.531 --> 59:48.414
[SPEAKER_06]: Ironically enough, Xbox One didn't really use the hard drive though like it should have.

59:48.815 --> 59:58.201
[SPEAKER_06]: It almost seems like Microsoft when they originally conceptualized the original Xbox wanted to do some of the things from the very beginning that they didn't do until the Xbox 360.

59:58.321 --> 59:59.402
[SPEAKER_06]: It almost feels like that way.

01:00:00.211 --> 01:00:01.613
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, maybe it's just me.

01:00:01.653 --> 01:00:08.423
[SPEAKER_04]: I think most of the people use it just to record music, just use their music and play their CDs and whatnot and save it to the hard drive.

01:00:08.443 --> 01:00:09.925
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really all you could use it for.

01:00:10.706 --> 01:00:11.047
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:00:11.628 --> 01:00:11.788
[SPEAKER_06]: Well...

01:00:12.708 --> 01:00:13.008
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't fake.

01:00:13.028 --> 01:00:13.469
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't fake.

01:00:41.974 --> 01:00:48.456
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason why I picked that is not necessarily the announcement itself, but all the fallout.

01:00:48.776 --> 01:01:04.662
[SPEAKER_06]: The backlash that came from that because it definitely kind of showed, you know, A, can the independent media be trusted and who are these guys and da-da-da, and kind of B, you know, when Namco, obviously, you know, as most people know, it's not a very big secret now.

01:01:04.702 --> 01:01:07.123
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that the game's out, I think we can talk a little more openly about this.

01:01:07.143 --> 01:01:07.263
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:01:07.583 --> 01:01:20.554
[SPEAKER_06]: Namco put the smacketh down a little bit and there wasn't a lot we could do because we are an independent organization because this is something that is run out of our spare times and because the fact these you know we don't have the

01:01:21.368 --> 01:01:23.009
[SPEAKER_06]: and many more.

01:01:45.925 --> 01:01:50.372
[SPEAKER_04]: They was up in arms about it and Sony was like, okay, okay, okay, we'll bend, we bend, we bend.

01:01:50.752 --> 01:01:51.173
[SPEAKER_04]: But it hurt.

01:01:51.213 --> 01:01:51.494
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just...

01:01:54.671 --> 01:01:56.492
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing's worse than a community scorn.

01:01:56.672 --> 01:02:01.976
[SPEAKER_06]: But unfortunately, we don't have that same oomph that Kotaku has.

01:02:02.036 --> 01:02:03.156
[SPEAKER_06]: It just kind of sucks.

01:02:03.256 --> 01:02:07.159
[SPEAKER_06]: But it definitely was a very interesting thing to watch.

01:02:07.199 --> 01:02:09.820
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it was a hell of a thing to see from the inside.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:13.843
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure on the outside it was probably pretty interesting too.

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:16.044
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I do my own show.

01:02:16.064 --> 01:02:18.146
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of sketchy on most of the release news.

01:02:18.226 --> 01:02:18.526
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like...

01:02:18.926 --> 01:02:19.406
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to jail.

01:02:19.426 --> 01:02:20.027
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to jail.

01:02:20.087 --> 01:02:22.148
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to jail.

01:02:45.743 --> 01:02:47.925
[SPEAKER_06]: Views and opinions expressed by Loki, please don't sue us.

01:02:49.627 --> 01:02:58.876
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode number 225, there was one more episode that came out in March, and that was the episode where Devil May Cry 4 was announced that it will no longer be a PlayStation 3 exclusive.

01:02:59.296 --> 01:03:02.880
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously that had a big impact because that kind of left...

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:12.165
[SPEAKER_06]: Metal Gear Solid 4, and Final Fantasy XIII is the only real AAA, Super Grade A, PlayStation 3 exclusives left.

01:03:12.225 --> 01:03:14.987
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this was huge the week that this one was announced.

01:03:15.307 --> 01:03:19.990
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it was like, oh my gosh, one of the big three just jumped ship, and it's now going to be Xbox 360.

01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:28.395
[SPEAKER_06]: And now, flashing forward to where we're at now, not only is it also coming out on the Xbox 360, but they're making bundles out of it in Japan.

01:03:28.675 --> 01:03:30.716
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole Devil May Cry bundles now are coming out.

01:03:31.397 --> 01:03:34.020
[SPEAKER_06]: Devil May Cry for 360 if he doesn't get one.

01:03:36.442 --> 01:03:37.263
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, don't get me wrong.

01:03:37.323 --> 01:03:38.645
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw a preview of the game in it.

01:03:39.165 --> 01:03:39.946
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to look good.

01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:43.170
[SPEAKER_06]: It does look pretty awesome.

01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:44.030
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to check it out.

01:03:44.050 --> 01:03:48.555
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never really followed the Devil May Cry series that closely, but this game may have to make me change my mind.

01:03:48.775 --> 01:03:50.778
[SPEAKER_01]: It has one thing going for it so far.

01:03:51.318 --> 01:03:52.319
[SPEAKER_01]: The return of Trish.

01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:55.133
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamie's happy.

01:03:55.733 --> 01:04:08.798
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, Dark Knight, out of those four stories, the unveiling of PlayStation Home, Microsoft upping the arcade limit, beautiful Katamari being spoiled by us, and Devil May Cry 4 no longer being a PlayStation 3 exclusive, which one do you think had the most impact in 2007?

01:04:09.078 --> 01:04:14.920
[SPEAKER_04]: I said Katamari spoiler thing, because like I said, it was just basically...

01:04:16.325 --> 01:04:44.175
[SPEAKER_04]: I open it to everybody to let them know that yeah, this really not only can affect the big guys but it can affect the minor guys and leak a story like that and have somebody go no, you might want to and I know because of our announcement those sales of Katamari have been so horrible just because of our announcement you know what's weird I actually wouldn't have picked the same story myself I wouldn't have, I would have went with the Devil May Cry story but that's alright

01:04:44.778 --> 01:04:49.360
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like I said, when I heard the aftermath about it, I was stunned.

01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:50.640
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, wow.

01:04:52.221 --> 01:04:56.302
[SPEAKER_04]: But it did kind of show that y'all had enough clout to get that much attention.

01:04:57.543 --> 01:04:57.863
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:04:58.263 --> 01:04:59.164
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there you have it.

01:04:59.864 --> 01:05:01.204
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, DarkSakura, do you agree?

01:05:01.484 --> 01:05:02.845
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that the biggest story in March?

01:05:03.025 --> 01:05:04.205
[SPEAKER_06]: Were we the biggest story in March?

01:05:04.245 --> 01:05:05.506
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we just being egotistical here?

01:05:07.423 --> 01:05:09.445
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree, actually, with the Devil May Cry thing.

01:05:09.865 --> 01:05:11.407
[SPEAKER_06]: You think Devil May Cry was a weird story?

01:05:11.567 --> 01:05:13.009
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care about Devil May Cry 4.

01:05:13.129 --> 01:05:17.114
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yeah, Devil May Cry 4 is on 360 and PS3.

01:05:17.354 --> 01:05:18.035
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good for them.

01:05:19.076 --> 01:05:25.964
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's more or less the total public recognition by another company that

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:29.281
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe the PlayStation 3 is a piece of shit.

01:05:29.641 --> 01:05:30.881
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it was for me, too.

01:05:30.921 --> 01:05:32.581
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't word it that strongly, but yes.

01:05:33.322 --> 01:05:34.942
[SPEAKER_01]: We want people to actually buy our game.

01:05:35.462 --> 01:05:37.103
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to put it on a system that people are buying.

01:05:37.283 --> 01:05:39.103
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what it was for me.

01:05:39.483 --> 01:05:44.684
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the way I would phrase it, is that it was really a company kind of acknowledging, Sony ain't selling the way we thought it would.

01:05:45.064 --> 01:05:47.085
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have to go put this game out on Microsoft as well.

01:05:47.105 --> 01:05:48.525
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they figured out, hey, guess what?

01:05:48.705 --> 01:05:53.406
[SPEAKER_02]: It isn't that hard to develop for the 360 and the PlayStation 3 at the same time.

01:05:53.766 --> 01:05:55.027
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty easy to port the code over.

01:05:55.247 --> 01:05:55.847
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do that.

01:05:56.624 --> 01:05:57.084
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

01:05:57.404 --> 01:05:57.744
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:05:57.864 --> 01:06:04.827
[SPEAKER_04]: I would throw a bonus one in and say basically Stranglehold having so much expectation it ended up being a bust.

01:06:04.847 --> 01:06:05.407
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.

01:06:05.427 --> 01:06:06.748
[SPEAKER_06]: Stranglehold was released in March.

01:06:06.768 --> 01:06:07.548
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember that.

01:06:07.928 --> 01:06:08.688
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it wasn't.

01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.329
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it?

01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:10.589
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was in March or later.

01:06:10.609 --> 01:06:12.850
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was in September and October.

01:06:13.050 --> 01:06:13.410
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it?

01:06:13.610 --> 01:06:13.850
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:06:14.090 --> 01:06:16.131
[SPEAKER_06]: But it seemed like this game, like it was at E3.

01:06:16.171 --> 01:06:18.472
[SPEAKER_06]: We first saw it at E3 like a year and a half ago.

01:06:19.324 --> 01:06:27.289
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was supposed to be like a release title for the 360 at one point the way they showed it.

01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:30.250
[SPEAKER_06]: It probably was originally supposed to come out in March and got delayed that whole time.

01:06:30.871 --> 01:06:32.972
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be true, but... Alright, well anyway.

01:06:33.332 --> 01:06:34.413
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about April.

01:06:35.074 --> 01:06:44.916
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode 226 kicked off April, and one of the top stories from that episode was the announcement that Sonic and Mario were going to be teaming up for a new game, Mario and Sonic at the Olympics.

01:06:45.477 --> 01:06:46.617
[SPEAKER_02]: And nobody cared.

01:06:46.857 --> 01:06:48.657
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hold on.

01:06:49.077 --> 01:06:55.819
[SPEAKER_06]: Now they don't, because after the game came out, I don't think most people cared anymore, but the week this was announced, this was huge news.

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:59.160
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of why I bring this up, because people were like, OMG, Sonic and Mario...

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:03.663
[SPEAKER_06]: But now, you know, obviously since then we've had Sonic be announced in Brawl and all that stuff too.

01:07:04.063 --> 01:07:10.788
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's not such a big deal, but at the time it was like, OMG, my childhood, you know, fantasies in some way.

01:07:11.028 --> 01:07:13.449
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, you know, the thing you never thought would happen is happening.

01:07:13.489 --> 01:07:14.930
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic and Mario in the same game.

01:07:15.771 --> 01:07:15.931
[SPEAKER_06]: True.

01:07:16.632 --> 01:07:17.292
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a big announcement.

01:07:17.662 --> 01:07:18.142
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode 227 in April

01:07:36.974 --> 01:07:38.355
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:08:02.558 --> 01:08:06.240
[SPEAKER_04]: and then like the Drum Mania Guitar Freaks thing.

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:11.763
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, and I think that's what it was for me is that, you know, obviously you had Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, Keyboard Mania in the arcades years ago.

01:08:11.884 --> 01:08:17.207
[SPEAKER_06]: It just kind of surprised me that it was like, whoa, somebody's actually going to try and do this in the U.S.

01:08:17.267 --> 01:08:21.209
[SPEAKER_06]: and they are going to put it all in one game and they're going to put it all in one box and see if it sells.

01:08:21.329 --> 01:08:24.051
[SPEAKER_06]: That is fucking ambitious right there.

01:08:24.151 --> 01:08:29.234
[SPEAKER_04]: And the ultimate kicker was they added, they had a singing part to it.

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:31.640
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the ultimate kicker.

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:35.622
[SPEAKER_04]: The ultimate breakdown was that you put singing into it.

01:08:35.962 --> 01:08:38.263
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like a big deal.

01:08:38.963 --> 01:08:40.664
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially with the popularity of karaoke games.

01:08:41.364 --> 01:08:43.665
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Loki, sing it.

01:08:44.185 --> 01:08:45.385
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode number 228.

01:08:45.846 --> 01:08:48.267
[SPEAKER_06]: A story that definitely stuck out for us in episode 228.

01:08:48.787 --> 01:08:54.449
[SPEAKER_06]: A woman who played on the game World of Warcraft posted an ad on Craigslist offering sex...

01:08:55.433 --> 01:08:57.816
[SPEAKER_06]: to get the gold to buy her epic mount.

01:09:14.122 --> 01:09:17.024
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be curious what that woman's up to now.

01:09:17.304 --> 01:09:18.544
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, did she do it again?

01:09:18.604 --> 01:09:19.985
[SPEAKER_04]: I got on top of that, actually.

01:09:20.425 --> 01:09:21.706
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've never talked about it.

01:09:21.926 --> 01:09:24.047
[SPEAKER_04]: How about once, I mean, but it probably has happened.

01:09:24.568 --> 01:09:28.650
[SPEAKER_04]: An Australian lady met a young teenager online through WoW.

01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:32.652
[SPEAKER_04]: Paid her way to Content America to visit him.

01:09:34.033 --> 01:09:35.093
[SPEAKER_06]: I do remember hearing about this.

01:09:35.133 --> 01:09:37.734
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we might have covered this on the show, but yeah, it's similar.

01:09:37.774 --> 01:09:39.575
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a similar story in some ways.

01:09:40.256 --> 01:09:42.437
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy what some people get into on WoW.

01:09:43.211 --> 01:09:47.374
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, I gotta say, as a World of Warcraft player, those epic mounts really are a bitch to get.

01:09:47.434 --> 01:09:49.715
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I almost am ready to put out to get one.

01:09:50.255 --> 01:09:52.597
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why I don't touch that game.

01:09:53.137 --> 01:09:53.718
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really, though.

01:09:53.738 --> 01:09:54.238
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding.

01:09:54.578 --> 01:09:58.561
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, and then episode 229 was the last episode we taped in April.

01:09:59.041 --> 01:10:05.165
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually must have been a slow news week, because the top story I pulled from that one is that the PlayStation Eye was officially announced.

01:10:05.585 --> 01:10:10.528
[SPEAKER_06]: But actually, I think the reason why this is relevant is because obviously, you know, a lot of us are kind of wondering, you know,

01:10:11.534 --> 01:10:18.319
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony showed this off at E3 and it disappeared for the longest time.

01:10:18.359 --> 01:10:23.563
[SPEAKER_06]: We never heard anything about the Eye of Judgment and then suddenly out of nowhere, bam, here it is, the PlayStation Eyes coming out.

01:10:23.823 --> 01:10:26.005
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this might have been the episode where Loki made the bet.

01:10:26.065 --> 01:10:26.625
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

01:10:26.826 --> 01:10:27.626
[SPEAKER_06]: It might have been over the summer.

01:10:28.066 --> 01:10:29.708
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was later.

01:10:29.908 --> 01:10:32.770
[SPEAKER_06]: But regardless, the PlayStation Eye was officially announced in episode 229.

01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:33.130
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like...

01:10:36.036 --> 01:10:38.944
[SPEAKER_04]: It just, it seemed like the news was pretty slow.

01:10:39.004 --> 01:10:44.499
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, I'm trying to remember when I debuted because I think I did, I think I was working on that one.

01:10:44.519 --> 01:10:44.920
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like...

01:10:45.529 --> 01:10:51.831
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of those four stories, Sonic and Mario team up, Rock Band announced, a woman in World of Warcraft puts out for her mount, and the PlayStation Eye officially announced.

01:10:51.911 --> 01:10:54.492
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think had the biggest impact in gaming from April?

01:10:54.512 --> 01:10:54.552
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh...

01:11:07.737 --> 01:11:21.732
[SPEAKER_04]: I would probably have to say at first I was thinking about Mario and Sonic thing but to be honest I think the World of Warcraft thing just be on the grounds of it involves sex for fake money.

01:11:23.266 --> 01:11:24.708
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:11:38.436 --> 01:11:44.017
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than what happened later on in the years that made it worse and brought everything back ahead again.

01:11:44.498 --> 01:11:53.340
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the reason why that is important to gaming in general in 2007, because I think 99.9% of people looked at that story and went, I don't want that to be me, ever.

01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:57.681
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, even the most hardcore gamers were like, I do not want that to be me, ever.

01:11:57.801 --> 01:11:58.181
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

01:11:58.201 --> 01:12:01.002
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a way to keep us in check.

01:12:01.122 --> 01:12:02.022
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the kicker, though.

01:12:02.042 --> 01:12:02.382
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:12:03.138 --> 01:12:12.701
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to bring politics into this, but I don't know if y'all heard, but apparently a presidential candidate done scheduled a parade in WoW.

01:12:14.502 --> 01:12:15.782
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, this is recent?

01:12:16.802 --> 01:12:17.743
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is recent.

01:12:18.063 --> 01:12:18.743
[SPEAKER_04]: Ron Paul.

01:12:19.463 --> 01:12:20.363
[SPEAKER_06]: Riffing.

01:12:21.044 --> 01:12:21.684
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

01:12:22.344 --> 01:12:25.005
[SPEAKER_04]: Ron Paul, apparently he got some people to...

01:12:25.612 --> 01:12:44.911
[SPEAKER_04]: or somebody might set it up, I don't know apparently he got, they're gonna do like a little um, campaigning parade on WoW I forgot what, things from Ironforge to some area and what not and I was like, wow they definitely they definitely having the goal to go for this one I remember jokingly said um

01:12:45.854 --> 01:12:48.155
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, if this pulls off, they're going to win the nerd vote.

01:12:48.615 --> 01:12:48.935
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

01:12:49.055 --> 01:12:51.036
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

01:12:51.056 --> 01:12:51.996
[SPEAKER_06]: 2008 is going to be a hell of a year.

01:12:52.056 --> 01:12:56.697
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, this is about as cool as Dr. Evil in Austin Powers.

01:12:57.057 --> 01:12:57.418
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hip.

01:12:57.558 --> 01:12:58.018
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm cool.

01:12:58.158 --> 01:12:58.338
[SPEAKER_02]: See?

01:12:58.358 --> 01:12:58.498
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw.

01:13:03.311 --> 01:13:05.132
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:13:20.098 --> 01:13:22.381
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, somebody like, you know, Hillary Clinton.

01:13:22.561 --> 01:13:24.023
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, she's a big presidential candidate.

01:13:24.063 --> 01:13:26.165
[SPEAKER_06]: She's pissed a lot of people off with her stance.

01:13:26.205 --> 01:13:28.207
[SPEAKER_06]: And she kind of, remember, she backtracked.

01:13:28.267 --> 01:13:30.590
[SPEAKER_06]: Like earlier in the year, she was kind of more anti-video game.

01:13:30.610 --> 01:13:36.276
[SPEAKER_06]: And then she kind of came out and supported the ESRB a little later and said, you know, we've done a lot of work and da-da-da.

01:13:36.356 --> 01:13:37.577
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very interesting.

01:13:37.637 --> 01:13:38.638
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when Manhunt 2 happened, she went back.

01:13:38.658 --> 01:13:40.080
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't say anything for your vote.

01:13:43.038 --> 01:13:46.600
[SPEAKER_06]: All I can say is 2008 is going to be a hell of a year with the election going on and everything.

01:13:47.881 --> 01:13:49.222
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Knight, let's hear it.

01:13:49.302 --> 01:13:51.963
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think, in your opinion, was the worst game of 2007?

01:13:52.043 --> 01:13:55.826
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to agree with Raven's Dolphin and it was Yars.

01:13:56.806 --> 01:13:58.567
[SPEAKER_04]: I played it once and never touched it again.

01:13:58.587 --> 01:14:03.450
[SPEAKER_04]: I basically gave it the what the hell was I smoking when I played this game award.

01:14:04.891 --> 01:14:10.255
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in your opinion, what was the hands down, above all, best freaking game of 2007?

01:14:12.115 --> 01:14:21.101
[SPEAKER_04]: So many games, but I had to go with Call of Duty 4 because the game could basically be turned into a movie by itself.

01:14:21.461 --> 01:14:24.383
[SPEAKER_04]: You wouldn't need no actors or anything like that.

01:14:24.823 --> 01:14:28.826
[SPEAKER_04]: Just put the game in, let it run its course, it's the Oscar hit.

01:14:28.986 --> 01:14:32.348
[SPEAKER_06]: I think as I've heard somebody describe Call of Duty 4, it's just fucking epic.

01:14:33.449 --> 01:14:33.809
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

01:14:33.989 --> 01:14:34.870
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just fucking epic.

01:14:36.271 --> 01:14:39.593
[SPEAKER_04]: Best person to ask about that, talk to Travis.

01:14:40.333 --> 01:14:40.714
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a veteran.

01:14:42.428 --> 01:14:43.028
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a veteran.

01:14:43.388 --> 01:14:43.889
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll tell you.

01:15:08.212 --> 01:15:09.212
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I was there.

01:15:09.232 --> 01:15:12.493
[SPEAKER_04]: Trust me, I was part of that shenanigans, that episode.

01:15:13.513 --> 01:15:14.053
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of fun.

01:15:14.213 --> 01:15:14.653
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

01:15:15.054 --> 01:15:17.814
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Dark Knight, we got to let you go, but thanks so much for participating tonight.

01:15:17.934 --> 01:15:19.274
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a great 2008, all right?

01:15:19.795 --> 01:15:20.535
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for having me on.

01:15:20.555 --> 01:15:21.395
[SPEAKER_04]: Y'all guys do the same.

01:15:21.415 --> 01:15:21.855
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

01:15:21.995 --> 01:15:22.435
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, buddy.

01:15:23.175 --> 01:15:23.355
Bye.

01:15:24.196 --> 01:15:24.596
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:15:24.856 --> 01:15:25.636
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Knight there.

01:15:25.896 --> 01:15:27.456
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if we get somebody else to join us.

01:15:27.516 --> 01:15:30.117
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk about, we're going to do May and June.

01:15:30.137 --> 01:15:33.918
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's a little different from what we have there, but since we're giving everybody two months, we'll go ahead and do May and June.

01:15:33.938 --> 01:15:34.818
[SPEAKER_06]: We got somebody on the line.

01:15:34.858 --> 01:15:35.398
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, who's there?

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:37.821
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, it's Xenocore from the Ultimate Quest.

01:15:37.841 --> 01:15:38.201
[SPEAKER_03]: How you guys doing?

01:15:38.221 --> 01:15:39.402
[SPEAKER_03]: What is up, Xenocore?

01:15:39.422 --> 01:15:40.042
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing?

01:15:40.982 --> 01:15:42.883
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still alive, you know, paying bills and such.

01:15:43.243 --> 01:15:43.944
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your holiday?

01:15:43.984 --> 01:15:44.224
[SPEAKER_06]: Good?

01:15:45.184 --> 01:15:45.905
[SPEAKER_03]: I got two shirts.

01:15:47.205 --> 01:15:48.266
[SPEAKER_06]: I got clothes, too.

01:15:49.166 --> 01:15:50.127
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, man.

01:15:50.187 --> 01:15:50.827
[SPEAKER_06]: Clothing is good.

01:15:50.987 --> 01:15:51.427
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

01:15:51.447 --> 01:15:53.068
[SPEAKER_06]: It keeps you warm during these cold months.

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:56.110
[SPEAKER_01]: Christmas is intended to give you underwear and socks.

01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:58.731
[SPEAKER_06]: How are things over at the Ultimate Quest?

01:15:59.011 --> 01:16:00.512
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you guys doing your own year-end wrap-up?

01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:03.561
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we pretty much finished our shows for the year.

01:16:03.601 --> 01:16:07.223
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going on hiatus for the new year, so I can get inebriated at least.

01:16:09.265 --> 01:16:11.226
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll be picking up next year, I think.

01:16:12.509 --> 01:16:14.410
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:16:37.479 --> 01:16:38.219
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

01:16:59.588 --> 01:17:00.629
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's pretty cool.

01:17:00.669 --> 01:17:02.269
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be sure to pass that message along.

01:17:02.389 --> 01:17:15.175
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought Footy would get a kick out of that, because sometimes, you know, Argentina is a huge fucking country, but it doesn't get mentioned enough, usually, and, you know, because the gaming scene just isn't what it is here or there, you know what I mean?

01:17:16.075 --> 01:17:20.037
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very different, as he lets us know very much so on the show.

01:17:20.437 --> 01:17:22.378
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, enough about people who aren't here.

01:17:22.478 --> 01:17:28.341
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about the year in review, and talk a little bit about, did you kill the fly, Loki?

01:17:29.361 --> 01:17:30.202
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another one, though.

01:17:59.986 --> 01:18:01.307
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, man, mutton's good for you.

01:18:01.527 --> 01:18:08.472
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh, and PETA, understandably, was pissed off about that, and the rest of us were wondering, what the F were they thinking?

01:18:09.493 --> 01:18:16.778
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they actually killed the goat live, but they had the dead goat, like, everywhere, and it was just kind of like, what the crap were you people thinking?

01:18:18.919 --> 01:18:20.340
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was pretty humorous.

01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:23.542
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, didn't he at least make mutton or stew out of it or anything?

01:18:23.562 --> 01:18:25.824
[SPEAKER_03]: He just had a dead carcass right there, smelling of the place?

01:18:26.104 --> 01:18:26.684
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:18:27.385 --> 01:18:27.665
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

01:18:28.446 --> 01:18:30.148
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, FootyMonster's actually in chat.

01:18:30.188 --> 01:18:33.332
[SPEAKER_06]: He just said something about Guido.

01:18:33.352 --> 01:18:33.812
[SPEAKER_06]: That's funny.

01:18:35.254 --> 01:18:35.774
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, sorry.

01:18:35.954 --> 01:18:36.575
[SPEAKER_06]: I got distracted.

01:18:36.655 --> 01:18:37.356
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, episode number 231.

01:18:37.576 --> 01:18:40.099
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you'd like this as a roleplay fan.

01:18:40.912 --> 01:18:47.794
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the stories that stuck out from episode 231, Final Fantasy 4 was announced that it was going to be remade for the DS.

01:18:48.094 --> 01:18:57.716
[SPEAKER_06]: This is much different from what Squeenix had been doing with the past Final Fantasy games and releasing them, but they were going to remake all of Final Fantasy 4 similar to how they did with Final Fantasy 3.

01:18:58.756 --> 01:19:00.497
[SPEAKER_06]: And now the game is out in Japan.

01:19:00.537 --> 01:19:07.338
[SPEAKER_06]: We're still waiting for it here in the U.S., but certainly had people thinking different ways about that.

01:19:07.378 --> 01:19:09.499
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think about the Final Fantasy 4 remake on the DS?

01:19:10.729 --> 01:19:15.552
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all for the remakes when they switch to another console that wasn't on previously.

01:19:15.572 --> 01:19:18.694
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just going to print more money once it gets released over there.

01:19:19.181 --> 01:19:20.022
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

01:19:42.798 --> 01:19:46.041
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'm just like, please, please, Square Enix, do not fuck this up.

01:19:46.081 --> 01:19:50.164
[SPEAKER_06]: But then when I saw the screen caps and the previews, I'm like, wow, this actually looks pretty awesome.

01:19:51.045 --> 01:19:51.445
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

01:19:51.685 --> 01:19:53.046
[SPEAKER_06]: Kane's Dragoon jump for the win.

01:19:53.306 --> 01:19:56.209
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, looking for... Ooh, it's going to be great.

01:19:56.229 --> 01:20:00.452
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode 232, big week for PC gamers because that was the week that StarCraft II was announced.

01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:05.124
[SPEAKER_06]: and Blizzard reviving one of their franchises that had been a little bit dormant.

01:20:05.304 --> 01:20:13.652
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, obviously we had the rumors of StarCraft Ghost years ago and everybody kind of thought, you know, this had to come eventually and finally it arrived in May, the announcement of StarCraft 2.

01:20:15.974 --> 01:20:20.458
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode 233 was the one we taped live at Fanime and that was the week

01:20:21.918 --> 01:20:22.979
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Smash Bros.

01:20:23.079 --> 01:20:23.460
[SPEAKER_06]: Brawl

01:20:50.467 --> 01:20:53.989
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a rough one, because it is getting quite a lot of hype.

01:20:55.010 --> 01:21:01.394
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever I start seeing games advertised this much, I just expect it to fall short a certain degree.

01:21:01.454 --> 01:21:06.998
[SPEAKER_03]: Just from process of elimination over the years, whenever a game gets hyped up, it always falls short one or two spots.

01:21:07.899 --> 01:21:10.660
[SPEAKER_03]: If it does, I'm going to be surprised, but if it does not, then all the better.

01:21:11.961 --> 01:21:19.066
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if it is true what Loki said earlier, and it does turn to be true that the game gets delayed another month, it's going to have to be that much better.

01:21:19.895 --> 01:21:21.076
[SPEAKER_06]: to make it worth the wait.

01:21:21.536 --> 01:21:25.558
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a first-party game, so it's not going to get released when it's complete crap.

01:21:25.598 --> 01:21:26.118
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way.

01:21:26.238 --> 01:21:26.838
[SPEAKER_03]: True, true.

01:21:27.199 --> 01:21:34.282
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, okay, out of those stories, PETA and the God of War Go, Final Fantasy IV Remake, StarCraft II announced, and Super Smash Bros.

01:21:34.322 --> 01:21:37.564
[SPEAKER_06]: Revealed, what do you think was the story that had the biggest impact in gaming?

01:21:37.664 --> 01:21:40.045
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if you have something else you want to throw in there, go for it.

01:21:40.785 --> 01:21:50.337
[SPEAKER_03]: No, mainly I'd go with the story with the Guard of War carcass just because it spills over to mainstream media when you see stuff like that and it brings attention to the gaming world.

01:21:50.497 --> 01:21:51.738
[SPEAKER_03]: And not the good kind of attention.

01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:54.782
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's definitely bad attention.

01:21:55.363 --> 01:21:56.344
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to agree with you there.

01:21:56.384 --> 01:21:57.786
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably what I would pick too.

01:21:58.450 --> 01:21:59.451
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely would pick that one.

01:21:59.771 --> 01:22:00.932
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, let's move on to June.

01:22:00.972 --> 01:22:02.533
[SPEAKER_06]: We only taped three shows in June.

01:22:02.553 --> 01:22:03.254
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what happened.

01:22:03.274 --> 01:22:04.475
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we fell asleep.

01:22:04.855 --> 01:22:06.417
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe another Disneyland trip happened in there.

01:22:06.437 --> 01:22:06.877
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

01:22:06.897 --> 01:22:07.598
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a Disneyland trip.

01:22:07.618 --> 01:22:07.958
[SPEAKER_06]: Was there?

01:22:08.038 --> 01:22:09.799
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, there were three shows taped in June.

01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:15.944
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode 234, that was the week, I love this, that was the week that Ubisoft apologized for making crappy Wii games.

01:22:16.525 --> 01:22:17.426
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember that one?

01:22:17.726 --> 01:22:20.768
[SPEAKER_06]: That they said, you know what, maybe we shouldn't have done so many ports.

01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:26.393
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to have a game company, even though, you know, obviously, this was

01:22:26.752 --> 01:22:26.852
[SPEAKER_06]: 3Speak

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:53.501
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally, that was launched in June of 2007.

01:22:54.041 --> 01:22:56.763
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously, Sony had been kind of trying to catch up.

01:22:57.503 --> 01:23:01.105
[SPEAKER_06]: You might remember from the year before, All I Want for Xmas is a PSP.com.

01:23:01.925 --> 01:23:02.626
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I remember that one.

01:23:02.646 --> 01:23:04.186
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't go so well that time.

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:09.409
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, most people were saying, you know what, Sony really needs like a Major Nelson.

01:23:09.449 --> 01:23:13.872
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Nintendo has their poster kids with Miyamoto and Reggie Fils-Aimé.

01:23:14.172 --> 01:23:19.034
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Microsoft has, you know, Major Nelson and Trixie and people that are out there in the community.

01:23:19.434 --> 01:23:20.175
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony's got...

01:23:20.928 --> 01:23:22.469
[SPEAKER_06]: Crazy Crayon Eatin' Ken.

01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:26.630
[SPEAKER_01]: If they hired me, I bet you I could sell PS3s.

01:23:27.311 --> 01:23:28.471
[SPEAKER_06]: How would you sell a PlayStation 3?

01:23:28.971 --> 01:23:31.852
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I'd restore it to its original format.

01:23:32.793 --> 01:23:36.414
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would have it with all of the goody stuff and a 40 gig hard drive.

01:23:37.074 --> 01:23:39.715
[SPEAKER_01]: It would not have even had the option of having more.

01:23:39.735 --> 01:23:40.356
[SPEAKER_06]: How would you sell it?

01:23:40.376 --> 01:23:41.436
[SPEAKER_06]: What would that commercial look like?

01:23:41.736 --> 01:23:42.316
[SPEAKER_01]: With boobs.

01:23:43.637 --> 01:23:45.658
[SPEAKER_06]: Just women jumping on trampolines?

01:23:46.298 --> 01:23:47.718
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what it would be?

01:23:48.099 --> 01:23:48.779
[SPEAKER_01]: It is going to have...

01:23:49.412 --> 01:23:52.634
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you can have graphics this realistic on your PlayStation 3.

01:23:53.614 --> 01:23:54.014
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.

01:23:54.475 --> 01:23:56.896
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that is a brilliant idea for a commercial.

01:23:57.536 --> 01:24:05.540
[SPEAKER_06]: Just all the commercial is is 30 seconds of boobs on trampolines, and then in the very last second, it says, generated by PlayStation 3.

01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:07.821
[SPEAKER_06]: This is all real footage.

01:24:07.841 --> 01:24:09.682
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like Jamie should be working for Spike TV.

01:24:10.943 --> 01:24:12.103
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps she should.

01:24:13.424 --> 01:24:17.866
[SPEAKER_01]: Or have like a show like Barbecue.

01:24:19.042 --> 01:24:22.005
[SPEAKER_01]: Because nothing will sell a game like boobs and barbecue.

01:24:23.907 --> 01:24:27.511
[SPEAKER_06]: Macman says in the chatroom, Jamie would just tape a ferret to every PlayStation 3.

01:24:27.551 --> 01:24:30.094
[SPEAKER_01]: Free ferret with every game.

01:24:30.154 --> 01:24:33.637
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dark Knight wants to remember, how did that crayon-eating bit even start?

01:24:33.878 --> 01:24:34.198
[SPEAKER_01]: Megsie.

01:24:35.031 --> 01:24:35.592
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

01:24:35.732 --> 01:24:37.974
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the OR lesbians started the Crayote thing.

01:24:37.994 --> 01:24:38.814
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

01:24:38.874 --> 01:24:40.596
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Crayola, Star Tetsuya says.

01:24:40.936 --> 01:24:41.156
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:24:41.176 --> 01:24:45.680
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anyhow, out of those three stories, or if you have one of your own, Xenocore, Ubisoft apologizes.

01:24:45.741 --> 01:24:46.882
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony launches their own blog.

01:24:46.902 --> 01:24:47.242
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry.

01:24:47.262 --> 01:24:48.443
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even read the third one.

01:24:48.843 --> 01:24:53.928
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode 236 was the week that Manhunt 2 officially got the AO rating.

01:24:54.408 --> 01:24:57.371
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, this just began weeks upon weeks of

01:24:58.322 --> 01:24:59.403
[SPEAKER_06]: ManHunt2 ManHunt2

01:25:15.962 --> 01:25:20.948
[SPEAKER_06]: So out of those three stories, Ubisoft apologizing, Sony launching their official blog, and Manhunt 2 getting the ratings.

01:25:21.008 --> 01:25:21.809
[SPEAKER_06]: Unicor, what do you think?

01:25:22.109 --> 01:25:23.050
[SPEAKER_06]: Biggest impact?

01:25:23.131 --> 01:25:24.672
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to be the Manhunt 2 story.

01:25:25.073 --> 01:25:27.576
[SPEAKER_03]: That went all across the globe on that one.

01:25:27.676 --> 01:25:29.058
[SPEAKER_06]: Hands down, absolutely.

01:25:29.662 --> 01:25:31.444
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:25:53.703 --> 01:26:01.668
[SPEAKER_06]: You can use pee as a... I don't... I always think... I think back to when I watched Survivor years ago and there was the guy... For snake bites.

01:26:01.748 --> 01:26:06.331
[SPEAKER_06]: There was the guy going, the stingray just bit me, I need someone to pee on it.

01:26:06.391 --> 01:26:10.774
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this lady goes over, squats on him and pees on it, and sure enough, disinfects it.

01:26:10.814 --> 01:26:16.237
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really better with your own pee because it breaks down the proteins in the toxin.

01:26:16.477 --> 01:26:18.979
[SPEAKER_06]: I just remember the guy saying, I need someone to pee on it!

01:26:19.359 --> 01:26:21.320
[SPEAKER_01]: Meat tenderizer works too for the same thing.

01:26:22.061 --> 01:26:22.321
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow...

01:26:23.428 --> 01:26:25.211
[SPEAKER_06]: Xenocore, what was the worst freaking game of 2007?

01:26:39.369 --> 01:26:41.671
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's too easy of a target.

01:26:41.711 --> 01:26:44.353
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to think of something else, but nothing comes to mind.

01:26:44.573 --> 01:26:45.474
[SPEAKER_03]: Yaris needs to go.

01:26:46.074 --> 01:26:49.877
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoever developed it needs to have their names published so they can't get another job in the aiming industry.

01:26:49.897 --> 01:26:51.078
[SPEAKER_03]: It's as simple as that.

01:26:51.378 --> 01:26:53.139
[SPEAKER_06]: Three out of three have named Yaris.

01:26:53.259 --> 01:26:55.241
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a pick, and it's not Yaris.

01:26:56.141 --> 01:26:57.963
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I can't think of another one.

01:26:57.983 --> 01:26:58.924
[SPEAKER_06]: There's another one out there.

01:26:58.964 --> 01:27:05.548
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually going to tell you, the last issue of Xbox Magazine was listing Yaris as a piece of crap.

01:27:06.369 --> 01:27:08.210
[SPEAKER_06]: The official Xbox Magazine, even.

01:27:08.291 --> 01:27:08.811
[SPEAKER_06]: How sad.

01:27:09.244 --> 01:27:09.704
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that?

01:27:09.965 --> 01:27:11.686
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, let's get to the good stuff, Xenocore.

01:27:11.706 --> 01:27:14.308
[SPEAKER_06]: In your opinion, the best freaking game of 2007.

01:27:14.508 --> 01:27:19.032
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll probably get more hate mail for that, but it gives me more to read on the show.

01:27:19.472 --> 01:27:22.895
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've got to say Portal is the best game of the year.

01:27:24.856 --> 01:27:25.597
[SPEAKER_06]: Why Portal?

01:27:25.697 --> 01:27:28.799
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised that I was waiting to write Persona 3.

01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:32.842
[SPEAKER_06]: As an RPG player, I would have thought that was going to be your pick, but why Portal?

01:27:33.603 --> 01:27:35.484
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's the most innovative title.

01:27:35.504 --> 01:27:35.665
[SPEAKER_03]: Period.

01:27:35.765 --> 01:27:36.245
[SPEAKER_03]: Period.

01:27:36.781 --> 01:27:39.483
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody else is doing something that's been done before.

01:27:39.763 --> 01:27:43.826
[SPEAKER_03]: As good as Super Mario Galaxy is, Ratchet and Clank beat them to the market with it.

01:27:43.926 --> 01:27:46.007
[SPEAKER_03]: Rather or not, they've developed it already.

01:27:46.787 --> 01:27:48.749
[SPEAKER_03]: Bioshock was a big disappointment for me.

01:27:48.829 --> 01:27:50.830
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good in the beginning, but it sucked at the end.

01:27:51.090 --> 01:27:52.391
[SPEAKER_03]: In hindsight, it's like, what?

01:27:53.011 --> 01:27:53.772
[SPEAKER_03]: What's all this stuff?

01:27:54.332 --> 01:27:55.513
[SPEAKER_03]: I threw Bioshock to the side.

01:27:56.093 --> 01:27:58.335
[SPEAKER_03]: The others just didn't make a big of an impact as Portal.

01:27:58.415 --> 01:27:59.996
[SPEAKER_03]: I can still go back and play Portal now.

01:28:00.373 --> 01:28:01.573
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Portal gets the win.

01:28:01.734 --> 01:28:02.554
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know, Xenocore.

01:28:02.574 --> 01:28:04.695
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be recapping our picks later in the show.

01:28:04.755 --> 01:28:08.796
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll bet you at least one of the three of us agrees with you that Portal was the best game of 2007.

01:28:10.357 --> 01:28:11.457
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll find out for sure.

01:28:11.497 --> 01:28:11.837
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know.

01:28:11.917 --> 01:28:13.598
[SPEAKER_06]: Surprises, there are many.

01:28:13.978 --> 01:28:15.138
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we'll get to that a little later in the show.

01:28:15.158 --> 01:28:17.959
[SPEAKER_06]: But, Xenocore, thank you so much for joining us.

01:28:18.019 --> 01:28:20.040
[SPEAKER_06]: And we always have appreciated your calls throughout 2007.

01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:23.701
[SPEAKER_06]: Best of luck to you and the whole crew at the Ultimate Quest for 2008, all right?

01:28:24.642 --> 01:28:25.062
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.

01:28:25.102 --> 01:28:25.662
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks a lot, guys.

01:28:25.722 --> 01:28:26.002
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:28:26.062 --> 01:28:26.522
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, buddy.

01:28:27.263 --> 01:28:27.563
Bye-bye.

01:28:27.883 --> 01:28:28.143
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

01:28:28.666 --> 01:28:29.187
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

01:28:52.537 --> 01:28:56.421
[SPEAKER_06]: Classic Game of the Year Classic Game of the Year Classic Game of the Year

01:29:14.079 --> 01:29:15.319
[SPEAKER_06]: and let's hear it.

01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:18.921
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the year?

01:29:19.061 --> 01:29:23.982
[SPEAKER_01]: The classic game of the year is one of the best games ever in the universe.

01:29:25.002 --> 01:29:35.126
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Parodius da Shinwakara Owariye, which translates to Parodius from Myth to Laughter.

01:29:36.206 --> 01:29:39.587
[SPEAKER_01]: And the version that I have for our music is

01:29:40.387 --> 01:29:45.091
[SPEAKER_01]: is the PC Engine release of it.

01:29:45.471 --> 01:29:52.777
[SPEAKER_01]: Because honestly, and I've played through the Super Famicom one, it lags so badly.

01:29:53.377 --> 01:29:57.040
[SPEAKER_01]: It has bad flicker and slowdown because it's a lot of stuff to process.

01:29:58.341 --> 01:29:59.762
[SPEAKER_01]: The PC Engine did it better.

01:29:59.922 --> 01:30:05.767
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is, as you can probably tell from the name, Parodius is a parody of Gradius.

01:30:07.141 --> 01:30:08.882
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually is the second one in the series.

01:30:08.922 --> 01:30:13.804
[SPEAKER_01]: The first Parodius came out on the MSX system.

01:30:14.324 --> 01:30:20.027
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this one you get to play, you've actually got your different power-up abilities based on what character you pick.

01:30:20.367 --> 01:30:22.388
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play the Vic Viper from Gradius.

01:30:22.932 --> 01:30:23.953
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play an octopus.

01:30:24.233 --> 01:30:25.974
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play a twin bee.

01:30:26.274 --> 01:30:27.995
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the one where you fight the stripper.

01:30:28.895 --> 01:30:30.916
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the Vegas showgirl or whatever she is.

01:30:31.116 --> 01:30:31.757
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.

01:30:31.797 --> 01:30:32.477
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember this one.

01:30:32.977 --> 01:30:34.178
[SPEAKER_01]: By going in between her legs.

01:30:36.179 --> 01:30:38.100
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, why did Proteus never come out in the U.S.?

01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:39.240
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out in Europe.

01:30:40.301 --> 01:30:41.161
[SPEAKER_06]: But why never here?

01:30:41.241 --> 01:30:45.023
[SPEAKER_01]: Were we just not, I mean, the showgirl thing we just wanted to get?

01:30:45.103 --> 01:30:45.964
[SPEAKER_01]: Too far up their ass.

01:30:47.395 --> 01:30:52.877
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, I mean, and for those of you that may be kind of looking at Jamie right now going, what the heck, why are you picking this type thing?

01:30:53.218 --> 01:30:55.759
[SPEAKER_06]: You really do have to imagine that this game is Gradius on crack.

01:30:56.299 --> 01:30:56.559
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

01:30:56.719 --> 01:31:02.342
[SPEAKER_06]: And what makes this game so freaking epic is just the fact that I think it was mostly ignored here in the U.S.

01:31:02.382 --> 01:31:03.702
[SPEAKER_01]: But you had the Moai stage.

01:31:04.843 --> 01:31:07.564
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, Konami games have to have the Moai head in there.

01:31:07.764 --> 01:31:08.244
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

01:31:08.264 --> 01:31:11.966
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way that the power-ups worked, I thought it was cool.

01:31:11.986 --> 01:31:14.447
[SPEAKER_01]: The Vic Viper is the old-school Gradius config.

01:31:14.867 --> 01:31:16.968
[SPEAKER_01]: The Octopus is the Salamander configuration.

01:31:18.413 --> 01:31:22.776
[SPEAKER_01]: Twinbee is the Twinbee configuration, even with the rocket with the punching fists.

01:31:23.997 --> 01:31:27.019
[SPEAKER_01]: And Pentaro is Gradius III.

01:31:27.559 --> 01:31:30.881
[SPEAKER_01]: I always would play as Twinbee because I love the rocket fists, but...

01:31:31.725 --> 01:31:36.350
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also really cool, and the one that we're watching is actually the big viper playing through, because you get the option and double and all that.

01:31:36.430 --> 01:31:37.971
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let's just like Radius 2 when you play it that way.

01:31:38.371 --> 01:31:43.276
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, the thing that, my favorite weapon in the whole thing... Maybe this is a reason why it didn't come out in the US.

01:31:43.296 --> 01:31:44.157
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the eagle?

01:31:44.277 --> 01:31:52.364
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed that the boss monster that's being fought right now is an American eagle, wearing a Yankee hat and a little bow tie, and just exploded.

01:31:53.165 --> 01:31:57.309
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, um, a little bit more, um, is that, uh,

01:31:58.363 --> 01:32:02.067
[SPEAKER_01]: One of your power-ups in the game is a bell, and you keep shooting the bell.

01:32:02.868 --> 01:32:09.555
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you get a blue bell, it'll make your character grow big and anything it touches will be destroyed.

01:32:10.075 --> 01:32:14.960
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get a green one, it's a big flare and destroys everything on the screen, including most bosses.

01:32:16.502 --> 01:32:18.204
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually how you beat the naked lady.

01:32:20.042 --> 01:32:25.565
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the people that you fight is this woman wearing a sheet, and when you shoot her, she goes, oh, like that.

01:32:26.545 --> 01:32:28.806
[SPEAKER_01]: And she blows little angels at you in bubbles.

01:32:30.827 --> 01:32:33.388
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, here's a picture of her on the wiki.

01:32:33.628 --> 01:32:34.628
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get it in the chat room.

01:32:34.648 --> 01:32:35.429
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice, nice.

01:32:37.230 --> 01:32:43.072
[SPEAKER_01]: But she's really freaking hard to beat, so you usually have to have the mega flare by then, but they always give you a bell right before that stage.

01:32:44.293 --> 01:32:47.434
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite of those is the gray bell, which shouts words.

01:32:48.556 --> 01:32:52.218
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, the whole phrases, like, you know, I think one of them is the equivalent of, like, Eat It Joes.

01:32:52.938 --> 01:32:54.679
[SPEAKER_01]: And another one is E equals MC squared.

01:32:55.999 --> 01:33:01.241
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, now, this is actually not my favorite in the Parodius, um, series.

01:33:01.842 --> 01:33:06.404
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite is, um, Jikyo Shibari Parodius, which, um, you can play on Saturn.

01:33:06.864 --> 01:33:11.466
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the one that has, um, and for anyone who wants to know what it means, Chatting Parodius Live.

01:33:13.048 --> 01:33:22.673
[SPEAKER_01]: For anyone who wants to know it, it has the Miracle Oopa, it has the Penguins, Pentoro, and Hanako, Twinbee and Winbee, Viper and Lord British from Gradius.

01:33:25.154 --> 01:33:26.675
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to be confused with Richard Garriott.

01:33:26.855 --> 01:33:27.055
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

01:33:27.816 --> 01:33:30.077
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has some girls riding on a missile.

01:33:32.158 --> 01:33:39.442
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it has Aitsu and Koitsu, which for anyone who ever played Yu-Gi-Oh!, there's cards for them.

01:33:40.592 --> 01:33:44.714
[SPEAKER_01]: There are these little stickmen riding on paper airplanes.

01:33:45.455 --> 01:33:47.236
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just think that it's pretty cool.

01:33:47.276 --> 01:33:48.616
[SPEAKER_01]: It had so much stuff going on.

01:33:48.656 --> 01:33:55.460
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one in the series was there was Sexy Proteus and Pyro Wars.

01:33:56.240 --> 01:34:07.286
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also saw last night and if you can hear on the thing a lot of the levels remix Gradius music to start or Salamander music and then play classical music.

01:34:08.867 --> 01:34:09.007
[SPEAKER_01]: Like

01:34:10.541 --> 01:34:19.408
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, but, uh, last night I was looking at YouTube trying to find, you know, because we obviously play the sound off of YouTube that way.

01:34:20.209 --> 01:34:26.894
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I found the Proteus, um, uh, Pachinko machine videos.

01:34:27.215 --> 01:34:27.495
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

01:34:27.635 --> 01:34:34.280
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the, there's even like this little model show with, uh, the, uh, the bunny suit girls.

01:34:34.441 --> 01:34:37.283
[SPEAKER_01]: It's girls in bunny outfits riding on missiles.

01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:42.788
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the showgirl was one of them stomping through the city.

01:34:45.228 --> 01:34:46.328
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just really cool.

01:34:46.348 --> 01:34:50.770
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, so we at least still have the Proteus franchise still alive.

01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:52.271
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to see a new Proteus.

01:34:52.511 --> 01:34:52.991
[SPEAKER_01]: Really bad.

01:34:53.011 --> 01:34:54.131
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

01:34:54.332 --> 01:34:56.732
[SPEAKER_06]: Or some folks in chat are saying Proteus on Virtual Console.

01:34:57.133 --> 01:35:01.734
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially with the fact that we do know they will put games that were once Japanese only.

01:35:01.774 --> 01:35:02.855
[SPEAKER_06]: They have been releasing over here.

01:35:02.915 --> 01:35:03.915
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Mario Bros.

01:35:04.195 --> 01:35:05.076
[SPEAKER_06]: 2, the original.

01:35:05.136 --> 01:35:08.737
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like if they have a problem with the eagle one, then bring out Oshaberry Proteus.

01:35:08.797 --> 01:35:09.857
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it was in there.

01:35:09.917 --> 01:35:12.919
[SPEAKER_06]: I think everybody is smart enough to just get over it.

01:35:13.179 --> 01:35:13.819
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, really.

01:35:15.182 --> 01:35:15.682
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a big deal.

01:35:16.023 --> 01:35:21.327
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why I like Oshinori Parodius is that one of the bad guys in it is actually supposed to be one of the girls from Tokimeki Memorial.

01:35:22.608 --> 01:35:23.989
[SPEAKER_01]: The long-term dating sim.

01:35:24.469 --> 01:35:24.769
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

01:35:25.170 --> 01:35:25.430
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

01:35:25.710 --> 01:35:26.471
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there it is, folks.

01:35:26.491 --> 01:35:28.652
[SPEAKER_06]: Your classic game of the year.

01:35:29.453 --> 01:35:31.935
[SPEAKER_06]: Parodius Da, in this case, on the PC Engine.

01:35:32.015 --> 01:35:34.837
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, it's out there for multiple systems.

01:35:35.658 --> 01:35:36.858
[SPEAKER_06]: So, very good pick, Jamie.

01:35:36.878 --> 01:35:38.119
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:39.961
[SPEAKER_06]: This game always cracks me up every time I watch it.

01:35:39.981 --> 01:35:41.342
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Gradius is an awesome game.

01:35:41.362 --> 01:35:43.163
[SPEAKER_06]: And where was this game in the Gradius collection?

01:35:43.423 --> 01:35:44.144
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I would like to know.

01:35:44.426 --> 01:35:45.346
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, right?

01:35:45.547 --> 01:35:50.669
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there was another... I actually want to say that all of them have been released on Saturn.

01:35:51.429 --> 01:35:52.549
[SPEAKER_01]: Except for the MSX one.

01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:57.411
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, coming up in Part B on tonight's program, we're going to get into the mailbag.

01:35:57.532 --> 01:36:02.234
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get into the next six months of the year, from July to December, recapping the top stories.

01:36:02.714 --> 01:36:09.997
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to talk about release dates, or lack thereof, and our top five best and worst games of the year, as well as our predictions for 2008.

01:36:10.817 --> 01:36:12.798
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all coming up right after the break.

01:36:13.639 --> 01:36:18.623
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
