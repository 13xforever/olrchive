00:00.000 --> 00:20.040
Tonight, December 30th, 2007, on this special edition of Orange Lounge Radio, we take a

00:20.040 --> 00:28.400
look back at the headlines and games of 2007 with our favorite people, all of our listeners.

00:28.400 --> 00:35.320
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:35.320 --> 00:36.320
Radio.

00:36.320 --> 00:39.880
I should say welcome back because we weren't here last week thanks to the holidays.

00:39.880 --> 00:46.480
We are that video game program slash podcast slash live broadcast via Live 365 dedicated

00:46.480 --> 00:50.240
to all things video games, video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.

00:50.240 --> 00:51.240
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:51.240 --> 00:56.300
I'm here every week joined by my lovely co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

00:56.300 --> 00:57.300
is here.

00:57.300 --> 00:58.300
Hi.

00:58.300 --> 00:59.300
How are you?

00:59.300 --> 01:00.840
I have a sinus infection.

01:00.840 --> 01:02.640
Sorry to hear it.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.120
You were sick quite a bit this year.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.120
I'm sorry to hear.

01:05.120 --> 01:08.160
I wasn't like sick, sick not like when I had the plague.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.160
Right.

01:09.160 --> 01:11.000
However, this is exactly how the plague started.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Oh no.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.280
So, I hopped right on it and I have drugs that make me happy.

01:15.280 --> 01:16.720
Well, I hope you feel better.

01:16.720 --> 01:18.400
How was your week off?

01:18.400 --> 01:21.400
Well, I did absolutely nothing.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.400
That's good.

01:22.400 --> 01:27.480
I sat on my ass and did absolutely nothing and it was beautiful.

01:27.480 --> 01:29.000
Was Santa good to you?

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Santa was decent.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.200
Santa brought me, actually Santa Dan gave me a game that I sort of blinked and went

01:36.200 --> 01:39.120
WTF over, but I think I'm going to play it.

01:39.120 --> 01:40.120
What's that?

01:40.120 --> 01:41.120
You care to share?

01:41.120 --> 01:42.120
That was, what's it?

01:42.120 --> 01:43.120
Flash Focus.

01:43.120 --> 01:44.120
The vision training game.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.120
Yeah.

01:45.120 --> 01:48.360
So, I'm going to play it because clearly I need my vision trained.

01:48.360 --> 01:51.480
Well, I hope it works for you.

01:51.480 --> 01:59.080
Then I started and we, I gave him, what did I give him?

01:59.080 --> 02:00.720
I gave him Blade Runner.

02:00.720 --> 02:01.720
Cool.

02:01.720 --> 02:05.080
And I bought him Ratatouille on Blu-ray.

02:05.080 --> 02:08.720
For use on the Playstation 3 because that's your Blu-ray player too, right?

02:08.720 --> 02:09.720
Very cool.

02:09.720 --> 02:10.720
It's pretty.

02:10.720 --> 02:11.720
Alright.

02:11.720 --> 02:12.720
Pretty.

02:12.720 --> 02:13.720
Well, we'll hear more about your game in a week in just a minute.

02:13.720 --> 02:14.720
That's not a game.

02:14.720 --> 02:17.360
Well, I know, but we'll get the other games as well, right?

02:17.360 --> 02:21.320
Well, I got to introduce, he's sitting there waiting for me to say the one and only

02:21.320 --> 02:22.760
tech master, Loki.

02:22.760 --> 02:24.840
I'm not really waiting for you, but it's fine.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.280
How are you doing tonight, Loki?

02:26.280 --> 02:27.280
I'm doing fine.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.280
Alright.

02:28.280 --> 02:29.280
Good to hear.

02:29.280 --> 02:30.280
And how was your Christmas?

02:30.280 --> 02:31.280
Was Santa good to you?

02:31.280 --> 02:32.280
I was good to me.

02:32.280 --> 02:33.280
Were you?

02:33.280 --> 02:34.280
Yeah.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.280
Because I built a new computer.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.760
Oftentimes we buy ourselves the best gifts, right?

02:37.760 --> 02:38.760
Exactly.

02:38.760 --> 02:43.360
Because I buy everything for myself, I don't normally get anything from everyone else because

02:43.360 --> 02:49.960
they figure I've already bought it, which is usually the case, but I don't know.

02:49.960 --> 02:50.960
Alright.

02:50.960 --> 02:54.120
Well, tonight is going to be a little bit different because we're going to be doing

02:54.120 --> 02:55.760
the year in review.

02:55.760 --> 03:00.480
We're just kind of having a very informal, kind of a slow show tonight.

03:00.480 --> 03:04.280
I got to say, I noticed that our chat room is not quite as hopping as it usually is over

03:04.280 --> 03:07.700
at chat.orangelandrater.com, which has me a little worried because tonight's show is

03:07.700 --> 03:11.400
supposed to be all about the listeners interacting with us and everything, but I do see, obviously

03:11.400 --> 03:14.360
there are some people there chatting it up.

03:14.360 --> 03:20.780
Tiger Claw wants to know, he's in chat, chat.orangelandrater.com, wants to know if Loki has heard that Black

03:20.780 --> 03:22.500
Wolf bought the Eye of Judgment.

03:22.500 --> 03:23.500
Good for him.

03:23.500 --> 03:29.240
That's one more towards one million, which will never, ever, ever happen, ever.

03:29.240 --> 03:37.160
And I remember, just to reiterate from two weeks ago, it has to sell a million some day.

03:37.160 --> 03:38.160
Some day.

03:38.160 --> 03:42.080
So yes, the bet was actually extended from six months to one million copies ever, and

03:42.080 --> 03:45.440
then Loki will don the tingle suit and set fire to an Eye of Judgment.

03:45.440 --> 03:46.440
Whenever that happens.

03:46.440 --> 03:51.120
Which apparently he knows about because he actually mentioned on the show something about

03:51.120 --> 03:54.080
Loki being one step closer to wearing the tingle suit.

03:54.080 --> 03:57.920
So that kind of takes the fun out of it, but whatever, maybe he's waiting to YouTube it.

03:57.920 --> 03:58.920
I don't know.

03:58.920 --> 04:01.560
So I think Bobby's doing his own year-end show tonight.

04:01.560 --> 04:02.560
It's probably still going.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.820
That's probably where some of our listeners are, who knows?

04:04.820 --> 04:08.460
But meanwhile, we actually are going to continue on doing the things we usually do.

04:08.460 --> 04:14.680
We weren't here last week because of the holidays, so Merry Christmas, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, Solstice,

04:14.680 --> 04:16.640
Ramadan, whatever the hell it is you celebrate.

04:16.640 --> 04:17.640
I hope it was good.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.640
Or nothing at all, if you're atheist, right?

04:19.640 --> 04:20.640
I hope it was good.

04:20.640 --> 04:21.640
Whatever you did.

04:21.640 --> 04:22.640
Ramadan is not until later in the year.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.360
Oh, what am I mixing it up with?

04:24.360 --> 04:25.360
Oh well.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.360
Who knows?

04:26.360 --> 04:27.360
Who cares?

04:27.360 --> 04:28.360
Somebody cares.

04:28.360 --> 04:29.360
Festivus.

04:29.360 --> 04:30.360
Maybe it's Festivus.

04:30.360 --> 04:31.360
Because they're so similar.

04:31.360 --> 04:34.080
I'm just trying to be PC and not leave anybody out.

04:34.080 --> 04:35.080
So there you have it.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.200
Whatever it is you celebrate, I hope it was good.

04:37.200 --> 04:40.480
Let's talk about our gaming weeks, because we do talk about that, or I guess I should

04:40.480 --> 04:42.040
say, our gaming two weeks.

04:42.040 --> 04:44.280
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming two weeks?

04:44.280 --> 04:47.880
I got Orange Box, so I played some Portal.

04:47.880 --> 04:53.520
I decided that I really like Half-Life 2, Episode 2, which Dan beat last night.

04:53.520 --> 05:01.600
I played a lot of Pinball, and I played a lot of Ragnarok, run any server now, run the

05:01.600 --> 05:07.060
Essence RO server, and they're better, and they don't go down randomly without putting

05:07.060 --> 05:09.640
up a freaking announcement, why?

05:09.640 --> 05:12.440
So I was going to say, so you've switched servers now.

05:12.440 --> 05:21.160
I've jumped the ship, but not a shark, because I'm awesome.

05:21.160 --> 05:28.800
And I've been trying to get back into playing some Final Fantasy VI, which I have on my

05:28.800 --> 05:29.800
DS.

05:29.800 --> 05:30.800
Very cool.

05:30.800 --> 05:36.160
But I've really just been doing more Portal.

05:36.160 --> 05:40.440
I can't play very much of it because I get sick, and, and, and, and, and Dan got me

05:40.440 --> 05:44.520
a rock band, I said I was going to get it, and I did.

05:44.520 --> 05:45.520
Very cool.

05:45.520 --> 05:50.200
And our guitar broke the first day, so we've been using the Guitar Hero guitars, because

05:50.200 --> 05:51.200
we have two.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.200
Gotcha.

05:52.200 --> 05:55.120
Well, we actually have a whole bunch of them, because Dan's friend Will, his stuff lives

05:55.120 --> 06:00.760
at our house sometimes, and Dan got my Iron Lung just for me, and I can't say that I like

06:00.760 --> 06:01.760
it.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.080
I need to buy that.

06:03.080 --> 06:06.120
And I wasn't in the same room listening to it, but it sounded like a cover.

06:06.120 --> 06:07.360
Oh, it's not the original?

06:07.360 --> 06:13.320
But the music is all dead on, just some, some of the covers just are like, no.

06:13.320 --> 06:18.320
Well, maybe they didn't want to get sued like the Guitar Heroes 80s people did.

06:18.320 --> 06:21.000
And I sang, I sang Creep, and I sang it the right way.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Did you?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
The right way.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.760
So you got the whole bundle then, you didn't just get the game itself, you got the mic

06:25.760 --> 06:26.760
and the drums and everything.

06:26.760 --> 06:27.760
We got everything.

06:27.760 --> 06:28.760
That's nice.

06:28.760 --> 06:29.760
We have, we have it all.

06:29.760 --> 06:30.840
So when are we going to rock out?

06:30.840 --> 06:32.080
You, me, and Loki have to make a band.

06:32.080 --> 06:33.080
When are we going to rock out?

06:33.080 --> 06:36.080
We're having it at, at our party tomorrow night.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.080
Oh.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.160
We have conflicting parties going on, sadly.

06:39.160 --> 06:40.720
Every year, and I invite you every year.

06:40.720 --> 06:43.800
Ironically enough, we're also probably going to be playing rock band.

06:43.800 --> 06:47.560
Ironically enough, I believe Matt is bringing rock band to, uh, to cost us a rob.

06:47.560 --> 06:50.560
I need a case for rock band.

06:50.560 --> 06:55.520
Seriously, that box is just too big to carry around lugging that thing.

06:55.520 --> 06:58.280
You need to get one of those nifty little cases.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.640
Well, you know, I'll get around to it eventually.

07:00.640 --> 07:03.600
Alright, well, Dark Soccer, you gotta come over at some point once all the party madness

07:03.600 --> 07:05.160
is done and we'll rock out to some Radiohead.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.800
Well, hey, I'm off work at least the next day.

07:07.800 --> 07:12.360
I have to go to work tomorrow, which is both craptacular and full of sucktitude.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.200
Sorry to hear it.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.480
Uh, Dark Knight in Chat says, I would love to hear Jamie singing.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.020
Any possibilities of YouTubes in the future?

07:20.020 --> 07:21.020
Not on YouTube.

07:21.020 --> 07:22.020
Not on YouTube?

07:22.020 --> 07:25.480
If my, if my throat doesn't kill me and I'm drunk enough, maybe.

07:25.480 --> 07:26.480
Alright.

07:26.480 --> 07:31.680
Well, the whole, the whole problem is that every year I get a sinus infection without

07:31.680 --> 07:32.680
fail.

07:32.680 --> 07:33.680
This we all know.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.760
But I always am sick on New Year's Eve.

07:35.760 --> 07:42.200
I'm telling you, man, we need to get that video from Eddie that has fucking Iron Man

07:42.200 --> 07:43.200
singing sabotage.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.840
A rice princess doing sabotage.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.020
Way better than me doing even Timmy.

07:47.020 --> 07:48.020
It's hilarious.

07:48.020 --> 07:55.480
Well, at any rate, I, I always get very, very drunk while I'm very, very sick, which is

07:55.480 --> 07:56.980
pretty stupid.

07:56.980 --> 08:01.280
And then they make me sing Karaoke Revolution and last year I tried to sing Snake Eater

08:01.280 --> 08:04.880
and I had no voice.

08:04.880 --> 08:11.400
I had no voice, so I was like, that's what it sounded like.

08:11.400 --> 08:17.120
Um, actdeft is in chat and actdeft is, uh, um, saying that we should go out on tour.

08:17.120 --> 08:22.300
He says the OLR world tour, the sensible world of podcasting tour, AKA the fag, your anger

08:22.300 --> 08:25.860
tour, which is a inside joke from 2007 of course.

08:25.860 --> 08:26.860
I like that.

08:26.860 --> 08:28.260
The sensible world of podcasting tour.

08:28.260 --> 08:29.260
That's a good name.

08:29.260 --> 08:30.260
That's very cool.

08:30.260 --> 08:31.260
Very good.

08:31.260 --> 08:32.840
So, Logie, how was your gimme weed, Logie?

08:32.840 --> 08:37.640
Um, well this week, or actually last week and the week before last, uh, I took some

08:37.640 --> 08:43.440
time off to play games and let's see, I didn't play as much as I thought I would because

08:43.440 --> 08:49.040
I ended up playing mostly Saints Bro because I'm trying to finish it, you know, months

08:49.040 --> 08:51.760
after it's come out, but you know, trying to finish it.

08:51.760 --> 08:57.260
I'm actually, according to the game, halfway through it, but I'm done with two of the storylines,

08:57.260 --> 08:58.640
some on the last one.

08:58.640 --> 09:06.240
And then, um, I played a little bit more Earth Defense Force 2017, and um, just now I have

09:06.240 --> 09:14.120
to grind to get, you know, more HP I guess, because I get raped by all the ants and ships

09:14.120 --> 09:18.320
and stuff on the last levels on Inferno, so the only way I can do that now is just to

09:18.320 --> 09:23.480
get, you know, tons and tons and tons and tons of health, which is gonna be incredibly

09:23.480 --> 09:27.880
boring to do, and um, so that'll be fun.

09:27.880 --> 09:37.160
And then, let's see, I bought a new 360, so I was, you know, playing stuff on that, um,

09:37.160 --> 09:42.380
I have my old 360 which I'm actually gonna fix, which is weird, um, because I think if

09:42.380 --> 09:47.120
I replace the, um, they have the X-clamp on there that you can replace, the heatsink,

09:47.120 --> 09:51.120
um, it should fix it because that, I hear something underneath the board that sounds

09:51.120 --> 09:55.320
like, I don't know, like a ball bearing rolling around, and I think that's actually some of

09:55.320 --> 10:00.200
the solder stripped off the board and actually kind of clumped up into a little ball, so

10:00.200 --> 10:06.280
I'm guessing that some of the solder's probably, um, I don't know, shorting out the board somewhere,

10:06.280 --> 10:10.960
so once I pull it all off we'll be able to see what's wrong, but apparently the X-clamp

10:10.960 --> 10:16.920
fix or whatever is fixed about 90% of the, you know, three ring boards, so, we'll see,

10:16.920 --> 10:21.180
I'll give it a shot, because hell, what can I do, break it more?

10:21.180 --> 10:28.040
It's already broken, so, who cares, um, and then, I played a little bit of Final Fantasy

10:28.040 --> 10:33.700
12 Revenant Wings, it's okay, I don't know, it's a little different, I guess it's the

10:33.700 --> 10:40.920
combat system's kind of similar to Final Fantasy 12 a little bit, but, I guess because I didn't

10:40.920 --> 10:46.320
play 12, the impact of these characters and when they're like, you know, oh, this person

10:46.320 --> 10:52.480
came, it's like, okay, who are you, I don't know who you are, um, so it's okay for me,

10:52.480 --> 10:55.760
but probably I should have played 12 before I played the DS game, but hey, that's their

10:55.760 --> 11:02.280
damn fault for releasing one game on the DS and one on the PS2, um, let's see, what else

11:02.280 --> 11:08.200
did I play, um, I actually played quite a bit of, um, No More Heroes, that game is fucking

11:08.200 --> 11:13.840
awesome, it seriously is awesome, after reading a fact on Game Facts that was actually in

11:13.840 --> 11:18.760
English, I kind of figured out how to actually play the game, pretty cool, I've finished

11:18.760 --> 11:22.320
the first boss and you kind of have to run around and do different errands and stuff,

11:22.320 --> 11:27.000
but um, pretty sweet game, definitely worth picking up when it comes out, and I think

11:27.000 --> 11:33.160
it's only a few more weeks before it comes out, so, that'd be a cool one, um, and then,

11:33.160 --> 11:36.880
other than that, just been playing around with my new PC, trying to get, well, Crysis

11:36.880 --> 11:41.960
runs on it, I've just been trying to overclock it now, so, um, right now I've run into the

11:41.960 --> 11:46.300
problem where I need a good program to read temperatures because every single program

11:46.300 --> 11:50.200
they have reads it differently and I want to know which one's correct, so, you know,

11:50.200 --> 11:57.720
I don't fry something, but, uh, my chips overclocked from 2.6 GHz to 3.3 right now, and then, um,

11:57.720 --> 12:05.760
Crysis runs about 35, 40 frames per second, but I want it to run faster, and I'm also

12:05.760 --> 12:13.520
getting another graphics card, because I replaced my old GTS, uh, or my 8800 GTS with the new

12:13.520 --> 12:22.240
one that's, um, faster, the GTS 512, and then, um, getting a second one to SLI him, so, uh,

12:22.240 --> 12:27.520
hopefully Crysis will run, um, shooting for 50 frames per second or 60, you know, I doubt

12:27.520 --> 12:29.920
that's going to happen, but, smoother the better.

12:29.920 --> 12:35.760
Alright, well, quite a lengthy gaming week, Loki, geez, I'm busy, uh, mine kind of pales

12:35.760 --> 12:40.520
by comparison, you know, um, since the family of mine doesn't do a whole lot for the holidays,

12:40.520 --> 12:45.560
uh, William and I decided to take a last minute getaway to Reno, and so, you know, Reno, not

12:45.560 --> 12:49.160
to offend any of our listeners who might live in Reno, but it's kind of a poor man's Vegas,

12:49.160 --> 12:54.360
you know, there's not a whole lot to do in Reno, except, you know, go to the big three

12:54.360 --> 12:58.840
casinos, but we did go to one of the casinos there, uh, Harrah's, and just randomly we

12:58.840 --> 13:02.360
found ourselves in the arcade, and I'll tell you what, the Harrah's arcade is actually

13:02.360 --> 13:05.960
kind of cool, because there was a lot of classic shit in there that we got to kind of take

13:05.960 --> 13:11.280
up, take some time to look at, including, um, uh, Mortal Kombat 4, they actually had

13:11.280 --> 13:14.800
a Mortal Kombat 4 machine, which I haven't seen in a long time, and the Simpsons arcade

13:14.800 --> 13:18.280
game, and William and I only played, like, one token on the Simpsons arcade game, but

13:18.280 --> 13:21.000
it must have been set to easy or something, because we got quite a ways through the game,

13:21.000 --> 13:24.880
uh, just on one token, which is pretty amazing, and here's the other cool thing they have

13:24.880 --> 13:31.920
there, they have a DDR fourth mix solo machine, and I haven't seen one of those in years,

13:31.920 --> 13:35.480
and of course, William's like, you gotta get up and dance, you gotta dance, like, I haven't

13:35.480 --> 13:40.280
played DDR forever, Harrah's Tahoe, you said? No, that's Harrah's, uh, Reno, not Tahoe,

13:40.280 --> 13:45.960
yeah. I played on that DDR fourth plus machine, yes, the solo one, I do remember that now,

13:45.960 --> 13:50.680
but, um, yeah, that's funny. You know what's weird is that the casino's very odd, because

13:50.680 --> 13:55.120
the arcade is, like, way back there, like, it's not like Circus Circus, which has all

13:55.120 --> 13:58.880
those, which has, like, a new Pump It Up machine right in the middle of everything, but, like,

13:58.880 --> 14:02.640
you know, at, um, Harrah's, you have to kind of go all the way back, and it's, like, back

14:02.640 --> 14:05.600
in a dark corner, it's kind of sad. I'm guessing the Pump It Up machine's probably right in

14:05.600 --> 14:10.520
the front of their arcade, where the third crane machine used to be for a while. And

14:10.520 --> 14:15.200
now GS68 is telling me that at the El Dorado, they have the fourth plus solo machine, which

14:15.200 --> 14:18.720
I completely miss somehow, but that's alright, you know what I was doing? I was gambling

14:18.720 --> 14:24.880
and losing a lot of money. I won little jack, I won jackpots, I won a silver jackpot, except

14:24.880 --> 14:32.520
it was on a penny machine, so I only won 35 bucks. That's cool. Solo sucks anyways. That's

14:32.520 --> 14:38.640
a dated joke, wow. Oh my god, a DDR USA mix machine, yes. Oh, rad. That takes me back.

14:38.640 --> 14:43.520
Oh, yeah, that takes me back. Good times. I love DDR USA. So, yeah, but here's the sad

14:43.520 --> 14:47.320
thing, I had to play on trick. Like, remember when I used to be really good at DDR, and

14:47.320 --> 14:52.880
you were good at DDR, and you were good at DDR? You used to play doubles, Jamie. I used

14:52.880 --> 14:59.000
to play doubles on, like, five feet. I still play doubles, and hope that death comes to

14:59.000 --> 15:05.400
me, but... Those were the days. And then, actually, it's funny, because some of my,

15:05.400 --> 15:09.960
actually, those of you guys that know Xtopher, Xtopher's sister got married over the weekend,

15:09.960 --> 15:16.040
and she married somebody who used to work at Konami's QA department with Shane, so I

15:16.040 --> 15:20.600
saw a lot of people from my DDR days, because he obviously invited all his old co-workers.

15:20.600 --> 15:24.160
I saw some people from the old DDR days, I hadn't seen him forever, so it was really

15:24.160 --> 15:30.280
cool. Kind of a little bit of reunion. So it was nice. Anyhow, moving on, that has nothing

15:30.280 --> 15:33.440
to do with Game of the Week, that's just tremendously. As far as other games, I played some World

15:33.440 --> 15:42.400
of Warcraft, of course. I now have, like, I think three PVP purples, and some crafted

15:42.400 --> 15:47.480
rare epic stuff, so I'm definitely starting to exhaust everything there is to do at level

15:47.480 --> 15:52.000
70, but I still have lots of instances to run, and alts to level. And also, I'll tell

15:52.000 --> 15:57.600
you what I've been playing. Santa brought me a copy of Super Mario Galaxy on the Wii,

15:57.600 --> 16:01.840
which I'd played before on our preview show, but it was nice to have some more time to

16:01.840 --> 16:04.980
play it without kind of that pressure of, you know, everything we're doing is being

16:04.980 --> 16:07.960
broadcast on the internet, right? So I just kind of had time to take it slow, take it

16:07.960 --> 16:13.920
easy. I fucking love it. You know what? And you know, I've said this on the show before,

16:13.920 --> 16:18.600
folks have been listening for a while, I thought Mario 64 was a little bit overrated. I did

16:18.600 --> 16:23.880
not think Mario 64 was the best Mario game of all time or any of that stuff. I just didn't

16:23.880 --> 16:27.720
see it. I mean, it's a good game, yes. In fact, it's a great game, but it wasn't, like,

16:27.720 --> 16:32.400
there was something about it I didn't quite like as much. But Mario Galaxy, it really

16:32.400 --> 16:37.040
is all that. I mean, I love some of the puzzles in it, like that gravity puzzle where you're

16:37.040 --> 16:42.200
inside the tube and the gravities change in a different way. I just, it's cool. I love

16:42.200 --> 16:47.480
it. So I definitely recommend, if you're a Wii owner, you have to get Galaxy, because

16:47.480 --> 16:51.600
this is the type of game that the Wii was really made for. So I've definitely been spending

16:51.600 --> 16:55.640
a lot of time on that. And thank you, Santa, for bringing me that. So that's pretty much

16:55.640 --> 16:59.800
going to do it for my gaming week. How about you guys on the chat room, how was your guys'

16:59.800 --> 17:07.880
gaming week? I see a lot of people were naming BeatMania 2DX distorted, Rockband was played

17:07.880 --> 17:16.040
by Color of Sakura, Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass, Xenae or Xene, X-E-N-E, was playing

17:16.040 --> 17:19.240
Persona 3. That's one of those games that came out this year that I totally missed.

17:19.240 --> 17:23.320
I finished the Phantom Hourglass finally. Oh, what'd you think? The ending. It's easy.

17:23.320 --> 17:30.440
It's a fucking easy game. I mean, that was it. The last boss is kind of, I guess, a little

17:30.440 --> 17:35.880
bit more difficult than the rest of them, but it was really easy. It's just, I'm not

17:35.880 --> 17:41.000
that great at games, but come on. I mean, seriously, it wasn't a challenge at all.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.920
Alright. Anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping, then we'll get into some of tonight's news

17:44.920 --> 17:47.880
and I'll tell you how the rest of the show's going to work, too. Our show's going to be

17:47.880 --> 17:51.760
a little bit different tonight, and we're going to actually open up the Skype line a

17:51.760 --> 17:55.920
little early tonight. Of course, now that I'm noticing that a lot of our regulars aren't

17:55.920 --> 18:00.440
here and, you know, I'm hoping that we're going to get some calls on Skype line because

18:00.440 --> 18:03.600
we really want you guys to participate, but if you guys don't call, we'll figure something

18:03.600 --> 18:08.200
else out. But basically what we're going to do, before tonight's show, we went through

18:08.200 --> 18:12.280
every single show role that we've done in 2007 because we write down all the stories

18:12.280 --> 18:15.880
we want to cover in tonight's show. And so we basically went to every single show role

18:15.880 --> 18:21.120
in 2007 and picked one story that really stuck out from each show that we did in 2007. So

18:21.120 --> 18:24.560
we're going to kind of go back and revisit some of the headlines from our various shows

18:24.560 --> 18:28.840
in 2007 and then talk about, with you guys on the phone, kind of what really stuck out

18:28.840 --> 18:33.000
in your mind from the various months and what do you think really impacted the gaming scene

18:33.000 --> 18:36.720
and the gaming industry as a whole in 2007. And then, of course, we want to get your picks

18:36.720 --> 18:41.840
for the best game of 2007 and the worst game of 2007. We're going to tally it up and get

18:41.840 --> 18:46.120
the definitive Orange Lounge radio choices. And at the very end of the show, Dark Soccer,

18:46.120 --> 18:51.960
Alokia, myself, we will be letting you know our worst games of the year and our top five

18:51.960 --> 18:56.680
favorite games of the year, each of us. And it's always very interesting because usually

18:56.680 --> 19:01.680
we don't agree with critics because they are our personal top five favorites of the year.

19:01.680 --> 19:06.240
It doesn't necessarily mean the games we think that, you know, should be critically lauded

19:06.240 --> 19:10.400
as the five best. No, they're the five games we enjoy the most and we think were the best

19:10.400 --> 19:14.200
that we spent our money on. So we'll be talking about that towards the end of tonight's show.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.880
But for now, we're going to do a quick news rundown because we weren't here last week

19:16.880 --> 19:20.600
and, of course, there still is news going on in the gaming world, even this week. So

19:20.600 --> 19:24.240
before we get into the year-end review, let's talk about this week. And Loki is going to

19:24.240 --> 19:27.760
do the honors tonight of just running down the week's news. And I think actually Jamie

19:27.760 --> 19:29.560
has one or two stories. We'll get to that at the end.

19:29.560 --> 19:34.840
Yeah. Okay. Anyways, this week, some, you know, stuff that's probably like not a big

19:34.840 --> 19:40.880
surprise happened, including Sony of America Trademark Resistance 2. Oh my God, really?

19:40.880 --> 19:45.320
They're going to make a sequel to a game that sold a lot for them. Oh my God, that is such

19:45.320 --> 19:46.320
a shocker.

19:46.320 --> 19:47.400
I'm so surprised.

19:47.400 --> 19:58.120
So surprised. Anyways, Kiriyamaoka, one of our favorite music producers and also creator

19:58.120 --> 19:59.800
of some recent Sun Hill games.

19:59.800 --> 20:02.680
Gaming stud in general, wouldn't you agree, DarkSakura?

20:02.680 --> 20:03.680
He's cute.

20:03.680 --> 20:08.400
Gaming, he is pretty cute. We met him in person at E3 a few years ago. Gaming stud in general,

20:08.400 --> 20:13.080
Kiriyamaoka. I don't just mean in the physical sense. I mean, he's just, he makes Silent

20:13.080 --> 20:16.000
Hill for God's sake. He's amazing.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.640
So we listen to what this man has to say.

20:17.640 --> 20:26.480
Anyways, he was quoted actually saying that the U.S. team's graphical and technical ability

20:26.480 --> 20:33.320
is amazing. There's a huge gap, actually, and he's talking about between the U.S. teams

20:33.320 --> 20:39.760
and Japanese development houses with the way games are going right now. I don't know. I

20:39.760 --> 20:46.040
guess that makes kind of sense, especially with a lot of the companies being in the U.S.,

20:46.040 --> 20:50.040
Nintendo, I mean, they're both in Japan, the U.S. and stuff, but I don't know. A lot of

20:50.040 --> 20:53.880
the third party companies are in the U.S., so I guess that makes sense. Not to say the

20:53.880 --> 20:55.920
Japanese can't program good games.

20:55.920 --> 20:59.720
I want to go off on a tangent real fast, because this discussion was actually, I was talking

20:59.720 --> 21:02.720
to one of my friends in the car. We were up very late last night because we drove to Rocky

21:02.720 --> 21:07.280
Horror in San Francisco, and it was William, myself, and our mutual friend, Jake, and Jake's

21:07.280 --> 21:11.280
a big gaming nerd like us, and we were talking about kind of Japanese versus America, and

21:11.280 --> 21:14.360
I think actually I was talking about this very thing right here, because somehow we

21:14.360 --> 21:16.760
were talking about Silent Hill.

21:16.760 --> 21:20.640
It kind of occurred to me, Nintendo's a very Japanese company, whereas Microsoft's a very

21:20.640 --> 21:26.640
American company, and Microsoft seems to be kind of winning this. Well, I mean, I guess

21:26.640 --> 21:30.360
I shouldn't say that, because the Wii is obviously dominating, but the Xbox is kind of dominating

21:30.360 --> 21:34.440
in their own way, and it's kind of like, you know, the Xbox kind of caters to what's really

21:34.440 --> 21:38.600
big in the American market right now, and that's internet gaming, and that's something

21:38.600 --> 21:42.960
that, for whatever reason, Nintendo has never seen to capture.

21:42.960 --> 21:47.300
Like, you know, Nintendo is not getting on board with internet gaming. They did one game

21:47.300 --> 21:50.360
on the GameCube that was a third party game to begin with, right, and they really haven't

21:50.360 --> 21:53.920
done much on the Wii yet. I mean, granted, we have Mario Kart, but we've all seen the

21:53.920 --> 22:00.440
friend codes thing sucks and all that, and we were kind of wondering, like, why is it

22:00.440 --> 22:04.360
that Nintendo does not get online gaming? And it kind of struck me, it's probably a

22:04.360 --> 22:10.360
cultural difference, and what it probably is, is that arcades are dead here in America,

22:10.360 --> 22:14.800
and that's why we're so big on internet gaming, whereas in Japan, it seems like arcades are

22:14.800 --> 22:19.320
still, I mean, maybe not what they once were, but they're still very prevalent, and people

22:19.320 --> 22:21.020
still meet up to do the gaming.

22:21.020 --> 22:24.960
So what? I don't understand, though, because they recognize, though, that the US and, like,

22:24.960 --> 22:31.080
Europe and stuff are big gaming markets and maybe even bigger than Japan, and, you know,

22:31.080 --> 22:34.720
they recognize it. That's why we're getting so many Wiis here in the US. So it's not like

22:34.720 --> 22:37.480
they don't understand that. It's just, they're just not doing it.

22:37.480 --> 22:41.920
But, kind of like why I'm relating it to this story is that, you know, when that's their

22:41.920 --> 22:46.320
culture, that's their perspective on things, and so maybe, I think, part of the reason

22:46.320 --> 22:50.720
why, like, Akira Yomoka might be kind of, you know, really liking what the Americans

22:50.720 --> 22:55.240
are doing now is that because it's a different approach based on the way things work here.

22:55.240 --> 23:01.060
I'll tell you what it is, and this is pretty much, I mean, when they were planning out

23:01.060 --> 23:07.200
these consoles, when the 360, PlayStation 3, and the, you know, we were all in development

23:07.200 --> 23:11.320
and stuff, and they figured out what they wanted to do, Microsoft already had some success

23:11.320 --> 23:16.080
with the Xbox Live service, so of course they wanted to bring that over, and they had done

23:16.080 --> 23:23.080
a little bit with the Xbox Live Arcade service on the Xbox, very little, and then, you know,

23:23.840 --> 23:28.900
of course it took off here. Problem is, though, Nintendo didn't plan for any sort of online

23:28.900 --> 23:32.680
infrastructure. They didn't think it was a big deal. They said, oh, whatever, you know,

23:32.680 --> 23:36.160
our systems sell very well by themselves. We have the portable systems, you know, maybe

23:36.160 --> 23:39.600
we'll link it up with the DS and that kind of stuff, and they didn't really do anything

23:39.600 --> 23:44.760
with it. Well, you know, come to find out, guess what? Online gaming is really popular,

23:44.760 --> 23:48.680
and now they're like, crap, what do we do now? We don't have any sort of infrastructure

23:48.680 --> 23:53.080
built for this stuff, and so now they're way behind with all that. Same with the PlayStation

23:53.080 --> 23:56.200
Network, I mean, they didn't really have a unified online service or anything like that.

23:56.200 --> 24:01.160
I think Sony's issue is that they are stretching themselves thin, because you notice when games

24:01.160 --> 24:05.480
keep getting delayed, like, you know, LittleBigPlanet Home keeps getting delayed, I think that to

24:05.480 --> 24:09.840
me says that Sony, their thing is that they've been trying to do both. They've been trying

24:09.840 --> 24:14.520
to, to Sony's credit, I think everything they've been doing, they've been trying to

24:14.520 --> 24:17.780
appeal, they are the ones that have truly been trying to appeal to a worldwide audience

24:17.780 --> 24:21.320
the whole time, but they're stretching themselves too thin, they can't do it, they don't have

24:21.320 --> 24:26.880
the resources to do it. Whereas Nintendo has focused their efforts on this, and Xbox for

24:26.880 --> 24:30.080
the most part has focused their efforts on this, and both have excelled very well, while

24:30.080 --> 24:33.600
Sony has spread themselves too thin. Well, and the other thing too, Microsoft now is

24:33.600 --> 24:37.240
starting to figure out, hey, guess what, we've got to, you know, think about our Japanese

24:37.240 --> 24:41.040
market as well, and that's why they're publishing games, you know, like, Lost Odyssey, Blue

24:41.040 --> 24:47.920
Dragon, you know, stuff like that, to appeal to a more variety of, you know, consumer.

24:47.920 --> 24:51.080
Because, you know, not everyone's going to love Halo, or love that kind of stuff, and

24:51.080 --> 24:56.040
they're trying to also do, like, some of the kids' games and stuff, you know, Pinata, kind

24:56.040 --> 24:58.920
of sucked, but, you know what, they don't have to really worry about that.

24:58.920 --> 25:00.000
It was a good attempt.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.280
It was an okay attempt, but they're, you know, third party, you know, publishers will take

25:04.280 --> 25:08.920
care of that stuff, they don't have to really worry about it. Whereas Nintendo, they're

25:08.920 --> 25:13.720
doing a lot of stuff that caters kind of towards the family, you know, the younger kids, you

25:13.720 --> 25:17.280
know, even though they're trying to break out of that mold and stuff, unfortunately

25:17.280 --> 25:21.920
a lot of the games that they're still releasing, even look at first party stuff, I mean, what,

25:21.920 --> 25:26.320
you've got Metroid Prime 3, I guess that would be the only game, and maybe Excite Truck,

25:26.320 --> 25:30.520
that's, you know, first party that would kind of appeal to, you know, more than just kids.

25:30.520 --> 25:35.360
You know, some of these games like Disaster Day of Crisis, and, you know, Project Hammer,

25:35.360 --> 25:41.060
which is cancelled, I mean, those games could have appealed to some older, you know, consumers,

25:41.060 --> 25:45.400
but they didn't do it, so they kind of have to rely on third party companies to do that,

25:45.400 --> 25:49.040
but unfortunately because there's not a lot of, you know, hey, look at this, you know,

25:49.040 --> 25:53.160
it's a first party game, it was more of a mature title, it did really well, then a lot

25:53.160 --> 25:57.480
of other companies will try to emulate that, but since no one's doing that, you know, look

25:57.480 --> 26:02.880
at Manhunt 2, they attempted to be mature, and that kind of backfired on them, not because,

26:02.880 --> 26:06.920
you know, it was mature, it was because it was a crappy game, but, you know, I think

26:06.920 --> 26:11.340
like with games like No More Heroes coming out, I think that will do very well, I hope

26:11.340 --> 26:15.280
it does very well, and because of that, a lot of people will say, hey, mature games

26:15.280 --> 26:18.840
can be on this console, and so we'll put out more mature games.

26:18.840 --> 26:24.000
Alright, well, I was going to turn to the chat room for some comments on this, some

26:24.000 --> 26:29.840
polarizing statements made by us on Viva Pinata, Flaming Bozo says, Viva did not suck, and

26:29.840 --> 26:33.720
Pooeater says, Viva did suck, so some polarizing opinions there.

26:33.720 --> 26:35.920
Alright, what did they try to do with Viva Pinata?

26:35.920 --> 26:36.920
I went from suck to blow.

26:36.920 --> 26:41.120
Let me put it this way, what they, their expectations of Viva Pinata versus what actually happened

26:41.120 --> 26:43.360
were a little different, they thought it was going to be the next Pokemon.

26:43.360 --> 26:48.080
Yeah, I agree, they set their bar way too high on Viva Pinata, and I would not, I certainly

26:48.080 --> 26:52.760
would never put Viva Pinata on a bad games of the year list, it just wasn't, it's not,

26:52.760 --> 26:53.880
it wasn't Pokemon.

26:53.880 --> 26:57.880
It's not a bad game, it's just a game I'm not going to play, I mean, there are kids,

26:57.880 --> 27:01.760
I'm sure, that love the game, there are probably adults that love the game, it's just not for

27:01.760 --> 27:02.760
me.

27:02.760 --> 27:05.840
Viva Pinata Party Animals, that's crap.

27:05.840 --> 27:11.560
I think even like, Major Nelson has said Viva Pinata Party Animals sucks, and that's pretty

27:11.560 --> 27:17.360
bad when the people inside Microsoft don't like the game, I don't know that to be sure,

27:17.360 --> 27:18.360
don't quote me on that.

27:18.360 --> 27:21.640
They tried to look at what Pokemon has, and kind of emulate that, so they're like, okay,

27:21.640 --> 27:25.760
it has a cartoon series, great, let's do a cartoon series, and it had a game, okay, let's

27:25.760 --> 27:26.760
do this.

27:26.760 --> 27:29.960
They put this out here, exactly like Pokemon, it's going to have the appeal of Pokemon.

27:29.960 --> 27:34.480
No, it did not, in fact, I thought that adding the cartoon as well is kind of just shoving

27:34.480 --> 27:36.360
it down our throats even more.

27:36.360 --> 27:40.520
Just leave it as a game, if the game was popular enough to warrant a cartoon, great, do that.

27:40.520 --> 27:45.900
I like Pooh Eater's idea, Viva Manhunt Pinata, there you go, I'm sorry, I did not mean to

27:45.900 --> 27:52.360
derail the show with that little tangent, but when hasn't that happened before, sorry.

27:52.360 --> 27:57.600
Next week, SNK will be producing yet another new game, oh wait, no, I'm sorry, they're

27:57.600 --> 28:03.160
not, they're going to be putting out Metal Slug 3 on Xbox Live Arcade.

28:03.160 --> 28:07.160
And the sound of Jamie cheering, by the way, is the only person you'll hear cheering about,

28:07.160 --> 28:08.160
no, I'm just kidding.

28:08.160 --> 28:09.160
You know what, it looks cool.

28:09.160 --> 28:10.160
Metal Slug has a cult fanbase.

28:10.160 --> 28:11.920
It's supposed to have updated HD visuals.

28:11.920 --> 28:12.920
That's cool.

28:12.920 --> 28:15.400
Whatever that's supposed to mean, because all the screenshots don't look updated to

28:15.400 --> 28:19.000
me, but okay, I'll take the word for it.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.600
Does HD visuals mean that they've added bars on the side that are prez?

28:23.600 --> 28:28.760
They're going to do like they did with Double Dragon, not Double Dragon, yeah, Double Dragon.

28:28.760 --> 28:29.760
That's okay, I guess.

28:29.760 --> 28:33.240
It looks okay, I think, hey, you know what, if SNK's listening, if you want to remake

28:33.240 --> 28:38.480
the game, great, or like reissue it, but like, redo all the visuals kind of like, I don't

28:38.480 --> 28:44.760
know, Super Street Fighter 2, HD, whatever, you know, that's going to be coming out, redo

28:44.760 --> 28:46.320
all the graphics, that'd be awesome.

28:46.320 --> 28:49.440
Metal Slug might actually be a really fun live game.

28:49.440 --> 28:50.440
It is.

28:50.440 --> 28:51.440
Like, to play with people on live.

28:51.440 --> 28:56.960
And it is going to have co-op over live, so that's kind of cool, and so yeah, it's 800

28:56.960 --> 29:00.320
Microsoft points, should be out Wednesday, no word on if there's going to be another

29:00.320 --> 29:03.520
game coming out as well, because it's only one game announced so far.

29:03.520 --> 29:06.760
You know, and to Metal Slug's credit, although Loki and I give it a hard time on this show

29:06.760 --> 29:10.840
for kind of being the same thing over and over, it really is a lot of fun, I think this

29:10.840 --> 29:11.840
will be a good title.

29:11.840 --> 29:19.800
I'd like to, you know, make fun of SNK because, you know, they're still making 16-bit games

29:19.800 --> 29:20.800
all these years later.

29:20.800 --> 29:25.040
The last four games that have come out from them have been, like, anthologies, okay, so,

29:25.040 --> 29:28.860
no offense, I mean, hey, you know what, you're not the only company that does that, Capcom

29:28.860 --> 29:31.840
and Activision, or Midway, I mean, everybody's...

29:31.840 --> 29:36.680
But some of the anthologies, like the Mega Man anthology kicks ass, like, I don't know.

29:36.680 --> 29:37.680
I don't know.

29:37.680 --> 29:43.560
I just, you know, seriously, Metal Slug 3, Metal Slug 1, they've been re-released so

29:43.560 --> 29:48.520
many times, it's like, okay, great, we love these games, but let's make something new,

29:48.520 --> 29:49.520
okay?

29:49.520 --> 29:55.560
Anyways, so, there's of course a new Street Fighter movie coming out, and not sure whether

29:55.560 --> 30:00.520
you're going to be happy about that or not, but apparently one of the stars that they

30:00.520 --> 30:08.480
have casted so far is in the role of Chun-Li, and it's Smallville's Kristin Kriek, and,

30:08.480 --> 30:12.760
I don't know, she doesn't look Asian to me, but hey, she looks hot, so that's...

30:12.760 --> 30:15.080
Is that the one that plays Lana?

30:15.080 --> 30:16.080
I believe so.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.080
Yeah, I believe so.

30:17.080 --> 30:18.080
She's Asian.

30:18.080 --> 30:21.240
She doesn't look Asian.

30:21.240 --> 30:27.560
I'm sorry, that's not, I don't know, whatever, it'll work, I think, but hey.

30:27.560 --> 30:28.560
Is she hot?

30:28.560 --> 30:31.680
I mean, that's what most of the boys want to know, is she hot?

30:31.680 --> 30:32.680
And some of the girls.

30:32.680 --> 30:36.160
You know, that's the most important thing, isn't it?

30:36.160 --> 30:38.600
I mean, ethnicity be damned.

30:38.600 --> 30:43.480
Anyways, so, I don't know if you, really to be honest, the last Street Fighter movie didn't

30:43.480 --> 30:47.680
set the bar too high, so, I mean, you don't have to try that hard to make a good movie

30:47.680 --> 30:48.680
here.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.680
But it had Kylie.

30:49.680 --> 30:53.240
Yes, Kylie Minogue was awesome as Kami.

30:53.240 --> 30:54.240
And who was Chun-Li?

30:54.240 --> 30:55.320
Ming-Na was Chun-Li.

30:55.320 --> 30:56.320
She's on ER now.

30:56.320 --> 30:57.320
She wasn't bad.

30:57.320 --> 30:58.320
She wasn't bad.

30:58.320 --> 31:04.320
Apparently, anyways, I've actually watched this little video here.

31:04.320 --> 31:10.000
There is a conference that went on, a hacking conference called 24C3.

31:10.000 --> 31:15.440
And it's, I guess, an annual four-day conference organized by a hacking group called Chaos

31:15.440 --> 31:21.840
Computer Club, where, of course, thousands of hackers and scientists, artists, et cetera,

31:21.840 --> 31:22.840
gather.

31:22.840 --> 31:29.840
So, one of the things that they showed off was that they have completely hacked the Wii.

31:29.840 --> 31:31.480
This is an unmodded Wii.

31:31.480 --> 31:35.280
They are managed, well, I shouldn't say it's unmodded, but there's no mod ship running

31:35.280 --> 31:36.280
in it.

31:36.280 --> 31:41.320
And they've, using a specially made disk and a kind of a serial port thing, they called

31:41.320 --> 31:49.120
it a tweezer attack, they were able to run homebrew software in Wii mode.

31:49.120 --> 31:55.360
Usually before that, they've only been able to do it through the GameCube operating system

31:55.360 --> 31:56.920
or whatever on there.

31:56.920 --> 32:02.000
It's all been limited to GameCube kind of homebrew stuff, but now they have access to

32:02.000 --> 32:07.440
the full Wii stuff and within a matter of time, we're going to see a lot more Wii homebrew

32:07.440 --> 32:08.440
out there.

32:08.440 --> 32:10.000
So, I guess that's a good thing.

32:10.000 --> 32:15.040
If you're interested, though, there is a YouTube video out there that shows kind of the whole

32:15.040 --> 32:16.040
demonstration.

32:16.040 --> 32:21.800
It's pretty much, they have like, I guess, a modded Lego Star Wars complete saga disk

32:21.800 --> 32:26.560
and they used, they ran some program that showed like, you know, kind of the coordinates

32:26.560 --> 32:31.720
of your Wii pointer and you could start and stop the drives and stuff like that.

32:31.720 --> 32:34.040
That reminds me of something that I saw on YouTube.

32:34.040 --> 32:35.760
I have a feeling we're thinking of the same thing.

32:35.760 --> 32:36.760
Go ahead.

32:36.760 --> 32:39.120
The guy did the target placing.

32:39.120 --> 32:40.800
That is the same thing I'm thinking of.

32:40.800 --> 32:41.800
Wasn't that shit amazing?

32:41.800 --> 32:42.800
That was pretty cool.

32:42.800 --> 32:44.300
Did you see that YouTube?

32:44.300 --> 32:48.480
The guy, and I can't remember his name, I'm sorry, maybe somebody in chat remembers, but

32:48.480 --> 32:53.840
he was a student at some school and he put together this thing where he swapped the Wiimote

32:53.840 --> 33:01.240
and the sensor bar to create this, you know, the television instead of looking like, you

33:01.240 --> 33:03.880
know, a normal Wii game, it looked like a portal into another world.

33:03.880 --> 33:07.840
He didn't use the sensor bar itself, he actually used two infrareds attached to goggles.

33:07.840 --> 33:08.840
Okay, sorry, same concept.

33:08.840 --> 33:10.840
Because the sensor bar itself has an infrared reflect.

33:10.840 --> 33:12.640
Right, and he put them in the glasses.

33:12.640 --> 33:15.800
And it was basically, this YouTube is amazing, it's had over a million views, I'm sure most

33:15.800 --> 33:20.600
of you have seen it, but it was basically, he kind of called out a lot of the game developers

33:20.600 --> 33:24.640
in it and said, hey, if you want to do something this cool, you know, give me a call or you

33:24.640 --> 33:25.640
should do it.

33:25.640 --> 33:27.320
You know, I just told you how to do it.

33:27.320 --> 33:32.680
So it looked amazing, just even in the little YouTube, the way, oh wow.

33:32.680 --> 33:36.200
It was, yeah, it was like a head tracking, a VR head tracking is what it is, they have

33:36.200 --> 33:43.320
that right now for like flight sims, like they're showing flight sim 10 or whatever,

33:43.320 --> 33:48.280
you can do that and you can actually do it where it will, I don't know.

33:48.280 --> 33:50.000
That was not a hacking thing this guy did.

33:50.000 --> 33:55.280
Well, he made his own custom program, but you know, still, the hardware he used was

33:55.280 --> 33:58.240
all pretty much, you know, stuff that could easily be done.

33:58.240 --> 33:59.240
It just looked amazing.

33:59.240 --> 34:04.200
Well, you can, how was it, adjust, I guess scale it so you don't have to look completely

34:04.200 --> 34:08.920
behind you to look behind you and stuff like that, but yeah, it's pretty cool.

34:08.920 --> 34:14.040
And he had some other things too, like on how to make like a VR, like whiteboard type

34:14.040 --> 34:16.080
thing and some other stuff.

34:16.080 --> 34:17.080
Wow.

34:17.080 --> 34:27.840
So, anyways, other things to note here, some that may not be too happy unfortunately and

34:27.840 --> 34:32.800
I hate to be the one to mention this, but I'm just gonna say it, this hasn't really

34:32.800 --> 34:40.320
been out there that much, or actually it hasn't been out there yet, this news, but, let me

34:40.320 --> 34:46.200
just say it I guess, it is a very likely situation that Smash Brothers may have been delayed

34:46.200 --> 34:49.320
another month.

34:49.320 --> 34:51.840
And where is this coming from?

34:51.840 --> 34:58.720
I just happened to see a date change in our system for March now for Smash Brothers.

34:58.720 --> 35:00.300
So it could just be an anomaly?

35:00.300 --> 35:02.680
It could be an anomaly, it could be one of those things.

35:02.680 --> 35:07.760
Now here's why I think it might be true though, because they're running into, I guess, there

35:07.760 --> 35:14.460
are so many places that they can manufacture Wii Dis, and right now they're at full production

35:14.460 --> 35:18.620
and because of that, a lot of games are getting delayed because they can't manufacture this

35:18.620 --> 35:21.200
in time.

35:21.200 --> 35:26.960
And they've said a few months ago that all Wii games and some DS games will be affected

35:26.960 --> 35:35.260
by this, and so being that the case, one of two things could be happening here, one, distribution

35:35.260 --> 35:39.880
may not be getting their copies, but retail will be, if there's going to be a shortage

35:39.880 --> 35:43.160
like that, if they're anticipating that there's going to be a shortage, they're going to delay

35:43.160 --> 35:47.480
it for everybody else for a month, or it really is delayed a month.

35:47.480 --> 35:53.960
So right now, just don't be surprised if you see that news come out, but I wouldn't confirm

35:53.960 --> 35:55.960
it 100% yet.

35:55.960 --> 35:56.960
Interesting.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.960
I don't know.

35:58.960 --> 36:03.160
Now as some folks are hoping, could it be that they've delayed it to add Mega Man?

36:03.160 --> 36:05.880
I doubt that.

36:05.880 --> 36:09.560
Didn't the guy who made Mega Man come out this week and say Mega Man is not in Smash

36:09.560 --> 36:10.560
Bros?

36:10.560 --> 36:11.560
I don't remember.

36:11.560 --> 36:12.560
I'm almost positive I read a story about that.

36:12.560 --> 36:15.640
Everyone thought that the 20th anniversary of Mega Man they were in announced that Mega

36:15.640 --> 36:16.640
Man was going to be in there.

36:16.640 --> 36:19.680
I would like Mega Man in there, I think that'd be pretty awesome, but I don't think that's

36:19.680 --> 36:20.680
going to happen.

36:20.680 --> 36:25.080
And Color of Sakura also points out in their chatroom that Brawl already went gold in Japan.

36:25.080 --> 36:26.080
Yeah.

36:26.080 --> 36:27.080
So that's good.

36:27.080 --> 36:30.560
Well, it's rumored that it went gold in Japan.

36:30.560 --> 36:35.800
It's not official yet, because that was some website that is in production or whatever.

36:35.800 --> 36:39.440
But it's not official yet, by any means.

36:39.440 --> 36:44.620
Brack2000 speculates if they are going to come out and announce this delay, again, many

36:44.620 --> 36:48.220
of the things Loki said is true, it could be an anomaly, it could be the distribution

36:48.220 --> 36:50.680
only is getting delayed or what have you.

36:50.680 --> 36:52.800
Brack2000 has an interesting thought here.

36:52.800 --> 36:57.360
I wonder if they'll announce this delay with a huge announcement like last time with Sonic.

36:57.360 --> 36:59.840
Like good news to soften the blow?

36:59.840 --> 37:05.000
Here's the thing though, and this is the only reason why I think it might be true, any time

37:05.000 --> 37:08.420
that we've been delayed product or whatever, like say, oh we're not going to ship you this

37:08.420 --> 37:12.880
much or whatever, they didn't change the street date, they just, here's the date for this,

37:12.880 --> 37:17.480
oh by the way, you're not getting any until this time.

37:17.480 --> 37:22.720
I doubt they would change the date, but I'm just saying, it's about a month, I think March

37:22.720 --> 37:23.720
9th is what we showed.

37:23.720 --> 37:24.720
Keep us posted.

37:24.720 --> 37:25.720
We'll see, I'll keep you posted.

37:25.720 --> 37:27.720
You heard it here first.

37:27.720 --> 37:29.840
But guess, I was going to mention one other thing.

37:29.840 --> 37:37.960
There's two other games actually that, it's funny because some games might not be only

37:37.960 --> 37:42.920
on Xbox 360, one we'll probably be talking about a little bit later of course, or we're

37:42.920 --> 37:50.200
talking about quite a while ago, our wonderful game that involves rolling certain things

37:50.200 --> 37:51.440
around.

37:51.440 --> 37:57.380
It's still showing in our system, and it's actually moved dates the other week, sometime

37:57.380 --> 38:04.360
around say, April-ish, so it's still very possible that that's actually coming out.

38:04.360 --> 38:05.360
Interesting.

38:05.360 --> 38:06.360
Yeah.

38:06.360 --> 38:09.640
Could you, I could totally picture a gold edition with all the downloadable content

38:09.640 --> 38:13.520
included in the game, just like Marvel Ultimate Alliance or something like that.

38:13.520 --> 38:14.520
That'd be interesting.

38:14.520 --> 38:15.520
Totally see that coming.

38:15.520 --> 38:20.720
And then let's see here, I was going to mention one other thing real quick, Silent Hill Origins,

38:20.720 --> 38:25.600
that was coming out on PlayStation 2 in Japan, it is coming out over here too.

38:25.600 --> 38:28.280
Actually sooner than later, March.

38:28.280 --> 38:29.280
Nice!

38:29.280 --> 38:32.920
Very excited about that, you know, because I didn't play too much of the PSP version,

38:32.920 --> 38:35.560
but PlayStation 2, that might be pretty cool.

38:35.560 --> 38:39.800
Even though I guess I could plug in my PSP to my TV and do the same thing.

38:39.800 --> 38:43.680
Finally, let's see here, what else we've got.

38:43.680 --> 38:52.200
Oh, the DS, it's actually sold quite a bit of units in Japan, so much so that it's actually

38:52.200 --> 38:56.720
outsold the PlayStation 2 over the course of its lifetime.

38:56.720 --> 39:01.720
So that's pretty cool, hasn't done it in the U.S. though yet.

39:01.720 --> 39:09.000
And then finally, the original Nights game on Nights Into Dreams will be coming to Game

39:09.000 --> 39:10.840
Tap in 2008.

39:10.840 --> 39:14.680
I've been playing that already.

39:14.680 --> 39:16.800
You do Christmas nights this time of year, right?

39:16.800 --> 39:17.800
I do Christmas nights.

39:17.800 --> 39:18.800
Good times?

39:18.800 --> 39:19.800
Very hard to watch on my TV.

39:19.800 --> 39:23.640
Jamie, you've got a story for us real quick, and then we're going to open up the Skype

39:23.640 --> 39:24.640
line.

39:24.640 --> 39:30.280
So 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, call in and talk to us

39:30.280 --> 39:32.680
about the year 2007.

39:32.680 --> 39:38.560
This is more of a humor thing, because I think it's pretty damn funny, is that Nokia's N-Gage

39:38.560 --> 39:45.120
first access platform has been delayed, and it's not going to be out in time for the holidays.

39:45.120 --> 39:51.040
It was going to work on the Nokia N81 and N81A gigabyte phone for games and other types

39:51.040 --> 39:57.040
of fun stuff, and they said that they ran into a little glitch while running it through

39:57.040 --> 39:58.040
global testing.

39:58.040 --> 40:01.400
So it's not there, like anyone cares.

40:01.400 --> 40:08.880
I know what I was going to say, I'm sure all of America and the rest of the world, frankly,

40:08.880 --> 40:09.880
is disappointed.

40:09.880 --> 40:10.880
Phantom?

40:10.880 --> 40:11.880
Yeah, by this news.

40:11.880 --> 40:13.160
What ever happened to the fucking Phantom?

40:13.160 --> 40:15.240
The lap board came out.

40:15.240 --> 40:16.240
Really?

40:16.240 --> 40:17.240
Yeah.

40:17.240 --> 40:18.800
So it went from being console to lap board?

40:18.800 --> 40:19.800
Yeah.

40:19.800 --> 40:20.800
Interesting.

40:20.800 --> 40:22.720
I didn't think the console was going to work when they were showing it off.

40:22.720 --> 40:25.800
Oh my god, because it was just a PC, I'm like, I don't get this.

40:25.800 --> 40:27.800
Who would download PC games?

40:27.800 --> 40:33.680
Apparently Steam worked, so I was wrong there, but still, I mean, I don't know.

40:33.680 --> 40:39.400
If they had a console that was just Steam, that might be pretty cool, maybe.

40:39.400 --> 40:43.560
Well our Skype line is open, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

40:43.560 --> 40:45.640
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

40:45.640 --> 40:51.480
Please remember though, if you're going to call us on Skype, give our test call a call

40:51.480 --> 40:52.480
first.

40:52.480 --> 40:56.400
That's ECHO123 on Skype, and that way you don't sound like shit when you get through

40:56.400 --> 40:57.400
on the Skype line.

40:57.400 --> 41:00.520
And what we're going to do is we're going to recap some of the stories that we went

41:00.520 --> 41:06.840
over this year in the various months of the year, and I'll explain how that works as soon

41:06.840 --> 41:07.840
as we take our first call.

41:07.840 --> 41:08.840
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

41:08.840 --> 41:10.000
Who's this?

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
This is Ravenstaufen.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
Can you hear me?

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
I can hear you, sir.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.320
How are you?

41:14.320 --> 41:15.320
I am fine.

41:15.320 --> 41:19.020
Well god damn if it wouldn't be a year in review show if we didn't have you here, Ravenstaufen,

41:19.020 --> 41:20.160
so I appreciate you calling in.

41:20.160 --> 41:21.640
How are you doing?

41:21.640 --> 41:22.640
I'm doing fine.

41:22.640 --> 41:24.980
I'm playing Mario Galaxy just like you are.

41:24.980 --> 41:26.640
Isn't it fucking great?

41:26.640 --> 41:28.440
I do think it's fucking great.

41:28.440 --> 41:29.440
I really do.

41:29.440 --> 41:30.440
Excellent.

41:30.440 --> 41:32.640
Well, go ahead.

41:32.640 --> 41:36.200
The thing about Mario Galaxy that impresses me is the graphics.

41:36.200 --> 41:38.600
I know the Wii is a piece of shit.

41:38.600 --> 41:42.200
That's what some people say, but I really think that the Wii can pull off some really

41:42.200 --> 41:43.200
good graphics.

41:43.200 --> 41:47.800
You know, and we've said it before on this show, Nintendo loves to have aces in their

41:47.800 --> 41:53.740
sleeves, and their systems always have these little hidden features and are probably capable

41:53.740 --> 41:56.600
of much more than people usually give them credit for originally.

41:56.600 --> 41:58.480
That's how they extend the life of their systems.

41:58.480 --> 42:01.640
So I'm sure you have not seen the best looking Wii game yet.

42:01.640 --> 42:04.160
Yeah, but this one is pretty good.

42:04.160 --> 42:09.680
I really like what they did with the little effects, the little twinkles, and the little

42:09.680 --> 42:13.760
things you go in the air, you see little things here and there.

42:13.760 --> 42:14.760
The water shines.

42:14.760 --> 42:20.440
Well, something to keep in mind too, Ravenstaufen, is that Mario Galaxy was not a ported GameCube

42:20.440 --> 42:21.440
game, either.

42:21.440 --> 42:22.440
You know what I mean?

42:22.440 --> 42:27.640
It's truly an original game, and I think that's part of what made it stand out.

42:27.640 --> 42:30.040
But it is colorful, so that's what I'm going to say.

42:30.040 --> 42:34.760
Well, Raven, we're going to ask you to help us kind of recap the year here a little bit.

42:34.760 --> 42:36.040
We're going to kind of go month by month.

42:36.040 --> 42:39.440
I'm going to tell you about some of the top stories we went over, and I'd like to hear

42:39.440 --> 42:43.840
your thoughts on what you thought was really the standout story from that month.

42:43.840 --> 42:44.840
Sound good?

42:44.840 --> 42:46.480
Oh, I was waiting for this, yeah.

42:46.480 --> 42:49.000
All right, then we'll get your best and worst game of the year at the end.

42:49.000 --> 42:53.680
So let's take a trip all the way back to January, and January started off with Orange

42:53.680 --> 42:54.680
Honors Radio episode 215.

42:54.680 --> 43:01.160
In episode 215, one of the headlines we talked about was that E3's replacement was announced,

43:01.160 --> 43:06.960
and E3 was going to be replaced with E for All Expo, and of course we say replaced with,

43:06.960 --> 43:07.960
we mean the...

43:07.960 --> 43:08.960
Loosely.

43:08.960 --> 43:12.520
Yeah, kind of loosely, because obviously we had many E3 happen a little later in the year,

43:12.520 --> 43:17.560
but in the very first week of 2007, we learned about the E for All Expo was kind of first

43:17.560 --> 43:18.560
announced.

43:18.560 --> 43:23.720
In episode number 216, the top story from that week was a woman right here in the city

43:23.720 --> 43:28.960
that we broadcast from in Rancho Cordova, California.

43:28.960 --> 43:35.880
The woman died in our local radio station, 107.9's Hold Your Wee for a Wee contest, and

43:35.880 --> 43:40.800
I see Jamie rolled her eyes and sighed when she heard about that.

43:40.800 --> 43:47.760
Why are they rolling me the eyes and sighing, if I wasn't already sick, I'd be sick?

43:47.760 --> 43:51.560
It is a very tragic thing, and I remember that you didn't do a show that week when that

43:51.560 --> 43:52.560
story broke.

43:52.560 --> 43:53.560
That's right.

43:53.560 --> 43:54.560
We only did three shows in January.

43:54.560 --> 43:56.800
I don't remember what happened, but we were off for a week in January.

43:56.800 --> 43:57.800
I was at Disneyland.

43:57.800 --> 43:58.800
You were at Disney...

43:58.800 --> 43:59.800
Oh, we both were at Disneyland.

43:59.800 --> 44:00.800
I was at Disneyland.

44:00.800 --> 44:01.800
That's what it was.

44:01.800 --> 44:03.840
That was my first trip to Disneyland a long time, so we were off, I think it was Martin

44:03.840 --> 44:06.960
Luther King weekend, and that's the weekend it all went down.

44:06.960 --> 44:10.760
You're right, we weren't on that week, and we came back and we were just like, you know,

44:10.760 --> 44:14.920
if you think it's bad on the internet, try living here, where it's all going down.

44:14.920 --> 44:18.960
Sorry, you were doing your little guys on the show, and you recapped it there.

44:18.960 --> 44:26.960
I think that I was just whole surprised that no one had ever heard of drinking too much

44:26.960 --> 44:27.960
water.

44:27.960 --> 44:33.720
It was so funny, because I remember especially in Sacramento, the area where we live, there's

44:33.720 --> 44:35.520
only been so many...

44:35.520 --> 44:36.520
There has not been...

44:36.520 --> 44:38.040
I don't have a number.

44:38.040 --> 44:42.560
There have not been that many water deaths in this country, but there have been multiple

44:42.560 --> 44:46.320
ones in the Sacramento region in the past couple of years, because there was the frat

44:46.320 --> 44:49.080
kid at Chico State, which is where I went to school.

44:49.080 --> 44:50.400
That's only like 90 minutes north of here.

44:50.400 --> 44:53.800
There was that frat kid who, as part of the initiation, had to drink all that water, and

44:53.800 --> 45:01.160
he died of water intoxication, which is what caught the DJs in a lot of fire in the whole

45:01.160 --> 45:05.820
station, which, by the way, unlike I predicted earlier in the year, I believe when the story

45:05.820 --> 45:09.040
first launched, 107.9 is still the end.

45:09.040 --> 45:11.140
It's still owned by the same people.

45:11.140 --> 45:13.080
They have a new morning program in place now.

45:13.080 --> 45:17.360
I don't remember what they're called, but they have other wacky morning DJs on there

45:17.360 --> 45:21.960
doing their thing, and same old stick, but with different people.

45:21.960 --> 45:26.880
Well, I think it was good that the ones that were in charge of that got fired, because

45:26.880 --> 45:33.480
honestly, I guess the majority of people in the world just don't know better.

45:33.480 --> 45:39.880
I'm not going to go into my whole stupid people, including the gene pool thing, but still Darwin's

45:39.880 --> 45:42.680
theory had some merit.

45:42.680 --> 45:46.640
Episode number 217 in January, we only did three shows in January.

45:46.640 --> 45:50.440
Episode 215, one of the top headlines that week was the news channel launched on the

45:50.440 --> 45:52.280
Nintendo Wii.

45:52.280 --> 45:57.440
You might remember when the Nintendo Wii first came out last year, we had the weather channel

45:57.440 --> 45:58.920
was forthcoming in the news channel.

45:58.920 --> 46:03.020
The news channel finally launched in January, and the reason why it's kind of noteworthy

46:03.020 --> 46:09.040
is because it was a game console doing something pretty major other than games.

46:09.040 --> 46:10.720
And it was the news channel.

46:10.720 --> 46:15.760
I have not watched the news channel ever, ever, ever.

46:15.760 --> 46:17.720
Does anybody actually use the news channel?

46:17.720 --> 46:18.720
How about chat?

46:18.720 --> 46:21.520
Does anybody in chat use the news channel?

46:21.520 --> 46:22.520
Complete waste of time.

46:22.520 --> 46:24.200
We should be able to remove that crap.

46:24.200 --> 46:25.960
Raven, do you use the news channel?

46:25.960 --> 46:29.360
I used it when it first came out, and do you remember what the first headline when you

46:29.360 --> 46:31.520
went to technology was?

46:31.520 --> 46:36.200
Was that, wasn't it the woman dying from the Wii, or what?

46:36.200 --> 46:39.280
No, it was the PlayStation 3 launching in Japan, in Europe.

46:39.280 --> 46:40.920
I remember that, that's right.

46:40.920 --> 46:42.920
Wow, you got a good memory, that's right.

46:42.920 --> 46:47.800
I remember I was amused because the first story I brought up in the technology was a

46:47.800 --> 46:49.640
story about the PlayStation 3 launching.

46:49.640 --> 46:54.200
I'm like, I'm reading about the PlayStation 3 on my Wii, this is weird.

46:54.200 --> 46:56.280
Feels like an oxymoron, doesn't it?

46:56.280 --> 46:59.720
Act Def says my brother does use it daily.

46:59.720 --> 47:01.900
Color of Sakura says I have used the channel.

47:01.900 --> 47:05.760
Mac Man says I use the new channel to wipe my ass.

47:05.760 --> 47:08.040
I don't use the channel at all.

47:08.040 --> 47:11.840
I think I looked at it once, and I went like, ah, don't eat it.

47:11.840 --> 47:18.960
I use it once in a while just kind of to spin the globe, and check out, because like sometimes

47:18.960 --> 47:22.840
you really want to know what's going on, and like, you know.

47:22.840 --> 47:26.240
I just want to spin the globe and make everyone dizzy, yay!

47:26.240 --> 47:27.240
Exactly.

47:27.240 --> 47:29.920
Well, Raven, out of those stories, what do you think was probably the most impactful

47:29.920 --> 47:32.480
in the game industry in January, and why?

47:32.480 --> 47:37.160
The one about the Wii water one, when you cold your Wii for a Wii, because that didn't

47:37.160 --> 47:39.960
go away quite fast.

47:39.960 --> 47:43.280
It kept on going, lawsuits, people aren't suing Nintendo, all of that.

47:43.280 --> 47:46.340
Yeah, but everyone forgot about it, like long after.

47:46.340 --> 47:48.080
It lingered like a bad snow.

47:48.080 --> 47:49.080
Seriously.

47:49.080 --> 47:50.080
Just like some other ones.

47:50.080 --> 47:53.280
I don't know, because it seemed like that story came up a couple of times, because then

47:53.280 --> 47:55.480
like, you know, the family was going to sue Nintendo.

47:55.480 --> 47:57.000
I remember that was a big follow-up story.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
Yeah, because they're stupid.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.740
And that's ridiculous, because Nintendo didn't have anything to do with it other than making

48:00.740 --> 48:01.740
the product.

48:01.740 --> 48:05.200
Oh, God, stupid people irritate the shit out of me.

48:05.200 --> 48:08.600
Because they made the product, they engineered the desire for the product.

48:08.600 --> 48:11.480
To be fair, they didn't actually sue Nintendo.

48:11.480 --> 48:16.360
It was an exploratory thing, they were thinking of doing it, and they decided not to, so intelligence

48:16.360 --> 48:17.360
did prevail.

48:17.360 --> 48:18.360
Even considering it is stupid.

48:18.360 --> 48:19.360
All right.

48:19.360 --> 48:21.960
Because they know they'll get anywhere, nowhere with Nintendo.

48:21.960 --> 48:22.960
All right.

48:22.960 --> 48:25.240
Well, Raven, let's go ahead and do another month.

48:25.240 --> 48:29.440
We'll let everybody do two months, because we're kind of low on people tonight, so you

48:29.440 --> 48:32.480
want to continue to adventure with us into February, Raven?

48:32.480 --> 48:33.480
It's fine by me.

48:33.480 --> 48:34.480
All right.

48:34.480 --> 48:36.260
Episode 218 started off February.

48:36.260 --> 48:40.400
A games as porn bill failed in the state of Utah.

48:40.400 --> 48:44.400
Yeah, especially the games they're out now, I would not consider those porn.

48:44.400 --> 48:45.400
Geez.

48:45.400 --> 48:46.400
Yes, that's right.

48:46.400 --> 48:50.640
Utah was going to, at one point, put some of the adult games, basically regulate it

48:50.640 --> 48:52.680
the same way they did porn.

48:52.680 --> 48:53.960
But that bill failed in early January.

48:53.960 --> 48:56.360
That makes absolutely no sense to this day.

48:56.360 --> 48:59.560
I still think to myself, okay, Mario has porn.

48:59.560 --> 49:01.920
That's a great idea, Utah.

49:01.920 --> 49:04.600
Now Manhunt 2, though, is Manhunt 2 porn?

49:04.600 --> 49:05.600
Nope.

49:05.600 --> 49:06.680
To them, it is.

49:06.680 --> 49:08.880
In a way, though, it may not be porn.

49:08.880 --> 49:12.920
But of course, I've said this before, anything you could say about Manhunt 2 and how bad

49:12.920 --> 49:16.680
it is for society, I go, Saw 4.

49:16.680 --> 49:18.280
I'll say this about Manhunt 2.

49:18.280 --> 49:19.280
What?

49:19.280 --> 49:22.520
When I first heard Manhunt 2 was going to release, and when I looked at it, say Nintendo

49:22.520 --> 49:23.880
Wii, I had to do a double shot.

49:23.880 --> 49:27.800
I'm like, it's coming out for the PlayStation 2, PSP, and Nintendo Wii, I'm like, Nintendo

49:27.800 --> 49:28.800
Wii?

49:28.800 --> 49:29.800
All right.

49:29.800 --> 49:34.760
Well, moving on through the month, Episode 219, one of the stick-out stories from that

49:34.760 --> 49:42.240
episode, Codemasters had to replace faulty Bubble Bobble DS cartridges when the boss

49:42.240 --> 49:46.400
in Level 30 didn't fucking show up.

49:46.400 --> 49:48.240
You gotta love it.

49:48.240 --> 49:53.680
And endless jokes for years and years here on this program when that happened.

49:53.680 --> 50:00.160
Episode number 220, an insider in the gaming industry went on to PartnerNet, which is Xbox

50:00.160 --> 50:05.800
Live's kind of staging area for Xbox Live, and spilled the beans on some of the upcoming

50:05.800 --> 50:08.520
releases including Jetpack and Tetris Online.

50:08.520 --> 50:12.600
But what should also be noted is that this news came all the way back from February,

50:12.600 --> 50:17.760
and there were some other game titles that we never saw, like Juiced 2007 and Ob's Pinball.

50:17.760 --> 50:23.160
Of course, a game like Ob's Pinball could have become the Pinball FX game that we did

50:23.160 --> 50:24.160
yet.

50:24.160 --> 50:27.240
Juice 2007 is just Juice 2 Hot Import Nights.

50:27.240 --> 50:34.560
Oh, and it wasn't an actual arcade game or what have you, it was download content for

50:34.560 --> 50:35.560
an existing game.

50:35.560 --> 50:39.640
But nevertheless, this story was important because it was kind of a sign of people on

50:39.640 --> 50:46.480
the inside, you know, kind of spilling the beans and getting all the secrets out there.

50:46.480 --> 50:49.420
Those people suck.

50:49.420 --> 50:54.520
Episode number 221, the last show we did in February, was the week that Warhawk was announced

50:54.520 --> 50:58.080
that it was only going to be a downloadable title on the PlayStation 3.

50:58.080 --> 50:59.080
Well, it was ruined.

50:59.080 --> 51:00.080
Was it ruined?

51:00.080 --> 51:05.760
No, it was confirmed for a while, and then they came back and said, but we're also going

51:05.760 --> 51:09.200
to release it on Blu-Ray with the headset and all this stuff.

51:09.200 --> 51:12.960
So that was the week, though, that Warhawk was originally announced as a download-only

51:12.960 --> 51:19.280
title, which was big because, you know, obviously this was one of the games that Sony was pushing

51:19.280 --> 51:22.080
and pushing when they first showed off the PlayStation 3.

51:22.080 --> 51:25.480
And for this to kind of go back, you know, and say, well, we're just going to make it

51:25.480 --> 51:27.080
a download-only game was kind of...

51:27.080 --> 51:29.240
Six axis, all that stuff was going to be in it.

51:29.240 --> 51:34.160
I'll never forget when they were showing off the six axis and he was trying to land the

51:34.160 --> 51:38.760
jet on, like, the actual carrier thing, and it almost, like, tipped it off the edge of

51:38.760 --> 51:41.160
the cliff because he didn't land it right.

51:41.160 --> 51:42.160
That's hilarious.

51:42.160 --> 51:43.920
That's what I'll remember, Warhawk.

51:43.920 --> 51:49.800
All right, so Raven, we have Games as Porn in Utah, Bubble Bobble broken, PartnerNet

51:49.800 --> 51:53.800
spills the beans, and Warhawk download-only on PlayStation 3.

51:53.800 --> 51:56.920
What do you think had the most impact from February, the longest lasting impression on

51:56.920 --> 51:58.880
2007 for gaming?

51:58.880 --> 52:01.860
Of course, Bubble Bobble, how do you expect?

52:01.860 --> 52:06.400
There's a game that the bosses show up, you're like, well, like, come on, boss, come out,

52:06.400 --> 52:08.720
I need you, and you just never showed up.

52:08.720 --> 52:13.080
Or how about the fact that, did anybody test this game?

52:13.080 --> 52:16.120
There's no testers in Codemasters, that's hilarious.

52:16.120 --> 52:19.600
Apparently not, and it's kind of sad because I have a lot of friends who have been game

52:19.600 --> 52:23.240
testers that do very good jobs, you know, for various companies that they've worked

52:23.240 --> 52:27.840
for, and it was just kind of sad when, you know, this kind of gave game testers everywhere

52:27.840 --> 52:30.720
a bad name that something like this slipped through the cracks.

52:30.720 --> 52:35.880
But obviously this was management cutting corners to meet some deadlines, and probably

52:35.880 --> 52:39.600
the game did not go through the extensive testing it should have, right?

52:39.600 --> 52:45.720
Yeah, but it just, to me, it just boggles the mind how the boss never showed up.

52:45.720 --> 52:48.120
I mean, how do you miss that?

52:48.120 --> 52:49.120
I don't know.

52:49.120 --> 52:50.120
Good question.

52:50.120 --> 52:53.680
Chat Room and Loki and Dark Soccer, do you guys agree with Raven's picks?

52:53.680 --> 52:57.200
You think the Wii for a Wii and the Bubble Bobble were probably the biggest stories out

52:57.200 --> 52:58.200
of those months?

52:58.200 --> 52:59.200
Yeah.

52:59.200 --> 53:00.200
Yeah, I guess.

53:00.200 --> 53:01.200
Yeah.

53:01.200 --> 53:02.200
All right.

53:02.200 --> 53:07.600
Well, Raven, while we get the Chat Room's impressions of your picks there, why don't

53:07.600 --> 53:12.080
you tell us what, in your opinion, and you can use any criteria you want, you don't have

53:12.080 --> 53:15.280
to listen to what the critics say or what anybody else says but yourself, what, in your

53:15.280 --> 53:21.520
opinion, was the worst game of 2007, the game that everybody should stay the hell away from?

53:21.520 --> 53:24.000
Please stay the hell away of this one game.

53:24.000 --> 53:28.200
I swear to you, it's free, but it's not even more free.

53:28.200 --> 53:30.320
Yaris for the 360.

53:30.320 --> 53:31.320
Just stay away.

53:31.320 --> 53:34.760
Toyota Yaris on the 360, the worst game of 2007.

53:34.760 --> 53:38.040
Free and the robotic claw didn't do anything for you?

53:38.040 --> 53:39.040
Oh my God.

53:39.040 --> 53:40.800
I want my time back.

53:40.800 --> 53:41.800
I don't want my money.

53:41.800 --> 53:44.480
I want my time back for that.

53:44.480 --> 53:47.840
Best game of 2007, in your opinion, Raven?

53:47.840 --> 53:48.960
Just one?

53:48.960 --> 53:49.960
Just one.

53:49.960 --> 53:53.100
You can tell us what some of your runner-ups would be, but we just want to know your number

53:53.100 --> 53:54.100
one game.

53:54.100 --> 53:55.100
That's the only one we're writing down.

53:55.100 --> 53:56.100
Let's see.

53:56.100 --> 53:57.100
I guess I'll go with Galaxy.

53:57.100 --> 54:00.160
I really enjoy that.

54:00.160 --> 54:01.160
I really enjoy it.

54:01.160 --> 54:06.120
Even one of those games that just shows off the Wii and just puts everything in a nice

54:06.120 --> 54:10.520
package going, Nintendo did something.

54:10.520 --> 54:11.880
Anything kind of close for you?

54:11.880 --> 54:15.600
Oh, there's a lot of things close, like Bioshock and Call of Duty 4.

54:15.600 --> 54:17.320
You can't complain with those.

54:17.320 --> 54:19.640
Overall, was it a good year for games, Ravenstaufen?

54:19.640 --> 54:22.280
Overall, it's a great year for games.

54:22.280 --> 54:23.760
I compare it to 2004.

54:23.760 --> 54:27.400
What was so hot about 2004, remind us?

54:27.400 --> 54:29.560
We had Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas.

54:29.560 --> 54:30.760
We had Halo 2.

54:30.760 --> 54:33.320
We had Half-Life 2.

54:33.320 --> 54:35.280
We had God of War 1.

54:35.280 --> 54:36.840
All those games came out in that year.

54:36.840 --> 54:37.840
All right.

54:37.840 --> 54:40.760
Well, Ravenstaufen, thanks so much for reflecting on the year with us.

54:40.760 --> 54:42.560
We appreciate it, all right?

54:42.560 --> 54:43.880
Thank you for having me on.

54:43.880 --> 54:44.880
You are welcome, sir.

54:44.880 --> 54:45.880
I appreciate it.

54:45.880 --> 54:46.880
Best of luck in 2008.

54:46.880 --> 54:48.440
We'll continue to hear from you in the year, right?

54:48.440 --> 54:49.440
You bet.

54:49.440 --> 54:50.440
All right.

54:50.440 --> 54:51.440
Take care, buddy.

54:51.440 --> 54:52.440
Bye.

54:52.440 --> 54:57.160
If you want to give us a call and help us out in March and April, give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

54:57.160 --> 55:05.280
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, and I'm trying to look at some of the comments

55:05.280 --> 55:06.280
in the chat room here.

55:06.280 --> 55:10.960
DarkZombie says, I demand Yaris 2 for Xbox Live Arcade.

55:10.960 --> 55:13.400
ShadowSlayer says, Bubble Bobble is the best game ever.

55:13.400 --> 55:17.640
I'm assuming he means the original, not the newer one.

55:17.640 --> 55:20.560
Let's go to the phones and see who's going to join us for the next part of the show.

55:20.560 --> 55:21.560
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

55:21.560 --> 55:22.560
Who's this?

55:22.560 --> 55:25.400
This is DJ Darknight in house.

55:25.400 --> 55:26.840
Hey, DJ Darknight.

55:26.840 --> 55:27.840
How are you doing, my friend?

55:27.840 --> 55:28.840
I'm all right.

55:28.840 --> 55:30.560
How about y'all guys tonight?

55:30.560 --> 55:31.560
I am excellent.

55:31.560 --> 55:32.560
Hi.

55:32.560 --> 55:36.960
So, Darknight, are you ready to reflect on some of the previous months here in 2007?

55:36.960 --> 55:40.840
Yeah, I wanted to kind of follow up on that bubble ball thing, but it might be a little

55:40.840 --> 55:41.840
bit later on.

55:41.840 --> 55:42.840
Go ahead.

55:42.840 --> 55:43.840
Go ahead, sir.

55:43.840 --> 55:50.280
There was another DS game that had that same problem, and it was SNK versus Capcom Car

55:50.280 --> 55:51.280
Fighter.

55:51.280 --> 55:54.480
Yeah, the one card that wouldn't... Yeah, I remember that.

55:54.480 --> 55:57.240
And get past the thing because the game would lock up or something.

55:57.240 --> 56:00.280
Like a card didn't... Yeah, a card froze the game or something.

56:00.280 --> 56:01.280
That's right.

56:01.280 --> 56:05.680
So, it was interesting that that bubble ball thing kind of started to trend, sadly.

56:05.680 --> 56:06.680
Yeah.

56:06.680 --> 56:07.680
All right.

56:07.680 --> 56:10.520
That one really hurt everybody for a while.

56:10.520 --> 56:15.080
Hopefully lessons learned by all gaming companies in regards to testing your games for 2008.

56:15.080 --> 56:17.880
Well, let's talk about March and April.

56:17.880 --> 56:24.120
Starting off in March, episode number 222 kicked off March, and that was when Sony actually

56:24.120 --> 56:25.640
... This happened a little bit before.

56:25.640 --> 56:31.100
The details were leaked before the Game Developers Conference, but episode 222, the first week

56:31.100 --> 56:34.520
of March was when we really started getting the details on PlayStation Home.

56:34.520 --> 56:38.680
And I think the thing about PlayStation Home was it kind of made our collective jaws drop

56:38.680 --> 56:42.600
a little bit because at this point, a lot of us had really written off the PlayStation

56:42.600 --> 56:45.720
3 as the joke of this generation.

56:45.720 --> 56:49.720
And then when PlayStation Home was announced, a lot of us kind of turned our heads and went,

56:49.720 --> 56:50.720
really?

56:50.720 --> 56:51.720
Really now?

56:51.720 --> 56:52.720
This looks interesting.

56:52.720 --> 56:53.720
Yeah, it looks interesting.

56:53.720 --> 56:54.720
I wish it would come out now.

56:54.720 --> 56:55.720
Yeah.

56:55.720 --> 56:56.720
Someday.

56:56.720 --> 57:00.120
Of course, now as we know, the damn thing still hasn't come out, but as I said before,

57:00.120 --> 57:01.920
I think Sony's spreading themselves too thin.

57:01.920 --> 57:06.280
I think Home is still a great idea, and I can't wait to see it in 2008 or whenever it

57:06.280 --> 57:07.280
finally comes out.

57:07.280 --> 57:08.280
Yeah.

57:08.280 --> 57:09.280
I don't know.

57:09.280 --> 57:13.960
Dark Knight, do you think PlayStation Home is worthy of selling PlayStation 3s?

57:13.960 --> 57:14.960
I don't know.

57:14.960 --> 57:17.240
I mean, it's a good idea.

57:17.240 --> 57:23.640
They try to give some second life feel to it and everything like that, but I don't think

57:23.640 --> 57:24.640
it'll do it.

57:24.640 --> 57:25.640
I don't think it'll work.

57:25.640 --> 57:27.040
I don't think it'll do much good.

57:27.040 --> 57:29.880
We'll see in 2008 when the thing finally comes out.

57:29.880 --> 57:34.000
People like making their avatars and stuff, and to be honest, I wish Home was something

57:34.000 --> 57:39.040
that Nintendo was doing with the Miis, because I think that would have really launched that

57:39.040 --> 57:40.040
console.

57:40.040 --> 57:42.920
I mean, not that they really needed any help selling the console, but it would have launched

57:42.920 --> 57:45.840
it even further had they had difficulty or anything like that.

57:45.840 --> 57:46.840
Yeah.

57:46.840 --> 57:50.280
It would have worked on Nintendo maybe, but like I said, I can't see it as Sony.

57:50.280 --> 57:51.280
It may have worked.

57:51.280 --> 57:52.280
It would have worked on Nintendo.

57:52.280 --> 57:55.880
But Home, I think, is one of those things, though, it looks good on paper, but I don't

57:55.880 --> 57:58.520
know how it's actually going to translate once they've built it.

57:58.520 --> 57:59.520
Yeah.

57:59.520 --> 58:03.480
Well, let's move on with March, episode number 223.

58:03.480 --> 58:07.720
Microsoft upped the arcade limit and subsequently the memory card sizes.

58:07.720 --> 58:11.800
You might remember Xbox Live arcade games were limited to 50 megabytes, and at the Game

58:11.800 --> 58:15.240
Developers Conference, I believe, Microsoft announced that they were going to be upping

58:15.240 --> 58:19.740
the arcade limit, which allowed some more titles to come out that were much bigger,

58:19.740 --> 58:23.080
such as Castlevania Symphony of the Night, I believe, was the first one that broke the

58:23.080 --> 58:24.080
50 meg limit.

58:24.080 --> 58:26.200
It was something like 90 megs.

58:26.200 --> 58:31.680
And obviously, the memory card sizes had to be upgraded as well, which I certainly don't

58:31.680 --> 58:34.200
think anybody sees this as a bad decision by Microsoft.

58:34.200 --> 58:36.760
It was probably one they should have made a while ago.

58:36.760 --> 58:39.780
Why they ever limited it in the first place was a little weird, but I guess it was because

58:39.780 --> 58:40.780
of the memory cards.

58:40.780 --> 58:45.360
Yeah, because I mean, and I don't think that many people actually bought them, like talking

58:45.360 --> 58:46.360
about it.

58:46.360 --> 58:50.400
Most of the people bought the 512 one only because it came with geometry wars in it.

58:50.400 --> 58:52.640
Oh, I guess that's a good point.

58:52.640 --> 58:56.440
Or you know, you just, you have the core and the memory cards all you need.

58:56.440 --> 59:00.320
Like you know, I think most of the hardcore gamers like you and I and probably most of

59:00.320 --> 59:04.520
the people that, you know, seek out gaming podcasts and therefore listen to this program,

59:04.520 --> 59:07.340
we probably all understand why you need a hard drive.

59:07.340 --> 59:11.800
But for those people that bought their Xbox 360s just so they could play Madden, you know,

59:11.800 --> 59:15.940
have it be their party machine, I suppose, you know, memory cards are what they're going

59:15.940 --> 59:18.440
to buy because that's what they're used to from PlayStation.

59:18.440 --> 59:19.440
Right.

59:19.440 --> 59:20.440
Right.

59:20.440 --> 59:25.480
Well, and plus, like I said, the last system I remember, you know, the other system I had

59:25.480 --> 59:29.060
that had a hard drive in it was the Sega Saturn.

59:29.060 --> 59:33.240
So it was kind of like a take back when it saw that the 360, the newer systems would

59:33.240 --> 59:34.240
have that.

59:34.240 --> 59:35.960
What about the old school Xbox, though?

59:35.960 --> 59:38.560
The first Xbox, they all had hard drives built in.

59:38.560 --> 59:39.560
Yeah.

59:39.560 --> 59:40.560
Oh, yeah, that's right.

59:40.560 --> 59:41.560
I forgot they did.

59:41.560 --> 59:42.560
Yeah.

59:42.560 --> 59:43.560
Xbox One had hard drive.

59:43.560 --> 59:48.120
Ironically enough, Xbox One didn't really use the hard drive, though, like it should

59:48.120 --> 59:49.120
have.

59:49.120 --> 59:54.720
It almost seems like Microsoft, when they originally conceptualized the original Xbox,

59:54.720 --> 59:57.720
wanted to do some of the things from the very beginning that they didn't do until the Xbox

59:57.720 --> 59:58.720
360.

59:58.720 --> 59:59.720
It almost feels like that way.

59:59.720 --> 01:00:00.720
Right?

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:01.720
Yeah.

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:02.720
I don't know.

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.720
I mean, it's just me.

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:04.720
Of course.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:05.720
I think most of the people used it just to record music.

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:08.600
Just use their music and play CDs and whatnot and save it to the hard drive.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.520
That's really all you could use it for.

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:11.520
Yeah.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.520
Well.

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:13.520
Don't think.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.520
Yeah.

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:17.880
Episode number 224 in March was pretty epic.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:24.360
I swear to God, I looked at the list of stories we covered that week, and this really was

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:29.840
the one that kind of stuck out as the most relevant to what was going on in the games

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:31.440
industry in general at that time.

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:37.320
That is, episode 224 was the week that Loki revealed on this very program that there was

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:41.240
a game coming out called Beautiful Katamari that was going to be coming out later in the

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.240
year.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:48.160
And the reason why I picked that is not necessarily the announcement itself, but all the fall

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.160
out.

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:50.160
The backlash.

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:55.600
The backlash that came from that because it definitely kind of showed A, can the independent

01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:01.400
media be trusted, and who are these guys, and dah, dah, dah, and kind of B, when Namco

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:05.480
obviously, as most people know, it's not a very big secret now, now that the game's out,

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:09.740
I think we can talk a little more openly about this, Namco putteth the smacketh down a little

01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:14.920
bit and there wasn't a lot we could do because we are an independent organization, because

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:19.880
this is something that is run out of our spare times, and because of the fact that we don't

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:26.580
have the mogul media companies to back us up and say, we're going to go fight you in

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:29.240
court over this, freedom of the press, blah, blah, blah.

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:32.760
We had to run away with our tail between our legs, and it kind of sucked.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:36.600
It was, like I said, it wasn't the first time, remember the controversy with Kotaku and Sony

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:41.840
and how they said something about Sony, and Sony threatened to basically stop backing

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:47.520
them, and the community was up in arms about it, and they was up in arms about it, and

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:52.200
Sony was like, okay, okay, okay, we'll bend, we'll bend, we'll bend.

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:56.720
It hurt, it was just, nothing's worse than a community scorn.

01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:03.440
But unfortunately, we don't have that same oomph that Kotaku has, it just kind of sucks,

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:08.560
but it definitely was a very interesting thing to watch, I'm sure, you know, it was a hell

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:11.680
of a thing to see from the inside, I'm sure on the outside it was probably pretty interesting

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:12.680
too.

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:13.680
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.680
Like I said, I mean, I do my own show, and I'm just like, oh, own show, I'm kind of sketchy

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:21.240
on most of the release news, I'm like, eh, do I want to really touch that or no?

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:25.880
Hey, I figured it's not that important anymore, especially since all the releases changed

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:27.920
so much anyways.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:30.680
But I guess for whatever reason, they were really trying to keep that under wraps.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.400
Yeah, they were really trying to keep under wraps.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.840
Well, they didn't do a very good job, or we wouldn't have found it.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:38.040
Yeah, they were really, they should really keep it under wraps that a PlayStation 3 and

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:40.600
Wii version are coming out in April, that would really hurt.

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.600
Welcome!

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.600
You're awesome.

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:43.600
We're going to jail.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:44.600
Alright.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:49.960
Views and opinions expressed by Loki, please don't sue us.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:54.160
Episode number 225, there was one more episode that came out in March, and that was the episode

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:59.320
where Devil May Cry 4 was announced that it will no longer be a PlayStation 3 exclusive,

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:05.040
and obviously that had a big impact because that kind of left Metal Gear Solid 4 and Final

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:12.040
Fantasy 13 as the only real triple-A, super-grade-A PlayStation 3 exclusives left.

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:16.080
I mean, this was huge the week that this one was announced, because it was like, oh my

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:20.440
gosh, one of the big three just jumped ship, and it's now going to be Xbox 360.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:24.240
And now, flashing forward to where we're at now, not only is it also coming out on the

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:29.920
Xbox 360, but they're making bundles out of it in Japan, the whole Devil May Cry bundles

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.560
now are coming out.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.400
Devil May Cry for 360 if he doesn't get one.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:42.080
I mean, don't get me wrong, I saw a preview of the game in it, it's going to look good.

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:44.040
It does look pretty awesome, I'm going to have to check it out.

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:47.560
I've never really followed the Devil May Cry series that closely, but this game may have

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.560
to make me change my mind.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:53.160
It has one thing going for it so far, the return of Trish.

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.640
Jamie's happy.

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:59.800
All right, well, Dark Knight, out of those four stories, the unveiling of PlayStation

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:05.040
Home, Microsoft upping the arcade limit, beautiful Katamari being spoiled by us, and Devil May

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.520
Cry 4 no longer being a PlayStation 3 exclusive.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:10.640
Which one do you think had the most impact in 2007?

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:16.720
I'd say the Katamari spoiler thing, because like I said, it was just basically eye-opening

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:21.840
to everybody that let them know that, yeah, this really not only could affect the big

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:26.760
guys but it could affect the money guys and leak a story like that and have somebody go,

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.220
no, you might want to...

01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:33.520
And I know because of our announcement, those sales of Katamari have been so horrible just

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:37.120
because of our announcement.

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.360
You know what's weird?

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.880
I actually wouldn't have picked the same story myself.

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:41.880
I wouldn't have.

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:44.680
I would have went with the Devil May Cry story, but that's all right.

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:49.400
I mean, like I said, when I heard the aftermath about it, I was stunned.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:56.680
I was like, wow, but it did kind of show that y'all had enough clout to get that much attention.

01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:59.520
All right, well, there you have it.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.520
Loki, Dark Soccer, do you agree?

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.080
Was that the biggest story in March?

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:07.220
Were we the biggest story in March, or are we just being egotistical here?

01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:09.400
I agree actually with the Devil May Cry thing.

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.520
You think Devil May Cry was a weird story?

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:13.520
I don't know about Devil May Cry 4.

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:18.960
I'm like, yeah, Devil May Cry 4 is on 360 and PS3, oh, good for them.

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:26.680
I think that it's more or less the total public recognition by another company that, well,

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.780
maybe the PlayStation 3 is a piece of shit.

01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:30.780
That's what it was for me, too.

01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:33.360
I would have worded that strongly, but yes.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.760
We want people to actually buy our game, so we're going to put it on a system that people

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:37.760
are buying.

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:40.960
I think that's what it was for me, is that that's the way I would phrase it, is that

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:44.280
it was really a company kind of acknowledging, hmm, Sony ain't selling the way we thought

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:45.280
it would.

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.040
We're going to have to go put this game out on Microsoft as well.

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:52.520
Or they figured out, hey, guess what, it isn't that hard to develop for the 360 and the PlayStation

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:53.880
3 at the same time.

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:55.360
Pretty easy to port the code over.

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:56.360
Let's do that.

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:57.360
Exactly.

01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:58.360
All right.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:02.880
I went through a bonus one and said basically, um, Stranglehold having so much expectation

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:04.280
it ended up being a bust.

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:07.960
Oh, that's right, Stranglehold was released in March, huh, I remember that.

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:08.960
No wonder.

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:09.960
Was it?

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:10.960
Was it?

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:11.960
Was it March or later?

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:12.960
I think it was in the Sunday release.

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:13.960
That was in like September and October.

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:14.960
Was it?

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:15.960
Yeah.

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:16.960
But it seemed like this game, like it was at E3.

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:19.400
Like a year and a half ago.

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.400
And then, all right.

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:26.080
It was supposed to be like a release title for the 360 at one point the way they showed

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.080
it.

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:30.960
I probably was originally supposed to come out in March and got delayed that whole time.

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:31.960
That might be true, but.

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:32.960
All right.

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:33.960
Well, anyway.

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:34.960
Let's talk about April.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:40.040
Episode 226 kicked off April and one of the top stories from that episode was the announcement

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:44.400
that Sonic and Mario were going to be teaming up for a new game, Mario and Sonic at the

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.560
Olympics.

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.560
And nobody cared.

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.560
Dared.

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:48.560
Well, hold on.

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:49.560
Exactly.

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:53.120
Now they don't because after the game came out, I don't think most people cared anymore,

01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:56.280
but the week this was announced, this was huge news.

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:59.560
That's kind of why I bring this up because people were like, OMG, Sonic and Mario.

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:03.060
But now, you know, obviously since then, we've had Sonic be announced in Brawl and all that

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:04.120
stuff too.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:08.540
You know, it's not such a big deal, but at the time, it was like, OMG, my childhood,

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:13.280
you know, fantasies in some way or, you know, the thing you never thought would happen is

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.280
happening.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.280
Sonic and Mario in the same game.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.280
True.

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:17.920
That was a big announcement.

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:21.240
Episode number 227 in April, that was the week that Rock Band was announced and that

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:24.000
was probably our biggest story we talked about that week because obviously Rock Band was

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:30.000
a very ambitious game that ended up on many people's game of the year list for 2007.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Will it end up on ours?

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000
We'll see.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:37.160
But yeah, Rock Band was announced that week and, you know, I think to an extent, I think

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:18.460
the reason why this was noteworthy is that for us, especially here at Orange

01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:34.720
that was a big announcement.

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.880
And that was probably our biggest story we talked about that week because obviously Rock

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:40.720
Band was a very ambitious game that ended up on many people's game of the year list

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.520
for 2007.

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:46.360
a lot of us were caught off guard at just how ambitious this game was because

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.800
I think for a lot of us I don't know about you guys but for me I was like

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:53.600
they're gonna do guitar, drums, and singing like all in one game that's it

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:57.520
was like it's kind of it was like a big thing because I I would think that

01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:00.680
nobody would have never thought of something like this being conjoined

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:06.400
together for one game other than like the drum mania guitar freaks thing right

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:08.940
and I think that's what it was for me is that you know obviously had guitar

01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:12.440
freaks drum mania keyboard mania in the arcades years ago it just kind of

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:16.320
surprised me that it was like whoa somebody's actually gonna try and do

01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:19.360
this in the US and they are gonna put it all in one game and they're gonna put it

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:23.800
all in one box and see if it sells that's that is fucking ambitious right

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:30.080
there. And the ultimate kicker was they had a singing part to it

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:34.560
and that was the ultimate kicker the ultimate breakdown was that you put

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:39.480
singing into it it was like a big it was like a big deal especially with the

01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:46.360
populated karaoke games. All right. Hey, Loki, say hey. episode number 228 a story that

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:50.680
definitely stuck out for us in episode 228 a woman who played on the game World

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:56.960
of Warcraft posted an ad on Craigslist offering sex to get the gold to buy her

01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:01.800
epic mount that's right it was the woman who will make an epic mount for an epic

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:06.120
mount that's right she was the woman who would mount for a mount and obviously

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:09.240
enough said here I mean this got people talking about you know where do you draw

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:13.320
the freaking line seriously I mean this this had a lot of people talking about I

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:18.120
would I would be curious what that woman's up to now like you know did she

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:22.040
do it again? I got one to top of that actually I think I've never talked about it how

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:26.720
about once I mean what probably has happened an Australian lady met a young

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:32.640
teenager online through W.I.L.B. paid her way to come to America to visit him

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:36.120
I remember I do remember hearing about this I think we might have covered this

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:40.320
on the show but yeah it's similar it's a similar story yeah in some ways just

01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:44.760
crazy what some people get into on Wow but you know I gotta say as a World of

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.440
Warcraft player those epic mounts really are a bitch to get I mean I almost am

01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:53.560
ready to put out to get one and that's why I don't touch that game not really

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:57.800
though I'm just kidding all right and then episode 229 was the last episode we

01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:01.560
taped in April it actually must have been a slow news week because the top

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:05.160
story I pulled from that one is that the PlayStation I was officially announced

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:08.760
but actually I think the reason why this is relevant is because obviously you

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:14.280
know a lot of us are kind of wondering you know Sony showed this off at you

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:19.120
know e3 and it disappeared for the longest time we never heard anything

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:22.440
about the eye of judgment and suddenly out of nowhere bam here it is the

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:25.280
PlayStation eyes coming out and I think this might have been the episode where

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:28.560
Loki made the bet I don't remember it might have been over the summer it was

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:32.280
later late all right but regardless the PlayStation I was officially announced

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:38.880
in episode 229 so I mean like it just it seemed like the news was pretty slow I

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:43.840
think what I'm trying to remember when I debut because I think I did I think I

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:49.720
was working on that when I was like guys not much gaming this week hey it

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.800
happens sometimes when you do we show sometimes that's why we play games

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:57.200
sometimes that was a match game week all right anyway Dark Knight I'm out of

01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.840
those four stories Sonic and Mario team up rock band announced a woman in World

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:04.080
of Warcraft puts out for her mount and the PlayStation I officially announced

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:08.120
what do you think had the biggest impact in gaming from April uh I would probably

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:13.200
have to say at first I was thinking about the Mario and Sonic thing but to

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:18.320
be honest I think the World of Warcraft ain't just me on the grounds of it

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:24.800
involved it involves sex for legal prostitution yeah yeah basically she

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:27.960
said right virtually you're picking it because it's a story that involves sex

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:36.120
which is fine but it is it is kind of an instance of taking your games way way

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:40.680
way too seriously right I mean like other than what happened later on in the

01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:44.920
years that made it worse and brought everything back ahead again I think the

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:48.360
reason why that is important to gaming in general in 2007 because I think

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:51.680
ninety nine point nine percent of people looked at that story and went I don't

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:56.160
want that to be me ever like even the most hardcore gamers were like I do not

01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:01.520
want that to be me ever a way to keep us in check all right but here's the

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:05.880
kicker though yeah I hate to bring political politics into this but mm-hmm

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:09.600
I don't know if y'all heard but apparently a presidential candidate done

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:17.200
scheduled a parade and Wow it was recently this is recent or I think it's

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:23.640
a recent Ron Paul riffing interesting Ron Paul was going to Ron Paul

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.120
apparently he got some people or somebody might set it up I don't know

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:33.480
apparently he got they're gonna do like a little campaigning parade on Wow I

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:38.480
forgot what thinking from Iron Forge to some area and whatnot and I was like

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:43.560
wow they definitely they definitely having the goal to go for this one I

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:47.760
remember jokingly said um great if this pulls off they're gonna win the nerd

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:54.160
vote Wow no I know it's gonna be a hell of a year honestly this is about as cool

01:12:54.160 --> 01:13:07.600
as dr. evil in Austin Powers I'm hip I'm cool he's like look see I'm hippie cool

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:15.240
I know what World of Warcraft is vote for me I mean that's pretty much it look

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:19.120
how easy you can piss the gamers off you know and there's a lot of gamers over 18

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:22.860
who are voters you know somebody like you know Hillary Clinton you know she's

01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:25.760
a big presidential candidate she's pissed a lot of people off with her

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:29.360
stance and she kind of remember she backtracked like earlier in the year she

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:32.440
was kind of more anti-video game and then she kind of came out and supported

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:36.120
the ESRB a little later and said you know we've done a lot of work and that

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:43.120
it uh it's very interesting and then when I was waiting for your vote well I

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:46.360
can say is 2008 it's gonna be a hell of a year with the election going on and

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:50.560
everything dark knight let's let's hear it what do you think in your opinion was

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:55.960
the worst game of 2007 I had to agree with Davis dolphin animals yards I

01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:00.460
played it once and never touched it again or base that I basically gave it

01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:05.000
the what the hell was I smoking when I played this game award there you go well

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.980
in your opinion what was the hands-down above all best freaking game of 2007

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:18.000
guys so many games but I had to go with Call of Duty 4 because the game basically

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.520
could the big game could basically be turned into a movie by itself you

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:24.200
wouldn't need no actors that you wouldn't need no actors or anything like

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:29.440
that just put the game in let it run its course it's the Oscar hit I think as I'd

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:34.160
heard somebody describe Call of Duty 4 it's just fucking epic it is it's just

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:40.040
fucking epic talk to best best person that asked about that talk to Travis I

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:46.160
will I will he's a veteran he'll tell you which by the way Travis was here

own year and wrap up uh yeah we pretty much finished our shows for the year

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:08.360
we're going on hiatus for the new year so I can get inebriated at least and

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:14.000
but we'll be picking up next year I think the first weekend in January will

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.600
be starting up again so I gotta pass a message along to footy monster I don't

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:20.180
know if he's listening tonight or what but footy monster obviously one of the

01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:23.280
other co-hosts on over on ultimate quest which is a fellow all games affiliate

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:27.080
including us we broadcast on all games Monday nights and Tuesday mornings I

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:32.320
gotta say this there is a new addition to our co-host in the back and you can

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:35.480
only see him on operator 11 when we're up in the feeds over for right now but

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:39.600
when it comes back up notice this we have a new penguin in the back it's a

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:44.920
little blow-up penguin that penguin is actually from Argentina my by roommate

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:47.760
sister was just there in Argentina and brought me back this blow-up penguin

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:50.840
that I guess was in some type of snowboard shop and his name is Guido the

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:53.680
penguin and she photographed him at all these beautiful places throughout

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:56.920
Argentina and gave me the little book for Christmas along with the blow-up

01:16:56.920 --> 01:17:00.160
penguin I thought it was just such a creative gift it's awesome so that's

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:03.320
pretty cool I'm not sure to pass that message along I thought footy would get

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:07.120
a kick out of that because sometimes you know Argentina is a huge fucking country

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:10.840
but it doesn't get mentioned enough usually and you know because because the

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:15.720
gaming scene just isn't it isn't what it is here there you know what I mean it's

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:19.440
not it is very different as very because he lets us know very much so on the

01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:23.640
show all right well enough about people who aren't here let's talk about the

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:29.320
year in review and talk a little bit about did you kill the fly Loki thank

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:34.200
you no there's there has been two flies in here bugging the shit out of us all

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:37.480
night long we're about ready to scream all right anyway sorry to rail a little

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:43.360
bit let's talk about may may started off with episode number 230 PETA got pissed

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:48.640
off and PETA not of course the type of PETA that you eat but PETA being the

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:53.040
people for ethical treatment of animals they got pissed off here's why they got

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:56.800
pissed off do you remember when Sony did their God of War promotion in Europe and

01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:02.560
they actually killed a live goat yeah man muttons good for you oh my gosh and

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:05.760
PETA of understandably was pissed off about that and the rest of us were

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:10.000
wondering what the F were they thinking having the I don't know if I don't think

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.360
they actually killed the goat live but they had the dead goat like everywhere

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:19.520
and it was just kind of like what the crap are you people thinking yep it was

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:23.040
pretty humorous it's like they were did he at least make mutton or stew out of

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:25.560
it or anything he just had a dead carcass right there smelling of the

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:30.720
place mm-hmm mm-hmm awesome Oh at footy monsters actually in Chad he just he

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:36.680
just said something about Guido that's funny anyway sorry I got distracted all

01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:41.120
right episode number 231 hey you'd like this as a roleplay fan one of the

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:45.400
stories that stuck out from episode 231 Final Fantasy 4 was announced that it

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:49.600
was going to be remade for the DS and not just you know this is much different

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.160
from what Squeenix had been doing with the past Final Fantasy games and

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:56.480
releasing them but they were going to remake all of Final Fantasy 4 similar to

01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:00.880
how they did with Final Fantasy 3 and now the game is out in Japan we're still

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:06.360
waiting for it here in the u.s. but certainly I had people thinking you know

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:09.040
different ways about that what do you think about the Final Fantasy 4 remake

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:14.160
on the DS well I'm all for the remakes when they switch to another console that

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:17.840
was not previously and they're just gonna you know print more money once it

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:22.560
gets released over there but there's some news with the sequel but I won't go

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:27.200
too much into that but it's a it's a win for Nintendo so why not I I you know and

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:31.560
I was I was very hesitant about this I was like oh god this is like my favorite

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:35.440
Final Fantasy game I'm like one of a very few amount of people where Final

01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:38.720
Fantasy 4 really is like my favorite Final Fantasy game and that probably is

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:42.400
mostly sentimental value go in there but it really is like my favorite one and

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:46.680
I'm just like please please Square Enix do not fuck this up but then when I saw

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:49.560
the you know screen caps and the previews I'm like wow this actually

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:53.720
looks pretty awesome yep so the cane stragoon jump for the win yeah looking

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:58.600
for oh it's gonna be great episode 232 big week for PC gamers because that was

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:03.240
the week that Starcraft 2 was announced and Blizzard reviving one of their

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:06.120
franchises they've been a little bit dormant I mean obviously we had the

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:09.800
rumors of Starcraft ghosts years ago and everybody kind of thought you know this

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:12.600
had to come eventually and finally it arrived in May the announcement of

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:20.240
Starcraft 2 episode 233 was the one we taped live at Fonami and that was the

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:26.200
week that the Super Smash Brothers brawl news really started to pour in and

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:29.640
namely this is the one that was revealed that they were gonna be having tons of

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:33.640
returning musicians you basically had all these people that had contributed to

01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:37.440
other Nintendo games we're gonna be creating songs for Super Smash Brothers

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:41.520
and remaking your old classics and you know obviously you can hear a lot of it

01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:46.960
on the official Smash Brothers site and just a lot of good stuff I mean it do

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:48.800
you think brawls gonna live up to the hype

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:54.440
Xenocore that's a rough one cuz it is getting quite a lot of hype I mean it

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:59.200
just whenever I start seeing games advertise this much I just expect it to

01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:03.360
fall short a certain degree just you know just from process of elimination

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:06.420
over the years you know whenever again gets hyped up and always fall short one

01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:10.360
or two spots so if it does I'm gonna be surprised but if it does not then all

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:14.720
better and you know especially if it is true what Loki said earlier you know and

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:18.040
it does turn to be true that the game gets delayed another month it's gonna

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:22.240
have to be that much better to make it worth all they're gonna yeah that's a

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:25.480
first-party game so it's not gonna get relate release when it's complete crap

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:29.520
there's no way true true well okay out of those stories of PETA and the God of

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:33.960
War go go Final Fantasy 4 remake Starcraft 2 announced and Super Smash

01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:37.200
Brothers revealed what do you think was the story that had the biggest impact in

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:40.840
gaming or if you have something else you want to throw in there go for it no

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:45.600
mainly I'd go with the the story with the guard of war carcass just because it

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:48.800
spills over to mainstream media when you see stuff like that and it brings

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:53.600
attention to the gaming and world and not a good kind of attention yeah it's

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:57.120
definitely bad attention I have to agree with you there that's probably what I

01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:01.040
would pick to definitely would pick that one all right let's move on to June we

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:03.880
only take three shows in June I don't know what happened I guess we were we

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:07.040
fell asleep or maybe another Disneyland trip happened in there I'm not sure is

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:11.240
it was there all right well there were three shows taped in June episode 234

01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:14.760
that was the week I love this that was the week that Ubisoft apologized for

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:18.880
making crappy Wii games do you remember that one that they said you know what

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:24.480
maybe we shouldn't have done so many ports just just to have a game company

01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:28.560
even though I'm you know obviously this was an off comment that some executive

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:32.480
said they got turned into this whole you know Oh Ubisoft is apologizing for their

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:36.800
crappy games even the fact that they even remotely went there was definitely

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:40.560
newsworthy I gotta say because they did make a lot of crappy Wii games in the

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:46.840
beginning episode 235 that was the week that Sony finally after all that time

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:52.500
finally launched their semi-official blog three speak finally that was

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:56.720
launched in June of 2007 and obviously Sony had been kind of trying to catch up

01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:01.400
you might remember from the year before all I want for Xmas is a PSP calm and

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:06.880
remember that didn't go so well that time and so most people were saying you

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:11.120
know what Sony really needs like a major Nelson you know Nintendo has their

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:16.000
poster kids with Miyamoto and Reggie Fils-Aime you know Microsoft has you

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.020
know major Nelson and Trixie and people that are out there in the community

01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:26.440
Sony's got crazy crayon-eaten-ken if they hired me I bet you I could sell ps3

01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:31.240
how would you sell a PlayStation 3 first of all I'd restore it to its original

01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:35.960
format mm-hmm but I would have it with all of the goodie stuff and a 40 gig

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:39.800
hard drive mm-hmm it would not even have the option of having more yes but how

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:44.120
would you sell it what would that commercial look like boobs just just

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:50.560
women jumping on trampolines is that what it would be no you can have graphics

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:57.880
this realistic oh my god okay that is a brilliant idea for a commercial just all

01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:02.760
the commercial is is 30 seconds of boobs on trampolines and then in the very last

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:08.840
second it says generated by PlayStation 3 this is all real baby should be working

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:20.200
for Spike TV or or have like a shoe like barbecue because nothing will sell a

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:26.240
game like boobs and barbecue Mac man says in chat room Jamie would just tape a

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:30.640
ferret to every PlayStation 3 free ferret with every game and Dark Knight

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:35.120
wants to remember how did that crayon-eating bit even start Megsy that's

01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:38.640
right one of the OMR lesbians started the crayon-eating thing that's right

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:42.200
captain Crayola starts at Suya says all right well anyhow out of those three

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:45.920
stories or if you have one of your own Xenocore Ubisoft apologizes Sony

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:48.400
launches their own blood oh I'm sorry I didn't even read the third and third one

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:54.560
episode 236 was the week that manhunt 2 officially got the AO rating and of

01:24:54.560 --> 01:25:00.280
course this just began weeks upon weeks of oh my gosh when will this news end

01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:04.160
about manhunt 2 and of course you know it didn't happen the same week but you

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:09.760
know you subsequently was banned by the British board and so on and so on I mean

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:13.200
enough said manhunt 2 got the AO rating and had to go back for repairs and

01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:16.800
that's why the game got delayed to Halloween side of those three stories

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:20.680
Ubisoft apologizing Sony launching their official blog and manhunt 2 getting the

01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:23.600
ratings in a core what do you think biggest impact it's got it's got to be

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:27.560
the manhunt 2 story I mean that that went all across the globe on that one

01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:31.280
hands down absolutely everything else kind of pales in comparison that might

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:34.600
because that story just kind of like the lady who died from drinking the Wii and

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:37.320
the pita stuff and all the other stuff most people have named so far she drank

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:44.200
the Wii she drank all the water for the Wii drink we for a week now that's a

01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:51.680
contest I'd like to see who's willing to drink their we for a week it really is

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:58.240
although although although you can use P as a I don't I don't I always think I

01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:02.000
think back to when I watch survivor years ago and there was a guy there was

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.600
the guy going the the stingray just bit me I need someone to pee on it and so

01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:10.200
this lady goes over squats on him and pees on it and sure enough disinfects it

01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:15.360
but it's really better with your own pee because it breaks down the proteins in

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:18.920
the in the toxin it's just remember the guys there I need someone to pee on it

01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:24.600
I mean tenderizer works too sorry anyhow well seen a court let's not topic

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:29.400
talking about I'm such discussing potty humor and let's get to the good stuff

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:32.880
and that would be in your opinions in a car what was the worst freaking game of

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:41.720
2007 the worst game of 2007 mmm I mean it's too easy it's too easy of a target

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:44.920
I was trying to think of something else but it did nothing comes to mind yards

01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:48.280
needs to go whoever developed it needs to have their names published so they

01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:51.840
can't get another job in the aiming industry so simple as that three out of

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:57.440
three of named Yaris is I have a stick and it's not Yaris ah I can't think of

01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:01.600
another one out we gotta save everything I'm actually gonna tell you the last

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:06.960
issue of Xbox magazine was listing Yaris as a piece of crap into the official

01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:11.240
Xbox magazine even how sad how nice all right well let's get to the good stuff

01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:16.480
Xenocore in your opinion the best freaking game of 2007 okay I'll probably

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:20.440
get more hate mail for that but it gives me more to read on the show but uh yeah

01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:27.160
I got to say portals the best game of the year why I'm surprised that I I was

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:31.320
I was waiting to write persona 3 as an RPG player I would have thought that was

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:35.460
gonna be your pick but why portal because it's the most innovative title

01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:40.000
period everybody else is doing something that's really been done before I mean as

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.800
good as Super Mario Galaxy is ratcheting clank beat him to the market with it

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:47.720
rather or not they've developed it already Bioshock was a big

01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:50.960
disappointment for me it was good in the beginning but it sucked at the end and

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:54.960
in hindsight it's like what what's all this stuff you know so I threw Bioshock

01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:58.400
to the side and the others just didn't make a big of an impact this portal I

01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:02.160
can still go back and play portal now well point gets to win you never know

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:05.580
Xenocore we're gonna be recapping our picks later in the show and I'll bet you

01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:08.640
at least one of the three of us agrees with you that portal was the best game

01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:13.520
in 2007 but we'll find out for sure you never know surprises there are many

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:16.320
so we'll get to that a little later in the show but Xenocore thank you so much

01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:20.040
for joining us and we always have appreciated your calls throughout 2007

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:23.620
best of luck to you and the whole crew at the ultimate quest for 2008 all right

01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:28.280
yeah no problem thanks a lot guys all right take care buddy bye bye

01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:31.820
that was Xenocore ladies and gentlemen helping us recap May and June and so

01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:35.560
we're halfway through the year I think it's about time we take ourselves a

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:38.120
little bit of a break don't you guys think we have to take a break here

01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:42.720
pretty soon sure but there's one more thing we need to take care of before we

01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:45.640
go to break because we are getting to the end of part a and what happens at

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:53.560
the end of part a that's right it's time for Dark Sakura's classic game of the

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:58.280
week the chance for her to respect the elders actually I believe tonight is a

01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:02.800
very special edition because if I'm not mistaken tonight is the classic game of

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:08.960
the year I shot she's nodding yes it is the classic game of the year so you

01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:12.280
need to check this shit out because this is gonna be this is gonna be epic

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:15.480
whatever she picks tonight and let's hear it

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:21.000
Dark Sakura what is the classic game of the year the classic game of the year is

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:27.000
one of the best games ever in the universe it's Parodius Da Shinwakara

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Owariye which translates to my nose is all stuffed up it translates to Parodius

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:43.520
from Myth to Laughter and the version that I have for our music is the PC

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:50.080
engine release of it because honestly and I've played through the Super

01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:56.000
Famicom one it lags so badly it has bad liquor and slow down because it's a lot

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:02.520
of stuff to process via the the PC engine did it better but this is as you

01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:07.600
can probably tell from the name Parodius is a parody of Gradius it actually is

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:14.440
the second one in the series the first Parodius came out on the MSX system but

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:17.560
in this one you get to play you've actually got your different power-up

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:21.960
abilities based on what character you pick you can play the Vic Viper from

01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:27.120
Gradius you can play an octopus you can play a Twinbee this is the one where you

01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:31.760
fight the stripper you they're the Vegas showgirl whatever she is yeah oh my god I

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:37.520
remember this one by going in between her legs now why did Parodius never come

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:42.160
out in the u.s. it came out in Europe but why never here were we just not I

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:48.280
mean showgirl thing we just want to get too far up their ass so basically I mean

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:51.320
and for those of you that may be kind of looking at Jamie right now going what

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:54.440
the heck why are you picking this type thing you really do have to imagine this

01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:58.720
game is Gradius on crack yeah and what makes this game so freaking epic is just

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:04.120
the fact that that I think it was mostly ignored here in the u.s. Moai stage

01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:08.480
because you know kami games have to have the Moai head in there absolutely but

01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:13.120
the way that the the power-ups worked I thought it was cool the Vic Viper is the

01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:19.160
old-school Gradius config the octopus is the salamander configuration Twinbee is

01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:23.720
the Twinbee configuration even with the rocket with the the punching fists and

01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:29.960
pants Haro is Gradius three I always would play as a Twinbee because I love

01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:33.360
the rocket fist but it's also really cool and the one that we're watching is

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:36.080
actually the Vic Viper playing through because you get the option and double

01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:40.160
it's just like gradius to when you play it that way and the thing that my

01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:42.960
favorite weapon in the whole thing maybe this is a reason why I didn't come out

01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:46.480
because of the Eagle I noticed that the boss monster is being fought right now

01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:52.360
is an American Eagle wearing a Yankee hat and little bow tie it just exploded

01:31:52.360 --> 01:32:00.240
well um a little bit more is that you one of your power-ups in the game is a

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:05.000
bell and you keep shooting the bell and like if you shoot the if you get a blue

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.960
bell it'll make your character grow big and anything it touches will be

01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:13.400
destroyed if you get a green one it's a big flare and destroys everything on the

01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:19.680
screen including most bosses and that's actually how you beat the naked lady you

01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:23.640
one of the people that you fight is this woman wearing a sheet and when you shoot

01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:32.760
she goes angels at you bubbles in fact here's a here's a picture of her on the

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:38.920
wiki I'll link it in the chat room nice nice um but she's really freaking hard

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.320
to beat so you have to usually have to have the mega flare by there but they

01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:45.600
always give you a bell right before that stage my favorite of those is the gray

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:50.400
bell which shouts words like the whole phrase is like you know I think one of

01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:54.280
them is the equivalent of like eat at Joe's and another one is equals NC

01:32:54.280 --> 01:33:01.920
squared and now this is actually not my favorite in the parodius series my

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:07.520
favorite is a GQO Shabari Parodius which you can play on Saturn and that's the

01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:12.200
one that has and for anyone who wants to know that means chatting pretty aside

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:17.960
for anyone who wants to know it has the miracle OOP of it has the penguins

01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:22.160
Pantero and Hanako twin be and win be that your Viper and Lord British from

01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:28.200
Gradius not to be confused with Richard Garriott yeah right okay and it has

01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:36.320
some girls writing on a missile and now it has I assume quite soon which for

01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:40.880
anyone who ever played um Yu-Gi-Oh there's cards for them there are these

01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:46.720
little stickmen writing on paper airplanes but I just think that it's

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:52.040
pretty cool had so much stuff going on and the other one in the series was

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:59.240
there was sexy Parodius and Paro Wars and I also saw last night and I mean if

01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:04.080
you can hear on the thing a lot of the levels we mix Gradius music to start or

01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:13.760
salamander music and then play classical music like so um but uh last night I was

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:17.800
looking at YouTube trying to find you know because we obviously play the the

01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:26.140
sound off of YouTube that way but I found the Parodius pachinko machine

01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:33.000
videos nice and one of the there's even like this little model show with the the

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:39.000
bunny suit girls is girls in bunny outfits writing on missiles and then

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:45.520
you the the the showgirl was one of them stomping through the city and it's it was

01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:50.080
just really cool I was like so we at least still have the Parodius franchise

01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:54.680
still alive I would like to see a new Parodius really bad all right or some

01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:58.000
folks have chatter saying Parodius on virtual console especially with the fact

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.000
that we do happy we do know they will put Japanese games that were once

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.600
Japanese only they have been releasing over here like Mario Brothers 2 the

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:13.200
original I think everybody is you know smart enough to just get over it I know

01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:17.800
really it's not a big deal the reason why I like I'm very pretty is that one

01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:20.360
of the bad guys in it is actually supposed to be one of the girls from

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:26.120
Tokimeki Memorial the the long-term dating sim nice yeah well there it is

01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:31.520
folks your classic game of the year Parodius da in this case on the PC

01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:36.480
engine but you know it's it's out there for multiple systems so very good pick

01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:40.600
Jamie this game always cracks me up every time I watch it because Parodius

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:43.520
is an awesome game and where was this game in the Parodius collection that's

01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:47.360
what I would like to know I know right but I think there was like I think there

01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:50.280
was another I actually want to say that all of them have been released on

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:56.240
Saturn except for the MSX one well coming up in part B on tonight's program
