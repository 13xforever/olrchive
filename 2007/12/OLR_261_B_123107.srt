00:00:00,407 --> 00:00:01,488
[SPEAKER_03]: www.orangeloungeradio.com

2
00:00:15,436 --> 00:00:19,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

3
00:00:35,186 --> 00:00:36,167
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

4
00:01:00,373 --> 00:01:01,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to pick up a few.

5
00:01:01,614 --> 00:01:06,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and unfortunately, I mean, I think there was just so many emails these past two weeks that you're just not going to be able to read them all.

6
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:09,341
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Jamie's having to be choosy this week.

7
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:09,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, folks.

8
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:13,304
[SPEAKER_04]: So, let's open up the old mailbag.

9
00:01:13,344 --> 00:01:15,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLandsRadio.com, though, if you want to send it.

10
00:01:15,646 --> 00:01:18,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if we don't always respond to them on air, we read them all.

11
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:20,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I go in there and I read them all every day.

12
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,334
[SPEAKER_07]: There was one that had a lot of gratuitous uses of the word fuck, so I'm not reading it.

13
00:01:24,554 --> 00:01:24,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

14
00:01:25,775 --> 00:01:27,877
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm only reading a few of these, okay.

15
00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:29,183
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be Robb.

16
00:01:59,381 --> 00:02:02,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Adios Amigos, Dr. Noir Don't move that email out.

17
00:02:02,283 --> 00:02:04,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Save it in there and I'll reply with the address.

18
00:02:04,364 --> 00:02:06,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, there's a PS.

19
00:02:07,326 --> 00:02:07,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

20
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:11,069
[SPEAKER_07]: The plural form of Luchador is not Luchadors, but Luchadores.

21
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:15,592
[SPEAKER_07]: With the last syllable pronounced S as in Fez, the hat.

22
00:02:15,672 --> 00:02:16,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

23
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:24,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I did want to say, speaking of gifts sent to us, one of our listeners, our lover, Misty, sent a little care package.

24
00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:25,698
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see it up on the wall.

25
00:02:25,718 --> 00:02:26,959
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a Hello Kitty popsicle there.

26
00:02:27,352 --> 00:02:32,614
[SPEAKER_04]: This little penguin eye dog thing, which I thought was too cute, and lots of rice candy, which is my favorite.

27
00:02:33,114 --> 00:02:34,595
[SPEAKER_04]: And I ate it.

28
00:02:36,755 --> 00:02:38,436
[SPEAKER_07]: She sent us some candy, but you eat it.

29
00:02:38,496 --> 00:02:39,196
[SPEAKER_04]: But I eat it.

30
00:02:39,976 --> 00:02:42,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, speaking of Misty, I'll go ahead and read her.

31
00:02:42,317 --> 00:02:46,219
[SPEAKER_07]: She actually did ask about me talking about the Happy Suicide song.

32
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,181
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's Thanatos from End of Evangelion is the one I was referring to.

33
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:52,961
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

34
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:55,622
[SPEAKER_07]: The song that's just so freaking depressing.

35
00:02:56,562 --> 00:03:00,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I thought it was the whole end scene where they're dying.

36
00:03:00,823 --> 00:03:01,563
[SPEAKER_05]: It was hilarious.

37
00:03:02,564 --> 00:03:02,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

38
00:03:02,964 --> 00:03:03,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah.

39
00:03:04,904 --> 00:03:07,405
[SPEAKER_07]: But to read Misty's big email.

40
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:12,186
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was listening to my old OLR episodes and got stuck for some reason on episode 242.

41
00:03:12,846 --> 00:03:17,108
[SPEAKER_07]: And that umbrella song that I ended up ripping from 249, but let's not go there right now, LOL.

42
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:18,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me.

43
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:27,256
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess what inspired me to write in again, well this time anyway, was the short text message email that you read in this episode, plus I do have a question.

44
00:03:27,676 --> 00:03:33,120
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I shouldn't necessarily be thinking this far ahead, but face it, ASIN is my other addiction, aside from the station.

45
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I know enough not to ask if there'll be a panel, though that would be fucking rad.

46
00:03:37,523 --> 00:03:40,645
[SPEAKER_07]: So instead I'll ask this, currently does anyone's schedule work out for ASIN?

47
00:03:41,226 --> 00:03:47,511
[SPEAKER_07]: It's May 16th through 18th this year, but I am to head up to Rosemont on the 15th.

48
00:03:49,457 --> 00:03:51,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, should I expect to see Chris there?

49
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:53,220
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't catch her last year.

50
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Feel free to insert lame Pokemon jokes here.

51
00:03:56,022 --> 00:03:57,623
[SPEAKER_07]: But I really want to see her in Megzi.

52
00:03:58,703 --> 00:04:00,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I'll leave you alone for now.

53
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:05,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry if there's a typo I missed, but my typing on the LGNV still sucks a bit anyway.

54
00:04:05,968 --> 00:04:06,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Heart, Misty.

55
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,673
[SPEAKER_07]: I would think very much that Chris is going to be there, seeing as how she's relocating.

56
00:04:15,015 --> 00:04:17,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I get to go with her on the trip.

57
00:04:18,296 --> 00:04:26,740
[SPEAKER_07]: AceN probably is not in my future, although a little bit more of my time in that year has been freed up.

58
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,781
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know.

59
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:33,523
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to go, but... I'm not saying no yet.

60
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:40,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Not likely right now, just due to the fact that I'm not going to have a lot of free time off work available because I'm going to Mendocino in April.

61
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:50,421
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, never say never because I have found that flights from here to Chicago, or there's actually a lot of direct flights from SAC to Chicago, so, um, you never know.

62
00:04:50,461 --> 00:04:51,801
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where ASAN's at, Chicago, right?

63
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:52,481
[SPEAKER_06]: I do believe so.

64
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,342
[SPEAKER_04]: I do believe so as well.

65
00:04:53,722 --> 00:04:55,962
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, maybe.

66
00:04:57,062 --> 00:05:01,823
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's more favorable maybe than you might think because, you know, why not?

67
00:05:01,883 --> 00:05:02,343
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be fun.

68
00:05:02,664 --> 00:05:08,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially, I'll tell you what, that maybe is a hell of a lot more likely to become a yes if we can somehow get in on getting a panel there or something.

69
00:05:09,105 --> 00:05:09,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm

70
00:05:09,997 --> 00:05:13,138
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got other stuff planned in May and I have to double check my schedule.

71
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:16,880
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've wanted to go to ASUN now for a couple years.

72
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,801
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to cosplay.

73
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:21,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I need my costume.

74
00:05:22,802 --> 00:05:24,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably all three of us won't make it.

75
00:05:24,503 --> 00:05:26,964
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least maybe if one of the three of us can get out there.

76
00:05:26,984 --> 00:05:28,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, Loki, trip to Chicago in your future?

77
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:29,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

78
00:05:30,245 --> 00:05:31,526
[SPEAKER_04]: The wife won't let you go, will she?

79
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:33,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, I'm chained to the house.

80
00:05:33,447 --> 00:05:34,807
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like on house arrest.

81
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, while I'm still single, I should probably travel.

82
00:05:38,028 --> 00:05:39,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Because then

83
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:40,692
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

84
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:11,172
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't leave the room because I don't know why.

85
00:06:11,252 --> 00:06:15,053
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to petition PopCap to make a Bejeweled 3 fast to keep her busy.

86
00:06:15,613 --> 00:06:20,675
[SPEAKER_05]: That won't... That's only for like a matter of minutes and then she'll get bored of it.

87
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:22,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

88
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:25,016
[SPEAKER_07]: We never did realize just how prophetic that t-shirt would be.

89
00:06:27,356 --> 00:06:28,197
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true, huh?

90
00:06:28,297 --> 00:06:28,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Game over.

91
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:30,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get some more emails.

92
00:06:31,378 --> 00:06:31,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

93
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:32,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

94
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:37,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, OLR, I just wanted to get in my crappy story about the lack of Wiis in the world.

95
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:49,813
[SPEAKER_07]: I live in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, and at a specific department store whose name I will not mention, there was what you call a midnight madness sale where people will stay up to midnight trying to get the 15-minute only sales.

96
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:54,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, in this particular store, the big grand prize draw was a chance to buy a Wii.

97
00:06:55,057 --> 00:06:59,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that one gets free or 50% off, but just to have a chance to purchase one.

98
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,519
[SPEAKER_07]: I also heard about a guy in Australia purchasing one for $590.

99
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo, make more Wii's.

100
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:09,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep up the good work, LLR, PKJR92.

101
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:13,267
[SPEAKER_07]: The only way to make your PC go faster is to throw it out a window.

102
00:07:14,388 --> 00:07:24,135
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think what also probably unfortunately sucks for this person who is emailing us, thank you for the email by the way, is the fact that they do live in a pretty remote area of Canada.

103
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:42,772
[SPEAKER_04]: and A, you're in Canada, which is kind of, even though a very important, very large country, is still outside of that trinity of Japan, United States, and the big Europe regions like Germany, France, Britain, basically.

104
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:44,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically the big ones there in Spain.

105
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:49,115
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not trying to leave anybody out, but I'm saying the ones where gaming is more prevalent there in Europe.

106
00:07:49,774 --> 00:07:55,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada kind of comes after that sometimes with some things like Rock Band we've seen.

107
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,303
[SPEAKER_04]: So unfortunately sometimes they get the short end of the stick with the Wii shipments as well.

108
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:01,425
[SPEAKER_04]: And Nintendo can only make so many of those.

109
00:08:02,706 --> 00:08:07,930
[SPEAKER_04]: My advice would be though, I don't remember if he said he was trying to get one or whatever, but online.

110
00:08:08,431 --> 00:08:11,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you go to a place like Amazon, they're not going to care if you're in Canada or what have you.

111
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:13,355
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of that's the same for US and Canada.

112
00:08:14,116 --> 00:08:15,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless you're buying toys from Amazon UK.

113
00:08:17,102 --> 00:08:22,366
[SPEAKER_04]: But that is weird though about the whole raffle to get the opportunity to buy a Wii.

114
00:08:22,446 --> 00:08:23,067
[SPEAKER_04]: That is weird.

115
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:24,067
[SPEAKER_04]: That is kind of weird.

116
00:08:24,107 --> 00:08:27,650
[SPEAKER_07]: You know I have to order my UK toys from Amazon Canada.

117
00:08:28,711 --> 00:08:29,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

118
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:29,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

119
00:08:30,492 --> 00:08:31,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Just thought I'd share that with you.

120
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:43,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft wanted to respond to something he heard in Dr. Noir's email and that is that there are a lot of Wiis unsold in Mexico but that's because it costs almost double than it costs in the US because of import fees.

121
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:44,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone import them from Mexico.

122
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:46,889
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from Mark F. I stand corrected, thank you.

123
00:09:07,671 --> 00:09:10,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Sky talked about simple baseball games just to chime in.

124
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:12,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Bases Loaded was way better than Baseball Stars.

125
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:17,098
[SPEAKER_07]: And the best slash easiest baseball game was simply Baseball for the NES.

126
00:09:17,418 --> 00:09:17,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun times.

127
00:09:21,301 --> 00:09:24,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving forward for Robert M. People with your initial names.

128
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:27,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello and hope you had a nice break.

129
00:09:28,906 --> 00:09:31,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully you've ironed out most of the bugs in your new studio.

130
00:09:31,648 --> 00:09:34,510
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep getting the podcast feed about a day late.

131
00:09:35,237 --> 00:09:37,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Really like the weird owl for the stupid awards.

132
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,360
[SPEAKER_07]: And just a quick thought on the last show.

133
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,022
[SPEAKER_07]: You mentioned Facebook as a verb instead of using it in the sense of friending.

134
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:49,765
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend went more the head desk direction.

135
00:09:50,105 --> 00:09:51,306
[SPEAKER_07]: That is Facebooking.

136
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:54,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone would literally entail hitting them in the face with a book.

137
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:59,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Refreshing and witty comment relating online community sites and physical pain goes here.

138
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:04,493
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean like every time I go to MySpace, I feel like I'm going to have an aneurysm.

139
00:10:12,356 --> 00:10:23,178
[SPEAKER_07]: I was wondering what your opinion would be on the massively multiplayer online sports games, such as an NFL game where all 22 players could be controlled by online gamers.

140
00:10:23,258 --> 00:10:24,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Hard to coordinate, probably.

141
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:26,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to see how something like that would work.

142
00:10:30,185 --> 00:10:31,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Brilliant idea, honestly.

143
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,286
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why it's not out there.

144
00:10:34,326 --> 00:10:35,286
[SPEAKER_07]: People don't know how to work together.

145
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:45,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, yeah, it's partially that and partially probably that, you know, some people, you know, in a football team, you have your standout stars and then you have the other guys.

146
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:47,870
[SPEAKER_04]: And who wants to be the other guys?

147
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,371
[SPEAKER_04]: When you play a video game, you're trying to be something you're not.

148
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:51,511
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been on the bench.

149
00:10:52,371 --> 00:10:58,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's why it would be like, what was that game that my husband was playing, NFL Pro or something, where...

150
00:10:59,477 --> 00:11:02,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Your team is all fantasy.

151
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:06,760
[SPEAKER_07]: It's some of the greatest players that you've had in sports history.

152
00:11:07,581 --> 00:11:13,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe just that you pick from a pool of players.

153
00:11:13,564 --> 00:11:18,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Your team is actually a really big team that you form with friends, and then so many of you play in matches.

154
00:11:18,606 --> 00:11:18,866
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

155
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,067
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be really hard to coordinate, though.

156
00:11:20,827 --> 00:11:21,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the idea.

157
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:22,888
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the concept.

158
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:26,370
[SPEAKER_04]: The execution would be a little tricky, but I like your concept.

159
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,951
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it can work with a party of more than seven people.

160
00:11:29,246 --> 00:11:30,947
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura is having a sneeze fit.

161
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:35,610
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will praise Blades of Steel a little more in the great, great hockey game it was on the NES.

162
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:35,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

163
00:11:59,137 --> 00:12:01,118
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I used the Wii gifting feature this week.

164
00:12:02,018 --> 00:12:02,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I did?

165
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I used the Wii gifting feature to send my friend in New York a copy of Kid Icarus.

166
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,001
[SPEAKER_04]: And I tried to send her Mario 3, but the Wii rejected it.

167
00:12:09,321 --> 00:12:13,343
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Wii is smart enough to not let you send games your friends already have.

168
00:12:13,563 --> 00:12:20,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see, and I forgot to mention this on our show roll, that Microsoft did the gifting feature now in the U.S.

169
00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:20,886
[SPEAKER_05]: with points.

170
00:12:21,306 --> 00:12:23,667
[SPEAKER_05]: You can give other accounts points now.

171
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:24,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did they do that?

172
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but I read it somewhere.

173
00:12:27,082 --> 00:12:31,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I read it on one of the, like, Joystick or Kotaku.

174
00:12:31,565 --> 00:12:33,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that why Xbox has been broken the past few days?

175
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:34,787
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

176
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:46,976
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's great for me because, you know, having multiple consoles and, say, if I want to, you know, install, like, a map or something and buy it for each one, I don't have to buy point cards for every single console.

177
00:12:46,996 --> 00:12:48,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

178
00:12:48,237 --> 00:12:48,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

179
00:12:49,738 --> 00:12:54,079
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, our entire chat room could hear your power sneezes and say, bless you.

180
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what?

181
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:58,680
[SPEAKER_07]: My nose feels like a nightmare of pain and suffering.

182
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to hear it.

183
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,660
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you, chat room.

184
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,481
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad you heard me blow my nose, too.

185
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:03,581
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, any more emails?

186
00:13:03,601 --> 00:13:04,981
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear you sound like a foghorn.

187
00:13:06,181 --> 00:13:07,482
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there are emails.

188
00:13:11,283 --> 00:13:16,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, OLR crew, I found myself unable to sleep one night at three in the morning and popped on your radio feed on iTunes.

189
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:18,444
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was able to fall asleep.

190
00:13:20,302 --> 00:13:36,817
[SPEAKER_07]: and I noticed it was playing much more mellow music than normal is the rotation geared more towards slow calming songs at night or did I just happen upon a random anomaly either way it helps me get to sleep so thank you guys keep up the awesome show AZHP you're welcome and you can thank the total randomness because our playlist is the same

191
00:13:37,358 --> 00:14:05,475
[SPEAKER_04]: All day long, we don't do anything special at night Although, maybe we should I am going to be changing the playlist up Because I have a break from work here for another week So I'm going to be working on a lot of OLR stuff And one thing I'm going to be doing is cleaning out the 24-7 show And putting in some more classic game tunes And, yeah, just cycling some stuff in and out So, check it out Alright, two emails left, thank god Alright Because we got a bunch, this is a sample

192
00:14:06,607 --> 00:14:10,851
[SPEAKER_07]: So I updated my PSP the other day and was very pleased with the internet radio edition.

193
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:16,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Given the fact that I listened to your show on my PSP, it would be even better if I could listen to it live on there as well.

194
00:14:16,976 --> 00:14:18,878
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be a nice Christmas present, please.

195
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,442
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know how to make that happen just yet, but we have to get on that.

196
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:25,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you gotta figure that out.

197
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:26,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't look at me, I don't know how to do it.

198
00:14:28,085 --> 00:14:32,229
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to basically run a relay through Shoutcast.

199
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:33,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it has to be Shoutcast time.

200
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:35,605
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

201
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:42,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say somebody sent me an email about some Shoutcast stuff, so I will look into that as the week goes on.

202
00:14:43,348 --> 00:14:50,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I would assume, well, maybe you could probably broadcast on Shoutcast and Live365 at the same time.

203
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Or we could just leave Live365 and do Shoutcast with as many people as we want on the feed, but we'll see.

204
00:14:56,553 --> 00:14:56,873
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

205
00:14:58,694 --> 00:14:59,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything is a possibility.

206
00:14:59,714 --> 00:15:03,036
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can say, I do know you can listen to all games on your PSP.

207
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:04,676
[SPEAKER_04]: They did figure out how to set it up.

208
00:15:04,996 --> 00:15:10,078
[SPEAKER_04]: So if nothing else, you can always listen to our syndicated runs that air on allgames.com on Monday nights and Tuesday mornings.

209
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:11,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's more to that email.

210
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:13,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

211
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I'd like to note that when I listen to you guys, you always find a way to make me laugh, no matter what kind of mood I'm in.

212
00:15:18,622 --> 00:15:22,423
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you, and I wish you all a very Merry Christmas and many more Happy New Years to come.

213
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy Holidays.

214
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Mouthpiece, Osfer.

215
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:25,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

216
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:30,029
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to say, TigerClaw says, I can listen to OLR on my PSP using PSP radio.

217
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:31,710
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess it is possible.

218
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:32,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Last email.

219
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:33,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Ow.

220
00:15:34,531 --> 00:15:36,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe share that with everybody.

221
00:15:36,473 --> 00:15:37,253
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw, send Loki an email.

222
00:15:37,273 --> 00:15:38,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to share with the rest of the class?

223
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:39,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Send Loki an email.

224
00:15:39,694 --> 00:15:40,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't send me an email.

225
00:15:40,555 --> 00:15:41,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Just post it in the chat.

226
00:15:41,355 --> 00:15:42,476
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to get into it right now.

227
00:15:42,516 --> 00:15:43,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine, then post it in the chat, but I'm not reading it.

228
00:15:43,957 --> 00:15:45,078
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, email.

229
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Sky, Loki, and DarkSakura.

230
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

231
00:15:50,987 --> 00:15:53,008
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to start this out with a true fact.

232
00:15:53,128 --> 00:15:57,351
[SPEAKER_07]: OLR is the best, funniest, and most informative and engaging show in the world.

233
00:15:58,331 --> 00:16:01,793
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, and girl, have done a great job, and for that you should be commended.

234
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:03,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, somebody commend us, please.

235
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:07,096
[SPEAKER_07]: One question, though.

236
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:11,898
[SPEAKER_07]: I just got a PlayStation 3 for Christmas, and the only game I have for it right now is Motorstorm.

237
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:14,460
[SPEAKER_07]: What would be the top three games you would recommend for me to get?

238
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Marvel Ultimate Alliance,

239
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:19,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Sell your PS3.

240
00:16:19,873 --> 00:16:20,313
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

241
00:16:21,455 --> 00:16:22,235
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a gift.

242
00:16:22,896 --> 00:16:23,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

243
00:16:24,658 --> 00:16:27,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Resistance, Fall of Man.

244
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:28,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Oblivion.

245
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:29,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Oblivion.

246
00:16:29,303 --> 00:16:30,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely Oblivion.

247
00:16:30,804 --> 00:16:32,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are actually the three I named right there.

248
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:37,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Oblivion, Resistance,

249
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Marvel, if you're into that.

250
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously, Jamie's into that.

251
00:16:44,141 --> 00:16:44,821
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fun game.

252
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:49,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to think if there's something else that maybe was something... It has a lot of awesome... Heavenly Sword.

253
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:50,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

254
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:51,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Is probably fun.

255
00:16:52,082 --> 00:16:53,143
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have two hours.

256
00:16:54,423 --> 00:16:55,963
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100 Matt's recommending Warhawk.

257
00:16:57,304 --> 00:16:57,664
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

258
00:16:59,404 --> 00:17:03,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Resistance, I would say probably Uncharted, Drake's Fortune.

259
00:17:04,745 --> 00:17:07,206
[SPEAKER_05]: And depending on how you feel about...

260
00:17:08,123 --> 00:17:09,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Ratchet and Clank, Ratchet and Clank.

261
00:17:10,225 --> 00:17:13,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, I don't know.

262
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:14,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Motorstorm's pretty good.

263
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,870
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you bought your PS3, you probably already have Motorstorm.

264
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:18,531
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what he said.

265
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:19,612
[SPEAKER_07]: All he has now is Motorstorm.

266
00:17:19,992 --> 00:17:21,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then... Oblivion.

267
00:17:23,315 --> 00:17:25,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Nah, I wouldn't do Oblivion.

268
00:17:25,576 --> 00:17:25,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

269
00:17:26,297 --> 00:17:26,877
[SPEAKER_05]: It's old.

270
00:17:26,937 --> 00:17:29,780
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they're going to come out with something new year and buy it, and then all of a sudden, oh, crap.

271
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, I guess it is cheap.

272
00:17:31,361 --> 00:17:33,362
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't buy the expansion, it's like a $30 game, so...

273
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,489
[SPEAKER_07]: and a bunch of Blu-ray movies.

274
00:17:37,989 --> 00:17:41,470
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the PS3 games are really cheap now and you'll find a lot of them used.

275
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Seth is saying Unreal Tournament in our chatroom.

276
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,451
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably not a bad pick.

277
00:17:45,551 --> 00:17:49,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Unreal Tournament and Warhawk, depending on how you feel about online-only multiplayer games.

278
00:17:51,312 --> 00:17:58,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Unreal Tournament 3, if you don't like Unreal really, really fast trigger-happy games, then you might not like that.

279
00:18:00,094 --> 00:18:00,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

280
00:18:02,075 --> 00:18:02,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it for emails?

281
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,252
[SPEAKER_07]: No, there was more to that one, because people keep interrupting me.

282
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:07,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry.

283
00:18:08,493 --> 00:18:08,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Sir.

284
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:21,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I think Loki shouldn't get the bad rap he does from blasting Sony, because Sony really does leave us gamers out to dry in terms of innovation, besides the PS3, and new hardware such as new peripherals for the PSP.

285
00:18:22,242 --> 00:18:24,063
[SPEAKER_07]: So until they get wise, keep going strong.

286
00:18:24,243 --> 00:18:25,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Canada salutes you.

287
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:29,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Sincerely, Josh G. Well, thank you, Canada.

288
00:18:30,547 --> 00:18:31,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I salute Canada.

289
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:31,908
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Canada.

290
00:18:32,655 --> 00:18:35,756
[SPEAKER_07]: And I like this, what's the difference between Windows 95 and Windows 98?

291
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:36,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Answer, three years.

292
00:18:37,997 --> 00:18:39,157
[SPEAKER_04]: That joke is like ten years old.

293
00:18:39,337 --> 00:18:41,277
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, but I think it's great that somebody put that in their email.

294
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, now we're done with emails, yes?

295
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:49,300
[SPEAKER_07]: We are done, and I'm saving, I'm leaving out that one for you.

296
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, thank you very much.

297
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get back into some news, and then we're going to get back into the Skype line and go over July and the rest of the year.

298
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Release dates, or lack thereof.

299
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I would at least open it up if anybody has any release dates.

300
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:03,813
[SPEAKER_04]: How about the US, Loki?

301
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:09,258
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not much, and from what I gather, these four games are apparently a GameStop exclusive.

302
00:19:09,678 --> 00:19:21,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Good for them, I guess, scoring these awesome games, all of which are from a wonderful company named Conspiracy Entertainment, who is known for their extremely high-quality games.

303
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:26,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, no, not really, but you can get four racing games this week.

304
00:19:26,757 --> 00:19:29,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Rig Racer 2, which has you racing big rigs.

305
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:41,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Kawasaki Quad Bikes, Monster Trucks Off-Road, and then Classic British Motor Racing.

306
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just save you time.

307
00:19:44,691 --> 00:19:46,792
[SPEAKER_04]: What exactly is Classic British Motor Racing?

308
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:47,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Like an Aston Martin?

309
00:19:48,073 --> 00:19:49,334
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's like racing minis.

310
00:19:50,115 --> 00:19:50,255
[SPEAKER_05]: It's

311
00:19:51,534 --> 00:19:52,735
[SPEAKER_05]: None of these games are that great.

312
00:19:53,036 --> 00:20:00,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, they do have a game coming out, though, that's going to be a jet ski racing game, and it looks just like Wave Race 64.

313
00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:06,849
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that has potential, but I would, if you can rent these, go for it.

314
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:08,470
[SPEAKER_05]: They're cheap.

315
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're like $19.99, so if you have money that you want to throw away, I can tell you one thing, don't

316
00:20:14,367 --> 00:20:41,359
[SPEAKER_05]: buy monster trucks off-road because monster trucks they had off-road arena or something like that that really sucked and then there is off-road extreme special edition which got like a one on IGN it's like a piece of shit most of these are crap but just kind of know it going into it so that's all you can find this week next week I promise you better games how about the UK Jamie?

317
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,520
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give some highlights for what's coming out next week

318
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:49,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Dancing Stage Universe, Myst on DS, SingStar on PS3, Sonic Rivals 2, and another Yu-Gi-Oh game.

319
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:55,377
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'll go over the big massive list later.

320
00:21:14,329 --> 00:21:15,169
[SPEAKER_04]: How about the Virtual Console?

321
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,531
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did get Blaze of Steel here last week.

322
00:21:43,571 --> 00:21:45,712
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so weird the way they've been releasing those games.

323
00:21:45,752 --> 00:21:49,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you would think there'd be some pattern to it, but it really just seems like it's just kind of a crapshoot.

324
00:21:52,134 --> 00:21:55,595
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the part where I would go over Japanese releases, but there is nothing.

325
00:21:55,775 --> 00:21:57,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a damn thing I feel like mentioning.

326
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:58,576
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's it.

327
00:21:58,676 --> 00:21:59,496
[SPEAKER_04]: No Japanese releases.

328
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:03,225
[SPEAKER_04]: So that being said, we are going to open up the Skype line.

329
00:22:03,245 --> 00:22:04,845
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

330
00:22:04,985 --> 00:22:06,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

331
00:22:07,185 --> 00:22:10,586
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to go over with you guys, our listeners, the last few months of the year.

332
00:22:10,606 --> 00:22:17,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also want to get your picks for the best game of 2007 and the worst game of 2007.

333
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:19,348
[SPEAKER_04]: So go ahead and give us a call.

334
00:22:19,368 --> 00:22:27,109
[SPEAKER_04]: And remember, if you've never used Skype before, you might want to give Echo123 a call to make sure you sound okay.

335
00:22:28,206 --> 00:22:30,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're calling over the phone, then there's really nothing you can do to test.

336
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:40,215
[SPEAKER_04]: So, since there is a little bit of a delay between the live and when the people hear it, they probably don't know it's open yet, so we're just trying to fill in a little bit of time here.

337
00:22:41,536 --> 00:22:47,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Later on in the program, we're going to be going over our top five lists of the five most fun games we played this year.

338
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:51,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we'll tally it up, what overall was the best and the worst game of 2007.

339
00:22:52,264 --> 00:22:54,425
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll give some predictions for 2008.

340
00:22:54,846 --> 00:22:58,088
[SPEAKER_04]: And we haven't forgotten the FUs either.

341
00:23:00,994 --> 00:23:05,655
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, a lot of our regular callers are gone this week on vacation.

342
00:23:06,855 --> 00:23:07,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Away for the holidays.

343
00:23:08,316 --> 00:23:11,697
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's where, if you're wondering, why isn't our phone ringing off the hook?

344
00:23:11,717 --> 00:23:12,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Who leaves for New Year's?

345
00:23:12,797 --> 00:23:14,498
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand Christmas, but I don't know.

346
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,958
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people are still gone from Christmas is what happens.

347
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:21,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well.

348
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,601
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's going to happen if nobody calls?

349
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:28,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do July.

350
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone call us!

351
00:23:29,861 --> 00:23:31,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Or we can do it, we can always play with the chat room.

352
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:32,543
[SPEAKER_04]: People are just being shy.

353
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:33,804
[SPEAKER_04]: We have plenty of people in chat.

354
00:23:33,824 --> 00:23:36,286
[SPEAKER_04]: There's over, almost 50 people in chat.

355
00:23:36,466 --> 00:23:38,107
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know what the heck's going on there.

356
00:23:38,447 --> 00:23:39,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Pick up your damn phone.

357
00:23:39,808 --> 00:23:41,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you people have phones?

358
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,050
[SPEAKER_07]: And call us.

359
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Some folks are waiting for certain months.

360
00:23:44,892 --> 00:23:46,433
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you don't wait.

361
00:23:46,994 --> 00:23:48,435
[SPEAKER_07]: You do this on our terms.

362
00:23:49,856 --> 00:23:51,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Pick up the goddamn phone.

363
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:52,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, we're getting a call.

364
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Your goddamn phone call.

365
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:54,079
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting a call.

366
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:55,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, here on Orange Lodge Radio.

367
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

368
00:23:56,481 --> 00:23:56,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange.

369
00:23:58,574 --> 00:24:01,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is the Escapist.

370
00:24:01,196 --> 00:24:01,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Escapist is here.

371
00:24:02,176 --> 00:24:02,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, who's this?

372
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:05,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Escapist.

373
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Escapist, how are you, sir?

374
00:24:07,441 --> 00:24:08,001
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing?

375
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing wonderful, yourself?

376
00:24:11,804 --> 00:24:12,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

377
00:24:12,364 --> 00:24:16,968
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little bit of a delay, but I notice you're calling us from Canada, so that's probably why there's a bit of a delay.

378
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

379
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:19,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

380
00:24:20,034 --> 00:24:25,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so I'm going to go through this rather quickly here, and we want to hear your thoughts on some of the highlights of 2007.

381
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,642
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's talk first a little bit about July.

382
00:24:29,903 --> 00:24:38,071
[SPEAKER_04]: July, episode 237, was when a brain game in the UK was pulled over the use of the word spastic.

383
00:24:38,111 --> 00:24:44,977
[SPEAKER_04]: And I apologize if I offended anyone by saying that word just then, but we kind of hear in the US go, well, that's not a big deal, but in the UK...

384
00:24:45,823 --> 00:24:46,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

385
00:25:05,777 --> 00:25:09,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode 239 was the week that Mini E3 happened.

386
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:17,488
[SPEAKER_04]: That was when Mario Kart Wii was announced for the Wii and Cena was announced for the 360 and the PSP was announced that had a redesign.

387
00:25:18,148 --> 00:25:21,051
[SPEAKER_04]: And just in general, kind of the changed E3.

388
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:26,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, do you think, Loki, the E3 is going to be very similar to how it was this year, next year?

389
00:25:26,876 --> 00:25:28,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you think they're going to get kind of

390
00:25:29,341 --> 00:25:33,865
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, especially since they're moving back to the LA Convention Center, do you think they're going to get a little bit of maybe what they missed?

391
00:25:34,605 --> 00:25:36,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think it's going to be about the same.

392
00:25:36,627 --> 00:25:47,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of which, you need to talk to whoever was supposed to invite us last year and get them to invite, or this year I should say, and be ready for this next year because I want to go.

393
00:25:47,955 --> 00:25:48,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I do too, we'll see.

394
00:25:49,196 --> 00:25:56,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, anyways, uh, yeah, all I remember from Mini 3 is how disappointed I was with the Mario Kart and, um,

395
00:25:57,054 --> 00:25:58,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Zapper announcements.

396
00:25:58,435 --> 00:26:07,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Not necessarily Mario Kart, because Mario Kart's really fucking awesome, but the fact that it comes with a plastic steering wheel, all these peripherals, they were like, God, this is a stupid idea.

397
00:26:07,938 --> 00:26:09,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Who keeps releasing this crap?

398
00:26:09,218 --> 00:26:10,819
[SPEAKER_05]: And Nintendo's like, Hey!

399
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:12,460
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna do it too!

400
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,180
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes it a good idea, right?

401
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,442
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the Zapper, you know, what we saw was like a pretty cool attachment, you know, kind of like the Nunchuck.

402
00:26:20,262 --> 00:26:23,123
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all of a sudden, now it's this piece of plastic crap.

403
00:26:24,224 --> 00:26:24,564
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know...

404
00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:26,733
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't all that exciting.

405
00:26:27,073 --> 00:26:29,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Escapist, did you follow him in E3 news?

406
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:32,158
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you think of this year's E3, new and improved?

407
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of really ignored it this year.

408
00:26:37,242 --> 00:26:39,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I've never been a big fan of E3 to begin with.

409
00:26:40,004 --> 00:26:43,707
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a whole bunch of excitement for a couple months and whatever.

410
00:26:44,168 --> 00:26:45,349
[SPEAKER_04]: What makes you not a fan of E3?

411
00:26:50,213 --> 00:26:51,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Just too much information at one time.

412
00:26:51,634 --> 00:26:53,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I get kind of overloaded and overexcited a bit.

413
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,060
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

414
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:19,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Which kind of made a lot of us go, wow.

415
00:27:20,101 --> 00:27:20,762
[SPEAKER_04]: And it did win.

416
00:27:20,942 --> 00:27:22,722
[SPEAKER_04]: And it did end up winning the Emmy, actually.

417
00:27:22,782 --> 00:27:29,383
[SPEAKER_04]: But, of course, the South Park Wow episode integrated the World of Warcraft very well with the South Park kids.

418
00:27:29,703 --> 00:27:32,764
[SPEAKER_04]: But, of course, the one thing I remember was, ma'am, bathroom.

419
00:27:33,924 --> 00:27:34,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Bathroom.

420
00:27:35,664 --> 00:27:35,924
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

421
00:27:36,304 --> 00:27:44,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Escapist, out of those stories, the brain game, the price cut, Mini 3, and South Park World of Warcraft, what do you think had the biggest impact for 2007's gaming?

422
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:56,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, even though I just undermined it earlier, I'd definitely say the E3 there, just because, you know, it was a whole new year for E3, a new direction they wanted to go.

423
00:27:57,116 --> 00:28:01,540
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still the same kind of information that got released from what I saw, but just a lot less people going to it.

424
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're right.

425
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:07,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I think even though it is different, I think it definitely was the highlight of the month and the year in some ways.

426
00:28:07,624 --> 00:28:15,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the way that they did E3, I mean, besides the multiple hotels and it being kind of difficult to travel from one place to another...

427
00:28:16,224 --> 00:28:17,566
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

428
00:28:38,832 --> 00:28:43,154
[SPEAKER_05]: I think works a lot better for me than having to just navigate all around because I end up missing stuff.

429
00:28:43,814 --> 00:28:44,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

430
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:47,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I said this before on the show.

431
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:58,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Two years ago, the last big E3, I knew something was wrong when Paris Hilton was there and drawing these big crowds because she had some fucking crappy cell phone game coming out, right?

432
00:28:58,721 --> 00:28:59,682
[SPEAKER_07]: She got the name wrong on.

433
00:28:59,962 --> 00:29:02,923
[SPEAKER_04]: You knew that something was broken with E3 at that point.

434
00:29:03,303 --> 00:29:03,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

435
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,524
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

436
00:29:05,464 --> 00:29:05,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

437
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:08,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well let's move on to August, Escapist.

438
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:12,488
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go over the four stories and tell us which one you think had the most impact.

439
00:29:12,908 --> 00:29:20,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode 241 kicked off August and it was another WoW story because that was the week that BlizzCon happened and Wrath of the Lich King was announced.

440
00:29:20,412 --> 00:29:28,336
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, obviously, we even had some folks, I remember Extifer, one of our regular guests, actually went to BlizzCon and came back with a full report.

441
00:29:28,676 --> 00:29:32,658
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, a lot of WoW players are very excited about the Wrath of the Lich King expansion.

442
00:29:33,537 --> 00:29:41,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode 242 was the week that the news was breaking that the Xbox 360 Core system was being phased out of stores.

443
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:41,922
[SPEAKER_05]: The price dropped, too.

444
00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:52,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, when Best Buy started to phase them out of their computers and Target was phasing them out of their computers, the systems were slowly disappearing, which kind of made people go, hmm, what's going on there?

445
00:29:52,628 --> 00:29:58,011
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, subsequently we learned about the Elite and all that stuff.

446
00:29:58,452 --> 00:29:59,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the Elite had already been out.

447
00:29:59,332 --> 00:30:02,494
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm sorry, the Elite had been out, the Arcade and the other stuff.

448
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:31,911
[SPEAKER_04]: episode 243 Toys R Us breaks the Bioshock street date Bioshock came out towards the end of August and Toys R Us broke the street date and people were taking pictures of receipts and that stuff was all over the internet and then episode 244 in August was the week we talked about a brand new game Konami was putting out called New International Track in a Field and what made this story stand out the fact that there was going to be a cartoon version of Serial Killer Pyramid Head in the game a little chibi pyramid head game

449
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:46,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the game is not out yet, but we were just talking about the announcement, although I should say that if you saw the Christmas cards that some of the big game companies put out, Konami actually had a little picture of Chibi Pyramid Head in there, and he was opening up a box with new gloves in it.

450
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:47,530
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so cute.

451
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,791
[SPEAKER_07]: He just reminded me of something.

452
00:30:48,831 --> 00:30:49,151
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

453
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:53,372
[SPEAKER_07]: My husband's boss gave him one of the Portal Christmas cards.

454
00:30:53,912 --> 00:30:54,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

455
00:30:56,033 --> 00:30:56,833
[SPEAKER_04]: From Aperture Science?

456
00:30:56,973 --> 00:30:57,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I stole it.

457
00:30:57,873 --> 00:30:58,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

458
00:30:59,254 --> 00:31:00,574
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a card, but I stole it.

459
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:12,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, escapists, out of those stories, BlizzCon, Xbox 360 Core phased out, Toys R Us breaking a street date, a new international track and field, or anything you can think of, what do you think had the most impact?

460
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:16,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that's a little bit of a tougher month, because it was after E3, but what do you think had the most impact?

461
00:31:19,695 --> 00:31:20,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, jeepers.

462
00:31:21,636 --> 00:31:25,497
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, I definitely have to say the Toys R Us thing was kind of a

463
00:31:26,294 --> 00:31:27,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Big deal there.

464
00:31:27,335 --> 00:31:31,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Another insight into the distribution chain there that people are really excited to get their games now.

465
00:31:31,538 --> 00:31:36,062
[SPEAKER_02]: And Toys R Us isn't really paying attention.

466
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:36,662
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

467
00:31:36,822 --> 00:31:38,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of a shot in the head.

468
00:31:38,544 --> 00:31:40,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited to be on air, that's all.

469
00:31:40,545 --> 00:31:41,306
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's all good.

470
00:31:41,346 --> 00:31:51,834
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's a very good point that you're saying there is that, you know, a big chain like Toys R Us you would think would know better, but sometimes down on the lower levels, you know, folks kind of make their mistakes and all that stuff, you know.

471
00:31:52,213 --> 00:31:53,414
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

472
00:32:17,452 --> 00:32:20,515
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people were actually playing Halo 3 before that came out?

473
00:32:35,123 --> 00:32:35,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.

474
00:32:36,344 --> 00:32:36,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent point.

475
00:32:36,844 --> 00:32:38,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd already beaten it before it came up.

476
00:32:38,344 --> 00:32:38,885
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

477
00:32:38,965 --> 00:32:40,485
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was another huge one, Halo 3.

478
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:41,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

479
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,547
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was in August as well, right?

480
00:32:43,687 --> 00:32:44,087
[SPEAKER_04]: October.

481
00:32:44,907 --> 00:32:45,387
[SPEAKER_04]: September.

482
00:32:45,527 --> 00:32:46,348
[SPEAKER_04]: September, almost.

483
00:32:46,428 --> 00:32:46,748
[SPEAKER_04]: End of September.

484
00:32:46,768 --> 00:32:47,648
[SPEAKER_04]: When we get into the next month.

485
00:32:48,168 --> 00:32:48,409
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

486
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:58,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Escapist, before we let you go, we have a few more things to ask you, and that would be, what, in your opinion, was the worst freaking game of 2007 that should be avoided at all costs?

487
00:33:01,943 --> 00:33:07,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, normally I would go with the obvious pick like the artist, except I actually didn't play it, so that would kind of be a cop-out on my part.

488
00:33:08,505 --> 00:33:09,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's fair enough.

489
00:33:09,546 --> 00:33:10,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we have to change it up.

490
00:33:10,626 --> 00:33:11,606
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think then?

491
00:33:14,587 --> 00:33:17,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to be annoying and say I didn't really like Call of Duty all that much.

492
00:33:17,869 --> 00:33:19,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Call of Duty 4 never really did anything for me.

493
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:22,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it might be I'm not a true shooter fan or whatnot.

494
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's because I had a horrible time online playing it, but...

495
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:26,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam Montana

496
00:33:48,863 --> 00:33:50,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Hannah Montana was the worst game?

497
00:33:50,184 --> 00:33:51,244
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was the best, I think.

498
00:33:51,264 --> 00:33:51,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Gears of War.

499
00:33:51,805 --> 00:33:52,365
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was different.

500
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:53,365
[SPEAKER_04]: No, yes, it was Gears of War.

501
00:33:53,385 --> 00:33:55,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I think somebody said Gears of War was the worst game that came out.

502
00:33:55,907 --> 00:33:58,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it was Michelle from Video Game Outsiders.

503
00:33:58,948 --> 00:33:59,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.

504
00:33:59,449 --> 00:33:59,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

505
00:33:59,849 --> 00:34:00,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd have to go back and listen.

506
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:01,110
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway.

507
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:01,890
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

508
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:02,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

509
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,191
[SPEAKER_04]: That was last year.

510
00:34:03,311 --> 00:34:04,491
[SPEAKER_04]: That was so 2006.

511
00:34:04,831 --> 00:34:05,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about 2007.

512
00:34:05,332 --> 00:34:09,414
[SPEAKER_04]: The best game of 2007, Escapist, in your opinion?

513
00:34:13,156 --> 00:34:13,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh...

514
00:34:14,116 --> 00:34:16,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Last time I tried to avoid the obvious pick, but I have to go the obvious with this one.

515
00:34:16,877 --> 00:34:17,857
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have to be the Orange Box.

516
00:34:17,877 --> 00:34:20,278
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably the best gaming value I've ever seen in my freaking life.

517
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:25,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Five classic games all crammed in one bundle, and ignore the Portal.

518
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,740
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't say I disagree with you, sir.

519
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:32,621
[SPEAKER_04]: The Orange Box is a great deal, and that right there makes it definitely a worthy candidate for Game of the Year.

520
00:34:32,741 --> 00:34:36,562
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have Portal in there as well, which of course is a brilliant game in itself.

521
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:39,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Escapists, thanks so much for being on the show tonight.

522
00:34:39,843 --> 00:34:41,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though we had a little bit of a delay with the cross...

523
00:34:43,154 --> 00:34:44,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much for having me.

524
00:34:44,795 --> 00:34:45,956
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you have a great 2008.

525
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:46,617
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, take care, buddy.

526
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:47,177
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, you too.

527
00:34:47,197 --> 00:34:47,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

528
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:49,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, because of the distance there, he was breaking up a little bit.

529
00:35:06,431 --> 00:35:06,691
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

530
00:35:07,652 --> 00:35:07,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

531
00:35:08,012 --> 00:35:11,113
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to move on to September.

532
00:35:11,673 --> 00:35:15,455
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get a call here and talk about September and October.

533
00:35:15,935 --> 00:35:18,897
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Skype line is open at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

534
00:35:19,457 --> 00:35:20,237
[SPEAKER_04]: September and October.

535
00:35:20,477 --> 00:35:23,719
[SPEAKER_04]: And remember, if you don't get through for this one, there is still November and December.

536
00:35:23,819 --> 00:35:24,839
[SPEAKER_04]: We still have that to go over.

537
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:26,320
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see who's on the line.

538
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.

539
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:27,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

540
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:29,101
[SPEAKER_09]: GS68.

541
00:35:29,721 --> 00:35:31,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you were the one that was waiting for September, weren't you?

542
00:35:32,503 --> 00:35:33,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

543
00:35:33,843 --> 00:35:34,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

544
00:35:34,163 --> 00:35:35,304
[SPEAKER_04]: You lucked out, didn't you?

545
00:35:36,252 --> 00:35:38,032
[SPEAKER_04]: because somebody else might have beat you to it.

546
00:35:38,072 --> 00:35:38,813
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, here it is.

547
00:35:39,173 --> 00:35:40,253
[SPEAKER_04]: We got September and October.

548
00:35:40,313 --> 00:35:41,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start with September.

549
00:35:41,393 --> 00:35:42,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, September was our biggest month.

550
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:47,274
[SPEAKER_04]: There were five Sundays in the month of September, so we did more shows in September than any other month.

551
00:35:48,015 --> 00:35:53,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting off with episode 245, Neo Geo titles were announced for the Nintendo Wii's virtual console.

552
00:35:53,476 --> 00:36:00,177
[SPEAKER_04]: So, of course, a lot of people were like, OMG, Magician's Lair and Magician Lord and OMG, Fatal Fury and all this stuff.

553
00:36:00,217 --> 00:36:02,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And what always surprised me about this was that

554
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:11,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Fatal Fury is like $9 on the Nintendo Wii, or you can get the souped-up version with the improved HD and online play for $5.

555
00:36:12,161 --> 00:36:15,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you can get the original card for like $100.

556
00:36:16,685 --> 00:36:19,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think that kind of goes out the window now with Virtual Console.

557
00:36:20,127 --> 00:36:23,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Jamie, you collect the old-school Neo Geo cartridges.

558
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:23,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some.

559
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:24,730
[SPEAKER_04]: You've paid hundreds of dollars.

560
00:36:25,431 --> 00:36:27,212
[SPEAKER_04]: But you do have some that you've paid hundreds of dollars for, right?

561
00:36:27,232 --> 00:36:30,194
[SPEAKER_07]: The only one that I paid, and I got it for $200 and something...

562
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:38,961
[SPEAKER_07]: was I got a chance to buy King of Fighters 2000 for relatively cheap.

563
00:36:39,881 --> 00:36:42,142
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's the one that we've paid the most for.

564
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:46,743
[SPEAKER_07]: But we've got like Samurai Shodown, Samurai Shodown 2, Baseball Stars.

565
00:36:47,603 --> 00:36:49,163
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think as a collector?

566
00:36:49,203 --> 00:36:51,824
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about all this stuff now coming out on Virtual Console for less than $10?

567
00:36:52,564 --> 00:36:52,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

568
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:56,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I don't have the money to spend on this crap.

569
00:36:57,505 --> 00:36:58,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I did want Samurai Shodown 5.

570
00:36:59,086 --> 00:37:01,066
[SPEAKER_07]: I would pay the money for that.

571
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:26,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, episode 246 was the episode where Sony was sending out to all the critics out there a review guide for Lair Well, IGN kind of like posted it, but they were sending it to several critics This whole little guide on Lair And they said, no, we're not trying to sway people's decisions But they just want to make sure everybody understood the game And the six axis control, right?

572
00:37:27,722 --> 00:37:29,382
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was a very nicely bound little book.

573
00:37:30,143 --> 00:37:33,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode number 247 was the episode where Project Hammer was cancelled.

574
00:37:33,683 --> 00:37:37,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if any of those review guides went on the, you know, old eBay.

575
00:37:38,104 --> 00:37:39,484
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we never looked.

576
00:37:39,544 --> 00:37:39,985
[SPEAKER_04]: We should have.

577
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:41,525
[SPEAKER_04]: We could have put one up here in the studio.

578
00:37:41,545 --> 00:37:43,205
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have been fun.

579
00:37:43,225 --> 00:37:45,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, 247 was when Project Hammer was cancelled.

580
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:51,547
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a game that looked to be a hell of a lot of fun when we saw it at E3, but apparently somebody at Nintendo decided it wasn't.

581
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:52,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Good enough.

582
00:37:52,745 --> 00:37:57,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Project Hammer reminds me too much of MC Hammer, and that's like so ten years ago.

583
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:57,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

584
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Project MC Hammer.

585
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Reverend Hammer.

586
00:38:04,273 --> 00:38:07,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode number 248 was the week that Smash Bros.

587
00:38:07,715 --> 00:38:10,097
[SPEAKER_04]: was announced that it was going to be going online.

588
00:38:10,537 --> 00:38:12,958
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, that caused a lot of people to go, Woo!

589
00:38:12,998 --> 00:38:15,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, later on it was announced that it still has friend codes.

590
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:18,222
[SPEAKER_09]: And the whole...

591
00:38:19,656 --> 00:38:26,498
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole like thing with people just getting in the computer, taking over and stuff Okay, you know what I heard?

592
00:38:26,518 --> 00:38:44,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, yeah, that's weird I'm trying to get off topic here a little bit Apparently, what was it, not Brothers in Arms Medal of Honor 2, or Heroes 2 Is online, 32 players, and if I remember correctly Does not have friends codes for the Wii Nice So why can't everybody do that?

593
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:47,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Your guess is as good as mine

594
00:38:49,889 --> 00:38:52,792
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was episode 248, and of course it was a five-week month.

595
00:38:53,332 --> 00:39:03,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode 249, that was the week that the Sex Pistols announced that they were getting back together to re-record the song Anarchy in the UK for Guitar Hero 3.

596
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:28,006
[SPEAKER_04]: and of course this is big news I think not so much like just the song itself or what have you but just the fact that you know video games and especially a series like Guitar Hero 3 has transcended the music game genre so much that bands that had been broken up were coming back together for the purposes of recording for the game I mean that in my mind is huge especially as an old school music gaming fan so

597
00:39:28,906 --> 00:39:30,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I have my own from episode 247, I think.

598
00:39:30,688 --> 00:39:30,908
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

599
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:34,111
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one about the New Jersey parents being upset about the Wii Zapper.

600
00:39:54,404 --> 00:39:57,165
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was looking at that one when I was going through the show rules today.

601
00:39:57,205 --> 00:39:59,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the New Jersey parents being upset about the Wii Zapper.

602
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:01,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you think that was the biggest impact?

603
00:40:02,508 --> 00:40:10,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, like, 20 years ago, the Wii Zapper, like, I mean, the NES Zapper, I mean, no one complained about that.

604
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:14,373
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Super Nintendo had a Super Skill.

605
00:40:14,473 --> 00:40:15,574
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think anyone complained.

606
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:17,835
[SPEAKER_09]: And a whole bunch of systems after that.

607
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:21,036
[SPEAKER_09]: But, like, a gun proof on the Wii?

608
00:40:21,556 --> 00:40:22,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh, you must ban this.

609
00:40:25,287 --> 00:40:27,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have a pick for the news story.

610
00:40:27,788 --> 00:40:28,648
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think, Loki?

611
00:40:28,748 --> 00:40:30,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Halo 3 is released!

612
00:40:30,189 --> 00:40:30,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on!

613
00:40:30,749 --> 00:40:31,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously!

614
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's like, oh my god, Halo 3!

615
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:36,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so, that's a big news story.

616
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:37,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I don't know.

617
00:40:37,273 --> 00:40:38,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, it was.

618
00:40:38,594 --> 00:40:42,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the reason why it was overlooked here is because, you know, it kind of... I know, we don't care about Halo 3.

619
00:40:43,016 --> 00:40:49,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, it's not that, because I do care about Halo 3, but just that most of the Halo 3 news was everything leading up to its release.

620
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:50,640
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

621
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I wonder.

622
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, how about this?

623
00:40:54,521 --> 00:40:56,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode 246 or whatever.

624
00:40:56,522 --> 00:40:58,744
[SPEAKER_04]: It is announced that you cannot put the helmets on your cat.

625
00:40:59,644 --> 00:41:00,465
[SPEAKER_04]: That is disappointing.

626
00:41:00,905 --> 00:41:02,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Biggest news of the month.

627
00:41:02,686 --> 00:41:04,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Biggest news of 2007, honestly.

628
00:41:06,129 --> 00:41:06,669
[SPEAKER_04]: You okay, Jamie?

629
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:08,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Blink, blink, blink.

630
00:41:10,452 --> 00:41:11,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you try to put the helmet on your cat?

631
00:41:12,073 --> 00:41:12,433
[SPEAKER_04]: On Shermie?

632
00:41:13,214 --> 00:41:14,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Shermie's too stupid.

633
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:14,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

634
00:41:15,175 --> 00:41:15,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, GS68.

635
00:41:15,716 --> 00:41:20,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, can we put it on the... Can we put a helmet on the ferrets?

636
00:41:21,323 --> 00:41:22,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we put the helmet on the ferret?

637
00:41:22,524 --> 00:41:23,124
[SPEAKER_07]: We probably could.

638
00:41:23,164 --> 00:41:24,665
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could find the ferret, we could.

639
00:41:24,685 --> 00:41:28,667
[SPEAKER_07]: The ferret ran hiding since Rob threatened to put him down the food trash compactor.

640
00:41:28,827 --> 00:41:29,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I did, I did.

641
00:41:29,567 --> 00:41:31,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Skirgo's the penguin.

642
00:41:32,668 --> 00:41:34,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly the new penguin from Argentina.

643
00:41:34,469 --> 00:41:35,790
[SPEAKER_07]: The penguin is frightening.

644
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:36,630
[SPEAKER_04]: He is pretty fierce.

645
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:37,811
[SPEAKER_04]: He's very punk rock.

646
00:41:38,251 --> 00:41:39,452
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's go on to October.

647
00:41:39,472 --> 00:41:40,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Our show's going to go on all night.

648
00:41:41,393 --> 00:41:42,373
[SPEAKER_04]: October, episode 250.

649
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:45,635
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a big week for us because it was our 250th episode.

650
00:41:46,035 --> 00:41:47,996
[SPEAKER_04]: That was also the week that Nintendo...

651
00:41:48,533 --> 00:41:48,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

652
00:42:03,786 --> 00:42:04,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Working episodes.

653
00:42:27,472 --> 00:42:28,333
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

654
00:42:48,749 --> 00:42:53,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so excited right now and it's going to be very disappointing when the game actually comes out.

655
00:42:53,573 --> 00:42:56,456
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wonder if he's going to kill Hitler at the end.

656
00:42:56,476 --> 00:42:56,736
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope so.

657
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:16,071
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be definitely the coup de grace.

658
00:43:16,691 --> 00:43:25,758
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the last show we taped in October, episode number 253, was the week that it was discovered that Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3 are not playing nice.

659
00:43:26,018 --> 00:43:28,580
[SPEAKER_04]: The controllers were not compatible with each other.

660
00:43:29,001 --> 00:43:31,783
[SPEAKER_04]: If you wanted to play both games, you had to use your Guitar Hero 2 controllers.

661
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,625
[SPEAKER_04]: But Guitar Hero 3 on at least PlayStation 3 was not compatible with each other.

662
00:43:36,026 --> 00:43:37,667
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been using our Xbox ones.

663
00:43:38,223 --> 00:43:40,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox, I think, works one way, but it doesn't work the other way.

664
00:43:40,844 --> 00:43:41,605
[SPEAKER_07]: It works with Rock Band.

665
00:43:41,765 --> 00:43:44,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it works with Rock Band, but the controller doesn't work with Guitar Hero 3.

666
00:43:44,846 --> 00:43:46,767
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be better if they made a controller that didn't break.

667
00:43:47,647 --> 00:43:52,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Or just that they just would let them both be, you know, a lot of people are like, this just sucks that they can't get along.

668
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,671
[SPEAKER_04]: And I agree, it sucks that they can't get along.

669
00:43:56,011 --> 00:43:59,353
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think GS68 was the biggest, or if you have one of your own, feel free to share.

670
00:43:59,673 --> 00:44:01,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo offering Wii condoms, Smash Bros.

671
00:44:01,974 --> 00:44:07,096
[SPEAKER_04]: delayed, Capcom announced the Street Fighter 4 and Bionic Commando, or Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3 just can't play nice.

672
00:44:08,693 --> 00:44:09,433
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not too sure.

673
00:44:09,493 --> 00:44:12,534
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not... I don't really remember October too well.

674
00:44:13,855 --> 00:44:21,917
[SPEAKER_09]: But... I would probably guess... I would probably guess 354, the Wiimote gloves, I guess.

675
00:44:22,497 --> 00:44:23,337
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wiimote gloves?

676
00:44:24,458 --> 00:44:25,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was pretty big.

677
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:25,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

678
00:44:25,898 --> 00:44:27,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Me, personally, I would say the Smash Bros.

679
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:27,939
[SPEAKER_04]: delay.

680
00:44:27,979 --> 00:44:31,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that seems weird, because then you kind of go, well, that's a 2008 story.

681
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:37,862
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was a game that people were so looking forward to, and especially on the Wii, that really needed some powerhouse games.

682
00:44:37,902 --> 00:44:38,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, I guess...

683
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:39,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it didn't.

684
00:44:39,878 --> 00:44:41,600
[SPEAKER_04]: It did pretty well this Christmas regardless.

685
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:44,282
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, so many people were looking forward to that game.

686
00:44:44,322 --> 00:44:46,424
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just a real disappointment when that game got delayed.

687
00:44:46,604 --> 00:44:49,227
[SPEAKER_09]: If most of it were to delay, I'd be playing it right now.

688
00:44:50,067 --> 00:44:50,628
[SPEAKER_04]: We all would.

689
00:44:51,168 --> 00:44:52,330
[SPEAKER_04]: We probably wouldn't be doing this show.

690
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:53,410
[SPEAKER_04]: We would be playing Smash Bros.

691
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:53,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Brawl right now.

692
00:44:54,912 --> 00:44:59,396
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, you know, again, all the more reason why that game's got to be twice as good.

693
00:45:00,077 --> 00:45:03,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, people are going to kind of go, oh, we waited all this time for this?

694
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:03,780
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

695
00:45:04,397 --> 00:45:08,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Given all these delays, I have a feeling people are going to start calling it Super Smash Bros.

696
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:08,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Forever.

697
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:11,079
[SPEAKER_04]: I think somebody did earlier in chat, actually.

698
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:11,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was me.

699
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:17,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, GS68, what in your opinion was the worst freaking game of 2007?

700
00:45:17,061 --> 00:45:29,306
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't played a lot of crappy games that were released in 2007, but I might have... I'd probably give it to Initial D4.

701
00:45:31,934 --> 00:45:33,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Initial D4.

702
00:45:33,715 --> 00:45:34,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Initial D4.

703
00:45:34,436 --> 00:45:35,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Why initial D4?

704
00:45:36,697 --> 00:45:58,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, mainly because it wasn't programmed so, like, apparently there's this whole speed limit system where if you go too fast on a certain corner, your wheel locks and your acceleration suffers and there's this penalty cancel glitch where you hit the brake to remove the acceleration problem and from what I've read, like,

705
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:08,195
[SPEAKER_09]: The recent official initial D tournament is the last one they're going to do because I've read that initial D4 is not doing very well in Japan.

706
00:46:08,335 --> 00:46:14,898
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, over in Hong Kong, for example, version 3 is doing better than initial D4.

707
00:46:15,158 --> 00:46:17,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that is something else.

708
00:46:18,019 --> 00:46:22,681
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a bummer that it really sucked it up on its fourth version.

709
00:46:23,042 --> 00:46:25,042
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't even really played that one.

710
00:46:25,062 --> 00:46:26,143
[SPEAKER_04]: I played initial D3, though.

711
00:46:26,163 --> 00:46:26,743
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a fun time.

712
00:46:26,843 --> 00:46:28,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I'm sorry, go ahead.

713
00:46:29,919 --> 00:46:35,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and... Yeah, and what else?

714
00:46:36,824 --> 00:46:38,905
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say... Like the tuning system for the game.

715
00:46:39,806 --> 00:46:47,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Like... If you want to... Sorry.

716
00:46:48,693 --> 00:46:49,053
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright.

717
00:46:50,314 --> 00:46:53,737
[SPEAKER_04]: You were going to say another game that you thought was the worst of the year?

718
00:46:53,957 --> 00:46:54,898
[SPEAKER_09]: No, actually, no.

719
00:46:54,918 --> 00:46:56,199
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to bring up the...

720
00:46:56,974 --> 00:47:00,341
[SPEAKER_09]: whole customizing shop feature instead of

721
00:47:02,024 --> 00:47:19,017
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to eject your card three times just to get to that, so you have to point to another continuous screen, eject your card, and then put your coins in, and then start the game again, so that way you can get to the tuning shop faster.

722
00:47:19,298 --> 00:47:23,201
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, it's a way to keep sucking up your money and sucking up your tokens.

723
00:47:23,881 --> 00:47:31,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, that would only be in the case of if you had discounted continuous, like five coins to start and four coins to continue.

724
00:47:31,027 --> 00:47:31,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

725
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:32,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

726
00:47:33,722 --> 00:47:40,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, let's move on and stop talking about games that suck and let's talk about the best freaking game of 2007 in your opinion.

727
00:47:40,226 --> 00:47:41,387
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the best game in your opinion?

728
00:47:43,388 --> 00:47:44,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Maximum Tune 3.

729
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:46,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

730
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:49,652
[SPEAKER_04]: You must be a real racing game fan because you got both for your best and worst.

731
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:52,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Why was Maximum Tune 3 your best game of the year?

732
00:47:53,595 --> 00:47:55,656
[SPEAKER_09]: I like what they did with the battle system.

733
00:47:55,696 --> 00:48:01,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of picking a set course, you can now pick the route partway through the game.

734
00:48:01,857 --> 00:48:09,683
[SPEAKER_09]: They also added new courses, like, you can now race on the whole Wangen line instead of just, like, a six-kilometer stretch, which was pretty cool.

735
00:48:10,864 --> 00:48:14,367
[SPEAKER_09]: The soundtrack was pretty cool, more Yuzuka Shiro stuff.

736
00:48:14,607 --> 00:48:15,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

737
00:48:16,128 --> 00:48:23,874
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Ghost Bell system, like, the whole idea of racing a virtual opponent instead of them having to be there.

738
00:48:23,894 --> 00:48:31,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've been listening to the soundtrack to Maximum Tune 3 in my car recently, actually.

739
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:31,260
[SPEAKER_04]: It's

740
00:48:31,727 --> 00:48:34,868
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing I find about it, though, is if I listen to it too much, I drive too fast.

741
00:48:34,908 --> 00:48:37,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I speed way more often when I'm listening to Wangan music than anything else.

742
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:40,149
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

743
00:48:40,229 --> 00:48:40,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

744
00:48:41,549 --> 00:48:44,430
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in my CD player like 80% to 90% of the time.

745
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:52,012
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's music that was designed to put the pedal to the floor, and it happens in my real car.

746
00:48:52,052 --> 00:48:53,032
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only unfortunate thing.

747
00:48:54,775 --> 00:49:04,461
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the soundtrack and the graphics are meant to give the game a rave-ish look.

748
00:49:04,601 --> 00:49:11,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Several years ago, there was a game called Wangan Midnight, and the graphics and soundtrack were nothing like Maximum Tunes.

749
00:49:14,427 --> 00:49:19,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it happens that you have a series that's kind of similar, but I don't know.

750
00:49:20,151 --> 00:49:20,911
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you talking about?

751
00:49:21,732 --> 00:49:22,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

752
00:49:22,972 --> 00:49:23,593
[SPEAKER_09]: There were older...

753
00:49:24,694 --> 00:49:30,259
[SPEAKER_09]: One Good Midnight Games released in 2001, and they were based on Tokyo Extreme Racer.

754
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:35,343
[SPEAKER_09]: And they looked and sounded nothing like Maximum Tune.

755
00:49:35,983 --> 00:49:39,066
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess Maximum Tune was made to be more arcade-friendly.

756
00:49:41,828 --> 00:49:42,448
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it's true.

757
00:49:42,509 --> 00:49:46,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, One Good Midnight was actually... I was finding the stuff on the manga.

758
00:49:48,413 --> 00:49:50,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was a manga.

759
00:49:50,395 --> 00:49:50,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

760
00:49:51,698 --> 00:50:02,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, hey, GS68, we've got to let you go because we've got some more months to go over, but I'll leave you with this thought of us all raving in the car right now.

761
00:50:04,641 --> 00:50:06,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's drop some ecstasy while it's hot.

762
00:50:06,342 --> 00:50:06,922
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just kidding.

763
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:11,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we've got to let you go, GS68, but thank you so much and have a great 2008, alright?

764
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:12,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, you too.

765
00:50:13,183 --> 00:50:13,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, take care, buddy.

766
00:50:16,044 --> 00:50:19,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're looking for one more call to help us close out the year.

767
00:50:20,046 --> 00:50:20,646
[SPEAKER_04]: What is up, my friend?

768
00:50:20,666 --> 00:50:21,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing much, just waiting till tomorrow.

769
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:21,987
[SPEAKER_04]: What's tomorrow?

770
00:50:22,007 --> 00:50:22,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Waiting for that ball.

771
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:47,249
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that ball dropping in that middle of that big city on the face of the earth?

772
00:50:47,489 --> 00:50:48,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yes, I've heard of that before.

773
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:50,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going out to Times Square tomorrow?

774
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:52,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, probably not.

775
00:50:53,493 --> 00:50:55,134
[SPEAKER_10]: But I am getting drunk.

776
00:50:55,955 --> 00:50:56,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomorrow.

777
00:50:56,255 --> 00:50:57,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Legitimately.

778
00:50:57,616 --> 00:50:58,437
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not drunk now?

779
00:50:58,517 --> 00:50:59,237
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm with friends.

780
00:50:59,678 --> 00:50:59,858
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

781
00:51:00,078 --> 00:51:01,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, but you'll be drunk tomorrow.

782
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, just going over the year that was 2007 in gaming.

783
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:04,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh.

784
00:51:11,038 --> 00:51:13,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you ready to go over November with us?

785
00:51:15,048 --> 00:51:18,211
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, I don't know if my memory's still shady, but let's do it.

786
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:19,311
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll help you.

787
00:51:19,712 --> 00:51:22,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got four stories here to help remind you what happened in November.

788
00:51:23,134 --> 00:51:27,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode 254... Whoa, we just had a crash here in the studio.

789
00:51:27,297 --> 00:51:28,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's okay.

790
00:51:28,237 --> 00:51:29,298
[SPEAKER_04]: We're dropping the alcohol.

791
00:51:29,338 --> 00:51:30,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, the alcohol got dropped.

792
00:51:30,899 --> 00:51:41,086
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, episode number 254 was the week that Manhunt 2 on the PSP was hacksawed to remove some of the... And target, basically.

793
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:52,921
[SPEAKER_10]: and Target quickly rushed to judgment and pulled it off even though there's no way in hell you're going to get to it unless you have massive experience in PSP hacking.

794
00:51:52,961 --> 00:51:56,324
[SPEAKER_04]: But Loki, you did it the day this thing came out, didn't you?

795
00:51:56,344 --> 00:52:01,388
[SPEAKER_04]: You had your PSP stripped of the censored stuff in it.

796
00:52:02,048 --> 00:52:02,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it worth it?

797
00:52:02,889 --> 00:52:03,169
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

798
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:10,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it worth it for fucking genitals getting like, I don't know, you know, basically hurt

799
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,542
[SPEAKER_10]: His network got censored.

800
00:52:14,562 --> 00:52:18,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Weren't the generals, what do you call it, hurt?

801
00:52:19,505 --> 00:52:19,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

802
00:52:20,225 --> 00:52:21,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Electrocuted, mashed.

803
00:52:22,086 --> 00:52:23,767
[SPEAKER_05]: They were ripped off with pliers.

804
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:24,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Ew.

805
00:52:24,568 --> 00:52:25,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wow.

806
00:52:27,698 --> 00:52:30,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this game sounds pretty horrible.

807
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even play it.

808
00:52:31,861 --> 00:52:32,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to.

809
00:52:33,302 --> 00:52:33,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

810
00:52:33,862 --> 00:52:35,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode number 255.

811
00:52:35,263 --> 00:52:35,903
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the week.

812
00:52:36,183 --> 00:52:37,084
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a slow news week.

813
00:52:37,124 --> 00:52:38,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have a lot from this week.

814
00:52:38,685 --> 00:52:41,207
[SPEAKER_04]: NPD withholds sales numbers from the press.

815
00:52:41,647 --> 00:52:50,012
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, it is kind of relevant because, you know, obviously it kind of leaves it in the company's hands to be kind of bragging.

816
00:52:50,032 --> 00:52:53,754
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've seen companies kind of stretch these reports out a little bit.

817
00:52:54,014 --> 00:52:54,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course.

818
00:52:54,735 --> 00:52:56,256
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to appease their stockholders.

819
00:52:56,681 --> 00:52:57,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

820
00:52:58,903 --> 00:52:59,443
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell?

821
00:52:59,483 --> 00:53:00,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you at a 7-Eleven or something?

822
00:53:01,004 --> 00:53:05,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard a little phone go off.

823
00:53:05,227 --> 00:53:06,888
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like the phone's at 7-Eleven.

824
00:53:07,008 --> 00:53:09,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, my phone just went off.

825
00:53:09,229 --> 00:53:10,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Just keep coming quickly.

826
00:53:11,171 --> 00:53:11,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, sir.

827
00:53:13,032 --> 00:53:15,433
[SPEAKER_04]: When we say withhold, they didn't withhold everything.

828
00:53:15,473 --> 00:53:21,998
[SPEAKER_04]: They just reduced some of the information that was going out there and caused the companies to basically be on their own.

829
00:53:22,038 --> 00:53:23,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus Christ, you got a beeper, too?

830
00:53:27,732 --> 00:53:29,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we should get another caller.

831
00:53:29,233 --> 00:53:30,033
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got a pimp!

832
00:53:30,693 --> 00:53:33,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on a second.

833
00:53:33,374 --> 00:53:34,594
[SPEAKER_04]: You are not putting us on hold.

834
00:53:35,394 --> 00:53:37,095
[SPEAKER_04]: We will hang up on you.

835
00:53:37,115 --> 00:53:39,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, bye.

836
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:40,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, hello.

837
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:43,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

838
00:53:44,657 --> 00:53:47,298
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't believe we got put on hold by a caller.

839
00:53:47,338 --> 00:53:47,738
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no.

840
00:53:47,758 --> 00:53:48,198
[SPEAKER_10]: It was only quickly.

841
00:53:48,218 --> 00:53:48,639
[SPEAKER_10]: Strike one, Zaku.

842
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:49,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Episode 256 was the week.

843
00:53:49,399 --> 00:53:50,999
[SPEAKER_10]: What a way to end the year.

844
00:53:59,689 --> 00:54:05,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Week number 256, episode 256, that was the week that the Xbox download service was announced.

845
00:54:06,311 --> 00:54:11,253
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Xbox 360, you would be able to download original Xbox games to the service.

846
00:54:11,293 --> 00:54:14,934
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, we've seen this come out now, and you can get Psychonauts and Indigo Prophecy.

847
00:54:15,235 --> 00:54:18,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of a way to rediscover Xbox games you may have missed the first time around.

848
00:54:18,836 --> 00:54:21,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, for some people, a way overpriced way to do it.

849
00:54:23,137 --> 00:54:24,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, of course, the marketplace.

850
00:54:25,659 --> 00:54:36,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Who the hell would put price tags on fucking icons and themes and basically do it against the will of game developers as well when they don't want to charge for that shit, for downloadable content?

851
00:54:37,067 --> 00:54:37,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, do you agree?

852
00:54:39,188 --> 00:54:40,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Like Epic, for example.

853
00:54:40,369 --> 00:54:45,493
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't want to do that shit, but they're forced to because they have no choice most of the time.

854
00:54:45,893 --> 00:54:51,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do you think Unreal Tournament 3 is being held up for the 360 besides the user-created stuff?

855
00:54:51,753 --> 00:55:00,520
[SPEAKER_05]: It's being held up because they can't do cross-platform play between the PC and the... Well, they were doing it... But user-created mods is the other hinging factor.

856
00:55:01,441 --> 00:55:02,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they can worry about that later.

857
00:55:03,222 --> 00:55:06,024
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not really a factor to keep it from being released.

858
00:55:09,366 --> 00:55:11,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Jesus Christ, is someone at the door now?

859
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:14,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Just go through the last song, the last one.

860
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:15,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.

861
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:19,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero's 80s edition sued because the song is too similar.

862
00:55:19,834 --> 00:55:22,515
[SPEAKER_04]: The romantic sued Guitar Hero 80s edition.

863
00:55:23,016 --> 00:55:24,117
[SPEAKER_04]: And as we all know, they lost.

864
00:55:24,157 --> 00:55:25,297
[SPEAKER_04]: The judge laughed that out of court.

865
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:28,660
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, out of those stories, Manhunt 2, Guitar Hero.

866
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,160
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one.

867
00:55:30,321 --> 00:55:30,942
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, got it.

868
00:55:30,962 --> 00:55:33,163
[SPEAKER_04]: What, are you going to give us your best?

869
00:55:33,183 --> 00:55:36,606
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why you don't answer the phone.

870
00:55:36,646 --> 00:55:37,907
[SPEAKER_07]: You let it go to voicemail.

871
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:38,387
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

872
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Tony, you're the one that keeps answering the calls from him, man.

873
00:55:48,264 --> 00:55:49,225
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just not cool.

874
00:55:49,265 --> 00:55:50,286
[SPEAKER_05]: He's nipping in the butt.

875
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,148
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just not cool.

876
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:55,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

877
00:55:55,551 --> 00:56:00,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not offended because I think it's hilarious, honestly.

878
00:56:00,937 --> 00:56:02,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm offended.

879
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,180
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, the first one, bye.

880
00:56:05,321 --> 00:56:06,222
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

881
00:56:06,443 --> 00:56:06,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck that.

882
00:56:06,903 --> 00:56:07,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing December.

883
00:56:09,595 --> 00:56:11,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me open up Skype, see if anybody else wants to call.

884
00:56:11,896 --> 00:56:14,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's give it a couple minutes.

885
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:19,120
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

886
00:56:20,801 --> 00:56:23,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft in chat says, best call ever, ever.

887
00:56:25,464 --> 00:56:32,948
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody would like to call us and take Zaku's place, you can call us right now.

888
00:56:32,968 --> 00:56:36,970
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

889
00:56:40,407 --> 00:56:44,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to give it like 10 seconds, and I'm just going to say, Loki, fuck it, you can just do it.

890
00:56:46,674 --> 00:56:48,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

891
00:56:49,518 --> 00:56:50,018
[SPEAKER_04]: This is DT.

892
00:56:50,278 --> 00:56:53,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Praise be to God, Dark Tetsuya, how are you, my friend?

893
00:56:54,704 --> 00:56:55,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, good.

894
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:57,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Think you can do a better job than the last caller?

895
00:56:58,628 --> 00:56:59,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

896
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:00,010
Alright.

897
00:57:00,603 --> 00:57:01,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Manhunt 2, definitely.

898
00:57:01,683 --> 00:57:01,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

899
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:02,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

900
00:57:28,598 --> 00:57:28,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

901
00:57:28,718 --> 00:57:28,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

902
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:29,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

903
00:57:50,009 --> 00:57:51,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because people have that much free time.

904
00:58:15,385 --> 00:58:18,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, though, if no one brought it back up, would you still remember?

905
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:25,011
[SPEAKER_05]: I completely forgot about this, and thank God, because all you need to know is not to trust the bigger sites.

906
00:58:25,271 --> 00:58:26,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Trust us, because we're awesome.

907
00:58:26,892 --> 00:58:31,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I stand by what I said before, that there's multiple sides to every story.

908
00:58:31,434 --> 00:58:40,059
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, oddly enough, you would think me, of all people, would be the biggest critic of GameSpot in this situation, but I actually think people didn't give them enough credit.

909
00:58:40,667 --> 00:58:42,669
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're too quick to blame the big corpse.

910
00:58:42,989 --> 00:58:43,829
[SPEAKER_05]: I just didn't care.

911
00:58:43,969 --> 00:58:45,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I was getting annoyed at that point.

912
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:46,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, thank God they fired you.

913
00:58:46,691 --> 00:58:48,012
[SPEAKER_05]: This story's taking too long.

914
00:58:49,313 --> 00:58:51,194
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, there was other news in December.

915
00:58:51,555 --> 00:58:57,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode 259 was Nintendo pulls ads due to the high demand of the Nintendo Wii.

916
00:58:57,859 --> 00:59:02,522
[SPEAKER_04]: They basically said, okay, we can't make these Wiis fast enough.

917
00:59:02,941 --> 00:59:04,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody still wants one.

918
00:59:04,163 --> 00:59:07,787
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, maybe we'll hold off on the advertising until the first quarter next year.

919
00:59:07,807 --> 00:59:08,448
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense.

920
00:59:08,689 --> 00:59:14,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you're having no problem selling one item, why do you need to advertise it?

921
00:59:14,276 --> 00:59:21,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Advertise for one that may not be selling as well, and they have a little bit more of, so it makes sense to me.

922
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:28,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode 260, DVR and Internet Radio launches on Sony PSPs in Japan.

923
00:59:48,334 --> 01:00:00,198
[SPEAKER_04]: and in part A we talked about Akira Yamaoka comes out and says that Japanese development's in trouble and that the American development's where it's at right now and of course Silent Hill 5 is being developed right here in America.

924
01:00:00,538 --> 01:00:05,520
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think out of those four stories DarkSakura had the biggest impact on gaming in 2007?

925
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:16,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff Gertzman in the fallout there, Nintendo pulling ads due to the Wii demand, DVR and internet radio hits the PSP or Akira Yamaoka saying that development is...

926
01:00:18,231 --> 01:00:19,391
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in America is where it's at.

927
01:00:21,052 --> 01:00:22,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Gershman, definitely.

928
01:00:22,932 --> 01:00:24,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that's kind of a no-brainer.

929
01:00:24,433 --> 01:00:25,613
[SPEAKER_04]: But why do you say that?

930
01:00:25,653 --> 01:00:27,314
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think is the fallout that that could have in 2008?

931
01:00:27,354 --> 01:00:30,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

932
01:00:30,574 --> 01:00:44,558
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like back in the day, I don't know if you remember, it was when EGM gave Super Street Fighter 2 poor scores, Capcom full of advertising.

933
01:00:46,363 --> 01:00:47,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in March.

934
01:00:47,163 --> 01:00:47,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

935
01:00:47,383 --> 01:00:47,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

936
01:01:06,251 --> 01:01:10,534
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and again, as I do a lot, I compare things to the movie industry.

937
01:01:10,894 --> 01:01:31,448
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, just because Siskel and Ebert might give a movie a bad review, well, Siskel doesn't review anything anymore, but just because Ebert and Roper, Ebert gives a thumbs up, Siskel's, just because Ebert and Roper might give something a bad review doesn't mean that suddenly, you know, they're going to stop advertising in the Chicago newspapers.

938
01:01:31,508 --> 01:01:34,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Siskel, get me out of Ebert's stomach.

939
01:01:39,115 --> 01:01:39,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, forget it.

940
01:01:39,956 --> 01:01:40,977
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been plenty of time.

941
01:01:41,037 --> 01:01:42,318
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not too soon anymore.

942
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:43,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I want this show to be over.

943
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:46,162
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to get to the best and worst games of the year.

944
01:01:46,223 --> 01:01:49,987
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya, in your big opinion, what was the worst freaking game of 2007?

945
01:01:50,087 --> 01:01:52,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God.

946
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:57,315
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't really played all that much, so I guess I'll go with Yaris.

947
01:01:59,344 --> 01:02:00,785
[SPEAKER_04]: When in doubt, Yaris, right?

948
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:01,626
[SPEAKER_04]: When in doubt.

949
01:02:02,326 --> 01:02:04,648
[SPEAKER_04]: You drive a car with a claw.

950
01:02:05,268 --> 01:02:06,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Enough said.

951
01:02:06,209 --> 01:02:09,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, what was the best game of 2007 in your opinion?

952
01:02:10,672 --> 01:02:12,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh god, I just rented it.

953
01:02:12,233 --> 01:02:13,534
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Mario Galaxy.

954
01:02:15,535 --> 01:02:16,396
[SPEAKER_04]: And why this game?

955
01:02:18,717 --> 01:02:23,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's what Super Mario 64 2 should have been.

956
01:02:24,341 --> 01:02:26,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of what we got on the GameCube, Super Mario Sunshine?

957
01:02:26,963 --> 01:02:27,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

958
01:02:28,124 --> 01:02:28,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.

959
01:02:29,073 --> 01:02:30,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

960
01:02:30,933 --> 01:02:32,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

961
01:02:35,094 --> 01:02:36,074
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's about it.

962
01:02:37,015 --> 01:02:37,395
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

963
01:02:38,415 --> 01:02:38,735
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

964
01:02:38,795 --> 01:02:42,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Dark Tetsuya, thanks so much for calling and helping us out with the rest of the year.

965
01:02:42,696 --> 01:02:43,316
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

966
01:02:43,356 --> 01:02:43,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.

967
01:02:43,956 --> 01:02:45,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you too.

968
01:02:45,457 --> 01:02:45,777
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

969
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:47,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

970
01:02:48,457 --> 01:02:53,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Tetsuya, of course, writes for our website once in a while when there's news to report on.

971
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:56,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Legend of Zaku posted his pics in chat.

972
01:02:57,634 --> 01:03:23,304
[SPEAKER_04]: He would have picked God of War 2 for the best game of the year And Kane and Lynch for the worst game of the year Well, haha, you were answering the phone while you were on the phone with us So yours doesn't count, rude person But there you have it, if you were curious Alright, that took us through the whole year What a trip down memory lane, what a long trip down memory lane I don't remember A fucking lot's happened this year A lot's happened this year

973
01:03:25,126 --> 01:03:25,647
[SPEAKER_04]: ManHunt2 ManHunt2 ManHunt2

974
01:03:56,969 --> 01:03:57,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it Smash Bros.

975
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:58,570
[SPEAKER_04]: getting delayed?

976
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:01,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it Codemasters and the broken Bubble Bobble game?

977
01:04:01,432 --> 01:04:08,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it the lady dying over the Nintendo Wii that so many people wanted a Wii that she drank so much she died?

978
01:04:09,398 --> 01:04:10,558
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was Proteus.

979
01:04:11,379 --> 01:04:11,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Proteus?

980
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:14,561
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say probably the biggest story of the year.

981
01:04:14,661 --> 01:04:14,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

982
01:04:15,001 --> 01:04:17,583
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, it's the Bubble Bobble thing.

983
01:04:18,164 --> 01:04:22,987
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is because seriously, seriously, how do you do that?

984
01:04:24,048 --> 01:04:24,808
[SPEAKER_04]: How does that happen?

985
01:04:24,828 --> 01:04:25,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

986
01:04:25,409 --> 01:04:25,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

987
01:04:28,663 --> 01:04:29,283
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's just me.

988
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:37,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I would say... Not Bubble Bobble.

989
01:04:39,146 --> 01:04:41,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously, how many people bought Bubble Bobble?

990
01:04:41,807 --> 01:04:43,908
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that affected what, five people?

991
01:04:43,988 --> 01:04:44,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously.

992
01:04:47,469 --> 01:04:53,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say probably... I don't know.

993
01:04:54,754 --> 01:05:02,521
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact that it's a crime that Activision released three Guitar Hero games this year, huh?

994
01:05:03,662 --> 01:05:04,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a crime.

995
01:05:05,424 --> 01:05:08,887
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, let me think.

996
01:05:11,987 --> 01:05:13,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that last year or this year?

997
01:05:13,488 --> 01:05:16,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember when Red Octane was purchased by Activision.

998
01:05:17,209 --> 01:05:17,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year.

999
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:18,350
[SPEAKER_05]: That was last year.

1000
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:20,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well let's move on.

1001
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:25,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about our top five games of the year and our picks for the worst game of the year.

1002
01:05:25,712 --> 01:05:27,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get the worst out of the way.

1003
01:05:27,733 --> 01:05:28,713
[SPEAKER_04]: The worst game of the year.

1004
01:05:28,733 --> 01:05:31,994
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to tally it up with what the listeners say and figure it out here.

1005
01:05:32,335 --> 01:05:34,175
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what in your opinion was the worst game of the year?

1006
01:05:34,655 --> 01:05:35,276
[SPEAKER_07]: The worst game?

1007
01:05:35,316 --> 01:05:36,336
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually have a list of five.

1008
01:05:37,077 --> 01:05:38,298
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a list of five.

1009
01:05:38,338 --> 01:05:38,778
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1010
01:05:38,858 --> 01:05:39,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Worst games of the year.

1011
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:45,482
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to say Manhunt 2 was one of them just because, you know, I got sick of hearing all the crap.

1012
01:05:45,562 --> 01:05:46,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine Babies.

1013
01:05:47,984 --> 01:05:49,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Although that was a funny picture with you.

1014
01:05:49,585 --> 01:05:50,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything with the Bratz franchise.

1015
01:05:51,766 --> 01:05:53,467
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll say Yaris 2 just because.

1016
01:05:54,067 --> 01:05:55,728
[SPEAKER_07]: But I got warning so I didn't play it.

1017
01:05:56,469 --> 01:06:00,531
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I have to put this one on here for sauce.

1018
01:06:00,751 --> 01:06:01,672
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a quote from...

1019
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:08,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Heroes of Mana is the worst game of 2007 because you need a doctorate in electrical engineering to understand how to play the fucking game.

1020
01:06:09,606 --> 01:06:10,767
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to pick that one.

1021
01:06:10,887 --> 01:06:11,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Heroes of Mana.

1022
01:06:11,448 --> 01:06:12,108
[SPEAKER_07]: On her suggestion.

1023
01:06:12,429 --> 01:06:15,532
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn, the Mana games started sucking after Secret of Mana, didn't they?

1024
01:06:16,132 --> 01:06:17,393
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very unfortunate.

1025
01:06:17,534 --> 01:06:21,637
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish that we had gotten, um, uh, Second Sense 2.

1026
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:23,439
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know in the virtual console.

1027
01:06:23,459 --> 01:06:23,900
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.

1028
01:06:24,901 --> 01:06:25,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki!

1029
01:06:25,321 --> 01:06:25,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki!

1030
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:28,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Your pick for the worst fucking game of 2007.

1031
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I, too, had five.

1032
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, six, if you can't... Jeez, I only had one.

1033
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:32,781
[SPEAKER_04]: This is easy.

1034
01:06:32,801 --> 01:06:37,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was thinking... I am my... Okay, my number one is not yours.

1035
01:06:38,122 --> 01:06:38,582
[SPEAKER_05]: But, anyways.

1036
01:06:40,442 --> 01:06:46,504
[SPEAKER_05]: So, number six, Offroad Extreme Special Edition, although I did not play it, but it was horrible.

1037
01:06:46,944 --> 01:06:49,345
[SPEAKER_05]: I did play this game, Counterforce, for the Wii.

1038
01:06:49,865 --> 01:06:51,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Yet another game by Conspiracy Entertainment.

1039
01:06:51,605 --> 01:06:55,526
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, my number three would be anything from Conspiracy Entertainment.

1040
01:06:57,076 --> 01:07:15,373
[SPEAKER_05]: or actually that'd be number four number three I actually this was the only the first and only game I will ever import for the PS3 Wangen Midnight is a fucking joke on the PlayStation 3 it is poor for a PlayStation 2 game I hated it it was a waste of $60

1041
01:07:16,844 --> 01:07:32,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Yaris is number two and the reason it's number two is because it's free number one I paid fucking fifty dollars for and it was a ripoff Transformers the game the worst biggest disappointment of a game this year how do you fuck that up but you did

1042
01:07:34,861 --> 01:07:36,523
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1043
01:07:54,065 --> 01:08:13,002
[SPEAKER_04]: and the way it was packaged it just felt so rushed it was just a steaming pile of poo I hated I mean there's not a lot of times I go I really fucking hate this game I hate Fusion Frenzy 2 so much that game was awful

1044
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:14,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Awful, awful, awful.

1045
01:08:14,902 --> 01:08:16,423
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's definitely the worst game of the year.

1046
01:08:16,603 --> 01:08:20,484
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't believe that's highway robbery that they ever tried to charge full price for that game.

1047
01:08:20,624 --> 01:08:21,524
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot.

1048
01:08:22,165 --> 01:08:24,005
[SPEAKER_04]: My wallet was raped by that game.

1049
01:08:24,245 --> 01:08:25,546
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot one more.

1050
01:08:27,686 --> 01:08:30,767
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an honorable mention, I guess, because it is also free.

1051
01:08:32,748 --> 01:08:36,649
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember the vision camera from Microsoft.

1052
01:08:37,289 --> 01:08:38,750
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

1053
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:40,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Totem Ball.

1054
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:41,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't the vision cam last year?

1055
01:08:41,591 --> 01:08:42,691
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was this year.

1056
01:08:42,871 --> 01:08:43,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it?

1057
01:08:43,547 --> 01:08:46,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Yaris definitely runs away with the title of the worst game of 2007.

1058
01:09:11,325 --> 01:09:12,305
[SPEAKER_04]: SuperMarioGalaxy RockBand

1059
01:09:38,931 --> 01:09:41,352
[SPEAKER_07]: because, again, super cool, and Radiohead.

1060
01:09:41,992 --> 01:09:43,612
[SPEAKER_07]: And one, Portal, duh.

1061
01:09:44,512 --> 01:09:45,033
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's it.

1062
01:09:45,913 --> 01:09:46,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Enough said, huh?

1063
01:09:46,713 --> 01:09:48,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Portal was just super innovative.

1064
01:09:49,174 --> 01:09:51,094
[SPEAKER_07]: And I love anything that messes with physics.

1065
01:09:52,114 --> 01:09:57,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I would totally be a physics major if it wasn't for all the retarded math.

1066
01:09:59,576 --> 01:09:59,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1067
01:10:00,776 --> 01:10:01,317
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1068
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:03,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki!

1069
01:10:04,131 --> 01:10:04,632
[SPEAKER_04]: GhostSquad

1070
01:10:27,478 --> 01:10:33,160
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the most underrated games, at least for the Wii Zapper that's come out for the Wii this year.

1071
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:34,120
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cheap.

1072
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:35,700
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably going to get cheaper.

1073
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,341
[SPEAKER_05]: And granted, the graphics aren't that great.

1074
01:10:38,421 --> 01:10:40,261
[SPEAKER_05]: The game is incredibly short.

1075
01:10:40,762 --> 01:10:44,783
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will tell you, I played that game through like six times in a row.

1076
01:10:45,163 --> 01:10:49,604
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact that you can unlock like 50 different weapons in the game, that makes the games even harder.

1077
01:10:50,484 --> 01:10:53,765
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know, it was the most fun I had for about four hours.

1078
01:10:54,517 --> 01:11:23,011
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's all I've played of it so far but um Ghost Squad definitely worth picking up on the Wii if you like gun games um Rock Band fun um I have to give it props because I bought Guitar Hero 2 and I bought Guitar Hero for the Playstation I played it like once and I said fuck this and put it down and that's where it gathered dust Rock Band I actually played for a lot more than that and it's actually pretty fun um

1079
01:11:24,372 --> 01:11:41,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wish there was an easier way to be able to play online with multiple people, like, you know, in a world mode or something like that, but definitely a fun game and I really, it's actually one of the games I actually look forward to the download content coming out for it, which, you know, I can't really say that about many other games.

1080
01:11:42,341 --> 01:11:43,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.

1081
01:11:43,682 --> 01:11:44,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Bioshock.

1082
01:11:45,402 --> 01:11:46,823
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a great game while it lasted.

1083
01:11:47,243 --> 01:11:48,884
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought maybe a little bit short.

1084
01:11:50,585 --> 01:11:52,446
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, not a whole lot of replays

1085
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:54,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Playability, but I had fun while playing it.

1086
01:11:55,487 --> 01:11:56,527
[SPEAKER_05]: That takes us to number one.

1087
01:11:57,408 --> 01:11:58,148
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's... Oh, whoops.

1088
01:11:58,668 --> 01:11:59,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Number three.

1089
01:11:59,109 --> 01:11:59,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't count.

1090
01:11:59,749 --> 01:11:59,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1091
01:12:00,769 --> 01:12:02,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, Crackdown.

1092
01:12:03,151 --> 01:12:06,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Best thing for a futuristic Grand Theft Auto.

1093
01:12:06,893 --> 01:12:07,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely fun.

1094
01:12:07,933 --> 01:12:11,295
[SPEAKER_05]: The most fun I've had in a demo for a game, ever.

1095
01:12:12,296 --> 01:12:14,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely fun to play online.

1096
01:12:14,217 --> 01:12:18,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, that fizzles away pretty quick, and the game kind of repetitive.

1097
01:12:18,819 --> 01:12:20,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Had some pretty good download content for it.

1098
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually went back to it.

1099
01:12:22,074 --> 01:12:23,535
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1100
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:58,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to try to get the five achievements that are in it, Earth Defense Force 2017.

1101
01:12:58,515 --> 01:13:01,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely the best $20 you'll ever spend.

1102
01:13:01,197 --> 01:13:03,678
[SPEAKER_05]: If you find it used, you can probably find it for even cheaper than that.

1103
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:12,223
[SPEAKER_05]: D3 really, really, really needs to bring over the simple series over here because it's absolutely, you know, good money.

1104
01:13:12,303 --> 01:13:15,164
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the cheesiest, weirdest games you'll ever play.

1105
01:13:15,504 --> 01:13:18,506
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, because they're so weird, they don't end up coming over here.

1106
01:13:19,006 --> 01:13:20,047
[SPEAKER_05]: But I hope that changes.

1107
01:13:22,406 --> 01:13:23,046
[SPEAKER_04]: My turn.

1108
01:13:23,867 --> 01:13:24,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Top five games of the year.

1109
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:31,149
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not surprised, Earth Defense Force 2017, for you, because you are a guy that's all about fun, and, you know, blowing shit up is fun.

1110
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:37,412
[SPEAKER_05]: You can blow up, you can level entire cities, and then they come back to the next level, and you can level them all over again.

1111
01:13:37,632 --> 01:13:42,754
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, seriously, we've played it for, I don't know how many hours.

1112
01:13:42,994 --> 01:13:44,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I have it logged in the game.

1113
01:13:44,354 --> 01:13:46,295
[SPEAKER_05]: It's over 70 hours, I know that.

1114
01:13:46,435 --> 01:13:46,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1115
01:13:47,642 --> 01:13:48,283
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1116
01:14:01,195 --> 01:14:10,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Puzzle Quest was an amazing game that took Bejeweled and just put little twists on it that made a whole role-playing game out of it and a more competitive type of game out of it.

1117
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:23,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Puzzle Quest was an amazing game.

1118
01:14:23,706 --> 01:14:25,087
[SPEAKER_04]: It was my number five game of the year.

1119
01:14:25,107 --> 01:14:25,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1120
01:14:46,727 --> 01:14:51,691
[SPEAKER_04]: My number four game of the year is one of those games that probably most critics aren't even going to put on their top ten.

1121
01:14:52,071 --> 01:15:02,039
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me, it was so great to finally see a true Japanese role-playing style game on a next-gen console and to see what it could do.

1122
01:15:02,139 --> 01:15:06,803
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought the story in this game was so amazing, yet kind of depressing.

1123
01:15:06,943 --> 01:15:08,805
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way that it wove...

1124
01:15:09,662 --> 01:15:25,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Real life in with this fictional scenario was just something really innovative and new and that's why Eternal Sonata for me was just a different type of gaming experience that I really enjoyed and had to be in my top five for the year, absolutely.

1125
01:15:26,486 --> 01:15:30,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Say what you want about it getting stale towards the end or what have you or

1126
01:15:31,465 --> 01:15:32,525
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1127
01:15:58,809 --> 01:15:59,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1128
01:16:17,341 --> 01:16:33,893
[SPEAKER_04]: My number two game of the year is all about fun and I did not think that this game was going to be so great because my expectations I guess were actually a little bit low because like I said earlier in the show I was not a big fan of Mario 64 as much as the next guy but Super Mario Galaxy just blew me away.

1129
01:16:33,973 --> 01:16:38,397
[SPEAKER_04]: It is so much fun and is really the type of game that I think the Wii was built for.

1130
01:16:39,237 --> 01:16:41,879
[SPEAKER_04]: So Super Mario Galaxy is absolutely my number two game of the year.

1131
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:43,981
[SPEAKER_04]: And that takes me to the number one game of the year

1132
01:16:46,184 --> 01:16:50,866
[SPEAKER_04]: I admit it, I do not like to spend as much money as I do on gaming.

1133
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:55,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I spend a lot of money on games, and that is why value is so important to me.

1134
01:16:56,669 --> 01:17:04,092
[SPEAKER_04]: And in my opinion, there is no better value out there in gaming right now, period, than the Orange Box.

1135
01:17:04,772 --> 01:17:12,716
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is one of the sole reasons why the Orange Box is my game of the year, because you get these great, you know, obviously Half-Life is an incredible series of games, Team Fortress 2...

1136
01:17:14,268 --> 01:17:15,909
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of fun.

1137
01:17:15,929 --> 01:17:20,491
[SPEAKER_04]: And the unique art style of Team Fortress 2 really kind of sets it apart from the other games.

1138
01:17:22,451 --> 01:17:23,612
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, Portal.

1139
01:17:24,132 --> 01:17:33,356
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Portal is kind of like... When you play Portal, you feel like you're starting to play the next great series of games.

1140
01:17:33,776 --> 01:17:38,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, something truly original has kind of started with Portal that I think is going to kind of continue.

1141
01:17:38,898 --> 01:17:42,239
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have all these kind of in-jokes and the whole, like, the cake is a lie.

1142
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:43,640
[SPEAKER_04]: And, like, you know, not...

1143
01:17:44,142 --> 01:17:49,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Every game, especially its first time out the gate, can kind of create that kind of buzz.

1144
01:17:49,965 --> 01:17:54,107
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Orange Box absolutely is the best game that came out in 2007.

1145
01:17:54,147 --> 01:17:58,128
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not only the best deal in gaming, but just some of the most solid games you're going to get.

1146
01:17:58,669 --> 01:18:00,510
[SPEAKER_04]: And the best 60 bucks you can spend on games.

1147
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:02,190
[SPEAKER_04]: So there it is.

1148
01:18:03,271 --> 01:18:04,431
[SPEAKER_04]: My top five games of the year.

1149
01:18:04,792 --> 01:18:05,732
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's tally it up.

1150
01:18:07,113 --> 01:18:11,855
[SPEAKER_04]: We have, let's see, one vote for Call of Duty 4, one vote for Maximum Toon 3.

1151
01:18:13,732 --> 01:18:16,413
[SPEAKER_04]: One vote for Earth Defense Force 2017.

1152
01:18:17,194 --> 01:18:19,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Two votes for Super Mario Galaxy.

1153
01:18:19,854 --> 01:18:24,736
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you combine Portal with Orange Box, you get four votes for Portal and Orange Box this year.

1154
01:18:24,796 --> 01:18:29,278
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to have to say that Orange Box is collectively Orange Lounge Radio's Game of the Year.

1155
01:18:29,298 --> 01:18:33,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I did say Half-Life 2 earlier for one of my ones that didn't make the list.

1156
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:34,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so, you know.

1157
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:35,760
[SPEAKER_07]: It's part of it.

1158
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:36,901
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of just applied again.

1159
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:37,661
[SPEAKER_05]: It came out this year.

1160
01:18:38,301 --> 01:18:40,362
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it's ironic.

1161
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:44,571
[SPEAKER_04]: because I remember when I first heard about this game, The Orange Box, I was like, oh, isn't that funny?

1162
01:18:44,611 --> 01:18:47,033
[SPEAKER_04]: We're Orange Launch Radio and here's this game, The Orange Box.

1163
01:18:47,233 --> 01:18:48,874
[SPEAKER_04]: I built a computer called The Orange Box.

1164
01:18:49,054 --> 01:18:54,738
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's also funny about it is that I remember saying, I was kind of like, oh, these are the, oh, we're not, I'm not really into these kind of games.

1165
01:18:54,878 --> 01:18:56,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really like the first person shooters.

1166
01:18:56,799 --> 01:18:58,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Portal, it's a shooter.

1167
01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to like that.

1168
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:07,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Portal makes me enjoy first person shooters because it's, it's a different, I mean, I think even people that don't enjoy first person shooters can enjoy Portal.

1169
01:19:08,186 --> 01:19:09,487
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what makes the game so great.

1170
01:19:10,468 --> 01:19:10,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Well,

1171
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:11,760
[SPEAKER_04]: There you have it.

1172
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:13,560
[SPEAKER_04]: The Orange Box.

1173
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:16,541
[SPEAKER_04]: And no, we are not changing our name to Orange Box Lounge Radio.

1174
01:19:16,601 --> 01:19:17,981
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be no fun at all.

1175
01:19:18,001 --> 01:19:20,462
[SPEAKER_04]: But the Orange Box is collectively our game of the year.

1176
01:19:23,082 --> 01:19:24,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Which takes us to 2008.

1177
01:19:24,262 --> 01:19:26,363
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys think?

1178
01:19:26,483 --> 01:19:28,243
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think is going to happen in 2008?

1179
01:19:28,723 --> 01:19:29,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Any predictions you want to make for 2008?

1180
01:19:29,944 --> 01:19:30,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

1181
01:19:30,064 --> 01:19:30,324
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1182
01:19:30,344 --> 01:19:30,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Gosh.

1183
01:19:40,043 --> 01:19:41,183
[SPEAKER_05]: DS Redesigned Halo Wars Fable 2 Spore

1184
01:20:09,790 --> 01:20:11,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue and Black DS in February.

1185
01:20:11,551 --> 01:20:12,611
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1186
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:15,552
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1187
01:20:39,537 --> 01:20:41,819
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, any predictions you want to make for the year 2008?

1188
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Duke Nukem, no.

1189
01:20:46,082 --> 01:20:50,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Duke Nukem Forever will fucking come out at some point, and it'll be disappointing.

1190
01:20:52,287 --> 01:20:56,010
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that Super Smash Bros.

1191
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:57,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Brawl will get pushed again.

1192
01:20:59,092 --> 01:21:00,153
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep expecting it.

1193
01:21:00,593 --> 01:21:01,114
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1194
01:21:01,614 --> 01:21:04,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's something that's kind of interesting, and I've actually looked at it.

1195
01:21:05,477 --> 01:21:06,638
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been kind of following it a little bit.

1196
01:21:07,869 --> 01:21:10,931
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved Saints Row, and we still play it every day.

1197
01:21:11,432 --> 01:21:15,135
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of is holding us over until Grand Theft Auto 4.

1198
01:21:15,435 --> 01:21:20,020
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, Saints Row 2 is supposed to be coming out, I think, this year, or 2008.

1199
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:21,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Tomorrow!

1200
01:21:22,642 --> 01:21:23,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I wish.

1201
01:21:24,343 --> 01:21:25,925
[SPEAKER_05]: 2008, and it actually looks pretty good.

1202
01:21:26,225 --> 01:21:30,389
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm kind of wondering, you know, I know Grand Theft Auto 4 is going to be amazing, but

1203
01:21:31,639 --> 01:21:33,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Predictions I'm going to make...

1204
01:22:02,702 --> 01:22:12,745
[SPEAKER_04]: In the third or fourth quarter of 2008, Sony will redesign the PlayStation 3 and do an effective relaunch, a reboot of the system the way maybe they should have done it the first time.

1205
01:22:12,985 --> 01:22:17,686
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reboot will include a playable demo of Final Fantasy XIII that's going to blow everybody away.

1206
01:22:18,886 --> 01:22:30,370
[SPEAKER_04]: But Metal Gear Solid 4 will not single-handedly save the PlayStation 3 and that's what's going to want to cause them to really cut corners in the cost and they're going to release this system just as dirt cheap as possible to try and get people to buy it.

1207
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:31,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1208
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:58,901
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody will challenge Nintendo to the throne of handheld gaming and it won't be Sony I think in 2008 I think this year this is a very just out there prediction I don't know I get the feeling Nintendo has such a large share of the marketplace in handheld I think someone else wants a piece of that besides Sony but I don't think it's Microsoft I think someone else I think someone we don't know about yet is going to come in and challenge Nintendo for the throne in 2008 um

1209
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:07,839
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of folks in the chat room are insinuating it might be Sega.

1210
01:23:09,881 --> 01:23:10,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

1211
01:23:10,962 --> 01:23:11,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1212
01:23:12,163 --> 01:23:13,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Their games have not been... I don't know.

1213
01:23:14,465 --> 01:23:16,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Sega and Nintendo have been kind of working together.

1214
01:23:17,287 --> 01:23:19,349
[SPEAKER_04]: And Sega also have tried handheld and they failed.

1215
01:23:19,689 --> 01:23:20,209
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.

1216
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:23,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't say no, but I don't think it would be Sega.

1217
01:23:23,392 --> 01:23:26,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's going to be somebody that's known for gaming.

1218
01:23:27,055 --> 01:23:29,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to be somebody that's known for electronics.

1219
01:23:29,898 --> 01:23:31,439
[SPEAKER_04]: is going to try and get in here.

1220
01:23:31,499 --> 01:23:33,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of like what Sony did when they got into the gaming market.

1221
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:38,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I think somebody who's known for electronics now is going to try to challenge Nintendo for the gaming throne.

1222
01:23:39,043 --> 01:23:39,463
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see.

1223
01:23:39,783 --> 01:23:40,484
[SPEAKER_04]: For handheld gaming.

1224
01:23:41,484 --> 01:23:47,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the Wii colors will come out finally this year, and I think they'll come out just in time for the holiday season.

1225
01:23:47,508 --> 01:23:49,369
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to get the Wiis in the different colors finally.

1226
01:23:50,389 --> 01:23:54,151
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think something will happen to address the storage issues on the Wii.

1227
01:23:54,692 --> 01:23:55,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I think...

1228
01:23:56,081 --> 01:23:59,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if the color systems are going to necessarily come with more onboard memory.

1229
01:24:00,003 --> 01:24:03,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a feeling they will, but it's not going to be a major increase, just a slight one.

1230
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:04,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what do they have now, 512 megs?

1231
01:24:04,746 --> 01:24:06,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 512.

1232
01:24:06,146 --> 01:24:08,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I say they up the internal memory to 2 gigs.

1233
01:24:09,908 --> 01:24:13,290
[SPEAKER_04]: But there'll be a firmware that will improve the SD card support.

1234
01:24:13,310 --> 01:24:21,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see that, because with the price of, you know, flash RAM, I mean, it's going to... This shit gets cheaper every day, so...

1235
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:23,301
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't see why they wouldn't do that.

1236
01:24:23,662 --> 01:24:30,968
[SPEAKER_05]: I could also see the DS with the onboard storage for downloadable games, virtual console for the DS, so to speak, I guess.

1237
01:24:32,450 --> 01:24:34,151
[SPEAKER_05]: I could see something definitely like that.

1238
01:24:34,832 --> 01:24:37,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to think what else would be.

1239
01:24:37,755 --> 01:24:39,897
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation redesign, I could see that.

1240
01:24:40,317 --> 01:24:45,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Might even see a 360 redesign, especially if they get it cooler and stuff.

1241
01:24:48,297 --> 01:24:56,164
[SPEAKER_04]: and let's see, I don't want to take this on too much longer with just predictions I'm pulling out of my ass, but just, you know, I think there's a possibility some of these things will happen.

1242
01:24:56,744 --> 01:25:09,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Nintendo, I think the big Christmas game they're going to reveal, I think Animal Crossing is going to be their big winner game, and I think it is going to be an MMO, and it is going to be a bit MySpace-y.

1243
01:25:09,596 --> 01:25:13,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there is going to be a social element to it that no other game has really done yet.

1244
01:25:13,979 --> 01:25:15,721
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's going to be their big winner game.

1245
01:25:16,448 --> 01:25:20,609
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also think this will be the year that Kid Icarus is finally revived.

1246
01:25:21,470 --> 01:25:22,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, call it my gut.

1247
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:26,231
[SPEAKER_04]: And Guardian Legend finally comes to Virtual Console and we all collectively orgasm.

1248
01:25:26,271 --> 01:25:28,872
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see them coming out with some more peripherals for the system.

1249
01:25:29,112 --> 01:25:29,673
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got to.

1250
01:25:30,013 --> 01:25:32,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what, the nunchuck and, you know, classic controller?

1251
01:25:32,834 --> 01:25:34,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, come on, you guys.

1252
01:25:34,794 --> 01:25:35,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

1253
01:25:36,015 --> 01:25:40,056
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to fucking redesign the damn remote to, uh, or make a gun thing.

1254
01:25:40,456 --> 01:25:44,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised someone hasn't hacked the remote yet to figure out how to get, you know, key presses from there, because...

1255
01:25:45,131 --> 01:25:46,253
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1256
01:25:56,002 --> 01:25:59,484
[SPEAKER_04]: And not to leave Microsoft out, I'm going to make a bold prediction for them.

1257
01:26:00,585 --> 01:26:08,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I say because this latest update has shown that they can do buffering video and they can do it very well, like if you watch the Inside Xbox stuff, that all works out very well.

1258
01:26:09,471 --> 01:26:16,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Microsoft is going to make a Web 2.0 move this year, and I think you're going to see something YouTube-y come to the Xbox 360.

1259
01:26:18,056 --> 01:26:20,378
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be the reason to get a camera if you don't already have one.

1260
01:26:21,511 --> 01:26:22,171
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1261
01:26:41,903 --> 01:26:46,504
[SPEAKER_04]: But this week it's very special because these are the FUs of the year.

1262
01:26:46,924 --> 01:26:50,265
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are the things that have pissed us off the most above anything else the entire year.

1263
01:26:50,325 --> 01:26:52,766
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, why don't you start us off tonight with the FUs of the year.

1264
01:26:52,786 --> 01:27:03,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess my FU of the year is going to go towards...

1265
01:27:12,549 --> 01:27:18,351
[SPEAKER_07]: The City of Citrus Heights for the crap they're doing regarding massage therapist business licenses.

1266
01:27:19,711 --> 01:27:25,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because that completely interferes with a year's worth of hard work I've put into making my business happen.

1267
01:27:26,213 --> 01:27:27,434
[SPEAKER_07]: So, fuck you.

1268
01:27:29,254 --> 01:27:29,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1269
01:27:30,255 --> 01:27:31,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your FU of the year.

1270
01:27:32,396 --> 01:27:36,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have anything that's really all-consuming for the entire year, but for this week at least,

1271
01:27:37,421 --> 01:28:05,136
[SPEAKER_05]: F you at Nvidia and your crappy graphics drivers because for whatever reason whenever I reboot my computer not only does it not save my settings to what screen resolution I have if it did for whatever reason actually boot up in my desired resolution it flashes black and then back to the picture and blacks out again and constantly does that until I change the graphics to a different aspect ratio and then change it back it's fucking annoying

1272
01:28:07,352 --> 01:28:10,495
[SPEAKER_04]: and my FU of the year goes to bugs.

1273
01:28:11,676 --> 01:28:13,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Because bugs suck.

1274
01:28:13,818 --> 01:28:16,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially flies that fly around in the room when you're trying to do a show.

1275
01:28:18,161 --> 01:28:18,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1276
01:28:19,542 --> 01:28:20,283
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it.

1277
01:28:21,544 --> 01:28:24,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless there's any last minute things anybody wants to say?

1278
01:28:24,667 --> 01:28:24,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1279
01:28:25,387 --> 01:28:26,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knew?

1280
01:28:26,108 --> 01:28:26,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Loki.

1281
01:28:27,950 --> 01:28:35,216
[SPEAKER_05]: In case you didn't catch that earlier when I was talking about it, No More Heroes has moved up to January, or at least the end of January, so it's moved up a week.

1282
01:28:35,822 --> 01:28:36,782
[SPEAKER_05]: So, hooray!

1283
01:28:36,802 --> 01:28:39,443
[SPEAKER_05]: You get to play the game even sooner in the United States.

1284
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:50,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, there's a thing going around right now where some of the nunchucks that Nintendo has put out recently, I don't know if it's the coloring or something, but they're becoming discolored, like pink.

1285
01:28:51,665 --> 01:28:52,325
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of funny.

1286
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:54,306
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're less manly.

1287
01:28:55,446 --> 01:28:58,227
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I don't know if anyone saw this.

1288
01:28:58,727 --> 01:29:04,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, there's a company called Pega, and they're releasing yet another gun peripheral for the Wii.

1289
01:29:04,981 --> 01:29:07,962
[SPEAKER_05]: This one, though, is shaped like a shark.

1290
01:29:08,862 --> 01:29:10,343
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called the Shark Gun.

1291
01:29:11,163 --> 01:29:16,685
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, they were actually... They had a whole press release for this thing.

1292
01:29:16,765 --> 01:29:17,545
[SPEAKER_05]: It was hilarious.

1293
01:29:18,185 --> 01:29:31,249
[SPEAKER_05]: They had something... During the gunfighting game, use the Wii Remote, Nunchuck, and Shark Gun together, holding the handle of the Shark Gun and poking the trigger with your forefinger to shoot.

1294
01:29:32,010 --> 01:29:32,650
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll bring you...

1295
01:29:34,627 --> 01:29:37,412
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll bring you a You Are There feeling.

1296
01:29:38,774 --> 01:29:43,441
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's funny, though, because they have military guys on the cover shooting guns and stuff.

1297
01:29:44,042 --> 01:29:45,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Although they're not the shark gun.

1298
01:29:45,705 --> 01:29:47,428
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'd be funny if the military had shark guns.

1299
01:29:50,225 --> 01:29:51,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's enough news.

1300
01:29:51,245 --> 01:29:52,106
[SPEAKER_04]: It can wait until next week.

1301
01:29:52,166 --> 01:29:56,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week on Orange Lounge Radio, we're back to our classic format.

1302
01:29:56,608 --> 01:29:59,209
[SPEAKER_04]: All three of us will be discussing the latest and greatest in gaming news.

1303
01:29:59,269 --> 01:30:01,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, your calls on Skype, as always.

1304
01:30:01,950 --> 01:30:03,791
[SPEAKER_04]: And who knows who might put us on hold next week.

1305
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:04,451
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1306
01:30:04,611 --> 01:30:05,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait.

1307
01:30:05,091 --> 01:30:06,031
[SPEAKER_05]: I got one more thing on the shark gun.

1308
01:30:06,051 --> 01:30:06,472
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it.

1309
01:30:06,492 --> 01:30:07,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, this is funny.

1310
01:30:07,712 --> 01:30:08,713
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the features on there.

1311
01:30:08,993 --> 01:30:16,916
[SPEAKER_05]: With lively appearance and smooth lines, Shark Gun makes you feel comfortable and gives you a strong sense of shark-like invincible force.

1312
01:30:18,769 --> 01:30:19,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Dustcap4

1313
01:30:48,554 --> 01:30:49,355
[SPEAKER_07]: I have one more, actually.

1314
01:30:49,415 --> 01:30:49,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

1315
01:30:50,156 --> 01:30:51,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Reject false icons.

1316
01:30:51,817 --> 01:30:54,760
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a while since we've had a good hearty reject false icons.

1317
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:55,160
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good.

1318
01:30:55,941 --> 01:31:04,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, for myself, DarkSakura, and Loki, everybody please have a happy and very safe New Year's Eve and New Year's Day.

1319
01:31:04,409 --> 01:31:06,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't drink and drive, because if you do, you're retarded.

1320
01:31:07,812 --> 01:31:09,413
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really it.

1321
01:31:10,134 --> 01:31:11,115
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you guys in 2008 for our

1322
01:31:12,791 --> 01:31:15,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Sixth year of broadcasting, if you can believe it.

1323
01:31:15,132 --> 01:31:17,893
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
