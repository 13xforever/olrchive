00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Here on this New Year's Eve Eve, we are taping December 30, 2007.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We're doing our year-end special, and in the first half of tonight's program, part A, we recapped with some of our listeners.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We had Raven's Dolphin, we had Dark Knight, we had Xenocore.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
They all called in to talk about January, February, March, April, May, and June.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We recapped those months.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We're going to be getting into the rest of the year very soon.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But first, let's open up the old mailbag.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Dark Soccer is going to be opening up the old mailbag and pulling out some of her favorite emails.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Do I gotta?

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah, you gotta.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Because even though usually during a special show we wouldn't do it since we weren't here last week,

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the email's building up and we gotta clean some of them out.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I had to pick up a few.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yeah, and unfortunately, I mean, I think there was just so many emails these past two weeks that you're just not going to be able to read them all.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So, Jamie's having to be choosy this week.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Sorry, folks.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So, let's open up the old mailbag.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Mailbag at www.orangeloungeradio.com, though, if you want to send it.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Even if we don't always respond to them on air, we read them all.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I go in there and I read them all every day.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
There was one that had a lot of gratuitous uses of the word fuck, so I'm not reading it.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I see.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So, I'm only reading a few of these, okay?

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
First one is, hey guys, greetings and salutations from Dr. Noir from Mexico City.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'll skip the praise because I obviously like your show a lot else I wouldn't be writing this.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I want to share with you an image that I'm sure will bring tears to many.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Some in anger, some in grief at seeing this many Wii units waiting for a lonely four home for this Christmas.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's like watching a buffet and knowing people are famished elsewhere.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Anyway, keep it up and please reply with a postal address to send you your holiday gifts.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That'd be Rob.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Don't move that email out. Save it in there and I'll reply with the address.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Also, there's a PS.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh, okay.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The plural form of luchador is not luchadores, but luchadores.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
With the last syllable pronounced S as in fez, the hat.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
All right.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I did want to say speaking of gifts sent to us, one of our listeners, you'll love her,

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Misty sent a little care package.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You can see up on the wall there's a Hello Kitty popsicle there.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
This little penguin eye dog thing, which I thought was too cute, and lots of rice candy, which is my favorite.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I ate it.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
She sent us some candy, but you eat it.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But I eat it.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Well, speaking of Misty, I'll go ahead and read her. She actually did ask about me talking about the Happy Suicide song.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And it's Thanatos from End of Evangelion is the one I was referring to.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The song that's just so freaking depressing.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh, I thought it was the whole end scene where they're dying. It was hilarious.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, yeah.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But to read Misty's big email.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So I was listening to my old OLR episodes and got stuck for some reason on episode 242.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And that umbrella song that I ended up ripping from 249, but let's not go there right now, LOL.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Excuse me.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I guess what inspired me to write in again, well, this time anyway, was the short text message email that you read in this episode.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Plus, I do have a question.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I know I shouldn't necessarily be thinking this far ahead, but they said ASIN is my other addiction, aside from the station.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I know enough not to ask if there will be a panel, though that would be fucking rad.

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So instead, I'll ask this. Currently, does anyone's schedule work out for ASIN?

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's May 16th through 18th this year, but I am to head up to Rosemont on the 15th.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Also, should I expect to see Chris there?

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I didn't catch her last year. Feel free to insert lame Pokeman's jokes here.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But I really want to see her in Megsy.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay, I'll leave you alone for now. Sorry if there's a typo I missed, but my typing on the LG Envy still sucks a bit anyway. Heart misty.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I would think very much that Chris is going to be there, seeing as how she's relocating, because I get to go with her on the trip.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:27,000
ASIN probably is not in my future, although a little bit more of my time in that year has been freed up.

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So, I don't know. I would love to go, but...

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm not saying no yet. Not likely right now, just due to the fact that I'm not going to have a lot of free time off work available, because I'm going to Mendocino in April.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But never say never, because I have found that flights from here to Chicago, there's actually a lot of direct flights from SAC to Chicago, so you never know.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And that's where ASIN's at, Chicago, right?

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I do believe so.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So, maybe. And that's more favorable maybe than you might think, because, you know, why not? It might be fun.

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Especially, I'll tell you what, that maybe is a hell of a lot more likely to become a yes, if we can somehow get in on getting a panel there or something.

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Well, I've got other stuff planned in May, and I have to double check my schedule.

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But I've wanted to go to ASIN now for a couple years, and I want to cosplay.

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I need a new costume.

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Probably all three of us won't make it, but at least maybe if one of the three of us can get out there. I don't know, Loki, trip to Chicago in your future?

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Nope.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The wife won't let you go, will she?

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yep, I'm chained to the house, I'm like on house arrest.

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Well, while I'm still single, I should probably travel, because the same thing is probably going to happen to me.

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You should have read the fine print about her being afraid of the dark end of being alone.

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But you love her, right?

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Sure.

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Alright.

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
She's been giving me crap today about my new computer.

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Aw, sorry to hear it. You should never come between a man and his computer.

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Well, see, now at my house it's the other way around, because I'm on my computer all the time, and Dan's playing video games.

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,000
See, that'd be awesome though, but you know, my wife doesn't play video games, and when she does, I can't leave the room, because I don't know why.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You need to petition PopCap to make a Bejeweled 3 fast to keep her busy.

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's only for a matter of minutes, and then she'll get bored with it.

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
We never did realize just how prophetic that t-shirt would be.

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's true, huh? Game over.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Alright, let's get to some more emails.

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay.

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Hey, O.L.R., I just wanted to get in my crappy story about the lack of Wii's in the world.

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I live in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, and at a specific department store whose name I will not mention, there is what you call a midnight madness sale where people will stay up to midnight trying to get the 15 minute only sales.

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Well, in this particular store, the big grand prize draw was a chance to buy a Wii.

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Not that one gets free or 50% off, but just to have a chance to purchase one.

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I also heard about a guy in Australia purchasing one for $590.

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Nintendo make more Wii's.

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Keep the good work, O.L.R. PKJR 92.

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The only way to make your PC go faster is to throw it out a window.

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And I think what also probably unfortunately sucks for this person who is emailing us, thank you for the email by the way, is the fact that they do live in a pretty remote area of Canada.

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And A, you're in Canada, which is kind of, even though a very important, very large country, is still outside of that trinity of Japan, United States, and the big Europe regions like Germany, France, and Britain basically.

108
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Basically the big ones in Spain.

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm not trying to leave anybody out, but I'm saying the ones where gaming is more prevalent there in Europe.

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Canada kind of comes after that sometimes with some things like Rock Band we've seen.

111
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So unfortunately sometimes they get the short end of the stick with the Wii shipments as well.

112
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And Nintendo can only make so many of those.

113
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:12,000
My advice would be though, I don't remember if he said he was trying to get one or whatever, but online, because you know, you go to a place like Amazon, they're not going to care if you're in Canada or what have you.

114
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
A lot of that's the same for U.S. and Canada.

115
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Unless you're buying toys from Amazon U.K.

116
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But that is weird though about the whole raffle to get the opportunity to buy a Wii.

117
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That is weird.

118
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You know I have to order my U.K. toys from Amazon Canada.

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Interesting.

120
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yes.

121
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Just thought I'd share that with you.

122
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:43,000
ActDeft wanted to respond to something he heard in Dr. Noir's email, and that is that there are a lot of Wiis unsold in Mexico, but that's because it costs almost double than it costs in the U.S. because of import fees.

123
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Everyone import them from Mexico.

124
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
There you go. If you want to pay more for it, you can get a Wii from Mexico.

125
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's how you could get it in remote Canada.

126
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Ah, the bliss of disposable income, huh?

127
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I guess.

128
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So, moving on with email.

129
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You guys talked about giving Zelda a hand job, but since she's the princess, call it what it is and Zelda gets fingered.

130
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This is from Mark F.

131
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I stand corrected. Thank you.

132
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Sky talked about simple baseball games just to chime in.

133
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Bases Loaded was way better than Baseball Stars.

134
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Lies.

135
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And the best slash easiest baseball game was simply Baseball for the NES.

136
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Fun times.

137
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Moving forward for Robert M.

138
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
People with your initial names.

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Hello and hope you had a nice break.

140
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Hopefully you've ironed out most of the bugs in your new studio.

141
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I keep getting the podcast feed about a day late.

142
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Really like the weird Al for the stupid awards.

143
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And just a quick thought on the last show, you mentioned Facebook as a verb instead of using it in the sense of friending.

144
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
My friend went into, went more the head desk direction.

145
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That is face booking.

146
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Someone would literally entail hitting them in the face with a book.

147
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Refreshing a witty comment relating online community sites and physical pain goes here.

148
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You mean like every time I go to MySpace, I feel like I'm going to have an aneurysm.

149
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yep.

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Actually your face meets a book.

151
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's face booking.

152
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I like that.

153
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I was wondering what your opinion would be on the massively multiplayer online sports game such as an NFL game where all 22 players could be controlled by online gamers.

154
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Hard to coordinate?

155
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Probably.

156
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'd like to see something like that.

157
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'd like to see how something like that would work.

158
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Brilliant idea honestly.

159
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't know why it's not out there.

160
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
People don't know how to work together.

161
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Maybe, yeah.

162
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's partially that and partially probably that, you know, some people, you know, in a football team, you have your standout stars and then you have the other guys.

163
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And who wants to be the other guys?

164
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
When you play a video game, you're trying to be something you're not.

165
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I've been on the bench.

166
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Well, that's why it would be like what was that game that my husband was playing, NFL Pro or something, where your team is all fantasy, you know.

167
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's some of the greatest players that you've had in sports history.

168
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Or maybe just that, you know, maybe you pick from a pool of players.

169
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Like your team is actually a really big team that you form with friends and then like so many of you play in matches.

170
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I don't know.

171
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That would be really hard to coordinate though.

172
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
People don't know how to work together.

173
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I like the idea.

174
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I like the concept.

175
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The execution would be a little tricky of that, but I like your concept.

176
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't think it can work with like a party of more than seven.

177
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's why, you know, it works in RPGs but not in sports.

178
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I think they should do it in hockey so that like even if you aren't really controlling the puck, at least you can go beat somebody up.

179
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You know a game I would like to see.

180
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What?

181
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Cube.

182
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
How about Blades of Steel 2, which by the way, original Blades of Steel came out on Virtual Console in the US last week.

183
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Bless you.

184
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Our Sakura's having a sneeze fit, so I will praise Blades of Steel a little more on the great, great hockey game it was on the NES.

185
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Good times.

186
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
By the way, I used the Wii gifting feature this week.

187
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Oh, you did?

188
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yes, I used the Wii gifting feature to send my friend in New York a copy of Kid Icarus.

189
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And I tried to send her Mario 3, but the Wii rejected it.

190
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So the Wii is smart enough to not let you send games your friends already have.

191
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Did you see, and I forgot to mention this on our show roll, that Microsoft did the gifting feature now in the US with points.

192
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You can give other accounts points now.

193
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Where did they do that?

194
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I don't know, but I read it somewhere.

195
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I read it on one of the, like, JoySick or Kotaku.

196
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Is that why Xbox has been broken the past few days?

197
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't know.

198
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But that's great for me because, you know, having multiple consoles and say if I want to, you know, install, like, a map or something and buy it for each one, I don't have to buy points cards for every single console.

199
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Interesting.

200
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
By the way, our entire chat room could hear your power sneezes and say, bless you.

201
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Well, you know what, my nose feels like a nightmare of pain and suffering.

202
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Sorry to hear it.

203
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So thank you, chat room.

204
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm glad you heard me blow my nose, too.

205
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
All right.

206
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Well, any more emails?

207
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I sound like a foghorn.

208
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So there are emails.

209
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Hey, OLR crew, I found myself unable to sleep one night at 3 in the morning and popped on your radio feed on iTunes.

210
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And I was able to fall asleep.

211
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And I noticed it was playing much more melon music than normal.

212
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Is the rotation geared more towards slow calming songs at night?

213
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Or did I just happen upon a random anomaly?

214
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Either way, it helps me get to sleep, so thank you, guys.

215
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Keep up the awesome show, AZHP.

216
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Welcome, and you can thank the total randomness, because our playlist is the same all day long.

217
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
We don't do anything special at night, although maybe we should.

218
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I am going to be changing the playlist up because I have a break from work here for another week.

219
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So I'm going to be working on a lot of OLR stuff.

220
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And one thing I'm going to be doing is cleaning out the 24-7 show and putting in some more classic game tunes and, yeah, just cycling some stuff in and out.

221
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So check it out.

222
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
All right.

223
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Two emails left.

224
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Thank God.

225
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
All right.

226
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
We got a bunch.

227
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
This is a sample.

228
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So I updated my PSP the other day and was very pleased with the internet radio edition.

229
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Given the fact that I listened to your show on my PSP, it would be even better if I could listen to it live on there as well.

230
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It would be a nice Christmas present, please?

231
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
We don't know how to make that happen just yet, but we have to get on that.

232
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Loki, you got to figure that out.

233
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Don't look at me.

234
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I don't know how to do it.

235
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You have to basically run a relay through Shoutcast.

236
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Oh, it has to be Shoutcast, huh?

237
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yeah.

238
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
We'll see.

239
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I want to say somebody sent me an email about some Shoutcast stuff, so I will look into that as the week goes on.

240
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I would assume, well, maybe you could probably broadcast on Shoutcast and Live 365 at the same time.

241
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Or we could just leave Live 365 and do Shoutcast with as many people as we want on the feed, but we'll see.

242
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
We'll see.

243
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Anything is a possibility, but I can say I do know you can listen to all games on your PSP.

244
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
They did figure out how to set it up, so if nothing else, you can always listen to our syndicated runs that air on allgames.com on Monday nights and Tuesday mornings.

245
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Well, there's more to that email.

246
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Okay.

247
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Also, I'd like to note that when I listen to you guys, you always find a way to make me laugh no matter what kind of mood I'm in.

248
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So thank you, and I wish you all a very Merry Christmas and many more Happy New Years to come.

249
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Happy Holidays.

250
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Smile face, Oscar.

251
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Thank you.

252
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I want to say Tiger Claw says, I can listen to OLR on my PSP using PSP radio.

253
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So I guess it is possible.

254
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Last email.

255
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Ow.

256
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Maybe share that with everybody.

257
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Tiger Claw, send Loki an email.

258
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Would you like to share with the rest of the class?

259
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Send Loki an email.

260
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Don't send me an email.

261
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Just post it in the chat.

262
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I don't want to get into it right now.

263
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Fine.

264
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Then post it in the chat.

265
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Email.

266
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
All right.

267
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Email.

268
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Hey Sky, Loki, and Dark Sakura.

269
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Hi.

270
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm going to start this out with a true fact.

271
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
OLR is the best, funniest, and most informative, engaging show in the world.

272
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You guys and girl have done a great job, and for that you should be commended.

273
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Good.

274
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Somebody commend us, please.

275
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
One question, though.

276
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I just got a PlayStation 3 for Christmas, and the only game I have for it right now is Motorstorm.

277
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What would be the top three games you would recommend for me to get?

278
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

279
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Sell your PS3.

280
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
No.

281
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It was a gift.

282
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
All right.

283
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

284
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Resistance, Fall of Man.

285
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Oblivion.

286
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Oblivion.

287
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Absolutely Oblivion.

288
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Those are actually the three I'd name right there.

289
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Oblivion.

290
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Resistance.

291
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Marvel, if you're into that.

292
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I mean, obviously Jamie's into that.

293
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's a fun game.

294
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm trying to think if there's something else that maybe was something.

295
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It has a lot of options.

296
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Heavenly Sword.

297
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yeah.

298
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's probably fun.

299
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
If you have two hours.

300
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's just J100 Matt's recommending Warhawk.

301
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
There you go.

302
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Resistance, I would say probably Uncharted, Drake's Fortune, and depending on how you

303
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
feel about Ratchet and Clank, Ratchet and Clank.

304
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Otherwise, I don't know.

305
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Motorstorm's pretty good.

306
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But if you bought your PS3, you probably already have Motorstorm.

307
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
That's what he said.

308
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
All he has now is Motorstorm.

309
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Well, then.

310
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Oblivion.

311
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Nah.

312
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I wouldn't do Oblivion.

313
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Fine.

314
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's old.

315
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I mean, they're going to come out with something new here and buy it, and then all of a sudden,

316
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
oh crap.

317
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Well, actually, I guess it is cheap.

318
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
If you don't buy the expansion, it's like a $30 game.

319
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So, sure.

320
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Oblivion.

321
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And buy a bunch of Blu-Ray movies.

322
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
A lot of the PS3 games are really cheap now, and you'll find a lot of them used.

323
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Seth is saying Unreal Tournament in our chat room.

324
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That's probably not a bad pick.

325
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,500
Now, see, Unreal Tournament and Warhawk, depending on how you feel about online-only multiplayer

326
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
games.

327
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,880
That's, you know, in Unreal Tournament 3, if you don't like Unreal, you know, really,

328
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,000
really fast, you know, kind of trigger-happy games, then you might not like that.

329
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,120
All right.

330
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,120
Is that it for emails?

331
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,120
No?

332
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,120
Oh, my God.

333
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,120
No, there was more to that one.

334
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,120
All right.

335
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,120
Because people keep interrupting me.

336
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,120
Oh, sorry.

337
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,120
Sir.

338
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,160
Also, I think Loki shouldn't get the bad rap he does from blasting Sony, because Sony really

339
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,000
does leave us gamers out to dry in terms of innovation, besides the PS3, and new hardware

340
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,320
such as new peripherals for the PSP.

341
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,440
So until they get wise, keep going strong.

342
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,880
Canada salutes you.

343
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,400
Sincerely, Josh G.

344
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,440
Well, thank you, Canada.

345
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
I salute Canada.

346
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,760
I love Canada.

347
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,760
And I like this.

348
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,000
What's the difference between Windows 95 and Windows 98?

349
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,100
Answer, three years.

350
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,240
That joke is like 10 years old.

351
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,640
I know, but I think it's great that somebody put that in their email.

352
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,640
All right.

353
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,640
So now we're done with emails, yes?

354
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,640
We are done.

355
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,600
And I'm saving and leaving out that one for you.

356
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
All right.

357
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Thank you very much.

358
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
All right.

359
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,360
Let's get back into some news, and then we're going to get back into the Skype line and

360
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,520
go over July and the rest of the year.

361
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,640
Release dates, or lack thereof.

362
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,200
I thought I would at least open it up if anybody has any release dates.

363
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
How about the US, Loki?

364
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,200
There is not much.

365
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,800
And from what I gather, these four games are apparently a GameStop exclusive.

366
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,600
Good for them, I guess, scoring these awesome games, all of which are from a wonderful company,

367
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:20,920
a company named Conspiracy Entertainment, who is known for their extremely high quality

368
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,920
games.

369
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,880
Okay, no, not really, but you can get four racing games this week.

370
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:38,240
Rig Racer 2, which has you racing big rigs, Kawasaki Quad Bikes, Monster Trucks Off-Road,

371
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,920
and then Classic British Motor Racing.

372
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,920
Let me just save you time.

373
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,760
What exactly is Classic British Motor Racing?

374
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,000
Like an Aston Martin or...

375
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,640
No, it's like racing minis.

376
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,080
None of these games are that great.

377
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,600
Although, they do have a game coming out, though, that's going to be a jet ski racing

378
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,480
game, and it looks just like Waverly 64.

379
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,940
So that has potential, but I would, if you can rent these, go for it.

380
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,940
They're cheap.

381
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,680
I think they're like $19.99, so if you have money that you want to throw away, I can tell

382
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:19,760
you one thing, don't buy Monster Trucks Off-Road, because Monster Trucks, they had Off-Road

383
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,540
Arena or something like that, that really sucked, and then there is Off-Road Extreme

384
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:29,600
Special Edition, which got like a one on IGN.

385
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,540
It's like a piece of shit.

386
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:36,840
Most of these are crap, but just kind of know it going into it.

387
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,080
That's all you can find this week.

388
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,120
Next week, I promise you better games.

389
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,520
How about the UK, Jamie?

390
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,760
I'll give some highlights for what's coming out next week, just the things that interest

391
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,760
me specifically.

392
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,960
Why not?

393
00:20:48,960 --> 00:21:00,440
There is Dancing Stage Universe, Myst on DS, SingStar on PS3, Sonic Rivals 2, I like, there's

394
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:10,880
one called Teleaddicts, which I think is great, and another Yu-Gi-Oh game, but I'll go over

395
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,760
the big massive list later.

396
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,960
How about the Virtual Console?

397
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:22,160
There is stuff for Virtual Console, this is the stuff actually that has been out now.

398
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:30,400
Three games that are to be out is Blades of Steel, which we've gone over, Skate or Die,

399
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
and Monster Lair.

400
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
So there you go.

401
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,600
We haven't gotten Skate or Die in the US, huh?

402
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
No.

403
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
I'll bet you that'll be Monday's game.

404
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,880
I'll bet you Monday will be Skate or Die.

405
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,440
Usually when it comes out in Europe we get it the next week, I noticed, and we did get

406
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,640
Blades of Steel here last week.

407
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,360
It's so weird the way they've been releasing those games, like you would think there'd

408
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:52,200
be some pattern to it, but it really just seems like it's just kind of a crap shoot.

409
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,160
This is the part where I would go over Japanese releases, but there is nothing, not a damn

410
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,460
thing I feel like mentioning, so that's it, no Japanese releases.

411
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:05,380
So that being said, we are going to open up the Skype line, 1877 Game OLR, username on

412
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,440
Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, and we're going to go over with you guys, our listeners, the

413
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,960
last few months of the year, and we also want to get your picks for the best game of 2007

414
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,220
and the worst game of 2007.

415
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,120
So go ahead and give us a call, and remember, if you've never used Skype before, you might

416
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:28,240
want to give Echo123 a call to make sure you sound okay.

417
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,720
Unless you're calling over the phone, then there's really nothing you can do to test.

418
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,800
Because there is a little bit of a delay between the live and when the people hear it, they

419
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,160
probably don't know it's open yet, so we're just trying to fill in a little bit of time

420
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,680
here.

421
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,060
Later on in the program, we're going to be going over our top five lists of the five

422
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:50,960
most fun games we played this year, and then we'll tally it up what overall was the best

423
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,680
and the worst game of 2007, and we'll give some predictions for 2008.

424
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,080
And we haven't forgotten the FUs either.

425
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:07,200
And of course, a lot of our regular callers are gone this week on vacation, away from

426
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,520
the holidays, so I think that's where, you know, if you're wondering, like, why isn't

427
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,520
our phone ringing off the hook?

428
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,520
I think that's why.

429
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,520
Who leaves for, like, New Year's?

430
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
I understand Christmas, but, I mean, I don't know.

431
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,400
I think people are still gone from Christmas, is what happens.

432
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,160
Oh, well.

433
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,200
So what's going to happen if nobody calls?

434
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
I'll do July.

435
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
Yeah, we'll just have to do it again.

436
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,200
Someone call us!

437
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
We can do it.

438
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
We don't always play with the chat room.

439
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,200
People are just being shy.

440
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,200
We have plenty of people in chat.

441
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,600
There's over, almost 50 people in chat, so I don't know what the heck's going on there.

442
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,000
Pick up your damn phone.

443
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,200
Don't you people have phones?

444
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
And call us.

445
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,400
Some folks are waiting for certain months.

446
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,080
No, you don't wait.

447
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,080
You do some R-terms.

448
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,520
Pick up the goddamn phone and your goddamn phone call.

449
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
We're getting a call.

450
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,760
I hear on Orange Line's radio, who's this?

451
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,280
Oh, this is the escapist.

452
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,120
Escapist is here.

453
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,120
I'm sorry, who's this?

454
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,120
Escapist.

455
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,480
Well, Escapist, how are you, sir?

456
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,480
How you doing?

457
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,960
I'm doing wonderful, yourself?

458
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,960
Very good.

459
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,080
There's a little bit of a delay, but I notice you're calling us from Canada, so that's probably

460
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,080
why there's a bit of a delay.

461
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,080
Okay.

462
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,220
All right, so I'm going to go through this rather quickly here, and we want to hear your

463
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,680
thoughts on some of the highlights of 2007.

464
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,240
So let's talk first a little bit about July.

465
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:37,120
July, episode 237 was when a brain game in the UK was pulled over the use of the word

466
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,380
spastic, and I apologize if I offended anyone by saying that word just then, but we kind

467
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,860
of hear in the US go, well, that's not a big deal, but in the UK, because it slipped through

468
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:52,000
the cracks because of those cultural differences, the word spastic got a brain game pulled over

469
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,480
in the UK.

470
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,040
Episode number 238 was when the PlayStation 3 got a price cut, so the PlayStation 3 was

471
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,080
announced that it was going to be getting a price cut, and a lot of folks said it needed

472
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,040
that about six months earlier.

473
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,440
Episode 239 was the week that mini E3 happened.

474
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,680
That was when Mario Kart Wii was announced for the Wii, and Cena was announced for the

475
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,540
360, and the PSP was announced that had a redesign, and just in general kind of the

476
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,360
changed E3.

477
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,520
Do you think low-key the E3 is going to be very similar to how it was this year or next

478
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,740
year, or do you think they're going to get kind of, especially since they're moving back

479
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,240
to the LA Convention Center, do you think they're going to get a little bit of maybe

480
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
what they missed?

481
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,280
I think it's going to be about the same.

482
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:41,080
Speaking of which, you need to talk to whoever was supposed to invite us last year, and get

483
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:46,680
them to invite, or this year I should say, and be ready for this next year, because I

484
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,680
want to go.

485
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,680
I do too, we'll see.

486
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:58,520
Yeah, all I remember from mini E3 is how disappointed I was with the Mario Kart and Zapper announcements.

487
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,680
Not necessarily Mario Kart, because Mario Kart's really fucking awesome, but the fact

488
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,600
that it comes with a plastic steering wheel, all these peripherals, they were like, God,

489
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,360
this is a stupid idea, who keeps releasing this crap, and Nintendo's like, hey, we're

490
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,160
going to do it too, that makes it a good idea, right, and then the Zapper we saw was like

491
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:21,640
a pretty cool attachment, kind of like the nunchuck, and then all of a sudden that's

492
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:27,120
this piece of plastic crap, I don't know, it wasn't all that exciting.

493
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,440
Escapist, did you follow mini E3 news?

494
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,960
What did you think of this year's E3, new and improved?

495
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,200
I kind of really ignored it this year, I don't know, I've never been a big fan of E3 to begin

496
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,200
with.

497
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,240
It was like a whole bunch of excitement for a couple months, and whatever.

498
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,520
What makes you not a fan of E3?

499
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:54,560
Just too much information at one time, I get kind of overloaded and overexcited a bit.

500
00:26:54,560 --> 00:27:00,360
I can kind of see that, it does seem like the year is entirely dead, and then E3 happens,

501
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:08,000
and then it's dead again, you know what I mean?

502
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,800
Episode 240 was in July, it was the last episode we taped in July, and that was the week that

503
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:18,520
South Park, the World of Warcraft episode got nominated for an Emmy, which kind of made

504
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,120
a lot of us go, wow.

505
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,120
And it did win.

506
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,360
And it did end up winning the Emmy, actually, but of course the South Park wow episode integrated

507
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,920
the World of Warcraft very well with the South Park kids, but of course the one thing I remember

508
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,640
was bathroom, bathroom!

509
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:41,920
Alright, Escapist, out of those stories, the brain game, the price cut, mini E3 and South

510
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:49,280
Park World of Warcraft, what do you think had the biggest impact for 2007's gaming?

511
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:54,160
Well even though I just undermined it earlier, I'd definitely say the E3 there, just because

512
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,760
the whole new year for E3, a new direction they wanted to go, it's still the same kind

513
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,240
of information that got released from what I saw, but a lot less people go into it.

514
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,360
I think you're right, I think even though it is different, I think it definitely was

515
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,560
the highlight of the month and the year in some ways.

516
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:14,140
I think the way that they did E3, I mean besides the multiple hotels and it being kind of difficult

517
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:18,860
to travel from one place to another, I like the format where it's just like those gamers

518
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:23,720
days where you sit down, you get a presentation, here's all the games that we have, here's

519
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,520
all the information we're going to give you, then you move along to the next group or the

520
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:34,200
next company and you kind of digest all that stuff as well, you get your press kits, and

521
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,320
then you go play the games at the end, just like a gamers day, and that I think works

522
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,600
a lot better for me than having to just navigate all around because I end up missing stuff.

523
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:52,000
I agree, and I said this before on the show, the two years ago, the last big E3, I knew

524
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,800
something was wrong when Paris Hilton was there and drawing these big crowds because

525
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,720
she had some fucking crappy cell phone game coming out, right?

526
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,020
She got the name wrong on.

527
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,440
You knew that something was broken with E3 at that point?

528
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,440
Yeah.

529
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,440
Interesting.

530
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,520
All right, well let's move on to August, scapists, we're going to go over the four

531
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,200
stories and then you tell us which one you think had the most impact.

532
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,680
Episode 241 kicked off August and it was another WoW story because that was the week that Blizzcon

533
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:23,000
happened and Wrath of the Lich King was announced and of course obviously we even had some folks,

534
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,680
I remember Extifer, one of our regular guests, actually went to Blizzcon and came back with

535
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,960
a full report and of course a lot of WoW players were very excited about the Wrath of the Lich

536
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,760
King expansion.

537
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:39,480
Episode 242 was the week that the news was breaking that the Xbox 360 core system was

538
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,200
being phased out of stores.

539
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,520
And the price dropped, too.

540
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,920
Yeah, when Best Buy started to phase them out of their computers and Target was phasing

541
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,760
them out of their computers, the systems were slowly disappearing which kind of made people

542
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,680
go, hmm, what's going on there?

543
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:58,600
And then of course subsequently we learned about the Elite and all that stuff and the

544
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:04,280
Elite have been out, the arcade and the other stuff.

545
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,320
Episode 243, Toys R Us breaks the Bioshock street date.

546
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,560
Bioshock came out towards the end of August and Toys R Us broke the street date and people

547
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,320
were taking pictures of receipts and that stuff was all over the internet.

548
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,560
And then episode 244 in August was the week we talked about a brand new game Konami was

549
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:25,560
putting out called New International Track and Field and what made this story stand out,

550
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:30,160
the fact that there was going to be a cartoon version of Serial Killer Pyramid Head in the

551
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,520
game, a little chibi pyramid head game.

552
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,400
Now, the game is not out yet, but we were just talking about the announcement, although

553
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,240
I should say that if you saw the Christmas cards that some of the big game companies

554
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,120
put out, Konami actually had a little picture of chibi pyramid head in theirs and he was

555
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,640
opening up a box with new gloves in it.

556
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,760
It was so cute.

557
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,880
You just reminded me of something.

558
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,360
What's that?

559
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,480
My husband's boss gave him one of the Portal Christmas cards.

560
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,880
From Aperture Science?

561
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,040
I stole it.

562
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,320
Very good.

563
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,040
You got a card, but I stole it.

564
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:07,920
Anyhow, Escapist, out of those stories, Blizzcon, Xbox 360 core phased out, Toys R Us breaking

565
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,280
a street date, and New International Track and Field, or anything you can think of, what

566
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,280
do you think had the most impact?

567
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,400
I know that's a little bit of a tougher month because it was after E3, but what do you think

568
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,400
had the most impact?

569
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Jeepers.

570
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:27,120
For me, I definitely have to say the Toys R Us thing was kind of a big deal there.

571
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,640
It's another insight into the distribution chain there that people are really excited

572
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,080
to get their games now and stuff like that.

573
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,320
Toys R Us isn't really paying attention.

574
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,320
I don't know.

575
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,600
I'm excited to be on air, that's all.

576
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,600
No, it's all good.

577
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,720
It's a very good point that you're saying there is that a big chain like Toys R Us you

578
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,760
would think would know better, but sometimes down on the lower levels, folks kind of make

579
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,160
their mistakes and all that stuff, and these things kind of slip through the cracks.

580
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,920
But it is very interesting when these types of things have happened, because there's been

581
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,920
a lot of similar stories throughout the year.

582
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:07,420
Kmart broke the Mass Effect street date, Target broke the word about the Xbox 360 arcade units

583
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,360
before even Microsoft had put them out, right?

584
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,360
Like, weren't they selling them?

585
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,800
Circuit City broke the PlayStation 3 prices throughout the day.

586
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,480
This kind of shit was happening all year long.

587
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:21,240
It's amazing to watch the internet's reaction to it all, but like the scans, the YouTubes,

588
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,720
the pictures of receipts in the game going, I have the biggest E-peen in the planet because

589
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,480
I have this game and you don't.

590
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,340
Like all that type of stuff is just fascinating to watch, and it was definitely a trend throughout

591
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,340
2007.

592
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,080
How many people were actually playing Halo 3 before that came out?

593
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,080
I did.

594
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,080
Excellent point.

595
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,460
I had already beaten it before it came out.

596
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,920
There you go, and that was another huge one, Halo 3, absolutely, and that was in August

597
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,920
as well, right?

598
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,920
October.

599
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,920
September.

600
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,920
Almost.

601
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,920
End of September.

602
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,920
When we get into the next month.

603
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,920
All right.

604
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,840
Well, Escapist, before we let you go, we have a few more things to ask you, and that would

605
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:58,440
be what, in your opinion, was the worst freaking game of 2007 that should be avoided at all

606
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,440
costs?

607
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,880
Well, normally I would go with the obvious pick like yours, except I actually didn't

608
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,600
play it, so that would kind of be a bit of a cop-out on my part.

609
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,680
Well, that's fair enough, but then we have to change it up.

610
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,680
What do you think, then?

611
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:17,720
I'm going to have to be annoying and say I didn't really like Call of Duty all that much.

612
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,240
Call of Duty 4 never really did anything for me.

613
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,040
Maybe you might see I'm not a true shooter fan or whatnot.

614
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,960
Maybe it's because I had a horrible time online playing it, but I don't know.

615
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,560
That's one of the games in my collection I'm probably going to get rid of first.

616
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,560
Oh, snap.

617
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,680
Call of Duty 4, worst game of the year.

618
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,680
Hey, you know what?

619
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,680
It happens.

620
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,480
I seem to remember last year, we had some of the guests from other podcasts, and I want

621
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,840
to say someone said that some really big game was their least favorite game of the year,

622
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,320
and it was definitely controversial, but it was really funny when it happened.

623
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,440
But Hannah Montana was the best, I think.

624
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,440
Gears of War.

625
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,440
No, that was different.

626
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,440
Yes, it was Gears of War.

627
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,440
I think somebody said Gears of War was the worst game that came out.

628
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,840
I think it was Michelle from Video Game Outsiders.

629
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,840
I think.

630
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,840
I don't remember.

631
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,840
I'd have to go back and listen, but anyway.

632
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,840
All right.

633
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,840
Never mind.

634
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,840
That was last year.

635
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,840
That was so 2006.

636
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,840
Let's talk about 2007.

637
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,400
Best game of 2007, Escapist, in your opinion?

638
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:16,880
Last time, I tried to avoid the obvious pick, but I have to go the obvious with this one.

639
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,880
It would have to be the Orange Box.

640
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,640
It's probably the best gaming value I've ever seen in my freaking life.

641
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,640
The Orange Box.

642
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,960
Five classic games all crammed in one bundle, and you can't ignore the Portal.

643
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,800
I can't say I disagree with you, sir.

644
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,940
The Orange Box is a great deal, and that right there makes it definitely a worthy candidate

645
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,940
for game of the year.

646
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,800
And then you have Portal in there as well, which of course is a brilliant game in itself.

647
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,480
Escapist, thanks so much for being on the show tonight, even though we had a little

648
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:47,080
bit of a delay with the cross boundaries there and everything between the U.S. and Canada,

649
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,360
but we really appreciate you being on the program, and thanks for listening in 2007.

650
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,360
Hope you have a great...

651
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,360
Thank you very much for having me.

652
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,360
Not a problem.

653
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
Hope you have a great 2008.

654
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,360
Hope I wasn't much more talkative yesterday.

655
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,360
Thanks, bud.

656
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,360
All right.

657
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,360
Take care, buddy.

658
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,360
All right.

659
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,360
You too.

660
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,360
All right.

661
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,360
Bye-bye.

662
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,920
Unfortunately, because of the distance there, he was breaking up a little bit.

663
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,760
All right.

664
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,760
Let's see.

665
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,760
We're going to move on to September.

666
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,000
We're going to get a call here and talk about September and October.

667
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,440
So the Skype line is open at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

668
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,440
September and October.

669
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,860
And remember, if you don't get through for this one, there is still November and December.

670
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,400
We still have that to go over.

671
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,400
So let's see who's on the line.

672
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,400
Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.

673
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
Who's this?

674
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,400
Kia68.

675
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,600
Hey, you were the one that was waiting for September, weren't you?

676
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,600
Yeah.

677
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
Oh, wow.

678
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,160
You got knocked out, didn't you?

679
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
Yeah.

680
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,160
Because somebody else might have beat you to it.

681
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,160
All right.

682
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,160
Well, here it is.

683
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,160
We got September and October.

684
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,160
Let's start with September.

685
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,160
Now, September was our biggest month.

686
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,800
There were five Sundays in the month of September, so we did more shows in September than any

687
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,200
other month.

688
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,520
Starting off with Episode 245, Neo Geo titles were announced for the Nintendo Wii's Virtual

689
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,520
Console.

690
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:59,200
So of course, a lot of people were like, OMG, Magician's Lair, Magician Lord, and OMG, Fatal

691
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,400
Fury, and all this stuff.

692
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:07,040
What always surprised me about this was that Fatal Fury is like nine bucks on the Nintendo

693
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,200
Wii, or you can get the souped up version with the improved HD and online play for five

694
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,200
bucks.

695
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,240
Or you can get the original car for like a hundred.

696
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,000
Well, I think that kind of goes out the window now with Virtual Console.

697
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,520
Actually, Jamie, you collect the old school Neo Geo cartridges.

698
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,520
I have some.

699
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,520
You paid hundreds of dollars.

700
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,160
But you do have some that you paid hundreds of dollars for, right?

701
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:32,960
The only one that I paid, and I got it for two hundred and something, was I got a chance

702
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,840
to buy King of Fighters 2000 for relatively cheap.

703
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,920
Nice.

704
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,280
And so that's the one that we've paid the most for, but we've got like, Samurai Shodown,

705
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,680
Samurai Shodown 2, Baseball Stars.

706
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,560
What do you think, as a collector, what do you think about all this stuff now coming

707
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,960
out on Virtual Console for less than ten bucks?

708
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,960
Good!

709
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,880
Because I don't have the money to spend on this crap, although I did want Samurai Shodown

710
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,880
5.

711
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,880
Right.

712
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,880
I would pay the money for that.

713
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,880
Right.

714
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,400
Well, episode 246 was the episode where Sony was sending out to all the critics out there

715
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,160
a review guide for Lair.

716
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,160
It was just IGN.

717
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,760
Well, IGN kind of like posted it, but they were sending it to several critics, this whole

718
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,280
little guide on Lair.

719
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,000
And they said, no, we're not trying to sway people's decisions, but they just want to

720
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,200
make sure everybody understood the game.

721
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,840
And the six-axis control, right?

722
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,400
But it was a very nicely bound little book.

723
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,440
Episode number 247 was the episode where Project Hammer was cancelled.

724
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,160
I wonder if any of those review guides went on the old eBay.

725
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,560
You know, we never looked.

726
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,560
We should have.

727
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,560
We could have put one up here in the studio.

728
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,560
It would have been fun.

729
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,240
Anyway, 247 was when Project Hammer was cancelled.

730
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,640
This is a game that looked to be a hell of a lot of fun when we saw it at E3, but apparently

731
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,680
somebody at Nintendo decided it wasn't good enough.

732
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,800
Sorry, Project Hammer reminds me too much of MC Hammer, and that's like so ten years

733
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,800
ago.

734
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,800
Exactly.

735
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,560
Project MC Hammer.

736
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,480
Reverend Hammer.

737
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,000
Episode number 248 was the week that Smash Bros. was announced that it was going to be

738
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,600
going online.

739
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,000
And of course, that caused a lot of people to go, whoo!

740
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,560
Of course, later on it was announced that it still has frame codes.

741
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:24,160
And the whole, the whole like thing with people just getting the computer, taking over and

742
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,160
stuff.

743
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,160
Okay.

744
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,160
Oh yeah, yeah.

745
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,160
That's weird.

746
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,560
I'm trying to get off topic here a little bit, but apparently, what was it, not Brothers

747
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:38,640
N'Arcs, Medal of Honor 2, or Heroes 2, is online, 32 players, and if I remember correctly,

748
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,880
does not have friends codes for the Wii.

749
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,880
Nice.

750
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,400
So why can't everybody do that?

751
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,960
Your guess is as good as mine.

752
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,880
So that was episode 248, and of course it was a five week month, episode 249, that was

753
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,920
the week that the Sex Pistols, it was announced that they were getting back together to re-record

754
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,340
the song Anarchy in the UK for Guitar Hero 3.

755
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:08,480
And of course, this is big news, I think, not so much like just the song itself or what

756
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,440
have you, but just the fact that, you know, video games, and especially a series like

757
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,800
Guitar Hero 3 has transcended the music game genre so much that bands that had been broken

758
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,240
up were coming back together for the purposes of recording for the game.

759
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,920
I mean, that in my mind is huge, especially as an old school music gaming fan.

760
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:34,420
So GS68, those are the five stories we picked, the Neo Geo titles on the Wii, Sony sending

761
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:38,760
out a review guide for Lair, Project Hammer getting cancelled, Smash Brothers going online,

762
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,120
Sex Pistols re-recording Anarchy in the UK.

763
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,640
Do you think one of those stories was the biggest one out in September, or do you have

764
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640
your own pick?

765
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,640
I have my own from episode 247, I think.

766
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,640
What's that?

767
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:54,440
It's one about the New Jersey parents being upset about the Wii Zapper.

768
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,520
You know, I was looking at that one when I was going through the show rules today, yeah,

769
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,920
the New Jersey parents being upset about the Wii Zapper.

770
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,920
Why do you think that was the biggest impact?

771
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:09,760
Well, I mean, like 20 years ago, the Wii Zapper, I mean, the NES Zapper, I mean, no one complained

772
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,960
about that, and then Super Nintendo had a Super Scope, I don't think anyone complained,

773
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:22,120
and a whole bunch of systems after that, but, like, a gunproof on the Wii, oh my gosh, you

774
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,120
must ban this.

775
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,880
I have a pick for the new story.

776
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,880
What do you think, Logie?

777
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:35,800
Halo 3 is released, come on, I mean, seriously, everyone's like, oh my god, Halo 3!

778
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,320
Yeah, but I don't know, well, yeah, it was.

779
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:43,640
I think the reason why it was overlooked here is because, you know, it kind of, well, no,

780
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:48,120
it's not that, because I do care about Halo 3, but just that most of the Halo 3 news was

781
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:52,600
everything leading up to its release, you know what I mean?

782
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
Yeah, I wonder.

783
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,600
Okay, how about this, episode, you know, 246 or whatever, it is announced that you cannot

784
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,560
put the helmets on your cat.

785
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,120
But that is disappointing.

786
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,840
Biggest news of the month.

787
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:06,160
Biggest news of 2007, honestly.

788
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,120
You okay, Jamie?

789
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,520
Blink blink blink.

790
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,400
Would you try to put the helmet on your cat, on Shermie?

791
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,400
Shermie's too stupid.

792
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,400
Yes, GS68.

793
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:20,520
Wait, can we put it on the, can we put the helmet on the ferret?

794
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,360
Can we put the helmet on the ferret?

795
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,360
We probably could.

796
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,680
If we could find the ferret, we could.

797
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,720
The ferret ran hiding since Rob threatened to put him down the food trash compactor.

798
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,720
I did, I did.

799
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,640
I think, I think Scarecrow's the penguin.

800
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,440
Possibly the new penguin from Argentina.

801
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,840
The penguin is frightening.

802
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,160
He is pretty fierce, he's very punk rock.

803
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,240
Alright, let's go on to October, our show's going to go on all night.

804
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:46,080
October, episode 250, that was a big week for us, because it was our 250th episode.

805
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:50,720
That was also the week that Nintendo announced that they were going to be offering what we

806
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,160
call the Wii Condoms, or, you know, the Wii, what are they officially called?

807
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,160
The Wii Sleeves or something like that?

808
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,160
Yeah.

809
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,160
But they look like giant Wii Condoms.

810
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,160
If it's true.

811
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,280
When you mode into the TV, you're probably stupid.

812
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,280
Exactly.

813
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,440
So it was definitely a way of nerfing the Wiimote.

814
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,720
But what was weird about that story is that no one was really expecting it.

815
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,720
You know what I mean?

816
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,720
Like, it came out of nowhere.

817
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,760
And like, it's like, oh, we're going to put out these straps that are better in this.

818
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,360
And then finally, it's like, oh, we're also going to put out these giant things that make

819
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,480
your Wiimote look like it's wrapped in a condom.

820
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,480
And people were like, what?

821
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,480
Why?

822
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,480
This is very interesting.

823
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,880
Episode 251 was- A broken episode.

824
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,560
Yes, that was a broken episode.

825
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:34,860
And the week that it was announced that Smash Brothers was delayed to 2008.

826
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:38,240
So Smash Brothers was completely delayed to 2008.

827
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:43,920
And that did not sit well with a lot of Nintendo Wii fans, sadly.

828
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,680
252 was a very big week, because that was the week that Capcom announced their goodies

829
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,960
for 2008, including Street Fighter IV was announced that week, as well as the next generation

830
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,440
version of Bionic Commando.

831
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,440
Fuck yeah.

832
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,240
Did you see the trailer for that?

833
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,400
Yeah, I've seen that one.

834
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,400
Isn't it pretty?

835
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,400
It is.

836
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,400
And it plays the music.

837
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,800
These little fangasms that we're having now is just reminiscent of what was happening

838
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,800
that third week in October.

839
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,240
I'm so excited right now, and it's going to be very disappointing when the game actually

840
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,240
comes out.

841
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,680
And I wonder if he's going to kill Hitler at the end.

842
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,680
I hope so.

843
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,760
That would be definitely the coup de grace.

844
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:21,640
And then the last show we taped in October, episode number 253, was the week that it was

845
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:26,120
discovered that Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3 are not playing nice.

846
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,040
The controllers were not compatible with each other.

847
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,720
If you wanted to play both games, you had to use Guitar Hero 2 controllers, but Guitar

848
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,040
Hero 3 on at least Playstation 3 was not compatible with each other.

849
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,120
We've been using our Xbox ones.

850
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,920
Xbox, I think, works one way, but it doesn't work the other way.

851
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,920
It works with Rock Band.

852
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,760
Yeah, it works with Rock Band, but the controller doesn't work with Guitar Hero 3.

853
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,720
It'd be better if they made a controller that didn't break.

854
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,400
Or just that they just would let them both be, you know, a lot of people are like, this

855
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,160
just sucks that they can't get along.

856
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,140
And I agree, it sucks that they can't get along.

857
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:59,120
What do you think GS68 was the biggest, or if you have one of your own, feel free to

858
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,120
share.

859
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,360
Nintendo offering Wii Condoms, Smash Brothers delayed, Capcom announces Street Fighter IV

860
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,720
and Bionic Commando, or Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3 just can't play nice.

861
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:14,020
I'm not too sure, I'm not, I don't really remember October too well.

862
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:22,560
But I'll probably guess, I'll probably guess Street Fighter IV, the Wiimote gloves, I guess.

863
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,560
The Wiimote gloves?

864
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,480
Yeah, that was pretty big.

865
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,800
I don't know, me personally, I would say the Smash Brothers delay, I know that seems weird

866
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,040
because then you kind of go, well that's a 2008 story, but that was a game that people

867
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:37,760
were so looking forward to and especially on the Wii that really needed some powerhouse

868
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,120
games, although I guess, I guess it didn't, it did pretty well this Christmas regardless,

869
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,600
but you know, just so many people were looking forward to that game, it was just a real disappointment

870
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,600
when that game got delayed.

871
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,120
If it wasn't for the delay, I'd be playing it right now.

872
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,200
We all would.

873
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,760
We probably wouldn't be doing this show, we would be playing Smash Brothers Brawl right

874
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,000
now.

875
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,960
And that's, you know, again, all the more reason why that game's got to be twice as

876
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,440
good or, you know, people are going to kind of go, oh we waited all this time for this?

877
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,000
Given all these delays, I have a feeling people are going to start calling it Super Smash

878
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,240
Brothers Forever.

879
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,360
I think somebody did earlier in chat actually.

880
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,360
It was me.

881
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:17,600
Alright, GS68, what in your opinion was the worst freaking game of 2007?

882
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:25,960
I'll probably have, I haven't played a lot of crappy games that were released in 2007,

883
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:31,920
but I might have, I'll probably give it to Initial D4.

884
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,760
Initial D4, Initial D4, why Initial D4?

885
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:43,680
Well, mainly because it was a program, so like, apparently there's this whole speed

886
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:48,960
limit system where if you go too fast on a certain corner your wheel locks and your acceleration

887
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:55,880
submers, and there's this penalty cancel glitch where you hit the brake to remove the acceleration

888
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:02,880
problem, and from what I've read, like, the recent official Initial D tournament is the

889
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,600
last one they're going to do because I've read that Initial D4 stopped doing very well

890
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,600
in Japan.

891
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:15,240
Like, over in Hong Kong, for example, Version 3 is doing better than Initial D4.

892
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,720
Wow, that is something else.

893
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:22,840
Well, that's a bummer that it really sucked it up on its fourth version.

894
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,040
I haven't even really played that one.

895
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,240
I've played Initial D3 though, that's a fun time.

896
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,240
Anyway, I'm sorry, go ahead.

897
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,560
Yeah, and what else?

898
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:48,800
Like, the tuning system for the game, like, if you want to, yeah, sorry.

899
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,800
That's alright.

900
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,000
You were going to say another game that you thought was the worst of the year?

901
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:02,080
Actually, no, I was going to bring up the whole customizing shop feature, instead of,

902
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:08,520
you have to eject your card three times just to get to that, so you have to point to the

903
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:14,560
continue screen, eject your card, and then to play, and then put your coins in, and then

904
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:19,320
start the game again, so that way you can get to the tuning shop faster.

905
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,640
In other words, it's a way to keep sucking up your money and sucking up your tokens.

906
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:29,120
Actually, that will only be in the case of if you had discounted continues, like five

907
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,680
points to start and four points to continue.

908
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,680
Interesting.

909
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,760
Well, okay, let's move on and stop talking about games that suck, and let's talk about

910
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,320
the best freaking game of 2007 in your opinion.

911
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,720
What was the best game in your opinion?

912
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,400
Maximum Tune 3.

913
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,640
Interesting.

914
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,980
You must be a real racing game fan, because you got both for your best and worst.

915
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:53,560
Why was Maximum Tune 3 your best game of the year?

916
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,880
I like what they did with the battle system, like instead of picking a set course, you

917
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,900
can now pick the route like partway through the game.

918
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:06,920
They also added new courses, like you cannot race on the whole one gun line instead of

919
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,800
just like a six kilometer stretch, which was pretty cool.

920
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,480
The soundtrack was pretty cool, more music-assuring stuff.

921
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,480
Absolutely.

922
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:22,920
And the ghost battle system, like the idea of racing a virtual opponent instead of them

923
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,400
having to be there.

924
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:31,800
Yeah, I've been listening to the soundtrack to Maximum Tune 3 in my car recently, actually.

925
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,880
And the thing I find about it, though, is if I listen to it too much, I drive too fast.

926
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,000
I speed way more often when I'm listening to wang game music than anything else, so

927
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
there you go.

928
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Well, do you...

929
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Yo, go ahead.

930
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,200
Isn't my CD player like 80 to 90 percent of the time?

931
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:51,400
I think it's music that was designed to put the pedal to the floor, and it happens in

932
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,400
my real car.

933
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,400
It's an unfortunate thing.

934
00:48:53,400 --> 00:49:04,760
I think the soundtrack and the graphics are meant to give the game a rave-ish look.

935
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,920
Several years ago, there was a game called Wanken Midnight, and the graphics and soundtrack

936
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,320
were nothing like Maximum Tunes.

937
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:19,360
Well, sometimes it happens that you have a series that's kind of similar, but I don't

938
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,360
know.

939
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,360
What are you talking about?

940
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:29,320
Like, there were older Wanken Midnight games released in 2001, and they were based on Tokyo

941
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,920
Extreme Racer.

942
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,240
And they looked and sounded nothing like Maximum Tune, because I guess Maximum Tune was made

943
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:42,240
to be more arcade-friendly.

944
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,240
I guess true.

945
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,760
Well, Wanken Midnight was actually us fighting the stuff on the manga.

946
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:51,280
Yeah, that was bullshit on manga.

947
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,240
All right, well, hey, GS68, we've got to let you go, because we've got some more months

948
00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:04,720
to go over, but I'll leave you with this thought of us all raving in the car right now.

949
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,400
Let's drop some ecstasy while it's hot.

950
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,400
No, just kidding.

951
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,400
All right.

952
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,200
We've got to let you go, GS68, but thank you so much, and have a great 2008, all right?

953
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,200
Thanks, you too.

954
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,200
All right, take care, buddy.

955
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,560
All right, we're looking for one more call to help us close out the year with November

956
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,560
and December.

957
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:26,620
If you want to give us a call right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

958
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:27,620
But we've got our caller.

959
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:29,000
Hi, who's on the air?

960
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Yeah.

961
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,880
I'd recognize that laugh anywhere.

962
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,800
This is Legend of Zaku, isn't it?

963
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,160
Yes, it is.

964
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,480
What is up, my friend?

965
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:41,400
Nothing much, just waiting till tomorrow.

966
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,400
What's tomorrow?

967
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,400
Waiting for that ball.

968
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,400
You know, that ball dropping in that middle of that big city on the base of the earth.

969
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,920
Oh, yes, I've heard of that before.

970
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,200
Are you going out to Times Square tomorrow?

971
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:57,720
Probably not, but I am getting drunk tomorrow legitimately.

972
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,720
You're not drunk now?

973
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,720
With friends, no.

974
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,920
All right, but you'll be drunk tomorrow.

975
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:08,960
Yeah, just going over the year that was 2007 in gaming.

976
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:15,000
Are you ready to go over November with us?

977
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,440
I don't have my memory associated, but let's do it.

978
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,520
I'll help you.

979
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,400
I've got four stories here to help remind you what happened in November.

980
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:40,160
Episode 254 was the week that Manhunt 2 on the PSP was hack-sored to remove some of the

981
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:48,480
target basically quickly rushed to judgment and pulled it off even though there's no way

982
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,120
in hell you're going to get to it unless you have massive experience in PSP hacking.

983
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:56,520
But Loki, you did it the day this thing came out, didn't you?

984
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:02,120
You had your PSP stripped of the censored stuff in it.

985
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,120
Was it worth it?

986
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,120
No.

987
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:11,360
Was it worth it for fucking genitals getting like, I don't know, basically hurt?

988
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,160
Isn't that what got censored?

989
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:19,480
Weren't the genitals, what do you call it, hurt?

990
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,480
Yes.

991
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,120
Electrocuted, mashed.

992
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,440
They were ripped off of pliers.

993
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,440
Ew.

994
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,440
Oh, wow.

995
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,800
Yeah, this game sounds pretty horrible.

996
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,840
I didn't even play it.

997
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,440
I don't need to.

998
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,440
Let's see.

999
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,440
Episode number 255.

1000
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,440
That was the week.

1001
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,440
This was a slow news week.

1002
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,720
I didn't have a lot from this week.

1003
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,720
NPD withholds sales numbers from the press.

1004
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:47,040
And actually, it is kind of relevant because, you know, obviously it kind of leaves it in

1005
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,920
the company's hands to be kind of bragging.

1006
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,960
And you've seen companies kind of stretch these reports out a little bit.

1007
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:54,960
Of course.

1008
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:55,960
They want a piece.

1009
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:56,960
They're stockholders.

1010
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,960
Exactly.

1011
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:58,960
You don't want to.

1012
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,960
What the hell?

1013
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:00,960
Are you at a 7-Eleven or something?

1014
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,320
I heard a little phone go off.

1015
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,320
Yeah, what's up?

1016
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,320
It sounds like the phone's at 7-Eleven when they ring.

1017
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,360
Yeah, my phone just went off.

1018
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,360
Just keep coming quickly.

1019
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,360
Sorry, sir.

1020
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:15,480
But when we say withhold, they didn't withhold everything.

1021
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:20,200
They just reduced some of the information that was going out there and caused the companies

1022
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,960
to basically be on their own.

1023
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,360
Jesus Christ, you got a beeper too?

1024
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,360
Yeah.

1025
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,240
He's got a beeper.

1026
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,240
Maybe we should get another caller.

1027
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,240
He's got a pimp.

1028
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,240
All right.

1029
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,240
Hold on a second.

1030
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,240
I'll be right back.

1031
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,240
Yeah.

1032
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,240
What happened?

1033
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,240
You are not putting us on hold.

1034
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,240
We will hang up on you.

1035
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,240
Okay.

1036
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,240
Okay.

1037
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,240
Okay.

1038
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,240
Bye.

1039
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,240
Yeah.

1040
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,240
Hello.

1041
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,240
All right.

1042
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,240
I can't believe we got put on hold by a caller.

1043
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,240
No, no, no.

1044
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,240
It was only quickly.

1045
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,240
All right.

1046
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,240
Let's.

1047
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,240
All right.

1048
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,240
Let's.

1049
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,240
All right.

1050
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,240
Ooh.

1051
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,240
Strike one, Zaku.

1052
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,240
All right.

1053
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,240
Episode 256 was the week.

1054
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,240
What a way to end the year.

1055
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,240
Yeah.

1056
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,240
Week number 256.

1057
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,240
Episode 256.

1058
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:07,280
That was the week that the Xbox download service was announced on the Xbox 360.

1059
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,780
You would be able to download original Xbox games to the service, and of course we've

1060
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:15,360
seen this come out now, and you can get Psychonauts and Indigo Prophecy.

1061
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,880
Kind of a way to rediscover Xbox games you may have missed the first time around.

1062
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,240
Or for some people, a way overpriced way to do it.

1063
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,240
Well, yeah.

1064
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,240
Of course.

1065
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,240
The marketplace.

1066
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:31,680
So who the hell would put price tags on fucking icons and themes, and basically do it against

1067
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:36,400
the will of game developers as well when they don't want to charge for that shit for downloadable

1068
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,400
content?

1069
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,400
Loki, do you agree?

1070
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,400
You don't.

1071
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,400
Like Epic, for example.

1072
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:45,040
They don't want to do that shit, but they're forced to, because they have no choice most

1073
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,040
of the time.

1074
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,800
Why do you think Unreal Tournament 3 is being held up for the 360, besides the user-created

1075
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,800
stuff?

1076
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,600
Well, it's being held up because they can't do cross-platform play between the PC and

1077
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,600
the PC.

1078
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:00,880
Well, that too, but user-created mods is the other hinging factor.

1079
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,440
Well, they can worry about that later.

1080
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,320
That's not really a factor to keep it from being released.

1081
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:09,040
Ah, god damn it.

1082
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,040
Jesus Christ!

1083
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,040
Is someone at the door now?

1084
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,280
Just go through the last song.

1085
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,280
The last one.

1086
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,280
Yes, sir.

1087
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,880
Guitar Hero's 80s edition sued because the song is too similar.

1088
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:24,720
The romantic suit Guitar Hero 80s edition, and as we all know they lost, the judge laughed

1089
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,720
that out of court.

1090
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,680
All right, out of those stories, Van Hunt, too, Guitar Hero.

1091
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,680
The first one.

1092
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,440
Wait, are you going to give us your best one?

1093
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,700
That's why you don't answer the phone.

1094
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,440
You let it go to voicemail.

1095
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:48,520
Tony, you're the one that keeps answering the calls for him, man.

1096
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,520
That's just not cool.

1097
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,040
Dip it in the butt.

1098
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,600
That's just not cool.

1099
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,000
I'm sorry.

1100
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,400
I'm not offended because I think it's hilarious, honestly.

1101
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,400
I'm offended.

1102
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,480
All right, the first one, bye.

1103
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,560
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1104
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:07,560
Fuck that.

1105
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,560
I'm doing December.

1106
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,880
All right, no, I will see.

1107
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,120
Let me open up Skype, see if anybody else wants to call us.

1108
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,560
Give it a couple minutes.

1109
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:20,880
One eight seven seven game O-L-R or our user name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1110
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,520
Act deft in chat says best call ever, ever.

1111
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:31,800
If somebody would like to call us and take Zaku's place, you can call us right now.

1112
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:40,360
One eight seven seven game O-L-R or our user name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1113
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:44,120
I'm going to give it like 10 seconds and I'm just going to say, Loki, fuck it, you can

1114
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,120
just do it.

1115
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,960
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1116
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,960
Who's this?

1117
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:49,960
This is DT.

1118
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,360
Praise be to God, Dark Tetsuya.

1119
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,920
How are you, my friend?

1120
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,760
Oh, good.

1121
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,160
Think you can do a better job than the last caller?

1122
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,160
Yeah.

1123
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,160
All right.

1124
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,560
Well, let me recap for you, Dark Tetsuya.

1125
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,760
When we left off, we were in November.

1126
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,000
Manhunt 2 on the PSP was hacked.

1127
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,440
MPD withholds sales numbers from the press, Xbox originals are announced for download

1128
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:16,480
on Xbox 360, and Guitar Hero's 80s edition gets sued because the songs are too similar.

1129
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,120
What do you think had the biggest impact in November?

1130
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:22,600
Oh, Manhunt 2, definitely.

1131
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,600
Definitely.

1132
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,120
Just because of the fallout that came with that, right?

1133
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,120
Oh, yeah.

1134
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,120
Absolutely.

1135
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:32,600
You would have thought they would have learned with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, but no.

1136
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,960
Oh, no, no.

1137
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,680
Everything tells me this won't be the last time, either.

1138
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,680
Oh, no.

1139
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:39,680
All right.

1140
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:44,560
Well, then we move on to December, and in December, we had episode number 258.

1141
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:48,440
Now, technically, this happened in November, but we covered it in December, so we're putting

1142
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,160
it in December's news.

1143
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:56,480
That was the week that a certain editor was let go from a certain major gaming blog, allegedly

1144
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,000
due to a certain review that he had written about a certain game that was being heavily

1145
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,680
advertised on the site.

1146
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,680
That's right.

1147
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:08,720
That's Jeff Gerstmann, and really, you could just say that name, The Gerstmann Incident,

1148
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,880
and have you even seen, now there's movie trailers and shit and everything, like fake

1149
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:12,880
movie trailers?

1150
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:13,880
Yeah, because people have that much free time.

1151
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:19,920
Honestly, though, if no one brought it back up, would you still remember, I completely

1152
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,920
forgot about this, and thank God, because all you need to know is not to trust the bigger

1153
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:25,920
sites.

1154
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,920
Trust us, because we're awesome.

1155
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:31,480
Well, I stand by what I said before, that there's multiple sides to every story, and

1156
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:36,440
actually, oddly enough, you would think me, of all people, would be the biggest critic

1157
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:40,240
of GameSpot in this situation, but I actually think people didn't give them enough credit.

1158
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,240
No.

1159
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,880
And I think we're too quick to blame the big corpse.

1160
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,880
I just didn't care.

1161
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,200
I was getting annoyed at that point.

1162
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,760
I'm like, thank God they fired you.

1163
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,400
This story's taking too long.

1164
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,840
All right, well, there was other news in December.

1165
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:57,880
Episode 259 was Nintendo pulls ads due to the high demand of the Nintendo Wii.

1166
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:03,240
They basically said, okay, we can't make these Wiis fast enough.

1167
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,240
Everybody still wants one.

1168
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,880
You know, maybe we'll hold off on the advertising until the first quarter next year.

1169
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,880
Well, that makes sense.

1170
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,200
I mean, if you're going to, you know, you're having no problem selling one item, why do

1171
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,520
you need to advertise it?

1172
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:19,240
Advertise it for one, that may not be selling as well, and they have a little bit more of,

1173
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:22,080
so it makes sense to me.

1174
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:28,840
In episode number 260, DVR and internet radio launches on Sony PSPs in Japan.

1175
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:33,480
And funny enough, later that week, internet radio actually followed in the US, and that

1176
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,380
was released on the PSPs a little later.

1177
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:40,320
So the PSPs get the doors open to DVR and internet radio in Japan and internet radio

1178
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,760
here in the US.

1179
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:48,380
And then that takes us all the way to episode number 261, which was earlier tonight.

1180
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:53,760
And in part A, we talked about Akira Yamaoka comes out and says that Japanese development's

1181
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,880
in trouble, and that the American development's where it's at right now, and of course Silent

1182
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,640
Hill 5 is being developed right here in America.

1183
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,200
What do you think out of those four stories, Dark Tetsuya had the biggest impact on gaming

1184
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,360
in 2007?

1185
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:11,240
Jeff Gertzman in the fallout there, Nintendo pulling ads due to the Wii demand, DVR and

1186
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:18,760
internet radio hits the PSP, or Akira Yamaoka saying that development is, it's in America

1187
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,760
is where it's at.

1188
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:20,760
Oh, Gertzman, definitely.

1189
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:25,720
Yeah, I think that's kind of a no-brainer, but why do you say that?

1190
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,120
What do you think is the fallout that that could have in 2008?

1191
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:39,080
Well, I don't know, it was like back in the day, I don't know if you remember, it was

1192
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:46,280
when EGM gave Super Street Fighter II poor scores, Capcom pulled advertising.

1193
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:50,240
I don't recall this so much, but now that you're saying it, I kind of go, yeah, you

1194
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,560
know what, that does kind of sound familiar.

1195
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:55,040
I do remember something like that happening, right?

1196
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,040
Yeah.

1197
01:00:56,040 --> 01:01:01,480
So it kind of just goes to show this is something that kind of has happened before and has kind

1198
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:07,200
of made a lot of people go, you know, there needs to be responsibility on both ends.

1199
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,540
And again, as I do a lot, I compare things to the movie industry, you know, just because

1200
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:15,000
Siskel and Ebert might give a movie a bad review, well, Siskel doesn't review anything

1201
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:23,720
anymore, but just because Ebert and Roper, Ebert gives a thumbs up, Siskel's rrrr brains,

1202
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:29,160
Ebert and Roper might give something a bad review doesn't mean that suddenly, you know,

1203
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,040
they're going to stop advertising in the Chicago newspaper.

1204
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:36,200
Siskel won't get me out of Ebert's stomach.

1205
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:42,520
Ah, forget it, it's been plenty of time, it's not too soon anymore.

1206
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:46,320
I want this show to be over, so we need to get to the best and worst games of the year.

1207
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:50,960
Dark Tetsuya, in your big opinion, what was the worst freaking game of 2007?

1208
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:59,480
Oh, God, I hadn't really played all that much, so I guess it goes with Yaris.

1209
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,040
When in doubt, Yaris, right?

1210
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,040
When in doubt.

1211
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,040
Right.

1212
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,960
You drive a car with a claw, enough said.

1213
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:09,480
Alright, what was the best game of 2007, in your opinion?

1214
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:15,560
Oh, God, I just rented it, Super Mario Galaxy.

1215
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,120
And why this game?

1216
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:24,600
Well, it's what Mario 64 2 should have been.

1217
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,160
Instead of what we got on the GameCube, Super Mario Sunshine?

1218
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,160
Yeah.

1219
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,160
Gotcha.

1220
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,160
Exactly.

1221
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,160
Alright.

1222
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:34,160
Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1223
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,880
No, that's about it.

1224
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:37,880
Alright.

1225
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:42,480
Alright, well, Dark Tetsuya, thanks so much for calling and helping us out with the rest

1226
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,480
of the year.

1227
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:44,480
We appreciate it.

1228
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:45,480
Have a good one.

1229
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:46,480
Yeah, you too.

1230
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,480
Alright.

1231
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,480
Take care.

1232
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:52,760
Dark Tetsuya, of course, writes for our website once in a while when there's news to report

1233
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:53,760
on.

1234
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,660
Legend of Zaku posted his picks in chat.

1235
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:01,120
He would have picked God of War 2 for the best game of the year and Kane and Lynch for

1236
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,120
the worst game of the year.

1237
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,640
Well, ha ha, you were answering the phone while you were on the phone with us, so yours

1238
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:10,000
doesn't count, rude person.

1239
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,840
There you have it if you were curious.

1240
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:15,840
Alright, that took us through the whole year.

1241
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,940
What a trip down memory lane.

1242
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:18,120
What a long trip down memory lane.

1243
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:22,360
But it just goes to show us a fucking lot's happened this year.

1244
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:25,260
A lot's happened this year.

1245
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:30,280
What do you guys think was the biggest story out of them all?

1246
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:33,760
What do you think, of all those stories we did tonight, what do you think maybe had the

1247
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,940
most impact in gaming altogether?

1248
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:39,360
When we called your mom.

1249
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:42,180
And how did that impact the gaming scene?

1250
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:46,520
It put me in a good mood and I went home and played a game.

1251
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:49,320
I hate you.

1252
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,200
We called my mom too.

1253
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,640
What would you say is the story of the year?

1254
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:57,040
Was it Manhunt 2?

1255
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,800
Was it Smash Brothers getting delayed?

1256
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,500
Was it Codemasters and the broken Bubble Bobble game?

1257
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,100
Was it the lady dying over the Nintendo Wii?

1258
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:09,360
So many people wanted a Wii that she drank so much she died?

1259
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,360
I think it was Proteus.

1260
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,360
Proteus?

1261
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,560
I would say probably the biggest story of the year.

1262
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,560
I don't know.

1263
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,160
For me, it's the Bubble Bobble thing.

1264
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,160
It really is.

1265
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:24,100
Because seriously, seriously, how do you do that?

1266
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,040
How does that happen?

1267
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,360
Seriously.

1268
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:30,240
But that's just me.

1269
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,240
All right.

1270
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,240
Loki?

1271
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:42,440
I would say, not Bubble Bobble, because seriously, how many people bought Bubble Bobble?

1272
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:43,440
That affected what?

1273
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,440
Five people?

1274
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:47,200
Seriously.

1275
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:57,320
I would say probably, I don't know, the fact that it's a crime that Activision released

1276
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:02,360
three Guitar Hero games this year.

1277
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:03,360
Huh?

1278
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:05,360
Yeah, that's a crime.

1279
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:12,080
I don't know, let me think.

1280
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,440
Was that last year or this year?

1281
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,400
I can't remember when Red Octane was purchased by Activision.

1282
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,400
Last year?

1283
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,400
That was last year.

1284
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,400
All right.

1285
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,400
Well, let's move on.

1286
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,520
Let's talk about our top five games of the year and our picks for the worst game of the

1287
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,520
year.

1288
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,760
We're just out of the way.

1289
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,320
The worst game of the year, we're going to tally it up with what the listeners say and

1290
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,320
figure it out here.

1291
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,680
DarkStalker, what in your opinion was the worst game of the year?

1292
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,680
The worst game?

1293
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:36,680
I actually have a list of five.

1294
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,120
You have a list of five?

1295
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:39,120
All right.

1296
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,120
The worst games of the year.

1297
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:44,960
I'm going to say Manhunt 2 was one of them, just because I got sick of hearing all the

1298
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:45,960
crap.

1299
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:46,960
Imagine Babies.

1300
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:47,960
Okay.

1301
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,800
Although that was a funny picture with you.

1302
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:54,200
Anything with the Bratz franchise, and I'll say Yaris too, just because.

1303
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,540
But I got warnings, so I didn't play it.

1304
01:05:56,540 --> 01:06:00,880
And then I have to put this one on here for sauce.

1305
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:01,880
This is a quote.

1306
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:06,520
Heroes of Mana is the worst game of 2007 because you need a doctorate in electrical engineering

1307
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:09,640
to understand how to play the fucking game.

1308
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,120
So I'm going to pick that one.

1309
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,120
Heroes of Mana.

1310
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,120
On her suggestion.

1311
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:16,160
God damn, the Mana games started sucking after Secret of Mana, didn't they?

1312
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,400
It's very unfortunate.

1313
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:22,040
I wish that we had gotten Second Sense 3.

1314
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,920
You never know in the virtual console, you never know.

1315
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:28,160
Loki, your pick for the worst fucking game of 2007.

1316
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,720
I too had five, actually six if you can.

1317
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:31,960
Jeez, I only had one.

1318
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:32,960
This is easy.

1319
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:38,240
Well, I was thinking, okay, my number one is not Yaris.

1320
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,520
But anyways.

1321
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:46,760
So number six, Off-Road Extreme Special Edition, although I did not play it, but it was horrible.

1322
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:51,560
I did play this game, Counterforce, for the Wii, yet another game by Conspiracy Entertainment.

1323
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:55,240
In fact, my number three would be anything from Conspiracy Entertainment.

1324
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:59,120
Or actually, that'd be number four.

1325
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:04,800
Number three, I actually, this was the only, the first and only game I will ever import

1326
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,600
for the PS3.

1327
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:10,520
Wangan Midnight is a fucking joke on the PlayStation 3.

1328
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:13,640
It is poor for a PlayStation 2 game.

1329
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:14,640
I hated it.

1330
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,680
It was a waste of $60.

1331
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:20,960
Yaris is number two, and the reason it's number two is because it's free.

1332
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:25,680
Number one, I paid fucking $50 for it, and it was a ripoff.

1333
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:30,880
Transformers The Game, the worst, biggest disappointment of a game this year.

1334
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,120
How do you fuck that up?

1335
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,800
But you did.

1336
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:39,840
I only had picked one game as the worst game of the year, and I also did not pick Yaris.

1337
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,800
It was tempting, but it was free.

1338
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,040
We do have to remember Yaris was free.

1339
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,040
Yeah, free.

1340
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,120
If it sucked, it's a big deal.

1341
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:51,400
There is a game that I bought because I was excited at the prospects of the game, and

1342
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:57,800
the way it was put together and the way it was packaged, it just felt so rushed.

1343
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,760
It was just a steaming pile of poo.

1344
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:05,680
I hated, I mean, there's not a lot of times I go, I really fucking hate this game.

1345
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:11,840
I hate Fusion Frenzy 2 so much.

1346
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:14,980
That game was awful, awful, awful, awful.

1347
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:18,320
That is definitely the worst game of the year, and I can't believe they would, that's highway

1348
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,520
robbery that they ever tried to charge full price for that game.

1349
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,200
I forgot.

1350
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,160
My wallet was raped by that game.

1351
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:32,840
I forgot one more honorable mention, I guess, because it is also free.

1352
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:40,600
You remember the vision camera from Microsoft, which was that totem ball.

1353
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,760
Wasn't the vision cam last year?

1354
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,920
No, it was this year.

1355
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:43,920
Was it?

1356
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:44,920
Yeah.

1357
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:45,920
It was last year.

1358
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:46,920
It was last year.

1359
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:47,920
Who gives a shit?

1360
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:48,920
Totem ball still sucks.

1361
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:53,480
It sucked in 2007 as well as 2006, all right.

1362
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:57,320
So when you add it all up though, let's see, you get one vote for Fusion Frenzy 2, one

1363
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:01,440
vote for Transformers the Game, one vote for Heroes of Mana, one vote for Initial D4, one

1364
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:04,560
vote for Call of Duty 4, and four votes for Yaris.

1365
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:11,420
So Yaris gets, definitely runs away with the title of the worst game of 2007.

1366
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:13,500
How about the best games of 2007?

1367
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:17,040
Here it is, the time for us to name our five top games of the year.

1368
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,080
Do you want to just name all five at once, Jamie?

1369
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,080
Sure.

1370
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,080
All right, Jamie, give us your top five and why.

1371
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:26,040
Number five is a wind on two, because when I got to play it, it was pretty fun, although

1372
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:28,040
I still suck at wind on.

1373
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:32,440
So four would be Silent Hill Origins, just what I got to see of it again, because I've

1374
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,720
had a really busy, crazy year.

1375
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:37,520
Three is Super Mario Galaxy, I thought was really cool.

1376
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:42,080
Two is Rock Band, because again, super cool, and Radiohead.

1377
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,560
And one, Portal, duh.

1378
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:45,560
So that's it.

1379
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:46,560
Enough said, huh?

1380
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:52,560
The Portal was just super innovative, and I love anything that messes with physics.

1381
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:58,040
I would totally be a physics major if it wasn't for the retarded math.

1382
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,880
All right.

1383
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:01,880
There you go.

1384
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:02,880
Loki.

1385
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:03,880
Okay, like I said.

1386
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:07,080
Now remember, these are the top five games.

1387
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,920
We can use any criteria we want.

1388
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:09,920
Exactly.

1389
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,060
They're all in order of just how much fun I've had with them.

1390
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:18,960
By no means does that mean that they're a great game or that they're impressive to look

1391
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,480
at or anything like that.

1392
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,960
It's just how much fun I've had with each one.

1393
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:26,360
Number five, Ghost Squad.

1394
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:32,400
Seriously, one of the most underrated games, at least for the Wii Zapper that's come out

1395
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,420
for the Wii this year, it's cheap.

1396
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:36,480
It's probably going to get cheaper.

1397
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:41,600
And granted, the graphics aren't that great, the game is incredibly short, but I will tell

1398
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:45,160
you, I played that game through like six times in a row.

1399
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:49,440
The fact that you can unlock like 50 different weapons in the game that makes the games even

1400
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:54,640
harder, and I don't know, it was the most fun I had for about four hours.

1401
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:59,200
And that's all I've played of it so far, but Ghost Squad, definitely worth picking up on

1402
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:02,860
the Wii, if you like gun games.

1403
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:05,960
Rock Band, fun.

1404
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:13,800
I have to give it props because I bought Guitar Hero 2, and I bought Guitar Hero for the Playstation,

1405
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:18,520
I played it like once, and I said fuck this, and put it down, and that's where it gathered

1406
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:19,520
dust.

1407
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:24,520
Rock Band actually played for a lot more than that, and it's actually pretty fun.

1408
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:27,800
Just wish there was an easier way to be able to play online with multiple people, like

1409
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:33,880
in a world mode or something like that, but definitely a fun game, and it's actually one

1410
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:37,240
of the games I actually look forward to the download content coming out for it, which

1411
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:42,480
I can't really say bad about many other games.

1412
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:47,120
Let's see here, Bioshock, it was a great game while it lasted.

1413
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:54,000
I thought maybe a little bit short, not a whole lot of replayability, but I had fun

1414
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
while playing it.

1415
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Alright, and that takes us to number one.

1416
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,040
No, that's number three.

1417
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,880
I can't count, okay.

1418
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,360
Number two, Crackdown.

1419
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:07,960
The best thing for a futuristic Grand Theft Auto, absolutely fun.

1420
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:12,920
The most fun I've had in a demo for a game, ever.

1421
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:18,200
Absolutely fun to play online, of course that fizzles away pretty quick, and the game kind

1422
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,200
of got repetitive.

1423
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:22,440
Had some pretty good download content for it, I actually went back to it because I thought

1424
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:27,220
my save had gotten corrupted, luckily all that happened was I erased an update once

1425
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:29,760
I downloaded that again, it worked just fine.

1426
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:34,560
Real fun game to play online, and then of course that takes me to number one, and once

1427
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:42,480
again, the game did not have good graphics, the game had really crappy AI, the game is

1428
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:48,680
extremely cheesy, but I cannot tell you how many fucking hours I've played this game,

1429
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:54,580
just to beat it, just to unlock all the weapons, just to try to get the five achievements that

1430
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:56,320
are in it.

1431
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:01,960
Earth Defense Force 2017, absolutely the best $20 you'll ever spend, if you find it used

1432
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,200
you can probably find it for even cheaper than that.

1433
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:10,000
D3 really, really, really needs to bring over the simple series over here, because it's

1434
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:16,280
absolutely good money, it's the cheesiest, weirdest games you'll ever play, and unfortunately

1435
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:22,440
because they're so weird they don't end up coming over here, but I hope that changes.

1436
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:25,560
My turn, top five games of the year.

1437
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:28,840
I'm not surprised, Earth Defense Force 2017, for you, because you are a guy that's all

1438
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:32,020
about fun, and you know, blowing shit up is fun.

1439
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:35,920
You can blow up, you can level entire cities, and then they come back to the next level,

1440
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,720
and you can level them all over again.

1441
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:44,240
It's seriously, we've played it for, I don't know how many hours, I have it logged in the

1442
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:47,680
game, it's over 70 hours, I know that.

1443
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:55,880
My number five game of the year is a game that really transcended that kind of what

1444
01:13:55,880 --> 01:14:01,800
is a casual game and what is a hardcore game type of thing, and the thing I think that

1445
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:06,680
makes this game great is that it's really a game that anybody can get into, and it took

1446
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:12,140
this game that had no depth at all, and gave it an amazing amount of depth, and that's

1447
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:18,480
Puzzle Quest, was an amazing game that bejeweled and just put little twists on it that made

1448
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:23,040
a whole role-playing game out of it, and a more competitive type of game out of it, that

1449
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,960
made this game a hell of a lot of fun, and I've watched my roommate spend countless hours

1450
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,680
on Puzzle Quest, he doesn't play anything else but Puzzle Quest.

1451
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:33,300
There's certainly a lot of people who may not even be into games otherwise that Puzzle

1452
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:38,240
Quest has kind of brought them in, so Puzzle Quest obviously was released on damn near

1453
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:42,900
every system this year because there was just that much demand for it, so Puzzle Quest was

1454
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:46,760
an amazing game, it was my number five game of the year.

1455
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:50,520
My number four game of the year is one of those games that probably most critics aren't

1456
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:58,240
even going to put on their top ten, but for me it was so great to finally see a true Japanese

1457
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:02,440
role-playing style game on a next-gen console and to see what it could do, and I thought

1458
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:09,880
the story in this game was so amazing, yet kind of depressing, and the way that it wove

1459
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:16,120
real life in with this fictional scenario was just something really innovative and new,

1460
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:20,920
and that's why Eternal Sonata for me was just a different type of gaming experience that

1461
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:26,580
I really enjoyed and had to be in my top five for the year, absolutely.

1462
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:31,960
Say what you want about it getting stale towards the end or what have you, or how insanely

1463
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:36,320
difficult and, or not so much difficult but how redundant some of the battles can get

1464
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:44,640
later on, but Eternal Sonata is just an amazing game that I would play more and more.

1465
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:48,520
My number three game has been lauded by a lot of people as one of the best games of

1466
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:55,400
the year, and you know, it deserves to be here graphically, it's a triumph.

1467
01:15:55,400 --> 01:16:01,600
The mood this game creates, few games are able to pull off, and it's something I don't

1468
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:06,240
usually experience outside of a Silent Hill game, but Bioshock totally scared the hell

1469
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:11,680
out of me the first time I played it, because it is a scary fucking game, and it really

1470
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:17,360
is kind of like playing a movie, it really is, so Bioshock is just amazing.

1471
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:21,760
My number two game of the year is all about fun, and I just, I did not think that this

1472
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:25,800
game was going to be so great because my expectations I guess were actually a little bit low because

1473
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:30,720
like I said earlier in the show, I was not a big fan of Mario 64 as much as the next

1474
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:36,800
guy, but Super Mario Galaxy just blew me away, it is so much fun and is really the type of

1475
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:41,240
game that I think the Wii was built for, so Super Mario Galaxy is absolutely my number

1476
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:42,240
two game of the year.

1477
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:49,360
And that takes me to number one game of the year, I admit it, I do not like to spend as

1478
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:54,400
much money as I do on gaming, I spend a lot of money on games, and that is why value is

1479
01:16:54,400 --> 01:17:01,680
so important to me, and in my opinion, there is no better value out there in gaming right

1480
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:06,800
now, period, than the Orange Box, and that is one of the sole reasons why the Orange

1481
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,840
Box is my game of the year, because you get these great, obviously Half Life is an incredible

1482
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:18,520
series of games, Team Fortress 2, a lot of fun, the unique art style of Team Fortress

1483
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:29,840
2 really sets it apart from the other games, and of course Portal, when you play Portal

1484
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:34,320
you feel like you are starting to play the next great series of games, like something

1485
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:39,520
truly original has started with Portal that I think is going to continue, and you have

1486
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:45,400
all these in-jokes and the whole the cake is a lie, and not every game, especially its

1487
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:53,240
first time out the gate, can create that kind of buzz, so the Orange Box absolutely is the

1488
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:56,460
best game that came out in 2007, it is not only the best deal in gaming, but just some

1489
01:17:56,460 --> 01:18:01,740
of the most solid games you are going to get, and the best 60 bucks you can spend on games,

1490
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:08,960
so there it is, my top 5 games of the year, so let us tally it up, we have one vote for

1491
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:17,400
Call of Duty 4, one vote for Maximum Tune 3, one vote for Earth Defense Force 2017, two

1492
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:23,040
votes for Super Mario Galaxy, but if you combine Portal with Orange Box you get four votes

1493
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:26,560
for Portal and Orange Box this year, so I am going to have to say that Orange Box is

1494
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,480
collectively Orange Launch Radio's game of the year.

1495
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:35,560
I did say Half Life 2 earlier for one of my ones that did not make the list, it is part

1496
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:43,320
of the game, it is ironic, because I remember when I first heard about this game, the Orange

1497
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:46,160
Box, I was like, oh isn't that funny, we are Orange Launch Radio and here is this game

1498
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:50,040
the Orange Box, I built a computer called the Orange Box, and what is also funny about

1499
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:53,820
it is that I remember saying, I was kind of like, oh these are the, oh I am not really

1500
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:58,080
into these kind of games, I don't really like the first person shooters, Portal, it is a

1501
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:02,800
shooter, I am not going to like that, Portal makes me enjoy first person shooters, because

1502
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:07,140
it is a different, I mean I think even people that don't enjoy first person shooters can

1503
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:09,920
enjoy Portal, and that is what makes the game so great.

1504
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:15,680
There you have it, the Orange Box, and no we are not changing our name to Orange Box

1505
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:20,080
Lounge Radio, that would be no fun at all, but the Orange Box is collectively our game

1506
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:23,200
of the year.

1507
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:28,800
Which takes us to 2008, what do you guys think, what do you think is going to happen in 2008,

1508
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:34,800
any predictions you want to make for 2008, Loki?

1509
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:47,860
I don't know, gosh, probably see the DS redesigned again, I don't know, they need to put out

1510
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:53,000
some good games for the PS3, or else they are going to be hurting, I know we will see

1511
01:19:53,000 --> 01:20:02,760
Metal Gear Solid 4 come out, Grand Theft Auto will probably push to fall, bastards, Halo

1512
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:07,680
Wars probably coming out towards the end of the year, hopefully Fable 2, hopefully Spore

1513
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:12,480
actually makes it out this spring, because I need a good game to run on my new PC, and

1514
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:20,720
then I might hear about another portable platform or something like that, maybe they will redesign

1515
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:26,340
an online service like Nintendo Mail, Nintendo really needs to do something with their online

1516
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:39,680
service, I don't know, you might see a blue and black DS in February, I don't know.

1517
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:46,520
Dark Sakura, any predictions you want to make for the year 2008, Duke Nukem, Duke Nukem

1518
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:53,240
Forever will fucking come out at some point, and it will be disappointing.

1519
01:20:53,240 --> 01:21:00,640
I think that Super Smash Brothers Brawl will get pushed again, I keep expecting it.

1520
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:04,000
You know what, here is something that is kind of interesting, and I have actually looked

1521
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:10,120
at it, I have been kind of following it a little bit, I loved Saints Row, and we still

1522
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:16,600
play it every day, it kind of is holding us over until Grand Theft Auto IV, but at the

1523
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:24,920
same time, Saints Row 2 is supposed to be coming out, I think this year, or 2008, and

1524
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:29,080
it actually looks pretty good, and I'm kind of wondering, I know Grand Theft Auto IV is

1525
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:35,440
going to be amazing, but Saints Row 2 can be a really good contender for it, especially

1526
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:43,920
if that gets pushed back to October or something for Grand Theft Auto IV, that game might surprise

1527
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:47,520
people, I know they're going to plan on doing co-op through the entire story mode, just

1528
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:52,560
like Crackdown, which is an excellent idea, and then they're going to tweak the online

1529
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:59,700
play a little bit more and stuff like that, but I think it's awesome, I can't wait.

1530
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:05,640
Because I'm going to make, in the third or fourth quarter of 2008, Sony will redesign

1531
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:11,600
the PlayStation 3 and do an effective relaunch, a reboot of the system, the way maybe they

1532
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:15,780
should have done it the first time, and the reboot will include a playable demo of Final

1533
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:21,040
Fantasy XIII that's going to blow everybody away, but Metal Gear Solid 4 will not single-handedly

1534
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:25,000
save the PlayStation 3, and that's what's going to want to cause them to really cut

1535
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:29,080
corners in the cost, and they're going to release the system just as dirt-cheap as possible,

1536
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:33,800
to try and get people to buy it.

1537
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:38,960
Somebody will challenge Nintendo to the throne of handheld gaming, and it won't be Sony.

1538
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:43,120
I think in 2008, I think this year, this is a very just out there prediction, I don't

1539
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:46,600
know, I get the feeling Nintendo has such a large share of the marketplace in handheld,

1540
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:52,380
I think someone else wants a piece of that besides Sony, but I don't think it's Microsoft.

1541
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:57,000
I think someone else, I think someone we don't know about yet, is going to come in and challenge

1542
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:03,960
Nintendo for the throne in 2008.

1543
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:10,840
You know what, and a lot of folks in the chat room are insinuating it might be Sega, maybe.

1544
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:14,640
I don't know, I don't know, I mean their games have not been, but I don't know.

1545
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:17,920
Because Sega and Nintendo have been kind of working together, you know, and Sega also

1546
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,840
have tried handheld and they failed, so I don't know.

1547
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:25,120
I don't say no, but I don't think it would be Sega, but I think somebody, I don't think

1548
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,000
it's going to be someone that's known for gaming.

1549
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,380
I think it's going to be somebody that's known for electronics.

1550
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:33,300
It's going to try and get in here, kind of like what Sony did when they got into the

1551
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:34,300
gaming market.

1552
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:37,600
I think somebody who is known for electronics now is going to try to challenge Nintendo

1553
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,800
for the gaming throne, but we'll see.

1554
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,380
For handheld gaming.

1555
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:46,080
I think the Wii colors will come out finally this year, and I think they'll come out just

1556
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:49,000
in time for the holiday season, and you're going to get the Wiis in the different colors

1557
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:54,540
finally, and I think something will happen to address the storage issues on the Wii.

1558
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:59,540
I think, I don't know if the color systems are going to necessarily come with more on-board

1559
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:03,640
memory, I have a feeling they will, but it's not going to be a major increase, just a slight

1560
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:04,640
one.

1561
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:05,640
Like what do they have now, 512 megs?

1562
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:06,640
Yeah, 512.

1563
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:11,980
I say they up the internal memory to 2 gigs, but there will be a firmware that will improve

1564
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:12,980
the SD card support.

1565
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:20,020
I can see that because with the price of flash ram, I mean, it's going to, it gets cheaper

1566
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:23,580
every day, so I wouldn't see why they wouldn't do that.

1567
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:29,100
I can also see on the DS with the on-board storage for downloadable games, virtual console

1568
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:32,300
for the DS, so to speak, I guess.

1569
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:38,300
I can see something definitely like that, I'm trying to think what else would be, PlayStation

1570
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:45,260
redesign, I can see that, might even see a 360 redesign, especially if they get it cooler

1571
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:48,420
and stuff.

1572
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:51,800
And let's see, I don't want to take this on too much longer with just predictions I'm

1573
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:55,540
pulling out of my ass, but just, you know, I think there's a possibility some of these

1574
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:56,540
things will happen.

1575
01:24:56,540 --> 01:25:02,900
I think Nintendo, I think the big Christmas game they're going to reveal, I think Animal

1576
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:07,040
Crossing is going to be their big winner game, and I think it is going to be an MMO, and

1577
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,500
it is going to be a bit MySpace-y.

1578
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:13,860
I think there is going to be a social element to it that no other game is really done yet.

1579
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:16,540
I think that's going to be their big winner game.

1580
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:21,420
But I also think this will be the year that Kid Icarus is finally revived.

1581
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:22,420
I don't know.

1582
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:23,420
Call it my gut.

1583
01:25:23,420 --> 01:25:26,220
And Guardian Legend finally comes to Virtual Console and we all collectively orgasm.

1584
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:29,220
I can see them coming out with some more peripherals for the system.

1585
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:30,220
They've got to.

1586
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:32,700
I mean, what, the nunchuck and, you know, classic controller?

1587
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:35,880
I mean, come on, you guys, seriously.

1588
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:40,420
I want to fucking redesign the damn remote to, or make a gun thing.

1589
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:43,780
I'm surprised someone hasn't hacked the remote yet to figure out how to get, you know, key

1590
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:49,040
presses from there, because through that one port there to remove, like, the B button back

1591
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:53,060
to where Trigger is, like the actual Zapper gun, because apparently that probably could

1592
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:54,060
have been done.

1593
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:55,740
I don't know.

1594
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:56,740
But...

1595
01:25:56,740 --> 01:26:00,420
And not to leave Microsoft out, I'm going to make a bold prediction for them.

1596
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:04,420
I say because this latest update has shown that they can do buffering video and they

1597
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:08,740
can do it very well, like if you watch the Inside Xbox stuff, that all works out very

1598
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:09,740
well.

1599
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:13,900
I think Microsoft is going to make a Web 2.0 move this year and I think you're going to

1600
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:18,100
see something YouTubey come to the Xbox 360.

1601
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:21,380
And it's going to be the reason to get a camera if you don't already have one.

1602
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:25,220
I think something YouTubey is going to happen on Xbox 360 in either the spring or the fall

1603
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:26,220
update.

1604
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:29,220
So, we'll see.

1605
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:30,980
All right.

1606
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:34,220
So those are our bold 2008 predictions.

1607
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:38,220
And there's one more thing we could not do a show without.

1608
01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:41,980
It just would not be a show if we did not do the FUs of the week.

1609
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:46,980
But this week it's very special because these are the FUs of the year.

1610
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:50,220
So these are the things that have pissed us off the most above anything else the entire

1611
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:51,220
year.

1612
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:54,940
Dark Soccer, I want you to start us off tonight with the FUs of the year.

1613
01:26:54,940 --> 01:27:15,860
I guess my FU of the year is going to go towards the city of Citrus Heights for the crap they're

1614
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:21,420
doing regarding massage therapist business licenses just because that completely interferes

1615
01:27:21,420 --> 01:27:26,260
with a year's worth of hard work I've put into making my business happen.

1616
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:29,260
So fuck you.

1617
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:30,260
All right.

1618
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:31,900
Loki, your FU of the year.

1619
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:35,680
I don't have anything that's like really all consuming for the entire year.

1620
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:40,940
But for this week at least, FU at Nvidia and your crappy graphics drivers because for whatever

1621
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:46,180
reason whenever I reboot my computer, not only does it not save my settings to what

1622
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:52,540
screen resolution I have, if it did for whatever reason actually boot up in my desired resolution,

1623
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:57,860
it flashes black and then back to the picture and blacks out again and constantly does that

1624
01:27:57,860 --> 01:28:03,540
until I change the graphics to a different aspect ratio and then change it back.

1625
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:07,380
It's fucking annoying.

1626
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:15,260
And my FU of the year goes to bugs because bugs suck, especially flies that fly around

1627
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:18,180
in the room when you're trying to do a show.

1628
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:19,700
All right.

1629
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:24,700
That's going to do it unless there's any last minute things anybody wants to say.

1630
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:25,700
Sure.

1631
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:26,700
Who knew?

1632
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:27,700
All right, Loki.

1633
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:31,940
In case you didn't catch that earlier when I was talking about it, No More Heroes has

1634
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:35,880
moved up to January or at least the end of January, so it's moved up a week.

1635
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:39,500
So hooray, get to play the game even sooner in the United States.

1636
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:43,500
Apparently there's a thing going around right now where some of the nunchucks that Nintendo

1637
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:49,220
has put out recently, I don't know if it's the coloring or something, but they're becoming

1638
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:51,780
discolored like pink.

1639
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:53,360
That's kind of funny.

1640
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:56,660
So they're less manly.

1641
01:28:56,660 --> 01:28:59,180
And then I don't know if anyone saw this.

1642
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:03,420
Apparently there is a company called PEGA and they're releasing yet another gun peripheral

1643
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:05,100
for the Wii.

1644
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:08,380
This one, though, is shaped like a shark.

1645
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:11,180
It's called the Shark Gun.

1646
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:16,740
In fact, they were actually, they had a whole press release for this thing.

1647
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:18,220
It was hilarious.

1648
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:25,220
They had something, was it, during the gun fighting game, use the Wii remote, nunchuck,

1649
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:30,040
and shark gun together, holding the handle of the shark gun and poking the trigger with

1650
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:32,060
your forefinger to shoot.

1651
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:38,900
We'll bring you a you are there feeling.

1652
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:44,060
But it's funny though because they have military guys on the cover shooting guns and stuff,

1653
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:45,740
although they're not the shark gun.

1654
01:29:45,740 --> 01:29:50,260
So it'd be funny if the military had shark guns.

1655
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:51,260
All right, that's enough news.

1656
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:52,340
It can wait until next week.

1657
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:56,660
Next week on Orange Lounge Radio, we're back to our classic format.

1658
01:29:56,660 --> 01:29:59,260
All three of us will be discussing the latest and greatest in gaming news.

1659
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:03,540
Of course, your call's on Skype as always, and who knows who might put us on hold next

1660
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:04,540
week.

1661
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:05,540
We'll see.

1662
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:06,540
Wait, wait, wait.

1663
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:07,540
I got one more thing on the Shark Gun.

1664
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:08,540
God damn it.

1665
01:30:08,540 --> 01:30:09,540
Sorry, this is funny.

1666
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:10,540
It's one of the features on there.

1667
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:13,340
With lively appearance and smooth lines, Shark Gun makes you feel comfortable and gives you

1668
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:18,880
a strong sense of shark-like invincible force.

1669
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:19,880
That isn't a new name.

1670
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:20,880
I don't know what is.

1671
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:25,860
Let's get around, go around and get everybody's final thoughts until next year.

1672
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:28,700
I'll start off because I was going last for most of the other stuff.

1673
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:33,020
So my final thought is I want more penguins.

1674
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:34,780
I want a real one to live in the garage.

1675
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:35,780
That's what I want.

1676
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:38,260
DarkSakara, what's your final thought?

1677
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:40,300
I want money.

1678
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:41,300
Give me.

1679
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:42,300
Money is good.

1680
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:43,300
Loki, your final thought?

1681
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:48,100
My prediction for 2008, Dusk Cap 4.

1682
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:49,580
I have one more actually.

1683
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:50,580
Oh, yes.

1684
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:51,580
Reject false icons.

1685
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:54,900
It's been a while since we've had a good, hearty reject false icons.

1686
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:55,900
It's good.

1687
01:30:55,900 --> 01:31:02,140
All right, for myself, DarkSakara and Loki, everybody please have a happy and very safe

1688
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:04,580
New Year's Eve, New Year's Day.

1689
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:08,900
Please don't drink and drive because if you do, you're retarded.

1690
01:31:08,900 --> 01:31:09,900
That's really it.

1691
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:15,180
We'll see you guys in 2008 for our sixth year of broadcasting, if you can believe it.

1692
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:18,020
We'll be back next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1693
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:21,020
