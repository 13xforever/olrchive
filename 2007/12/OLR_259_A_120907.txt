Tonight, December 9th, 2007, new details emerge on Street Fighter IV.
Nintendo gets a ninja party next year, and has GameTap started removing games?
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that gaming show, podcast, blogcast, Zoomcast, whatever you're into, thing dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
My name is Rob Roberts.
Welcome back to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Hi.
How are you doing, Jamie?
I'm almost full.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Good times.
I went to Alabama with Sauce, and we stayed at my grandmom's house and ate a lot of Blue Bell ice cream and watched a bunch of movies and had Cracker Barrel and Waffle House.
Sounds very Jamie.
It was very delicious.
It was a very Jamie experience.
I had a delicious time.
Excellent.
All right, say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.
Hello.
How are you doing, Loki?
Fine.
How are you enjoying the new studio, by the way?
It's great.
It's big.
Yes, it's much more spacious than before.
It even comes complete with a washer and dryer that you can't see on the camera.
Yes, for when I piss myself with joy.
I can just clean my clothes right there.
That's awesome.
Or, you know, when we have the, as somebody said earlier, on the cam, we covered a ladder with one of the blankets there to make it look a little better.
And somebody said something about we could use the ladder in having ladder matches during the show.
And I was saying, oh, we have, you know, cage matches and
Bra and Panties matches, and Whipped Cream and Bananas matches.
Anyway, say hello as well to the one and only Puppy is here tonight.
How are you doing, Puppy?
I'm worn out from school and work, but I'm getting by.
And I'm playing lots of Rock Band, and my right leg is cramping.
Now hold on, don't spoil your gaming weeks just yet.
See, you're angsty that your right leg is cramping so much.
All sorts of errors tonight in the brand new studio.
Do you like our new digs?
It's much more spacious than that previous box.
This is much more spacious than the previous box.
Although Loki still has the same table that wobbles.
I think as somebody said... I used to have the overturned laundry basket.
Now I have the wobbly table.
I'm moving up in life.
Independent radio at its finest.
Somebody was saying earlier when I was doing the test earlier today and somebody was watching said all I need is a little mini bar back there and we would truly be an orange lounge.
It would be fun.
DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?
How was your gaming week?
Well, I played a lot of Ragnarok now that I have internet again.
I missed it.
I have a character at level 97 now, and that was really awesome.
And while I was in Alabama, I didn't play crap, except on the airplane where I tried to play some Oendan, and totally irritated this guy sitting next to me.
It was fantastic.
That's great.
I did that when I still had it when I was in classes.
In between breaks, I'd start playing it, and people would look at me like, what the hell is that tapping noise you're doing?
I had my headphones on, and he was just looking at me like, oh, but on the way back, this is cool.
When I got on the little dinky tiny plane, no, I take that back.
It was when I got on the bigger plane coming out of Dallas.
These guys were sitting behind me like, oh, well, don't mind us.
You know, we're just about, you know, we're nerds, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
I was like, okay.
And then for some reason, we started talking about Half-Life.
I can't play Half-Life, but I was like, yeah, I'm going to get Portal anyway, but I'm going to be so motion sick.
They're like, you get motion sick and you're on an airplane?
I was like, only video games make me motion sick.
That and riding in the backseat of a car will do it sometimes.
Or riding in Kristen's car on Highway 1.
So yeah, that was my gaming week.
We have a Black Knight pinball in our house now.
Not a Black Knight 2000.
We are housing somebody's Black Knight.
What does that mean?
You're borrowing?
We're providing them storage space.
Okay.
In exchange for massive amounts of playing it.
Alrighty.
Well, let's go over to the one and only Loki.
How was your gaming week, Loki?
Not as filled as I thought it would be, unfortunately.
I planned to play a lot of things and never got around to it.
But I played more Zelda fandom, Hourglass, almost done with that.
See, the thing with Zelda games is, like, when you finish them, you don't want to play them again.
It's like, you're done.
Anyways, um... I don't know about that.
I challenge that statement, because I can still go back and play the old Super Nintendo one.
And I think of the old school NES ones I still love, too.
Yeah, true, like the Super Nintendo ones and stuff.
I think this game is a little bit shorter.
I mean, it seemed to be really short, versus, you know... Maybe you're just that good.
No, the game is really fucking easy.
It's, like, stupid easy.
Um...
I don't know, it's just, it's okay, I guess.
Saints Row, I actually went back and started playing the single player stuff.
Not really, now, I haven't really been playing the single player stuff.
I've been playing single player, but I've been blowing up this armored car over and over and over again.
Because there's a trick where you can keep getting more money, because I'm trying to get the achievement for a million dollars.
And so I keep doing that.
But it's entertaining nonetheless because you're blowing up cars over and over.
Achievement whore.
But we've been switching up at work instead of all rocket matches now.
Now we're doing shotguns, pimp slap, and grenades in the meter made cars.
It's hilarious because those things... That sounds like a party.
Pimp slaps and grenades in the meter made cars.
But you don't understand.
That's like a band name.
See, Saints Row, the pimp slap is like a one hit kill.
You just smack somebody and it launches them across the entire arena.
It's actually pretty fun.
Um...
DanSenseRevolutionUniverse2 DanSenseRevolutionUniverse2
It's fucking DDR.
It's exactly the same as Universe 1 to me.
They've changed a few things.
The quest mode, you're no longer moving around the United States and the world and stuff.
Now there's fictional DDR island shit.
I don't know.
But is it broken still like the first quest mode was or did they actually kind of fix that?
I would say it's 80% broken still, instead of 100% broken as before.
The song list is okay.
I still hate the fact that I have to play through quest mode in order to unlock songs.
I find that very annoying.
But, I mean, it's okay.
It's DDR.
Luckily, I didn't have to buy it, so that's good, because right now the only way they're selling it is with the dance pad, and you have to pay lots of money for that.
If you're interested in picking it up, it is coming out in January, game by itself.
And about the same time we'll be getting a DDR Disney Channel edition, which is probably going to be crap, but that's okay.
But high school musical songs to DDR too.
Okay, yeah, lame.
Let's see, what else did I play this week?
I think that's about it, because really I haven't had a chance to play a lot of stuff.
In fact, I bought two games yesterday and I haven't even unwrapped them yet.
I've got Contra 4 and Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings for when I finish Zelda, which will be very soon.
I don't know, all the extra stuff in Zelda, like all the hidden islands and stuff, they have an island that looks like a DS, and I was like, oh, that's kind of funny.
That was about the extent of my interest in that.
And then there's another island that you can find treasure.
I don't know, it's really kind of lame.
It's not like Wind Waker was, where it kind of felt like Mega Man Legends to me a little bit, where there's a lot of exploring, a ton of different dungeons and stuff.
This game, I don't know, it's just kind of really scaled down and made it a hell of a lot easier.
I have to go back and play Wind Waker again, because I never did finish that game.
And then maybe eventually I'll warm up to playing Twilight Princess, but... I don't know, I just don't like it.
Alright, fine.
Alright, then my gaming week.
There was some new stuff I finally got to play this week, as opposed to the same old MMOs.
I actually didn't play the MMOs so much this week.
I actually checked out some new stuff, including the Orange Box, finally, which is magnificent.
There's several different games in there.
I haven't even gotten to touch Team Fortress 2 yet, but I've been playing some of the other games in there.
Half-Life, which...
To be honest, I know it's a critically acclaimed game and everything, but I just never really got the chance to play it before, so this is really the first chance I'm getting to play Half-Life.
Half-Life 2, I mean, of course.
It's kind of cool.
It's very immersive.
And of course, Portal.
I've been playing a lot of Portal.
Moving through the game rather quickly, I guess the game really isn't that long, per se, but be damned if it isn't pretty funny and pretty innovative.
It's a great kind of, like, it's a puzzle game in first person.
Like, it's not a first person shooter, it's a first person puzzler.
I don't know what else to call it.
It's pretty cool.
I swear to God, though, that whole thing where you have to, like...
Fire a portal on the ground, and then fire the other half up on the ceiling, and then fall from the ceiling to the one on the ground to get enough inertia.
That thing drove me frickin' nuts for like, I was trying to do that for like an hour.
It was so difficult, but I finally got through that.
Let's see, also, the other game I've been playing is Geometry Wars Galaxies I picked up on the Nintendo Wii, and I'm having quite a bit of fun with Geometry Wars Galaxies.
It's a pretty good time.
It's a lot different than just the game on the Xbox.
I actually kind of enjoyed the control scheme.
And plus, if for whatever reason you don't like that control scheme, you can do the classic controller, which is great.
Classic controller doesn't feel quite as nice as the Xbox 360 controller did, and I think it's because the directionals are a little more grooved on the Wii, whereas the Xbox 360 has the full 360 degrees of movement a little bit.
So I think that it doesn't have quite the same feel with the classic controller, but it's nice.
My only minor complaints about the game is that, A, it looks better on the 360, obviously.
I mean, you can tell there's some graphical dumbing down that had to be done for the Wii.
But it doesn't look bad.
I mean, it is Geometry Wars.
You're not going to expect, you know, the world's best looking game, you know, when you're looking at that.
and then also the other only kind of minor complaint I have is that it's kind of cool that you progress through these different levels and you unlock new planets and you unlock new power-ups because the other kind of thing that you have in Geometry Wars Galaxy is you have a little droid that follows you and you can tell the droid what to do.
You can buy an attack mode or buy a defend and as you play more levels, the droid levels up with you.
It's kind of cool, so it gets a little smarter.
But the only thing is that there's really no...
and so on.
That was my only minor complaint, but overall, I think the game's great.
You don't need cutscenes in Geometry Wars?
I don't mean, like, you have to, like, have these grand, like, cutscenes, but, like, give me a reason for kind of, like, unlocking all these things.
Or, you know, just a little bit of a story wouldn't hurt.
You know what I mean?
What they need to do is take Geometry Wars out of, like, just the normal, like, asteroid kind of stuff and make it into, like, a shoot-'em-up game.
Like Grideus or something like that.
That would be fun.
Yeah, it might be fun.
The other cool thing about Geometry Wars I thought was really cool is that you can download the demo of... Well, it's not really the demo of Galaxies to your DS.
It's just basically retro evolved.
You can download to your DS from the Wii, which is kind of cool.
But I do not like the way the DS controls at all.
So I don't really want the game on DS.
Because you use the stylus on the bottom to control your firing and it just...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
A ton, ever since I got it.
I had to switch back to my Guitar Hero 3 controller because the strum bar on my Rock Band controller died, and I sent out for the warranty on that, and it actually came back already.
It only took three days for me to get the replacement, and I sent the other one back.
And then...
Other than that, I got Gamefly, so I've been renting games lately.
I wanted to rent Mass Effect, Call of Duty 4, Orange Box, and I guess I put Dead Rising on my list a long time ago and forgot about it.
And they ended up sending me that instead.
I played it for a total of an hour and a half and sent it back.
I could not stand that game for some reason.
It was just terrible.
I thought it was great because you could hit zombies with a scythe or a lawnmower.
Well that was entertaining but the story could have been cooler but the way they've got the game set up you can only save it once and if you die you have to go back very far and reload a bunch of crap.
I just got sick of it very quickly and I would not have played through the entire game.
Is that it?
Um...
Rock Band, Dead Rising, not playing Halo again until the maps come out next week.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
I'll just have to get something to split that signal.
So, but, yeah, Jamie and Loki's computers run fine on the wireless network.
I don't know what that is.
But then again, they're not trying to broadcast a radio program from that.
So I apologize, chat room, if Live365's going up and down.
We'll just kind of have to deal with it tonight and then next week we'll fix that.
But now we know.
Which is weird because I ran Live365 and Op11 at the same time for 40 minutes earlier today and everything was fine.
But now, of course, we're having a plethora of problems.
Just my luck.
And people will continuously bitch about it.
I...
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Anyhow, I was going to say, I was going to talk about one more thing that I played this week.
Well, alright.
And I'm not sure, I can't remember if we're getting into this later on or not, but anyways, there's like an independent games festival thing kind of going on right now that they've got some of the finalists for.
I think the awards come up later in our show.
Yeah, the awards.
The 10th Annual Independent Games Festival.
Anyways, I was playing some of the finalists for that.
And one of the games they played, Clean Asia, which, you know, I'm a huge fan of Warning Forever and stuff like that.
Very similar style game.
Very cool shoot-em-up.
You gotta try that.
Also, Cran Physics is another funny one.
But they've got some other stuff in there as well, including a game that I talked about before.
What was it?
Uh,
Let's see here.
Fret Nice was another one of the nominees, which is a pretty fun game to play on the PC with the Guitar Hero controller.
All right.
Well, tell us more about that when we get to that part of the show.
Will do.
All right.
Rob, I have a question about your gaming week.
Sure.
Did you make it past that part in Portal?
I sure did.
I got to the next level in Portal.
I was venting with Jamie my frustration at the robots that shoot you a bunch and then you die.
I was having a hard time getting through that portion.
And then Jamie said, you have to shoot the ceiling.
I felt bad for Rob
I watched the walkthrough like a bajillion times just because I thought it was funny.
And so I had to help.
That's right.
So now I'm to the next stage in Portal and I just kind of quit for the night because I wanted to play some other stuff so I had new things to talk about tonight.
Anyhow, a little bit of housekeeping.
I guess I already talked about kind of the parts about the new studio and unfortunately the effect it's having on us tonight with the whole live stream cutting in and out.
Sorry about that.
But we'll hopefully fix that within the next couple weeks.
Are we doing a show December 23rd?
I don't think we talked about that.
It's the Christmas week.
I'll be here for Christmas.
I should be available.
Yeah, I think I'll probably be here too.
But I have to work Monday.
And of course we have our year-end show coming.
You have to work on Christmas Eve?
Yeah.
Sorry about that.
Well, I work for, you know, freaking tyrants, so it's okay.
We'll be having our year-end special probably on December 30th, and I'm hoping that we get some guests on the program like we did last year, but more on that in the next couple weeks.
Let's get to the gaming news.
Enough about the housekeeping stuff.
Let's start off Loki tonight.
Anyways, I just wanted to comment one thing on the chat room.
Everyone's talking about the weighted companion cube and stuff.
No one ever mentions the weighted companion sphere that happens to be in challenge mode of the game.
No love for the sphere, I guess.
What's the difference between the sphere and the cube?
One's round and one's cube.
Does the computer call it the weighted companion sphere?
I don't know.
I think all that stuff's still the same, but it's just harder because you can't just drop it and it will roll.
Oh, that's right, and you can't jump on top of it as easy because it'll roll.
Okay, I get it.
I'm like, duh, I know one's a sphere and a cube, dumbass.
I'm like, what is the effect that that has?
Okay, I get it.
And no, the sphere does not have any hearts on it.
Aw, sadness.
So it doesn't really like you.
It's just pretending.
Well, then we'll throw that thing in the incinerator like that.
Anyways, this week, Rockstar happened to throw out on the internet a brand new trailer for Grand Theft Auto 4.
It's fucking fantastic.
It's called Move Up, Ladies.
It's basically what's really important about this trailer, though, compared to the last one, which came out about six months ago.
is it looks a lot better than, you know, the game has really progressed.
But it did show kind of a lot of the detail that they're adding there, including, you know, gunfights and all the stuff that you expect from Grand Theft Auto.
But there's a bunch of new screenshots and stuff.
I have to say the game is coming along very well.
Looks awesome.
And I think a lot of people that were kind of hesitating about the game before saying, oh, this is just going to be crap, are really on board with it.
But
If you want to check it out, it's pretty much everywhere.
All the major sites, Xbox Live, PlayStation Network.
You can definitely find it at the download.
Alrighty.
So, does it actually show more than just the cutscenes?
Do you actually see what the game is?
All the cutscenes are with the in-game engine.
So, I mean, you essentially see what the game looks like.
One of the characters that they showed also was...
I just can't wait for the game to come out.
I hope it comes out actually in April, like it's supposed to.
I thought they discontinued the AIBO.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Like it does in Sony's home, which should be kind of interesting.
So apparently you're going to be able to download new personalities for the AIBO from PlayStation Network and you're going to be able to use the PSP with it over Wi-Fi.
The little camera in the dog's head will actually also show on your PSP screen.
So what you could actually do is you could move your dog around and put it right under Lady's skirts and then use the PSP as an upskirt cam.
Sweet.
So when girls go, oh, what a cute fake doggy.
That's probably the reasoning why they put it in Stuff Magazine to begin with.
Possibly.
Possibly.
I wanted to get one so I can play with my cat.
Because my cat's kind of getting lonely and she's causing a lot of trouble.
And I figured this would be a perfect way to spend a couple thousand dollars is to get a thing to play with my cat.
Then I could also watch it at work and watch what my cat's doing.
Now here's my favorite part is that Stuff Magazine rates this rumor at a 53% possibility.
Where the fuck do you get a number like that?
Like 53, like it makes it sound like there's this real scientific process that rumors go through over at Stuff Magazine in order to get a rating.
So it's like, you know, they put it in their big super predicting computer.
Here's a little note.
This has a 53% probability of being true.
This is about as official as the If They Mated segment of Conan.
Okay.
We'll see.
I don't know.
I kind of call BS.
I think there may be like a little something with the AIBO, but I don't know.
Upskirt cams?
I don't know about that.
We don't need to be giving Sony any ideas.
I want an AIBO, Rob.
Okay.
Well, save up your money and then you can buy one.
I've wanted an AIBO for a very long time.
I have a LiveJournal icon that's an AIBO.
I want a pony.
You know what?
What?
You'd be more likely to get a pony than I'd be to get an AIBO.
AIBO judgment.
They should make the eye pony.
I was watching a special on robotics last night and they were bringing up the eye bow.
But it was these lifelike robot people thing that could interview people and repeat back your question and follow you and do all this stuff.
I was like, yet the eye bow didn't sell better.
Eye paparazzi?
It was called like the respond cue or something.
It was really weird.
It was at one of the Tokyo robotics shows I was watching.
Anyway.
Okay.
For anyone who is interested in Devil May Cry 4, which I know I am because I really, really, really, really, really, really like Devil May Cry, except why the hell are they giving Dante a beard?
The demo is going to be out in early 2008, according to Capcom, for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
There will be a PC version, but no word on if we're getting a demo of that.
The demo is supposed to be different levels in the game instead of just, oh, here's the start of the game, bye.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
We've secretly replaced Shermie with an eyeball.
My cat's so retarded, she still thinks that the mirror is another cat, so, you know.
I was watching on YouTube last night, though, along with the robotic stuff, I was also watching cats talking to people, you know, that could imitate human talk, and Shermie was going crazy.
She was running into the desk.
She's like, it's unnatural!
And then she legitimately... What in God's name is going on over there?
That's what it sounded like, actually.
Wow.
You don't understand.
We're kind of crazy with our cat.
We'll make her talk, and we'll have conversations with her, but she can't talk.
And I don't know why the hell we do that.
And she has a really high-pitched voice somehow.
I don't know.
It's weird.
One of the videos I was watching last night, it just sounded like the cat was actually just saying, Hello!
Hello!
Like that.
And I was like, okay.
And then another one was a cat sleeping in a sink.
Is this where Lolcats is going in 2008?
I think so.
Wow.
Okay, let's move on.
Anyways, so yes, one of the unfortunate things with the PlayStation 3 version of Rockbin was that you couldn't use your Guitar Hero 3 controller with it.
Well, now that's going to be fixed, and there is going to be a patch that's going to be coming where you'll be able to download it, and it will allow it to play.
Hooray!
Hooray!
That's kind of funny, though, is they had another story that came out earlier this week.
Some guy, RedOctane, was actually making fun of Rock Band and their guitar controllers and saying how they're never going to make those controllers compatible with Guitar Hero 3 because they think their controllers are crap.
Way to take the high road, RedOctane.
Hey, it doesn't matter that our...
and Sumers or anything might want it a little bit easier so they don't have to buy more of your crappy controllers.
Sure, let's just go ahead and, like, piss on them.
Hooray.
I do like, though, that they're at least patching to, you know, at least somebody's giving in a little bit and patching so the guitars work universally.
I mean, you know.
Exactly, they should.
I don't understand why they lock it out of other games.
It's just fucking lazy.
Actually, it's just fucking mean is what it is.
Jonathan F. in our chat room has a good point that I don't believe we're covering elsewhere on our show tonight.
He says, speaking of patches, Guitar Hero Wii discs will be replaced in 2008 to fix the mono sound problem.
Did you hear about that?
Yeah.
So they're going to remaster the discs or whatever, and they'll be available in 2008, new discs.
But how many people do you think will actually do that?
I bet most Wii owners probably wouldn't even think to do it.
There might be a few.
Well, we need to spread the word.
Make it financially...
Sucky for them.
Well, there you have it.
If you own Guitar Hero on the Wii, then be sure in 2008 you request your... And even if you don't care, just get a new one anyway.
It's just because newer is better.
That's what you need to remember.
Newer is better.
That's right.
Newer is better.
Moving on, we're talking about the PlayStation a little bit.
And on the PlayStation Network, it has been released this week a brand new bowling game.
High Velocity Bowling is $10.
Also added to the PlayStation Network, some new stuff for the game Folklore, and of course, Rock Band downloadable content.
Also, Wild Arms is now available for download on the old school PlayStation Games line.
Yay!
So, I don't know, it's certainly not Wii Bowling, but it kind of looks, you know...
Looks a little urban.
You play a guy with tattoos.
You actually use a 6-axis controller.
Yeah, I was kind of curious about that.
Yeah, we're going to have people throw... See, though, I don't know this one would be making holes in TVs and stuff, because it's kind of rounded and a little bit light, whereas when you kind of huck the remote, it's kind of like a javelin type thing.
Just get the nerf thing for it.
That's what you do.
Yeah, just get the nerf thing for it.
Well...
And other news for our PlayStation 3 owners, which at Best Buy, that was freaking sad.
Oh, yes.
Jamie and I went to Best Buy earlier this week, and we were shopping.
We were just kind of going around.
Sad.
That's when I bought Geometry Wars Galaxies.
Yes.
I was thinking about getting Trauma Center, and I ended up getting the cheaper games.
And I bought Super Breakout for the Atari 5200 that night.
But that was later.
But I already owned two copies of it.
Why did you buy a third, dummy?
I thought that we didn't have it, and then it occurred to me when we got home that freaking Super Breakout was the game that came with the Atari 5200.
But I have a manual now, and that's good.
All right.
Well, anyhow, as I say, at Best Buy, we were there, and, you know, there were big stacks of PlayStation 3s, like, all over the store.
Like, not just one stack, but, like, at least four stacks of PlayStation 3s.
There were easily, what, 50 systems just sitting out, unloved?
And we were kind of, you know, we were talking to the guy, because the guy was helping me look up Geometry Wars Galaxies, because for whatever reason, they didn't have any out on the floor.
They were all in the cage.
So I was asking him if they had it and everything.
Metal Gear Solid 4 Geriatric Snake
We'll see.
Anyway.
Nobody likes a geriatric snake.
Or GZDr4F says Unreal Tournament 3 will sell the PlayStation 3 units.
No, it won't.
It will sell some.
It will sell some.
There's fanboys for everything.
Well, you know, maybe when they put out Jumping Flash 3.
But anyway.
For the 2.0 PS3 firmware update...
There is... It was actually included that there were custom soundtracks for High Velocity Bowling.
Okay, who's playing High Velocity Bowling?
Well, I don't know whoever downloaded it this week.
Who knows?
But it also has an in-game friends list for the demo for Time Shift.
So it looks like that more games, hopefully, are going to be incorporating that type of thing, like a...
Who's Online, that kind of thing.
So, unfortunately though, it's not going to be centralized.
It'll be up to the game people to put it in their games.
Yeah.
I mean, they're not getting it.
I don't think they...
Microsoft's already figured it out.
They'll implement it when they feel like it.
I guess that's true.
At least they don't charge, and if you want to play games on Xbox Live, you've got to pay.
They don't charge, and it shows.
Well, anyway.
Anyways.
However, retailers are charging for games, and here's what's coming out this week.
Not a whole lot, and it's a lot of leftovers, actually.
Anyways, BlackSate Area 51 is finally making its way out on the PlayStation 3.
Way to be on top of things midway.
Go Unreal Tournament 3 engine!
Or Unreal Engine 3, whatever.
Speaking of Unreal, Unreal Tournament 3 is coming out this week on PS3 as well.
Universe at War, Earth Assault on the PC.
Warriors of the Lost Empire on PSP.
Let's see here.
NCAA March Madness 2008, coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and 360.
Luxor 2 on the DS, hooray.
Let's see here, Super Swing Golf Season 2, that's going to be coming out, in case you liked the last one.
I don't know how many people are getting this.
Madden NFL 08 Español!
The Spanish version.
Hey, you know what?
It makes the game appealing to an audience that maybe wasn't able to get into it before, you know?
Exactly.
Now with more luchadors.
Unfortunately, that's not true.
The luchadors are great.
Is that it?
Let's see.
No, that's not it.
The Golden Compass on PC.
Oh, goody!
I'm so glad we have that.
Showtime Boxing on the Wii.
and... and that's it.
Nintendo Wii, Chocobos Dungeon, Tokiwasure no Meikyuu, Knights,
Journey of Dreams or as they call it in Japan Nights Hoshifuru Yoru no Monogatari is coming out this week
Shanghai comes out.
I don't know if that's a redone version of the old Mahjong game, but I don't know.
That comes out on the Nintendo Wii.
I somehow doubt that.
Soul Calibur Legends also makes its way to the Nintendo Wii.
Another version of the Castle of Shikigami 3.
And We Love Golf also comes out on the Nintendo Wii.
That's coming over here in February, I believe.
Is it?
The Capcom one.
Also coming out on other systems, we have the PlayStation 2 gets Hakarina Heart comes out as well as Spectral Gene.
And that's all the PS2 gets this week.
And coming out on the Nintendo DS, Fujinomori no Let's Tarot is coming out.
What?
I wonder if that's a tarot card game.
I don't know.
And Kurukuru Princess, Yumi no White Quartet comes out.
I need to put up that picture I took of you at Best Buy.
Oh, with Imagine Babies?
Yeah, we've got Imagine Babies.
Very interesting game.
Yes, Fujinomori No Let's Tarot does look to be a tarot card game for the DS.
That sounds like fun.
Jamie wants.
And Shanghai is indeed a version of the old Mahjong classic on the Nintendo Wii.
It is indeed that.
So, there you have it, your Japanese release dates.
Well, for our friends in the UK, not a whole bunch is coming out.
On the 14th is Beowulf.
Excuse me.
Half-Life 2 Episode 2, Portal, Team Fortress 2, The Orange Box Wait, didn't I already do these?
You know it says December.
I'm like, okay, it's being all bizarre.
Yeah, Beowulf, Half-Life 2 Episode 2, Portal, Team Fortress 2, and then The Orange Box.
They are releasing them separately.
Time Shift and Wipeout Pulse.
And of course all of the Half-Life related things were on PlayStation 3.
Alright, kind of a slow week over in the UK.
Yep.
Oh well.
Maybe it'll get a little more busy before the end of the year.
Or at least early next year when they start getting all the stuff that we got this year.
Poor guys over there.
I will be more than happy to send gifts overseas if people send me... Money!
...boos.
Alright.
I want Christmas crackers.
Let's get back into the gaming news.
Anyways, it's another week, so that means there must be another Korean MMO coming.
And this time, it's going to be a game called Perfect KO.
It's actually a fighting game MMO, and it's got an unlikely duo of characters that are going to be making their way to it.
And those two characters, of course, would be Ken and Chung-Li from the Street Fighter series.
It actually looks kind of neat.
It's sort of like a 3D brawl game or something like that.
and then of course as you beat up more people you can customize your avatar and that kind of fun stuff.
But that's kind of neat to see that they're actually licensing characters from Capcom.
Hopefully they'll license characters from some other things.
That's going to be interesting.
What other kind of characters are in this game besides Ken and Tony?
They didn't really mention.
It's a lot of stuff that they've designed themselves but the character designs are really cool.
So, you know...
It'd be nice to see, like, some of these characters from this Korean game, like, move over to, say, like, Street Fighter 4 or something like that.
Well, speaking of Street Fighter 4, there were a lot of new details released this week.
First off, I've got to ask, though, did you hear about the drama going on behind the Street Fighter 4 news?
You know, this Brazilian news site put out these screenshots from Street Fighter 4, these new screenshots besides the one we'd seen previously.
They put out some new screenshots and, you know, one-up sick the lawyers on them, or Zip Davis would say sick the lawyers on them.
and people were like, you know, rah, rah, rah, the corporation's taking down the independent voice.
And certainly I was kind of going, you know, a little bit of that too.
I'm like, boy, those bastards, da, da, da.
But at the same time, it turns out, who knew that actually the leak came from the fact that the person that runs that website is some type of contractor for EGM in Brazil.
So he actually did steal internal information, I guess, ended up admitting to it.
So I don't know why he did that.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and EGM's not happy about it because this is how they were going to sell their magazines this week.
The game will actually run at 60 frames per second.
The storyline takes place between Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo and Street Fighter 3.
Lots of old school characters will return.
There's going to be two new female characters but no characters from Street Fighter 3.
So you kind of wonder if Capcom isn't just kind of writing off Street Fighter 3 in a way.
You should have brought like what was that guy's name Oro back but he can have both of his arms this time.
You know like
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
As most people speculated, the screenshots that you do see in the pictures floating around the internet right now is Chun-Li's new stage.
The parry system that was in Street Fighter 3, gone.
New system in place, it's called Saving Revenge, something like that, some new system is in place.
It's built around cancels, and there will be its own gauge that's separate from the super meter.
There are supers in the game, don't know if it's Street Fighter 3s or Super Street Fighter 2 turbos.
There's also ultras!
My god, there's lots of different types of moves.
Here's the other weird thing.
Shang Long may actually be in the game.
But there's kind of a may, and we don't know if that's just a running gag from EGM, because that was like one of their first April Fool's jokes, like years ago.
Back when I used to get that magazine delivered to my house, like 15 years ago.
Back when it was good.
Back in the day, certainly.
And rumor is we will see Street Fighter 4 in the arcades with online play, also in the PlayStation 3 and 360, all of them online.
Wouldn't it be cool if the console versions interfaced with the arcade somehow?
Of course, then you kind of wonder why would anybody go to the arcade, but community, and maybe there'll be something special with the arcade version.
If it did, it'd probably be only with the PlayStation 3 version, since you've got live, and live isn't cross-platform very easily.
Well, they got Final Fantasy XI to work somehow, so it's possible.
Yeah, but see, Final Fantasy XI runs off the Square Enix servers because you're connecting to PlayOnline.
That's totally separate.
That's why you have to pay that stupid monthly fee.
So anyways, obviously take some of that stuff with a grain of salt in regards to Shang Long and the online arcade stuff.
Take all that with a grain of salt.
But it does sound, as far as the rest of it, that it's pretty cemented.
The 60 frames a second and stuff.
It sounds like it's going to be a winner.
So I have to say I'm already a little more excited about Street Fighter 4 than I ever was about Street Fighter 3.
It looks pretty good.
I like the art style in it.
I was kind of crossing my fingers that it would be more like the trailer because that was really cool.
But the art style is okay.
I like what they're doing where it's 3D but it's 2D type thing.
Some of the facial animations though that they had, like some of the screenshots, a little weird.
It looks a little wonky, but I think you'll be fine.
Jamie, I know you've been a Street Fighter fan for ages and ages.
Are you happy about Street Fighter 4?
I'm reserving judgment until I actually play it.
Okay, so you're not letting the hype get to you at all?
Nope.
Fair enough.
I still think that it's only going to take a week before a bunch of fighting game fans completely break the system.
If it is online?
Oh, not just online.
I mean, just the game itself.
That's not dedicated there.
They'll break any fighting game system.
Figure out how to cheat real quick.
We'll see.
We will see.
Anyway, let's move on to some more news.
Well, for the Xbox Originals, they are, well, region locked.
You can't get past it.
Where the Japanese demos are working, the games themselves are not.
There's no such thing as can't.
That's what I say.
Just not now is what Loki is hoping for this.
But they got some extra games in Japan.
Well, not necessarily extra, but they got different games in Japan than we got here.
Here's the problem.
Go ahead.
Well, they actually tested, for example, with Magatama.
They said that they got a message that said the download was not available in your region.
Well, I think it's because it's either looking at one of two things.
It's either looking at the region of your console, which case, yeah, you're kind of screwed then.
Or it's looking at the region of your IP.
If that's the case, you could probably just route your IP through a mirror, say, somewhere overseas, and then it might work.
But I'm guessing it's looking at the region of your console, because that would make more sense.
But it's weird, though.
It just won't let you download it whatsoever.
Who cares?
It's a fucking Xbox game.
Seriously.
I mean, if you... I don't know.
It's an Xbox game.
Do you really need to download it?
It's old.
Please don't...
I don't know.
I'm noticing that because of the old Xbox games coming back, I've had a lot of friends tell me that Indigo Prophecy, kind of a game that may have been, I don't want to say overlooked, because it certainly had its fans, but overlooked by many, is kind of getting a little bit of a resurgence with this.
And I've had people actually send me messages on Xbox Live going, dude, you need to check out Indigo Prophecy if you haven't already played it before.
It's kind of fun.
Buy it in the stores, people.
It's probably cheaper than buying it online.
Seriously, and then you get the disc and maybe a manual.
I mean, instead of having to read a PDF file online, you know, just go look.
This stuff is so old, it's probably dirt cheap by now.
I guess there's one way to find out.
You've got to go out there and shop.
Oh, you want to hear something funny?
What is it?
Shut up.
Anyways...
Catamari Damacy, that game when it came out, that was like a $20 game, wasn't it?
The original one on PlayStation 2?
Yeah.
Yeah, it was a budget game, $20 game.
Somebody used a GameStop for $30.
I'm like, $10 over retail and it's used.
Right.
But that's because they don't make it retail anymore, right?
It doesn't matter, though.
It should still be cheap.
Well, what about, okay, what about, like, freaking old-ass PlayStation 1 games?
Like, for the longest time, Intelligent Cube, they were charging an arm and a leg for.
Symphony of the Night, before it was out on Xbox Live, they were charging... But I didn't think Katamari, the first one, had a really high demand for it.
And, like, Street Fighter, was it Marvel vs. Street Fighter 2?
That's going for, you know, quite a bit.
But... Or Marvel vs. Capcom 2.
But, um...
I didn't think Katamari was going to bring in demand of $10 over retail, especially used.
Well, let's go ahead and move on with the news.
Anyways, there's yet another stupid lawsuit that goes...
It goes with Halo 3.
It's like, Halo 3, more stupid lawsuits.
This time, some dumb shit is complaining that there's not a lot of, um, there's some pixels missing, apparently.
Because, apparently, Halo 3, you know, is upscaled 600, or 640p, I guess.
It's missing 80 pixels, and they explain why they did that and stuff.
So now they're suing because it's not truly 720p.
And they're saying it's false advertising.
What?
What?
For real?
This person's for real?
It's sad, and, you know what, I heard about this, and I actually looked at the back of the box, and on the back it just says, HDTV, you know, 720p, 1080i, 1080p.
It doesn't explicitly say, this game runs natively in these formats.
But what game does?
None of them do.
No, none of them.
And here's the thing, is I would say, okay, why don't you count the pixels that are on your TV there?
720 of them?
Okay, shut up.
So they're trying to say it's false advertising because the game wasn't programmed in 720 or whatever.
Whatever, dude.
That is seriously a stupid complaint.
That's going to get thrown out.
I hope so.
Well, all I know is that all these freaking Halo 3 lawsuits, god damn they make us mad.
And when we get mad, people die.
It is time for my annual Christmas FU.
It's a combination of everything about the holiday season that pisses me off.
So, and again, it's all pretty ridiculous, you know, I'm not attacking anybody, but first of all, the people who over-decorate their houses that look like Christmas puked all over their house, oh my god, learn what aesthetics are for!
Seriously, what about that tree?
Did I not tell you that tree was hideous?
Okay.
And Rob put it best when he told me about it at first.
The whole top part of the tree is not lit because probably a light bulb burnt out.
There's this ginormous tree in front of a church and it's like it's not wearing a top because a bulb burned out at the top of the tree or something.
This is what I think though.
I don't think that's it.
I think they just actually didn't decorate it because there's different types of lights.
There's
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
We have some tacky Christmas lights here in the studio.
That's cute.
You know, I can, like, the icicle lights are nice.
Maybe having a Santa in your front yard or decorating a tree in your front yard.
But, like, this is the worst example ever.
And it's one house that was in Mobile, Alabama that I saw right before probably the year I moved out.
And that was these people who shunned Christmas lights all over their yard, across their yard, in patches.
Their house freaking glowed.
and I was like and on top of that they were all multicolored so it looked like that cut like just like throw up I'm not joking and that originated the phrase Christmas threw up on that house I saw a very offensive house last night
and it was one of those houses where they had the radio station playing and you tune your car to a certain frequency on the radio and then you can, like, the lights flash in sync with the music.
Right?
Okay, but it's hideous because if you don't have the radio station turned on it just looks like this house is randomly flashing all of their lights.
and I swear to God I almost had a seizure driving by that house.
It's not funny.
Seriously, somebody is going to crash into that house and all the kids in that house are going to be in a fire because that house is going to cause somebody to have a seizure.
On top of that, imagine these people's freaking power bill.
and another part of my FU goes towards people who are thinking that Christmas is actually only the celebration that happens around this year when there's a bunch of different religions that celebrate around the same time every year and that really Christmas should actually be in like spring if you're going by quote biblical standards because the census would have happened in the spring and you guys stole a pagan holiday thank you Catholic Church but you know
You can address those cards and letters to Jamie What about the people that have the big inflatable snow globes in their front lawn?
You gotta love that shit, huh?
Okay, I don't mind one but I drove by a house that had three and a giant inflatable Santa whose legs were broken so he was laying on his nose This is in my neighborhood That's a prime target for a BB gun Someone broke Santa's legs?
That's not very nice Someone broke Santa's legs Santa didn't give some mobsters presents this year
But no, there's just, you know, I really... It's the whole over-commercialism of everything and the fact that people get so close-minded.
Okay, here's part three of my Christmas FU.
Oh, Christ.
Drivers!
Because I can't do an FU without bringing up how stupidly mean people get during the holidays.
Okay.
I went to buy something at the store, and this person's pushing past me buying their Christmas tree, and I'm like, I was in line for... I'm like, shit!
And then everybody drives like a freaking retard on the road because they have to get to the mall.
And it's just like, okay, what happened to the whole, you know...
Being nice to everybody during the holidays and trying to share the spirit and everything because people don't give a shit about the Christmas spirit.
They care about their own personal agenda.
You know, maybe there should be more ball shootings if that were the case.
Whoa, whoa.
I wouldn't go there.
Wow, too soon.
Too soon.
No, no, no, no.
But this is the whole thing is that, you know, people are, you know, and I'm getting this from the same people where we're all like,
Oh, well, you know, holiday this, you know, have to be nice, baby Jesus, whatever.
And then these same people are being complete and utter assholes.
And I'm not even, you know, making this up.
I'm seeing people that I know do this.
And I'm like, God, what a freaking hypocrite, you know?
Just...
Don't open your mouth around me ever again.
All right, quick chat room comments.
SSJ100Matt says, Apparently, the higher your energy bill, the more Jesus and God love you.
That's brilliant.
All right, let's move on with the FUs.
Anyways, FU to the kids across the street from my apartment complex who were having car wash today.
They started at about 9 this morning yelling.
Oh, by the way, there was also one of those cars, you know, the ones that have the sound systems that are way too loud with way too much bass.
That was playing from 9 in the morning to about 5 in the afternoons.
and these kids yelling CARWASH!
CARWASH!
CARWASH!
for like seven fucking hours.
I mean, it's just so annoying all day long.
Oh, and then also I have to do my neighbors who apparently thought it was fun to have a party at four in the morning with their drunken friends who are riding a bike that some kid left outside and they're honking the horn on the bike.
Wow, you live in a classy part of town.
That sucks.
That's it.
Puppy, why don't you go ahead.
Big F you to ITT Technical Institute and your terrible scheduling policies.
I started my program for drafting last year.
I should have been done by now, but I'm not going to graduate until six months from now because when I changed my schedule once, it completely fucked me over for the rest of the year.
Thank you for watching!
I'm actually kind of having a good week.
So I guess F you to the fact that it's been so cold lately.
I'll give an F you to that.
My house has been very cold lately.
And, you know, since we live in California, we're very spoiled when it comes to cold.
And just the slightest bit of cold air, it's like, oh my god, get a jacket!
F you to magazine solicitors, too.
I had three of them on my door this week.
Somebody came to my door last night and I told them that I had the flu.
and that I was highly contagious and he really should leave.
You guys are crazy.
He just looked at me like, okay, bye.
Wow.
I should have thought of that.
Around in this neighborhood they just have the kids do all the soliciting because it's kind of hard to tell a kid that you're going to give them a bubonic plague if they don't get off your doorstep.
Or you just open your door wearing nothing but a towel.
I still though have my favorite story about my friend with the Jehovah's Witnesses.
While she was listening to tubular bells... Oh, we gotta get back in the news.
Making a red velvet cake.
So she came out with this knife with, like, red fluid on it and said, What?!
This is my friend that used to work for Lockheed.
Alright, let's move on.
We gotta get back to gaming news.
Weirdos.
All right.
Oh, and what a heck of a story to get back into.
Yes, our buddy Jeff Gertzman, which took up about an hour of last week's show.
We have some quick updates, and I don't want to spend too much time talking in this, because I'll be goddamn if this story just didn't blow up way more than it should have.
You got fired.
Get over it.
Yeah, exactly.
Anyhow... Was it that crap you were talking about?
Yeah, I was trying to catch Jamie up on what happened when she was out.
So, anyhow, here's your updates.
I should have some music that plays during this.
Hold on, I need music.
Jamie, why don't you give us your thoughts on the issue while we get some happy music to play during the Gersman... Happy music?
Should we play some Linkin Park?
There's too much updates.
Oh, it's too bad that I don't have this song from End of Evangelion.
The Happy Suicide Song.
Alright, hold on.
We'll play some happy music here while we give you the Jeff Gertzman updates.
I got it.
Alright.
This week in Gertzmanville, Gertzman made a comment to Joystick.com saying, quote, I stand behind my work regardless of where I do it.
If there was content that I felt I couldn't support, it wouldn't see the light of day.
Then later on, this week, GameSpot posted a Q&A.
Here's a clip from the Q&A.
Question, was Eidos Interactive upset by the game's review?
Answer, it has been confirmed that Eidos representatives expressed their displeasure to their appropriate contacts at GameSpot, but not to editorial directly.
It was not the first time a publisher has voiced disappointment with a game review, and it won't be the last.
However, it is strict GameSpot policy never to let any such feelings result in a review score to be altered or a video review to be pulled.
Also, I'd like to quote Mr. Horse from Eidos.
He said, No, sir, I do not like it.
In response to the GameSpot Q&A, the users of GameSpot said, Thank you, you assholes, for posting that a whole four days late.
Then later on this week, as if no more could go wrong with Kane and Lynch, the review site got criticized by, I'm sorry, the reviews got criticized by Kotaku.
They were posting clips of reviews, one of the clips happened to be from Kotaku, and it had a five-star logo above the review, which makes you think, five-star review!
But in fact, the five stars were just a graphic, and Kotaku was pissed off because they don't review games in stars.
They don't review games, period.
So, that's from a preview of the game.
And that's your update on what's going on in Gertzmanville.
And to be honest, I don't really care anymore.
Now, stop caring.
Hey, Rob?
I didn't care in the first place.
I'm glad to hear it.
That's because you're all better people than I. That's because I wasn't here, thank God.
Alright.
Let's move on then, past Gertzman Gate, if we could.
Well, I have something that's
A little happy, except that I think that it was already there.
There's a press release come out from Gravity that they've opened a U.S.
studio under the name of L5 Games, and they've hired Blizzard folks to help run it.
But the thing is that, now it says that it's in San Mateo, but I actually remember trying to report Gravity to the Better Business Bureau.
The fuck?
When I was still on IRO because of some sort of banning of an account that was falsely done.
This was a long time ago.
But I was trying to find the stuff for somebody to report them to the Better Business Bureau.
And it turned out that every time I tried to pull up the address for them, it came up with a San Mateo address.
But this was like six years ago.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
And it was pretty much because of, you know, all the crappy feedback that came out.
That's why we have Better Business Bureau.
They just supply feedback.
Gravity's just coming over to the U.S.
I got free food because I reported a restaurant to the Better Business Bureau.
They're going to increase their presence in the U.S.
so that Gravity can single-handedly take on Activision Blizzard.
That's what it is, right?
Good luck.
All right.
I'll stick with my, you know, private servers.
Thank you.
Anyways, let's see here.
You know, sometimes you might compare gravity to sucking, you know.
There's service and stuff, so, well, here's something else that sucks, or that probably will suck.
The Castlevania movie!
And, yeah, like, okay, let me put it this way.
And this will save us a lot of time in the future.
Every single movie that's probably being written right now is on hold because of the writer's strike.
Because you have no writer, you can't have any story being written.
So, like that, the Castlevania movie is on hold because of the writer's strike.
Not that it's like, it's on hold from sucking, I guess.
I don't know, it's like,
Thanks for watching!
or 200 and some episodes.
What episode are we on?
250?
259.
I've been doing 100 more episodes, Sammy.
I've been working way too damn hard.
Not recording one of them, but you know what?
I do it for practice.
Okay.
I was going to make some joke about somebody actually writes those video game movies, but anyway, I totally lost it amongst Loki's high sense of sarcasm.
So why don't we spoil the VGAs, which are going on right now on the TV?
Yes, did you know we're competing against the VGAs tonight, our live stream?
So here, why don't we ruin it for you?
Bioshock, one game of the year.
Harmonix got Studio of the Year, Best Shooter, Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare.

I mean, sponsored by you.
Although I think that was just a joke, actually.
So there, we just did you a favor and saved you from sitting through three hours of garbage advertisements and musical performances.
There you have it.
You can send us the thank you cards.
You can send us Christmas cards.
To play devil's advocate here and not to pull you away from listening to our wonderful show, but they are going to have a new trailer for Borderlands, which looks pretty awesome.
It'll be on YouTube tomorrow.
But it looks awesome!
It'll look awesome tomorrow on YouTube.
Well, going on a tangent with Spike TV, yesterday I was watching a marathon of one of their reality shows because I was bored.
Cheaters?
No, it was the Ultimate Fighter.
It was leading up to their finale UFC thing last night.
For eight straight hours, it was nothing but teasing about, oh, we're going to show the cinematic opening to World of Warcraft during the UFC event.
and it was the original opening from, you know, three years, it's three years old and they're going to show this on live TV at a UFC event.
I couldn't, I couldn't think of a worse audience to target that at.
Chat comments.
It wasn't for the new expansion.
No, it was the original cinematic opening to the World of Warcraft.
It wasn't Burning Crusade.
Comment from, comment from chat.
Dark Tetsuya said, the Spike Video Game Awards have been sponsored by Harmonix, 2K Games, EA Sports, it's in the game, and by Mountain Dew, do the dew.
So, in stuff that people actually care about... Yes.
How about Silent Hill news?
Ah, yes.
Yes, please.
More Silent Hill 5 news?
Well, more like Silent Hill Origins.
Ah, okay.
They're talking about it having a PlayStation 2 port.
Oh, that'll be kind of fun.
Yeah, that'll be pretty cool.
They're saying that it would...
It's actually, of course, being published by Climax, and they would also be presenting a second release.
That would be kind of nice, because Silent Hill is one of those games I can't really get into on a handheld platform.
It's kind of something I need on a very large TV with all the lights out, so I can cry like a little girl when the monsters come out to eat me.
Yeah, but you see, all you have to do is just get one of those nice PSPs with the video out, and then you can play it on your TV.
Oh, that's true, but I don't have that because I'm not cool.
Well, the second thing that they're working on is actually an unannounced project.
Dun, dun, dun.
I hope it's more final now.
Didn't they just announce it?
Was that it?
I don't think that was it.
Because if you announce an unannounced project, isn't that announcing the project?
How about an untitled project?
There you go.
Or I should say a secret project because it may have a title.
We just don't know what it is.
It's not secret anymore if you just talked about it.
Macman in our chat room says something interesting here.
Macman says Silent Hill 5 equals awesome and win and shit in my pants.
What kind of comment is that?
Gerardimo says Silent Hill needs to go steal all the VGAs.
Yes, I agree.
Pyramid Head needs to come do an acceptance speech.
He'll make it with his big knife.
That's right.
To the entire front row.
We'll have to wait until next year then, I guess.
Wouldn't that be a dream?
Anyways, people are up in arms because GameTap's removing games.
No.
Some games you will not be able to play in GameTap anymore include Arthur's First Grade, Bionic Bunny's Good Deeds Contest.
Okay, now hold the fuck up because there are actually some good games on that list, Loki.
Stop being such a dick.
There was, I think one of the Civilization games is on there.
No.
I know there's games on there.
Impossible Mission was on there.
Oh, Impossible Mission.
Oh, my mistake.
That game's cool.
You shut your mouth.
Anyways, yes, such wonderful games as Chip's Challenge.
Does anyone remember that from Windows 3.1?
Command & Conquer.
Okay, that was a pretty good game.
Command & Conquer Red Alert, Descent, 2, 3, and Free Space.
Oh, all the Ultima games are going offline.
Earthworm Jim, Earthworm Jim 2, Earthworm Jim 3D.
Free Space 2, Impossible Mission 2, MDK.
That was pretty good.
C. Jerk.
Whatever.
And then other games like Pajama Sam.
Life is rough when you lose stuff.
Or Pajama Sam.
You are what you eat from your head to your feet.
Pajama Sam.
Games to play on any day.
All right.
Well, obviously, though, it's kind of sad, because some of those games, like, even you admit, MDK and some of that stuff is kind of cool, that the service is losing, and a lot of people are like, oh, no, why is GameTap deleting games?
Well, I think the answer is probably just as simple as Time's Up, you know, they probably have these signed agreements.
Well, actually, their licensing's up with that, you know.
This will also make someone sad.
American Deer Hunting 2000.
Okay, aren't all the games that are being pulled, like, most of them come from one or two different companies, right?
Like, EA is one of them, and there's, I think, another one, and...
I think this probably just kind of screams that EA is probably going to do their own thing.
Or EA is going to be signing a deal with somebody else soon where they're getting more money.
Some of the sim games are leaving, like SimTunes.
I didn't even realize there was a SimTunes.
SimTower, SimSafari, SimPark, SimCity2000, SimCityClassic, Tetris.
See?
There's some good stuff leaving.
Whatever.
Seriously, it's like winter games.
Alright, well, we'll see what happens.
Who knows, maybe EA is going to be starting their own competing service soon, or... Damn it!
Somebody else, what?
PuttPunzle's Fun Shop is gone!
What am I going to play now?
Also, I want to say, it kind of sucks for them because they just had this big brouhaha over, hooray, we hit our 1,000th game, and now losing these 70 games is going to put them back under 1,000.
So I think it would be funny if in January they say, we hit our 1,000th game again!
They should.
That would be hilarious.
Alright.
Anyhow, let's...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The Game of the Week is Threads of Fate.
Duprism Big Fat Axe
And, um, it's really, it actually had pretty good graphics for being an old PlayStation game.
It was really simple for how it played, but it was really fun.
And I actually tried to play, I actually started playing through Duprism, and then when Threads of Fate came out, um, I had to just go out and get it.
So, and I actually found my copy of it the other day, which made me think about it.
It was just a really cool little game, and it had its own, um, pretty good following overseas, too.
to the point where there was a fan version of a sequel called Duo Princess where you play as the Princess Mint and her sister Maya.
So it was pretty good.
I really just love this game.
But it came out the same time that Vagrant Story, Legend of Mana, Chrono Cross, and Parasite 2 came out.
So it's sort of
Duprism Threads of Fate
I did not play this game, but I should.
You can borrow my copy.
Because I played some of those other games you mentioned.
Wasn't that also the same time that horrible, horrible mana game came out on PSP?
That was Legend of Mana.
Oh, God, that game was awful.
I hated Legend of Mana.
I have the Japanese version of Legend of Mana, and I was like, too much text.
I read 30 kanji.
I can't read this game.
So, yeah.
All right.

Out here in studio.
Okay, Loki's going to play something during break.
