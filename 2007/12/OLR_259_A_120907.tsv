14471	19175	Tonight, December 9th, 2007, new details emerge on Street Fighter IV.
19556	24100	Nintendo gets a ninja party next year, and has GameTap started removing games?
32441	36603	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36643	47109	We are that gaming show, podcast, blogcast, Zoomcast, whatever you're into, thing dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
47149	48149	My name is Rob Roberts.
48529	51671	Welcome back to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
51931	52231	Hi.
52391	53032	How are you doing, Jamie?
53972	55173	I'm almost full.
55649	56389	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
81960	82460	Good times.
83860	95262	I went to Alabama with Sauce, and we stayed at my grandmom's house and ate a lot of Blue Bell ice cream and watched a bunch of movies and had Cracker Barrel and Waffle House.
96243	97943	Sounds very Jamie.
97963	98903	It was very delicious.
99083	100103	It was a very Jamie experience.
100123	101163	I had a delicious time.
101604	101964	Excellent.
102384	104184	All right, say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.
104724	104864	Hello.
104964	105884	How are you doing, Loki?
106284	106464	Fine.
106945	108645	How are you enjoying the new studio, by the way?
109145	109345	It's great.
109798	110538	It's big.
110658	111998	Yes, it's much more spacious than before.
112279	114839	It even comes complete with a washer and dryer that you can't see on the camera.
117019	119580	Yes, for when I piss myself with joy.
119600	122561	I can just clean my clothes right there.
122601	123201	That's awesome.
124121	130722	Or, you know, when we have the, as somebody said earlier, on the cam, we covered a ladder with one of the blankets there to make it look a little better.
131302	136143	And somebody said something about we could use the ladder in having ladder matches during the show.
136323	139004	And I was saying, oh, we have, you know, cage matches and
139318	142739	Bra and Panties matches, and Whipped Cream and Bananas matches.
142759	147501	Anyway, say hello as well to the one and only Puppy is here tonight.
147521	149081	How are you doing, Puppy?
150381	154923	I'm worn out from school and work, but I'm getting by.
155323	159024	And I'm playing lots of Rock Band, and my right leg is cramping.
159064	161385	Now hold on, don't spoil your gaming weeks just yet.
162625	165126	See, you're angsty that your right leg is cramping so much.
166929	168850	All sorts of errors tonight in the brand new studio.
168950	170450	Do you like our new digs?
170570	172691	It's much more spacious than that previous box.
172711	174472	This is much more spacious than the previous box.
174532	177093	Although Loki still has the same table that wobbles.
177293	182255	I think as somebody said... I used to have the overturned laundry basket.
182755	184056	Now I have the wobbly table.
184316	185136	I'm moving up in life.
185276	186697	Independent radio at its finest.
186997	193540	Somebody was saying earlier when I was doing the test earlier today and somebody was watching said all I need is a little mini bar back there and we would truly be an orange lounge.
193560	194240	It would be fun.
194980	196501	DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?
196601	197201	How was your gaming week?
197221	199162	Well, I played a lot of Ragnarok now that I have internet again.
226248	226728	I missed it.
227189	230850	I have a character at level 97 now, and that was really awesome.
231891	240094	And while I was in Alabama, I didn't play crap, except on the airplane where I tried to play some Oendan, and totally irritated this guy sitting next to me.
240134	241255	It was fantastic.
242135	242715	That's great.
243796	246617	I did that when I still had it when I was in classes.
246837	250719	In between breaks, I'd start playing it, and people would look at me like, what the hell is that tapping noise you're doing?
251640	257946	I had my headphones on, and he was just looking at me like, oh, but on the way back, this is cool.
258907	262270	When I got on the little dinky tiny plane, no, I take that back.
262290	264312	It was when I got on the bigger plane coming out of Dallas.
265653	268375	These guys were sitting behind me like, oh, well, don't mind us.
268435	271558	You know, we're just about, you know, we're nerds, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
271898	273760	I was like, okay.
274261	276583	And then for some reason, we started talking about Half-Life.
277996	284619	I can't play Half-Life, but I was like, yeah, I'm going to get Portal anyway, but I'm going to be so motion sick.
284639	286801	They're like, you get motion sick and you're on an airplane?
286821	290262	I was like, only video games make me motion sick.
290282	293084	That and riding in the backseat of a car will do it sometimes.
293744	295245	Or riding in Kristen's car on Highway 1.
296706	299067	So yeah, that was my gaming week.
299727	301248	We have a Black Knight pinball in our house now.
302588	303249	Not a Black Knight 2000.
305170	307571	We are housing somebody's Black Knight.
307947	308467	What does that mean?
308587	309408	You're borrowing?
310369	311590	We're providing them storage space.
312130	312270	Okay.
312891	315212	In exchange for massive amounts of playing it.
315693	316033	Alrighty.
316733	318755	Well, let's go over to the one and only Loki.
318795	319776	How was your gaming week, Loki?
321917	324979	Not as filled as I thought it would be, unfortunately.
325320	327701	I planned to play a lot of things and never got around to it.
328342	332625	But I played more Zelda fandom, Hourglass, almost done with that.
333942	337584	See, the thing with Zelda games is, like, when you finish them, you don't want to play them again.
338084	338965	It's like, you're done.
340386	342327	Anyways, um... I don't know about that.
342387	346069	I challenge that statement, because I can still go back and play the old Super Nintendo one.
346289	348411	And I think of the old school NES ones I still love, too.
348431	350372	Yeah, true, like the Super Nintendo ones and stuff.
350452	351973	I think this game is a little bit shorter.
352473	357176	I mean, it seemed to be really short, versus, you know... Maybe you're just that good.
358196	359677	No, the game is really fucking easy.
359757	361178	It's, like, stupid easy.
362239	362379	Um...
363621	366002	I don't know, it's just, it's okay, I guess.
368122	370623	Saints Row, I actually went back and started playing the single player stuff.
371503	375925	Not really, now, I haven't really been playing the single player stuff.
376005	381246	I've been playing single player, but I've been blowing up this armored car over and over and over again.
381466	385807	Because there's a trick where you can keep getting more money, because I'm trying to get the achievement for a million dollars.
386428	387608	And so I keep doing that.
388066	390887	But it's entertaining nonetheless because you're blowing up cars over and over.
391087	392527	Achievement whore.
393147	396688	But we've been switching up at work instead of all rocket matches now.
396888	402669	Now we're doing shotguns, pimp slap, and grenades in the meter made cars.
403149	405269	It's hilarious because those things... That sounds like a party.
405609	407749	Pimp slaps and grenades in the meter made cars.
408150	408750	But you don't understand.
408770	409530	That's like a band name.
409550	411810	See, Saints Row, the pimp slap is like a one hit kill.
412030	414351	You just smack somebody and it launches them across the entire arena.
414391	415151	It's actually pretty fun.
416151	416251	Um...
417376	419077	DanSenseRevolutionUniverse2 DanSenseRevolutionUniverse2
441612	444694	It's fucking DDR.
445215	447676	It's exactly the same as Universe 1 to me.
448797	450038	They've changed a few things.
451319	455782	The quest mode, you're no longer moving around the United States and the world and stuff.
456462	459605	Now there's fictional DDR island shit.
460305	460665	I don't know.
461746	465969	But is it broken still like the first quest mode was or did they actually kind of fix that?
466818	471299	I would say it's 80% broken still, instead of 100% broken as before.
473080	474500	The song list is okay.
476460	479981	I still hate the fact that I have to play through quest mode in order to unlock songs.
480361	481482	I find that very annoying.
484102	485203	But, I mean, it's okay.
485243	485863	It's DDR.
486583	494385	Luckily, I didn't have to buy it, so that's good, because right now the only way they're selling it is with the dance pad, and you have to pay lots of money for that.
496132	500593	If you're interested in picking it up, it is coming out in January, game by itself.
501814	509215	And about the same time we'll be getting a DDR Disney Channel edition, which is probably going to be crap, but that's okay.
510516	513116	But high school musical songs to DDR too.
513557	515837	Okay, yeah, lame.
517418	518858	Let's see, what else did I play this week?
521481	525943	I think that's about it, because really I haven't had a chance to play a lot of stuff.
526043	530506	In fact, I bought two games yesterday and I haven't even unwrapped them yet.
530526	537389	I've got Contra 4 and Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings for when I finish Zelda, which will be very soon.
539090	545233	I don't know, all the extra stuff in Zelda, like all the hidden islands and stuff, they have an island that looks like a DS, and I was like, oh, that's kind of funny.
546855	548656	That was about the extent of my interest in that.
548996	552237	And then there's another island that you can find treasure.
552297	553877	I don't know, it's really kind of lame.
553977	563560	It's not like Wind Waker was, where it kind of felt like Mega Man Legends to me a little bit, where there's a lot of exploring, a ton of different dungeons and stuff.
564680	569182	This game, I don't know, it's just kind of really scaled down and made it a hell of a lot easier.
569622	573703	I have to go back and play Wind Waker again, because I never did finish that game.
574448	580472	And then maybe eventually I'll warm up to playing Twilight Princess, but... I don't know, I just don't like it.
581913	582633	Alright, fine.
583654	584715	Alright, then my gaming week.
584915	588917	There was some new stuff I finally got to play this week, as opposed to the same old MMOs.
588978	591059	I actually didn't play the MMOs so much this week.
591439	596302	I actually checked out some new stuff, including the Orange Box, finally, which is magnificent.
596883	598604	There's several different games in there.
598624	602246	I haven't even gotten to touch Team Fortress 2 yet, but I've been playing some of the other games in there.
602626	603207	Half-Life, which...
603768	612504	To be honest, I know it's a critically acclaimed game and everything, but I just never really got the chance to play it before, so this is really the first chance I'm getting to play Half-Life.
613086	614007	Half-Life 2, I mean, of course.
615732	616292	It's kind of cool.
616332	617392	It's very immersive.
617432	618333	And of course, Portal.
618353	620373	I've been playing a lot of Portal.
621433	628694	Moving through the game rather quickly, I guess the game really isn't that long, per se, but be damned if it isn't pretty funny and pretty innovative.
630015	633735	It's a great kind of, like, it's a puzzle game in first person.
634176	636636	Like, it's not a first person shooter, it's a first person puzzler.
636716	637816	I don't know what else to call it.
637856	638436	It's pretty cool.
639196	641377	I swear to God, though, that whole thing where you have to, like...
642097	648879	Fire a portal on the ground, and then fire the other half up on the ceiling, and then fall from the ceiling to the one on the ground to get enough inertia.
649119	653600	That thing drove me frickin' nuts for like, I was trying to do that for like an hour.
653640	656200	It was so difficult, but I finally got through that.
657500	667743	Let's see, also, the other game I've been playing is Geometry Wars Galaxies I picked up on the Nintendo Wii, and I'm having quite a bit of fun with Geometry Wars Galaxies.
667803	668743	It's a pretty good time.
671027	674249	It's a lot different than just the game on the Xbox.
701496	703077	I actually kind of enjoyed the control scheme.
703217	709059	And plus, if for whatever reason you don't like that control scheme, you can do the classic controller, which is great.
709559	721863	Classic controller doesn't feel quite as nice as the Xbox 360 controller did, and I think it's because the directionals are a little more grooved on the Wii, whereas the Xbox 360 has the full 360 degrees of movement a little bit.
722143	725764	So I think that it doesn't have quite the same feel with the classic controller, but it's nice.
726364	730547	My only minor complaints about the game is that, A, it looks better on the 360, obviously.
730587	735970	I mean, you can tell there's some graphical dumbing down that had to be done for the Wii.
736290	737350	But it doesn't look bad.
737430	738871	I mean, it is Geometry Wars.
738891	744554	You're not going to expect, you know, the world's best looking game, you know, when you're looking at that.
746385	762628	and then also the other only kind of minor complaint I have is that it's kind of cool that you progress through these different levels and you unlock new planets and you unlock new power-ups because the other kind of thing that you have in Geometry Wars Galaxy is you have a little droid that follows you and you can tell the droid what to do.
763129	770130	You can buy an attack mode or buy a defend and as you play more levels, the droid levels up with you.
771090	772470	It's kind of cool, so it gets a little smarter.
772911	774631	But the only thing is that there's really no...
775707	776407	and so on.
803024	805306	That was my only minor complaint, but overall, I think the game's great.
805326	806948	You don't need cutscenes in Geometry Wars?
807068	813535	I don't mean, like, you have to, like, have these grand, like, cutscenes, but, like, give me a reason for kind of, like, unlocking all these things.
813575	816177	Or, you know, just a little bit of a story wouldn't hurt.
816598	817078	You know what I mean?
817378	825987	What they need to do is take Geometry Wars out of, like, just the normal, like, asteroid kind of stuff and make it into, like, a shoot-'em-up game.
826601	828401	Like Grideus or something like that.
828801	829642	That would be fun.
829862	830482	Yeah, it might be fun.
831522	839683	The other cool thing about Geometry Wars I thought was really cool is that you can download the demo of... Well, it's not really the demo of Galaxies to your DS.
839723	841064	It's just basically retro evolved.
841104	844104	You can download to your DS from the Wii, which is kind of cool.
845124	847545	But I do not like the way the DS controls at all.
847965	849505	So I don't really want the game on DS.
849525	853446	Because you use the stylus on the bottom to control your firing and it just...
853666	854687	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
880942	882984	A ton, ever since I got it.
883104	894916	I had to switch back to my Guitar Hero 3 controller because the strum bar on my Rock Band controller died, and I sent out for the warranty on that, and it actually came back already.
895536	898519	It only took three days for me to get the replacement, and I sent the other one back.
899560	899840	And then...
900799	904641	Other than that, I got Gamefly, so I've been renting games lately.
905921	916645	I wanted to rent Mass Effect, Call of Duty 4, Orange Box, and I guess I put Dead Rising on my list a long time ago and forgot about it.
917225	918966	And they ended up sending me that instead.
919646	923688	I played it for a total of an hour and a half and sent it back.
924668	927189	I could not stand that game for some reason.
928330	928970	It was just terrible.
929582	933983	I thought it was great because you could hit zombies with a scythe or a lawnmower.
935064	947347	Well that was entertaining but the story could have been cooler but the way they've got the game set up you can only save it once and if you die you have to go back very far and reload a bunch of crap.
947447	951929	I just got sick of it very quickly and I would not have played through the entire game.
955530	955910	Is that it?
956790	956930	Um...
958601	963198	Rock Band, Dead Rising, not playing Halo again until the maps come out next week.
964591	965511	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
991759	993539	I'll just have to get something to split that signal.
993900	997260	So, but, yeah, Jamie and Loki's computers run fine on the wireless network.
997300	997800	I don't know what that is.
997820	999861	But then again, they're not trying to broadcast a radio program from that.
1000181	1003281	So I apologize, chat room, if Live365's going up and down.
1003381	1006082	We'll just kind of have to deal with it tonight and then next week we'll fix that.
1006102	1006622	But now we know.
1007362	1013284	Which is weird because I ran Live365 and Op11 at the same time for 40 minutes earlier today and everything was fine.
1013784	1015584	But now, of course, we're having a plethora of problems.
1015704	1016244	Just my luck.
1016624	1018685	And people will continuously bitch about it.
1018705	1018725	I...
1021158	1021979	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1050464	1054846	Anyhow, I was going to say, I was going to talk about one more thing that I played this week.
1055066	1055546	Well, alright.
1056766	1071012	And I'm not sure, I can't remember if we're getting into this later on or not, but anyways, there's like an independent games festival thing kind of going on right now that they've got some of the finalists for.
1071636	1073376	I think the awards come up later in our show.
1073396	1073897	Yeah, the awards.
1074397	1076897	The 10th Annual Independent Games Festival.
1076937	1080458	Anyways, I was playing some of the finalists for that.
1080838	1086720	And one of the games they played, Clean Asia, which, you know, I'm a huge fan of Warning Forever and stuff like that.
1087440	1088900	Very similar style game.
1089040	1089800	Very cool shoot-em-up.
1089821	1090521	You gotta try that.
1090861	1093701	Also, Cran Physics is another funny one.
1094042	1097782	But they've got some other stuff in there as well, including a game that I talked about before.
1097802	1099503	What was it?
1099723	1099803	Uh,
1100540	1101501	Let's see here.
1102081	1108044	Fret Nice was another one of the nominees, which is a pretty fun game to play on the PC with the Guitar Hero controller.
1108905	1109905	All right.
1110065	1112207	Well, tell us more about that when we get to that part of the show.
1112267	1112787	Will do.
1113067	1113367	All right.
1113648	1115288	Rob, I have a question about your gaming week.
1115569	1115789	Sure.
1116249	1118370	Did you make it past that part in Portal?
1118750	1119411	I sure did.
1119451	1120792	I got to the next level in Portal.
1120852	1125915	I was venting with Jamie my frustration at the robots that shoot you a bunch and then you die.
1126235	1127836	I was having a hard time getting through that portion.
1128196	1129897	And then Jamie said, you have to shoot the ceiling.
1130641	1131202	I felt bad for Rob
1158888	1161849	I watched the walkthrough like a bajillion times just because I thought it was funny.
1162829	1164469	And so I had to help.
1165109	1165529	That's right.
1165589	1172050	So now I'm to the next stage in Portal and I just kind of quit for the night because I wanted to play some other stuff so I had new things to talk about tonight.
1172990	1174531	Anyhow, a little bit of housekeeping.
1175071	1181812	I guess I already talked about kind of the parts about the new studio and unfortunately the effect it's having on us tonight with the whole live stream cutting in and out.
1181852	1182312	Sorry about that.
1183852	1186153	But we'll hopefully fix that within the next couple weeks.
1188365	1190066	Are we doing a show December 23rd?
1190406	1191506	I don't think we talked about that.
1191926	1193166	It's the Christmas week.
1194087	1195327	I'll be here for Christmas.
1196387	1197808	I should be available.
1198088	1199108	Yeah, I think I'll probably be here too.
1199128	1199908	But I have to work Monday.
1200608	1202409	And of course we have our year-end show coming.
1202429	1203369	You have to work on Christmas Eve?
1203889	1204430	Yeah.
1204450	1204870	Sorry about that.
1205310	1209411	Well, I work for, you know, freaking tyrants, so it's okay.
1210446	1220915	We'll be having our year-end special probably on December 30th, and I'm hoping that we get some guests on the program like we did last year, but more on that in the next couple weeks.
1221255	1222436	Let's get to the gaming news.
1222676	1223897	Enough about the housekeeping stuff.
1223937	1225358	Let's start off Loki tonight.
1225699	1228181	Anyways, I just wanted to comment one thing on the chat room.
1228221	1230643	Everyone's talking about the weighted companion cube and stuff.
1231063	1235867	No one ever mentions the weighted companion sphere that happens to be in challenge mode of the game.
1236661	1238021	No love for the sphere, I guess.
1238601	1240162	What's the difference between the sphere and the cube?
1240922	1242422	One's round and one's cube.
1243402	1246243	Does the computer call it the weighted companion sphere?
1246703	1247083	I don't know.
1247483	1254645	I think all that stuff's still the same, but it's just harder because you can't just drop it and it will roll.
1254765	1258406	Oh, that's right, and you can't jump on top of it as easy because it'll roll.
1258486	1259086	Okay, I get it.
1259566	1261746	I'm like, duh, I know one's a sphere and a cube, dumbass.
1261807	1263707	I'm like, what is the effect that that has?
1264227	1264847	Okay, I get it.
1265067	1267688	And no, the sphere does not have any hearts on it.
1268288	1269509	Aw, sadness.
1269949	1271309	So it doesn't really like you.
1271550	1272590	It's just pretending.
1272730	1274891	Well, then we'll throw that thing in the incinerator like that.
1275911	1282973	Anyways, this week, Rockstar happened to throw out on the internet a brand new trailer for Grand Theft Auto 4.
1283474	1284874	It's fucking fantastic.
1284974	1286035	It's called Move Up, Ladies.
1286115	1293077	It's basically what's really important about this trailer, though, compared to the last one, which came out about six months ago.
1293777	1296698	is it looks a lot better than, you know, the game has really progressed.
1296838	1306021	But it did show kind of a lot of the detail that they're adding there, including, you know, gunfights and all the stuff that you expect from Grand Theft Auto.
1306061	1307701	But there's a bunch of new screenshots and stuff.
1307862	1310502	I have to say the game is coming along very well.
1310942	1311903	Looks awesome.
1312123	1318505	And I think a lot of people that were kind of hesitating about the game before saying, oh, this is just going to be crap, are really on board with it.
1318625	1318765	But
1319565	1321706	If you want to check it out, it's pretty much everywhere.
1321766	1324546	All the major sites, Xbox Live, PlayStation Network.
1325527	1326787	You can definitely find it at the download.
1329408	1329928	Alrighty.
1330268	1333809	So, does it actually show more than just the cutscenes?
1333829	1336970	Do you actually see what the game is?
1337070	1339210	All the cutscenes are with the in-game engine.
1339310	1342491	So, I mean, you essentially see what the game looks like.
1343471	1345332	One of the characters that they showed also was...
1346801	1348242	I just can't wait for the game to come out.
1348322	1351525	I hope it comes out actually in April, like it's supposed to.
1367216	1368777	I thought they discontinued the AIBO.
1388729	1390171	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1410331	1413594	Like it does in Sony's home, which should be kind of interesting.
1414075	1422663	So apparently you're going to be able to download new personalities for the AIBO from PlayStation Network and you're going to be able to use the PSP with it over Wi-Fi.
1423203	1428148	The little camera in the dog's head will actually also show on your PSP screen.
1428628	1435815	So what you could actually do is you could move your dog around and put it right under Lady's skirts and then use the PSP as an upskirt cam.
1436684	1436964	Sweet.
1437004	1439365	So when girls go, oh, what a cute fake doggy.
1439805	1442826	That's probably the reasoning why they put it in Stuff Magazine to begin with.
1443406	1444207	Possibly.
1444567	1445227	Possibly.
1445607	1447228	I wanted to get one so I can play with my cat.
1448028	1450549	Because my cat's kind of getting lonely and she's causing a lot of trouble.
1450569	1456351	And I figured this would be a perfect way to spend a couple thousand dollars is to get a thing to play with my cat.
1456411	1459292	Then I could also watch it at work and watch what my cat's doing.
1459792	1464733	Now here's my favorite part is that Stuff Magazine rates this rumor at a 53% possibility.
1468035	1469776	Where the fuck do you get a number like that?
1469876	1478923	Like 53, like it makes it sound like there's this real scientific process that rumors go through over at Stuff Magazine in order to get a rating.
1479003	1481585	So it's like, you know, they put it in their big super predicting computer.
1483026	1483646	Here's a little note.
1484707	1487769	This has a 53% probability of being true.
1487789	1492713	This is about as official as the If They Mated segment of Conan.
1492933	1493213	Okay.
1494406	1494826	We'll see.
1494926	1495246	I don't know.
1495346	1496707	I kind of call BS.
1497107	1500728	I think there may be like a little something with the AIBO, but I don't know.
1500848	1501529	Upskirt cams?
1501589	1502169	I don't know about that.
1502509	1504249	We don't need to be giving Sony any ideas.
1504450	1505550	I want an AIBO, Rob.
1506410	1506690	Okay.
1507050	1509071	Well, save up your money and then you can buy one.
1509231	1511052	I've wanted an AIBO for a very long time.
1511092	1512813	I have a LiveJournal icon that's an AIBO.
1513033	1513593	I want a pony.
1514553	1515073	You know what?
1515293	1515373	What?
1515393	1518274	You'd be more likely to get a pony than I'd be to get an AIBO.
1518294	1518895	AIBO judgment.
1521731	1522852	They should make the eye pony.
1523173	1527456	I was watching a special on robotics last night and they were bringing up the eye bow.
1527876	1535943	But it was these lifelike robot people thing that could interview people and repeat back your question and follow you and do all this stuff.
1535983	1538705	I was like, yet the eye bow didn't sell better.
1539906	1540707	Eye paparazzi?
1542528	1545110	It was called like the respond cue or something.
1545151	1545731	It was really weird.
1546271	1548373	It was at one of the Tokyo robotics shows I was watching.
1549094	1549294	Anyway.
1549314	1549394	Okay.
1550350	1561079	For anyone who is interested in Devil May Cry 4, which I know I am because I really, really, really, really, really, really like Devil May Cry, except why the hell are they giving Dante a beard?
1563040	1569425	The demo is going to be out in early 2008, according to Capcom, for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
1569926	1573308	There will be a PC version, but no word on if we're getting a demo of that.
1573589	1578833	The demo is supposed to be different levels in the game instead of just, oh, here's the start of the game, bye.
1580037	1580657	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1605489	1606870	We've secretly replaced Shermie with an eyeball.
1635478	1640180	My cat's so retarded, she still thinks that the mirror is another cat, so, you know.
1641100	1651145	I was watching on YouTube last night, though, along with the robotic stuff, I was also watching cats talking to people, you know, that could imitate human talk, and Shermie was going crazy.
1651845	1653646	She was running into the desk.
1653666	1655246	She's like, it's unnatural!
1656227	1661489	And then she legitimately... What in God's name is going on over there?
1661789	1662990	That's what it sounded like, actually.
1663070	1663270	Wow.
1664048	1664909	You don't understand.
1665029	1666510	We're kind of crazy with our cat.
1666810	1672254	We'll make her talk, and we'll have conversations with her, but she can't talk.
1672434	1673915	And I don't know why the hell we do that.
1675997	1677818	And she has a really high-pitched voice somehow.
1678038	1678419	I don't know.
1678439	1679079	It's weird.
1679259	1686385	One of the videos I was watching last night, it just sounded like the cat was actually just saying, Hello!
1686745	1687405	Hello!
1687445	1687926	Like that.
1688006	1689767	And I was like, okay.
1690428	1692269	And then another one was a cat sleeping in a sink.
1694335	1696376	Is this where Lolcats is going in 2008?
1696416	1697577	I think so.
1698357	1698597	Wow.
1699438	1701219	Okay, let's move on.
1701659	1713446	Anyways, so yes, one of the unfortunate things with the PlayStation 3 version of Rockbin was that you couldn't use your Guitar Hero 3 controller with it.
1714146	1722150	Well, now that's going to be fixed, and there is going to be a patch that's going to be coming where you'll be able to download it, and it will allow it to play.
1722431	1723091	Hooray!
1723111	1723231	Hooray!
1724073	1727857	That's kind of funny, though, is they had another story that came out earlier this week.
1729078	1741030	Some guy, RedOctane, was actually making fun of Rock Band and their guitar controllers and saying how they're never going to make those controllers compatible with Guitar Hero 3 because they think their controllers are crap.
1742471	1744694	Way to take the high road, RedOctane.
1744734	1745735	Hey, it doesn't matter that our...
1747697	1752479	and Sumers or anything might want it a little bit easier so they don't have to buy more of your crappy controllers.
1752939	1755420	Sure, let's just go ahead and, like, piss on them.
1756420	1757080	Hooray.
1759521	1766404	I do like, though, that they're at least patching to, you know, at least somebody's giving in a little bit and patching so the guitars work universally.
1766464	1767104	I mean, you know.
1767124	1768044	Exactly, they should.
1768124	1770285	I don't understand why they lock it out of other games.
1770365	1771405	It's just fucking lazy.
1771805	1773386	Actually, it's just fucking mean is what it is.
1774460	1779621	Jonathan F. in our chat room has a good point that I don't believe we're covering elsewhere on our show tonight.
1779721	1785883	He says, speaking of patches, Guitar Hero Wii discs will be replaced in 2008 to fix the mono sound problem.
1785903	1786503	Did you hear about that?
1787363	1788223	Yeah.
1788324	1792345	So they're going to remaster the discs or whatever, and they'll be available in 2008, new discs.
1792645	1794345	But how many people do you think will actually do that?
1794425	1797026	I bet most Wii owners probably wouldn't even think to do it.
1798126	1798866	There might be a few.
1799286	1800627	Well, we need to spread the word.
1800707	1801927	Make it financially...
1802668	1803328	Sucky for them.
1803348	1803989	Well, there you have it.
1804029	1811111	If you own Guitar Hero on the Wii, then be sure in 2008 you request your... And even if you don't care, just get a new one anyway.
1811151	1812972	It's just because newer is better.
1813372	1814553	That's what you need to remember.
1814693	1815473	Newer is better.
1815533	1816073	That's right.
1816233	1816993	Newer is better.
1817714	1820735	Moving on, we're talking about the PlayStation a little bit.
1820755	1826057	And on the PlayStation Network, it has been released this week a brand new bowling game.
1826177	1827597	High Velocity Bowling is $10.
1829820	1837223	Also added to the PlayStation Network, some new stuff for the game Folklore, and of course, Rock Band downloadable content.
1838083	1844325	Also, Wild Arms is now available for download on the old school PlayStation Games line.
1844786	1845366	Yay!
1846706	1851208	So, I don't know, it's certainly not Wii Bowling, but it kind of looks, you know...
1852610	1853651	Looks a little urban.
1853871	1855532	You play a guy with tattoos.
1855792	1857794	You actually use a 6-axis controller.
1857814	1859255	Yeah, I was kind of curious about that.
1859815	1872523	Yeah, we're going to have people throw... See, though, I don't know this one would be making holes in TVs and stuff, because it's kind of rounded and a little bit light, whereas when you kind of huck the remote, it's kind of like a javelin type thing.
1872563	1873704	Just get the nerf thing for it.
1874064	1874545	That's what you do.
1875285	1876446	Yeah, just get the nerf thing for it.
1877627	1877847	Well...
1878982	1885787	And other news for our PlayStation 3 owners, which at Best Buy, that was freaking sad.
1886347	1886647	Oh, yes.
1886688	1890510	Jamie and I went to Best Buy earlier this week, and we were shopping.
1890750	1892251	We were just kind of going around.
1892432	1892912	Sad.
1893072	1895594	That's when I bought Geometry Wars Galaxies.
1895614	1895774	Yes.
1896054	1899477	I was thinking about getting Trauma Center, and I ended up getting the cheaper games.
1899497	1902098	And I bought Super Breakout for the Atari 5200 that night.
1902138	1902719	But that was later.
1903039	1904280	But I already owned two copies of it.
1905548	1906950	Why did you buy a third, dummy?
1907270	1914156	I thought that we didn't have it, and then it occurred to me when we got home that freaking Super Breakout was the game that came with the Atari 5200.
1914196	1919681	But I have a manual now, and that's good.
1920168	1920408	All right.
1921429	1927913	Well, anyhow, as I say, at Best Buy, we were there, and, you know, there were big stacks of PlayStation 3s, like, all over the store.
1928253	1931736	Like, not just one stack, but, like, at least four stacks of PlayStation 3s.
1932016	1936559	There were easily, what, 50 systems just sitting out, unloved?
1936899	1942543	And we were kind of, you know, we were talking to the guy, because the guy was helping me look up Geometry Wars Galaxies, because for whatever reason, they didn't have any out on the floor.
1942583	1943424	They were all in the cage.
1943744	1945225	So I was asking him if they had it and everything.
1945492	1946212	Metal Gear Solid 4 Geriatric Snake
1975236	1975596	We'll see.
1975976	1976336	Anyway.
1978097	1979798	Nobody likes a geriatric snake.
1979958	1984960	Or GZDr4F says Unreal Tournament 3 will sell the PlayStation 3 units.
1985300	1985720	No, it won't.
1985780	1986400	It will sell some.
1986540	1987140	It will sell some.
1987440	1988581	There's fanboys for everything.
1989661	1993102	Well, you know, maybe when they put out Jumping Flash 3.
1993743	1994203	But anyway.
1994223	1997364	For the 2.0 PS3 firmware update...
2001008	2008994	There is... It was actually included that there were custom soundtracks for High Velocity Bowling.
2010395	2011957	Okay, who's playing High Velocity Bowling?
2013838	2015719	Well, I don't know whoever downloaded it this week.
2015740	2016880	Who knows?
2017101	2020903	But it also has an in-game friends list for the demo for Time Shift.
2021424	2027549	So it looks like that more games, hopefully, are going to be incorporating that type of thing, like a...
2029156	2030378	Who's Online, that kind of thing.
2030619	2033323	So, unfortunately though, it's not going to be centralized.
2033523	2035366	It'll be up to the game people to put it in their games.
2035566	2035807	Yeah.
2036929	2040354	I mean, they're not getting it.
2040995	2042558	I don't think they...
2044562	2045803	Microsoft's already figured it out.
2072865	2074386	They'll implement it when they feel like it.
2074546	2075386	I guess that's true.
2075406	2079729	At least they don't charge, and if you want to play games on Xbox Live, you've got to pay.
2079749	2081389	They don't charge, and it shows.
2082610	2083170	Well, anyway.
2083991	2084531	Anyways.
2086152	2090274	However, retailers are charging for games, and here's what's coming out this week.
2090854	2093515	Not a whole lot, and it's a lot of leftovers, actually.
2094196	2098178	Anyways, BlackSate Area 51 is finally making its way out on the PlayStation 3.
2099440	2101301	Way to be on top of things midway.
2101862	2104004	Go Unreal Tournament 3 engine!
2104124	2105385	Or Unreal Engine 3, whatever.
2106906	2111489	Speaking of Unreal, Unreal Tournament 3 is coming out this week on PS3 as well.
2113211	2116013	Universe at War, Earth Assault on the PC.
2117094	2120336	Warriors of the Lost Empire on PSP.

2124480	2128882	NCAA March Madness 2008, coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and 360.
2130502	2134104	Luxor 2 on the DS, hooray.
2136264	2142727	Let's see here, Super Swing Golf Season 2, that's going to be coming out, in case you liked the last one.
2144047	2146428	I don't know how many people are getting this.
2146928	2147628	Madden NFL 08 Español!
2150083	2151123	The Spanish version.
2151143	2152303	Hey, you know what?
2152363	2155984	It makes the game appealing to an audience that maybe wasn't able to get into it before, you know?
2156804	2157364	Exactly.
2157564	2158724	Now with more luchadors.
2160365	2161525	Unfortunately, that's not true.
2162205	2163465	The luchadors are great.
2165046	2165446	Is that it?
2168266	2169046	Let's see.
2170446	2172127	No, that's not it.
2172687	2173947	The Golden Compass on PC.
2174347	2175407	Oh, goody!
2175607	2177168	I'm so glad we have that.
2177848	2179388	Showtime Boxing on the Wii.
2182171	2185453	and... and that's it.
2206466	2209767	Nintendo Wii, Chocobos Dungeon, Tokiwasure no Meikyuu, Knights,
2228133	2237401	Journey of Dreams or as they call it in Japan Nights Hoshifuru Yoru no Monogatari is coming out this week
2238908	2240209	Shanghai comes out.
2240309	2243771	I don't know if that's a redone version of the old Mahjong game, but I don't know.
2244112	2245152	That comes out on the Nintendo Wii.
2245192	2246013	I somehow doubt that.
2246753	2249315	Soul Calibur Legends also makes its way to the Nintendo Wii.
2249975	2251997	Another version of the Castle of Shikigami 3.
2252457	2255799	And We Love Golf also comes out on the Nintendo Wii.
2255999	2257700	That's coming over here in February, I believe.
2258300	2258481	Is it?
2258501	2259161	The Capcom one.
2260954	2267259	Also coming out on other systems, we have the PlayStation 2 gets Hakarina Heart comes out as well as Spectral Gene.
2268100	2269801	And that's all the PS2 gets this week.
2270942	2278008	And coming out on the Nintendo DS, Fujinomori no Let's Tarot is coming out.
2278309	2278609	What?
2279189	2280711	I wonder if that's a tarot card game.
2280731	2282432	I don't know.
2283253	2287076	And Kurukuru Princess, Yumi no White Quartet comes out.
2288308	2290469	I need to put up that picture I took of you at Best Buy.
2311531	2312711	Oh, with Imagine Babies?
2312891	2314712	Yeah, we've got Imagine Babies.
2314932	2315692	Very interesting game.
2315952	2320673	Yes, Fujinomori No Let's Tarot does look to be a tarot card game for the DS.
2320713	2321433	That sounds like fun.
2321493	2322154	Jamie wants.
2322454	2328175	And Shanghai is indeed a version of the old Mahjong classic on the Nintendo Wii.
2328235	2328995	It is indeed that.
2329235	2331656	So, there you have it, your Japanese release dates.
2332616	2335597	Well, for our friends in the UK, not a whole bunch is coming out.
2336897	2339038	On the 14th is Beowulf.
2340238	2340678	Excuse me.
2341565	2346507	Half-Life 2 Episode 2, Portal, Team Fortress 2, The Orange Box Wait, didn't I already do these?
2347627	2348527	You know it says December.
2350028	2352148	I'm like, okay, it's being all bizarre.
2353108	2357950	Yeah, Beowulf, Half-Life 2 Episode 2, Portal, Team Fortress 2, and then The Orange Box.
2358410	2360051	They are releasing them separately.
2360391	2362551	Time Shift and Wipeout Pulse.
2363532	2368053	And of course all of the Half-Life related things were on PlayStation 3.
2370791	2372672	Alright, kind of a slow week over in the UK.
2372972	2373313	Yep.
2373653	2373913	Oh well.
2374713	2376975	Maybe it'll get a little more busy before the end of the year.
2377895	2381037	Or at least early next year when they start getting all the stuff that we got this year.
2381197	2382238	Poor guys over there.
2383398	2388941	I will be more than happy to send gifts overseas if people send me... Money!
2389662	2390002	...boos.
2390903	2391163	Alright.
2391223	2392203	I want Christmas crackers.
2393664	2395025	Let's get back into the gaming news.
2395606	2400330	Anyways, it's another week, so that means there must be another Korean MMO coming.
2401751	2405274	And this time, it's going to be a game called Perfect KO.
2405774	2411999	It's actually a fighting game MMO, and it's got an unlikely duo of characters that are going to be making their way to it.
2413120	2418164	And those two characters, of course, would be Ken and Chung-Li from the Street Fighter series.
2418825	2420066	It actually looks kind of neat.
2420226	2423048	It's sort of like a 3D brawl game or something like that.
2423775	2429556	and then of course as you beat up more people you can customize your avatar and that kind of fun stuff.
2430696	2435037	But that's kind of neat to see that they're actually licensing characters from Capcom.
2435077	2437118	Hopefully they'll license characters from some other things.
2439878	2440558	That's going to be interesting.
2440578	2443059	What other kind of characters are in this game besides Ken and Tony?
2443239	2444479	They didn't really mention.
2444599	2448140	It's a lot of stuff that they've designed themselves but the character designs are really cool.
2449740	2450480	So, you know...
2450953	2456715	It'd be nice to see, like, some of these characters from this Korean game, like, move over to, say, like, Street Fighter 4 or something like that.
2457556	2460997	Well, speaking of Street Fighter 4, there were a lot of new details released this week.
2461057	2465299	First off, I've got to ask, though, did you hear about the drama going on behind the Street Fighter 4 news?
2466319	2474923	You know, this Brazilian news site put out these screenshots from Street Fighter 4, these new screenshots besides the one we'd seen previously.
2475523	2480605	They put out some new screenshots and, you know, one-up sick the lawyers on them, or Zip Davis would say sick the lawyers on them.
2481005	2486546	and people were like, you know, rah, rah, rah, the corporation's taking down the independent voice.
2486626	2488767	And certainly I was kind of going, you know, a little bit of that too.
2488807	2490407	I'm like, boy, those bastards, da, da, da.
2490847	2500510	But at the same time, it turns out, who knew that actually the leak came from the fact that the person that runs that website is some type of contractor for EGM in Brazil.
2500590	2504370	So he actually did steal internal information, I guess, ended up admitting to it.
2504871	2506871	So I don't know why he did that.
2507389	2508390	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2532466	2535869	and EGM's not happy about it because this is how they were going to sell their magazines this week.
2536349	2538431	The game will actually run at 60 frames per second.
2538871	2543595	The storyline takes place between Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo and Street Fighter 3.
2544456	2546398	Lots of old school characters will return.
2546798	2551262	There's going to be two new female characters but no characters from Street Fighter 3.
2552282	2555705	So you kind of wonder if Capcom isn't just kind of writing off Street Fighter 3 in a way.
2555725	2560809	You should have brought like what was that guy's name Oro back but he can have both of his arms this time.
2560969	2561610	You know like
2562005	2562566	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2581221	2587222	As most people speculated, the screenshots that you do see in the pictures floating around the internet right now is Chun-Li's new stage.
2587862	2590803	The parry system that was in Street Fighter 3, gone.
2591383	2596284	New system in place, it's called Saving Revenge, something like that, some new system is in place.
2596884	2601325	It's built around cancels, and there will be its own gauge that's separate from the super meter.
2601665	2605986	There are supers in the game, don't know if it's Street Fighter 3s or Super Street Fighter 2 turbos.
2606326	2607607	There's also ultras!
2608027	2609607	My god, there's lots of different types of moves.
2609967	2611068	Here's the other weird thing.
2611568	2614009	Shang Long may actually be in the game.
2615170	2622574	But there's kind of a may, and we don't know if that's just a running gag from EGM, because that was like one of their first April Fool's jokes, like years ago.
2623015	2626117	Back when I used to get that magazine delivered to my house, like 15 years ago.
2626397	2627277	Back when it was good.
2627998	2629338	Back in the day, certainly.
2631045	2638750	And rumor is we will see Street Fighter 4 in the arcades with online play, also in the PlayStation 3 and 360, all of them online.
2639070	2642132	Wouldn't it be cool if the console versions interfaced with the arcade somehow?
2643353	2648836	Of course, then you kind of wonder why would anybody go to the arcade, but community, and maybe there'll be something special with the arcade version.
2648856	2654560	If it did, it'd probably be only with the PlayStation 3 version, since you've got live, and live isn't cross-platform very easily.
2655188	2658071	Well, they got Final Fantasy XI to work somehow, so it's possible.
2658111	2663676	Yeah, but see, Final Fantasy XI runs off the Square Enix servers because you're connecting to PlayOnline.
2663836	2665378	That's totally separate.
2665398	2667760	That's why you have to pay that stupid monthly fee.
2668701	2676008	So anyways, obviously take some of that stuff with a grain of salt in regards to Shang Long and the online arcade stuff.
2676408	2677509	Take all that with a grain of salt.
2677569	2680031	But it does sound, as far as the rest of it, that it's pretty cemented.
2681132	2682613	The 60 frames a second and stuff.
2682673	2684214	It sounds like it's going to be a winner.
2684734	2688716	So I have to say I'm already a little more excited about Street Fighter 4 than I ever was about Street Fighter 3.
2688896	2689656	It looks pretty good.
2689676	2692158	I like the art style in it.
2692498	2697460	I was kind of crossing my fingers that it would be more like the trailer because that was really cool.
2698020	2699521	But the art style is okay.
2699781	2702482	I like what they're doing where it's 3D but it's 2D type thing.
2703563	2709886	Some of the facial animations though that they had, like some of the screenshots, a little weird.
2710669	2713111	It looks a little wonky, but I think you'll be fine.
2714171	2716412	Jamie, I know you've been a Street Fighter fan for ages and ages.
2717153	2718334	Are you happy about Street Fighter 4?
2719154	2722096	I'm reserving judgment until I actually play it.
2722476	2724377	Okay, so you're not letting the hype get to you at all?
2724597	2725578	Nope.
2725818	2726298	Fair enough.
2726558	2732522	I still think that it's only going to take a week before a bunch of fighting game fans completely break the system.
2734034	2734834	If it is online?
2735375	2736735	Oh, not just online.
2736815	2737936	I mean, just the game itself.
2737956	2740176	That's not dedicated there.
2740197	2741797	They'll break any fighting game system.
2741857	2743278	Figure out how to cheat real quick.
2744158	2744518	We'll see.
2745138	2745739	We will see.
2745799	2747359	Anyway, let's move on to some more news.
2749440	2755482	Well, for the Xbox Originals, they are, well, region locked.
2755703	2756543	You can't get past it.
2759211	2762313	Where the Japanese demos are working, the games themselves are not.
2762733	2764094	There's no such thing as can't.
2764394	2765215	That's what I say.
2766215	2770358	Just not now is what Loki is hoping for this.
2770639	2772060	But they got some extra games in Japan.
2772100	2775162	Well, not necessarily extra, but they got different games in Japan than we got here.
2775622	2776743	Here's the problem.
2776983	2777743	Go ahead.
2777884	2782647	Well, they actually tested, for example, with Magatama.
2782687	2786910	They said that they got a message that said the download was not available in your region.
2788951	2792073	Well, I think it's because it's either looking at one of two things.
2792153	2796615	It's either looking at the region of your console, which case, yeah, you're kind of screwed then.
2797855	2799896	Or it's looking at the region of your IP.
2800356	2807740	If that's the case, you could probably just route your IP through a mirror, say, somewhere overseas, and then it might work.
2808240	2811341	But I'm guessing it's looking at the region of your console, because that would make more sense.
2812122	2812742	But it's weird, though.
2812782	2814723	It just won't let you download it whatsoever.
2816135	2816696	Who cares?
2816736	2817918	It's a fucking Xbox game.
2817958	2818399	Seriously.
2819281	2821905	I mean, if you... I don't know.
2823128	2824109	It's an Xbox game.
2824430	2825552	Do you really need to download it?
2825672	2825993	It's old.
2826534	2826814	Please don't...
2828015	2828596	I don't know.
2828696	2844651	I'm noticing that because of the old Xbox games coming back, I've had a lot of friends tell me that Indigo Prophecy, kind of a game that may have been, I don't want to say overlooked, because it certainly had its fans, but overlooked by many, is kind of getting a little bit of a resurgence with this.
2844691	2849956	And I've had people actually send me messages on Xbox Live going, dude, you need to check out Indigo Prophecy if you haven't already played it before.
2849976	2850617	It's kind of fun.
2852202	2853563	Buy it in the stores, people.
2853623	2855764	It's probably cheaper than buying it online.
2856525	2859206	Seriously, and then you get the disc and maybe a manual.
2860147	2865210	I mean, instead of having to read a PDF file online, you know, just go look.
2865370	2868492	This stuff is so old, it's probably dirt cheap by now.
2869773	2870893	I guess there's one way to find out.
2870913	2871854	You've got to go out there and shop.
2871914	2873015	Oh, you want to hear something funny?
2873035	2875436	What is it?
2876917	2877237	Shut up.
2877778	2878158	Anyways...
2879127	2884489	Catamari Damacy, that game when it came out, that was like a $20 game, wasn't it?
2885409	2886350	The original one on PlayStation 2?
2886390	2886550	Yeah.
2886630	2887570	Yeah, it was a budget game, $20 game.
2887590	2888490	Somebody used a GameStop for $30.
2888550	2889811	I'm like, $10 over retail and it's used.
2896642	2897082	Right.
2897202	2899223	But that's because they don't make it retail anymore, right?
2899243	2900163	It doesn't matter, though.
2900483	2901703	It should still be cheap.
2901943	2905044	Well, what about, okay, what about, like, freaking old-ass PlayStation 1 games?
2905064	2908064	Like, for the longest time, Intelligent Cube, they were charging an arm and a leg for.
2908384	2914686	Symphony of the Night, before it was out on Xbox Live, they were charging... But I didn't think Katamari, the first one, had a really high demand for it.
2914746	2918527	And, like, Street Fighter, was it Marvel vs. Street Fighter 2?
2918647	2920967	That's going for, you know, quite a bit.
2921447	2924268	But... Or Marvel vs. Capcom 2.
2925108	2925488	But, um...
2926058	2932022	I didn't think Katamari was going to bring in demand of $10 over retail, especially used.
2934964	2937245	Well, let's go ahead and move on with the news.
2937745	2941648	Anyways, there's yet another stupid lawsuit that goes...
2942438	2943338	It goes with Halo 3.
2943398	2945999	It's like, Halo 3, more stupid lawsuits.
2946379	2952240	This time, some dumb shit is complaining that there's not a lot of, um, there's some pixels missing, apparently.
2952601	2957302	Because, apparently, Halo 3, you know, is upscaled 600, or 640p, I guess.
2957682	2962463	It's missing 80 pixels, and they explain why they did that and stuff.
2962483	2967764	So now they're suing because it's not truly 720p.
2967784	2969665	And they're saying it's false advertising.
2969905	2970105	What?
2970125	2970205	What?
2971624	2972245	For real?
2972905	2973966	This person's for real?
2974887	2983993	It's sad, and, you know what, I heard about this, and I actually looked at the back of the box, and on the back it just says, HDTV, you know, 720p, 1080i, 1080p.
2984013	2990058	It doesn't explicitly say, this game runs natively in these formats.
2990358	2991279	But what game does?
2991699	2992220	None of them do.
2992640	2993260	No, none of them.
2993581	2997283	And here's the thing, is I would say, okay, why don't you count the pixels that are on your TV there?
2997303	2997524	720 of them?
2997564	2997844	Okay, shut up.
3001451	3005754	So they're trying to say it's false advertising because the game wasn't programmed in 720 or whatever.
3005814	3006794	Whatever, dude.
3006814	3009116	That is seriously a stupid complaint.
3010176	3011217	That's going to get thrown out.
3012198	3012698	I hope so.
3013999	3019742	Well, all I know is that all these freaking Halo 3 lawsuits, god damn they make us mad.
3019862	3021183	And when we get mad, people die.
3037088	3040429	It is time for my annual Christmas FU.
3042130	3046091	It's a combination of everything about the holiday season that pisses me off.
3047732	3061336	So, and again, it's all pretty ridiculous, you know, I'm not attacking anybody, but first of all, the people who over-decorate their houses that look like Christmas puked all over their house, oh my god, learn what aesthetics are for!
3061996	3063377	Seriously, what about that tree?
3064509	3067830	Did I not tell you that tree was hideous?
3068030	3068310	Okay.
3069570	3071870	And Rob put it best when he told me about it at first.
3072370	3077231	The whole top part of the tree is not lit because probably a light bulb burnt out.
3077271	3084533	There's this ginormous tree in front of a church and it's like it's not wearing a top because a bulb burned out at the top of the tree or something.
3084593	3085493	This is what I think though.
3085513	3086453	I don't think that's it.
3086573	3090634	I think they just actually didn't decorate it because there's different types of lights.
3091074	3091234	There's
3091892	3092733	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3112143	3113924	We have some tacky Christmas lights here in the studio.
3114344	3115024	That's cute.
3115624	3118485	You know, I can, like, the icicle lights are nice.
3119005	3123126	Maybe having a Santa in your front yard or decorating a tree in your front yard.
3123626	3126527	But, like, this is the worst example ever.
3126547	3133349	And it's one house that was in Mobile, Alabama that I saw right before probably the year I moved out.
3134009	3139430	And that was these people who shunned Christmas lights all over their yard, across their yard, in patches.
3139851	3141271	Their house freaking glowed.
3142102	3153862	and I was like and on top of that they were all multicolored so it looked like that cut like just like throw up I'm not joking and that originated the phrase Christmas threw up on that house I saw a very offensive house last night
3154458	3165905	and it was one of those houses where they had the radio station playing and you tune your car to a certain frequency on the radio and then you can, like, the lights flash in sync with the music.
3166406	3166686	Right?
3166986	3174011	Okay, but it's hideous because if you don't have the radio station turned on it just looks like this house is randomly flashing all of their lights.
3174791	3180753	and I swear to God I almost had a seizure driving by that house.
3180793	3181393	It's not funny.
3181753	3189815	Seriously, somebody is going to crash into that house and all the kids in that house are going to be in a fire because that house is going to cause somebody to have a seizure.
3190535	3192936	On top of that, imagine these people's freaking power bill.
3195838	3223950	and another part of my FU goes towards people who are thinking that Christmas is actually only the celebration that happens around this year when there's a bunch of different religions that celebrate around the same time every year and that really Christmas should actually be in like spring if you're going by quote biblical standards because the census would have happened in the spring and you guys stole a pagan holiday thank you Catholic Church but you know
3225285	3231507	You can address those cards and letters to Jamie What about the people that have the big inflatable snow globes in their front lawn?
3231527	3232807	You gotta love that shit, huh?
3233127	3250153	Okay, I don't mind one but I drove by a house that had three and a giant inflatable Santa whose legs were broken so he was laying on his nose This is in my neighborhood That's a prime target for a BB gun Someone broke Santa's legs?
3250273	3254314	That's not very nice Someone broke Santa's legs Santa didn't give some mobsters presents this year
3255679	3265070	But no, there's just, you know, I really... It's the whole over-commercialism of everything and the fact that people get so close-minded.
3265130	3267692	Okay, here's part three of my Christmas FU.
3267732	3268353	Oh, Christ.
3268954	3269514	Drivers!
3270235	3275601	Because I can't do an FU without bringing up how stupidly mean people get during the holidays.
3276922	3277243	Okay.
3278836	3289325	I went to buy something at the store, and this person's pushing past me buying their Christmas tree, and I'm like, I was in line for... I'm like, shit!
3289985	3295890	And then everybody drives like a freaking retard on the road because they have to get to the mall.
3297051	3301174	And it's just like, okay, what happened to the whole, you know...
3302114	3309955	Being nice to everybody during the holidays and trying to share the spirit and everything because people don't give a shit about the Christmas spirit.
3309975	3311716	They care about their own personal agenda.
3312556	3315836	You know, maybe there should be more ball shootings if that were the case.
3316116	3317317	Whoa, whoa.
3319177	3320237	I wouldn't go there.
3320377	3321517	Wow, too soon.
3322077	3322598	Too soon.
3322618	3323158	No, no, no, no.
3323618	3330659	But this is the whole thing is that, you know, people are, you know, and I'm getting this from the same people where we're all like,
3331466	3337651	Oh, well, you know, holiday this, you know, have to be nice, baby Jesus, whatever.
3338151	3341514	And then these same people are being complete and utter assholes.
3342014	3344616	And I'm not even, you know, making this up.
3344656	3347098	I'm seeing people that I know do this.
3347639	3351402	And I'm like, God, what a freaking hypocrite, you know?
3352723	3352903	Just...
3353746	3355670	Don't open your mouth around me ever again.
3355690	3357613	All right, quick chat room comments.
3357633	3362182	SSJ100Matt says, Apparently, the higher your energy bill, the more Jesus and God love you.
3364226	3364867	That's brilliant.
3365027	3366390	All right, let's move on with the FUs.
3367417	3374702	Anyways, FU to the kids across the street from my apartment complex who were having car wash today.
3375183	3378685	They started at about 9 this morning yelling.
3378825	3384829	Oh, by the way, there was also one of those cars, you know, the ones that have the sound systems that are way too loud with way too much bass.
3385250	3390253	That was playing from 9 in the morning to about 5 in the afternoons.
3391605	3393486	and these kids yelling CARWASH!
3393806	3394806	CARWASH!
3395366	3395706	CARWASH!
3395886	3397946	for like seven fucking hours.
3398447	3402467	I mean, it's just so annoying all day long.
3403388	3415310	Oh, and then also I have to do my neighbors who apparently thought it was fun to have a party at four in the morning with their drunken friends who are riding a bike that some kid left outside and they're honking the horn on the bike.
3416930	3418911	Wow, you live in a classy part of town.
3419251	3419951	That sucks.
3420575	3420875	That's it.
3422496	3423417	Puppy, why don't you go ahead.
3425439	3430623	Big F you to ITT Technical Institute and your terrible scheduling policies.
3433004	3436587	I started my program for drafting last year.
3437368	3447155	I should have been done by now, but I'm not going to graduate until six months from now because when I changed my schedule once, it completely fucked me over for the rest of the year.
3447791	3448812	Thank you for watching!
3469434	3471175	I'm actually kind of having a good week.
3471616	3474839	So I guess F you to the fact that it's been so cold lately.
3475319	3476120	I'll give an F you to that.
3476160	3477601	My house has been very cold lately.
3478682	3482485	And, you know, since we live in California, we're very spoiled when it comes to cold.
3482965	3485828	And just the slightest bit of cold air, it's like, oh my god, get a jacket!
3486688	3488550	F you to magazine solicitors, too.
3489030	3491012	I had three of them on my door this week.
3492453	3495516	Somebody came to my door last night and I told them that I had the flu.
3496303	3498604	and that I was highly contagious and he really should leave.
3498624	3503104	You guys are crazy.
3503565	3505665	He just looked at me like, okay, bye.
3506625	3506905	Wow.
3507185	3508045	I should have thought of that.
3508746	3515327	Around in this neighborhood they just have the kids do all the soliciting because it's kind of hard to tell a kid that you're going to give them a bubonic plague if they don't get off your doorstep.
3516227	3519328	Or you just open your door wearing nothing but a towel.
3519948	3524709	I still though have my favorite story about my friend with the Jehovah's Witnesses.
3526511	3529972	While she was listening to tubular bells... Oh, we gotta get back in the news.
3530772	3531812	Making a red velvet cake.
3531853	3537154	So she came out with this knife with, like, red fluid on it and said, What?!
3542916	3544696	This is my friend that used to work for Lockheed.
3545536	3546637	Alright, let's move on.
3546657	3547877	We gotta get back to gaming news.
3548837	3549297	Weirdos.
3549738	3550058	All right.
3550738	3553360	Oh, and what a heck of a story to get back into.
3553960	3557903	Yes, our buddy Jeff Gertzman, which took up about an hour of last week's show.
3557943	3564948	We have some quick updates, and I don't want to spend too much time talking in this, because I'll be goddamn if this story just didn't blow up way more than it should have.
3564968	3565508	You got fired.
3565548	3565928	Get over it.
3566189	3566729	Yeah, exactly.
3567533	3569434	Anyhow... Was it that crap you were talking about?
3569494	3572694	Yeah, I was trying to catch Jamie up on what happened when she was out.
3573575	3575575	So, anyhow, here's your updates.
3576135	3577716	I should have some music that plays during this.
3577736	3578656	Hold on, I need music.
3579376	3584037	Jamie, why don't you give us your thoughts on the issue while we get some happy music to play during the Gersman... Happy music?
3584057	3585318	Should we play some Linkin Park?
3585338	3586598	There's too much updates.
3587038	3590679	Oh, it's too bad that I don't have this song from End of Evangelion.
3592615	3593816	The Happy Suicide Song.
3594097	3594557	Alright, hold on.
3595258	3597520	We'll play some happy music here while we give you the Jeff Gertzman updates.
3597540	3597780	I got it.
3597800	3597960	Alright.
3604130	3616061	This week in Gertzmanville, Gertzman made a comment to Joystick.com saying, quote, I stand behind my work regardless of where I do it.
3616521	3620845	If there was content that I felt I couldn't support, it wouldn't see the light of day.
3621606	3625749	Then later on, this week, GameSpot posted a Q&A.
3627113	3628754	Here's a clip from the Q&A.
3629014	3631676	Question, was Eidos Interactive upset by the game's review?
3632216	3639361	Answer, it has been confirmed that Eidos representatives expressed their displeasure to their appropriate contacts at GameSpot, but not to editorial directly.
3639861	3644044	It was not the first time a publisher has voiced disappointment with a game review, and it won't be the last.
3644464	3651967	However, it is strict GameSpot policy never to let any such feelings result in a review score to be altered or a video review to be pulled.
3652668	3655569	Also, I'd like to quote Mr. Horse from Eidos.
3655789	3658010	He said, No, sir, I do not like it.
3661772	3668415	In response to the GameSpot Q&A, the users of GameSpot said, Thank you, you assholes, for posting that a whole four days late.
3669324	3680231	Then later on this week, as if no more could go wrong with Kane and Lynch, the review site got criticized by, I'm sorry, the reviews got criticized by Kotaku.
3680291	3690338	They were posting clips of reviews, one of the clips happened to be from Kotaku, and it had a five-star logo above the review, which makes you think, five-star review!
3691139	3697083	But in fact, the five stars were just a graphic, and Kotaku was pissed off because they don't review games in stars.
3698442	3699763	They don't review games, period.
3701084	3702985	So, that's from a preview of the game.
3703526	3706908	And that's your update on what's going on in Gertzmanville.
3708629	3710190	And to be honest, I don't really care anymore.
3710270	3712112	Now, stop caring.
3712172	3713212	Hey, Rob?
3713292	3714693	I didn't care in the first place.
3714753	3715434	I'm glad to hear it.
3715814	3719457	That's because you're all better people than I. That's because I wasn't here, thank God.
3719757	3722078	Alright.
3722619	3725421	Let's move on then, past Gertzman Gate, if we could.
3725701	3727002	Well, I have something that's
3727631	3730734	A little happy, except that I think that it was already there.
3731874	3736458	There's a press release come out from Gravity that they've opened a U.S.
3736538	3743704	studio under the name of L5 Games, and they've hired Blizzard folks to help run it.
3744144	3753472	But the thing is that, now it says that it's in San Mateo, but I actually remember trying to report Gravity to the Better Business Bureau.
3756554	3757115	The fuck?
3758220	3765862	When I was still on IRO because of some sort of banning of an account that was falsely done.
3766683	3767643	This was a long time ago.
3768003	3773165	But I was trying to find the stuff for somebody to report them to the Better Business Bureau.
3773885	3780667	And it turned out that every time I tried to pull up the address for them, it came up with a San Mateo address.
3782167	3784168	But this was like six years ago.
3784867	3785507	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3812384	3817405	And it was pretty much because of, you know, all the crappy feedback that came out.
3818925	3820446	That's why we have Better Business Bureau.
3821086	3822226	They just supply feedback.
3822706	3824026	Gravity's just coming over to the U.S.
3824046	3826727	I got free food because I reported a restaurant to the Better Business Bureau.
3827907	3830748	They're going to increase their presence in the U.S.
3830808	3833388	so that Gravity can single-handedly take on Activision Blizzard.
3834589	3835469	That's what it is, right?
3836489	3837109	Good luck.
3837969	3838269	All right.
3839370	3841270	I'll stick with my, you know, private servers.
3841290	3841550	Thank you.
3842116	3844477	Anyways, let's see here.
3846518	3849940	You know, sometimes you might compare gravity to sucking, you know.
3850520	3856543	There's service and stuff, so, well, here's something else that sucks, or that probably will suck.
3856764	3857824	The Castlevania movie!
3858544	3860686	And, yeah, like, okay, let me put it this way.
3860946	3863327	And this will save us a lot of time in the future.
3864290	3870076	Every single movie that's probably being written right now is on hold because of the writer's strike.
3870116	3873619	Because you have no writer, you can't have any story being written.
3874240	3880686	So, like that, the Castlevania movie is on hold because of the writer's strike.
3882207	3886211	Not that it's like, it's on hold from sucking, I guess.
3886411	3888914	I don't know, it's like,
3889741	3890221	Thanks for watching!
3913477	3914377	or 200 and some episodes.
3914397	3916998	What episode are we on?
3917018	3916998	250?
3917198	3919239	259.
3917298	3919239	I've been doing 100 more episodes, Sammy.
3919259	3920980	I've been working way too damn hard.
3921200	3923021	Not recording one of them, but you know what?
3923121	3923961	I do it for practice.
3928603	3929023	Okay.
3930410	3938477	I was going to make some joke about somebody actually writes those video game movies, but anyway, I totally lost it amongst Loki's high sense of sarcasm.
3938857	3942741	So why don't we spoil the VGAs, which are going on right now on the TV?
3943501	3946424	Yes, did you know we're competing against the VGAs tonight, our live stream?
3946844	3948365	So here, why don't we ruin it for you?
3948425	3949967	Bioshock, one game of the year.
3950647	3954731	Harmonix got Studio of the Year, Best Shooter, Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare.

4003888	4005188	I mean, sponsored by you.
4005348	4007509	Although I think that was just a joke, actually.
4007829	4014050	So there, we just did you a favor and saved you from sitting through three hours of garbage advertisements and musical performances.
4014210	4014750	There you have it.
4015350	4017390	You can send us the thank you cards.
4017530	4018671	You can send us Christmas cards.
4018691	4027632	To play devil's advocate here and not to pull you away from listening to our wonderful show, but they are going to have a new trailer for Borderlands, which looks pretty awesome.
4027852	4029413	It'll be on YouTube tomorrow.
4030073	4031273	But it looks awesome!
4032305	4034806	It'll look awesome tomorrow on YouTube.
4037167	4043430	Well, going on a tangent with Spike TV, yesterday I was watching a marathon of one of their reality shows because I was bored.
4043470	4043891	Cheaters?
4044131	4045792	No, it was the Ultimate Fighter.
4047032	4050774	It was leading up to their finale UFC thing last night.
4051234	4059138	For eight straight hours, it was nothing but teasing about, oh, we're going to show the cinematic opening to World of Warcraft during the UFC event.
4059773	4066118	and it was the original opening from, you know, three years, it's three years old and they're going to show this on live TV at a UFC event.
4067379	4070441	I couldn't, I couldn't think of a worse audience to target that at.
4071262	4071742	Chat comments.
4071782	4073023	It wasn't for the new expansion.
4074444	4077746	No, it was the original cinematic opening to the World of Warcraft.
4077806	4078727	It wasn't Burning Crusade.
4079968	4081469	Comment from, comment from chat.
4081509	4089075	Dark Tetsuya said, the Spike Video Game Awards have been sponsored by Harmonix, 2K Games, EA Sports, it's in the game, and by Mountain Dew, do the dew.
4092843	4096446	So, in stuff that people actually care about... Yes.
4097447	4100649	How about Silent Hill news?
4101290	4101650	Ah, yes.
4101890	4102371	Yes, please.
4102451	4103432	More Silent Hill 5 news?
4104553	4106554	Well, more like Silent Hill Origins.
4106814	4107175	Ah, okay.
4107275	4110678	They're talking about it having a PlayStation 2 port.
4111719	4112539	Oh, that'll be kind of fun.
4112819	4113840	Yeah, that'll be pretty cool.
4114761	4117984	They're saying that it would...
4118986	4129009	It's actually, of course, being published by Climax, and they would also be presenting a second release.
4131170	4135831	That would be kind of nice, because Silent Hill is one of those games I can't really get into on a handheld platform.
4135871	4141493	It's kind of something I need on a very large TV with all the lights out, so I can cry like a little girl when the monsters come out to eat me.
4141735	4147358	Yeah, but you see, all you have to do is just get one of those nice PSPs with the video out, and then you can play it on your TV.
4147518	4149600	Oh, that's true, but I don't have that because I'm not cool.
4149960	4154943	Well, the second thing that they're working on is actually an unannounced project.
4156083	4156503	Dun, dun, dun.
4156523	4157744	I hope it's more final now.
4157764	4158765	Didn't they just announce it?
4160486	4160946	Was that it?
4161386	4162147	I don't think that was it.
4162287	4166029	Because if you announce an unannounced project, isn't that announcing the project?
4166434	4167975	How about an untitled project?
4167995	4168335	There you go.
4168615	4172798	Or I should say a secret project because it may have a title.
4172838	4173739	We just don't know what it is.
4174999	4177181	It's not secret anymore if you just talked about it.
4178301	4180743	Macman in our chat room says something interesting here.
4181023	4184665	Macman says Silent Hill 5 equals awesome and win and shit in my pants.
4186486	4188388	What kind of comment is that?
4190329	4193551	Gerardimo says Silent Hill needs to go steal all the VGAs.
4194580	4195140	Yes, I agree.
4195340	4197822	Pyramid Head needs to come do an acceptance speech.
4199523	4200804	He'll make it with his big knife.
4200984	4201484	That's right.
4202505	4203685	To the entire front row.
4204786	4206447	We'll have to wait until next year then, I guess.
4208808	4209709	Wouldn't that be a dream?
4210149	4213991	Anyways, people are up in arms because GameTap's removing games.
4214291	4215112	No.
4216198	4223042	Some games you will not be able to play in GameTap anymore include Arthur's First Grade, Bionic Bunny's Good Deeds Contest.
4223222	4227344	Okay, now hold the fuck up because there are actually some good games on that list, Loki.
4227444	4228505	Stop being such a dick.
4230406	4233808	There was, I think one of the Civilization games is on there.
4236009	4236309	No.
4237470	4238410	I know there's games on there.
4238550	4239891	Impossible Mission was on there.
4240874	4241854	Oh, Impossible Mission.
4241955	4243275	Oh, my mistake.
4243315	4244175	That game's cool.
4244235	4244916	You shut your mouth.
4244996	4248077	Anyways, yes, such wonderful games as Chip's Challenge.
4248357	4250938	Does anyone remember that from Windows 3.1?
4252239	4253039	Command & Conquer.
4253119	4253999	Okay, that was a pretty good game.
4254600	4259782	Command & Conquer Red Alert, Descent, 2, 3, and Free Space.
4260262	4261982	Oh, all the Ultima games are going offline.
4262283	4264143	Earthworm Jim, Earthworm Jim 2, Earthworm Jim 3D.
4268047	4272571	Free Space 2, Impossible Mission 2, MDK.
4272611	4273532	That was pretty good.
4274413	4275874	C. Jerk.
4276094	4276614	Whatever.
4277135	4278997	And then other games like Pajama Sam.
4279057	4280898	Life is rough when you lose stuff.
4282139	4284922	Or Pajama Sam.
4285062	4287404	You are what you eat from your head to your feet.
4291127	4291768	Pajama Sam.
4292108	4293889	Games to play on any day.
4294009	4294430	All right.
4295919	4305806	Well, obviously, though, it's kind of sad, because some of those games, like, even you admit, MDK and some of that stuff is kind of cool, that the service is losing, and a lot of people are like, oh, no, why is GameTap deleting games?
4305826	4310350	Well, I think the answer is probably just as simple as Time's Up, you know, they probably have these signed agreements.
4310430	4312391	Well, actually, their licensing's up with that, you know.
4312712	4314093	This will also make someone sad.
4314153	4314913	American Deer Hunting 2000.
4315013	4319857	Okay, aren't all the games that are being pulled, like, most of them come from one or two different companies, right?
4319897	4323600	Like, EA is one of them, and there's, I think, another one, and...
4324560	4328923	I think this probably just kind of screams that EA is probably going to do their own thing.
4329744	4332826	Or EA is going to be signing a deal with somebody else soon where they're getting more money.
4332966	4335949	Some of the sim games are leaving, like SimTunes.
4335989	4337610	I didn't even realize there was a SimTunes.
4338050	4345916	SimTower, SimSafari, SimPark, SimCity2000, SimCityClassic, Tetris.
4346817	4347057	See?
4347237	4348218	There's some good stuff leaving.
4349079	4349619	Whatever.
4350300	4353122	Seriously, it's like winter games.
4354702	4356303	Alright, well, we'll see what happens.
4356343	4360426	Who knows, maybe EA is going to be starting their own competing service soon, or... Damn it!
4360466	4361066	Somebody else, what?
4361727	4364949	PuttPunzle's Fun Shop is gone!
4365469	4366690	What am I going to play now?
4368572	4377518	Also, I want to say, it kind of sucks for them because they just had this big brouhaha over, hooray, we hit our 1,000th game, and now losing these 70 games is going to put them back under 1,000.
4377558	4381981	So I think it would be funny if in January they say, we hit our 1,000th game again!
4383442	4383922	They should.
4384295	4385336	That would be hilarious.
4386317	4386638	Alright.
4388320	4389361	Anyhow, let's...
4390526	4391547	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4415248	4416289	The Game of the Week is Threads of Fate.
4440097	4440557	Duprism Big Fat Axe
4463838	4468240	And, um, it's really, it actually had pretty good graphics for being an old PlayStation game.
4468320	4472762	It was really simple for how it played, but it was really fun.
4473582	4480965	And I actually tried to play, I actually started playing through Duprism, and then when Threads of Fate came out, um, I had to just go out and get it.
4481045	4484487	So, and I actually found my copy of it the other day, which made me think about it.
4485107	4489549	It was just a really cool little game, and it had its own, um, pretty good following overseas, too.
4490579	4502027	to the point where there was a fan version of a sequel called Duo Princess where you play as the Princess Mint and her sister Maya.
4502227	4503108	So it was pretty good.
4506090	4507471	I really just love this game.
4508792	4518139	But it came out the same time that Vagrant Story, Legend of Mana, Chrono Cross, and Parasite 2 came out.
4518739	4519860	So it's sort of
4521260	4521980	Duprism Threads of Fate
4549959	4551359	I did not play this game, but I should.
4551599	4552400	You can borrow my copy.
4552720	4554440	Because I played some of those other games you mentioned.
4555040	4558681	Wasn't that also the same time that horrible, horrible mana game came out on PSP?
4558721	4560421	That was Legend of Mana.
4560501	4561722	Oh, God, that game was awful.
4562022	4562902	I hated Legend of Mana.
4563442	4568363	I have the Japanese version of Legend of Mana, and I was like, too much text.
4569303	4570523	I read 30 kanji.
4570624	4571644	I can't read this game.
4571984	4572384	So, yeah.
4572624	4572864	All right.
4573488	4577450	Now we're going to take a quick break and we're going to come back in a little bit with more of Orange Launch Radio.
4577470	4579392	For those of you guys on the podcast, we'll be back in a couple days.
4579692	4581693	For those of you guys listening live, we'll be back in a little bit.
4581833	4584815	And Loki, for some reason, appears to be hooking up the Nintendo Wii.
4585535	4586756	I don't know what the hell this is going to bring.
4587696	4588417	Out here in studio.
4588437	4590038	Okay, Loki's going to play something during break.
4590398	4593020	So we'll be back in a little bit with more of Orange Launch Radio.
4594621	4595381	Yeah, so stay tuned.
4596175	4601141	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice a week.
