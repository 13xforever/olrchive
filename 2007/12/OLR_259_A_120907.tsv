0	19520	Tonight, December 9th, 2007, new details emerge on Street Fighter IV.
19520	35840	Nintendo gets a ninja party next year, and this game tap started removing games?
35840	49840	We are that gaming show, podcast, blogcast, Zoom cast, whatever you're into, thing dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
49840	51840	My name is Rob Roberts. Welcome back to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
51840	52840	Hi.
52840	53840	How are you doing, Jamie?
53840	55840	I'm almost full.
55840	59840	Yes, almost what you've been eating, of course, in traditional Jamie tradition.
59840	61840	I pick up my dinner on the way to the show.
61840	62840	That's good, that's good.
62840	64840	Otherwise, I would have just had beans.
64840	68840	I cram food in after the show before I go to bed, which is probably how I got fat.
68840	72840	It's not very healthy. You should not eat three hours before you go to bed.
72840	74840	It isn't, and then I shouldn't swim either.
74840	76840	I did nothing but eat.
76840	77840	So how was Alabama?
77840	78840	I did nothing but eat.
78840	82840	You did in Alabama, too? Good times.
82840	95840	I went to Alabama with sauce, and we stayed at my grandma's house and ate a lot of Blue Bell ice cream and watched a bunch of movies and had a Cracker Barrel in Waffle House.
95840	97840	Sounds very, very Jamie.
97840	98840	It was very delicious.
98840	99840	It was a very Jamie experience.
99840	100840	I had a delicious time.
100840	101840	Excellent.
101840	103840	All right, say hello as well to Tech Master, Loki.
103840	104840	Hello.
104840	105840	How are you doing, Loki?
105840	106840	Fine.
106840	109840	How are you enjoying the new studio, by the way, that we're taping in tonight?
109840	110840	It's big.
110840	111840	Yes, it's much more spacious than before.
111840	116840	It even comes complete with a washer and dryer that you can't see on the camera.
116840	117840	Yes.
117840	122840	For when I piss myself with joy, I can clean my clothes right there.
122840	123840	That's awesome.
123840	130840	Or, you know, when we have the, as somebody said earlier, on the cam, we covered a ladder with one of the blankets there to make it look a little better.
130840	135840	And somebody said something about we could use the ladder in having ladder matches during the show.
135840	142840	And I was saying, oh, we have, you know, cage matches and bra and panties matches and, you know, whipped cream and bananas.
142840	143840	Anyway.
143840	144840	Yeah.
144840	147840	Anyway, say hello as well to the one and only Puppy is here tonight joining us.
147840	148840	Hello.
148840	149840	How are you doing, Puppy?
149840	158840	I'm worn out from school and work, but I'm getting by and I'm playing lots of rock band and my right leg is cramping.
158840	159840	Well, now hold on.
159840	161840	Don't spoil your gaming weeks just yet.
161840	162840	Whoops.
162840	166840	Maybe it's that you're angsty that your right leg is cramping so much.
166840	168840	All sorts of errors tonight in the brand new studio.
168840	169840	Do you like our new digs?
169840	171840	It's much more spacious than that previous box.
171840	173840	It is much more spacious than the previous box.
173840	176840	Although, Loki still has the same table that wobbles.
176840	178840	I think as somebody said...
178840	181840	I used to have the overturned laundry basket.
181840	183840	Now I have the wobbly table.
183840	184840	I'm moving up in line.
184840	186840	Independent radio at its finest.
186840	189840	Somebody was saying earlier when I was doing the tests earlier today and somebody was watching,
189840	193840	they said all I need is a little mini bar back there and we would truly be an orange lounge.
193840	194840	It would be fun.
194840	195840	We'll see.
195840	196840	A mini bar would be nice.
196840	197840	I'll bring some vodka.
197840	198840	How about something that's orange?
198840	199840	That also might help, too.
199840	201840	Since there's absolutely no orange in there.
201840	203840	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
203840	206840	Penguin nose and chocobo nose.
206840	210840	But you can't really see those because the camera's being blocked by the job.
210840	211840	Yeah, a little ways away.
211840	215840	Anyway, let's get into enough talking about our new digs.
215840	217840	Let's talk about our gaming weeks.
217840	219840	First, Sakura, why don't you start us off?
219840	220840	How was your gaming week?
220840	222840	Well, I played a lot of Ragnarok.
222840	226840	Now that I have internet again, I missed it.
226840	229840	I have a character at level 97 now.
229840	231840	That was really awesome.
231840	237840	While I was in Alabama, I didn't play crap except on the airplane where I tried to play some Oendan
237840	239840	and totally irritated this guy sitting next to me.
239840	241840	It was fantastic.
241840	243840	That's great.
243840	247840	I did that when I still had it when I was in classes in between breaks.
247840	251840	People would be looking at me like, what the hell is that tapping noise you're doing?
251840	254840	I had my headphones on, and he was just looking at me like a...
254840	258840	Oh, but on the way back, this is cool.
258840	261840	When I got on the little dinky tiny plane...
261840	262840	No, I take that back.
262840	265840	It was when I got on the bigger plane coming out of Dallas.
265840	268840	These guys were sitting behind me like, oh, well, don't mind us.
268840	271840	We're nerds, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
271840	273840	I was like, okay.
273840	280840	Then for some reason, we started talking about Half-Life, which I can't play Half-Life.
280840	284840	I was like, yeah, I'm going to get Portal anyway, but I'm going to be so motion sick.
284840	286840	They're like, you get motion sick, and you're on an airplane.
286840	289840	I was like, only video games make me motion sick.
289840	290840	I'm sure that guards them.
290840	293840	That and riding in the backseat of a car will do it sometimes.
293840	296840	Or riding in Kristen's car on Highway 1.
296840	298840	Yeah, that was my gaming week.
298840	299840	All right.
299840	301840	We have a Black Knight pinball in our house now.
301840	304840	Not a Black Knight 2000.
304840	307840	We are housing somebody's Black Knight.
307840	308840	What does that mean?
308840	309840	You're borrowing?
309840	315840	We're providing them storage space in exchange for massive amounts of playing it.
315840	316840	All righty.
316840	318840	Well, let's go over to the one and only Loki.
318840	321840	How was your gaming week, Loki?
321840	324840	Not as filled as I thought it would be, unfortunately.
324840	327840	I planned to play a lot of things and never got around to it.
327840	331840	But I played more Zelda fandom Hourglass.
331840	333840	Almost done with that.
333840	337840	See, the thing with Zelda games is when you finish them, you don't want to play them again.
337840	339840	You're just like, you're done.
339840	340840	Anyways...
340840	341840	I don't know about that.
341840	345840	I challenge that statement because I can still go back and play the old Super Nintendo one.
345840	347840	And the old school NES ones I still love too.
347840	348840	Yeah, true.
348840	349840	Like the Super Nintendo ones and stuff.
349840	351840	I think this game is a little bit shorter.
351840	355840	I mean, it seemed to be really short versus, you know...
355840	357840	Maybe you're just that good.
357840	359840	No, the game is really fucking easy.
359840	362840	It's like stupid easy.
362840	363840	But, I don't know.
363840	364840	It's just...
364840	367840	It's okay, I guess.
367840	370840	Saints Row actually went back and started playing the single player stuff.
370840	372840	Not really...
372840	375840	Now, I haven't really been playing the single player stuff.
375840	380840	I've been playing single player but I've been blowing up this armored car over and over and over again.
380840	385840	Because there's a trick where you can keep getting more money because I'm trying to get the achievement for a million dollars.
385840	387840	And so I keep doing that.
387840	390840	But it's entertaining nonetheless because you're blowing up cars over and over.
390840	392840	Achievement whore.
392840	396840	But, we've been switching it up at work instead of all rocket matches now.
396840	402840	Now we're doing shotguns, pimp slap, and grenades in the meter maid cars.
402840	403840	It's hilarious because...
403840	404840	Boy, that sounds like a party.
404840	407840	Pimp slaps and grenades in the meter maid cars.
407840	408840	But you don't understand.
408840	409840	That's like a band name.
409840	411840	In Saints Row, the pimp slap is like a one hit kill.
411840	414840	You just smack somebody and it launches them across the entire arena.
414840	416840	It's actually pretty fun.
416840	418840	But now we're switching it up.
418840	423840	We're moving out of the arena into this parking garage because there's a thousand more meter maid cars everywhere.
423840	425840	It's hilarious.
425840	429840	And then, let's see, what else have I been playing?
429840	431840	I played the Golden Compass on the Wii.
431840	434840	That sucked.
434840	438840	360, I played Dance Dance Revolution Universe 2.
438840	442840	It's fucking DDR.
442840	447840	It's exactly the same as Universe 1 to me.
447840	450840	They've changed a few things.
450840	455840	The quest mode, you're no longer moving around the United States and the world and stuff.
455840	459840	It's now this fictional DDR island shit.
459840	461840	I don't know.
461840	464840	But is it broken still like the first quest mode was?
464840	466840	Or did they actually kind of fix that?
466840	472840	I would say it's 80% broken still instead of 100% broken as before.
472840	475840	The song list is okay.
475840	479840	I still hate the fact that I have to play through quest mode in order to unlock songs.
479840	483840	I find that very annoying.
483840	486840	But, I mean, it's okay. It's DDR.
486840	488840	Luckily, I didn't have to buy it.
488840	492840	That's good because right now the only way they're selling it is with the dance pad.
492840	495840	You have to pay lots of money for that.
495840	499840	If you're interested in picking it up, it is coming out in January.
499840	501840	Game by itself.
501840	506840	And about the same time we'll be getting a DDR Disney Channel edition.
506840	508840	Which is probably going to be crap.
508840	510840	But that's okay.
510840	513840	But high school musical songs to DDR2.
513840	516840	Okay. Yeah. Lame.
516840	520840	Let's see. What else did I play this week?
520840	523840	You know, I think that's about it.
523840	525840	Because, really, I haven't had a chance to play a lot of stuff.
525840	530840	In fact, I bought two games yesterday and I haven't even unwrapped them yet.
530840	536840	I've got Contra IV and Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings for when I finish Zelda.
536840	538840	Which will be very soon.
538840	540840	I don't know. All the extra stuff in Zelda.
540840	542840	All the hidden islands and stuff.
542840	544840	They have an island that looks like a DS.
544840	546840	And I was like, oh, that's kind of funny.
546840	548840	And that was about the extent of my interest in that.
548840	552840	And then there's another island that you can find treasure.
552840	554840	Which is really kind of lame.
554840	559840	It's not like Wind Waker was where it kind of felt like Mega Man Legends to me a little bit.
559840	564840	Where there's a lot of exploring of, you know, a ton of different dungeons and stuff.
564840	569840	This game, I don't know, it's just kind of really scaled down and made the hell lot easier.
569840	572840	So, I have to go back and play Wind Waker again.
572840	574840	Because I never did finish that game.
574840	577840	And then maybe eventually I'll warm up to playing Twilight Princess.
577840	581840	But, I don't know. I just don't like it.
581840	582840	Alright, fine.
582840	584840	Alright, then my gaming week.
584840	586840	There was some new stuff I finally got to play this week.
586840	588840	As opposed to the same old MMOs.
588840	590840	I actually didn't play the MMOs so much this week.
590840	592840	I actually checked out some new stuff.
592840	594840	Including the orange box, finally.
594840	596840	Which is magnificent.
596840	598840	There's several different games in there.
598840	600840	I haven't even gotten to touch Team Fortress 2 yet.
600840	602840	But I've been playing some of the other games in there.
602840	604840	Half Life, which to be honest,
604840	607840	I know it's a critically acclaimed game and everything.
607840	609840	But I just never really got the chance to play it before.
609840	612840	So this is really the first chance I'm getting to play Half Life.
612840	614840	Half Life 2, I mean, of course.
614840	616840	It's kind of cool. It's very immersive.
616840	618840	And of course, Portal.
618840	620840	I've been playing a lot of Portal.
620840	622840	Moving through the game rather quickly,
622840	625840	I guess the game really isn't that long, per se.
625840	628840	But it'd be damned if it isn't pretty funny and pretty innovative.
628840	630840	It's a great kind of...
630840	633840	It's a puzzle game in first person.
633840	636840	It's not a first person shooter. It's a first person puzzler.
636840	638840	I don't know what else to call it. It's pretty cool.
638840	641840	I swear to God though, that whole thing where you have to
641840	643840	fire a portal on the ground,
643840	645840	and then fire together half up on the ceiling,
645840	648840	and then fall from the ceiling to the one on the ground to get enough inertia,
648840	650840	that thing drove me frickin' nuts.
650840	653840	I was trying to do that for like an hour.
653840	656840	It was so difficult that I finally got through that.
656840	660840	Let's see. Also, the other game I've been playing is
660840	663840	Geometry Wars Galaxies I picked up on the Nintendo Wii.
663840	667840	And I'm having quite a bit of fun with Geometry Wars Galaxies.
667840	669840	It's a pretty good time.
669840	673840	It's a lot different than just the game on the Xbox.
673840	677840	On the good side, there's a lot of extra types of stages,
677840	679840	more monsters, and you know what?
679840	682840	The controls are actually not as hokey as you'd think.
682840	686840	Like, you know, you have to use one half is the moving around.
686840	690840	You move around with the nunchuck on one,
690840	694840	and then you use the Wiimote to kind of point on the screen where you want to shoot.
694840	696840	And you'd think that would be really hokey,
696840	698840	but it actually works out really well.
698840	702840	So, I actually kind of enjoyed the control scheme.
702840	706840	And plus, if for whatever reason you don't like that control scheme,
706840	708840	you can do the classic controller, which is great.
708840	712840	Classic controller doesn't feel quite as nice as the Xbox 360 controller did,
712840	716840	and I think it's because the directionals are a little more grooved on the Wii,
716840	721840	whereas the Xbox 360 has the full 360 degrees of movement a little bit.
721840	725840	So I think that it doesn't have quite the same feel with the classic controller, but it's nice.
725840	729840	My only minor complaints about the game is that, A, it looks better on the 360, obviously.
729840	735840	I mean, you can tell there's some graphical dumbing down that had to be done for the Wii,
735840	736840	but it doesn't look bad.
736840	738840	I mean, it is Geometry Wars.
738840	742840	You're not going to expect, you know, the world's best-looking game,
742840	745840	you know, when you're looking at that.
745840	749840	And then also, the other only kind of minor complaint I have is that,
749840	753840	you know, it's kind of cool that you progress through these different levels
753840	756840	and you unlock new planets and you unlock new power-ups,
756840	758840	because the other kind of thing that you have in Geometry Wars Galaxies,
758840	762840	you have a little droid that follows you, and you can tell the droid what to do.
762840	766840	Like, you can buy an attack mode or buy a defend,
766840	769840	and as you play more levels, the droid levels up with you.
769840	772840	And it's kind of cool, so it gets a little smarter.
772840	777840	But the only thing is that there's really no method to that progression, if that makes sense.
777840	779840	Like, there's no story to back it up.
779840	782840	There's really no nothing.
782840	784840	And, you know, I can kind of understand it,
784840	787840	because Geometry Wars Galaxies is supposed to feel like an arcade game,
787840	790840	especially like a classic 80s shooter, and it does that very well.
790840	794840	But then I think, you know, even Pac-Man at least had the little cutscenes every three boards
794840	796840	that kept it kind of, like, entertaining.
796840	801840	There isn't really anything that you feel like you're working for, if that makes sense.
801840	804840	So, that was my only minor complaint, but overall, I think the game's great.
804840	806840	You don't think cutscenes in Geometry Wars?
806840	809840	I don't mean, like, you have to, like, have these grand, like, cutscenes,
809840	812840	but, like, give me a reason for kind of, like, unlocking all these things.
812840	815840	Or, you know, just a little bit of a story wouldn't hurt.
815840	816840	You know what I mean?
816840	823840	What they need to do is take Geometry Wars out of, like, just the normal, like, asteroid kind of stuff,
823840	828840	and make it into, like, a shoot-em-up game, like Gradius or something like that.
828840	829840	That would be fun.
829840	830840	Yeah, it might be fun.
830840	835840	The other cool thing about Geometry Wars I thought was really cool is that you can download the demo of,
835840	839840	well, it's not really the demo of galaxies to your DS.
839840	840840	It's just basically retro-evolved.
840840	844840	You can download to your DS from the Wii, which is kind of cool,
844840	847840	but I do not like the way the DS controls it all.
847840	852840	So, I don't really want the game on DS, because you use the stylus on the bottom to control your firing,
852840	855840	and it just, it's not that that really bothers me.
855840	857840	It's the trying to move around with the directional pad.
857840	860840	You know, a DS only has the up, down, left, right, really.
860840	865840	The 360 degrees of movement, which is so important in Geometry Wars, is kind of lost on the DS.
865840	866840	But overall, I liked galaxies.
866840	871840	It was fun, and I think it's a good game to kind of play, like, in short little segments,
871840	873840	just like an old, you know, 80s arcade shooter.
873840	876840	So, Puppey, anything you want to share about your gaming week?
876840	877840	A couple of things.
877840	882840	I've been whoring out Rock Band a ton ever since I got it.
882840	890840	I had to switch back to my Guitar Hero 3 controller, because the strum bar on my Rock Band controller died,
890840	894840	and I sent out for the warranty on that, and it actually came back already.
894840	898840	It only took three days for me to get the replacement, and I sent the other one back.
898840	904840	And then, other than that, I got Gamefly, so I've been renting games lately.
904840	910840	I wanted to rent Mass Effect, Call of Duty 4, Orange Box,
910840	916840	and for, I guess I had put Dead Rising on my list a long time ago and forgot about it,
916840	918840	and they ended up sending me that instead.
918840	923840	I played it for a total of an hour and a half, and sent it back.
923840	926840	I could not stand that game for some reason.
926840	928840	It was just terrible.
928840	933840	I thought it was great, because you could, you know, hit zombies with a scythe or a lawnmower.
933840	938840	Well, that was entertaining, but the story could have been cooler,
938840	941840	but the way they've got the game set up, you can only save it once,
941840	946840	and if you die, you have to go back very far and reload a bunch of crap.
946840	954840	I just got sick of it very quickly, and I would not have played through the entire game.
954840	957840	Is that it?
957840	963840	Rock Band, Dead Rising, not playing Halo again until the maps come out next week.
963840	965840	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
965840	970840	Going to the chat room, our always-present other guests, chat.orangelawnsradio.com,
970840	974840	they're kind of lit up right now, because our live 365 stream has been going up and down,
974840	977840	which has been kind of one unfortunate side effect of the new studio,
977840	981840	is that the wireless router now is kind of on the other corner of the house,
981840	982840	so I think I've been losing signal a little bit.
982840	984840	I don't know if Op11 is interfering with that.
984840	988840	So what I'll probably have to do next week is we'll probably get a little sub-router,
988840	991840	because we have a giant cord that we run out here for Operator 11.
991840	993840	I'll also have to get something to split that signal.
993840	996840	But yet, Jamie and Loki's computers run fine on the wireless network.
996840	999840	I don't know what that is, but then again, they're not trying to broadcast a radio program from that.
999840	1002840	So I apologize, chat room, if live 365 is going up and down,
1002840	1005840	we'll just kind of have to deal with it tonight, and then next week we'll fix that.
1005840	1010840	But now we know, which is weird, because I ran live 365 and Op11 at the same time
1010840	1013840	for 40 minutes earlier today, and everything was fine,
1013840	1015840	but now, of course, we're having a plethora of problems.
1015840	1016840	Just my luck.
1016840	1019840	And people will continuously bitch about it.
1019840	1021840	Actually, I'm not really sure why.
1021840	1024840	Well, I think it might just be because of the way your wireless is set up
1024840	1027840	versus having a wireless card built in.
1027840	1030840	Possibly. I don't know. Because I have the little USB thing?
1030840	1032840	Possibly. Who knows.
1032840	1034840	Well, we'll see what happens. We'll do our best.
1034840	1036840	Anyway, we've got to keep the show moving,
1036840	1039840	because of course we've got lots of people who listen to this in the podcast form,
1039840	1043840	and they don't understand any of this that they're hearing right now.
1043840	1046840	They're like, what are you talking about, this wireless router and stuff?
1046840	1049840	Live 365 and chat room, what is all that about?
1049840	1054840	Anyhow, I was going to talk about one more thing that I played this week.
1054840	1056840	Well, alrighty.
1056840	1060840	And I'm not sure, I can't remember if we're getting into this later on or not,
1060840	1067840	but anyways, there's an independent games festival thing
1067840	1071840	kind of going on right now that they've got some of the finalists for.
1071840	1073840	I think the awards come up later in our show.
1073840	1076840	Yeah, the awards. The 10th Annual Independent Games Festival.
1076840	1080840	Anyways, I was playing some of the finalists for that,
1080840	1083840	and one of the games I played, Clean Asia,
1083840	1086840	which I'm a huge fan of Warning Forever and stuff like that.
1086840	1088840	Very similar style game.
1088840	1090840	Very cool shoot-em-up, you've got to try that.
1090840	1093840	Also, Cran Physics is another funny one.
1093840	1095840	But they've got some other stuff in there as well,
1095840	1098840	including a game that I talked about before.
1098840	1101840	What was it? Let's see here.
1101840	1103840	Fret Nice was another one of the nominees,
1103840	1108840	which is a pretty fun game to play on the PC with the Guitar Hero controller.
1108840	1111840	Well, tell us more about that when we get to that part of the show.
1111840	1112840	Will do.
1112840	1114840	Rob, I have a question about your gaming week.
1114840	1115840	Sure.
1115840	1117840	Did you make it past that part in Portal?
1117840	1120840	I sure did. I got to the next level in Portal.
1120840	1125840	I was venting with Jamie my frustration at the robots that shoot you a bunch and then you die.
1125840	1127840	I was having a hard time getting through that portion,
1127840	1129840	and then Jamie said, you have to shoot the ceiling.
1129840	1131840	And she showed me this little walkthrough she'd been watching on the internet.
1131840	1135840	I'm like, God damn it, I didn't even think to shoot the damn ceiling and drop bricks on them.
1135840	1138840	I was trying to shoot the floor and shoot them out through the floor,
1138840	1143840	but there's one part where you can't because the floor is the type where you can't build portals.
1143840	1146840	And I was just taking the cube and trying to bowl them over.
1146840	1148840	That's how I was doing it.
1148840	1150840	And it worked for a minute.
1150840	1152840	You can use the camera too.
1152840	1154840	People are using the cameras.
1154840	1157840	But I felt bad for Rob.
1157840	1161840	I watched the walkthrough a bajillion times just because I thought it was funny.
1161840	1164840	And so I had to help.
1164840	1165840	That's right.
1165840	1167840	So now I'm to the next stage in Portal.
1167840	1170840	I just kind of quit for the night because I wanted to play some other stuff,
1170840	1172840	so I had new things to talk about tonight.
1172840	1174840	Anyhow, a little bit of housekeeping.
1174840	1177840	I guess I already talked about the parts about the new studio,
1177840	1181840	and unfortunately the effect it's having on us tonight with the whole live stream cutting in and out.
1181840	1183840	Sorry about that.
1183840	1187840	But we'll hopefully fix that within the next couple weeks.
1187840	1189840	Are we doing a show December 23rd?
1189840	1191840	I don't think we talked about that.
1191840	1193840	It's the Christmas week.
1193840	1195840	Here it is for Christmas.
1195840	1197840	I should be available.
1197840	1198840	Yeah, I think I'll probably be here too.
1198840	1200840	But I have to work Monday.
1200840	1202840	And of course we have our year-end show coming.
1202840	1203840	You have to work on Christmas Eve?
1203840	1204840	Yeah.
1204840	1205840	Sorry about that.
1205840	1209840	I work for, you know, freakin' tyrants, so it's okay.
1209840	1214840	We'll be having our year-end special probably on December 30th,
1214840	1219840	and I'm hoping that we get some guests on the program like we did last year,
1219840	1220840	but more on that in the next couple weeks.
1220840	1222840	Let's get to the gaming news.
1222840	1223840	Enough about the housekeeping stuff.
1223840	1225840	Let's start off Loki tonight.
1225840	1227840	Anyways, I just wanted to comment one thing on the chat room.
1227840	1230840	Everyone's talking about the weighted companion cube and stuff.
1230840	1233840	No one ever mentions the weighted companion sphere
1233840	1235840	that happens to be in the challenge mode of the game.
1235840	1237840	No love for the sphere, I guess.
1237840	1239840	What's the difference between the sphere and the cube?
1239840	1241840	One's round and one's cube.
1241840	1245840	Does the computer call it the weighted companion sphere?
1245840	1246840	I don't know.
1246840	1250840	Well, I think all that stuff's still the same,
1250840	1254840	but it's just it's harder because you can't just drop it and it will roll.
1254840	1255840	Oh, that's right.
1255840	1257840	And you can't jump on top of it as easy because it'll roll.
1257840	1258840	Okay, I get it.
1258840	1261840	I'm like, duh, I know one's a sphere and a cube, dumbass.
1261840	1263840	I'm like, what is the effect that that has?
1263840	1264840	Okay, I get it.
1264840	1267840	I know the sphere does not have any hearts on it.
1267840	1269840	Aw, sadness.
1269840	1270840	So it doesn't really like you.
1270840	1272840	It's just pretending.
1272840	1274840	Well, then why throw that thing in the incinerator like that?
1274840	1275840	It's like challenge mode, okay.
1275840	1280840	Anyways, this week Rockstar happened to throw out on the internet
1280840	1282840	a brand new trailer for Grand Theft Auto IV.
1282840	1284840	It's fucking fantastic.
1284840	1285840	It's called Move Up, Ladies.
1285840	1289840	It's basically what's really important about this trailer, though,
1289840	1292840	compared to the last one, which came out about six months ago,
1292840	1296840	is it looks a lot better than, you know, the game has really progressed.
1296840	1300840	But it did show kind of a lot of the detail that they're adding in there,
1300840	1304840	including, you know, gunfights and all the stuff that you'd expect
1304840	1305840	from Grand Theft Auto.
1305840	1307840	But there's a bunch of new screenshots and stuff.
1307840	1310840	I have to say the game is coming along very well.
1310840	1311840	It looks awesome.
1311840	1314840	And I think a lot of people that were kind of hesitating about the game
1314840	1316840	before saying, oh, this is just going to be crap,
1316840	1318840	were really on board with it.
1318840	1321840	But if you want to check it out, it's pretty much everywhere.
1321840	1324840	All the major sites, Xbox Live, PlayStation Network,
1324840	1328840	you can definitely find it and download.
1328840	1329840	All righty.
1329840	1333840	So does it actually show, like, more than just the cut scenes?
1333840	1335840	Like, do you actually see what the game is?
1335840	1338840	I still, all the cut scenes are with the in-game engine.
1338840	1342840	So, I mean, you essentially see what the game looks like.
1342840	1346840	One of the characters that they showed also was, again,
1346840	1348840	going to be voiced, I guess, by Seth Green.
1348840	1350840	So that was kind of funny.
1350840	1352840	But it looks really cool.
1352840	1354840	I like the trailers.
1354840	1356840	I just can't wait for the game to come out.
1356840	1359840	I hope it comes out actually in April, like it's supposed to.
1359840	1360840	All right.
1360840	1363840	Anyhow, let's move on to another story about Sony.
1363840	1366840	And, of course, the Sony iBo.
1366840	1369840	You've got to love the iBo, the little doggy.
1369840	1370840	I thought they discontinued the iBo.
1370840	1373840	You know, I guess they did discontinue the iBo that's out now,
1373840	1376840	but it's because there's another iBo on the way, apparently,
1376840	1379840	at least if Stuff Magazine is to be believed.
1379840	1383840	They're currently running a rumor that there is the new iBo
1383840	1388840	that's going to interface with the PSP and the PlayStation 3.
1388840	1390840	I guess the reason why they're doing this
1390840	1395840	is to kind of give the PlayStation 3 more toys and cool stuff,
1395840	1398840	so that it's not just the eye of judgment that they have,
1398840	1400840	but that they have the iBo as well.
1400840	1404840	So apparently the iBo is going to have its own avatar.
1404840	1407840	You'll actually see it within Home, Sony Home.
1407840	1411840	It'll actually do things in the real world like it does in Sony's Home,
1411840	1413840	which should be kind of interesting.
1413840	1416840	So apparently you're going to be able to download new personalities
1416840	1418840	for the iBo from PlayStation Network,
1418840	1422840	and you're going to be able to use the PSP with it over Wi-Fi.
1422840	1427840	The little camera in the dog's head will actually also show on your PSP screen.
1427840	1431840	So what you could actually do is you could move your dog around
1431840	1435840	and put it right under ladies' skirts and then use the PSP as an upskirt cam.
1435840	1439840	So when girls go, oh, what a cute, fake doggy.
1439840	1442840	That's probably the reasoning why they put it in Stuff Magazine to begin with.
1442840	1444840	Possibly.
1444840	1447840	I wanted to get one so I could play with my cat,
1447840	1450840	because my cat's kind of getting lonely and she's causing a lot of trouble,
1450840	1453840	and I figured this would be a perfect way to spend a couple thousand dollars
1453840	1456840	is to get a thing to play with my cat.
1456840	1459840	Then I could also watch it at work and watch what my cat's doing.
1459840	1461840	Now here's my favorite part,
1461840	1467840	Stuff Magazine rates this rumor at a 53% possibility.
1467840	1470840	Where the fuck do you get a number like that?
1470840	1473840	It makes it sound like there's this real scientific process
1473840	1478840	that rumors go through over at Stuff Magazine in order to get a rating.
1478840	1482840	So it's like they put it in their big super-predicting computer.
1482840	1484840	Here's a little note.
1484840	1487840	This has a 53% probability of being true.
1487840	1493840	It's about as official as the if they mated segment of Conan, okay?
1493840	1496840	We'll see. I don't know. I kind of call BS.
1496840	1499840	I think there may be a little something with the eyebo,
1499840	1502840	but I don't know, upskirt cams, I don't know about that.
1502840	1504840	We don't need to be giving Sony any ideas.
1504840	1506840	I want an eyebo, Rob.
1506840	1509840	Okay, well, save up your money and then you can buy one.
1509840	1511840	I've wanted an eyebo for a very long time.
1511840	1513840	I have a live journal icon that's an eyebo.
1513840	1514840	I want a pony.
1514840	1515840	You know what?
1515840	1517840	I'm not exactly to get a pony.
1517840	1520840	Eyebo of judgment.
1520840	1522840	The eyebo of judgment.
1522840	1523840	They should make the eye pony.
1523840	1525840	I was watching a special on robotics last night
1525840	1527840	and they were bringing up the eyebo.
1527840	1531840	But it was these lifelike robot people,
1531840	1534840	things that could interview people and repeat back your question
1534840	1536840	and follow you and do all this stuff.
1536840	1539840	I was like, yet the eyebo didn't sell better.
1539840	1542840	Eye paparazzi?
1542840	1545840	It was called like the respond queue or something, it was really weird.
1545840	1548840	It was at one of the Tokyo robotics shows I was watching.
1548840	1553840	Anyway, for anyone who is interested in Devil May Cry 4,
1553840	1558840	which I know I am because I really, really, really, really, really, really like Devil May Cry,
1558840	1562840	except why the hell are they giving Dante a beard?
1562840	1566840	The demo is going to be out in early 2008, according to Capcom.
1566840	1570840	For PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, there will be a PC version,
1570840	1572840	but no word on if we're getting a demo of that.
1572840	1576840	And the demo is supposed to be different levels in the game
1576840	1579840	instead of just, oh, here's the start of the game, bye.
1579840	1583840	It's to give you a sample of the environments and different characters.
1583840	1585840	See, now I worry about you having an eyebo
1585840	1590840	because the fangasm you have when you play this Devil May Cry demo
1590840	1593840	will get all over your eyebo, and that's just filthy.
1593840	1596840	No.
1596840	1597840	No.
1597840	1599840	Will you at least put a towel over your eyebo so he doesn't have to watch?
1599840	1603840	I wouldn't get an eyebo anyway because you know my cat would be offended.
1603840	1605840	Miss Stupid Shermy Butt.
1605840	1607840	Shermy's been replaced with a robot?
1607840	1608840	No.
1608840	1609840	Okay.
1609840	1612840	She gets offended when I bring new people into the house.
1612840	1613840	She gets used to them.
1613840	1615840	How exactly does a cat get offended?
1615840	1616840	That's what I want to know.
1616840	1618840	You know how some cats just get pissy and walk off and everything?
1618840	1622840	Shermy just gives me this hurt look.
1622840	1623840	I don't know how else to describe it.
1623840	1625840	She doesn't get pissy.
1625840	1627840	She doesn't, like, start hissing at anybody.
1627840	1629840	She just looks hurt.
1629840	1630840	That's why I'm a dog person.
1630840	1634840	We've secretly replaced Shermy with an eyebo.
1634840	1640840	My cat's so retarded, she still thinks that the mirror is another cat, so, you know.
1640840	1643840	I was watching on YouTube last night, though, along with the robotic stuff,
1643840	1648840	I was also watching cats talking to people, you know, that could imitate human talk,
1648840	1651840	and Shermy was going crazy.
1651840	1653840	She was running into the desk.
1653840	1658840	She gets unnatural!
1658840	1661840	What in God's name is going on over there?
1661840	1662840	That's what it sounded like, actually.
1662840	1663840	Wow.
1663840	1664840	You don't understand.
1664840	1666840	We're kind of crazy with our cat.
1666840	1670840	We'll make her talk, like, and we'll have conversations with her,
1670840	1675840	but she can't talk, and I don't know why the hell we do that.
1675840	1677840	And she has a really high-pitched voice somehow.
1677840	1678840	I don't know.
1678840	1679840	It's weird.
1679840	1680840	One of the videos I was watching last night,
1680840	1684840	it just sounded like the cat was actually just, like, saying,
1684840	1686840	Hello?
1686840	1687840	Hello?
1687840	1688840	Like that.
1688840	1689840	And I was like, okay.
1689840	1693840	And then another one was a cat sleeping in a sink.
1693840	1696840	Is this where Lolcats is going in 2008?
1696840	1697840	I don't know.
1697840	1698840	I think so.
1698840	1699840	Wow.
1699840	1700840	Okay.
1700840	1701840	Let's move on.
1701840	1704840	Anyways.
1704840	1705840	So, yes.
1705840	1710840	One of the unfortunate things with the PlayStation 3 version of Rock Band
1710840	1713840	was that you couldn't use your Guitar Hero 3 controller with it.
1713840	1715840	Well, now that's going to be fixed,
1715840	1718840	and there is going to be a patch that's going to be coming
1718840	1722840	where you'll be able to download it, and it will allow it to play.
1722840	1723840	Hooray!
1723840	1724840	That's kind of funny, though,
1724840	1728840	is they had another story that came out earlier this week.
1728840	1733840	Some guy, Red Octane, was actually making fun of Rock Band
1733840	1736840	and their guitar controllers and saying how they're never going to make
1736840	1738840	those controllers compatible with Guitar Hero 3
1738840	1741840	because they think their controllers are crap.
1741840	1744840	Way to take the high road, Red Octane.
1744840	1748840	You know, hey, it doesn't matter that our consumers or anything
1748840	1750840	might want it a little bit easier so they don't have to buy more
1750840	1752840	of your crappy controllers.
1752840	1755840	Sure, let's just go ahead and piss on them.
1755840	1758840	Hooray!
1758840	1762840	I do like, though, that they're at least patching to, you know,
1762840	1764840	like somebody's giving in a little bit and patching
1764840	1766840	so the guitars work universally.
1766840	1767840	Exactly, they should.
1767840	1769840	I don't understand why they lock it out of other games.
1769840	1771840	It's just fucking lazy.
1771840	1773840	Actually, it's just fucking mean is what it is.
1773840	1776840	Jonathan F. in our chat room has a good point that
1776840	1779840	I don't believe we're covering elsewhere on our show tonight.
1779840	1780840	He says, speaking of patches,
1780840	1783840	Guitar Hero Wii discs will be replaced in 2008
1783840	1785840	to fix the mono sound problem.
1785840	1786840	Did you hear about that?
1786840	1787840	Yeah.
1787840	1789840	So they're going to remaster the discs or whatever,
1789840	1791840	and they'll be available in 2008 new discs.
1791840	1793840	But how many people do you think will actually do that?
1793840	1796840	I bet most Wii owners probably wouldn't even think to do it.
1796840	1798840	There might be a few.
1798840	1799840	Well, we need to spread the word.
1799840	1802840	Make it financially sucky for them.
1802840	1803840	Well, there you have it.
1803840	1805840	If you own Guitar Hero on the Wii,
1805840	1807840	then be sure in 2008 you request your...
1807840	1810840	And even if you don't care, just get a new one anyway,
1810840	1812840	just because newer is better.
1812840	1813840	That's what you need to remember.
1813840	1814840	Newer is better.
1814840	1815840	That's right.
1815840	1816840	Newer is better.
1816840	1819840	Moving on, we're talking about the PlayStation a little bit,
1819840	1822840	and on the PlayStation Network, it has been released this week,
1822840	1825840	a brand new bowling game.
1825840	1828840	High velocity bowling is $10.
1828840	1831840	Also added to the PlayStation Network,
1831840	1833840	some new stuff for the game Folklore,
1833840	1836840	and of course, Rock Band downloadable content.
1836840	1839840	Also, Wild Arms is now available for download
1839840	1843840	on the old school PlayStation Games line.
1843840	1844840	Yay!
1844840	1846840	So, I don't know.
1846840	1852840	It's certainly not Wii bowling, but it kind of looks a little urban.
1852840	1854840	You play a guy with tattoos.
1854840	1856840	You actually use the 6-axis controller.
1856840	1858840	Yeah, I was kind of curious about that.
1858840	1860840	Yeah, we're going to have people throw...
1860840	1864840	See though, I don't know if this one would be making holes in TVs and stuff,
1864840	1866840	because it's kind of rounded and a little bit light,
1866840	1869840	whereas when you kind of huck the remote,
1869840	1871840	it's kind of like a javelin type thing.
1871840	1872840	Just get the Nerf thing for it.
1872840	1873840	That's what you do.
1873840	1875840	Yeah, you just get the Nerf thing for it.
1875840	1882840	Well, in other news for our PlayStation 3 owners,
1882840	1885840	which at Best Buy, that was freaking sad.
1885840	1888840	Oh yes, Jamie and I went to Best Buy earlier this week,
1888840	1890840	and we were shopping.
1890840	1891840	We were just kind of going around.
1891840	1892840	Sad.
1892840	1894840	That's when I bought Geometry Wars Galaxies.
1894840	1895840	Yes.
1895840	1897840	I was thinking about getting Trauma Center,
1897840	1899840	and I ended up getting the cheaper of the game.
1899840	1901840	And I bought Super Breakout for the Atari 5200 that night.
1901840	1902840	But that was later.
1902840	1904840	But I already own two copies of it.
1904840	1906840	Then why did you buy a third, dummy?
1906840	1908840	I thought that we didn't have it,
1908840	1910840	and then it occurred to me when we got home
1910840	1912840	that freaking Super Breakout was the game
1912840	1917840	that came with the Atari 5200.
1917840	1918840	But I have a manual now.
1918840	1919840	That's good.
1919840	1920840	All right.
1920840	1922840	Well, anyhow, I was going to say at Best Buy,
1922840	1926840	we were there, and there were big stacks of PlayStation 3s
1926840	1928840	all over the store, not just one stack,
1928840	1931840	but at least four stacks of PlayStation 3s.
1931840	1936840	There were easily, what, 50 systems just sitting out unloved?
1936840	1938840	And we were talking to the guy,
1938840	1940840	because the guy was helping me look up Geometry Wars Galaxies,
1940840	1941840	because for whatever reason,
1941840	1942840	they didn't have any out on the floor.
1942840	1943840	They were all in the cage.
1943840	1945840	So I was asking him if they had it and everything.
1945840	1946840	And you could tell he was kind of a gamer,
1946840	1947840	so we were kind of joking with him,
1947840	1950840	and he said something about he was playing Geometry Wars on a 360.
1950840	1952840	And we said something about,
1952840	1954840	it looks like you haven't been moving a whole lot of these.
1954840	1956840	And we touched the PlayStation 3 thing,
1956840	1958840	and he said, not really.
1958840	1960840	He said, the first couple days, there were a lot,
1960840	1962840	but not really.
1962840	1963840	So.
1963840	1964840	Yeah.
1964840	1965840	It's not looking good, Sony fans.
1965840	1967840	Sorry to say.
1967840	1970840	Maybe more when Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy 13 comes out.
1970840	1971840	We'll see.
1971840	1972840	But anyway.
1972840	1974840	Metal Gear Solid for Geriatric Snake.
1974840	1975840	We'll see.
1975840	1976840	Anyway.
1976840	1979840	Nobody likes a Geriatric Snake.
1979840	1984840	Or GZDr4ev says Unreal Tournament 3 will sell the PlayStation 3 units.
1984840	1985840	No it won't.
1985840	1986840	It will sell some.
1986840	1988840	There's fanboys for everything.
1988840	1990840	Well.
1990840	1993840	You know, maybe when they put out Jumping Flash 3.
1993840	1995840	But anyway.
1995840	2000840	For the 2.0 PS3 firmware update,
2000840	2003840	there is,
2003840	2009840	it was actually included that there were custom soundtracks for High Velocity Bowling.
2009840	2013840	Okay, who's playing High Velocity Bowling?
2013840	2015840	Well, I don't know whoever downloaded it this week.
2015840	2016840	Who knows?
2016840	2020840	But it also has an in-game friends list for the demo for Timeshift.
2020840	2026840	So it looks like that more games, hopefully, are going to be incorporating that type of thing.
2026840	2029840	Like, who's online, that type of thing.
2029840	2032840	So, unfortunately though, it's not going to be centralized.
2032840	2034840	It'll be up to the game people to put it in their games.
2034840	2035840	Yeah.
2035840	2038840	I mean,
2038840	2040840	they're not getting it.
2040840	2043840	I don't think they,
2043840	2045840	Microsoft's already figured it out.
2045840	2050840	Well, I think this is one of those things where maybe the PlayStation 3 should have waited a year before launching.
2050840	2054840	Because it sounds like this is one of those things that they just didn't implement in the system and now it's too late.
2054840	2056840	Although, I would think they could do a firmware upgrade.
2056840	2058840	I mean, they do those pretty frequently.
2058840	2061840	This was from the last firmware upgrade.
2061840	2062840	Huh.
2062840	2064840	But, it's just,
2064840	2066840	it seems like more of a case to be like,
2066840	2068840	Oh crap, we should have done that here.
2068840	2071840	Oh well, it's a free service, so whatever.
2071840	2073840	Don't implement it when they feel like it.
2073840	2076840	I guess that's true, at least they don't charge.
2076840	2079840	And if you want to play games on Xbox Live, you've got to pay.
2079840	2081840	Don't charge and it shows.
2081840	2083840	Well, anyway.
2083840	2085840	Anyways,
2085840	2089840	however, retailers are charging for games and here's what's coming out this week.
2089840	2093840	Not a whole lot and it's a lot of leftovers, actually.
2093840	2098840	Anyways, Blacksite Area 51 is finally making its way out on the PlayStation 3.
2098840	2101840	Way to be on top of things, Midway.
2101840	2105840	Go Unreal Tournament 3 Engine, or Unreal Engine 3, whatever.
2106840	2108840	Speaking of Unreal,
2108840	2111840	Unreal Tournament 3 is coming out this week on PS3 as well.

2135840	2137840	Let's see here.
2137840	2139840	Super Swing Golf Season 2.
2139840	2142840	That's going to be coming out, in case you like the last one.
2144840	2146840	I don't know how many people are getting this.
2146840	2148840	Madden NFL 08 Español.
2149840	2150840	The Spanish version.
2150840	2151840	Hey, you know what?
2151840	2155840	It makes the game appealing to an audience that maybe wasn't able to get into it before, you know?
2155840	2158840	Exactly. Now with more luchadors.
2159840	2161840	Unfortunately, that's not true.
2161840	2163840	The luchadors are great.
2164840	2165840	Is that it?
2167840	2169840	Let's see.
2169840	2171840	No, that's not it.
2171840	2173840	The Golden Compass on PC.
2173840	2176840	Oh, goodie! I'm so glad we have that.
2176840	2179840	Showtime Boxing on the Wii.
2179840	2182840	And...
2183840	2185840	And that's it.
2185840	2190840	And we move on to Japanese release dates, starting off on the Xbox 360.
2190840	2195840	Kingdom Under Fire, Circle of Doom comes out this week in Japan.

2211840	2215840	And, of course, there's a new racing wheel coming out in Japan to go with that.

2239840	2243840	I don't know if that's a redone version of the old Mahjong game, but I don't know.
2243840	2245840	That comes out on the Nintendo Wii. I somehow doubt that.
2245840	2248840	Soul Calibur Legends also makes its way to the Nintendo Wii.
2248840	2251840	Another version of the Castle of Shikigami 3.

2255840	2257840	That's coming over here in February, I believe.
2257840	2258840	Is it?
2258840	2259840	It's a Capcom one.
2259840	2260840	All right.
2260840	2263840	Also coming out on other systems, we have the PlayStation 2 gets.
2263840	2269840	Hakurina Heart comes out as well as Spectral Gene, and that's all the PS2 gets this week.

2277840	2278840	What?

2300840	2306840	And also, just for you guys in chat, Dustcat Portable 2 makes its way out this week.
2306840	2307840	You know what I need to do, Rob?
2307840	2308840	What?
2308840	2310840	I need to put up that picture I took of you at Best Buy.
2310840	2312840	Oh, with Imagine Babies?
2312840	2314840	Yeah, we found Imagine Babies.
2314840	2315840	Very interesting game.
2315840	2320840	Yes, Fuji no Mori no Let's Tarot does look to be a tarot card game for the DS.
2320840	2321840	That sounds like fun.
2321840	2322840	Yumi wants.
2322840	2327840	And Shanghai is indeed a version of the old Mahjong classic on the Nintendo Wii.
2327840	2329840	It is indeed that.
2329840	2331840	There you have it, your Japanese release dates.
2331840	2336840	Well, for our friends in the UK, not a whole bunch is coming out.
2336840	2344840	On the 14th is Beowulf, Half-Life 2 Episode 2, Portal, Team Fortress 2, The Orange...
2344840	2346840	Wait, did I already do these?
2346840	2349840	You know it says December.
2349840	2352840	I'm like, okay, it's being all bizarre.
2352840	2357840	Yeah, Beowulf, Half-Life 2 Episode 2, Portal, Team Fortress 2, and then The Orange Box.
2357840	2359840	They are releasing them separately.
2359840	2362840	Time Shift and Wipeout Pulse.
2362840	2369840	And of course all of the Half-Life related things were on PlayStation 3.
2369840	2372840	Alright, kind of a slow week over in the UK.
2372840	2373840	Yep.
2373840	2374840	Oh well.
2374840	2377840	Maybe it'll get a little more busy before the end of the year.
2377840	2380840	Or at least early next year when they start getting all the stuff that we got this year.
2380840	2382840	Poor guys over there.
2382840	2389840	I will be more than happy to send gifts overseas if people send me any booze.
2389840	2390840	Money!
2390840	2391840	Alright.
2391840	2395840	Let's get back into the gaming news.
2395840	2401840	Anyways, it's another week so that means there must be another Korean MMO coming.
2401840	2405840	And this time it's going to be a game called Perfect K.O.
2405840	2410840	It's actually a fighting game MMO and it's got an unlikely duo of characters that are
2410840	2412840	going to be making their way to it.
2412840	2417840	And those two characters, of course, would be Ken and Chung Lee from the Street Fighter
2417840	2418840	series.
2418840	2419840	It actually looks kind of neat.
2419840	2423840	It's sort of like a 3D brawl game or something like that.
2423840	2428840	And then of course as you beat up more people you can customize your avatar and that kind
2428840	2430840	of fun stuff.
2430840	2434840	But that's kind of neat to see that they're actually licensing characters from Capcom.
2434840	2439840	Hopefully they'll license characters from some other things.
2439840	2440840	That's going to be interesting.
2440840	2442840	What other kind of characters are in this game besides Ken and Chung Lee?
2442840	2443840	They didn't really mention.
2443840	2447840	It's a lot of stuff that they've designed themselves but the character designs are really
2447840	2448840	cool.
2448840	2455840	It'd be nice to see some of these characters from this Korean game move over to say Street
2455840	2457840	Fighter IV or something like that.
2457840	2460840	Speaking of Street Fighter IV, there were a lot of new details released this week.
2460840	2461840	First off, I've got to ask though.
2461840	2466840	Did you hear about the drama going on behind the Street Fighter IV news?
2466840	2472840	This Brazilian news site put out these screenshots from Street Fighter IV, these new screenshots
2472840	2474840	besides the one we'd seen previously.
2474840	2478840	They put out some new screenshots and one up sick the lawyers on them.
2478840	2480840	Or as if Davis were to say, sick the lawyers on them.
2480840	2486840	And people were like, rah, rah, rah, the corporation's taken down the independent voice and certainly
2486840	2488840	I was kind of going a little bit of that too.
2488840	2490840	I'm like, boy those bastards, da da da.
2490840	2495840	But at the same time it turns out, who knew that actually the leak came from the fact
2495840	2499840	that the person that runs that website is some type of contractor for EGM in Brazil.
2499840	2504840	So he actually did steal internal information, I guess ended up admitting to it.
2504840	2506840	So I don't know why he did that.
2506840	2507840	Wasn't smart.
2507840	2510840	Maybe he thought it was already out in America or something.
2510840	2512840	No, he just wanted to leak it.
2512840	2515840	No one wins here except for us.
2515840	2516840	That's right.
2516840	2518840	The users win because we got all that information.
2518840	2519840	We got three screenshots.
2519840	2520840	That's right, new screenshot.
2520840	2523840	But honestly, they didn't give you that much more.
2523840	2525840	It was all on the same stage still.
2525840	2528840	I think one was a fireball shot, which was kind of cool, but that was really it.
2528840	2531840	But some other information did come out.
2531840	2535840	And EGM is not happy about it because this is how they were going to sell their magazines this week.
2535840	2538840	The game will actually run at 60 frames per second.
2538840	2543840	The storyline takes place between Super Street Fighter II Turbo and Street Fighter III.
2543840	2546840	Lots of old school characters will return.
2546840	2551840	There's going to be two new female characters, but no characters from Street Fighter III.
2551840	2555840	So you kind of wonder if Capcom isn't just kind of writing off Street Fighter III in a way.
2555840	2561840	They should have brought that guy's name Oro back, but he can have both of his arms this time.
2561840	2564840	And then in Street Fighter IV, he loses the arms.
2564840	2565840	You know, continuity.
2565840	2567840	You never know.
2567840	2569840	Actually, I don't think that he lost his arm.
2569840	2572840	I think it's tied behind his back.
2572840	2573840	Whatever.
2573840	2574840	He had one arm.
2574840	2575840	That's all that matters to me.
2575840	2577840	I don't care if he's tied behind his back.
2577840	2580840	Whatever he wants to do with his severed limb is fine with me.
2580840	2587840	As most people speculated, the screenshots that you do see in the pictures floating around the Internet right now is Chun-Li's new stage.
2587840	2590840	The parry system that was in Street Fighter III, gone.
2590840	2594840	New system in place, it's called Saving Revenge, something like that.
2594840	2596840	Some new system is in place.
2596840	2601840	It's built around cancels, and there will be its own gauge that's separate from the super meter.
2601840	2602840	There are supers in the game.
2602840	2605840	Don't know if it's Street Fighter III's or Super Street Fighter II Turbos.
2605840	2607840	There's also ultras.
2607840	2609840	My God, there's lots of different types of moves.
2609840	2611840	Here's the other weird thing.
2611840	2614840	Shang-Long may actually be in the game.
2614840	2618840	But there's kind of a May, and we don't know if that's just a running gag from EGM,
2618840	2622840	because that was one of their first April Fools jokes years ago.
2622840	2625840	Back when I used to get that magazine delivered to my house, like 15 years ago.
2625840	2627840	Back when it was good.
2627840	2630840	Back in the day, certainly.
2630840	2634840	And rumor is, we will see Street Fighter IV in the arcades with online play,
2634840	2638840	also in the PlayStation 3 and 360, all of them online.
2638840	2642840	Wouldn't it be cool if the console versions interfaced with the arcade somehow?
2642840	2645840	Of course, then you kind of wonder why would anybody go to the arcade,
2645840	2648840	but community, and maybe there will be something special the arcade version has there.
2648840	2650840	If it did, it'd probably be only with the PlayStation 3 version,
2650840	2654840	since you've got Live, and Live isn't cross-platform, very easy.
2654840	2657840	Well, they've got Final Fantasy XI to work somehow, so it's possible.
2657840	2660840	Yeah, but see, Final Fantasy XI runs off the Square Enix servers,
2660840	2663840	because you're connecting to Play Online.
2663840	2664840	That's totally separate.
2664840	2667840	That's why you have to pay that stupid monthly fee.
2667840	2671840	So anyways, obviously take some of that stuff with a grain of salt,
2671840	2675840	in regards to Shang-Long and the online arcade stuff.
2675840	2676840	Take all that with a grain of salt.
2676840	2679840	But it does sound, as far as the rest of it, that it's pretty cemented.
2679840	2683840	I mean, the 60 frames a second and stuff, it sounds like it's going to be a winner.
2683840	2686840	So I have to say, I'm already a little more excited about Street Fighter IV
2686840	2688840	than I ever was about Street Fighter III.
2688840	2689840	It looks pretty good.
2689840	2691840	I like the art style in it.
2691840	2695840	I was kind of crossing my fingers that it'd be more like the trailer,
2695840	2696840	because that was really cool.
2696840	2698840	But the art style's okay.
2698840	2702840	I like what they're doing where it's 3D, but it's 2D type thing.
2702840	2705840	Some of the facial animations, though, that they had,
2705840	2709840	like some of the screenshots, a little weird.
2709840	2713840	It looks a little wonky, but I think it'll be fine.
2713840	2715840	Jamie, I know you've been a Street Fighter fan for ages and ages.
2715840	2718840	Are you happy about Street Fighter IV?
2718840	2721840	I'm reserving judgment until I actually play it.
2721840	2723840	Okay, so you're not letting the hype get to you at all?
2723840	2724840	Nope.
2724840	2725840	All right, fair enough.
2725840	2728840	I still think that it's only going to take a week before
2728840	2732840	a bunch of fighting game fans completely break the system.
2732840	2734840	If it is online?
2734840	2736840	Oh, not just online.
2736840	2738840	I mean, just the game itself.
2738840	2739840	That's all dedicated there.
2739840	2741840	They'll break any fighting game system.
2741840	2743840	Figure out how to cheat real quick?
2743840	2744840	We'll see.
2744840	2745840	We will see.
2745840	2748840	Anyway, let's move on to some more news.
2748840	2754840	Well, for the Xbox originals, they are, well, region locked.
2754840	2757840	You can't get past it.
2757840	2761840	Where the Japanese demos are working, the games themselves are not.
2761840	2763840	There's no such thing as can't.
2763840	2765840	That's what I say.
2765840	2769840	Just not now is what Loki is hoping for this.
2769840	2771840	But they got some extra games in Japan.
2771840	2773840	Well, not necessarily extra, but they got different games in Japan
2773840	2774840	than we got here, huh?
2774840	2776840	Here's the problem.
2776840	2777840	Go ahead. Sorry.
2777840	2781840	Well, they actually tested, for example, with Magatama.
2781840	2785840	They said that they got a message that said the download was not
2785840	2788840	available in your region.
2788840	2791840	Well, I think it's because it's either looking at one or two things.
2791840	2794840	It's either looking at the region of your console, which case,
2794840	2796840	yeah, you're kind of screwed then.
2796840	2799840	Or it's looking at the region of your IP.
2799840	2802840	If that's the case, you could probably just route your IP through
2802840	2807840	like a mirror, say somewhere overseas, and it might work.
2807840	2809840	But I'm guessing it's looking at the region of your console
2809840	2811840	because that would make more sense.
2811840	2812840	But it's weird, though.
2812840	2815840	It just won't let you download it whatsoever.
2815840	2816840	Who cares?
2816840	2817840	It's a fucking Xbox game.
2817840	2818840	Seriously.
2818840	2820840	I mean, if you...
2820840	2822840	I don't know.
2822840	2823840	It's an Xbox game.
2823840	2824840	Do you really need to download it?
2824840	2825840	It's old.
2825840	2827840	Play something new.
2827840	2828840	I don't know.
2828840	2832840	I'm noticing that because of the old Xbox games coming back,
2832840	2835840	I've had a lot of friends tell me the Indigo Prophecy,
2835840	2838840	kind of a game that may have been, I don't want to say overlooked
2838840	2841840	because it certainly had its fans, but overlooked by many
2841840	2844840	is kind of getting a little bit of a resurgence with this.
2844840	2846840	And I've had people actually send me messages on Xbox Live
2846840	2848840	going, dude, you need to check out Indigo Prophecy
2848840	2849840	if you haven't already played it before.
2849840	2851840	It's kind of fun.
2851840	2853840	Go buy it in the stores, people.
2853840	2855840	It's probably cheaper than buying it online.
2855840	2856840	Seriously.
2856840	2859840	And then you get the disk and maybe a manual.
2859840	2862840	I mean, instead of having to read a PDF file online,
2862840	2864840	just go look.
2864840	2868840	This stuff is so old, it's probably dirt cheap by now.
2868840	2870840	I guess there's one way to find out.
2870840	2871840	You've got to go out there and shop.
2871840	2873840	Oh, you want to hear something funny?
2873840	2874840	What is it?
2874840	2875840	Ha ha ha.
2875840	2876840	Shut up.
2876840	2879840	Anyways, Katamari Damacy.
2879840	2884840	That game, when it came out, that was like a $20 game, wasn't it?
2884840	2885840	The original one on PlayStation 2?
2885840	2886840	Yeah.
2886840	2887840	That was a budget game, $19.99.
2887840	2888840	$20 game.
2888840	2891840	It's only used at GameStop for 30 bucks.
2891840	2895840	I'm like, 10 bucks over retail, and it's used.
2895840	2896840	Right.
2896840	2898840	But that's because they don't make it retail anymore, right?
2898840	2899840	It doesn't matter, though.
2899840	2901840	It should still be cheap.
2901840	2904840	Well, what about, okay, what about, like, frickin' old-ass PlayStation 1 games?
2904840	2907840	Like, for the longest time, Intelligent Cube, they were charging an arm and a leg for.
2907840	2910840	Symphony of the Night, before it was out on Xbox Live, they were charging...
2910840	2914840	I didn't think Katamari, the first one, had a really high demand for it.
2914840	2917840	And, like, Street Fighter, was it Marvel vs. Street Fighter 2?
2917840	2920840	That's going for, you know, quite a bit.
2920840	2924840	Or Marvel vs. Capcom 2.
2924840	2929840	But, um, I didn't think Katamari was, like, you know, going to bring in a demand of $10
2929840	2930840	over retail.
2930840	2931840	Especially used.
2931840	2937840	Well, uh, let's go ahead and move on with the news.
2937840	2942840	Anyways, there's yet another stupid lawsuit that goes with Halo 3.
2942840	2945840	It's like, Halo 3, more stupid lawsuits.
2945840	2950840	This time, some dumb shit is complaining that there's not a lot of, um, there's some pixels
2950840	2951840	missing, apparently.
2951840	2958840	Because, apparently, uh, Halo 3, you know, has upscaled 640p, I guess, is missing 80
2958840	2961840	pixels, and they explain why they did that and stuff.
2961840	2966840	So now they're suing because it's not truly 720p.
2966840	2969840	And they're saying it's false advertising.
2969840	2970840	What?
2970840	2971840	For real?
2971840	2973840	This verse is for real?
2973840	2978840	That's sad, and, you know what, I heard about this, and I actually looked at the back of
2978840	2985840	the box, and on the back it just says, HDTV, you know, 720p, 1080i, 1080p.
2985840	2989840	It doesn't explicitly say, this game runs natively in these formats.
2989840	2990840	But what game does?
2990840	2991840	None of them do.
2991840	2992840	No, none of them.
2992840	2995840	And here's the thing, is I would say, okay, why don't you count the pixels that are on
2995840	2996840	your TV there?
2996840	2997840	720 of them?
2997840	2998840	Okay.
2998840	2999840	Shut up.
2999840	3005340	So they're trying to say it's false advertising because the game wasn't programmed in 720
3005340	3006340	or whatever.
3006340	3007340	Whatever, dude.
3007340	3010340	That is seriously a stupid complaint.
3010340	3012040	That's gonna get thrown out.
3012040	3014040	I hope so.
3014040	3019960	Well, all I know is that all these freaking Halo 3 lawsuits, god damn they make us mad,
3019960	3037120	and when we get mad, people die.
3037120	3042240	It is time for my annual Christmas FU.
3042240	3047760	It's a combination of everything about the holiday season that pisses me off.
3047760	3053320	So, and again, it's all pretty ridiculous, you know, I'm not attacking anybody, but first
3053320	3057320	of all, the people who over-decorate their houses that look like Christmas puked all
3057320	3061760	over their house, oh my god, learn what aesthetics are for.
3061760	3064520	Seriously, what about that tree?
3064520	3065520	This outside...
3065520	3067760	Did I not tell you that tree was hideous?
3067760	3069680	It's okay.
3069680	3073400	And Rob put it best when he told me about it at first, that the whole top part of the
3073400	3077440	tree is not lit because probably a light bulb burnt out.
3077440	3082520	There's this ginormous tree in front of a church, and it's like it's not wearing a top,
3082520	3084520	because a bulb burned out at the top of the tree.
3084520	3085520	This is what I think, though.
3085520	3086520	I don't think that's it.
3086520	3090160	I think they didn't, they just actually didn't decorate it, because there's different types
3090160	3091160	of lights.
3091160	3095420	There's a loop of white lights going around it, and then there's multicolored lights,
3095420	3101440	and then, and then that one, that place that had the Christmas crap everywhere.
3101440	3105200	I was like, oh my god, now I understand being into the season, and I understand having a
3105200	3107720	few lights, and you know, and that's cool.
3107720	3111280	I love to see things that are tastefully decorated.
3111280	3114560	Like, we have some tacky Christmas lights here in the studio.
3114560	3115560	That's cute.
3115560	3119160	You know, I can, like, the icicle lights are nice.
3119160	3123960	Maybe having a Santa in your front yard or decorating a tree in your front yard, but
3123960	3129640	like, this is the worst example ever, and it's one house that was in Mobile, Alabama,
3129640	3135080	that I saw right before, probably the year I moved out, and that was these people who
3135080	3139900	strung Christmas lights all over their yard, across their yard, in patches.
3139900	3145100	Their house freaking glowed, and I was like, and on top of it, they were all multicolored,
3145100	3148080	so it looked like that cut light just, like, throw up.
3148080	3151760	I'm not joking, and that originated the phrase Christmas threw up on that house.
3151760	3156160	I saw a very offensive house last night, and it was one of those houses where they had
3156160	3162080	the radio station playing, and you tune your car to a certain frequency on the radio, and
3162080	3166760	then you can, like, the lights flash in sync with the music, right?
3166760	3170480	Okay, but it's hideous, because if you don't have the radio station turned on, it just
3170480	3175680	looks like this house is randomly flashing all of their lights, like, and I swear to
3175680	3176680	God, I almost had a seizure driving.
3176680	3178480	The house is having a seizure.
3178480	3180840	I almost had a fucking seizure driving by that house.
3180840	3181840	It's not funny.
3181840	3184960	Like, seriously, somebody is going to crash into that house, and all the kids in that
3184960	3189440	house are going to be in a fire, because that house is going to cause somebody to have a
3189440	3190440	seizure.
3190440	3195080	And on top of that, imagine these people's freaking power bill, you know, but anyway,
3195080	3200400	and the other part, another part of my, um, my, uh, F.U. goes towards, um, people who
3200400	3204200	are thinking that Christmas is the actually only the celebration that happens around this
3204200	3209200	year, when there's a bunch of different religions that celebrate around the same, you know,
3209200	3215120	time every year, and that really Christmas should actually be in, like, spring, if you're,
3215120	3219320	if you're going by, quote, biblical standards, because the census would have happened in
3219320	3222200	the spring, and you guys stole a pagan holiday.
3222200	3225400	Thank you, Catholic Church, but, you know.
3225400	3227160	You can address those cards and letters to Jamie at Orange.
3227160	3228160	I'll show you that.
3228160	3231440	What about the people that have the big inflatable snow globes in their front lawn?
3231440	3233040	You gotta love that shit, huh?
3233040	3241440	Okay, I don't mind one, but I drove by a house that had three, and a giant inflatable Santa,
3241440	3245720	whose legs were broken, so he was laying on his nose.
3245720	3246720	This is in my neighborhood.
3246720	3249020	That's a prime target for a BB gun drive.
3249020	3250400	Someone broke Santa's legs?
3250400	3251400	That's not very nice.
3251400	3252400	Someone broke Santa's legs.
3252400	3254960	Santa gives a mobster his present this year.
3254960	3261880	But, but no, I, there's just, you know, I, I really, it's the whole over-commercialism
3261880	3266280	of everything, and the, the fact that people get so close-minded, okay, here's part three
3266280	3267680	of my Christmas F.U.
3267680	3268680	Oh, Christ.
3268680	3269680	Drivers!
3269680	3275720	Because I can't do an F.U. without bringing up how stupidly mean people get during the
3275720	3276720	holidays!
3276720	3283760	Okay, I, I went to buy something at the store, and this person's pushing past me, buying
3283760	3287480	their Christmas tree, and I'm like, I was in line for-
3287480	3288480	AHHH!
3288480	3289480	I'm like, shit!
3289480	3294280	And then, and then everybody drives, like, a freakin' retard on the road, because they
3294280	3297120	have to get to the mall, ooh.
3297120	3303400	And it's just like, okay, what happened to the whole, you know, being nice to everybody
3303400	3308200	during the holidays, and trying to, to share the spirit and everything, because people
3308200	3312600	don't give a shit about the Christmas spirit, they care about their own personal agenda.
3312600	3317000	You know, maybe there should be more ball shootings, if that were the case.
3317000	3318000	Whoa!
3318000	3319000	Whoa!
3319000	3322600	I wouldn't go there, wow, too soon, too soon.
3322600	3327520	No, no, no, no, but, but this is the whole thing, is that, you know, people are, you
3327520	3333760	know, and I'm getting this from the same people, where they're all like, oh, well, you know,
3333760	3339120	holiday this, you know, have to be nice, baby Jesus, whatever, and then these same people
3339120	3344640	are being complete and utter assholes, and I'm, I'm not even, you know, making this up,
3344640	3351120	I'm seeing people that I know do this, and I'm like, God, what a freakin' hypocrite, you
3351120	3352120	know?
3352120	3355720	Just, don't open your mouth around me ever again.
3355720	3360160	Alright, quick chatroom comments, this is J100Matt, says, apparently the higher your
3360160	3362760	energy bill, the more Jesus and God love you.
3362760	3363760	That's brilliant.
3363760	3366920	Alright, let's move on with the FUs.
3366920	3374240	Anyways, FU2, the kids across the street from my apartment complex were having car wash
3374240	3375240	today.
3375240	3380960	They started at about nine this morning, yelling, oh, by the way, there was also one of those
3380960	3384320	cars, you know, the ones that have the sound systems that are way too loud with way too
3384320	3391800	much bass, that was playing from nine in the morning to about five in the afternoon, and
3391800	3399040	these kids yelling, car wash, car wash, car wash, for like seven fucking hours, I mean,
3399040	3402640	it's just so annoying all day long.
3402640	3407280	Oh, and then also, FU2, my neighbors who apparently thought it was fun to have a party at four
3407280	3412960	in the morning with their drunken friends who were riding a bike that some kid left
3412960	3416840	outside and you're honking the horn on the bike, so no.
3416840	3420720	Wow, you live in a classy part of town, that sucks.
3420720	3421720	That's it.
3421720	3425560	Uh, puppy, why don't you go ahead.
3425560	3433200	Big FU to ITT Technical Institute and your terrible scheduling policies, because I tried,
3433200	3437280	I started my program for drafting last year.
3437280	3442280	I should have been done by now, but I'm not going to graduate until six months from now
3442280	3447360	because when I change my schedule once, it can really fuck me up for the rest of the
3447360	3448360	year.
3448360	3451720	It's like, oh yeah, we'll get a teacher to teach that one class for you since you didn't
3451720	3455840	get to finish it in that quarter, and they didn't offer it for three more quarters, so
3455840	3460360	now I'm really behind, and it's going to cost me more money, and I'm pissed, and now I have
3460360	3462440	to take four classes this quarter.
3462440	3470600	Um, well, I don't think I really have any FUs myself, um, I'm actually kind of having
3470600	3476200	a good week, so I guess FU to the fact that it's been so cold lately, I'll give a FU that,
3476200	3481000	my house has been very cold lately, and, um, you know, since we live in California, we're
3481000	3484560	very spoiled when it comes to cold, and just the slightest bit of cold air, it's like,
3484560	3492520	oh my god, get a jacket, FU to magazine solicitors too, I had three of them on my door this week.
3492520	3496680	Somebody came to my door last night, and I told him that I had the flu, and that I was
3496680	3501040	highly contagious, and he really should leave.
3501040	3503560	I'm not making that up either, he's great.
3503560	3506120	He just looked at me like, okay, bye.
3506120	3507120	Wow.
3507120	3508120	I should have thought of that.
3508120	3511280	Around in this neighborhood, they just have the kids do all this listing, because it's
3511280	3514120	kind of hard to tell a kid that, you know, you're going to give them bubonic plague if
3514120	3515680	they don't get off your doorstep.
3515680	3520560	Or you just, you know, open your door wearing nothing but a towel.
3520560	3526600	I still, though, have my favorite story about my friend with the Jehovah's Witnesses, while
3526600	3532600	she was listening to Tubular Bells, making a red velvet cake, so she came out with this
3532600	3539760	knife with, like, red fluid on it, and said, WHAT?
3539760	3544960	This is my friend that used to work for Lockheed.
3544960	3546720	Alright, let's move on.
3546720	3549320	We gotta get back to gaming news, weirdos.
3549320	3553680	Alright, oh, and what a heck of a story to get back into.
3553680	3557960	Yes, our buddy Jeff Girtzman, which took up about an hour of last week's show.
3557960	3561240	We have some quick updates, and I don't want to spend too much time talking in this, because
3561240	3565000	I'll be goddamn if this story just didn't blow up way more than it should have.
3565000	3566560	You gotta fire it, get over it.
3566560	3567560	Yeah, exactly.
3567560	3568560	Anyhow.
3568560	3569560	Was it that crap you were talking about?
3569560	3574880	Yeah, I was trying to catch Jamie up on what happened when she was out, so anyhow, here's
3574880	3575880	your updates.
3575880	3577800	I should have some music that plays during this.
3577800	3578800	Hold on, I need music.
3578800	3582000	Jamie, why don't you give us your thoughts on the issue while we get some happy music
3582000	3583800	to play during the Girtzman update.
3583800	3584800	Happy music?
3584800	3585800	Should we play some Lincoln Park?
3585800	3586800	There's too much fun in this.
3586800	3593680	Oh, it's too bad that I don't have the song from End of Evangelion, the happy suicide
3593680	3594680	song.
3594680	3595680	Alright, hold on.
3595680	3597680	We'll play some happy music here while we give you the Jeff Girtzman update.
3597680	3598680	I agree too, and stars.
3598680	3601680	Oh yeah, I got it.
3601680	3604360	Alright.
3604360	3610760	This week in Girtzmanville, Girtzman made a comment to Joystick.com.
3610760	3616560	Saying, quote, I stand behind my work, regardless of where I do it.
3616560	3621760	If there was content that I felt I couldn't support, it wouldn't see the light of day.
3621760	3627320	Then later on, this week, GameSpot posted a Q&A.
3627320	3631760	Here's a clip from the Q&A, question, was Eidos Interactive upset by the game's review?
3631760	3636700	Answer, it has been confirmed that Eidos representatives expressed their displeasure to their appropriate
3636700	3639280	contacts at GameSpot, but not to editorial directly.
3639280	3643040	It was not the first time a publisher has voiced disappointment with the game review,
3643040	3644240	and it won't be the last.
3644240	3649440	However, it is strict GameSpot policy never to let any such feelings result in a review
3649440	3652280	score to be altered or a video review to be pulled.
3652280	3655800	Also, I'd like to quote Mr. Horse from Eidos.
3655800	3661780	He said, no, sir, I do not like it.
3661780	3666560	In response to the GameSpot Q&A, the users of GameSpot said, thank you, you assholes,
3666560	3669520	for posting that a whole four days late.
3669520	3675100	Then later on this week, as if no more could go wrong with Kane and Lynch, the review site
3675100	3680320	got criticized by, I'm sorry, the reviews got criticized by Kotaku.
3680320	3682080	They were posting clips of reviews.
3682080	3687800	One of the clips happened to be from Kotaku, and it had a five-star logo above the review,
3687800	3691320	which makes you think, five-star review.
3691320	3695140	But in fact, the five stars were just a graphic, and Kotaku was pissed off because they don't
3695140	3697520	review games in stars.
3697520	3701120	They don't review games, period.
3701120	3703600	So that's from a preview of the game.
3703600	3708720	And that's your update on what's going on in Gertsmanville.
3708720	3709720	And to be honest, I don't really care anymore.
3709720	3710720	Now, stop caring.
3710720	3711720	I'm stopped.
3711720	3712720	Hey, Rob?
3712720	3713720	Yes.
3713720	3714720	I didn't care in the first place.
3714720	3715920	I'm glad to hear it.
3715920	3717640	That's because you're all better people than I.
3717640	3721840	That's because I wasn't here, thank God.
3721840	3722840	All right.
3722840	3725520	Let's move on, then, past Gershman Gate, if we could.
3725520	3732080	Well, I have something that's a little happy, except that I think that it was already there.
3732080	3737860	There's a press release come out from Gravity that they've opened a US studio under the
3737860	3744240	name of L5 Games, and they've hired Blizzard folks to help run it.
3744240	3750160	But the thing is that, now, since it's in San Mateo, but I actually remember trying
3750160	3756560	to report Gravity to the Better Business Bureau.
3756560	3758320	The fuck?
3758320	3765720	When I was still on IRO because of some sort of banning of an account that was falsely
3765720	3766720	done.
3766720	3767720	This was a long time ago.
3767720	3774080	But I was trying to find the stuff for somebody to report them to the Better Business Bureau,
3774080	3778800	and it turned out that every time I tried to pull up the address for them, it came up
3778800	3781280	with a San Mateo address.
3781280	3785880	But this was like six years ago that this address was there.
3785880	3789200	So I'm like, didn't they already have a US branch?
3789200	3791160	Well, apparently the company didn't know.
3791160	3792980	That's why they put out the press release.
3792980	3793980	Maybe they just had a PO box there.
3793980	3794980	Oh, my God, we do?
3794980	3796440	We should let everyone know.
3796440	3799520	They had a mailboxes, et cetera, box there in San Mateo.
3799520	3800520	That's about it.
3800520	3803320	What was the Better Business Bureau going to do to them anyways, write them a nasty
3803320	3804320	letter?
3804320	3809760	Well, you know, buy-write got shut down.
3809760	3812560	True.
3812560	3819040	And it was pretty much because of all the crappy feedback that came back.
3819040	3821120	That's why we have the Better Business Bureau.
3821120	3823000	They just supply feedback.
3823000	3824000	Gravity's just coming over to the US.
3824000	3828000	I got free food because I reported a restaurant to the Better Business Bureau.
3828000	3832180	They're going to increase their presence in the US so that Gravity can single-handedly
3832180	3834720	take on Activision Blizzard.
3834720	3835720	That's what it is, right?
3835720	3836720	Good luck.
3836720	3837720	All right.
3837720	3841400	I'll stick with my private servers.
3841400	3842400	Thank you.
3842400	3847360	Anyways, let's see here.
3847360	3850600	Sometimes you might compare Gravity to Sucking.
3850600	3855920	There's service and stuff, so well, here's something else that sucks or that probably
3855920	3856920	will suck.
3856920	3858680	The Castlevania movie.
3858680	3864560	And yeah, okay, let me put it this way, and this will save us a lot of time in the future.
3864560	3869640	Every single movie that's probably being written right now is on hold because of the writer's
3869640	3870640	strike.
3870640	3874280	Because you have no writer, you can't have any story being written.
3874280	3882320	So like that, the Castlevania movie is on hold because of the writer's strike.
3882320	3890940	Not that it's on hold from Sucking, I guess, I don't know, it's like slowing down a retard
3890940	3894880	running towards a cliff or something like that, I mean, as soon as you let go of them,
3894880	3896760	they're just going to topple over the end.
3896760	3897760	Wow!
3897760	3902160	What in the hell is, like, is there something in the air that's causing everybody to make
3902160	3904520	very, very unpolitically correct statements tonight?
3904520	3905520	I mean, what the hell?
3905520	3907440	We're going to get lots of letters this week.
3907440	3909920	Where have you been for the last, you know, 300 and some episodes?
3909920	3913280	I don't know, in a cave.
3913280	3914280	Or 200 and some episodes.
3914280	3915280	What episode are we on?
3915280	3916280	250?
3916280	3917280	259!
3917280	3919280	I've been doing 100 more episodes, Sam!
3919280	3923040	I've been working way too damn hard, not recording one of them, but you know what?
3923040	3926040	I do it for practice.
3926040	3933760	Okay, I was going to make some joke about somebody actually writes those video game
3933760	3938900	movies, but anyway, I totally lost it amongst Loki's high sense of sarcasm.
3938900	3942560	So why don't we spoil the VGAs, which are going on right now on the TV.
3942560	3946880	Yes, did you know we're competing against the VGAs tonight, our live stream?
3946880	3948440	So here, why don't we ruin it for you?

4004080	4005400	Sponsored by Do.
4005400	4007900	Although I think that was just a joke, actually, yeah.
4007900	4012320	So there, we just did you a favor and saved you from sitting through three hours of garbage
4012320	4014320	advertisements and musical performances.
4014320	4015420	There you have it.
4015420	4018760	You can send us the thank you cards, you can send us Christmas cards.
4018760	4023920	We'll play Devil's Advocate here and not to pull you away from listening to our wonderful
4023920	4027880	show, but they are going to have a new trailer for Borderlands, which looks pretty awesome.
4027880	4029400	It'll be on YouTube tomorrow.
4029400	4031680	But it looks awesome!
4031680	4032680	I want to see it now.
4032680	4035720	It'll look awesome tomorrow on YouTube.
4035720	4041360	Well, going on a tangent with Spike TV, yesterday I was watching a marathon of one of their
4041360	4043600	reality shows because I was bored.
4043600	4044600	Cheaters?
4044600	4047040	No, it was the Ultimate Fighter.
4047040	4051280	It was leading up to their finale UFC thing last night.
4051280	4055120	For eight straight hours, there was nothing but teasing about, oh, we're going to show
4055120	4059840	the cinematic opening to World of Warcraft during the UFC event.
4059840	4063280	And it was the original opening from, you know, three years, it's three years old.
4063280	4067320	And they're going to show this on live TV at a UFC event.
4067320	4071200	I couldn't, I couldn't think of a worse audience to target that at.
4071200	4073560	Chad Compton for the new expansion.
4073560	4078280	No, it was the original cinematic opening to the World of Warcraft, it wasn't Burning
4078280	4079280	Crusade.
4079280	4084340	Comment from Chad, Dark Tetsuya said, the Spike Video Game Awards have been sponsored
4084340	4092920	by Harmonix, 2K Games, EA Sports, it's in the game, and by Mountain Dew, do the Dew.
4092920	4100800	So in stuff that people actually care about, how about Silent Hill News?
4100800	4102000	Ah, yes.
4102000	4103000	Yes please.
4103000	4104480	Silent Hill 5 News?
4104480	4106440	Well, more like Silent Hill Origins.
4106440	4107440	Ah, okay.
4107440	4110800	They're talking about it having a PlayStation 2 port.
4110800	4112640	Oh, that'll be kind of fun.
4112640	4114880	Yeah, that'll be pretty cool.
4114880	4123800	They're saying that it would, it's actually of course being, I think published by Climax.
4123800	4129120	And they would also be presenting a second release.
4129120	4134160	Hmm, that'll be kind of nice because Silent Hill is one of those games I can't really
4134160	4135960	get into on a handheld platform.
4135960	4139360	It's kind of something I need on a very large TV with all the lights out so I can cry like
4139360	4141600	a little girl when the monsters come out to eat me.
4141600	4145800	Yeah, but you see, all you have to do is just get one of those nice PSPs with the video
4145800	4147480	out and then you can play it on your TV.
4147480	4149920	Ah, that's true, but I don't have that because I'm not cool.
4149920	4155160	Well, the second thing that they're working on is actually an unannounced project.
4155160	4157240	Dun, dun, dun.
4157240	4160560	I hope they just announce it.
4160560	4161560	Was that it?
4161560	4162560	I don't think that was it.
4162560	4166520	Because if you announce an unannounced project, isn't that announcing the project?
4166520	4167920	How about an untitled project?
4167920	4168920	There you go.
4168920	4173440	Or I should say a secret project because it may have a title, we just don't know what
4173440	4174440	it is.
4174440	4178360	It's not secret anymore if you just talked about it.
4178360	4181080	Mac Man in our chat room says something interesting here.
4181080	4185480	Mac Man says Silent Hill 5 equals awesome and win and shit in my pants.
4185480	4190200	What kind of comment is that?
4190200	4193320	Gerardo Mo says Silent Hill needs to go steal all the VGAs.
4193320	4194320	Yes, I agree.
4194320	4195880	He said that Pyramid Head goes to Silent Hill.
4195880	4199600	Pyramid Head needs to come do an acceptance speech and then...
4199600	4201120	He'll make it with his big knife.
4201120	4202560	That's right.
4202560	4203880	To the entire front row.
4203880	4208920	And we'll have to wait until next year then, I guess.
4208920	4210400	Wouldn't that be a dream?
4210400	4214720	Anyways, people are up in arms because GameTap's removing games.
4214720	4216320	No.
4216320	4220640	Some games you will not be able to play on GameTap anymore include Arthur's First Grade,
4220640	4222720	Bionic Bunny's Good Deeds Contest.
4222720	4227480	Okay, now hold the fuck up because there are actually some good games on that list, Loki.
4227480	4231760	Stop being such a dick.
4231760	4234840	I think one of the Civilization games is on there.
4234840	4237320	No.
4237320	4238560	I know there's games on there.
4238560	4240320	Impossible Mission was on there.
4240320	4241960	Oh, Impossible Mission.
4241960	4243360	Oh, my mistake.
4243360	4244360	That game's cool.
4244360	4245360	Just shut your mouth.
4245360	4248480	Anyways, yes, such wonderful games as Chip's Challenge.
4248480	4252360	Does anyone remember that from Windows 3.1?
4252360	4253360	Command & Conquer.
4253360	4254360	Okay, that was a pretty good game.
4254360	4259960	Command & Conquer Red Alert, Descent, 2, 3, and Free Space.
4259960	4262120	Oh, all the Ultima games are going offline.
4262120	4263120	Earthworm Jim.
4263120	4264120	Ultima's awesome.
4264120	4265120	Earthworm Jim 2.
4265120	4268120	Earthworm Jim 3D.
4268120	4269480	Free Space 2.
4269480	4271160	Impossible Mission 2.
4271160	4272160	Woo-hoo.
4272160	4273160	MDK.
4273160	4274520	Pretty good.
4274520	4275520	See Jerk.
4275520	4276520	Whatever.
4276520	4279200	You know, and then other games like Pajama Sam.
4279200	4281720	Life is rough when you lose stuff.
4281720	4282720	Oh.
4282720	4283720	Okay.
4283720	4291120	Or Pajama Sam, you are what you eat from your head to your feet.
4291120	4292120	Pajama Sam.
4292120	4294440	Games to play on any day.
4294440	4295440	Alright.
4295440	4299520	Obviously, though, it's kind of sad because some of those games, like even you admit MDK
4299520	4303800	and some of that stuff is kind of cool, the service is losing, and a lot of people are
4303800	4305720	like, oh noes, why is GameTap deleting games?
4305720	4308680	But I think the answer is probably just as simple as time's up.
4308680	4310560	You know, they probably have these signed agreements.
4310560	4312780	Their licensing's up with that, you know.
4312780	4314120	This will also make someone sad.
4314120	4315680	American Deer Hunting 2000.
4315680	4316680	Okay.
4316680	4319440	Aren't all the games that are being pulled, like most of them come from one or two different
4319440	4320440	companies, right?
4320440	4323600	Like EA is one of them, and there's, I think, another one.
4323600	4328320	And I think this probably just kind of screams that, hmm, EA is probably going to do their
4328320	4332120	own thing, or EA is going to be signing a deal with somebody else soon where they're
4332120	4333120	getting more money.
4333120	4336840	Like some of the sim games are leaving, like Sim Toons, I didn't even realize there was
4336840	4347200	a Sim Toons, Sim Tower, Sim Safari, Sim Park, Sim City 2000, Sim City Classic, Tetris, C.
4347200	4348840	There's some good stuff leaving.
4348840	4349840	Whatever.
4349840	4353640	Seriously, it's like Winter Games.
4353640	4354640	Alright.
4354640	4356400	Well, we'll see what happens.
4356400	4357400	Who knows?
4357400	4360520	Maybe they'll be starting their own competing service soon, or maybe it's somebody else.
4360520	4361520	Damn it!
4361520	4362520	What?
4362520	4364720	Putt Putt's One Stop Fun Shop is gone!
4364720	4368760	What am I going to play now?
4368760	4372960	Also I want to say, it kind of sucks for them because they just had this big brouhaha over
4372960	4377600	hooray, we hit our 1,000th game, and now losing these 70 games is going to put them back under
4377600	4378600	1,000.
4378600	4382080	So I think it would be funny if in January they say, we hit our 1,000th game again!
4382080	4383360	They should.
4383360	4385840	That would be hilarious.
4385840	4392520	Anyhow, let's wrap up part A of our show here.
4392520	4396800	We're going to be back in a little bit with part B, but not before we do the Classic Game
4396800	4402120	of the Week, because we always like to close off part A of our show by paying respects
4402120	4409320	to our elders, and we do that by bringing up the Classic Game of the Week.
4409320	4415280	Dark Soccer, did you hear the old shows and hear the games that Loki and myself picked?
4415280	4417360	You heard mine, but did you hear what Loki picked?
4417360	4419240	Loki did Zombies Ate My Neighbors last week.
4419240	4421240	That game is great.
4421240	4423240	I was almost going to pick that one.
4423240	4424240	Almost!
4424240	4425240	I was looking at it.
4425240	4426240	Well now he beat you to it.
4426240	4427240	So what are you going to do?
4427240	4428240	I have another game.
4428240	4429240	Alright, well alright.
4429240	4430240	Me and five other people played.
4430240	4434240	Alright, then let's get into Dark Soccer's Game of the Week.
4434240	4442320	The game of the week is Threads of Faith, which was a Playstation RPG, but it was more
4442320	4446000	like an adventure-basher-type game in Japan.
4446000	4451840	It was called Do Prism, and you did one of two stories where you either played this sort
4451840	4460700	of spoiled brat princess who has magic ability, or you played this guy who was a construct
4460700	4467160	and his, you know, big fat axe, and it's really, it actually had pretty good graphics for being
4467160	4468160	an old Playstation game.
4468160	4473720	It was really simple for how it played, but it was really fun.
4473720	4477400	And I actually tried to play, I actually started playing through Do Prism, and then when Threads
4477400	4482800	of Faith came out, I had to just go out and get it, so, and I actually found my copy of
4482800	4485120	it the other day, which made me think about it.
4485120	4489280	It was just a really cool little game, and it had its own pretty good following overseas
4489280	4497280	too, to the point where there was a fan version of a sequel called Duo Princess, where you
4497280	4506000	play as the Princess Mint and her sister Maya, so it was pretty good.
4506000	4515120	I really just love this game, but, you know, it came out the same time that Vagrant Story,
4515120	4522240	Legend of Mana, Chrono Cross, and Parasite II came out, so it sort of fell to the sidelines,
4522240	4525080	I guess, but I liked it.
4525080	4526080	I thought it was a great game.
4526080	4528240	So you're bringing it back for another round by reminding people of it.
4528240	4532480	I wanted that more than Chrono Cross, I'll put it that way.
4532480	4538960	Yeah, Chrono Cross wasn't that great for me, yeah, but, very cool, alright, so your Game
4538960	4539960	of the Week.
4539960	4543680	And it's more Squeenix good, or more, it was actually just Squaresoft at the time.
4543680	4548680	The Game of the Week, Do Prism, also known as, what was it, Threads of Fate, Threads
4548680	4549680	of Fate.
4549680	4551640	I did not play this game, but I should.
4551640	4552640	You can borrow my copy.
4552640	4555560	Because I played some of those other games you mentioned that came out, wasn't that also
4555560	4559280	the same time that horrible, horrible Mana game came out on PSP, it wasn't, that was
4559280	4560280	Legend of Mana.
4560280	4561960	Legend of Mana, oh god, that game was awful.
4561960	4563400	I hated Legend of Mana.
4563400	4569080	I have the Japanese version of Legend of Mana, and I was like, too much text!
4569080	4573560	I read 30 Kanji, I can't read this game.
4573560	4576440	Now we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to come back in a little bit with
4576440	4579200	more of Orange Laundrio, for those of you guys on the podcast, we'll be back in a couple
4579200	4580200	days.
4580200	4582880	For those of you guys listening live, we'll be back in a little bit, and Loki, for some
4582880	4586440	reason, appears to be hooking up the Nintendo Wii, I don't know what the hell this is going
4586440	4590440	to bring.
4590440	4596360	So we'll be back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio, yeah, so stay tuned.
4596360	4600720	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights, and is podcasted to the world twice
4600720	4601720	a week.
4601720	4614720	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
