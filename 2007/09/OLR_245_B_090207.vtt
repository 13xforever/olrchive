Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.760 --> 00:22.360
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:22.360 --> 00:26.600
We are live on this Sunday evening, September 2nd of 2007.

00:26.600 --> 00:29.360
Happy Labor Day weekend to those of you guys that are in the States, to those of you guys

00:29.360 --> 00:33.320
that aren't in the States, well, happy weekend and happy Monday and hope your week is pretty

00:33.320 --> 00:34.320
cool.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.560
Anyhow, we're going to get right back into the gaming news this week.

00:36.560 --> 00:39.160
Sadly, Dark Sakura is not here this week.

00:39.160 --> 00:41.640
Labor Day weekend just happens to be our anniversary.

00:41.640 --> 00:44.680
I think she planned it that way so she could have a three-day weekend off every year, but

00:44.680 --> 00:45.680
oh well.

00:45.680 --> 00:49.680
Regardless, she's not here tonight, unfortunately, but we're still here going over the gaming

00:49.680 --> 00:50.680
news.

00:50.680 --> 00:53.160
Shane is here filling in, although he's doing a terrible job because he's just sitting here

00:53.160 --> 00:55.360
all night playing PSP.

00:55.360 --> 01:01.240
I don't have a computer to look at everybody because my computer is off.

01:01.240 --> 01:04.920
Well the thing you can look forward to is that in 40 minutes, the operator 11 thing

01:04.920 --> 01:06.880
cuts off, so then you can use that again.

01:06.880 --> 01:07.880
So there you go.

01:07.880 --> 01:08.880
Hooray.

01:08.880 --> 01:10.920
All right, let's get back into the gaming news.

01:10.920 --> 01:11.920
Loki.

01:11.920 --> 01:14.180
Anyways, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.

01:14.180 --> 01:15.400
We know it's coming out this year.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.620
We know it looks pretty good.

01:17.620 --> 01:19.640
What we didn't know is what exactly had in it.

01:19.640 --> 01:23.940
Of course now they're promising that it's going to feature more than 40 cars, tracks

01:23.940 --> 01:29.760
with reverse and alternate routes, and Gran Turismo TV, an online video channel for the

01:29.760 --> 01:31.800
PlayStation Network.

01:31.800 --> 01:36.800
Also we found out that it's going to be available online for purchase, and it's also going to

01:36.800 --> 01:42.480
be available via Blu-ray, just like Warhawk.

01:42.480 --> 01:46.800
To which I say, why don't you just finish Gran Turismo 5 instead of releasing these

01:46.800 --> 01:49.920
half games and charging people money for them?

01:49.920 --> 01:54.720
I mean seriously, stop making demos for Gran Turismo 5 and work on the damn game.

01:54.720 --> 01:58.600
Well, aren't they trying to give people a reason to keep a look out for the PlayStation

01:58.600 --> 01:59.600
3?

01:59.600 --> 02:00.600
Yeah.

02:00.600 --> 02:04.400
The reason is, oh yeah, we promised you Gran Turismo 5 at launch.

02:04.400 --> 02:05.400
Oh, guess what?

02:05.400 --> 02:06.660
It's not going to be done until next year.

02:06.660 --> 02:10.280
So what we're going to do is we're going to use this as another exclusive title, despite

02:10.280 --> 02:13.680
the fact that it's really kind of a demo, and we're going to throw it out there.

02:13.680 --> 02:17.040
Oh, and by the way, you're going to purchase Gran Turismo 5 when it comes out as well,

02:17.040 --> 02:21.040
despite the fact that it's going to have exactly the same content, plus more.

02:21.040 --> 02:24.560
GS68 says, Gran Turismo Forever.

02:24.560 --> 02:28.240
And Dark Tetsuya says, I don't know, Loki, Gran Turismo demos are usually more packed

02:28.240 --> 02:29.800
than most full-blown racing games.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.900
Yeah, but this one you have to pay for.

02:31.900 --> 02:34.040
Those comments are coming from our chatroom, chat.orangelounge80.com.

02:34.040 --> 02:39.100
I don't have a problem with Gran Turismo HD, which is free, but I do have a problem with

02:39.100 --> 02:42.640
paying for Gran Turismo 5, which is only going to have 40 cars.

02:42.640 --> 02:46.080
Here's the problem actually they're going to run into is, what if people don't really

02:46.080 --> 02:49.160
want to buy the full Gran Turismo 5?

02:49.160 --> 02:55.840
Now you have this Gran Turismo prologue that's just as good, you know, might get people through,

02:55.840 --> 03:00.600
and now they're not selling tons of copies of their $60 retail game.

03:00.600 --> 03:01.600
Uh-oh.

03:01.600 --> 03:02.600
Uh-oh.

03:02.600 --> 03:03.600
All right.

03:03.600 --> 03:09.320
Well, I know Loki has no problem with this SingStar on the PlayStation 2, because Loki

03:09.320 --> 03:11.400
loves his karaoke PS2 games, right?

03:11.400 --> 03:12.400
Oh, yeah.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.400
Oh, yeah.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.400
Totally.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.920
So why does the SingStar pack, don't tell the wife about this one, or she's going to

03:16.920 --> 03:17.920
want you to buy it?

03:17.920 --> 03:18.920
She doesn't care.

03:18.920 --> 03:19.920
Oh, okay.

03:19.920 --> 03:20.920
Good.

03:20.920 --> 03:21.920
Why doesn't she care?

03:21.920 --> 03:22.920
I thought she loved karaoke games.

03:22.920 --> 03:23.920
Because I'm not going to buy them.

03:23.920 --> 03:24.920
Okay.

03:24.920 --> 03:25.920
Did you affirm that?

03:25.920 --> 03:26.920
Did you tell the wife about the karaoke games?

03:26.920 --> 03:30.200
I told her I wouldn't buy them, and I told her that there was this coming out, and she's

03:30.200 --> 03:31.480
like, so?

03:31.480 --> 03:32.480
So what?

03:32.480 --> 03:33.480
Yeah.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.480
She wants to spend the money on herself.

03:34.480 --> 03:39.480
I'll buy her SingStar PS3 if she wants, and she can record herself singing on like...

03:39.480 --> 03:41.440
I want to come over and play that if you guys get it.

03:41.440 --> 03:42.700
PlayStation Network and stuff.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.000
I will not touch this game.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Yes, you will.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.360
As I will not touch the singing portion of Rock Band.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.360
Yes, you will.

03:48.360 --> 03:51.760
All we have to do is to, one night when you don't drive, we have to get you to drink a

03:51.760 --> 03:53.520
little bit, and then you'll be good.

03:53.520 --> 03:54.520
Okay.

03:54.520 --> 03:55.840
You were at my bachelor party.

03:55.840 --> 03:57.640
I was near alcohol, boys.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.360
Which, by the way, is on YouTube.

03:59.360 --> 04:03.120
If you want to see Loki driving Mario Kart drunk, just search for Orange Lawn Radio.

04:03.120 --> 04:04.120
It's there.

04:04.120 --> 04:06.680
Too bad we didn't have the rest of the stuff on there, like me playing miniature golf.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.240
Oh, that was so freaking funny.

04:08.240 --> 04:10.560
I still have the videos for that.

04:10.560 --> 04:16.200
Anyways though, but yeah, I was pretty sick with tons of alcohol, and they tried to get

04:16.200 --> 04:19.440
me to sing karaoke at a bar, and I would not do it.

04:19.440 --> 04:23.760
So I will not sing karaoke no matter how much alcohol is in me.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.280
All right, well, damn.

04:26.280 --> 04:31.320
Well anyway, if I could get to the story, SingStar is coming out on the PlayStation

04:31.320 --> 04:32.320
2.

04:32.320 --> 04:36.300
Well, it's already there, but the thing is that now there is a bundle coming out.

04:36.300 --> 04:42.920
It's $150 US, and it's coming out with SingStar, and I'm trying to figure out which version

04:42.920 --> 04:43.920
of SingStar it is.

04:43.920 --> 04:49.520
SingStar Pop is coming out in November, and it's going to be a white PlayStation 2 to

04:49.520 --> 04:53.060
perfectly match your Wii if you are so inclined.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.280
So enjoy that.

04:54.280 --> 04:55.280
150 bucks.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.640
Not a bad deal for those two games.

04:56.640 --> 05:00.920
It also, by the way, comes with a controller, a white controller, and two microphones.

05:00.920 --> 05:04.920
So you're all set for a karaoke party with this if you're a SingStar fan.

05:04.920 --> 05:08.600
I mean, I know some people prefer Karaoke Revolution, but it really isn't at all the

05:08.600 --> 05:09.600
same game in the end.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.600
It's people making asses of themselves in front of their friends, right?

05:12.600 --> 05:13.600
Yeah.

05:13.600 --> 05:14.600
All right.

05:14.600 --> 05:19.120
We touched on this a little bit in part A with the whole Manhunt 2 being re-rated thing,

05:19.120 --> 05:26.920
but Cinder Yee, Leland Yee from California, is actually on the record saying that he favors

05:26.920 --> 05:33.240
the adults-only rating and wishes that they allowed those to be played on consoles.

05:33.240 --> 05:38.320
Basically, you know, that there should be an adult-only rated game instead of having

05:38.320 --> 05:40.200
the Censor games.

05:40.200 --> 05:43.680
And I think he'd probably like to see a lot more of the mature-rated games being adult-only

05:43.680 --> 05:49.160
because that is pretty self-explanatory.

05:49.160 --> 05:50.440
It's for adults only.

05:50.440 --> 05:55.320
It's not, you know, maybe some parent thinks, oh, my kid's mature enough to play this game,

05:55.320 --> 05:56.320
you know.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.280
Instead of that, it is pretty self-explanatory.

05:58.280 --> 05:59.280
And I agree with him.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.440
I think that they should have adult-only games on consoles.

06:01.440 --> 06:04.000
I mean, consoles are for everyone.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.600
It's not just for families.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.600
And you know what?

06:06.600 --> 06:07.600
So what?

06:07.600 --> 06:11.560
If you rate it AO and, you know, Walmart and everybody does not decide to carry it, that's

06:11.560 --> 06:12.800
the publisher's decision.

06:12.800 --> 06:17.120
They know what they're getting into and what hurdles they're going to have to overcome

06:17.120 --> 06:22.120
rating it AO or having a game being released rated AO.

06:22.120 --> 06:25.400
But I think it also would give them a lot more freedom to put whatever the fuck they

06:25.400 --> 06:28.580
want in it, which would be awesome.

06:28.580 --> 06:35.040
It is kind of interesting that the guy's been branded as this anti-video games guy, but

06:35.040 --> 06:41.000
I find it very interesting that he is actually supportive of, okay, the content can be out

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
there.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.980
You know, I don't care if the AO content is out there, and in fact, we should have a place

06:44.980 --> 06:49.060
for it, but just not falling in children's laps or whatever.

06:49.060 --> 06:51.560
We need to police it so that it doesn't get in children's laps.

06:51.560 --> 06:56.400
He basically says in the OA, the use of the ambiguous term mature, many parents are left

06:56.400 --> 07:02.360
with a false sense of how violent an emirated game may be, and obviously, even with some

07:02.360 --> 07:10.240
retailers as, of course, the Federal Trade Commission study suggested.

07:10.240 --> 07:13.280
I just think, you know, I think they should do it.

07:13.280 --> 07:14.360
I think somebody should try.

07:14.360 --> 07:20.520
You know, it's just like they say whoever's going to win the HD DVD and Blu-ray war is

07:20.520 --> 07:24.480
going to be whatever system gets the most porn, is going to be what decides that war.

07:24.480 --> 07:30.880
I mean, seriously, we're not banning adult DVDs out there, and I would think that that's

07:30.880 --> 07:36.200
a lot easier for kids to get a hold of than, you know, adult games.

07:36.200 --> 07:41.280
But they need to get past the point that games are not just for kids.

07:41.280 --> 07:43.760
It's an entertainment media.

07:43.760 --> 07:44.760
It's for everybody.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.840
It can be anything, all age ranges.

07:47.840 --> 07:52.300
So get past that and start treating it like it is any other media.

07:52.300 --> 07:57.200
You know, make it available to the consumers that it's appropriate for.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.200
Alright.

07:58.200 --> 08:04.440
Well, one game I'd like to see an AO version of someday is Silent Hill, because the game

08:04.440 --> 08:06.760
is very sick and twisted as it is in its mature format.

08:06.760 --> 08:09.120
Imagine if they could step up the violence even more.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.960
You're a big fan of Silent Hill, aren't you, Mipotas?

08:10.960 --> 08:11.960
Yes.

08:11.960 --> 08:12.960
Yes.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.240
Would you like to see a version that's even more violent?

08:15.240 --> 08:16.240
Yes.

08:16.240 --> 08:17.240
No.

08:17.240 --> 08:18.240
No?

08:18.240 --> 08:19.240
No.

08:19.240 --> 08:20.240
Does it scare you as it is already?

08:20.240 --> 08:22.040
No, I don't think it's about violence in that game.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.600
Disturbing imagery, yes.

08:23.600 --> 08:24.600
Violence, no.

08:24.600 --> 08:25.600
Alright.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.800
Well, there will be plenty of disturbing imagery in Silent Hill 5.

08:28.800 --> 08:33.560
The collective who's developing the game, as you know, it's kind of a controversial

08:33.560 --> 08:36.440
decision that the collective is developing this, so it's being actually developed in

08:36.440 --> 08:38.320
the US and not in Japan.

08:38.320 --> 08:42.320
But the collective is developing this game and they are actually borrowing elements from

08:42.320 --> 08:46.640
the Christoph Ganz version of Silent Hill, which would be the movie.

08:46.640 --> 08:50.120
Apparently they were big fans of kind of the way that the characters moved around in the

08:50.120 --> 08:51.120
movie.

08:51.120 --> 08:55.480
So there will be some motion capture for the monsters in the Silent Hill 5 game.

08:55.480 --> 08:56.920
All of the monsters.

08:56.920 --> 09:01.040
And they are borrowing the whole night to day element that was in the movie.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.700
Remember how in the movie it would switch from, you know, I guess you could say night

09:04.700 --> 09:08.700
to day or good Silent Hill to bad Silent Hill, it would kind of switch?

09:08.700 --> 09:10.360
That's going to happen in Silent Hill 5.

09:10.360 --> 09:13.560
And now you were actually reading up a little more on Silent Hill 5.

09:13.560 --> 09:16.720
Some article that was in a recent gaming magazine, right, Mipotas?

09:16.720 --> 09:17.720
Yeah.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.760
And what other details did it give about the game?

09:19.760 --> 09:23.340
The nurses are the nurses from the movie, like, full on.

09:23.340 --> 09:27.240
They're the ones that are attracted to light and they look exactly the same.

09:27.240 --> 09:29.600
What was this whole thing about now the monsters will chase you?

09:29.600 --> 09:34.520
Oh yeah, the monsters just won't, you can't just run by monsters anymore, like, apparently

09:34.520 --> 09:37.760
they kick down doors to get to you, which is really cool.

09:37.760 --> 09:40.480
And I don't know, I can't wait for it.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.880
I can't wait to get some of my friends who get really scared by these games, like I'm

09:43.880 --> 09:47.920
thinking of one in particular that cried when she was fighting one of the boss monsters

09:47.920 --> 09:48.920
in Silent Hill 3.

09:48.920 --> 09:49.920
Oh, that was the best thing ever.

09:49.920 --> 09:54.080
I can't wait to get her to play this game because I'm evil and vindictive and I think

09:54.080 --> 09:57.200
it's going to be hilarious when the monsters start kicking down doors to get to her.

09:57.200 --> 10:01.040
Yeah, she'll throw the controller down and run into a different room and cry.

10:01.040 --> 10:04.320
And hopefully we'll have it all up on one of these video streaming sites for you to

10:04.320 --> 10:05.320
enjoy.

10:05.320 --> 10:07.640
What you guys don't get about our friend, though, is, like, I'll go and pretend I'm

10:07.640 --> 10:10.920
one of the monsters, I won't be dressed up or anything, I'll just walk like they were

10:10.920 --> 10:13.440
and she hates it and freaks out.

10:13.440 --> 10:14.840
So good.

10:14.840 --> 10:18.800
pikaruno agrees, I get so scared I can't even play Silent Hill.

10:18.800 --> 10:23.560
The first Silent Hill, I'm sure I've mentioned this before, but when I tried to play it,

10:23.560 --> 10:27.720
I stopped it nine times at the very beginning because it was too scary.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.600
That's just how great these games are.

10:29.600 --> 10:30.600
Wow.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.120
That's cool.

10:32.120 --> 10:35.720
Asdartitsuyu in our chatroom says, what a horrible night to have a curse.

10:35.720 --> 10:36.720
Funny.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.620
Because it's a Castlevania reference, never mind.

10:39.620 --> 10:41.280
I don't even get it.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.300
Forget it.

10:43.300 --> 10:44.440
That's all I have to say on Silent Hill.

10:44.440 --> 10:45.760
I'm definitely looking forward to Silent Hill 5.

10:45.760 --> 10:46.760
I looked at the same article, too.

10:46.760 --> 10:48.640
It looks like it's going to be pretty sweet.

10:48.640 --> 10:54.080
Actually, let me ask real quick, Shane, since you're such a big fan of the series from before,

10:54.080 --> 10:56.280
are you looking forward to this?

10:56.280 --> 10:59.000
I know that you were a little nervous when you heard it was going to a different developer

10:59.000 --> 11:01.920
and it's being developed outside of Japan, but seeing kind of what they've done with

11:01.920 --> 11:03.080
it, are you looking forward to it?

11:03.080 --> 11:05.000
Are you still a little nervous or what?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
I'm still nervous.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.120
The screenshots are good looking, but that doesn't tell you how the game plays or if

11:10.120 --> 11:15.280
the story is really good or if they have the elements that make it Silent Hill in the game

11:15.280 --> 11:16.280
or not.

11:16.280 --> 11:20.160
It could just be like, I don't know, they could have made a really nice looking, what

11:20.160 --> 11:22.960
was that crappy game called?

11:22.960 --> 11:26.520
The one where you were all the teenagers in the school and all the plant monsters were

11:26.520 --> 11:29.320
obscure or something like that.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.040
Why are you shaking your head at me a lot?

11:31.040 --> 11:32.040
Nothing.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.040
I'm just...

11:33.040 --> 11:34.040
Oh, yeah.

11:34.040 --> 11:35.040
It could be like that.

11:35.040 --> 11:36.880
That could look really pretty, but it could be a terrible game like that game was.

11:36.880 --> 11:37.880
So I don't know.

11:37.880 --> 11:38.880
I hope, but...

11:38.880 --> 11:42.560
Maybe the liquor is just starting to kick in, so I'm just nodding a little more than

11:42.560 --> 11:43.560
usual.

11:43.560 --> 11:44.560
Okay.

11:44.560 --> 11:45.560
Maybe.

11:45.560 --> 11:46.560
Maybe.

11:46.560 --> 11:47.560
Maybe.

11:47.560 --> 11:48.560
All right.

11:48.560 --> 11:49.560
I'm done.

11:49.560 --> 11:50.560
Next story.

11:50.560 --> 11:56.080
Anywho, so one game I'm not too excited about, Loco Roco for the PS3.

11:56.080 --> 12:03.080
It's been dated for a release in Japan on the PlayStation Network September 21st, and

12:03.080 --> 12:05.240
no price is announced yet.

12:05.240 --> 12:15.180
It's looks like Odeo Loco Roco Boo Boo Coco Reco or something, I don't know.

12:15.180 --> 12:17.080
All you need to know is that...

12:17.080 --> 12:18.080
Wait.

12:18.080 --> 12:23.120
Loco Roco Boo Goo Coco for Coco Puff Roco Boco is what it is.

12:23.120 --> 12:27.560
What it probably means is, they don't know that it's just an interactive screen saver.

12:27.560 --> 12:31.440
You fuck tards and you're going to pay money for this, thinking it's a real game, and ha,

12:31.440 --> 12:34.640
ha, we screw you over again.

12:34.640 --> 12:35.640
That's exactly...

12:35.640 --> 12:39.640
Loco Roco Coo Coo Boco fuck tard, is that it?

12:39.640 --> 12:42.240
Basically, the game is an interactive screen saver.

12:42.240 --> 12:49.720
You will be able to use the six axis to tilt Loco Rocos around, but that's about it.

12:49.720 --> 12:51.440
So hooray!

12:51.440 --> 12:54.520
Thank you for yet another awesome game, Sony.

12:54.520 --> 12:55.520
You rock.

12:55.520 --> 12:58.520
Do you think Loco Roco just jumped the shark with this?

12:58.520 --> 13:04.800
I think it's just, why even bother calling this a game, or even have to purchase it,

13:04.800 --> 13:08.080
if it's, you know, not even really a game.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.640
It's just a fucking screen saver.

13:09.640 --> 13:13.640
Well, speaking of content available on the PlayStation Network, there's something brand

13:13.640 --> 13:17.240
new available on the PlayStation Network for those of you guys in the UK.

13:17.240 --> 13:18.800
It's the Dirt demo.

13:18.800 --> 13:22.680
If you want to check out the brand new game Dirt, there's a demo for you guys on the UK

13:22.680 --> 13:25.120
marketplace, which should be interesting to note.

13:25.120 --> 13:30.480
The US also got this demo along with other stuff, but unfortunately those you guys overseas

13:30.480 --> 13:36.320
get the shaft yet again in terms of content available in your PlayStation 3 marketplace.

13:36.320 --> 13:38.920
Have a nice day, but enjoy the Dirt demo.

13:38.920 --> 13:42.760
It's a pretty looking game, but I couldn't control it at all, but it's just not my kind

13:42.760 --> 13:43.760
of racing game.

13:43.760 --> 13:46.320
That's just me, I guess.

13:46.320 --> 13:51.900
Anyways, one other game that you probably won't see over in the UK also is being developed

13:51.900 --> 13:55.200
by Homeland Security in the US.

13:55.200 --> 14:01.920
They are developing a game, of course, I guess, I don't know, something where you, of course,

14:01.920 --> 14:10.400
defending the United States from terrorists, and they've spent $600,000 of funding Ground

14:10.400 --> 14:11.560
Truth.

14:11.560 --> 14:15.800
It's a game that would, I guess, cast players in the first responders to a terrorist attack

14:15.800 --> 14:17.900
or natural disasters.

14:17.900 --> 14:22.860
Thank you, Homeland Security, for spending our money on a game instead of protecting

14:22.860 --> 14:24.560
the homeland.

14:24.560 --> 14:27.680
Is this a free download thing for PCs, or is this like a Flash game?

14:27.680 --> 14:28.680
What the hell is this?

14:28.680 --> 14:29.680
It's just something that's being developed.

14:29.680 --> 14:32.760
It's not even done yet, so we don't know if it's going to be free or whatnot.

14:32.760 --> 14:33.760
Interesting.

14:33.760 --> 14:35.760
What do they hope to accomplish with a game like this, I wonder?

14:35.760 --> 14:38.920
Wouldn't it be funny if the terrorists played it instead?

14:38.920 --> 14:47.880
It would probably be to build on the success that, say, America's Army had.

14:47.880 --> 14:52.180
I was just thinking of America's Army, and even Jonathan F. in our chat room says, America's

14:52.180 --> 14:54.720
Army was free.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.440
Dark Tetsuya says, Shane went there.

14:56.440 --> 14:58.600
When do I not go there, seriously?

14:58.600 --> 15:03.940
I guess the game is being developed by Sandia National Labs with grad students from University

15:03.940 --> 15:07.240
of Southern California doing the graphics work.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.480
Interesting.

15:08.480 --> 15:13.700
So stop spending government money on this crap, seriously.

15:13.700 --> 15:15.320
You don't need a fucking game.

15:15.320 --> 15:20.320
You don't see the Department of Transportation saying, we want a game, or you know, God knows

15:20.320 --> 15:21.320
what else.

15:21.320 --> 15:25.560
They should have like a Bush PR campaign game or something.

15:25.560 --> 15:27.760
Interesting point from an escapist in our chat room.

15:27.760 --> 15:32.840
That may seem like an expensive game to make, but keep in mind King's Quest cost $700,000

15:32.840 --> 15:34.880
when it first came out all those years ago.

15:34.880 --> 15:35.880
Hmm.

15:35.880 --> 15:36.880
Oh, great.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.540
Isn't all that marketing?

15:38.540 --> 15:43.160
They're going to waste a lot of money building this game, and it's going to suck.

15:43.160 --> 15:44.160
That's awesome.

15:44.160 --> 15:47.960
Wait, you're not trying to say King's Quest sucks, does it, because King's Quest is like

15:47.960 --> 15:48.960
one of the greatest games ever made.

15:48.960 --> 15:50.440
King's Quest is fucking old.

15:50.440 --> 15:52.720
So it's old, but it's great.

15:52.720 --> 15:57.440
Well, back in the day, $700,000 is probably a lot of money.

15:57.440 --> 16:02.280
Nowadays production costs have gone up due to the wonderful systems and graphics that

16:02.280 --> 16:04.280
we have and have come to love.

16:04.280 --> 16:13.400
So back in the day, it was EGA graphics, all fucking 16 colors of wonderful goodness.

16:13.400 --> 16:14.880
All right.

16:14.880 --> 16:18.800
Well, this is a topic that's never fun to talk about, and I hate it when it comes up

16:18.800 --> 16:23.600
on the show, but I think we need to bring this up one more time to bring up the clarification

16:23.600 --> 16:27.200
piece that came out this week, and that would have to do with the really horrible tragedy

16:27.200 --> 16:30.240
that happened at Virginia Tech earlier this year.

16:30.240 --> 16:34.820
Many months later now, the Virginia State report, the official final report has come

16:34.820 --> 16:35.820
out.

16:35.820 --> 16:40.440
The Virginia Tech Massacre Review Panel has released their report, and it does show that

16:40.440 --> 16:45.760
there is no link between video games and the murders that were committed by the culprit.

16:45.760 --> 16:51.240
Actually, the only game that is even mentioned in the report is Sonic the Hedgehog.

16:51.240 --> 16:56.400
Now I would fail to see where Sonic the Hedgehog is going to provoke violent gaming.

16:56.400 --> 17:01.860
Unless he went and played the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 version of the game, which the

17:01.860 --> 17:04.840
controls were horrible and could drive someone to kill people.

17:04.840 --> 17:09.320
Anyway, there was in the report, quote, none of the video games were war games or had violent

17:09.320 --> 17:10.320
themes.

17:10.320 --> 17:14.640
They liked basketball and had a collection of figurines and remote-controlled cars.

17:14.640 --> 17:20.400
So this is a big screw you to all those people that were so quick to blame video games when

17:20.400 --> 17:21.480
this happened.

17:21.480 --> 17:27.120
So the Jack Voldemort's of the world and Dr. Phil's and so on.

17:27.120 --> 17:41.360
So to you folks, we dedicate a very special segment this week to you.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.600
It's our FUs of the Week.

17:42.600 --> 17:46.200
Loki, why don't you start us off with your FUs of the Week.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.680
My FUs of the Week goes to the Lifetime Channel.

17:48.680 --> 17:55.100
I don't like you, and I don't see the point.

17:55.100 --> 17:57.040
That's it?

17:57.040 --> 18:01.360
And to the director of that stupid movie that I had to watch today, learn how to light a

18:01.360 --> 18:02.360
fucking movie.

18:02.360 --> 18:07.280
Otherwise, you're going to be stuck making shit on Lifetime.

18:07.280 --> 18:10.520
First off, I'd like to give an FU to Loki for not enjoying the greatness of his Lifetime

18:10.520 --> 18:12.600
movies, because I love Lifetime movies.

18:12.600 --> 18:17.720
I'd also like to give an FU to getting sick when I was traveling this week.

18:17.720 --> 18:21.080
The only thing worse than having to travel and be gone for four days is getting sick

18:21.080 --> 18:23.560
while you're gone and bringing that back with you.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.600
That really stinks.

18:26.600 --> 18:27.600
And then I guess that's it.

18:27.600 --> 18:28.840
I can't really think of anything else this week.

18:28.840 --> 18:29.840
So that's all my FUs.

18:29.840 --> 18:32.840
Shane, Miklotov, whatever your name is.

18:32.840 --> 18:33.840
Any FUs?

18:33.840 --> 18:34.840
No.

18:34.840 --> 18:35.840
No?

18:35.840 --> 18:36.840
You're happy about everything?

18:36.840 --> 18:39.920
No, but I can't think of anything to give an FU to.

18:39.920 --> 18:40.920
Everything's perfect?

18:40.920 --> 18:41.920
You're not angry at anything?

18:41.920 --> 18:42.920
No.

18:42.920 --> 18:45.520
Well, FU to you being so darn mellow.

18:45.520 --> 18:46.880
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

18:46.880 --> 18:50.360
FU to Blue Dragon, because it sucks.

18:50.360 --> 18:51.360
There we go.

18:51.360 --> 18:52.360
FU to you?

18:52.360 --> 18:53.360
You don't even...

18:53.360 --> 18:54.360
Do you even know why you hate Blue Dragon?

18:54.360 --> 18:55.360
Yes.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.360
The combat is boring.

18:56.360 --> 18:57.360
The combat is awesome.

18:57.360 --> 18:58.360
The game is dull looking.

18:58.360 --> 18:59.360
You're dull looking.

18:59.360 --> 19:05.720
It looks like a generic RPG that could have been made by any company ever.

19:05.720 --> 19:09.880
That I actually, you know, unfortunately there's not a lot that sets this apart from another

19:09.880 --> 19:12.960
RPG except for the fact that it's on the 360 and it's pretty.

19:12.960 --> 19:13.960
But...

19:13.960 --> 19:15.480
The character models even look pretty bland.

19:15.480 --> 19:16.640
The music's good.

19:16.640 --> 19:19.240
No, because those boss fights have terrible, terrible songs.

19:19.240 --> 19:21.720
The boss fight song's awesome.

19:21.720 --> 19:22.720
No.

19:22.720 --> 19:23.720
Worst game.

19:23.720 --> 19:26.600
The boss fight song is a vocal rock song, which is pretty rad.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.360
Don't listen to what Shane says.

19:28.360 --> 19:29.360
No.

19:29.360 --> 19:30.360
Listen to what I say.

19:30.360 --> 19:31.360
No, don't.

19:31.360 --> 19:32.360
All right.

19:32.360 --> 19:33.360
Back to the news.

19:33.360 --> 19:40.240
Anyways, Castlevania, the wonderful game that's gonna become a movie, yay, is now being completely

19:40.240 --> 19:41.240
rewritten.

19:41.240 --> 19:45.680
Yes, they've thrown out the script and are going back to the drawing boards.

19:45.680 --> 19:51.800
Apparently, Paul W.S. Anderson, who was going to direct the movie, is not now, obviously,

19:51.800 --> 19:57.160
and now they have a new person working on the script.

19:57.160 --> 20:02.800
It's Ian Jeffers, who's done a screenplay for the wonderful Kevin Bacon action flick

20:02.800 --> 20:06.440
that just got released here in the United States, Death Sentence.

20:06.440 --> 20:11.920
Yes, you may not have seen it yet, but I'm sure that you will at some point because that's

20:11.920 --> 20:16.000
super awesome and I know you wouldn't miss it.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.160
So he's working on the script now.

20:18.160 --> 20:23.600
His take on it, I guess, and of course the new director is Sylvain White, says, I was

20:23.600 --> 20:30.500
attracted by the chance to make a dark, epic period movie that almost has an anime feel

20:30.500 --> 20:32.720
to it.

20:32.720 --> 20:43.920
So let's hope and pray that it doesn't suck, and unfortunately past track records of movie

20:43.920 --> 20:45.160
games have not been...

20:45.160 --> 20:49.160
My Magic A-Ball says, signs do not look good.

20:49.160 --> 20:54.160
Loki, coming from the chat room here, did you like the band Deep Purple?

20:54.160 --> 20:57.640
Do you remember the band at all, Deep Purple?

20:57.640 --> 20:59.520
The one that did Smoke on the Water?

20:59.520 --> 21:02.960
Yeah, no, actually I got to ask Shane this, do you know the band Deep Purple?

21:02.960 --> 21:05.600
Yes, because Smoke on the Water.

21:05.600 --> 21:09.360
The lead singer of Deep Purple is the guy that sings the song in Blue Dragon.

21:09.360 --> 21:12.720
No wonder it sounds bad.

21:12.720 --> 21:17.160
That little tidbit coming from Escapist, so there you go.

21:17.160 --> 21:18.640
Let's talk about other movies.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.200
Now of course there's been lots of movies this year.

21:20.200 --> 21:24.280
You have King of Kong, which I still want to see, but I think the closest it's playing

21:24.280 --> 21:25.280
here is San Francisco.

21:25.280 --> 21:29.080
I'm not driving all the way out there just to see a movie, and Chasing Ghosts are some

21:29.080 --> 21:32.280
big movies that are coming out this year, but there's another one that's coming out.

21:32.280 --> 21:35.180
It's called Press Start.

21:35.180 --> 21:37.680
It's not a documentary, however.

21:37.680 --> 21:41.280
This is a quote from the little synopsis of the movie.

21:41.280 --> 21:45.960
Zach Nimbus is a typical suburban youth and volunteer monster exterminator living peacefully

21:45.960 --> 21:47.520
in a video game world.

21:47.520 --> 21:51.320
It's a realm where people actually do cross rivers by jumping across alligators' heads

21:51.320 --> 21:54.680
or being chomped to death in the attempt, and where injuries can be cured by eating

21:54.680 --> 21:57.080
food laying around in old hallways.

21:57.080 --> 22:01.500
Here the pleasant days are ending due to world conquest by the unspeakably evil but insecure

22:01.500 --> 22:05.320
and telephone addicted wizard, Count Nefarious Vile.

22:05.320 --> 22:11.180
Zach soon finds himself recruited by battle-hardened space soldier Sam, an enthusiastically bad

22:11.180 --> 22:22.920
tempered ninja Lin Koo to join a last desperate attempt to thwart Vile's imminent victory,

22:22.920 --> 22:26.840
but not before lampooning every video game convention that comes in their way.

22:26.840 --> 22:31.220
So apparently this is going to be some type of little live action movie that parodies

22:31.220 --> 22:32.760
all these other video games.

22:32.760 --> 22:33.760
Here's the thing, though.

22:33.760 --> 22:36.960
If you think this is some huge production that's putting this out, this movie looks

22:36.960 --> 22:39.280
like it cost about $20 to make.

22:39.280 --> 22:41.320
So don't be expecting a big budget production.

22:41.320 --> 23:01.600
But hey, just because it has no budget doesn't mean it can't be good.

23:01.600 --> 23:05.060
There is a trailer available, by the way, which you can watch on YouTube if you just

23:05.060 --> 23:09.200
look for Press Start, the movie, there's actually a trailer, or actually looking at it in the

23:09.200 --> 23:11.680
studio right now if you want to kind of check this out here.

23:11.680 --> 23:19.800
Would you mind telling me what you were doing with these, hmm?

23:19.800 --> 23:25.600
Don't forget what I did to your brother.

23:25.600 --> 23:39.640
In a world ruled by an evil sorcerer, two rebels seek a hero foretold by an ancient

23:39.640 --> 23:40.640
prophecy.

23:40.640 --> 23:43.360
Who is ancient prophecy?

23:43.360 --> 23:47.920
An ancient prophet.

23:47.920 --> 23:50.960
This looks like that cheerleader ninjas movie.

23:50.960 --> 23:52.520
I love LARPing.

23:52.520 --> 23:54.520
Let's make it into a movie.

23:54.520 --> 23:58.320
Why'd you let him hit you?

23:58.320 --> 23:59.320
It was his turn.

23:59.320 --> 24:00.320
On September 25th.

24:00.320 --> 24:01.320
Batten down the hatches.

24:01.320 --> 24:02.320
Rile up the mechanical dinosaurs.

24:02.320 --> 24:03.320
It won't be a game.

24:03.320 --> 24:04.320
Congratulations.

24:04.320 --> 24:05.320
You've just leveled up.

24:05.320 --> 24:06.320
Because it's a movie.

24:06.320 --> 24:14.600
Did you see the graphics on that tree thing there?

24:14.600 --> 24:16.600
That was crazy.

24:16.600 --> 24:21.640
Those fools have no idea what horrors await them.

24:21.640 --> 24:24.080
Thank you for warning us that the movie will suck.

24:24.080 --> 24:25.080
Awesome.

24:25.080 --> 24:27.880
Oh, it's going straight to DVD.

24:27.880 --> 24:30.680
Never would have guessed that.

24:30.680 --> 24:31.680
You never know.

24:31.680 --> 24:32.680
It might be decent.

24:32.680 --> 24:33.680
No, it might.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.560
We'll try and get some of the guys from the movie on the show or something.

24:35.560 --> 24:36.560
Where would you buy that DVD?

24:36.560 --> 24:37.560
Like at a garage sale or something?

24:37.560 --> 24:38.560
I guess from the website.

24:38.560 --> 24:39.560
There's a little website.

24:39.560 --> 24:40.940
It's straight on the website.

24:40.940 --> 24:46.160
They're relying on a buzzword called, you know, it's like a viral marketing.

24:46.160 --> 24:47.560
In other words, people...

24:47.560 --> 24:48.560
Well, it's working.

24:48.560 --> 24:51.680
We talked about it on our program and it was on a lot of major game blogs.

24:51.680 --> 24:56.000
There was that funny part in the thing, though, about that it was his turn to attack.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
I like that.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
So it was like an RPG.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
That was funny.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.520
Come on, if you can sit through that Cheerleader Ninjas, I'm sure you can make it through this

25:02.520 --> 25:03.520
movie, Loki.

25:03.520 --> 25:04.520
There might be something about it.

25:04.520 --> 25:05.520
Cheerleader Ninjas had nudity in it.

25:05.520 --> 25:06.520
This might.

25:06.520 --> 25:07.520
You never know.

25:07.520 --> 25:08.520
That's a point.

25:08.520 --> 25:09.520
Yeah, that's true.

25:09.520 --> 25:10.520
There could be nudity in this movie.

25:10.520 --> 25:11.520
Direct to DVD.

25:11.520 --> 25:12.520
For artistic purposes.

25:12.520 --> 25:16.040
No, they don't have the budget for nudity.

25:16.040 --> 25:17.560
Would you really want to see any of them naked?

25:17.560 --> 25:18.560
I don't know.

25:18.560 --> 25:19.560
I don't think so.

25:19.560 --> 25:23.360
What we're going to do is we're going to open up the Skype line because it's time to play

25:23.360 --> 25:26.360
Beat the Host.

25:26.360 --> 25:33.160
I love that song.

25:33.160 --> 25:34.160
Let's just listen to that.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.160
Okay.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.160
Great.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.160
All right.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.160
Tonight we're going to play Beat the Host.

25:38.160 --> 25:41.240
We're going to take our first caller on the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio, our username

25:41.240 --> 25:46.040
on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR to play Beat the Host.

25:46.040 --> 25:49.600
I've got to warn you, if you want to play tonight, you need to have some type of working

25:49.600 --> 25:53.680
knowledge about music and video games or else your chances are going to be a little bit

25:53.680 --> 25:57.840
screwed in tonight's game.

25:57.840 --> 25:58.840
Here we go.

25:58.840 --> 26:01.160
We're going to take our first call on the Skype line.

26:01.160 --> 26:05.300
Again, our username is Orange Lounge Radio or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

26:05.300 --> 26:06.300
Here we go.

26:06.300 --> 26:07.300
We've got to call.

26:07.300 --> 26:08.300
Hello.

26:08.300 --> 26:09.300
Who's this?

26:09.300 --> 26:10.300
It always gets through.

26:10.300 --> 26:11.300
GS68.

26:11.300 --> 26:12.300
Hi, GS68.

26:12.300 --> 26:13.300
No, it's not Ravens Dolphin tonight.

26:13.300 --> 26:14.300
It's GS68.

26:14.300 --> 26:15.300
Hey, GS68.

26:15.300 --> 26:16.300
All right.

26:16.300 --> 26:19.120
Are you ready to play some Beat the Host tonight?

26:19.120 --> 26:20.120
Yeah.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.120
I'll give it a shot.

26:21.120 --> 26:22.120
All right.

26:22.120 --> 26:26.760
Now, how would you say your knowledge of old school or new school video game music is?

26:26.760 --> 26:27.760
Eh.

26:27.760 --> 26:28.760
All right.

26:28.760 --> 26:32.800
Well, you sound very enthusiastic about your chances in tonight's Beat the Host.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.360
All right.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.280
Tonight you can challenge to Beat the Host.

26:36.280 --> 26:39.640
I'm not going to let you play against Shane because he already kind of knows what's going

26:39.640 --> 26:40.640
on tonight.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.920
I know, but I never get to play.

26:42.920 --> 26:44.920
He's just going to pick Matt.

26:44.920 --> 26:45.920
Probably picks Matt anyway.

26:45.920 --> 26:46.920
All right.

26:46.920 --> 26:47.920
It's not even like they have to ask.

26:47.920 --> 26:51.000
If I let you pick, you'd probably pick Matt, wouldn't you?

26:51.000 --> 26:54.400
What would be wrong with challenging you?

26:54.400 --> 26:57.040
Oh, you can't challenge me because I wrote the questions.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.040
Oh, I see.

26:58.040 --> 26:59.040
Oh, I see.

26:59.040 --> 27:00.040
All right.

27:00.040 --> 27:01.040
So, by process of elimination.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.040
All right.

27:02.040 --> 27:03.040
I'll go with Loki.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.040
All right.

27:04.040 --> 27:08.080
Then, Loki's going to beat the host tonight in Beat the Host, and tonight's challenge

27:08.080 --> 27:09.080
is...

27:09.080 --> 27:11.400
It should be called Beat the Host Named Loki.

27:11.400 --> 27:16.480
Tonight's challenge is Put My Thing Down, Flip It, and Reverse It, is the name of tonight's

27:16.480 --> 27:18.160
challenge.

27:18.160 --> 27:24.360
Tonight's challenge is about who can identify the most video game music songs being played

27:24.360 --> 27:25.360
backwards.

27:25.360 --> 27:26.360
Okay?

27:26.360 --> 27:27.360
Oh, God.

27:27.360 --> 27:32.760
Now, these could be songs anywhere from an 8-bit Atari era all the way through new school

27:32.760 --> 27:35.640
Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 games.

27:35.640 --> 27:36.640
Okay?

27:36.640 --> 27:40.280
If things drag on, I will give you guys hints to help you guess the game.

27:40.280 --> 27:41.480
Which one to get it gets the point.

27:41.480 --> 27:42.480
All right?

27:42.480 --> 27:43.480
So, you guys know how to play?

27:43.480 --> 27:44.480
I'm ready.

27:44.480 --> 27:45.480
All right.

27:45.480 --> 27:46.480
So, you guys are going to go at the same time.

27:46.480 --> 27:49.560
GS68, make sure you yell out your answers nice and loud so I can hear you over the music.

27:49.560 --> 27:50.560
Okay?

27:50.560 --> 27:51.560
And I have to leave the chat room, right?

27:51.560 --> 27:52.560
Yes.

27:52.560 --> 27:55.400
You do need to leave the chat room or else people are going to help you cheat, and we

27:55.400 --> 27:56.400
can't have that.

27:56.400 --> 27:57.400
All right.

27:57.400 --> 27:58.400
Okay?

27:58.400 --> 27:59.400
All right.

27:59.400 --> 28:00.400
All right.

28:00.400 --> 28:02.400
Is he out of chat?

28:02.400 --> 28:03.400
Okay.

28:03.400 --> 28:04.400
You left the chat room, GS68?

28:04.400 --> 28:05.400
Yeah.

28:05.400 --> 28:06.400
Okay.

28:06.400 --> 28:07.400
Now, remember, you don't have to send me a private message or anything.

28:07.400 --> 28:10.400
Just yell it out when you know it, because you're up against Matt in real time, okay?

28:10.400 --> 28:11.400
Okay.

28:11.400 --> 28:13.720
So, I'm going to keep score here, and...

28:13.720 --> 28:15.120
There should be buzzers.

28:15.120 --> 28:16.520
There should be, but we don't have any.

28:16.520 --> 28:17.520
Let's go D.

28:17.520 --> 28:18.520
Buzz.

28:18.520 --> 28:19.520
We're a low-budget production.

28:19.520 --> 28:20.520
Okay.

28:20.520 --> 28:21.520
Here we go.

28:21.520 --> 28:22.720
Here's song number one, and the first one to get it gets a point.

28:22.720 --> 28:25.400
And remember, these are being played backwards.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.400
Okay.

28:27.400 --> 28:38.440
What's that, GS68?

28:38.440 --> 28:41.760
I've heard this on the OLAR stream, but I can't put my finger on it.

28:41.760 --> 28:46.140
Keep going.

28:46.140 --> 28:48.280
This game was on the Dreamcast.

28:48.280 --> 28:52.320
Seriously, you guys?

28:52.320 --> 28:53.320
Space Shell 5.

28:53.320 --> 28:54.320
Thank you.

28:54.320 --> 28:55.320
Yes.

28:55.320 --> 28:56.320
Loki got a point, finally.

28:56.320 --> 28:57.320
Sorry.

28:57.320 --> 28:58.320
How did you get to that?

28:58.320 --> 28:59.320
I was...

28:59.320 --> 29:00.320
Because it sounded to me...

29:00.320 --> 29:07.160
It almost sounded like Tank from Cowboy Bebop, but I just started thinking about stuff that

29:07.160 --> 29:08.160
have the same kind of pro music.

29:08.160 --> 29:09.160
All right.

29:09.160 --> 29:11.880
Well, again, remember, these songs are being played backwards.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.160
To me, it sounded like a song from Loop on the Third.

29:14.160 --> 29:15.160
Exactly.

29:15.160 --> 29:16.160
See, it's kind of along the same lines.

29:16.160 --> 29:17.160
All right.

29:17.160 --> 29:18.160
All right.

29:18.160 --> 29:21.080
Well, Loki has a point, but GS68, there's 10 songs tonight, so all is not lost.

29:21.080 --> 29:22.080
You ready for song number two?

29:22.080 --> 29:23.080
Yep.

29:23.080 --> 29:24.080
All right.

29:24.080 --> 29:25.080
Here we go.

29:25.080 --> 29:29.040
Here we go.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.040
Animal Crossing.

29:30.040 --> 29:31.040
Ooh!

29:31.040 --> 29:32.040
Loki's on fire!

29:32.040 --> 29:36.040
GS68, did you even hear any of that?

29:36.040 --> 29:37.040
Yeah.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.040
Couldn't recognize it.

29:38.040 --> 29:40.760
It was Animal Crossing, the little drum, tap, little quiet stuff.

29:40.760 --> 29:41.760
Yes, it was Animal Crossing.

29:41.760 --> 29:42.760
Good job, Loki.

29:42.760 --> 29:43.760
You played the game way too much.

29:43.760 --> 29:44.760
All right.

29:44.760 --> 29:45.760
Here we go.

29:45.760 --> 29:46.760
Here's another one.

29:46.760 --> 29:48.320
Remember, these could be from any system, new school or old school.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.320
Here we go.

29:49.320 --> 29:50.320
Here's number three.

29:50.320 --> 29:51.320
Luminous.

29:51.320 --> 29:59.720
Oh, GS68 knew that one too.

29:59.720 --> 30:00.720
That's right.

30:00.720 --> 30:01.720
That was Shining from Luminous.

30:01.720 --> 30:02.720
Damn, Loki, on fire.

30:02.720 --> 30:04.440
That sounded so evil backwards.

30:04.440 --> 30:05.440
It did sound like it.

30:05.440 --> 30:06.440
You want to hear a little more?

30:06.440 --> 30:07.440
Yeah, a little bit more.

30:07.440 --> 30:08.440
Want to hear a little more?

30:08.440 --> 30:09.440
Oh, now it's a little healthier.

30:09.440 --> 30:10.440
I like it backwards.

30:10.440 --> 30:17.200
I want an MP3 of it backwards now.

30:17.200 --> 30:19.360
I can send you an MP3 of it backwards if you want.

30:19.360 --> 30:20.360
That'd be cool.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.360
All right.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.360
GS68, it's three-nothing.

30:22.360 --> 30:23.360
All right.

30:23.360 --> 30:26.360
You got to make some progress here, okay?

30:26.360 --> 30:27.360
All right.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.840
We're pulling for you, though.

30:28.840 --> 30:30.080
Here we go.

30:30.080 --> 30:31.080
Here's number four.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.080
Ready?

30:32.080 --> 30:33.080
Yeah.

30:33.080 --> 30:47.080
This

30:47.080 --> 30:48.080
game was on the NES.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.080
Master Master?

30:49.080 --> 30:51.600
No.

30:51.600 --> 30:52.600
Super Contra?

30:52.600 --> 30:53.600
No.

30:53.600 --> 30:54.600
Contra?

30:54.600 --> 30:55.600
No.

30:55.600 --> 30:56.600
Ready to legend?

30:56.600 --> 30:57.600
What'd you say?

30:57.600 --> 30:58.600
Ready to legend?

30:58.600 --> 31:04.500
No, it's not ready to legend.

31:04.500 --> 31:08.000
This game had a character named Ryu.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Ninja Gaiden.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
Oh, Loki got it.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.120
Needed a couple clues to get it, but it was Ninja Gaiden.

31:15.120 --> 31:16.120
Stage one music.

31:16.120 --> 31:19.160
GS68, it's not looking good.

31:19.160 --> 31:22.480
I'm sorry to say, but try to get some points on the board, okay?

31:22.480 --> 31:24.120
We're all pulling for you, all right?

31:24.120 --> 31:25.120
Yeah.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.120
All right.

31:26.120 --> 31:29.240
I'll bust Loki's kneecaps so he has a challenge in some of these later ones.

31:29.240 --> 31:30.240
Okay, you ready?

31:30.240 --> 31:31.240
Okay, here we go.

31:31.240 --> 31:32.240
Here comes song number five.

31:32.240 --> 31:33.240
You ready, GS68?

31:33.240 --> 31:34.240
Yeah.

31:34.240 --> 31:35.240
You can do it.

31:35.240 --> 31:36.240
Act Freezer.

31:36.240 --> 31:37.240
Sonic!

31:37.240 --> 31:38.240
No.

31:38.240 --> 31:39.240
Yes.

31:39.240 --> 31:40.240
GS68 got one.

31:40.240 --> 31:41.240
Wow.

31:41.240 --> 31:42.240
I think the room...

31:42.240 --> 31:43.240
What was that?

31:43.240 --> 31:46.520
GS68 got one.

31:46.520 --> 31:48.280
I think the roof came off his house.

31:48.280 --> 31:49.280
It was Sonic.

31:49.280 --> 31:50.280
Oh.

31:50.280 --> 31:51.280
Oh, that's right.

31:51.280 --> 31:52.280
Yeah.

31:52.280 --> 31:54.360
I thought he yelled a bad word.

31:54.360 --> 31:56.360
That is what you said, right, GS68?

31:56.360 --> 31:57.360
Yeah.

31:57.360 --> 32:00.280
That's what I heard, but he did it in that old...

32:00.280 --> 32:04.920
I think it was an allusion to the old Sega commercials when he yelled it out.

32:04.920 --> 32:05.920
He yelled, Sonic!

32:05.920 --> 32:07.920
Or he just really wanted to win.

32:07.920 --> 32:10.320
That was the bonus stage in Sonic.

32:10.320 --> 32:11.320
The bonus stage music.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.320
Yeah.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.320
All right.

32:13.320 --> 32:14.320
All right.

32:14.320 --> 32:15.320
Good.

32:15.320 --> 32:16.320
I'm so glad to see you get on the board, GS68.

32:16.320 --> 32:17.320
All right.

32:17.320 --> 32:18.320
Here we go into the next question.

32:18.320 --> 32:20.520
Question number six, I believe this one is.

32:20.520 --> 32:24.520
Here we go.

32:24.520 --> 32:26.520
Parappa the Rapper.

32:26.520 --> 32:28.240
Ooh.

32:28.240 --> 32:30.360
Mere seconds splitting it up.

32:30.360 --> 32:33.320
I could hear GS68 start to say it as Loki got it out.

32:33.320 --> 32:34.920
It was Parappa the Rapper.

32:34.920 --> 32:35.920
All right.

32:35.920 --> 32:38.280
This next one's a little bit tougher, GS68.

32:38.280 --> 32:39.280
You ready?

32:39.280 --> 32:41.880
Ready for the next one, GS68?

32:41.880 --> 32:42.880
Yes.

32:42.880 --> 32:43.880
Okay.

32:43.880 --> 32:47.880
Here we go.

32:47.880 --> 33:08.760
This is on the 360.

33:08.760 --> 33:12.480
And the PC.

33:12.480 --> 33:15.480
Not that one yet.

33:15.480 --> 33:19.720
I guess.

33:19.720 --> 33:22.520
No.

33:22.520 --> 33:23.880
This is a role playing game.

33:23.880 --> 33:27.240
I don't think that's the 11th.

33:27.240 --> 33:28.240
No.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.240
Oblivion.

33:29.240 --> 33:30.240
Yes.

33:30.240 --> 33:31.240
Finally.

33:31.240 --> 33:32.240
Jesus.

33:32.240 --> 33:33.240
Sorry.

33:33.240 --> 33:34.240
It took long enough.

33:34.240 --> 33:35.240
Yes.

33:35.240 --> 33:36.240
It was Oblivion.

33:36.240 --> 33:37.240
All right.

33:37.240 --> 33:41.680
Looks like Loki has six, so there's no possible way you're going to be able to win GS68, but

33:41.680 --> 33:43.160
keep playing just for the fun of it, okay?

33:43.160 --> 33:44.160
All right.

33:44.160 --> 33:45.160
All right.

33:45.160 --> 33:46.160
We're going to get through the rest of this.

33:46.160 --> 33:47.160
Here we go.

33:47.160 --> 33:48.160
Here comes the next one.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.160
Contra.

33:49.160 --> 33:50.160
No.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.160
No, it's Castlevania.

33:51.160 --> 33:52.160
Castlevania IV.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.160
No.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.160
Symphony and Night.

33:54.160 --> 33:55.160
No.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.160
Castlevania III.

33:56.160 --> 33:57.160
No.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.160
Dracula X.

33:58.160 --> 33:59.160
GS68.

33:59.160 --> 34:07.360
I think he just gave up.

34:07.360 --> 34:09.200
Castlevania II Science Quest.

34:09.200 --> 34:10.200
Finally.

34:10.200 --> 34:11.200
Jesus Christ.

34:11.200 --> 34:12.200
Yes.

34:12.200 --> 34:13.200
I didn't go through all of them.

34:13.200 --> 34:14.200
GS68.

34:14.200 --> 34:17.160
You should have jumped in there when his weak point was exposed.

34:17.160 --> 34:19.920
For massive damage, you could have jumped in there with number two.

34:19.920 --> 34:21.920
You're going to know it.

34:21.920 --> 34:22.920
All right.

34:22.920 --> 34:24.280
Here we go.

34:24.280 --> 34:25.280
Here comes number nine.

34:25.280 --> 34:28.740
Now, I'm going to say I think this was the hardest one in the whole bunch.

34:28.740 --> 34:37.400
If either one of you can get this, props to you.

34:37.400 --> 34:43.640
All right.

34:43.640 --> 34:52.440
This game was also on the 360 and PC.

34:52.440 --> 34:53.440
Fantasy Star Universe?

34:53.440 --> 34:54.440
No.

34:54.440 --> 34:57.440
What was that?

34:57.440 --> 35:02.400
Final Fantasy XI?

35:02.400 --> 35:06.520
No.

35:06.520 --> 35:10.560
This game was the same composer who did the music to Oblivion.

35:10.560 --> 35:12.560
Blair?

35:12.560 --> 35:14.760
No.

35:14.760 --> 35:21.600
The story of this game has to do with alien abduction.

35:21.600 --> 35:22.600
Alien?

35:22.600 --> 35:24.760
Can I guess?

35:24.760 --> 35:25.760
What was that, GS68?

35:25.760 --> 35:29.120
I was going to say Alien Syndrome, but I forgot that's not on the PC.

35:29.120 --> 35:30.120
Oh, God.

35:30.120 --> 35:33.080
I know the game, but I just can't think of the name.

35:33.080 --> 35:37.200
This game is notable for featuring a Native American lead character.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.200
Prey.

35:38.200 --> 35:39.200
Yes.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.200
GS68.

35:40.200 --> 35:41.200
I was like, finally.

35:41.200 --> 35:42.200
It was on the tip of my tongue.

35:42.200 --> 35:43.200
Yes.

35:43.200 --> 35:44.200
It's Prey.

35:44.200 --> 35:45.200
All right.

35:45.200 --> 35:46.200
Good job.

35:46.200 --> 35:47.200
Good job, GS68.

35:47.200 --> 35:48.200
I knew the game.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.200
I just couldn't think of the name.

35:49.200 --> 35:50.200
All right.

35:50.200 --> 35:51.760
Let's move on.

35:51.760 --> 35:53.320
Ready for the last one, you guys?

35:53.320 --> 35:54.320
Yes.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.320
Here it is.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.320
That was Butterfly.

35:56.320 --> 35:57.320
Yes, Loki.

35:57.320 --> 35:58.320
All right.

35:58.320 --> 35:59.320
That's an accident.

35:59.320 --> 36:00.320
Wow.

36:00.320 --> 36:01.320
GS68, you got smoked tonight, I'm sorry to say.

36:01.320 --> 36:02.320
GG.

36:02.320 --> 36:03.320
A score is 8 to 2.

36:03.320 --> 36:04.320
Did you just say GG?

36:04.320 --> 36:05.320
Yes.

36:05.320 --> 36:06.320
Yes.

36:06.320 --> 36:07.320
GG, Loki.

36:07.320 --> 36:08.320
GG.

36:08.320 --> 36:09.320
GG.

36:09.320 --> 36:15.320
Well, I'm sorry, GS68, you lost tonight, but it's our consolation prize.

36:15.320 --> 36:28.320
We'll give you a second to plug anything you want to plug real quick.

36:28.320 --> 36:31.800
I don't have anything to plug.

36:31.800 --> 36:33.320
I'm sorry to hear it.

36:33.320 --> 36:34.320
All right.

36:34.320 --> 36:35.840
Well, thanks for playing anyway, GS68.

36:35.840 --> 36:36.840
We appreciate it.

36:36.840 --> 36:37.840
No problem.

36:37.840 --> 36:38.840
All right.

36:38.840 --> 36:39.840
Later, dude.

36:39.840 --> 36:41.880
Good job, Loki.

36:41.880 --> 36:45.160
You know, isn't that game unfair to the listener?

36:45.160 --> 36:46.160
Why is that?

36:46.160 --> 36:47.720
Because there's a time delay?

36:47.720 --> 36:51.960
No, because when they're on Skype, it's still instantaneous.

36:51.960 --> 36:52.960
Oh.

36:52.960 --> 36:53.960
Yeah.

36:53.960 --> 36:56.360
There's only the time delay if they're listening over Live 365, but they shouldn't be doing

36:56.360 --> 36:58.360
that when they're playing that.

36:58.360 --> 36:59.360
All right.

36:59.360 --> 37:04.600
Looking at a chat and seeing what's going on, Zappy says, that was a hard beat the host

37:04.600 --> 37:05.600
tonight.

37:05.600 --> 37:06.800
Go Banjo thinks the last one was easy.

37:06.800 --> 37:10.400
Well, if you're a DDR nerd, then the last one was easy, so there you go.

37:10.400 --> 37:11.400
All right.

37:11.400 --> 37:12.560
Let's get back into some gaming news.

37:12.560 --> 37:13.560
That's it for beat the host tonight.

37:13.560 --> 37:17.520
If you guys like those games or other games like it, send us an email, mailbag at orangehousereader.com.

37:17.520 --> 37:22.960
We're looking for ideas for new games, by the way, so just wanted to put that out there.

37:22.960 --> 37:24.640
All right.

37:24.640 --> 37:26.080
Let's get back into the gaming news.

37:26.080 --> 37:28.680
Loki, take it away.

37:28.680 --> 37:29.680
Sorry.

37:29.680 --> 37:33.200
Anyways, so yeah, there's some interesting stuff.

37:33.200 --> 37:34.720
This is really interesting.

37:34.720 --> 37:38.300
Nokia has unveiled the N-Gage gaming platform.

37:38.300 --> 37:42.880
Now remember that they are not making any more gaming systems, but their new Nokia phones,

37:42.880 --> 37:49.200
of course, are going to be supporting the brand new gaming platform, which looks okay.

37:49.200 --> 37:55.280
They've got a few people on board already, including Electronic Arts, Capcom, and Viviti,

37:55.280 --> 37:58.760
and they've got some other exclusive games as well.

37:58.760 --> 38:08.440
It will be compatible with the Nokia models N73, N81, N93, and N95, and with more S60

38:08.440 --> 38:13.160
models to be compatible at a later date.

38:13.160 --> 38:17.840
The games right now, they're going to be free to demo, but will cost between 6 and 10 euros

38:17.840 --> 38:24.480
to buy the full version and feature online play against friends or, of course, random

38:24.480 --> 38:31.440
people via the N-Gage arena, which it kept trying to get me to walk into during E3.

38:31.440 --> 38:36.680
The N-Gage arena at the last E3 that was a real E3 was pretty swanky.

38:36.680 --> 38:39.440
Yeah, they actually had a really nice booth at the last E3.

38:39.440 --> 38:45.760
Too bad it was a piece of crap product, but it was still a nice booth.

38:45.760 --> 38:46.760
What do you think of this news?

38:46.760 --> 38:48.000
I mean, I don't think this is so bad.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.640
I think it's kind of neat.

38:49.640 --> 38:59.160
I think it's much better than the N-Gage's actual system was, so there you go.

38:59.160 --> 39:03.360
Let's move on to the next story, which is about a new PC demo, other things you can

39:03.360 --> 39:04.680
do with your PC.

39:04.680 --> 39:11.720
Crysis is getting a PC demo on September 25, 2007, but the one thing about that day you

39:11.720 --> 39:16.800
should also keep in mind, that's the same day the Halo 3 comes out, so something to

39:16.800 --> 39:17.800
keep in mind.

39:17.800 --> 39:19.440
Well, a lot of people are anticipating this game.

39:19.440 --> 39:23.960
It's a big first-person shooter for the PC, so if you want to take that PC versus console

39:23.960 --> 39:26.560
gaming to a whole new level, there you have it.

39:26.560 --> 39:31.840
Thank you to the folks behind Crysis for doing this, so funny.

39:31.840 --> 39:40.400
Also, there is a new game, or I should say an older game, that is free now.

39:40.400 --> 39:46.760
Command & Conquer, the Gold Edition, is free to download, and you can download it actually

39:46.760 --> 39:52.020
off of, I believe, the official Command & Conquer website.

39:52.020 --> 39:59.400
That's pretty awesome, and I guess they're also featuring Command & Conquer Strategy

39:59.400 --> 40:03.000
for the month of September.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
What do you mean by strategy?

40:04.000 --> 40:06.040
Like free strategy guys or something?

40:06.040 --> 40:07.040
Yeah.

40:07.040 --> 40:08.040
Huh.

40:08.040 --> 40:15.480
I guess it's an ISO image, so you'd have to burn it to a CD, but that's pretty awesome

40:15.480 --> 40:16.480
though.

40:16.480 --> 40:17.480
Command & Conquer is a cool game.

40:17.480 --> 40:18.480
That's pretty cool.

40:18.480 --> 40:24.200
Anyhow, another PC game that is free and has been free for quite a while, MapleStory, is

40:24.200 --> 40:25.200
getting an update.

40:25.200 --> 40:28.320
I know some of you guys out there like to play this game, MapleStory.

40:28.320 --> 40:32.400
It's a free MMO that's available out there, and there's some brand new stuff being added

40:32.400 --> 40:33.400
to the game.

40:33.400 --> 40:43.000
The Mountain Village of Mulung is being added, as well as a new town called Herb Town.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
Like the herbs?

40:44.000 --> 40:46.960
Yeah, like, you know, let's go smoke a joint, man.

40:46.960 --> 40:51.840
Or maybe not, but those are being added to MapleStory this week, so check that out.

40:51.840 --> 40:57.560
I should also say that Mulung features a salon where players can buy new hairstyles.

40:57.560 --> 40:59.400
That's a feature coming to WoW pretty soon, right?

40:59.400 --> 41:01.040
Yes, I can't wait.

41:01.040 --> 41:02.040
You love to customize hairstyles.

41:02.040 --> 41:04.120
You know, you've been looking for a new MMO to play.

41:04.120 --> 41:05.900
Why haven't you been playing MapleStory?

41:05.900 --> 41:07.760
Because I've tried it before, and I thought it was a piece of crap.

41:07.760 --> 41:09.280
Why did you think it was a piece of crap?

41:09.280 --> 41:10.280
It was boring.

41:10.280 --> 41:13.760
I didn't understand what I was doing, and my character was ugly.

41:13.760 --> 41:17.720
I don't play ugly characters.

41:17.720 --> 41:22.520
Herb Town, by the way, includes new monsters to fight, but no word yet if you can actually

41:22.520 --> 41:24.800
score some herbs in Herb Town.

41:24.800 --> 41:33.640
Well, following Lost Planet, and I guess Ghost Recon releasing some map packs for free, Gears

41:33.640 --> 41:39.880
of War, the map pack that's been available so far, the Hidden Fronts map pack is going

41:39.880 --> 41:44.160
to be available for free as well, starting in September.

41:44.160 --> 41:49.720
Actually, tomorrow at 2am is going to be when it's going to be available, September 3rd.

41:49.720 --> 41:54.920
You can get four maps that are included with that, including Bullet Marsh, Garden, Process,

41:54.920 --> 41:56.240
and Subway.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.480
So that's not bad.

41:57.480 --> 41:59.320
Free is always good.

41:59.320 --> 42:03.160
Hooray for free, AIDS.

42:03.160 --> 42:06.480
I notice there's a lot of people online that aren't playing Gears of War anymore.

42:06.480 --> 42:07.480
I wonder why that is.

42:07.480 --> 42:11.040
I guess it's just because there's all these other Xbox 360 games capturing people's attention

42:11.040 --> 42:15.320
now, but it seems like Gears of War was the big thing not that long ago, and now I barely

42:15.320 --> 42:18.080
see people on my friends list playing that game anymore.

42:18.080 --> 42:21.760
Maybe these free maps will breathe some life back into it, what do you think?

42:21.760 --> 42:26.120
I doubt it, because they've been available for a while now, so I figured if people wanted

42:26.120 --> 42:28.680
them they would have already bought them.

42:28.680 --> 42:34.320
Well, now there's been a lot of stories going around about how the 60GB PlayStation 3 is

42:34.320 --> 42:39.080
officially no more, that they completely sold out, but Sony would like you to know that

42:39.080 --> 42:46.080
they have replenished their PlayStation 3 supply of 60GB PlayStation 3s on sonystyle.com.

42:46.080 --> 42:51.560
That's because they were on backorder at one point, they are now back in stock, so there's

42:51.560 --> 42:55.320
no official word if the 60GB are officially gone or not.

42:55.320 --> 43:01.520
That actually makes sense to me, because sonystylestore, whatever it's called, is not Sony, Inc.

43:01.520 --> 43:02.520
You know what I mean?

43:02.520 --> 43:07.640
It's just another store, like any other GameStop or whatever, it just happens to be run by

43:07.640 --> 43:08.640
Sony.

43:08.640 --> 43:12.720
So of course they're going to run out, it doesn't mean the whole supply is gone.

43:12.720 --> 43:16.160
This isn't really a whole lot of big news to me, but just to kind of stop the doom and

43:16.160 --> 43:20.360
gloom that was going around about, oh the 60GBs are gone, they're gone forever, and

43:20.360 --> 43:21.360
so on.

43:21.360 --> 43:24.040
One of these days I'll buy a PlayStation 3.

43:24.040 --> 43:25.040
One of these days.

43:25.040 --> 43:31.720
It's alright, one of these days there'll be games for it, and I own a PS3 and I'm kind

43:31.720 --> 43:32.720
of disappointed.

43:32.720 --> 43:37.040
Luckily though, in October though, I'm looking forward to Ratchet and Clank.

43:37.040 --> 43:41.360
I'm actually going to skip out on buying Lair and skip on Heavenly Sword.

43:41.360 --> 43:46.280
Lair's been getting some crap reviews though, I'm kind of feeling bad for those guys.

43:46.280 --> 43:49.240
I have a last minute story too about Lair, so let me ask you.

43:49.240 --> 43:52.240
Okay, well let's open up the Skype line and then we'll get into the last minute stories.

43:52.240 --> 43:54.280
Our Skype line is open if you want to give us a call.

43:54.280 --> 44:01.840
Our username is on skypeorangeloungeradio.com or our phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR, that's

44:01.840 --> 44:08.920
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username is on skypeorangeloungeradio.

44:08.920 --> 44:11.120
Go ahead and give us a call.

44:11.120 --> 44:14.920
While we wait for those calls, I'll go to Loki real quick for any last minute stories.

44:14.920 --> 44:19.520
Real quick, you can play Lair on your PSP via remote play.

44:19.520 --> 44:20.520
Whoo!

44:20.520 --> 44:21.520
Gimmicky!

44:21.520 --> 44:24.400
Wait, you can play the whole game on your PSP?

44:24.400 --> 44:29.800
Well, most of it, because the PSP lacks, of course, a second R2 and L2 button.

44:29.800 --> 44:30.800
Interesting.

44:30.800 --> 44:33.840
Well let's go to the phones, we're getting some calls now, I'll come back to that in

44:33.840 --> 44:34.840
a minute.

44:34.840 --> 44:35.840
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

44:35.840 --> 44:39.320
You're getting a special phone call.

44:39.320 --> 44:41.480
I've been getting a special phone call, who's this?

44:41.480 --> 44:44.200
You're getting a special phone call, it's Jason.

44:44.200 --> 44:45.720
Hi Jason, I knew you were Jason.

44:45.720 --> 44:47.560
On again, off again, listen whenever possible.

44:47.560 --> 44:51.400
But our always constant webmaster, and we appreciate you for that.

44:51.400 --> 44:52.400
Always.

44:52.400 --> 44:53.400
Always.

44:53.400 --> 44:57.340
I just want to make you introduce yourself, because not all the podcast people know folks

44:57.340 --> 44:58.340
by their voice.

44:58.340 --> 45:00.040
What's on your mind, Jason?

45:00.040 --> 45:06.280
I was just going to say that if anybody remembers anybody here that actually listens to all

45:06.280 --> 45:11.680
games, they'll probably remember how much of a Wii proponent I was back in the day,

45:11.680 --> 45:16.280
the month or so, whenever it was coming up on the show, the month or so before it came

45:16.280 --> 45:17.280
out.

45:17.280 --> 45:18.280
Right.

45:18.280 --> 45:22.160
They might also remember that on the forums, I mentioned something about me having a feeling

45:22.160 --> 45:26.560
that the Wiis might finally be generally available come springtime.

45:26.560 --> 45:27.760
I was wrong on that one.

45:27.760 --> 45:31.740
Hey, I saw a whole bunch of them sitting on a rack at Fry's the other day, I was finally

45:31.740 --> 45:35.440
surprised to see, I mean there were like 20 of them in this cart, so I was surprised to

45:35.440 --> 45:38.000
see them pretty abundant now.

45:38.000 --> 45:43.240
Amazing that whenever I've been going to stores, whenever we drop by the electronics section

45:43.240 --> 45:47.640
at Walmart, Target, whenever we run by Best Buy, any other electronics related store,

45:47.640 --> 45:51.600
every time I've looked, I've never actually seen one available until today.

45:51.600 --> 45:53.320
And so you know what happened today?

45:53.320 --> 45:54.320
What?

45:54.320 --> 45:55.320
We bought one.

45:55.320 --> 45:56.320
Hooray!

45:56.320 --> 46:03.240
I am now officially a member of the Wii 60 camp, as it were.

46:03.240 --> 46:04.240
Wee!

46:04.240 --> 46:05.240
Yes.

46:05.240 --> 46:12.800
We got, I don't even remember, we got WarioWare Smooth Moves, we got Trauma Center, we got

46:12.800 --> 46:20.840
Mario Party 8, we got Resident Evil 4 Wii, and I'm missing one, yes, that's right, the

46:20.840 --> 46:26.360
Bust and Move 4 Wii version that the screenshots looked absolutely ridiculous, but it's probably

46:26.360 --> 46:28.000
going to be a load of fun.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.200
Wow, very cool.

46:29.200 --> 46:33.000
The only thing you're missing is Metroid Prime, because that game is pretty awesome.

46:33.000 --> 46:38.120
I was looking at that, and I really did like the DS version, with the exception that I've

46:38.120 --> 46:42.800
always played it when I was tired, so I played so little of it, and when it comes to escaping

46:42.800 --> 46:47.960
the planet, I'm way too tired to comprehend where I'm supposed to go, and the 3D map isn't

46:47.960 --> 46:54.200
exactly intuitive when you're so dead tired, but I'm holding off on that for now, not to

46:54.200 --> 46:57.480
mention we picked up a points card, so I'm going to be grabbing a few virtual console

46:57.480 --> 47:02.940
things, and given the 360, given that, given everything else, I'm going to have more than

47:02.940 --> 47:07.160
enough to suffice me for, well, maybe about a week, but, you know, I didn't want to buy

47:07.160 --> 47:08.160
too many things.

47:08.160 --> 47:11.880
And you're adding me to your friend's codes list very soon, aren't you?

47:11.880 --> 47:16.040
Well, of course, I'm going to go through the thread and get just about everybody, probably

47:16.040 --> 47:20.480
everybody, I'm not biased, and then I'll of course be throwing mine in there, and we'll

47:20.480 --> 47:21.800
continue on from there.

47:21.800 --> 47:22.800
Very cool.

47:22.800 --> 47:25.840
Well, congratulations, I'm finally getting a Wii, so do you still, are you still as much

47:25.840 --> 47:29.200
of a proponent for the Wii as you were nine months ago?

47:29.200 --> 47:34.640
I've never stopped, it's just a general availability thing, coupled with money kind of thing, and

47:34.640 --> 47:37.920
we get to thank the lovely Rai Chan for all that, because she's actually the one that

47:37.920 --> 47:38.920
made this all possible.

47:38.920 --> 47:44.560
She's making faces at me, saying, oh, me this, me that, yeah, you're the one that did it.

47:44.560 --> 47:49.840
I thought I heard Rai in the background, so tell her hello from all of us here at O.M.R.

47:49.840 --> 47:52.840
Everybody in O.M.R. says hello, and she says hello.

47:52.840 --> 47:53.840
Hello.

47:53.840 --> 47:57.440
Well, you kids have fun with your Wii, but not too much.

47:57.440 --> 48:02.680
No, I'm off, well, I'm on call tomorrow, but I'm generally off as long as nothing actually

48:02.680 --> 48:03.680
happens.

48:03.680 --> 48:05.520
I have all paid myself to play.

48:05.520 --> 48:06.520
All right.

48:06.520 --> 48:09.520
Well, try to stay off while you're playing with your Wii.

48:09.520 --> 48:11.960
I'll try my best.

48:11.960 --> 48:12.960
All right.

48:12.960 --> 48:13.960
Bye, Jason.

48:13.960 --> 48:14.960
Bye, guys.

48:14.960 --> 48:16.960
Take care.

48:16.960 --> 48:21.680
We love Jason, because he not only hosts our website, but he's just a good kid, so we really

48:21.680 --> 48:22.680
like hearing from Jason.

48:22.680 --> 48:28.600
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is ORANGE LOUNGE

48:28.600 --> 48:29.600
RADIO.

48:29.600 --> 48:30.600
Let's go to the phones.

48:30.600 --> 48:31.600
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

48:31.600 --> 48:32.600
Who's this?

48:32.600 --> 48:33.600
GSX8 again.

48:33.600 --> 48:34.600
You again?

48:34.600 --> 48:35.600
Yes.

48:35.600 --> 48:37.600
Weren't you already on this show?

48:37.600 --> 48:40.600
Yeah, and I got hacked, sort of, by Loki.

48:40.600 --> 48:41.600
All right.

48:41.600 --> 48:42.600
That's the host.

48:42.600 --> 48:43.600
All right.

48:43.600 --> 48:44.600
Well, we've got to keep it real short to let some more people in.

48:44.600 --> 48:45.600
So what's on your mind?

48:45.600 --> 48:46.600
Oh.

48:46.600 --> 48:47.600
Oh.

48:47.600 --> 48:51.240
I might get a new DS in, because my current DS is broken.

48:51.240 --> 48:56.880
Logi said some time ago that their websites were getting hybrid DS being in custom colors.

48:56.880 --> 49:02.080
Logi, what are some specific websites?

49:02.080 --> 49:03.080
Some of the questions dropped.

49:03.080 --> 49:06.760
Are you talking about websites that their DSes are coming in different colors?

49:06.760 --> 49:09.920
There was a website that has different colors for DSes, and I can't remember.

49:09.920 --> 49:11.680
Oh, the, like, custom dozen or whatever?

49:11.680 --> 49:12.680
Yeah.

49:12.680 --> 49:13.680
Yeah, I have to look.

49:13.680 --> 49:14.680
Hold on.

49:14.680 --> 49:17.520
Well, if he can't find it, I can tell you that, now, I know you live nowhere near New

49:17.520 --> 49:21.200
York City, but I don't know if you can import these on eBay or what have you, but the official

49:21.200 --> 49:25.080
Nintendo World store will do all these different types of colors that you can't get.

49:25.080 --> 49:27.440
You know, gosh, you're a pretty penny for them.

49:27.440 --> 49:30.040
Like, I remember being out there, and there was, like, a hot pink DS.

49:30.040 --> 49:33.600
I swear to God, I came so close to buying it for, like, $250, though.

49:33.600 --> 49:34.600
It was expensive.

49:34.600 --> 49:37.240
I want a red DS myself.

49:37.240 --> 49:38.240
Hmm.

49:38.240 --> 49:42.240
Well, don't they have, I could have sworn I saw, not too long ago, they have the red

49:42.240 --> 49:45.240
and black thing now in stores with Brain Age 2, don't they?

49:45.240 --> 49:48.680
Yeah, but only the lid part is red.

49:48.680 --> 49:50.560
Can you still find those Mario Kart DSes in there?

49:50.560 --> 49:51.560
Those aren't lights, huh?

49:51.560 --> 49:52.560
Yeah.

49:52.560 --> 49:53.560
Those aren't lights.

49:53.560 --> 49:58.040
I'm going to get a light soon if my DS, my regular DS, goes to hell.

49:58.040 --> 50:00.040
Yeah, I still have my DS fat somewhere.

50:00.040 --> 50:02.160
I should just give it away on the show or something, because I'm never going to use

50:02.160 --> 50:03.160
it anymore.

50:03.160 --> 50:06.000
But it's not a very exciting DS.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.280
It's an old gray one.

50:07.280 --> 50:09.240
Maybe I'll donate it to charity or something.

50:09.240 --> 50:10.240
DS is a DS.

50:10.240 --> 50:12.240
Okay, I found the website.

50:12.240 --> 50:13.240
Yes.

50:13.240 --> 50:16.300
Although they are more expensive.

50:16.300 --> 50:24.320
It's colorwarepc.com, and they have everything from, I don't see, they used to have PSPs

50:24.320 --> 50:25.880
and DSes, but they don't anymore.

50:25.880 --> 50:27.120
They just have consoles.

50:27.120 --> 50:30.360
They have PlayStation 3s, Xbox 360, and the Wii.

50:30.360 --> 50:37.360
You can actually buy a red PlayStation 3 for an extra hundred bucks, or they have a gold

50:37.360 --> 50:40.320
one and some other crap.

50:40.320 --> 50:42.840
The chat room is yelling at me for thinking about donating my DS.

50:42.840 --> 50:44.120
They want me to give it away.

50:44.120 --> 50:46.440
You greedy bastards.

50:46.440 --> 50:49.640
All right, GSCC, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but thanks so much

50:49.640 --> 50:52.560
for playing our game, and good luck on finding your red DS.

50:52.560 --> 50:53.880
Thanks, no problem.

50:53.880 --> 50:54.880
Bye-bye.

50:54.880 --> 50:56.320
Well, you know what I just thought as well?

50:56.320 --> 50:59.440
He could check Play Asia, because you can import some different colors from Japan, but

50:59.440 --> 51:02.840
I don't think they have red DSes over there, do they?

51:02.840 --> 51:03.880
I can't remember.

51:03.880 --> 51:06.000
There's a lot more different colors over there, though, than there are over here.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.320
I know that.

51:07.320 --> 51:12.240
If there's any more calls, please call in right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or username on

51:12.240 --> 51:13.420
Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

51:13.420 --> 51:16.000
Any other last-minute stories, Loki, while we wait?

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
Nope.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
Just that one.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
No, that's it?

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
Just the one about Laird?

51:20.000 --> 51:24.880
Just the one about Laird, and that's pretty much all that I cared about.

51:24.880 --> 51:30.800
It's been kind of a slow news week, all things considered.

51:30.800 --> 51:33.960
I wonder if that's Labor Day or what the deal is.

51:33.960 --> 51:34.960
Maybe.

51:34.960 --> 51:37.680
Then there's less people listening to the show tonight than usual, probably again because

51:37.680 --> 51:39.760
of Labor Day and all that stuff.

51:39.760 --> 51:42.680
People are out vacationing and doing what have you.

51:42.680 --> 51:43.680
You'll figure.

51:43.680 --> 51:44.680
Yeah.

51:44.680 --> 51:47.240
Well, I guess that's all the folks that wanted to call in.

51:47.240 --> 51:49.360
Their phone's not ringing anymore.

51:49.360 --> 51:50.400
People are just being shy.

51:50.400 --> 51:52.360
The usual suspects are on vacation.

51:52.360 --> 51:57.200
So, and if there's no more last-minute stories, that takes us to the end of the show.

51:57.200 --> 51:59.020
Cry, cry.

51:59.020 --> 52:00.400
Any final thoughts, folks?

52:00.400 --> 52:01.400
Let's go around.

52:01.400 --> 52:05.360
Mikkel Tod, thank you for being here, even if you didn't contribute much tonight.

52:05.360 --> 52:09.240
We appreciate your moral support, and I'm... You okay over there?

52:09.240 --> 52:11.800
I'm trying to... I'm doing cryptograms.

52:11.800 --> 52:15.840
What is your late... What is your new obsession with cryptograms here?

52:15.840 --> 52:16.840
I love them.

52:16.840 --> 52:18.040
They're so much fun.

52:18.040 --> 52:20.240
Is there a website that you play all these things on?

52:20.240 --> 52:21.240
Cryptograms.org.

52:21.240 --> 52:25.420
Is this because you're too busy now, or, I mean, now, I'm sorry, now you're too bored

52:25.420 --> 52:28.000
because now that you won Survivor, there's nothing else to do.

52:28.000 --> 52:33.360
I want to win another Survivor game, but I don't... Nothing's going on with it.

52:33.360 --> 52:35.160
But you lost Pirate Master, right?

52:35.160 --> 52:39.360
Yeah, but that's because I hated people, and I didn't want to talk to them.

52:39.360 --> 52:41.080
At least that's what I'm going to say it is.

52:41.080 --> 52:42.080
I don't know why else.

52:42.080 --> 52:46.360
Hey, those of you guys that listen to this show and think it would be fun to play one

52:46.360 --> 52:50.040
of these games online, I'm going to talk in a future edition a little more in depth about

52:50.040 --> 52:52.160
these online games, because I think they're kind of interesting.

52:52.160 --> 52:55.800
It's not really video game related, but I think they're really kind of different.

52:55.800 --> 52:58.880
So I'm going to definitely talk a little more in depth about these games a little later

52:58.880 --> 53:03.400
on when a particular game I'm thinking of is going to be recruiting soon.

53:03.400 --> 53:05.800
I'm going to have some folks on to talk about those.

53:05.800 --> 53:07.800
That should be interesting, right?

53:07.800 --> 53:08.800
Yes.

53:08.800 --> 53:09.800
Right.

53:09.800 --> 53:14.560
And, Loki, thank you for being here as always, even if you wouldn't drink with me.

53:14.560 --> 53:15.560
We didn't really get drunk tonight.

53:15.560 --> 53:16.560
It's kind of sad.

53:16.560 --> 53:18.400
I didn't drink enough.

53:18.400 --> 53:21.500
I was nervous because of being on meds and all, and then Shane doesn't really drink ever

53:21.500 --> 53:25.520
and you just drove, so kind of... I'm sorry if we disappointed on the alcoholic content

53:25.520 --> 53:26.520
tonight.

53:26.520 --> 53:29.120
I drank three of these Smirnoffs, but I'm not feeling anything.

53:29.120 --> 53:31.040
Yeah, I don't know.

53:31.040 --> 53:33.100
Well, your final thought, Loki?

53:33.100 --> 53:37.400
My final thought is, I don't know, I wish there was some more news.

53:37.400 --> 53:39.920
Oh, this is a slow week.

53:39.920 --> 53:43.160
I'm sure things will be definitely speeding up towards the end of the year, that's for

53:43.160 --> 53:45.560
sure, as games are released and everything.

53:45.560 --> 53:49.520
My final thought is, this Arctic berry is probably my favorite flavor of Smirnoff Ice

53:49.520 --> 53:50.520
yet.

53:50.520 --> 53:51.960
I don't know what your problem is with this blueberry.

53:51.960 --> 53:53.400
It's too berry.

53:53.400 --> 53:54.400
It's good.

53:54.400 --> 53:55.960
It's delicious berry is what it is.

53:55.960 --> 53:56.960
All right.

53:56.960 --> 54:00.800
I'm looking at chat room to see some stuff here.

54:00.800 --> 54:05.240
Son of Dad says, final thought, Metroid Prime 3 will own my soul this week.

54:05.240 --> 54:06.280
It really will.

54:06.280 --> 54:07.680
It's so good.

54:07.680 --> 54:09.960
All right.

54:09.960 --> 54:11.180
That's it, kids.

54:11.180 --> 54:12.180
We're out of here.

54:12.180 --> 54:13.180
Thank you guys so much.

54:13.180 --> 54:14.180
I know it's a little short tonight, but that's all right.

54:14.180 --> 54:17.280
I mean, it was slow news week and Labor Day weekend and everything, but thank you guys

54:17.280 --> 54:21.560

friends in other ways, whether it be on Digg podcast or Yahoo podcast or what have you.

There's plenty of ways to get the word out.

54:41.240 --> 54:45.520
