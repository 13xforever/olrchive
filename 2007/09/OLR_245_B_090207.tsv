15480	20760	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20760	22360	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
22360	26600	We are live on this Sunday evening, September 2nd of 2007.
26600	29360	Happy Labor Day weekend to those of you guys that are in the States, to those of you guys
29360	33320	that aren't in the States, well, happy weekend and happy Monday and hope your week is pretty
33320	34320	cool.
34320	36560	Anyhow, we're going to get right back into the gaming news this week.
36560	39160	Sadly, Dark Sakura is not here this week.
39160	41640	Labor Day weekend just happens to be our anniversary.
41640	44680	I think she planned it that way so she could have a three-day weekend off every year, but
44680	45680	oh well.
45680	49680	Regardless, she's not here tonight, unfortunately, but we're still here going over the gaming
49680	50680	news.
50680	53160	Shane is here filling in, although he's doing a terrible job because he's just sitting here
53160	55360	all night playing PSP.
55360	61240	I don't have a computer to look at everybody because my computer is off.
61240	64920	Well the thing you can look forward to is that in 40 minutes, the operator 11 thing
64920	66880	cuts off, so then you can use that again.
66880	67880	So there you go.
67880	68880	Hooray.
68880	70920	All right, let's get back into the gaming news.
70920	71920	Loki.
71920	74180	Anyways, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.
74180	75400	We know it's coming out this year.
75400	77620	We know it looks pretty good.
77620	79640	What we didn't know is what exactly had in it.
79640	83940	Of course now they're promising that it's going to feature more than 40 cars, tracks
83940	89760	with reverse and alternate routes, and Gran Turismo TV, an online video channel for the
89760	91800	PlayStation Network.
91800	96800	Also we found out that it's going to be available online for purchase, and it's also going to
96800	102480	be available via Blu-ray, just like Warhawk.
102480	106800	To which I say, why don't you just finish Gran Turismo 5 instead of releasing these
106800	109920	half games and charging people money for them?
109920	114720	I mean seriously, stop making demos for Gran Turismo 5 and work on the damn game.
114720	118600	Well, aren't they trying to give people a reason to keep a look out for the PlayStation
118600	119600	3?
119600	120600	Yeah.
120600	124400	The reason is, oh yeah, we promised you Gran Turismo 5 at launch.
124400	125400	Oh, guess what?
125400	126660	It's not going to be done until next year.
126660	130280	So what we're going to do is we're going to use this as another exclusive title, despite
130280	133680	the fact that it's really kind of a demo, and we're going to throw it out there.
133680	137040	Oh, and by the way, you're going to purchase Gran Turismo 5 when it comes out as well,
137040	141040	despite the fact that it's going to have exactly the same content, plus more.
141040	144560	GS68 says, Gran Turismo Forever.
144560	148240	And Dark Tetsuya says, I don't know, Loki, Gran Turismo demos are usually more packed
148240	149800	than most full-blown racing games.
149800	151900	Yeah, but this one you have to pay for.
151900	154040	Those comments are coming from our chatroom, chat.orangelounge80.com.
154040	159100	I don't have a problem with Gran Turismo HD, which is free, but I do have a problem with
159100	162640	paying for Gran Turismo 5, which is only going to have 40 cars.
162640	166080	Here's the problem actually they're going to run into is, what if people don't really
166080	169160	want to buy the full Gran Turismo 5?
169160	175840	Now you have this Gran Turismo prologue that's just as good, you know, might get people through,
175840	180600	and now they're not selling tons of copies of their $60 retail game.
180600	181600	Uh-oh.
181600	182600	Uh-oh.
182600	183600	All right.
183600	189320	Well, I know Loki has no problem with this SingStar on the PlayStation 2, because Loki
189320	191400	loves his karaoke PS2 games, right?
191400	192400	Oh, yeah.
192400	193400	Oh, yeah.
193400	194400	Totally.
194400	196920	So why does the SingStar pack, don't tell the wife about this one, or she's going to
196920	197920	want you to buy it?
197920	198920	She doesn't care.
198920	199920	Oh, okay.
199920	200920	Good.
200920	201920	Why doesn't she care?
201920	202920	I thought she loved karaoke games.
202920	203920	Because I'm not going to buy them.
203920	204920	Okay.
204920	205920	Did you affirm that?
205920	206920	Did you tell the wife about the karaoke games?
206920	210200	I told her I wouldn't buy them, and I told her that there was this coming out, and she's
210200	211480	like, so?
211480	212480	So what?
212480	213480	Yeah.
213480	214480	She wants to spend the money on herself.
214480	219480	I'll buy her SingStar PS3 if she wants, and she can record herself singing on like...
219480	221440	I want to come over and play that if you guys get it.
221440	222700	PlayStation Network and stuff.
222700	224000	I will not touch this game.
224000	225000	Yes, you will.
225000	227360	As I will not touch the singing portion of Rock Band.
227360	228360	Yes, you will.
228360	231760	All we have to do is to, one night when you don't drive, we have to get you to drink a
231760	233520	little bit, and then you'll be good.
233520	234520	Okay.
234520	235840	You were at my bachelor party.
235840	237640	I was near alcohol, boys.
237640	239360	Which, by the way, is on YouTube.
239360	243120	If you want to see Loki driving Mario Kart drunk, just search for Orange Lawn Radio.
243120	244120	It's there.
244120	246680	Too bad we didn't have the rest of the stuff on there, like me playing miniature golf.
246680	248240	Oh, that was so freaking funny.
248240	250560	I still have the videos for that.
250560	256200	Anyways though, but yeah, I was pretty sick with tons of alcohol, and they tried to get
256200	259440	me to sing karaoke at a bar, and I would not do it.
259440	263760	So I will not sing karaoke no matter how much alcohol is in me.
263760	266280	All right, well, damn.
266280	271320	Well anyway, if I could get to the story, SingStar is coming out on the PlayStation
271320	272320	2.
272320	276300	Well, it's already there, but the thing is that now there is a bundle coming out.
276300	282920	It's $150 US, and it's coming out with SingStar, and I'm trying to figure out which version
282920	283920	of SingStar it is.
283920	289520	SingStar Pop is coming out in November, and it's going to be a white PlayStation 2 to
289520	293060	perfectly match your Wii if you are so inclined.
293060	294280	So enjoy that.
294280	295280	150 bucks.
295280	296640	Not a bad deal for those two games.
296640	300920	It also, by the way, comes with a controller, a white controller, and two microphones.
300920	304920	So you're all set for a karaoke party with this if you're a SingStar fan.
304920	308600	I mean, I know some people prefer Karaoke Revolution, but it really isn't at all the
308600	309600	same game in the end.
309600	312600	It's people making asses of themselves in front of their friends, right?
312600	313600	Yeah.
313600	314600	All right.
314600	319120	We touched on this a little bit in part A with the whole Manhunt 2 being re-rated thing,
319120	326920	but Cinder Yee, Leland Yee from California, is actually on the record saying that he favors
326920	333240	the adults-only rating and wishes that they allowed those to be played on consoles.
333240	338320	Basically, you know, that there should be an adult-only rated game instead of having
338320	340200	the Censor games.
340200	343680	And I think he'd probably like to see a lot more of the mature-rated games being adult-only
343680	349160	because that is pretty self-explanatory.
349160	350440	It's for adults only.
350440	355320	It's not, you know, maybe some parent thinks, oh, my kid's mature enough to play this game,
355320	356320	you know.
356320	358280	Instead of that, it is pretty self-explanatory.
358280	359280	And I agree with him.
359280	361440	I think that they should have adult-only games on consoles.
361440	364000	I mean, consoles are for everyone.
364000	365600	It's not just for families.
365600	366600	And you know what?
366600	367600	So what?
367600	371560	If you rate it AO and, you know, Walmart and everybody does not decide to carry it, that's
371560	372800	the publisher's decision.
372800	377120	They know what they're getting into and what hurdles they're going to have to overcome
377120	382120	rating it AO or having a game being released rated AO.
382120	385400	But I think it also would give them a lot more freedom to put whatever the fuck they
385400	388580	want in it, which would be awesome.
388580	395040	It is kind of interesting that the guy's been branded as this anti-video games guy, but
395040	401000	I find it very interesting that he is actually supportive of, okay, the content can be out
401000	402000	there.
402000	404980	You know, I don't care if the AO content is out there, and in fact, we should have a place
404980	409060	for it, but just not falling in children's laps or whatever.
409060	411560	We need to police it so that it doesn't get in children's laps.
411560	416400	He basically says in the OA, the use of the ambiguous term mature, many parents are left
416400	422360	with a false sense of how violent an emirated game may be, and obviously, even with some
422360	430240	retailers as, of course, the Federal Trade Commission study suggested.
430240	433280	I just think, you know, I think they should do it.
433280	434360	I think somebody should try.
434360	440520	You know, it's just like they say whoever's going to win the HD DVD and Blu-ray war is
440520	444480	going to be whatever system gets the most porn, is going to be what decides that war.
444480	450880	I mean, seriously, we're not banning adult DVDs out there, and I would think that that's
450880	456200	a lot easier for kids to get a hold of than, you know, adult games.
456200	461280	But they need to get past the point that games are not just for kids.
461280	463760	It's an entertainment media.
463760	464760	It's for everybody.
464760	467840	It can be anything, all age ranges.
467840	472300	So get past that and start treating it like it is any other media.
472300	477200	You know, make it available to the consumers that it's appropriate for.
477200	478200	Alright.
478200	484440	Well, one game I'd like to see an AO version of someday is Silent Hill, because the game
484440	486760	is very sick and twisted as it is in its mature format.
486760	489120	Imagine if they could step up the violence even more.
489120	490960	You're a big fan of Silent Hill, aren't you, Mipotas?
490960	491960	Yes.
491960	492960	Yes.
492960	495240	Would you like to see a version that's even more violent?
495240	496240	Yes.
496240	497240	No.
497240	498240	No?
498240	499240	No.
499240	500240	Does it scare you as it is already?
500240	502040	No, I don't think it's about violence in that game.
502040	503600	Disturbing imagery, yes.
503600	504600	Violence, no.
504600	505600	Alright.
505600	508800	Well, there will be plenty of disturbing imagery in Silent Hill 5.
508800	513560	The collective who's developing the game, as you know, it's kind of a controversial
513560	516440	decision that the collective is developing this, so it's being actually developed in
516440	518320	the US and not in Japan.
518320	522320	But the collective is developing this game and they are actually borrowing elements from
522320	526640	the Christoph Ganz version of Silent Hill, which would be the movie.
526640	530120	Apparently they were big fans of kind of the way that the characters moved around in the
530120	531120	movie.
531120	535480	So there will be some motion capture for the monsters in the Silent Hill 5 game.
535480	536920	All of the monsters.
536920	541040	And they are borrowing the whole night to day element that was in the movie.
541040	544700	Remember how in the movie it would switch from, you know, I guess you could say night
544700	548700	to day or good Silent Hill to bad Silent Hill, it would kind of switch?
548700	550360	That's going to happen in Silent Hill 5.
550360	553560	And now you were actually reading up a little more on Silent Hill 5.
553560	556720	Some article that was in a recent gaming magazine, right, Mipotas?
556720	557720	Yeah.
557720	559760	And what other details did it give about the game?
559760	563340	The nurses are the nurses from the movie, like, full on.
563340	567240	They're the ones that are attracted to light and they look exactly the same.
567240	569600	What was this whole thing about now the monsters will chase you?
569600	574520	Oh yeah, the monsters just won't, you can't just run by monsters anymore, like, apparently
574520	577760	they kick down doors to get to you, which is really cool.
577760	580480	And I don't know, I can't wait for it.
580480	583880	I can't wait to get some of my friends who get really scared by these games, like I'm
583880	587920	thinking of one in particular that cried when she was fighting one of the boss monsters
587920	588920	in Silent Hill 3.
588920	589920	Oh, that was the best thing ever.
589920	594080	I can't wait to get her to play this game because I'm evil and vindictive and I think
594080	597200	it's going to be hilarious when the monsters start kicking down doors to get to her.
597200	601040	Yeah, she'll throw the controller down and run into a different room and cry.
601040	604320	And hopefully we'll have it all up on one of these video streaming sites for you to
604320	605320	enjoy.
605320	607640	What you guys don't get about our friend, though, is, like, I'll go and pretend I'm
607640	610920	one of the monsters, I won't be dressed up or anything, I'll just walk like they were
610920	613440	and she hates it and freaks out.
613440	614840	So good.
614840	618800	pikaruno agrees, I get so scared I can't even play Silent Hill.
618800	623560	The first Silent Hill, I'm sure I've mentioned this before, but when I tried to play it,
623560	627720	I stopped it nine times at the very beginning because it was too scary.
627720	629600	That's just how great these games are.
629600	630600	Wow.
630600	632120	That's cool.
632120	635720	Asdartitsuyu in our chatroom says, what a horrible night to have a curse.
635720	636720	Funny.
636720	639620	Because it's a Castlevania reference, never mind.
639620	641280	I don't even get it.
641280	643300	Forget it.
643300	644440	That's all I have to say on Silent Hill.
644440	645760	I'm definitely looking forward to Silent Hill 5.
645760	646760	I looked at the same article, too.
646760	648640	It looks like it's going to be pretty sweet.
648640	654080	Actually, let me ask real quick, Shane, since you're such a big fan of the series from before,
654080	656280	are you looking forward to this?
656280	659000	I know that you were a little nervous when you heard it was going to a different developer
659000	661920	and it's being developed outside of Japan, but seeing kind of what they've done with
661920	663080	it, are you looking forward to it?
663080	665000	Are you still a little nervous or what?
665000	666000	I'm still nervous.
666000	670120	The screenshots are good looking, but that doesn't tell you how the game plays or if
670120	675280	the story is really good or if they have the elements that make it Silent Hill in the game
675280	676280	or not.
676280	680160	It could just be like, I don't know, they could have made a really nice looking, what
680160	682960	was that crappy game called?
682960	686520	The one where you were all the teenagers in the school and all the plant monsters were
686520	689320	obscure or something like that.
689320	691040	Why are you shaking your head at me a lot?
691040	692040	Nothing.
692040	693040	I'm just...
693040	694040	Oh, yeah.
694040	695040	It could be like that.
695040	696880	That could look really pretty, but it could be a terrible game like that game was.
696880	697880	So I don't know.
697880	698880	I hope, but...
698880	702560	Maybe the liquor is just starting to kick in, so I'm just nodding a little more than
702560	703560	usual.
703560	704560	Okay.
704560	705560	Maybe.
705560	706560	Maybe.
706560	707560	Maybe.
707560	708560	All right.
708560	709560	I'm done.
709560	710560	Next story.
710560	716080	Anywho, so one game I'm not too excited about, Loco Roco for the PS3.
716080	723080	It's been dated for a release in Japan on the PlayStation Network September 21st, and
723080	725240	no price is announced yet.
725240	735180	It's looks like Odeo Loco Roco Boo Boo Coco Reco or something, I don't know.
735180	737080	All you need to know is that...
737080	738080	Wait.
738080	743120	Loco Roco Boo Goo Coco for Coco Puff Roco Boco is what it is.
743120	747560	What it probably means is, they don't know that it's just an interactive screen saver.
747560	751440	You fuck tards and you're going to pay money for this, thinking it's a real game, and ha,
751440	754640	ha, we screw you over again.
754640	755640	That's exactly...
755640	759640	Loco Roco Coo Coo Boco fuck tard, is that it?
759640	762240	Basically, the game is an interactive screen saver.
762240	769720	You will be able to use the six axis to tilt Loco Rocos around, but that's about it.
769720	771440	So hooray!
771440	774520	Thank you for yet another awesome game, Sony.
774520	775520	You rock.
775520	778520	Do you think Loco Roco just jumped the shark with this?
778520	784800	I think it's just, why even bother calling this a game, or even have to purchase it,
784800	788080	if it's, you know, not even really a game.
788080	789640	It's just a fucking screen saver.
789640	793640	Well, speaking of content available on the PlayStation Network, there's something brand
793640	797240	new available on the PlayStation Network for those of you guys in the UK.
797240	798800	It's the Dirt demo.
798800	802680	If you want to check out the brand new game Dirt, there's a demo for you guys on the UK
802680	805120	marketplace, which should be interesting to note.
805120	810480	The US also got this demo along with other stuff, but unfortunately those you guys overseas
810480	816320	get the shaft yet again in terms of content available in your PlayStation 3 marketplace.
816320	818920	Have a nice day, but enjoy the Dirt demo.
818920	822760	It's a pretty looking game, but I couldn't control it at all, but it's just not my kind
822760	823760	of racing game.
823760	826320	That's just me, I guess.
826320	831900	Anyways, one other game that you probably won't see over in the UK also is being developed
831900	835200	by Homeland Security in the US.
835200	841920	They are developing a game, of course, I guess, I don't know, something where you, of course,
841920	850400	defending the United States from terrorists, and they've spent $600,000 of funding Ground
850400	851560	Truth.
851560	855800	It's a game that would, I guess, cast players in the first responders to a terrorist attack
855800	857900	or natural disasters.
857900	862860	Thank you, Homeland Security, for spending our money on a game instead of protecting
862860	864560	the homeland.
864560	867680	Is this a free download thing for PCs, or is this like a Flash game?
867680	868680	What the hell is this?
868680	869680	It's just something that's being developed.
869680	872760	It's not even done yet, so we don't know if it's going to be free or whatnot.
872760	873760	Interesting.
873760	875760	What do they hope to accomplish with a game like this, I wonder?
875760	878920	Wouldn't it be funny if the terrorists played it instead?
878920	887880	It would probably be to build on the success that, say, America's Army had.
887880	892180	I was just thinking of America's Army, and even Jonathan F. in our chat room says, America's
892180	894720	Army was free.
894720	896440	Dark Tetsuya says, Shane went there.
896440	898600	When do I not go there, seriously?
898600	903940	I guess the game is being developed by Sandia National Labs with grad students from University
903940	907240	of Southern California doing the graphics work.
907240	908480	Interesting.
908480	913700	So stop spending government money on this crap, seriously.
913700	915320	You don't need a fucking game.
915320	920320	You don't see the Department of Transportation saying, we want a game, or you know, God knows
920320	921320	what else.
921320	925560	They should have like a Bush PR campaign game or something.
925560	927760	Interesting point from an escapist in our chat room.
927760	932840	That may seem like an expensive game to make, but keep in mind King's Quest cost $700,000
932840	934880	when it first came out all those years ago.
934880	935880	Hmm.
935880	936880	Oh, great.
936880	938540	Isn't all that marketing?
938540	943160	They're going to waste a lot of money building this game, and it's going to suck.
943160	944160	That's awesome.
944160	947960	Wait, you're not trying to say King's Quest sucks, does it, because King's Quest is like
947960	948960	one of the greatest games ever made.
948960	950440	King's Quest is fucking old.
950440	952720	So it's old, but it's great.
952720	957440	Well, back in the day, $700,000 is probably a lot of money.
957440	962280	Nowadays production costs have gone up due to the wonderful systems and graphics that
962280	964280	we have and have come to love.
964280	973400	So back in the day, it was EGA graphics, all fucking 16 colors of wonderful goodness.
973400	974880	All right.
974880	978800	Well, this is a topic that's never fun to talk about, and I hate it when it comes up
978800	983600	on the show, but I think we need to bring this up one more time to bring up the clarification
983600	987200	piece that came out this week, and that would have to do with the really horrible tragedy
987200	990240	that happened at Virginia Tech earlier this year.
990240	994820	Many months later now, the Virginia State report, the official final report has come
994820	995820	out.
995820	1000440	The Virginia Tech Massacre Review Panel has released their report, and it does show that
1000440	1005760	there is no link between video games and the murders that were committed by the culprit.
1005760	1011240	Actually, the only game that is even mentioned in the report is Sonic the Hedgehog.
1011240	1016400	Now I would fail to see where Sonic the Hedgehog is going to provoke violent gaming.
1016400	1021860	Unless he went and played the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 version of the game, which the
1021860	1024840	controls were horrible and could drive someone to kill people.
1024840	1029320	Anyway, there was in the report, quote, none of the video games were war games or had violent
1029320	1030320	themes.
1030320	1034640	They liked basketball and had a collection of figurines and remote-controlled cars.
1034640	1040400	So this is a big screw you to all those people that were so quick to blame video games when
1040400	1041480	this happened.
1041480	1047120	So the Jack Voldemort's of the world and Dr. Phil's and so on.
1047120	1061360	So to you folks, we dedicate a very special segment this week to you.
1061360	1062600	It's our FUs of the Week.
1062600	1066200	Loki, why don't you start us off with your FUs of the Week.
1066200	1068680	My FUs of the Week goes to the Lifetime Channel.
1068680	1075100	I don't like you, and I don't see the point.
1075100	1077040	That's it?
1077040	1081360	And to the director of that stupid movie that I had to watch today, learn how to light a
1081360	1082360	fucking movie.
1082360	1087280	Otherwise, you're going to be stuck making shit on Lifetime.
1087280	1090520	First off, I'd like to give an FU to Loki for not enjoying the greatness of his Lifetime
1090520	1092600	movies, because I love Lifetime movies.
1092600	1097720	I'd also like to give an FU to getting sick when I was traveling this week.
1097720	1101080	The only thing worse than having to travel and be gone for four days is getting sick
1101080	1103560	while you're gone and bringing that back with you.
1103560	1106600	That really stinks.
1106600	1107600	And then I guess that's it.
1107600	1108840	I can't really think of anything else this week.
1108840	1109840	So that's all my FUs.
1109840	1112840	Shane, Miklotov, whatever your name is.
1112840	1113840	Any FUs?
1113840	1114840	No.
1114840	1115840	No?
1115840	1116840	You're happy about everything?
1116840	1119920	No, but I can't think of anything to give an FU to.
1119920	1120920	Everything's perfect?
1120920	1121920	You're not angry at anything?
1121920	1122920	No.
1122920	1125520	Well, FU to you being so darn mellow.
1125520	1126880	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
1126880	1130360	FU to Blue Dragon, because it sucks.
1130360	1131360	There we go.
1131360	1132360	FU to you?
1132360	1133360	You don't even...
1133360	1134360	Do you even know why you hate Blue Dragon?
1134360	1135360	Yes.
1135360	1136360	The combat is boring.
1136360	1137360	The combat is awesome.
1137360	1138360	The game is dull looking.
1138360	1139360	You're dull looking.
1139360	1145720	It looks like a generic RPG that could have been made by any company ever.
1145720	1149880	That I actually, you know, unfortunately there's not a lot that sets this apart from another
1149880	1152960	RPG except for the fact that it's on the 360 and it's pretty.
1152960	1153960	But...
1153960	1155480	The character models even look pretty bland.
1155480	1156640	The music's good.
1156640	1159240	No, because those boss fights have terrible, terrible songs.
1159240	1161720	The boss fight song's awesome.
1161720	1162720	No.
1162720	1163720	Worst game.
1163720	1166600	The boss fight song is a vocal rock song, which is pretty rad.
1166600	1168360	Don't listen to what Shane says.
1168360	1169360	No.
1169360	1170360	Listen to what I say.
1170360	1171360	No, don't.
1171360	1172360	All right.
1172360	1173360	Back to the news.
1173360	1180240	Anyways, Castlevania, the wonderful game that's gonna become a movie, yay, is now being completely
1180240	1181240	rewritten.
1181240	1185680	Yes, they've thrown out the script and are going back to the drawing boards.
1185680	1191800	Apparently, Paul W.S. Anderson, who was going to direct the movie, is not now, obviously,
1191800	1197160	and now they have a new person working on the script.
1197160	1202800	It's Ian Jeffers, who's done a screenplay for the wonderful Kevin Bacon action flick
1202800	1206440	that just got released here in the United States, Death Sentence.
1206440	1211920	Yes, you may not have seen it yet, but I'm sure that you will at some point because that's
1211920	1216000	super awesome and I know you wouldn't miss it.
1216000	1218160	So he's working on the script now.
1218160	1223600	His take on it, I guess, and of course the new director is Sylvain White, says, I was
1223600	1230500	attracted by the chance to make a dark, epic period movie that almost has an anime feel
1230500	1232720	to it.
1232720	1243920	So let's hope and pray that it doesn't suck, and unfortunately past track records of movie
1243920	1245160	games have not been...
1245160	1249160	My Magic A-Ball says, signs do not look good.
1249160	1254160	Loki, coming from the chat room here, did you like the band Deep Purple?
1254160	1257640	Do you remember the band at all, Deep Purple?
1257640	1259520	The one that did Smoke on the Water?
1259520	1262960	Yeah, no, actually I got to ask Shane this, do you know the band Deep Purple?
1262960	1265600	Yes, because Smoke on the Water.
1265600	1269360	The lead singer of Deep Purple is the guy that sings the song in Blue Dragon.
1269360	1272720	No wonder it sounds bad.
1272720	1277160	That little tidbit coming from Escapist, so there you go.
1277160	1278640	Let's talk about other movies.
1278640	1280200	Now of course there's been lots of movies this year.
1280200	1284280	You have King of Kong, which I still want to see, but I think the closest it's playing
1284280	1285280	here is San Francisco.
1285280	1289080	I'm not driving all the way out there just to see a movie, and Chasing Ghosts are some
1289080	1292280	big movies that are coming out this year, but there's another one that's coming out.
1292280	1295180	It's called Press Start.
1295180	1297680	It's not a documentary, however.
1297680	1301280	This is a quote from the little synopsis of the movie.
1301280	1305960	Zach Nimbus is a typical suburban youth and volunteer monster exterminator living peacefully
1305960	1307520	in a video game world.
1307520	1311320	It's a realm where people actually do cross rivers by jumping across alligators' heads
1311320	1314680	or being chomped to death in the attempt, and where injuries can be cured by eating
1314680	1317080	food laying around in old hallways.
1317080	1321500	Here the pleasant days are ending due to world conquest by the unspeakably evil but insecure
1321500	1325320	and telephone addicted wizard, Count Nefarious Vile.
1325320	1331180	Zach soon finds himself recruited by battle-hardened space soldier Sam, an enthusiastically bad
1331180	1342920	tempered ninja Lin Koo to join a last desperate attempt to thwart Vile's imminent victory,
1342920	1346840	but not before lampooning every video game convention that comes in their way.
1346840	1351220	So apparently this is going to be some type of little live action movie that parodies
1351220	1352760	all these other video games.
1352760	1353760	Here's the thing, though.
1353760	1356960	If you think this is some huge production that's putting this out, this movie looks
1356960	1359280	like it cost about $20 to make.
1359280	1361320	So don't be expecting a big budget production.
1361320	1381600	But hey, just because it has no budget doesn't mean it can't be good.
1381600	1385060	There is a trailer available, by the way, which you can watch on YouTube if you just
1385060	1389200	look for Press Start, the movie, there's actually a trailer, or actually looking at it in the
1389200	1391680	studio right now if you want to kind of check this out here.
1391680	1399800	Would you mind telling me what you were doing with these, hmm?
1399800	1405600	Don't forget what I did to your brother.
1405600	1419640	In a world ruled by an evil sorcerer, two rebels seek a hero foretold by an ancient
1419640	1420640	prophecy.
1420640	1423360	Who is ancient prophecy?
1423360	1427920	An ancient prophet.
1427920	1430960	This looks like that cheerleader ninjas movie.
1430960	1432520	I love LARPing.
1432520	1434520	Let's make it into a movie.
1434520	1438320	Why'd you let him hit you?
1438320	1439320	It was his turn.
1439320	1440320	On September 25th.
1440320	1441320	Batten down the hatches.
1441320	1442320	Rile up the mechanical dinosaurs.
1442320	1443320	It won't be a game.
1443320	1444320	Congratulations.
1444320	1445320	You've just leveled up.
1445320	1446320	Because it's a movie.
1446320	1454600	Did you see the graphics on that tree thing there?
1454600	1456600	That was crazy.
1456600	1461640	Those fools have no idea what horrors await them.
1461640	1464080	Thank you for warning us that the movie will suck.
1464080	1465080	Awesome.
1465080	1467880	Oh, it's going straight to DVD.
1467880	1470680	Never would have guessed that.
1470680	1471680	You never know.
1471680	1472680	It might be decent.
1472680	1473680	No, it might.
1473680	1475560	We'll try and get some of the guys from the movie on the show or something.
1475560	1476560	Where would you buy that DVD?
1476560	1477560	Like at a garage sale or something?
1477560	1478560	I guess from the website.
1478560	1479560	There's a little website.
1479560	1480940	It's straight on the website.
1480940	1486160	They're relying on a buzzword called, you know, it's like a viral marketing.
1486160	1487560	In other words, people...
1487560	1488560	Well, it's working.
1488560	1491680	We talked about it on our program and it was on a lot of major game blogs.
1491680	1496000	There was that funny part in the thing, though, about that it was his turn to attack.
1496000	1497000	I like that.
1497000	1498000	So it was like an RPG.
1498000	1499000	That was funny.
1499000	1502520	Come on, if you can sit through that Cheerleader Ninjas, I'm sure you can make it through this
1502520	1503520	movie, Loki.
1503520	1504520	There might be something about it.
1504520	1505520	Cheerleader Ninjas had nudity in it.
1505520	1506520	This might.
1506520	1507520	You never know.
1507520	1508520	That's a point.
1508520	1509520	Yeah, that's true.
1509520	1510520	There could be nudity in this movie.
1510520	1511520	Direct to DVD.
1511520	1512520	For artistic purposes.
1512520	1516040	No, they don't have the budget for nudity.
1516040	1517560	Would you really want to see any of them naked?
1517560	1518560	I don't know.
1518560	1519560	I don't think so.
1519560	1523360	What we're going to do is we're going to open up the Skype line because it's time to play
1523360	1526360	Beat the Host.
1526360	1533160	I love that song.
1533160	1534160	Let's just listen to that.
1534160	1535160	Okay.
1535160	1536160	Great.
1536160	1537160	All right.
1537160	1538160	Tonight we're going to play Beat the Host.
1538160	1541240	We're going to take our first caller on the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio, our username
1541240	1546040	on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR to play Beat the Host.
1546040	1549600	I've got to warn you, if you want to play tonight, you need to have some type of working
1549600	1553680	knowledge about music and video games or else your chances are going to be a little bit
1553680	1557840	screwed in tonight's game.
1557840	1558840	Here we go.
1558840	1561160	We're going to take our first call on the Skype line.
1561160	1565300	Again, our username is Orange Lounge Radio or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
1565300	1566300	Here we go.
1566300	1567300	We've got to call.
1567300	1568300	Hello.
1568300	1569300	Who's this?
1569300	1570300	It always gets through.
1570300	1571300	GS68.
1571300	1572300	Hi, GS68.
1572300	1573300	No, it's not Ravens Dolphin tonight.
1573300	1574300	It's GS68.
1574300	1575300	Hey, GS68.
1575300	1576300	All right.
1576300	1579120	Are you ready to play some Beat the Host tonight?
1579120	1580120	Yeah.
1580120	1581120	I'll give it a shot.
1581120	1582120	All right.
1582120	1586760	Now, how would you say your knowledge of old school or new school video game music is?
1586760	1587760	Eh.
1587760	1588760	All right.
1588760	1592800	Well, you sound very enthusiastic about your chances in tonight's Beat the Host.
1592800	1594360	All right.
1594360	1596280	Tonight you can challenge to Beat the Host.
1596280	1599640	I'm not going to let you play against Shane because he already kind of knows what's going
1599640	1600640	on tonight.
1600640	1602920	I know, but I never get to play.
1602920	1604920	He's just going to pick Matt.
1604920	1605920	Probably picks Matt anyway.
1605920	1606920	All right.
1606920	1607920	It's not even like they have to ask.
1607920	1611000	If I let you pick, you'd probably pick Matt, wouldn't you?
1611000	1614400	What would be wrong with challenging you?
1614400	1617040	Oh, you can't challenge me because I wrote the questions.
1617040	1618040	Oh, I see.
1618040	1619040	Oh, I see.
1619040	1620040	All right.
1620040	1621040	So, by process of elimination.
1621040	1622040	All right.
1622040	1623040	I'll go with Loki.
1623040	1624040	All right.
1624040	1628080	Then, Loki's going to beat the host tonight in Beat the Host, and tonight's challenge
1628080	1629080	is...
1629080	1631400	It should be called Beat the Host Named Loki.
1631400	1636480	Tonight's challenge is Put My Thing Down, Flip It, and Reverse It, is the name of tonight's
1636480	1638160	challenge.
1638160	1644360	Tonight's challenge is about who can identify the most video game music songs being played
1644360	1645360	backwards.
1645360	1646360	Okay?
1646360	1647360	Oh, God.
1647360	1652760	Now, these could be songs anywhere from an 8-bit Atari era all the way through new school
1652760	1655640	Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 games.
1655640	1656640	Okay?
1656640	1660280	If things drag on, I will give you guys hints to help you guess the game.
1660280	1661480	Which one to get it gets the point.
1661480	1662480	All right?
1662480	1663480	So, you guys know how to play?
1663480	1664480	I'm ready.
1664480	1665480	All right.
1665480	1666480	So, you guys are going to go at the same time.
1666480	1669560	GS68, make sure you yell out your answers nice and loud so I can hear you over the music.
1669560	1670560	Okay?
1670560	1671560	And I have to leave the chat room, right?
1671560	1672560	Yes.
1672560	1675400	You do need to leave the chat room or else people are going to help you cheat, and we
1675400	1676400	can't have that.
1676400	1677400	All right.
1677400	1678400	Okay?
1678400	1679400	All right.
1679400	1680400	All right.
1680400	1682400	Is he out of chat?
1682400	1683400	Okay.
1683400	1684400	You left the chat room, GS68?
1684400	1685400	Yeah.
1685400	1686400	Okay.
1686400	1687400	Now, remember, you don't have to send me a private message or anything.
1687400	1690400	Just yell it out when you know it, because you're up against Matt in real time, okay?
1690400	1691400	Okay.
1691400	1693720	So, I'm going to keep score here, and...
1693720	1695120	There should be buzzers.
1695120	1696520	There should be, but we don't have any.
1696520	1697520	Let's go D.
1697520	1698520	Buzz.
1698520	1699520	We're a low-budget production.
1699520	1700520	Okay.
1700520	1701520	Here we go.
1701520	1702720	Here's song number one, and the first one to get it gets a point.
1702720	1705400	And remember, these are being played backwards.
1705400	1707400	Okay.
1707400	1718440	What's that, GS68?
1718440	1721760	I've heard this on the OLAR stream, but I can't put my finger on it.
1721760	1726140	Keep going.
1726140	1728280	This game was on the Dreamcast.
1728280	1732320	Seriously, you guys?
1732320	1733320	Space Shell 5.
1733320	1734320	Thank you.
1734320	1735320	Yes.
1735320	1736320	Loki got a point, finally.
1736320	1737320	Sorry.
1737320	1738320	How did you get to that?
1738320	1739320	I was...
1739320	1740320	Because it sounded to me...
1740320	1747160	It almost sounded like Tank from Cowboy Bebop, but I just started thinking about stuff that
1747160	1748160	have the same kind of pro music.
1748160	1749160	All right.
1749160	1751880	Well, again, remember, these songs are being played backwards.
1751880	1754160	To me, it sounded like a song from Loop on the Third.
1754160	1755160	Exactly.
1755160	1756160	See, it's kind of along the same lines.
1756160	1757160	All right.
1757160	1758160	All right.
1758160	1761080	Well, Loki has a point, but GS68, there's 10 songs tonight, so all is not lost.
1761080	1762080	You ready for song number two?
1762080	1763080	Yep.
1763080	1764080	All right.
1764080	1765080	Here we go.
1765080	1769040	Here we go.
1769040	1770040	Animal Crossing.
1770040	1771040	Ooh!
1771040	1772040	Loki's on fire!
1772040	1776040	GS68, did you even hear any of that?
1776040	1777040	Yeah.
1777040	1778040	Couldn't recognize it.
1778040	1780760	It was Animal Crossing, the little drum, tap, little quiet stuff.
1780760	1781760	Yes, it was Animal Crossing.
1781760	1782760	Good job, Loki.
1782760	1783760	You played the game way too much.
1783760	1784760	All right.
1784760	1785760	Here we go.
1785760	1786760	Here's another one.
1786760	1788320	Remember, these could be from any system, new school or old school.
1788320	1789320	Here we go.
1789320	1790320	Here's number three.
1790320	1791320	Luminous.
1791320	1799720	Oh, GS68 knew that one too.
1799720	1800720	That's right.
1800720	1801720	That was Shining from Luminous.
1801720	1802720	Damn, Loki, on fire.
1802720	1804440	That sounded so evil backwards.
1804440	1805440	It did sound like it.
1805440	1806440	You want to hear a little more?
1806440	1807440	Yeah, a little bit more.
1807440	1808440	Want to hear a little more?
1808440	1809440	Oh, now it's a little healthier.
1809440	1810440	I like it backwards.
1810440	1817200	I want an MP3 of it backwards now.
1817200	1819360	I can send you an MP3 of it backwards if you want.
1819360	1820360	That'd be cool.
1820360	1821360	All right.
1821360	1822360	GS68, it's three-nothing.
1822360	1823360	All right.
1823360	1826360	You got to make some progress here, okay?
1826360	1827360	All right.
1827360	1828840	We're pulling for you, though.
1828840	1830080	Here we go.
1830080	1831080	Here's number four.
1831080	1832080	Ready?
1832080	1833080	Yeah.
1833080	1847080	This
1847080	1848080	game was on the NES.
1848080	1849080	Master Master?
1849080	1851600	No.
1851600	1852600	Super Contra?
1852600	1853600	No.
1853600	1854600	Contra?
1854600	1855600	No.
1855600	1856600	Ready to legend?
1856600	1857600	What'd you say?
1857600	1858600	Ready to legend?
1858600	1864500	No, it's not ready to legend.
1864500	1868000	This game had a character named Ryu.
1868000	1869000	Ninja Gaiden.
1869000	1872000	Oh, Loki got it.
1872000	1875120	Needed a couple clues to get it, but it was Ninja Gaiden.
1875120	1876120	Stage one music.
1876120	1879160	GS68, it's not looking good.
1879160	1882480	I'm sorry to say, but try to get some points on the board, okay?
1882480	1884120	We're all pulling for you, all right?
1884120	1885120	Yeah.
1885120	1886120	All right.
1886120	1889240	I'll bust Loki's kneecaps so he has a challenge in some of these later ones.
1889240	1890240	Okay, you ready?
1890240	1891240	Okay, here we go.
1891240	1892240	Here comes song number five.
1892240	1893240	You ready, GS68?
1893240	1894240	Yeah.
1894240	1895240	You can do it.
1895240	1896240	Act Freezer.
1896240	1897240	Sonic!
1897240	1898240	No.
1898240	1899240	Yes.
1899240	1900240	GS68 got one.
1900240	1901240	Wow.
1901240	1902240	I think the room...
1902240	1903240	What was that?
1903240	1906520	GS68 got one.
1906520	1908280	I think the roof came off his house.
1908280	1909280	It was Sonic.
1909280	1910280	Oh.
1910280	1911280	Oh, that's right.
1911280	1912280	Yeah.
1912280	1914360	I thought he yelled a bad word.
1914360	1916360	That is what you said, right, GS68?
1916360	1917360	Yeah.
1917360	1920280	That's what I heard, but he did it in that old...
1920280	1924920	I think it was an allusion to the old Sega commercials when he yelled it out.
1924920	1925920	He yelled, Sonic!
1925920	1927920	Or he just really wanted to win.
1927920	1930320	That was the bonus stage in Sonic.
1930320	1931320	The bonus stage music.
1931320	1932320	Yeah.
1932320	1933320	All right.
1933320	1934320	All right.
1934320	1935320	Good.
1935320	1936320	I'm so glad to see you get on the board, GS68.
1936320	1937320	All right.
1937320	1938320	Here we go into the next question.
1938320	1940520	Question number six, I believe this one is.
1940520	1944520	Here we go.
1944520	1946520	Parappa the Rapper.
1946520	1948240	Ooh.
1948240	1950360	Mere seconds splitting it up.
1950360	1953320	I could hear GS68 start to say it as Loki got it out.
1953320	1954920	It was Parappa the Rapper.
1954920	1955920	All right.
1955920	1958280	This next one's a little bit tougher, GS68.
1958280	1959280	You ready?
1959280	1961880	Ready for the next one, GS68?
1961880	1962880	Yes.
1962880	1963880	Okay.
1963880	1967880	Here we go.
1967880	1988760	This is on the 360.
1988760	1992480	And the PC.
1992480	1995480	Not that one yet.
1995480	1999720	I guess.
1999720	2002520	No.
2002520	2003880	This is a role playing game.
2003880	2007240	I don't think that's the 11th.
2007240	2008240	No.
2008240	2009240	Oblivion.
2009240	2010240	Yes.
2010240	2011240	Finally.
2011240	2012240	Jesus.
2012240	2013240	Sorry.
2013240	2014240	It took long enough.
2014240	2015240	Yes.
2015240	2016240	It was Oblivion.
2016240	2017240	All right.
2017240	2021680	Looks like Loki has six, so there's no possible way you're going to be able to win GS68, but
2021680	2023160	keep playing just for the fun of it, okay?
2023160	2024160	All right.
2024160	2025160	All right.
2025160	2026160	We're going to get through the rest of this.
2026160	2027160	Here we go.
2027160	2028160	Here comes the next one.
2028160	2029160	Contra.
2029160	2030160	No.
2030160	2031160	No, it's Castlevania.
2031160	2032160	Castlevania IV.
2032160	2033160	No.
2033160	2034160	Symphony and Night.
2034160	2035160	No.
2035160	2036160	Castlevania III.
2036160	2037160	No.
2037160	2038160	Dracula X.
2038160	2039160	GS68.
2039160	2047360	I think he just gave up.
2047360	2049200	Castlevania II Science Quest.
2049200	2050200	Finally.
2050200	2051200	Jesus Christ.
2051200	2052200	Yes.
2052200	2053200	I didn't go through all of them.
2053200	2054200	GS68.
2054200	2057160	You should have jumped in there when his weak point was exposed.
2057160	2059920	For massive damage, you could have jumped in there with number two.
2059920	2061920	You're going to know it.
2061920	2062920	All right.
2062920	2064280	Here we go.
2064280	2065280	Here comes number nine.
2065280	2068740	Now, I'm going to say I think this was the hardest one in the whole bunch.
2068740	2077400	If either one of you can get this, props to you.
2077400	2083640	All right.
2083640	2092440	This game was also on the 360 and PC.
2092440	2093440	Fantasy Star Universe?
2093440	2094440	No.
2094440	2097440	What was that?
2097440	2102400	Final Fantasy XI?
2102400	2106520	No.
2106520	2110560	This game was the same composer who did the music to Oblivion.
2110560	2112560	Blair?
2112560	2114760	No.
2114760	2121600	The story of this game has to do with alien abduction.
2121600	2122600	Alien?
2122600	2124760	Can I guess?
2124760	2125760	What was that, GS68?
2125760	2129120	I was going to say Alien Syndrome, but I forgot that's not on the PC.
2129120	2130120	Oh, God.
2130120	2133080	I know the game, but I just can't think of the name.
2133080	2137200	This game is notable for featuring a Native American lead character.
2137200	2138200	Prey.
2138200	2139200	Yes.
2139200	2140200	GS68.
2140200	2141200	I was like, finally.
2141200	2142200	It was on the tip of my tongue.
2142200	2143200	Yes.
2143200	2144200	It's Prey.
2144200	2145200	All right.
2145200	2146200	Good job.
2146200	2147200	Good job, GS68.
2147200	2148200	I knew the game.
2148200	2149200	I just couldn't think of the name.
2149200	2150200	All right.
2150200	2151760	Let's move on.
2151760	2153320	Ready for the last one, you guys?
2153320	2154320	Yes.
2154320	2155320	Here it is.
2155320	2156320	That was Butterfly.
2156320	2157320	Yes, Loki.
2157320	2158320	All right.
2158320	2159320	That's an accident.
2159320	2160320	Wow.
2160320	2161320	GS68, you got smoked tonight, I'm sorry to say.
2161320	2162320	GG.
2162320	2163320	A score is 8 to 2.
2163320	2164320	Did you just say GG?
2164320	2165320	Yes.
2165320	2166320	Yes.
2166320	2167320	GG, Loki.
2167320	2168320	GG.
2168320	2169320	GG.
2169320	2175320	Well, I'm sorry, GS68, you lost tonight, but it's our consolation prize.
2175320	2188320	We'll give you a second to plug anything you want to plug real quick.
2188320	2191800	I don't have anything to plug.
2191800	2193320	I'm sorry to hear it.
2193320	2194320	All right.
2194320	2195840	Well, thanks for playing anyway, GS68.
2195840	2196840	We appreciate it.
2196840	2197840	No problem.
2197840	2198840	All right.
2198840	2199840	Later, dude.
2199840	2201880	Good job, Loki.
2201880	2205160	You know, isn't that game unfair to the listener?
2205160	2206160	Why is that?
2206160	2207720	Because there's a time delay?
2207720	2211960	No, because when they're on Skype, it's still instantaneous.
2211960	2212960	Oh.
2212960	2213960	Yeah.
2213960	2216360	There's only the time delay if they're listening over Live 365, but they shouldn't be doing
2216360	2218360	that when they're playing that.
2218360	2219360	All right.
2219360	2224600	Looking at a chat and seeing what's going on, Zappy says, that was a hard beat the host
2224600	2225600	tonight.
2225600	2226800	Go Banjo thinks the last one was easy.
2226800	2230400	Well, if you're a DDR nerd, then the last one was easy, so there you go.
2230400	2231400	All right.
2231400	2232560	Let's get back into some gaming news.
2232560	2233560	That's it for beat the host tonight.
2233560	2237520	If you guys like those games or other games like it, send us an email, mailbag at orangehousereader.com.
2237520	2242960	We're looking for ideas for new games, by the way, so just wanted to put that out there.
2242960	2244640	All right.
2244640	2246080	Let's get back into the gaming news.
2246080	2248680	Loki, take it away.
2248680	2249680	Sorry.
2249680	2253200	Anyways, so yeah, there's some interesting stuff.
2253200	2254720	This is really interesting.
2254720	2258300	Nokia has unveiled the N-Gage gaming platform.
2258300	2262880	Now remember that they are not making any more gaming systems, but their new Nokia phones,
2262880	2269200	of course, are going to be supporting the brand new gaming platform, which looks okay.
2269200	2275280	They've got a few people on board already, including Electronic Arts, Capcom, and Viviti,
2275280	2278760	and they've got some other exclusive games as well.
2278760	2288440	It will be compatible with the Nokia models N73, N81, N93, and N95, and with more S60
2288440	2293160	models to be compatible at a later date.
2293160	2297840	The games right now, they're going to be free to demo, but will cost between 6 and 10 euros
2297840	2304480	to buy the full version and feature online play against friends or, of course, random
2304480	2311440	people via the N-Gage arena, which it kept trying to get me to walk into during E3.
2311440	2316680	The N-Gage arena at the last E3 that was a real E3 was pretty swanky.
2316680	2319440	Yeah, they actually had a really nice booth at the last E3.
2319440	2325760	Too bad it was a piece of crap product, but it was still a nice booth.
2325760	2326760	What do you think of this news?
2326760	2328000	I mean, I don't think this is so bad.
2328000	2329640	I think it's kind of neat.
2329640	2339160	I think it's much better than the N-Gage's actual system was, so there you go.
2339160	2343360	Let's move on to the next story, which is about a new PC demo, other things you can
2343360	2344680	do with your PC.
2344680	2351720	Crysis is getting a PC demo on September 25, 2007, but the one thing about that day you
2351720	2356800	should also keep in mind, that's the same day the Halo 3 comes out, so something to
2356800	2357800	keep in mind.
2357800	2359440	Well, a lot of people are anticipating this game.
2359440	2363960	It's a big first-person shooter for the PC, so if you want to take that PC versus console
2363960	2366560	gaming to a whole new level, there you have it.
2366560	2371840	Thank you to the folks behind Crysis for doing this, so funny.
2371840	2380400	Also, there is a new game, or I should say an older game, that is free now.
2380400	2386760	Command & Conquer, the Gold Edition, is free to download, and you can download it actually
2386760	2392020	off of, I believe, the official Command & Conquer website.
2392020	2399400	That's pretty awesome, and I guess they're also featuring Command & Conquer Strategy
2399400	2403000	for the month of September.
2403000	2404000	What do you mean by strategy?
2404000	2406040	Like free strategy guys or something?
2406040	2407040	Yeah.
2407040	2408040	Huh.
2408040	2415480	I guess it's an ISO image, so you'd have to burn it to a CD, but that's pretty awesome
2415480	2416480	though.
2416480	2417480	Command & Conquer is a cool game.
2417480	2418480	That's pretty cool.
2418480	2424200	Anyhow, another PC game that is free and has been free for quite a while, MapleStory, is
2424200	2425200	getting an update.
2425200	2428320	I know some of you guys out there like to play this game, MapleStory.
2428320	2432400	It's a free MMO that's available out there, and there's some brand new stuff being added
2432400	2433400	to the game.
2433400	2443000	The Mountain Village of Mulung is being added, as well as a new town called Herb Town.
2443000	2444000	Like the herbs?
2444000	2446960	Yeah, like, you know, let's go smoke a joint, man.
2446960	2451840	Or maybe not, but those are being added to MapleStory this week, so check that out.
2451840	2457560	I should also say that Mulung features a salon where players can buy new hairstyles.
2457560	2459400	That's a feature coming to WoW pretty soon, right?
2459400	2461040	Yes, I can't wait.
2461040	2462040	You love to customize hairstyles.
2462040	2464120	You know, you've been looking for a new MMO to play.
2464120	2465900	Why haven't you been playing MapleStory?
2465900	2467760	Because I've tried it before, and I thought it was a piece of crap.
2467760	2469280	Why did you think it was a piece of crap?
2469280	2470280	It was boring.
2470280	2473760	I didn't understand what I was doing, and my character was ugly.
2473760	2477720	I don't play ugly characters.
2477720	2482520	Herb Town, by the way, includes new monsters to fight, but no word yet if you can actually
2482520	2484800	score some herbs in Herb Town.
2484800	2493640	Well, following Lost Planet, and I guess Ghost Recon releasing some map packs for free, Gears
2493640	2499880	of War, the map pack that's been available so far, the Hidden Fronts map pack is going
2499880	2504160	to be available for free as well, starting in September.
2504160	2509720	Actually, tomorrow at 2am is going to be when it's going to be available, September 3rd.
2509720	2514920	You can get four maps that are included with that, including Bullet Marsh, Garden, Process,
2514920	2516240	and Subway.
2516240	2517480	So that's not bad.
2517480	2519320	Free is always good.
2519320	2523160	Hooray for free, AIDS.
2523160	2526480	I notice there's a lot of people online that aren't playing Gears of War anymore.
2526480	2527480	I wonder why that is.
2527480	2531040	I guess it's just because there's all these other Xbox 360 games capturing people's attention
2531040	2535320	now, but it seems like Gears of War was the big thing not that long ago, and now I barely
2535320	2538080	see people on my friends list playing that game anymore.
2538080	2541760	Maybe these free maps will breathe some life back into it, what do you think?
2541760	2546120	I doubt it, because they've been available for a while now, so I figured if people wanted
2546120	2548680	them they would have already bought them.
2548680	2554320	Well, now there's been a lot of stories going around about how the 60GB PlayStation 3 is
2554320	2559080	officially no more, that they completely sold out, but Sony would like you to know that
2559080	2566080	they have replenished their PlayStation 3 supply of 60GB PlayStation 3s on sonystyle.com.
2566080	2571560	That's because they were on backorder at one point, they are now back in stock, so there's
2571560	2575320	no official word if the 60GB are officially gone or not.
2575320	2581520	That actually makes sense to me, because sonystylestore, whatever it's called, is not Sony, Inc.
2581520	2582520	You know what I mean?
2582520	2587640	It's just another store, like any other GameStop or whatever, it just happens to be run by
2587640	2588640	Sony.
2588640	2592720	So of course they're going to run out, it doesn't mean the whole supply is gone.
2592720	2596160	This isn't really a whole lot of big news to me, but just to kind of stop the doom and
2596160	2600360	gloom that was going around about, oh the 60GBs are gone, they're gone forever, and
2600360	2601360	so on.
2601360	2604040	One of these days I'll buy a PlayStation 3.
2604040	2605040	One of these days.
2605040	2611720	It's alright, one of these days there'll be games for it, and I own a PS3 and I'm kind
2611720	2612720	of disappointed.
2612720	2617040	Luckily though, in October though, I'm looking forward to Ratchet and Clank.
2617040	2621360	I'm actually going to skip out on buying Lair and skip on Heavenly Sword.
2621360	2626280	Lair's been getting some crap reviews though, I'm kind of feeling bad for those guys.
2626280	2629240	I have a last minute story too about Lair, so let me ask you.
2629240	2632240	Okay, well let's open up the Skype line and then we'll get into the last minute stories.
2632240	2634280	Our Skype line is open if you want to give us a call.
2634280	2641840	Our username is on skypeorangeloungeradio.com or our phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR, that's
2641840	2648920	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username is on skypeorangeloungeradio.
2648920	2651120	Go ahead and give us a call.
2651120	2654920	While we wait for those calls, I'll go to Loki real quick for any last minute stories.
2654920	2659520	Real quick, you can play Lair on your PSP via remote play.
2659520	2660520	Whoo!
2660520	2661520	Gimmicky!
2661520	2664400	Wait, you can play the whole game on your PSP?
2664400	2669800	Well, most of it, because the PSP lacks, of course, a second R2 and L2 button.
2669800	2670800	Interesting.
2670800	2673840	Well let's go to the phones, we're getting some calls now, I'll come back to that in
2673840	2674840	a minute.
2674840	2675840	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
2675840	2679320	You're getting a special phone call.
2679320	2681480	I've been getting a special phone call, who's this?
2681480	2684200	You're getting a special phone call, it's Jason.
2684200	2685720	Hi Jason, I knew you were Jason.
2685720	2687560	On again, off again, listen whenever possible.
2687560	2691400	But our always constant webmaster, and we appreciate you for that.
2691400	2692400	Always.
2692400	2693400	Always.
2693400	2697340	I just want to make you introduce yourself, because not all the podcast people know folks
2697340	2698340	by their voice.
2698340	2700040	What's on your mind, Jason?
2700040	2706280	I was just going to say that if anybody remembers anybody here that actually listens to all
2706280	2711680	games, they'll probably remember how much of a Wii proponent I was back in the day,
2711680	2716280	the month or so, whenever it was coming up on the show, the month or so before it came
2716280	2717280	out.
2717280	2718280	Right.
2718280	2722160	They might also remember that on the forums, I mentioned something about me having a feeling
2722160	2726560	that the Wiis might finally be generally available come springtime.
2726560	2727760	I was wrong on that one.
2727760	2731740	Hey, I saw a whole bunch of them sitting on a rack at Fry's the other day, I was finally
2731740	2735440	surprised to see, I mean there were like 20 of them in this cart, so I was surprised to
2735440	2738000	see them pretty abundant now.
2738000	2743240	Amazing that whenever I've been going to stores, whenever we drop by the electronics section
2743240	2747640	at Walmart, Target, whenever we run by Best Buy, any other electronics related store,
2747640	2751600	every time I've looked, I've never actually seen one available until today.
2751600	2753320	And so you know what happened today?
2753320	2754320	What?
2754320	2755320	We bought one.
2755320	2756320	Hooray!
2756320	2763240	I am now officially a member of the Wii 60 camp, as it were.
2763240	2764240	Wee!
2764240	2765240	Yes.
2765240	2772800	We got, I don't even remember, we got WarioWare Smooth Moves, we got Trauma Center, we got
2772800	2780840	Mario Party 8, we got Resident Evil 4 Wii, and I'm missing one, yes, that's right, the
2780840	2786360	Bust and Move 4 Wii version that the screenshots looked absolutely ridiculous, but it's probably
2786360	2788000	going to be a load of fun.
2788000	2789200	Wow, very cool.
2789200	2793000	The only thing you're missing is Metroid Prime, because that game is pretty awesome.
2793000	2798120	I was looking at that, and I really did like the DS version, with the exception that I've
2798120	2802800	always played it when I was tired, so I played so little of it, and when it comes to escaping
2802800	2807960	the planet, I'm way too tired to comprehend where I'm supposed to go, and the 3D map isn't
2807960	2814200	exactly intuitive when you're so dead tired, but I'm holding off on that for now, not to
2814200	2817480	mention we picked up a points card, so I'm going to be grabbing a few virtual console
2817480	2822940	things, and given the 360, given that, given everything else, I'm going to have more than
2822940	2827160	enough to suffice me for, well, maybe about a week, but, you know, I didn't want to buy
2827160	2828160	too many things.
2828160	2831880	And you're adding me to your friend's codes list very soon, aren't you?
2831880	2836040	Well, of course, I'm going to go through the thread and get just about everybody, probably
2836040	2840480	everybody, I'm not biased, and then I'll of course be throwing mine in there, and we'll
2840480	2841800	continue on from there.
2841800	2842800	Very cool.
2842800	2845840	Well, congratulations, I'm finally getting a Wii, so do you still, are you still as much
2845840	2849200	of a proponent for the Wii as you were nine months ago?
2849200	2854640	I've never stopped, it's just a general availability thing, coupled with money kind of thing, and
2854640	2857920	we get to thank the lovely Rai Chan for all that, because she's actually the one that
2857920	2858920	made this all possible.
2858920	2864560	She's making faces at me, saying, oh, me this, me that, yeah, you're the one that did it.
2864560	2869840	I thought I heard Rai in the background, so tell her hello from all of us here at O.M.R.
2869840	2872840	Everybody in O.M.R. says hello, and she says hello.
2872840	2873840	Hello.
2873840	2877440	Well, you kids have fun with your Wii, but not too much.
2877440	2882680	No, I'm off, well, I'm on call tomorrow, but I'm generally off as long as nothing actually
2882680	2883680	happens.
2883680	2885520	I have all paid myself to play.
2885520	2886520	All right.
2886520	2889520	Well, try to stay off while you're playing with your Wii.
2889520	2891960	I'll try my best.
2891960	2892960	All right.
2892960	2893960	Bye, Jason.
2893960	2894960	Bye, guys.
2894960	2896960	Take care.
2896960	2901680	We love Jason, because he not only hosts our website, but he's just a good kid, so we really
2901680	2902680	like hearing from Jason.
2902680	2908600	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is ORANGE LOUNGE
2908600	2909600	RADIO.
2909600	2910600	Let's go to the phones.
2910600	2911600	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2911600	2912600	Who's this?
2912600	2913600	GSX8 again.
2913600	2914600	You again?
2914600	2915600	Yes.
2915600	2917600	Weren't you already on this show?
2917600	2920600	Yeah, and I got hacked, sort of, by Loki.
2920600	2921600	All right.
2921600	2922600	That's the host.
2922600	2923600	All right.
2923600	2924600	Well, we've got to keep it real short to let some more people in.
2924600	2925600	So what's on your mind?
2925600	2926600	Oh.
2926600	2927600	Oh.
2927600	2931240	I might get a new DS in, because my current DS is broken.
2931240	2936880	Logi said some time ago that their websites were getting hybrid DS being in custom colors.
2936880	2942080	Logi, what are some specific websites?
2942080	2943080	Some of the questions dropped.
2943080	2946760	Are you talking about websites that their DSes are coming in different colors?
2946760	2949920	There was a website that has different colors for DSes, and I can't remember.
2949920	2951680	Oh, the, like, custom dozen or whatever?
2951680	2952680	Yeah.
2952680	2953680	Yeah, I have to look.
2953680	2954680	Hold on.
2954680	2957520	Well, if he can't find it, I can tell you that, now, I know you live nowhere near New
2957520	2961200	York City, but I don't know if you can import these on eBay or what have you, but the official
2961200	2965080	Nintendo World store will do all these different types of colors that you can't get.
2965080	2967440	You know, gosh, you're a pretty penny for them.
2967440	2970040	Like, I remember being out there, and there was, like, a hot pink DS.
2970040	2973600	I swear to God, I came so close to buying it for, like, $250, though.
2973600	2974600	It was expensive.
2974600	2977240	I want a red DS myself.
2977240	2978240	Hmm.
2978240	2982240	Well, don't they have, I could have sworn I saw, not too long ago, they have the red
2982240	2985240	and black thing now in stores with Brain Age 2, don't they?
2985240	2988680	Yeah, but only the lid part is red.
2988680	2990560	Can you still find those Mario Kart DSes in there?
2990560	2991560	Those aren't lights, huh?
2991560	2992560	Yeah.
2992560	2993560	Those aren't lights.
2993560	2998040	I'm going to get a light soon if my DS, my regular DS, goes to hell.
2998040	3000040	Yeah, I still have my DS fat somewhere.
3000040	3002160	I should just give it away on the show or something, because I'm never going to use
3002160	3003160	it anymore.
3003160	3006000	But it's not a very exciting DS.
3006000	3007280	It's an old gray one.
3007280	3009240	Maybe I'll donate it to charity or something.
3009240	3010240	DS is a DS.
3010240	3012240	Okay, I found the website.
3012240	3013240	Yes.
3013240	3016300	Although they are more expensive.
3016300	3024320	It's colorwarepc.com, and they have everything from, I don't see, they used to have PSPs
3024320	3025880	and DSes, but they don't anymore.
3025880	3027120	They just have consoles.
3027120	3030360	They have PlayStation 3s, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
3030360	3037360	You can actually buy a red PlayStation 3 for an extra hundred bucks, or they have a gold
3037360	3040320	one and some other crap.
3040320	3042840	The chat room is yelling at me for thinking about donating my DS.
3042840	3044120	They want me to give it away.
3044120	3046440	You greedy bastards.
3046440	3049640	All right, GSCC, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but thanks so much
3049640	3052560	for playing our game, and good luck on finding your red DS.
3052560	3053880	Thanks, no problem.
3053880	3054880	Bye-bye.
3054880	3056320	Well, you know what I just thought as well?
3056320	3059440	He could check Play Asia, because you can import some different colors from Japan, but
3059440	3062840	I don't think they have red DSes over there, do they?
3062840	3063880	I can't remember.
3063880	3066000	There's a lot more different colors over there, though, than there are over here.
3066000	3067320	I know that.
3067320	3072240	If there's any more calls, please call in right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or username on
3072240	3073420	Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
3073420	3076000	Any other last-minute stories, Loki, while we wait?
3076000	3077000	Nope.
3077000	3078000	Just that one.
3078000	3079000	No, that's it?
3079000	3080000	Just the one about Laird?
3080000	3084880	Just the one about Laird, and that's pretty much all that I cared about.
3084880	3090800	It's been kind of a slow news week, all things considered.
3090800	3093960	I wonder if that's Labor Day or what the deal is.
3093960	3094960	Maybe.
3094960	3097680	Then there's less people listening to the show tonight than usual, probably again because
3097680	3099760	of Labor Day and all that stuff.
3099760	3102680	People are out vacationing and doing what have you.
3102680	3103680	You'll figure.
3103680	3104680	Yeah.
3104680	3107240	Well, I guess that's all the folks that wanted to call in.
3107240	3109360	Their phone's not ringing anymore.
3109360	3110400	People are just being shy.
3110400	3112360	The usual suspects are on vacation.
3112360	3117200	So, and if there's no more last-minute stories, that takes us to the end of the show.
3117200	3119020	Cry, cry.
3119020	3120400	Any final thoughts, folks?
3120400	3121400	Let's go around.
3121400	3125360	Mikkel Tod, thank you for being here, even if you didn't contribute much tonight.
3125360	3129240	We appreciate your moral support, and I'm... You okay over there?
3129240	3131800	I'm trying to... I'm doing cryptograms.
3131800	3135840	What is your late... What is your new obsession with cryptograms here?
3135840	3136840	I love them.
3136840	3138040	They're so much fun.
3138040	3140240	Is there a website that you play all these things on?
3140240	3141240	Cryptograms.org.
3141240	3145420	Is this because you're too busy now, or, I mean, now, I'm sorry, now you're too bored
3145420	3148000	because now that you won Survivor, there's nothing else to do.
3148000	3153360	I want to win another Survivor game, but I don't... Nothing's going on with it.
3153360	3155160	But you lost Pirate Master, right?
3155160	3159360	Yeah, but that's because I hated people, and I didn't want to talk to them.
3159360	3161080	At least that's what I'm going to say it is.
3161080	3162080	I don't know why else.
3162080	3166360	Hey, those of you guys that listen to this show and think it would be fun to play one
3166360	3170040	of these games online, I'm going to talk in a future edition a little more in depth about
3170040	3172160	these online games, because I think they're kind of interesting.
3172160	3175800	It's not really video game related, but I think they're really kind of different.
3175800	3178880	So I'm going to definitely talk a little more in depth about these games a little later
3178880	3183400	on when a particular game I'm thinking of is going to be recruiting soon.
3183400	3185800	I'm going to have some folks on to talk about those.
3185800	3187800	That should be interesting, right?
3187800	3188800	Yes.
3188800	3189800	Right.
3189800	3194560	And, Loki, thank you for being here as always, even if you wouldn't drink with me.
3194560	3195560	We didn't really get drunk tonight.
3195560	3196560	It's kind of sad.
3196560	3198400	I didn't drink enough.
3198400	3201500	I was nervous because of being on meds and all, and then Shane doesn't really drink ever
3201500	3205520	and you just drove, so kind of... I'm sorry if we disappointed on the alcoholic content
3205520	3206520	tonight.
3206520	3209120	I drank three of these Smirnoffs, but I'm not feeling anything.
3209120	3211040	Yeah, I don't know.
3211040	3213100	Well, your final thought, Loki?
3213100	3217400	My final thought is, I don't know, I wish there was some more news.
3217400	3219920	Oh, this is a slow week.
3219920	3223160	I'm sure things will be definitely speeding up towards the end of the year, that's for
3223160	3225560	sure, as games are released and everything.
3225560	3229520	My final thought is, this Arctic berry is probably my favorite flavor of Smirnoff Ice
3229520	3230520	yet.
3230520	3231960	I don't know what your problem is with this blueberry.
3231960	3233400	It's too berry.
3233400	3234400	It's good.
3234400	3235960	It's delicious berry is what it is.
3235960	3236960	All right.
3236960	3240800	I'm looking at chat room to see some stuff here.
3240800	3245240	Son of Dad says, final thought, Metroid Prime 3 will own my soul this week.
3245240	3246280	It really will.
3246280	3247680	It's so good.
3247680	3249960	All right.
3249960	3251180	That's it, kids.
3251180	3252180	We're out of here.
3252180	3253180	Thank you guys so much.
3253180	3254180	I know it's a little short tonight, but that's all right.
3254180	3257280	I mean, it was slow news week and Labor Day weekend and everything, but thank you guys
