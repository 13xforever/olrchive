487	5551	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5891	14738	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15459	19082	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20686	22307	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
22327	25749	We are live on this Sunday evening, September the 2nd of 2007.
26550	28791	Happy Labor Day weekend to those of you guys that are in the States.
28871	33554	To those of you guys that aren't in the States, well, happy weekend and happy Monday and hope your week is pretty cool.
34375	36496	Anyhow, we're going to get right back into the gaming news this week.
36576	38318	Sadly, DarkSakura is not here this week.
39178	40779	Labor Day weekend just happens to be her anniversary.
41720	45122	I think she planned it that way so she could have a three-day weekend off every year, but oh well.
45509	49993	Regardless, she's not here tonight, unfortunately, but we're still here going over the gaming news.
50313	54257	Shane is here filling in, although he's doing a terrible job because he's just sitting here all night playing PSP.
55498	57700	I don't have a computer to look at everybody.
57800	61543	Oh, because your Mac is being used now for the Operator 11 thing.
61563	66747	Well, the thing you can look forward to is that in 40 minutes, the Operator 11 thing cuts off, so then you can use that again.
66848	67748	So, there you go.
68109	68509	Hooray.
68949	70371	All right, let's get back into the gaming news.
70431	70691	Loki.
71582	74124	Anyways, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.
74144	75325	We know it's coming out this year.
75365	76406	We know it looks pretty good.
77547	79528	What we didn't know is what exactly had in it.
79628	90877	Of course, now they're promising that it's going to feature more than 40 cars, tracks with reverse and alternate routes, and Gran Turismo TV, an online video channel for the PlayStation Network.
91598	100244	Also, we found out that it's going to be available online for purchase, and it's also going to be available via Blu-ray, just like Warhawk.
102441	109630	to which I say, why don't you just finish Gran Turismo 5 instead of releasing these half games and charging people money for them?
109990	114676	I mean, seriously, stop making demos for Gran Turismo 5 and work on the damn game.
114976	118520	Why aren't they trying to give people a reason to keep a lookout for the PlayStation 3?
119972	120933	GS68 says, Gran Turismo Forever
144514	146155	and DarkTetsuya says, I don't know, Loki.
146475	149677	Gran Turismo demos are usually more packed than most full-blown racing games.
149857	151097	Yeah, but this one you have to pay for.
151818	155000	Those comments are coming from our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
155180	157641	I don't have a problem with Gran Turismo HD, which is free, but...
158348	158528	Uh-oh.
158548	158668	Uh-oh.
158688	158988	All right.
183956	186118	Well, I know Loki has no problem with this.
186358	191202	SingStar on the PlayStation 2, because Loki loves his karaoke PS2 games, right?
191282	191862	Oh, yeah.
192003	192443	Oh, yeah.
192583	193003	Totally.
193264	195385	Well, there's actually a SingStar pack.
195445	197287	Don't tell the wife about this one, or she's going to want you to buy this.
197307	197907	She doesn't care.
198208	198708	Oh, okay, good.
199349	199949	Why doesn't she care?
199969	201090	I thought she loved karaoke games.
201250	202151	Because I'm not going to buy them.
202511	203992	Oh, okay.
204093	204973	Did you affirm that?
205313	206655	Did you tell the wife you didn't want to buy them?
206675	211138	I told her I wouldn't buy them, and I told her that there was this coming out, and she's like, so?
211439	211799	So what?
212299	214523	I will not touch the singing portion of Rock Band
227701	233104	All we have to do is to, one night when you don't drive, we have to get you to drink a little bit and then you'll be good.
233144	235745	You, okay, you were at my bachelor party.
236005	237826	I was near, like, alcohol poisoning.
237846	239127	Which, by the way, is on YouTube.
239347	243029	If you want to see Loki driving Mario Kart drunk, just search for Orange Lounge Radio.
243069	243389	It's there.
243409	248311	Too bad we didn't have the rest of the stuff on there, like me playing miniature golf, but I still have the videos.
248371	250332	I still have the videos for that.
250512	254394	Anyways, though, but yeah, I was, you know, pretty sick and frustrated
254574	255415	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
276222	281706	It's $150 US and it's coming out with SingStar.
281746	283367	I'm trying to figure out which version of SingStar it is.
283387	292513	SingStar Pop is coming out in November and it's going to be a white PlayStation 2 to perfectly match your Wii if you are so inclined.
293013	294855	So enjoy that.
295135	296296	$150, not a bad deal for those two games.
296636	300278	It also, by the way, comes with a controller, a white controller, and two microphones.
300879	302900	So you're all set for a karaoke party with this.
303934	304975	If you're a SingStar fan.
305015	309418	I mean, I know some people prefer Karaoke Revolution, but it really isn't at all the same game in the end.
309478	312079	It's people making asses of themselves in front of their friends, right?
312780	312960	Yeah.
313220	313480	Alright.
314221	332392	We touched on this a little bit in Part A with the whole Manhunt 2 being re-rated thing, but Cinder Yee, Leland Yee from California, is actually on the record saying that he favors the adults-only rating and wishes that they allowed those to be played on consoles.
333013	333093	Um...
333795	334915	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
363965	365066	Thanks for watching!
388568	408980	It is kind of interesting that he supports, you know, the guy's been branded as this, you know, anti-video games guy, but I find it very interesting that he is, you know, actually supportive of, okay, the content can be out there, you know, I don't care if the AO content is out there, and in fact, we should have a place for it, but just not falling in children's laps or whatever.
409020	411402	We need to police it so that it doesn't get in children's laps.
411542	415344	He basically says, you know, it's the use of the ambiguous term mature that
415612	416132	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
435954	444323	They say whoever's going to win the HD, DVD, and Blu-ray war is going to be whatever system gets the most porn, is going to be what decides that war.
444523	455074	I mean, seriously, we're not banning adult DVDs out there, and I would think that that's a lot easier for kids to get a hold of than adult games.
455214	458878	I mean, but they need to get past the point that games are not just...
460006	461066	DarkSakura.com
483919	484620	Thank you for watching!
497273	498414	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
522131	523091	All of the monsters.
523131	523311	Yeah.
543817	545379	The nurses are the nurses from the movie, like, full on.
563271	564232	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
585529	612829	That cried when she was fighting one of the boss monsters in Silent Hill 3 I can't wait to get her to play this game because I'm evil and vindictive And I think it's going to be hilarious when the monsters start kicking down doors to get to her Yeah, she'll throw the controller down and run into a different room and cry And hopefully we'll have it all up on one of these video streaming sites for you to enjoy What you guys don't get about our friend though is like I'll go and pretend I'm one of the monsters I won't be dressed up or anything, I'll just walk like they were And she hates it and freaks out
613919	614399	So good.
614720	615741	Picaruno agrees.
615861	618483	I get so scared I can't even play Silent Hill.
618723	626970	The first Silent Hill, I'm sure I've mentioned this before, but when I tried to play it, I stopped it nine times at the very beginning because it was too scary.
627551	628912	That's just how great these games are.
629412	629773	Wow.
630613	631134	That's cool.
632075	634977	As Dartichia in our chatroom says, what a horrible night to have a curse.
635477	636138	Ha ha ha.
636238	636478	Funny.
637279	638900	Because it's a Castlevania reference.
638940	639341	Never mind.
639681	640562	I don't even get it.
640922	641423	Forget it.
641683	641763	Ugh.
643134	644414	That's all I have to say on Silent Hill.
644434	645735	I'm definitely looking forward to Silent Hill 5.
645775	646815	I looked at the same article too.
646855	648355	It looks like it's going to be pretty sweet.
648415	656237	Actually, let me ask real quick, Shane, since you're such a big fan of the series from before, are you looking forward to this?
656317	663059	I know that you were a little nervous when you heard it was going to a different developer and it's being developed outside Japan, but seeing kind of what they've done with it, are you looking forward to it?
663079	664479	Are you still a little nervous or what?
665039	665740	I'm still nervous.
665780	671421	The screenshots are good looking, but that doesn't tell you how the game plays or if the story is really good or
672133	682019	If they have the elements that make it Silent Hill in the game or not, it could just be like, I don't know, they could have made a really nice looking, what's that crappy game called?
682920	688543	The one where you were all the teenagers in the school and all the plant monsters were obscure or something like that.
689284	690745	Why are you shaking your head at me a lot?
690805	693748	Nothing, I'm just... Oh, yeah, it could be like that.
693788	696550	That could look really pretty, but it could be a terrible game like that game was.
696850	697551	So, I don't know.
697591	701915	I hope, but... Maybe the liquor is just starting to kick in, so I'm just nodding a little more than usual.
702335	702695	Okay.
703376	703756	Maybe.
704077	704457	Maybe.
704877	705318	Maybe.
705398	705758	All right.
706358	706879	I'm done.
706959	707559	Next story.
708480	715466	Anywho, so one game I'm not too excited about, LocoRoco for the PS3.
716067	717148	It's been dated for...
718630	721572	Release in Japan on the PlayStation Network September 21st.
722733	724754	And no price is announced yet.
725115	734201	It's, um, looks like Odeo Loco Roco Boo Boo Coco Reco or something.
734221	734561	I don't know.
735122	742607	All you need to know is that it's... Wait, Loco Roco Boo Goo Coco for Coco Puff Roco Boco is what it is.
743038	752865	What it probably means is, ha ha, they don't know that it's just an interactive screensaver, you fucktards, and you're going to pay money for this, thinking it's a real game, and ha ha, we screw you over again.
754166	757829	No, that's exactly... Roco, Roco, Cuckoo, Boco, fucktard.
758790	759130	Is that it?
759630	762192	Basically, the game is an interactive screensaver.
762232	768377	You will be able to use the six axis to tilt the little crocos around, but that's about it.
769645	770786	So, hooray!
771186	774267	Thank you for yet another awesome game, Sony.
774487	775328	You rock.
775388	777629	Do you think LocoRoco just jumped the shark with this?
779230	785733	I think it's just, why even bother calling this a game or even have to purchase it if it's, you know...
787082	787782	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
816201	818803	Have a nice day, but enjoy the dirt demo.
818863	821566	It's a pretty looking game, but I couldn't control it at all.
821986	823307	But it's just not my kind of racing game.
823487	824868	That's just me, I guess.
827070	834416	Anyways, one other game that you probably won't see over in the UK also is being developed by Homeland Security in the US.
835157	843804	They are developing a game, of course, I guess, I don't know, something where you, of course, defending the United States from terrorists.
844264	845125	And they've spent...
845972	847397	$600,000 of funding Ground Truth
851491	857133	It's a game that would, I guess, cast players in the first responders to a terrorist attack or natural disasters.
857693	864435	Thank you, Homeland Security, for spending our money on a game instead of protecting the homeland.
864535	867576	Is this a free download thing for PCs, or is this like a Flash game?
867616	868297	What the hell is this?
868357	869617	It's just something that's being developed.
869657	872558	It's not even done yet, so we don't know if it's going to be free or whatnot.
872718	873178	Interesting.
873238	875679	What do they hope to accomplish with a game like this, I wonder?
875859	878520	Wouldn't it be funny if the terrorists played it instead?
878880	880121	It would probably be to build on the...
881570	887914	You know, I don't know, build on the success that, say, America's Army had?
888475	892998	I was just thinking of America's Army, and even Jonathan F. in our chatroom says America's Army was free.
894619	896140	Dark Tetsuya says Shane went there.
896880	898941	How did I not go there, seriously?
898961	905926	I guess the game is being developed by Sandia National Labs with grad students from University of Southern California doing the graphics work.
907627	908007	Interesting.
908428	908728	So...
910311	913332	Stop spending government money on this crap, seriously.
913652	914972	You don't need a fucking game.
915272	918133	You don't see the Department of Transportation saying, we want a game.
918813	920794	Or, you know, God knows what else.
921594	924735	They should have like a Bush PR campaign game or something.
925255	927256	Interesting point from Escapist in our chatroom.
927636	934478	That may seem like an expensive game to make, but keep in mind King's Quest cost $700,000 when it first came out all those years ago.
935868	936288	Hmm.
936828	937188	Oh, great.
937248	942949	So they're going to waste a lot of money building this game and it's going to suck.
942989	944230	That's awesome.
944590	947130	Wait, you're not trying to say King's Quest sucks, does it?
947150	948951	Because King's Quest is one of the greatest games ever made.
948971	950471	King's Quest is fucking old.
950611	952932	So it's old, but it's great.
953272	957353	Well, back in the day, $700,000 was probably a lot of money.
957413	964094	Nowadays, production costs have gone up due to the wonderful systems and graphics that we have and have come to love.
964234	964374	So,
965413	968919	Back in the day, it was EGA graphics.
969160	973026	All fucking 16 colors of wonderful goodness.
973748	973948	All right.
974795	977076	The Virginia Tech Massacre Review Panel has released their report.
999586	1015509	and it does show that there is no link between video games and the murders that were committed by the culprit actually the only game that is even mentioned in the report is Sonic the Hedgehog now I would fail to see where Sonic the Hedgehog is going to provoke violent gaming
1016362	1024310	Unless he went and played the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 version of the game, which the controls were horrible and could drive someone to kill people.
1024470	1028814	Anyway, there was in the report, quote, So this is a big screw you to all those people that were so quick to...
1039384	1041026	to blame video games when this happened.
1041426	1046570	So the Jack Voldemorts of the world and Dr. Phil's and so on.
1047091	1050473	So to you folks, we dedicate a very special segment this week to you.
1061262	1062483	It's our FUs of the week.
1063444	1065426	Loki, why don't you start us off with your FU of the week?
1066161	1068623	My FU of the week goes to the Lifetime channel.
1068783	1072245	I don't like you, and I don't see the point.
1074967	1075327	That's it?
1076668	1082152	And to the director of that stupid movie that I had to watch today, learn how to light a fucking movie.
1082552	1086815	Otherwise you're going to be stuck making shit on Lifetime.
1087075	1091959	First off, I'd like to give an FU to Loki for not enjoying the greatness of his Lifetime movies, because I love Lifetime movies.
1092779	1095281	I'd also like to give an FU to Getting Sick.
1096149	1103334	When I was traveling this week, the only thing worse than having to travel and be gone for four days is getting sick while you're gone and bringing that back with you.
1103434	1104535	That really stinks.
1106536	1107277	And then I guess that's it.
1107297	1110559	I can't really think of anything else this week, so that's all my FUs.
1111140	1113261	Shane, Miklatov, whatever your name is, any FUs?
1113661	1113841	No.
1115122	1115342	No?
1115923	1117144	You're happy about everything?
1117464	1119665	No, but I can't think of anything to give a FU to.
1119706	1120606	Everything's perfect?
1120646	1121747	You're not angry at anything?
1123068	1123168	No.
1123544	1125585	Well, F you to you being so darn mellow.
1125785	1126566	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
1126946	1129488	F you to Blue Dragon because it sucks.
1130228	1130688	There we go.
1131149	1131829	F you to you.
1131849	1134090	Do you even know why you hate Blue Dragon?
1134130	1134330	Yes.
1134350	1134631	Why?
1134651	1136212	The combat is boring.
1136412	1137112	Combat is awesome.
1137132	1138453	The game is dull looking.
1138533	1139053	You're dull looking.
1139073	1144777	It looks like a generic RPG that could have been made by any company ever.
1145437	1152101	That I actually, you know, unfortunately there's not a lot that sets this apart from another RPG except for the fact it's on the 360 and it's pretty.
1152951	1155191	The character models even look pretty bland.
1155471	1156152	The music's good.
1156852	1159632	No, because those boss fights have terrible, terrible songs.
1159652	1160912	The boss fight song's awesome.
1161092	1161493	No.
1162453	1163433	Worst game.
1163453	1166313	The boss fight song is a vocal rock song, which is pretty rad.
1166473	1168014	Don't listen to what Shane says.
1168314	1169694	No, listen to what I say.
1169914	1170254	No, don't.
1170514	1171274	Alright, back to the news.
1172014	1180696	Anyways, Castlevania, the wonderful game that's going to become a movie, yay, is now being completely rewritten.
1181243	1184864	Yes, they've thrown out the script and are going back to the drawing boards.
1211593	1213815	because that's super awesome and I know you wouldn't miss it.
1215797	1217278	And so he's working on the script now.
1217958	1231049	His take on it, I guess, and of course the new director, Sylvan White, says, I was attracted by the chance to make a dark, epic period movie that almost has an anime feel to it.
1232650	1237815	So... Let's hope and pray that it doesn't suck.
1238255	1239116	And unfortunately...
1241974	1248177	Passed track records of moving games have not been... My magic 8-ball says, signs do not look good.
1249577	1250177	Does not look good.
1250878	1252518	Loki, comment from the chatroom here.
1252738	1254119	Did you like the band Deep Purple?
1255019	1256120	Are you familiar with the band at all?
1256220	1256700	Deep Purple?
1257620	1259601	The one that did Smoke on the Water?
1259621	1260982	Yeah, no, actually, I gotta ask Shane this.
1261062	1262282	Do you know the band Deep Purple?
1263223	1265124	Yes, because Smoke on the Water.
1265564	1269225	The lead singer of Deep Purple is the guy that sings the song in Blue Dragon.
1269345	1270906	No wonder it sounds bad.
1272526	1272866	Press Start
1295086	1296827	It's not a documentary, however.
1297687	1300888	This is a quote from the little synopsis of the movie.
1301428	1307010	Zach Nimbus is a typical suburban youth and volunteer monster exterminator living peacefully in a video game world.
1307450	1316533	It's a realm where people actually do cross rivers by jumping across alligators' heads or being chomped to death in the attempt, and where injuries can be cured by eating food laying around in old hallways.
1316993	1324416	Here, the pleasant days are ending due to world conquest by the unspeakably evil but insecure and telephone-addicted wizard Count Nefarious Vile.
1325427	1346356	Zaxxum finds himself recruited by battle-hardened space soldier Sam and enthusiastically bad-tempered ninja Lin Ku I'm thinking they're supposed to be like Samus, but they can't use the exact names to join a last desperate attempt to thwart Vile's imminent victory but not before lampooning every video game convention that comes in their way
1346796	1352417	So apparently this is going to be some type of little live action movie that parodies all these other video games.
1352657	1353317	Here's the thing, though.
1353357	1358878	If you think this is like some huge production that's putting this out, this movie looks like it cost about $20 to make.
1359218	1361059	So don't be expecting a big budget production.
1361139	1363799	But, hey, you know, just because it has no budget doesn't mean it can't be good.
1363999	1367140	Coming to a senior project presentation near you.
1367300	1367860	For real.
1368300	1372641	Or it's like one of those Lionsgate little films direct to video or something.
1373811	1375572	Film Class Final near you.
1375612	1376672	Direct to VHS.
1376733	1377713	It's not even coming out on DVD.
1377733	1380814	I'm going to have to peddle this crap later on.
1380874	1381274	I know it.
1381474	1384716	There is a trailer available, by the way, which you can watch on YouTube.
1384736	1387917	If you just look for Press Start the Movie, there's actually a trailer.
1388077	1391279	We're actually looking at it in the studio right now if you want to kind of check this out here.
1391319	1396441	Would you mind telling me what you were doing with these?
1399582	1401683	Don't forget what I did to you.
1404304	1405324	Your brother.
1408585	1414687	In a world ruled by an evil sorcerer, two rebels seek a hero.
1414947	1416328	It's dangerous to go out alone.
1416668	1417188	Take this.
1417568	1420369	Foretold by an ancient prophecy.
1421149	1422810	Whose ancient prophecy?
1423290	1424530	An ancient prophet's.
1427811	1429712	This looks like that Cheerleader Ninjas movie.
1429912	1430372	Oh, right.
1431125	1433486	I love LARPing, let's make it into a movie!
1433526	1436548	Heads up, guys!
1436948	1437868	Why'd you let him hit you?
1438269	1438949	It was his turn.
1439409	1441630	On September 25th... Batten down the hatches!
1441910	1443451	Rile up the mechanical dinosaurs!
1443911	1444952	It won't be a game.
1445692	1447733	Congratulations, you've just leveled up.
1448334	1449574	Because it's a movie.
1449934	1454577	Did you see the graphics on that tree thing there?
1454697	1455817	That was crazy.
1456457	1459399	Those fools have no idea what horrors await them!
1461454	1462375	Thanks for watching!
1487114	1488315	Well, it's working.
1488355	1491577	We talked about it on our program, and it was on a lot of major game blogs.
1491597	1496201	There was that funny part in the thing, though, about that it was his turn to attack.
1496221	1496601	I like that.
1496621	1497522	So it was like an RPG.
1497542	1498362	That was funny.
1499783	1503146	Come on, if you could sit through that Cheerleader Ninjas, I'm sure you could make it through this movie, Loki.
1503186	1505107	Cheerleader Ninjas had nudity in it.
1505948	1506408	This might.
1506428	1507009	You never know.
1507069	1508229	Yeah, that's true.
1508269	1509490	There could be nudity in this movie.
1509530	1510431	Direct-to-DVD.
1510491	1512132	For artistic purposes.
1512693	1514434	No, they don't have the budget for nudity.
1515865	1517507	And would you really want to see any of them naked?
1517687	1518087	I don't know.
1518128	1518588	I don't think so.
1519189	1524435	Anyhow, what we're going to do is we're going to open up the Skype line because it's time to play Beat the Host.
1531524	1533025	Oh, I love that song.
1533045	1534166	Let's just listen to that.
1557732	1558233	Here we go.
1558393	1561235	We're going to take our first call on the Skype line.
1561255	1565197	Again, our username is Orange Launch Radio or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
1565218	1565498	Here we go.
1565518	1566018	We got a call.
1567419	1568320	Hello, who's this?
1568340	1569340	That always gets through.
1569701	1570241	GS68.
1570381	1571202	Hi, GS68.
1571382	1572523	No, it's not Raven's Dolphin tonight.
1572563	1573003	It's GS68.
1573043	1573563	Hey, GS68.
1573603	1574424	Hooray.
1574524	1575505	How you doing, GS68?
1575945	1576305	All right.
1576906	1578827	Are you ready to play some Beat the Host tonight?
1579668	1579908	Yeah.
1580168	1580408	All right.
1580428	1580888	I'll give it a shot.
1581129	1585892	Now, how would you say your knowledge of old school or new school video game music is?
1587989	1588349	All right.
1589029	1592552	Well, you sound very enthusiastic about your chances in tonight's Beat the Host.
1593452	1593752	All right.
1594093	1596254	Tonight you can challenge to beat the host.
1596274	1600197	I'm not going to let you play against Shane because he already kind of knows what's going on tonight.
1601137	1603119	I know, but I never get to play.
1603179	1604620	He's just going to pick Matt.
1604660	1606261	Everybody picks Matt anyway.
1606321	1607862	It's not even like they have to ask.
1607942	1609923	If I let you pick, you'd probably pick Matt, wouldn't you?
1610984	1614086	What would be wrong with challenging you?
1615223	1616940	You can't challenge me because I wrote the questions.
1617492	1619873	Video Game Music Songs Being Played Backwards
1645407	1645727	Okay?
1646047	1646588	Oh, God.
1646908	1655071	Now, these could be songs anywhere from an 8-bit Atari era all the way through new school Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 games.
1655431	1655711	Okay?
1656211	1659993	If things drag on, I will give you guys hints to help you guess the game.
1660053	1661354	First one to get it gets the point.
1661654	1661894	Alright?
1661934	1662694	So you guys know how to play?
1662714	1663915	I'm ready.
1664135	1665655	Alright, so you guys are going to go at the same time.
1665935	1669657	GS68, make sure you yell out your answers nice and loud so I can hear you over the music, okay?
1670296	1671517	It has to leave the chat room, right?
1671657	1675779	Yes, you do need to leave the chat room, or else people are going to help you cheat, and we can't have that.
1676719	1676919	All right.
1676939	1677059	Okay?
1677859	1678120	All right.
1681081	1681361	All right.
1681921	1682562	Is he out of chat?
1682722	1683762	Okay, you left the chat room, GS68?
1683942	1684142	Yeah.
1685063	1687284	Okay, now remember, you don't have to send me a private message or anything.
1687324	1690305	Just yell it out when you know it, because you're up against Matt in real time, okay?
1690325	1691185	Okay.
1691205	1692326	So I'm going to keep score here.
1693618	1694578	There should be buzzers.
1695018	1696379	There should be, but we don't have any.
1696399	1698339	We're a low-budget production.
1698359	1698939	Okay, here we go.
1699219	1702760	Here's song number one, and the first one that gets it gets a point.
1702780	1704600	And remember, these are being played backwards.
1705701	1705981	Okay.
1716783	1717663	What's that, GS68?
1718483	1720904	I've heard this on the Olar stream, but I can't put my finger on it.
1720924	1721284	Keep going.
1726038	1727438	This game was on the Dreamcast.
1751870	1753851	To me, it sounded like a song from Lupin the Third.
1754151	1754591	Exactly.
1754651	1756112	See, it's kind of along the same lines.
1756132	1756532	All right.
1756552	1761054	Well, Loki has a point, but GS68, there's ten songs tonight, so all is not lost.
1761075	1762035	You ready for song number two?
1762735	1762835	Yep.
1762855	1763236	All right.
1763256	1763596	Here we go.
1768858	1769479	Animal Crossing.
1769859	1770359	Ooh!
1771279	1772240	Loki's on fire!
1773000	1774541	GS68, did you even hear any of that?
1775859	1777500	Yeah, couldn't recognize it.
1777620	1780662	It was Animal Crossing, the little drum tap, little quiet stuff.
1780702	1781663	Yes, it was Animal Crossing.
1781683	1782884	Good job, Loki.
1782944	1783784	Played the game way too much.
1783804	1784625	All right, here we go.
1784665	1785185	Here's another one.
1785245	1787887	Remember, these could be from any system, new school or old school.
1788227	1788527	Here we go.
1788567	1789108	Here's number three.
1793010	1793371	Luminous.
1795812	1798854	Oh, GS68 knew that one, too.
1799615	1799935	That's right.
1799955	1801336	That was Shinin' from Luminous.
1801897	1802718	Damn, Loki, you're on fire.
1802738	1804319	That sounded so evil backwards.
1804399	1805219	It did sound like it.
1805520	1807181	You want to hear a little more?
1807201	1812844	You want to hear a little more?
1812885	1813805	I like it backwards.
1815126	1816927	I want an MP3 of it backwards now.
1817288	1819029	I can send you an MP3 of it backwards if you want.
1819209	1819869	That'd be cool.
1819989	1820370	All right.
1821050	1822531	All right, GS68, it's 3-0.
1822671	1824532	All right.
1824592	1826234	You got to make some progress here, okay?
1826954	1827194	All right.
1827935	1828755	We're pulling for you, though.
1828795	1829136	Here we go.
1829956	1830577	Here's number four.
1830597	1830697	Ready?
1830937	1831137	Ready?
1846829	1847930	This game was on the NES.
1849671	1850372	Master Master?
1850872	1851032	No.
1851412	1852193	Super Contra?
1852373	1852553	No.
1852833	1853374	Contra?
1853734	1853894	No.
1854535	1855075	Are they a legend?
1856396	1856856	What'd you say?
1856876	1858057	Are they a legend?
1858437	1859218	No, it's not got any legends.
1864406	1865967	This game had a character named Ryu.
1867868	1868308	Ninja Gaiden.
1869529	1869929	Oh!
1870390	1871030	Loki got it.
1871871	1874232	Needed a couple clues to get it, but it was Ninja Gaiden.
1874913	1875793	Stage 1 music.
1877214	1878615	GS68's not looking good.
1880116	1882377	Sorry to say, but try to get some points on the board, okay?
1882397	1883518	We're all pulling for you, alright?
1884919	1885099	Yep.
1885299	1888841	Alright, I'll bust Loki's kneecaps so he has a challenge in some of these later ones.
1888861	1889281	Okay, you ready?
1889301	1890922	Okay, here we go.
1890962	1891663	Here comes song number 5.
1892423	1892804	You ready, GS68?
1892844	1892944	Okay.
1894096	1894556	You can do it.
1899801	1900422	Act Freezer.
1900502	1900862	Sonic!
1901122	1901343	No.
1901503	1901763	Yes!
1902739	1903840	GS68 got one.
1903860	1905302	Wow.
1905342	1906323	What was it?
1906563	1908244	I think the roof came off his house.
1908284	1908905	It was Sonic.
1909706	1910787	Oh, that's right.
1910867	1913149	I thought he yelled a bad word.
1914270	1915812	That is what you said, right, GS68?
1916392	1916653	Yes.
1917413	1924860	That's what I heard, but he did it in that old... I think it was an allusion to the old Sega commercials when he yelled it out.
1924880	1927323	Or he just really wanted to win.
1928552	1930032	That was the bonus stage in Sonic.
1930293	1931133	The bonus stage music.
1931253	1932094	Yeah, I recognize it now.
1932394	1932634	All right.
1933334	1933614	All right.
1934015	1934255	Good.
1934295	1935836	I'm so glad to see you get on the board, GS68.
1935876	1936296	All right.
1936316	1937557	Here we go into the next question.
1937617	1940418	Question number six, I believe this one is.
1940458	1940779	Here we go.
1944421	1947362	Parappa the Rapper.
1947382	1947422	Oh.
1948203	1950364	Mere seconds splitting it up.
1950404	1953306	I could hear GS68 start to say it as Loki got it out.
1953346	1954446	It was Parappa the Rapper.
1955487	1955747	All right.
1955787	1956988	This next one's a little bit tougher.
1957574	1958554	GS68, you ready?
1960515	1961536	Ready for the next one, GS68?
1962256	1962456	Yes.
1962736	1963296	Okay, here we go.
1964977	1965798	This is on the 360.
1965838	1965998	Crap.
1988647	1989327	and the PC.
1992409	1992909	Not that one yet.
1994150	2000113	Come on, I guess.
2000754	2000954	No.
2002434	2003495	This is a role-playing game.
2005616	2006417	Final Fantasy XI?
2006777	2007757	No.
2007857	2008217	Oblivion.
2008598	2009938	Yes, finally.
2010038	2010579	Jesus.
2011139	2011539	Sorry.
2011559	2012240	Took long enough.
2012740	2013520	Yes, it was Oblivion.
2014501	2014781	All right.
2016584	2023127	Well, it looks like Loki has six, so there's no possible way you're going to be able to win GS68, but keep playing just for the fun of it, okay?
2023407	2023647	All right.
2023667	2024828	All right, we're going to get through the rest of this.
2024848	2025208	Here we go.
2025468	2026108	Here comes the next one.
2029970	2030470	Contra.
2031071	2031271	No.
2031351	2032191	No, it's Castlevania.
2033992	2034833	Castlevania IV.
2035753	2036333	No.
2037234	2037874	Symphony of the Night.
2038494	2038894	No.
2040415	2041396	Castlevania III.
2041936	2042336	No.
2042396	2043917	Dracula X. GS68.
2043937	2043977	No.
2045851	2046712	He just gave up.
2047272	2048874	Castlevania 2 Science Quest.
2048994	2050335	Finally, Jesus Christ.
2050375	2051356	I had to go through all of them.
2053117	2058102	GS68, you should have jumped in there when his weak point was exposed for massive damage.
2058142	2059823	You could have jumped in there with number two.
2059883	2060884	You don't know it.
2061205	2061545	All right.
2062786	2063246	Here we go.
2064227	2065108	Here comes number nine.
2065949	2068651	Now, I'm going to say I think this was the hardest one in the whole bunch.
2068731	2070713	If either one of you can get this, props to you.
2071614	2071794	All right.
2083564	2086626	This game was also on the 360 and PC.
2092110	2093271	Fantasy Star Universe?
2093351	2093571	No.
2096533	2096993	Final Fantasy 11?
2098174	2098634	What was that?
2099355	2100155	Final Fantasy 11?
2100275	2100455	No.
2106439	2109982	This game was the same composer who did the music to Oblivion.
2110582	2110802	Blair?
2110842	2110882	No.
2111543	2111663	No.
2118632	2121274	The story of this game has to do with alien abduction.
2124656	2125256	What was that, GS68?
2125296	2128899	I was going to say Alien Syndrome, but I forgot that's not on the PC.
2129379	2129980	Oh, God.
2130000	2132641	I know the game, but I just can't think of the name.
2132982	2136884	This game is notable for featuring a Native American lead character.
2137725	2138045	Prey.
2138705	2140687	Yes, GS68, finally.
2140747	2141707	It was on the tip of my tongue.
2141928	2142928	Yes, it's Prey.
2143629	2144689	All right, good job.
2146050	2146531	Good job, GS68.
2146571	2148032	I knew the game, I just couldn't think of the name.
2148272	2148532	All right.
2149724	2150444	Let's move on.
2151645	2152886	Ready for the last one, you guys?
2153346	2153566	Yes.
2153726	2154107	Here it is.
2157829	2158770	Chance and Revolution?
2159370	2159870	Yes.
2161631	2162352	That was Butterfly.
2164193	2164993	Yes, Loki.
2165073	2165594	All right.
2167055	2170897	Wow, GS68, you got smoked tonight, I'm sorry to say.
2171818	2172938	The score is 8-2.
2173038	2175760	Did you just say GG?
2176440	2176741	Yes.
2176861	2178442	Yes, GG, Loki, GG.
2180293	2180613	GG.
2180853	2184715	Well, I'm sorry, GS68, you lost tonight, but it's our consolation prize.
2185255	2187876	We'll give you a second to plug anything you want to plug real quick.
2189237	2191058	I don't have anything to plug.
2191878	2192579	Oh, I'm sorry to hear it.
2193519	2193779	All right.
2194119	2195780	Well, thanks for playing anyway, GS68.
2195800	2196440	We appreciate it.
2197221	2197421	Rob.
2197801	2198061	All right.
2198101	2198581	Later, dude.
2200222	2200962	Good job, Loki.
2201823	2204744	You know, isn't that game unfair to the listener?
2205124	2205504	Why is that?
2205744	2206985	Because there's a time delay.
2207005	2207085	Okay.
2207726	2211727	Um, no, because when they're on Skype, it's still instantaneous.
2212587	2212727	Oh.
2213088	2218249	Yeah, there's only the time delay if they're listening over live 365, but they shouldn't be doing that when they're playing that.
2219389	2219849	All right.
2220970	2222510	Looking at chat and seeing what's going on.
2222970	2224871	Zappy says, that was a hard beat to host tonight.
2225291	2226871	Goldbanjo thinks the last one was easy.
2226971	2229212	Well, if you're a DDR nerd, then the last one was easy, so there you go.
2230953	2232413	Alright, let's get back into some gaming news.
2232453	2233373	That's it for Beat the Host tonight.
2233393	2235874	If you guys like those games or other games like it, send us an email.
2235894	2239795	Mailbag at OrangeHouseRadio.com We're looking for ideas for new games, by the way.
2240315	2242135	So, just wanted to put that out there.
2244135	2245896	Alright, let's get back into the gaming news.
2246396	2247256	Loki, take it away.
2247676	2248016	Sorry.
2248256	2252277	Anyways, so yeah, there's some interesting stuff.
2252877	2254297	Now, this is really interesting.
2254637	2257718	Nokia has unveiled the Engage gaming platform.
2257758	2258898	You now remember that
2259286	2269011	They are not making any more gaming systems, but their new Nokia phones, of course, are going to be supporting the brand new gaming platform, which looks okay.
2269111	2277775	They've got a few people on board already, including Electronic Arts, Capcom, and Vividi, and they've got some other exclusive games as well.
2278604	2290488	and it will be compatible with the Nokia models N73, N81, N93 and N95 and with more S60 models to be compatible at a later date.
2291169	2306254	So I guess the games right now, they're going to be free to demo but will cost between 6 and 10 euros to play or buy the full version and feature online play against friends or of course random people via the N-Gage Arena.
2306957	2309218	which I kept trying to get me to walk into during E3.
2309418	2317020	The Engage Arena at the last E3 that was a real E3 was pretty swanky.
2317600	2319801	Yeah, they actually had a really nice booth the last E3 I remember.
2319821	2322962	Too bad it was a piece of crap product, but it was still a nice booth.
2325543	2326623	Well, what do you think of this news?
2326683	2328004	I mean, I don't think this is so bad.
2328044	2329524	I think it's kind of neat.
2329884	2332425	I think it's much better than the Engage's actual system was.
2332765	2333065	Yeah.
2333646	2334806	There you go.
2336966	2342770	Alright, well, let's move on to the next story, which is about a new PC demo.
2342870	2344111	Other things you can do with your PC.
2344571	2345291	Crysis.
2345792	2349394	Crysis is getting a PC demo on September 25th, 2007.
2350535	2354597	But the one thing about that day you should also keep in mind, that's the same day that Halo 3 comes out.
2355258	2357499	So, something to keep in mind.
2357539	2359380	Well, a lot of people are anticipating this game.
2359400	2361462	It's a big first-person shooter for the PC.
2361942	2366205	So if you want to take that PC versus console gaming to a whole new level, there you have it.
2366604	2368705	Thank you to the folks behind Crysis for doing this.
2369085	2370185	So, funny.
2371346	2371606	All right.
2371746	2372466	Go EA.
2374127	2374627	Let's see.
2374847	2379669	Also, there is a new game, or I should say an older game that is free now.
2380109	2384351	Command & Conquer, the Gold Edition, is free to download.
2385011	2390753	And you can download it actually off of, I believe, the official Command & Conquer website.
2391573	2392714	So that's pretty awesome.
2393034	2395715	And I guess it's going to be...
2396544	2400729	They're also featuring Command & Conquer Strategy for the month of September.
2402911	2403872	What do you mean by strategy?
2403912	2405394	Like free strategy guys or something?
2405474	2405835	Yeah.
2406515	2407316	Huh.
2408037	2415586	I guess it's an ISO image, so you'd have to burn it to a CD, but that's pretty awesome, though.
2415826	2416847	Command & Conquer is a cool game.
2417107	2417588	That's pretty cool.
2418585	2425150	Anyhow, another PC game that is free and has been free for quite a while, MapleStory, is getting an update.
2425471	2427732	I know some of you guys out there like to play this game, MapleStory.
2428293	2432876	It's a free MMO that's available out there, and there's some brand new stuff being added to the game.
2433177	2437700	The mountain village of Mulung is being added as well as... Mulan?
2437840	2439562	No, Mulung, not Mulan.
2440242	2442264	And a new town called Herbtown.
2442804	2443665	I like the herbs.
2443885	2446487	Yeah, like, you know, let's go smoke a joint, man.
2446968	2447528	Or maybe not.
2448461	2451142	Those are being added to MapleStory this week, so check that out.
2452222	2457043	I should also say that Mulong features a salon where players can buy new hairstyles.
2457443	2459184	That's a feature coming to WoW pretty soon, right?
2459664	2460524	Yes, I can't wait.
2460984	2462565	You love to customize hair.
2462585	2464045	You've been looking for a new MMO to play.
2464065	2465305	Why haven't you been playing MapleStory?
2465685	2467866	Because I've tried it before and I thought it was a piece of crap.
2468086	2469246	Why did you think it was a piece of crap?
2469306	2470086	It was boring.
2470126	2473167	I didn't understand what I was doing and my character was ugly.
2473847	2475848	I don't play ugly characters.
2477193	2484219	Let's see, Herbtown, by the way, includes new monsters to fight, but no word yet if you can actually score some herbs in Herbtown.
2485080	2504055	Well, following Lost Planet and, I guess, Ghost Recon releasing some map packs for free, Gears of War, the map pack that's been available so far, the Hidden Fronts map pack is going to be available for free as well, starting in September.
2504853	2506274	Actually, tomorrow at 2 a.m.
2506654	2508656	is going to be when it's going to be available, September 3rd.
2509436	2515560	And you can get four maps that are included with that, including Bullet Marsh, Garden, Process, and Subway.
2516180	2517181	So that's not bad.
2517321	2518182	Free is always good.
2520663	2522184	Hooray for free aids.
2523365	2526467	I notice there's a lot of people online that aren't playing Gears of War anymore.
2526487	2527267	I wonder why that is.
2527808	2531450	I guess it's just because there's all these other Xbox 360 games capturing people's attention now, but
2531909	2537152	Seems like Gears of War was a big thing not that long ago, and now I barely see people on my friends list playing that game anymore.
2537892	2540073	Maybe these free maps will breathe some life back into it.
2540093	2540513	What do you think?
2541814	2547557	I doubt it, because they've been available for a while now, so I figured if people wanted them, they would have already bought them.
2548962	2556744	Well, now there's been a lot of stories going around about how the 60 gigabyte PlayStation 3 is officially no more, that they completely sold out.
2557604	2564606	But Sony would like you to know that they have replenished their PlayStation 3 supply of 60 gigabyte PlayStation 3s on SonyStyle.com.
2565887	2570368	Just because they were on back order at one point, they are now back in stock.
2570928	2574629	So there's no official word if the 60 gigabytes are officially gone or not.
2575189	2580952	That actually makes sense to me because Sony-style store, whatever it's called, is not Sony Inc.
2581432	2582013	You know what I mean?
2582053	2583473	Like, it's just another store.
2583894	2587856	Like any other GameStop or whatever, it just happens to be run by Sony.
2588176	2589196	So of course they're going to run out.
2589236	2590577	It doesn't mean the whole supply is gone.
2591057	2600582	So, it doesn't mean... I mean, this isn't really a whole lot of big news to me, but just to kind of stop the doom and gloom that was going around about, oh, the 60 gigs are gone, they're gone forever, and so on.
2602463	2603663	One of these days I'll buy a PlayStation 3.
2604204	2604684	One of these days.
2605649	2607390	All right, one of these days there'll be games for it.
2609071	2612372	All right, well, and I own a PS3 and I'm kind of disappointed.
2612712	2616974	Luckily, though, in October, though, I'm looking forward to Ratchet & Clank.
2617095	2621337	I'm actually going to skip out on buying Lair and skip on Heavenly Sword.
2621357	2623598	Oh, Lair's been getting some crap reviews, though.
2623638	2624058	I'm kind of...
2625117	2629559	I have a last minute story too about Lair, so let me ask you.
2651019	2654021	While we wait for those calls, I'll go to Loki real quick for any last-minute stories.
2654821	2659023	Real quick, you can play Lair on your PSP via remote play.
2659603	2661424	Ooh, gimmicky.
2662725	2664245	Wait, you can play the whole game on your PSP?
2664265	2669708	Well, most of it, because the PSP lacks, of course, a second R2 and L2 buttons.
2670008	2670348	Interesting.
2670368	2671229	Well, let's go to the phones.
2671249	2672209	We're getting some calls now.
2673090	2674070	I'll come back to that in a minute.
2674110	2675231	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2675271	2675611	Who's this?
2676863	2678924	You're getting a special phone call.
2679384	2680944	I'm getting a special phone call?
2680964	2681404	Who's this?
2681924	2683085	You're getting a special phone call.
2683145	2683725	It's Jason.
2684185	2684825	Hi, Jason.
2684905	2685585	I knew you were Jason.
2685665	2687306	Off again, listener whenever possible.
2687486	2690847	But our always constant webmaster, and we appreciate you for that.
2692027	2692267	Always.
2692487	2692727	Always.
2693507	2697889	I just made you introduce yourself because not all the podcast people know folks by their voice.
2697929	2698789	What's on your mind, Jason?
2700709	2702910	I was just going to say that...
2704002	2716553	If anybody remembers, anybody here that actually listens to all games, they'll probably remember how much of a Wii proponent I was back in the day, the month or so, whenever it was coming up on the show, the month or so before it came out.
2717634	2725840	They might also remember that on the forums I mentioned something about me having a feeling that the Wiis might finally be generally available come springtime.
2726681	2727582	I was wrong on that one.
2728174	2728434	Watch!
2728494	2728654	Watch!
2728674	2728814	Watch!
2754378	2755078	Weebot1.
2755439	2757700	Hooray!
2757820	2761582	I am now officially a member of the Wee60 camp, as it were.
2761942	2763142	Wee!
2764583	2766604	What games did you get with your Wii?
2767325	2769245	We got... I don't even remember.
2769286	2778010	We got WarioWare Smooth Moves, we got Trauma Center, we got Mario Party 8, we got Resident Evil 4 Wii, and I'm missing one...
2779927	2787829	Yes, that's right, the bust-and-move for Wii version that the screenshots looked absolutely ridiculous, but it's probably going to be a load of fun.
2788169	2789149	Wow, very cool.
2789169	2792010	The only thing you're missing is Metroid Prime, because that game is pretty awesome.
2793070	2806674	I was looking at that, and I really did like the DS version, with the exception that I always played it when I was tired, so I played so little of it, and when it comes to escaping the planet, I'm way too tired to comprehend where I'm supposed to go, and
2807285	2810886	The 3D map isn't exactly intuitive when you're so dead tired.
2811967	2813987	But I'm holding off on that for now.
2814047	2818069	Not to mention we picked up a points card, so I'm going to be grabbing a few virtual console things.
2819189	2826191	And given the 360, given that, given everything else, I'm going to have more than enough to suffice me for, well, maybe about a week.
2826271	2828372	But, you know, I didn't want to buy too many things.
2828472	2831433	And you're adding me to your friends codes list very soon, aren't you?
2832586	2848055	of course, I'm going to go through the thread and get just about everybody probably everybody, I'm not biased and then I'll of course be throwing mine in there and we'll continue on from there very cool, well congratulations on finally getting a Wii so are you still as much of a proponent for the Wii as you were nine months ago?
2849396	2858762	I've never stopped, it's just a general availability thing coupled with money kind of thing and we get to thank the lovely Rai Chan for all that because she's actually the one that made this all possible
2859484	2861885	She's making faces at me saying, oh, me this, me that.
2861925	2864406	Yeah, you're the one that did it.
2864666	2868467	I thought I heard Rai in the background, so tell her hello from all of us here at OLR.
2868487	2871788	Everybody at OLR says hello.
2872248	2873448	She says hello.
2873488	2875489	Well, you kids have fun with your weave and not too much.
2877350	2882991	Well, I'm on call tomorrow, but I'm generally off as long as nothing actually happens.
2883091	2884772	I have all day to myself to play.
2885217	2885617	All right.
2886038	2889099	Well, try to stay off while you're playing with your Wii.
2891561	2892462	I'll try my best.
2892542	2892842	All right.
2892882	2893482	Bye, Jason.
2894283	2895063	Bye, guys.
2895083	2895523	Take care.
2896744	2900507	Oh, we love Jason because he not only hosts our website, but he's just a good kid.
2901227	2902568	So we really like hearing from Jason.
2902988	2909192	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
2909252	2910032	Let's go to the phones.
2910092	2910993	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2911013	2911373	Who's this?
2912254	2913134	G68 again.
2913434	2914015	You again?
2914986	2915766	Yes.
2915786	2916907	Weren't you already on this show?
2918007	2920508	Yeah, and I got hacked by Loki.
2920548	2923929	Alright, well we've got to keep it real short to let some more people in.
2923949	2924409	What's on your mind?
2927010	2929831	I might get a new DS because my current DS is broken.
2931132	2936634	And Loki said some time ago that their websites were getting hybrid DS painted in custom colors.
2937534	2939395	Loki, what are some specific websites?
2941977	2942737	Some of the questions dropped.
2942797	2946359	Are you talking about DSs are coming in different colors?
2946639	2950060	There was a website that has different colors for DSs and I can't remember.
2950080	2951460	Oh, that like custom does them or whatever?
2951600	2952701	Yeah, I have to look.
2952801	2953261	Hold on.
2953421	2964944	Well, if he can't find it, I can tell you that... Now, I know you live nowhere near New York City, but I don't know if you can import these on eBay or what have you, but the official Nintendo World Store will do all these different types of colors that you can't get.
2966105	2967565	Gosh, you're pretty petty for them.
2967585	2969806	I remember being out there and there was a hot pink DS...
2970168	2973510	I swear to God, I came so close to buying it for like $250, though.
2973650	2974351	It was expensive.
2975472	2976853	I want a red DS myself.
2978634	2984878	Well, don't they have... I could have sworn I saw, not too long ago, they have the red and black thing now in stores with Brain Age 2, don't they?
2984918	2987760	Yeah, but only the lid part is red.
2988621	2990282	Can you still find those Mario Kart DSes?
2990462	2991463	Oh, they aren't lights, huh?
2992083	2997767	Yeah, but I'm going to get a light soon if my regular DS goes to hell.
2998163	3000004	Yeah, I still have my DS fat somewhere.
3000024	3002745	I should just give it away on the show or something because I'm never going to use it anymore.
3003305	3005906	But it's not a very exciting DS.
3005926	3007266	It's an old gray one.
3007767	3009307	Maybe I'll donate it to charity or something.
3009467	3009827	Yes.
3010228	3011468	Okay, I found the website.
3011528	3012388	Yes.
3013089	3015229	Although they are more expensive.
3016250	3021972	It's colorwarepc.com, and they have everything from – I don't see –
3022975	3025757	They used to have PSPs and DSs, but they don't anymore.
3026077	3026997	They just have consoles.
3027057	3029999	They have PlayStation 3s, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
3030299	3039204	You can actually buy a red PlayStation 3 for an extra $100, or they have a gold one and some other crap.
3040325	3042786	The chat room is yelling at me for thinking about donating my DS.
3042806	3043667	They want me to give it away.
3044087	3045108	You greedy bastards.
3046989	3051872	All right, GS6C, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but thanks so much for playing our game, and good luck on finding your red DS.
3053100	3054040	Thanks, no problem.
3054060	3054320	Bye-bye.
3083277	3090741	About, uh, it's been kind of a, uh, usual, uh, uh, or I mean, it's been kind of a slow news week, all things considered.
3091261	3093662	I wonder if that's, that's, uh, Labor Day or what the deal is.
3093943	3094223	Maybe.
3094403	3099165	Then there's less people listening to the show tonight than usual, probably again because of Labor Day and all that stuff.
3099585	3101927	People are out vacationing and doing what have you.
3102627	3103147	Go figure.
3103588	3103908	Yeah.
3104988	3107289	Well, I guess that's all the folks that wanted to call in.
3107309	3108570	Their phone's not ringing anymore.
3109170	3110191	People just being shy.
3110351	3112192	The usual suspects are on vacation.
3112802	3116485	So, and if there's no more last minute stories, that takes us to the end of the show.
3117145	3117726	Cry, cry.
3118967	3120228	Any final thoughts, folks?
3120308	3120888	Let's go around.
3121308	3123790	Mikotov, thank you for being here, even if you didn't contribute much tonight.
3124791	3125071	Yeah.
3125251	3126532	But we appreciate your moral support.
3127293	3128894	And I'm, you okay over there?
3129374	3133597	I'm trying to, I'm doing cryptograms.
3133677	3135639	What is your new obsession with cryptograms here?
3135959	3136660	I love them.
3136700	3137840	They're so much fun.
3138041	3139562	Is there a website that you play all these things on?
3139582	3140622	Cryptograms.org.
3141983	3168463	is this because you're too busy now or i mean now i'm sorry now you're too bored because now that you won survivor there's nothing else to do i want to win another survivor game but i don't nothing's going on but you lost pirate master right yeah but that's because i hated people and i didn't want to talk to them at least that's what i'm going to say it is i don't know why else if uh hey those of you guys that listen to this show and think it would be fun to play one of these games online i'm going to talk in a future edition
3169157	3172060	A little more in depth about these online games because I think they're kind of interesting.
3172100	3175364	It's not really video game related, but I think they're really kind of different.
3175744	3179187	So I'm going to definitely talk a little more in depth about these games a little later on.
3180028	3185714	When a particular game I'm thinking of is going to be recruiting soon, I'm going to have some folks on to talk about those.
3186114	3187075	That should be interesting, right?
3187696	3187956	Yes.
3189578	3190539	And Loki.
3191283	3194406	Thank you for being here as always, even if you wouldn't drink with me.
3194526	3195487	We didn't really get drunk tonight.
3195507	3196187	It's kind of sad.
3196667	3197448	I didn't drink enough.
3198509	3202512	I was nervous because of being on meds and all, and then Shane doesn't really drink ever, and you just drove.
3203313	3205755	I'm sorry if we disappointed on the alcoholic content tonight.
3206055	3208457	I drank three of these Smirnoffs, but I'm not feeling anything.
3209458	3210399	Yeah, I don't know.
3211359	3212520	Well, your final thought, Loki?
3213121	3217304	My final thought is, I don't know, I wish there was some more news.
3218225	3219246	No, this is a slow week.
3219781	3222663	Well, I'm sure things will be definitely speeding up towards the end of the year, that's for sure.
3223704	3224845	As games are released and everything.
3225426	3229629	And my final thought is, this Arctic Berry is probably my favorite flavor of Smirnoff Ice yet.
3229689	3231150	I don't know what your problem is with this.
3231871	3232852	It's too berry.
3233312	3233693	It's good.
3233973	3235574	It's delicious berry is what it is.
3236715	3237075	All right.
3237596	3239998	I'm looking at chat room to see some stuff here.
3240698	3244481	Son of Dad says, Final thought, Metroid Prime 3 will own my soul this week.
3245222	3246043	It really will.
3246203	3247104	It's so good.
3248565	3248825	All right.
3249761	3250461	That's it, kids.
3251041	3251641	We're out of here.
