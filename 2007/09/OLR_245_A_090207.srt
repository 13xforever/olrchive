00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Tonight, September 2nd, 2007, Xbox Live gets a Labor Day sale, PlayStation gets a SingStar bundle, and an old PC gaming classic is now free.

5
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But joining us, as always, say hello to Loki.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
How are you doing, Loki?

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm fine.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You're fine? That sounded a little bit forced.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm doing okay.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh, so now we've downgraded from find okay. What gives?

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm running low of soda in this cup here, but luckily I brought two backups.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How much soda do you bring to this program?

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Two cans.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Two cans.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
All right, also joining us tonight, say hello to Miklatov, who's filling in in the big blue chair tonight.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Hello.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
How are you doing, Miklatov?

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm fine.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What are you playing there on your PSP?

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's not my PSP.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Whose PSP is it?

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Matt's.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Matt's? What are you playing on Matt's PSP?

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I am playing Katamari.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Can I show the webcam people what you're doing?

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Fine, but I'm going to miss important text.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Important dialogue and what have you.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Dude, the king of all cosmos always says important funny things.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Well, you missed that one, I'm sorry to say.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
All right.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Well, anyhow, yes, we do have webcam tonight for the folks that are listening live.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We're on operator11.com.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I do want to state, though, as we were kind of talking about last week, we're not planning on suddenly changing into a video show or a video podcast.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's just that some of our live listeners wanted to see us while we were taping live, so here we are.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The webcam's on.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But operator11 has some funky rules, and it's supposedly going to shut off after 40 minutes, and so we won't be able to archive until part B again.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But the good news is that operator11 saves an archive of the file for a long time, so if you're listening to the podcast and you wonder to yourself,

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I wonder what this looks like being taped live, you can go over to operator11.com and look for our feed on there and see it.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I want to see how fat all the hosts look on camera and then find out.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And then you can love us long time.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes, you can.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I just named my island in Katamari.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What is your island in Katamari?

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's Poop Island.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's lovely.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Cracks me up.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Do you get to name those yourself?

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I played the Katamari on the PSP.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't know.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It just asked me to name the island, so I named it Poop Island.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
My island was named Slavery Island.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Why did you name it that?

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I don't know.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
All right.

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Let's start off tonight's show, as we always do, talking about how is your gaming week.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Dark Sakura starts us off, but she's not here, so I'll go to Shane, also known as Miklotov, first, since obviously he's playing me and my Katamari.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So I'm playing me and my Katamari.

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And how is it?

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I hate the controls a lot.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's really bad to control, but it's still funny, and that's what really counts in Katamari.

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What else have you been playing this week?

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Metroid Prime 3, which is the coolest.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What do you like about Metroid Prime 3?

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's fun.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What a very descriptive answer you're giving us here.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Well, that was a terrible question.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Sorry.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Why do you think Metroid Prime 3 is so fun?

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What is it about the game that appeals to you?

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Well, I like the fact that the controls are really cool, and I like the Metroid Prime series, and I like the fact that—spoilers are coming up—I got to fight Ridley, and it was really fun, and I had to shoot him in his mouth.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And I was falling down this big shaft the whole time, and it was really cool.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So you have to fight somebody while you're falling down?

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Is there a chance that you'll ever hit the ground?

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Probably not.

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Did you just keep falling forever?

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I think you fall forever until you beat Ridley or Ridley kills you.

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
All right.

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Also, is there anything else you're giving me?

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I started playing Suikoden V again.

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I've owned it since it came out, and I worked on it, but I never actually played it, really.

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Can you say what you did on the game?

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah, I've said before.

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't remember.

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I did text.

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I can't remember.

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
There's secrets you can say and things you can't say on air.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And yeah, I'm just now starting to play it.

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
See, if I asked you if there was a Suikoden VI, could you talk about that?

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I could not talk about that.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You can neither confirm nor deny those reports?

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Not.

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
All right.

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Fine.

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Fair enough.

97
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Anything else?

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
No.

99
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
All right.

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Let's go over to Loki.

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And while Loki talks about his gaming week, I'm going to go grab another cookie.

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Do you want a peanut butter cookie, Loki?

103
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes.

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Awesome.

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I want a peanut butter cookie.

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
All right.

107
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm going to go get that.

108
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Stupid cookies.

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Loki, tell us about your gaming week.

110
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
My gaming week was a lot of Xbox 360 stuff.

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I played a lot of demos, including some stuff I've already played before, like beautiful

112
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Katamari.

113
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,520
Ace Combat 6.

114
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,640
I think I tried a little bit of Juice 2 and didn't like that still.

115
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:14,460
Then, of course, I played Bioshock, which is still awesome and continues to get even

116
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,520
more awesome as I play it.

117
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,860
So definitely, ooh, cookie.

118
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,120
And let's see.

119
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,540
Other games I've played, Call of Duty 4, I actually got to try a little bit of the multiplayer

120
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,820
beta.

121
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,980
And I had no doubts going into it that the game's going to be awesome, and it's just

122
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,980
amazing.

123
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,200
It still plays like Call of Duty 2 and 3.

124
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,820
I do like how they've updated the radar a little bit so you can actually get a better

125
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,000
idea of where people are firing from, so that's pretty cool.

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,120
And also the replays of when you get killed, they're pretty cool.

127
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,600
So that's neat.

128
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,380
And then other stuff, I actually played more Settlers of Catan on Xbox Live Arcade.

129
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:00,480
And I thought about, oh, I played Street Trace New York.

130
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,120
It's that hoverboard racing combat game or something.

131
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,680
That game's really weird.

132
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:13,880
It kind of reminds me of like Crossing Sonic Riders with that crappy, was it that bumper

133
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,960
car game that came with Windows 98 or something.

134
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,960
I don't even remember what the hell that's called.

135
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,160
But something like that.

136
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,680
Not recommending that game, though.

137
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,240
It's quite boring.

138
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,600
But I tried the demo, and that was kind of fun.

139
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Let's see.

140
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Other stuff, on PSP, I was playing a lot of We Love Katamari, and I don't know why.

141
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:42,200
I absolutely hate the control in that game, but I'm stuck playing it and loving it.

142
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,720
The only thing I wish they would do is just port that to PlayStation 2, because I know

143
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,920
they like doing those ports from PSP to PlayStation 2.

144
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Just do that.

145
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:55,240
I mean, I'll spend the $20 to actually buy the game, so I think that's what they need

146
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,400
to do to make at least the controls a little bit better.

147
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,720
And other than that, I believe that was my gaming week.

148
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,640
Oh, Saints Row Multiplayer.

149
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:10,080
We finally, and I wish I had pictures because I haven't finished setting it up yet, but

150
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,720
our game room set up at work is finally done.

151
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,340
We have five Xbox 360s land and have been playing Saints Row on it, and it's absolutely

152
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,160
fun multiplayer.

153
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,980
The only thing I really hate, though, is the system link multiplayer on it, you can't change

154
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,440
the way your character looks, so everybody looks the same.

155
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,960
You can change it on live, but you can't change it in system link, which doesn't make any

156
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,680
sense whatsoever.

157
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,800
But hopefully they'll fix that with a sequel, I don't know.

158
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,480
But hopefully I'll get some actual pictures of the setup.

159
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:49,800
I'm still putting the 360s in clear cases, which by the way, if I were to review the

160
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,200
clear cases I bought, they absolutely suck.

161
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,560
But they look pretty, so that was my gaming week.

162
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,680
That was a hell of a lot of gaming week.

163
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,160
There's a lot of comments going on in the chat room here at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

164
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,640
Again, our chat room location is chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

165
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,600
If you guys are in the Operator 11 chat, since we are doing the video tonight, I just want

166
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,640
to get out there.

167
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,040
We do not read the Op 11 chat because it's on a laptop that's on the other side of the

168
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,800
room and it's hard for us to read, so you have to be in a regular chat room.

169
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,560
I play Contra IV for the DS.

170
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,880
How did you do that?

171
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,400
Our Konami rep brought in a DS with a dev thing in it.

172
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,280
That's kind of important.

173
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,280
That's a big one.

174
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,280
What's Contra IV?

175
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,720
It's awesome.

176
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,200
It's exactly like you would imagine a sequel to Contra III being.

177
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:41,080
It's true 2D side-scrolling action, it's Contra, it's awesome, and not that sort of awesome

178
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,160
that was a neo-Contra and stuff like that.

179
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,600
That was pretty cool.

180
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:54,380
The other thing, I didn't play this game, but I dogged on it last week, Cruisin' for

181
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,380
the Wii.

182
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:02,520
I actually saw the game in motion in a trailer and it looked not as bad, let me put it that

183
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
way.

184
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,440
It looked very low poly count, it almost looked like a DS game ported to the Wii, but it was

185
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,400
running at 60 frames per second, so while it may not have been too pretty to look at,

186
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,800
it was really smooth and looked pretty fun.

187
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,480
If it's cheap enough, let me try it.

188
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,320
I want to go back to Contra IV for a minute because this is a game a lot of people are

189
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,460
very excited about.

190
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,280
How does it use the vertical?

191
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
How does it use the two screens?

192
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,560
Is it just a very vertical game?

193
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,080
It's a very vertical game.

194
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,840
It's very tall.

195
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:36,640
If you'll see stuff falling down and you basically get to shoot at stuff, there's a grappling

196
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,680
hook in it so you can grapple with stuff and crawl on bars and whatnot.

197
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,320
Does it use a touch screen at all or did they just say fuck it?

198
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,040
For the brief time that I had with the game, it did not use a touch screen.

199
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,080
You have no idea if they have the top-down modes like they had in the old Super Nintendo

200
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Contra?

201
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,360
I don't think they do, but it would be cool if they did.

202
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,360
Very cool.

203
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,360
All right.

204
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,360
Wait.

205
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,360
Wait.

206
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,360
Wait.

207
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
What?

208
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,360
Let's tell everybody what my new island name is.

209
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
Yes.

210
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
On Miyamakatamari, what did you name it?

211
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,960
I named it Penn Island.

212
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,520
Penn Island.

213
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,360
Think about that one for a minute.

214
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
Penn Island.

215
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
P-E-N-I-S-L-A-M-D.

216
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
It's so good.

217
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
Hilarious.

218
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
That's comedy gold.

219
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:25,080
Anyhow, I was going to go to the chat room here and read some comments, but we got a

220
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,480
little bit sidetracked here.

221
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,480
Again, chat.orangessoundsradio.com.

222
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,360
Somebody was talking about Bioshock here earlier.

223
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,480
Drunami said, Bioshock is fucking scary.

224
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,000
Did you get scared by Bioshock?

225
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,400
There was one time, I didn't get scared, but it startled me a little bit, where you're

226
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:49,920
investigating this dentist's office and there's pipes breaking and it's freezing stuff.

227
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,680
All of a sudden, one of the pipes breaks and it gets a little foggy and you turn around

228
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,000
and there's a guy standing right there.

229
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,920
I thought he was dead at first.

230
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,760
The first time they played through it and then the second time I knew he was going to

231
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,760
be there.

232
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,000
I turned around and just stood there for a second and then he finally attacked me.

233
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It was kind of freaky.

234
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,400
You turn around and all of a sudden, boom, there's someone there.

235
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,640
Picker Uno says, I got scared by the demo of Bioshock.

236
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,640
I did too a little bit.

237
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,640
I have to admit.

238
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,960
I got a little bit scared from just the demo alone because it's crazy.

239
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:25,720
The game gets so awesome and I can't imagine Andrew Ryan, the main guy who built this whole

240
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,880
city as Walt Disney.

241
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,320
I can replace Walt Disney in this and just like, I don't know.

242
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,440
You're going to make me not want to go back to Disneyland and that makes me sad because

243
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
I love Disneyland.

244
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,960
Andrew Ryan just reminds me of Walt Disney or like a really weird version of Walt Disney.

245
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,520
Maybe they based it off him, who knows.

246
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,240
I was hoping to get some emails from people who didn't like Bioshock, but I didn't see

247
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,120
anything in the mail bag when I last checked.

248
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,120
I don't know.

249
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,480
We'll open up the email bag a little later and let you know if we heard from any people

250
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,280
that didn't like Bioshock.

251
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,520
Anyhow, let's go ahead and go on to My Gaming Week.

252
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,520
I want to talk about My Gaming Week.

253
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,760
I've also been playing Metroid Prime 3, but not quite as much as Shane has.

254
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,600
I don't want to give this game a full review yet, but I can already tell you I like it

255
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,200
better than 1 and 2.

256
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,420
Because 1 and 2, I still had to get over that shock of, oh my god, Metroid is not 2D anymore.

257
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,960
What did they do to my game?

258
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,360
I don't want to label myself as somebody who just hates games automatically because they're

259
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,880
3D, but you have to remember Metroid is a series that's very near and dear to my heart

260
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,600
and it was very hard to kind of conceptualize Metroid in a 3D world.

261
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,160
I don't think the first two games are bad games by any means.

262
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,140
I couldn't get into them because they didn't feel like Metroid to me.

263
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,780
But this third game, I have to admit, the gimmicky controls are actually pretty awesome

264
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:45,440
and done pretty well considering the limited amount of buttons that a Wii controller has.

265
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,500
It's pretty fun.

266
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,400
And I also like the fact that Metroid Prime 3 kind of breaks the mold of when you start

267
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:57,320
in the world, you are missing all of your gear, like you only have your suit and a gun.

268
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,480
And when you start in Metroid Prime 3, you already have like a double jump move.

269
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,080
You already have, or you get the ability to shoot missiles rather quickly.

270
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,800
You can already turn into a ball and a lot of that stuff.

271
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,320
So I think that's kind of cool.

272
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,560
Escapist in the chat room asks, do you have to scan everything in Metroid Prime 3 to understand

273
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,960
what the heck is going on?

274
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
Yes.

275
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
No.

276
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,960
Yes.

277
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,960
No.

278
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
But it helps.

279
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
No.

280
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,040
The scanning in Metroid Prime 3 only, it's not to tell you what's going on, it's to tell

281
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,840
you now what you need to do to get through this room.

282
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,640
It's not like, oh, you know, there's lore stuff you can read, but...

283
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,640
It's not mandatory.

284
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
It's not mandatory.

285
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,820
I did notice it was a little easier to get into story-wise than one or two was, because

286
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,260
you could go up and you could talk to people and it kind of made the story a little better

287
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,440
for me.

288
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,680
It wasn't just scanning things and reading things.

289
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,600
Also, I will point out though, scanning things appears to be the way that you get most of

290
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,880
the tokens in the game.

291
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,700
I know there hasn't been a lot of talk about the tokens, which a couple weeks ago was labeled

292
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:02,280
by a lot of the big game blogs as, like, Metroid Prime's achievement system, but it's not really

293
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
achievements.

294
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,440
The tokens that you unlock by scanning things or doing certain things in the game, you can

295
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,320
use to unlock soundtrack things, graphics and art and all those types of things.

296
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,800
It's kind of like, basically, Mortal Kombat, how you got the tokens from beating things

297
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,640
and you could use them in the crypt or whatever it was called and unlock special stuff.

298
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:28,080
Also, it uses Wii Connect 24 because for every 100 enemies you kill, you get a green token

299
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:33,800
and you can send the green tokens to other people and they can use them.

300
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,740
Or, I guess, no, it's a black token and when you send it to someone else, it's green or

301
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,600
something like that, but you have to use friend codes to make that work.

302
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,520
And then you said, Shane, you are pretty sure you got an actual achievement in the game

303
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,520
or something.

304
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,520
Oh, yeah.

305
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,520
I was using my ice missile.

306
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,320
Hey, while I'm talking, smell this alcohol.

307
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,920
I'll talk about the alcohol in a minute, folks.

308
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,920
I was using the ice missile on just enemies randomly.

309
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,200
I want to drink it first.

310
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Not yet.

311
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,800
No, I'm going to drink it first.

312
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:12,480
I used the ice missile on some lizard thing and once I did that, one of the little cards

313
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:20,840
you get for every 100 kills, I guess for certain random tasks you do, came up and was like

314
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,920
a chilled lizard or something like that, like a terrible achievement name.

315
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,920
And it was cool.

316
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,920
I like that.

317
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,920
It's achievements.

318
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,320
And you know what you can do with that?

319
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,320
Nothing.

320
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
Absolutely nothing.

321
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,840
Just like the Xbox 360 achievements.

322
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,700
By the way, the liquor talk is because it is a three-day weekend, so some of us have

323
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:45,040
chosen to do a little drinking tonight, which leads me to the responsibility spiel.

324
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,960
Of course, we are all over 21 and Matt's not drinking tonight because he didn't find a

325
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,080
designated driver.

326
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,600
I could have, but I figured that...

327
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Loser?

328
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
He's not into it tonight.

329
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,800
You said you were sick and were possibly not going to be drinking, so that's why I didn't

330
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,000
want to be the only one.

331
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,800
Yes, I have been sick, but I figure it's only Tylenol that I'm taking, so I should be okay,

332
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
right?

333
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,760
Well, yeah, unless you die, in which case then we would have been terribly wrong.

334
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
All right.

335
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,080
Well, anyhow, what else?

336
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,800
But Shane's here and Shane's drinking, although he doesn't like his blue drink, even though

337
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
he likes the smell of it.

338
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
I like it.

339
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,800
I like the smell.

340
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,320
It's like an alcoholic blueberry muffin to me.

341
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,320
It's really weird.

342
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,320
You want to try this one?

343
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,320
This pomegranate thingy?

344
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
I haven't drank from it yet.

345
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,320
Yes.

346
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,440
I was going to say, we are all over 21 and we drink responsibly, blah, blah, blah, and

347
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,840
kids shouldn't drink, blah, blah, blah, and so on, so yeah.

348
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,840
Is that any good?

349
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,720
I don't know if it's the combination of the two, but that tastes like that gamer-fueled

350
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,000
Mountain Dew to me, which is not a pleasant taste.

351
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Really?

352
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
This is pomegranate fusion smearing off.

353
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,780
We're taking it easy tonight, so we'll see.

354
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,780
Let's see.

355
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,780
What else did I do in my gaming week?

356
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,840
I bought on the Xbox 360, which of course is a Japanese RPG made by a lot of the people

357
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,120
that were involved with Final Fantasy.

358
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,080
You have Sakaguchi, who made the first Final Fantasy, Nobui Matsu does the music again,

359
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,320
and then I believe, who is it, Akira Toriyama, is that his name?

360
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
Something like that.

361
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,320
Did the Dragon Ball Z characters?

362
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,680
Those are the characters in this game.

363
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,300
Blue Dragon is a good game.

364
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,760
Is it a great game?

365
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
No.

366
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Is it a 10?

367
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
No.

368
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,600
Is it going to leave a lot of people disappointed because they were expecting...

369
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
Blue Dragon...

370
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Hold on.

371
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,200
I'm going to have your opinion in a minute.

372
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,360
Is it going to leave a lot of people disappointed because you hear these big names attached

373
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:27,080
to it, and you are expecting greatness, or like a Final Fantasy XIII or something?

374
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,080
Yes.

375
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,240
It's going to leave a lot of people disappointed.

376
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,040
But it's not a bad game by any means, and certainly it's the type of game that the Xbox

377
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,920
360 is severely lacking.

378
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,560
But here's the problems I see with Blue Dragon.

379
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,560
It's not with the battle system.

380
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,980
I love the battle system.

381
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:44,560
It's a real throwback to an old Super Nintendo RPG, and it feels very similar to Final Fantasy

382
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,360
V with some elements in the act of time kind of thrown in.

383
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,560
You can charge attacks and drop them in certain places in the act of time, and depending on

384
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,680
how long you charge, it does more damage.

385
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:59,680
So I personally like the battle system as a throwback to old RPGs, but the story is

386
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,320
kind of meh.

387
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,880
And you would think with these names attached to it would be an awesome story, but the problem

388
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,480
with the story is that it just kind of comes out of nowhere, you know?

389
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,160
And you don't understand what the bad guy's motivations are.

390
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:19,640
I mean, literally, you go up into this big bubble in the sky.

391
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:29,480
Your town is being attacked by this land shark.

392
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,520
This shark is going around destroying buildings and things, and then you basically manage

393
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,400
to sort of catch the land shark, but it drags you into this place.

394
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
Would you say it's a street shark?

395
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,680
No, it's a land shark.

396
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,680
That's what they call it.

397
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,520
And it even has a fin that sticks out above the ground.

398
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,200
I thought it may have been a reference back to that really crappy cartoon series.

399
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,160
Eventually, the land shark takes them underground, and then the land shark blasts off into space,

400
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,360
and they're on it, or not, I shouldn't say into space, but into the sky.

401
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,160
And then they finally meet the bad guy.

402
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,240
You encounter the main bad guy within the first 30 minutes to an hour of the game, and

403
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,520
they're like, why are you doing this?

404
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,320
And he says, because I want to hear your screams.

405
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,080
I'm like, what kind of motivation is that?

406
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,080
Ooh, pedophile.

407
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,960
It's like, that kind of uber generic bad guy thing kind of worked back in the day when

408
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,440
there wasn't a whole lot of way to flesh out the story, but I don't know so much now.

409
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,080
So it's got a very awkward story, and I cannot stand the little cute character Maru Maru.

410
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,720
I cannot stand what they did with his voice.

411
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,160
It's awful.

412
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,400
Otherwise, those little bitches aside, I mean, it is a good game.

413
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,560
If you're a fan of role-playing games and you have a 360, it's worth your time to check

414
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,960
out, because importantly, it comes down to how is the game, and the game is fine.

415
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,120
The music's really good and all that stuff.

416
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,360
I'm sorry, but that gameplay is boring, and it has led me to call it Blue Dragon.

417
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,720
I'm noticing DJ Disentery in chat says, because you want to hear their screams, sounds like

418
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,440
Shane's reason for shaking babies, referring to an earlier episode of the program.

419
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,400
Or just in general.

420
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,880
Why did you not like Blue Dragon?

421
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,240
You're someone that liked old RPGs, right?

422
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:10,520
But we've come so far, and then to be thrown this battle system that's absolutely boring,

423
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,120
it's just like, I don't know, it doesn't sit right with me.

424
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,720
And the pacing seems slow, and granted, this is all, the only thing I've played is the

425
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,520
demo that was on Xbox Live.

426
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,120
See, I don't think that, I think the demo, now that I've played the actual game, the

427
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,120
demo fucking sucks.

428
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,880
The demo is not a good representation of the game, I think.

429
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:37,600
I just, it looks overly generic, and not interesting.

430
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:44,400
And yeah, that Maru Maru guy is, like, the reason we have mute buttons on TVs.

431
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,600
I'm looking in the chat room here, Pika Uno says, Blue Drag On?

432
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Get it?

433
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,600
Because it drags on.

434
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
Get it?

435
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
Yes, I get it.

436
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,600
So maybe you could call it Boo Drag On, maybe, I don't know.

437
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,160
I'm just going to stick with Boo Dragon.

438
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,960
Mark Tetsuya says, Does Blue Dragon have the original voice?

439
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,960
Is this an option?

440
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,960
Yes, it does.

441
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,480
You can choose the English language, a Japanese language, all with English subtitles, or you

442
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,020
can have French language.

443
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,080
So if you want all your characters to speak French, you can have that as well, which I'm

444
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,080
sure is interesting.

445
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,520
That might make the game a little better playing it in French.

446
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,520
You think?

447
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
Yes.

448
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,000
But I think that one guy's voice is still going to be very annoying.

449
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,320
But it would be.

450
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,320
That's literally what he sounds like.

451
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,320
It's horrible.

452
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,320
It would be French annoying.

453
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,320
It might be cool.

454
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:36,960
Sounds like teen girl squad.

455
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,240
Escapist in chat room says, Well, now to wait for Eternal Sonata and Lost Odyssey.

456
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,520
Eternal Sonata is going to be awesome, but this will hold me over.

457
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,880
That was the best thing about Blue Dragon is inside the case was a card pimping out

458
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,320
Eternal Sonata, because that's a good game.

459
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,040
But again, you're basing your opinions on these games off a demo.

460
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
How dare you?

461
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,040
I'm watching you play it.

462
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,480
By Eternal Sonata, you haven't even played the real game yet.

463
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,480
You've only played a demo.

464
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,040
And it was the best demo ever.

465
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,040
I'm trying to think.

466
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,800
What were some good demos that were bad games?

467
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,120
Loki, help me out here.

468
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,760
Good demos that were bad games.

469
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,480
Can you think of anything?

470
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,320
I know there's got to be something.

471
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,840
I'm going to think about this one.

472
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
Chat room, I need your help.

473
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,400
Good demos, bad games.

474
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,800
Did Perfect Dark have a good demo?

475
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,280
I don't know.

476
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,640
Perfect Dark Zero, sorry.

477
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,440
Not to be confused with the original Perfect Dark, sorry.

478
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
Cameo maybe?

479
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,440
I've never played that.

480
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,240
Escapist says Final Fantasy 12.

481
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,760
I freaking love Final Fantasy 12.

482
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
What are you talking about?

483
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,440
Who that person from the chat room, because they're idiots.

484
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,920
Fireboma says Devil Dice.

485
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,840
I don't even know what that is.

486
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,280
Pika Uno says Cameo rules, shut the fuck up.

487
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,280
It's okay.

488
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,560
I wouldn't say it rules, but it's okay.

489
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,560
It rules.

490
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
It's sucking.

491
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,200
All right.

492
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,840
Let's get into tonight's gaming news, since we've talked about our gaming week for far

493
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,840
too long.

494
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,440
I was going to get into some housekeeping.

495
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,920
Pretty much the only thing I had to tell you guys was that we are doing a little bit of

496
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,720
drinking tonight, so if we sound a little off, that's why it's a three-day weekend.

497
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
Why not?

498
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,240
I'm just going to be off, period.

499
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,360
And that we are up on Operator 11, if you want to check us out there, or the archive

500
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,360
should be up there.

501
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,920
I don't know about this video quality, though.

502
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,160
It looks like it's running really slow.

503
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,240
We'll see, though.

504
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,240
I'm just moving really slow.

505
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,920
As long as it doesn't kill the screen.

506
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,680
We're not going to play to the camera, because we don't want to be a TV show.

507
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,480
We're still Orange Lounge Radio, but to answer the calls of our live listeners who wanted

508
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,960
us to get a webcam, we finally did.

509
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,960
So there you have it.

510
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
Wow.

511
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
Enjoy.

512
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
That's really...

513
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,220
I know.

514
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,220
That's really awesome.

515
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,220
Figure.

516
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,220
All right.

517
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,220
Anyhow.

518
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,220
Wow.

519
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,220
FootyMonster agrees with Final Fantasy XII.

520
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,560
I second Final Fantasy XII.

521
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,560
Demo was great.

522
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,720
Game sucked.

523
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
You guys are mean.

524
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,720
Yeah.

525
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
How about Final Fantasy VIII?

526
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
The game was awesome.

527
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
Yes.

528
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
How about Final Fantasy VIII?

529
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
I love Final Fantasy VIII.

530
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
Excellent example.

531
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,720
That is such a good game.

532
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
I don't even remember the demo.

533
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
Ruined by a battle system.

534
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,720
Where was the demo?

535
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,720
And the battle system was great.

536
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,720
The demo was with...

537
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,720
What did they put the Final Fantasy VIII?

538
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
Vagrant Story.

539
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Was it really?

540
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,720
Yeah.

541
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
They put the Final Fantasy VIII demo with some other Square game.

542
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,720
I remember that.

543
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,720
All right.

544
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Let's get into the gaming news.

545
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,840
I don't have any housekeeping otherwise.

546
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,800
Visit our website, OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

547
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,500
Leave us five-star reviews on iTunes, pretty please, or elsewhere around the web.

548
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,220
Tell two people you know about our program, and so on and so on.

549
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,220
Live journal MySpace.

550
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,220
Add us there.

551
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,220
Blah, blah, blah.

552
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,220
Gaming news.

553
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,220
I don't know.

554
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,220
Can I?

555
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,220
You, Loki, or me?

556
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,220
You are.

557
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,220
I am.

558
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,220
Oh, crap.

559
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,220
Oh, because I have a follow-up to something we talked about last week.

560
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,800
Last week, we were talking about Mass Effect is getting delayed to December.

561
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,840
Well, guess what?

562
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,680
That turned out to not be true, because Mass Effect is now set to be released on November

563
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:41,320
20th, which is getting close to December, but not quite there yet.

564
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,680
So that should be out just in time for the big day after Thanksgiving holiday.

565
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,720
And of course, a lot of people definitely looking forward to this game.

566
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
They call it an RPG.

567
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,240
It's like sci-fi.

568
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,920
Looks to have a little bit of first-person shooter elements in it, though.

569
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,360
I don't want to call it a first-person shooter, but some elements is kind of mixed up.

570
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:06,560
I would say it's like what Phantasy Star Online should have been.

571
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
Sort of.

572
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,560
Except it's offline.

573
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,560
Well, we'll see.

574
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,560
You know, futuristic.

575
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,560
Wait, wait.

576
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,600
Phantasy Star Online or Phantasy Star Universe?

577
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,600
Either.

578
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Phantasy Star Online was a great game.

579
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,720
Universe was a piece of crap.

580
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,060
I liked Universe's single-player story, and the fact that it was online was just a bonus.

581
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,960
But it was a little bit repetitive.

582
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
I'll give you that.

583
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
It was a little bit repetitive.

584
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
You didn't like online?

585
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
It was okay.

586
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,480
All you do is run around and hit things.

587
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,480
It was great.

588
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,280
It was fun to play with voice chat.

589
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,280
It was fun to play with other people.

590
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,280
It was a chatroom with swords.

591
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,280
It was a terrible game fight.

592
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
That's what it was.

593
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,280
It was a chatroom with swords.

594
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,280
Whatever.

595
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,280
At least they didn't move as funky as they did in the old Phantasy Star Online.

596
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,580
At least there's that much.

597
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:49,120
Anyways, something less exciting now.

598
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:55,840
Apparently there's some pictures that leaked out on Flickr of a new Xbox Live arcade game

599
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,360
featuring the Toyota Yaris.

600
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,720
Yes, those wonderful commercials featuring the car doing stupid things, yet not really

601
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
talking about the car.

602
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,120
Great.

603
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,760
It's going to be an adver game.

604
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,760
I don't know.

605
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,840
This was at, I think, some Toyota event.

606
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:17,920
I hope we don't pay for this because I sure as hell am not going to pay for this.

607
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,760
Now, is this a racing game?

608
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,760
What the hell would you do with it?

609
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,760
It looks like a racing game.

610
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,760
Is there screenshots?

611
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:30,880
Well, there are screenshots of a shot of people playing the game, but it doesn't really show

612
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,880
much.

613
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,600
It was at the Evolution FGC EVO West 2007 event.

614
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,840
Yeah, I don't know.

615
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:46,320
It doesn't really show me much and I could care less that this game is coming out.

616
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,640
Hey, you know what though?

617
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,720
If it's free and it's a decent racing game, I'm all about that.

618
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
Here it is for you.

619
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,600
If it's free and you can get achievement points from it, you'll totally play it until you

620
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
unlock everything.

621
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,840
Yeah, shut up.

622
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,060
You know what should be an unlockable feature in a Toyota racing game, though?

623
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,840
To be able to race Priuses, that would be awesome.

624
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,960
Don't you think, like Al Gore's Sun Mode?

625
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,400
Wouldn't that be fun?

626
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,440
I don't know how fun this is going to be, but they are making a brand new movie out

627
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,120
of another video game, because you know Hollywood loves to make movies out of video games.

628
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,760
CP Productions is a brand new Hollywood company and they have bought the rights to make Joust.

629
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:33,720
Yes, like Joust from 1983 or whenever that game came out.

630
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,120
Remember when you had the little lance and you tried to stab the pterodactyl in the mouth

631
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,960
and you hit the button to flap around?

632
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,800
It's actually a pretty fun game to play two player, and it's on Xbox Live.

633
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,080
That's right, they are going to make Joust the movie.

634
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,900
It's being made by producers Christine Peters and Michael Cerenzi.

635
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:58,600
They have worked on such notable films as Blackout and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.

636
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,680
Here's a quote from Cerenzi.

637
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:05,360
Joust is an arcade game that's as old as Pac-Man and has global awareness.

638
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,160
We took one element of the game and the brand itself and built a whole new world around

639
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,880
it for the film.

640
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,040
So you can guess what that element is going to be.

641
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,600
I hope it's the element of the hands coming up from the lava to pull people in the lava

642
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
because that was always cool.

643
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,440
And maybe they'll pull these producers in and make them not make this movie because

644
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,000
it's probably going to be bad.

645
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:33,380
I could see one of those, I don't know, just like a pseudo-futuristic jousting movie.

646
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,040
It's going to be boring is what it is.

647
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:40,480
I mean, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, fortunately I got dragged to that and that was a horrible

648
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
movie.

649
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,720
So, I don't know.

650
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,120
It's such a dumb idea.

651
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,120
Let's see, going to our chat room, chat.orensonshadeo.com.

652
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,040
Tiger Claw says, a movie about people riding on giant ostriches.

653
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:58,120
Articuya says, ostriches don't fly and Dark Knight says, fail in its future.

654
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,120
There you go.

655
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:07,000
Escapist says, Kate Hudson and her ostriches bicker for half the movie than Fall in Love.

656
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Now that I'd pay to see.

657
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,760
Anyways, there's an interesting rumor going on regarding Guitar Hero 3.

658
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:26,080
Apparently another artist is in talks with Activision and Red Octane regarding, of course,

659
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,600
being in Guitar Hero 3 as one of the legends of rock to join up with the other people in

660
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,600
there.

661
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,920
That person is Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine, of course, obviously going to

662
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,080
be dueling against him.

663
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:46,200
I think right now it's still, they're in talks but hasn't fully committed yet.

664
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,200
But that'd be kind of neat.

665
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,960
They're getting down the line here so if they're going to put him in there, it's going to have

666
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,960
to be pretty soon.

667
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,240
Yeah, isn't that game coming out like next month or something?

668
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,760
Yeah, like around Halloween, seriously.

669
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,040
Are they just maybe holding on to some secrets?

670
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:07,760
Well, I mean, I can't imagine that there's too much development going into that game.

671
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,760
You don't really have to change that much other than putting songs in there and creating

672
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:18,640
the player models for these people that they're getting in there.

673
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,560
Coming soon to the Xbox Live Video Marketplace, Family Guy.

674
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,800
That's right, coming on September 2nd.

675
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,320
Is that today or tomorrow?

676
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,320
That's today.

677
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,320
That's today.

678
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,320
Well, holy crap.

679
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,320
It's coming out today on Xbox Live Marketplace.

680
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,640
That's freaking sweet.

681
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,640
Stewie Griffin, The Untold Story, and I believe episodes from, I don't know if it's, is it

682
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,880
every episode that's coming up on Xbox Live?

683
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,880
I think it is.

684
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,120
Let me just save you some time.

685
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,720
Do not download Stewie Griffin, The Untold Story, whatever that is.

686
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,720
Wasn't that bad?

687
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,720
It is horrible.

688
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,900
It's just three episodes strung together and it feels like three episodes.

689
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,920
It was not good, but Family Guy is good.

690
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:04,080
I like that they decided to put this on the Marketplace at the height of its popularity.

691
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,320
Being sarcastic because nobody should care about the show anymore.

692
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,760
Well, isn't it ironic, though, that the show is so damn popular and then it came out, it

693
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,760
got canceled or whatever.

694
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,200
It was more like a cult thing, then it got canceled, then it was popular again on DVD,

695
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,620
like insanely popular, like it was like, you know, have you seen this, and then Fox brings

696
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:25,800
it back and it's funny for a couple weeks and then it just kind of goes downhill.

697
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,800
It's so funny.

698
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,800
I love it.

699
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Really?

700
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
But here's the thing, though.

701
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
I don't watch it on Fox.

702
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,680
I watch three runs on Cartoon Network and TBS.

703
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,960
So you're still watching the old episodes?

704
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,560
I'm watching, well, they're older episodes.

705
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,640
It's basically when I don't get to catch the new episodes when they come out on Fox, they

706
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,760
play them a few weeks later on Cartoon Network.

707
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,380
And I think if you watch Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, your standards for entertainment

708
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:53,360
are a lot lower than most people's, because god damn, I don't know how some of those shows

709
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,720
survive on their late-night stoners watching that.

710
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,840
Tom Goes to the Mayor or whatever?

711
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,200
No, there's stuff that's a lot weirder than that now.

712
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,200
Really?

713
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,760
They're just scraping at the bottom of the barrel.

714
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,960
Now, it's a lot worse.

715
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,960
They actually have some perfect hair, or like, woman with perfect hair, and it's like some

716
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,560
weird perverted guy, and some anime chick, or something, I don't know.

717
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:22,340
So speaking of weird Japanese stuff, there's that Dreamcast shoot-em-up game that was coming

718
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,280
out, I guess, next year.

719
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,400
It's also coming out on Xbox Live Arcade in Japan.

720
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:35,080
So, it's pretty interesting, I guess it's one of the games called Trigger Heart Alexia

721
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:42,520
is coming to Xbox Live Arcade, and I guess it's the team behind a Sega Saturn shooter

722
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:50,160
game called Shin-ru, I guess, I probably butchered that.

723
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:56,680
That's pretty awesome, and I will definitely be using my Japanese account to buy that game.

724
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,160
If you buy a game on the Japanese Xbox Live accounts, can you play it on the American

725
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,160
accounts?

726
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,520
Does it work that way?

727
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,860
Um, maybe.

728
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:09,920
What you can do is you can download the demo on the Japanese account, and then you register

729
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:17,380
it on the US account, because if you download a game and you purchase it on another account,

730
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:23,080
it's a demo on the other accounts, so what you can do is I download it on the Japanese

731
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,680
download the demo and then register it on the US one. That should work.

732
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:32,960
Interesting, I think. Alright. Also coming to Xbox Live Arcade very soon, it's in this

733
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,440
next week, Fatal Fury Special finally makes its way to Xbox Live Arcade, which

734
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,360
I'm actually pretty excited about because Fatal Fury Special is a game I

735
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,360
actually really enjoyed back in the day, so I'm excited to see this game finally

736
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:49,240
make its way to Xbox Live. Cyberball 2072. This was not a game I'm so fond of, but I

737
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,640
bet there's a lot of people out there that are into this game.

738
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,480
It's like that futuristic football game that Atari put out many

739
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,240
years ago. I think it runs on the same hardware as games like 720, and those

740
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,560
games did. So that game is coming out to Xbox Live Marketplace. What should be also

741
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,920
noted, though, is that there's a Labor Day sale going on on Xbox Live

742
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:11,400
Marketplace right now, and you can get certain games for half price. Small Arms

743
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:16,880
and Zuma are 400 Microsoft points apiece this weekend, and Gauntlet and Dig Dug

744
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:22,400
are 200 points a pop through Monday at 5 o'clock. So if you're listening to us

745
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,680
live or on the podcast, you might want to hurry up and grab those if you want them.

746
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:32,920
I don't know. I mean, even at 200 points, that's, what, 250? Eh, I don't know. Gauntlet and Dig Dug

747
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,160
are both decent games. I don't know. I think Gauntlet is fun, like it's a

748
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,980
nostalgia thing for, like, the first two times you play it, and then you're like,

749
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,840
I'm done with this now. Dig Dug is a classic, though. I don't know. I guess it

750
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:48,000
depends how strongly you feel about retro titles. Yeah. Anyways, there are some

751
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,800
pictures that leaked out, or I wouldn't really say leaked out, went out on the

752
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:57,060
internet showing that, yes, the elites can also crap out as well and get the

753
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:02,240
wonderful three rings of death. Although, I'm not too surprised, though, seeing that

754
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,960
they're showing, I guess, a kiosk. Now, I'm not sure what kind of ventilation those

755
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,700
kiosks have, but just looking at it, I mean, doesn't look like there's much

756
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,640
airflow in that at all, and depending on what they're running, no wonder that

757
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:24,360
thing overheated. So, I don't know. Xbox 360s die. They'll get replaced. Live. I guess as

758
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,320
long as they give the three-year warranty with those, right? Oh, yeah, they

759
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,700
still do the warranties on all of them, so, I mean, apparently they're stepping up

760
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,900
things to make sure that their turnaround time's a lot less, but... And aren't

761
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,360
they, like, giving away free Xbox Live or something with that, too? They are. They're

762
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,760
giving away, when you actually return the system, you'll get a free card for one

763
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,440
month of Xbox Live, valued at probably, like, five bucks. Now, is that something

764
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:56,080
that you can extend your current Xbox Live account with? I'm not sure if you

765
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,200
can extend your current one. I'd imagine you would, because it's just those

766
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:11,600
redeemable cards, the gold subscriptions. So, I'm not sure, but... Alright, well, one

767
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,080
thing I'm looking forward to playing on the 360 at some point is Tekken 6.

768
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,920
Hopefully it's coming to the 360, and they said, yep, I seem to remember they announced

769
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,720
it's coming to both systems. I don't know if it's coming to the 360 yet,

770
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,760
because I think that the arcade game's actually running off of PlayStation 3

771
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,680
hardware, so... Don't! No, we'll see. Well, anyway, Tekken 6 is still on its way. I guess...

772
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:38,000
I probably have a PS3 by then, anyway. Yeah, Dartusuius says, are you sure you're

773
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,240
not thinking of Virtua Fighter 5? Maybe I am. Yeah, Virtua Fighter 5's coming out in

774
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,880
October. Well, Tekken 6 is on its way, and there's a brand new fighter that's been

775
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:51,800
announced for Tekken 6, and that's Bob. Yes, he has the very unique name of Bob,

776
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,640
but the cool thing about Bob, he's a chubby. He's a chubster, and you don't see

777
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,120
a lot of fat guys in video games, especially in fighting games. Doesn't he

778
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,440
sort of resemble Mario with bleached hair? Kinda. Here's a picture of him right

779
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,880
here. He does kind of look like Mario with bleached hair. He's got the blue

780
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,280
jeans and a red shirt and suspenders, and then bleached hair. But, you know, the only

781
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,920
fat guys I can think of in video game history would be like, you know, Raiden

782
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,880
from... I think he was in one of the Neo Geo fighting games. I think he was in the

783
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:25,440
first Fatal Fury, I think. And there was... What other big fat guys were there?

784
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,240
T-Honda. T-Honda, but he wasn't fat. He was... He was a sumo wrestler. Yeah. There you go.

785
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,160
Karnov is what Jirnami says in chats. There you go. Yes, I guess he's a

786
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:41,400
stereotypical American, according to Nintendo Maniac 64. According to Japanese

787
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:46,760
Arcadia Magazine, who actually kind of broke the news on this, Bob used to be

788
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,460
into conventional beauty, but he got frustrated by how his size limited him,

789
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:59,340
so he got super fat. You go, boy. Awesome. Now what else is pretty neat? That Tekken

790
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:06,160
5 online is now online. And yes, it's kind of funny, but you can now download,

791
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:14,100
and not for free, but for $10, you can download and get survival mode, and then

792
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:21,360
I guess a practice mode, and of course the online mode. So, yay! They broke it and

793
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:27,560
then make you pay $10 to fix it. Hooray. Do you have Tekken on the PlayStation

794
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,600
Network? Fuck no. Because you know I don't even have a PlayStation 2. I'm not spending like 15 bucks for a

795
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:37,080
crippled game. I'm not really a Tekken fan. I mean, I don't play fighting games

796
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:45,200
that much, so much less do I play PlayStation 3 games much. All right, well,

797
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,440
one thing we like to do is we like to open up ye old mailbag once in a while

798
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,000
and read some of our favorite emails. Sadly, Dark Soccer is not here tonight, so

799
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,800
she's not here to read the emails for us, but I'm here, damn it. I'll read the emails.

800
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,040
Again, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangelaundry.com is the place to do

801
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:15,480
it. Our first email tonight comes from AZHP, and AZHP says, hey OLR, random

802
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,200
thought from last week's show that I forgot to say on the skype line. Saw the

803
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,560
live feed for about five seconds before live 365 got cut off and you killed the

804
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:29,680
operator. 11 feed. Rob is hot, call me later. Well, thank you.

805
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,080
That's awkward. Yeah, a little bit. P.S., just kidding. Keep up the great

806
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:43,560
podcasting. Less awkward. Funny. Let's go to another email. This email comes to us

807
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:50,160
from Ali. It could be Ali, actually. I think it's Ali. In episode 244, part A, you

808
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,760
got an email from someone who said your show is calming, and Rob exclaimed, I

809
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,360
don't understand. How is this show calming? This show makes me want to do

810
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:00,680
vehicular manslaughter to my cousins. I second that calming effect. I've been

811
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,960
doing the endurance races in Forza while listening to podcasts, and I must say,

812
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,400
it is when I listen to yours that I don't want to kill my Xbox. It cheats. Now

813
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,800
I need to say F you to my local EB Games. It is situated in a local burg separated

814
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,480
from the city, which is illegal to trade video games if you are under 18, and you

815
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,680
must have photo ID to trade video games. In other words, when I went to take my

816
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,680
stack of old Xbox games that have no replay value in to get Forza, I had to go

817
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,620
back home, drag my mom to EB, and make her show them her driver's license so I

818
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:36,640
could buy the E-rated Forza Motorsport 2, WTF. I would have called in to deliver

819
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,040
that rant, but I'm never home when you guys tape. Also, am I the only one who

820
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:44,180
finds the mouse acceleration and Bioshock unbelievably frustrating? I love

821
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:48,620
how in Battlefield 1942, Half-Life 2, and Counter-Strike, the mouse response is

822
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:53,000
snappy and rigid, but Bioshock has some weird acceleration built into it, or is

823
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,960
it because I'm playing in Vista? Oh, by the way, I'm playing Bioshock on my

824
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,560
dual-booting MacBook Pro. Suck it, Loki. Love the show, except the Mac hating, Ali.

825
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:09,320
There you go. Another fan mail for Loki. Well, maybe it's because he's doing that

826
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,440
whole dual-booting thing that his mouse is so screwed up. No, I have no idea. I

827
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,880
have not been able to play. Bioshock won't even run on my archaic PC, so I

828
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,920
couldn't tell you, but I'm curious, chat room, maybe is there somebody in chat

829
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,240
that's playing Bioshock on the PC that would care to enlighten us? Does the mouse

830
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,680
feel weird to you guys? What do you guys think about his other story where he

831
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,080
says that you cannot trade video games if you're under 18? You have to have

832
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,240
photo ID to trade games. You probably have a lot of theft of video games and

833
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,000
stuff, and people are just tired of dealing with it. So they're blaming the

834
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,640
damn kids. Yep, it's those damn kids. They make laws for reasons, so, you know,

835
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,400
obviously they've had reason to make such a law because, you know, they were

836
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:50,200
getting too much theft or people turn in stuff. I could understand needing a photo

837
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:55,160
ID. I don't understand the 18 thing, but... I think all of them require photo ID. Yeah,

838
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:01,080
they do now, so, I mean, 16 and up, I can see that. All right, well, let's go to the next

839
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:06,160
email. Goldbanjo14 in our chat room says, that law is bullshit. Let's go to the

840
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,200
next email in our mailbag. mailbagandorangelsrader.com. This one's not

841
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:16,920
signed, so I will attribute it to Nick C, and it's titled, I agree with Loki. Hi, my

842
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,880
name Nick, and I have been listening since I got a PSP when it first came and

843
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,560
found the OLR PSP website. I'm reading this as is, you guys. Wow, this is a

844
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:30,440
terrible email. I listen live once and a while and download the podcast all the

845
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,440
time. I'm thinking he typed it on his PSP, so I'm giving him a break.

846
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,160
So, listening to your podcast helped me out when buying a DDR game for my sister.

847
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:44,480
I agree with Loki on Apple. I hat every product made by Apple. People always get

848
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,720
made when I bash on Apple all the time, saying that Apple is good with their

849
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,640
crappy iPods and Macs that are overpriced. So, what do you think he meant

850
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:59,120
by hat? Was it hate or half? It's hate. I think it's half. It says, I hate

851
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,600
every product made by Apple. People always get mad, but I read it as is.

852
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,280
People always get mad when I bash on Apple all the time, saying that Apple is

853
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,520
good with their crappy iPods and Macs that are overpriced, and I hope they

854
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,560
unlock the iPhone so I can make fun of more people that bought an iPod that

855
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:20,120
makes calls. So, there you go, Loki. At least you have the bad grammar kids

856
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,120
agree with you.

857
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:26,800
Okay, you know, still though, you've got to admit, I mean, $600 for a phone?

858
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,800
Come on.

859
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:33,160
I mean, if it were a Microsoft phone, I would still be giving people crap for

860
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,360
it. I'm like, why the fuck are you spending $600 on a phone? That's what I

861
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,360
want to know.

862
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:42,360
Here's my thing. I'll tell you straight up right now. You know I love Macs and

863
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:47,160
all that stuff, so I'm not going to hate on it or whatever, but here's the

864
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,280
thing is that I did notice when I was at the airport this week, because I did

865
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,760
spend a lot of my week in L.A. this week, is that there are tons of assholes

866
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,040
out there with iPhones that don't even know how to use them. It's becoming

867
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:03,040
this trendy thing amongst men and businesswomen to use, and there's a lot

868
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,840
of assholes out there with iPhones, so go figure.

869
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,840
All right.

870
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:11,280
Because it's expensive and excessive, just like SUVs.

871
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,280
Hey, if you're an Apple fan boy, fan girl, and you bought one because you

872
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,960
want to support the great Apple in the sky, then go for it. It's all good.

873
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,880
No hate. No hate from here.

874
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:29,440
We'll do one more here. This is from Nate. Hi, Nate. Good day to you. I've

875
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,080
been listening to your podcast for a couple months now, starting with your

876
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,680
fifth anniversary show, and I find it very entertaining. I just want to let

877
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,600
you know that despite Sky's frequent admonishments of the show going off

878
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,280
subject, I find this very quality to be one of the most appealing aspects

879
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,400
of your podcast. I am but a poor commoner and don't have any of the next

880
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,640
gen systems, so I have to make do with the pre-DS and Wii Nintendo systems.

881
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:56,720
As such, a lot of the hot news regarding Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, etc., I

882
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,680
just don't have much interest in, although it is nice to keep up with

883
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,720
what's happening in the industry just for the sake of staying well informed.

884
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,560
Long story short, what keeps me coming back each week is the chemistry

885
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:09,260
between you guys, your weird but hilarious sense of humor, and yes, even

886
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:14,240
the bizarre rants and ostensibly off-subject forays into movies, comics,

887
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,960
social commentary, cat websites, etc. Oh, and of course, all that forbidden

888
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,200
sexual tension between Sky and Dark Sakura. Wow, that person obviously

889
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:27,080
doesn't listen to this show whatsoever. What? What? You may have missed a

890
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:31,720
small detail about me that would mean I would not think of Dark Sakura

891
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,640
like that, although I wish she was here to react to that. That would be

892
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,680
kind of funny. I'm going to leave that in the mail bag and see if she

893
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,000
reads it next week. And then he closes with, keep up the good work.

894
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,160
Thank you very much, even if that sexual tension is extremely misplaced.

895
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:51,240
Maybe I could do one more. One more? All right. One more from Nintendo

896
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:56,040
Maniac 64. Oh, boy. I've already said this twice in chat, but honestly,

897
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,080
this is important in my opinion. In the final area in Super Metroid,

898
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:04,640
below the four boss statues, make sure you only save in the first save

899
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,040
room. If you save in the second one, you've already gone past a certain

900
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:12,000
point where there's a room where its door is gray and deactivated,

901
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,800
resulting in you being trapped, except for being able to complete the

902
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,120
game. This would prevent you from going back and collecting any power

903
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:22,640
ups you may have missed. Note, I learned this the hard way. I even had

904
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:27,240
all the reserve tanks and energy tanks. So, boy, you got screwed,

905
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:33,480
didn't you? Sorry, buddy. Sorry to hear it. All right, that's it for

906
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,880
e-mail. Again, if you want to send us an e-mail, mailbag at

907
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:42,200
orangelaundry.com is the place to do it. Yes. Anyways, we touched on

908
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:46,680
this a little bit, I think, last week and a few weeks before. Neo Geo

909
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,800
titles are confirmed to be coming to the Virtual Console and as soon as

910
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,440
this month. In fact, September 11th, you'll be getting a few games,

911
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,880
including Fatal Fury, Magical Lord, and God, I can't remember the last

912
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:07,320
one. World Heroes. Those are each going to cost a whopping 900 Wii

913
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:11,920
points. No word on whether they're coming to the US. I imagine at some

914
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,720
point they will. Magical Lord is fucking awesome. I'm glad to see

915
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:21,040
that's, you know, in the initial allotment there, because I remember

916
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,680
playing that a lot. For some reason, you know, these grocery chains

917
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:30,080
around here had Neo Geo machines a while back, so while my parents were

918
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,640
checking out, I would be playing Magical Lord. I would think it's

919
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:38,440
inevitable that the game's going to come at some point. Yeah. State

920
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:42,840
side, I mean. But we'll see. We shall see. Alright, let's get on with

921
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:46,960
some release dates and things that you can check out long before these

922
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,960
Neo Geo games come state side. Although, we are going to start with the

923
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,440
Japanese release dates, so I guess we're doing things a little backwards.

924
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,080
Coming out on the Xbox 360, Fatal Inertia is coming out on September

925
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:02,080
6th, and that's, again, in Japan, if you want to check that game out.

926
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,920
Going over to some other systems, on the Nintendo Wii, there's this

927
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:12,160
game called Shin Chuka Taisen, Maikel to Meme no Boken, which is

928
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,800
coming out from Starfish, and this looks to be a game. I'm trying to

929
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,760
look at some of the screenshots. Looks like a little bit of a side

930
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,400
scroller, action-y type game, like a throwback to an old, you know,

931
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:28,120
like Mario type game. That's kind of cool. I wonder if they'll bring that state side.

932
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:31,440
Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii, nothing this week, but we can go

933
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,560
over to the PlayStation 3, and I can tell you that there is another

934
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:41,200
Pachinko game coming out. There's always something coming out.

935
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,200
And then, let's see, going to the PlayStation 2. Now, there's a lot of

936
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:48,500
stuff on the PlayStation 2, including Grand Theft Auto Liberty City

937
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,840
Stories finally making its way to the Japanese PlayStation 2 this week.

938
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:56,480
Also, Dear My Son, but that's S-U-N, Sun, is coming out this week, as

939
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:02,400
well as EA Sports Rugby 08, and Willow Wisp is coming out as well on

940
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:08,220
the PlayStation 2. Going over to the Nintendo DS, Theta is coming

941
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:15,380
out this week, and also a game from Bandai called, well, let's just

942
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:17,920
call it Mahjong, because that's what it is. It's a Mahjong game.

943
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:26,440
Let's just leave it at that. Really quickly, seeing if there's anything

944
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,680
on the PSP worth mentioning, Sony's putting out a game called

945
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,200
Rezel Cross. That might be kind of interesting. It's an RPG, and it's

946
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:39,080
from Sony themselves. The script is written by the folks who did

947
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:42,280
Ark the Lad 3 and 4, so if you like Ark the Lad, you might like this

948
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,480
game. There you have it, Japan releases.

949
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:50,600
In the US, on PlayStation 2, I hope you like Naruto, because Naruto

950
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:54,880
Uzumaki Chronicles 2 is the only PS2 game coming out this week.

951
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,020
On other systems, though, let's see, 360, we've got Medal of Honor

952
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:03,240
Airborne that's also coming out on PC. Stranglehold is also coming out

953
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:07,360
on Xbox 360, both the standard and collector's edition.

954
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:12,320
On PSP and DS, Worms Open Warfare 2, because the Worms games are

955
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:16,320
awesome. And, let's see here, on PlayStation 3, you

956
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:22,600
get a big fat nothing. And then, of course, on the Wii, Pool Party,

957
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,800
and no, that's not with water, that is billiards.

958
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,240
And, let's see, also on the DS, Garfield Nightmares, which I'm sure

959
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:38,320
is awesome, and PC games, two games that I have to love, I guess.

960
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:43,200
I Love Kittens and I Love Puppies. Hooray, I Love Kittens, that sounds

961
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:48,040
like fun. Let's see, other fun games, is there a Tycoon

962
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:52,480
game this week, because I'm going to be very disappointed if there is

963
00:50:52,480 --> 00:51:00,600
not. And, no, no Tycoon game.

964
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,760
Nice, sorry to hear it. Well, going over to European release dates,

965
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,320
since Dark Sakura is not here, I still got a lot of love for you,

966
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,120
Europe. I'm going to go and look at your release dates real quick.

967
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:13,440
On the 7th, all these games on the 7th, Blazing Angels coming out on

968
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,140
Xbox 360 and the PC. This would be the secret missions from

969
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:20,060
Ubisoft. Crazy Taxi Fair Wars on the PSP.

970
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:23,640
Two Worlds makes its way to the PC and the Xbox 360.

971
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:28,600
And Valkyrie Profile 2 Slumera is coming out on the PlayStation 2.

972
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,520
God, that game came out over here like a year ago, didn't it?

973
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,760
Just about. God, it's about time you guys got it.

974
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,100
Sorry to hear it, folks. Alright, well, that's it for release dates.

975
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,760
Not that I think it's a real big disappointment that they haven't gotten

976
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,720
it yet. Well, there's some Valkyrie Profile fans

977
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:47,800
out there, I'm sure are sad. Anyways, there's an interesting game coming

978
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:54,200
out in Japan, of course, because, God forbid, you know, that something

979
00:51:54,200 --> 00:52:00,120
like this come out over here. It's created by the team, Sega's Feel the

980
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:04,880
Magic team, and it uses voice recognition technology to decipher how

981
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:13,280
people really feel. It's called Koroko Scan, and apparently they

982
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:19,680
have a hilarious clip on YouTube that's talking, they're interviewing, I guess,

983
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:25,240
a girl and her boyfriend, and they were asking, I guess, how he feels

984
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:31,280
about living together and marriage and stuff like that, and I guess it came

985
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:38,000
up that he was cheating on her or something. Well, yes.

986
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,920
I want to play with that game. That'd be fun.

987
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:45,080
Any chances might come out over here? Nope, but, hey, thank goodness that those

988
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:51,360
games are region-free, so, awesome. Oh, that's right, you said you'd have to

989
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:54,120
be able to read Japanese to actually play them, so what the hell?

990
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,880
It doesn't matter. Alright, well, this might be a little more

991
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:02,720
mainstream, and this is coming out on the Nintendo DS, I don't know when,

992
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,400
I'm assuming, sometime within the next year or so.

993
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:10,060
The Legend of Kage, Part 2. Some folks, if you don't know how to pronounce

994
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:13,520
things right, might call this Legend of Kage, because this came out years

995
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:19,200
ago on NES, but The Legend of Kage is coming out on the DS, a new sequel

996
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:24,360
to it, and this was something that was spotted in Famitsu Magazine with

997
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:28,340
some screenshots and everything, so, pretty cool.

998
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:31,080
If you like The Legend of Kage. I know that's a NES game that a lot of

999
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,160
people liked, so. I think it's on Virtual Console now, right?

1000
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,880
I think so. Possibly.

1001
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,640
I thought I saw that it was coming back to Virtual Console, so there you go.

1002
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:45,440
Well, if you are looking for a game that's not so mainstream and definitely

1003
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:50,920
a lot cheaper, you may be interested in Rose Camellia DS.

1004
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:56,120
Now if you're not familiar of Rose and Camellia, it's a women's slapping

1005
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:01,600
game that's a Flash game right now, but it is being ported over to the DS

1006
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:06,080
via the homebrew community, and actually it's funny, the guy that's doing

1007
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:11,840
it happens to be French and needs help finishing the game, but still

1008
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:16,520
though, if you want to check it out, you can definitely check out the

1009
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:24,560
free Flash game site, and it is BeyondDS.free.fr.

1010
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:28,000
For the record, that game is fucking rad. The slapping game, I love that game.

1011
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,200
Slapping game, yeah. I love the slapping game. Have you ever played

1012
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,360
the slapping game, the Flash game, Shane? I know you've been checked out

1013
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:38,200
at the show. I think I tried to play it at work once and

1014
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,520
it wouldn't work right. I'm sorry to hear it. It's a fun game.

1015
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:45,680
It sounds funny, because you slap women. But you're a woman slapping

1016
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,200
the women, so it's okay. It doesn't matter. As long as the woman is

1017
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,160
getting slapped, all is right. Wow, you can send those cards and letters

1018
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:57,840
too. What's your email? Miklatov? Anyhow. Also announced for a Nintendo

1019
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:04,040
platform, not quite as huh, but it's pretty cool nonetheless.

1020
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:09,040
Coming to the Wii, Worms, a space odyssey. It's another game in the

1021
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,260
Worms series, and of course it will be taking advantage of the Wii's motion

1022
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:16,720
control system, but what's really cool about this, online worldwide play,

1023
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,520
which is not something you've been seeing a whole lot of Nintendo releases

1024
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,640
lately, so that is certainly very promising. This was announced by an

1025
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:27,160
official press release from THQ Inc. this week. Buying it.

1026
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:31,040
You're that big a fan of Worms. I love me some Worms.

1027
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,760
Just an FYI, there is still the Worms Open Warfare 2 being made for the DS

1028
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,840
and PSP. Wow, they must still really have a fan base for these games,

1029
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,960
because they crank them out left and right. Oh yeah.

1030
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:49,760
Are you buying all of these games, Logie? No, I bought the very first one

1031
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,500
that came out on the PC years ago, and that's the last one I bought.

1032
00:55:53,500 --> 00:56:00,680
I think the last game I bought was for the PC, and it was Worms Armageddon.

1033
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,240
They do have one of the Worms games on GameTap, so that's one of the ones

1034
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,580
I've played too. I've been meaning to buy the one on Xbox Live

1035
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:12,720
Arcade, but I haven't got around to it yet. Alright.

1036
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:18,080
One game I'm definitely going to be around to buying is Manhunt 2, and of

1037
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:22,640
course people are still pissed off that the game got re-rated down to an M.

1038
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,760
They want to know why they're demanding answers, and guess what?

1039
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,080
The ESRB says, uh-uh, we ain't giving you no fucking answers.

1040
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:34,920
So here's their statement basically. The FTC, the National PTA, the Kaiser

1041
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:40,740
Family Foundation, and the Peter Hart Research team have all found that

1042
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:45,440
parents are overwhelmingly satisfied with the ESRB rating system, rather

1043
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:52,620
than publicly second-guessing what is unmistakably a strong warning to

1044
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:57,600
parents about the suitability of particular games for children, which

1045
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:04,360
presumably neither Senator Yee or the CCFC have personally reviewed.

1046
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:09,600
We feel that a more productive tact would be joining us in encouraging

1047
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:13,380
parents to take their ratings seriously when buying games for their

1048
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:17,000
children. You show them.

1049
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,320
So in other words, no, yeah, they re-rate it.

1050
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,840
What do they change to re-rate it? Well, fuck off.

1051
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:27,040
You don't get to find out. Actually, they can find out if they buy

1052
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,120
certain versions of the game in other countries and check it against

1053
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:34,360
them. Or maybe they didn't change much at all. Maybe they appealed or

1054
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,800
something and got it. It's freakin' okay. 17 and 18-year-olds, come

1055
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,520
on. We've discussed this before. There's not much maturity difference

1056
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:47,500
between a 17 and 18-year-old, okay? It's just one gets more held

1057
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:53,080
accountable to certain things. But other than that, really, and the whole

1058
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:58,400
ESRB rating system is all fucked up anyway, so big deal. It's mature now.

1059
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,880
What the fuck do you want? They just want it banned because they're

1060
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:05,000
fuckin' hypocrites. We want to ban everything. Keep our children

1061
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,280
safe. Oh my God. I'm more impressed that they did it this quick.

1062
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,080
I mean, we all thought the game was just not going to come out for like

1063
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:15,300
a year now because of this, and it seems like not even a month later,

1064
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:19,240
it's all fixed. So it makes me think whatever they change wasn't that

1065
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:22,040
much. It wasn't that much. It was probably stupid things. Remember

1066
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:26,000
when we talked about Lair last week and how they had to change stuff

1067
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,820
to get a teen rating, they couldn't show blood, but they could show

1068
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:32,920
people being burned alive. I mean, like there's a big difference there

1069
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:37,360
or something. So it's just, it's really stupid the requirements that

1070
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:42,000
they have. It's just like the, you know, MPA, it's all fucked up. But

1071
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,680
I don't know. I like how these people that haven't played the game at

1072
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:48,600
all can criticize, you know, the rating system or anything like that.

1073
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:52,960
They have no clue on what's going on, yet they're just like, oh, we want

1074
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,480
the game banned. It's horrible. They're going to be selling it to

1075
00:58:55,480 --> 00:59:01,760
children, you know, despite the fact that it's, you know, over 17. Who

1076
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,200
cares? If it's being sold to children and you're a parent, you're going

1077
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:09,360
to just be like, oh my God, he bought it. I can't do nothing. It's too

1078
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:13,560
late. Jimmy's going to go kill people now. What they need to do is just

1079
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:16,920
say, hey, where'd you get that game? I'm taking this back. Or break the

1080
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,720
disc in half or something. I don't know. You have control over your

1081
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:23,760
damn kids. Do something. It's like they act like their parents are

1082
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,200
powerless. It's like, oh no, he's got it in his hands now. I can't take

1083
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:33,880
it away from him. We're doomed. Lots of comments from chat here. Fire

1084
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:39,520
Bulma says, won't somebody think of the children? Let's see. Escapist

1085
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,960
says, maybe they just had to excise some extreme cut scenes to Manhunt

1086
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,360
2 down to an M. Son of Dad speculates, Manhunt wasn't changed. It was a

1087
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:53,480
publicity stunt. Interesting. GS 191 says, I'm 19. I don't feel any

1088
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,880
more different than when I was 17. Sure, I learned a lot of things, but

1089
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,600
these people forget that there's a lot of kids that know the difference

1090
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,920
between real and fake. Yeah, but isn't it fair to say, unfortunately,

1091
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:05,400
there's some that don't, and there's even some 20-year-olds that don't?

1092
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:09,040
Shouldn't you be more worried about your kids going and having underage

1093
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:14,360
sex and doing drugs and all sorts of things like that, rather than

1094
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,640
playing violent video games? I would think that you would be more

1095
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:21,960
encouraging of kids playing games that require them not to leave the

1096
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:26,840
house to do malicious things. I don't know about you, but I think,

1097
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:33,520
given the two choices, I'll take my kids playing violent video games.

1098
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,480
Fire Bulma in chat has a funny comment that says, my precious, unique

1099
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,400
snowflake would never do drugs. Or play these violent video games, I'm

1100
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:46,160
sure. I mean, seriously, how dumb are people? Really?

1101
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,600
Who doesn't enjoy a little bit of violence once in a while? Do you like

1102
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:53,960
violence, Shane? Yes. You do? Okay, that's good. No, only sometimes.

1103
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:57,240
Only sometimes? What types of violence do you like?

1104
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,800
The stuff that doesn't look too real. I can't stand the real stuff.

1105
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,840
Okay. All right. Just wanted to give you some... Violence against women.

1106
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:09,080
I just... Again, those cards and letters. You want to hear a funny story?

1107
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:12,480
Sorry. Sure, why not? This refers to last week when we were talking

1108
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,560
about Imagine Babies. I actually talked to the company that's making

1109
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:19,960
Imagine Babies. I think Ubisoft's putting it up. And I mentioned to them

1110
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:23,920
about the baby shaking. They did not know that.

1111
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:28,000
They didn't? I'm like, you can rock the baby with one part.

1112
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,200
I'm like, and if you shake it really fast, you're actually shaking babies.

1113
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:34,520
So it was fascinating. I don't want them to change that.

1114
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,280
They're not going to change that. Okay, good.

1115
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:39,800
Good job, Loki, ruining Imagine Babies. I know.

1116
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:46,600
Good job, ass. Wow, this show has gone to all sorts of places.

1117
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,040
I didn't think it would go tonight. It's because Jamie's not here to keep us

1118
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:55,720
in check and make pouty faces. And flip me off.

1119
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:59,640
A lot of controversy going around about E for All, specifically when it comes to Electronic

1120
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,680
Arts. Here's what's interesting is that there was

1121
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:05,880
word going around that Electronic Arts had dropped out of the show this week because

1122
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,560
I guess they suddenly didn't show up in some advertising material for the show, which

1123
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:14,840
started to make people go, well, gee, who's left besides Nintendo and Konami and a couple

1124
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,920
others? But Electronic Arts was contacted a little

1125
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:23,920
later in the week, and EA has reaffirmed that, yes, they are going to E for All.

1126
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:28,100
So if you want a chance to play Rock Band early, you still have a chance, because obviously

1127
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:31,400
if EA is going, they're bringing that game with them, because they've trucked it everywhere

1128
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:36,560
the past couple months. As long as the show is still on and my badge

1129
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:40,000
forwards to my new address, like it should, I am planning to go to E for All.

1130
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,640
I've already registered and all that crap and got the time off work, so...

1131
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:46,320
I haven't registered yet, but I don't know if the wife would let me.

1132
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:50,600
I should just register and just not go. Well, do whatever you want, but I'm going

1133
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:55,120
to try and go, and if All Games is doing anything down there, I'm sure I'll hang with them.

1134
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:58,960
Because otherwise I don't want to have to go by myself. It's going to be sad.

1135
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:03,220
Shane, I might have to drag you with me if you can. Go. I don't know. Depending on what's

1136
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:07,720
going on. Alright, well anything else in this Part A?

1137
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:10,560
We're kind of running a short show tonight. I don't know what's up with that.

1138
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,000
Oh, that's just Part A. That's just Part A. That's right. There's

1139
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,040
plenty more to come. Tonight in Part B, we're going to be playing

1140
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:19,240
a little bit of Beat the Host. So you might want to get your phones nearby

1141
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:23,720
or your Skype line ready, because we'll be taking the first caller to play Beat the Host.

1142
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,860
Not now, but when we come back and we tell you to call in.

1143
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:28,560
And if you haven't heard Beat the Host, it's a lot of fun.

1144
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:32,020
Stay tuned for tonight's Beat the Host. We'll be right back in a little bit with

1145
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:34,020
more of Orange Lounge Radio.
