00:00:14,037 --> 00:00:23,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, September 2nd, 2007, Xbox Live gets a Labor Day sale, PlayStation gets a SingStar bundle, and an old PC gaming classic is now free.

2
00:00:31,576 --> 00:00:36,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,118 --> 00:00:41,160
[SPEAKER_03]: We are that video game podcast dedicated to gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,562
[SPEAKER_03]: We are independently made and produced out of lovely Sacramento, California.

5
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:53,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining you guys as always, my name is Rob Roberts and not joining us tonight sadly, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:56,987
[SPEAKER_03]: She's not here tonight, she's celebrating her anniversary with her man Dan.

7
00:00:57,408 --> 00:01:00,229
[SPEAKER_03]: But joining us as always, say hello to Loki.

8
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:01,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

9
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:02,169
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, Loki?

10
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:03,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fine.

11
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,690
[SPEAKER_03]: You're fine?

12
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,090
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounded a little bit forced.

13
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:08,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing okay.

14
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:09,251
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you do?

15
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:09,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

16
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:11,931
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we've downgraded from fine to okay.

17
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:12,391
[SPEAKER_03]: What gives?

18
00:01:13,712 --> 00:01:16,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm running low of soda in this cup here.

19
00:01:16,552 --> 00:01:18,233
[SPEAKER_02]: But luckily, I brought two backups.

20
00:01:18,973 --> 00:01:20,553
[SPEAKER_03]: How much soda do you bring to this program?

21
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:21,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Two cans.

22
00:01:21,473 --> 00:01:21,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Two cans.

23
00:01:22,253 --> 00:01:26,494
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, also joining us tonight, say hello to Miklatov, who is filling in in the big blue chair tonight.

24
00:01:26,614 --> 00:01:27,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

25
00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:27,875
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, Miklatov?

26
00:01:28,035 --> 00:01:28,535
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fine.

27
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:29,555
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you playing there on your PSP?

28
00:01:30,128 --> 00:01:31,329
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

29
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:50,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you missed that one, I'm sorry to say.

30
00:02:09,884 --> 00:02:16,627
[SPEAKER_03]: But Operator 11 has some funky rules and it's supposedly going to shut off after 40 minutes and so we won't be able to archive until Part B again.

31
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:20,728
[SPEAKER_03]: But the good news is that Operator 11 saves an archive of the file for a long time.

32
00:02:20,768 --> 00:02:28,931
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're listening to the podcast and you wondered to yourself, I wonder what this looks like being taped live, you can go over to Operator11.com and look for our feed on there and see it.

33
00:02:29,391 --> 00:02:31,732
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see how fat all the hosts look on camera.

34
00:02:31,872 --> 00:02:33,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can love us long time.

35
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:39,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you can I just named my island in Katamari What is your island in Katamari?

36
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:41,732
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

37
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,823
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm playing me and my Katamari.

38
00:03:08,543 --> 00:03:09,504
[SPEAKER_01]: And how is it?

39
00:03:09,804 --> 00:03:11,766
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate the controls a lot.

40
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:17,551
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really bad to control, but it's still funny, and that's what really counts in Katamari.

41
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:19,052
[SPEAKER_03]: And what else have you been playing this week?

42
00:03:19,092 --> 00:03:23,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Metroid Prime 3, which is the coolest.

43
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and what do you like about Metroid Prime 3?

44
00:03:26,398 --> 00:03:27,519
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun.

45
00:03:28,981 --> 00:03:31,182
[SPEAKER_03]: What a very descriptive answer you're giving us here.

46
00:03:31,203 --> 00:03:32,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that was a terrible question.

47
00:03:34,107 --> 00:03:37,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, why do you think Metroid Prime 3 is so fun?

48
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,991
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it about the game that appeals to you?

49
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:57,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I like the fact that the controls are really cool and I like the Metroid Prime series and I like the fact that, spoilers are coming up, I got to fight Ridley and it was really fun and I had to shoot him in his mouth and I was falling down this big shaft the whole time and it was really cool.

50
00:03:59,578 --> 00:04:01,199
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to fight somebody while you're falling down?

51
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:01,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

52
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a chance that you'll ever hit the ground?

53
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:04,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.

54
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,060
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you fall forever until you beat Ridley or Ridley kills you.

55
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,560
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

56
00:04:08,721 --> 00:04:10,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, is there anything else you're giving me?

57
00:04:10,861 --> 00:04:13,102
[SPEAKER_01]: I started playing Suikoden V again.

58
00:04:14,402 --> 00:04:19,004
[SPEAKER_01]: I've owned it since it came out, and I worked on it, but I never actually played it really.

59
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:20,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you say what you did on the game?

60
00:04:20,324 --> 00:04:21,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've said before.

61
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:22,785
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember.

62
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:23,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.

63
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:25,986
[SPEAKER_03]: There's secrets you can say and things you can't say on air.

64
00:04:26,006 --> 00:04:26,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

65
00:04:27,661 --> 00:04:29,964
[SPEAKER_01]: and yeah, I'm just now starting to play it.

66
00:04:30,405 --> 00:04:33,349
[SPEAKER_03]: See, if I asked you if there was a Suikoden VI, could you talk about that?

67
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:35,071
[SPEAKER_01]: I could not talk about that.

68
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:36,853
[SPEAKER_03]: You can neither confirm nor deny those reports?

69
00:04:36,873 --> 00:04:37,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot.

70
00:04:37,534 --> 00:04:38,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, fine, fair enough.

71
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:39,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?

72
00:04:41,018 --> 00:04:41,178
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

73
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's go over to Loki.

74
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:46,285
[SPEAKER_03]: And while Loki talks about his gaming week, I'm going to go grab another cookie.

75
00:04:46,837 --> 00:04:47,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want a peanut butter cookie, Loki?

76
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:49,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I want a peanut butter cookie.

77
00:04:49,377 --> 00:04:50,358
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm going to go get that.

78
00:04:50,378 --> 00:04:50,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid cookies.

79
00:04:51,318 --> 00:04:52,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, tell us about your gaming week.

80
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:55,919
[SPEAKER_02]: My gaming week was a lot of Xbox 360 stuff.

81
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:01,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a lot of demos, including some stuff I've already played before, like beautiful Katamari.

82
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Ace Combat 6, I think I tried a little bit of Juice 2 and didn't like that still.

83
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:15,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, of course, I played Bioshock, which is still awesome and continues to get even more awesome as I play it.

84
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,201
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely, ooh, cookie.

85
00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:23,424
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see, other games I've played, Call of Duty 4.

86
00:05:23,684 --> 00:05:25,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually got to try a little bit of the multiplayer beta.

87
00:05:26,765 --> 00:05:29,647
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had no doubts going into it that the game's going to be awesome.

88
00:05:29,907 --> 00:05:31,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just amazing.

89
00:05:32,088 --> 00:05:33,649
[SPEAKER_02]: It still plays like Call of Duty 2 and 3.

90
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:40,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like how they've kind of updated the radar a little bit so you can actually kind of get a better idea where people are firing from.

91
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:41,973
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was pretty cool.

92
00:05:41,993 --> 00:05:45,315
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the replays of when you get killed, they were pretty cool.

93
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:47,314
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's neat.

94
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,336
[SPEAKER_02]: And then other stuff.

95
00:05:49,356 --> 00:05:53,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually played more Settlers of Catan on Xbox Live Arcade.

96
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:59,704
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought about... Oh, I played Street Trace New York.

97
00:06:00,384 --> 00:06:05,008
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that hoverboard racing combat game or something.

98
00:06:05,388 --> 00:06:06,649
[SPEAKER_02]: That game's really weird.

99
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:12,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of reminds me of crossing Sonic Riders with that crappy...

100
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:16,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it that bumper car game that came with Windows 98 or something?

101
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even remember what the hell that's called.

102
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:19,882
[SPEAKER_02]: But something like that.

103
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:22,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Not recommending that game, though.

104
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,764
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite boring.

105
00:06:24,104 --> 00:06:26,846
[SPEAKER_02]: But I tried the demo, and that was kind of fun.

106
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:29,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

107
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:33,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Other stuff on PSP, I was playing a lot of We Love Katamari.

108
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,551
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know why.

109
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:41,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I absolutely hate the control in that game, but I'm stuck playing it and loving it.

110
00:06:42,177 --> 00:06:45,040
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I wish they would do is just port that to PlayStation 2.

111
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know they like doing those ports from PSP to PlayStation 2.

112
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Just do that.

113
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:53,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'll spend the 20 bucks to actually buy the game.

114
00:06:53,268 --> 00:06:57,091
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think that's what they need to do to make at least the controls a little bit better.

115
00:06:58,232 --> 00:07:01,615
[SPEAKER_02]: And other than that, I believe that was my gaming week.

116
00:07:01,715 --> 00:07:03,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Saints Row Multiplayer.

117
00:07:03,577 --> 00:07:06,620
[SPEAKER_02]: We finally, and I wish I had pictures because I haven't, you know...

118
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:09,052
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

119
00:07:34,707 --> 00:07:37,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, they'll fix that with a sequel.

120
00:07:38,168 --> 00:07:38,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

121
00:07:38,648 --> 00:07:43,210
[SPEAKER_02]: But hopefully, I'll get some actual pictures of the setup.

122
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:52,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still putting the 360s in clear cases, which, by the way, if I were to review the clear cases I bought, they absolutely suck, but they look pretty.

123
00:07:54,793 --> 00:07:55,574
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my gaming week.

124
00:07:55,594 --> 00:07:56,854
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a hell of a lot of gaming week.

125
00:07:57,554 --> 00:08:01,415
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of comments going on in the chat room here at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

126
00:08:01,455 --> 00:08:04,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, our chat room location is chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

127
00:08:04,595 --> 00:08:08,216
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys are in the Operator 11 chat, since we are doing the video tonight, I just want to get out there.

128
00:08:08,576 --> 00:08:13,177
[SPEAKER_03]: We do not read the Op 11 chat because it's on a laptop that's on the other side of the room and it's hard for us to read.

129
00:08:13,197 --> 00:08:13,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot one.

130
00:08:13,557 --> 00:08:14,557
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be in our regular chat room.

131
00:08:14,617 --> 00:08:14,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

132
00:08:14,857 --> 00:08:16,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I play Contra 4 for the DS.

133
00:08:16,517 --> 00:08:17,157
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you do that?

134
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:22,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Our Konami rep brought in a DS with a dev thing in it.

135
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:23,238
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of important.

136
00:08:24,179 --> 00:08:24,739
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big one.

137
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:25,699
[SPEAKER_02]: How is Contra 4?

138
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:26,879
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

139
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:31,452
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exactly like you would imagine a sequel to Contra 3 being.

140
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:36,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's true 2D side-scrolling action.

141
00:08:36,256 --> 00:08:37,757
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Contra.

142
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:38,457
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

143
00:08:38,998 --> 00:08:45,483
[SPEAKER_02]: And not like that sort of awesome that was Neo-Contra and stuff like that.

144
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,533
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so that was pretty cool.

145
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:54,822
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing, I didn't play this game, but I dogged on it last week, Cruisin' for the Wii.

146
00:08:55,142 --> 00:08:59,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually saw the game in motion in a trailer, and it looked...

147
00:09:00,729 --> 00:09:02,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Not as bad, let me put it that way.

148
00:09:02,712 --> 00:09:04,654
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked very low poly count.

149
00:09:05,135 --> 00:09:09,922
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost looked like a DS game ported to the Wii, but it was running at 60 frames per second.

150
00:09:10,062 --> 00:09:15,509
[SPEAKER_02]: So while it may not have been too pretty to look at, it was really smooth and looked pretty fun.

151
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,393
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's cheap enough, I may try it.

152
00:09:18,945 --> 00:09:22,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go back to Contra 4 for a minute because this is a game a lot of people are very excited about.

153
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,690
[SPEAKER_03]: How does it use the vertical?

154
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,231
[SPEAKER_03]: How does it use the two screens?

155
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just a very vertical game?

156
00:09:27,552 --> 00:09:28,513
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very vertical game.

157
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:30,674
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very tall.

158
00:09:30,694 --> 00:09:40,702
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'll see stuff falling down and you basically get to shoot at stuff, there's a grappling hook in it so you can grapple with stuff and crawl along bars and whatnot.

159
00:09:40,722 --> 00:09:42,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it use a touchscreen at all or did they just say fuck it?

160
00:09:43,827 --> 00:09:47,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, for the brief time that I had with the game, it did not use a touchscreen.

161
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:51,490
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have no idea if they have the top-down modes like they had in the old Super Nintendo Contra?

162
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they do, but it would be cool if they did.

163
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:54,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

164
00:09:55,312 --> 00:09:55,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

165
00:09:56,452 --> 00:09:58,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, um... Wait, wait, wait.

166
00:09:58,673 --> 00:09:58,873
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

167
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:01,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's tell everybody what my new island name is.

168
00:10:02,174 --> 00:10:04,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, on me and my Katamari, what did you name it?

169
00:10:04,215 --> 00:10:05,755
[SPEAKER_01]: I named it Pen Island.

170
00:10:06,976 --> 00:10:07,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Pen Island.

171
00:10:09,397 --> 00:10:10,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about that one for a minute.

172
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:11,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Pen Island.

173
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:12,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Pen Island.

174
00:10:12,762 --> 00:10:16,646
[SPEAKER_03]: P-E-N-I-S-L-A-N-D P-E-N-I-S-L-A-N-D

175
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:35,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get scared by BioShock?

176
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:09,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought he was dead at first, you know, the first time they played through it, and then the second time I knew he was going to be there, so I turned around and just stood there for a second, and then he finally attacked me, but, you know, it was kind of freaky, you know, you turn around and all of a sudden, boom, there's someone there.

177
00:11:10,343 --> 00:11:13,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Piker Uno says, I got scared by the demo of Bioshock.

178
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:15,186
[SPEAKER_03]: I did too a little bit, I have to admit.

179
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:17,927
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a little bit scared from just the demo alone, because it's crazy.

180
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:27,311
[SPEAKER_02]: The game gets so awesome, and I can't help but think Andrew Ryan, or can't imagine Andrew Ryan, the main guy who built this whole city, as Walt Disney.

181
00:11:28,412 --> 00:11:32,394
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I can replace Walt Disney in this, and just like...

182
00:11:33,755 --> 00:11:34,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

183
00:11:34,836 --> 00:11:38,258
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to make me not want to go back to Disneyland, and that makes me sad, because I love Disneyland.

184
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:41,420
[SPEAKER_02]: It just reminds me, Andrew Ryan just reminds me of Walt Disney.

185
00:11:42,821 --> 00:11:44,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like a really weird version of Walt Disney.

186
00:11:44,843 --> 00:11:46,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they based it off him, who knows?

187
00:11:47,304 --> 00:11:52,928
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was hoping to get some emails from people who didn't like Bioshock, but I didn't see anything in the mailbag when I last checked.

188
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:53,569
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

189
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:57,651
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll open up the email bag a little later and let you know if we heard from any people that didn't like Bioshock.

190
00:11:58,472 --> 00:11:58,692
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

191
00:11:59,723 --> 00:12:02,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's go ahead and go on to my gaming week.

192
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:03,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to talk about my gaming week.

193
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:20,021
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

194
00:12:35,962 --> 00:12:40,429
[SPEAKER_03]: But this third game, I have to admit, the gimmicky controls are actually pretty awesome.

195
00:12:41,191 --> 00:12:44,816
[SPEAKER_03]: And done pretty well considering the limited amount of buttons that a Wii controller has.

196
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:46,018
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty fun.

197
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:49,945
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also like the fact that Metroid Prime 3 kind of breaks the mold of...

198
00:12:50,498 --> 00:12:51,498
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

199
00:13:20,746 --> 00:13:28,732
[SPEAKER_01]: The scanning in Metroid Prime 3, it's not to tell you what's going on, it's to tell you now what you need to do to get through this room.

200
00:13:28,772 --> 00:13:34,276
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like, oh, you know, there's lore stuff you can read, but... It's not mandatory.

201
00:13:34,296 --> 00:13:34,977
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not mandatory.

202
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:44,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I did notice it was a little easier to get into story-wise than 1 or 2 was, because you could go up and you could talk to people, and it kind of made the story a little better for me.

203
00:13:45,465 --> 00:13:47,186
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't just scanning things and reading things.

204
00:13:48,130 --> 00:14:03,972
[SPEAKER_03]: also I will point out though scanning things appears to be the way that you get most of the tokens in the game I know there hasn't been a lot of talk about the tokens which a couple weeks ago was labeled by a lot of the big game blogs as like Metroid Prime's achievement system but it's not really achievements the tokens that you unlock

205
00:14:04,352 --> 00:14:05,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

206
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:33,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, it uses WeConnect24 because for every 100 enemies you kill, you get a green token, and you can send the green tokens to other people, and they can use them.

207
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:37,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I guess, no, it's a black token when you send it to someone else's green, or something like that.

208
00:14:37,392 --> 00:14:38,853
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have to use friend codes to make that work.

209
00:14:41,475 --> 00:14:46,018
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you said, Shane, you are pretty sure you got an actual achievement in the game or something.

210
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:46,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

211
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,220
[SPEAKER_01]: I was using my ice missile.

212
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, while I'm talking, smell this alcohol.

213
00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:52,703
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk about the alcohol in a minute, folks.

214
00:14:53,964 --> 00:14:57,346
[SPEAKER_01]: I was using the ice missile on just enemies randomly.

215
00:14:58,907 --> 00:14:59,988
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to drink it first.

216
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:00,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.

217
00:15:00,688 --> 00:15:02,469
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm going to drink it first.

218
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

219
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:32,725
[SPEAKER_01]: and like I used the ice missile on some lizard thing and once I did that like a little one of the little cards you get for every hundred kills and I guess for certain random tasks you do came up and was like chilled lizard or something like that like you know a terrible achievement name and it was cool and that's I like that it's achievements and you know what you can do with that nothing absolutely nothing just like the Xbox 360 achievements

220
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:35,409
[SPEAKER_03]: So, anyway.

221
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:41,291
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, the liquor talk is because it is a three-day weekend, so some of us have chosen to do a little drinking tonight.

222
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:44,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Which leads me to the responsibility spiel.

223
00:15:44,992 --> 00:15:49,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we are all over 21, and Matt's not drinking tonight because he didn't find a designated driver.

224
00:15:50,113 --> 00:15:51,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have, but I figured that... Loser?

225
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:52,813
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not into it tonight.

226
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:57,855
[SPEAKER_02]: You said you were sick and were possibly not going to be drinking, so that's why I didn't want to be the only one.

227
00:15:58,095 --> 00:16:02,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I have been sick, but I figure it's only Tylenol that I'm taking, so I should be okay, right?

228
00:16:03,036 --> 00:16:03,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

229
00:16:03,991 --> 00:16:08,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, unless you die, in which case then we would have been terribly wrong.

230
00:16:08,814 --> 00:16:10,014
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

231
00:16:10,074 --> 00:16:10,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyhow, what else?

232
00:16:11,935 --> 00:16:15,377
[SPEAKER_03]: But Shane's here and Shane's drinking, although he doesn't like his blue drink, even though he likes the smell of it.

233
00:16:15,397 --> 00:16:15,717
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.

234
00:16:15,817 --> 00:16:16,558
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the smell.

235
00:16:16,598 --> 00:16:20,080
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like drinking an alcoholic blueberry muffin to me.

236
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,501
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really weird.

237
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:23,121
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to try this one, this pomegranate thingy?

238
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:24,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't drank from it yet.

239
00:16:24,802 --> 00:16:31,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, we are all over 21 and we drink responsibly, blah, blah, blah, and kids shouldn't drink, blah, blah, blah, and so on.

240
00:16:31,646 --> 00:16:32,286
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

241
00:16:32,847 --> 00:16:33,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that any good?

242
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:39,613
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's the combination of the two, but that tastes like that gamer fuel Mountain Dew to me.

243
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:40,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

244
00:16:40,154 --> 00:16:42,720
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Pomegranate Fusion Smirnoff.

245
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,564
[SPEAKER_03]: We're taking it easy tonight, so we'll see.

246
00:16:45,342 --> 00:16:45,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Dragon

247
00:17:07,017 --> 00:17:07,858
[SPEAKER_03]: is a good game.

248
00:17:08,258 --> 00:17:09,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a great game?

249
00:17:09,739 --> 00:17:09,959
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

250
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:10,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a 10?

251
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:11,621
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

252
00:17:11,741 --> 00:17:15,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it going to leave a lot of people disappointed because they were expecting... Boo, Dragon.

253
00:17:16,044 --> 00:17:17,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, you can have your opinion in a minute.

254
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:26,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it going to leave a lot of people disappointed because you hear these big names attached to it and you were expecting greatness or like a Final Fantasy XIII or something?

255
00:17:27,192 --> 00:17:28,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's going to leave a lot of people disappointed.

256
00:17:29,074 --> 00:17:34,478
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not a bad game by any means and certainly it's the type of game that the Xbox 360 is severely lacking.

257
00:17:34,858 --> 00:17:35,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

258
00:17:58,607 --> 00:17:59,488
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

259
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:26,128
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

260
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:45,282
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

261
00:19:07,421 --> 00:19:08,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

262
00:19:28,422 --> 00:19:31,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, those little bitches aside, I mean, it is a good game.

263
00:19:31,784 --> 00:19:38,648
[SPEAKER_03]: It's certainly, if you're a fan of role-playing games and you have a 360, it's worth your time to check out because importantly it comes down to, you know, how is the game?

264
00:19:38,668 --> 00:19:39,748
[SPEAKER_03]: And the game is fine.

265
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:41,970
[SPEAKER_03]: And the music's really good and all that stuff.

266
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:47,293
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, but that gameplay is boring and it has led me to call it Boo Dragon.

267
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:56,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm noticing DJ Dysentery in chat says, because you want to hear their screams, sounds like Shane's reason for shaking babies, referring to an earlier episode of the program.

268
00:19:57,432 --> 00:19:58,853
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, just in general.

269
00:19:59,873 --> 00:20:01,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, why did you not like Blue Dragon?

270
00:20:01,795 --> 00:20:03,736
[SPEAKER_03]: You're someone that liked old RPGs, right?

271
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:09,819
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've come so far and then to be thrown this battle system that's absolutely boring.

272
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:11,100
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like...

273
00:20:12,384 --> 00:20:14,685
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, it doesn't sit right with me.

274
00:20:14,985 --> 00:20:17,425
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pacing seems slow.

275
00:20:18,126 --> 00:20:22,467
[SPEAKER_01]: And granted, this is all, the only thing I've played is the demo that was on Xbox Live.

276
00:20:22,527 --> 00:20:27,008
[SPEAKER_03]: See, now, I don't think that, I think the demo, now that I've played the actual game, the demo fucking sucks.

277
00:20:27,088 --> 00:20:30,189
[SPEAKER_03]: The demo is not a good representation of the game, I think.

278
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:36,591
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, it looks overly generic and not interesting.

279
00:20:37,551 --> 00:20:40,872
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that Maru Maru guy is like,

280
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:42,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue Drag On Boo Drag On

281
00:20:56,696 --> 00:20:58,217
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to stick with Blue Dragon.

282
00:20:58,978 --> 00:21:01,900
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya says, does Blue Dragon have the original voice?

283
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this an option?

284
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it does.

285
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:09,585
[SPEAKER_03]: You can choose the English language, a Japanese language, all with English subtitles, or you can have French language.

286
00:21:09,965 --> 00:21:14,749
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want all your characters to speak French, you can have that as well, which I'm sure is interesting.

287
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:17,170
[SPEAKER_01]: That might make the game a little better, playing it in French.

288
00:21:17,491 --> 00:21:17,851
[SPEAKER_01]: You think?

289
00:21:17,951 --> 00:21:18,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

290
00:21:18,271 --> 00:21:20,853
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that one guy's voice is still going to be very annoying.

291
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,534
[SPEAKER_03]: But it would be...

292
00:21:24,196 --> 00:21:25,337
[SPEAKER_03]: That's literally what he sounds like.

293
00:21:25,357 --> 00:21:27,998
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be French annoying, which might be cool.

294
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like Teen Girl Squad.

295
00:21:37,002 --> 00:21:41,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Escapist in chatroom says, well, now to wait for Eternal Sonata and Lost Odyssey.

296
00:21:42,205 --> 00:21:45,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Eternal Sonata is going to be awesome, but this will hold me over.

297
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:52,650
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the best thing about Blue Dragon is inside the case was a card pimping out Eternal Sonata because that's a good game.

298
00:21:54,261 --> 00:21:55,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Good demos, bad games.

299
00:22:24,332 --> 00:22:25,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Did Perfect Dark have a good demo?

300
00:22:26,453 --> 00:22:26,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

301
00:22:27,994 --> 00:22:28,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect Dark Zero, sorry.

302
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to be confused with the original Perfect Dark, sorry.

303
00:22:32,015 --> 00:22:32,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Cameo, maybe?

304
00:22:33,476 --> 00:22:34,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never played that.

305
00:22:34,557 --> 00:22:36,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Escapist says Final Fantasy XII.

306
00:22:36,297 --> 00:22:37,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I freaking love Final Fantasy XII.

307
00:22:37,478 --> 00:22:38,198
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about?

308
00:22:38,218 --> 00:22:40,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Move that person from the chatroom, because they're idiots.

309
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Fireboma says Devil Dice.

310
00:22:43,461 --> 00:22:44,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know what that is.

311
00:22:44,741 --> 00:22:46,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Piker Uno says Cameo rules.

312
00:22:46,482 --> 00:22:47,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut the fuck up.

313
00:22:48,183 --> 00:22:48,663
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.

314
00:22:48,703 --> 00:22:50,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't say it rules, but it's okay.

315
00:22:50,524 --> 00:22:51,244
[SPEAKER_03]: It rules.

316
00:22:51,384 --> 00:22:52,225
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sucking.

317
00:22:52,485 --> 00:22:53,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, uh...

318
00:22:54,002 --> 00:22:58,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into tonight's gaming news since we've talked about our gaming week for far too long.

319
00:22:58,803 --> 00:23:00,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to get into some housekeeping.

320
00:23:00,283 --> 00:23:04,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much the only thing I had to tell you guys was that we are doing a little bit of drinking tonight.

321
00:23:04,304 --> 00:23:06,645
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we sound a little off, that's why it's a three-day weekend.

322
00:23:06,665 --> 00:23:07,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

323
00:23:07,265 --> 00:23:08,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to be off, period.

324
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:13,006
[SPEAKER_03]: And that we are up on Operator 11 if you want to check us out there or the archive should be up there.

325
00:23:13,387 --> 00:23:14,847
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about this video quality though.

326
00:23:14,887 --> 00:23:16,047
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it's running really slow.

327
00:23:16,527 --> 00:23:17,007
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see though.

328
00:23:17,327 --> 00:23:18,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just moving really slow.

329
00:23:18,248 --> 00:23:19,328
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as it doesn't kill the screen.

330
00:23:20,402 --> 00:23:23,584
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're not going to play to the camera because we don't want to be a TV show.

331
00:23:23,604 --> 00:23:24,805
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still Orange Lounge Radio.

332
00:23:24,865 --> 00:23:28,868
[SPEAKER_03]: But to answer the calls of our live listeners who wanted us to get a webcam, we finally did.

333
00:23:28,888 --> 00:23:29,468
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you have it.

334
00:23:29,869 --> 00:23:30,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

335
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:30,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.

336
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,510
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really... I know.

337
00:23:34,092 --> 00:23:34,932
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really awesome.

338
00:23:34,972 --> 00:23:35,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Figure.

339
00:23:35,693 --> 00:23:35,973
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

340
00:23:35,993 --> 00:23:36,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

341
00:23:37,454 --> 00:23:37,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

342
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,795
[SPEAKER_03]: FootyMonster agrees with Final Fantasy XII.

343
00:23:39,976 --> 00:23:41,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I second Final Fantasy XII.

344
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:42,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Demo was great.

345
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:42,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Game sucked.

346
00:23:43,678 --> 00:23:44,439
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are mean.

347
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:45,700
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Final Fantasy VIII?

348
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Game was awesome.

349
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, how about Final Fantasy VIII?

350
00:23:48,117 --> 00:23:48,798
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Final Fantasy VIII.

351
00:23:48,818 --> 00:23:49,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent example.

352
00:23:49,698 --> 00:23:50,379
[SPEAKER_03]: That is such a good game.

353
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:52,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Great demo, horrible game.

354
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,381
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even remember the demo.

355
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:54,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Ruined by a battle system.

356
00:23:54,802 --> 00:23:55,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Where was the demo?

357
00:23:55,703 --> 00:23:59,525
[SPEAKER_03]: The demo was with... What did they put the Final Fantasy in?

358
00:23:59,545 --> 00:24:00,106
[SPEAKER_00]: Vagrant Story.

359
00:24:00,146 --> 00:24:00,586
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it really?

360
00:24:00,846 --> 00:24:01,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

361
00:24:01,587 --> 00:24:03,548
[SPEAKER_03]: They put the Final Fantasy VIII demo with some other Square game.

362
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:04,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that.

363
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:05,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get into the gaming news.

364
00:24:06,365 --> 00:24:07,606
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have any housekeeping otherwise.

365
00:24:08,566 --> 00:24:10,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Visit our website, orangelaunchradio.com.

366
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:15,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Leave us five-star reviews on iTunes, pretty please, or elsewhere around the web.

367
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:18,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell two people you know about our program and so on and so on.

368
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Live journal, MySpace, add us there.

369
00:24:19,831 --> 00:24:20,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Blah, blah, blah.

370
00:24:20,771 --> 00:24:21,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Gaming news.

371
00:24:21,472 --> 00:24:22,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's starting us off tonight?

372
00:24:22,412 --> 00:24:23,133
[SPEAKER_03]: You, Loki, or me?

373
00:24:23,193 --> 00:24:23,693
[SPEAKER_03]: You are.

374
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:24,173
[SPEAKER_03]: I am?

375
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:24,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, crap.

376
00:24:25,093 --> 00:24:26,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, because I have a follow-up.

377
00:24:26,594 --> 00:24:27,315
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

378
00:24:42,944 --> 00:24:45,264
[SPEAKER_03]: for the big day after Thanksgiving holiday.

379
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:48,085
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, a lot of people definitely looking forward to this game.

380
00:24:48,685 --> 00:24:50,005
[SPEAKER_03]: They call it an RPG.

381
00:24:50,085 --> 00:24:51,306
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like sci-fi.

382
00:24:52,006 --> 00:24:56,687
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks to have a little bit of first-person shooter elements in it, though.

383
00:24:56,967 --> 00:24:58,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to call it a first-person shooter, but some elements.

384
00:24:59,507 --> 00:25:04,908
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I would say, it's like what Phantasy Star Online should have been.

385
00:25:06,389 --> 00:25:06,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of.

386
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:07,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Except it's offline.

387
00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:08,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll see.

388
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:13,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, wait, Fantasy Star Online or Fantasy Star Universe?

389
00:25:13,844 --> 00:25:14,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Either.

390
00:25:14,725 --> 00:25:16,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantasy Star Online was a great game.

391
00:25:16,607 --> 00:25:19,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Universe was a piece of crap.

392
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:23,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked Universe's single player story and the fact that it was online was just a bonus.

393
00:25:24,414 --> 00:25:26,176
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little bit repetitive.

394
00:25:26,196 --> 00:25:27,737
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you that, it was a little bit repetitive.

395
00:25:27,757 --> 00:25:28,758
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't like online?

396
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:31,061
[SPEAKER_01]: It was okay.

397
00:25:31,101 --> 00:25:32,642
[SPEAKER_01]: All you do is run around and hit things.

398
00:25:32,842 --> 00:25:34,544
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun to play with voice chat.

399
00:25:35,265 --> 00:25:36,206
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun to play with other people.

400
00:25:36,226 --> 00:25:37,606
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a chat room with swords.

401
00:25:37,626 --> 00:25:38,327
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it was.

402
00:25:38,427 --> 00:25:39,487
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a chat room with swords.

403
00:25:39,527 --> 00:25:40,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

404
00:25:40,488 --> 00:25:43,429
[SPEAKER_03]: At least they didn't move as funky as they did in the old Phantasy Star Online.

405
00:25:43,469 --> 00:25:44,250
[SPEAKER_03]: At least there's that much.

406
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:48,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, something less exciting now.

407
00:25:49,112 --> 00:25:58,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently there's some pictures that leaked out on Flickr of a new Xbox Live arcade game featuring the Toyota Yaris.

408
00:25:58,737 --> 00:26:03,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, those wonderful commercials featuring the car doing stupid things yet not really talking about the car.

409
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:04,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

410
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:07,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, it's going to be an adver game.

411
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:11,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, this was at, I think, some Toyota event.

412
00:26:13,164 --> 00:26:16,927
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we don't pay for this, because I sure as hell am not going to pay for this.

413
00:26:18,528 --> 00:26:21,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, is this a racing game, or what the hell would you do?

414
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,751
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a racing game.

415
00:26:22,771 --> 00:26:23,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there screenshots?

416
00:26:23,911 --> 00:26:25,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's screenshots of...

417
00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:31,252
[SPEAKER_02]: A shot of people playing the game, but it doesn't really show much.

418
00:26:31,332 --> 00:26:35,134
[SPEAKER_02]: It was at the Evolution FGC EVO West 2007 event.

419
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:39,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.

420
00:26:40,457 --> 00:26:45,981
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really show me much, and I could care less that this game's coming out.

421
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:47,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you know what though?

422
00:26:47,598 --> 00:26:49,120
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's free, it's free.

423
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,343
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's free and it's a decent racing game, I'm all about that.

424
00:26:52,463 --> 00:26:53,364
[SPEAKER_03]: No, here it is for you.

425
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:58,228
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's free and you can get achievement points from it, you'll totally play it until you unlock everything.

426
00:26:58,388 --> 00:27:00,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, shut up.

427
00:27:00,771 --> 00:27:03,693
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what should be an unlockable feature in a Toyota racing game though?

428
00:27:04,034 --> 00:27:05,475
[SPEAKER_03]: To be able to race Priuses.

429
00:27:05,535 --> 00:27:06,276
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.

430
00:27:07,737 --> 00:27:08,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you think?

431
00:27:08,258 --> 00:27:09,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Al Gore's Sun Mode?

432
00:27:09,939 --> 00:27:10,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't that be fun?

433
00:27:12,435 --> 00:27:13,376
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

434
00:27:28,627 --> 00:27:33,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, like Joust from 1983 or whenever that game came out.

435
00:27:33,431 --> 00:27:39,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember when you had the little lance and you tried to stab the pterodactyl in the mouth and you hit the button to flap around?

436
00:27:39,897 --> 00:27:41,778
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a pretty fun game to play two-player.

437
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,140
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's on Xbox Live.

438
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,743
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, they are going to make Joust the movie.

439
00:27:47,063 --> 00:27:50,526
[SPEAKER_03]: It's being made by producers Christine Peters and Michael Cerenzi.

440
00:27:50,866 --> 00:27:55,070
[SPEAKER_03]: They have worked on such notable films as Blackout and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.

441
00:27:55,751 --> 00:27:55,951
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

442
00:27:57,628 --> 00:27:57,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

443
00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:00,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a quote from Sirinzi.

444
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:04,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Joust is an arcade game that's as old as Pac-Man and has global awareness.

445
00:28:05,294 --> 00:28:10,878
[SPEAKER_03]: We took one element of the game and the brand itself and built a whole new world around it for the film.

446
00:28:11,818 --> 00:28:13,840
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can guess what that element's going to be.

447
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:18,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it's the element of the hands coming up from the lava to pull people in the lava because that was always cool.

448
00:28:19,544 --> 00:28:24,428
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe they'll pull these producers in and make them not make this movie because it's probably going to be bad.

449
00:28:25,057 --> 00:28:32,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see one of those, I don't know, just like a pseudo-futuristic jousting movie.

450
00:28:33,283 --> 00:28:35,004
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be boring is what it is.

451
00:28:35,064 --> 00:28:36,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how to lose a guy in 10 days?

452
00:28:37,085 --> 00:28:42,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortunately, I got dragged to that, and that was a horrible movie, so I don't know.

453
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,828
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a dumb idea.

454
00:28:45,249 --> 00:28:45,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

455
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:48,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Going to our chat room, chat.orange.radio.com.

456
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:51,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Claw says, a movie about people riding on giant ostriches.

457
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Tetsuya says, ostriches don't fly.

458
00:28:54,591 --> 00:28:57,112
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dark Knight says, fail in its future.

459
00:28:58,032 --> 00:28:58,472
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

460
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:04,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Escapist says, Kate Hudson and her ostrich bicker for half the movie than fall in love.

461
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that I'd pay to see.

462
00:29:09,241 --> 00:29:14,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, there's an interesting rumor going on regarding Guitar Hero 3.

463
00:29:15,743 --> 00:29:29,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, another artist is in talks with Activision and Red Octane regarding being in Guitar Hero 3 as one of the Legends of Rock artists.

464
00:29:29,498 --> 00:29:31,680
[SPEAKER_02]: to join up with the other people in there.

465
00:29:32,421 --> 00:29:35,243
[SPEAKER_02]: That person is Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine.

466
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:38,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, obviously going to be dueling against him.

467
00:29:39,187 --> 00:29:44,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I think right now it's still, they're in talks, but hasn't fully committed yet.

468
00:29:46,173 --> 00:29:49,096
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's kind of neat.

469
00:29:49,116 --> 00:29:53,640
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting down the line here, so if they're going to put him in there, it's going to have to be pretty soon.

470
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:57,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, isn't that game coming out like next month or something?

471
00:29:57,194 --> 00:29:58,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like around Halloween.

472
00:29:58,495 --> 00:29:58,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

473
00:29:59,755 --> 00:30:01,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they just maybe holding on to some secrets?

474
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:06,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I can't imagine that there's too much development going into that game.

475
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:16,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you don't really have to change that much other than putting songs in there and creating the player models for these people that they're getting in there.

476
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:17,700
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

477
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, coming soon to the Xbox Live Video Marketplace, Family Guy.

478
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:23,927
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

479
00:30:24,247 --> 00:30:26,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming on September 2nd.

480
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Today?

481
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that today or tomorrow?

482
00:30:28,752 --> 00:30:29,172
[SPEAKER_02]: That's today.

483
00:30:29,192 --> 00:30:29,753
[SPEAKER_03]: That's today.

484
00:30:29,773 --> 00:30:30,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, holy crap.

485
00:30:31,167 --> 00:30:33,029
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out today on Xbox Live Marketplace.

486
00:30:33,069 --> 00:30:33,910
[SPEAKER_03]: That's freaking sweet.

487
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:42,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Stewie Griffin, The Untold Story, and I believe episodes from, I don't know if it's, is it every episode that's coming up on Xbox Live?

488
00:30:42,918 --> 00:30:43,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is.

489
00:30:43,698 --> 00:30:44,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just save you some time.

490
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not download Stewie Griffin, The Untold Story, whatever that is.

491
00:30:48,683 --> 00:30:49,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that bad?

492
00:30:49,524 --> 00:30:50,184
[SPEAKER_02]: It is horrible.

493
00:30:50,244 --> 00:30:54,849
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just three episodes strung together, and it feels like three episodes.

494
00:30:54,909 --> 00:30:55,629
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not good.

495
00:30:57,111 --> 00:30:57,451
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um.

496
00:30:58,977 --> 00:31:04,256
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that they decided to put this on the marketplace at the height of its popularity.

497
00:31:05,475 --> 00:31:06,115
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

498
00:31:33,587 --> 00:31:34,968
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're still watching the old episodes?

499
00:31:34,988 --> 00:31:37,429
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm watching, well, their older episodes.

500
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:40,391
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically when I don't get to catch the new episodes when they come out on Fox.

501
00:31:40,411 --> 00:31:42,172
[SPEAKER_02]: They play them a few weeks later on Cartoon Network.

502
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:50,317
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if you watch Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, your standards for entertainment are a lot lower than most people.

503
00:31:51,097 --> 00:31:56,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, god damn, I don't know how some of those shows survive on their late-night stoners watching that.

504
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom Goes to the Mayor?

505
00:31:57,781 --> 00:32:00,062
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's stuff that's a lot weirder than that now.

506
00:32:00,082 --> 00:32:02,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when that was scraping at the bottom of the barrel.

507
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:02,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's

508
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:04,837
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot worse.

509
00:32:04,857 --> 00:32:13,200
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually have some, what, there's like some, like, perfect hair, or like, woman with perfect hair, and it's like some weird perverted guy, and some anime chick, or some, I don't know.

510
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:23,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, um, so, speaking of, uh, weird Japanese stuff, there's that Dreamcast shoot-em-up game that was, um, coming out, I guess, next year.

511
00:32:24,163 --> 00:32:29,024
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also coming out on Xbox Live Arcade in Japan, and so, um,

512
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty interesting.

513
00:32:31,021 --> 00:32:34,524
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's one of the games called Trigger Heart Alexia.

514
00:32:35,365 --> 00:32:37,747
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

515
00:32:38,347 --> 00:32:45,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's the team behind a Sega Saturn shooter game called Shinru.

516
00:32:45,393 --> 00:32:48,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably butchered that.

517
00:32:50,058 --> 00:32:51,699
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty awesome.

518
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:55,102
[SPEAKER_02]: I will definitely be using my Japanese account to buy that game.

519
00:32:56,636 --> 00:33:00,177
[SPEAKER_03]: If you buy a game on the Japanese Xbox Live accounts, can you play it on the American accounts?

520
00:33:00,598 --> 00:33:01,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it work that way?

521
00:33:02,698 --> 00:33:03,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

522
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:10,921
[SPEAKER_02]: What you can do is you can download the demo on the Japanese account, and then you register it on the U.S.

523
00:33:10,982 --> 00:33:11,282
[SPEAKER_02]: account.

524
00:33:12,302 --> 00:33:18,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, if you download a game and you purchase it on another account, it's a demo on the other accounts.

525
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:24,887
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you can do is just register it on... I downloaded it on the Japanese account, downloaded the demo, and then registered it on the U.S.

526
00:33:24,987 --> 00:33:25,067
[SPEAKER_02]: one.

527
00:33:25,635 --> 00:33:26,275
[SPEAKER_02]: That should work.

528
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:27,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

529
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:27,496
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.

530
00:33:28,316 --> 00:33:28,696
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

531
00:33:30,057 --> 00:33:32,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Also coming to Xbox Live Arcade very soon.

532
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:33,638
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in this next week.

533
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:41,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Fatal Fury Special finally makes its way to Xbox Live Arcade, which I'm actually pretty excited about because Fatal Fury Special is a game I actually really enjoyed back in the day.

534
00:33:41,901 --> 00:33:44,983
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm excited to see this game finally make its way to Xbox Live.

535
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Cyberball 2072.

536
00:33:46,763 --> 00:33:51,245
[SPEAKER_03]: This was not a game I'm so fond of, but I bet there's a lot of people out there that are into this game.

537
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:55,953
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that futuristic football game that Atari put out many years ago.

538
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:59,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it runs on the same hardware as games like 720, and those games did.

539
00:34:00,137 --> 00:34:02,238
[SPEAKER_03]: So that game is coming out to Xbox Live Marketplace.

540
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:10,325
[SPEAKER_03]: What should be also noted, though, is that there's a Labor Day sale going on on Xbox Live Marketplace right now, and you can get certain games for half price.

541
00:34:10,725 --> 00:34:18,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Small Arms and Zuma are 400 Microsoft points apiece this weekend, and Gauntlet and Dig Dug are 200 points a pop.

542
00:34:19,653 --> 00:34:21,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Dig Dug is a classic, though.

543
00:34:21,274 --> 00:34:21,655
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

544
00:34:21,675 --> 00:34:24,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it depends how strongly you feel about retro titles.

545
00:34:24,137 --> 00:34:24,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

546
00:34:46,272 --> 00:34:58,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, there are some pictures that leaked out, or I wouldn't really say leaked out, went out on the internet, showing that, yes, the elites can also crap out as well and get the wonderful three rings of death.

547
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, I'm not too surprised, though, seeing that they're showing, I guess, a kiosk.

548
00:35:05,364 --> 00:35:11,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I'm not sure what kind of ventilation those kiosks have, but just looking at it, I mean, it doesn't look like there's much airflow in that at all.

549
00:35:12,228 --> 00:35:15,410
[SPEAKER_02]: And depending on what they're running, no wonder that thing overheated, so...

550
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:18,912
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

551
00:35:18,932 --> 00:35:20,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 360s die, they'll get replaced.

552
00:35:21,854 --> 00:35:22,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Live.

553
00:35:23,915 --> 00:35:26,857
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess as long as they give the three-year warranty with those, right?

554
00:35:26,897 --> 00:35:28,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, they still do the warranties on all of them.

555
00:35:28,798 --> 00:35:34,641
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, apparently they're stepping up things to make sure that their turnaround time's a lot less, but...

556
00:35:35,595 --> 00:35:38,517
[SPEAKER_03]: And aren't they like giving away free Xbox Live or something with that too?

557
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:39,157
[SPEAKER_02]: They are.

558
00:35:39,197 --> 00:35:46,201
[SPEAKER_02]: They're giving away when you actually return the system, you'll get a free card for one month of Xbox Live.

559
00:35:46,982 --> 00:35:48,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Valued at probably like five bucks.

560
00:35:49,703 --> 00:35:53,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, is that something that you can extend your current Xbox Live account with?

561
00:35:55,366 --> 00:35:57,448
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if you can extend your current one.

562
00:35:57,648 --> 00:36:03,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I would imagine you would because it's just those redeemable cards, the gold subscriptions.

563
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:04,592
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

564
00:36:05,558 --> 00:36:07,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.

565
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:11,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

566
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:14,940
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I'm looking forward to playing on the 360 at some point is Tekken 6.

567
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully it's coming to the 360.

568
00:36:17,181 --> 00:36:17,701
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, yep.

569
00:36:17,841 --> 00:36:19,861
[SPEAKER_03]: I seem to remember they announced it's coming to both systems.

570
00:36:21,382 --> 00:36:23,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's coming to the 360 yet.

571
00:36:23,102 --> 00:36:23,662
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

572
00:36:24,462 --> 00:36:28,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think that the arcade game is actually running off of PlayStation 3 hardware.

573
00:36:29,924 --> 00:36:30,284
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

574
00:36:30,624 --> 00:36:32,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyway, Tekken 6 is still on its way.

575
00:36:32,464 --> 00:36:35,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably have a PS3 by then anyway.

576
00:36:36,896 --> 00:36:39,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Tatooine says, are you sure you're not thinking of Virtua Fighter 5?

577
00:36:39,338 --> 00:36:39,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I am.

578
00:36:39,918 --> 00:36:41,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Virtua Fighter 5 is coming out in October.

579
00:36:42,259 --> 00:36:47,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Tekken 6 is on its way and there's a brand new fighter that's been announced for Tekken 6 and that's Bob.

580
00:36:48,424 --> 00:36:52,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, he has the very unique name of Bob.

581
00:36:52,346 --> 00:36:54,788
[SPEAKER_03]: But the cool thing about Bob, he's a chubby.

582
00:36:55,308 --> 00:37:00,612
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a chubster, and you don't see a lot of fat guys in video games, especially in fighting games.

583
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:03,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't he sort of resemble Mario with bleached hair?

584
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:04,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Kinda.

585
00:37:04,574 --> 00:37:05,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a picture of him right here.

586
00:37:05,775 --> 00:37:07,456
[SPEAKER_03]: He does kind of look like Mario with bleached hair.

587
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:10,518
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got the blue jeans and the red shirt and suspenders, and then bleached hair.

588
00:37:11,419 --> 00:37:19,304
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, the only fat guys I can think of in video game history would be like, you know, Raiden from, I think he was in one of the Neo Geo fighting games.

589
00:37:19,344 --> 00:37:21,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he was in the first Fatal Fury, I think.

590
00:37:22,546 --> 00:37:24,968
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was, what other big fat guys were there?

591
00:37:25,422 --> 00:37:54,544
[SPEAKER_03]: E-Honda E-Honda, but he wasn't fat, he was He was just a sumo wrestler Yeah There you go Karnov is what Drew Nami says in chats, there you go Yes, I guess he's a stereotypical American, according to Nintendo Maniac 64 According to Japanese Arcadia Magazine, who actually kind of broke the news on this Bob used to be into conventional beauty, but he got frustrated by how his size limited him, so he got super fat You go, boy

592
00:37:55,476 --> 00:37:55,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

593
00:37:56,896 --> 00:37:58,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what else is pretty neat?

594
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:02,318
[SPEAKER_02]: That Tekken 5 Online is now online.

595
00:38:02,898 --> 00:38:17,061
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, it's kind of funny, but you can now download, and not for free, but for $10, you can download and get survival mode, and then I guess a practice mode, and of course the online mode.

596
00:38:17,301 --> 00:38:19,642
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yay!

597
00:38:19,762 --> 00:38:20,022
[SPEAKER_02]: They've

598
00:38:20,692 --> 00:38:24,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Broke it and then make you pay $10 to fix it.

599
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:25,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray.

600
00:38:25,538 --> 00:38:27,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have Tekken on the PlayStation Network?

601
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck no.

602
00:38:28,461 --> 00:38:30,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know I don't even have a PlayStation 2.

603
00:38:30,403 --> 00:38:32,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not spending like $15 for a crippled game.

604
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:35,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really a Tekken fan.

605
00:38:35,929 --> 00:38:37,551
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't play fighting games that much.

606
00:38:39,473 --> 00:38:42,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Much less do I play PlayStation 3 games much.

607
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:51,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, one thing we like to do is we like to open up ye olde mailbag once in a while and read some of our favorite emails.

608
00:38:51,176 --> 00:38:54,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly, DarkSakura's not here tonight, so she's not here to read the emails for us.

609
00:38:54,997 --> 00:38:55,937
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm here, dammit.

610
00:38:56,157 --> 00:38:56,897
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll read the emails.

611
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:07,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangelongerator.com is the place to do it.

612
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:11,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Our first email tonight comes from AZHP.

613
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:18,179
[SPEAKER_03]: and AZHP says, Hey, OLR, random thought from last week's show that I forgot to say on the Skype line.

614
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:24,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Saw the live feed for about five seconds before Live 365 got cut off and you killed the operator.

615
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:24,703
[SPEAKER_03]: 11 feed.

616
00:39:25,123 --> 00:39:25,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob is hot.

617
00:39:25,803 --> 00:39:26,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Call me later.

618
00:39:27,444 --> 00:39:29,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.

619
00:39:30,065 --> 00:39:30,766
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awkward.

620
00:39:30,926 --> 00:39:31,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a little bit.

621
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:32,647
[SPEAKER_03]: P.S.

622
00:39:32,747 --> 00:39:33,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

623
00:39:33,507 --> 00:39:34,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep up the great podcasting.

624
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:35,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Less awkward.

625
00:39:36,889 --> 00:39:37,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny.

626
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to another email.

627
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:44,675
[SPEAKER_03]: This email comes to us from Ali.

628
00:39:45,195 --> 00:39:46,156
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be Ali, actually.

629
00:39:46,396 --> 00:39:46,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's Ali.

630
00:39:48,557 --> 00:39:52,459
[SPEAKER_03]: In episode 244, part A, you got an email from someone who said your show is calming.

631
00:39:52,819 --> 00:39:54,400
[SPEAKER_03]: And Rob exclaimed, I don't understand.

632
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,401
[SPEAKER_03]: How is this show calming?

633
00:39:55,441 --> 00:39:58,082
[SPEAKER_03]: This show makes me want to do vehicular manslaughter to my cousins.

634
00:39:58,922 --> 00:40:00,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I second that calming effect.

635
00:40:00,443 --> 00:40:03,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing the endurance races in Forza while listening to podcasts.

636
00:40:03,445 --> 00:40:07,127
[SPEAKER_03]: And I must say, it is when I listen to yours that I don't want to kill my Xbox.

637
00:40:07,287 --> 00:40:07,627
[SPEAKER_03]: It cheats.

638
00:40:08,354 --> 00:40:10,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I need to say F you to my local EB Games.

639
00:40:10,735 --> 00:40:19,780
[SPEAKER_03]: It is situated in a local burg separated from the city, in which it is illegal to trade video games if you are under 18, and you must have photo ID to trade video games.

640
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:33,426
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, when I went to take my stack of old Xbox games that have no replay value in to get Forza, I had to go back home, drag my mom to EB, and make her show them her driver's license so I could buy the E-rated Forza Motorsport 2, WTF.

641
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,222
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have called in to deliver that rant, but I'm never home when you guys tape.

642
00:40:38,923 --> 00:40:43,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, am I the only one who finds the mouse acceleration in Bioshock unbelievably frustrating?

643
00:40:43,927 --> 00:40:52,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I love how in Battlefield 1942, Half-Life 2, and Counter-Strike, the mouse response is snappy and rigid, but Bioshock has some weird acceleration built into it.

644
00:40:52,813 --> 00:40:54,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it because I'm playing in Vista?

645
00:40:54,975 --> 00:40:58,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, by the way, I'm playing Bioshock on my dual-booting MacBook Pro.

646
00:40:58,878 --> 00:40:59,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Suck it, Loki.

647
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:02,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Love the show, except the Mac hating, Ollie.

648
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:03,782
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

649
00:41:05,188 --> 00:41:07,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Another fan mail for Loki.

650
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:11,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe it's because he's doing that whole doobling thing that his mouse is so screwed up.

651
00:41:11,433 --> 00:41:12,274
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have no idea.

652
00:41:12,634 --> 00:41:13,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not been able to play.

653
00:41:13,595 --> 00:41:17,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Bioshock won't even run on my archaic PC, so I couldn't tell you.

654
00:41:17,578 --> 00:41:21,841
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm curious, chat room, maybe is there somebody in chat that's playing Bioshock on the PC that would care to enlighten us?

655
00:41:21,881 --> 00:41:23,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the mouse feel weird to you guys?

656
00:41:23,959 --> 00:41:24,921
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

657
00:41:36,385 --> 00:41:36,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

658
00:41:36,845 --> 00:41:37,645
[SPEAKER_02]: It's those damn kids.

659
00:41:37,665 --> 00:41:38,426
[SPEAKER_01]: As they probably should.

660
00:41:38,466 --> 00:41:39,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, they make laws for reasons.

661
00:41:39,966 --> 00:41:47,888
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, obviously they've had reason to make such a law because, you know, they were getting too much theft or people turn in stuff.

662
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:50,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I could understand needing a photo ID.

663
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:55,070
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand the 18 thing, but... I think all of them require photo IDs.

664
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:55,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they do now.

665
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:59,472
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, 16 and up, I could see that.

666
00:41:59,612 --> 00:41:59,932
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

667
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:01,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's go to the next email.

668
00:42:01,832 --> 00:42:04,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Goldbanjo14 in our chatroom says, That law is bullshit.

669
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:07,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to the next email in our mailbag.

670
00:42:07,577 --> 00:42:08,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at OrangeSoundsRadio.com.

671
00:42:08,778 --> 00:42:15,299
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's not signed, so I will attribute it to Nick C. And it's titled, I agree with Loki.

672
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:22,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, my name, Nick, and I have been listening since I got a PSP when it first came and found the OLR PSP website.

673
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,140
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm reading this as is, you guys.

674
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,521
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, this is a terrible email.

675
00:42:26,681 --> 00:42:30,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I listen live once and a while and download the podcast all the time.

676
00:42:30,762 --> 00:42:33,242
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking he typed it on his PSP, so I'm giving him a break.

677
00:42:34,798 --> 00:42:38,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Listening to your podcast helped me out when buying a DDR game for my sister.

678
00:42:38,581 --> 00:42:40,182
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with Loki on Apple.

679
00:42:40,582 --> 00:42:42,864
[SPEAKER_03]: I hat every product made by Apple.

680
00:42:43,624 --> 00:42:52,370
[SPEAKER_03]: People always get made when I bash on Apple all the time, saying that Apple is good with their crappy iPods and Macs that are overpriced.

681
00:42:52,571 --> 00:42:54,152
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you think he meant by hat?

682
00:42:54,192 --> 00:42:54,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it hate?

683
00:42:54,932 --> 00:42:55,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's hate.

684
00:42:56,372 --> 00:42:57,773
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's Hath.

685
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,595
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it says, I hate every product made by Apple.

686
00:43:00,655 --> 00:43:02,396
[SPEAKER_03]: People always get mad, but I read it as is.

687
00:43:03,396 --> 00:43:14,222
[SPEAKER_03]: People always get mad when I bash on Apple all the time, saying that Apple is good with their crappy iPods and Macs that are overpriced, and I hope they unlock the iPhone so I can make fun of more people that bought an iPod that makes calls.

688
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:16,924
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go, Loki.

689
00:43:16,964 --> 00:43:20,526
[SPEAKER_03]: At least you have the bad grammar kids agreeing with you.

690
00:43:20,546 --> 00:43:23,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you know, still though, you've got to admit, I mean...

691
00:43:26,197 --> 00:43:26,757
[SPEAKER_02]: $600 for a phone?

692
00:43:26,817 --> 00:43:27,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on!

693
00:43:27,878 --> 00:43:33,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if it were a Microsoft phone, I would still be giving people crap for it.

694
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:35,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, why the fuck are you spending $600 on a phone?

695
00:43:35,825 --> 00:43:37,306
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want to know.

696
00:43:37,426 --> 00:43:37,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my thing.

697
00:43:37,967 --> 00:43:39,668
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you straight up right now.

698
00:43:39,748 --> 00:43:52,559
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I love Macs and all that stuff, so I'm not going to hate on it or whatever, but here's the thing is that I did notice when I was at the airport this week, because I did spend a lot of my week in LA this week, is that

699
00:43:53,177 --> 00:43:57,158
[SPEAKER_03]: There are tons of assholes out there with iPhones that don't even know how to use them.

700
00:43:57,459 --> 00:44:01,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's becoming this trendy thing amongst businessmen and businesswomen to use.

701
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,801
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of assholes out there with iPhones, so go figure.

702
00:44:07,802 --> 00:44:08,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

703
00:44:09,203 --> 00:44:12,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's expensive and excessive, just like SUVs.

704
00:44:12,244 --> 00:44:17,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, if you're an Apple fanboy, fangirl, and you bought one because you want to support the great Apple in the sky, then go for it.

705
00:44:18,586 --> 00:44:19,126
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.

706
00:44:19,926 --> 00:44:20,287
[SPEAKER_03]: No hate.

707
00:44:21,027 --> 00:44:21,567
[SPEAKER_03]: No hate from here.

708
00:44:22,778 --> 00:44:24,419
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do one more here.

709
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:25,720
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from Nate.

710
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:51,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I am but a poor commoner and don't have any of the next gen systems, so I have to make do with the pre-DS and Wii Nintendo systems.

711
00:44:51,771 --> 00:44:56,332
[SPEAKER_03]: As such, a lot of the hot news regarding Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, etc.

712
00:44:56,652 --> 00:45:02,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't have much interest in, although it is nice to keep up with what's happening in the industry just for the sake of staying well informed.

713
00:45:02,634 --> 00:45:04,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that person obviously doesn't listen to the show whatsoever.

714
00:45:26,195 --> 00:45:27,475
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

715
00:45:54,116 --> 00:45:57,278
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already said this twice in chat, but honestly, this is important in my opinion.

716
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:04,684
[SPEAKER_03]: In the final area in Super Metroid, below the four boss statues, make sure you only save in the first save room.

717
00:46:05,044 --> 00:46:14,791
[SPEAKER_03]: If you save in the second one, you've already gone past a certain point where there's a room where its door is gray and deactivated, resulting in you being trapped except for being able to complete the game.

718
00:46:15,436 --> 00:46:19,178
[SPEAKER_03]: This would prevent you from going back and collecting any power-ups you may have missed.

719
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:21,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Note, I learned this the hard way.

720
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I even had all the reserve tanks and energy tanks.

721
00:46:25,342 --> 00:46:27,644
[SPEAKER_03]: So, boy, you got screwed, didn't you?

722
00:46:28,604 --> 00:46:29,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, buddy.

723
00:46:30,265 --> 00:46:30,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to hear it.

724
00:46:32,767 --> 00:46:33,908
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's it for email.

725
00:46:34,048 --> 00:46:38,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, if you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelaundrater.com is the place to do it.

726
00:46:38,951 --> 00:46:39,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

727
00:46:41,252 --> 00:46:51,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Neo Geo titles are confirmed to be coming to the Virtual Console as soon as this month.

728
00:46:51,897 --> 00:47:02,783
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, September 11th, you'll be getting a few games, including Fatal Fury, Magical Lord, and World of Heroes.

729
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are each going to cost a whopping 900 Wii Points.

730
00:47:08,248 --> 00:47:10,970
[SPEAKER_02]: No word on whether they're coming to the US.

731
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:12,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine at some point they will.

732
00:47:13,611 --> 00:47:15,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Magical Lord is fucking awesome.

733
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:20,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad to see that's in the initial allotment there.

734
00:47:20,435 --> 00:47:21,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I remember playing that a lot.

735
00:47:22,536 --> 00:47:28,499
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, these grocery chains around here had Neo Geo machines a while back.

736
00:47:28,959 --> 00:47:32,241
[SPEAKER_02]: So while my parents were checking out, I would be playing Magical Lord.

737
00:47:33,121 --> 00:47:36,283
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think it's inevitable that the game's going to come at some point.

738
00:47:37,261 --> 00:47:38,402
[SPEAKER_03]: XBOX 360 Fatal Inertia

739
00:48:00,009 --> 00:48:01,110
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to check that game out.

740
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:03,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Going over to some other systems.

741
00:48:03,872 --> 00:48:08,175
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Nintendo Wii, there's this game called Shinchuka Taisen.

742
00:48:09,617 --> 00:48:13,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael to Meme no Boken, which is coming out from Starfish.

743
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,842
[SPEAKER_03]: And this looks to be a game, I'm trying to look at some of the screenshots.

744
00:48:17,643 --> 00:48:24,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like a little bit of a side-scroller action-y type game, like a throwback to an old, you know, like Mario type game.

745
00:48:24,528 --> 00:48:25,209
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool.

746
00:48:25,389 --> 00:48:26,590
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if they'll bring that stateside.

747
00:48:27,916 --> 00:48:37,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii, nothing this week, but we can go over to the PlayStation 3 and I can tell you that there is another Pachinko game coming out.

748
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:39,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't there always?

749
00:48:39,373 --> 00:48:40,515
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always something coming out.

750
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:44,813
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 2 Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories Dear My Son EA Sports Rugby 08 Will-O-Wisp PlayStation 2 Theta

751
00:49:09,441 --> 00:49:16,905
[SPEAKER_03]: and also a game from Bandai called... Well, let's just call it Mahjong, because that's what it is.

752
00:49:16,965 --> 00:49:17,745
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Mahjong game.

753
00:49:17,865 --> 00:49:19,326
[SPEAKER_03]: It's with a really complicated title.

754
00:49:19,346 --> 00:49:20,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Mahjong, the game!

755
00:49:20,226 --> 00:49:21,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Another Mahjong game on the PS.

756
00:49:21,507 --> 00:49:23,328
[SPEAKER_03]: The only Mahjong game you need.

757
00:49:23,668 --> 00:49:24,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just leave it at that.

758
00:49:25,268 --> 00:49:27,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Really quickly, seeing if there's anything on the PSP worth mentioning.

759
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:30,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony's putting out a game called Rezel Cross.

760
00:49:31,972 --> 00:49:32,892
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be kind of interesting.

761
00:49:32,912 --> 00:49:33,512
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an RPG.

762
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:34,973
[SPEAKER_03]: It's from Sony themselves.

763
00:49:35,632 --> 00:49:40,235
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's from, the script is written by the folks who did Ark of the Lad 3 and 4.

764
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:42,556
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you like Ark of the Lad, you might like this game.

765
00:49:43,117 --> 00:49:44,938
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it, Japan releases.

766
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:45,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

767
00:49:46,058 --> 00:49:54,423
[SPEAKER_02]: In the US, on PlayStation 2, I hope you like Naruto, because Naruto Uzumaki Chronicles 2 is the only PS2 game coming out this week.

768
00:49:54,864 --> 00:49:59,927
[SPEAKER_02]: On other systems though, let's see, 360, we've got Medal of Honor Airborne, that's also coming out on PC.

769
00:50:01,636 --> 00:50:06,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Stranglehold is also coming out on Xbox 360, both the standard and collector's edition.

770
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:12,802
[SPEAKER_02]: On PSP and DS, Worms Open Warfare 2, because the Worms games are awesome.

771
00:50:13,743 --> 00:50:18,005
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see here, on PlayStation 3, you get a big fat nothing.

772
00:50:18,785 --> 00:50:22,287
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, on the Wii, Pool Party.

773
00:50:22,748 --> 00:50:25,469
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, that's not with water, that is billiards.

774
00:50:26,651 --> 00:50:31,992
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see, also on the DS, Garfield Nightmares, which I'm sure is awesome.

775
00:50:32,633 --> 00:50:38,174
[SPEAKER_02]: And PC games, two games that I have to love, I guess.

776
00:50:38,474 --> 00:50:40,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I Love Kittens and I Love Puppies.

777
00:50:41,175 --> 00:50:41,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray!

778
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:42,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I Love Kittens!

779
00:50:42,855 --> 00:50:43,656
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like fun.

780
00:50:44,396 --> 00:50:45,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, other fun games.

781
00:50:46,316 --> 00:50:48,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a tycoon game this week?

782
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:49,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Because...

783
00:50:49,895 --> 00:50:52,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be very disappointed if there is not.

784
00:50:54,118 --> 00:50:58,621
[SPEAKER_02]: And... No.

785
00:50:59,501 --> 00:51:01,283
[SPEAKER_02]: No Tycoon game.

786
00:51:01,343 --> 00:51:01,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to hear it.

787
00:51:02,523 --> 00:51:07,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, going over to European release dates, since DarkSakura is not here, I still got a lot of love for you, Europe.

788
00:51:07,725 --> 00:51:09,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go and look at your release dates real quick.

789
00:51:10,106 --> 00:51:14,808
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 7th, all these games on the 7th, Blazing Angels coming out on Xbox 360 and the PC.

790
00:51:14,828 --> 00:51:16,649
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be the Secret Missions from Ubisoft.

791
00:51:17,049 --> 00:51:19,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy Taxi Fair Wars on the PSP.

792
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:22,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Two Worlds makes its way to the PC and the Xbox 360.

793
00:51:23,531 --> 00:51:28,193
[SPEAKER_03]: And Valkyrie Profile 2 Slumera is coming out on the PlayStation 2.

794
00:51:28,573 --> 00:51:30,754
[SPEAKER_03]: God, that game came out over here like a year ago, didn't it?

795
00:51:31,323 --> 00:51:31,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Just about.

796
00:51:32,044 --> 00:51:33,565
[SPEAKER_03]: God, it's about time you guys got it.

797
00:51:33,605 --> 00:51:34,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to hear it, folks.

798
00:51:35,327 --> 00:51:36,568
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, that's it for release dates.

799
00:51:36,988 --> 00:51:40,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I think it's a real big disappointment that they haven't gotten it yet.

800
00:51:40,231 --> 00:51:42,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's some Valkyrie Profile fans out there, I'm sure.

801
00:51:42,493 --> 00:51:42,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad.

802
00:51:43,574 --> 00:51:55,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, there's an interesting game coming out in Japan, of course, because, God forbid, you know, that something like this come out over here.

803
00:51:55,785 --> 00:51:57,106
[SPEAKER_02]: It's created by the team...

804
00:51:59,218 --> 00:52:06,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega's Field of Magic team, and it uses voice recognition technology to decipher how people really feel.

805
00:52:06,888 --> 00:52:16,160
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called CorocoScan, and apparently they have a hilarious clip on YouTube.

806
00:52:16,875 --> 00:52:22,479
[SPEAKER_02]: That's talking, they're interviewing, I guess, a girl and her boyfriend.

807
00:52:23,179 --> 00:52:28,143
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were asking, I guess, how he feels about living together and marriage and stuff like that.

808
00:52:28,943 --> 00:52:33,787
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess it came up that he was cheating on her or something.

809
00:52:35,888 --> 00:52:36,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

810
00:52:36,589 --> 00:52:36,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

811
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to play with that game.

812
00:52:39,391 --> 00:52:39,851
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be fun.

813
00:52:39,871 --> 00:52:41,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Any chances it might come out over here?

814
00:52:41,852 --> 00:52:43,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, but hey, thank goodness that...

815
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:49,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Those games are region-free, so awesome.

816
00:52:50,283 --> 00:52:50,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.

817
00:52:50,843 --> 00:52:53,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Except you have to be able to read Japanese to actually play them, so what the hell.

818
00:52:54,164 --> 00:52:54,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, it doesn't matter.

819
00:52:55,725 --> 00:52:55,985
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

820
00:52:56,305 --> 00:53:02,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this might be a little more mainstream, and this is coming out on the Nintendo DS, I don't know when.

821
00:53:02,787 --> 00:53:05,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming sometime within the next year or so.

822
00:53:05,468 --> 00:53:07,849
[SPEAKER_03]: The Legend of Kage Part 2.

823
00:53:07,989 --> 00:53:11,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Some folks, if you don't know how to pronounce things right, might call this The Legend of Cage Part 2.

824
00:53:12,478 --> 00:53:14,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this came out years ago on the NES.

825
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:19,642
[SPEAKER_03]: But The Legend of Kage is coming out on the DS, a new sequel to it.

826
00:53:20,202 --> 00:53:25,745
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was something that was spotted in Famitsu Magazine with some screenshots and everything.

827
00:53:25,905 --> 00:53:26,886
[SPEAKER_03]: So pretty cool.

828
00:53:28,307 --> 00:53:29,427
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like The Legend of Kage.

829
00:53:29,447 --> 00:53:31,689
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that's an S game that a lot of people liked.

830
00:53:32,829 --> 00:53:34,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's on Virtual Console now, right?

831
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:35,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

832
00:53:36,431 --> 00:53:36,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly.

833
00:53:36,912 --> 00:53:38,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I saw that it was coming back to Virtual Console.

834
00:53:38,993 --> 00:53:39,433
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

835
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:50,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you are looking for a game that's not so mainstream and definitely a lot cheaper, you may be interested in Rose Camellia DS.

836
00:53:50,897 --> 00:54:02,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you're not familiar of Rose and Camellia, it's a women's slapping game that's a flash game right now, but it is being ported over to the DS via the homebrew community.

837
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:08,708
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, actually, it's funny, the guy that's doing it happens to be French, and, um,

838
00:54:09,466 --> 00:54:24,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Needs help finishing the game, but still though, if you want to check it out, you can definitely check out the free Flash game site, and it is beyondds.free.fr.

839
00:54:24,538 --> 00:54:26,379
[SPEAKER_02]: For the record, that game is fucking rad.

840
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,000
[SPEAKER_03]: The slapping game, I love that game.

841
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,021
[SPEAKER_03]: The slapping game, yeah.

842
00:54:29,693 --> 00:54:30,593
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the slapping game.

843
00:54:30,813 --> 00:54:32,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever played the slapping game, the flash game, Shane?

844
00:54:33,474 --> 00:54:34,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you've been checked out of the show.

845
00:54:35,655 --> 00:54:39,136
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I tried to play it at work once and it wouldn't work right.

846
00:54:39,556 --> 00:54:40,116
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry to hear it.

847
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:40,616
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fun game.

848
00:54:40,636 --> 00:54:42,437
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds funny because you slap women.

849
00:54:44,417 --> 00:54:46,558
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're a woman slapping the women, so it's okay.

850
00:54:46,578 --> 00:54:47,318
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter.

851
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:49,799
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as a woman is getting slapped, all is right in the world.

852
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:51,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, you can send those cards and letters too.

853
00:54:51,279 --> 00:54:52,299
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your email, Miklatov?

854
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:54,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

855
00:54:56,352 --> 00:55:00,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Also announced for a Nintendo platform, not quite as...

856
00:55:01,662 --> 00:55:03,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh, but it's pretty cool nonetheless.

857
00:55:04,063 --> 00:55:07,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming to the Wii, Worms, A Space Odyssey.

858
00:55:08,384 --> 00:55:22,349
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another game in the Word series, and of course it will be taking advantage of the Wii's motion control system, but what's really cool about this, online worldwide play, which is not something you've been seeing a whole lot in Nintendo releases lately, so that is certainly very promising.

859
00:55:22,729 --> 00:55:25,350
[SPEAKER_03]: This was announced by an official press release from THQ Inc.

860
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:26,251
[SPEAKER_03]: this week.

861
00:55:26,651 --> 00:55:27,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Buyin' it!

862
00:55:28,071 --> 00:55:29,392
[SPEAKER_03]: You're that big a fan of Worms, huh?

863
00:55:29,412 --> 00:55:30,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I love me some Worms.

864
00:55:31,092 --> 00:55:36,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Just an FYI, there is still the Worms Open Warfare 2 being made for the DS and PSP.

865
00:55:36,734 --> 00:55:40,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, they must still really have a fanbase for these games, because they crank them out left and right.

866
00:55:40,975 --> 00:55:42,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you buying all of these games, Loki?

867
00:55:43,956 --> 00:55:44,576
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

868
00:55:44,596 --> 00:55:46,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Will I be playing them?

869
00:55:46,417 --> 00:55:46,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

870
00:55:47,237 --> 00:55:53,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought the very first one that came out on the PC years ago, and that's the last one I bought.

871
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:56,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the last game I bought was for the PC.

872
00:55:56,747 --> 00:56:00,229
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Worms Armageddon.

873
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:03,932
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have one of the Worms games on GameTap, so that's one of the ones I've played too.

874
00:56:04,032 --> 00:56:10,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been meaning to buy the one on Xbox Live Arcade, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.

875
00:56:12,699 --> 00:56:17,343
[SPEAKER_02]: One game I'm definitely going to be around to buying is Manhunt 2.

876
00:56:18,084 --> 00:56:22,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, people are still pissed off that the game got re-rated down to an M.

877
00:56:22,605 --> 00:56:25,686
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to know why they're demanding answers, and guess what?

878
00:56:25,726 --> 00:56:29,488
[SPEAKER_02]: The ESRB says, uh-uh, we ain't giving you no fucking answers.

879
00:56:30,028 --> 00:56:31,729
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's their statement, basically.

880
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:47,276
[SPEAKER_02]: The FTC, the National PTA, the Kaiser Family Foundation, and the Peter Hart Research Team have all found that parents are overwhelmingly satisfied with the ESRB rating system, rather than publicly saying

881
00:56:49,251 --> 00:57:04,301
[SPEAKER_02]: What is unmistakably a strong warning to parents about the suitability of particular games for children, which presumably neither Senator Yee or the CCFC have personally reviewed.

882
00:57:04,361 --> 00:57:13,927
[SPEAKER_02]: We feel that a more productive tact would be joining us in encouraging parents to take their ratings seriously when buying games for their children.

883
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,741
[SPEAKER_02]: You show them.

884
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:19,022
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, yeah, they re-rate it.

885
00:57:19,483 --> 00:57:19,723
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

886
00:57:19,963 --> 00:57:21,064
[SPEAKER_02]: What did they change to re-rate it?

887
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:21,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, fuck off.

888
00:57:21,945 --> 00:57:23,005
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get to find out.

889
00:57:24,106 --> 00:57:30,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, they can find out if they buy certain versions of the game in other countries and check it.

890
00:57:31,452 --> 00:57:33,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe they didn't change much at all.

891
00:57:33,593 --> 00:57:34,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they appealed or something.

892
00:57:34,794 --> 00:57:38,177
[SPEAKER_02]: It's freaking... Okay, 17 and 18 year olds, come on.

893
00:57:38,417 --> 00:57:39,618
[SPEAKER_02]: We've discussed this before.

894
00:57:39,698 --> 00:57:43,000
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not much maturity difference between a 17 and 18 year old, okay?

895
00:57:45,407 --> 00:57:45,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

896
00:58:07,219 --> 00:58:09,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm more impressed that they did it this quick.

897
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:16,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we all thought the game was just not going to come out for like a year now because of this, and it seems like not even a month later, it's all fixed.

898
00:58:16,722 --> 00:58:19,583
[SPEAKER_03]: So it makes me think whatever they changed wasn't that much.

899
00:58:19,843 --> 00:58:20,544
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't that much.

900
00:58:20,804 --> 00:58:21,764
[SPEAKER_02]: It was probably stupid things.

901
00:58:21,784 --> 00:58:26,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember when we talked about Laird last week and how they had to change stuff to get a teen rating?

902
00:58:27,206 --> 00:58:30,667
[SPEAKER_02]: They couldn't show blood, but they could show people being burned alive.

903
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:33,489
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like, there's a big difference there or something.

904
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:37,713
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's just, it's really stupid, the requirements that they have.

905
00:58:37,733 --> 00:58:40,475
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like the, you know, MPA, it's all fucked up.

906
00:58:40,956 --> 00:58:42,477
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I don't know.

907
00:58:42,657 --> 00:58:48,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I like how these people, though, that haven't played the game at all can criticize, you know, the rating system or anything like that.

908
00:58:48,643 --> 00:58:54,488
[SPEAKER_02]: They have no clue on what's going on, yet they're just like, oh, we want the game banned, it's horrible.

909
00:58:54,588 --> 00:58:58,171
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be selling it to children, you know, despite the fact that it's,

910
00:58:58,697 --> 00:58:59,718
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

911
00:59:22,327 --> 00:59:24,329
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like they act like their parents are powerless.

912
00:59:24,349 --> 00:59:26,290
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh no, he's got it in his hands now.

913
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:27,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't take it away from him.

914
00:59:28,091 --> 00:59:32,414
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doomed.

915
00:59:32,454 --> 00:59:33,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of comments from chat here.

916
00:59:33,735 --> 00:59:37,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Fireboma says, won't somebody think of the children?

917
00:59:38,499 --> 00:59:38,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

918
00:59:38,999 --> 00:59:47,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Escapist says, maybe they just had to excise some extreme cutscenes to Manhunt 2 down to an M. Son of Dad speculates Manhunt wasn't changed.

919
00:59:47,185 --> 00:59:48,386
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a publicity stunt.

920
00:59:49,787 --> 00:59:50,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

921
00:59:50,448 --> 00:59:51,951
[SPEAKER_03]: GS191 says, I'm 19.

922
00:59:52,933 --> 00:59:54,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't feel any more different than when I was 17.

923
00:59:55,578 --> 01:00:00,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, I learned a lot of things, but these people forget that there's a lot of kids that know the difference between real and fake.

924
01:00:01,451 --> 01:00:05,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but isn't it fair to say, unfortunately, there's some that don't, and there's even some, like, 20-year-olds that don't.

925
01:00:05,173 --> 01:00:16,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Shouldn't you be more worried about your kids going and having underage sex and doing drugs and, you know, all sorts of things like that rather than playing violent video games?

926
01:00:16,437 --> 01:00:23,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think that you would be more encouraging of, you know, kids playing games that require them not to leave the house to do malicious things.

927
01:00:24,481 --> 01:00:30,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about you, but, you know, I think given the two choices, I'll take my kids playing violent video games.

928
01:00:33,513 --> 01:00:38,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Fireboma in chat has a funny comment, says, My precious unique snowflake would never do drugs.

929
01:00:39,856 --> 01:00:41,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Or play these violent video games, I'm sure.

930
01:00:41,837 --> 01:00:43,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously, how dumb are people?

931
01:00:44,218 --> 01:00:44,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

932
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:48,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Who doesn't enjoy a little bit of violence once in a while?

933
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like violence, Shane?

934
01:00:50,661 --> 01:00:50,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

935
01:00:51,301 --> 01:00:51,581
[SPEAKER_03]: You do?

936
01:00:51,701 --> 01:00:52,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's good.

937
01:00:52,381 --> 01:00:53,762
[SPEAKER_01]: No, only sometimes.

938
01:00:54,022 --> 01:00:54,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Only sometimes?

939
01:00:54,903 --> 01:00:55,943
[SPEAKER_03]: What types of violence do you like?

940
01:00:57,204 --> 01:00:58,624
[SPEAKER_01]: The stuff that doesn't look too real.

941
01:00:59,225 --> 01:01:00,625
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't stand the real stuff.

942
01:01:00,845 --> 01:01:01,185
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

943
01:01:01,986 --> 01:01:02,266
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

944
01:01:03,132 --> 01:01:04,653
[SPEAKER_01]: and Violence Against Women.

945
01:01:06,514 --> 01:01:07,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, those cards and letters.

946
01:01:07,915 --> 01:01:08,976
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to hear a funny story?

947
01:01:10,156 --> 01:01:10,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, why not?

948
01:01:10,857 --> 01:01:13,358
[SPEAKER_02]: This refers to last week when we were talking about Imagine Babies.

949
01:01:13,819 --> 01:01:17,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually talked to the company that's making Imagine Babies.

950
01:01:17,781 --> 01:01:18,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Ubisoft's putting it out.

951
01:01:19,222 --> 01:01:20,963
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mentioned to them about the baby shaking.

952
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:23,144
[SPEAKER_02]: They did not know that.

953
01:01:23,164 --> 01:01:25,486
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't?

954
01:01:25,946 --> 01:01:27,967
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, you can rock the baby with one part.

955
01:01:27,987 --> 01:01:30,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you shake it really fast, you're actually shaking babies.

956
01:01:30,169 --> 01:01:30,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

957
01:01:32,029 --> 01:01:33,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want them to change that.

958
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:36,190
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to change that.

959
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:38,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job, Loki, ruining Imagine Babies.

960
01:01:39,371 --> 01:01:39,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

961
01:01:39,731 --> 01:01:41,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job, ass.

962
01:01:44,353 --> 01:01:46,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, this show has gone to all sorts of places.

963
01:01:46,654 --> 01:01:47,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't think it would go tonight.

964
01:01:47,794 --> 01:01:51,335
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because Jamie's not here to keep us in check and make pouty faces.

965
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:54,556
[SPEAKER_03]: And flip me off.

966
01:01:55,765 --> 01:01:56,185
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

967
01:02:15,793 --> 01:02:32,283
[SPEAKER_03]: but Electronic Arts was contacted a little later in the week and EA has reaffirmed that yes, they are going to E for All so if you want a chance to play Rock Band early you still have a chance because obviously if EA is going they're bringing that game with them because they've trucked it everywhere the past couple months

968
01:02:32,722 --> 01:02:33,782
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

969
01:02:59,065 --> 01:03:01,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Shane, I might have to drag you with me if you can go.

970
01:03:01,968 --> 01:03:03,590
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, depending on what's going on.

971
01:03:04,411 --> 01:03:04,692
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

972
01:03:05,392 --> 01:03:06,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anything else in this Part A?

973
01:03:07,755 --> 01:03:09,177
[SPEAKER_03]: We're kind of running a short show tonight.

974
01:03:09,797 --> 01:03:10,538
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what's up with that.

975
01:03:10,598 --> 01:03:12,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's just Part A. That's just Part A. That's right.

976
01:03:12,941 --> 01:03:13,762
[SPEAKER_03]: There's plenty more to come.

977
01:03:14,525 --> 01:03:17,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight in Part B, we're going to be playing a little bit of Beat the Host.

978
01:03:17,847 --> 01:03:23,189
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might want to get your phones nearby or your Skype line ready because we'll be taking the first caller to play Beat the Host.

979
01:03:23,609 --> 01:03:25,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Not now, but when we come back and we tell you to call in.

980
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:28,232
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you haven't heard Beat the Host, it's a lot of fun.

981
01:03:28,492 --> 01:03:30,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay tuned for tonight's Beat the Host.

982
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:33,434
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be right back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

983
01:03:33,934 --> 01:03:38,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

984
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:43,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
