Today, September 16th, 2007, some cult games from the last generation are coming to Xbox

00:19.560 --> 00:25.080
360, a retro CD-based system is coming soon to Wii's Virtual Console, and do M-rated

00:25.080 --> 00:34.040
games so better than other games? Orange Lounge Radio. Hello everybody out there on the internet

00:34.040 --> 00:38.960
and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. We are that podcast dedicated to video

00:38.960 --> 00:43.760
games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. My name is Rob Roberts, you

00:43.760 --> 00:48.520
might know me as Sky. Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura,

00:48.520 --> 00:54.320
Jamie Summers. What? How are you, Dark Sakura? Meh. I'm sorry to inconvenience you with our

00:54.320 --> 00:59.160
little program tonight. I was busy. Busy doing what, might I ask? Petting my ferret. Petting

00:59.160 --> 01:04.040
your ferret? Having fun? Is that a euphemism for something? Maybe I shouldn't ask. Say

01:04.040 --> 01:09.840
hello to the tech master, Loki. Hello. How are you doing, Loki? I'm doing fine. I'm glad

01:09.840 --> 01:16.440
to hear. Just fine? Well, I'm trying to get, I have a custom firmware on my PSP Slim, and

01:16.440 --> 01:21.640
I'm trying to get it to run ISOs, but I think that there's been some changes versus what

01:21.640 --> 01:27.720
I was running before, so. Gotcha. Well, happy birthday. A little late, by the way. Thank

01:27.720 --> 01:31.720
you. Mr. Loki. And hope, you hope you had a good one, but I'm sure you'll tell us all

01:31.720 --> 01:34.860
about your little birthday gathering last night in a minute. Yeah. During How Was Your

01:34.860 --> 01:38.600
Gaming Week. But yeah, we're gonna start off with How Was Your Gaming Week. I want to introduce

01:38.600 --> 01:42.200
the chat room, though. Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com. If you're listening to us live here on this

01:42.200 --> 01:46.480
Sunday evening, you can join our chat room. Just head on over there. And of course, if

01:46.480 --> 01:50.560
you aren't listening live, just join us sometime. We tape live Sunday nights at six o'clock

01:50.560 --> 01:56.240
Pacific Standard Time on our live 365 feed, and now we have a webcam on Operator11.com,

01:56.240 --> 01:59.020
although I don't know, the webcam feed's not that exciting. You just kind of like see my

01:59.020 --> 02:02.760
face looking at the camera and Loki's back, because of the way the room's set up. But

02:02.760 --> 02:06.760
I'm hoping when we finally move the show out into the bigger room, we'll have more stuff

02:06.760 --> 02:13.040
to look at. So this is, this is all warm up. This is all the, the pre. This is the foreplay.

02:13.040 --> 02:17.160
This is the, yeah, that's exactly right. This is the foreplay with the camera. Thank you.

02:17.160 --> 02:20.040
Dark Soccer, always the witty one. All right, How Was Your Gaming Week. Since we don't have

02:20.040 --> 02:24.840
guests here tonight to introduce, after last week's like clusterfuck of people, it's an

02:24.840 --> 02:28.680
empty house tonight. We're just feeling the love, the three of us. Dark Soccer. I didn't

02:28.680 --> 02:35.360
play anything. Nothing? Except World Cup Soccer. Oh, and we had Uno going on in my house, because

02:35.360 --> 02:41.920
Dan's buddy Will has decided that he loves Uno now and has been doing what he calls Ultimate

02:41.920 --> 02:47.880
Dickery Games. What, pray tell, is an Ultimate Dickery Game? Well, actually I've been calling

02:47.880 --> 02:52.480
it that. He's just calling it being an asshole. As in doing all the make you draw until you

02:52.480 --> 02:57.520
get the card and doing extra draws for challenges and things like that. And then he's doing

02:57.520 --> 03:02.480
challenges all the time. So he's just being a complete asshole and he's doing it on purpose.

03:02.480 --> 03:06.400
So like setting it to like the maximum cards you can possibly draw and all that stuff?

03:06.400 --> 03:11.080
Yeah. I see. And I think, I don't know if he's doing it under Dan's gamertag, though.

03:11.080 --> 03:16.120
I think he's doing it under his own. Or yours. No, he's not doing it under mine or I'll beat

03:16.120 --> 03:23.120
the crap out of him with a ferret. That would be funny if he did, though. I'd laugh. I haven't

03:23.480 --> 03:29.200
even touched Final Fantasy, though. Wow. Sorry to hear it. It's alright. I've been playing

03:29.200 --> 03:35.320
World Cup Soccer, though. Like a fiend. UndeadZerg in our chat room actually says, DarkSakura

03:35.320 --> 03:41.320
again? You love that World Cup Soccer. It's because it's the best pinball machine ever.

03:41.320 --> 03:46.720
Well now, and unfortunately, I don't know if you were going to get into this later,

03:46.720 --> 03:51.360
so I'm sorry for spoiling it, but I guess your desktop had a little crap out this week,

03:51.360 --> 03:54.720
so that takes out your PC gaming. Well no, actually I have something else, but it sort

03:54.720 --> 04:00.520
of goes into my FUs, sort of. I tried to get back into Guild Wars, and then we'll get into

04:00.520 --> 04:06.560
the FUs later. Oh dear, alright. So you played more games than you thought. Well no, I updated

04:06.560 --> 04:13.560
Guild Wars, and that's as far as I got. Uh oh. Dear PlayNC, please work on the weekends,

04:13.600 --> 04:20.600
not love me. P.S. Crap. Alright, well then we'll go to Loki. Loki, how was your gaming

04:20.880 --> 04:26.360
week? It was good. I took two days off this week to play games. Unfortunately, during

04:26.360 --> 04:31.880
those two days, I really only played Bioshock. I did finish it, though, so that's good. And

04:31.880 --> 04:38.320
unfortunately, I forgot to do a few things while playing through it, so I wasn't able

04:38.320 --> 04:42.840
to get all the possible achievements I could, so I have to go back to some of the earlier

04:42.840 --> 04:48.720
saves and maybe replay through it again, but I'm like 820 out of 1000, so that's pretty

04:48.720 --> 04:54.920
good. Not bad for an achievement horse. Not bad, yeah. So I'll go back and do that stuff.

04:54.920 --> 05:01.840
It's a good game, interesting twists. I mean, it's a pretty cool twist, and you don't realize

05:01.840 --> 05:06.040
it throughout most of the game. I guess you kind of pick up on it a little bit as you

05:06.040 --> 05:13.040
go through, but it's also good to note that those audio diaries kind of tell more of the

05:13.080 --> 05:18.200
back story. They're not just there for achievements and stuff, so definitely check those out while

05:18.200 --> 05:24.400
you're playing the game. And then other things, like I mentioned, I bought a PSP Slim. It

05:24.400 --> 05:31.400
is very light, and of course the first thing I do to it, I hacked it and tried to put a

05:31.400 --> 05:38.400
custom firmware on it, and now I have 3 PSVs for some reason. And I just bought the cables

05:38.780 --> 05:43.180
for a video out today, so I haven't tried that yet. What is going to be pretty cool

05:43.180 --> 05:46.460
though is when I do get the homebrew on there, because I'll be able to hook it up to my TV

05:46.460 --> 05:53.060
and play around with that, and play Nintendo games on my TV I guess, though I can do that

05:53.060 --> 05:59.420
with like 5 other systems. I don't know. And then I've been trying to get my PS2 back from

05:59.420 --> 06:04.860
my sister so I can play the beta that got leaked out for Manhunt 2, because that's supposed

06:04.860 --> 06:10.100
to be good. Other things I played during the week, more Call of Duty 4 beta. I still suck

06:10.100 --> 06:15.900
at it, but it's going to be great. I can't wait for the game to come out. Of course,

06:15.900 --> 06:20.980
more Saints Row multiplayer at work, and they're kind of getting frustrated with me because

06:20.980 --> 06:25.980
I keep winning a lot, and buy a lot. So, sorry, it just...

06:25.980 --> 06:29.580
And you're so humble too. Well, I don't play it that much, I only play

06:29.580 --> 06:35.420
it at work, and so everyone thinks I'm practicing or something. I really don't, and it's not

06:35.420 --> 06:41.620
like I'm that good or anything, I don't know. And then, I'm trying to think, what else?

06:41.620 --> 06:47.220
I played some Xbox Live Arcade games. I played a little bit more Worms, and that's just kind

06:47.220 --> 06:51.840
of... I don't know. I don't even know if I want to play that to get achievement points,

06:51.840 --> 06:56.900
but yeah, I think that's pretty much it. Yeah, Worms was better like ten years ago.

06:56.900 --> 07:01.940
Exactly. I love Worms Armageddon. That was like the ultimate for me, and then it just

07:01.940 --> 07:07.500
kind of... they haven't done anything with it since Worms Armageddon, other than make

07:07.500 --> 07:12.340
it worse. So, that's about it so far, yeah. Alright.

07:12.340 --> 07:16.600
I got the Ratchet & Clank demo, but I didn't get to play it yet, so... for PS3.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.980
You will be playing that soon. Yes, yes.

07:18.980 --> 07:24.220
Alright. Well, my gaming week, I've of course been playing more Final Fantasy XI, and it's

07:24.220 --> 07:28.460
pretty awesome because Shane, before he left town, he actually got me a clock for Final

07:28.460 --> 07:32.800
Fantasy XI, which is actually pretty hilarious. It's a little Vanadiel clock. It actually

07:32.800 --> 07:37.580
shows you what time it is in Vanadiel, along with the Earth time, and it sets these little

07:37.580 --> 07:41.380
alarms that you can set on it. It's so funny. This is like for the totally hardcore gamer.

07:41.380 --> 07:45.460
But when the timers run out, this is the best part. It plays like little music box music.

07:45.460 --> 07:57.940
Hold on, let me see if I can get one to play. Isn't that the cutest thing you've ever seen?

07:57.940 --> 08:01.100
And by cute, I mean you have to be like a real addict to appreciate something like that.

08:01.100 --> 08:05.420
I feel sick to my stomach now. I will tell you what's made Final Fantasy

08:05.420 --> 08:12.220
XI a little more tolerable this time around is the Windower. It's this third-party application

08:12.220 --> 08:15.500
I'm really not supposed to be using, and I could probably get banned for saying that

08:15.500 --> 08:19.940
I use it, but the Windower allows you to play Final Fantasy XI in a window. So instead of

08:19.940 --> 08:24.100
sitting there looking for party, doing absolutely nothing, I can actually sit there and surf

08:24.100 --> 08:27.340
the internet while I wait and look for a party. It's the best thing ever.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.560
Now Windower does have some cheats built in, but I don't use them because that's how people

08:30.560 --> 08:34.800
get caught, and I don't want to cheat. I think cheating in MMOs is screwed up, but I don't

08:34.800 --> 08:38.060
see too much of the harm between flipping between different windows. I mean, I used

08:38.060 --> 08:41.780
to have my laptop over here and doing that. World of Warcraft, you can. Guild Wars, you

08:41.780 --> 08:44.060
can. Yeah, so I don't think it's a big deal about

08:44.060 --> 08:53.060
that. So there you have it. Let's see. Uh-oh. Is our feed dropping? No?

08:53.060 --> 08:55.780
It said it was lagging. It said it was lagging? All right, our chat

08:55.780 --> 08:58.900
room's saying the feed's screwed up. If the feed keeps screwing up too bad, I guess we'll

08:58.900 --> 09:02.060
have to kill Operator 11. I hope I don't have to do that. We'll see.

09:02.060 --> 09:05.700
But I'm looking in the chat room here, and I'm looking at what the chat was saying. They

09:05.700 --> 09:09.740
played their gaming week. We have a lot of threes in the gaming week. I see a lot of

09:09.740 --> 09:15.020
Metroid Prime 3s people have been playing. Nintendo Maniac 64 says Metroid Prime 3.

09:15.020 --> 09:20.620
Hitstun says Quake 3. Raw Steel UT says Persona 3. And then Son of Dad has been watching The

09:20.620 --> 09:25.740
Office Season 3. There you go. And then also I've been playing on the DS Planet Puzzle

09:25.740 --> 09:30.200
League, because Planet Puzzle League is all kinds of awesome. And trying to get more people

09:30.200 --> 09:34.140
on my friends list, though, so I'll be posting my code in our little thread we have there

09:34.140 --> 09:37.640
on the forums over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, trying to get more friends for Planet Puzzle

09:37.640 --> 09:43.500
League that I can play against. I bought a pink DS Lite for Nellie, so now

09:43.500 --> 09:50.180
she has her own gaming system to play with. Without having to bling it out?

09:50.180 --> 09:56.660
Yeah, and I just got her today. I got her a pink case to go with it, so she's all pinked

09:56.660 --> 09:59.820
out. So, before we get into housekeeping and gaming

09:59.820 --> 10:03.660
news tonight, let's talk about your birthday gathering, Loki. You didn't mention anything

10:03.660 --> 10:07.980
about our little trip this week. The real life game we played this week.

10:07.980 --> 10:14.420
Yeah, we went to Stars in Vacaville, which is this bowling alley slash entertainment

10:14.420 --> 10:22.220
center. It's got Qsar laser tag in there, which I think is the best laser tag game ever.

10:22.220 --> 10:27.500
Of course, if you played at Stars, it is not the best laser tag game ever. It is pretty

10:27.500 --> 10:31.620
bad actually nowadays, and this is probably the last time we'll be going back there.

10:31.620 --> 10:40.580
The packs were horrible. I mean, just broken in every which way you can imagine. In fact,

10:40.580 --> 10:45.580
I think the very first game I had, my pack had no speaker on it, so I couldn't tell whether

10:45.580 --> 10:50.100
I was hitting people when I was out of lives, anything like that. Plus, it didn't shoot

10:50.100 --> 10:55.620
straight, which didn't help either. They claimed that their computer system is

10:55.620 --> 11:00.180
broken so that they can't change the game settings, which is bullshit because they said

11:00.180 --> 11:05.660
the same thing last time and I yelled at them and they finally did it. Also, the people

11:05.660 --> 11:11.820
that work there are complete morons. In fact, they didn't really give a shit about anything.

11:11.820 --> 11:16.420
The second game, for example, we beat the other team by 800 points.

11:16.420 --> 11:23.740
That game was awesome. It was the worst pummeling I've ever seen.

11:23.740 --> 11:27.540
In the first game, the pack I had, I was like invincible. You could only kill me by shooting

11:27.540 --> 11:31.340
my gun because my front and back was out. There were so many things wrong with that.

11:31.340 --> 11:37.580
Eric went with us on Punk Night. I don't know anyone that might know him on Final Fantasy

11:37.580 --> 11:43.620
11 or World of Warcraft, but he had a pack that said that he only fired five shots and

11:43.620 --> 11:50.060
hit 59 people. His hit ratio is 100%. That's like ultimate bounce.

11:50.060 --> 11:55.780
He never got hit, which is complete bullshit. He didn't fire. He fired a lot more than five

11:55.780 --> 12:00.220
shots. The game was so fucked up and they really don't care.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.380
So why don't you open your own?

12:02.380 --> 12:05.020
Because it costs a lot of money to do that.

12:05.020 --> 12:06.880
Can you get a loan?

12:06.880 --> 12:09.980
Not that kind of a loan right now because I don't have property or any sort of collateral

12:09.980 --> 12:10.980
to go with it.

12:10.980 --> 12:11.980
Don't.

12:11.980 --> 12:17.580
Car, but it's going to cost at least half a million dollars to open one of those places.

12:17.580 --> 12:23.220
I'd love to do it because it's not that fucking hard. Shit, if they can run a laser tag place

12:23.220 --> 12:28.900
there, and it may be poorly run, but they have just like two people doing it, it can

12:28.900 --> 12:30.260
be done.

12:30.260 --> 12:35.260
Not to mention, other than laser tag, we were just getting drinks in between games and stuff

12:35.260 --> 12:40.100
and the fucker, and they have this little cafe or something that you can buy food at,

12:40.100 --> 12:44.140
and they have one person working there pretty much at the counter and I guess running food

12:44.140 --> 12:45.140
also.

12:45.140 --> 12:49.220
So it took us 10 minutes to get a fucking soda because she kept helping other people

12:49.220 --> 12:54.020
and I guess you fucked up orders and stuff like that.

12:54.020 --> 12:59.900
It was just really horrible and none of the equipment at the laser tag place looked like

12:59.900 --> 13:04.540
it had been repaired in years, it's just really fallen apart.

13:04.540 --> 13:08.860
So fuck them, we will not be coming back.

13:08.860 --> 13:12.420
You know, I want to point out last night was the first time I've seen a DDR machine in

13:12.420 --> 13:17.180
a long time too, but the thing I thought was interesting is I kind of assumed that DDR

13:17.180 --> 13:21.500
was kind of dead, and I know this might piss a lot of people off that obviously our show

13:21.500 --> 13:26.500
started a long time ago about DDR, we all met playing Dance Dance Revolution and everything,

13:26.500 --> 13:28.980
so I know it's kind of funny I'm saying this now, but I kind of thought most people play

13:28.980 --> 13:31.620
Dance Dance Revolution at home now, because that's where all the new stuff comes out is

13:31.620 --> 13:35.980
home and there's been some pretty decent mixes we've gotten on the home versions, but I was

13:35.980 --> 13:39.060
kind of surprised, there was a little crowd of kids all around the supernova machine that

13:39.060 --> 13:42.780
only appeared to be half working, like the monitor was screwed up on that thing, but

13:42.780 --> 13:48.700
I kind of walked by and was just like, hmm, some kid was doing max 300, it's like you're

13:48.700 --> 13:50.380
not cool unless you can do max 300 these days.

13:50.380 --> 13:54.720
Well he worked there too, he was the one that marshaled their second game, I wouldn't even

13:54.720 --> 13:59.040
call it marshaling, or for example I was arguing with him because he's like, yeah those two

13:59.040 --> 14:04.220
packs in the back work, I'm like no, we played those packs last game, they're fucking broken,

14:04.220 --> 14:08.140
and the laser doesn't shoot straight, and he's like, well you mean the laser?

14:08.140 --> 14:12.220
I'm like no, the emitter does not shoot straight, oh, well they're still working, I'm like no

14:12.220 --> 14:17.620
they're not, you fucking retard, I just hate talking to them, especially when they're saying

14:17.620 --> 14:20.440
that their system's broken, I'm like, do I need to come back there and set up my own

14:20.440 --> 14:23.980
damn game, because I know how to do it.

14:23.980 --> 14:27.980
Interesting, I just thought it was interesting that there's still that whole little community

14:27.980 --> 14:33.020
for DDR, but that's cool, I'm really glad, even though I kind of thought it was dead,

14:33.020 --> 14:36.500
just because there hasn't been a whole lot of new stuff, I mean supernova didn't bring

14:36.500 --> 14:40.260
a whole lot of new stuff to the table besides new songs, so I was just kind of surprised,

14:40.260 --> 14:41.700
that's all.

14:41.700 --> 14:42.700
So call me a cynic, whatever.

14:42.700 --> 14:43.700
We need supernova too.

14:43.700 --> 14:44.700
Hi cynic!

14:44.700 --> 14:45.700
Shut up.

14:45.700 --> 14:51.060
Alright, anyhow, let's see, let's get into some housekeeping for tonight, of which we

14:51.060 --> 14:57.140
don't really have much, there's not a whole lot to say, so I will plug our MySpace and

14:57.140 --> 15:00.260
LiveJournal communities, and ways that you can interact with us online, of course there's

15:00.260 --> 15:05.560
our website, www.orangelandtrady.com, or we have a MySpace as well, you should add us,

15:05.560 --> 15:10.020
and we'll be your friend on MySpace, and sometimes we post little things up there, especially

15:10.020 --> 15:14.740
like bonus shows, and weird things we tape other places, for instance we taped a show

15:14.740 --> 15:18.780
at AnatomyCon earlier this year that you could only get in our communities, so it's MySpace.com

15:18.780 --> 15:22.500
slash OrangeLoungeRadio, you can add us there, or you can add us on LiveJournal, our community

15:22.500 --> 15:26.700
on LiveJournal is also OrangeLoungeRadio, so there you go, actually no, I think we're

15:26.700 --> 15:29.220
OrangeLounge on LiveJournal, I can't remember.

15:29.220 --> 15:36.220
I think that I don't remember, I don't remember either, I think we're just OrangeLounge on

15:36.220 --> 15:41.300
LiveJournal, I'm trying to look right now, this is great radio I know, this is the best

15:41.300 --> 15:46.980
radio ever, I'm really excited to be a part of this, it's just completely amazing, next

15:46.980 --> 15:52.860
time before I, yeah there it is, we're just OrangeLounge on LiveJournal, there you go,

15:52.860 --> 15:59.580
let's see, I don't look at our MySpace anymore, Rioma says Wii online laser tag, dude, would

15:59.580 --> 16:05.020
that be awesome, an online laser tag with a Wii, no, I don't know, you know what would

16:05.020 --> 16:11.220
have been awesome is Metroid Prime 3 online, but that's just me, yeah that'd be awesome,

16:11.220 --> 16:17.060
there was some actual online content, alright, with a Wii, let's get into some gaming news

16:17.060 --> 16:23.620
then since we've given the community's ample plugging, yes, big news coming just before

16:23.620 --> 16:33.900
Tokyo Game Show here, including some big announcements, including the inclusion of Rez Ikaruga Exit

16:33.900 --> 16:40.900
and more on Xbox Live Arcade, which is really awesome, this news makes me so happy, Rez,

16:40.900 --> 16:50.420
Rez, Rez, they need to do like a new trans vibrator thing, I doubt it, anyways, yeah,

16:50.420 --> 16:58.700
Microsoft had their pre-show conference and Tetsuya Mizuguchi, of course, they're confirming

16:58.700 --> 17:05.380
that both his, I guess remake of Rez, Rez HD, which is pretty much just Rez in high

17:05.380 --> 17:12.700
definition, yay, and then of course Ikaruga Exit, which has appeared on the PSP, and of

17:12.700 --> 17:18.380
course some that have already been announced already, Every Extend, Extra Extreme, and

17:18.380 --> 17:25.500
of course Omega 5, also known as E, sorry, I'm going to my happy place right now, and

17:25.500 --> 17:30.100
Trigger Heart Alexia, if I mentioned I love Tetsuya Mizuguchi, you know what would make

17:30.100 --> 17:33.820
me happier with all of that, if they're giving us Ikaruga, why can't they give us another

17:33.820 --> 17:38.660
release of Radiant Silver Gun, wrong twice now, alright, anyways, lots of awesome games

17:38.660 --> 17:46.700
coming to Xbox Live Arcade, so, yay, I'm excited, I'll definitely be buying Rez, Jamie, explain

17:46.700 --> 17:53.860
for our listeners what makes Rez so awesome, thump, thump, thump, I can't explain what

17:53.860 --> 17:59.020
makes Rez so great, but it's totally one of those trippy things, it's like playing Vibribbin,

17:59.020 --> 18:03.900
it reminds me of those old trance music videos that you used to see on MTV's AMP, like really

18:03.900 --> 18:07.380
late at night, remember that show AMP, back when MTV actually played videos, it would

18:07.380 --> 18:10.940
come on like 12 or 1 in the morning, like it reminded me of that show, except you were

18:10.940 --> 18:15.860
playing it, and the cool thing about Rez is that as you're flying around shooting things,

18:15.860 --> 18:19.780
the little lasers and stuff are all in time with the music, I can't explain it, but it's

18:19.780 --> 18:23.940
like seriously one of those games you just zone out to, I can't think of any better way

18:23.940 --> 18:27.300
to explain it, Vibribbin's kind of like that, but not to the extent that Rez is, you don't

18:27.300 --> 18:31.480
zone out on it, but Vibribbin is definitely trippy enough that you have to blink again

18:31.480 --> 18:35.500
when you move your eyes away from the screen, there you go, uh, Tigerclaw in our chatroom

18:35.500 --> 18:39.160
at chat.orangelandtrader.com says, I guess Rez is the kind of game you play if you want

18:39.160 --> 18:44.520
to create your own personal rave, sorta, sorta, there you go, fucking awesome at a rave I

18:44.520 --> 18:50.340
think. Can you imagine playing that just at a rave? Huge, you know, giant screens. That

18:50.340 --> 18:54.320
might be a way to kinda do it. People trippin' out and stuff, that'd be awesome. Alright,

18:54.320 --> 18:59.180
so I'm very very happy about this news, it definitely takes me to my happy place, um,

18:59.180 --> 19:04.300
Exit I haven't really checked out before, so I'm kind of interested in it. Well, I never

19:04.300 --> 19:07.460
played it, but a lot of people love it, so it's one of those kind of niche things, but

19:07.460 --> 19:11.580
just like Ikaruga was one of those niche games. By chance did they say when this- Ikaruga

19:11.580 --> 19:15.740
was awesome. Did they say when this all was coming out? Uh, I know some of that list,

19:15.740 --> 19:21.900
like the Omega 5 was supposed to be due out in November, so, soon? I know, um, was Every

19:21.900 --> 19:27.400
Extend Extra Extreme is supposed to be coming out this year as well, I think, so. Nice.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.820
I actually, I liked Every Extend Extra on the PSP, that's another one of those just

19:30.820 --> 19:33.860
like totally chill out games. I need to borrow that from you. You want to? I'll go get it.

19:33.860 --> 19:38.140
Okay. This is an awesome game for PSP, so. I will go find it, but first I'm gonna read

19:38.140 --> 19:44.000
a story for you all about another awesome game, and of course, since we have a lot of

19:44.000 --> 19:47.580
music game fans that listen to our program, you guys all know this game, Elite Beat Agents.

19:47.580 --> 19:51.580
Hell, even the non-music game fans know this game, Elite Beat Agents. Oh my god. Good time.

19:51.580 --> 19:54.680
Our Owen Don, for those of you guys who like to import the game. Well, what's cool about

19:54.680 --> 20:01.440
this is that INIS, who actually developed Elite Beat Agents, they are currently working

20:01.440 --> 20:08.420
on an unnamed Xbox 360 title. Now, that doesn't mean it's Elite Beat Agents 360, like, you

20:08.420 --> 20:11.640
know, that would be really hard, because there's no touchscreen on the 360, but it's just kind

20:11.640 --> 20:15.860
of cool that the development team is developing something for another system. They're not

20:15.860 --> 20:20.400
just going to keep games on the DS, so they are making something on the Xbox 360. It should

20:20.400 --> 20:24.940
be said that some of the other games that this company has made, Guitar Man, was another

20:24.940 --> 20:29.500
game that they made. So, maybe Guitar Man 360? That'd be kind of rad. Well, they, you

20:29.500 --> 20:35.240
know, did Guitar Man, well it was really just more like a Guitar Man remix on PSP, where

20:35.240 --> 20:40.260
you could play as What's-Your-Face. Yeah, that's kind of like the Parappa thing on PSP.

20:40.260 --> 20:44.260
It's missable. It's not the end of the world if you don't get it, right? Kick, punch. It's

20:44.260 --> 20:51.260
all in the mind. Hey, my guitar is in my mind. Unjama Lamy 360. Oh, wait, that's not a Unjama

20:52.260 --> 20:57.960
Lamy. That uses the Guitar Hero controller. That would be kind of cool for a live title

20:57.960 --> 21:01.660
that uses that controller, but then again, it wouldn't be accessible to everybody. But

21:01.660 --> 21:05.400
I think it would be cool to have like another music game on Xbox Live Marketplace, because,

21:05.400 --> 21:09.460
you know, we have Boom Boom Rocket, but Boom Boom Rocket kind of died off. Like, they didn't

21:09.460 --> 21:12.440
really expand on it at all. I was thinking there was going to be download packs that

21:12.440 --> 21:16.740
maybe had some better songs, because the default songs are just all like classical song remixes

21:16.740 --> 21:22.340
that aren't that great. So, there's kind of a lack of music game stuff. Like playing V

21:22.340 --> 21:26.420
for five hours? Well, that's just, you know, going to the arcade when DDR Extreme first

21:26.420 --> 21:30.660
came out, but that's a whole other story. So, anyway. Well, I'm excited to see what

21:30.660 --> 21:35.340
the team comes up with for the 360. Well, this puts me in my happy place. I love Ninja

21:35.340 --> 21:40.860
Gaiden, and we're getting a Ninja Gaiden 2, and you can kill a lot of people as Ryu, who's

21:40.860 --> 21:47.100
like majorly cool and awesome with, oh, the only thing is that he doesn't have the cool

21:47.100 --> 21:54.100
looking scarf, but otherwise. But Itadaki is basically saying, here we go, Ninja Gaiden

21:54.100 --> 22:00.300
2 on Xbox 360, so that makes me happy. Man, it's uber violent. Lots of blood flying everywhere.

22:00.300 --> 22:04.060
Yeah, I love violence and blood. Like, I like this picture of him totally cutting off this

22:04.060 --> 22:11.060
guy's head, and it's like, it's not just blood, it's like this glorious fountain of crimson

22:12.340 --> 22:18.340
floating toward the air and covering everything in, you know, it's glory. I think that's beautiful.

22:18.340 --> 22:25.340
It's going to be pretty awesome. Something that's sort of awesome, I guess, Viva Pinata.

22:25.460 --> 22:32.060
It's a game, of course. It came out last year. Some people liked it. I didn't. But, someone

22:32.060 --> 22:39.060
decided that they love Viva Pinata so much that they proposed to their spouse on it.

22:39.460 --> 22:46.460
And so, yes, it's, I don't know, cheesy. Very, very cheesy. I guess cute.

22:46.460 --> 22:50.700
Just say no. But, I mean, why would you use Viva Pinata,

22:50.700 --> 22:57.140
like, send a message over? I mean, that's just kind of cheesy.

22:57.140 --> 23:01.020
As I understand it, wasn't it the case that, like, she actually didn't believe the guy

23:01.020 --> 23:05.500
at first when she got the message or she laughed it off? It's like, ah ha ha, that's cute.

23:05.500 --> 23:08.460
But then, like, the guy actually got down on one knee and proposed or something like

23:08.460 --> 23:12.700
that? So. Yeah, so it. Okay, if you're thinking about

23:12.700 --> 23:16.940
proposing to your spouse, don't do it over a game. I mean, seriously, I don't care how

23:16.940 --> 23:23.940
much you two love the game. Do not do it over a game. It's really cheesy and stupid.

23:24.980 --> 23:30.580
Why not? Jamie got proposed to over UHF. Well, it's not necessarily as much of a proposal

23:30.580 --> 23:37.040
as much of a, we should just get married. Okay? When? Sometime. And, you know, seven

23:37.040 --> 23:41.980
years later. It's just, it is pretty cheesy though. I mean.

23:41.980 --> 23:45.700
It's no cheesier than the people who go to a basketball game and have it go out over

23:45.700 --> 23:48.060
the big screen. You know, that's pretty cheesy too.

23:48.060 --> 23:52.820
I'd be like, don't embarrass me into marrying you shit.

23:52.820 --> 23:57.500
I'm kind of curious what other type of video game related proposals have happened. I'm

23:57.500 --> 24:00.500
kind of looking at our chat room. I'm not seeing a whole lot of stuff there. But what

24:00.500 --> 24:04.700
I thought was very interesting about this story is that a lot of sites really ran this,

24:04.700 --> 24:08.260
although this is really someone's, you know, personal business. But some guy just got kind

24:08.260 --> 24:12.520
of creative. I'm surprised that we never saw an Animal Crossing wedding proposal. Maybe

24:12.520 --> 24:15.140
there was and I just forgot about it. But, you know.

24:15.140 --> 24:22.100
Yeah, I mean, that's something I guess. I don't know. I was going to say, I know they've

24:22.100 --> 24:26.940
done World of Warcraft, that's for sure. And Final Fantasy XI, I'm sure Second Life

24:26.940 --> 24:31.620
has done it. You know, pretty much named the MMO and I'm sure that someone's tried to

24:31.620 --> 24:37.300
get married over it. Or actually performed a ceremony in-game, which is a whole...

24:37.300 --> 24:41.700
Like Ragnarok Weddings, remember Ragnarok? A whole other nerdy, oh my god.

24:41.700 --> 24:48.340
It was actually in the game too, so hey. Need to unplug, seriously. And of course, you

24:48.340 --> 24:53.060
know, especially with Final Fantasy XI, of course they're going to, you know, you can

24:53.060 --> 24:59.940
do it and then they'll just milk you for any sort of in-game money for it.

24:59.940 --> 25:03.940
Comments from chat, lots of comments from chat here. Chat.orangesonshadeo.com if you

25:03.940 --> 25:08.420
want to comment live on this Sunday night. Escapist says, on one hand it's sort of touching,

25:08.420 --> 25:14.900
on the other... Nochillynopitty says, I'm going to propose using an automated Super

25:14.900 --> 25:17.660
Mario World level.

25:17.660 --> 25:21.340
Oh my god, those are great. No, have you seen the automated?

25:21.340 --> 25:24.660
Yeah, I've seen some YouTubage of those automated levels. Those are pretty awesome.

25:24.660 --> 25:28.700
Those are amazing. I was watching them for like two hours on Friday night.

25:28.700 --> 25:32.020
Jamie, I made this in your honor. Will you marry me?

25:32.020 --> 25:33.020
No.

25:33.020 --> 25:38.420
Let's see. RasteelUT says, well, there was that one couple in Japan that got married

25:38.420 --> 25:41.420
in Phantasy Star Online. Wow.

25:41.420 --> 25:45.900
Ryoma says, propose over PictoChat. That's a little interesting.

25:45.900 --> 25:52.180
Well, you're going to be like 65 feet away. Come on. The least you could do is actually

25:52.180 --> 25:57.420
go up to them and say, will you marry me? Instead of just like, look, I drew a little

25:57.420 --> 26:03.920
picture that says, will you marry me? Aww, how cute. No. Just do it.

26:03.920 --> 26:10.040
It's like, okay, you know, I hate to even quote like Kelly, but you don't text message

26:10.040 --> 26:17.040
break up, okay? You don't text, you don't fucking PictoChat, you know, engage.

26:17.040 --> 26:25.540
Oh my god, Loki, you're such a bitch. I'm going to bet slap you, deckhead. I can't believe

26:25.540 --> 26:27.860
Loki quoted Kelly.

26:27.860 --> 26:35.120
It's just, it's stupid. It really is. If you think it's cute, okay, great, it's cute, but

26:35.120 --> 26:41.140
you know, anyone that doesn't play the game, like your parents, relatives, they're going

26:41.140 --> 26:43.900
to be going, what?

26:43.900 --> 26:48.660
What if like you sent a text message over PictoChat that said something like, you know,

26:48.660 --> 26:52.660
open the book on the table and then the book has a ring in it and then like you're on one

26:52.660 --> 26:53.660
knee. Would that be cute?

26:53.660 --> 26:58.460
That would be cute, but okay, just doing it in Animal Crossing is kind of lame.

26:58.460 --> 27:00.580
GS68 said the best thing ever.

27:00.580 --> 27:01.580
What?

27:01.580 --> 27:02.780
Will you be my 2P?

27:02.780 --> 27:03.780
What's that? Where?

27:03.780 --> 27:04.780
Second player.

27:04.780 --> 27:06.460
Will you be my 2P? I get it.

27:06.460 --> 27:07.460
That's cute.

27:07.460 --> 27:11.100
There's some great comments in chat tonight. You guys are funny. Escapist says, better

27:11.100 --> 27:16.680
PictoChat than Ping Pals. If I got proposed to in Ping Pals, I'd say no. I'd say you couldn't

27:16.680 --> 27:23.100
find something better. No. Get out. In fact, get out of my house. Let's see. I like footy

27:23.100 --> 27:31.420
monsters comment too. If I ever proposed to my girl on a game, she'd never see it. Wow.

27:31.420 --> 27:34.500
That's kind of like Loki and proposing to Nellie. How did you propose to Nellie? I can't

27:34.500 --> 27:35.500
remember.

27:35.500 --> 27:41.900
It wasn't over PictoChat. That's for sure. It sure as hell wasn't over Viva Pinata.

27:41.900 --> 27:44.700
Is it private or what? Can you share it?

27:44.700 --> 27:49.020
No. We were talking about getting married for a while, so we didn't really have a proposal

27:49.020 --> 27:52.940
or anything, but I sure as hell didn't do it over like Viva Pinata or anything.

27:52.940 --> 27:54.260
Did you get on one knee and everything?

27:54.260 --> 27:59.860
Actually, no, I didn't. Oh my God, you bastard. It doesn't matter. We were going to do it

27:59.860 --> 28:00.860
anyways.

28:00.860 --> 28:05.220
No, it's fine. The wedding was really nice, if nothing else. Even if you have no good

28:05.220 --> 28:06.220
proposal story.

28:06.220 --> 28:07.980
Even if you took my camera in the bathroom.

28:07.980 --> 28:14.940
Do we have to get into those discussions? You know, that was a very M-rated experience,

28:14.940 --> 28:16.700
and you know what they say about M-rated games?

28:16.700 --> 28:18.480
Let's buy them.

28:18.480 --> 28:24.420
That's right. Let's get them. This M-rated game is $300. M-rated games have higher scores

28:24.420 --> 28:31.540
and better sales. That is to be if a recent study by the electronic entertainment design

28:31.540 --> 28:37.820
and research firm is to be believed. They actually were evaluating some games that were

28:37.820 --> 28:44.000
rated mature by the ESRB, even though mature rated games are only about 10% of what's out

28:44.000 --> 28:49.580
there on what the ESRB rates. Apparently, these titles, quote, have both the highest

28:49.580 --> 28:55.140
average metacritic scores and the highest average gross sales in the United States.

28:55.140 --> 29:02.060
So apparently, having a mature rated game is actually a ticket to better sales. Who

29:02.060 --> 29:07.580
knows? What do you guys think? Is this story surprising? I actually think this is a little

29:07.580 --> 29:08.580
surprising.

29:08.580 --> 29:12.300
I don't think it has anything to do with the fact that it's rated M or anything. I just

29:12.300 --> 29:16.100
think a lot of the games that come out that are really good, they're your big blockbuster

29:16.100 --> 29:22.220
games, are rated M. I mean, let's look at the last few things that have come out. Bioshock

29:22.220 --> 29:30.780
was rated M. Stranglehold was rated M. Heavenly Sword, no, that's Teen. I think Halo's rated

29:30.780 --> 29:31.780
M.

29:31.780 --> 29:37.440
Okay, and that's fine for the hardcore gamers like us, but sometimes us hardcore gamers

29:37.440 --> 29:41.960
keep discounting the casual gamers. You know, it wasn't like the top-selling game last year

29:41.960 --> 29:43.860
based on some movie, you know?

29:43.860 --> 29:44.860
Cars?

29:44.860 --> 29:45.860
Yeah, Cars.

29:45.860 --> 29:46.860
That was a horrible game.

29:46.860 --> 29:51.020
But, you know, Cars is an E-rated game, I'm sure. It would be kind of cool if there was

29:51.020 --> 29:52.460
an M-rated Cars edition.

29:52.460 --> 29:56.940
It might make it a little bit better, but not much.

29:56.940 --> 30:03.740
So anyway, if you want to visit the Electronic Entertainment Design and Research, it's EEDAR.com,

30:03.740 --> 30:08.460
and they have a whole little press release about it on their site. So check it out.

30:08.460 --> 30:15.460
And hopefully this will bode well for the upcoming release of Manhunt 2, but we'll see.

30:15.460 --> 30:18.800
So that's all I have to say on the M-rated games. I'm actually looking to see if there's

30:18.800 --> 30:21.040
anything in chat here.

30:21.040 --> 30:25.260
Ryoma seems to agree, because mature-rated games include Metal Gear Solid, Halo, and

30:25.260 --> 30:27.260
GTA.

30:27.260 --> 30:29.140
Let's see.

30:29.140 --> 30:34.120
No Chilly No Pity says, that's weird. Comedy films potentially make a lot more rated as

30:34.120 --> 30:39.100
PG-13 versus R. Kind of an interesting comparison there.

30:39.100 --> 30:42.260
But Ross Deal UT says, well, that's in theaters. What about DVD?

30:42.260 --> 30:43.260
Hmm.

30:43.260 --> 30:44.260
Interesting.

30:44.260 --> 30:51.160
Well, in other news, speaking of news since you brought up movies, Activision has a demo

30:51.160 --> 30:59.660
out for Spider-Man Friend or Foe on Xbox Live. It's 432 megabytes, and what you do is you

30:59.660 --> 31:05.900
either play as Spider-Man or you are in a co-op mode with either the Green Goblin or

31:05.900 --> 31:12.380
Venom. And you can, in the demo, you fight Dr. Octopus, which is kind of cool.

31:12.380 --> 31:19.260
So it's going to be on PS2, 360, and Wii put out by Next Level Games. They also gave us

31:19.260 --> 31:24.020
Mario Strikers. Mario Strikers Charged, I'm sorry.

31:24.020 --> 31:27.140
And there's a PC version, I think, too.

31:27.140 --> 31:32.100
I was also going to say, there's some other stuff that's come out on Live. They had the

31:32.100 --> 31:36.820
demo for, well, it's actually another demo, I guess, for Juice 2. It's a multiplayer demo

31:36.820 --> 31:44.360
now, so you can check that out as well. I want to say Tony Hawk's Proving Grounds also

31:44.360 --> 31:49.660
up there now. There's another one, too.

31:49.660 --> 31:52.500
Have you played all the demos, Loki? Are you pretty good at staying on top of those?

31:52.500 --> 31:55.220
I try to. I haven't gone around to a lot of them yet.

31:55.220 --> 31:57.420
So what are the ones we need to be playing?

31:57.420 --> 32:01.580
I would say Tony Hawk's going to be pretty good. I mean, usually Tony Hawk games are

32:01.580 --> 32:07.820
pretty fun. Definitely play Flat-Out Ultimate Carnage. I cannot stress that enough. That

32:07.820 --> 32:11.580
game is so awesome.

32:11.580 --> 32:16.920
Timeshift might be okay. I don't know, I played an old-ass demo for it back when it was owned

32:16.920 --> 32:24.660
by Atari, and it was okay then. I don't know if I'd buy that game, though, or not.

32:24.660 --> 32:31.460
I would say, let's see, on PlayStation 3, I know Ratchet and Clank's, if you pre-order

32:31.460 --> 32:37.700
it, you can get the demo with that. And then I was going to say they have Pixel Junk Racers,

32:37.700 --> 32:44.580
but that's not really a demo, I guess. I don't know. There's still a lot of stuff. I'm sure

32:44.580 --> 32:47.260
more demos are going to be coming out soon, especially the Tokyo Game Show and how they

32:47.260 --> 32:49.140
do that bringing it home stuff.

32:49.140 --> 32:51.300
True. Hoping for some really good shit.

32:51.300 --> 32:57.300
SSJ100Matt says, I hear the new Flat-Out is getting closer and closer to a Burnout clone.

32:57.300 --> 33:01.300
I think we talked about this a little bit last week. The box art certainly is, but the

33:01.300 --> 33:03.420
game itself, Logi, from what you see?

33:03.420 --> 33:06.660
Burnout's going in a completely different direction, so I guess you can compare it to

33:06.660 --> 33:11.740
some of the older Burnouts, but the new Burnout game's nothing like it.

33:11.740 --> 33:14.540
Isn't the new Burnout game more like Test Drive, where it's like an open world?

33:14.540 --> 33:20.740
Sort of. It's just really open. I don't even know how to really describe it. It's just

33:20.740 --> 33:24.940
kind of like an open world where you're driving around doing stunts, crashing. I guess it's

33:24.940 --> 33:28.740
sort of like Test Drive, but a lot more interesting.

33:28.740 --> 33:34.980
All right. Very cool. All right. Well, let's get into some release dates and talk about

33:34.980 --> 33:38.420
not just the things you can download on Xbox Live, but what you can go run out and pick

33:38.420 --> 33:41.420
up at stores this week around the globe.

33:41.420 --> 33:46.900
Lots of big stuff. This week, of course, starting to really get into the fourth quarter stuff,

33:46.900 --> 33:51.500
including, as I mentioned, there's a demo out for Just Two Hot Import Nights coming

33:51.500 --> 33:57.660
out on PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 this week, as well as, well, PlayStation 3's coming out

33:57.660 --> 34:01.660
the week after, because you know all those PlayStation 3 delays.

34:01.660 --> 34:07.860
And then, on PlayStation 2, if you happen to love Karaoke, well, there's quite a bit

34:07.860 --> 34:12.860
of it this week. Sing Star 80s is coming out both the game by itself and a game bundled

34:12.860 --> 34:19.380
with microphones, as well as, Sing Star Amped in both versions there.

34:19.380 --> 34:27.540
And let's see, also on PlayStation 2 and 360, we have Warriors Orochi, which is a very unique

34:27.540 --> 34:33.180
game by Koei that combines Samurai Warriors with Dynasty Warriors. So, if you love the

34:33.180 --> 34:37.700
Dynasty Warriors games, it's yet another one.

34:37.700 --> 34:43.420
On PSP, Coded Arms Contagion, finally coming out, as well as Yu-Gi-Oh! GX...

34:43.420 --> 34:45.420
I thought that game got cancelled.

34:45.420 --> 34:46.940
No, that was the PlayStation 3 one.

34:46.940 --> 34:47.940
Oh.

34:47.940 --> 34:57.340
Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 2, also coming out on PSP. Let's see, on PS3 this week, Stuntman

34:57.340 --> 35:04.220
Ignition, finally coming out. And then, also on 360, Eternal Sonata, which is going to

35:04.220 --> 35:05.220
be pretty big.

35:05.220 --> 35:06.300
Sold. I'm so getting that game.

35:06.300 --> 35:10.900
What were you telling me about Eternal Sonata before the show started tonight, Jamie?

35:10.900 --> 35:15.540
Well, I'd know that Chopin killed himself by drinking cholera and vested water because

35:15.540 --> 35:16.540
of his lifestyle.

35:16.540 --> 35:20.020
Yes, he was a gay guy or something, right?

35:20.020 --> 35:21.020
Yes.

35:21.020 --> 35:22.020
Where'd you read this, Wikipedia?

35:22.020 --> 35:23.540
No, actually I learned it in music theory in high school.

35:23.540 --> 35:28.180
Wow. That's interesting. But, like, you know, I totally read that the game is based on the

35:28.180 --> 35:33.700
hallucinations he had before he died. That's, like, all kinds of rad, in my opinion, but

35:33.700 --> 35:35.980
we'll talk more about it later, I guess.

35:35.980 --> 35:41.220
I'm also coming out, Blades and Angels 2, Secret Missions of World War II. The first

35:41.220 --> 35:46.020
game is kind of eh, but, you know, hey, you might like it.

35:46.020 --> 35:51.020
Let's see, on the Wii, My Sims, also coming out on the DS as well.

35:51.020 --> 35:55.500
Cosmic Family, if you have really little kids that like to learn, there you go.

35:55.500 --> 36:00.980
Fishing Master, which is that Hudson-based fishing game, which I didn't think we really

36:00.980 --> 36:04.380
saw too much of it, but eh, if you like fishing, it might be cool.

36:04.380 --> 36:11.340
Mercury Meltdown Revolution, it's a cool puzzle game, only $20 for the Wii, so check it out.

36:11.340 --> 36:15.460
Anubis 2, eh, budget game, so, eh, maybe.

36:15.460 --> 36:20.180
And then, Dewey's Adventure is also coming out on the Wii.

36:20.180 --> 36:23.300
Let's see, DS, my god, there's, like, way too much stuff this week.

36:23.300 --> 36:29.540
DS, Digimon World Dawn and Dusk, as well as, I believe, Digimon World is also coming out

36:29.540 --> 36:32.760
on Data Squad on PS2.

36:32.760 --> 36:40.380
We've also got, let's see here, Frisbee Disc Bundle, which is Frisbee Disc Golf and Ultimate

36:40.380 --> 36:42.580
Frisbee, woo hoo.

36:42.580 --> 36:48.060
Nancy Drew is going to be getting the game, Namco Museum, actually, I hear the Nancy Drew

36:48.060 --> 36:52.020
games are pretty awesome, I shouldn't just pass it off because it's a Nancy Drew game,

36:52.020 --> 36:53.820
I've actually heard they're pretty awesome.

36:53.820 --> 37:00.220
Namco Museum DS is coming out, and that's kind of interesting, I guess.

37:00.220 --> 37:04.580
On PC, World in Conflict is coming out, I know that's going to be pretty big.

37:04.580 --> 37:11.380
Then some of these weird games here, Big Buck Hunter, 30,000 games, I Love Kittens, I Love

37:11.380 --> 37:20.060
Puppies, and, I Love Puppies 2, Loki, Stranglehold, I guess, is coming out as well, woo.

37:20.060 --> 37:26.500
And I think there might be a couple other things on PS2 here, let me take a look, and

37:26.500 --> 37:33.820
Pro Lancer 5, that one's actually supposed to be pretty big, some crappy Honda SBK07

37:33.820 --> 37:40.780
Superbike game, and Safe and Filter Dark Mirror, and that's it.

37:40.780 --> 37:48.180
Wow, lots and lots of stuff coming out this week in the US, and you know, the Japanese

37:48.180 --> 37:52.020
launch calendar looks pretty full as well, not quite as much as we've got over here,

37:52.020 --> 37:54.660
but certainly there's quite a bit of stuff coming out over there.

37:54.660 --> 38:00.380
The Madden 08 Japanese version makes its way to the Xbox 360 this week on September 20,

38:00.380 --> 38:03.980
2007, and it does look like it's localized there for Japan with the text and all that

38:03.980 --> 38:08.740
stuff, but I imagine it's still the same teams, because it's still the NFL, so there you have

38:08.740 --> 38:09.740
it.

38:09.740 --> 38:15.340
Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Sengoku Musou Katana, which I'm imagining is a little

38:15.340 --> 38:18.060
bit of a sword fighting game, I'm trying to look at some of the screenshots, and it kind

38:18.060 --> 38:21.980
of reminds me, what's that old Sega arcade game, they have it like Dave and Buster's,

38:21.980 --> 38:24.180
you can swing the sword around, what the hell is that game?

38:24.180 --> 38:25.180
I can't remember the name of it.

38:25.180 --> 38:27.420
Oh, I know what you're talking about, too.

38:27.420 --> 38:32.180
It looks like it might be this kind of game, I don't know, so we'll go.

38:32.180 --> 38:33.180
Go with that.

38:33.180 --> 38:38.400
Anyhow, Burnout Dominator is coming out on the Playstation 2 in Japan, so check that out,

38:38.400 --> 38:44.700
and coming out as well on the Playstation 2, Keniro no Korda 2 Anchor is coming out,

38:44.700 --> 38:48.940
it's an RPG, also coming out on the Playstation 2, huh?

38:48.940 --> 38:52.740
By the way, I have to correct myself, because once I thought about it, I realized it wasn't

38:52.740 --> 38:54.300
upon it, it was Tchaikovsky.

38:54.300 --> 38:55.300
Oh.

38:55.300 --> 39:00.180
Oh, is it because, uh, people did their research on Wikipedia or something?

39:00.180 --> 39:04.620
No, I knew that, and once I said it, I was like, no, that wasn't who it was, I'm sorry,

39:04.620 --> 39:05.620
I'm correcting myself.

39:05.620 --> 39:07.420
It's all good.

39:07.420 --> 39:10.620
I'm still looking forward to the game, because it is based on hallucinations, one way or

39:10.620 --> 39:11.620
the other.

39:11.620 --> 39:12.620
I like hallucinations.

39:12.620 --> 39:15.800
It's based on the 70s!

39:15.800 --> 39:19.660
It's basically the musical hair in video game form, but not really.

39:19.660 --> 39:25.340
Anyway, back to Japanese releases, Saint Beast, Rasen no Shu is coming out on the Playstation

39:25.340 --> 39:29.780
2 as well, an action-based game, Saint Beast.

39:29.780 --> 39:36.340
Coming out on the Nintendo DS, Deltora Quest, Sevensu no Hoseki is coming out, it's another

39:36.340 --> 39:42.900
RPG game on the DS, as well as Elemental Monster, which looks to be a card-based action game.

39:42.900 --> 39:45.820
Not sure what that is, if that's based on anime or what that is, but that's coming out

39:45.820 --> 39:47.540
on the DS over there in Japan.

39:47.540 --> 39:53.820
PSP is getting Burnout Dominator on the 20th over in Japan, and R-Type Tactics comes out

39:53.820 --> 40:00.540
on, it's a strategy tactical game based on R-Type on the PSP, pretty awesome.

40:00.540 --> 40:01.540
So there you have it.

40:01.540 --> 40:02.540
It's not really R-Type then.

40:02.540 --> 40:03.540
It is R-Type.

40:03.540 --> 40:08.300
It's R-Type-ish, I don't know, but there you have it, that's what's coming out on the Japanese

40:08.300 --> 40:09.300
calendar for September 20th.

40:09.300 --> 40:11.400
It's only R-Type if you fly around and shoot stuff.

40:11.400 --> 40:14.900
You do, in a turn-based strategy fashion.

40:14.900 --> 40:16.780
That's not fun.

40:16.780 --> 40:18.660
So how about some European release dates?

40:18.660 --> 40:19.660
How about it?

40:19.660 --> 40:27.060
Well, for our buddies in the UK, on the 20th, Loco Roco Cocorecho comes out on PlayStation

40:27.060 --> 40:34.900
3, 21st Drawn to Life and My Sims, also My Sims is coming out on the Wii, and why is

40:34.900 --> 40:37.100
there two listings for My Sims on the Wii?

40:37.100 --> 40:38.100
Anyway.

40:38.100 --> 40:44.340
It also, oh, there's two listings for it on Wii and DS, and one of them has a space and

40:44.340 --> 40:47.420
one doesn't, I guess that makes it special.

40:47.420 --> 40:53.420
SingStar Rock Ballads on PlayStation 2, Stranglehold on PC, and World in Conflict on PC.

40:53.420 --> 40:57.020
Oh yeah, and Halo 3 on the 26, who cares.

40:57.020 --> 41:00.580
And just in case if anyone's actually thinking about buying My Sims, just so you know, it's

41:00.580 --> 41:04.300
not multiplayer, it's only one player.

41:04.300 --> 41:05.300
Totally lame.

41:05.300 --> 41:07.300
It's poo.

41:07.300 --> 41:08.300
Yeah.

41:08.300 --> 41:09.300
Anywho.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.300
Alright.

41:10.300 --> 41:20.580
One thing that's not quite as lame, but you can actually get Ratchet & Clank, the demo,

41:20.580 --> 41:26.460
which will be coming out October the 4th, and looks pretty awesome, and that'll be on

41:26.460 --> 41:31.140
PlayStation 3, actually a good PlayStation 3 game coming out for once.

41:31.140 --> 41:36.220
And if you can't wait until October 4th like I did, you can also pre-order your game at

41:36.220 --> 41:41.300
GameStop, and they have a demo disc for you.

41:41.300 --> 41:45.100
I'm just snickering in chat because Escapist just said, oh I thought you guys were talking

41:45.100 --> 41:48.740
about a game called My Sins for a second.

41:48.740 --> 41:50.540
My god, these people need to only hear it.

41:50.540 --> 41:54.860
Someone thought I said, when I said Big Butt Hunter, they thought, Big Butt Hunter?

41:54.860 --> 41:58.020
I gotta get that game on PC, that's gonna be awesome.

41:58.020 --> 41:59.980
That would be like Boonga Boonga.

41:59.980 --> 42:00.980
Hosted by Sir Mix-a-Lot.

42:00.980 --> 42:01.980
Big Butt Hunter.

42:01.980 --> 42:03.100
That would be like Boonga Boonga.

42:03.100 --> 42:04.740
Oh my god.

42:04.740 --> 42:06.340
Mark Sakura, look at her butt.

42:06.340 --> 42:08.340
It is so big.

42:08.340 --> 42:09.340
Wow.

42:09.340 --> 42:15.580
And now, why are they talking about, gosh, our chat room is random tonight.

42:15.580 --> 42:21.060
JV Monn says, I want Silent Hill, the Hannah Montana edition.

42:21.060 --> 42:24.580
To which Hippolytus responds, Silent Hill, Hannah Montana would never be as awesome as

42:24.580 --> 42:26.740
Silent Hill, Britney Spears.

42:26.740 --> 42:29.180
Go figure.

42:29.180 --> 42:33.020
Although I do think in the next Silent Hill game, Pyramid Head should come out and go,

42:33.020 --> 42:34.900
it's Pyramid Head, bitch.

42:34.900 --> 42:36.140
Like the new Britney song?

42:36.140 --> 42:37.580
Forget it.

42:37.580 --> 42:41.020
Anyhow, more games on the way to the Playstation 3.

42:41.020 --> 42:44.580
I don't know a whole lot about this game, so hopefully, you know, I haven't been following

42:44.580 --> 42:49.420
PS3 like I should be, like a good amateur game journalist.

42:49.420 --> 42:54.620
But on November 20th on the Playstation 3, Uncharted, Drake's Fortune is coming out.

42:54.620 --> 42:58.500
So Loki, what is so amazing about this game that I should be paying attention to it for?

42:58.500 --> 43:02.900
Well it's sort of amazing, it's basically Tomb Raider with a guy.

43:02.900 --> 43:05.620
I've done Tomb Raider, you know what I mean?

43:05.620 --> 43:06.620
Is he scantily clad?

43:06.620 --> 43:07.620
He's not scantily clad.

43:07.620 --> 43:11.420
They're companions kind of like Tomb Raider and he'd be like, Jones, there's a chick in

43:11.420 --> 43:17.260
it, and you know, he shoots things and it's in a jungle, woo!

43:17.260 --> 43:20.660
Go Naughty Dog for original content for the PS3.

43:20.660 --> 43:21.660
That's funny.

43:21.660 --> 43:26.460
Well there you have it, you can check it out for yourself on November 20th when Uncharted,

43:26.460 --> 43:27.780
Drake's Fortune comes to the PS3.

43:27.780 --> 43:30.640
Let me put it this way, you know what, if it's fun, I don't care if it's like Tomb Raider

43:30.640 --> 43:31.640
with a guy.

43:31.640 --> 43:33.140
Just wait, there's nothing else.

43:33.140 --> 43:34.140
So enjoy.

43:34.140 --> 43:37.580
Well there you have it.

43:37.580 --> 43:42.780
I know I'll be first in line, but not really to get Uncharted.

43:42.780 --> 43:49.380
Well we did discuss this a little bit earlier, but Eternal Sonata is coming out on PS3.

43:49.380 --> 43:53.780
It has been confirmed, and we've already talked about it.

43:53.780 --> 43:54.780
Shh!

43:54.780 --> 43:56.980
What hasn't been confirmed?

43:56.980 --> 44:00.900
Wait a minute, we did talk about Eternal Sonata, but we were talking about it on the 360, so

44:00.900 --> 44:04.340
now we're hearing that the game is actually coming out on the PlayStation 3?

44:04.340 --> 44:05.340
As well?

44:05.340 --> 44:06.340
Namco says no.

44:06.340 --> 44:07.340
What?

44:07.340 --> 44:08.340
Yeah.

44:08.340 --> 44:11.380
As I seem to recall, there's been a lot of drama that's played out on the internet this

44:11.380 --> 44:15.740
week where, you know, oh yeah, for one, we're not supposed to talk about Namco's release

44:15.740 --> 44:23.620
calendar on this show, but they seem to consistently do this, where they put these things out there,

44:23.620 --> 44:25.240
whether it be on the ESRB, right?

44:25.240 --> 44:27.300
Wasn't Eternal Sonata listed on the ESRB?

44:27.300 --> 44:28.300
That it was pulled.

44:28.300 --> 44:29.300
Twice.

44:29.300 --> 44:32.060
It was on their own freaking website, then it was pulled.

44:32.060 --> 44:35.340
It was also put back onto the ESRB list.

44:35.340 --> 44:37.900
And now it's on the ESRB list again.

44:37.900 --> 44:39.780
And it was on their website.

44:39.780 --> 44:43.740
It's almost like Namco's doing this on purpose to keep getting the story bumped up to the

44:43.740 --> 44:44.740
top of blogs.

44:44.740 --> 44:48.780
I mean, Eternal Sonata is coming out this week after all, hmm.

44:48.780 --> 44:49.780
How about Who Cares?

44:49.780 --> 44:56.960
Let me put it this way, it's, obviously it's gonna still come out on PS3.

44:56.960 --> 45:00.500
That is, I mean, if you believe that it's not, you're an idiot.

45:00.500 --> 45:04.660
And I believe also Beautiful Katamari is listed on there for PlayStation 3 and the Wii as

45:04.660 --> 45:05.900
well to be determined.

45:05.900 --> 45:11.180
Which, you know, we didn't tell you that six months ago when the story first hit the internet.

45:11.180 --> 45:12.820
I bet you anything.

45:12.820 --> 45:14.580
We never changed our stance.

45:14.580 --> 45:15.580
Everybody else did.

45:15.580 --> 45:18.900
I bet you anything, it's still coming out next spring.

45:18.900 --> 45:19.900
I agree.

45:19.900 --> 45:21.300
It's confirmed in my head.

45:21.300 --> 45:27.820
Not that Wii would, you know, say that, you know, but, you know.

45:27.820 --> 45:33.740
Well I mean, Katamari on the PSP came out in March last, well was it 2005 or something?

45:33.740 --> 45:36.860
I mean, I don't know.

45:36.860 --> 45:43.740
I could see it coming out in spring with like a timed, exclusive, whatever, cause it's Katamari,

45:43.740 --> 45:44.740
come on.

45:44.740 --> 45:47.420
I mean, of course they're gonna put it on the Wii, it's got TILTI shit.

45:47.420 --> 45:48.420
It's gimmicky.

45:48.420 --> 45:49.420
People love gimmicky.

45:49.420 --> 45:52.580
So, you know, it's just like the Wii and PS3.

45:52.580 --> 45:57.180
I'm just, I'm just curious why like Namco is having like all these like, oh it's coming

45:57.180 --> 45:59.940
out, oh no it's not, oh it's an exclusive, oh no it's not.

45:59.940 --> 46:00.940
I mean.

46:00.940 --> 46:03.640
Maybe they should start, you know, and this goes for all game companies.

46:03.640 --> 46:08.180
If you don't want information put out there, you need to really be coordinating with every

46:08.180 --> 46:11.940
single department of your company to make sure this information doesn't get out.

46:11.940 --> 46:12.940
The right information.

46:12.940 --> 46:17.860
Coordinate your marketing people with, you know, the web people, with the, I don't know,

46:17.860 --> 46:18.860
ratings people.

46:18.860 --> 46:23.020
I mean seriously, if it's on your website, people are gonna go, oh I think it's actually

46:23.020 --> 46:26.540
coming out now because it's actually listed on your website.

46:26.540 --> 46:29.780
And don't say, oh someone made a mistake, they weren't supposed to put that up there

46:29.780 --> 46:30.780
yet.

46:30.780 --> 46:31.780
Oops.

46:31.780 --> 46:35.780
And don't talk about it in gag order and everybody better show them, we'll sue, we'll sue, we'll

46:35.780 --> 46:36.780
sue.

46:36.780 --> 46:41.100
Hey, how much you wanna bet that there may be, and this is just pure guessing, Tokyo

46:41.100 --> 46:45.180
Game Show is, you know, right around the corner, how much you wanna bet there's an announcement

46:45.180 --> 46:47.560
of some sorts.

46:47.560 --> 46:52.700
Just like how right before E3 happened, a certain no-name website said something and,

46:52.700 --> 46:54.700
you know, somebody wasn't happy about it.

46:54.700 --> 46:55.700
Possibly.

46:55.700 --> 46:56.700
Maybe.

46:56.700 --> 47:01.380
Anyhow, thank you for that story on Eternal Sonata, Jamie.

47:01.380 --> 47:05.740
In my mind, my head says yes.

47:05.740 --> 47:07.420
It's never wrong.

47:07.420 --> 47:15.140
Anyways, as we alluded to last week, that it was only a matter of time before the impenetrable

47:15.140 --> 47:21.780
3.6 firmware of the PSP was cracked, and guess what?

47:21.780 --> 47:24.980
Wait, wait, wait, wait, I wanna know why Darkstalker's laughing, are you laughing because of Loki's

47:24.980 --> 47:26.980
big vocabulary?

47:26.980 --> 47:28.500
Nothing.

47:28.500 --> 47:36.180
Anyways, so Team M33 has cracked it, there is now a custom version of the firmware out

47:36.180 --> 47:38.620
there that allows you to run some homebrew.

47:38.620 --> 47:43.540
The problem is right now they can't get support for the 1.5 kernel, which, you know, before

47:43.540 --> 47:47.940
it was able to run all the homebrew stuff, so now people are kinda having to go back,

47:47.940 --> 47:53.860
retool things, so some things work, some things don't, eventually though, as things progress

47:53.860 --> 47:59.820
and more firmwares come out, that they will be able to support more things.

47:59.820 --> 48:03.500
There's a small list of stuff I think that they support some of the emulators, I don't

48:03.500 --> 48:07.040
think the ISOs work yet, and then some other stuff.

48:07.040 --> 48:12.340
But hopefully that means I can put homebrew onto my TV, because I did happen to go through

48:12.340 --> 48:19.100
the process of loading it onto my PSP Slim, and let me tell you, it's not that easy, but

48:19.100 --> 48:23.620
once you've done it, it's pretty simple, it basically involves building the Pandora's

48:23.620 --> 48:31.280
battery, which is interesting in itself, and what you do with that is you, I guess they

48:31.280 --> 48:36.980
call it extending the Pandora's battery, you basically put some parts of different firmwares

48:36.980 --> 48:40.900
on there and then it works.

48:40.900 --> 48:44.020
Once you've done the Pandora's battery, it's pretty easy, and they actually have programs

48:44.020 --> 48:49.140
out there to make it walk you through step by step what to do, so it's pretty simple,

48:49.140 --> 48:53.080
but definitely worth checking out, I'm sure that we're gonna see some more stuff coming

48:53.080 --> 48:54.080
from that.

48:54.080 --> 49:03.820
Of course, Sony hearing that released 3.7 on the PSP, the firmware to break what other

49:03.820 --> 49:09.700
people have done on 3.6, and now they have custom theme support, which I will remind

49:09.700 --> 49:14.840
everybody has been available in the homebrew scene for quite a while now, but you can download

49:14.840 --> 49:18.740
official themes, which also, by the way, can be cracked apart and put on custom.

49:18.740 --> 49:22.420
Wait, wait, wait, I thought there's been themes on the PSP forever.

49:22.420 --> 49:26.440
This is actually like customizing themes, you can adjust, you can put like a wallpaper

49:26.440 --> 49:30.780
in the background and stuff like that, this is actually changing all the icons, etc.

49:30.780 --> 49:33.420
Oh, that's interesting, okay, cool.

49:33.420 --> 49:38.960
You can do this on custom firmwares right now, and it's been available for a long time,

49:38.960 --> 49:45.140
but people have already found ways to crack those theme files apart, and yeah, just nothing

49:45.140 --> 49:46.180
to save.

49:46.180 --> 49:49.460
Other things have been supported, I guess, more, where you can assign buttons in remote

49:49.460 --> 49:55.900
play, so maybe that will allow you to play lair a little bit easier on the PSP.

49:55.900 --> 50:01.780
I guess sequential playback is now supported under video, and simultaneous playback under,

50:01.780 --> 50:08.560
I guess, music in photos, so you can play music while viewing your photos.

50:08.560 --> 50:12.180
Other interesting stuff, right after this came out, I guess they had dumped that firmware,

50:12.180 --> 50:18.260
and now there's 3.71, so it will never end, never ever.

50:18.260 --> 50:23.980
Well, you know, I guess like Homebrew and changing little things around is one thing,

50:23.980 --> 50:27.220
but when folks can play pirated games on there, Sony's got to do what they got to do.

50:27.220 --> 50:31.860
Yeah, they got to do what they got to do, and they got to do it, they got to do it not

50:31.860 --> 50:32.860
very well either.

50:32.860 --> 50:36.420
They have to be mediocre.

50:36.420 --> 50:37.420
Well that's fine.

50:37.420 --> 50:38.420
I think you're going to be mediocre because that's it.

50:38.420 --> 50:42.460
I applaud their mediocrity because, you know what, that allows me to have a lot more fun

50:42.460 --> 50:43.460
with my PSP.

50:43.460 --> 50:45.460
Oh my gosh, alright.

50:45.460 --> 50:50.100
Moving on, I want to talk about Manhunt 2, because god damn, this game just cannot stay

50:50.100 --> 50:55.300
out of the news in anticipation for its Halloween release date, I suppose.

50:55.300 --> 51:00.380
Well people have been asking a whole lot about how did the game come down from an AO rating

51:00.380 --> 51:01.620
to an M rating?

51:01.620 --> 51:03.820
What exactly was taken out of the game?

51:03.820 --> 51:09.020
Well IGN got to take a look at what was going on with the game and what exactly was changed,

51:09.020 --> 51:13.860
and one of their reporters is actually reporting that yes, there have been some changes.

51:13.860 --> 51:18.220
For instance, you might remember an earlier report where the killer could use a, guys

51:18.220 --> 51:22.660
cross your legs, the killer could use a pair of pliers to literally rip the balls off of

51:22.660 --> 51:25.900
a hunter.

51:25.900 --> 51:27.380
Well that scene has been taken out.

51:27.380 --> 51:28.380
So damn.

51:28.380 --> 51:31.380
I was looking forward to that.

51:31.380 --> 51:32.780
Well that's okay.

51:32.780 --> 51:35.740
Here's the thing though, one of the biggest changes that they've done is that Rockstar

51:35.740 --> 51:41.180
has made a blur effect to some of the major death blows in the game.

51:41.180 --> 51:45.580
So in the M rated version there's like this blur effect that goes on or the graphics get

51:45.580 --> 51:48.980
darkened a little bit, so it's really hard to tell what's going on because it becomes

51:48.980 --> 51:53.260
like this kind of like motion blur type thing that doesn't make it so clear.

51:53.260 --> 52:00.220
Well that's why they made the killing the crazy 88 scene in Kill Bill black and white

52:00.220 --> 52:01.220
in the US.

52:01.220 --> 52:02.220
That's true.

52:02.220 --> 52:03.220
That's how censorship things happen.

52:03.220 --> 52:06.900
So yeah, that's kind of interesting, but what, changing it to black and white made it that

52:06.900 --> 52:07.900
much different?

52:07.900 --> 52:10.340
I'm not seeing the blood as red or something.

52:10.340 --> 52:11.700
I've seen it without it.

52:11.700 --> 52:12.700
Wow.

52:12.700 --> 52:14.020
It's ridiculous is all it is.

52:14.020 --> 52:15.020
That's just like the...

52:15.020 --> 52:16.860
It's people who aren't getting laid.

52:16.860 --> 52:20.140
That's just like when they change the blood to sweat.

52:20.140 --> 52:22.980
That will forever be my favorite rating thing that was done.

52:22.980 --> 52:26.780
Let's pet someone's neck and look at how much sweat comes out.

52:26.780 --> 52:29.740
Damn.

52:29.740 --> 52:31.220
So there you have it.

52:31.220 --> 52:35.340
Those are some of the big changes that are in the Manhunt 2.

52:35.340 --> 52:40.020
I would still say though, I think this game is going to come out and I think the adults

52:40.020 --> 52:42.660
only version will still come out on the PC later on.

52:42.660 --> 52:45.300
Okay, but here's some other interesting things though.

52:45.300 --> 52:47.180
Apparently they're talking about different cut scenes.

52:47.180 --> 52:53.240
In one cut scene, a masked killer uses a power saw to slice a man's bulging belly as the

52:53.240 --> 52:56.580
victim lies helpless strapped to a table.

52:56.580 --> 52:59.900
That's okay for M, but oh my God.

52:59.900 --> 53:04.780
If they rip off fake balls on a goddamn 3D model of somebody...

53:04.780 --> 53:11.740
Well, I mean, that does kind of make everybody go, you know, that has them collectively go

53:11.740 --> 53:14.460
oh, hey, oh, crush your legs.

53:14.460 --> 53:15.460
Ow.

53:15.460 --> 53:16.460
The ESRB is so hilarious.

53:16.460 --> 53:19.060
So, well, I don't know.

53:19.060 --> 53:22.660
I have to admit my interest on this game is kind of, you know, at first it was kind of

53:22.660 --> 53:26.220
like, yeah, this might be kind of fun, but now I'm just like, eh.

53:26.220 --> 53:29.660
I mean, it just sounds like Uber violence the game and I'm just, I'm not, you know,

53:29.660 --> 53:33.860
I don't like those movies like Saw and stuff, so I probably won't like this game, so I don't

53:33.860 --> 53:34.860
think I'm going to buy it.

53:34.860 --> 53:39.220
Unless, I mean, unless it gets incredible reviews and there's something about the game

53:39.220 --> 53:42.020
I just have to see, I'm not really in it for the, you know...

53:42.020 --> 53:45.580
I'm kind of interested in the Wii murdering of people.

53:45.580 --> 53:49.780
That is interesting, but not, I don't know, I'll just go to your house and play it, man.

53:49.780 --> 53:54.380
To be very honest, there's not a lot of Wii games out there that I want to buy right now

53:54.380 --> 53:56.700
and unfortunately that's the next one in line.

53:56.700 --> 54:00.740
It's not necessarily that I want to go around murdering people with the Wii remotes, even

54:00.740 --> 54:04.340
though I do find humor in that, but I don't know.

54:04.340 --> 54:08.980
Now RossdielUT in our chatroom says, Manhunt 2, a trash game selling on controversy alone.

54:08.980 --> 54:10.280
Sad, sad thing.

54:10.280 --> 54:14.540
And I sort of agree, except I don't want to pass the game off as trash without having

54:14.540 --> 54:18.220
actually gotten to play it, but, you know, I will definitely kind of want to look at

54:18.220 --> 54:19.580
reviews and things.

54:19.580 --> 54:23.580
You know, this game certainly doesn't stay in the news for its incredible innovations

54:23.580 --> 54:25.720
that it's bringing to the gaming scene.

54:25.720 --> 54:28.440
I'll give you that, but look at Hostel.

54:28.440 --> 54:29.840
There's a perfect example.

54:29.840 --> 54:33.300
There's another movie that's probably trash that's selling on controversy alone.

54:33.300 --> 54:38.100
I won't say that the game won't sell, I'm just saying I don't care.

54:38.100 --> 54:41.940
So I didn't watch Hostel either, because I heard it was...

54:41.940 --> 54:42.940
I have no interest in those.

54:42.940 --> 54:43.940
I know, I know.

54:43.940 --> 54:47.980
Like, no, it's just weird, like sometimes I will watch the very gory movies, like The

54:47.980 --> 54:51.100
Descent was pretty gory and I loved it, but it was like...

54:51.100 --> 54:52.100
That's more suspense though, isn't it?

54:52.100 --> 54:55.980
Yeah, it was way, like, more, just the way it was directed over the years, it was scary.

54:55.980 --> 54:59.700
That's one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, The Descent.

54:59.700 --> 55:00.700
Anyway.

55:00.700 --> 55:07.580
Well, for other news though, regarding Manhunt 2, people were interviewed to see whether

55:07.580 --> 55:14.980
or not they would be interested in buying it and there were only 18% of the people polled

55:14.980 --> 55:18.660
who said they were going to buy it when it launches on Halloween.

55:18.660 --> 55:25.020
52% said, no, and 30% said, uh, what?

55:25.020 --> 55:27.540
That many people clicked a button that said, uh, what?

55:27.540 --> 55:28.540
And decided.

55:28.540 --> 55:30.540
Oh, okay.

55:30.540 --> 55:37.660
That's, well, so, so apparently only 18% of the, that's still, I don't know, I mean, 18%

55:37.660 --> 55:43.820
to me kind of seems like a large chunk of the gaming community, I mean, if you can sell

55:43.820 --> 55:47.300
out of one to every five people that own a Wii this game, that's still quite a lot of

55:47.300 --> 55:52.180
copies moved, so I don't think it's as bad as they're saying, but I think a good, a better

55:52.180 --> 55:59.100
question would be, were you planning to buy the adult only one and now you're not going

55:59.100 --> 56:00.100
to anymore?

56:00.100 --> 56:01.100
Exactly.

56:01.100 --> 56:02.100
I'm kind of curious to see what the result is of that one.

56:02.100 --> 56:05.820
At the end of the day though, it doesn't really matter to, like, any of the console makers,

56:05.820 --> 56:13.060
it really just fucks over Take-Two again and Rockstar, so, oh well, stop making such violent

56:13.060 --> 56:14.060
games.

56:14.060 --> 56:18.460
Yeah, but, oh well, I guess we'll see, I mean, again, it all really depends on the reviews

56:18.460 --> 56:19.460
for me.

56:19.460 --> 56:22.100
Release it on PC, un-rated, there you go.

56:22.100 --> 56:24.180
We'll see.

56:24.180 --> 56:25.180
You will see.

56:25.180 --> 56:32.340
Anyways, um, oops, I knocked the ferret on the floor, um, good, I hope it died.

56:32.340 --> 56:38.380
If you happen to be a stupid kid trying to buy games at GameStop, well, there might be

56:38.380 --> 56:43.700
one particular GameStop in South Dallas that won't be selling you games.

56:43.700 --> 56:49.360
In fact, he's breaking corporate policy and he refuses to sell games to school kids who

56:49.360 --> 56:54.460
can't prove that they're doing well in school and apparently the manager is Brandon Scott

56:54.460 --> 57:01.780
and he makes sure that an adult can verify that the child is getting good grades, otherwise

57:01.780 --> 57:03.820
he won't sell them a game.

57:03.820 --> 57:04.820
Any game.

57:04.820 --> 57:05.820
Ever.

57:05.820 --> 57:10.620
So, um, he says, I'm probably going to get in the trouble for this, but to me it's worth

57:10.620 --> 57:13.940
it because the kids understand that somebody cares.

57:13.940 --> 57:15.540
You know who doesn't care?

57:15.540 --> 57:18.460
Probably GameStop corporate and you're going to get fired.

57:18.460 --> 57:19.660
Congratulations.

57:19.660 --> 57:24.780
You know, I'm very tempted, like, there's a, you know, the part of me that is very like,

57:24.780 --> 57:28.500
you know, aha, people get what they deserve, aha, wants to kind of applaud what this guy

57:28.500 --> 57:33.220
is doing, but when I really kind of sit there and think about it, I go like, you know, this

57:33.220 --> 57:34.780
is kind of screwed up.

57:34.780 --> 57:35.780
It is screwed up.

57:35.780 --> 57:39.740
I mean, I think it should be up to the parents what the kids get, period.

57:39.740 --> 57:41.060
Now, now, period.

57:41.060 --> 57:45.900
I don't have a problem with him deciding to do that, if he owned his own game store, but

57:45.900 --> 57:50.500
he doesn't and so he's, you know, I think it's a great idea that you shouldn't sell

57:50.500 --> 57:54.780
games to kids that are stupid, but, you know, there's a lot of reasons not to sell games,

57:54.780 --> 57:55.780
you know, to certain kids.

57:55.780 --> 58:01.180
Hell, I was at a, a playing trade this week and I was looking at, they were doing their

58:01.180 --> 58:07.540
grand opening and there was a kid, no parents watching him, kid, couldn't have been like

58:07.540 --> 58:11.660
10, 11 years old playing Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

58:11.660 --> 58:12.660
Just sitting there playing.

58:12.660 --> 58:17.760
He's like, I just killed a hooker, you know, it's like, come on people and then you're

58:17.760 --> 58:22.380
bitching about, oh, I didn't know Billy was playing such a violent game.

58:22.380 --> 58:24.380
You may, you need the one, parents are stupid.

58:24.380 --> 58:27.940
Don't let a GameStop type store babysit your children then.

58:27.940 --> 58:31.860
What you need to do though, I mean, I applaud him for making that decision.

58:31.860 --> 58:37.020
I mean, granted, it's probably going to be great for the store, but, you know, once that

58:37.020 --> 58:38.860
off his conscience, great.

58:38.860 --> 58:40.180
He's not going to be able to do it though.

58:40.180 --> 58:44.500
I think at a GameStop and I'm afraid that, you know, once this news gets back to them

58:44.500 --> 58:45.740
that these can probably be fired.

58:45.740 --> 58:48.580
Let's go to the chat because the chat has some follow up here.

58:48.580 --> 58:53.760
I've got a GS68 in our chat room that says good grades does not equal good behavior.

58:53.760 --> 58:58.860
You know, that's, you know, there are a lot of kids there who weren't necessarily motivated.

58:58.860 --> 59:01.660
They might be good kids, they're just not motivated to get good grades.

59:01.660 --> 59:03.940
Whatever happened to me my senior year of high school.

59:03.940 --> 59:08.820
I was in school and stuff and if I would get good grades, my parents would reward me by

59:08.820 --> 59:10.060
buying me something, you know.

59:10.060 --> 59:13.940
That was kind of my thing too is that my parents did what this guy did.

59:13.940 --> 59:16.200
If I got good grades, I got stuff.

59:16.200 --> 59:21.860
If I didn't get good grades, I got, you know, locked in a cellar.

59:21.860 --> 59:22.860
So but...

59:22.860 --> 59:25.020
And silly Bob, you don't have a cellar.

59:25.020 --> 59:28.940
I had to live in the closet under the stairs like Harry Potter.

59:28.940 --> 59:33.780
The kids, if they can't buy their games from GameStop or whatever, they'll just go somewhere

59:33.780 --> 59:34.780
else.

59:34.780 --> 59:38.460
You don't, you're not the only fucking game store on the planet, you moron.

59:38.460 --> 59:39.460
I mean people...

59:39.460 --> 59:42.620
Well, Rama wants to say Loki, he was suspended.

59:42.620 --> 59:44.620
Way to go!

59:44.620 --> 59:45.620
That's what you get for doing good things.

59:45.620 --> 59:48.900
Dark Tetsuya says, well the adult should be there to buy the game anyway.

59:48.900 --> 59:49.900
Exactly.

59:49.900 --> 59:58.460
And Frisbee in their best Maury Povich impression says, you are not the father.

59:58.460 --> 59:59.460
Get it?

59:59.460 --> 01:00:00.460
Because the guy is not the father?

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:01.460
GameStop.

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:04.300
I don't even know if that was supposed to be an Maury Povich impression, I just felt

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.300
like saying it.

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:08.620
GameStop, you are not the father.

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:10.740
You are not the father.

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.900
Not the mama.

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:14.940
Yes, old school.

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:18.540
Escapist says, I've had eight year olds in my stores talking about how awesome Grand

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:19.860
Theft Auto was too.

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.140
But I wonder if a lot of that is hype.

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:24.780
Like you gotta wonder how many of those kids actually played the game.

01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:27.700
Like sometimes, I mean, obviously there's some screwed up kids like, you know, the one

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:29.340
Loki was talking about earlier playing the game.

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:32.700
But you gotta wonder, like sometimes eight year olds are just full of talk.

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:33.700
You know what I mean?

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:36.700
Like none of them have probably played the game, but they hear their brother talking

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.140
about it or something like that.

01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:40.140
I don't know.

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:44.260
It's a whole little tangent we'll say for another day.

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:45.540
That's poop-tastic.

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:48.900
But for today, I will get to another story.

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:52.740
If you don't want to buy your games at GameStop anymore in this, what was it, South Dallas

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:53.740
you said?

01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:54.740
South Dallas.

01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:57.100
So, well maybe you can go to Radio Shack now.

01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:01.420
Because even though some Radio Shack stores have been carrying games for a while, apparently

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:06.660
Radio Shack as a corporation will now start actually carrying more video games in a couple

01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:08.660
weeks.

01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:11.700
Weren't they doing a Halo 3 pre-sale there, I think?

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:12.700
Probably a lot of stores were.

01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:13.700
I don't know.

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:14.700
Who isn't?

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:16.620
I'm doing a Halo 3 pre-sale.

01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:19.300
You know Walmarts are staying open until midnight and everything.

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:20.300
I don't know.

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:21.300
It's a little bit exciting.

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:22.300
Isn't that it?

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:23.300
And the Halo 3's release is what?

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:24.300
Isn't it like next Friday?

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:28.620
I unfortunately was over at GameStop quite a bit this week, just for different reasons,

01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:30.620
buying systems.

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:36.300
But they had a sign in their door that said that the line starts at 9pm the night before

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:37.300
for Halo.

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:38.300
Geez.

01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:39.300
Hooray!

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.300
What day does Halo come out?

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:41.300
I forget.

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:42.300
25th.

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:43.300
25th?

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:44.300
Oh, so it's next Tuesday.

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.060
So, I cannot wait for it to be over.

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:47.700
I really cannot.

01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:51.660
Well, unfortunately what is not clear at this time, don't know if it's going to be, you

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:55.260
know, like they're going to turn the whole store into games like GameStop EV.

01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:56.420
Probably not.

01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:59.740
But I can see that they'll probably have a little corner of the store dedicated to video

01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:00.740
games.

01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:01.740
I mean, why not?

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:03.620
Because they sell a lot of the, you know, accessories and things anyway.

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:07.300
So, and they sell other types of gaming things, you know.

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:10.740
But you know what Radio Shack sells that's awesome that I used to have when I was a kid?

01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:11.740
Total tangent.

01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:12.740
RC cars.

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:16.940
That and you know those little things that were like, build 300 electronic devices in

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:17.940
one.

01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:20.260
And it had like the little springs and you could attach the wires to the springs and

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:23.180
build all these little devices, like they're different types of transits.

01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:27.580
Like you could build a little amateur radio or you could build a little light switch.

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:28.580
Like all these dumb little things.

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:29.580
I was learning about electronics.

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:30.580
Yeah.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.580
It was all kinds of cool.

01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:33.580
I got one at a garage sale years ago and I loved it.

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:34.580
I hate Radio Shack.

01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:38.140
They're so damn expensive when it comes to anything like component wise.

01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:44.500
You're buying video cables, audio cables, you're better off somewhere else, seriously.

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:48.420
I go to Radio Shack to buy lithium batteries and that's about it.

01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:49.500
There's cables.

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:51.340
I have a lot of AV cable needs.

01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:52.340
And I bought a microphone there before.

01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:53.340
Yeah, a microphone.

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:54.340
Oh, I think our microphones.

01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:55.340
Our old microphones were.

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:56.860
No, yeah, the old ones were.

01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:58.860
These are the newer ones from the guitar place, right?

01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:03.260
The one I used at my what to do pump up the volume for the longest time was Radio Shack.

01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:09.260
I was going to go to GameStop to buy some stuff for our setup at work for the LAN stuff,

01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:12.940
like some headsets and audio cables.

01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:15.140
It was going to cost me $80 to buy it there.

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:21.180
I ended up shopping this place that my co-workers recommended, cablewholesale.com.

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:24.380
I would say it was $15 instead of $80.

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:28.820
So just so you know, don't shop there.

01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:29.820
So here's my question.

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:33.360
Remember when the Wii launched, we went out and we gave orange soda to people and cookies

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.360
and stuff?

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.360
What should we do for the Halo 3 launch?

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.580
Should we go out on Monday night and do something for the kids in line?

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:38.580
Give them crack.

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:39.580
There's some difference.

01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:40.580
I don't want to go out on a Monday night.

01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:41.580
Loki's like, I'm tired.

01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:42.580
I am all.

01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:43.580
Let me sleep.

01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:44.580
Fuck this.

01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:45.580
I don't want to talk to Halo.

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:48.100
I mean, I guess you could bring him the Game Fuel shit.

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:50.160
I really don't want to talk to Halo fans.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.140
What about the journalist in you, Loki?

01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:54.500
Doesn't the journalist in you want to go out there and talk to the people?

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:56.860
I despise Halo 3 right now.

01:03:56.860 --> 01:03:58.500
Just, I don't know, retail sampling.

01:03:58.500 --> 01:03:59.500
That's your personal vendetta.

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:02.540
That is my personal vendetta.

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:03.860
I don't see the point.

01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:05.860
All right, well, we'll see.

01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:09.020
I like the idea of going out and giving him Game Fuel.

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.500
Maybe we'll see about that.

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.860
Ah, Game Fuel.

01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:12.860
All right.

01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:15.060
Ah, here's a little fuel for you guys.

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:18.940
It's a new website that you should be pointing your browsers to this week because, of course,

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:22.740
the one and only DarkSakura surfs the internet up and down and all around every week and

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:26.460
finds one website worthy of sharing with you all.

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:30.820
It's DarkSakura's website of the week, and she's going to tell you what it is right now.

01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:31.820
Do it.

01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:32.820
Right now.

01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:33.820
No.

01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:34.820
Yes.

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:35.820
I refuse.

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:41.580
Okay, my website of the week is actually DeviantArt again because, um, I'm going to plug a bunch

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:46.860
of people's DeviantArt sites like mine.

01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:51.300
So deviantart.com, and for those that maybe haven't heard this before, what is DeviantArt?

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:55.500
You go and put your art and whore yourself out for comments and page views.

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:58.380
Why am I doing DeviantArt?

01:04:58.380 --> 01:04:59.380
You know what?

01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:00.380
I'm not going to do DeviantArt.

01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:05.500
I'm going to do darksakura.com, the site I haven't updated in five years.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:09.860
You know, I'm thinking maybe when we would do the transitions, we should give you a new

01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:12.580
thing instead of the website of the week because you're running out of sites.

01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:16.260
I am, oh my god, because I'm going to the same ones every week now.

01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:18.100
Well here, I have an idea for you.

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:19.100
What?

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:21.740
Is that maybe starting episode 250, if you can find just like a couple more sites, take

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:25.100
us over 250, we'll have DarkSakura's classic game of the week.

01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:26.780
I would totally love to do that.

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:28.660
Because you know some obscure fucking shit.

01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:29.660
I do.

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:30.660
Alright.

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:34.500
I mean, we just had here last week having a conversation about Neutopia.

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:35.500
Yeah.

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:39.460
So, we're going to have, so coming soon, DarkSakura's website of the week will be replaced with

01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:41.220
DarkSakura's classic game of the week.

01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:42.220
That'll be fun.

01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:43.220
It'll be obscureshit.com.

01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:45.420
I wonder if that's a site.

01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:49.260
RossDielUT says, Loki only hates Halo 3 because it's popular.

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:51.620
No, I don't hate Halo 3 because it's popular.

01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:55.660
I hate it because all my customers are complaining, when am I going to get Halo 3, and you really

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:59.360
need it on a street date because it's going to, you know, really, it's going to suck if

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.360
we don't have it.

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:01.360
When's it coming in?

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:02.580
When's it coming in?

01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:07.460
I hate, I hated when even the Wii came out because it was a pain in the ass and we knew

01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:10.180
we couldn't get them on time and all that stuff.

01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:14.140
Halo 3, everybody wants this damn thing and they're all coming out of the woodwork and

01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:18.740
all complaining that they're, they need it like five days early and stuff and you're

01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:23.140
like, yeah, you're not going to be selling it early or anything.

01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:26.980
I just, I hate games that are going to be just that popular.

01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:30.700
Grand Theft Auto 4, when it comes out, I'm going to hate that too.

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:34.700
Except I love Grand Theft Auto 4, but I am still going to hate the whole selling of Grand

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:36.740
Theft Auto 4.

01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:40.100
Dark Tetsuya in our chat room thinks that for the next couple weeks, well before we

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:45.580
transition in episode 250 to, you know, changing some things up, thinks that your website of

01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:51.060
the week should be like Google.com or Yahoo.com.

01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:59.460
Actually if you type in Goggle.com because I typoed it once, it takes you to porn.

01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:04.300
I used to use Hotbot as my search engine back in the day and you could, you know, totally

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:06.140
typo that to Hotbot.

01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:08.520
There's a website, speaking of Google, I read about.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:09.520
Here we go again, tangents.

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.820
Somebody said in chat I was the king of tangents.

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:12.820
Here we go.

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:16.860
I was listening to the real radio of all things, driving to work one morning and I heard somebody

01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:19.380
talking about Blackle.

01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:24.740
It's a black version of Google where it's just, it's black instead of white.

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.060
There's a goth one too.

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:31.860
But the, well the reason behind it is because they say that if more people used websites

01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:36.760
that had black backgrounds, then that will actually save on energy.

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:39.940
So it's this whole like, you know, hippie thing, you know.

01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:41.900
Stupid tree huggers need to go away.

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:47.020
Leave the internet alone and go hug a tree.

01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:49.620
Okay.

01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:54.760
Escapist says Halo 3 will end with Bob Newhart waking up in bed discovering the whole war

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:55.760
was a dream.

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:58.700
And JVMon's jumping up and down saying you win the internet.

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:01.020
That was a pretty great ending to our show.

01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:03.940
I have a, okay I actually have a website.

01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:16.020
And I have to blame, I have to blame, hold on a second let me get, I have to blame JVMon

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:18.060
for this one because it's awful.

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:20.300
It made my heart cry.

01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:25.140
This is my website of the week not to go to ever, ever.

01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:28.420
It's insulting and horrible and you don't want to go there ever.

01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:29.420
This is fun.

01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:30.420
The anti website of the week.

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:41.260
It's captain-jack.de slash 2008 slash cj.html, a new Captain Jack and it makes my heart

01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:42.260
hurt.

01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:43.260
Oh, I want to see a new Captain Jack.

01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:46.380
And his, his girl that's with him is vacant.

01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:48.420
Hey, I like the new Captain Jack.

01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:49.420
I can deal with this.

01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:53.420
Wait, like, oh, I thought, wait, hold on, I thought this was another Doctor Who thing.

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:54.540
No, this sucks.

01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:59.380
Like the Captain Jack, the go, let go, let go, let go, that Captain Jack, they replaced

01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:00.380
him?

01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:01.380
No way.

01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:02.380
I know.

01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:03.380
Unless it's, unless that's his son.

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:05.380
If it's his son, I forgive them.

01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:06.380
Give me a, no it's not.

01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:07.980
If it's not, I don't forgive them.

01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:08.980
How dare they?

01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:09.980
No, check this out.

01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:10.980
This is awful.

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:13.540
Let me turn up my volume.

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:15.620
Can you, wait, can you give me the website one more time because I'll play it on here

01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:16.620
so the listeners can hear.

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:28.060
It's captain-jack.de slash 2008 slash cj.html.

01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:34.180
Captain-jack.de slash 2008, this is great radio, slash cj.html.

01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:35.180
Yes.

01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:37.180
Okay, I think I got it.

01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:38.180
Hurts my heart.

01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:39.180
All right, here we go.

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:40.180
The site is loading.

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:47.460
All right, we welcome, we proudly present the one and only Captain Jack, screw you.

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:49.260
There will only be one Captain Jack.

01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:54.060
Oh, Lord, this sounds horrible already.

01:09:54.060 --> 01:10:13.500
This is bad, I've got to stop it, besides we don't want to play one.

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:15.380
Captain Jack, you are not.

01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:16.380
Wow.

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:22.300
Oh, JV Mon says his son came out as Captain Jack Jr.

01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:24.540
Interesting.

01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:26.620
Is that like James Bond Jr.?

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:27.620
Interesting.

01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:28.620
All right.

01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:31.880
I like how his glasses on the website, you can totally see the film crew.

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:32.880
Way to go, people.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:37.300
All right, and I'd like to cordially thank JV Mon for ruining tonight's program.

01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:38.300
Thank you, JV Mon.

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:39.980
Let's get back to some gaming news.

01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:42.380
Please try to save what little dignity we have left on the show.

01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:44.900
What dignity do we have?

01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:51.780
Anywho, so as I mentioned a little bit earlier, that there is going to be some pretty cool

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:59.100
stuff coming out for Xbox Live Arcade, including which is Omega 5, a shooter that's going to

01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:00.100
be coming out.

01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:02.900
It should be pretty sweet, actually.

01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:08.940
It's more of like a traditional, crazy, tons of bullets, all over the place shooter game,

01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:14.720
so hopefully it'll be as cool as I think it is.

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.460
Hopefully it's cool as you make it out to be.

01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:21.340
Well, unfortunately, the link that I had on here was the wrong story, so that's based

01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:22.340
off memory.

01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:23.340
My bad.

01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:26.380
Oh, we linked the wrong story in the show, though.

01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:27.380
My bad.

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:29.980
No, but anyways, it is going to be pretty cool.

01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:33.420
I think it's Mizuguchi anyways, if I remember correctly.

01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:37.060
Well, then I'll read the story that Loki got linked to instead.

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:42.300
It's about Sega, as shown what they're going to be showing off at Tokyo Game Show next

01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:43.300
week.

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:47.220
They got a whole lot of stuff they're showing off on the PlayStation 3, titles such as Sega

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:51.460
Rally, Valkyrie of the Battlefield, and a game based off the Golden Compass, which I

01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:53.820
imagine is based on the movie.

01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:58.780
Wii is showing off Night's Journey into Dreams, Ghost Squad, another version of the Golden

01:11:58.780 --> 01:11:59.780
Compass.

01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:04.980
Sega Rally on the Xbox 360, that's it, but remember this is a Tokyo Game Show, and unfortunately

01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:07.340
the Xbox 360 is not doing as well over there.

01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:12.500
I think that's all they had over on the 360 from Sega, other than Golden Compass, I'd

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:13.500
imagine.

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.340
They are showing an expansion for Phantasy Star Universe on the PlayStation 2, though,

01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:19.420
which makes me wonder, it must not be coming out on the 360, but did the game come out

01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:20.420
on the Xbox?

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:24.060
It is coming out over here, but I think the expansion will probably be a download, just

01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:25.060
like, you know.

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:26.260
Oh, maybe that's what it is.

01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:29.620
Okay, well they are showing Phantasy Star Universe Ambition of the Illuminous on PlayStation

01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:31.020
2, at least.

01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:35.820
I'm sure our resident PSU guy, Dark Knight, knows more about this.

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:39.660
Nintendo DS is getting some other games, though, lots of stuff showing on the DS.

01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:45.900
Sonic Rush Adventure, Bleach the Third Phantom, Picto Image DS, another version of the Golden

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:49.740
Compass, which, by the way, will also be on PSP, and a game that I like, this is called

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:57.900
Dream Cat Smile DS, rad, that PSU expansion pack also coming to the PC, rad.

01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:00.720
And Escapists in Chat says, no new Jet Set Radio yet?

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:01.720
My heart is breaking.

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:02.720
I agree.

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:03.720
I agree.

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:04.720
C-Man 2.

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:05.720
C-Man 2?

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:06.720
Yeah.

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:09.860
I don't know so much about that.

01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:10.860
You know what?

01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:14.100
I wouldn't mind having a C-Man 2, because I thought it was great that the whole thing

01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:18.660
was narrated by Leonard Nimoy.

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:23.060
So let me, if I can get this right, here, Dark Sakura, you're saying you want C-Man

01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:24.060
2.

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:30.780
I got a ferret thrown at me, thank god the webcam's off.

01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:32.460
Yeah, this is horrible radio.

01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:33.460
Ferret!

01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:34.460
No.

01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:35.460
When you read the story, I'll get back the ferret.

01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:38.260
EA could be it.

01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:39.260
Okay.

01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:45.460
Anyway, EA is finally entering the world of survival horror by giving us a game called

01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:47.420
Dead Space.

01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:50.820
You get zombies hidden in fun places.

01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:54.540
We won't say where they are, but they are somewhere.

01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:58.860
And it's like, supposed to be like some, I guess, zombie game set in outer space, from

01:13:58.860 --> 01:13:59.860
what I understand.

01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:01.900
It's like Event Horizon, I think they said.

01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:05.620
Oh, and you have tentacles in it, so that's okay.

01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:07.020
Yay, tentacles!

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:08.660
Kids love tentacles!

01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:10.480
Tentacle porn?

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.480
Had to be said, kids.

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:16.100
Hey, well, I was at Fry's last night and there was a copy of the live-action Love Blue Girls

01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:17.260
just sitting out.

01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:19.340
That is the worst movie I've ever seen.

01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:20.340
It is!

01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:21.340
That's the most awful, funny thing ever.

01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:24.380
Vacuum cleaner tubes do not make tentacles.

01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:29.020
I need to put that on top of my Netflix queue.

01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:31.740
Just download it like everybody else.

01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:35.020
Then I'm done.

01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:39.740
Alright, well, that's going to do it for this Part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but we'll be
