Tonight, September 2nd, 2007, Xbox Live gets a Labor Day sale, PlayStation gets a SingStar bundle, and an old PC gaming classic is now free.
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that video game podcast dedicated to gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.
We are independently made and produced out of lovely Sacramento, California.
Joining you guys as always, my name is Rob Roberts and not joining us tonight sadly, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
She's not here tonight, she's celebrating her anniversary with her man Dan.
But joining us as always, say hello to Loki.
Yes.
How you doing, Loki?
I'm fine.
You're fine?
That sounded a little bit forced.
I'm doing okay.
All right, you do?
Oh.
So now we've downgraded from fine to okay.
What gives?
I'm running low of soda in this cup here.
But luckily, I brought two backups.
How much soda do you bring to this program?
Two cans.
Two cans.
All right, also joining us tonight, say hello to Miklatov, who is filling in in the big blue chair tonight.
Hello.
How you doing, Miklatov?
I'm fine.
What are you playing there on your PSP?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, you missed that one, I'm sorry to say.
But Operator 11 has some funky rules and it's supposedly going to shut off after 40 minutes and so we won't be able to archive until Part B again.
But the good news is that Operator 11 saves an archive of the file for a long time.
So if you're listening to the podcast and you wondered to yourself, I wonder what this looks like being taped live, you can go over to Operator11.com and look for our feed on there and see it.
I want to see how fat all the hosts look on camera.
And then you can love us long time.
Yes, you can I just named my island in Katamari What is your island in Katamari?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So I'm playing me and my Katamari.
And how is it?
I hate the controls a lot.
It's really bad to control, but it's still funny, and that's what really counts in Katamari.
And what else have you been playing this week?
Metroid Prime 3, which is the coolest.
Yeah, and what do you like about Metroid Prime 3?
It's fun.
What a very descriptive answer you're giving us here.
Well, that was a terrible question.
Sorry, why do you think Metroid Prime 3 is so fun?
What is it about the game that appeals to you?
Well, I like the fact that the controls are really cool and I like the Metroid Prime series and I like the fact that, spoilers are coming up, I got to fight Ridley and it was really fun and I had to shoot him in his mouth and I was falling down this big shaft the whole time and it was really cool.
So you have to fight somebody while you're falling down?
Yes.
Is there a chance that you'll ever hit the ground?
Probably not.
I think you fall forever until you beat Ridley or Ridley kills you.
All right.
Also, is there anything else you're giving me?
I started playing Suikoden V again.
I've owned it since it came out, and I worked on it, but I never actually played it really.
Can you say what you did on the game?
Yeah, I've said before.
I don't remember.
I can't remember.
There's secrets you can say and things you can't say on air.
Okay.
and yeah, I'm just now starting to play it.
See, if I asked you if there was a Suikoden VI, could you talk about that?
I could not talk about that.
You can neither confirm nor deny those reports?
I cannot.
Alright, fine, fair enough.
Anything else?
No.
Alright, let's go over to Loki.
And while Loki talks about his gaming week, I'm going to go grab another cookie.
Do you want a peanut butter cookie, Loki?
Yes, I want a peanut butter cookie.
All right, I'm going to go get that.
Stupid cookies.
Loki, tell us about your gaming week.
My gaming week was a lot of Xbox 360 stuff.
I played a lot of demos, including some stuff I've already played before, like beautiful Katamari.
Ace Combat 6, I think I tried a little bit of Juice 2 and didn't like that still.
Then, of course, I played Bioshock, which is still awesome and continues to get even more awesome as I play it.
So definitely, ooh, cookie.
And let's see, other games I've played, Call of Duty 4.
I actually got to try a little bit of the multiplayer beta.
And I had no doubts going into it that the game's going to be awesome.
And it's just amazing.
It still plays like Call of Duty 2 and 3.
I do like how they've kind of updated the radar a little bit so you can actually kind of get a better idea where people are firing from.
So that was pretty cool.
And also the replays of when you get killed, they were pretty cool.
So that's neat.
And then other stuff.
I actually played more Settlers of Catan on Xbox Live Arcade.
And I thought about... Oh, I played Street Trace New York.
It's that hoverboard racing combat game or something.
That game's really weird.
Kind of reminds me of crossing Sonic Riders with that crappy...
Was it that bumper car game that came with Windows 98 or something?
I don't even remember what the hell that's called.
But something like that.
Not recommending that game, though.
It's quite boring.
But I tried the demo, and that was kind of fun.
Let's see.
Other stuff on PSP, I was playing a lot of We Love Katamari.
And I don't know why.
I absolutely hate the control in that game, but I'm stuck playing it and loving it.
The only thing I wish they would do is just port that to PlayStation 2.
Because I know they like doing those ports from PSP to PlayStation 2.
Just do that.
I mean, I'll spend the 20 bucks to actually buy the game.
So, I think that's what they need to do to make at least the controls a little bit better.
And other than that, I believe that was my gaming week.
Oh, Saints Row Multiplayer.
We finally, and I wish I had pictures because I haven't, you know...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Hopefully, they'll fix that with a sequel.
I don't know.
But hopefully, I'll get some actual pictures of the setup.
I'm still putting the 360s in clear cases, which, by the way, if I were to review the clear cases I bought, they absolutely suck, but they look pretty.
That was my gaming week.
That was a hell of a lot of gaming week.
There's a lot of comments going on in the chat room here at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
Again, our chat room location is chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
If you guys are in the Operator 11 chat, since we are doing the video tonight, I just want to get out there.
We do not read the Op 11 chat because it's on a laptop that's on the other side of the room and it's hard for us to read.
I forgot one.
You have to be in our regular chat room.
Yes.
I play Contra 4 for the DS.
How did you do that?
Our Konami rep brought in a DS with a dev thing in it.
That's kind of important.
That's a big one.
How is Contra 4?
It's awesome.
It's exactly like you would imagine a sequel to Contra 3 being.
I mean, it's true 2D side-scrolling action.
It's Contra.
It's awesome.
And not like that sort of awesome that was Neo-Contra and stuff like that.
But yeah, so that was pretty cool.
The other thing, I didn't play this game, but I dogged on it last week, Cruisin' for the Wii.
I actually saw the game in motion in a trailer, and it looked...
Not as bad, let me put it that way.
It looked very low poly count.
It almost looked like a DS game ported to the Wii, but it was running at 60 frames per second.
So while it may not have been too pretty to look at, it was really smooth and looked pretty fun.
So if it's cheap enough, I may try it.
I want to go back to Contra 4 for a minute because this is a game a lot of people are very excited about.
How does it use the vertical?
How does it use the two screens?
Is it just a very vertical game?
It's a very vertical game.
It's very tall.
If you'll see stuff falling down and you basically get to shoot at stuff, there's a grappling hook in it so you can grapple with stuff and crawl along bars and whatnot.
Does it use a touchscreen at all or did they just say fuck it?
Um, for the brief time that I had with the game, it did not use a touchscreen.
So you have no idea if they have the top-down modes like they had in the old Super Nintendo Contra?
I don't think they do, but it would be cool if they did.
Oh, okay.
Very cool.
Alright, well, um... Wait, wait, wait.
What?
Let's tell everybody what my new island name is.
Yes, on me and my Katamari, what did you name it?
I named it Pen Island.
Pen Island.
Think about that one for a minute.
Pen Island.
Pen Island.
P-E-N-I-S-L-A-N-D P-E-N-I-S-L-A-N-D
Did you get scared by BioShock?
I thought he was dead at first, you know, the first time they played through it, and then the second time I knew he was going to be there, so I turned around and just stood there for a second, and then he finally attacked me, but, you know, it was kind of freaky, you know, you turn around and all of a sudden, boom, there's someone there.
Piker Uno says, I got scared by the demo of Bioshock.
I did too a little bit, I have to admit.
I got a little bit scared from just the demo alone, because it's crazy.
The game gets so awesome, and I can't help but think Andrew Ryan, or can't imagine Andrew Ryan, the main guy who built this whole city, as Walt Disney.
It's like, I can replace Walt Disney in this, and just like...
I don't know.
You're going to make me not want to go back to Disneyland, and that makes me sad, because I love Disneyland.
It just reminds me, Andrew Ryan just reminds me of Walt Disney.
Or like a really weird version of Walt Disney.
Maybe they based it off him, who knows?
You know, I was hoping to get some emails from people who didn't like Bioshock, but I didn't see anything in the mailbag when I last checked.
So, I don't know.
We'll open up the email bag a little later and let you know if we heard from any people that didn't like Bioshock.
All right.
Anyhow, let's go ahead and go on to my gaming week.
I want to talk about my gaming week.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But this third game, I have to admit, the gimmicky controls are actually pretty awesome.
And done pretty well considering the limited amount of buttons that a Wii controller has.
It's pretty fun.
And I also like the fact that Metroid Prime 3 kind of breaks the mold of...
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
The scanning in Metroid Prime 3, it's not to tell you what's going on, it's to tell you now what you need to do to get through this room.
It's not like, oh, you know, there's lore stuff you can read, but... It's not mandatory.
It's not mandatory.
I did notice it was a little easier to get into story-wise than 1 or 2 was, because you could go up and you could talk to people, and it kind of made the story a little better for me.
It wasn't just scanning things and reading things.
also I will point out though scanning things appears to be the way that you get most of the tokens in the game I know there hasn't been a lot of talk about the tokens which a couple weeks ago was labeled by a lot of the big game blogs as like Metroid Prime's achievement system but it's not really achievements the tokens that you unlock
Thanks for watching!
Also, it uses WeConnect24 because for every 100 enemies you kill, you get a green token, and you can send the green tokens to other people, and they can use them.
Or I guess, no, it's a black token when you send it to someone else's green, or something like that.
But you have to use friend codes to make that work.
And then you said, Shane, you are pretty sure you got an actual achievement in the game or something.
Oh, yeah.
I was using my ice missile.
Hey, while I'm talking, smell this alcohol.
I'll talk about the alcohol in a minute, folks.
I was using the ice missile on just enemies randomly.
I want to drink it first.
Not yet.
No, I'm going to drink it first.
Okay.
and like I used the ice missile on some lizard thing and once I did that like a little one of the little cards you get for every hundred kills and I guess for certain random tasks you do came up and was like chilled lizard or something like that like you know a terrible achievement name and it was cool and that's I like that it's achievements and you know what you can do with that nothing absolutely nothing just like the Xbox 360 achievements
So, anyway.
By the way, the liquor talk is because it is a three-day weekend, so some of us have chosen to do a little drinking tonight.
Which leads me to the responsibility spiel.
Of course, we are all over 21, and Matt's not drinking tonight because he didn't find a designated driver.
I could have, but I figured that... Loser?
He's not into it tonight.
You said you were sick and were possibly not going to be drinking, so that's why I didn't want to be the only one.
Yes, I have been sick, but I figure it's only Tylenol that I'm taking, so I should be okay, right?
Well...
Yeah, unless you die, in which case then we would have been terribly wrong.
All right.
Well, anyhow, what else?
But Shane's here and Shane's drinking, although he doesn't like his blue drink, even though he likes the smell of it.
I like it.
I like the smell.
It's just like drinking an alcoholic blueberry muffin to me.
It's really weird.
You want to try this one, this pomegranate thingy?
I haven't drank from it yet.
I was going to say, we are all over 21 and we drink responsibly, blah, blah, blah, and kids shouldn't drink, blah, blah, blah, and so on.
So, yeah.
Is that any good?
I don't know if it's the combination of the two, but that tastes like that gamer fuel Mountain Dew to me.
Really?
This is Pomegranate Fusion Smirnoff.
We're taking it easy tonight, so we'll see.
Blue Dragon
is a good game.
Is it a great game?
No.
Is it a 10?
No.
Is it going to leave a lot of people disappointed because they were expecting... Boo, Dragon.
Hold on, you can have your opinion in a minute.
Is it going to leave a lot of people disappointed because you hear these big names attached to it and you were expecting greatness or like a Final Fantasy XIII or something?
Yes, it's going to leave a lot of people disappointed.
But it's not a bad game by any means and certainly it's the type of game that the Xbox 360 is severely lacking.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thank you for watching!
Otherwise, those little bitches aside, I mean, it is a good game.
It's certainly, if you're a fan of role-playing games and you have a 360, it's worth your time to check out because importantly it comes down to, you know, how is the game?
And the game is fine.
And the music's really good and all that stuff.
I'm sorry, but that gameplay is boring and it has led me to call it Boo Dragon.
I'm noticing DJ Dysentery in chat says, because you want to hear their screams, sounds like Shane's reason for shaking babies, referring to an earlier episode of the program.
or, you know, just in general.
Now, why did you not like Blue Dragon?
You're someone that liked old RPGs, right?
But we've come so far and then to be thrown this battle system that's absolutely boring.
It's just like...
I don't know, it doesn't sit right with me.
And the pacing seems slow.
And granted, this is all, the only thing I've played is the demo that was on Xbox Live.
See, now, I don't think that, I think the demo, now that I've played the actual game, the demo fucking sucks.
The demo is not a good representation of the game, I think.
I just, it looks overly generic and not interesting.
And yeah, that Maru Maru guy is like,
Blue Drag On Boo Drag On
I'm just going to stick with Blue Dragon.
DarkTetsuya says, does Blue Dragon have the original voice?
Is this an option?
Yes, it does.
You can choose the English language, a Japanese language, all with English subtitles, or you can have French language.
So if you want all your characters to speak French, you can have that as well, which I'm sure is interesting.
That might make the game a little better, playing it in French.
You think?
Yes.
But I think that one guy's voice is still going to be very annoying.
But it would be...
That's literally what he sounds like.
It would be French annoying, which might be cool.
Sounds like Teen Girl Squad.
Escapist in chatroom says, well, now to wait for Eternal Sonata and Lost Odyssey.
Yeah, Eternal Sonata is going to be awesome, but this will hold me over.
That was the best thing about Blue Dragon is inside the case was a card pimping out Eternal Sonata because that's a good game.
Good demos, bad games.
Did Perfect Dark have a good demo?
I don't know.
Perfect Dark Zero, sorry.
Not to be confused with the original Perfect Dark, sorry.
Cameo, maybe?
I've never played that.
Escapist says Final Fantasy XII.
I freaking love Final Fantasy XII.
What are you talking about?
Move that person from the chatroom, because they're idiots.
Fireboma says Devil Dice.
I don't even know what that is.
Piker Uno says Cameo rules.
Shut the fuck up.
It's okay.
I wouldn't say it rules, but it's okay.
It rules.
It's sucking.
Alright, uh...
Let's get into tonight's gaming news since we've talked about our gaming week for far too long.
I was going to get into some housekeeping.
Pretty much the only thing I had to tell you guys was that we are doing a little bit of drinking tonight.
So if we sound a little off, that's why it's a three-day weekend.
Why not?
I'm just going to be off, period.
And that we are up on Operator 11 if you want to check us out there or the archive should be up there.
I don't know about this video quality though.
It looks like it's running really slow.
We'll see though.
I'm just moving really slow.
As long as it doesn't kill the screen.
But we're not going to play to the camera because we don't want to be a TV show.
We're still Orange Lounge Radio.
But to answer the calls of our live listeners who wanted us to get a webcam, we finally did.
So there you have it.
Wow.
Enjoy.
That's really... I know.
That's really awesome.
Figure.
All right.
Anyhow.
Wow.
FootyMonster agrees with Final Fantasy XII.
I second Final Fantasy XII.
Demo was great.
Game sucked.
You guys are mean.
How about Final Fantasy VIII?
Game was awesome.
Yes, how about Final Fantasy VIII?
I love Final Fantasy VIII.
Excellent example.
That is such a good game.
Great demo, horrible game.
I don't even remember the demo.
Ruined by a battle system.
Where was the demo?
The demo was with... What did they put the Final Fantasy in?
Vagrant Story.
Was it really?
Yeah.
They put the Final Fantasy VIII demo with some other Square game.
I remember that.
Alright, let's get into the gaming news.
I don't have any housekeeping otherwise.
Visit our website, orangelaunchradio.com.
Leave us five-star reviews on iTunes, pretty please, or elsewhere around the web.
Tell two people you know about our program and so on and so on.
Live journal, MySpace, add us there.
Blah, blah, blah.
Gaming news.
Who's starting us off tonight?
You, Loki, or me?
You are.
I am?
Oh, crap.
Oh, because I have a follow-up.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
for the big day after Thanksgiving holiday.
And, of course, a lot of people definitely looking forward to this game.
They call it an RPG.
It's like sci-fi.
It looks to have a little bit of first-person shooter elements in it, though.
I don't want to call it a first-person shooter, but some elements.
It's like, I would say, it's like what Phantasy Star Online should have been.
Sort of.
Except it's offline.
Well, we'll see.
Wait, wait, Fantasy Star Online or Fantasy Star Universe?
Either.
Fantasy Star Online was a great game.
Universe was a piece of crap.
I liked Universe's single player story and the fact that it was online was just a bonus.
It was a little bit repetitive.
I'll give you that, it was a little bit repetitive.
You didn't like online?
It was okay.
All you do is run around and hit things.
It was fun to play with voice chat.
It was fun to play with other people.
It was a chat room with swords.
That's what it was.
It was a chat room with swords.
Whatever.
At least they didn't move as funky as they did in the old Phantasy Star Online.
At least there's that much.
Anyways, something less exciting now.
Apparently there's some pictures that leaked out on Flickr of a new Xbox Live arcade game featuring the Toyota Yaris.
Yes, those wonderful commercials featuring the car doing stupid things yet not really talking about the car.
Um,
Great, it's going to be an adver game.
I don't know, this was at, I think, some Toyota event.
I hope we don't pay for this, because I sure as hell am not going to pay for this.
Now, is this a racing game, or what the hell would you do?
It looks like a racing game.
Is there screenshots?
Well, there's screenshots of...
A shot of people playing the game, but it doesn't really show much.
It was at the Evolution FGC EVO West 2007 event.
Yeah, I don't know.
It doesn't really show me much, and I could care less that this game's coming out.
Hey, you know what though?
If it's free, it's free.
If it's free and it's a decent racing game, I'm all about that.
No, here it is for you.
If it's free and you can get achievement points from it, you'll totally play it until you unlock everything.
Yeah, shut up.
You know what should be an unlockable feature in a Toyota racing game though?
To be able to race Priuses.
That would be awesome.
Don't you think?
Like Al Gore's Sun Mode?
Wouldn't that be fun?
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Yes, like Joust from 1983 or whenever that game came out.
Remember when you had the little lance and you tried to stab the pterodactyl in the mouth and you hit the button to flap around?
It's actually a pretty fun game to play two-player.
And it's on Xbox Live.
That's right, they are going to make Joust the movie.
It's being made by producers Christine Peters and Michael Cerenzi.
They have worked on such notable films as Blackout and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.
So...
Interesting.
Here's a quote from Sirinzi.
Joust is an arcade game that's as old as Pac-Man and has global awareness.
We took one element of the game and the brand itself and built a whole new world around it for the film.
So you can guess what that element's going to be.
I hope it's the element of the hands coming up from the lava to pull people in the lava because that was always cool.
And maybe they'll pull these producers in and make them not make this movie because it's probably going to be bad.
I could see one of those, I don't know, just like a pseudo-futuristic jousting movie.
It's going to be boring is what it is.
I mean, how to lose a guy in 10 days?
Fortunately, I got dragged to that, and that was a horrible movie, so I don't know.
It's such a dumb idea.
Let's see.
Going to our chat room, chat.orange.radio.com.
Tiger Claw says, a movie about people riding on giant ostriches.
Dark Tetsuya says, ostriches don't fly.
And Dark Knight says, fail in its future.
There you go.
Escapist says, Kate Hudson and her ostrich bicker for half the movie than fall in love.
Now that I'd pay to see.
Anyways, there's an interesting rumor going on regarding Guitar Hero 3.
Apparently, another artist is in talks with Activision and Red Octane regarding being in Guitar Hero 3 as one of the Legends of Rock artists.
to join up with the other people in there.
That person is Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine.
Of course, obviously going to be dueling against him.
I think right now it's still, they're in talks, but hasn't fully committed yet.
But that's kind of neat.
They're getting down the line here, so if they're going to put him in there, it's going to have to be pretty soon.
Yeah, isn't that game coming out like next month or something?
Yeah, like around Halloween.
Seriously.
Are they just maybe holding on to some secrets?
Well, I mean, I can't imagine that there's too much development going into that game.
I mean, you don't really have to change that much other than putting songs in there and creating the player models for these people that they're getting in there.
All right.
Well, coming soon to the Xbox Live Video Marketplace, Family Guy.
That's right.
Coming on September 2nd.
Today?
Is that today or tomorrow?
That's today.
That's today.
Well, holy crap.
It's coming out today on Xbox Live Marketplace.
That's freaking sweet.
Stewie Griffin, The Untold Story, and I believe episodes from, I don't know if it's, is it every episode that's coming up on Xbox Live?
I think it is.
Let me just save you some time.
Do not download Stewie Griffin, The Untold Story, whatever that is.
Isn't that bad?
It is horrible.
It's just three episodes strung together, and it feels like three episodes.
It was not good.
But, um.
I like that they decided to put this on the marketplace at the height of its popularity.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
So you're still watching the old episodes?
I'm watching, well, their older episodes.
It's basically when I don't get to catch the new episodes when they come out on Fox.
They play them a few weeks later on Cartoon Network.
And I think if you watch Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, your standards for entertainment are a lot lower than most people.
Because, god damn, I don't know how some of those shows survive on their late-night stoners watching that.
Tom Goes to the Mayor?
No, there's stuff that's a lot weirder than that now.
I remember when that was scraping at the bottom of the barrel.
Now it's
A lot worse.
They actually have some, what, there's like some, like, perfect hair, or like, woman with perfect hair, and it's like some weird perverted guy, and some anime chick, or some, I don't know.
Anyways, um, so, speaking of, uh, weird Japanese stuff, there's that Dreamcast shoot-em-up game that was, um, coming out, I guess, next year.
It's also coming out on Xbox Live Arcade in Japan, and so, um,
Pretty interesting.
I guess it's one of the games called Trigger Heart Alexia.
It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
I guess it's the team behind a Sega Saturn shooter game called Shinru.
I probably butchered that.
That's pretty awesome.
I will definitely be using my Japanese account to buy that game.
If you buy a game on the Japanese Xbox Live accounts, can you play it on the American accounts?
Does it work that way?
Maybe.
What you can do is you can download the demo on the Japanese account, and then you register it on the U.S.
account.
Because, you know, if you download a game and you purchase it on another account, it's a demo on the other accounts.
So what you can do is just register it on... I downloaded it on the Japanese account, downloaded the demo, and then registered it on the U.S.
one.
That should work.
Interesting.
I think.
All right.
Also coming to Xbox Live Arcade very soon.
It's in this next week.
Fatal Fury Special finally makes its way to Xbox Live Arcade, which I'm actually pretty excited about because Fatal Fury Special is a game I actually really enjoyed back in the day.
So I'm excited to see this game finally make its way to Xbox Live.
Cyberball 2072.
This was not a game I'm so fond of, but I bet there's a lot of people out there that are into this game.
It's that futuristic football game that Atari put out many years ago.
I think it runs on the same hardware as games like 720, and those games did.
So that game is coming out to Xbox Live Marketplace.
What should be also noted, though, is that there's a Labor Day sale going on on Xbox Live Marketplace right now, and you can get certain games for half price.
Small Arms and Zuma are 400 Microsoft points apiece this weekend, and Gauntlet and Dig Dug are 200 points a pop.
Dig Dug is a classic, though.
I don't know.
I guess it depends how strongly you feel about retro titles.
Yeah.
Anyways, there are some pictures that leaked out, or I wouldn't really say leaked out, went out on the internet, showing that, yes, the elites can also crap out as well and get the wonderful three rings of death.
Although, I'm not too surprised, though, seeing that they're showing, I guess, a kiosk.
Now, I'm not sure what kind of ventilation those kiosks have, but just looking at it, I mean, it doesn't look like there's much airflow in that at all.
And depending on what they're running, no wonder that thing overheated, so...
I don't know.
Xbox 360s die, they'll get replaced.
Live.
I guess as long as they give the three-year warranty with those, right?
Oh yeah, they still do the warranties on all of them.
So, I mean, apparently they're stepping up things to make sure that their turnaround time's a lot less, but...
And aren't they like giving away free Xbox Live or something with that too?
They are.
They're giving away when you actually return the system, you'll get a free card for one month of Xbox Live.
Valued at probably like five bucks.
Now, is that something that you can extend your current Xbox Live account with?
I'm not sure if you can extend your current one.
I would imagine you would because it's just those redeemable cards, the gold subscriptions.
So...
I'm not sure.
Awesome.
One thing I'm looking forward to playing on the 360 at some point is Tekken 6.
Hopefully it's coming to the 360.
They said, yep.
I seem to remember they announced it's coming to both systems.
I don't know if it's coming to the 360 yet.
No.
Because I think that the arcade game is actually running off of PlayStation 3 hardware.
We'll see.
Well, anyway, Tekken 6 is still on its way.
I probably have a PS3 by then anyway.
Dark Tatooine says, are you sure you're not thinking of Virtua Fighter 5?
Maybe I am.
Yeah, Virtua Fighter 5 is coming out in October.
Well, Tekken 6 is on its way and there's a brand new fighter that's been announced for Tekken 6 and that's Bob.
Yes, he has the very unique name of Bob.
But the cool thing about Bob, he's a chubby.
He's a chubster, and you don't see a lot of fat guys in video games, especially in fighting games.
Doesn't he sort of resemble Mario with bleached hair?
Kinda.
Here's a picture of him right here.
He does kind of look like Mario with bleached hair.
He's got the blue jeans and the red shirt and suspenders, and then bleached hair.
But, you know, the only fat guys I can think of in video game history would be like, you know, Raiden from, I think he was in one of the Neo Geo fighting games.
I think he was in the first Fatal Fury, I think.
And there was, what other big fat guys were there?
E-Honda E-Honda, but he wasn't fat, he was He was just a sumo wrestler Yeah There you go Karnov is what Drew Nami says in chats, there you go Yes, I guess he's a stereotypical American, according to Nintendo Maniac 64 According to Japanese Arcadia Magazine, who actually kind of broke the news on this Bob used to be into conventional beauty, but he got frustrated by how his size limited him, so he got super fat You go, boy
Awesome.
Now what else is pretty neat?
That Tekken 5 Online is now online.
And yes, it's kind of funny, but you can now download, and not for free, but for $10, you can download and get survival mode, and then I guess a practice mode, and of course the online mode.
So, yay!
They've
Broke it and then make you pay $10 to fix it.
Hooray.
Do you have Tekken on the PlayStation Network?
Fuck no.
Because you know I don't even have a PlayStation 2.
I'm not spending like $15 for a crippled game.
I'm not really a Tekken fan.
I mean, I don't play fighting games that much.
Much less do I play PlayStation 3 games much.
Alright, well, one thing we like to do is we like to open up ye olde mailbag once in a while and read some of our favorite emails.
Sadly, DarkSakura's not here tonight, so she's not here to read the emails for us.
But I'm here, dammit.
I'll read the emails.
Again, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangelongerator.com is the place to do it.
Our first email tonight comes from AZHP.
and AZHP says, Hey, OLR, random thought from last week's show that I forgot to say on the Skype line.
Saw the live feed for about five seconds before Live 365 got cut off and you killed the operator.
11 feed.
Rob is hot.
Call me later.
Well, thank you.
That's awkward.
Yeah, a little bit.
P.S.
Just kidding.
Keep up the great podcasting.
Less awkward.
Funny.
Let's go to another email.
This email comes to us from Ali.
It could be Ali, actually.
I think it's Ali.
In episode 244, part A, you got an email from someone who said your show is calming.
And Rob exclaimed, I don't understand.
How is this show calming?
This show makes me want to do vehicular manslaughter to my cousins.
I second that calming effect.
I've been doing the endurance races in Forza while listening to podcasts.
And I must say, it is when I listen to yours that I don't want to kill my Xbox.
It cheats.
Now I need to say F you to my local EB Games.
It is situated in a local burg separated from the city, in which it is illegal to trade video games if you are under 18, and you must have photo ID to trade video games.
In other words, when I went to take my stack of old Xbox games that have no replay value in to get Forza, I had to go back home, drag my mom to EB, and make her show them her driver's license so I could buy the E-rated Forza Motorsport 2, WTF.
I would have called in to deliver that rant, but I'm never home when you guys tape.
Also, am I the only one who finds the mouse acceleration in Bioshock unbelievably frustrating?
I love how in Battlefield 1942, Half-Life 2, and Counter-Strike, the mouse response is snappy and rigid, but Bioshock has some weird acceleration built into it.
Or is it because I'm playing in Vista?
Oh, by the way, I'm playing Bioshock on my dual-booting MacBook Pro.
Suck it, Loki.
Love the show, except the Mac hating, Ollie.
There you go.
Another fan mail for Loki.
Well, maybe it's because he's doing that whole doobling thing that his mouse is so screwed up.
No, I have no idea.
I have not been able to play.
Bioshock won't even run on my archaic PC, so I couldn't tell you.
But I'm curious, chat room, maybe is there somebody in chat that's playing Bioshock on the PC that would care to enlighten us?
Does the mouse feel weird to you guys?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yep.
It's those damn kids.
As they probably should.
Hey, they make laws for reasons.
So, you know, obviously they've had reason to make such a law because, you know, they were getting too much theft or people turn in stuff.
I could understand needing a photo ID.
I don't understand the 18 thing, but... I think all of them require photo IDs.
Yeah, they do now.
So, I mean, 16 and up, I could see that.
All right.
Well, let's go to the next email.
Goldbanjo14 in our chatroom says, That law is bullshit.
Let's go to the next email in our mailbag.
Mailbag at OrangeSoundsRadio.com.
This one's not signed, so I will attribute it to Nick C. And it's titled, I agree with Loki.
Hi, my name, Nick, and I have been listening since I got a PSP when it first came and found the OLR PSP website.
I'm reading this as is, you guys.
Wow, this is a terrible email.
I listen live once and a while and download the podcast all the time.
I'm thinking he typed it on his PSP, so I'm giving him a break.
Listening to your podcast helped me out when buying a DDR game for my sister.
I agree with Loki on Apple.
I hat every product made by Apple.
People always get made when I bash on Apple all the time, saying that Apple is good with their crappy iPods and Macs that are overpriced.
So what do you think he meant by hat?
Was it hate?
Yeah, it's hate.
I think it's Hath.
No, it says, I hate every product made by Apple.
People always get mad, but I read it as is.
People always get mad when I bash on Apple all the time, saying that Apple is good with their crappy iPods and Macs that are overpriced, and I hope they unlock the iPhone so I can make fun of more people that bought an iPod that makes calls.
So there you go, Loki.
At least you have the bad grammar kids agreeing with you.
Okay, you know, still though, you've got to admit, I mean...
$600 for a phone?
Come on!
I mean, if it were a Microsoft phone, I would still be giving people crap for it.
I'm like, why the fuck are you spending $600 on a phone?
That's what I want to know.
Here's my thing.
I'll tell you straight up right now.
You know I love Macs and all that stuff, so I'm not going to hate on it or whatever, but here's the thing is that I did notice when I was at the airport this week, because I did spend a lot of my week in LA this week, is that
There are tons of assholes out there with iPhones that don't even know how to use them.
Like, it's becoming this trendy thing amongst businessmen and businesswomen to use.
And there's a lot of assholes out there with iPhones, so go figure.
Alright.
Because it's expensive and excessive, just like SUVs.
Hey, if you're an Apple fanboy, fangirl, and you bought one because you want to support the great Apple in the sky, then go for it.
It's all good.
No hate.
No hate from here.
We'll do one more here.
This is from Nate.
I am but a poor commoner and don't have any of the next gen systems, so I have to make do with the pre-DS and Wii Nintendo systems.
As such, a lot of the hot news regarding Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, etc.
I just don't have much interest in, although it is nice to keep up with what's happening in the industry just for the sake of staying well informed.
Wow, that person obviously doesn't listen to the show whatsoever.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I've already said this twice in chat, but honestly, this is important in my opinion.
In the final area in Super Metroid, below the four boss statues, make sure you only save in the first save room.
If you save in the second one, you've already gone past a certain point where there's a room where its door is gray and deactivated, resulting in you being trapped except for being able to complete the game.
This would prevent you from going back and collecting any power-ups you may have missed.
Note, I learned this the hard way.
I even had all the reserve tanks and energy tanks.
So, boy, you got screwed, didn't you?
Sorry, buddy.
Sorry to hear it.
All right, that's it for email.
Again, if you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelaundrater.com is the place to do it.
Yes.
Neo Geo titles are confirmed to be coming to the Virtual Console as soon as this month.
In fact, September 11th, you'll be getting a few games, including Fatal Fury, Magical Lord, and World of Heroes.
Those are each going to cost a whopping 900 Wii Points.
No word on whether they're coming to the US.
I imagine at some point they will.
Magical Lord is fucking awesome.
I'm glad to see that's in the initial allotment there.
Because I remember playing that a lot.
For some reason, these grocery chains around here had Neo Geo machines a while back.
So while my parents were checking out, I would be playing Magical Lord.
I would think it's inevitable that the game's going to come at some point.
XBOX 360 Fatal Inertia
If you want to check that game out.
Going over to some other systems.
On the Nintendo Wii, there's this game called Shinchuka Taisen.
Michael to Meme no Boken, which is coming out from Starfish.
And this looks to be a game, I'm trying to look at some of the screenshots.
Looks like a little bit of a side-scroller action-y type game, like a throwback to an old, you know, like Mario type game.
That's kind of cool.
I wonder if they'll bring that stateside.
Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii, nothing this week, but we can go over to the PlayStation 3 and I can tell you that there is another Pachinko game coming out.
Isn't there always?
There's always something coming out.
PlayStation 2 Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories Dear My Son EA Sports Rugby 08 Will-O-Wisp PlayStation 2 Theta
and also a game from Bandai called... Well, let's just call it Mahjong, because that's what it is.
It's a Mahjong game.
It's with a really complicated title.
Mahjong, the game!
Another Mahjong game on the PS.
The only Mahjong game you need.
Let's just leave it at that.
Really quickly, seeing if there's anything on the PSP worth mentioning.
Sony's putting out a game called Rezel Cross.
That might be kind of interesting.
It's an RPG.
It's from Sony themselves.
and it's from, the script is written by the folks who did Ark of the Lad 3 and 4.
So if you like Ark of the Lad, you might like this game.
There you have it, Japan releases.
Nice.
In the US, on PlayStation 2, I hope you like Naruto, because Naruto Uzumaki Chronicles 2 is the only PS2 game coming out this week.
On other systems though, let's see, 360, we've got Medal of Honor Airborne, that's also coming out on PC.
Stranglehold is also coming out on Xbox 360, both the standard and collector's edition.
On PSP and DS, Worms Open Warfare 2, because the Worms games are awesome.
And let's see here, on PlayStation 3, you get a big fat nothing.
And then, of course, on the Wii, Pool Party.
And no, that's not with water, that is billiards.
And let's see, also on the DS, Garfield Nightmares, which I'm sure is awesome.
And PC games, two games that I have to love, I guess.
I Love Kittens and I Love Puppies.
Hooray!
I Love Kittens!
That sounds like fun.
Let's see, other fun games.
Is there a tycoon game this week?
Because...
I'm going to be very disappointed if there is not.
And... No.
No Tycoon game.
Sorry to hear it.
Well, going over to European release dates, since DarkSakura is not here, I still got a lot of love for you, Europe.
I'm going to go and look at your release dates real quick.
On the 7th, all these games on the 7th, Blazing Angels coming out on Xbox 360 and the PC.
This will be the Secret Missions from Ubisoft.
Crazy Taxi Fair Wars on the PSP.
Two Worlds makes its way to the PC and the Xbox 360.
And Valkyrie Profile 2 Slumera is coming out on the PlayStation 2.
God, that game came out over here like a year ago, didn't it?
Just about.
God, it's about time you guys got it.
Sorry to hear it, folks.
All right, well, that's it for release dates.
Not that I think it's a real big disappointment that they haven't gotten it yet.
Well, there's some Valkyrie Profile fans out there, I'm sure.
Sad.
Anyways, there's an interesting game coming out in Japan, of course, because, God forbid, you know, that something like this come out over here.
It's created by the team...
Sega's Field of Magic team, and it uses voice recognition technology to decipher how people really feel.
It's called CorocoScan, and apparently they have a hilarious clip on YouTube.
That's talking, they're interviewing, I guess, a girl and her boyfriend.
And they were asking, I guess, how he feels about living together and marriage and stuff like that.
And I guess it came up that he was cheating on her or something.
Wow.
Yes.
I want to play with that game.
That'd be fun.
Any chances it might come out over here?
Nope, but hey, thank goodness that...
Those games are region-free, so awesome.
Oh, that's right.
Except you have to be able to read Japanese to actually play them, so what the hell.
Eh, it doesn't matter.
All right.
Well, this might be a little more mainstream, and this is coming out on the Nintendo DS, I don't know when.
I'm assuming sometime within the next year or so.
The Legend of Kage Part 2.
Some folks, if you don't know how to pronounce things right, might call this The Legend of Cage Part 2.
Because this came out years ago on the NES.
But The Legend of Kage is coming out on the DS, a new sequel to it.
And this was something that was spotted in Famitsu Magazine with some screenshots and everything.
So pretty cool.
If you like The Legend of Kage.
I know that's an S game that a lot of people liked.
I think it's on Virtual Console now, right?
I think so.
Possibly.
I thought I saw that it was coming back to Virtual Console.
So there you go.
Well, if you are looking for a game that's not so mainstream and definitely a lot cheaper, you may be interested in Rose Camellia DS.
Now, if you're not familiar of Rose and Camellia, it's a women's slapping game that's a flash game right now, but it is being ported over to the DS via the homebrew community.
And, uh, actually, it's funny, the guy that's doing it happens to be French, and, um,
Needs help finishing the game, but still though, if you want to check it out, you can definitely check out the free Flash game site, and it is beyondds.free.fr.
For the record, that game is fucking rad.
The slapping game, I love that game.
The slapping game, yeah.
I love the slapping game.
Have you ever played the slapping game, the flash game, Shane?
I know you've been checked out of the show.
I think I tried to play it at work once and it wouldn't work right.
I'm sorry to hear it.
It's a fun game.
It sounds funny because you slap women.
But you're a woman slapping the women, so it's okay.
It doesn't matter.
As long as a woman is getting slapped, all is right in the world.
Wow, you can send those cards and letters too.
What's your email, Miklatov?
Anyhow.
Also announced for a Nintendo platform, not quite as...
Huh, but it's pretty cool nonetheless.
Coming to the Wii, Worms, A Space Odyssey.
It's another game in the Word series, and of course it will be taking advantage of the Wii's motion control system, but what's really cool about this, online worldwide play, which is not something you've been seeing a whole lot in Nintendo releases lately, so that is certainly very promising.
This was announced by an official press release from THQ Inc.
this week.
Buyin' it!
You're that big a fan of Worms, huh?
I love me some Worms.
Just an FYI, there is still the Worms Open Warfare 2 being made for the DS and PSP.
Wow, they must still really have a fanbase for these games, because they crank them out left and right.
Are you buying all of these games, Loki?
No.
Will I be playing them?
Maybe.
I bought the very first one that came out on the PC years ago, and that's the last one I bought.
I think the last game I bought was for the PC.
It was Worms Armageddon.
They do have one of the Worms games on GameTap, so that's one of the ones I've played too.
I've been meaning to buy the one on Xbox Live Arcade, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.
One game I'm definitely going to be around to buying is Manhunt 2.
Of course, people are still pissed off that the game got re-rated down to an M.
They want to know why they're demanding answers, and guess what?
The ESRB says, uh-uh, we ain't giving you no fucking answers.
So here's their statement, basically.
The FTC, the National PTA, the Kaiser Family Foundation, and the Peter Hart Research Team have all found that parents are overwhelmingly satisfied with the ESRB rating system, rather than publicly saying
What is unmistakably a strong warning to parents about the suitability of particular games for children, which presumably neither Senator Yee or the CCFC have personally reviewed.
We feel that a more productive tact would be joining us in encouraging parents to take their ratings seriously when buying games for their children.
You show them.
So in other words, yeah, they re-rate it.
What?
What did they change to re-rate it?
Well, fuck off.
You don't get to find out.
Actually, they can find out if they buy certain versions of the game in other countries and check it.
Or maybe they didn't change much at all.
Maybe they appealed or something.
It's freaking... Okay, 17 and 18 year olds, come on.
We've discussed this before.
There's not much maturity difference between a 17 and 18 year old, okay?
Thanks for watching!
I'm more impressed that they did it this quick.
I mean, we all thought the game was just not going to come out for like a year now because of this, and it seems like not even a month later, it's all fixed.
So it makes me think whatever they changed wasn't that much.
It wasn't that much.
It was probably stupid things.
Remember when we talked about Laird last week and how they had to change stuff to get a teen rating?
They couldn't show blood, but they could show people being burned alive.
I mean, like, there's a big difference there or something.
So, it's just, it's really stupid, the requirements that they have.
It's just like the, you know, MPA, it's all fucked up.
But, I don't know.
I like how these people, though, that haven't played the game at all can criticize, you know, the rating system or anything like that.
They have no clue on what's going on, yet they're just like, oh, we want the game banned, it's horrible.
They're going to be selling it to children, you know, despite the fact that it's,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's like they act like their parents are powerless.
It's like, oh no, he's got it in his hands now.
I can't take it away from him.
We're doomed.
Lots of comments from chat here.
Fireboma says, won't somebody think of the children?
Let's see.
Escapist says, maybe they just had to excise some extreme cutscenes to Manhunt 2 down to an M. Son of Dad speculates Manhunt wasn't changed.
It was a publicity stunt.
Interesting.
GS191 says, I'm 19.
I don't feel any more different than when I was 17.
Sure, I learned a lot of things, but these people forget that there's a lot of kids that know the difference between real and fake.
Yeah, but isn't it fair to say, unfortunately, there's some that don't, and there's even some, like, 20-year-olds that don't.
Shouldn't you be more worried about your kids going and having underage sex and doing drugs and, you know, all sorts of things like that rather than playing violent video games?
I would think that you would be more encouraging of, you know, kids playing games that require them not to leave the house to do malicious things.
I don't know about you, but, you know, I think given the two choices, I'll take my kids playing violent video games.
Fireboma in chat has a funny comment, says, My precious unique snowflake would never do drugs.
Or play these violent video games, I'm sure.
I mean, seriously, how dumb are people?
Really?
Who doesn't enjoy a little bit of violence once in a while?
Do you like violence, Shane?
Yes.
You do?
Okay, that's good.
No, only sometimes.
Only sometimes?
What types of violence do you like?
The stuff that doesn't look too real.
I can't stand the real stuff.
Okay.
All right.
and Violence Against Women.
Again, those cards and letters.
You want to hear a funny story?
Sure, why not?
This refers to last week when we were talking about Imagine Babies.
I actually talked to the company that's making Imagine Babies.
I think Ubisoft's putting it out.
And I mentioned to them about the baby shaking.
They did not know that.
They didn't?
I'm like, you can rock the baby with one part.
And if you shake it really fast, you're actually shaking babies.
Yeah.
I don't want them to change that.
They're not going to change that.
Good job, Loki, ruining Imagine Babies.
I know.
Good job, ass.
Wow, this show has gone to all sorts of places.
I didn't think it would go tonight.
It's because Jamie's not here to keep us in check and make pouty faces.
And flip me off.
DarkSakura.com
but Electronic Arts was contacted a little later in the week and EA has reaffirmed that yes, they are going to E for All so if you want a chance to play Rock Band early you still have a chance because obviously if EA is going they're bringing that game with them because they've trucked it everywhere the past couple months
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Shane, I might have to drag you with me if you can go.
I don't know, depending on what's going on.
All right.
Well, anything else in this Part A?
We're kind of running a short show tonight.
I don't know what's up with that.
Well, that's just Part A. That's just Part A. That's right.
There's plenty more to come.
Tonight in Part B, we're going to be playing a little bit of Beat the Host.
So you might want to get your phones nearby or your Skype line ready because we'll be taking the first caller to play Beat the Host.
Not now, but when we come back and we tell you to call in.
And if you haven't heard Beat the Host, it's a lot of fun.
Stay tuned for tonight's Beat the Host.
We'll be right back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
