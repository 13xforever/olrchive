00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,560
Today, September 16th, 2007, some cult games from the last generation are coming to Xbox

2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,080
360, a retro CD-based system is coming soon to Wii's Virtual Console, and do M-rated

3
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:34,040
games so better than other games? Orange Lounge Radio. Hello everybody out there on the internet

4
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,960
and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. We are that podcast dedicated to video

5
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,760
games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. My name is Rob Roberts, you

6
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,520
might know me as Sky. Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura,

7
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,320
Jamie Summers. What? How are you, Dark Sakura? Meh. I'm sorry to inconvenience you with our

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,160
little program tonight. I was busy. Busy doing what, might I ask? Petting my ferret. Petting

9
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,040
your ferret? Having fun? Is that a euphemism for something? Maybe I shouldn't ask. Say

10
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,840
hello to the tech master, Loki. Hello. How are you doing, Loki? I'm doing fine. I'm glad

11
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,440
to hear. Just fine? Well, I'm trying to get, I have a custom firmware on my PSP Slim, and

12
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,640
I'm trying to get it to run ISOs, but I think that there's been some changes versus what

13
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,720
I was running before, so. Gotcha. Well, happy birthday. A little late, by the way. Thank

14
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,720
you. Mr. Loki. And hope, you hope you had a good one, but I'm sure you'll tell us all

15
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,860
about your little birthday gathering last night in a minute. Yeah. During How Was Your

16
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,600
Gaming Week. But yeah, we're gonna start off with How Was Your Gaming Week. I want to introduce

17
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,200
the chat room, though. Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com. If you're listening to us live here on this

18
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,480
Sunday evening, you can join our chat room. Just head on over there. And of course, if

19
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,560
you aren't listening live, just join us sometime. We tape live Sunday nights at six o'clock

20
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,240
Pacific Standard Time on our live 365 feed, and now we have a webcam on Operator11.com,

21
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,020
although I don't know, the webcam feed's not that exciting. You just kind of like see my

22
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,760
face looking at the camera and Loki's back, because of the way the room's set up. But

23
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,760
I'm hoping when we finally move the show out into the bigger room, we'll have more stuff

24
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:13,040
to look at. So this is, this is all warm up. This is all the, the pre. This is the foreplay.

25
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,160
This is the, yeah, that's exactly right. This is the foreplay with the camera. Thank you.

26
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,040
Dark Soccer, always the witty one. All right, How Was Your Gaming Week. Since we don't have

27
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,840
guests here tonight to introduce, after last week's like clusterfuck of people, it's an

28
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,680
empty house tonight. We're just feeling the love, the three of us. Dark Soccer. I didn't

29
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:35,360
play anything. Nothing? Except World Cup Soccer. Oh, and we had Uno going on in my house, because

30
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,920
Dan's buddy Will has decided that he loves Uno now and has been doing what he calls Ultimate

31
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,880
Dickery Games. What, pray tell, is an Ultimate Dickery Game? Well, actually I've been calling

32
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,480
it that. He's just calling it being an asshole. As in doing all the make you draw until you

33
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,520
get the card and doing extra draws for challenges and things like that. And then he's doing

34
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,480
challenges all the time. So he's just being a complete asshole and he's doing it on purpose.

35
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,400
So like setting it to like the maximum cards you can possibly draw and all that stuff?

36
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,080
Yeah. I see. And I think, I don't know if he's doing it under Dan's gamertag, though.

37
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,120
I think he's doing it under his own. Or yours. No, he's not doing it under mine or I'll beat

38
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:23,120
the crap out of him with a ferret. That would be funny if he did, though. I'd laugh. I haven't

39
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:29,200
even touched Final Fantasy, though. Wow. Sorry to hear it. It's alright. I've been playing

40
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,320
World Cup Soccer, though. Like a fiend. UndeadZerg in our chat room actually says, DarkSakura

41
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:41,320
again? You love that World Cup Soccer. It's because it's the best pinball machine ever.

42
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,720
Well now, and unfortunately, I don't know if you were going to get into this later,

43
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,360
so I'm sorry for spoiling it, but I guess your desktop had a little crap out this week,

44
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,720
so that takes out your PC gaming. Well no, actually I have something else, but it sort

45
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,520
of goes into my FUs, sort of. I tried to get back into Guild Wars, and then we'll get into

46
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:06,560
the FUs later. Oh dear, alright. So you played more games than you thought. Well no, I updated

47
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:13,560
Guild Wars, and that's as far as I got. Uh oh. Dear PlayNC, please work on the weekends,

48
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:20,600
not love me. P.S. Crap. Alright, well then we'll go to Loki. Loki, how was your gaming

49
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,360
week? It was good. I took two days off this week to play games. Unfortunately, during

50
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,880
those two days, I really only played Bioshock. I did finish it, though, so that's good. And

51
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:38,320
unfortunately, I forgot to do a few things while playing through it, so I wasn't able

52
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,840
to get all the possible achievements I could, so I have to go back to some of the earlier

53
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,720
saves and maybe replay through it again, but I'm like 820 out of 1000, so that's pretty

54
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,920
good. Not bad for an achievement horse. Not bad, yeah. So I'll go back and do that stuff.

55
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:01,840
It's a good game, interesting twists. I mean, it's a pretty cool twist, and you don't realize

56
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,040
it throughout most of the game. I guess you kind of pick up on it a little bit as you

57
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:13,040
go through, but it's also good to note that those audio diaries kind of tell more of the

58
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,200
back story. They're not just there for achievements and stuff, so definitely check those out while

59
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:24,400
you're playing the game. And then other things, like I mentioned, I bought a PSP Slim. It

60
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,400
is very light, and of course the first thing I do to it, I hacked it and tried to put a

61
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:38,400
custom firmware on it, and now I have 3 PSVs for some reason. And I just bought the cables

62
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:43,180
for a video out today, so I haven't tried that yet. What is going to be pretty cool

63
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,460
though is when I do get the homebrew on there, because I'll be able to hook it up to my TV

64
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:53,060
and play around with that, and play Nintendo games on my TV I guess, though I can do that

65
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:59,420
with like 5 other systems. I don't know. And then I've been trying to get my PS2 back from

66
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:04,860
my sister so I can play the beta that got leaked out for Manhunt 2, because that's supposed

67
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,100
to be good. Other things I played during the week, more Call of Duty 4 beta. I still suck

68
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,900
at it, but it's going to be great. I can't wait for the game to come out. Of course,

69
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,980
more Saints Row multiplayer at work, and they're kind of getting frustrated with me because

70
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,980
I keep winning a lot, and buy a lot. So, sorry, it just...

71
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,580
And you're so humble too. Well, I don't play it that much, I only play

72
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:35,420
it at work, and so everyone thinks I'm practicing or something. I really don't, and it's not

73
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:41,620
like I'm that good or anything, I don't know. And then, I'm trying to think, what else?

74
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:47,220
I played some Xbox Live Arcade games. I played a little bit more Worms, and that's just kind

75
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,840
of... I don't know. I don't even know if I want to play that to get achievement points,

76
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,900
but yeah, I think that's pretty much it. Yeah, Worms was better like ten years ago.

77
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,940
Exactly. I love Worms Armageddon. That was like the ultimate for me, and then it just

78
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:07,500
kind of... they haven't done anything with it since Worms Armageddon, other than make

79
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,340
it worse. So, that's about it so far, yeah. Alright.

80
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,600
I got the Ratchet & Clank demo, but I didn't get to play it yet, so... for PS3.

81
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,980
You will be playing that soon. Yes, yes.

82
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:24,220
Alright. Well, my gaming week, I've of course been playing more Final Fantasy XI, and it's

83
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,460
pretty awesome because Shane, before he left town, he actually got me a clock for Final

84
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,800
Fantasy XI, which is actually pretty hilarious. It's a little Vanadiel clock. It actually

85
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,580
shows you what time it is in Vanadiel, along with the Earth time, and it sets these little

86
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,380
alarms that you can set on it. It's so funny. This is like for the totally hardcore gamer.

87
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,460
But when the timers run out, this is the best part. It plays like little music box music.

88
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:57,940
Hold on, let me see if I can get one to play. Isn't that the cutest thing you've ever seen?

89
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,100
And by cute, I mean you have to be like a real addict to appreciate something like that.

90
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,420
I feel sick to my stomach now. I will tell you what's made Final Fantasy

91
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:12,220
XI a little more tolerable this time around is the Windower. It's this third-party application

92
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,500
I'm really not supposed to be using, and I could probably get banned for saying that

93
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,940
I use it, but the Windower allows you to play Final Fantasy XI in a window. So instead of

94
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,100
sitting there looking for party, doing absolutely nothing, I can actually sit there and surf

95
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,340
the internet while I wait and look for a party. It's the best thing ever.

96
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,560
Now Windower does have some cheats built in, but I don't use them because that's how people

97
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,800
get caught, and I don't want to cheat. I think cheating in MMOs is screwed up, but I don't

98
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,060
see too much of the harm between flipping between different windows. I mean, I used

99
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,780
to have my laptop over here and doing that. World of Warcraft, you can. Guild Wars, you

100
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,060
can. Yeah, so I don't think it's a big deal about

101
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:53,060
that. So there you have it. Let's see. Uh-oh. Is our feed dropping? No?

102
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,780
It said it was lagging. It said it was lagging? All right, our chat

103
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,900
room's saying the feed's screwed up. If the feed keeps screwing up too bad, I guess we'll

104
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,060
have to kill Operator 11. I hope I don't have to do that. We'll see.

105
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,700
But I'm looking in the chat room here, and I'm looking at what the chat was saying. They

106
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,740
played their gaming week. We have a lot of threes in the gaming week. I see a lot of

107
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:15,020
Metroid Prime 3s people have been playing. Nintendo Maniac 64 says Metroid Prime 3.

108
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:20,620
Hitstun says Quake 3. Raw Steel UT says Persona 3. And then Son of Dad has been watching The

109
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:25,740
Office Season 3. There you go. And then also I've been playing on the DS Planet Puzzle

110
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,200
League, because Planet Puzzle League is all kinds of awesome. And trying to get more people

111
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,140
on my friends list, though, so I'll be posting my code in our little thread we have there

112
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,640
on the forums over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, trying to get more friends for Planet Puzzle

113
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,500
League that I can play against. I bought a pink DS Lite for Nellie, so now

114
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:50,180
she has her own gaming system to play with. Without having to bling it out?

115
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:56,660
Yeah, and I just got her today. I got her a pink case to go with it, so she's all pinked

116
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,820
out. So, before we get into housekeeping and gaming

117
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,660
news tonight, let's talk about your birthday gathering, Loki. You didn't mention anything

118
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,980
about our little trip this week. The real life game we played this week.

119
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:14,420
Yeah, we went to Stars in Vacaville, which is this bowling alley slash entertainment

120
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:22,220
center. It's got Qsar laser tag in there, which I think is the best laser tag game ever.

121
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:27,500
Of course, if you played at Stars, it is not the best laser tag game ever. It is pretty

122
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,620
bad actually nowadays, and this is probably the last time we'll be going back there.

123
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:40,580
The packs were horrible. I mean, just broken in every which way you can imagine. In fact,

124
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:45,580
I think the very first game I had, my pack had no speaker on it, so I couldn't tell whether

125
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:50,100
I was hitting people when I was out of lives, anything like that. Plus, it didn't shoot

126
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,620
straight, which didn't help either. They claimed that their computer system is

127
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,180
broken so that they can't change the game settings, which is bullshit because they said

128
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:05,660
the same thing last time and I yelled at them and they finally did it. Also, the people

129
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:11,820
that work there are complete morons. In fact, they didn't really give a shit about anything.

130
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,420
The second game, for example, we beat the other team by 800 points.

131
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:23,740
That game was awesome. It was the worst pummeling I've ever seen.

132
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,540
In the first game, the pack I had, I was like invincible. You could only kill me by shooting

133
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,340
my gun because my front and back was out. There were so many things wrong with that.

134
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:37,580
Eric went with us on Punk Night. I don't know anyone that might know him on Final Fantasy

135
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:43,620
11 or World of Warcraft, but he had a pack that said that he only fired five shots and

136
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:50,060
hit 59 people. His hit ratio is 100%. That's like ultimate bounce.

137
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:55,780
He never got hit, which is complete bullshit. He didn't fire. He fired a lot more than five

138
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,220
shots. The game was so fucked up and they really don't care.

139
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,380
So why don't you open your own?

140
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,020
Because it costs a lot of money to do that.

141
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,880
Can you get a loan?

142
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,980
Not that kind of a loan right now because I don't have property or any sort of collateral

143
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,980
to go with it.

144
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,980
Don't.

145
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:17,580
Car, but it's going to cost at least half a million dollars to open one of those places.

146
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:23,220
I'd love to do it because it's not that fucking hard. Shit, if they can run a laser tag place

147
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,900
there, and it may be poorly run, but they have just like two people doing it, it can

148
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,260
be done.

149
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:35,260
Not to mention, other than laser tag, we were just getting drinks in between games and stuff

150
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:40,100
and the fucker, and they have this little cafe or something that you can buy food at,

151
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,140
and they have one person working there pretty much at the counter and I guess running food

152
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,140
also.

153
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,220
So it took us 10 minutes to get a fucking soda because she kept helping other people

154
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:54,020
and I guess you fucked up orders and stuff like that.

155
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:59,900
It was just really horrible and none of the equipment at the laser tag place looked like

156
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,540
it had been repaired in years, it's just really fallen apart.

157
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,860
So fuck them, we will not be coming back.

158
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,420
You know, I want to point out last night was the first time I've seen a DDR machine in

159
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:17,180
a long time too, but the thing I thought was interesting is I kind of assumed that DDR

160
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,500
was kind of dead, and I know this might piss a lot of people off that obviously our show

161
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,500
started a long time ago about DDR, we all met playing Dance Dance Revolution and everything,

162
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,980
so I know it's kind of funny I'm saying this now, but I kind of thought most people play

163
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,620
Dance Dance Revolution at home now, because that's where all the new stuff comes out is

164
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,980
home and there's been some pretty decent mixes we've gotten on the home versions, but I was

165
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,060
kind of surprised, there was a little crowd of kids all around the supernova machine that

166
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,780
only appeared to be half working, like the monitor was screwed up on that thing, but

167
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:48,700
I kind of walked by and was just like, hmm, some kid was doing max 300, it's like you're

168
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,380
not cool unless you can do max 300 these days.

169
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,720
Well he worked there too, he was the one that marshaled their second game, I wouldn't even

170
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,040
call it marshaling, or for example I was arguing with him because he's like, yeah those two

171
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,220
packs in the back work, I'm like no, we played those packs last game, they're fucking broken,

172
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,140
and the laser doesn't shoot straight, and he's like, well you mean the laser?

173
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,220
I'm like no, the emitter does not shoot straight, oh, well they're still working, I'm like no

174
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:17,620
they're not, you fucking retard, I just hate talking to them, especially when they're saying

175
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,440
that their system's broken, I'm like, do I need to come back there and set up my own

176
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,980
damn game, because I know how to do it.

177
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,980
Interesting, I just thought it was interesting that there's still that whole little community

178
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:33,020
for DDR, but that's cool, I'm really glad, even though I kind of thought it was dead,

179
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,500
just because there hasn't been a whole lot of new stuff, I mean supernova didn't bring

180
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,260
a whole lot of new stuff to the table besides new songs, so I was just kind of surprised,

181
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,700
that's all.

182
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,700
So call me a cynic, whatever.

183
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,700
We need supernova too.

184
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,700
Hi cynic!

185
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,700
Shut up.

186
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:51,060
Alright, anyhow, let's see, let's get into some housekeeping for tonight, of which we

187
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:57,140
don't really have much, there's not a whole lot to say, so I will plug our MySpace and

188
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,260
LiveJournal communities, and ways that you can interact with us online, of course there's

189
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:05,560
our website, www.orangelandtrady.com, or we have a MySpace as well, you should add us,

190
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,020
and we'll be your friend on MySpace, and sometimes we post little things up there, especially

191
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:14,740
like bonus shows, and weird things we tape other places, for instance we taped a show

192
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,780
at AnatomyCon earlier this year that you could only get in our communities, so it's MySpace.com

193
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,500
slash OrangeLoungeRadio, you can add us there, or you can add us on LiveJournal, our community

194
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,700
on LiveJournal is also OrangeLoungeRadio, so there you go, actually no, I think we're

195
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,220
OrangeLounge on LiveJournal, I can't remember.

196
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:36,220
I think that I don't remember, I don't remember either, I think we're just OrangeLounge on

197
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:41,300
LiveJournal, I'm trying to look right now, this is great radio I know, this is the best

198
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:46,980
radio ever, I'm really excited to be a part of this, it's just completely amazing, next

199
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,860
time before I, yeah there it is, we're just OrangeLounge on LiveJournal, there you go,

200
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:59,580
let's see, I don't look at our MySpace anymore, Rioma says Wii online laser tag, dude, would

201
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:05,020
that be awesome, an online laser tag with a Wii, no, I don't know, you know what would

202
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:11,220
have been awesome is Metroid Prime 3 online, but that's just me, yeah that'd be awesome,

203
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:17,060
there was some actual online content, alright, with a Wii, let's get into some gaming news

204
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:23,620
then since we've given the community's ample plugging, yes, big news coming just before

205
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:33,900
Tokyo Game Show here, including some big announcements, including the inclusion of Rez Ikaruga Exit

206
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:40,900
and more on Xbox Live Arcade, which is really awesome, this news makes me so happy, Rez,

207
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:50,420
Rez, Rez, they need to do like a new trans vibrator thing, I doubt it, anyways, yeah,

208
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:58,700
Microsoft had their pre-show conference and Tetsuya Mizuguchi, of course, they're confirming

209
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:05,380
that both his, I guess remake of Rez, Rez HD, which is pretty much just Rez in high

210
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:12,700
definition, yay, and then of course Ikaruga Exit, which has appeared on the PSP, and of

211
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:18,380
course some that have already been announced already, Every Extend, Extra Extreme, and

212
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:25,500
of course Omega 5, also known as E, sorry, I'm going to my happy place right now, and

213
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,100
Trigger Heart Alexia, if I mentioned I love Tetsuya Mizuguchi, you know what would make

214
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,820
me happier with all of that, if they're giving us Ikaruga, why can't they give us another

215
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,660
release of Radiant Silver Gun, wrong twice now, alright, anyways, lots of awesome games

216
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:46,700
coming to Xbox Live Arcade, so, yay, I'm excited, I'll definitely be buying Rez, Jamie, explain

217
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:53,860
for our listeners what makes Rez so awesome, thump, thump, thump, I can't explain what

218
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:59,020
makes Rez so great, but it's totally one of those trippy things, it's like playing Vibribbin,

219
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:03,900
it reminds me of those old trance music videos that you used to see on MTV's AMP, like really

220
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,380
late at night, remember that show AMP, back when MTV actually played videos, it would

221
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,940
come on like 12 or 1 in the morning, like it reminded me of that show, except you were

222
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,860
playing it, and the cool thing about Rez is that as you're flying around shooting things,

223
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,780
the little lasers and stuff are all in time with the music, I can't explain it, but it's

224
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,940
like seriously one of those games you just zone out to, I can't think of any better way

225
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,300
to explain it, Vibribbin's kind of like that, but not to the extent that Rez is, you don't

226
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,480
zone out on it, but Vibribbin is definitely trippy enough that you have to blink again

227
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,500
when you move your eyes away from the screen, there you go, uh, Tigerclaw in our chatroom

228
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,160
at chat.orangelandtrader.com says, I guess Rez is the kind of game you play if you want

229
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:44,520
to create your own personal rave, sorta, sorta, there you go, fucking awesome at a rave I

230
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:50,340
think. Can you imagine playing that just at a rave? Huge, you know, giant screens. That

231
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,320
might be a way to kinda do it. People trippin' out and stuff, that'd be awesome. Alright,

232
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,180
so I'm very very happy about this news, it definitely takes me to my happy place, um,

233
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:04,300
Exit I haven't really checked out before, so I'm kind of interested in it. Well, I never

234
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,460
played it, but a lot of people love it, so it's one of those kind of niche things, but

235
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,580
just like Ikaruga was one of those niche games. By chance did they say when this- Ikaruga

236
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,740
was awesome. Did they say when this all was coming out? Uh, I know some of that list,

237
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:21,900
like the Omega 5 was supposed to be due out in November, so, soon? I know, um, was Every

238
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,400
Extend Extra Extreme is supposed to be coming out this year as well, I think, so. Nice.

239
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,820
I actually, I liked Every Extend Extra on the PSP, that's another one of those just

240
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,860
like totally chill out games. I need to borrow that from you. You want to? I'll go get it.

241
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,140
Okay. This is an awesome game for PSP, so. I will go find it, but first I'm gonna read

242
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:44,000
a story for you all about another awesome game, and of course, since we have a lot of

243
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,580
music game fans that listen to our program, you guys all know this game, Elite Beat Agents.

244
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,580
Hell, even the non-music game fans know this game, Elite Beat Agents. Oh my god. Good time.

245
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,680
Our Owen Don, for those of you guys who like to import the game. Well, what's cool about

246
00:19:54,680 --> 00:20:01,440
this is that INIS, who actually developed Elite Beat Agents, they are currently working

247
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:08,420
on an unnamed Xbox 360 title. Now, that doesn't mean it's Elite Beat Agents 360, like, you

248
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,640
know, that would be really hard, because there's no touchscreen on the 360, but it's just kind

249
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,860
of cool that the development team is developing something for another system. They're not

250
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:20,400
just going to keep games on the DS, so they are making something on the Xbox 360. It should

251
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,940
be said that some of the other games that this company has made, Guitar Man, was another

252
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:29,500
game that they made. So, maybe Guitar Man 360? That'd be kind of rad. Well, they, you

253
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:35,240
know, did Guitar Man, well it was really just more like a Guitar Man remix on PSP, where

254
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,260
you could play as What's-Your-Face. Yeah, that's kind of like the Parappa thing on PSP.

255
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,260
It's missable. It's not the end of the world if you don't get it, right? Kick, punch. It's

256
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:51,260
all in the mind. Hey, my guitar is in my mind. Unjama Lamy 360. Oh, wait, that's not a Unjama

257
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:57,960
Lamy. That uses the Guitar Hero controller. That would be kind of cool for a live title

258
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,660
that uses that controller, but then again, it wouldn't be accessible to everybody. But

259
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,400
I think it would be cool to have like another music game on Xbox Live Marketplace, because,

260
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,460
you know, we have Boom Boom Rocket, but Boom Boom Rocket kind of died off. Like, they didn't

261
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,440
really expand on it at all. I was thinking there was going to be download packs that

262
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,740
maybe had some better songs, because the default songs are just all like classical song remixes

263
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:22,340
that aren't that great. So, there's kind of a lack of music game stuff. Like playing V

264
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,420
for five hours? Well, that's just, you know, going to the arcade when DDR Extreme first

265
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,660
came out, but that's a whole other story. So, anyway. Well, I'm excited to see what

266
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:35,340
the team comes up with for the 360. Well, this puts me in my happy place. I love Ninja

267
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:40,860
Gaiden, and we're getting a Ninja Gaiden 2, and you can kill a lot of people as Ryu, who's

268
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:47,100
like majorly cool and awesome with, oh, the only thing is that he doesn't have the cool

269
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:54,100
looking scarf, but otherwise. But Itadaki is basically saying, here we go, Ninja Gaiden

270
00:21:54,100 --> 00:22:00,300
2 on Xbox 360, so that makes me happy. Man, it's uber violent. Lots of blood flying everywhere.

271
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,060
Yeah, I love violence and blood. Like, I like this picture of him totally cutting off this

272
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:11,060
guy's head, and it's like, it's not just blood, it's like this glorious fountain of crimson

273
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:18,340
floating toward the air and covering everything in, you know, it's glory. I think that's beautiful.

274
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:25,340
It's going to be pretty awesome. Something that's sort of awesome, I guess, Viva Pinata.

275
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:32,060
It's a game, of course. It came out last year. Some people liked it. I didn't. But, someone

276
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:39,060
decided that they love Viva Pinata so much that they proposed to their spouse on it.

277
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:46,460
And so, yes, it's, I don't know, cheesy. Very, very cheesy. I guess cute.

278
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:50,700
Just say no. But, I mean, why would you use Viva Pinata,

279
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:57,140
like, send a message over? I mean, that's just kind of cheesy.

280
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,020
As I understand it, wasn't it the case that, like, she actually didn't believe the guy

281
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:05,500
at first when she got the message or she laughed it off? It's like, ah ha ha, that's cute.

282
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,460
But then, like, the guy actually got down on one knee and proposed or something like

283
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,700
that? So. Yeah, so it. Okay, if you're thinking about

284
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,940
proposing to your spouse, don't do it over a game. I mean, seriously, I don't care how

285
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:23,940
much you two love the game. Do not do it over a game. It's really cheesy and stupid.

286
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:30,580
Why not? Jamie got proposed to over UHF. Well, it's not necessarily as much of a proposal

287
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:37,040
as much of a, we should just get married. Okay? When? Sometime. And, you know, seven

288
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,980
years later. It's just, it is pretty cheesy though. I mean.

289
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,700
It's no cheesier than the people who go to a basketball game and have it go out over

290
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,060
the big screen. You know, that's pretty cheesy too.

291
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:52,820
I'd be like, don't embarrass me into marrying you shit.

292
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:57,500
I'm kind of curious what other type of video game related proposals have happened. I'm

293
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,500
kind of looking at our chat room. I'm not seeing a whole lot of stuff there. But what

294
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,700
I thought was very interesting about this story is that a lot of sites really ran this,

295
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,260
although this is really someone's, you know, personal business. But some guy just got kind

296
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,520
of creative. I'm surprised that we never saw an Animal Crossing wedding proposal. Maybe

297
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,140
there was and I just forgot about it. But, you know.

298
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:22,100
Yeah, I mean, that's something I guess. I don't know. I was going to say, I know they've

299
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,940
done World of Warcraft, that's for sure. And Final Fantasy XI, I'm sure Second Life

300
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,620
has done it. You know, pretty much named the MMO and I'm sure that someone's tried to

301
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:37,300
get married over it. Or actually performed a ceremony in-game, which is a whole...

302
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,700
Like Ragnarok Weddings, remember Ragnarok? A whole other nerdy, oh my god.

303
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:48,340
It was actually in the game too, so hey. Need to unplug, seriously. And of course, you

304
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:53,060
know, especially with Final Fantasy XI, of course they're going to, you know, you can

305
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:59,940
do it and then they'll just milk you for any sort of in-game money for it.

306
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,940
Comments from chat, lots of comments from chat here. Chat.orangesonshadeo.com if you

307
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:08,420
want to comment live on this Sunday night. Escapist says, on one hand it's sort of touching,

308
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:14,900
on the other... Nochillynopitty says, I'm going to propose using an automated Super

309
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,660
Mario World level.

310
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,340
Oh my god, those are great. No, have you seen the automated?

311
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,660
Yeah, I've seen some YouTubage of those automated levels. Those are pretty awesome.

312
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:28,700
Those are amazing. I was watching them for like two hours on Friday night.

313
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,020
Jamie, I made this in your honor. Will you marry me?

314
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,020
No.

315
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:38,420
Let's see. RasteelUT says, well, there was that one couple in Japan that got married

316
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,420
in Phantasy Star Online. Wow.

317
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,900
Ryoma says, propose over PictoChat. That's a little interesting.

318
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:52,180
Well, you're going to be like 65 feet away. Come on. The least you could do is actually

319
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:57,420
go up to them and say, will you marry me? Instead of just like, look, I drew a little

320
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:03,920
picture that says, will you marry me? Aww, how cute. No. Just do it.

321
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:10,040
It's like, okay, you know, I hate to even quote like Kelly, but you don't text message

322
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:17,040
break up, okay? You don't text, you don't fucking PictoChat, you know, engage.

323
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:25,540
Oh my god, Loki, you're such a bitch. I'm going to bet slap you, deckhead. I can't believe

324
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,860
Loki quoted Kelly.

325
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:35,120
It's just, it's stupid. It really is. If you think it's cute, okay, great, it's cute, but

326
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:41,140
you know, anyone that doesn't play the game, like your parents, relatives, they're going

327
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,900
to be going, what?

328
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:48,660
What if like you sent a text message over PictoChat that said something like, you know,

329
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,660
open the book on the table and then the book has a ring in it and then like you're on one

330
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,660
knee. Would that be cute?

331
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:58,460
That would be cute, but okay, just doing it in Animal Crossing is kind of lame.

332
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,580
GS68 said the best thing ever.

333
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,580
What?

334
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,780
Will you be my 2P?

335
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,780
What's that? Where?

336
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,780
Second player.

337
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,460
Will you be my 2P? I get it.

338
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,460
That's cute.

339
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,100
There's some great comments in chat tonight. You guys are funny. Escapist says, better

340
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:16,680
PictoChat than Ping Pals. If I got proposed to in Ping Pals, I'd say no. I'd say you couldn't

341
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:23,100
find something better. No. Get out. In fact, get out of my house. Let's see. I like footy

342
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:31,420
monsters comment too. If I ever proposed to my girl on a game, she'd never see it. Wow.

343
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,500
That's kind of like Loki and proposing to Nellie. How did you propose to Nellie? I can't

344
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,500
remember.

345
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:41,900
It wasn't over PictoChat. That's for sure. It sure as hell wasn't over Viva Pinata.

346
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,700
Is it private or what? Can you share it?

347
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:49,020
No. We were talking about getting married for a while, so we didn't really have a proposal

348
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,940
or anything, but I sure as hell didn't do it over like Viva Pinata or anything.

349
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,260
Did you get on one knee and everything?

350
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:59,860
Actually, no, I didn't. Oh my God, you bastard. It doesn't matter. We were going to do it

351
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,860
anyways.

352
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:05,220
No, it's fine. The wedding was really nice, if nothing else. Even if you have no good

353
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,220
proposal story.

354
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,980
Even if you took my camera in the bathroom.

355
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:14,940
Do we have to get into those discussions? You know, that was a very M-rated experience,

356
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,700
and you know what they say about M-rated games?

357
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,480
Let's buy them.

358
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,420
That's right. Let's get them. This M-rated game is $300. M-rated games have higher scores

359
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:31,540
and better sales. That is to be if a recent study by the electronic entertainment design

360
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:37,820
and research firm is to be believed. They actually were evaluating some games that were

361
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:44,000
rated mature by the ESRB, even though mature rated games are only about 10% of what's out

362
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,580
there on what the ESRB rates. Apparently, these titles, quote, have both the highest

363
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:55,140
average metacritic scores and the highest average gross sales in the United States.

364
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:02,060
So apparently, having a mature rated game is actually a ticket to better sales. Who

365
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:07,580
knows? What do you guys think? Is this story surprising? I actually think this is a little

366
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,580
surprising.

367
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,300
I don't think it has anything to do with the fact that it's rated M or anything. I just

368
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,100
think a lot of the games that come out that are really good, they're your big blockbuster

369
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:22,220
games, are rated M. I mean, let's look at the last few things that have come out. Bioshock

370
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:30,780
was rated M. Stranglehold was rated M. Heavenly Sword, no, that's Teen. I think Halo's rated

371
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,780
M.

372
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:37,440
Okay, and that's fine for the hardcore gamers like us, but sometimes us hardcore gamers

373
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,960
keep discounting the casual gamers. You know, it wasn't like the top-selling game last year

374
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,860
based on some movie, you know?

375
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,860
Cars?

376
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,860
Yeah, Cars.

377
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,860
That was a horrible game.

378
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:51,020
But, you know, Cars is an E-rated game, I'm sure. It would be kind of cool if there was

379
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,460
an M-rated Cars edition.

380
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:56,940
It might make it a little bit better, but not much.

381
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:03,740
So anyway, if you want to visit the Electronic Entertainment Design and Research, it's EEDAR.com,

382
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:08,460
and they have a whole little press release about it on their site. So check it out.

383
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:15,460
And hopefully this will bode well for the upcoming release of Manhunt 2, but we'll see.

384
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,800
So that's all I have to say on the M-rated games. I'm actually looking to see if there's

385
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,040
anything in chat here.

386
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:25,260
Ryoma seems to agree, because mature-rated games include Metal Gear Solid, Halo, and

387
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,260
GTA.

388
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,140
Let's see.

389
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:34,120
No Chilly No Pity says, that's weird. Comedy films potentially make a lot more rated as

390
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:39,100
PG-13 versus R. Kind of an interesting comparison there.

391
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,260
But Ross Deal UT says, well, that's in theaters. What about DVD?

392
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,260
Hmm.

393
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,260
Interesting.

394
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:51,160
Well, in other news, speaking of news since you brought up movies, Activision has a demo

395
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:59,660
out for Spider-Man Friend or Foe on Xbox Live. It's 432 megabytes, and what you do is you

396
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:05,900
either play as Spider-Man or you are in a co-op mode with either the Green Goblin or

397
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:12,380
Venom. And you can, in the demo, you fight Dr. Octopus, which is kind of cool.

398
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:19,260
So it's going to be on PS2, 360, and Wii put out by Next Level Games. They also gave us

399
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:24,020
Mario Strikers. Mario Strikers Charged, I'm sorry.

400
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,140
And there's a PC version, I think, too.

401
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:32,100
I was also going to say, there's some other stuff that's come out on Live. They had the

402
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,820
demo for, well, it's actually another demo, I guess, for Juice 2. It's a multiplayer demo

403
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:44,360
now, so you can check that out as well. I want to say Tony Hawk's Proving Grounds also

404
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:49,660
up there now. There's another one, too.

405
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,500
Have you played all the demos, Loki? Are you pretty good at staying on top of those?

406
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,220
I try to. I haven't gone around to a lot of them yet.

407
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,420
So what are the ones we need to be playing?

408
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:01,580
I would say Tony Hawk's going to be pretty good. I mean, usually Tony Hawk games are

409
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:07,820
pretty fun. Definitely play Flat-Out Ultimate Carnage. I cannot stress that enough. That

410
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,580
game is so awesome.

411
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:16,920
Timeshift might be okay. I don't know, I played an old-ass demo for it back when it was owned

412
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:24,660
by Atari, and it was okay then. I don't know if I'd buy that game, though, or not.

413
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:31,460
I would say, let's see, on PlayStation 3, I know Ratchet and Clank's, if you pre-order

414
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:37,700
it, you can get the demo with that. And then I was going to say they have Pixel Junk Racers,

415
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:44,580
but that's not really a demo, I guess. I don't know. There's still a lot of stuff. I'm sure

416
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,260
more demos are going to be coming out soon, especially the Tokyo Game Show and how they

417
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,140
do that bringing it home stuff.

418
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,300
True. Hoping for some really good shit.

419
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:57,300
SSJ100Matt says, I hear the new Flat-Out is getting closer and closer to a Burnout clone.

420
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:01,300
I think we talked about this a little bit last week. The box art certainly is, but the

421
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,420
game itself, Logi, from what you see?

422
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,660
Burnout's going in a completely different direction, so I guess you can compare it to

423
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:11,740
some of the older Burnouts, but the new Burnout game's nothing like it.

424
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,540
Isn't the new Burnout game more like Test Drive, where it's like an open world?

425
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:20,740
Sort of. It's just really open. I don't even know how to really describe it. It's just

426
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,940
kind of like an open world where you're driving around doing stunts, crashing. I guess it's

427
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:28,740
sort of like Test Drive, but a lot more interesting.

428
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:34,980
All right. Very cool. All right. Well, let's get into some release dates and talk about

429
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,420
not just the things you can download on Xbox Live, but what you can go run out and pick

430
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,420
up at stores this week around the globe.

431
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:46,900
Lots of big stuff. This week, of course, starting to really get into the fourth quarter stuff,

432
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:51,500
including, as I mentioned, there's a demo out for Just Two Hot Import Nights coming

433
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:57,660
out on PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 this week, as well as, well, PlayStation 3's coming out

434
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,660
the week after, because you know all those PlayStation 3 delays.

435
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:07,860
And then, on PlayStation 2, if you happen to love Karaoke, well, there's quite a bit

436
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:12,860
of it this week. Sing Star 80s is coming out both the game by itself and a game bundled

437
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:19,380
with microphones, as well as, Sing Star Amped in both versions there.

438
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:27,540
And let's see, also on PlayStation 2 and 360, we have Warriors Orochi, which is a very unique

439
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:33,180
game by Koei that combines Samurai Warriors with Dynasty Warriors. So, if you love the

440
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:37,700
Dynasty Warriors games, it's yet another one.

441
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:43,420
On PSP, Coded Arms Contagion, finally coming out, as well as Yu-Gi-Oh! GX...

442
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,420
I thought that game got cancelled.

443
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,940
No, that was the PlayStation 3 one.

444
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,940
Oh.

445
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:57,340
Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 2, also coming out on PSP. Let's see, on PS3 this week, Stuntman

446
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:04,220
Ignition, finally coming out. And then, also on 360, Eternal Sonata, which is going to

447
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,220
be pretty big.

448
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,300
Sold. I'm so getting that game.

449
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,900
What were you telling me about Eternal Sonata before the show started tonight, Jamie?

450
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,540
Well, I'd know that Chopin killed himself by drinking cholera and vested water because

451
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,540
of his lifestyle.

452
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:20,020
Yes, he was a gay guy or something, right?

453
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,020
Yes.

454
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,020
Where'd you read this, Wikipedia?

455
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,540
No, actually I learned it in music theory in high school.

456
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:28,180
Wow. That's interesting. But, like, you know, I totally read that the game is based on the

457
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:33,700
hallucinations he had before he died. That's, like, all kinds of rad, in my opinion, but

458
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,980
we'll talk more about it later, I guess.

459
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:41,220
I'm also coming out, Blades and Angels 2, Secret Missions of World War II. The first

460
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:46,020
game is kind of eh, but, you know, hey, you might like it.

461
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:51,020
Let's see, on the Wii, My Sims, also coming out on the DS as well.

462
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:55,500
Cosmic Family, if you have really little kids that like to learn, there you go.

463
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:00,980
Fishing Master, which is that Hudson-based fishing game, which I didn't think we really

464
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:04,380
saw too much of it, but eh, if you like fishing, it might be cool.

465
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:11,340
Mercury Meltdown Revolution, it's a cool puzzle game, only $20 for the Wii, so check it out.

466
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:15,460
Anubis 2, eh, budget game, so, eh, maybe.

467
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:20,180
And then, Dewey's Adventure is also coming out on the Wii.

468
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:23,300
Let's see, DS, my god, there's, like, way too much stuff this week.

469
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:29,540
DS, Digimon World Dawn and Dusk, as well as, I believe, Digimon World is also coming out

470
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,760
on Data Squad on PS2.

471
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:40,380
We've also got, let's see here, Frisbee Disc Bundle, which is Frisbee Disc Golf and Ultimate

472
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,580
Frisbee, woo hoo.

473
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:48,060
Nancy Drew is going to be getting the game, Namco Museum, actually, I hear the Nancy Drew

474
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:52,020
games are pretty awesome, I shouldn't just pass it off because it's a Nancy Drew game,

475
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,820
I've actually heard they're pretty awesome.

476
00:36:53,820 --> 00:37:00,220
Namco Museum DS is coming out, and that's kind of interesting, I guess.

477
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:04,580
On PC, World in Conflict is coming out, I know that's going to be pretty big.

478
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:11,380
Then some of these weird games here, Big Buck Hunter, 30,000 games, I Love Kittens, I Love

479
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:20,060
Puppies, and, I Love Puppies 2, Loki, Stranglehold, I guess, is coming out as well, woo.

480
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:26,500
And I think there might be a couple other things on PS2 here, let me take a look, and

481
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:33,820
Pro Lancer 5, that one's actually supposed to be pretty big, some crappy Honda SBK07

482
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:40,780
Superbike game, and Safe and Filter Dark Mirror, and that's it.

483
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:48,180
Wow, lots and lots of stuff coming out this week in the US, and you know, the Japanese

484
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:52,020
launch calendar looks pretty full as well, not quite as much as we've got over here,

485
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,660
but certainly there's quite a bit of stuff coming out over there.

486
00:37:54,660 --> 00:38:00,380
The Madden 08 Japanese version makes its way to the Xbox 360 this week on September 20,

487
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,980
2007, and it does look like it's localized there for Japan with the text and all that

488
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:08,740
stuff, but I imagine it's still the same teams, because it's still the NFL, so there you have

489
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,740
it.

490
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:15,340
Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Sengoku Musou Katana, which I'm imagining is a little

491
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,060
bit of a sword fighting game, I'm trying to look at some of the screenshots, and it kind

492
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,980
of reminds me, what's that old Sega arcade game, they have it like Dave and Buster's,

493
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,180
you can swing the sword around, what the hell is that game?

494
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,180
I can't remember the name of it.

495
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,420
Oh, I know what you're talking about, too.

496
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:32,180
It looks like it might be this kind of game, I don't know, so we'll go.

497
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,180
Go with that.

498
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:38,400
Anyhow, Burnout Dominator is coming out on the Playstation 2 in Japan, so check that out,

499
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,700
and coming out as well on the Playstation 2, Keniro no Korda 2 Anchor is coming out,

500
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:48,940
it's an RPG, also coming out on the Playstation 2, huh?

501
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,740
By the way, I have to correct myself, because once I thought about it, I realized it wasn't

502
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,300
upon it, it was Tchaikovsky.

503
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,300
Oh.

504
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:00,180
Oh, is it because, uh, people did their research on Wikipedia or something?

505
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:04,620
No, I knew that, and once I said it, I was like, no, that wasn't who it was, I'm sorry,

506
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,620
I'm correcting myself.

507
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,420
It's all good.

508
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,620
I'm still looking forward to the game, because it is based on hallucinations, one way or

509
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,620
the other.

510
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,620
I like hallucinations.

511
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,800
It's based on the 70s!

512
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,660
It's basically the musical hair in video game form, but not really.

513
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:25,340
Anyway, back to Japanese releases, Saint Beast, Rasen no Shu is coming out on the Playstation

514
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:29,780
2 as well, an action-based game, Saint Beast.

515
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:36,340
Coming out on the Nintendo DS, Deltora Quest, Sevensu no Hoseki is coming out, it's another

516
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:42,900
RPG game on the DS, as well as Elemental Monster, which looks to be a card-based action game.

517
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,820
Not sure what that is, if that's based on anime or what that is, but that's coming out

518
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,540
on the DS over there in Japan.

519
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:53,820
PSP is getting Burnout Dominator on the 20th over in Japan, and R-Type Tactics comes out

520
00:39:53,820 --> 00:40:00,540
on, it's a strategy tactical game based on R-Type on the PSP, pretty awesome.

521
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,540
So there you have it.

522
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,540
It's not really R-Type then.

523
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,540
It is R-Type.

524
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:08,300
It's R-Type-ish, I don't know, but there you have it, that's what's coming out on the Japanese

525
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,300
calendar for September 20th.

526
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,400
It's only R-Type if you fly around and shoot stuff.

527
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,900
You do, in a turn-based strategy fashion.

528
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,780
That's not fun.

529
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,660
So how about some European release dates?

530
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,660
How about it?

531
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:27,060
Well, for our buddies in the UK, on the 20th, Loco Roco Cocorecho comes out on PlayStation

532
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:34,900
3, 21st Drawn to Life and My Sims, also My Sims is coming out on the Wii, and why is

533
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,100
there two listings for My Sims on the Wii?

534
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,100
Anyway.

535
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:44,340
It also, oh, there's two listings for it on Wii and DS, and one of them has a space and

536
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,420
one doesn't, I guess that makes it special.

537
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:53,420
SingStar Rock Ballads on PlayStation 2, Stranglehold on PC, and World in Conflict on PC.

538
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:57,020
Oh yeah, and Halo 3 on the 26, who cares.

539
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:00,580
And just in case if anyone's actually thinking about buying My Sims, just so you know, it's

540
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:04,300
not multiplayer, it's only one player.

541
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,300
Totally lame.

542
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,300
It's poo.

543
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,300
Yeah.

544
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,300
Anywho.

545
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,300
Alright.

546
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:20,580
One thing that's not quite as lame, but you can actually get Ratchet & Clank, the demo,

547
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:26,460
which will be coming out October the 4th, and looks pretty awesome, and that'll be on

548
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:31,140
PlayStation 3, actually a good PlayStation 3 game coming out for once.

549
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:36,220
And if you can't wait until October 4th like I did, you can also pre-order your game at

550
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:41,300
GameStop, and they have a demo disc for you.

551
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:45,100
I'm just snickering in chat because Escapist just said, oh I thought you guys were talking

552
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,740
about a game called My Sins for a second.

553
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,540
My god, these people need to only hear it.

554
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,860
Someone thought I said, when I said Big Butt Hunter, they thought, Big Butt Hunter?

555
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:58,020
I gotta get that game on PC, that's gonna be awesome.

556
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,980
That would be like Boonga Boonga.

557
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:00,980
Hosted by Sir Mix-a-Lot.

558
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,980
Big Butt Hunter.

559
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,100
That would be like Boonga Boonga.

560
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,740
Oh my god.

561
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,340
Mark Sakura, look at her butt.

562
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,340
It is so big.

563
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,340
Wow.

564
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:15,580
And now, why are they talking about, gosh, our chat room is random tonight.

565
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:21,060
JV Monn says, I want Silent Hill, the Hannah Montana edition.

566
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:24,580
To which Hippolytus responds, Silent Hill, Hannah Montana would never be as awesome as

567
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,740
Silent Hill, Britney Spears.

568
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:29,180
Go figure.

569
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:33,020
Although I do think in the next Silent Hill game, Pyramid Head should come out and go,

570
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,900
it's Pyramid Head, bitch.

571
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,140
Like the new Britney song?

572
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,580
Forget it.

573
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:41,020
Anyhow, more games on the way to the Playstation 3.

574
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:44,580
I don't know a whole lot about this game, so hopefully, you know, I haven't been following

575
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:49,420
PS3 like I should be, like a good amateur game journalist.

576
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:54,620
But on November 20th on the Playstation 3, Uncharted, Drake's Fortune is coming out.

577
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:58,500
So Loki, what is so amazing about this game that I should be paying attention to it for?

578
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,900
Well it's sort of amazing, it's basically Tomb Raider with a guy.

579
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,620
I've done Tomb Raider, you know what I mean?

580
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,620
Is he scantily clad?

581
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,620
He's not scantily clad.

582
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:11,420
They're companions kind of like Tomb Raider and he'd be like, Jones, there's a chick in

583
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:17,260
it, and you know, he shoots things and it's in a jungle, woo!

584
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:20,660
Go Naughty Dog for original content for the PS3.

585
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,660
That's funny.

586
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:26,460
Well there you have it, you can check it out for yourself on November 20th when Uncharted,

587
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,780
Drake's Fortune comes to the PS3.

588
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,640
Let me put it this way, you know what, if it's fun, I don't care if it's like Tomb Raider

589
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,640
with a guy.

590
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,140
Just wait, there's nothing else.

591
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,140
So enjoy.

592
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:37,580
Well there you have it.

593
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:42,780
I know I'll be first in line, but not really to get Uncharted.

594
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:49,380
Well we did discuss this a little bit earlier, but Eternal Sonata is coming out on PS3.

595
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,780
It has been confirmed, and we've already talked about it.

596
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,780
Shh!

597
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,980
What hasn't been confirmed?

598
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:00,900
Wait a minute, we did talk about Eternal Sonata, but we were talking about it on the 360, so

599
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,340
now we're hearing that the game is actually coming out on the PlayStation 3?

600
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,340
As well?

601
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,340
Namco says no.

602
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,340
What?

603
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,340
Yeah.

604
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:11,380
As I seem to recall, there's been a lot of drama that's played out on the internet this

605
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:15,740
week where, you know, oh yeah, for one, we're not supposed to talk about Namco's release

606
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:23,620
calendar on this show, but they seem to consistently do this, where they put these things out there,

607
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,240
whether it be on the ESRB, right?

608
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,300
Wasn't Eternal Sonata listed on the ESRB?

609
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,300
That it was pulled.

610
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,300
Twice.

611
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,060
It was on their own freaking website, then it was pulled.

612
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:35,340
It was also put back onto the ESRB list.

613
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,900
And now it's on the ESRB list again.

614
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,780
And it was on their website.

615
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:43,740
It's almost like Namco's doing this on purpose to keep getting the story bumped up to the

616
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,740
top of blogs.

617
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:48,780
I mean, Eternal Sonata is coming out this week after all, hmm.

618
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:49,780
How about Who Cares?

619
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:56,960
Let me put it this way, it's, obviously it's gonna still come out on PS3.

620
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,500
That is, I mean, if you believe that it's not, you're an idiot.

621
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:04,660
And I believe also Beautiful Katamari is listed on there for PlayStation 3 and the Wii as

622
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,900
well to be determined.

623
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:11,180
Which, you know, we didn't tell you that six months ago when the story first hit the internet.

624
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,820
I bet you anything.

625
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,580
We never changed our stance.

626
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,580
Everybody else did.

627
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:18,900
I bet you anything, it's still coming out next spring.

628
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:19,900
I agree.

629
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,300
It's confirmed in my head.

630
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:27,820
Not that Wii would, you know, say that, you know, but, you know.

631
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:33,740
Well I mean, Katamari on the PSP came out in March last, well was it 2005 or something?

632
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:36,860
I mean, I don't know.

633
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:43,740
I could see it coming out in spring with like a timed, exclusive, whatever, cause it's Katamari,

634
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:44,740
come on.

635
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,420
I mean, of course they're gonna put it on the Wii, it's got TILTI shit.

636
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,420
It's gimmicky.

637
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,420
People love gimmicky.

638
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,580
So, you know, it's just like the Wii and PS3.

639
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:57,180
I'm just, I'm just curious why like Namco is having like all these like, oh it's coming

640
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,940
out, oh no it's not, oh it's an exclusive, oh no it's not.

641
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:00,940
I mean.

642
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,640
Maybe they should start, you know, and this goes for all game companies.

643
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:08,180
If you don't want information put out there, you need to really be coordinating with every

644
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:11,940
single department of your company to make sure this information doesn't get out.

645
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:12,940
The right information.

646
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:17,860
Coordinate your marketing people with, you know, the web people, with the, I don't know,

647
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:18,860
ratings people.

648
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:23,020
I mean seriously, if it's on your website, people are gonna go, oh I think it's actually

649
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:26,540
coming out now because it's actually listed on your website.

650
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:29,780
And don't say, oh someone made a mistake, they weren't supposed to put that up there

651
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:30,780
yet.

652
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,780
Oops.

653
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:35,780
And don't talk about it in gag order and everybody better show them, we'll sue, we'll sue, we'll

654
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:36,780
sue.

655
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:41,100
Hey, how much you wanna bet that there may be, and this is just pure guessing, Tokyo

656
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:45,180
Game Show is, you know, right around the corner, how much you wanna bet there's an announcement

657
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,560
of some sorts.

658
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:52,700
Just like how right before E3 happened, a certain no-name website said something and,

659
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,700
you know, somebody wasn't happy about it.

660
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:55,700
Possibly.

661
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:56,700
Maybe.

662
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:01,380
Anyhow, thank you for that story on Eternal Sonata, Jamie.

663
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:05,740
In my mind, my head says yes.

664
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,420
It's never wrong.

665
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:15,140
Anyways, as we alluded to last week, that it was only a matter of time before the impenetrable

666
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:21,780
3.6 firmware of the PSP was cracked, and guess what?

667
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,980
Wait, wait, wait, wait, I wanna know why Darkstalker's laughing, are you laughing because of Loki's

668
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,980
big vocabulary?

669
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,500
Nothing.

670
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:36,180
Anyways, so Team M33 has cracked it, there is now a custom version of the firmware out

671
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,620
there that allows you to run some homebrew.

672
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:43,540
The problem is right now they can't get support for the 1.5 kernel, which, you know, before

673
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:47,940
it was able to run all the homebrew stuff, so now people are kinda having to go back,

674
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:53,860
retool things, so some things work, some things don't, eventually though, as things progress

675
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:59,820
and more firmwares come out, that they will be able to support more things.

676
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:03,500
There's a small list of stuff I think that they support some of the emulators, I don't

677
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:07,040
think the ISOs work yet, and then some other stuff.

678
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:12,340
But hopefully that means I can put homebrew onto my TV, because I did happen to go through

679
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:19,100
the process of loading it onto my PSP Slim, and let me tell you, it's not that easy, but

680
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:23,620
once you've done it, it's pretty simple, it basically involves building the Pandora's

681
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:31,280
battery, which is interesting in itself, and what you do with that is you, I guess they

682
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,980
call it extending the Pandora's battery, you basically put some parts of different firmwares

683
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:40,900
on there and then it works.

684
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,020
Once you've done the Pandora's battery, it's pretty easy, and they actually have programs

685
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:49,140
out there to make it walk you through step by step what to do, so it's pretty simple,

686
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:53,080
but definitely worth checking out, I'm sure that we're gonna see some more stuff coming

687
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,080
from that.

688
00:48:54,080 --> 00:49:03,820
Of course, Sony hearing that released 3.7 on the PSP, the firmware to break what other

689
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:09,700
people have done on 3.6, and now they have custom theme support, which I will remind

690
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:14,840
everybody has been available in the homebrew scene for quite a while now, but you can download

691
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,740
official themes, which also, by the way, can be cracked apart and put on custom.

692
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:22,420
Wait, wait, wait, I thought there's been themes on the PSP forever.

693
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:26,440
This is actually like customizing themes, you can adjust, you can put like a wallpaper

694
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:30,780
in the background and stuff like that, this is actually changing all the icons, etc.

695
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:33,420
Oh, that's interesting, okay, cool.

696
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:38,960
You can do this on custom firmwares right now, and it's been available for a long time,

697
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:45,140
but people have already found ways to crack those theme files apart, and yeah, just nothing

698
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,180
to save.

699
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:49,460
Other things have been supported, I guess, more, where you can assign buttons in remote

700
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:55,900
play, so maybe that will allow you to play lair a little bit easier on the PSP.

701
00:49:55,900 --> 00:50:01,780
I guess sequential playback is now supported under video, and simultaneous playback under,

702
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:08,560
I guess, music in photos, so you can play music while viewing your photos.

703
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:12,180
Other interesting stuff, right after this came out, I guess they had dumped that firmware,

704
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:18,260
and now there's 3.71, so it will never end, never ever.

705
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:23,980
Well, you know, I guess like Homebrew and changing little things around is one thing,

706
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:27,220
but when folks can play pirated games on there, Sony's got to do what they got to do.

707
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:31,860
Yeah, they got to do what they got to do, and they got to do it, they got to do it not

708
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:32,860
very well either.

709
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:36,420
They have to be mediocre.

710
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:37,420
Well that's fine.

711
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,420
I think you're going to be mediocre because that's it.

712
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:42,460
I applaud their mediocrity because, you know what, that allows me to have a lot more fun

713
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:43,460
with my PSP.

714
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,460
Oh my gosh, alright.

715
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:50,100
Moving on, I want to talk about Manhunt 2, because god damn, this game just cannot stay

716
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:55,300
out of the news in anticipation for its Halloween release date, I suppose.

717
00:50:55,300 --> 00:51:00,380
Well people have been asking a whole lot about how did the game come down from an AO rating

718
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,620
to an M rating?

719
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,820
What exactly was taken out of the game?

720
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:09,020
Well IGN got to take a look at what was going on with the game and what exactly was changed,

721
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:13,860
and one of their reporters is actually reporting that yes, there have been some changes.

722
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:18,220
For instance, you might remember an earlier report where the killer could use a, guys

723
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:22,660
cross your legs, the killer could use a pair of pliers to literally rip the balls off of

724
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,900
a hunter.

725
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,380
Well that scene has been taken out.

726
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,380
So damn.

727
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,380
I was looking forward to that.

728
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,780
Well that's okay.

729
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,740
Here's the thing though, one of the biggest changes that they've done is that Rockstar

730
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:41,180
has made a blur effect to some of the major death blows in the game.

731
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:45,580
So in the M rated version there's like this blur effect that goes on or the graphics get

732
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:48,980
darkened a little bit, so it's really hard to tell what's going on because it becomes

733
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:53,260
like this kind of like motion blur type thing that doesn't make it so clear.

734
00:51:53,260 --> 00:52:00,220
Well that's why they made the killing the crazy 88 scene in Kill Bill black and white

735
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:01,220
in the US.

736
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:02,220
That's true.

737
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,220
That's how censorship things happen.

738
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:06,900
So yeah, that's kind of interesting, but what, changing it to black and white made it that

739
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:07,900
much different?

740
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,340
I'm not seeing the blood as red or something.

741
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,700
I've seen it without it.

742
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:12,700
Wow.

743
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,020
It's ridiculous is all it is.

744
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:15,020
That's just like the...

745
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,860
It's people who aren't getting laid.

746
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:20,140
That's just like when they change the blood to sweat.

747
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,980
That will forever be my favorite rating thing that was done.

748
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:26,780
Let's pet someone's neck and look at how much sweat comes out.

749
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:29,740
Damn.

750
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,220
So there you have it.

751
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:35,340
Those are some of the big changes that are in the Manhunt 2.

752
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:40,020
I would still say though, I think this game is going to come out and I think the adults

753
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,660
only version will still come out on the PC later on.

754
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,300
Okay, but here's some other interesting things though.

755
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,180
Apparently they're talking about different cut scenes.

756
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:53,240
In one cut scene, a masked killer uses a power saw to slice a man's bulging belly as the

757
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,580
victim lies helpless strapped to a table.

758
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:59,900
That's okay for M, but oh my God.

759
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:04,780
If they rip off fake balls on a goddamn 3D model of somebody...

760
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:11,740
Well, I mean, that does kind of make everybody go, you know, that has them collectively go

761
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:14,460
oh, hey, oh, crush your legs.

762
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:15,460
Ow.

763
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,460
The ESRB is so hilarious.

764
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:19,060
So, well, I don't know.

765
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:22,660
I have to admit my interest on this game is kind of, you know, at first it was kind of

766
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:26,220
like, yeah, this might be kind of fun, but now I'm just like, eh.

767
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,660
I mean, it just sounds like Uber violence the game and I'm just, I'm not, you know,

768
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:33,860
I don't like those movies like Saw and stuff, so I probably won't like this game, so I don't

769
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:34,860
think I'm going to buy it.

770
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:39,220
Unless, I mean, unless it gets incredible reviews and there's something about the game

771
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:42,020
I just have to see, I'm not really in it for the, you know...

772
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:45,580
I'm kind of interested in the Wii murdering of people.

773
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:49,780
That is interesting, but not, I don't know, I'll just go to your house and play it, man.

774
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:54,380
To be very honest, there's not a lot of Wii games out there that I want to buy right now

775
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,700
and unfortunately that's the next one in line.

776
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,740
It's not necessarily that I want to go around murdering people with the Wii remotes, even

777
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:04,340
though I do find humor in that, but I don't know.

778
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:08,980
Now RossdielUT in our chatroom says, Manhunt 2, a trash game selling on controversy alone.

779
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,280
Sad, sad thing.

780
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,540
And I sort of agree, except I don't want to pass the game off as trash without having

781
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:18,220
actually gotten to play it, but, you know, I will definitely kind of want to look at

782
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,580
reviews and things.

783
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:23,580
You know, this game certainly doesn't stay in the news for its incredible innovations

784
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,720
that it's bringing to the gaming scene.

785
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,440
I'll give you that, but look at Hostel.

786
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,840
There's a perfect example.

787
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:33,300
There's another movie that's probably trash that's selling on controversy alone.

788
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:38,100
I won't say that the game won't sell, I'm just saying I don't care.

789
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:41,940
So I didn't watch Hostel either, because I heard it was...

790
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:42,940
I have no interest in those.

791
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:43,940
I know, I know.

792
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:47,980
Like, no, it's just weird, like sometimes I will watch the very gory movies, like The

793
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:51,100
Descent was pretty gory and I loved it, but it was like...

794
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,100
That's more suspense though, isn't it?

795
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,980
Yeah, it was way, like, more, just the way it was directed over the years, it was scary.

796
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:59,700
That's one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, The Descent.

797
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:00,700
Anyway.

798
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:07,580
Well, for other news though, regarding Manhunt 2, people were interviewed to see whether

799
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:14,980
or not they would be interested in buying it and there were only 18% of the people polled

800
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:18,660
who said they were going to buy it when it launches on Halloween.

801
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:25,020
52% said, no, and 30% said, uh, what?

802
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:27,540
That many people clicked a button that said, uh, what?

803
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:28,540
And decided.

804
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:30,540
Oh, okay.

805
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:37,660
That's, well, so, so apparently only 18% of the, that's still, I don't know, I mean, 18%

806
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:43,820
to me kind of seems like a large chunk of the gaming community, I mean, if you can sell

807
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:47,300
out of one to every five people that own a Wii this game, that's still quite a lot of

808
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:52,180
copies moved, so I don't think it's as bad as they're saying, but I think a good, a better

809
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:59,100
question would be, were you planning to buy the adult only one and now you're not going

810
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,100
to anymore?

811
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:01,100
Exactly.

812
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,100
I'm kind of curious to see what the result is of that one.

813
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:05,820
At the end of the day though, it doesn't really matter to, like, any of the console makers,

814
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:13,060
it really just fucks over Take-Two again and Rockstar, so, oh well, stop making such violent

815
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,060
games.

816
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:18,460
Yeah, but, oh well, I guess we'll see, I mean, again, it all really depends on the reviews

817
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:19,460
for me.

818
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:22,100
Release it on PC, un-rated, there you go.

819
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:24,180
We'll see.

820
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,180
You will see.

821
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:32,340
Anyways, um, oops, I knocked the ferret on the floor, um, good, I hope it died.

822
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:38,380
If you happen to be a stupid kid trying to buy games at GameStop, well, there might be

823
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:43,700
one particular GameStop in South Dallas that won't be selling you games.

824
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:49,360
In fact, he's breaking corporate policy and he refuses to sell games to school kids who

825
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:54,460
can't prove that they're doing well in school and apparently the manager is Brandon Scott

826
00:56:54,460 --> 00:57:01,780
and he makes sure that an adult can verify that the child is getting good grades, otherwise

827
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,820
he won't sell them a game.

828
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:04,820
Any game.

829
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:05,820
Ever.

830
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:10,620
So, um, he says, I'm probably going to get in the trouble for this, but to me it's worth

831
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:13,940
it because the kids understand that somebody cares.

832
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:15,540
You know who doesn't care?

833
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:18,460
Probably GameStop corporate and you're going to get fired.

834
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:19,660
Congratulations.

835
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:24,780
You know, I'm very tempted, like, there's a, you know, the part of me that is very like,

836
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:28,500
you know, aha, people get what they deserve, aha, wants to kind of applaud what this guy

837
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:33,220
is doing, but when I really kind of sit there and think about it, I go like, you know, this

838
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,780
is kind of screwed up.

839
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:35,780
It is screwed up.

840
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:39,740
I mean, I think it should be up to the parents what the kids get, period.

841
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:41,060
Now, now, period.

842
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:45,900
I don't have a problem with him deciding to do that, if he owned his own game store, but

843
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:50,500
he doesn't and so he's, you know, I think it's a great idea that you shouldn't sell

844
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:54,780
games to kids that are stupid, but, you know, there's a lot of reasons not to sell games,

845
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:55,780
you know, to certain kids.

846
00:57:55,780 --> 00:58:01,180
Hell, I was at a, a playing trade this week and I was looking at, they were doing their

847
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:07,540
grand opening and there was a kid, no parents watching him, kid, couldn't have been like

848
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:11,660
10, 11 years old playing Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

849
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:12,660
Just sitting there playing.

850
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:17,760
He's like, I just killed a hooker, you know, it's like, come on people and then you're

851
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,380
bitching about, oh, I didn't know Billy was playing such a violent game.

852
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:24,380
You may, you need the one, parents are stupid.

853
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:27,940
Don't let a GameStop type store babysit your children then.

854
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:31,860
What you need to do though, I mean, I applaud him for making that decision.

855
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:37,020
I mean, granted, it's probably going to be great for the store, but, you know, once that

856
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,860
off his conscience, great.

857
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,180
He's not going to be able to do it though.

858
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:44,500
I think at a GameStop and I'm afraid that, you know, once this news gets back to them

859
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,740
that these can probably be fired.

860
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:48,580
Let's go to the chat because the chat has some follow up here.

861
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:53,760
I've got a GS68 in our chat room that says good grades does not equal good behavior.

862
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:58,860
You know, that's, you know, there are a lot of kids there who weren't necessarily motivated.

863
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:01,660
They might be good kids, they're just not motivated to get good grades.

864
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,940
Whatever happened to me my senior year of high school.

865
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:08,820
I was in school and stuff and if I would get good grades, my parents would reward me by

866
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:10,060
buying me something, you know.

867
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:13,940
That was kind of my thing too is that my parents did what this guy did.

868
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:16,200
If I got good grades, I got stuff.

869
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:21,860
If I didn't get good grades, I got, you know, locked in a cellar.

870
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:22,860
So but...

871
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:25,020
And silly Bob, you don't have a cellar.

872
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:28,940
I had to live in the closet under the stairs like Harry Potter.

873
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:33,780
The kids, if they can't buy their games from GameStop or whatever, they'll just go somewhere

874
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:34,780
else.

875
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:38,460
You don't, you're not the only fucking game store on the planet, you moron.

876
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:39,460
I mean people...

877
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:42,620
Well, Rama wants to say Loki, he was suspended.

878
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,620
Way to go!

879
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:45,620
That's what you get for doing good things.

880
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:48,900
Dark Tetsuya says, well the adult should be there to buy the game anyway.

881
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:49,900
Exactly.

882
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:58,460
And Frisbee in their best Maury Povich impression says, you are not the father.

883
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:59,460
Get it?

884
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:00,460
Because the guy is not the father?

885
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:01,460
GameStop.

886
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:04,300
I don't even know if that was supposed to be an Maury Povich impression, I just felt

887
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,300
like saying it.

888
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:08,620
GameStop, you are not the father.

889
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:10,740
You are not the father.

890
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,900
Not the mama.

891
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,940
Yes, old school.

892
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:18,540
Escapist says, I've had eight year olds in my stores talking about how awesome Grand

893
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:19,860
Theft Auto was too.

894
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:22,140
But I wonder if a lot of that is hype.

895
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:24,780
Like you gotta wonder how many of those kids actually played the game.

896
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:27,700
Like sometimes, I mean, obviously there's some screwed up kids like, you know, the one

897
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,340
Loki was talking about earlier playing the game.

898
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:32,700
But you gotta wonder, like sometimes eight year olds are just full of talk.

899
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:33,700
You know what I mean?

900
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:36,700
Like none of them have probably played the game, but they hear their brother talking

901
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,140
about it or something like that.

902
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,140
I don't know.

903
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:44,260
It's a whole little tangent we'll say for another day.

904
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:45,540
That's poop-tastic.

905
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:48,900
But for today, I will get to another story.

906
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:52,740
If you don't want to buy your games at GameStop anymore in this, what was it, South Dallas

907
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:53,740
you said?

908
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:54,740
South Dallas.

909
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:57,100
So, well maybe you can go to Radio Shack now.

910
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:01,420
Because even though some Radio Shack stores have been carrying games for a while, apparently

911
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:06,660
Radio Shack as a corporation will now start actually carrying more video games in a couple

912
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:08,660
weeks.

913
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:11,700
Weren't they doing a Halo 3 pre-sale there, I think?

914
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,700
Probably a lot of stores were.

915
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:13,700
I don't know.

916
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:14,700
Who isn't?

917
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,620
I'm doing a Halo 3 pre-sale.

918
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:19,300
You know Walmarts are staying open until midnight and everything.

919
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,300
I don't know.

920
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,300
It's a little bit exciting.

921
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,300
Isn't that it?

922
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,300
And the Halo 3's release is what?

923
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,300
Isn't it like next Friday?

924
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:28,620
I unfortunately was over at GameStop quite a bit this week, just for different reasons,

925
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:30,620
buying systems.

926
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:36,300
But they had a sign in their door that said that the line starts at 9pm the night before

927
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,300
for Halo.

928
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:38,300
Geez.

929
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,300
Hooray!

930
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:40,300
What day does Halo come out?

931
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,300
I forget.

932
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,300
25th.

933
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:43,300
25th?

934
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:44,300
Oh, so it's next Tuesday.

935
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,060
So, I cannot wait for it to be over.

936
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:47,700
I really cannot.

937
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:51,660
Well, unfortunately what is not clear at this time, don't know if it's going to be, you

938
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:55,260
know, like they're going to turn the whole store into games like GameStop EV.

939
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,420
Probably not.

940
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:59,740
But I can see that they'll probably have a little corner of the store dedicated to video

941
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:00,740
games.

942
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:01,740
I mean, why not?

943
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:03,620
Because they sell a lot of the, you know, accessories and things anyway.

944
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:07,300
So, and they sell other types of gaming things, you know.

945
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:10,740
But you know what Radio Shack sells that's awesome that I used to have when I was a kid?

946
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:11,740
Total tangent.

947
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:12,740
RC cars.

948
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:16,940
That and you know those little things that were like, build 300 electronic devices in

949
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:17,940
one.

950
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:20,260
And it had like the little springs and you could attach the wires to the springs and

951
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:23,180
build all these little devices, like they're different types of transits.

952
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:27,580
Like you could build a little amateur radio or you could build a little light switch.

953
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:28,580
Like all these dumb little things.

954
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:29,580
I was learning about electronics.

955
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:30,580
Yeah.

956
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,580
It was all kinds of cool.

957
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:33,580
I got one at a garage sale years ago and I loved it.

958
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:34,580
I hate Radio Shack.

959
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:38,140
They're so damn expensive when it comes to anything like component wise.

960
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:44,500
You're buying video cables, audio cables, you're better off somewhere else, seriously.

961
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:48,420
I go to Radio Shack to buy lithium batteries and that's about it.

962
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:49,500
There's cables.

963
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,340
I have a lot of AV cable needs.

964
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:52,340
And I bought a microphone there before.

965
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:53,340
Yeah, a microphone.

966
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:54,340
Oh, I think our microphones.

967
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:55,340
Our old microphones were.

968
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:56,860
No, yeah, the old ones were.

969
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:58,860
These are the newer ones from the guitar place, right?

970
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:03,260
The one I used at my what to do pump up the volume for the longest time was Radio Shack.

971
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:09,260
I was going to go to GameStop to buy some stuff for our setup at work for the LAN stuff,

972
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:12,940
like some headsets and audio cables.

973
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:15,140
It was going to cost me $80 to buy it there.

974
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:21,180
I ended up shopping this place that my co-workers recommended, cablewholesale.com.

975
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:24,380
I would say it was $15 instead of $80.

976
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:28,820
So just so you know, don't shop there.

977
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:29,820
So here's my question.

978
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:33,360
Remember when the Wii launched, we went out and we gave orange soda to people and cookies

979
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,360
and stuff?

980
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:35,360
What should we do for the Halo 3 launch?

981
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,580
Should we go out on Monday night and do something for the kids in line?

982
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:38,580
Give them crack.

983
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:39,580
There's some difference.

984
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:40,580
I don't want to go out on a Monday night.

985
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:41,580
Loki's like, I'm tired.

986
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:42,580
I am all.

987
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:43,580
Let me sleep.

988
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:44,580
Fuck this.

989
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:45,580
I don't want to talk to Halo.

990
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:48,100
I mean, I guess you could bring him the Game Fuel shit.

991
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,160
I really don't want to talk to Halo fans.

992
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,140
What about the journalist in you, Loki?

993
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:54,500
Doesn't the journalist in you want to go out there and talk to the people?

994
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,860
I despise Halo 3 right now.

995
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:58,500
Just, I don't know, retail sampling.

996
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,500
That's your personal vendetta.

997
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:02,540
That is my personal vendetta.

998
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:03,860
I don't see the point.

999
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:05,860
All right, well, we'll see.

1000
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:09,020
I like the idea of going out and giving him Game Fuel.

1001
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:10,500
Maybe we'll see about that.

1002
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,860
Ah, Game Fuel.

1003
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:12,860
All right.

1004
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:15,060
Ah, here's a little fuel for you guys.

1005
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:18,940
It's a new website that you should be pointing your browsers to this week because, of course,

1006
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:22,740
the one and only DarkSakura surfs the internet up and down and all around every week and

1007
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:26,460
finds one website worthy of sharing with you all.

1008
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:30,820
It's DarkSakura's website of the week, and she's going to tell you what it is right now.

1009
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:31,820
Do it.

1010
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:32,820
Right now.

1011
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:33,820
No.

1012
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:34,820
Yes.

1013
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:35,820
I refuse.

1014
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:41,580
Okay, my website of the week is actually DeviantArt again because, um, I'm going to plug a bunch

1015
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:46,860
of people's DeviantArt sites like mine.

1016
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:51,300
So deviantart.com, and for those that maybe haven't heard this before, what is DeviantArt?

1017
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:55,500
You go and put your art and whore yourself out for comments and page views.

1018
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:58,380
Why am I doing DeviantArt?

1019
01:04:58,380 --> 01:04:59,380
You know what?

1020
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:00,380
I'm not going to do DeviantArt.

1021
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:05,500
I'm going to do darksakura.com, the site I haven't updated in five years.

1022
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:09,860
You know, I'm thinking maybe when we would do the transitions, we should give you a new

1023
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:12,580
thing instead of the website of the week because you're running out of sites.

1024
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:16,260
I am, oh my god, because I'm going to the same ones every week now.

1025
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:18,100
Well here, I have an idea for you.

1026
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,100
What?

1027
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:21,740
Is that maybe starting episode 250, if you can find just like a couple more sites, take

1028
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:25,100
us over 250, we'll have DarkSakura's classic game of the week.

1029
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:26,780
I would totally love to do that.

1030
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:28,660
Because you know some obscure fucking shit.

1031
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:29,660
I do.

1032
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:30,660
Alright.

1033
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:34,500
I mean, we just had here last week having a conversation about Neutopia.

1034
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:35,500
Yeah.

1035
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:39,460
So, we're going to have, so coming soon, DarkSakura's website of the week will be replaced with

1036
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:41,220
DarkSakura's classic game of the week.

1037
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:42,220
That'll be fun.

1038
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:43,220
It'll be obscureshit.com.

1039
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:45,420
I wonder if that's a site.

1040
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:49,260
RossDielUT says, Loki only hates Halo 3 because it's popular.

1041
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:51,620
No, I don't hate Halo 3 because it's popular.

1042
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:55,660
I hate it because all my customers are complaining, when am I going to get Halo 3, and you really

1043
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:59,360
need it on a street date because it's going to, you know, really, it's going to suck if

1044
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,360
we don't have it.

1045
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,360
When's it coming in?

1046
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,580
When's it coming in?

1047
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:07,460
I hate, I hated when even the Wii came out because it was a pain in the ass and we knew

1048
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:10,180
we couldn't get them on time and all that stuff.

1049
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:14,140
Halo 3, everybody wants this damn thing and they're all coming out of the woodwork and

1050
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:18,740
all complaining that they're, they need it like five days early and stuff and you're

1051
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:23,140
like, yeah, you're not going to be selling it early or anything.

1052
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:26,980
I just, I hate games that are going to be just that popular.

1053
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:30,700
Grand Theft Auto 4, when it comes out, I'm going to hate that too.

1054
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:34,700
Except I love Grand Theft Auto 4, but I am still going to hate the whole selling of Grand

1055
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,740
Theft Auto 4.

1056
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:40,100
Dark Tetsuya in our chat room thinks that for the next couple weeks, well before we

1057
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:45,580
transition in episode 250 to, you know, changing some things up, thinks that your website of

1058
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:51,060
the week should be like Google.com or Yahoo.com.

1059
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:59,460
Actually if you type in Goggle.com because I typoed it once, it takes you to porn.

1060
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:04,300
I used to use Hotbot as my search engine back in the day and you could, you know, totally

1061
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:06,140
typo that to Hotbot.

1062
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:08,520
There's a website, speaking of Google, I read about.

1063
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:09,520
Here we go again, tangents.

1064
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,820
Somebody said in chat I was the king of tangents.

1065
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:12,820
Here we go.

1066
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:16,860
I was listening to the real radio of all things, driving to work one morning and I heard somebody

1067
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:19,380
talking about Blackle.

1068
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:24,740
It's a black version of Google where it's just, it's black instead of white.

1069
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,060
There's a goth one too.

1070
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:31,860
But the, well the reason behind it is because they say that if more people used websites

1071
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:36,760
that had black backgrounds, then that will actually save on energy.

1072
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,940
So it's this whole like, you know, hippie thing, you know.

1073
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:41,900
Stupid tree huggers need to go away.

1074
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:47,020
Leave the internet alone and go hug a tree.

1075
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:49,620
Okay.

1076
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:54,760
Escapist says Halo 3 will end with Bob Newhart waking up in bed discovering the whole war

1077
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:55,760
was a dream.

1078
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,700
And JVMon's jumping up and down saying you win the internet.

1079
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:01,020
That was a pretty great ending to our show.

1080
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:03,940
I have a, okay I actually have a website.

1081
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:16,020
And I have to blame, I have to blame, hold on a second let me get, I have to blame JVMon

1082
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:18,060
for this one because it's awful.

1083
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:20,300
It made my heart cry.

1084
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:25,140
This is my website of the week not to go to ever, ever.

1085
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:28,420
It's insulting and horrible and you don't want to go there ever.

1086
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:29,420
This is fun.

1087
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:30,420
The anti website of the week.

1088
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:41,260
It's captain-jack.de slash 2008 slash cj.html, a new Captain Jack and it makes my heart

1089
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:42,260
hurt.

1090
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:43,260
Oh, I want to see a new Captain Jack.

1091
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:46,380
And his, his girl that's with him is vacant.

1092
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:48,420
Hey, I like the new Captain Jack.

1093
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:49,420
I can deal with this.

1094
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:53,420
Wait, like, oh, I thought, wait, hold on, I thought this was another Doctor Who thing.

1095
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:54,540
No, this sucks.

1096
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:59,380
Like the Captain Jack, the go, let go, let go, let go, that Captain Jack, they replaced

1097
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:00,380
him?

1098
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:01,380
No way.

1099
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:02,380
I know.

1100
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:03,380
Unless it's, unless that's his son.

1101
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,380
If it's his son, I forgive them.

1102
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:06,380
Give me a, no it's not.

1103
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:07,980
If it's not, I don't forgive them.

1104
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:08,980
How dare they?

1105
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:09,980
No, check this out.

1106
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:10,980
This is awful.

1107
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,540
Let me turn up my volume.

1108
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:15,620
Can you, wait, can you give me the website one more time because I'll play it on here

1109
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:16,620
so the listeners can hear.

1110
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:28,060
It's captain-jack.de slash 2008 slash cj.html.

1111
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:34,180
Captain-jack.de slash 2008, this is great radio, slash cj.html.

1112
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:35,180
Yes.

1113
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:37,180
Okay, I think I got it.

1114
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:38,180
Hurts my heart.

1115
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:39,180
All right, here we go.

1116
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:40,180
The site is loading.

1117
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:47,460
All right, we welcome, we proudly present the one and only Captain Jack, screw you.

1118
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:49,260
There will only be one Captain Jack.

1119
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:54,060
Oh, Lord, this sounds horrible already.

1120
01:09:54,060 --> 01:10:13,500
This is bad, I've got to stop it, besides we don't want to play one.

1121
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,380
Captain Jack, you are not.

1122
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:16,380
Wow.

1123
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:22,300
Oh, JV Mon says his son came out as Captain Jack Jr.

1124
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,540
Interesting.

1125
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:26,620
Is that like James Bond Jr.?

1126
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:27,620
Interesting.

1127
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:28,620
All right.

1128
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:31,880
I like how his glasses on the website, you can totally see the film crew.

1129
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:32,880
Way to go, people.

1130
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:37,300
All right, and I'd like to cordially thank JV Mon for ruining tonight's program.

1131
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:38,300
Thank you, JV Mon.

1132
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:39,980
Let's get back to some gaming news.

1133
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:42,380
Please try to save what little dignity we have left on the show.

1134
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:44,900
What dignity do we have?

1135
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:51,780
Anywho, so as I mentioned a little bit earlier, that there is going to be some pretty cool

1136
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:59,100
stuff coming out for Xbox Live Arcade, including which is Omega 5, a shooter that's going to

1137
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:00,100
be coming out.

1138
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:02,900
It should be pretty sweet, actually.

1139
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:08,940
It's more of like a traditional, crazy, tons of bullets, all over the place shooter game,

1140
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:14,720
so hopefully it'll be as cool as I think it is.

1141
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,460
Hopefully it's cool as you make it out to be.

1142
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:21,340
Well, unfortunately, the link that I had on here was the wrong story, so that's based

1143
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:22,340
off memory.

1144
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:23,340
My bad.

1145
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:26,380
Oh, we linked the wrong story in the show, though.

1146
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:27,380
My bad.

1147
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:29,980
No, but anyways, it is going to be pretty cool.

1148
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:33,420
I think it's Mizuguchi anyways, if I remember correctly.

1149
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:37,060
Well, then I'll read the story that Loki got linked to instead.

1150
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:42,300
It's about Sega, as shown what they're going to be showing off at Tokyo Game Show next

1151
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,300
week.

1152
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:47,220
They got a whole lot of stuff they're showing off on the PlayStation 3, titles such as Sega

1153
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:51,460
Rally, Valkyrie of the Battlefield, and a game based off the Golden Compass, which I

1154
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:53,820
imagine is based on the movie.

1155
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:58,780
Wii is showing off Night's Journey into Dreams, Ghost Squad, another version of the Golden

1156
01:11:58,780 --> 01:11:59,780
Compass.

1157
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:04,980
Sega Rally on the Xbox 360, that's it, but remember this is a Tokyo Game Show, and unfortunately

1158
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:07,340
the Xbox 360 is not doing as well over there.

1159
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:12,500
I think that's all they had over on the 360 from Sega, other than Golden Compass, I'd

1160
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:13,500
imagine.

1161
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,340
They are showing an expansion for Phantasy Star Universe on the PlayStation 2, though,

1162
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:19,420
which makes me wonder, it must not be coming out on the 360, but did the game come out

1163
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:20,420
on the Xbox?

1164
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:24,060
It is coming out over here, but I think the expansion will probably be a download, just

1165
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:25,060
like, you know.

1166
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:26,260
Oh, maybe that's what it is.

1167
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:29,620
Okay, well they are showing Phantasy Star Universe Ambition of the Illuminous on PlayStation

1168
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:31,020
2, at least.

1169
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:35,820
I'm sure our resident PSU guy, Dark Knight, knows more about this.

1170
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:39,660
Nintendo DS is getting some other games, though, lots of stuff showing on the DS.

1171
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:45,900
Sonic Rush Adventure, Bleach the Third Phantom, Picto Image DS, another version of the Golden

1172
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:49,740
Compass, which, by the way, will also be on PSP, and a game that I like, this is called

1173
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:57,900
Dream Cat Smile DS, rad, that PSU expansion pack also coming to the PC, rad.

1174
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,720
And Escapists in Chat says, no new Jet Set Radio yet?

1175
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:01,720
My heart is breaking.

1176
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:02,720
I agree.

1177
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:03,720
I agree.

1178
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:04,720
C-Man 2.

1179
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:05,720
C-Man 2?

1180
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:06,720
Yeah.

1181
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:09,860
I don't know so much about that.

1182
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:10,860
You know what?

1183
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:14,100
I wouldn't mind having a C-Man 2, because I thought it was great that the whole thing

1184
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:18,660
was narrated by Leonard Nimoy.

1185
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:23,060
So let me, if I can get this right, here, Dark Sakura, you're saying you want C-Man

1186
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:24,060
2.

1187
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:30,780
I got a ferret thrown at me, thank god the webcam's off.

1188
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:32,460
Yeah, this is horrible radio.

1189
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:33,460
Ferret!

1190
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:34,460
No.

1191
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:35,460
When you read the story, I'll get back the ferret.

1192
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:38,260
EA could be it.

1193
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:39,260
Okay.

1194
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:45,460
Anyway, EA is finally entering the world of survival horror by giving us a game called

1195
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:47,420
Dead Space.

1196
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:50,820
You get zombies hidden in fun places.

1197
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:54,540
We won't say where they are, but they are somewhere.

1198
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:58,860
And it's like, supposed to be like some, I guess, zombie game set in outer space, from

1199
01:13:58,860 --> 01:13:59,860
what I understand.

1200
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:01,900
It's like Event Horizon, I think they said.

1201
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:05,620
Oh, and you have tentacles in it, so that's okay.

1202
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:07,020
Yay, tentacles!

1203
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:08,660
Kids love tentacles!

1204
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:10,480
Tentacle porn?

1205
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,480
Had to be said, kids.

1206
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:16,100
Hey, well, I was at Fry's last night and there was a copy of the live-action Love Blue Girls

1207
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:17,260
just sitting out.

1208
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:19,340
That is the worst movie I've ever seen.

1209
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:20,340
It is!

1210
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:21,340
That's the most awful, funny thing ever.

1211
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:24,380
Vacuum cleaner tubes do not make tentacles.

1212
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:29,020
I need to put that on top of my Netflix queue.

1213
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:31,740
Just download it like everybody else.

1214
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:35,020
Then I'm done.

1215
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:39,740
Alright, well, that's going to do it for this Part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but we'll be
