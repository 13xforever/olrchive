0	20720	Tonight, September 23rd, 2007, a highly anticipated Wii game is going online, Sony goes back to
20720	31680	good vibrations, and have we finally figured out what the game Africa is all about?
31680	35440	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
35440	41040	Radio. We are that video game program dedicated to video games, gaming, gamer culture, the
41040	46480	gamer lifestyle, and boobs, right Dark Sakura? Yes, I have some. Alright, congratulations.
46480	50600	Thank you, I'll tell my mom. Alright, yes please tell her about the show you do on the
50600	53880	internet where we talked about your boobs tonight. I'm sure she'll really appreciate
53880	59400	that. You've called her. I know, that was an old OLR stunt, that was old news. That
59400	63920	was yesterday's news. Let's not call my mom today, okay? Alright, probably not. Also joining
63920	69360	us, the man with no boobs, and that's a good thing, Loki. Hello. How you doing, Loki? Fine.
69360	73240	Awesome. And it's just the three of us here in studio tonight, just feeling the love between
73240	77360	the three of us since there's no guests to speak of tonight. Miklotov sadly moved back
77360	80560	to Kansas so he's not going to be on the show for a long time. He might be back in December
80560	85040	for a little bit but we won't have him on for a while. Trying to get our friend Casper
85040	88960	the Gay back on a future episode but, you know, we have to be careful because you have
88960	93480	too much of him on the show at once. The show might just combust. So, sometimes it's good
93480	99160	to just have the three of us and you guys in the chat room over at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
99160	102840	Folks in the chat room there. I see some new faces in chat tonight. Welcome everybody in
102840	106280	the chat room. Really appreciate you guys tuning in live here on this Sunday night.
106280	109960	Alright, let's start off the show. Enough chit chat. How was your gaming week? Dark
109960	115280	Sakura, how was your gaming week? Um, I started playing a game again. One that I played for
115280	119200	a very, very, very, very, very long time. Ooh, did you get into Final Fantasy XI again
119200	126080	too? Fuck no. I'm playing Ragnarok Online again. Heal please. Oh, what are you playing?
126080	129040	Because you were a white mage in Final Fantasy XI. So, what are you playing as in Ragnarok
129040	135080	now? Well, I started off with a ninja and they kind of suck. So, I went back to my old
135080	146920	standby of Assassin and, um, right now I am at level 79-47 I think. Uh huh. 79 base, 47
146920	152380	job. Sheesh. Assassin. Well, it's a 50-50-50 server. I haven't played Ragnarok in a long
152380	156640	time so I kind of forget what that means, but it just sounds like borderline addict.
156640	162140	Well, um, the whole thing about it is that it's very, um, it's pretty quick leveling
162140	167760	the way that they've got the ratio set up with lots and lots of loot. Wait a minute.
167760	171480	You said you're playing on a server that's 50-50-50? Yeah. Gravity's going to come in
171480	176920	and say, we ban you! Fuck Gravity. They can't. They're playing on a 50-50 server. They can't
176920	181040	do anything. And besides that, I can go back to IRO anytime I want to because I was in
181040	186080	the beta and they don't delete the beta characters. Oh, that's good. So, my characters are still
186080	195040	sitting there. And to tell DJ Dark Knight, the Ninja class I haven't quite figured out
195040	201520	just because I haven't found any good FAQs in English. And Dark Knight's comment for
201520	207040	the record was, Ninjas don't suck, Jamie. It's 50-50-50, by the way. And what does 50-50-50
207040	213520	mean? Meaning that it's a higher ratio for leveling. You get more experience, more loot.
213520	220480	It's more, okay, it's more experience for base level, for job level, and for your loot.
220480	226640	It's drop rate. So, um, it means you get a whole bunch of crap. And like, I was already
226640	234440	over 400,000 zenny for money, like, in two days. So, and the thing is that I just don't
234440	238660	like play and play and play and play. I play and then sit and do other stuff while I'm
238660	242480	talking to people and then go, oh, I'm still logged into Ragnarok and play some more. And
242480	247320	then go, okay, I'm bored, sit, and then go do other stuff. So, because it's windowed
247320	252080	and really easy, I can just leave it running. And the server's really nice. I'm playing
252080	258520	on Deliverance Online, if anyone. Windowed MMOs for the win. Windows, yes. I am going
258520	263120	to be quitting World of Warcraft until such a day that I have a PC that works that will
263120	269840	run it. I'm going to be playing Guild Wars instead, because thanks to Plan C, I only
269840	276240	took them like, I'd have to say four business days, I think, that they got me my, um, my
276240	281160	key restored. So nice. And they, they email it right to you. Everything's cool. So I'm
281160	287160	gonna go, uh, it's really cool. Instead of just being all like, oh, fuck you, your key's
287160	292520	broken. You lose. They will actually, if you, if you send them a high quality enough image,
292520	299080	they will, um, decipher what your key is. Wow. And, um, give, give you whatever your
299080	303120	key was. They'll base it off of the one that you were given. Dang. So their customer service
303120	306240	is really good then, huh? Oh yeah. I wouldn't think that they, I would think most companies
306240	312600	would tell you too bad, so sad. They're really on the ball. Wow. Really on the ball. And
312600	319720	I also, um, we got stuff. Dan came back from the Game Crazy Manager Conference. So I'm
319720	324600	getting a free Halo 3. I'm getting a free Heavenly Sword, which I want to play. I'm
324600	327760	looking forward to it. We got a copy of Jean Dark already, which I'm going to be playing
327760	333760	through. Um, he got some other games. We're supposed to be getting Mass Effect. He said
333760	338760	that it looked really, really, really sweet. Yeah, I'm, I'm looking forward to that too.
338760	344240	And then, um, he got to play, uh, uh, Dracula X Collection and he thought it was really
344240	348440	cool. Um, I actually watched a bunch of videos from Tokyo Game Show. Um, not from Tokyo Game
348440	353040	Show, but, um, well, from Tokyo Game Show, I watched the, the Knights demo, but I was
353040	359000	watching the, um, the footage from, uh, uh, Rondo of Blood and it looked really, really,
359000	363400	really good. I think I'm going to be very impressed with it. And, um, we got a whole
363400	369120	bunch of t-shirts that we don't want and we're getting a, uh, Wii Zapper and we already,
369120	373520	he came home with a Wii Sword. So rub it in with all this free shit you're getting. I'm,
373520	378920	uh, looking in chat, some folks, uh, dissing Heavenly Sword in chat. Fildos. I don't care.
378920	382640	I'm playing it anyway. I like that name, by the way. Fildos says, I beat Heavenly Sword
382640	387440	in five minutes and Mikosense says Heavenly Sword in all that great. I don't care. It's
387440	392060	free and I'm playing it. It does look pretty. Pretty things are good. Like I said, it's
392060	396240	free and I'm playing it. There you go. All right. Uh, let's go over to Loki. Loki, how
396240	401920	was your gaming week? Uh, my week was a little busy. Um, let's see. Of course at work I've
401920	405880	been playing more Saints Row multiplayer. Now we're doing all Rocket matches, which
405880	412320	are pretty fun. Um, then of course, you know, the big one, um, I got Halo 3 early and you're
412320	418680	breaking stuff. Sorry. Um, so I actually have already finished the game. Um, it's kind of
418680	425480	short. Reminds me, see now I never really played, I mean I played Halo once or twice
425480	430680	and I've played Halo 2 maybe once or twice, but never through the entire story mode. So
430680	436620	I think most of the story and the ending stuff is pretty lost to me as far as, uh, the impact
436620	443360	I guess. But, um, I don't know. It was good. It reminds me a lot of Resistance. I mean
443360	450360	there's a lot of parallels between this game and that one. So, I don't know. How so? Well,
450360	454640	I don't want to give away too much. I mean, I don't know, I mean if anyone's actually
454640	458720	heard anything about the game, you know, there's a race called the Flood and they remind me
458720	466360	a lot of the race of creatures that you fight in Resistance. Um, I don't know. The game
466360	471680	itself is pretty good. I liked it. Um, the multiplayer is pretty fun. I can't wait to
471680	477680	play more of that. And then co-op I really want to give a try to some of that. Overall
477680	483120	it's pretty good. Definitely not the best game this year. Definitely not the best looking
483120	488400	game this year, but I don't think you really need to have the best graphics to make great
488400	492800	games. So, it should be good. And I know that Bungie supports their games pretty well, so
492800	498720	I can't wait to see what they do with the rest of it. Um, then the last game, well actually
498720	503880	there's a few others. I played Brain Age 2. I bought that for Nelly and I don't like that
503880	510320	game. I don't like that game because, why? The text recognition and the voice recognition
510320	514560	are horrible. They're absolutely horrible. Like there's a part where you're having to
514560	518040	yell out, you know, rock, paper, scissor and you're playing that and you either have to
518040	526400	win or lose. And it did not understand scissor. I had to like go, scissor, scissor, scissor.
526400	530920	And it finally is like, oh, okay you got it. Or it'll just say you got it wrong. And then
530920	536400	there's another one, it was addition, where you had to like insert the, um, the operative
536400	540600	for a math problem. So, you know, I'd draw a plus or something and it would think it's
540600	544520	a multiplication, like an X or something. I'm like, that does not look like an X at
544520	549520	all. Or there's another one that wanted me to spell out stuff, um, to like create a word
549520	554520	and I was trying to draw a B. And I mean, it looks like a B and it thinks I'm drawing
554520	559640	like a D or like something else. It can't recognize my handwriting. You know, so it
559640	564860	gives me a really crappy, you know, time on it because it's stupid. So, I don't know.
564860	570440	It's really frustrating. Luckily, I didn't buy it for me, so that's all good. Um, then
570440	576760	the last game I played was Rock Band. I actually went out to, um, Sacramento today to check
576760	579080	out the Rock Band. They're doing that mobile tour thing.
579080	585740	I knew I forgot to do something this weekend. And, um, so it was interesting. Um, there's
585740	591200	actually hardly anyone there. I mean, they had enough stations for about, I would say
591200	595440	twenty people to play at once. They had like five different setups, so it was pretty easy
595440	601200	to get in there. Um, the problem I had, and hopefully this is not reflecting the final
601200	606560	product is, that guitar, man, there was some issues with that strum bar. It just was not
606560	612880	working at all. I mean, I failed two songs on easy. And I mean, I'm not great. You know,
612880	618000	I can do the three keys fine, but this thing was not hitting right at all. And they were
618000	622480	like, well, I don't know if it's the humidity or what. And it wasn't very humid out. But
622480	626080	I'm like, there's like barely any humidity in California, people.
626080	628920	The humidity or whatever, but pushing down the strum bar doesn't work. You gotta pull
628920	635920	up sometimes, because the down will stop working. I'm like, okay. So, you know, pulling up worked
635920	640800	fine, and we ended up playing Tom Sawyer, and that was okay. Um, the game itself looks
640800	646360	exactly like Guitar Hero. I mean, if you've seen Guitar Hero and you've seen Kariok Hero
646360	651120	Evolution, it's just those two games combined. It's not a big surprise. The drums look kind
651120	656360	of neat. The way they had them set up, though, they were very low to the ground. But it worked
656360	659480	for whoever was playing drums. I ended up playing the bass guitar, because that was
659480	665720	all that was left. And I do like the buttons on it. They have buttons towards the top and
665720	670040	of course towards the bottom for like, I guess, solo stuff. I never really figured out, because
670040	674740	you can use the bottom buttons the entire game. And I guess you use them also when you're
674740	681740	doing the finale part. Other than that, there's a little effector thing there. You can switch
681960	686680	between like five different effects, including like chorus, echo, and they have like some
686680	693680	wah-wah and other stuff that you can do. So, it was okay. But, I don't know. The guitar
695920	700320	thing, also they were a little bit thinner, and probably about as light as a normal Guitar
700320	705080	Hero guitar. So, the guitars look good. I don't know. I mean, I'm sure that the guitar
705080	710940	has been through all sorts of abuse if it's on this tour. So, I'm attributing to that,
710940	714560	but I hope that there isn't an issue with the guitars when it comes out, because that
714560	720320	game is quite expensive. So, we'll have to see. But otherwise, it was fun. Definitely
720320	725480	fun. I like the whole team kind of aspect to it, because my guitar was giving me shit.
725480	731440	And so, I failed the first song, and my other teammates kind of got me back into the game.
731440	735520	And the same thing happened in reverse the last time. The drummer failed, and I got him
735520	740920	back in there with the bass guitar. So, that's kind of cool. I don't know. It was a good
740920	747360	game though. But, if you expect anything really different from Guitar Hero, you're going to
747360	753360	be disappointed. But, it'll look good. All right. So, do you think that Rock Band
753360	758840	got lots of awards at E3 2007? Do you think that it's worthy of all the praise it's been
758840	762200	getting? I think so. I think, well, Guitar Hero 3, I don't really think they're doing
762200	764800	too much different, other than the fact that they're going to be catering to more of a
764800	771120	hardcore crowd. It's kind of like the In The Groove. If In The Groove were created by Konami,
771120	776600	this would be kind of like that. Where it's a game catered towards people that really
776600	782640	want insane charts to play. Whereas, Rock Band's going to be a little bit different,
782640	787600	because they're going to try to appeal to everybody. The place that they had it showing
787600	794120	today was this Rhythm and Ribs Festival. It was a bunch of middle-aged people listening
794120	802400	to blues music and stuff, eating ribs. I just happened to go just to play this game. But,
802400	807600	I think it'll be good. The problem is, they're going to have a tough time selling it for
807600	813160	200 bucks. From what I hear, and I don't know if this is going to be exactly the case, they're
813160	818720	only going to be selling the game by itself, and also that special edition, which is going
818720	822520	to have the guitar, drums, and microphone. Those are the only two ways that they're going
822520	828440	to have them. But, I guess in 2008, in January, they're going to start selling the drums and
828440	836840	the guitars separately. So, I don't know. Alright. Well, my gaming week, I also got
836840	841360	to play Halo 3 for about 15 minutes, because Loki brought it over here, and I wanted to
841360	845120	see it. So, I got part of the way through the jungle.
845120	851040	One last thing I forgot to mention. Since I did get the collector's edition, there's
851040	857960	another game that's actually on the disc, on the add-on disc. It's almost like a flash
857960	865680	game where you have to put grenades underneath a warthog to fling it into the air to destroy
865680	867720	aliens. Let me show the game to the OP11 people again
867720	871280	so you can see the box, because this is different than the box art I've been seeing online,
871280	875520	because most of the reviewers got the regular copy of Halo 3, but you somehow managed one
875520	879760	of these little special edition things, so it's pretty neat there.
879760	883400	So again, if you want to look at webcam feed of our show archived, it's operate11.com.
883400	887640	Sometimes we hold up random things in front of the camera just to show what's going on.
887640	893660	So I played Halo 3, which was pretty cool. Again, I certainly haven't played enough to
893660	897720	give an opinion of it. It certainly looked nice, I'll say that.
897720	901840	And I like the customization. I love the customization in games like that.
901840	906360	And all I have to say is I was able to make my emblem a unicorn, and it was awesome, because
906360	910040	unicorns are rad. So there you go.
910040	915160	More on Halo 3 next week. I have been spending my entire freaking week
915160	918800	playing Eternal Sonata. I ran out and bought this game the day it came out, because I really
918800	921880	enjoyed the demo, and I have been loving the game.
921880	925960	And I've been reading some of the reviews online of the game, and I honestly think most
925960	927680	of the critics have been pretty harsh on this game.
927680	931880	I think critics across the board just don't really care for Japanese role-playing games,
931880	936760	especially 360 reviewers. Because on the 360, you don't get a lot of
936760	942900	games like this, but this is kind of a throwback to some really rad PlayStation 2 games I can
942900	945880	think of in the past. So I don't know, I would say if you're a fan
945880	948840	of these types of Japanese role-playing games, don't listen to the reviews.
948840	952880	Is the game perfect? No. Some of my issues with the game is that the
952880	956160	game tends to repeat the monsters over and over again.
956160	960120	Like you go into a dungeon, and there's basically only two types of monsters you can fight.
960120	964240	There's scorpions, there's other things, flying bugs or something, I don't know.
964240	970920	So the monsters get a little stale, and the game does feel a little bit easy on the easy
970920	972920	side. But that's probably just the way that I play
972920	977940	RPGs usually, is I grind hella much in the beginning so that I'm one step ahead on the
977940	980080	EXP. But otherwise, I think the game is awesome.
980080	984160	I love the battle system in the game, because with the battle system, basically the play
984160	989640	field is live. You run around the field, you have five seconds,
989640	993920	depending on what level your party's at, you have five seconds, then like four seconds,
993920	997640	you have a certain amount of time to run around the battlefield to where the monster is, and
997640	1001880	then attack or what have you. So it's like a tactical mixed with a Final
1001880	1004240	Fantasy type battle system. It's really cool.
1004240	1007360	And then there's light spots and dark spots, and the special attacks you do in the light
1007360	1012280	spots are one thing, and the dark spots are completely a different thing.
1012280	1017100	And of course, every character has their own stuff, and later on, as you advance, the one
1017100	1019720	cool thing is that the battle system builds and builds.
1019720	1023920	In the beginning, your five seconds only counts down when you're actually doing something.
1023920	1027540	But then later on, you have four seconds that counts down no matter what.
1027540	1030720	But you get perks from that. You get this echo meter that you build up.
1030720	1034800	So the more attacks you do, the more damage your special attacks do.
1034800	1037560	It's pretty neat, intricate, the way the game works.
1037560	1043040	And the game is beautiful, very colorful, lots of greens, blues, reds, you know, just
1043040	1048320	all these different types of areas, snow areas, fire areas, you know, just really shows off
1048320	1053600	the graphical capabilities of the 360. And I, for one, think the story is pretty
1053600	1056240	awesome. I mean, it's certainly one of the most original
1056240	1060100	stories you'll see out there. I mean, it's based around Chopin, and how
1060100	1065720	in the last days of Chopin's life, he was kind of dreaming up this fantasy world, and
1065720	1068120	this whole story takes place in a fantasy world.
1068120	1071820	But it's really deep, and it's really weird. Like, one thing I hadn't heard about until
1071820	1076580	I really started playing the game was that at random occurrences, the game will actually
1076580	1081420	cut away to these, like, educational pieces about Chopin's life.
1081420	1082920	It's so weird. Boo, education!
1082920	1084820	No, no, no, no. It's not like that.
1084820	1089760	It tells stories about Chopin's life, and while it's doing that, it shows, like, pictures.
1089760	1094340	It shows, like, really beautiful high-definition pictures from, you know, Poland and France
1094340	1098460	and all these places that he lived, and it tells you these things about Chopin's life.
1098460	1102800	But the pieces, and they're playing the scores on piano.
1102800	1108440	And by the way, for you DDR fans, the song Kakumei from DDR Max 2, you remember that
1108440	1112680	song? That's based on a Chopin piece, Revolution,
1112680	1115740	and Revolution is the whole second stage in the game.
1115740	1120220	So you actually hear the original piano piece, and it's showing you all these pictures, kind
1120220	1122760	of telling you about Chopin's life, and what it is is kind of mirroring what's going on
1122760	1126980	in the game. And it's just really interesting.
1126980	1132660	Some really long monologues and stuff. It's a good story. Certainly worth checking
1132660	1136580	out. Some of the voice acting is actually really
1136580	1138780	good. Some of it is a little bit irritating, like,
1138780	1145060	I don't care for the little child beat or polka, but some of the other voice acting
1145060	1147860	is really, really good in the game. So I definitely recommend it.
1147860	1154300	If you own a 360 and you are into role-playing games of the Japanese style at all, you totally
1154300	1157200	should check this one out. I think it's better than a lot of critics
1157200	1159900	are making it out to be. Not that critics are giving it bad scores,
1159900	1163980	but like 7s and 8s, but I would definitely say this game is at least an 8.5, if not a
1163980	1167140	9. It probably will be one of my favorite games
1167140	1169860	of the year. Going to chat room, looking at some comments
1169860	1172460	there. Chat.orangelandradio.com if you guys want
1172460	1176820	to participate. Ghost says, anyway, Eternal Sonata looks beautiful.
1176820	1183140	GS68 says, fuck corporate reviewers. WTF, I can only move in two dimensions.
1183140	1187380	There's no save points, I keep dying, and the game can be beaten in under one hour?
1187380	1192420	Negative 264 out of 10. You know, I think the thing about reviews
1192420	1196540	is that everybody's different. Everybody's different and likes different
1196540	1199700	stuff, including the reviewers out there like different stuff.
1199700	1203700	So, you just have to kind of find that reviewer that matches your taste, and maybe that's
1203700	1206860	me here on this show, or maybe it is somebody that writes for one of the corporate sites.
1206860	1210300	And I also think people are influenced by hype and stuff, like for example, if I wanted
1210300	1216020	to rate Halo like a 7 or 8 or something like that, people would be jumping all over me.
1216020	1219220	They'd be like, what the hell, this is the game of the year, blah blah blah blah blah.
1219220	1221980	I mean, hype does go a long way, that's for sure.
1221980	1226100	And also, did you notice that those commercials for Halo 3 that they have right now, like
1226100	1229840	the final set of commercials and teasers and stuff, completely suck.
1229840	1234860	It's like that they have a marketing person from Sony come over and create commercials
1234860	1238420	for them, like with that stupid digital museum shit.
1238420	1242860	It just shows fucking gameplay. That's all you got to show.
1242860	1246860	You don't need to show some fucking old guy talking about a plasma rifle or some shit
1246860	1250900	like that. No one knows nor cares what it's for.
1250900	1252460	I don't know, it's stupid.
1252460	1256640	By the way, the story in Eternal Sonata is kind of a real downer.
1256640	1261260	Like, you don't really see these types of stories in games, but I'm not going to real
1261260	1264860	spoil anything, because the very first thing you see is one of the characters jumping off
1264860	1269740	a cliff, apparently committing suicide, talking about letting herself go or whatever.
1269740	1273500	And then of course, you know, Chopin is dying, and he's actually a character in the game.
1273500	1274580	He's talking about dying.
1274580	1278140	Meanwhile, there's another character who's 14 years old who realizes that because she
1278140	1280940	can use magic, she has an incurable illness.
1280940	1285300	So it's like all these people are dying, and then there was one death scene at the end
1285300	1290260	of one of the chapters I just beat, and this character died, and she realized all the wrong
1290260	1295460	that she had done in the world, and gives this five-minute monologue before she dies
1295460	1299100	and lets this dove go free as her last dying wish.
1299100	1302660	I mean, it sounds hokey the way I'm describing it, but actually, the way it was done was
1302660	1303660	really cool.
1303660	1305980	It's got good news and bad news for you.
1305980	1307420	Good news, you can do magic.
1307420	1309040	What's the bad news?
1309040	1310040	You have brain cancer.
1310040	1314300	Essentially, that's what it is, but here's the interesting thing is they try to make
1314300	1321660	parallels between that character and Chopin's sister who died as a teenager of tuberculosis.
1321660	1325900	See there's all these really interesting parallels in it that I think make the story certainly
1325900	1327300	really creative.
1327300	1332860	You know, you may have those cliche RPG moments in it, but it's certainly never seen anything
1332860	1333860	like this before.
1333860	1340020	You know, if TB gave you magical powers, maybe people wouldn't be so sad over it, you know?
1340020	1341820	I mean, you are so wrong.
1341820	1343620	I don't even know what to tell you.
1343620	1346140	There are some magicians out there which would get TB.
1346140	1349140	I'm looking at you, David Copperfield.
1349140	1353300	Alright, anyhow, that's really all I've been playing.
1353300	1356200	I checked out that one game that came out on Xbox Live this week.
1356200	1357200	What is it?
1357200	1358200	Geos or whatever?
1358200	1359200	I don't know.
1359200	1360200	It looks stupid.
1360200	1361200	Was it Geos, the system on the Commodore 64?
1361200	1362200	It's like Geon Emotions or something.
1362200	1363200	Isn't that like an English school in Japan?
1363200	1364200	I don't know.
1364200	1365200	Geon Emotions.
1365200	1366200	Oh, is it Geon?
1366200	1367200	I don't know.
1367200	1368200	Maybe I was thinking of the Commodore 64 thing.
1368200	1369200	It's Geon, I'm not going to buy it.
1369200	1370900	That's what it's called.
1370900	1371900	It was okay.
1371900	1375980	I played it for like 15 minutes and then I was like, I need to go back to Eternal Sonata
1375980	1379660	because I'm not progressing enough in the story.
1379660	1383000	I don't know where the hell these reviewers are saying this game is too short.
1383000	1387740	I've been playing for about 16 hours now and I think I'm maybe at the halfway point.
1387740	1389120	It may be a little past.
1389120	1391620	Like 30 hours is short for an RPG.
1391620	1393900	How long did it take you to beat Halo 3, Loki?
1393900	1398300	Well, I got the game on Wednesday and I finished it today.
1398300	1399300	And I didn't play that long.
1399300	1404080	I mean, maybe, I'd say maybe 10 hours at the most.
1404080	1405080	There you go.
1405080	1406080	And let me put it this way.
1406080	1410020	I mean, I guess, granted, Halo 3 has a shitload of replayability value thanks to the multiplayer
1410020	1411020	mode.
1411020	1414080	Well, there's a lot of stuff you can go back and, like, I played it on Normal difficulty,
1414080	1418080	which I hear is super easy, but, you know, I just wanted to start at Normal.
1418080	1422300	Had I realized that you can actually go through, like, Legendary or something like that and
1422300	1425660	then you'll get the achievements for all the other difficulties, I would have saved myself
1425660	1428540	some time and just played on the hardest difficulty.
1428540	1435380	But I was going to say, if one bit of advice, so whenever you get into a sequence where
1435380	1439760	someone's piloting a vehicle, I highly recommend you kick them out of the driver's seat and
1439760	1444920	you pilot the vehicle because the AI sucks at piloting vehicles.
1444920	1446860	Completely awful.
1446860	1448580	Especially if a woman's driving the car, correct?
1448580	1452780	Oh my God, there was someone driving, there was a woman driving the fucking, like, one
1452780	1457660	of the mongooses in the game and fucking just said, I'm going to jump this cliff and then,
1457660	1461100	like, boom, straight down the cliff or, like, slam it into the wall and stuff.
1461100	1463580	I'm like, okay, woman out, I'll drive this.
1463580	1467980	I'm just like, you know, I drove by like typical.
1467980	1469820	That was hilarious.
1469820	1474380	DarkSakura, will you be playing Halo 3?
1474380	1477540	If first person shooters didn't make me puke, then maybe.
1477540	1482660	No, actually, even if first person shooters made me puke, no.
1482660	1484020	Because you're too busy with Ragnarok.
1484020	1486540	No, because I'm too busy playing good games.
1486540	1488340	Oh, snap.
1488340	1493460	Alright, let's, uh, I guess that's it, that's really all I have to say for my gaming week.
1493460	1498300	I've talked far too much about those games I've been playing this week, so let's get
1498300	1503000	into some housekeeping, of which there's not a lot tonight, no really big changes coming
1503000	1508060	up with the show, except that we do have episode 250 is only two weeks away, although we're
1508060	1510860	not planning a whole lot of special stuff for that because we already had, like, a fifth
1510860	1515180	year anniversary show this year, we do just want to point that out, that maybe something
1515180	1519060	special will happen, something little will happen in a couple weeks, we'll see.
1519060	1524100	In the meantime, our show is still simulcast on Operator 11, which you can visit operator11.com
1524100	1529220	and look at the old video of our feeds, or you can always join our communities on Live
1529220	1534060	Journal and Myspace and Facebook, I forgot to say the Facebook people last week, but
1534060	1538380	the reason why I neglected to mention Facebook last week is because Facebook has been fucking
1538380	1542820	bugging me lately, like, oh, I'm going to take a lot of shit for this, I seriously think
1542820	1545900	Facebook is getting worse than Myspace, and you know why?
1545900	1550300	It's because of all those little add-ins that they have on the pages now, like, I get all
1550300	1556460	these invites to play Pirates vs Ninjas, to have a movie list, to have a, it's just turned
1556460	1562340	into a bunch of crap, I mean, at least on Myspace, if my page sucks, that's my fault,
1562340	1566620	but I don't know, I don't want to start a social networking war, but I apologize to
1566620	1571980	the Facebook fans, twice, for my behavior this week.
1571980	1576860	So that's that, let's get into some gaming news, and we'll talk about that.
1576860	1581920	Well, this week we had a lot of big announcements, of course, because Tokyo Game Show was going
1581920	1583700	on.
1583700	1588160	One interesting thing though, and will probably be a sigh of relief for a lot of people, Super
1588160	1594480	Smash Bros. Brawl has revealed their online plans, yes, there will be friends codes, at
1594480	1599980	least it will be online, so that's good, thank god, there will be options to play against
1599980	1606700	friends or to play against anybody, so, I don't know, kind of, I guess, typical for
1606700	1614020	your normal Nintendo online game, so yeah, pretty awesome.
1614020	1618820	And on the dojo this week, they put up all these snake things, like they finally, you
1618820	1623260	know, I guess, what do you want to say, officially unveiled Snake as a character on the dojo,
1623260	1627940	although thanks to E3 last year, we already knew it was coming, but they actually officially,
1627940	1630940	you know, rolled out his profile and everything on the site, and there's a pretty awesome
1630940	1636100	picture of him, it's kind of a homoerotic pose, with him and Ike coming up behind him
1636100	1639820	and doing the whole, like, I'm going to snap your neck type thing, or who knows what.
1639820	1644500	You know, I remember that one game that I had, and I cannot remember the name for the
1644500	1649340	life of me, that had a bunch of Hudson characters, and like Hasbro characters in it and stuff,
1649340	1651660	remember Snake was in there.
1651660	1653660	Wasn't that the one where you could be, like, Optimus Prime?
1653660	1657620	Yeah, you could do Optimus Prime vs. Barbie, I mean, how awesome is that?
1657620	1659020	That was on the DS, right?
1659020	1663260	Yeah, it was like, you could play as Bomberman, or no, it wasn't DS, it was on the Playstation
1663260	1669060	2, it was, they had Bomberman, Snake, they actually had Simon Belmont, you could play
1669060	1674060	as Barbie, there was Optimus Prime...
1674060	1677820	Dark Tetsuya and Rob D are yelling, Dream Mix TV World Fighters!
1677820	1680200	Yes, that's it, yeah, that's awesome.
1680200	1683940	So, you know, really, they could have just ripped that out of, or ripped Snake from there,
1683940	1688140	and just used all of his moves, because from what I've seen on Super Smash Brothers already,
1688140	1692340	it's kind of similar anyways, so, I don't know.
1692340	1693340	Interesting.
1693340	1695020	Optimus Prime vs. Barbie, awesome.
1695020	1698340	It made me think of a completely different game, even though it's not the same.
1698340	1703100	The, what was it, Super Konami World, where you could, you played original characters
1703100	1706900	that went into different Konami games, it was very interesting.
1706900	1707900	Very cool.
1707900	1712340	And that's the one, you could be like, Miss Cool Ninja, what is this, going on, you could
1712340	1713340	be like...
1713340	1714340	You could go into that world.
1714340	1715340	Yeah, that's cool.
1715340	1716340	I think I played that once.
1716340	1719260	And I think there was like a Yayar Kung Fu level or something.
1719260	1720260	That's random.
1720260	1725420	Alright, anyhow, I also wanted to say about this though, what do you think about the whole
1725420	1730640	fact that when you play online against strangers, you don't get to see their names, you don't
1730640	1735980	get to have the little chat bubbles, nothing, it's just a straight up, it's almost like
1735980	1739340	playing against the computer, except the computer is actually being controlled by someone real
1739340	1740340	you don't know.
1740340	1742420	It doesn't save stats, it doesn't do anything.
1742420	1746540	I mean, in my mind, I'm kind of like, well, then why do they even bother?
1746540	1751660	Because you can't track who you're playing, you can't, if you liked playing with them,
1751660	1754660	you can't play with them again later, I mean, there's like none of that.
1754660	1758140	But I suppose this is just more bitching about Nintendo's online mode.
1758140	1761420	All I gotta say is their online needs a major overhaul.
1761420	1768100	I mean, I heard rumors that there's supposed to be some major update coming this month,
1768100	1774180	and with next week being the last week of the month, I don't think that's gonna happen.
1774180	1778100	You know, I do like what they're doing with the friend stuff, like if you have a friend
1778100	1782300	added, you know, how you can do, in lieu of voice chat, I mean, since they don't have
1782300	1785780	that, you can do the little speech bubbles and things, I mean, that's kind of neat,
1785780	1786780	I guess.
1786780	1791780	I don't know, part of the reason the DS online thing works is, I don't know how you guys
1791780	1795900	do it, but the way I play DS online is that I'll be chatting with someone on AOL, and
1795900	1797380	they'll be like, hey, you wanna play something on DS?
1797380	1800900	I'm like, okay, and so then I'll play the game, and then as soon as the game overs,
1800900	1804580	I can go right over and chat with them, like, haha, I kicked your ass, or, boy, you own
1804580	1805580	me, or whatever.
1805580	1807360	Yeah, but even- But you can't do that on the Wii now, unless
1807360	1808360	I have a laptop.
1808360	1814580	But even the DS has more features in their online games than the Wii has, I mean, shit,
1814580	1818580	it's like they've got voice chat, they have lobbies and stuff like that, the Wii doesn't
1818580	1819580	have that.
1819580	1822900	I mean, come on, there's more technology in the Wii than there is in the DS, why can't
1822900	1825340	they implement the stuff that's already implemented in other things?
1825340	1830340	And if the DS can handle voice chat, why can't the fucking Wii handle it?
1830340	1834820	The Rob D. in our chat says, honestly, Sky, Wii fighter fans get so few bones thrown to
1834820	1838200	us in terms of online play that I, for one, don't even care.
1838200	1841780	Online play on a fighter is enough for me right now.
1841780	1846180	And Rob D. says, when I play on DS, we chat on Skype, too, that'll work.
1846180	1850340	And I guess, in a way, you have a point, it's better than nothing.
1850340	1854000	And I think that's a lot of the reaction people are having to this news, at least that's kind
1854000	1857840	of what I said, I said, okay, at least it's a step in the right direction, and it's better
1857840	1862260	than not being online at all, like Metroid Prime 3.
1862260	1867680	But still, you look at the mainframe and everything that Xbox Live has to offer, and you kind
1867680	1872460	of go, jeez, Nintendo really feels like a little bit behind in these realms of online
1872460	1873460	play.
1873460	1877500	But I suppose with their whole, you know, we're not making games for the hardcore gamers
1877500	1882060	all the time type thing, maybe they can get away with that, and they probably can.
1882060	1884060	So what have you?
1884060	1887600	Well, if you have some further comments on this, you can always send us an email, mailbag
1887600	1890980	at orangelandrater.com is the place to go.
1890980	1897700	Meanwhile, I have some news for you guys, and it has to do with Star Wars The Force
1897700	1898900	Unleashed.
1898900	1904060	It's a new game coming out on the Nintendo Wii, and you know, a lot of folks are very
1904060	1908300	excited that they're finally getting a Star Wars game, because of course, you know, Star
1908300	1913340	Wars game equals, ooh, we're gonna have big lightsaber battles finally on the Wii, yes,
1913340	1914700	what the Wii was made for.
1914700	1919120	Well, according to a recent episode of the 1UP Podcast, thanks to my Twitter friends
1919120	1922580	for pointing this out to me, it may not be so.
1922580	1927300	It looks like the game may actually not feature that kind of support for...
1927300	1931660	I would say, because I thought this was coming out on like 360 and Playstation 3 as well.
1931660	1932660	Yeah, it's probably one.
1932660	1936740	And it's just gonna be kind of like, you know, Knights of the Old Republic or something like
1936740	1942780	that, you know, but a little bit more physics and stuff like, you know, it's gonna look
1942780	1943780	pretty.
1943780	1947980	But it's not like a true, you know, like playing the Star Wars arcade game, you know, the new
1947980	1952740	arcade game where they had, you know, the actual lightsaber and stuff that you can play
1952740	1953740	around with.
1953740	1957020	I suppose there will be more to come on this, however, I'll leave you with this official
1957020	1961580	quote from the president of LucasArts, Jim Ward, quote, Wii is a great platform for the
1961580	1966180	Force Unleashed because the console's motion-oriented controllers really bring the game to life.
1966180	1970260	We've worked hard to make the Wii version of the game unique in order to truly let you
1970260	1971820	unleash the Force.
1971820	1976300	Hmm, but if you, I mean, I don't know, I don't know to what validity the other podcast information
1976300	1978940	is, but if it's not that way, that's gonna be a bummer.
1978940	1983140	It'll probably have, like, limited stuff where you'll swing it around to, like, do different
1983140	1986940	things, but it'll also be, like, if you're gonna be using the Force, like, if you push
1986940	1991980	the remote and uncheck out, it'll be, like, doing the Force push or, you know, stuff like
1991980	1992980	that.
1992980	1993980	It's very limited.
1993980	2000640	All right, well, I'll still, you know, check it out, and hopefully you do get to do some
2000640	2005660	Wii lightsaber, but, you know, just because it doesn't have the lightsaber doesn't necessarily
2005660	2006660	mean it'll be a bad game.
2006660	2009900	I mean, a lot of people seem to enjoy the Lego Star Wars thing, which had really nothing
2009900	2013980	to do with motion controls, so you can still have, there's still a lot of good games to
2013980	2018220	be cranked out of the Star Wars franchise, and I'm sure they'll try for years and years
2018220	2019700	and years to come.
2019700	2025220	Well, I've made a mention of this earlier that I'm going to be getting one myself, but
2025220	2029420	there you've confirmed that the Wii Zapper's gonna be out in Europe this year, though there's
2029420	2035220	not a date on it yet, and the US will be out on the 19th of November, but the games that
2035220	2039900	we'll work with so far is Link's Crossbow Training that's coming out, sort of like a
2039900	2043540	shooting gallery type of game.
2043540	2047100	There's Medal of Honor Heroes 2, Ghost Squad.
2047100	2050900	I'm so excited about Ghost Squad coming out, by the way, because it's one of my favorite
2050900	2056020	arcade games, and Resident Evil the Umbrella Chronicles, so it'll use the Zapper.
2056020	2060740	Dan was saying at their conference that they weren't calling it a light gun.
2060740	2065700	They were calling it a pointing system, a pointer system.
2065700	2067620	I thought that was funny.
2067620	2068620	Interesting.
2068620	2074620	Also sort of related, too, is that he did see the new gun con that looks like the gun
2074620	2077340	con 2 and has a trigger switch.
2077340	2078340	Over time crisis?
2078340	2079340	Yeah.
2079340	2080340	Yeah.
2080340	2082900	And has a trigger switch on the side for a directional button.
2082900	2087940	Mr. DeBucket in chat says, it's not a gun, it's a blaster or a pointer.
2087940	2088940	You know, but it ain't a bazooka.
2088940	2092260	That thing is still as awesome as the Saturn Enforcer.
2092260	2093780	Or the Super Scope 6, honestly.
2093780	2094980	I mean, it was a fucking bazooka.
2094980	2096300	You can't get any cooler than that.
2096300	2097300	You really can't.
2097300	2099180	I'm telling you, man, that thing is so useless.
2099180	2100300	The miniser, Rob.
2100300	2101300	The miniser.
2101300	2102300	Or the activator.
2102300	2103300	No.
2103300	2104300	I have an activator.
2104300	2105300	I'm sorry.
2105300	2106460	I got it for nine bucks.
2106460	2108220	I remember when Loki bought an activator.
2108220	2110160	Why the hell did you buy an activator?
2110160	2112140	You bought an activator on eBay for something.
2112140	2113140	It was for your cabinet.
2113140	2114140	It was for the cabinet.
2114140	2115140	You poured money.
2115140	2116420	You were going to do the Para Para thing.
2116420	2118700	I was going to build a Para Para setup for the cabinet.
2118700	2123820	This is back when I was going to build one control panel for every single Bomani game.
2123820	2126980	And back when Para Para was cool.
2126980	2135220	I ended up throwing the activator stuff away because I got it for like ten bucks.
2135220	2141140	I did, however, and I still have them, I have the dream Para Para controller, which does
2141140	2145140	hook up to the PC via a converter.
2145140	2147380	So if I really want to.
2147380	2150540	And I remember we played the dream Para Para on the Dreamcast.
2150540	2155700	It's exactly the same as Para Para, except it has really crappy songs.
2155700	2156980	Son of Dad asks a good question.
2156980	2159780	Can Silent Hill Arcade be ported to the Wii with the Zapper?
2159780	2160780	Probably.
2160780	2161780	I hope so.
2161780	2162780	It'll be fun.
2162780	2163780	Don't you want to shoot Pyramid Head?
2163780	2164780	Yes.
2164780	2165780	With hearts?
2165780	2169060	I'd like to shoot him with death.
2169060	2170500	With death.
2170500	2171820	Cake or death?
2171820	2173180	Cake, please.
2173180	2174180	Death.
2174180	2175180	No, wait!
2175180	2177700	Ha ha, you said death first.
2177700	2180980	Actually since Dark Sakura brought up Resident Evil real fast, I wanted to say this because
2180980	2184760	I know it's not in the show world tonight, but did you guys know that a new Resident
2184760	2186300	Evil movie came out this week?
2186300	2188060	Yeah, I saw it.
2188060	2190860	Rice Princess called me last night wanting to know if I wanted to go see it and I was
2190860	2192780	like, no, I don't.
2192780	2194900	I never saw the second movie because I knew it would suck.
2194900	2195900	I liked the second one.
2195900	2196900	Did you?
2196900	2197900	Yes, I did.
2197900	2198900	Apparently the third one isn't bad.
2198900	2200140	It's better than the second one is what people are saying.
2200140	2202580	The second one had all the crap I wanted to see.
2202580	2203580	Really?
2203580	2204580	Being stuck in a city full of zombies.
2204580	2206820	I mean, hey, that was fantastic.
2206820	2209060	But the movie was number one at the box office this weekend.
2209060	2210700	It beat the Dane Cook movie.
2210700	2211700	And Jessica Alba.
2211700	2212700	Was it the Dane Cook movie?
2212700	2213700	Yes.
2213700	2214700	Yeah, but Dane Cook sucks, so.
2214700	2219940	And I think the movie has a 3% on Rotten Tomatoes and Resident Evil at least has like 10% I want
2219940	2220940	to say.
2220940	2222820	Okay, let's go see it this weekend, Rob.
2222820	2224260	I don't know if I want to.
2224260	2225260	Come on.
2225260	2226260	I'll pay.
2226260	2227260	There's serious...
2227260	2228260	Okay.
2228260	2229260	You can get dinner.
2229260	2230260	Here, if you'll pay.
2230260	2233700	If you want to do something better, Transformers just came into the IMAX.
2233700	2234700	Ooh.
2234700	2238660	I haven't seen 10 to 20 minutes of extra footage in there.
2238660	2240140	Let's go, Rob.
2240140	2241140	That I might have to go see.
2241140	2242140	I haven't seen that yet.
2242140	2243140	But I'm not paying for IMAX.
2243140	2245140	Okay, I'll pay for IMAX though.
2245140	2247780	That'll be fun.
2247780	2252180	One thing I was going to say, once again, commenting on the Wii Zapper, completely useless
2252180	2253180	piece of shit.
2253180	2256300	And you guys will all buy it because it has Zelda crossbow training.
2256300	2259380	You fucking sheep.
2259380	2261380	And we will prove on this show.
2261380	2262380	I'll buy it.
2262380	2263380	Yeah, you will buy it.
2263380	2267500	We will prove on this damn show that that piece of shit actually hinders your playing
2267500	2272300	versus helping you and that it is a complete useless pile of junk.
2272300	2275940	In fact, I think we should use Zelda's crossbow training as the game.
2275940	2276940	As the game.
2276940	2277940	All right.
2277940	2279140	So, yes, for those that forget, Loki and I made a bet.
2279140	2280140	What was it?
2280140	2281380	About 10 weeks ago on the show?
2281380	2286540	We made a bet when the Wii Zapper was first announced, Loki said the Zapper will not be
2286540	2288180	better than using the Wiimote.
2288180	2292460	So we made a bet that we're going to play a game and whoever can get the higher score
2292460	2296840	in the game, Loki will not use the Zapper, I will use the Zapper in a game that was intended
2296840	2300420	for the Zapper to be used, like Zelda crossbow training.
2300420	2305040	If Loki can get a higher score than me, then I will have to take his wife out for an evening
2305040	2308700	so that he can have the place to himself to play all the games that he wants.
2308700	2313540	However, if I win, then Loki has to go out on a date with me and it'll be videotaped
2313540	2318220	and chronicled for our listeners.
2318220	2321700	I'm really just doing it to get a free dinner.
2321700	2324140	There's nothing involved with that.
2324140	2327000	I'm not making him put out at the end of the date or anything.
2327000	2331900	That's taking it a little far, but it will be fun and it will be a free dinner.
2331900	2335040	Darktitsia says, YouTuber, it didn't happen.
2335040	2338540	Mikosynth says, I want Skye to win just because that would be freaking hilarious.
2338540	2340660	I think so, it'd be a good time.
2340660	2341660	Good times.
2341660	2342660	Absolutely.
2342660	2345500	All right, let's travel the globe and look at some release dates, things that are coming
2345500	2346500	out very soon.
2346500	2348900	Yes, starting in the US.
2348900	2353300	This is a big week, of course, with Halo 3 coming out in the 360.
2353300	2356380	All three versions on Tuesday.
2356380	2360140	Better start lining up on Monday because everybody else is going to...
2360140	2361700	You know what?
2361700	2362700	Seriously?
2362700	2363700	Why?
2363700	2364700	Why do you need to line up?
2364700	2366700	Can't you just go after work or school on Tuesday?
2366700	2369340	So you can be the first people in the world to play it.
2369340	2370340	Guess what?
2370340	2371340	You're not.
2371340	2374060	Three people on my friends list have already been playing it and we had it.
2374060	2375060	You know what?
2375060	2377980	You're not the first in the world, so just wait for Tuesday.
2377980	2380660	Do you really have to get it at midnight?
2380660	2381660	That's what I want.
2381660	2384740	I want to know how many people in our chat room are planning to run out at midnight tomorrow
2384740	2387220	and buy the game, and if so, why?
2387220	2389220	That's what I want to know.
2389220	2390220	Yeah.
2390220	2391220	Sorry.
2391220	2394180	Anyways, other games coming out this week, actually some that I'm looking forward to.
2394180	2398260	Jackass the Game on PlayStation 2 and PSP.
2398260	2399500	I've got to buy this game.
2399500	2401120	It just looks...
2401120	2402280	It's too much fun.
2402280	2403280	I would...
2403280	2404620	Well, you don't got to buy the game.
2404620	2405620	I have to buy the...
2405620	2408180	Well, yeah, I don't have to buy the game.
2408180	2411100	Anyways, other games coming out.
2411100	2415820	Also we have CSI Hard Evidence on Xbox 360.
2415820	2421740	Hot Wheels Beat That, which I'm sure is going to be an awesome game, on Xbox 360, PlayStation
2421740	2425300	2, and the Wii.
2425300	2432100	A small old game called Dance Dance Revolution Supernova 2 is going to be coming out on PlayStation
2432100	2433100	2.
2433100	2434100	Yes it is.
2434100	2435100	Where did that come from?
2435100	2436100	Yeah.
2436100	2437100	It's coming out next week.
2437100	2438100	Yeah.
2438100	2439100	Funny enough, they haven't...
2439100	2440100	Oh, battle things.
2440100	2441100	Yeah, I know.
2441100	2442100	I was like, oh, yeah, DDR.
2442100	2443100	I remember when I played that every day.
2443100	2446460	CSI Three Mentions of Murder on PlayStation 2.
2446460	2452900	My favorite title, or just name of a title, this week is Soul Nomad and the World Eaters
2452900	2454060	on PlayStation 2.
2454060	2456540	I saw the website for that.
2456540	2461520	It's by the people who did, crap, now I can't think of it.
2461520	2463180	It's a tactics game, though.
2463180	2464180	Nice.
2464180	2468340	I think they did Grimm and Gremor, if I remember correctly.
2468340	2477060	Or, let's see here, World Series of Poker 2008, and then, of course, on PlayStation
2477060	2483420	2, PlayStation 3, and the PSP NBA 08.
2483420	2490620	Let's see, Skates coming out on PlayStation 3, and let's see, on the Wii, you have Bratz
2490620	2494420	the movie, Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party.
2494420	2497060	Loki, why do you even bother reading that title, Bratz?
2497060	2502140	I mean, can you think of a single person who listens to this show who might purchase Bratz?
2502140	2503140	I don't know.
2503140	2505140	There's people that buy Hannah Montana games, so I have to mention everything.
2505140	2506140	Okay, you know what?
2506140	2507140	No.
2507140	2508140	I'm going to pose that question to our listeners.
2508140	2512380	I want to know if any of our listeners actually go out and purchase Bratz on the Wii.
2512380	2517500	If so, you have to send a picture, because emailing us just isn't good enough for something
2517500	2518500	of that caliber.
2518500	2519500	I actually want to see a picture.
2519500	2520500	Anyways...
2520500	2522980	I'm going to let Loki read those dates in the future.
2522980	2527260	Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party for the Wii is coming out this week as well.
2527260	2528260	Really?
2528260	2529260	Yes.
2529260	2530260	The bundle.
2530260	2536740	Let's see here, and then on the DS, we've got Math Play, which I'm sure is fun, and
2536740	2543180	it has to do with math, Race Driver Create and Race, Crayola Treasure Adventures...
2543180	2544820	Yay!
2544820	2552380	It's basically a bunch of crap, and I guess there are some spelling challenges and shit
2552380	2558140	game coming out on the DS and PSP.
2558140	2562260	I'm going to read some comments in chat real fast before we get to the next set of dates
2562260	2565780	here, because there's comments about the 360 midnight launch.
2565780	2567540	Remember I mentioned that a little bit ago?
2567540	2571700	SSJ100Matt says, ask the people who lined up for the new Harry Potter book.
2571700	2574900	Everyplace Imaginables sold it, why line up?
2574900	2577820	Because there were people that seriously took off work the next day to read the book all
2577820	2579820	damn day.
2579820	2583420	Like a lot of my friends.
2583420	2587300	Rama asks, so how many people are going to call out sick to play Halo 3?
2587300	2591940	Rob D says, I'd go if the crowds weren't all frat boys and racist 12 year olds.
2591940	2599360	I love what an employee of an unnamed store told a friend of mine and Dan's.
2599360	2603140	We have to call you and tell you that your reservation for Halo 3 is here, but you don't
2603140	2605380	have to come at midnight if you don't want to.
2605380	2612320	It'll be there the next day.
2612320	2618220	If you want to comment, chat.orangelaungeradio.com and you can say such things like DJ Morpheus
2618220	2620820	says, Rob is the Chris Crocker of internet radio.
2620820	2621820	You know what?
2621820	2622820	Fuck that guy.
2622820	2623820	Seriously.
2623820	2626360	That guy sucks.
2626360	2631220	I cannot believe he's famous for that stupid, all right, forget it.
2631220	2632220	Release dates.
2632220	2633220	Oh, is it my turn?
2633220	2634220	Yes.
2634220	2635220	Oh, whatever.
2635220	2637660	Oh yeah, Halo 3 on the 26.
2637660	2638660	Big whoop.
2638660	2639660	Ha, you get it.
2639660	2640660	Day later.
2640660	2641660	Oh yeah.
2641660	2646540	Yeah, but technically their day later is, no, it is later, isn't it?
2646540	2647540	Anyway.
2647540	2648540	They're always a day later.
2648540	2651700	Moving forward to the 28th.
2651700	2657500	We have a whole bunch of shit coming out.
2657500	2662500	Armed assault, Queen's Gambit on PC, Blazing Angels, Secret Missions of World War II on
2662500	2669020	PC, Company of Heroes, Opposing Fronts, Conan on some stuff, Crazy Taxi, Fair Wars, PSP,
2669020	2675260	Enemy Territory, Quake Wars, FIFA 08 on damn near everything, Grim Grimoire, Jam Sessions,
2675260	2681980	Juice 2, Hot Import Nights, King of Clubs, MotoGP 07, Ratatouille on damn near everything,
2681980	2684420	Sega Rally also on damn near everything.
2684420	2687020	Is that an official console, damn near everything?
2687020	2688020	Yes.
2688020	2690860	Stranglehold, it's like the GameX, Rob.
2690860	2691860	Stuntman Ignition.
2691860	2694540	Oh yeah, we got that, I think.
2694540	2702100	Test Drive Unlimited, Xbox 360 Classics, and The Settlers Rise of an Empire.
2702100	2703100	Good times.
2703100	2704100	Yeah.
2704100	2706420	Moving over to Japan, checking out the release dates in Japan.
2706420	2709700	On the Wii, Bass Fishing Wii is coming out.
2709700	2713620	Now usually you go, you know, oh hooray, a fishing title on the Wii.
2713620	2719180	But I think the box art to this game is hilarious because they have like this random sexy girl
2719180	2722780	wearing a little camouflage vest going, hey, I just caught a fish.
2722780	2724940	I posted the link in chat so they can see.
2724940	2730200	But the little cover art for the game cracked me up, so Bass Fishing on the Wii is coming
2730200	2731200	out.
2731200	2733840	I don't think if it comes to America it'll have that box art.
2733840	2736980	My Sims is coming out on the Wii in Japan, the Japanese version.
2736980	2741180	Boku no, sorry, Boku to Sim Nomachi is what it's called over there.
2741180	2746300	On the PlayStation 3, The Elder Scrolls Oblivion finally comes out to the PlayStation 3 on
2746300	2751620	September 27th, along with Agarest Senki is coming out.
2751620	2755460	It's a compile game from them, and that's coming out on the PlayStation 3.
2755460	2758420	Looks to be a little strategy-based game.
2758420	2761620	Kind of looks like it has some RPG elements to me.
2761620	2764820	Actually, that battle kind of looks like an Eternal Sonata battle.
2764820	2768300	Hmm, a little tactical there in nature.
2768300	2772900	Fantasy Star Universe Ambition of the Illuminus comes out on the PlayStation 2, and when I
2772900	2776460	first read this I thought it said Fantasy Star Universe Abortion of the Illuminus, and
2776460	2781020	I was like, well, that's going to be a controversial game, but it's Ambition, Ambition.
2781020	2783160	We may be calling that once it comes out.
2783160	2789020	Some people called Fantasy Star Universe an abortion of a game, but it's not that bad.
2789020	2791580	I didn't think it was that bad.
2791580	2797140	PlayStation 2, Bleach Blade Battle 2nd, coming out on the PlayStation 2, because, you know,
2797140	2798740	you can't have enough Bleach.
2798740	2801660	A game is coming out on the DS, and this could be useful.
2801660	2803780	It's Bartender DS.
2803780	2806740	This is a game that teaches you how to mix drinks.
2806740	2807740	Fuck yeah!
2807740	2809620	That could actually be pretty handy.
2809620	2812420	Now that is making usefulness out of the DS.
2812420	2813420	Good job.
2813420	2814420	Props to those guys.
2814420	2819220	Namco Bandai is putting out another Tamagotchi game in Japan on the 27th for the DS.
2819220	2824980	Tamagotchi no Pucci Pucci Omiseki Mina San Q is coming out.
2824980	2826720	It's a strategy Tamagotchi game.
2826720	2829660	And then on the PSP, Yu-Gi-Oh!
2829660	2835780	Dual Monsters GX Tag Force 2, because you just can't get enough Yu-Gi-Oh!
2835780	2836780	Can you, Jamie?
2836780	2838500	Don't you love Yu-Gi-Oh?
2838500	2841500	Not in English.
2841500	2844740	But it looks like I'm trying to see, oh, it looks like another card battle game.
2844740	2845740	Surprise, surprise.
2845740	2846740	Yeah.
2846740	2848740	All right, that's it for release dates in Japan.
2848740	2857380	Anyways, so, Tokyo Game Show came out and, yeah, there's a whole bunch of news that I'm
2857380	2861540	totally, it was really shocking.
2861540	2866500	Of course, this can't be true because, you know, Sony's come out numerous times saying
2866500	2872780	that they have no plans on making the 6-axis rumble, but, oh, looky there, look, it's the
2872780	2873780	DualShock 3.
2873780	2876380	Oh my God, that's so surprising.
2876380	2878100	Didn't know that was going to happen.
2878100	2883300	Okay, let me put it this way, if there's ever a Sony rumor about, you know, them releasing
2883300	2889340	a new SKU, new features coming, et cetera, it's probably true, and that also goes for
2889340	2890340	Microsoft.
2890340	2891980	It's probably true.
2891980	2896420	So with that being said, the DualShock 3 is official.
2896420	2901580	It will feature the same wonderful technology that was in the DualShock 2, as well as now
2901580	2904380	you get, you know, the tilt stuff.
2904380	2909980	It's coming out in Japan in November, the rest of the world in spring of 2008.
2909980	2914620	There will be some interesting features for it, including, I believe, they're going to
2914620	2918940	be, you know, some of the newer games are going to be supporting it.
2918940	2923760	Also some of the older games that have already come out will be able to support rumble as
2923760	2929700	well through a patch system that they're going to implement, so, you know, Resistance, and
2929700	2933860	I think Ratchet and Clank is going to support it, stuff like that, so.
2933860	2940300	That's cool, you know, with them saying that, you know, rumble is last gen stuff, that you
2940300	2941300	don't need it.
2941300	2943200	Boy, they sure know how to backpedal.
2943200	2948540	Of course, the entire chat room is bursting out in unison, GS68 says, STFU, Sony rumble
2948540	2954540	is so last gen, and Darktetsuya says, but rumble is so last gen, eye roll.
2954540	2958620	So what do you think finally caused them to release this controller that we all knew was
2958620	2960380	coming six months ago?
2960380	2962660	The whole immersion thing is what it is.
2962660	2964420	It's because they finally settled with them.
2964420	2968620	They're saying, oh no, we planned on doing stuff like this, you guys wanted it so we
2968620	2969620	made it happen.
2969620	2974120	You know, it's just spin, all it is is that they were going to have it originally, I mean,
2974120	2978660	why else would the controller shells have room for, I don't know, rumble motors?
2978660	2982820	Hmm, that's kind of odd seeing as they never planned on having them there in the first
2982820	2983820	place.
2983820	2987780	Oh wait, yes they did, but then they found out a company got pissed at them for stealing
2987780	2991820	their technology, so.
2991820	2992820	It's all a bunch of bullshit.
2992820	2997620	Now if I'm understanding this correctly, when the rumble comes out, is the six axis motion
2997620	2998620	thing going away?
2998620	3000620	No, it's going to still be there.
3000620	3001620	It's both.
3001620	3002620	It's both now.
3002620	3003620	Okay.
3003620	3004620	So the two can work together.
3004620	3010980	Oh yeah, there's special algorithms, they said, that they have, that can detect, can
3010980	3015320	detect that, you know, the controller shaking is not actually you tilting it in a different
3015320	3016320	direction or something.
3016320	3020500	What we've done is we've actually taken a race of little gnome people and put them inside
3020500	3025880	the controller, and they're speedily calculating all these different algorithms, making the
3025880	3030020	six axis and rumble technology work together in perfect harmony.
3030020	3033620	Wow, that's so amazing, because no other systems have been able to do that yet.
3033620	3038020	Oh wait, no, I take that back, the Wii has one that works just like that.
3038020	3043180	So the Wii is also powered by little gnome people, that's why they're so hard to get.
3043180	3046320	I mean, the gnome women are having to crank out babies left and right to make this.
3046320	3048940	The gnome people are going to go on strike.
3048940	3051860	No, hell no, we won't rumble.
3051860	3058020	Please, please, Nintendo and Sony, think of David the gnome, think of David the gnome.
3058020	3061700	Nintendo Media 64 says in our chatroom, Loki, so that means that Metal Gear Solid 4 and
3061700	3064900	Final Fantasy 13 will actually be on the 360, they are rumors.
3064900	3069660	No, I've no Final Fantasy 13, I don't think I'm taking a future story, sorry if I am,
3069660	3075860	but Final Fantasy 13, they definitively said at the end of the trailer, PlayStation 3 only,
3075860	3077820	when they showed it at Tokyo Game Show this week, so.
3077820	3084700	Yeah, what they did show on there is 2020, you can come play at my house, Rob.
3084700	3091540	Final Fantasy 13 in 2013, that's the whole, yeah, and it'll come out on 1.13 or something,
3091540	3093700	I don't know, forget it.
3093700	3094700	Anyhow.
3094700	3095700	Okay, forget what?
3095700	3096700	Yeah, exactly.
3096700	3102220	One other thing that is pretty cool about the PlayStation 3, I mean, hey, heckle Sony
3102220	3105420	all you want over some of the decisions they've made, but you've got to admit, this is pretty
3105420	3109860	cool, is the whole fact that you can have the PlayStation portable functionality with
3109860	3113980	the PlayStation 3, even though we've given it shit on the show before for the rear view
3113980	3118740	mirror and stuff, you know, things like they've done in Lair and some of their future enhancements
3118740	3119900	look pretty cool.
3119900	3125220	They actually, Kazurai was talking about it at the keynote that happened at Tokyo Game
3125220	3131220	Show, and they were using this game, Manichi Demo, and it introduces some new functionality,
3131220	3136220	it allows you to turn on and off your PlayStation 3 via remote play, okay, I mean, that doesn't
3136220	3140340	seem like a real big deal to me, but multiple PSP systems in the future will be able to
3140340	3147780	connect as a hub, and they're wanting to continue this and use this more often, so pretty cool.
3147780	3151420	I like this idea, except for the fact that, you know, you have to have a lot of friends
3151420	3153220	with PSPs for it to work, but they're coming out at a price.
3153220	3156100	In case you want to have three rear view mirrors.
3156100	3158620	Well, you need side mirrors.
3158620	3164100	Well, awesome, that must be a reason why they're buying their system, you know, rear view mirror.
3164100	3165100	Absolutely.
3165100	3166100	Awesome.
3166100	3170500	So, now all my friends have to go out and get a PSP so we can play these games.
3170500	3171500	I have a PSP.
3171500	3172500	Alright, cool.
3172500	3173500	You'll have to play.
3173500	3175540	Oh wait, I need a PlayStation 3 first.
3175540	3176540	I have a PS3.
3176540	3179540	Hey, I'm all set when it comes to rear view mirrors, Kaz.
3179540	3182140	You already have three PSPs, don't you?
3182140	3183140	Exactly.
3183140	3185260	I can see behind me perfectly.
3185260	3188420	Don't you have to have a certain firmware for that to work?
3188420	3189420	What are we talking about?
3189420	3190420	I could be running 3.7.
3190420	3193020	Hey, I want to do a story of you up, can I, can I, huh, huh, huh?
3193020	3194020	You may.
3194020	3200380	Well, recent reports thanks to Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII shows that the PSP sales
3200380	3202420	have surged in Japan.
3202420	3211340	In fact, it's gone up by six times on the previous week, and just to give a list of
3211340	3217580	how performance has been, and that's, again, for the last week.
3217580	3231220	PSP, 95,487 units, DS, 79,974, Wii, 26,181, PS2, 13,128, PS3, 13,121, the PS2's outselling
3231220	3232220	the PS3.
3232220	3233220	That's funny.
3233220	3241740	Xbox 360, 1,243, Game Boy Advance, 836, and they're still selling Gamecubes at 97 units.
3241740	3245240	You know, it's pretty surprising, well, it's not surprising that they've sold so well,
3245240	3249260	because Crisis Core would only run on the PSP Slim, so if you wanted to play it, you
3249260	3250620	had to buy one.
3250620	3251620	Thank you, Sony.
3251620	3252620	Awesome.
3252620	3254060	Whoa, it won't run on an old PSP?
3254060	3255060	No, it won't.
3255060	3256060	Why?
3256060	3257060	Actually-
3257060	3258060	Because it's using the full clock.
3258060	3259060	It's-
3259060	3260060	Crisis Core?
3260060	3261060	Yeah.
3261060	3262060	It will.
3262060	3263060	I've seen side-by-side comparisons of the game.
3263060	3264060	Aha!
3264060	3267060	There's a video file out showing how Crisis Core runs on an old PSP and a new one.
3267060	3268060	That's right, I've seen that.
3268060	3269060	That's right, I've seen that.
3269060	3270060	I thought they said that it wouldn't.
3270060	3275000	It has a higher loading time, and although I thought it was funny that when they showed
3275000	3279620	the demo battles, both battles finished at the same time, even though the PSP one loaded
3279620	3280620	later.
3280620	3283620	Well, I thought that it supported- I thought they needed the, um, 3.6.
3283620	3285340	Well, you thought wrong!
3285340	3288100	Well, this is what I read, okay?
3288100	3289100	Whatever.
3289100	3293580	Well, side-by-side comparisons showed- but the thing that was good about that comparison
3293580	3300500	is that it did show the, uh, better processing power in the, um, in the, uh, new PSPs, but
3300500	3306220	also just another comparison for, uh, software releases in relation to those hardware releases
3306220	3313020	is that, um, Crisis Core, um, of course, was the top seller, followed by, um, Pokemon Fushigi
3313020	3321020	no Dungeon, Tokino, uh, uh, Tonkentai, and also the, uh, Yami no Tonkentai, um, followed
3321020	3327660	by that Fate Tiger Coliseum, Another Centuries Episode 3, the final, Taeko no Satsujin DS,
3327660	3333380	Mario Party 8, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, Ring of Fates, Sengoku Musou 2, Mushoden,
3333380	3336980	and my housekeeping diary, so.
3336980	3337980	That was number 10.
3337980	3338980	Well, the women had to buy something.
3338980	3339980	For sales.
3339980	3342500	No, they were buying Pokemon.
3342500	3343700	I want Crisis Core, though.
3343700	3346180	I apologize to all our female listeners this week after today's episode.
3346180	3347180	You need to apologize to me, Rob.
3347180	3348180	I'm, you know-
3348180	3351780	You need to beg my forgiveness.
3351780	3357220	Dear Dark Sakura the Great and Terrible, I beg upon ye for forgiveness.
3357220	3363060	Buying Crisis Core, you know, would only encourage them to make games like Dirge of Service,
3363060	3364060	so.
3364060	3365060	I like Dirge of Cerberus.
3365060	3367620	Besides, I can't really play Crisis Core right now, it's all in Japanese.
3367620	3368620	Vincent Maycry.
3368620	3369620	Vincent's awesome.
3369620	3371140	But when it comes out in the US, we'll see.
3371140	3374060	I don't mind playing it in Japanese.
3374060	3376220	Next story, please.
3376220	3383380	Anyways, um, so, there's another game that's also gonna be coming out pretty soon in Japan,
3383380	3389020	if you know that game that we thought was free before, oh, but never fear, Sony's here
3389020	3391940	to take a shit on you.
3391940	3401060	Gran Turismo 5 Prologue has been priced in Japan for 4980 yen, and also it will be coming
3401060	3408700	out on Blu-ray as well for a total savings of about five bucks for 4500 yen.
3408700	3414460	I'm sorry, 4980 was the Blu-ray version, 4500 was the download.
3414460	3420620	So yeah, you save five dollars downloading it straight to your PS3.
3420620	3425660	Now I know it's supposed to come with, I think, about 40 cars, and looks pretty nice, but
3425660	3431940	I mean, after all, you are buying pretty much a partial game, I guess, because it's technically
3431940	3433880	kind of like a demo.
3433880	3440040	So 40 bucks for a partially finished game, when you can wait probably a year and play
3440040	3443500	the full game for 60 bucks?
3443500	3446620	I don't know, do people like Gran Turismo 5 that much?
3446620	3451580	But if you're interested, it's coming out December 13th, in Japan, or if you have a
3451580	3455540	Japanese account, you can probably download it over here.
3455540	3457100	But not that you do that, because that's wrong.
3457100	3462820	Fuck no, I'm not gonna pay that, I'm not gonna pay like, what is the equivalent of like $43.10
3462820	3464460	for Gran Turismo 5?
3464460	3466820	I want the full game if I'm gonna be paying that kind of money.
3466820	3471020	Well, Loki, would you pay $69.99 for the Eye of Judgment?
3471020	3475620	Because the Eye of Judgment comes out soon, on October 23rd.
3475620	3476620	It looks funny.
3476620	3477620	For $69.99.
3477620	3482740	Now the good news is, that is the price of the game and the PlayStation Eye, which is
3482740	3483740	the peripheral.
3483740	3487740	Or as we call it here on the program, the Brown Eye of Judgment, that will come with
3487740	3488860	the PlayStation Brown Eye.
3488860	3492760	So if you want to get a Brown Eye for your PlayStation, you can get one on October 23rd
3492760	3494820	for $69.99.
3494820	3499840	You also get a little camera stand with it, but it's called, this is my favorite part,
3499840	3502540	the camera stand is called the Judgment Stand.
3502540	3510820	I'm sorry, I just think of like Judge Judy or something when I see the Judgment Stand.
3510820	3511820	Here come the Judge.
3511820	3518620	Booster, now here's the other thing, okay, there's battle maps that come with it, a starter
3518620	3522060	deck of cards comes with it, and an eight card booster pack.
3522060	3523620	Here's where things get interesting.
3523620	3528400	If you want more booster packs, they'll cost you $3.75 each.
3528400	3533780	You can also get one of five pre-constructed theme packs for $14.99.
3533780	3536920	Now of course, Loki was wondering, well what the hell is going to stop me from making my
3536920	3539060	own cards and using them to play online?
3539060	3540060	Aha!
3540060	3543020	Well, what's going to happen is that you're going to have to pre-register your decks with
3543020	3549360	the game and you put in your serial numbers, I suppose, and then the software will randomly
3549360	3553580	select what cards get drawn next, that way you can't stack the deck.
3553580	3554580	That's stupid.
3554580	3557700	Yeah, I can't, it's stupid.
3557700	3562820	I'm sorry, you know, whereas, okay, maybe the PlayStation Brown Eye can have some future,
3562820	3568860	you know, nobody's really done a decent camera, I mean how long did that Xbox 360 vision thing
3568860	3569940	last?
3569940	3573740	Like it didn't, like it fizzled the moment it hit, because it had, what did it have going
3573740	3574740	for it?
3574740	3575740	Totem Ball.
3575740	3576740	And the fact that you can make your own gamer picks.
3576740	3578860	Let me put it this way, it was as popular as the eye toy.
3578860	3579860	Yeah.
3579860	3586220	Seriously, cameras for systems, I think people just, they're like, ooh, that's kind of cool,
3586220	3588580	and then, ehhh.
3588580	3596700	Eye Toy squeezed out a little more life out of it, the Eye Toy squeezed a little more
3596700	3602020	life out of it, but just because it had DDR probably in, you know, some of the Harry Potter
3602020	3603860	games and things that kids were into.
3603860	3608300	But the Brown Eye's going to need a lot more than the Brown Eye of Judgment to do well,
3608300	3609300	I think.
3609300	3616060	And that's just plain online and stuff, it says via cheating, pre-registering your decks.
3616060	3618220	I mean, people are going to crack that so fast.
3618220	3620100	Well cheat in person all you want.
3620100	3623060	People are going to crack that shit so fast, it's not even funny.
3623060	3624060	Why?
3624060	3628140	Is this on, I ask the cracking and hacking community of the world out there, is this
3628140	3629900	worth hacking?
3629900	3630900	I mean.
3630900	3634700	If you're going to spend $69 on the game, you're of course not going to, I bet you anything
3634700	3640420	those booster packs and theme packs do not sell well, they're hoping that it takes over
3640420	3647140	like Pokemon or Yugioh or Magic or anything like that, and just people are going crazy
3647140	3650760	over the Eye of Judgment and sells tons of systems.
3650760	3654560	They live in this dream world that does not exist, is what the problem is.
3654560	3659600	I agree, however, when I hear about things like that whole SingStar thing will have the
3659600	3664780	camera and you can upload your videos to like a YouTube type service, that sounds interesting.
3664780	3668180	Yeah, it does sound interesting, and here's the other thing, the PlayStation 3 does support
3668180	3672640	other cameras other than the PlayStation Eye, so if you have your own webcam that's USB,
3672640	3676100	why the fuck are you spending money on the PlayStation Eye if you're just going to be
3676100	3683560	using the video camera to upload, why, I don't know why, but uploading yourself singing badly
3683560	3686840	to karaoke to put on this YouTube type thing.
3686840	3690340	If you really need that much attention, you could probably set up your own webcam and
3690340	3695480	put it on the real YouTube, and guess what, that will be free, and more people will probably
3695480	3696480	see it.
3696480	3699680	And you can be angsty about Britney Spears or something, and millions of people will
3699680	3700680	view it.
3700680	3703640	I just, I don't see the point.
3703640	3708520	I mean, the PlayStation Eye of Judgment is as bad as I thought it was, so.
3708520	3712120	Alright, well if you plan on purchasing the Eye of Judgment, we'd love to hear from you,
3712120	3713120	mailbagorangeonstrader.com.
3713120	3714220	I want to know why.
3714220	3718520	If you're going to camp out at midnight to buy it, we especially want to hear from you.
3718520	3720100	Why?
3720100	3721360	That's just what I want to know why.
3721360	3725240	I hope I get one for free, but I know I won't.
3725240	3728240	Even if you get one for free, I think you should destroy it live on our program.
3728240	3731320	They did show off the Eye of Judgment at their conference.
3731320	3734560	Loki, Loki, Loki, if you get a brown Eye of Judgment for free, can we destroy it on the
3734560	3735560	program?
3735560	3736560	Sure.
3736560	3737560	Hooray!
3737560	3738560	Destroy destruction!
3738560	3739560	Oh, I want the camera.
3739560	3740560	We'll set something up outside.
3740560	3746760	I want to play the game and then, like, in the middle of the game, set the thing on fire.
3746760	3750720	Like, if you're playing someone online and then you're, like, dealing another card, they'll
3750720	3752440	go, fuck this shit.
3752440	3753440	Whoosh.
3753440	3755440	We're totally going to do that.
3755440	3756440	That'll be hilarious.
3756440	3757440	We will totally do that.
3757440	3761360	We'll set something up where we can start a small fire and it'll be safe, and we will
3761360	3765840	set the PlayStation Eye on fire live during a match on the PlayStation Online store.
3765840	3767200	I love this idea.
3767200	3768340	I love it.
3768340	3770320	I like anything that involves fire, Rob.
3770320	3771320	All right.
3771320	3772320	Awesome.
3772320	3773320	Well, how about something that doesn't suck?
3773320	3774320	All right.
3774320	3775320	How about it?
3775320	3778560	Metal Gear Solid 4, which is full of happy and joy.
3778560	3789280	Kojima was saying that the Metal Gear Online experience is going to include a starter pack.
3789280	3793640	Trying to look through this to see exactly what this starter pack is.
3793640	3795480	It's like an online starter pack.
3795480	3799200	I'm not seeing anything too specific, but maybe it's...
3799200	3801640	This is like a glorious demo of the game.
3801640	3802640	Yeah.
3802640	3804640	Can I say this real quick while you're...
3804640	3805640	Yeah.
3805640	3809840	Oh, you can roll over enemies in a barrel.
3809840	3813960	Somebody in chat sent me a message, this is hilarious, SSJ100Matt says, if the Eye of
3813960	3821000	Judgment becomes a success, Loki must promise to dress up as Tingle.
3821000	3822880	I will take that bet because I know...
3822880	3823880	Whoa!
3823880	3824880	He took the bet!
3824880	3828280	Ladies and gentlemen, everybody must go out.
3828280	3833520	You record, time stamp this, record it, put it in the archive, the bet has been taken.
3833520	3837200	Okay, now we have to wait, hold on now, we need to set the parameters here now.
3837200	3838600	You said a success.
3838600	3843160	What do you mean exactly by a success because that's very general and very broad.
3843160	3846440	It needs to sell like say a million units, how about that?
3846440	3847440	Is that a success?
3847440	3848440	Yes.
3848440	3851760	If the Eye of Judgment sells a million units, Loki will dress up as Tingle.
3851760	3854760	I will dress up as Tingle.
3854760	3859040	I guarantee you, if that thing sells a million copies, which it will not.
3859040	3860040	Wait, worldwide or domestic?
3860040	3863660	You gotta be specific because the damn thing could take off in Japan.
3863660	3864660	You never know.
3864660	3867040	I will even, I'll go as far as saying worldwide.
3867040	3868040	Holy shit!
3868040	3869040	Holy shit!
3869040	3870040	I don't think it will do anything.
3870040	3872440	I don't know how many billion people in the world.
3872440	3876160	That's like saying one in four people buys this thing that owns a Playstation 3 and there's
3876160	3878220	no way that's going to happen.
3878220	3881360	Suddenly everybody in chat has just preordered the Eye of Judgment.
3881360	3882360	Go right ahead.
3882360	3885520	Worldwide, I bet you anything that will not sell a million copies.
3885520	3889800	Wait, we have to set a deadline here because a million copies could happen like eight years
3889800	3890800	from now or something.
3890800	3891800	Okay, six months after release.
3891800	3892800	Six months, okay.
3892800	3893800	That's six months after release.
3893800	3894800	If it sells a million units...
3894800	3897800	One million copies worldwide within six months.
3897800	3900440	Alright, you got it.
3900440	3901440	Don't forget chat room.
3901440	3902740	Don't let him forget this.
3902740	3907040	You are all witnesses and I will take many, many videos.
3907040	3908040	Oh, goddamn.
3908040	3911300	I'm even going to go out and buy the Eye of Judgment now just to destroy it and get us
3911300	3912300	one step closer.
3912300	3913300	You're dressing up as Tingle on YouTube.
3913300	3915480	To Loki dressing up as YouTube.
3915480	3918040	Dressing up as Tingle on the whole thing being put on YouTube.
3918040	3919040	Here's the best part.
3919040	3925960	If it sells a million units, Loki will be dressed up as Tingle burning on fire and no
3925960	3927360	one will get it.
3927360	3930160	Can you imagine our poor opponent?
3930160	3935320	Okay, cosplayers who listen to the show will be sending you measurements.
3935320	3936500	Here's the thing.
3936500	3939920	We have to be playing Bobby Black Wolf when it happens and nobody tell them what's going
3939920	3945240	to happen because Bobby was your first friend on the PlayStation 3, so nobody tell Black
3945240	3946800	Wolf what we're up to.
3946800	3947800	Is he going to buy that?
3947800	3948800	But he'll be the one.
3948800	3949800	I don't know.
3949800	3952040	We'll send him a copy just to make this happen, okay?
3952040	3954520	How about to go back to Metal Gear Solid 4?
3954520	3955520	I'm sorry, yes.
3955520	3956520	I'm still cracking up.
3956520	3959200	They're basically saying that some of the gameplay that's going to be involved in that
3959200	3963960	little demo was like it was saying rolling over enemies with a barrel and then shooting
3963960	3966680	people into the air with a cannon.
3966680	3967680	That's fun.
3967680	3968680	Yeah.
3968680	3971160	Is he going to do those moves like he does in Super Smash Brothers where he comes up
3971160	3975600	behind somebody and looks like he's about to, you know, ass rape them?
3975600	3976600	He does that in all the other games.
3976600	3977600	Why not?
3977600	3978600	Alright.
3978600	3979600	Sounds like fun.
3979600	3980600	Anyways.
3980600	3981600	Sorry.
3981600	3983200	I had too good of a laugh.
3983200	3989320	In case you don't get enough of browsing the PlayStation 3 store because, you know, there's
3989320	3995540	a whole lot to look at on there, you will now also have the ability to browse the store
3995540	3997800	on the PC soon.
3997800	4008440	So, you'll be able to purchase PSP content without using the PS3 and also, I think that's
4008440	4014440	all it's being used for right now is basically PSP content because I guess a lot of people,
4014440	4019560	you know, don't have a PS3 so if they want to download those, really, a lot of people
4019560	4020560	don't have a PlayStation 3.
4020560	4021560	Yeah.
4021560	4022560	I know.
4022560	4023560	It's surprising.
4023560	4025640	If they want to download those, you know, PS1 games, now they can do that.
4025640	4026640	So, hooray!
4026640	4032200	Well, the thing that got everybody excited about a PlayStation 3 earlier this year was
4032200	4036960	PlayStation Home and if you were hoping to play PlayStation Home this year, you better
4036960	4040960	hope you're in the beta because otherwise, you're not playing it until spring of 2008.
4040960	4043240	Oh, something delayed on the PlayStation 3.
4043240	4044240	I know.
4044240	4045240	Who would have thunk it?
4045240	4046240	Really?
4046240	4048960	This bombshell was announced by Kazurai during the Tokyo Game Show press conference.
4048960	4051200	You want to know something else that was delayed?
4051200	4053960	Seriously, everything that comes out on the PlayStation 3 has been delayed lately.
4053960	4060280	I mean, like, Skate came out a couple weeks later, was it Stunt Magnition came out almost
4060280	4064580	a month later, Stranglehold's been delayed again to the end of October now.
4064580	4068280	Which just goes to show the PlayStation 3 should have waited before it released.
4068280	4070080	But anyway, that's old news now.
4070080	4071960	It should have released this year.
4071960	4076120	But for guys of twos coming out, it'll go a month later?
4076120	4080680	You know, here's the thing though, despite all the shit I'm talking about it, if it's
4080680	4083320	that awesome, maybe it'll be worth the wait.
4083320	4089360	You know, I'd rather they do release it bug-free or with as few bugs as possible and just really
4089360	4093940	awesome and the killer app to have for the PlayStation rather than them rush it to make
4093940	4094940	it for this year.
4094940	4095940	Right?
4095940	4100280	They'll eventually decide to charge for it once, you know, it's been so long.
4100280	4101740	It might be worth it.
4101740	4103320	That's a big might.
4103320	4104320	Big might.
4104320	4105320	But it might be worth it.
4105320	4106320	It has potential.
4106320	4107640	But we'll see.
4107640	4112120	Meanwhile, I still have no reason to get a PlayStation 3 until Final Fantasy 13 comes
4112120	4113260	out.
4113260	4116580	So that's all I have to say on PlayStation Home.
4116580	4117580	Being delayed.
4117580	4123180	Well, for those who are keeping up with some of the news out of Togo Game Show, there is
4123180	4129280	a new Kingdom Hearts, well, more I would say addition to the Kingdom Hearts franchise to
4129280	4133900	be out on DS, PSP, and mobile phones.
4133900	4140240	There is going to be Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep for the PSP.
4140240	4144720	It's a single player RPG like the PS2 one.
4144720	4153640	Kingdom Hearts 3, 58 slash 2 days for the DS, which is a 3D game with Roxas.
4153640	4157000	And it also will have a four-way multiplayer mode.
4157000	4162160	And the last one is Kingdom Hearts Coded that is on mobile phones.
4162160	4163560	Coded sounds actually pretty cool.
4163560	4167880	It's like the original Kingdom Hearts game, but you can almost like edit the worlds or
4167880	4169240	something as you're playing through it.
4169240	4172640	It's like the Matrix and Kingdom Hearts together.
4172640	4175920	That actually though, after playing Kingdom Hearts 2, at least from the beginning of it
4175920	4180440	makes perfect sense if it's like set in, you know, I don't want to spoil it for anyone,
4180440	4182360	but if it's set like in dude's computer.
4182360	4183360	Hmm.
4183360	4185640	Remember with Roxas and all that.
4185640	4187120	I never beat Kingdom Hearts 2.
4187120	4188120	But you did play it from the beginning, right?
4188120	4189120	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4189120	4190120	Oh, yeah, yeah.
4190120	4191120	So you know what I'm talking about.
4191120	4192120	Yeah, I do.
4192120	4193120	I do.
4193120	4194120	I'm looking forward to the games.
4194120	4195120	I'll check them out.
4195120	4196120	I mean, hopefully they're better than Chain of Memories.
4196120	4200560	But as long as the Disney stuff stays intact, because that's the one thing that always worries
4200560	4201560	me.
4201560	4204280	It worried me about that Final Mix trailer or whatever it was at the end of Kingdom Hearts
4204280	4205280	2.
4205280	4207380	Like it was very, very not Disney related.
4207380	4210000	And to me, that's a big charm of the series.
4210000	4215040	You know, come on, Tron World was like the awesomest part of Kingdom Hearts 2.
4215040	4221940	So as long as the games aren't totally deviating from the Disney stuff, I think it'll be okay.
4221940	4225080	It's very interesting that everything's going handheld, especially with Squeenix between
4225080	4226560	this and Dragon Quest IX.
4226560	4231080	I'd be surprised if Final Fantasy XIV wasn't for the DS.
4231080	4232080	We'll see.
4232080	4236280	Well, one good thing we can say about the PlayStation 3 is that it has really helped
4236280	4237720	the Folding at Home project.
4237720	4245200	In fact, they have made the milestone achievement of reaching one petroflop.
4245200	4250040	That's one quadrillion floating point operations per second.
4250040	4257200	And basically, it would take everyone in the world 75,000 calculations in a second to achieve
4257200	4259640	a similar result.
4259640	4263460	So that's pretty awesome.
4263460	4265360	But have they found the cure for cancer yet?
4265360	4266360	No.
4266360	4267360	So what good is a petroflop?
4267360	4268360	If the program has...
4268360	4269360	No, I'm just kidding.
4269360	4270360	I think it's a fun little project.
4270360	4272560	I like those distributed things.
4272560	4275480	You know, there's actually an OL Army for Folding at Home, and I tried running it on
4275480	4279920	my computer for a while, but it conflicts with World of Warcraft.
4279920	4281800	Like you can't run them both at the same time.
4281800	4282800	Priorities, Rob.
4282800	4286760	World of Warcraft is clearly more important than cancer.
4286760	4288760	Absolutely.
4288760	4293000	Going to comments from chat, they're a little bit delayed, so sometimes we report on the
4293000	4294000	last story.
4294000	4298520	TheRobD says, Skye, none of the Kingdom Hearts 2 stuff had Disney stuff in there either,
4298520	4300600	so Kingdom Hearts will have Disney.
4300600	4303960	And WonderDocHerald says, singing along with the Little Mermaid was the best part of Kingdom
4303960	4304960	Hearts 2.
4304960	4306820	Not Tron, but the Little Mermaid.
4306820	4311820	This part sucks because the songs were awful, but, the original songs, but they were even
4311820	4315080	worse in Japanese.
4315080	4317240	But the Little Mermaid has awesome music.
4317240	4320100	Well, the songs that were from the Little Mermaid were good, but the ones that they
4320100	4322240	made up for the game sucked ass.
4322240	4324120	The Japanese ones were pretty.
4324120	4328720	Yeah, but the songs were actually worse in Japanese, including the originals.
4328720	4332120	And TheRobD just wanted to clarify, he meant the trailers.
4332120	4336040	Well yeah, I got that, but hopefully the listeners did too.
4336040	4340600	And Ghost in our chat room says, World of Warcraft causes cancer.
4340600	4346040	If you're smoking and playing WoW at the same time, which I've seen people do, it just might.
4346040	4347360	And drinking.
4347360	4350840	Then you're going to have all sorts of problems.
4350840	4357000	Well, the MotorStorm developers are not going to have a problem making money anymore, because
4357000	4359120	they just got bought from Sony.
4359120	4364180	Sony bought Evolution Studios, and it's a subsidiary of BigBig Studios.
4364180	4369000	They made Pursuit Force, but of course Evolution Studios were the makers of MotorStorm, and
4369000	4371880	lots of Sony fans are very happy with the game MotorStorm, and Sony's very happy with
4371880	4373000	it too.
4373000	4377400	Evolution has also unveiled that since they've been purchased, they've also been given the
4377400	4380120	go-ahead to make MotorStorm 2.
4380120	4385680	Which, as a side note, Nintendo, make Excite Truck 2.
4385680	4386680	You want them to make it?
4386680	4387680	My wife demands it.
4387680	4388680	Excite Truck 2?
4388680	4390140	Excite Truck 2.
4390140	4391140	Or Excite something else.
4391140	4394680	So it could be like Excite Boat, I don't know.
4394680	4395680	No.
4395680	4396760	That won't work.
4396760	4399800	We do not need another Hydro Thunder.
4399800	4404840	Well, when I think of what a cool...how about Cobra Triangle on the Wii?
4404840	4405840	That game was awesome.
4405840	4406840	I played that game.
4406840	4407840	Cobra Triangle was so awful.
4407840	4408840	It was so awful.
4408840	4409840	Rad.
4409840	4410840	Shut up!
4410840	4413920	Cobra Triangle was like RC Pro-Am mixed with Gradius in boats.
4413920	4415560	How is that a bad thing, I ask you?
4415560	4416560	I don't know.
4416560	4418600	This is pretty bad.
4418600	4422880	By the way, Big Big Studios is already making Pursuit Force Extreme Justice.
4422880	4423880	That should be fun.
4423880	4424880	That should be fun.
4424880	4425880	That should be fun.
4425880	4426880	Next week or two.
4426880	4427880	Yeah.
4427880	4428880	Very cool.
4428880	4432120	Well, congrats, Sony, on your marriage with these new companies.
4432120	4433120	Congrats to Dark Sakura.
4433120	4434600	Let the humping start.
4434600	4439240	Congrats to Dark Sakura for finding yet another website to share with our listeners tonight.
4439240	4443240	And this is the next to the last website of the week segment.
4443240	4444240	Can you believe it?
4444240	4445240	I know.
4445240	4451120	I should say next week will be Dark Sakura's final website of the week because in the next
4451120	4454520	series of episodes, starting with 250, she's going to be doing the classic game of the
4454520	4455520	week.
4455520	4456520	Yep.
4456520	4457520	Which will be fun.
4457520	4460520	So until then, though, she surfs the internet up and down, finding her last few websites
4460520	4461600	to share with you.
4461600	4463120	She's got one for you this week.
4463120	4466720	Take it away, Miss Dark Sakura.
4466720	4471020	The website of the week is actually one given to me by Sauce.
4471020	4472020	It's retrojunk.com.
4472020	4473020	R-E-T-R-O-J-U-N-E.
4473020	4474020	Retrojunk.com.
4474020	4480400	And this site is the best ever, ever.
4480400	4485640	You have everything from old TV show intros to commercials, including video game commercials.
4485640	4491720	Oh my God, Rob, I found out that a game that I love that was a PC game was actually on
4491720	4495640	the Turbo Duo and now I have to find it even though it's 30 bucks on eBay.
4495640	4496640	Dang.
4496640	4497640	What game was that?
4497640	4498640	Loom.
4498640	4499640	Loom is rad.
4499640	4500640	I love Loom.
4500640	4501640	Good choice.
4501640	4506840	But there's, in fact, on their main page, I actually have an article about the Sega
4506840	4510560	Master System, which I don't know if anyone knows, the Sega Master System was actually
4510560	4515440	still going pretty strong in Brazil for a very long time with a lot of games that came
4515440	4522280	out on 16-bit and later coming out over there on this 8-bit system.
4522280	4523280	Lots of really cool stuff.
4523280	4530480	I mean, just some of the TV intros listed on the main page is Danger Mouse and Voltron
4530480	4533280	Hunter, Robocop.
4533280	4538320	The commercials listed are old Nickelodeon commercials from 1982.
4538320	4539320	That's awesome.
4539320	4540320	Private Benjamin.
4540320	4543960	And I'm sure YouTube just makes this shit even better now because everything's on YouTube
4543960	4544960	now.
4544960	4548600	Actually, all of this stuff, from what I understand, I don't think these are links out of YouTube
4548600	4550120	but hosted on their own thing and all the...
4550120	4551120	Oh, cool.
4551120	4553880	As much of the stuff on there is actually pretty damn good quality.
4553880	4554880	Nice.
4554880	4558620	One thing that I was actually watching the Voltron went, oh my God, there's an article
4558620	4562200	on here that's 80s movies you hate to love and it's got a picture of Shona from The Last
4562200	4563200	Dragon.
4563200	4564200	Shona.
4564200	4566200	Who's the master?
4566200	4567200	Shona.
4567200	4568200	Yep.
4568200	4572640	And some of the trailers on here is like The Brave Little Toaster and King Kong versus
4572640	4573640	Godzilla.
4573640	4574640	Wow.
4574640	4581040	This is pretty cool and it has stuff dating back to the 60s, 70s, 80s, I think 60s but
4581040	4587680	definitely the 70s, 80s, and 90s and lots of just really awesome retro stuff.
4587680	4588680	Pretty fun.
4588680	4594680	What I was trying to mention is that I went back to watch the Voltron one and it actually
4594680	4598040	had the Go Lion intro and outro on it.
4598040	4599240	A lot of the chat room seems...
4599240	4600840	And David the Gnome, Logie.
4600840	4604520	A lot of the chat room gives your website of the week their seal of approval.
4604520	4606160	I'll be linking this in the chat room.
4606160	4610400	Also, if anyone is curious, there also is a forum on here.
4610400	4614120	It looks like they are talking about, oh, do you remember this?
4614120	4616040	Do you want to see this?
4616040	4618400	I'm trying to remember the name of this show.
4618400	4619400	That type of thing.
4619400	4620400	And there is one on here.
4620400	4622480	This is which video game songs made you tear up.
4622480	4623480	Aww.
4623480	4626240	I had one that made me cry.
4626240	4627240	What's that?
4627240	4628240	It was Eyes On Me.
4628240	4629240	Aww.
4629240	4630240	Final Fantasy VIII.
4630240	4631240	Whimp.
4631240	4632240	Just kidding.
4632240	4633240	I'm a girl.
4633240	4634240	I'm allowed.
4634240	4635240	No, I was getting...
4635240	4636240	To bite my ass, Rob.
4636240	4637440	I was getting a little choked up at Eternal Sonata.
4637440	4639200	I didn't cry but I was getting a little choked up.
4639200	4640200	I was getting va-clempt.
4640200	4641200	Eternal Sonata...
4641200	4642200	Talk amongst yourselves.
4642200	4645360	Eternal Sonata made me a little va-clempt.
4645360	4646360	Eternal Sonata.
4646360	4649160	Neither Eternal nor Sonata.
4649160	4650160	Disgust.
4650160	4651160	555-4444.
4651160	4652160	Anyhow.
4652160	4653160	Yeah.
4653160	4658600	Loki, please save this program.
4658600	4660200	What is Africa?
4660200	4666560	Sure, we know it's a continent in the world, but really, what is Africa the game?
4666560	4672960	Well, it is a Pokemon Snap type of Jungle Safari game where you drive around and you
4672960	4674280	take pictures of wildlife.
4674280	4675280	That's awesome!
4675280	4676280	Africa.
4676280	4678560	No, I totally want to play that.
4678560	4680280	So it's Africa Snap?
4680280	4681280	Apparently, yeah.
4681280	4682280	Rad!
4682280	4683280	No, I totally...
4683280	4687920	The only, only way I will play this game, and goddamn it, this better be possible, and
4687920	4692760	I know it's won't be because they're going to pussy out, is if I can't drive my Jeep
4692760	4699560	all over the savanna, destroying wildlife as it rolls underneath my tires.
4699560	4704080	That is the only way I will play this game.
4704080	4705960	They're going to put the fucking things on a track.
4705960	4706960	You know it.
4706960	4707960	Just like in Pokemon Snap.
4707960	4710960	Because you would have tried to run over all the Pokemon, too.
4710960	4711960	Yes.
4711960	4715560	I'm totally going to play this game.
4715560	4718800	I fished out money for the Cardcaptor Sakura game just because I thought it was like Pokemon
4718800	4719800	Snap.
4719800	4721440	That, and I wanted a clock and a plate.
4721440	4722700	Pokemon Snap is fucking rad.
4722700	4724400	It's like one of the most underrated games in my opinion.
4724400	4726360	The Cardcaptor Sakura game, however, is not.
4726360	4730120	But it comes with a clock and a plate, a knife, a fork, spoon, and...
4730120	4731920	Does it have a little wand you can wave?
4731920	4733920	No, and a pillowcase.
4733920	4737200	It was on Dreamcast.
4737200	4743160	Rama says the game should be like Jumbo Safari, and I agree, because Jumbo Safari is awesome.
4743160	4744880	Let's see.
4744880	4749040	Tiger Claw says, I'm more curious how the AI in the game is like.
4749040	4751600	Like if you see a pride of lion, will it show them getting it on?
4751600	4752600	Of course, mine doesn't...
4752600	4754320	Well, it shows them eating something.
4754320	4757000	I want to see blood in this game.
4757000	4758000	Eating smaller animals.
4758000	4759480	I want M-rated Africa.
4759480	4766560	We want monkeys flinging poo, lions doing it, and lots of carnivorous death.
4766560	4771160	The Rob D. says, is Debbie Downer today saying, I don't think Africa is going to be a sandbox
4771160	4772160	GTA game.
4772160	4776400	I don't know why they're like making this out to be like a big game for the Playstation
4776400	4777400	3.
4777400	4780200	It's just like, it's going to be yet another disappointment.
4780200	4784280	Yet another average game where it's like, look, it's the most realistic African safari
4784280	4785280	ever!
4785280	4787020	And then people will be like, so?
4787020	4788520	We need people to actually get shot though.
4788520	4792160	I'm not buying your fucking $600 system for an African safari.
4792160	4793160	Fuck you.
4793160	4796320	Mr. DeBucket says, Africa is a former Hot Shots Golf 5 minigame.
4796320	4798440	You used to shoot gold balls at the animal.
4798440	4800400	That must be weird.
4800400	4806080	Someone, uh, GS68 was bringing up, uh, Let's Go Jungle, a rail shooter where you shoot
4806080	4807080	the wildlife.
4807080	4812240	If you want to join in the fun, chat.orangelandrager.com where we do take live on Sunday nights.
4812240	4814280	I did not want to kill the animals.
4814280	4817200	I wanted to see the animals killing other animals.
4817200	4818200	That's right.
4818200	4821320	Like I said, carnivorous death.
4821320	4825760	They need, the monkeys need to be out, you know, picking each other's fleas and eating
4825760	4826920	them.
4826920	4832760	And the, all the animals need to be out doing it and giving birth and eating other animals.
4832760	4833760	While I plan on...
4833760	4834920	And they need evil giraffes.
4834920	4836880	Here's the perfect way to derail the show.
4836880	4838440	Screw Africa.
4838440	4843520	It's all about laser cats to the game for Playstation 3.
4843520	4845880	Where is my laser cats next gen game?
4845880	4851480	I, I, can you, I mean, this lolcats thing on the internet, you know, the I can ass cheeseburgers
4851480	4854680	of the world and all that stuff, the lolcats, has really become this little phenomenon.
4854680	4857240	How come the video game industry is not cashing in on the lolcats?
4857240	4858240	Oh, don't worry.
4858240	4859240	They're a little bit behind.
4859240	4862400	I mean, after all, they're making them with that stupid crazy frog racer thing.
4862400	4867160	Well, I feel like Space Giraffe was the closest thing I got to a lolcats game because some
4867160	4869120	of the comments it would make was like lolcats.
4869120	4872240	I want a lolcats game.
4872240	4874560	Mr. DeBucket says we need a ceiling cat game.
4874560	4875560	Winner!
4875560	4876560	It's a ceiling cat game.
4876560	4882560	But, but, if you've been on cat macros on LiveJournal lately, it's all nothing but fucking
4882560	4884880	ceiling cat lately.
4884880	4892360	Everyone is picking any word that ends in eight and making a ceiling cat macro to it.
4892360	4896360	Like ceiling cat is watching you masticate or fornicate or abbreviate.
4896360	4901040	But my favorite one, someone, two people did this, they did one with Daleks and it says
4901040	4903720	ceiling cat is watching you exterminate.
4903720	4907000	That was great.
4907000	4910500	There's one with Bill O'Reilly, ceiling cat is watching you bloviate.
4910500	4914580	Um, let's see where's, there was one that was like, there were some of the older ones,
4914580	4916760	one of these was like a marathon post.
4916760	4917760	Yeah.
4917760	4919260	It had like everything.
4919260	4923720	And one of them is ceiling cat is watching you look for words that end in eight.
4923720	4928200	Ceiling cat is watching you cogigate, ceiling cat is watching you regurgitate.
4928200	4931880	Ceiling cat is watching you vegetate, ceiling cat is watching you spin a plate.
4931880	4934280	Sealing Cat is watching you precipitate.
4934280	4937160	Sealing Cat is watching you perm- permutate.
4937160	4938720	Sealing Cat is watching you oblivious.
4938720	4942320	With Harry Potter reference there, Sealing Cat is watching you percolate at a Starbucks
4942320	4943320	there.
4943320	4945720	Sealing Cat is watching you animate with The Simpsons.
4945720	4948440	This is my favorite, the little truck.
4948440	4950640	Sealing Cat is watching you compensate.
4950640	4955080	Anyway, I'll link that in chat, because I'm sure the podcast answers are like.
4955080	4956440	I like Sealing Cat is doing a figure eight.
4956440	4958280	Dude, what the hell did I sign up for?
4958280	4960300	Yeah, and Wunderdog Harold is right on.

4980580	4990380	it ceiling cat is watching this show suck no I didn't end at eight sorry well
4990380	4994620	what can always what can save a show from going downhill is a good old story
4994620	5001580	that relates to porn or in this sense erotic miss in World of Warcraft that's
5001580	5007380	right an erotic role-playing guild that was spanned across two realms has been
5007380	5012980	disabled by blizzard blizzard forcibly disbanded the guild but of course they
5012980	5017460	just went and made it under a new name the guild abhorrent taboo is a horrid
5017460	5023300	side RP guild on Ravenholtz a Ravenholt which is almost the name of the server I
5023300	5029660	play on Ravencrest it had an alliance chapter on Blackwater Raiders here was
5029660	5034380	their welcome message on their forums quote role-playing is legal even if you
5034380	5037140	are role-playing something that wouldn't be considered deplorable and highly
5037140	5040580	illegal in real life it's still just role-playing it isn't subject to any
5040580	5044460	form of disciplinary action negative publicity is still publicity make a dig
5044460	5047700	or website about how sick we are reporters to perverted justice all it
5047700	5051700	does is bring in more members in fact the dig guy on Ravenholt made us made
5051700	5055460	about us was so effective several people signed up for a while just to be in our
5055460	5058420	guild the bottom line is we're allowed to do what we want on any server we
5058420	5062860	please and no one can do anything about it and those types of things by the way
5062860	5069780	would be extreme sexual situations meaning sometimes with folks that are
5069780	5074980	under 18 blah blah blah cetera cetera use your imagination here yeah but it's
5074980	5080620	all in game it's all fake anyways so are you saying it's okay it's all in game
5080620	5083820	they're not going out and actually having sex with like children or
5083820	5088100	something like that unless if they are then that's you know wrong but it's all
5088100	5094740	in game I mean let let them end up on an episode of like you know was it a date
5094740	5099180	line or something like that yeah you know I'm kind of torn on this is that
5099180	5103660	you know I do believe censorship is wrong at the same time there's probably
5103660	5106860	some pretty I mean there might be some normal people that are trying to you
5106860	5109180	know this gives a bad name to role players everywhere is what it really
5109180	5113620	does but you know on the same time blizzard has the right to do whatever
5113620	5118820	they want with their servers all they need to do is go second life I mean come
5118820	5124740	on I mean way back away worse than what we're doing to which mr. de bucket says
5124740	5128700	pedo bear is watching you play World of Warcraft I guess that's a play on
5128700	5134420	ceiling cat I have no idea huh no pet a bear you don't get it and yeah yeah I
5134420	5138820	get it I guess it's been going on for a while is that I you know I never noticed
5138820	5142460	these guys in game but folks have been petitioning customer service and posting
5142460	5146500	in the suggestion forms wanting people to do stuff about this extreme role play
5146500	5151980	and finally this guild was forcibly disbanded and we'll see if there's a
5151980	5156100	comment from blizzard here oh yes quote this matter is not one blizzard takes
5156100	5159820	likely in air lightly in any way shape or form we do not wish to have this
5159820	5163460	topic continue circulation let it finally be said that we appreciate those
5163460	5166460	of you who brought this particular issue to our attention and it will continue to
5166460	5169340	follow up with this matter in the future to ensure the safety of all parties is
5169340	5173820	concerned by the way the guild is reformed their new name is vile and a
5173820	5180140	FEMA anathema anathema I mean what does that even mean I don't know and it means
5180140	5188860	it's a front cute well there you go I don't know if I'd really call that
5188860	5196260	erotic in Wow just kind of crazies people in Wow crazies I'm curious what
5196260	5200580	you guys in the chat room think chat orange lounge radio.com a legend of
5200580	5204900	Zaku says Loki I'm sorry but speaking in a sexually suggestive manner to a minor
5204900	5211060	is not protected speech by the way what dictionary definition a thing that is
5211060	5217180	detested or loathed cursed or consigned to damnation or destruction at least they
5217180	5222500	have a sense of humor about it interesting well you know what I only
5222500	5225500	blame the parents because they should be watching them what their kids are doing
5225500	5229740	amen to that hmm good point all right I don't want to talk about this while
5229740	5235420	guild anymore I'm done are you spent yes I'm spent well this is the best thing I
5235420	5239900	think to ever be control to be controlled to be invented is the ps2
5239900	5246660	nerf wireless controller I some I think it's actually dark test yeah I think
5246660	5250640	posted a link in live journal about this and I want one so I can throw my
5250640	5253860	controller at the screen and not break my spleen in my TV you know lots of
5253860	5259460	people do that throw their controllers everywhere so art I mean seriously the
5259460	5264840	to read the description on gamestop.com the nerf wireless controller from
5264840	5269500	pelican allows gamers to play like a pro baller on their PlayStation 2 the
5269500	5272700	controllers are made from soft pliable nerf material on the outside but feature
5272700	5277340	legendary pelican performance on the inside legendary mass they are tough
5277340	5281380	enough to withstand hardcore squeezing throwing twisting spiking and feel like
5281380	5286100	no other controller on the market and there's retail for $24.99 I thought
5286100	5290900	those came out like a long time ago I don't know if they did but I want one
5290900	5295420	maybe it's a new version or something who knows they're kind of ugly but
5295420	5304420	adorable mm-hmm like an ugly baby all right and on that note I think we'll
5304420	5307460	bring part a to a close we've gone long tonight on part a I guess we have a lot
5307460	5311160	to say so we're gonna take a quick break and we'll be back with more of Orange
