14087	25147	Tonight, September 23rd, 2007, a highly anticipated Wii game is going online, Sony goes back to good vibrations, and have we finally figured out what the game Africa is all about?
31502	35984	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36024	42747	We are that video game program dedicated to video games, gaming, gamer culture, the gamer lifestyle, and boobs.
43067	43787	Right, DarkSakura?
44047	44747	Yes, I have some.
44968	46108	Alright, congratulations.
46268	46688	Thank you.
46868	47529	I'll tell my mom.
47749	48029	Alright.
48849	52113	Yes, please tell her about the show you do on the internet where we talked about your boobs tonight.
52153	53916	I'm sure she'll really appreciate that.
53976	54837	You've called her.
55317	55638	I know.
55718	58341	That was an old OLR stunt.
58361	59162	That was old news.
59322	60103	That was yesterday's news.
60123	61525	Let's not call my mom today, okay?
61545	62386	Alright, probably not.
63444	66606	Also joining us, the man with no boobs, and that's a good thing, Loki.
66866	67266	Hello.
67626	68206	How you doing, Loki?
68526	68766	Fine.
69387	69707	Awesome.
70127	75729	And it's just the three of us here in studio tonight, just, you know, feeling the love between the three of us, since there's no guests to speak of tonight.
76269	79671	Miklatov sadly moved back to Kansas, so he's not going to be on the show for a long time.
79711	82212	He might be back in December for a little bit, but we won't have him on for a while.
82805	84907	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
112358	113659	I started playing a game again.
114579	117699	One that I played for a very, very, very, very, very long time.
117779	119380	Ooh, did you get into Final Fantasy XI again, too?
119940	120500	Fuck no!
121600	123441	I'm playing Ragnarok Online again.
123561	124041	Heal, please.
124621	129222	Oh, what are you... Because you were a white mage in Final Fantasy XI, so... What are you playing as in Ragnarok now?
129922	133403	Well, I started off with a ninja, and they kind of suck.
134143	136384	So I went back to my old standby of Assassin.
138132	143795	and right now I am at level 7947, I think.
144956	145736	Uh-huh.
145977	147297	79 base, 47 job.
147457	147858	Sheesh.
147978	148498	Assassin.
148818	150339	Well, it's a 50-50-50 server.
150759	155982	I haven't played Ragnarok in a long time, so I kind of forget what that means, but it just sounds like borderline addict.
156983	166248	Well, the whole thing about it is that it's very, it's pretty quick leveling, the way that they've got the ratio set up, with lots and lots of loot.
167079	167559	Wait a minute.
167719	169520	You said you're playing on a server that's 50-50-50?
169780	170140	Yeah.
170601	173262	Gravity's going to come in and say, We ban you!
173582	174242	Fuck Gravity.
174342	176123	You're playing on a 50-50 server.
176584	177524	They can't do anything.
177784	182806	And besides that, I can go back to IRO anytime I want to because I was in the beta and they don't delete the beta characters.
182826	183387	Oh, that's good.
183987	186508	So my characters are still sitting there.
187088	189289	And to tell DJ Dark Knight, the...
191940	199263	The ninja class I haven't quite figured out just because I haven't found any good FAQs in English.
199863	203445	And Dark Knight's comment for the record was, ninjas don't suck, Jamie.
203725	205105	It's 50-50-50, by the way.
205866	207426	And what does 50-50-50 mean?
207506	210528	Meaning that it's a higher ratio for leveling.
210608	214049	You get more experience, more loot.
215150	219992	It's more experience for base level, for job level, and for your loot.
220412	220992	It's drop rate.
222367	224968	So, um, it means you get a whole bunch of crap.
225928	231110	And, like, I was already over 400,000 zeny for money, like, in two days.
232730	235871	So, and the thing is that I just don't, like, play and play and play and play.
236251	241613	I play and then sit and do other stuff while I'm talking to people and then go, oh, I'm still logged into Ragnarok and play some more.
242353	244794	And then go, okay, I'm bored, sit, and then go do other stuff.
245695	250196	So, because it's windowed and really easy, I can just leave it running.
250649	251590	And the server's really nice.
251610	255794	I'm playing on Deliverance Online, if anyone... Windowed MMOs for the win.
256154	257255	Windows, yes.
258156	263461	I am going to be quitting World of Warcraft until such a day that I have a PC that works that will run it.
264342	273671	I'm going to be playing Guild Wars instead, because thanks to Plan C, it only took them, like, I'd have to say four business days, I think.
274580	276961	They got me my key restored.
277721	277921	Nice.
278441	280041	And they email it right to you.
280081	280861	Everything's cool.
280941	284782	So I'm going to go... It's really cool.
284822	286623	Instead of just being all like, oh, fuck you.
286723	287783	Your key's broken.
287903	288343	You lose.
288863	294704	They will actually... If you send them a high quality enough image, they will decipher what your key is.
295245	295605	Wow.
296405	296545	And...
298052	299433	They'll give you whatever your key was.
299453	301594	They'll base it off of the one that you were given.
301694	302114	Dang.
302474	303815	So their customer service is really good then, huh?
303835	304055	Oh, yeah.
304175	307577	I wouldn't think that they... I would think most companies would tell you too bad, so sad on the key.
307597	308877	They're really on the ball.
309017	309357	Wow.
309438	310178	Really on the ball.
311078	316281	And I also... We got stuff.
316581	318782	Dan came back from the Game Crazy Manager Conference.
319422	320903	So I'm getting a free Halo 3.
321683	324325	I'm getting a free Heavenly Sword, which I want to play.
324425	325105	I'm looking forward to it.
325469	328010	We got a copy of Jeanne d'Arc already, which I'm going to be playing through.
329771	331411	He got some other games.
331431	332752	We're supposed to be getting Mass Effect.
333532	335493	He said that it looked really, really, really sweet.
335773	337054	Yeah, I'm looking forward to that too.
338634	344577	And then he got to play Dracula X Collection, and he thought it was really cool.
345317	347478	I actually watched a bunch of videos from Tokyo Game Show.
347918	351700	Not from Tokyo Game Show, but from Tokyo Game Show I watched the Knights demo.
352640	359524	But I was watching the footage from Rondo of Blood and it looked really, really, really good.
359804	361265	I think I'm going to be very impressed with it.
362266	364727	And we got a whole bunch of t-shirts that we don't want.
365748	367509	And we're getting a Wii Zapper.
368509	370230	And he came home with a Wii Sword.
370991	372792	So rub it in with all this free shit you're getting.
374278	377260	I'm looking in chat, some folks dissing Heavenly Sword in chat.
377581	379722	Fildo... I don't care, I'm playing it anyway.
379883	380743	I like that name, by the way.
380783	383245	Fildo says, I beat Heavenly Sword in five minutes.
383926	385927	And Mycosynth says, Heavenly Sword isn't all that great.
386908	388409	I don't care, it's free and I'm playing it.
389130	389850	It does look pretty.
390631	391271	Pretty things are good.
391311	393193	Like I said, it's free and I'm playing it.
393213	393593	There you go.
394014	394294	Alright.
395155	395875	Let's go over to Loki.
395975	396836	Loki, how was your gaming week?
397576	399138	My week was a little busy.
400499	400739	Let's see.
401326	404108	Of course at work I've been playing more Saints Row multiplayer.
404168	406570	Now we're doing all Rocket matches, which are pretty fun.
408311	413194	Then of course, you know, the big one, I got Halo 3 early, and you're breaking stuff.
413374	414235	Sorry.
414775	416677	So I actually have already finished the game.
417617	418298	It's kind of short.
419058	429766	Reminds me of, see now, I never really played, I mean, I played Halo once or twice, and I played Halo 2 maybe once or twice, but never through the entire story mode, so...
430802	437027	I think most of the story and the ending and stuff is pretty lost to me as far as the impact, I guess.
437647	439989	But, I don't know.
440129	440570	It was good.
440870	442872	It reminds me a lot of Resistance.
443072	445494	I mean, there's a lot of parallels between this game and that one.
446134	447575	So, I don't know.
448336	448776	How so?
450177	451638	Well, I don't want to give away too much.
451718	452699	I mean, I don't know.
453320	457383	I mean, if anyone's actually heard anything about the game, there's a race called The Flood.
458075	462718	And they remind me a lot of the race of creatures that you fight in Resistance.
465620	466000	I don't know.
466100	467601	The game itself is pretty good.
467841	468342	I liked it.
469743	470783	The multiplayer is pretty fun.
471304	472384	I can't wait to play more of that.
472804	476087	And then co-op, I really want to give a try to some of that.
477367	478268	Overall, it's pretty good.
479008	480389	Definitely not the best game this year.
482182	490128	Definitely not the best looking game this year, but I don't think you really need to have the best graphics to make great games, so it should be good.
490228	494451	And I know that Bungie supports their games pretty well, so I can't wait to see what they do with the rest of it.
496592	499395	Then the last game, well actually there's a few others.
499555	504178	I played Brain Age 2, I bought that for Nelly, and I don't like that game.
504912	506512	I don't like that game because... Why?
507453	511073	The text recognition and the voice recognition are horrible.
511433	512534	They're absolutely horrible.
512614	518635	Like, there's a part where you're having to yell out, you know, rock, paper, scissor, and you're playing that, and you either have to win or lose.
518775	520495	And it did not understand scissor.
520875	526056	I had to, like, go, scissor, scissor, scissor.
526296	528697	And then finally it's like, oh, okay, you got it.
528857	530197	Or it'll just say you got it wrong.
530217	531477	And then there's another one.
531577	534138	It was addition, where you had to, like, insert the...
535805	537506	The operative for a math problem.
537606	543109	So, you know, I'd draw a plus or something, and it would think it's a multiplication, like an X or something.
543149	544710	I'm like, that does not look like an X at all.
545170	557076	Or, there's another one that wanted me to spell out stuff, to like create a word, and I was trying to draw a B. And I mean, it looks like a B, and it thinks I'm drawing like a D or like something else.
557136	558737	It can't recognize my handwriting.
559361	559861	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
583360	585141	So, it was interesting.
585581	587422	There was actually hardly anyone there.
587502	592605	I mean, they had enough stations for about, I would say, 20 people to play at once.
593286	596087	They had like five different setups, so it was pretty easy to get in there.
597148	603371	The problem I had, and hopefully this is not reflecting the final product, is that guitar, man.
603811	605832	There were some issues with that strum bar.
605872	607894	It just was not working at all.
607934	610315	I mean, I failed two songs on easy, and I mean...
611488	617550	I'm not great, you know, I can do the three keys fine, but this thing was not hitting right at all.
617570	621731	And they were like, well, I don't know if it's the humidity or what, and it wasn't very humid out.
622291	625072	I'm like, there's like barely any humidity in California, people.
625092	628433	I don't know what's the humidity or whatever, but pushing down the strum bar doesn't work.
628453	631434	You gotta pull up sometimes, because the down will stop working.
631454	633114	I'm like, okay.
634134	638736	So, you know, pulling up worked fine, and we ended up playing Tom Sawyer, and that was okay.
639436	639516	Um,
640114	641994	The game itself looks exactly like Guitar Hero.
642074	648476	I mean, if you've seen Guitar Hero and you've seen Karaoke Revolution, it's just those two games combined.
649236	650416	It's not a big surprise.
650456	651437	The drums look kind of neat.
651717	657678	The way they had them set up, though, they were very low to the ground, but it worked for whoever was playing drums.
657718	659978	I ended up playing the bass guitar because that was all that was left.
660919	662659	And I do like
663379	668140	The buttons on it, they have buttons towards the top and, of course, towards the bottom for, like, I guess, solo stuff.
668240	677282	I never really figured out, because you can use the bottom buttons the entire game, and I guess you use them also when you're doing, like, kind of the finale part.
679223	681343	Other than that, there's a little effector thing there.
681363	691746	You can switch between, like, five different effects, including, like, chorus, echo, and they have, like, some wah-wah and other stuff that you can do, so it was okay.
692286	692846	But, um...
693684	694324	Thanks for watching!
717819	718319	We'll have to see.
718459	719500	But otherwise, it was fun.
720040	720560	Definitely fun.
720600	731204	I like the whole team kind of aspect to it, because my guitar was giving me shit, and so I failed the first song, and my other teammates kind of got me back into the game.
731304	733444	And the same thing happened in reverse the last time.
733464	737066	The drummer failed, and then I got him back in there with the bass guitar.
737186	738346	So that's kind of cool.
739146	740367	I don't know.
740527	741367	It was a good game, though.
741527	743288	But if you expect anything...
744816	746297	Really different from Guitar Hero.
746978	749439	You're going to be disappointed, but it'll look good.
751461	751781	All right.
752021	756364	So do you think that Rock Band, now Rock Band got lots of awards at E3 2007.
756404	758966	Do you think that it's worthy of all the praise it's been getting?
759106	759486	I think so.
759526	766391	I think, well, Guitar Hero 3, I don't really think they're doing too much different other than the fact they're going to be catering to more of a hardcore crowds and they're going to
767202	767502	Hardcore!
793855	801612	Listen to, like, blues music and stuff, eating ribs, and I just happened to go just to play this game, but...
802552	803352	I think it'll be good.
804613	820518	The problem is they're going to have a tough time selling it for 200 bucks because from what I hear, and I don't know if this is going to be exactly the case, they're only going to be selling the game by itself and also that special edition which is going to have the guitar, drums, and microphone.
820999	823159	Those are the only two ways that they're going to have them.
824260	829782	But I guess in 2008, in January, they're going to start selling the drums and the guitars separately.
830422	830602	So...
832213	834935	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
854372	866204	on the add-on disc, and it's this little, almost like a flash game, where you have to put grenades underneath a warthog to fling it into the air to destroy aliens.
866224	878276	Let me show the game to the Op-11 people again, so you can see what the box, because this is different than the box art I've been seeing online, because most of the reviewers got the regular copy of Halo 3, but you somehow managed one of these little special edition things, so it's pretty neat there.
880103	882167	I want to look at webcam feed of our show archived.
882227	883309	It's Operate11.com.
883349	886756	Sometimes we hold up random things in front of the camera just to show what's going on.
887598	887698	So...
889264	891485	So I played Halo 3, which was pretty cool.
891525	894507	Again, I certainly haven't played enough to give an opinion of it.
895127	895948	It certainly looked nice.
896688	897188	I'll say that.
897569	898969	And I like the customization.
899290	901271	I love the customization in games like that.
901731	907614	And all I have to say is I was able to make my emblem a unicorn, and that was awesome, because unicorns are rad.
908054	908675	So there you go.
911508	912649	More on Halo 3 next week.
913249	916531	I have been spending my entire freaking week playing Eternal Sonata.
916631	921813	I ran out and bought this game the day it came out because I really enjoyed the demo and I have been loving the game.
922334	927416	You know, and I've been reading some of the reviews online of the game and I honestly think most of the critics have been pretty harsh on this game.
927816	934120	I think critics across the board just don't really care for Japanese role-playing games, especially 360, you know, reviewers.
934140	937622	Because on the 360, you don't get a lot of games like this.
937762	940263	But this, you know, is kind of a throwback to some really...
941349	943610	RAD, PlayStation 2 games I can think of in the past.
943990	944570	So, I don't know.
944850	948311	I would say if you're a fan of these types of Japanese role-playing games, don't listen to the reviews.
948932	949812	Is the game perfect?
950252	950452	No.
951132	956174	Some of my issues with the game is that the game tends to repeat the monsters over and over again.
956214	959815	Like, you go into a dungeon, and there's basically only two types of monsters you can fight.
960136	962036	There's scorpions, there's other things.
962056	963097	You know, flying bugs or something.
963117	963417	I don't know.
963817	966338	But, so the monsters get a little stale.
966578	966998	And, um...
967970	969151	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
988320	989240	Thanks for watching!
1012213	1014674	And of course, every character has their own stuff.
1015035	1019317	And later on, as you advance, the one cool thing is that the battle system builds and builds.
1019697	1023559	In the beginning, your five seconds only counts down when you're actually doing something.
1023859	1027101	But then later on, you have four seconds that counts down no matter what.
1027481	1028582	But you get perks from that.
1028622	1030623	You get like this echo meter that you build up.
1030683	1033845	So the more attacks you do, the more damage your special attacks do.
1034705	1037426	It's pretty neat, intricate the way the game works.
1037486	1046791	And the game is beautiful, very colorful, lots of greens, blues, reds, just all these different types of areas, snow areas, fire areas.
1046891	1049932	It just really shows off the graphical capabilities of 360.
1049972	1054034	And I, for one, think the story is pretty awesome.
1054334	1055895	I mean, it's certainly one of the most original games.
1056255	1056635	DarkSakura.com
1082428	1083389	Thank you for watching!
1102757	1108498	And by the way, for you DDR fans, the song Kakume from DDR Max 2, you remember that song?
1110059	1111979	That's based on a Chopin piece, Revolution.
1112539	1115300	And Revolution is the whole second stage in the game.
1115700	1123262	So you actually hear the original piano piece, and it's showing you all these pictures, kind of telling you about Chopin's life, and what it is is kind of mirroring what's going on in the game.
1123682	1126682	It's just really interesting.
1126882	1129023	Some really long monologues and stuff.
1129063	1129163	It's...
1131087	1132829	A good story, certainly worth checking out.
1150643	1153044	Ghost says, anyway, Eternal Sonata looks beautiful
1178393	1192963	GS68 says fuck corporate reviewers WTF I can only move in two dimensions there's no save points I keep dying and the game can be beaten in under one hour negative 264 out of 10 you know I think the thing about reviews is that
1193656	1194657	Everybody's different.
1195097	1199280	Everybody's different and likes different stuff, including the reviewers out there like different stuff.
1199841	1202883	So you just have to kind of find that reviewer that matches your taste.
1203003	1206806	And maybe that's me here on the show, or maybe it is somebody that writes for one of the corporate sites.
1206906	1209208	And I also think people are influenced by hype and stuff.
1209228	1216053	Like, for example, if I wanted to rate Halo like a 7 or 8 or something like that, people would be jumping all over me.
1216073	1217034	They'd be like, what the hell?
1217074	1219176	This is the game of the year, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1219256	1219496	I mean...
1220450	1221971	Hike does go a long way, that's for sure.
1242141	1243001	That's all you gotta show.
1243021	1247183	You don't need to show some fucking old guy talking about a plasma rifle or some shit like that.
1247624	1249925	No one knows nor cares what it's for.
1249945	1251726	I don't know, it's stupid.
1252688	1256350	By the way, the story in Eternal Sonata is kind of a real downer.
1256710	1269395	Like, you don't really see these types of stories in games, but like, the game, I'm not gonna real spoil anything, because the very first thing you see is one of the characters jumping off a cliff, apparently committing suicide, talking about letting herself, you know, go or whatever.
1269835	1273277	And then, of course, you know, Chopin is dying, and he's actually a character in the game.
1273557	1274397	He's talking about dying.
1274677	1280280	Meanwhile, there's another character who's 14 years old who realizes that because she can use magic, she has an incurable illness.
1280933	1281594	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1306033	1307474	Good news, you can do magic.
1307735	1308655	What's the bad news?
1308976	1310177	You have brain cancer.
1311318	1312379	Essentially, that's what it is.
1312679	1316162	But here's the interesting thing is they try to make parallels between that character.
1316924	1321226	and Chopin's sister who died as a teenager of tuberculosis.
1321586	1326929	See, there's all these really interesting parallels in it that I think make the story certainly really creative.
1327789	1333412	You may have those cliche RPG moments in it, but it's certainly never seen anything like this before.
1333692	1339335	You know, if TB gave you magical powers, maybe people wouldn't be so sad over it, you know?
1340915	1341876	You are so wrong.
1342776	1343537	I don't even know what to tell you.
1343557	1344938	There are some magicians out there.
1344958	1345939	I wish we'd get TV.
1347020	1348661	I'm looking at you, David Copperfield.
1349762	1350122	All right.
1350222	1353305	Anyhow, that's really all I've been playing.
1353365	1356107	I checked out that one game that came out on Xbox Live this week.
1356147	1356407	What is it?
1356447	1357228	Geass or whatever?
1357468	1357829	I don't know.
1357849	1358689	It looks stupid.
1358709	1360271	What's a Geass system on the Commodore 64?
1360331	1361472	It's like Geon Emotions or something.
1361532	1363133	Isn't that like an English school in Japan?
1363393	1363734	I don't know.
1364174	1365155	Genon Emotions.
1365195	1365895	Oh, it's Genon?
1366496	1367577	Maybe I was thinking of the Commodore 64.
1367617	1368037	It's Geon.
1368097	1368998	I'm not going to buy it.
1369098	1369879	That's what it's called.
1370894	1371616	It was okay.
1372017	1376507	I played it for like 15 minutes and then I was like, I need to go back to Eternal Sonata because I'm...
1377358	1379459	I'm not progressing enough in the story.
1379840	1382601	I don't know where the hell these reviewers are saying this game is too short.
1383121	1387564	I've been playing for about 16 hours now, and I think I'm maybe at the halfway point.
1387704	1388645	It may be a little past.
1389045	1391186	Like 30 hours is short for an RPG.
1391586	1393327	How long did it take you to beat Halo 3, Loki?
1394208	1397530	Well, I got the game on Wednesday, and I finished it today.
1398250	1399331	And I didn't play that long.
1399371	1402693	I mean, maybe I'd say maybe 10 hours at the most.
1404014	1404354	There you go.
1404844	1410347	And let me put it this way... I mean, I guess, granted, Halo 3 has a shitload of replayability value thanks to the multiplayer mode.
1410487	1417431	Well, there's a lot of stuff you can go back and... Like, I played it on normal difficulty, which I hear is super easy, but, you know, I just wanted to start at normal.
1417891	1427717	Had I realized that you can actually go through, like, Legendary or something like that, and then you'll get the achievements for all the other difficulties, I would have saved myself some time and just played it on the hardest difficulty.
1428357	1429038	But, um...
1429730	1431311	Oh, what was I going to say?
1432092	1433192	One bit of advice, though.
1433532	1443579	Whenever you get into a sequence where someone's piloting a vehicle, I highly recommend you kick them out of the driver's seat and you pilot the vehicle because the AI sucks at piloting vehicles.
1444479	1445440	Completely awful.
1446360	1447500	DarkSakura, will you be playing Halo 3?
1474361	1476843	If first-person shooters didn't make me puke, then maybe.
1478004	1480547	No, actually, even if first-person shooters made me puke, no.
1482508	1483910	Because you're too busy with Ragnarok.
1484450	1485912	No, because I'm too busy playing good games.
1486672	1487413	Oh, snap.
1488434	1488774	All right.
1490696	1491256	I guess that's it.
1491316	1493038	That's really all I have to say for my gaming week.
1493518	1497842	I've talked far too much about those games I've been playing this week.
1497882	1499504	So let's get into some housekeeping.
1500208	1501389	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1520356	1521637	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1542918	1544539	Facebook is getting worse than MySpace
1572129	1572670	That's that.
1572951	1575334	Let's get into some gaming news.
1575434	1576195	We'll talk about that.
1576796	1582144	Well, this week we had a lot of big announcements, of course, because Tokyo Game Show was going on.
1583174	1609667	um one interesting thing though and will probably be a sigh of relief for a lot of people Super Smash Brothers Brawl has revealed their online plans uh yes there will be friends codes at least it will be online so that's good thank god um there will be options to play against friends or to play against anybody um so I don't know it kind of I guess typical for your normal Nintendo online game um
1611724	1612805	So yeah, pretty awesome.
1613826	1617789	And on the dojo this week, they put up all these Snake things.
1617849	1623194	Like they finally, you know, I guess, what do you want to say, officially unveiled Snake as a character on the dojo.
1623254	1626197	Although, thanks to E3 last year, we already knew it was coming.
1626617	1629840	But they actually officially, you know, rolled out his profile and everything on the site.
1630060	1632142	And this is a pretty awesome picture of him.
1633022	1638087	It's kind of a homoerotic pose with him and Ike coming up behind him and doing the whole, like, I'm going to snap your neck type thing.
1638587	1639408	Or who knows what.
1641322	1649006	Remember that one game that I had, and I cannot remember the name for the life of me, that had a bunch of Hudson characters and Hasbro characters in it and stuff?
1649166	1651568	Remember Snake was in there.
1652108	1653849	Wasn't that the one where you could be Optimus Prime?
1653889	1656010	Yeah, you could do Optimus Prime versus Barbie.
1656050	1657611	I mean, how awesome is that?
1657631	1659232	That was on the DS, right?
1659272	1661093	Yeah, you could play as Bomberman.
1661333	1661954	No, it wasn't DS.
1661994	1663194	It was on the PlayStation 2.
1663234	1665736	They had Bomberman, Snake...
1666364	1667825	They actually had Simon Belmont.
1668685	1671086	You could play as Barbie.
1671586	1673947	There was Optimus Prime.
1674087	1677688	Dark Tetsuya and Rob D are yelling, Dream Mix, TV World Fighters.
1677708	1678388	Yes, that's it.
1678488	1679829	Yeah, that's awesome.
1680129	1684891	So, you know, really they could have just ripped Snake from there and just used all of his moves.
1684911	1687732	Because from what I've seen on Super Smash Bros.
1687792	1689532	already, it's kind of similar anyway.
1689712	1691553	So, I don't know.
1691920	1693020	Optimus Prime vs. Barbie
1720410	1739880	Alright, anyhow, I also wanted to say about this though, what do you think about the whole fact that when you play online against strangers, you don't get to see their names, you don't get to have the little chat bubbles, nothing, it's just a straight up, it's almost like playing against the computer, except the computer is actually being controlled by someone real you don't know.
1740640	1742201	It doesn't save stats, it doesn't do anything.
1742521	1745643	I mean, in my mind, I'm kind of like, well, then why do they even bother?
1746343	1749265	Because you can't track who you're playing, you can't,
1749950	1753271	If you liked playing with them, you can't play with them again later.
1753391	1754372	I mean, there's, like, none of that.
1755412	1758053	But I suppose this is just more bitching about Nintendo's online mode.
1758093	1761274	All I gotta say is their online needs a major overhaul.
1761494	1767336	I mean... I heard rumors that there's supposed to be some major update coming this month.
1767956	1772778	And with, you know, next week being the last week of the month, I don't think that's gonna happen, so...
1774827	1776948	I do like what they're doing with the friend stuff.
1776988	1784573	If you have a friend added, how you can do, in lieu of voice chat, since they don't have that, you can do the little speech bubbles and things.
1784813	1786214	That's kind of neat, I guess.
1787655	1790297	Part of the reason the DS Online thing works...
1791017	1797361	I don't know how you guys do it, but the way I play DS online is that I'll be chatting with someone on AOL, and they'll be like, hey, want to play something on DS?
1797401	1797922	I'm like, okay.
1798242	1805547	And so then I'll play the game, and then as soon as the game opens, I can go right over and chat with them, like, haha, I kicked your ass, or boy, you own me, or whatever.
1805567	1807888	But you can't do that on the Wii now, unless I have a laptop.
1807908	1812351	But even the DS has more features in their online games than...
1814504	1819046	The Wii doesn't have that.
1819466	1822427	Come on, there's more technology in the Wii than there is in the DS.
1822527	1825209	Why can't they implement the stuff that's already implemented in other things?
1825529	1829191	And if the DS can handle voice chat, why can't the fucking Wii handle it?
1830331	1837434	TheRobD in our chat says, Honestly, Sky, Wii Fighter fans get so few bones thrown to us in terms of online play that I, for one, don't even care.
1837955	1840696	Online play on a fighter is enough for me right now.
1841856	1844179	Rob D says, when I play on DS, we chat on Skype, too.
1844439	1844839	That'll work.
1845580	1848323	You know, and I guess, in a way, you have a point.
1849043	1853428	It's better than nothing, and I think that's a lot of the reaction people are having to this news.
1853448	1854589	At least that's kind of what I said.
1854629	1859834	I said, okay, at least it's a step in the right direction, and it's better than not being online at all, like Metroid Prime 3.
1859874	1859994	Okay.
1862188	1872793	But still, you look at the mainframe and everything the Xbox Live has to offer, and you kind of go, geez, Nintendo really feels like a little bit behind in these realms of online play.
1873193	1880096	But I suppose with their whole, you know, we're not making games for the hardcore gamers all the time type thing, maybe they can get away with that.
1880476	1881196	And they probably can.
1882037	1883898	So, what have you?
1884258	1887119	Well, if you have some further comments on this, you can always send us an email.
1887239	1889840	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to go.
1890881	1891401	Meanwhile...
1892546	1898308	I have some news for you guys, and it has to do with Star Wars The Force Unleashed.
1898809	1912614	It's a new game coming out on the Nintendo Wii, and a lot of folks are very excited that they're finally getting a Star Wars game because, of course, Star Wars game equals, ooh, we're going to have big lightsaber battles finally on the Wii.
1912654	1914275	Yes, what the Wii was made for.
1914835	1921378	Well, according to a recent episode of the 1UP podcast, thanks to my Twitter friends for pointing this out to me, may not be so.
1922561	1931525	It looks like the game may actually not feature that kind of support for... I would say, because I thought this was coming out on, like, 360 and PlayStation 3 as well.
1931605	1932465	Yeah, it's probably on.
1933046	1941609	And it's just going to be kind of like, you know, Knights of the Old Republic or something like that, you know, but a little bit more physics and stuff.
1941850	1943010	You know, it's going to look pretty.
1943790	1951774	But it's not like a true, you know, like playing the Star Wars arcade game, you know, the new arcade game where they had, you know, the actual lightsaber and stuff that you can...
1953392	1955333	I suppose there will be more to come on this.
1955433	1959477	However, I'll leave you with this official quote from the president of LucasArts, Jim Ward.
1972068	1978754	Hmm, but if you, I mean, I don't know, I don't know to what validity the other podcast information is, but if it's not that way, that's gonna be a bummer.
1978814	1991985	It'll probably have, like, limited stuff where you'll swing it around to, like, do different things, but it'll also be, like, if you're gonna be using the Force, like, if you push the remote and uncheck out, it'll be, like, doing the Force push or, you know, stuff like that.
1992125	1994247	It's very limited.
1996008	1996649	Alright, well...
1997802	2001643	I'll still check it out, and hopefully you do get to do some Wii lightsaber.
2001663	2006805	But, you know, just because it doesn't have the lightsaber doesn't necessarily mean it'll be a bad game.
2006845	2010866	I mean, a lot of people seem to enjoy the LEGO Star Wars thing, which had really nothing to do with motion controls.
2012047	2019089	There's still a lot of good games to be cranked out of the Star Wars franchise, and I'm sure they'll try for years and years and years to come.
2019489	2019709	Well...
2021030	2025120	I've made a mention of this earlier that I'm going to be getting with myself.
2025240	2028688	They've confirmed that the Wii Zapper is going to be out in Europe this year.
2029192	2029432	Ghost Squad
2052605	2054365	and Resident Evil The Umbrella Chronicles.
2054846	2055826	So it'll use the zapper.
2056206	2059867	Dan was saying at their conference that they weren't calling it a light gun.
2060707	2064027	They were calling it a pointing system.
2064788	2065608	A pointer system.
2065788	2066588	I thought that was funny.
2067228	2067668	Interesting.
2068288	2077030	Also sort of related too is that he did see the new GunCon that looks like the GunCon 2 and has a trigger switch.
2077250	2077990	Oh, for Time Crisis?
2078090	2078290	Yeah.
2078690	2081191	And has a trigger switch on the side for a directional button.
2082842	2085607	MrDebucket in chat says, it's not a gun, it's a blaster.
2086489	2086970	Or a pointer.
2087879	2089320	You know, but it ain't a bazooka.
2089800	2092042	Nothing is still as awesome as the Saturn Enforcer.
2092262	2093763	Or the Super Scope 6, honestly.
2093803	2094904	I mean, it was a fucking bazooka.
2094944	2096005	You can't get any cooler than that.
2096285	2096765	You really can't.
2096885	2099067	I'm telling you, man, that thing is so useless.
2099167	2100247	The Menacer, Rob.
2100268	2100828	The Menacer.
2101128	2101989	Or the Activator.
2102109	2102229	No.
2102449	2103710	I have an Activator.
2103850	2104290	I'm sorry.
2105291	2106492	I got it for nine bucks.
2106532	2108413	I remember when Loki bought an Activator.
2108713	2110114	Why the hell did you buy an Activator?
2110134	2112096	You bought, like, an Activator on eBay for something.
2112116	2112556	It was for your...
2113788	2114509	for the cabinet.
2114529	2116431	You're going to do the Parapara thing.
2116511	2118633	I was going to build a Parapara setup for the cabinet.
2118653	2123698	This was back when I was going to build one control panel for every single Bomani game.
2123758	2125179	And back when Parapara was cool.
2125860	2129523	Parapara was so cool.
2129563	2133687	I ended up throwing the Activator stuff away because I got it for like $10.
2135389	2137591	I did, however, and I still have them,
2138140	2144803	I have the Dream Parapara controller, which does hook up to the PC via a converter.
2145063	2147324	So, if I really want to.
2147364	2150486	And I remember we played the Dream Parapara on the Dreamcast.
2150506	2153647	It's exactly the same as Parapara, except it has really crappy songs.
2155708	2156929	Son of Dad asks a good question.
2156949	2159710	Can Silent Hill Arcade be ported to the Wii with the Zapper?
2160251	2160691	I hope so.
2160831	2161331	It'll be fun.
2162011	2163192	Don't you want to shoot Pyramid Head?
2164373	2164593	Yes.
2164673	2165133	With hearts?
2165153	2165213	Yes.
2166593	2167874	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2192194	2192514	I don't.
2192934	2194895	I never saw the second movie because I knew it would suck.
2194915	2195695	I liked the second one.
2195755	2196075	Did you?
2196235	2196715	Yes, I did.
2196835	2198396	Apparently the third one isn't bad.
2198416	2200136	It's better than the second one is what people are saying.
2200176	2202137	The second one had all the crap I wanted to see.
2202377	2202617	Really?
2202637	2204618	Being stuck in a city full of zombies.
2204678	2206498	I mean, hey, that was fantastic.
2206778	2208939	But the movie was number one at the box office this weekend.
2209059	2210220	It beat the Dane Cook movie.
2210680	2211260	And Jessica Alba.
2211280	2211740	The Dane Cook movie?
2212140	2214501	Yeah, but Dane Cook sucks.
2214821	2220183	I think the movie has a 3% on Rotten Tomatoes, and Resident Evil at least has like 10%, I want to say.
2220223	2221764	Okay, let's go see it this weekend, Rob.
2222884	2223905	I don't know if I want to.
2224165	2224785	Come on.
2225645	2226125	I'll pay.
2226285	2226906	They're serious?
2226966	2227266	Okay.
2227446	2228086	You can get there.
2228226	2229206	Here, if you'll pay.
2229527	2233368	If you want to do something better, Transformers just came into the IMAX.
2234088	2235349	Ooh.
2235869	2238450	I haven't seen 10 to 20 minutes of extra footage in there.
2238550	2239150	Let's go, Rob.
2240011	2241031	That I might have to go see.
2241616	2242237	I haven't seen that yet.
2242377	2243798	But I'm not paying for IMAX.
2244038	2245399	Okay, I'll pay for IMAX though.
2245419	2245940	That'll be fun.
2247741	2256128	One thing I was going to say, once again, commenting on the Wii Zapper, completely useless piece of shit, and you guys will all buy it because it has Zelda crossbow training.
2256228	2257769	You fucking sheep.
2259321	2272165	and we will prove on this show that that piece of shit actually hinders your playing versus helping you and that it is a complete useless pile of junk.
2272305	2276046	In fact, I think we should use Zelda's crossbow training as the game.
2277407	2280988	For those that forget, Loki and I made a bet about 10 weeks ago on the show.
2281348	2283469	We made a bet when the Wii Zapper was first announced.
2283509	2284029	Loki said...
2284529	2285249	Thank you for watching!
2309298	2313100	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2339226	2339767	I think so.
2340007	2340568	Be good times.
2340588	2341308	Good times.
2341809	2342169	Absolutely.
2342189	2342450	All right.
2343150	2344892	Let's travel the globe and look at some release dates.
2344952	2346314	Things that are coming out very soon.
2346654	2346895	Yes.
2347555	2352080	Starting in the U.S., this is a big week, of course, with Halo 3 coming out on the 360.
2353282	2355124	All three versions on Tuesday.
2356365	2359869	Better start lining up on Monday because everybody else is going to
2361030	2361391	You know what?
2361411	2362371	Seriously, why?
2362912	2365213	Why do you need to line up that?
2365514	2367095	Can't you just go after work or school on Tuesday?
2367115	2369176	So you can be the first people in the world to play it.
2369216	2369717	Guess what?
2369737	2370357	You're not.
2370798	2373920	Like three people on my friends list have already been playing it and we had it.
2374000	2374380	You know what?
2374620	2375821	You're not the first in the world.
2375881	2377803	So just wait for Tuesday.
2377963	2380204	Do you really have to get it at midnight?
2380525	2381065	That's what I want.
2381245	2386409	I want to know how many people in our chat room are planning to run out at midnight tomorrow and buy the game and if so, why?
2387109	2387750	That's what I want to know.
2389271	2389451	Yeah.
2390154	2390374	Sorry.
2390735	2392698	Anyways, other games coming out this week.
2392778	2394140	Actually, some that I'm looking forward to.
2394240	2396944	Jackass the game on PlayStation 2 and PSP.
2398285	2399247	I've got to buy this game.
2399507	2399988	It just looks...
2401034	2401814	It's too much fun.
2401834	2404655	I would... Well, you don't gotta buy the game.
2404715	2407156	I have to buy the... Well, yeah, I don't have to buy the game.
2408817	2410377	Anyways, other games coming out.
2410917	2414819	Also, we have CSI Hard Evidence on Xbox 360.
2415799	2422881	Hot Wheels Beat That, which I'm sure is going to be an awesome game, on Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, and the Wii.
2424262	2424342	Um...
2425556	2431067	A small old game called Dance Dance Revolution Supernova 2 is going to be coming out.
2431228	2431528	Really?
2431588	2432851	PlayStation 2, yes it is.
2432891	2433752	Where did that come from?
2435115	2436458	It's coming out next week, yeah.
2437202	2438423	Oh, that little thing.
2438603	2439044	Yeah, I know.
2439064	2440225	I was like, oh, yeah, DDR.
2440245	2441666	I remember when I played that every day.
2442587	2445509	CSI Three Dimensions of Murder on PlayStation 2.
2446430	2453776	My favorite title, or just name of a title this week, is Soul Nomad and the World Eaters on PlayStation 2.
2454136	2455798	I saw the website for that.
2456498	2461162	It's by the people who did... Crap, now I can't think of it.
2461382	2462804	It's a tactics game, though.
2463304	2463885	Nice, yeah.
2464105	2465566	I think they did Grim Grimoire.
2466513	2471797	World Series of Poker 2008 PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 PSP NBA 08 Skate PlayStation 3 Bratz the Movie
2492452	2494274	Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party
2519895	2522017	And then I will let Loki read those dates in the future.
2522937	2526980	Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party for the Wii is coming out this week as well.
2527060	2527341	Really?
2527661	2528441	Yes, the bundle.
2530083	2530943	Let's see here.
2531303	2537648	And then on the DS, we've got Math Play, which I'm sure is fun, and it has to do with math.
2538609	2543012	Race Driver, Create and Race, Crayola Treasure Adventures.
2544353	2544973	Yay!
2544994	2545054	Yay!
2547776	2549318	Uh, just basically a bunch of crap.
2549618	2555683	And I guess there are some spelling challenges and shit game coming out on the DS and PSP.
2557785	2562389	Uh, I'm gonna look at, read some comments in chat real fast before we get to the next set of dates here.
2562409	2565852	Um, cause there's comments about the 360 Midnight Launch.
2565892	2567053	Remember I mentioned that a little bit ago?
2567714	2571297	Uh, SSJ100Matt says, Ask the people who lined up for the new Harry Potter book.
2571597	2572998	Every place imaginable sold it.
2573078	2573679	Why line up?
2574798	2577540	Rob D says, I'd go if the crowds weren't all frat boys and racist 12-year-olds.
2577560	2582382	I love what an employee of an unnamed store told a friend of mine and Dan's.
2582502	2583343	Uh-huh.
2599324	2604928	We have to call you and tell you that your reservation for Halo 3 is here, but you don't have to come at midnight if you don't want to.
2605349	2606610	It'll be there the next day.
2610753	2611833	I'm like, best ever.
2612314	2620500	If you want to comment, chat.orangeloungeradio.com and you can say such things like DJ Morpheus says, Rob is the Chris Crocker of internet radio.
2620780	2621180	You know what?
2621220	2621861	Fuck that guy.
2622461	2623002	Seriously.
2625236	2627857	That guy sucks.
2627937	2630839	I cannot believe he's famous for that stupid... Alright, forget it.
2631019	2631579	Release dates.
2632299	2633100	Oh, is it my turn?
2633860	2634060	Yes.
2634380	2634880	Oh, whatever.
2635581	2637341	Oh yeah, Halo 3 on the 26th.
2637562	2638002	Big whoop.
2638902	2639462	Ha, you get it.
2639562	2640063	Day later.
2640783	2641303	Ooh yeah.
2641463	2646185	Yeah, but technically their day later is... No, it is later, isn't it?
2646305	2646526	Anyway.
2646906	2648046	They're always a day later.
2648366	2650827	Moving forward to the 28th.
2651688	2654149	We have a whole bunch of shit coming out.
2656347	2676905	um, Armed Assault, Queen's Gambit on PC, Blazing Angels, Secret Missions of World War II on PC, Company of Heroes, Opposing Fronts, Conan on some stuff, Crazy Taxi, Fair Wars PSP, Enemy Territory, Quake Wars, FIFA 08 on damn near everything, Grim Grimoire, Jam Sessions, Juiced 2, Hot Import Nights,
2677438	2684542	King of Clubs, MotoGP07, Ratatouille on Damn Near Everything, Sega Rally also on Damn Near Everything.
2684762	2686463	Is that an official console, Damn Near Everything?
2686643	2686883	Yes.
2687544	2688264	Stranglehold.
2688344	2689665	It's, you know, like the GameX, Rob.
2690806	2691926	Stuntman Ignition.
2692367	2694008	Oh, yeah, we got that, I think.
2694508	2699571	Test Drive Unlimited, Xbox 360 Classics, and The Settler's Rise of an Empire.
2702032	2702573	Good times.
2702913	2703153	Yeah.
2703877	2704818	Thanks for watching!
2726349	2730452	The little cover art for the game cracked me up, so Bass Fishing on the Wii is coming out.
2730932	2733253	I don't think if it comes to America it'll have that box art.
2733814	2736836	My Sims is coming out on the Wii in Japan, the Japanese version.
2736916	2740658	Boku no, sorry, Boku to Sim no Machi is what it's called over there.
2741138	2748663	On the PlayStation 3, The Elder Scrolls Oblivion finally comes out to the PlayStation 3 on September 27th, along with
2749501	2751283	Agarest Senki is coming out.
2751544	2755007	It's a compile game from them, and that's coming out on the PlayStation 3.
2755327	2757850	Looks to be a little strategy-based game.
2758271	2761394	Kind of looks like it has some RPG elements to me.
2761934	2764357	Actually, that battle kind of looks like an Eternal Sonata battle.
2765991	2767032	A little tactical there in nature.
2767912	2772033	Phantasy Star Universe Ambition of the Illuminous comes out on the PlayStation 2.
2772674	2776335	And when I first read this, I thought it said Phantasy Star Universe Abortion of the Illuminous.
2776375	2778016	And I was like, well, that's got to be a controversial game.
2778496	2779276	But it's Ambition.
2780977	2782797	We may be calling that once it comes out.
2783017	2789020	Some people called Phantasy Star Universe an abortion of a game, but it's not that bad.
2789080	2789940	I didn't think it was that bad.
2791085	2798047	PlayStation 2, Bleach, Blade Battle Seconds coming out on the PlayStation 2 because you can't have enough bleach.
2798807	2801528	A game is coming out on the DS and this could be useful.
2801588	2803008	It's Bartender DS.
2803648	2805729	This is a game that teaches you how to mix drinks.
2806569	2807269	Fuck yeah.
2807289	2808770	That could actually come in pretty handy.
2809570	2812251	Now that is making usefulness out of the DS.
2812331	2812771	Good job.
2813011	2813711	Props to those guys.
2814538	2818821	Namco Bandai is putting out another Tamagotchi game in Japan on the 27th for the DS.
2819121	2823643	Tamagotchi no Puchi Puchi Omiseki Mina San Q is coming out.
2824884	2826305	It's a strategy Tamagotchi game.
2826625	2829446	And then on the PSP, Yu-Gi-Oh!
2829527	2831468	Dual Monsters GX Tag Force 2.
2832348	2834890	Because you just can't get enough Yu-Gi-Oh!
2835630	2836230	Can you, Jamie?
2836611	2837451	Don't you love Yu-Gi-Oh?
2838351	2839112	Not in English.
2841454	2842275	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2861565	2862526	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2891954	2895721	So with that being said, the DualShock 3 is official.
2896423	2903396	It will feature the same wonderful technology that was in the DualShock 2, as well as now you get the tilt stuff.
2904356	2932807	it's coming out in Japan in November the rest of the world in spring of 2008 there will be some interesting features for it including I believe they're going to be some of the newer games are going to be supporting it also some of the older games that have already come out will be able to support Rumble as well through a patch system that they're going to implement so Resistance and I think Ratchet and Clank is going to support it stuff like that so
2933655	2941001	That's cool, you know, with them saying that, you know, Rumble is last-gen stuff, that you don't need it.
2941441	2943082	Boy, they sure know how to backpedal.
2943222	2945984	Of course, the entire chatroom is bursting out in unison.
2946025	2953730	GS68 says, STFU, Sony Rumble is so last-gen, and DarkTetsuya says, but Rumble is so last-gen, I roll.
2954511	2959595	So, what do you think finally caused them to release this controller that we all knew was coming six months ago?
2960339	2962240	The whole immersion thing is what it is.
2962580	2964261	It's because they finally settled with them.
2964321	2967063	They're saying, oh no, we planned on doing stuff like this.
2967403	2969364	You guys wanted it, so we made it happen.
2969384	2970725	You know, it's just spin.
2970785	2973066	All it is is that they were going to have it originally.
2973086	2978249	I mean, why else would the controller shells have room for, I don't know, rumble motors?
2978629	2982872	Hmm, that's kind of odd, seeing as they never planned on having them there in the first place.
2983052	2989015	Oh wait, yes they did, but then they found out a company got pissed at them for stealing their technology, so...
2990717	2991878	Thanks for watching!
3009392	3015834	can detect that, you know, the controller shaking is not actually you tilting it in a different direction.
3015894	3021355	What we've done is we've actually taken a race of little gnome people and put them inside the controller.
3021996	3029918	And they're speedily calculating all these different algorithms, making the Six Axis and Rumble technology work together in perfect harmony.
3030198	3033579	Wow, that's so amazing, because no other systems have been able to do that yet.
3033699	3035239	Oh, wait, no, I take that back.
3035279	3037340	The Wii has one that works just like that.
3037970	3040372	But the Wii is also powered by little gnome people.
3040652	3042033	That's why they're so hard to get.
3043274	3046417	I mean, the gnome women are having to crank out babies left and right to make this.
3046437	3048078	The gnome people are going to go on strike.
3049459	3051380	No, hell no, we won't rumble.
3052141	3055964	Please, please, Nintendo and Sony, think of David the Gnome.
3056750	3063133	Nintendo Maniac 64 says in our chatroom, Loki, so that means that Metal Gear Solid 4 and Final Fantasy XIII will actually be on the 360.
3063173	3064493	They are rumors.
3065594	3065754	No.
3065774	3067435	Final Fantasy XIII.
3067455	3068795	I don't think I'm taking a future story.
3068835	3069295	Sorry if I am.
3069575	3070096	But Final Fantasy XIII.
3071870	3077754	They definitively said at the end of the trailer, PlayStation 3 only, when they showed it at Tokyo Game Show this week.
3077994	3081056	Yeah, what they did show on there is 2020.
3081517	3084359	You can come play at my house, Rob.
3084499	3086660	Final Fantasy XIII in 2013.
3087261	3091904	That's the whole... Yeah, and it'll come out on 1.13 or something, I don't know.
3092684	3093025	Forget it.
3094245	3094586	Anyhow.
3094806	3095186	Forget what?
3095206	3096107	Yeah, exactly.
3096127	3096447	Exactly.
3097513	3098413	Thanks for watching!
3114878	3115298	Thanks for watching!
3134887	3137368	Okay, I mean, that doesn't seem like a real big deal to me.
3137728	3145470	But multiple PSP systems in the future will be able to connect as a hub, and they're wanting to continue this and use this more often.
3145930	3147070	So, pretty cool.
3147811	3148511	I like this idea.
3149251	3152452	Except for the fact that, you know, you have to have a lot of friends with PSPs for it to work.
3153172	3155433	In case you want to have three rear-view mirrors.
3157113	3158234	Well, you need side mirrors.
3158934	3159594	Well, awesome.
3159994	3162075	That must be a reason why they're buying their system.
3162235	3162715	Absolutely.
3162735	3163475	Rear-view mirror.
3164193	3167856	Don't you have to have a certain firmware for that to work?
3188388	3189049	We talked about it.
3189069	3189650	I could be running 3.7.
3189710	3191232	Hey, I want to do a story.
3191312	3192815	All right, sounds good.
3193035	3193395	You may.
3193936	3202128	Well, recent reports, thanks to Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII, shows that the PSP sales have surged in Japan.
3204026	3204427	PSP 95,487 Units
3221631	3223113	DS-79,974, Wii-26,181, PS2-13,128, PS3-13,128, Xbox 360-1,243, Game Boy Advance-836 GameCubes at 97 units
3241704	3250067	You know, it's not surprising that they've sold so well because Crisis Core would only run on the PSP Slim, so if you wanted to play it, you had to buy one.
3250447	3251367	Thank you, Sony!
3251887	3252308	Awesome.
3252688	3253888	Whoa, it won't run on an old PSP?
3253928	3254508	No, it won't.
3254548	3254808	Why?
3255369	3257789	Because it's using the full clock.
3257809	3258670	Crisis Core?
3259090	3259310	Yeah.
3259430	3259770	It will.
3259950	3261791	I've seen side-by-side comparisons of the game.
3262251	3262451	Aha!
3262970	3267174	There's a video file out showing how Crisis Core runs on an old PSP and a new one.
3267194	3267775	That's right, I've seen that.
3267795	3268896	I thought they said that it wouldn't.
3269276	3279826	It has a higher loading time, and although I thought it was funny that when they showed the demo battles, both battles finished at the same time, even though the PSP one loaded later.
3280166	3285591	Well, I thought they needed the... Well, you thought wrong!
3285612	3287593	Well, this is what I read, okay?
3287673	3288114	Whatever.
3289184	3300207	Well, side-by-side comparison showed, but the thing that was good about that comparison is that it did show the better processing power in the new PSPs.
3300307	3318353	But also, just another comparison for software releases in relation to those hardware releases is that Crisis Core, of course, was the top seller, followed by Pokemon Fushigino Dungeon, Tokino, uh, uh, Tankentai, and also the, uh,
3319167	3334491	Yami no Tanken Tai, um, followed by that, Fate, Tiger Coliseum, Another Centuries, Episode 3, The Final, Taiko no Satsujin DS, Mario Party 8, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, Ring of Fates, Sengoku Musou 2 Mushouden, and My Housekeeping Diary.
3335051	3335291	So.
3336951	3337391	That was number 10.
3337611	3338812	Well, the women had to buy something.
3338832	3339232	For sales.
3340092	3341212	No, they're not buying Pokemon.
3342673	3343793	I want Crisis Core, though.
3343853	3345813	I apologize to all our female listeners this week.
3345853	3347394	You need to apologize to me, Rob.
3347454	3348014	I'm, you know.
3348789	3351530	You need to beg my forgiveness.
3351771	3356573	Dear DarkSakura the Great and Terrible, I beg upon ye for forgiveness.
3357193	3364557	Buying Crisis Core, you know, would only encourage them to make games like Dirge of Service, so... I like Dirge of Service.
3364737	3367399	Besides, I can't really play Crisis Core right now, it's all in Japanese.
3367599	3368359	Vincent's awesome.
3369160	3371141	But when it comes out in the US, we'll see.
3371261	3372381	I don't mind playing it in Japanese.
3373922	3374783	Next story, please.
3376724	3377064	Anyways...
3378374	3382575	So there's another game that's also going to be coming out pretty soon in Japan.
3383275	3385696	And you know that game that we thought was free before?
3386096	3388296	Oh, but never fear.
3388456	3390937	Sony's here to take a shit on you.
3391917	3399038	Gran Turismo 5 Prologue has been priced in Japan for 49.80 yen.
3399798	3406480	And also it will be coming out on Blu-ray as well for a total savings of about 5 bucks for 4,500 yen.
3408606	3413929	for the download, or I'm sorry, $49.80 was the Blu-ray version, $4,500 was the download.
3414390	3418712	So, yeah, you save $5 downloading it straight to your PS3.
3420593	3432940	Now, I know it's supposed to come with, I think, about 40 cars, and looks pretty nice, but, I mean, after all, you are buying pretty much a partial game, I guess, because it's technically kind of like a demo.
3433821	3434461	So, $40 for...
3436457	3440940	A partially finished game when you can wait probably a year and play the full game for $60.
3441080	3445604	I don't know, do people like Gran Turismo 5 that much?
3446464	3450507	But if you're interested, it's coming out December 13th in Japan.
3451268	3453509	Or if you have a Japanese account, you can probably download it over here.
3455471	3456992	But not that you do that, because that's wrong.
3457292	3458653	Fuck no, I'm not going to pay that...
3459557	3463466	I'm not going to pay what is the equivalent of $43.10 for Gran Turismo 5.
3463746	3466633	I want the full game if I'm going to be paying that kind of money.
3466833	3468437	Well, Loki, would you pay $69.99 for the Eye of Judgment?
3470868	3475451	Because the Eye of Judgment comes out soon on October 23rd.
3475612	3476232	It looks funny.
3476252	3476792	For $69.99.
3477153	3483477	Now the good news is, that is the price of the game and the PlayStation Eye, which is the peripheral.
3484238	3488781	Or as we call it here on the program, the Brown Eye of Judgment that will come with the PlayStation Brown Eye.
3488801	3493905	So if you want to get a Brown Eye for your PlayStation, you can get one on October 23rd for $69.99.
3494786	3497968	You also get a little camera stand with it, but it's called...
3498769	3499330	Thank you for watching!
3515899	3521864	There's battle maps that come with it, a starter deck of cards comes with it, and an 8-card booster pack.
3521904	3523125	Here's where things get interesting.
3523585	3527448	If you want more booster packs, they'll cost you $3.75 each.
3528369	3532572	You can also get 1 of 5 pre-constructed theme packs for $14.99.
3533753	3538877	Now, of course, Loki was wondering, well, what the hell's going to stop me from making my own cards and using them to play online?
3538937	3539177	Aha!
3539757	3551199	Well, what's going to happen is that you're going to have to pre-register your decks with the game, and you put in your serial numbers, I suppose, and then the software will randomly select what cards get drawn next.
3551239	3552600	That way you can't stack the deck.
3553340	3554320	That's stupid.
3555020	3557641	Yeah, I can't... It's stupid.
3557921	3566442	I'm sorry, you know, whereas, okay, maybe the PlayStation Brown Eye can have some future, you know... Nobody's really done a decent camera.
3566462	3569103	I mean, how long did that Xbox 360 Vision thing last?
3569838	3570818	Like, it didn't.
3570919	3572439	Like, it fizzled the moment it hit.
3572459	3574060	Because it had... What did it have going for it?
3574120	3574700	Totem ball.
3574920	3576201	And the fact that you can make your own gamer picks.
3576221	3576841	Let me put it this way.
3576981	3578482	It was as popular as the iToy.
3579142	3579682	Yeah.
3579882	3580422	Seriously.
3580643	3582263	Cameras for systems.
3583264	3586105	I think people just... They're like, ooh, that's kind of cool.
3586165	3592267	And then... iToy squeezed out a little more life out of it.
3593508	3597390	The iToy squeezed a little more life out of it.
3597470	3597650	But...
3598911	3603315	Just because it had DDR probably in some of the Harry Potter games and things that kids were into.
3603755	3608659	But the brown eye is going to need a lot more than the brown eye of judgment to do well, I think.
3609740	3611682	And that's just plain online stuff.
3611762	3615645	It says via cheating, pre-registering your decks.
3616126	3618287	I mean, people are going to crack that shit so fast.
3618307	3619228	Well, cheat in person all you want.
3619809	3622911	People are going to crack that shit so fast it's not even funny.
3622951	3623211	Why?
3623272	3627355	I ask the cracking and hacking community of the world out there.
3627870	3629471	Is this worth hacking?
3629971	3630271	I mean...
3646298	3647239	Thank you for watching!
3663368	3664730	That sounds interesting.
3679440	3679820	Why?
3680021	3686426	I don't know why, but uploading yourself singing badly to karaoke to put on this YouTube-type thing.
3686446	3692391	I mean, if you really need that much attention, you could probably set up your own webcam and put it on the real YouTube, and guess what?
3692431	3695733	That will be free, so... And more people would probably see it.
3695753	3700037	And you could be angsty about Britney Spears or something, and millions of people will view it.
3701478	3703280	I just, I don't see the point.
3703720	3708244	I mean, the PlayStation... The eye of judgment is as bad as I thought it was, so...
3708980	3711942	Alright, well if you plan on purchasing the Eye of Judgment, we'd love to hear from you.
3712022	3714023	Mail back at orangeonstrider.com I want to know why.
3714183	3717365	If you're going to camp out at midnight to buy it, we especially want to hear from you.
3718065	3718485	Why?
3719966	3721267	That's just what I want to know, why.
3721427	3723028	I hope I get one for free, but I know I won't.
3725149	3728210	Even if you get one for free, I think you should destroy it live on our program.
3728230	3731372	They did show off the Eye of Judgment at their conference.
3731452	3734814	Loki, Loki, Loki, if you get a brown Eye of Judgment for free, can we destroy it on the program?
3735592	3735932	Sure.
3736032	3736673	Hooray!
3736833	3737373	Destroy!
3737433	3737973	Destruction!
3738173	3738854	Oh, I want the camera.
3738974	3740574	We'll set something up outside.
3740614	3746677	I want to play the game, and then, like, in the middle of the game... Can you imagine if someone set the thing on fire?
3746717	3751760	Like, if you're playing someone online, and then you're, like, dealing with other cards, I'll be like, fuck this shit!
3754096	3755296	We're totally going to do that.
3755316	3756096	That would be hilarious.
3756116	3757017	We will totally do that.
3757037	3760557	We'll set something up where we can start a small fire and it will be safe.
3761058	3765839	And we will set the PlayStation Eye on fire live during a match on the PlayStation Online Store.
3765919	3766879	I love this idea.
3767259	3767679	I love it.
3768399	3770120	I like anything that involves fire, Rob.
3770300	3770620	All right.
3771000	3771240	Awesome.
3771260	3772760	Well, how about something that doesn't suck?
3772960	3773260	All right.
3773520	3773960	How about it?
3774161	3777201	Metal Gear Solid 4, which is full of happy and joy.
3778501	3780162	Kojima was saying that...
3781587	3785588	The Metal Gear Online experience is going to include a starter pack.
3786888	3792669	I'm trying to look through this to see exactly what this starter pack is.
3793590	3794970	It's like an online starter pack.
3795670	3801091	I'm not seeing anything too specific, but maybe it's... This is like a glorious demo of the game.
3801731	3802071	Yeah.
3802492	3808653	Can I say this real quick while you're... Oh, you can pull over enemies in a barrel.
3809619	3811001	Somebody in chat sent me a message.
3811021	3811562	This is hilarious.
3811963	3817874	SSJ100Matt says, If the Eye of Judgment becomes a success, Loki must promise to dress up as Tingle.
3821172	3823613	I will take that bet because I know... Whoa!
3823793	3824553	He took the bet!
3824573	3828215	I know it will not... Ladies and gentlemen, everybody must go out.
3828235	3828675	You have it.
3828695	3831896	You record... Timestamp this, record it, put it in the archive.
3832156	3833197	The bet has been taken.
3833577	3835277	Okay, now we have to... Wait, hold on.
3835297	3836938	Now, we need to make... Set the parameters here.
3836978	3838299	Now, you said a success.
3838479	3840159	What do you mean exactly by success?
3840179	3843020	Because that's very general and very broad.
3843040	3845801	I mean, it needs to sell, like, say, a million units.
3845841	3846302	How about that?
3846422	3847362	Is that a success?
3847442	3849683	If the Eye of Judgment sells a million units...
3850535	3851736	Loki will dress up as Tingle.
3851796	3854176	I will dress up as Tingle.
3854917	3858918	I guarantee if that thing sells a million copies, which it will not.
3858958	3860279	Wait, worldwide or domestic?
3860619	3862980	You gotta be specific, because the damn thing could take off in Japan.
3863618	3864118	You never know.
3864478	3867019	I'll go as far as saying worldwide.
3868280	3868980	Holy shit!
3869040	3869920	I don't think it'll do anything.
3869940	3872241	I don't know how many billion people in the world.
3872301	3877663	That's like saying one in four people buys this thing that owns a PlayStation 3, and there's no way that's going to happen.
3878183	3880864	Suddenly, everybody in chat has just pre-ordered the Eye of Judgment.
3881324	3882085	Go right ahead.
3882345	3882926	Worldwide.
3883086	3885368	I bet you anything that will not sell a million copies.
3885668	3890232	Wait, we have to set a deadline here because a million copies could happen like eight years from now.
3890272	3891553	Okay, six months after release.
3891593	3892234	Six months, okay.
3892274	3893395	That's six months after release.
3893835	3897319	Okay, one million copies worldwide within six months.
3897939	3898279	All right.
3898920	3899701	All right, you got it.
3899881	3900261	You got it.
3900301	3902323	Don't forget, chat room, don't let him forget this.
3902703	3904105	You are all witnesses.
3905774	3906934	and I will take many, many videos.
3906954	3907835	Oh, god damn.
3907955	3912016	I'm even going to go out and buy the Eye of Judgment now just to destroy it and get us one step closer.
3912036	3912936	This is going on YouTube.
3912976	3915097	To Loki dressing up as YouTube.
3915237	3917597	Dressing up as Tingle and the whole thing being put on YouTube.
3917917	3918498	Here's the best part.
3918538	3926720	If it sells a million units, Loki will be dressed up as Tingle, burning on fire and no one will get it.
3928334	3929935	Can you imagine our poor opponent?
3930235	3934078	Okay, cosplayers who listen to the show, we'll be sending you measurements.
3934378	3935739	And here's the thing.
3936439	3940482	We have to be playing Bobby Blackwolf when it happens, and nobody tell him what's going to happen.
3942043	3946526	Because Bobby was your first friend on the PlayStation 3, so nobody tell Blackwolf what we're up to.
3946546	3947566	Is he going to buy that?
3947667	3948267	But he'll be the one.
3948347	3948687	I don't know.
3948727	3950849	We'll send him a copy just to make this happen, okay?
3950869	3954451	Well, how about to go back to Metal Gear Solid 4?
3954551	3955131	I'm sorry, yes.
3955151	3956112	I'm still cracking up.
3956561	3965223	They're basically saying that some of the gameplay that's going to be involved in that little demo was like it was saying rolling over enemies with a barrel and then shooting people into the air with a cannon.
3966503	3967023	That's fun.
3967864	3968064	Yeah.
3968364	3974225	Do you get to do those moves like he does in Super Smash Brothers where he comes up behind somebody and looks like he's about to, you know, ass rape him?
3975565	3976546	He does that in all the other games.
3976586	3976926	Why not?
3977166	3977466	All right.
3977506	3977946	Sounds like fun.
3979600	3982862	Anyways... Sorry, I had too good of a laugh.
3983182	3997849	In case you don't get enough of browsing the PlayStation 3 store, because, you know, there's a whole lot to look at on there, you will now also have the ability to browse the store on the PC soon.
3998689	4005773	So you'll be able to purchase PSP content without using the PS3, and also...
4007881	4013144	I think that's all it's being used for right now, is basically PSP content.
4013425	4019048	Because I guess a lot of people don't have a PS3, so if they want to download those... Really?
4019088	4020249	A lot of people don't have a PlayStation 3?
4020289	4021270	Yeah, I know, surprising.
4022150	4025793	If they want to download those PS1 games, now they can do that.
4026453	4027194	Hooray!
4028590	4033372	Well, the thing that got everybody excited about a PlayStation 3 earlier this year was PlayStation Home.
4033652	4039994	And if you were hoping to play PlayStation Home this year, you better hope you're in the beta because otherwise you're not playing it until spring of 2008.
4040194	4042835	Oh, something delayed on the PlayStation 3?
4043336	4044416	I know, who would have thunk it?
4044916	4048978	This bombshell was announced by Kaz Hirai during the Tokyo Game Show press conference.
4050918	4053919	Seriously, everything that comes out on the PlayStation 3 has been delayed lately.
4053960	4056741	I mean, like Skate came out a couple weeks later.
4057661	4057921	Was it
4058684	4061025	Stuntman Ignition came out almost a month later.
4061425	4064427	Stranglehold's been delayed again to the end of October now.
4064507	4067889	Which just goes to show the PlayStation 3 should have waited before it released.
4068189	4070010	But anyway, that's old news now.
4070070	4074092	It should have released this year, but... Gears 2's coming out about a month later?
4076056	4077818	You know, here's the thing, though.
4077878	4082821	Despite all the shit I'm talking about, if it's that awesome, maybe it'll be worth the wait.
4083282	4094570	You know, I'd rather they do release it bug-free or with as few bugs as possible and just really awesome and the killer app to have for the PlayStation rather than them rush it to make it for this year.
4095230	4095471	Right?
4096231	4099634	They'll eventually decide to charge for it once, you know, it's been so long.
4100274	4101215	It might be worth it.
4101615	4102336	That's a big might.
4103156	4103757	Big might.
4104377	4104978	But it might be worth it.
4104998	4105458	It has potential.
4106641	4107082	But we'll see.
4107883	4112368	Meanwhile, I still have no reason to get a PlayStation 3 until Final Fantasy XIII comes out.
4113229	4115833	So, that's all I have to say on PlayStation Home.
4116453	4116974	Being delayed.
4118055	4124183	Well, for those who are keeping up with some of the news out of the Tokyo Game Show, there is a new Kingdom Hearts...
4126343	4132388	Well, more, I would say, additions to the Kingdom Hearts franchise to be out on DS, PSP, and mobile phones.
4133769	4140034	There is going to be Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep for the PSP.
4140154	4143857	It's a single-player RPG like the PS2 one.
4144738	4152525	Kingdom Hearts 358-2 Days for the DS, which is a 3D game with Roxas.
4153445	4153606	And...
4154781	4156882	And also we'll have a four-way multiplayer mode.
4156922	4160864	And the last one is Kingdom Hearts Coded that is on mobile phones.
4162025	4163445	Coded sounds actually pretty cool.
4163505	4169168	It's like the original Kingdom Hearts game, but you can almost like edit the worlds or something as you're playing through it.
4169208	4172090	It's like the Matrix and Kingdom Hearts together.
4172490	4181854	That actually, though, after playing Kingdom Hearts 2, at least from the beginning of it, makes perfect sense if it's like set in, you know, I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but if it's set like in dude's computer.
4182655	4182835	Hmm.
4183214	4185519	Remember with Roxas and all that.
4185800	4186943	I never beat Kingdom Hearts 2.
4187003	4188246	But you did play at the beginning, right?
4188266	4188566	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4188586	4189649	So you know what I'm talking about.
4189669	4190130	Yeah, I do, I do.
4190874	4193335	Um, I'm, uh, I'm looking forward to the games.
4193355	4193956	I'll check them out.
4194036	4195597	I mean, hopefully they're better than Chain of Memories.
4195797	4198658	But, um, as long as the Disney stuff stays intact.
4199058	4200579	Because that's the one thing that always worries me.
4200639	4204181	It worried me about that, uh, Final Mix trailer or whatever it was at the end of Kingdom Hearts 2.
4204661	4207183	Like, it was very, very not Disney related.
4207263	4209404	And to me, that's a big charm of the series.
4209944	4211185	You know, come on.
4211345	4213666	Tron World was like the awesomest part of Kingdom Hearts 2.
4213726	4213786	So...
4215993	4217335	Dragon Quest IX Final Fantasy XIV DS
4232668	4237871	One good thing we can say about the PlayStation 3 is that it has really helped the Folding at Home project.
4237931	4244695	In fact, they have made the milestone achievement of reaching one petroflop.
4245015	4248677	That's one quadrillion floating point operations per second.
4250918	4258463	Basically, it would take everyone in the world 75,000 calculations in a second to achieve a similar result.
4260103	4260924	That's pretty awesome.
4263393	4263873	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4288620	4293523	Going to comments from chat, they're a little bit delayed, so sometimes we report on the last story.
4293983	4299806	TheRobD says, Sky, none of the Kingdom Hearts 2 stuff had Disney stuff in there either, so Kingdom Hearts will have Disney.
4300466	4306709	And WonderDogHerald says, singing along with the Little Mermaid was the best part of Kingdom Hearts 2, not Tron, but the Little Mermaid.
4306729	4312672	Those parts sucked because the songs were awful, but, the original songs, but they were even worse in Japanese.
4315017	4317018	But the Little Mermaid has awesome music.
4317478	4321980	Well, the songs that were from the Little Mermaid were good, but the ones that they made up for the game sucked ass.
4322220	4328342	The Japanese ones were pretty... Yeah, but the songs were actually worse than Japanese, including the originals.
4328643	4331604	And theRobD just wanted to clarify he meant the trailers.
4332004	4334285	Well, yeah, I got that, but hopefully the listeners did too.
4335926	4339047	And Ghost in our chatroom says, World of Warcraft causes cancer.
4340567	4344229	If you're smoking and playing WoW at the same time, which I've seen people do, it just might.
4345964	4349407	and drinking, then you're going to have all sorts of problems.
4350608	4358635	Well, the MotorStorm developers are not going to have a problem making money anymore because they just got bought from Sony.
4359075	4363939	Sony bought Evolution Studios and its subsidiary, Big Big Studios.
4364159	4372166	They made Pursuit Force, but of course Evolution Studios were the makers of MotorStorm and lots of Sony fans very happy with the game MotorStorm and Sony's very happy with it too.
4372946	4379931	Evolution has also unveiled that since they've been purchased, they've also been given the go-ahead to make Motorstorm 2.
4380551	4384133	Which, as a side note, Nintendo, make Excite Truck 2.
4385814	4386735	My wife demands it.
4386975	4387475	Excite Truck 2?
4388096	4388656	Excite Truck 2.
4390117	4391258	Or Excite something else.
4391298	4392719	It could be like Excite Boat.
4392899	4393239	I don't know.
4394340	4394520	No.
4395621	4396281	That won't work.
4396741	4399183	We do not need another Hydro Thunder game.
4400106	4402067	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4424344	4425825	Come down, I think, the next week or two.
4427105	4427505	Very cool.
4428045	4431227	Well, congrats, Sony, on your marriage with these new companies.
4431787	4432987	Congrats to DarkSakura.
4433007	4433968	Let the humping start.
4434228	4438670	Congrats to DarkSakura for finding yet another website to share with our listeners tonight.
4439130	4443151	And this is the next to the last Website of the Week segment.
4443171	4443732	Can you believe it?
4443912	4444392	I know.
4445112	4454775	Last, or I should say next week will be DarkSakura's final website of the week because in the next series of episodes starting with 250, she's going to be doing the classic game of the week.
4455095	4455315	Yep.
4455475	4456036	Which will be fun.
4456516	4461217	So until then though, she surfs the internet up and down finding her last few websites to share with you.
4461517	4462678	She's got one for you this week.
4463018	4464158	Take it away, Miss DarkSakura.
4466699	4470220	The website of the week is actually one given to me by Sauce.
4470920	4472441	It's retrojunk.com.
4473971	4477973	RetroJunk.com And this site is the best ever.
4479033	4479673	Ever.
4480333	4485335	You have everything from old TV show intros to commercials including video game commercials.
4485716	4486496	Oh my god, Rob.
4486836	4495199	I found out that a game that I loved that was a PC game was actually on the Turbo Duo and now I have to find it even though it's $30 on eBay.
4495659	4496500	Dang, what game was that?
4496720	4497020	Loom.
4497940	4498861	Loom is rad.
4499081	4499781	I love Loom.
4500821	4501382	Good choice.
4501822	4502362	But, um...
4503240	4520330	There's a... In fact, on their main page, they actually have an article about the Sega Master System, which I don't know if anyone knows, the Sega Master System was actually still going pretty strong in Brazil for a very long time, with a lot of games that came out on 16-bit and later coming out over there on this 8-bit system.
4522091	4523192	Lots of really cool stuff.
4523232	4532377	I mean, just some of the TV intros listed on the main page is Danger Mouse and Voltron Hunter, Robocop,
4533254	4537037	The commercials listed are like old Nickelodeon commercials from 1982.
4537297	4538698	That's awesome.
4538939	4539799	Private Benjamin.
4540180	4542241	And I'm sure YouTube just makes this shit even better.
4542782	4544083	Now, because everything's on YouTube now.
4544183	4549567	Actually, all of this stuff, from what I understand, I don't think these are links out of YouTube but hosted on their own thing.
4549667	4550488	Oh, cool.
4550528	4553110	As much of the stuff on there is actually pretty damn good quality.
4553850	4554751	Nice.
4554851	4556893	One thing that I was actually watching, the Voltron one.
4556953	4557613	Oh, my God.
4558133	4562537	There's an article on here that's 80s movies you hate to love, and it's got a picture of Shona from The Last Dragon.
4563852	4564492	Show Nuff.
4564973	4565913	Who's the master?
4566013	4566673	Show Nuff.
4567054	4567294	Yep.
4567994	4573137	And some of the trailers on here is like the Brave Little Toaster and King Kong vs. Godzilla.
4574818	4575158	Wow.
4575438	4576398	This is pretty cool.
4576758	4579260	It has stuff dating back to the 60s, 70s, 80s.
4579320	4579860	I think 60s.
4579960	4583062	But definitely the 70s, 80s, and 90s.
4583382	4587164	And lots of just really awesome retro stuff.
4587484	4588404	Pretty, pretty fun.
4589225	4591746	What I was trying to mention is I went back to watch the Voltron one.
4592822	4596844	and it actually had the Go Lion intro and outro on it.
4598044	4600485	A lot of the chatroom seems... And David the Gnome, Loki.
4600905	4603987	A lot of the chatroom gives your website of the week their seal of approval.
4604707	4605867	I'll be linking this in the chatroom.
4605947	4609989	Also, if anyone is curious, there also is a forum on here.
4610409	4613951	It looks like they are talking about, oh, do you remember this?
4614111	4615691	Do you want to see this?
4616092	4617632	I'm trying to remember the name of this show.
4618333	4618913	That type of thing.
4618933	4621794	And there's one on here that says, which video game songs made you tear up?
4624646	4625907	I had one that made me cry.
4626147	4626548	What's that?
4626968	4627688	It was Eyes on Me.
4629249	4630050	Aw, wimp.
4630890	4631331	Just kidding.
4631371	4633892	I'm a girl, I'm allowed.
4634012	4635453	To bite my ass raw.
4635493	4637515	I was getting a little choked up at Eternal Sonata.
4637535	4639136	I didn't cry, but I was getting a little choked up.
4639236	4640056	I was getting verklempt.
4640817	4642318	Talk amongst yourselves.
4642818	4644499	Eternal Sonata made me a little verklempt.
4645480	4646320	Eternal Sonata.
4646420	4647981	Neither Eternal nor Sonata.
4648041	4648622	Disgust.
4648642	4648782	Disgust.
4651583	4656627	555-4444 Anyhow, Loki, please save this program.
4658449	4660070	What is Africa?
4660891	4666095	Sure, we know it's a continent in the world, but really, what is Africa the game?
4666815	4674141	Well, it is a Pokemon Snap type of jungle safari game where you drive around and you take pictures of wildlife.
4674161	4675002	That's awesome!
4675302	4675783	Africa!
4676183	4677444	No, I totally want to play that.
4678525	4679626	So it's Africa Snap?
4679646	4679726	Yeah.
4680279	4681040	Apparently, yeah.
4681220	4681680	Rad!
4682200	4698953	The only way I will play this game, and goddammit, it better be possible, and I know it won't be because they're going to pussy out, is if I can't drive my jeep all over the savannah, destroying wildlife as it rolls underneath my tires.
4699393	4702175	That is the only way I will play this game.
4703976	4707499	They're going to put the fucking things on a track, you know it, just like in Pokemon Snap.
4711700	4713823	I'm totally gonna play this game.
4715664	4719188	I fished out money for the Cardcaptor Sakura game just because I thought it was like Pokemon Snap.
4719728	4721009	And I wanted a clock and a plate.
4721350	4722611	Pokemon Snap is fucking rad.
4722651	4724373	It's like one of the most underrated games in my opinion.
4724393	4726355	The Cardcaptor Sakura game, however, is not.
4726595	4730919	But it comes with a clock and a plate, a knife, a fork, spoon, and a pillowcase.
4736115	4737056	It was on Dreamcast.
4737236	4741539	Ranma says the game should be like Jumbo Safari, and I agree, because Jumbo Safari is awesome.
4743060	4743400	Let's see.
4744821	4748523	Tigerclaw says, I'm more curious how the AI in the game is like.
4748963	4751625	Like, if you see a pride of lion, will it show them getting it on?
4752005	4753987	Will it show them eating something?
4754607	4757609	I want to see blood in this game.
4757669	4758870	I want M-rated Africa.
4760331	4763793	We want monkeys flinging poo, lions doing it,
4764432	4765753	and lots of carnivorous death.
4766514	4771758	The Rob D says, is Debbie Downer today saying, I don't think Africa is going to be a sandbox GTA game.
4772698	4776321	I don't know why they're making this out to be a big game for the PlayStation 3.
4776762	4779984	It's just like, it's going to be yet another disappointment.
4780084	4785388	Yet another average game where it's like, look, it's the most realistic African safari ever!
4785769	4786769	Then people will be like, so?
4786969	4788431	We need people to actually get shot.
4788511	4791473	I'm not buying your fucking $600 system for an African safari.
4792025	4792465	Fuck you.
4792685	4796268	Mr. DeBucket says, Africa is a former Hot Shots Golf 5 minigame.
4796568	4798229	You used to shoot gold balls at the animal.
4799490	4800291	That's a bit weird.
4800891	4803873	Someone, GS68, was bringing up Let's Go Jungle.
4805114	4806555	A rail shooter where you shoot the wildlife.
4807956	4812239	If you want to join in the fun, chat.orangeonstrater.com where we do tapes.
4812279	4814001	I did not want to kill the animals.
4814401	4817043	I wanted to see the animals killing other animals.
4817063	4817543	That's right.
4818084	4820045	Like I said, carnivorous death.
4821229	4822670	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
4842136	4842936	for PlayStation 3.
4870672	4872013	I want a lolcats game.
4872033	4874233	Mr. DeBucket says we need a ceiling cat game.
4874353	4874694	Winner!
4874934	4875174	Winner!
4875194	4876674	We need a ceiling cat game!
4876874	4884017	But if you've been on cat macros on LiveJournal lately, it's all nothing but fucking ceiling cat lately.
4884477	4889459	Everyone is picking any word that ends in 8 and making a ceiling cat macro to it.
4892513	4896614	Sealing Cat is watching you masticate or fornicate or abbreviate.
4896874	4899295	But my favorite one, two people did this.
4899315	4902996	They did one with Daleks and it says, Sealing Cat is watching you exterminate.
4903657	4904297	That was great.
4906798	4907998	There's one with Bill O'Reilly.
4908038	4909819	Sealing Cat is watching you bloviate.
4911679	4912039	Let's see.
4913020	4914440	There's some of the older ones.
4914580	4916361	One of these was like a marathon post.
4916901	4917141	Yeah.
4918533	4919614	It had, like, everything.
4919634	4922616	And one of them is, Sealing Cat is watching you look for words that end in 8.
4923437	4925318	Sealing Cat is watching you conjugate.
4925358	4927500	Sealing Cat is watching you regurgitate.
4927940	4929601	Sealing Cat is watching you vegetate.
4929661	4931162	Sealing Cat is watching you spin a plate.
4931643	4933304	Sealing Cat is watching you precipitate.
4934044	4936246	Sealing Cat is watching you permutate.
4936966	4938568	Sealing Cat is watching you obliviate.
4938648	4940149	With a Harry Potter reference there.
4940209	4942410	Sealing Cat is watching you percolate at a Starbucks there.
4942831	4945012	Sealing Cat is watching you animate with The Simpsons.
4945933	4947314	This is my favorite, The Little Truck.
4948166	4950007	Sealing Cat is watching you compensate.
4951768	4956171	Anyway, I'll link that in chat because I'm sure the podcast listeners are like... I like Sealing Cat is doing a figure eight.
4956371	4957772	Dude, what the hell did I sign up for?
4958833	4960214	Yeah, Wonder Dog Herald is right on.
4960234	4962375	It says it's like green eggs and ham for a new generation.
4964776	4965397	Can you imagine?
4965697	4969079	That is untapped profit right there.
4969239	4970220	What, the Seuss series?
4970660	4973822	No, to make children's books with internet access.
4974918	4976039	Sealing Cat is watching this show suck.
4976059	4977279	Oh, that didn't end at 8.
4977319	4977420	Sorry.
4977440	4980101	Well, what can save a show from going downhill is a good old story that relates to porn.
4996428	4999109	or in this sense, Eroticness.
4999749	5009111	In World of Warcraft, that's right, an erotic role-playing guild that was spanned across two realms has been disabled by Blizzard.
5009631	5014492	Blizzard forcibly disbanded the guild, but of course they just went and made it under a new name.
5014532	5019754	The guild, Abhorrent Taboo, is a horde-side RP guild on Ravenholt, which is
5021661	5024242	Almost the name of the server I play on, Ravencrest.
5024822	5028143	It had an alliance chapter on Blackwater Raiders.
5029343	5031944	Here was their welcome message on their forums.
5032384	5033824	Quote, role-playing is legal.
5033984	5039606	Even if you are role-playing something that wouldn't be considered deplorable and highly illegal in real life, it's still just role-playing.
5039626	5041947	It isn't subject to any form of disciplinary action.
5042347	5043887	Negative publicity is still publicity.
5043947	5045788	Make a dig or website about how sick we are.
5046068	5047408	Report us to perverted justice.
5047468	5048748	All it does is bring in more members.
5048829	5050529	In fact, the dig guy on Ravenholt said,
5051469	5055771	made about us was so effective, several people signed up for WoW just to be in our guild.
5055831	5060172	The bottom line is we're allowed to do what we want on any server we please and no one can do anything about it.
5061292	5072796	And those types of things, by the way, would be extreme sexual situations, meaning sometimes with folks that are under 18, blah, blah, blah, et cetera, et cetera.
5072856	5073796	Use your imagination here.
5074376	5075777	Yeah, but it's all in game.
5075817	5077077	It's all fake anyways.
5077357	5079038	So are you saying it's okay?
5079958	5080859	It's all in game.
5080920	5084425	They're not going out and actually having sex with children or something like that.
5084825	5088570	Unless if they are, then that's wrong, but it's all in game.
5089752	5095801	Let them end up on an episode of Dateline or something like that.
5096968	5101170	Yeah, you know, I'm kind of torn on this, is that, you know, I do believe censorship is wrong.
5101690	5109373	At the same time, there's probably some pretty, I mean, there might be some normal people that are trying to, you know, this gives a bad name to role players everywhere is what it really does.
5110373	5114515	But, you know, at the same time, Blizzard has the right to do whatever they want with their servers.
5115115	5116996	All they need to do is just go second life.
5117316	5119277	I mean, come on.
5120717	5122058	Way worse than what we're doing.
5123627	5127048	To which Mr. DeBucket says, Pedobear is watching you play World of Warcraft.
5128029	5129269	I guess that's a play on Sealing Cat?
5129289	5129789	I have no idea.
5132370	5133631	No, Pedobear, you don't get it.
5133931	5134891	Yeah, yeah, I get it.
5136292	5149877	I guess what's been going on for a while is that I never noticed these guys in-game, but folks have been petitioning customer service and posting in the suggestion forums wanting people to do stuff about this extreme roleplay, and finally this guild was forcibly disbanded.
5151358	5152919	Let's see if there's a comment from Blizzard here.
5152979	5153279	Oh, yes.
5153899	5158802	Quote, this matter is not one Blizzard takes lightly in any way, shape, or form.
5158962	5161203	We do not wish to have this topic continue circulation.
5161683	5169887	Let it finally be said that we appreciate those of you who brought this particular issue to our attention and that we will continue to follow up with this matter in the future to ensure the safety of all parties is concerned.
5170587	5171988	By the way, the guild is reformed.
5172048	5174089	Their new name is Vile Anathema.
5176044	5176485	Anathema.
5176725	5177186	Anathema.
5177706	5178547	What does that even mean?
5178608	5178968	I don't know.
5179709	5181471	It means it's a front.
5183454	5183734	Cute.
5185697	5186318	Well, there you go.
5187920	5190043	I don't know if I'd really call that erotic in WoW.
5190383	5193708	Just kind of crazies people in WoW.
5195769	5197590	I'm curious what you guys in the chat room think.
5197650	5206177	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Legend of Zaku says, Loki, I'm sorry, but speaking in a sexually suggestive manner to a minor is not protected speech.
5207058	5215504	By the way, dictionary definition, a thing that is detested or loathed, cursed, or consigned to damnation or destruction.
5216825	5218126	At least they have a sense of humor about it.
5219407	5220728	Thought that you would find that amusing.
5221021	5221782	PS2 Nerf Wireless Controller
5244661	5253130	I think it's actually DarkTesia posted a link in LiveJournal about this and I want one so I can throw my controller at the screen and not break my TV.
5253330	5254591	You know, lots of people do that.
5255732	5257073	Throw their controllers everywhere.
5257094	5257894	This is so smart.
5258054	5258875	I mean, seriously.
5259936	5261458	To read the description on GameStop.com
5263631	5290497	the Nerf wireless controller from Pelican allows gamers to play like a pro baller on their PlayStation 2 the controllers are made from soft pliable Nerf material on the outside but feature legendary Pelican performance on the inside legendary my ass they are tough enough to withstand hardcore squeezing throwing twisting spiking and feel like no other controller on the market and there's retail for $24.99 I thought those came out like a long time ago I don't know if they did but I want one
5291763	5293346	Maybe it's a new version or something, who knows?
5293726	5295950	They're kind of ugly but adorable.
5298375	5299397	They're like an ugly baby.
5302765	5305568	All right, and on that note, I think we'll bring Part A to a close.
5305588	5307790	We've gone long tonight on Part A. I guess we have a lot to say.
