Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.240 --> 00:24.440
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, September the 30th

00:24.440 --> 00:29.120
of 2007, I almost said 2008, what's wrong with me?

00:29.120 --> 00:33.640
We're getting into October, very soon, and gosh, where did the year go?

00:33.640 --> 00:38.520
I don't know, pretty soon we're going to be getting into just this games upon games

00:38.520 --> 00:39.520
upon game release.

00:39.520 --> 00:42.400
Well, really, we're kind of already in the middle of that, really, with the launch of

00:42.400 --> 00:47.760
Halo 3 and Bioshock, we're really in the gaming season.

00:47.760 --> 00:50.740
So be good or Santa's not going to bring you the games you want.

00:50.740 --> 00:54.660
But we will keep bringing you the gaming news you want, whether you've been good or bad.

00:54.660 --> 00:57.120
So we're going to get right back into some gaming news, aren't we, Loki?

00:57.120 --> 01:03.440
Yes, and you know, this game's kind of interesting, I don't know how popular it's going to be,

01:03.440 --> 01:06.840
because you've got, you know, kind of conflicting elements to it.

01:06.840 --> 01:15.400
For example, well Mario and Sonic at the Olympics, now Mario and Sonic games, those are good.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.640
Olympic games, those are usually bad.

01:17.640 --> 01:22.220
So it's kind of, I don't know, I don't know if it's going to be good or not.

01:22.220 --> 01:24.660
Either way, this could go either way.

01:24.660 --> 01:31.320
Either way, there will be 16 characters, including your favorites from both the Sonic and Mario

01:31.320 --> 01:33.440
and I guess Nintendo universes.

01:33.440 --> 01:39.700
Although what's weird though is I do see the villain from one of the alligators from the

01:39.700 --> 01:44.160
Donkey Kong Country franchises, yet no Donkey Kong.

01:44.160 --> 01:45.160
Odd.

01:45.160 --> 01:47.380
So that was kind of neat.

01:47.380 --> 01:55.680
And then, you know, they have of course Sonic and Knuckles and Tails and etc.

01:55.680 --> 02:01.880
So anyways, some of the events that you're going to see in there, fencing, they've got

02:01.880 --> 02:02.880
that.

02:02.880 --> 02:10.080
Archery, shooting skeet, gymnastics, including trampoline and vault, high jump, pole vault,

02:10.080 --> 02:17.200
long jump, triple jump, javelin throw, hammer throw, single skulls for rowing of course,

02:17.200 --> 02:23.680
table tennis, aquatics in both the 100 meter and of course the 4 lap 100 meter.

02:23.680 --> 02:30.960
And let's see here, tracks of course, 110 meter, 400 meter hurdles, 100 meter relay

02:30.960 --> 02:36.280
and the just normal 100 meter and 400 meter.

02:36.280 --> 02:37.760
So lots of running and stuff.

02:37.760 --> 02:38.760
I don't know.

02:38.760 --> 02:41.900
I still don't understand how Mario is ever going to beat Sonic in running.

02:41.900 --> 02:44.120
Like nobody's been able to explain this logic to me.

02:44.120 --> 02:49.080
Like did they give Sonic some like drugs to slow him down or Mario some steroids?

02:49.080 --> 02:51.800
I mean what, how is that ever going to be an even match?

02:51.800 --> 02:56.240
The characters in the game, I mean it's, they've kind of broken them up like they did with

02:56.240 --> 03:01.760
Mario Kart where you've got the power types, you know, the ones that are more of the robust

03:01.760 --> 03:07.840
characters like Bowser and you know Wario, stuff like that, and Knuckles is in there

03:07.840 --> 03:08.840
too.

03:08.840 --> 03:09.840
So apparently Knuckles is a fat ass.

03:09.840 --> 03:12.360
Well, he's a fatty.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.400
But they say, well he does have a little bit of a gut.

03:14.400 --> 03:18.000
What they're saying, Dark Knight says in our chat room at chat.orangelandsreading.com,

03:18.000 --> 03:19.120
they balance the characters.

03:19.120 --> 03:23.280
I understand they balance the characters but that still doesn't make sense in the regards

03:23.280 --> 03:27.360
of that Sonic, you know, runs very fast and Mario runs kind of fast.

03:27.360 --> 03:33.700
They also have all round characters which Mario falls under as well as Luigi and apparently

03:33.700 --> 03:36.240
also the two chicks from the Sonic universe.

03:36.240 --> 03:39.760
So Mario and Luigi, you're as powerful as chicks.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.440
Way to go, pansies.

03:41.440 --> 03:42.440
Anyways and then...

03:42.440 --> 03:45.240
Woah, I think there might be some women a little angry at that comment.

03:45.240 --> 03:50.080
Well, I mean, honestly.

03:50.080 --> 03:54.640
Mr. DeBucket in chat says they wouldn't let Bowser into the Chinese Olympics.

03:54.640 --> 03:55.640
Yeah.

03:55.640 --> 04:01.520
And then of course for the speed types, you have Sonic, you actually have, what's his

04:01.520 --> 04:02.520
name...

04:02.520 --> 04:03.520
Tails.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.880
Oh, the crappy game, what was the crappy game?

04:06.880 --> 04:07.880
Driver.

04:07.880 --> 04:11.400
No, the Sonic game, crappy Sonic game.

04:11.400 --> 04:12.400
Sonic the Hedgehog.

04:12.400 --> 04:15.720
No, the last one that came out before Sonic...

04:15.720 --> 04:16.720
I don't know.

04:16.720 --> 04:17.720
The guy with the gun.

04:17.720 --> 04:18.720
I don't know.

04:18.720 --> 04:19.720
Oh, Shadow the Hedgehog?

04:19.720 --> 04:20.720
Shadow, yes.

04:20.720 --> 04:21.720
Thank you.

04:21.720 --> 04:26.400
Sorry, they all look alike and those games kind of blend together so pardon me for forgetting

04:26.400 --> 04:27.400
that crappy game.

04:27.400 --> 04:35.480
And then of course the skill types where you have Princess Peach, Tails, Waluigi, and Dr.

04:35.480 --> 04:36.840
Eggman.

04:36.840 --> 04:41.880
I hope Princess Peach will be able to use her emotional power in the Olympic game somehow.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.720
Well, that would be a skill, I guess.

04:43.720 --> 04:45.400
That's right, some type of skill.

04:45.400 --> 04:52.400
I don't know, so it's going to be all split up, who knows, I don't know, but to be honest,

04:52.400 --> 04:55.900
I don't like, I don't think I'm going to buy this game.

04:55.900 --> 04:56.900
It's just...

04:56.900 --> 04:57.900
Maybe I'd run it.

04:57.900 --> 05:03.360
All it seems to me is it's like, hey, we put out another crappy Olympics game, but we have

05:03.360 --> 05:07.280
Sonic and Mario this time, so you're going to buy it, right?

05:07.280 --> 05:08.280
Huh?

05:08.280 --> 05:09.280
Huh?

05:09.280 --> 05:10.280
Yeah?

05:10.280 --> 05:13.840
Maybe we'll have advertising for these games during the Olympics and that kind of crap,

05:13.840 --> 05:16.720
so cross promotion stuff.

05:16.720 --> 05:20.340
Be honest though, I think you guys are going to get suckered into buying another crappy

05:20.340 --> 05:24.460
Olympics game because it has characters that you like, so have at it.

05:24.460 --> 05:27.120
I'll be busy playing Super Mario Galaxy instead.

05:27.120 --> 05:31.720
Well, I will be busy playing Super Smash Brothers Brawl when that comes out.

05:31.720 --> 05:38.800
Oh yeah, upon its release, yes, and one thing that has lots of fanboys and girls very excited,

05:38.800 --> 05:42.800
especially if you're a David Hayter fanboy or fangirl, which I believe Dark Soccer is

05:42.800 --> 05:43.800
a David Hayter fangirl.

05:43.800 --> 05:46.160
Oh yeah, because he could just talk to me all day and I'll be happy.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.160
Do you watch his YouTube?

05:47.160 --> 05:51.200
Apparently, he has a YouTube site where he does all these little Q&A things and does

05:51.200 --> 05:52.200
stuff on there.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.200
I didn't know that.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.200
I'll have to check.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.200
You definitely should check that out.

05:55.200 --> 05:59.880
This guy named Archduke Chocula was checking it out and sent David Hayter a question that

05:59.880 --> 06:03.240
said, hello, David Hayter, I have to say you are one of the greatest voice actors ever

06:03.240 --> 06:05.800
and you do a great job as Snake.

06:05.800 --> 06:09.800
I was wondering, are you going to voice Snake in the Super Smash Brothers Brawl, to which

06:09.800 --> 06:14.320
David Hayter responded, I am indeed voicing Snake in Smash Brothers.

06:14.320 --> 06:18.880
I recorded it already and I believe that fans of both games are going to be extremely happy.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.080
It's very cool.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.240
That's all I can say.

06:21.240 --> 06:25.780
So this is authentic Snake now because it's the same voice actor and everything.

06:25.780 --> 06:33.000
So that's just one more cool thing that you can put on the ever-growing list of cool things

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
in Smash Brothers Brawl.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
I mean, seriously.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
I love David Hayter.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
They've got Resetti in there.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.760
Dude, they put fucking Resetti in Smash Brothers Brawl.

06:40.760 --> 06:41.760
That's great.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.200
What is he going to do, bitch at you until you die?

06:43.200 --> 06:46.520
He comes out and lectures you on the mechanics of how to play the game, I think.

06:46.520 --> 06:50.040
Wasn't that the impression I got from, I don't think he's like an item or anything.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.280
He lectures you on how to play the game.

06:51.280 --> 06:55.060
I want Mr. Saturn still in the game as an item because I love Mr. Saturn.

06:55.060 --> 06:56.680
I just want Ness.

06:56.680 --> 06:57.680
Is that too much to ask?

06:57.680 --> 06:58.680
PK Fire.

06:58.680 --> 07:01.960
Or how about like, was it Howard and Nestor?

07:01.960 --> 07:02.960
That'd be hilarious.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.600
Dark Knight says, I would love to have a Smash Brothers on the DS.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.040
Dude, I bet that'll be the next one.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.520
I bet that'll be the next one.

07:09.520 --> 07:10.520
Yeah.

07:10.520 --> 07:11.520
Anyway.

07:11.520 --> 07:17.140
Well, speaking of things, Nintendo, for Virtual Console coming out in the UK, Sin and Punishment

07:17.140 --> 07:22.240
is the recent addition, which was a Nintendo 64 game.

07:22.240 --> 07:30.000
Pretty cool game and it supposedly just came out looking really nice on the Wii, so it's

07:30.000 --> 07:38.360
out there for 1200 Wii points, which translates in money to 12 euro or 8 pounds 40.

07:38.360 --> 07:42.400
And then moving on to the next releases in the UK.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.160
Did you have a comment?

07:44.160 --> 07:45.160
Nope.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.160
I had no comments.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.840
You looked like you had anticipation.

07:47.840 --> 07:48.840
No.

07:48.840 --> 07:51.360
We also have The Legend of Hero Tanma.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.800
I would like Anticipation to be released on Virtual Console.

07:53.800 --> 07:54.800
That was an awesome game.

07:54.800 --> 07:55.800
Anticipation.

07:55.800 --> 07:56.800
No it wasn't.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.200
I see you shiver.

07:58.200 --> 07:59.200
With Anticipation.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.200
Okay.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.200
Never mind.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.200
Please move on.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.200
Say it!

08:03.200 --> 08:04.200
No.

08:04.200 --> 08:10.000
TurboGrafx-16 game, The Legend of Hero Tanma, 600 Wii points, which is a little platformer

08:10.000 --> 08:12.800
kind of like Wonder Boy.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.600
You go save a princess and do shit.

08:15.600 --> 08:16.600
So, yeah.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.160
You sure know how to sell those games.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.160
Yeah, whatever.

08:19.160 --> 08:20.160
Yeah, check out this game.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.480
You go save a princess and do shit.

08:21.480 --> 08:23.400
Dude, I'm saving the best for last.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.400
Alright.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.400
So it's Mario?

08:25.400 --> 08:26.400
No.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.400
Zelda?

08:27.400 --> 08:28.400
No.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.400
Just, you know, some princess.

08:29.400 --> 08:30.400
Wonder Boy!

08:30.400 --> 08:33.040
Wonder Boy in Monsterland did come out, didn't it?

08:33.040 --> 08:34.040
Mmm.

08:34.040 --> 08:35.040
I think so.

08:35.040 --> 08:36.040
I love Wonder Boy in Monsterland.

08:36.040 --> 08:37.040
But anyway.

08:37.040 --> 08:42.640
Gradius III, which was a SNES game, 900 Wii points.

08:42.640 --> 08:45.160
And dude, it's fucking Gradius, so you won it right now.

08:45.160 --> 08:51.040
And I think that's also part of that Japanese gamey thing that, you know, are the releasing

08:51.040 --> 08:53.560
games in the UK that we don't have over here.

08:53.560 --> 08:54.560
Gradius III.

08:54.560 --> 08:55.560
Sad.

08:55.560 --> 08:58.960
I actually have Gradius III, though.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.040
It's in the Gradius collection on PSP.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.640
Well, but I actually have a cart.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.400
Well, can I touch you?

09:05.400 --> 09:06.400
You're just so cool.

09:06.400 --> 09:07.400
I have Gradius II.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.880
I just want a little piece of your coolness.

09:08.880 --> 09:13.680
I have Gradius II on Turbo Duo, which is the best version of that game ever.

09:13.680 --> 09:17.080
Can we get to another story before Jamie's ego gets too big?

09:17.080 --> 09:18.080
She can't leave my house.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.080
Yes.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.840
I have to have the ultimate gamer ego.

09:20.840 --> 09:26.440
Speaking of the Turbo Duo, there are going to be a couple games coming out, actually

09:26.440 --> 09:32.240
as part of the first Turbo CD games being announced for the Virtual Console.

09:32.240 --> 09:37.360
The first two are going to be Gates of Thunder, or Gate of Thunder.

09:37.360 --> 09:42.320
And they'll be coming out for 800 Wii points, as well as Super Air Zonk will be coming out

09:42.320 --> 09:43.320
as well.

09:43.320 --> 09:46.480
That was such a bizarre little game.

09:46.480 --> 09:50.520
Turbo Graphics XVI was a bizarre little console, so it makes perfect sense.

09:50.520 --> 09:53.800
But it has some great stuff on it.

09:53.800 --> 09:57.000
I pressed the bathroom door to get a copy of Pac-Land.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Remember the button?

09:58.000 --> 10:00.640
Oh my god, that was so long ago.

10:00.640 --> 10:01.640
I know, that was great.

10:01.640 --> 10:02.640
You have to set the door.

10:02.640 --> 10:05.360
Okay, well, we were at Classic Gaming Expo, right?

10:05.360 --> 10:08.080
And they were selling Pac-Land on the Turbo Graphics XVI.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.680
I was, what, $5 short?

10:09.680 --> 10:13.080
And Jamie was like, I want that, I just need $5 to get it.

10:13.080 --> 10:18.240
And so, what did we, there was this little, god, this is so stupid, I can't believe we're

10:18.240 --> 10:19.240
telling this story.

10:19.240 --> 10:20.680
It was the bathroom, there were three doors that had the automatic button.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.800
But seriously, Jamie, this was a, you had to be there thing.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.960
The listeners are going to be like, this story isn't funny at all.

10:24.960 --> 10:28.960
But I will do stuff for Turbo Graphics games.

10:28.960 --> 10:34.120
This little girl we saw, she ran up and pressed the button to open the handicapped restroom

10:34.120 --> 10:36.040
and then ran away.

10:36.040 --> 10:39.700
And for some reason this was the most hilarious thing in the world to us, like we were laughing

10:39.700 --> 10:40.700
and laughing at this little girl.

10:40.700 --> 10:41.700
We were that bored.

10:41.700 --> 10:43.160
And we, I guess so.

10:43.160 --> 10:47.200
So I said to Jamie, I said Jamie, if you mimic what that little girl just did, I'll give

10:47.200 --> 10:48.420
you $5.

10:48.420 --> 10:49.420
And she did it.

10:49.420 --> 10:50.420
We took pictures.

10:50.420 --> 10:51.420
They're somewhere.

10:51.420 --> 10:52.420
Because, I don't know.

10:52.420 --> 10:55.160
Do you know how many times I've played that copy of Pac-Land?

10:55.160 --> 10:56.160
Hmm.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.160
Once.

10:57.160 --> 10:58.160
Really?

10:58.160 --> 10:59.160
Not even on the actual duo.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.160
I played it on a Turbo Express.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.160
I want my $5 back.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.160
No.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.160
You can come play my game though.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.160
I don't wanna.

11:05.160 --> 11:10.840
Another game, well another Turbo Graphics game announced as well, Samurai Ghost.

11:10.840 --> 11:14.080
But of course that's not a Turbo CD title.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.760
Wow, more people just entered the studio.

11:16.760 --> 11:17.760
What is that?

11:17.760 --> 11:18.760
Keep going with the story.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.120
Ignore them for a minute.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.600
So that's it.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.560
All your Turbo CD games.

11:23.560 --> 11:25.460
Was that it?

11:25.460 --> 11:27.880
No more news on Turbo Graphics CD games?

11:27.880 --> 11:28.880
Nope.

11:28.880 --> 11:29.880
That was it.

11:29.880 --> 11:30.880
Well.

11:30.880 --> 11:38.140
Going back to Nintendo Wii, Fatal Frame is being developed for the Nintendo Wii.

11:38.140 --> 11:42.680
It's being developed by Grasshopper and it's being published by Tecmo.

11:42.680 --> 11:46.280
And it's being worked on very soon, I guess, right now.

11:46.280 --> 11:50.100
And it's kinda cool because Fatal Frame is very popular, well, it's no Silent Hill or

11:50.100 --> 11:55.220
Resident Evil, but it's probably on that secondary tier of scary video games and so we're always

11:55.220 --> 11:57.880
curious to see how games translate over to the Wii.

11:57.880 --> 12:01.860
But you can bet there'll probably be something to do with photography and the Wiimote and

12:01.860 --> 12:04.000
all that stuff.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.760
All that stuff is very, you know, specific, Rob.

12:07.760 --> 12:08.760
Absolutely.

12:08.760 --> 12:13.360
Well, this makes me a happy, happy, happy bunny.

12:13.360 --> 12:17.240
One of my favorite games ever...

12:17.240 --> 12:18.540
They're distracting me, Rob!

12:18.540 --> 12:20.440
To ignore them and read the story.

12:20.440 --> 12:27.380
One of my favorite ever games is Samba de Amigo and there is a statement that it is

12:27.380 --> 12:29.360
going to be on the Wii.

12:29.360 --> 12:36.360
It's supposedly this cover scan from Nintendo Power that's floating around ye old interwebs

12:36.360 --> 12:44.440
showing a Samba de Amigo for the Wii.

12:44.440 --> 12:47.840
Samba de Amigo on the Wii is going to be awesome.

12:47.840 --> 12:51.240
There's nothing, though, in the issue regarding gameplay, so...

12:51.240 --> 12:52.240
Alright.

12:52.240 --> 12:53.440
So, yeah.

12:53.440 --> 12:58.740
Anyway, let's introduce, you know, X-Defer and Rice Princess barged in here, so I thought

12:58.740 --> 13:00.280
I'd let them say hello.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.520
Well, hello there.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.800
I'm British now.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.120
What are you kids up to this evening?

13:07.120 --> 13:09.360
We basically came here to say hi.

13:09.360 --> 13:11.280
I haven't been on Orange Laundry in a while.

13:11.280 --> 13:12.640
Well, I mean, since I called in.

13:12.640 --> 13:13.640
I like it that way!

13:13.640 --> 13:14.640
Awwww.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.160
Were you here last week?

13:16.160 --> 13:18.360
Well, no, I called in last week.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.160
Oh, that's right.

13:20.160 --> 13:21.840
But I decided to...

13:21.840 --> 13:22.840
It's me and Rice Princess.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.840
Say hi, Rice Princess.

13:24.840 --> 13:28.320
Hi, Rice Princess.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.440
Okay.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.080
And we just want to say hi.

13:32.080 --> 13:35.960
And oh, yeah, we want you to do a song that we want on the cage match.

13:35.960 --> 13:37.920
Okay, well, that's after the show.

13:37.920 --> 13:39.120
We'll worry about that later.

13:39.120 --> 13:41.400
But for right now, what games have you guys been playing?

13:41.400 --> 13:42.400
You need to make this gaming-related.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.720
Don't just come onto the show and be all, hi, I'm here, and you should care about that,

13:45.720 --> 13:48.480
because, you know, we might have new listeners who don't know who the fuck you are.

13:48.480 --> 13:51.840
So, what kinds of games have you been playing this week?

13:51.840 --> 13:52.840
The Game of Life.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.840
No, I pulled in...

13:54.840 --> 13:56.240
You lost!

13:56.240 --> 14:03.280
I've been playing WoW and also Puzzle Quest, which is just usual stuff.

14:03.280 --> 14:07.360
I think that's what I said last week, Rice Princess.

14:07.360 --> 14:09.360
That is what you said last week.

14:09.360 --> 14:11.160
I'm just kidding.

14:11.160 --> 14:17.440
I've been playing WoW, and I played Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo last night at a certain

14:17.440 --> 14:22.320
party that was thrown that I attended.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.320
It was fun.

14:23.320 --> 14:27.960
Now, I have a question about Puzzle Fighter II, because you loved the one that was on

14:27.960 --> 14:30.320
Sony PlayStation and the old-school one.

14:30.320 --> 14:33.640
How does the Xbox 360 one compare?

14:33.640 --> 14:37.300
The game itself isn't bad, but the controller is god-awful.

14:37.300 --> 14:41.120
Like when I wanted to press down, it would go, like, to the left or to the right.

14:41.120 --> 14:42.120
It made me mad.

14:42.120 --> 14:43.680
Am I being too quiet?

14:43.680 --> 14:45.200
I'm sorry about that.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.240
I will raise my voice.

14:47.240 --> 14:52.840
Yeah, the game itself isn't bad, but the controller is, like, a nightmare to use to play that

14:52.840 --> 14:53.840
game.

14:53.840 --> 14:54.840
But, yeah.

14:54.840 --> 14:55.840
I enjoyed it thoroughly.

14:55.840 --> 14:56.840
Yep.

14:56.840 --> 15:01.280
Did you try the remix mode with the different drop patterns and stuff?

15:01.280 --> 15:02.280
No.

15:02.280 --> 15:03.280
What?

15:03.280 --> 15:05.160
I only went into one mode.

15:05.160 --> 15:08.440
I just kept pressing A until the game started, so.

15:08.440 --> 15:09.800
There's like way more to the game.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.120
There's, like, all these different, like, you can play modes where you don't even just

15:12.120 --> 15:13.120
make bricks.

15:13.120 --> 15:17.680
You make, like, different things, and you need to check out the game a little more thoroughly.

15:17.680 --> 15:20.280
That was a very bad review job you did.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.280
Fired!

15:21.280 --> 15:24.920
Well, listen, son of a bitch, you should have told me.

15:24.920 --> 15:25.920
I would have done that.

15:25.920 --> 15:30.320
I just kept pressing A because I really wanted to play the game, like, because I, you know

15:30.320 --> 15:34.360
what, I'm, like, the best at the game out of all of you, so.

15:34.360 --> 15:38.360
That's why you're making fun of me, because you're jealous of my skills.

15:38.360 --> 15:40.840
All right, no more derailing the show.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.240
We gotta get back to gaming news.

15:42.240 --> 15:45.320
So you can stay if you want to contribute to news, otherwise get out.

15:45.320 --> 15:49.760
Well, we actually, are we gonna go?

15:49.760 --> 15:52.800
I guess, way to put me on the spot.

15:52.800 --> 15:53.800
Oh, okay.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.200
Well, we can stay and listen.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.240
All right.

15:56.240 --> 15:57.240
You do that.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.240
Let's get back to some gaming news.

15:58.240 --> 16:01.080
All the listeners are like, back to gaming news?

16:01.080 --> 16:03.400
Well, yeah, now Irene's like, I gotta go look at Puzzle Fighter.

16:03.400 --> 16:04.400
All right.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.400
Anyways.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.400
Yes, please.

16:06.400 --> 16:11.000
So, apparently the BAFTA nominees are really coming around.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.240
For those not to know, that's the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.

16:16.240 --> 16:21.480
They've announced their nominees to the 2007 Video Game Awards, and topping the list is

16:21.480 --> 16:23.040
Wii Sports.

16:23.040 --> 16:29.360
With seven nominations, including Innovation and Best Game categories, and of course there's

16:29.360 --> 16:34.960
also a four-way tie for the second most nominations with Crackdown, awesome game, Gears of War,

16:34.960 --> 16:41.480
also awesome game, Akami, and God of War 2, all awesome games.

16:41.480 --> 16:43.360
I don't know if it should be Game of the Year, though.

16:43.360 --> 16:46.900
It's pretty rad, though, that they give it such good recognition, though, over there.

16:46.900 --> 16:50.160
Other nominees, of course, Bioshock, Crysis.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.280
How could Crysis be nominated?

16:51.280 --> 16:53.280
It's not even out yet.

16:53.280 --> 16:57.920
Gears of War, which I already mentioned, Guitar Hero 2, and Kane & Lynch.

16:57.920 --> 17:02.060
Also, Kane & Lynch is not out yet.

17:02.060 --> 17:07.880
They need a gaming Oscars, and I'm not talking about, like, what is it, the Spike TV Awards

17:07.880 --> 17:08.880
or whatever that crap is.

17:08.880 --> 17:09.880
The G4ia Awards.

17:09.880 --> 17:11.560
You know, does that even exist anymore?

17:11.560 --> 17:13.960
I think it's now, like, a segment on X-Play.

17:13.960 --> 17:14.960
It doesn't even matter.

17:14.960 --> 17:15.960
E4All presents.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.840
None of that stuff counts.

17:17.840 --> 17:21.400
I want a gaming Oscars, something that's not a joke.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.400
Oh well.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.920
Forget it.

17:23.920 --> 17:26.080
The Howard and Nestor Awards.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.080
No.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.360
The Howard and Nestor Awards.

17:29.360 --> 17:30.880
That would actually be pretty awesome.

17:30.880 --> 17:33.840
Winners will be announced, of course, on October 23rd.

17:33.840 --> 17:38.480
Well, Xbox 360 games seem to be moving over to the Nintendo DS.

17:38.480 --> 17:43.000
Heck, Viva Pinata, as you know, was announced to have an incubation coming out on the Nintendo

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
DS.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Guess what?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.360
Blue Dragon is also on its way to the Nintendo DS.

17:47.360 --> 17:50.400
Now, normally you'd kind of go, well, that doesn't seem like too big a surprise.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.800
I mean, it kind of seems like the kind of game that could have been on the DS.

17:52.800 --> 17:58.040
But when you consider that, you know, Mistwalker made it for Microsoft, it is kind of interesting

17:58.040 --> 18:02.240
that the game is going to have an incubation on the DS.

18:02.240 --> 18:06.360
This was coming from a recent issue of the manga Shonen Jump.

18:06.360 --> 18:07.360
It's funny.

18:07.360 --> 18:11.480
This is my Microsoft rep about Viva Pinata and who was publishing it.

18:11.480 --> 18:13.480
He got on a plane and left.

18:13.480 --> 18:14.480
Interesting.

18:14.480 --> 18:16.280
He didn't have the answer for me.

18:16.280 --> 18:17.280
Huh.

18:17.280 --> 18:20.080
And then he got on a plane and left.

18:20.080 --> 18:21.080
That was your answer.

18:21.080 --> 18:22.080
I guess so.

18:22.080 --> 18:23.080
The answer was...

18:23.080 --> 18:24.080
He's like, look over there.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.080
The answer was, what's that?

18:25.080 --> 18:26.080
The answer was...

18:26.080 --> 18:27.080
Run away.

18:27.080 --> 18:28.080
Okay, thanks.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.080
Bye.

18:29.080 --> 18:30.080
For real.

18:30.080 --> 18:31.080
I know.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.080
Really.

18:32.080 --> 18:42.080
There is a little speculation regarding Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass, and it was confirmed

18:42.080 --> 18:51.120
that the producer, Eiji Aonuma, basically did agree that the game was a remake of the

18:51.120 --> 18:54.000
very first Zelda game.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.600
Or it must have started off that way, but it certainly hopefully hasn't ended up that

18:57.600 --> 18:58.920
way, because I don't want to pony up that kind of money.

18:58.920 --> 19:03.280
The game's already out, and I know people who play it who didn't say that it was just

19:03.280 --> 19:04.280
like it.

19:04.280 --> 19:05.280
But it was supposed to be...

19:05.280 --> 19:06.280
What the crap?

19:06.280 --> 19:07.280
Phantom Hourglass came out?

19:07.280 --> 19:08.280
In Japan.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.280
Oh, okay.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.280
I had...

19:10.280 --> 19:11.280
Remember, my friends have a...

19:11.280 --> 19:12.280
Right, right, right.

19:12.280 --> 19:13.280
Ninja Pass.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.280
Sorry.

19:14.280 --> 19:15.280
I was like, wait, wait, wait.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.280
It came out over here?

19:16.280 --> 19:17.280
I missed that.

19:17.280 --> 19:23.520
But at any rate, it's saying that in his attempt to return to the root series, he unintentionally

19:23.520 --> 19:24.840
remade the game.

19:24.840 --> 19:28.840
So it's not really a complete remake.

19:28.840 --> 19:29.840
It's more of like a...

19:29.840 --> 19:30.840
An homage.

19:30.840 --> 19:31.840
A spiritual remake.

19:31.840 --> 19:36.960
When I hear that, though, I go, well, if it's an original, I don't know if I want it.

19:36.960 --> 19:37.960
Well, I'm going to get it.

19:37.960 --> 19:38.960
No, I know.

19:38.960 --> 19:39.960
I'm going to get it, too.

19:39.960 --> 19:43.840
Heck, even if it was a remake of the first game, I'd probably get it, because I'm a consumer

19:43.840 --> 19:44.840
whore.

19:44.840 --> 19:45.840
And how.

19:45.840 --> 19:46.840
Exactly.

19:46.840 --> 19:54.360
Anyways, so funny that you mention remakes, because the sex pixels are actually coming

19:54.360 --> 19:58.680
together to re-record Anarchy in the UK.

19:58.680 --> 20:01.560
And of course, this is going to be for Guitar Hero 3.

20:01.560 --> 20:03.080
Why should you care?

20:03.080 --> 20:06.580
Because it's a pretty cool song.

20:06.580 --> 20:07.960
But yeah, they've come back together.

20:07.960 --> 20:10.080
And it's the sex pistols getting back together.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.400
That's kind of cool.

20:11.400 --> 20:12.400
Exactly.

20:12.400 --> 20:17.680
And so apparently they're going to be reissuing Anarchy in the UK, as well as part of the

20:17.680 --> 20:20.020
celebration, they're going to be...

20:20.020 --> 20:23.520
Our Guitar Hero 3 is going to be sponsoring the band's performance at the London Brixton

20:23.520 --> 20:26.600
Academy on November 8th.

20:26.600 --> 20:27.960
All in thanks to a video game.

20:27.960 --> 20:32.200
Well, they're re-releasing, it's kind of co-advertising here.

20:32.200 --> 20:38.600
It's basically, they're re-releasing their album, Nevermind the Bollocks.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.480
Here's the Sex Pistols.

20:40.480 --> 20:45.800
And that's coming out on the 29th, which is actually the day after Guitar Hero comes out

20:45.800 --> 20:46.800
over here.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.800
I don't know.

20:48.800 --> 20:55.520
I don't know why they decided to re-record it, probably because it's good press.

20:55.520 --> 20:59.040
Going to our chatroom, chat.orangetonsready.com, Dark Tetsuya asked, wasn't that in Guitar

20:59.040 --> 21:00.040
Freaks at one point?

21:00.040 --> 21:03.800
Yes it was, but it was a shitty cover of it was in the game.

21:03.800 --> 21:06.760
But the real deal Sex Pistols are getting back together.

21:06.760 --> 21:10.160
And you know, Anarchy in the UK is one of those songs that's just like fun to kick ass

21:10.160 --> 21:11.160
to.

21:11.160 --> 21:12.520
You know, it's a pretty ass kicking song.

21:12.520 --> 21:24.440
When we think about kicking some ass, it inspires us to do the FUs of the Week.

21:24.440 --> 21:28.360
Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off with tonight's FUs of the Week.

21:28.360 --> 21:39.720
My FU of the Week goes towards, yeah, it's actually going to go to work, just in general.

21:39.720 --> 21:44.500
I actually went and got my business license on Wednesday so that I can hopefully quit

21:44.500 --> 21:48.400
my job and get to working at a spa, that'd be so nice.

21:48.400 --> 21:54.680
And so it really, really just sort of made me realize how much more futile what I do

21:54.680 --> 21:55.680
is.

21:55.680 --> 21:56.680
So, FU to work.

21:56.680 --> 21:57.680
Loki.

21:57.680 --> 22:05.240
I'm FU'd the Bad Drivers, I was commuting back from Oakland today, and there are just

22:05.240 --> 22:11.720
some people out there that don't really follow any of the laws of the road, in fact just

22:11.720 --> 22:12.720
weave in and out.

22:12.720 --> 22:17.320
I watched a truck almost flip itself because it turned so tight, you know, trying to go

22:17.320 --> 22:22.960
between cars and stuff like that, so you know, there's just some people and there's a guy

22:22.960 --> 22:28.720
with some riced up car or something that just decided, oh I'm going to just cut through

22:28.720 --> 22:36.280
cars and stuff, no signal, no nothing, just trying to kill people, so fuck them.

22:36.280 --> 22:43.040
I'm going to give an FU, sorry, one more thing, FU to the California Highway Patrol for stopping

22:43.040 --> 22:45.800
the freeway, you morons!

22:45.800 --> 22:50.120
So you know, they do all these things to stop people from speeding, so one of those things

22:50.120 --> 22:56.360
apparently is to stop traffic on the freeway completely, all lanes at one time, because

22:56.360 --> 22:58.280
that solves the problem.

22:58.280 --> 23:02.820
No it doesn't, it causes more traffic, people become late and they speed more, you stupid

23:02.820 --> 23:03.820
dumb fucks.

23:03.820 --> 23:04.820
That's it.

23:04.820 --> 23:08.640
That does seem like a little silly idea, unless there's an axe in the head or something.

23:08.640 --> 23:09.640
No, they just.

23:09.640 --> 23:10.640
For no reason?

23:10.640 --> 23:11.640
No reason.

23:11.640 --> 23:12.640
Just have fun.

23:12.640 --> 23:15.640
We're bored today, let's screw with traffic.

23:15.640 --> 23:23.240
My FU of the week goes to my ass, hear me out here for a minute, because I was a little

23:23.240 --> 23:29.080
bit intoxicated, and I slipped and I fell on this chest that's in my room, this little

23:29.080 --> 23:32.920
green, not a treasure chest, but a chest for clothes and stuff, I slipped and I fell right

23:32.920 --> 23:38.600
on the corner of that, so my butt hit that corner, and now it's red and practically bruised.

23:38.600 --> 23:39.600
I saw Rob's butt.

23:39.600 --> 23:43.280
Yeah, I showed it to Jamie earlier, but only because I'm gay and she's a married woman,

23:43.280 --> 23:44.280
so it's okay.

23:44.280 --> 23:45.720
I gave Rob drugs.

23:45.720 --> 23:50.840
Yeah, and she evaluated it and gave me some ibuprofen that was very strong.

23:50.840 --> 23:51.840
Do you feel better?

23:51.840 --> 23:52.840
I do, actually.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.840
I don't feel it at all.

23:54.840 --> 23:56.560
It's nice.

23:56.560 --> 24:00.960
That's it for the FUs of the week, hooray.

24:00.960 --> 24:06.040
Let's go back to some gaming news, and this is almost FU of the week worthy.

24:06.040 --> 24:13.480
I found this on Digg, there's a site, EbizMBA, that tracks the top 25 gaming sites on the

24:13.480 --> 24:16.360
internet, and Orange Launch Radio is nowhere to be found.

24:16.360 --> 24:17.960
Well, of course.

24:17.960 --> 24:18.960
That's just bullshit.

24:18.960 --> 24:23.360
Okay, when was the last time we actually had news on our website?

24:23.360 --> 24:25.960
Which by the way, oh, actually it was about that interview, we were supposed to have an

24:25.960 --> 24:31.280
interview tonight, DMN did the interview, it was with a gal from Nintendo who got fired

24:31.280 --> 24:35.760
over her blog, DMN actually interviewed her for their own show, STFU, which is on Thursdays

24:35.760 --> 24:39.200
on the station, we were going to rebroadcast it because it's kind of an in the news current

24:39.200 --> 24:41.160
thing that we thought you guys would be interested in.

24:41.160 --> 24:46.520
Apparently their connection sucked, and the audio quality wasn't worth it to try and bring

24:46.520 --> 24:47.520
it to you guys.

24:47.520 --> 24:50.560
So we made an editorial decision to cut it out.

24:50.560 --> 24:52.240
What about the guy that proposed over...

24:52.240 --> 24:55.760
I didn't hear a fact from him on Myspace, I don't know, maybe he's listening.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.640
We'll still have him on the show, call in.

24:57.640 --> 25:00.520
Maybe if he's listening right now, we're going to have the Skype line later on the show,

25:00.520 --> 25:02.480
we'll get to that, or anybody who wants to call in.

25:02.480 --> 25:06.600
I think some of our New Yorkers that went to Digital Life are dying to get through tonight,

25:06.600 --> 25:10.360
so we're going to hear from them a little later, but the 25 most popular video game

25:10.360 --> 25:11.360
sites.

25:11.360 --> 25:16.440
The number one video game site, according to this roster, which judges the top 25 by

25:16.440 --> 25:21.960
the number of inbound links, the number of monthly visitors, the Quantcast monthly visitors,

25:21.960 --> 25:25.800
I don't even know what that is, and the Alexa ranking, which by the way I think is bullshit.

25:25.800 --> 25:29.480
I think you should not use, oh god, I fucking hate Alexa.

25:29.480 --> 25:32.080
It's like one of the biggest plagues on the internet.

25:32.080 --> 25:34.360
Who owns it, like Amazon or some shit?

25:34.360 --> 25:38.520
All it is is a spyware bar that you basically have to install on your computer and it tracks

25:38.520 --> 25:40.080
what websites you visit.

25:40.080 --> 25:46.120
And they have the balls to release this ranking of the top sites based on who has this Alexa

25:46.120 --> 25:49.120
toolbar installed.

25:49.120 --> 25:55.040
That's not, because if you are anti-spyware, anti-toolbar, all this stuff, you probably

25:55.040 --> 25:59.160
visit different sites than people who get suckered to putting this stuff on their computer.

25:59.160 --> 26:03.280
Anyway, I could just go off all day, because one of the things I hate about Wikipedia is

26:03.280 --> 26:09.440
that they use the Alexa ranking as some of their, as a site worthy to be on our page,

26:09.440 --> 26:13.600
which how we've managed to keep our article up on Wikipedia for so long, I'll never be

26:13.600 --> 26:16.200
able to figure that out.

26:16.200 --> 26:20.960
But thank you all to the listeners who made that, but anyway, sorry, I get off my soapbox

26:20.960 --> 26:21.960
there.

26:21.960 --> 26:26.400
Top 25 sites, number one video game site, IGN.com, followed by GameSpot.com at number

26:26.400 --> 26:32.280
two, GameFacts.com at number three, GamesRadar.com at number four, which kind of surprised me,

26:32.280 --> 26:39.200
I'd never really heard of it until a few months ago, UGO.com at number five, GameSpy, CheatCC,

26:39.200 --> 26:45.000
Kotaku, Yahoo Video Games, and GameTap rounding out the top 10.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.920
File Front is a gaming site.

26:46.920 --> 26:49.400
Apparently File Front is a gaming site, number 11.

26:49.400 --> 26:50.960
File Planet?

26:50.960 --> 26:57.200
Yeah, so some other big blogs, OneUp, who does a bunch of podcasts, they're number 13

26:57.200 --> 27:04.760
on the list, Destructoid is number 20, Joystiq is number 19, and that's all I care to mention.

27:04.760 --> 27:06.960
We're getting beat out by Strategy Informer.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.840
Well, you know, life sucks sometimes.

27:09.840 --> 27:11.600
Yeah, we don't have the budget.

27:11.600 --> 27:16.240
I bet you all these people, none of these are, of course, independent sites, well maybe

27:16.240 --> 27:19.640
Kotaku, I guess, and Joystiq, and Destructoid.

27:19.640 --> 27:24.760
Well, yeah, I don't want to get into the politics of it all, yeah.

27:24.760 --> 27:25.760
Yeah.

27:25.760 --> 27:26.760
Anywho.

27:26.760 --> 27:29.520
Yeah, some of the chat is asking, where's AllGames?

27:29.520 --> 27:32.360
Nope, AllGames didn't make the top 25 either.

27:32.360 --> 27:35.280
But AllGames doesn't really do news, you know, AllGames only shows.

27:35.280 --> 27:38.240
I think if there were more to it, there might be more people going there.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.320
Maybe someday.

27:40.320 --> 27:47.240
I trust that we're at the top of our favorite sites.

27:47.240 --> 27:48.240
And that's all I really care about.

27:48.240 --> 27:49.800
That's all right, we're just underground, yo.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.160
We're just underground.

27:51.160 --> 27:54.800
We're way under the radar.

27:54.800 --> 27:58.600
We're like underground at a bomb shelter.

27:58.600 --> 27:59.600
That's right.

27:59.600 --> 28:00.600
I'm not in a bomb shelter.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.880
I'm in the land of awesome.

28:02.880 --> 28:08.400
Anyway, speaking of something that could be awesome, but I sincerely doubt it, is that

28:08.400 --> 28:14.440
there is a rumor about a Mortal Kombat game that will feature characters from the DC universe

28:14.440 --> 28:18.720
trying to do a versus type of thing.

28:18.720 --> 28:21.880
But yeah, I don't know how I feel about that.

28:21.880 --> 28:24.800
In fact, I feel that it's going to be kind of dumb.

28:24.800 --> 28:25.800
What is that?

28:25.800 --> 28:29.120
A ramp I see there and a tank with sharks.

28:29.120 --> 28:30.760
What's going to happen soon?

28:30.760 --> 28:31.760
I wonder.

28:31.760 --> 28:40.320
If they were going to do something awesome like Marvel vs. Capcom vs. DC Play-A-Rama.

28:40.320 --> 28:42.200
Isn't that kind of what this is?

28:42.200 --> 28:45.280
It's the answer to Marvel vs. Capcom, which is Street Fighter.

28:45.280 --> 28:49.320
So instead of Marvel vs. Street Fighter, now you have DC vs. Mortal Kombat.

28:49.320 --> 28:51.360
This makes perfect sense to me.

28:51.360 --> 28:54.000
In fact, this reeks the fanboyism to me.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
I don't even think it's true.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.600
The difference between Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter is that Street Fighter is a good game.

28:58.600 --> 29:02.960
First off, the next game that they're going to do is going to be a versus game.

29:02.960 --> 29:06.520
They never said it was versus DC.

29:06.520 --> 29:07.520
Although that would make sense.

29:07.520 --> 29:11.080
To be honest, I think the Mortal Kombat series, DC, I don't think would go for it if you think

29:11.080 --> 29:12.080
about it.

29:12.080 --> 29:16.960
I mean, granted, I think DC vs. Street Fighter makes sense because it's more like comic book-y

29:16.960 --> 29:17.960
and stuff.

29:17.960 --> 29:21.200
But, Mortal Kombat is just kind of violent.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.200
Well maybe they're going to change Mortal Kombat's adventure.

29:23.200 --> 29:31.080
Mortal Kombat vs. Monsters of Horror or something like that, where they have Freddy and Jason

29:31.080 --> 29:32.080
and shit like that.

29:32.080 --> 29:35.280
You know why I like the Mortal Kombat games, especially the more recent one?

29:35.280 --> 29:38.720
I like them because they have more than just the fighting game stuff in them.

29:38.720 --> 29:42.560
Like the kart thing, the adventure modes.

29:42.560 --> 29:44.120
The games have quite a bit of depth.

29:44.120 --> 29:45.120
I don't know.

29:45.120 --> 29:47.320
I mean, they're not like OMG drop everything.

29:47.320 --> 29:49.280
They're no Soul Calibur 2, that's for sure.

29:49.280 --> 29:50.280
But they're fun.

29:50.280 --> 29:51.280
I don't know.

29:51.280 --> 29:54.400
I think you guys are beating too hard on Mortal Kombat.

29:54.400 --> 29:55.400
It's fun.

29:55.400 --> 29:57.720
You guys are just tough to please.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.520
I am tough to please.

29:59.520 --> 30:04.040
Anyways, one game though that I do like is Saints Row.

30:04.040 --> 30:07.960
And Saints Row 2 has been confirmed for PlayStation 3 and the 360.

30:07.960 --> 30:12.160
Some of the changes coming with the brand new version of the game, of course it's going

30:12.160 --> 30:19.960
to bring back Stillwater as well as including some improvements to the online game.

30:19.960 --> 30:27.760
Both the online co-op now being added and multiplayer open world multiplayer matches.

30:27.760 --> 30:28.760
That's kind of cool.

30:28.760 --> 30:33.840
I mean, don't get me wrong, the multiplayer is okay, but I kind of wish that it was open

30:33.840 --> 30:39.440
world like Grand Theft Auto on the PSP and stuff like that.

30:39.440 --> 30:47.400
After a while, those three maps that you have for death match really get old.

30:47.400 --> 30:48.400
It should be good.

30:48.400 --> 30:54.240
You know what though, they set the bar pretty high for Grand Theft Auto so it would be kind

30:54.240 --> 31:00.200
of cool to see them look at what Grand Theft Auto 4 did well and then improve on that.

31:00.200 --> 31:01.200
Competition is always good.

31:01.200 --> 31:02.200
It makes for better games.

31:02.200 --> 31:06.920
Alright, well you could say one thing that's competing with DDR, although not really, is

31:06.920 --> 31:09.000
Dance Online.

31:09.000 --> 31:14.360
Dance Online is that dancing MMO that was created by David Perry who also made Earthworm

31:14.360 --> 31:18.920
Jim and I think I played it a long time ago and I wasn't that impressed with it.

31:18.920 --> 31:22.180
It didn't have a lot of songs that really grabbed me, but now I've got to go back and

31:22.180 --> 31:26.840
take a look because Dance Online has gotten some updates and they have apparently made

31:26.840 --> 31:31.200
some type of agreement with Warner Brothers Records or Warner Music.

31:31.200 --> 31:37.180
There are now songs from Ashley Tisdale, The Ramones, The Click Five, 30 songs from Warner

31:37.180 --> 31:41.000
Music also in the game now, Paris Hilton.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
You know you want to...

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
What?

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
No, I don't.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Oh, no.

31:45.000 --> 31:50.200
No, you want to also add more items to the shop for more customization.

31:50.200 --> 31:56.780
Over 150 hairstyles and apparently the game has also added fresh dance mode to give fresh

31:56.780 --> 32:01.680
dance modes giving some new challenges to the dancers in the game.

32:01.680 --> 32:05.880
There's a new superstar mode where you try to rack up combos and break dance and then

32:05.880 --> 32:07.320
reverse notes.

32:07.320 --> 32:11.760
You have to hit the opposite keyboard or dance pad arrows that you normally would.

32:11.760 --> 32:14.240
A little silly.

32:14.240 --> 32:15.240
Yawn.

32:15.240 --> 32:16.240
I don't know.

32:16.240 --> 32:17.240
I'll check it out.

32:17.240 --> 32:18.240
I'll check it out.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.000
I think with some good music it could be fun.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
I don't know.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Some folks in chat...

32:22.000 --> 32:24.240
Dark Tetsuya says, Pass.

32:24.240 --> 32:27.040
Mr. DeBucket says, David Perry for the lose.

32:27.040 --> 32:28.040
Ouch.

32:28.040 --> 32:31.440
Shadow Charlie says, Play Supernova 2 for Ashley Tisdale.

32:31.440 --> 32:34.360
You know a sad time or a sad sign that things are changing.

32:34.360 --> 32:37.880
You know how like our show started off like, you know, because we met all playing DDR.

32:37.880 --> 32:39.440
We were all about the DDR.

32:39.440 --> 32:43.720
Did you notice that not one but two new DDR games this week or DDR games came out this

32:43.720 --> 32:47.240
week and did either of us bother to report on them at the top of the show in our gaming

32:47.240 --> 32:48.240
weeks?

32:48.240 --> 32:49.240
No.

32:49.240 --> 32:50.240
We talked about it last week.

32:50.240 --> 32:51.240
Yeah, but did you play them?

32:51.240 --> 32:52.240
No, I didn't.

32:52.240 --> 32:53.240
I'm just like, did you play them?

32:53.240 --> 32:54.240
I'm waiting for my free coffees.

32:54.240 --> 32:55.240
I mean, come on.

32:55.240 --> 32:56.240
Oh, never mind.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.240
Sorry.

32:57.240 --> 32:58.240
A lot's changed in five years.

32:58.240 --> 33:05.200
I mean, I just don't want to buy, well first off I'm not buying DDR Haas Party unless I

33:05.200 --> 33:07.800
get it, you know, for free.

33:07.800 --> 33:10.680
And then Supernova 2, I listened to the music.

33:10.680 --> 33:13.240
I was disappointed with the Trip Machine remix.

33:13.240 --> 33:17.440
It was crap, so.

33:17.440 --> 33:22.360
And then, Ashley, is that your official review?

33:22.360 --> 33:24.800
I did like the Fascination Max remix though.

33:24.800 --> 33:28.880
That reminded me a lot of like Healing Vision and then Healing Vision Angelic, that kind

33:28.880 --> 33:31.600
of remix of it.

33:31.600 --> 33:37.920
And then, some of the songs though they didn't have ripped from it though, like Volcano I

33:37.920 --> 33:40.600
didn't get to hear, but some of the other ones were okay.

33:40.600 --> 33:43.800
I think though, I'll have to try it.

33:43.800 --> 33:47.480
I want an actual machine to be out here though instead of having to play it on the Playstation

33:47.480 --> 33:48.880
2.

33:48.880 --> 33:51.000
But hopefully I'll get to play it soon.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.640
Alright, well one thing we're going to get to do very soon is open up the mailbag.

33:54.640 --> 33:59.320
That's right, you guys email us every week at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and we

33:59.320 --> 34:01.640
read some of our favorites here on the program.

34:01.640 --> 34:09.360
So DarkSakura, jump in the mailbag, pull out some letters, let's see what we got.

34:09.360 --> 34:17.200
First email, dun dun dun, comes from, well, you didn't give a nickname so I'm just going

34:17.200 --> 34:18.200
to say Erin.

34:18.200 --> 34:20.200
Hi, first of all, I want to say I love the show.

34:20.200 --> 34:23.320
It's the only podcast I listen to that doesn't ever bore me.

34:23.320 --> 34:25.400
It's funny, entertaining, and informative.

34:25.400 --> 34:28.480
As for Rob's comments about Facebook, I totally agree.

34:28.480 --> 34:34.520
It's so annoying to log in and have like five invitations for apps that you don't care about.

34:34.520 --> 34:37.760
I don't think that it's as bad as MySpace, but I do think Facebook is headed in that

34:37.760 --> 34:38.760
direction.

34:38.760 --> 34:41.600
I got a Facebook too and I hate it.

34:41.600 --> 34:47.960
I mean, I do kind of like getting the notifications on my phone sometimes, but that shit gets

34:47.960 --> 34:48.960
old.

34:48.960 --> 34:53.120
Anyway, to continue, I also have a few comments on Halo 3.

34:53.120 --> 34:55.680
I love the first game, it's the reason I bought an Xbox.

34:55.680 --> 34:59.160
I was disappointed in Halo 2 and not long after Halo 2, I stopped telling people that

34:59.160 --> 35:08.080
I played it because I didn't want them to think I was a stupid frat boy.

35:08.080 --> 35:11.280
I eventually stopped playing Halo 2 with anyone I didn't know because of the ignorant people

35:11.280 --> 35:12.880
on Xbox Live.

35:12.880 --> 35:16.960
I'm excited for Halo 3, but I won't be going to the midnight release because of the people

35:16.960 --> 35:18.640
that will be there.

35:18.640 --> 35:23.760
I think the Halo series started out well and the games are still solid, but the atmosphere

35:23.760 --> 35:28.080
surrounding the games has dissolved into one blatant commercialism and poor sportsmanship,

35:28.080 --> 35:29.080
for lack of a better word.

35:29.080 --> 35:30.080
Love this show, guys.

35:30.080 --> 35:31.080
Keep it up.

35:31.080 --> 35:32.080
Aaron?

35:32.080 --> 35:36.240
Yeah, I seem to remember we were talking about last week, you know, who's actually going

35:36.240 --> 35:38.000
to the midnight release.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.880
Do we hear from anyone who actually went?

35:39.880 --> 35:44.360
This guy said he wanted to go, but all right.

35:44.360 --> 35:48.720
Shall I move forward to the next one, Rob?

35:48.720 --> 35:49.720
You may.

35:49.720 --> 35:56.000
Hello, dudes and chicks, I'm playing Worms 2 Up in Warfare on my PSP 2000, and I'm naming

35:56.000 --> 35:57.720
the worms on my custom team.

35:57.720 --> 36:02.440
I tried to name one of my worms Star Drifter, but when the worm shows up in the game, his

36:02.440 --> 36:07.000
name appears as S-X-X-X-X-Ifter.

36:07.000 --> 36:12.400
No matter how many times I try to rename him or a new team with the worm Star Drifter,

36:12.400 --> 36:16.480
it automatically changes to S-X-X-X-X-Ifter.

36:16.480 --> 36:17.640
Any idea why this is?

36:17.640 --> 36:20.160
Yeah, because T-A-R-D is T.A.R.D.

36:20.160 --> 36:24.040
Yeah, T.A.R.D. is slang for retard, which is a naughty word.

36:24.040 --> 36:28.880
They also censored death because I had a team death something.

36:28.880 --> 36:30.120
Can you play this online?

36:30.120 --> 36:31.120
No.

36:31.120 --> 36:32.120
You play Wi-Fi.

36:32.120 --> 36:35.360
Well, then why bother censoring it?

36:35.360 --> 36:37.840
The person's got to be in the room with you.

36:37.840 --> 36:39.040
I don't get it.

36:39.040 --> 36:40.040
That's overdoing it.

36:40.040 --> 36:41.040
That's from Darkraven.

36:41.040 --> 36:42.040
That's overdoing it.

36:42.040 --> 36:46.240
No, it's being censored because I guess T.A.R.D. is a bad word, and so anything with that

36:46.240 --> 36:48.260
in it, you know.

36:48.260 --> 36:51.160
What if you wanted to name your character Compass?

36:51.160 --> 36:54.440
Compass has the word ass in it, so you know, you can't do that.

36:54.440 --> 36:55.440
It's messed up.

36:55.440 --> 36:59.640
It would be comp, compa, and maybe com is a bad word too.

36:59.640 --> 37:00.640
Who knows?

37:00.640 --> 37:01.640
Calm.

37:01.640 --> 37:02.640
It depends on how it's spelled.

37:02.640 --> 37:03.640
Calm.

37:03.640 --> 37:04.640
Anyway, this one comes from A.Z.H.P.

37:04.640 --> 37:05.640
Hey, O.L.R.

37:05.640 --> 37:06.640
Crew.

37:06.640 --> 37:11.140
Last week on your show you discussed Loki's bet that he would dress up as Tingle while

37:11.140 --> 37:15.260
burning the Eye of Judgment, and since it comes out on October 23rd, six months from

37:15.260 --> 37:19.120
then, that would be April 23rd, which is my birthday.

37:19.120 --> 37:23.560
I just wanted to say how great a birthday present it would be if it ended up happening.

37:23.560 --> 37:25.840
Looking forward to the Eye of Judgment hitting the one million mark.

37:25.840 --> 37:29.240
Unfortunately, I won't be contributing to that one million because I don't have a PS3

37:29.240 --> 37:30.240
in it.

37:30.240 --> 37:31.240
Oh yeah, the Eye of Judgment is crap.

37:31.240 --> 37:36.840
Oh yeah, since you guys love lolcat so much, here's the Geometry Wars galaxy ad for the

37:36.840 --> 37:37.840
Wii.

37:37.840 --> 37:47.440
Yeah, but that was actually linked from the GW Cats thing that you gave me that was going

37:47.440 --> 37:49.440
to be my side of the week.

37:49.440 --> 37:55.880
Well, let's take a minute to talk about Galaxy Wars Cats.

37:55.880 --> 37:58.840
Genius marketing campaign, those folks at Geometry Wars Galaxy.

37:58.840 --> 38:02.520
Have you seen the site gwgcats.com?

38:02.520 --> 38:07.380
Somebody's taken the lolcats trend and made an advertising campaign out of it.

38:07.380 --> 38:11.920
I think the advertising campaign for Geometry Wars Galaxies is brilliant because you can

38:11.920 --> 38:12.920
even watch the commercial.

38:12.920 --> 38:13.920
Wait, hold on.

38:13.920 --> 38:14.920
I'm going to go to the site.

38:14.920 --> 38:15.920
I'm sorry.

38:15.920 --> 38:17.760
I don't care if I sound like a consumer whore, but you know what?

38:17.760 --> 38:22.800
I've seen so many lame video game commercials, and you might think this is lame, but I don't

38:22.800 --> 38:23.800
care.

38:23.800 --> 38:24.800
I think it's funny.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.280
They have this in theaters.

38:26.280 --> 38:27.280
This is so great.

38:27.280 --> 38:31.160
There's Geometry Wars and they have all these things like, I'm in your solar system on top

38:31.160 --> 38:35.720
of your leaderboards, I'm in your battle grids, topping your highest score, and just all this

38:35.720 --> 38:36.720
funny stuff.

38:36.720 --> 38:41.280
And then if you actually go to the website for Geometry Wars Galaxies, the little trailer

38:41.280 --> 38:45.920
for the game has a remake of Particle Man, which is so awesome.

38:45.920 --> 38:46.920
Hold on.

38:46.920 --> 38:49.760
I got to play a little clip of the song from the trailer.

38:49.760 --> 38:52.520
This is from Geometry Wars Galaxies dot com slash us.

38:52.520 --> 38:56.720
Particle Man, Particle Man, doing the things of Particle Man.

38:56.720 --> 38:57.720
What's he like?

38:57.720 --> 38:58.720
It's not important.

38:58.720 --> 38:59.720
Particle Man, is he a dot?

38:59.720 --> 39:00.720
Or is he his back?

39:00.720 --> 39:01.720
When he's in the water, does he get wet?

39:01.720 --> 39:08.360
Or does the water get him instead?

39:08.360 --> 39:09.360
Because get it?

39:09.360 --> 39:13.240
Because it's like Triangle Man and, I don't know, it's funny.

39:13.240 --> 39:14.240
That's great.

39:14.240 --> 39:15.240
Is that They Might Be Giants?

39:15.240 --> 39:16.240
No.

39:16.240 --> 39:18.640
It's like, oh, unless they redid the song, it's definitely not the original.

39:18.640 --> 39:21.680
Well, I mean, I was going to say, because the voice was kind of...

39:21.680 --> 39:22.680
A little bit.

39:22.680 --> 39:23.680
Could have been.

39:23.680 --> 39:24.680
Yeah.

39:24.680 --> 39:25.680
Great.

39:25.680 --> 39:26.680
Love it.

39:26.680 --> 39:29.520
Well, then the next email then, if you are ready.

39:29.520 --> 39:34.880
Actually, real quickly, I just want to say, Black Wolf, of course, our old buddy Bobby

39:34.880 --> 39:38.360
B's in chat right now, and he does his own show, of course, on All Games.

39:38.360 --> 39:42.040
It also airs on Sunday nights, and sometimes when he's done with his show, he'll come listen

39:42.040 --> 39:46.480
to ours for a little bit, because he's awesome, and he says, oh, man, that email was a mass

39:46.480 --> 39:47.680
email to a lot of podcasts.

39:47.680 --> 39:51.740
I think he said that about the last email, the one about the Worms 2.

39:51.740 --> 39:55.360
So somebody is like mass emailing podcasts with the same question.

39:55.360 --> 39:56.540
Amazing.

39:56.540 --> 39:57.540
We got spammed.

39:57.540 --> 40:02.000
I wonder if they're trying to see if the different podcasts give different answers of some type

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
of survey.

40:03.000 --> 40:07.400
Well, then, I wonder if they're spamming all the podcasts about whether their penis needs

40:07.400 --> 40:09.920
to be larger, too, because...

40:09.920 --> 40:14.320
Or maybe they're trying to spam all the podcasts with a Worms 2 email, so people will actually

40:14.320 --> 40:15.800
talk about Worms 2 on the podcast.

40:15.800 --> 40:17.040
There's apparently people who think that...

40:17.040 --> 40:18.040
We just bought it.

40:18.040 --> 40:19.040
Hook, line, and sinker.

40:19.040 --> 40:22.800
There's a bunch of people who think that I need a bigger penis, too, apparently, in my

40:22.800 --> 40:23.800
email.

40:23.800 --> 40:26.440
So we actually deleted my email address.

40:26.440 --> 40:28.320
So I don't think it'll work, but good luck.

40:28.320 --> 40:29.320
You never know.

40:29.320 --> 40:34.640
Well, if they get them back, then they have auto-delete things or some shit.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.800
I'm actually thinking about changing it anyway.

40:36.800 --> 40:37.800
Yeah.

40:37.800 --> 40:38.800
All right.

40:38.800 --> 40:40.800
But anyway, next email now, please, please, please, please.

40:40.800 --> 40:41.800
Yes, yes, yes.

40:41.800 --> 40:42.800
Can I has email, Rob?

40:42.800 --> 40:44.920
Yes, you can has email.

40:44.920 --> 40:48.560
Last episode, look, you said nothing is original anymore.

40:48.560 --> 40:49.560
Originality is hard to find.

40:49.560 --> 40:53.960
One of my favorite quotes is from one of my design teachers is, you are only as original

40:53.960 --> 40:56.400
as your sources are obscure.

40:56.400 --> 40:57.600
Ones are the same as design.

40:57.600 --> 41:00.080
I do agree with that.

41:00.080 --> 41:03.820
I was listening to episode nine of Game Theory about emotional responses to video games and

41:03.820 --> 41:08.520
how the design aspect can begin there to create a better game, and it reminded me of my own

41:08.520 --> 41:10.560
reactions to certain games or events in games.

41:10.560 --> 41:13.840
Like, the first time I played through Symphony of the Night, I beat Belmont at the end, and

41:13.840 --> 41:14.960
I thought, cool, whatever.

41:14.960 --> 41:17.080
I had no idea about the extra gameplay.

41:17.080 --> 41:20.640
I was bored a few weeks later, so I had to play through it again, but thoroughly this

41:20.640 --> 41:21.640
time.

41:21.640 --> 41:24.720
So when I defeated the green orb this time, the exact words out of my mouth was, what

41:24.720 --> 41:26.920
the crap?

41:26.920 --> 41:31.440
Talk about a reward for good gaming or the end for Final Fantasy II in the U.S.

41:31.440 --> 41:33.640
That's Final Fantasy IV overseas.

41:33.640 --> 41:35.760
The page turning with the great music, it was incredible.

41:35.760 --> 41:39.160
I sat and smiled contentedly for a good half an hour.

41:39.160 --> 41:44.120
I can actually say the same thing about Final Fantasy III over here when it came out, was

41:44.120 --> 41:48.880
that I actually finally decided to wait and be patient and wait for Shadow to catch up

41:48.880 --> 41:54.680
with you so that he doesn't die, spoiler, and got the ending with everybody alive.

41:54.680 --> 41:57.000
That made me happy.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.660
Even retarded GoGo.

41:58.660 --> 42:01.840
I was missing somebody when I first beat Final Fantasy III.

42:01.840 --> 42:02.840
It wasn't Shadow.

42:02.840 --> 42:04.880
I actually thought to wait around for Shadow.

42:04.880 --> 42:05.960
I got everybody.

42:05.960 --> 42:10.960
I want to say, I was missing, like somebody really, like Gao or somebody I was like really

42:10.960 --> 42:11.960
weird I was missing.

42:11.960 --> 42:14.720
Well no, you couldn't play through without Gao.

42:14.720 --> 42:16.140
Then who was I missing?

42:16.140 --> 42:19.560
Your extra characters were Umaru and GoGo.

42:19.560 --> 42:20.560
The stupid mimic?

42:20.560 --> 42:24.020
No, isn't there a way that you can actually get all the way to the very last tower with

42:24.020 --> 42:25.200
only three people?

42:25.200 --> 42:29.600
You have to have Celes, you have to have Edgar, and you have to have one other person.

42:29.600 --> 42:30.600
I think Locke.

42:30.600 --> 42:31.600
Terra.

42:31.600 --> 42:32.600
Is it?

42:32.600 --> 42:33.600
No, I think you can go and skip Terra.

42:33.600 --> 42:37.200
I mean, it makes no sense for the story, but remember how you could access the last tower

42:37.200 --> 42:38.200
really early on?

42:38.200 --> 42:42.220
Terra was like the first character you play in the game.

42:42.220 --> 42:48.320
But then after the game resets, when it goes into World of Ruin, you start as Celes, remember?

42:48.320 --> 42:49.320
That is true.

42:49.320 --> 42:51.320
So, it was weird.

42:51.320 --> 42:54.440
Well, at any rate, now I look for these things.

42:54.440 --> 42:57.680
I want to care about my characters on normal story-based games.

42:57.680 --> 42:58.960
It's not always easy to find.

42:58.960 --> 43:04.600
I get by these days with a good triple Winfury crit on any gnome anywhere, or seriously just

43:04.600 --> 43:09.000
killing anything alliance, but that kind of quick fix can't replace the more in-depth

43:09.000 --> 43:10.240
stuff.

43:10.240 --> 43:13.840
What are some of the moments that got you guys all teary eyed or made you jump like

43:13.840 --> 43:14.840
an idiot?

43:14.840 --> 43:18.520
Oh, and let's hear it for the gamers, spelled G-A-Y-M-E-R-S.

43:18.520 --> 43:20.440
Apparently Seattle is the gamer mecha.

43:20.440 --> 43:21.440
Really?

43:21.440 --> 43:23.040
And that comes from No Soul Boy.

43:23.040 --> 43:25.240
I knew there was a reason I liked Seattle.

43:25.240 --> 43:30.400
No, let's see, games that got me, well, okay, games that got me a jump would be Silent Hill,

43:30.400 --> 43:32.900
like any of them.

43:32.900 --> 43:38.520
Games that got me all teary- Well, I actually cared when Aris died in Final Fantasy VII

43:38.520 --> 43:39.520
on one of my co-hosts.

43:39.520 --> 43:40.520
I cheered.

43:40.520 --> 43:41.520
You're a bitch.

43:41.520 --> 43:42.520
I'm not a bitch.

43:42.520 --> 43:48.000
I hated her the entire fucking game, and oh my God, I hated her, and I was so happy when

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
she died.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
I was sad.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.240
Actually, I got verklempt when that happened.

43:52.240 --> 43:55.560
Actually, I got a little verklempt playing Eternal Sonata the other day.

43:55.560 --> 43:57.560
That game's sad.

43:57.560 --> 43:59.780
It's about all these dying kids and stuff.

43:59.780 --> 44:00.780
It's kind of sad.

44:00.780 --> 44:05.840
I laughed my ass off during the bitch slap fight in Final Fantasy VII between Scarlet

44:05.840 --> 44:13.440
and Tifa, and oh God, there was a game though that made me completely freaking ball, and

44:13.440 --> 44:18.160
I couldn't remember what it was because it was a few years ago.

44:18.160 --> 44:23.960
I do know one game that completely cracked me up, and that was- Now, crap, I can't remember

44:23.960 --> 44:31.280
the name of it, but it had the girl with the red pigtails, and she used the rings, the

44:31.280 --> 44:35.240
chakram for her weapons, and you could play as either the girl or the boy, and it had

44:35.240 --> 44:41.720
a really cool name in Japan, and then it came out with Winds of Fate in the US, but that

44:41.720 --> 44:47.440
game had lots of crack-me-up bunny moments because she was just over the top, but I can't

44:47.440 --> 44:50.720
remember the game that made me freaking ball like a baby though.

44:50.720 --> 44:54.400
It was like people dying in the game.

44:54.400 --> 44:55.400
Mario is missing.

44:55.400 --> 44:57.920
I just, I can't believe it's missing.

44:57.920 --> 45:02.920
I'll tell you what recently though- I can't believe it, please, I can't find him.

45:02.920 --> 45:09.840
I'll tell you what recently made me so annoyed was watching on YouTube, asshole Mario, just

45:09.840 --> 45:13.320
people go to YouTube and look up asshole Mario.

45:13.320 --> 45:16.240
That was awesome talent, I love asshole Mario.

45:16.240 --> 45:21.280
It's people who what they did is took Super Mario Brothers and did ROM hacks with it to

45:21.280 --> 45:25.660
make these intensely hard levels, and the thing about these hard levels is that they

45:25.660 --> 45:27.800
are not unplayable.

45:27.800 --> 45:34.940
You can beat them, but you have to have the mad skills to do it and time and patience

45:34.940 --> 45:36.280
and be willing to die.

45:36.280 --> 45:42.560
The only thing that's annoying about the asshole Mario levels is that they keep showing people

45:42.560 --> 45:47.480
dying over and over and over again, and what they should do is just show someone playing

45:47.480 --> 45:50.040
through the level and then show them dying.

45:50.040 --> 45:55.280
My favorite was how they showed one at just the very start of the game, and the very first

45:55.280 --> 45:59.840
level the guy goes into, he goes into the level and then there's a bullet machine that

45:59.840 --> 46:00.840
shoots him in the face.

46:00.840 --> 46:01.840
Right when the level starts.

46:01.840 --> 46:05.320
Or the womps that land directly on him.

46:05.320 --> 46:09.580
The very first level where it does the little happy music, it starts with a womp falling

46:09.580 --> 46:13.720
on him, and you have to find the secret hidden block.

46:13.720 --> 46:19.920
The best thing is, and I was actually discussing this with Sauce the other day, is that when

46:19.920 --> 46:24.240
they have the uber long jumps and the guy's timing it perfectly, and then he jumps and

46:24.240 --> 46:26.960
hits a brick and lands in the hole.

46:26.960 --> 46:28.760
It's like an invisible coin block.

46:28.760 --> 46:31.560
Anyway, back to the email, shall I?

46:31.560 --> 46:32.560
Yes.

46:32.560 --> 46:33.560
Okay.

46:33.560 --> 46:36.900
This is addressed to me, and then you guys in parentheses.

46:36.900 --> 46:38.360
This is Rob with two Bs, by the way.

46:38.360 --> 46:39.360
Who's it from?

46:39.360 --> 46:40.360
I just told you, Rob.

46:40.360 --> 46:42.840
Oh, hi, Rob and two Bs.

46:42.840 --> 46:49.440
There's a little war of words going on between a site called Game Twat, I think that's great,

46:49.440 --> 46:54.720
it just gets funnier each time you think slash say it, and game politics, as well as GP versus

46:54.720 --> 47:00.700
Jackie Poo, and it's being taken way too seriously by GP readers.

47:00.700 --> 47:06.000
In a GT post on a GP survey involving a Jackie Poo interview, what's more, you'd think by

47:06.000 --> 47:10.520
naming a site Game Twat would sort of imply people that it's not meant to be taken 100%

47:10.520 --> 47:13.260
seriously, but I guess that sort of skips people by.

47:13.260 --> 47:16.400
I've heard of Game Cock, but I've never heard of Game Twat.

47:16.400 --> 47:20.540
Game Cock is a publisher, or a developer.

47:20.540 --> 47:24.720
I think people need to lighten up and realize how we secretly enjoy the antics between Jackie

47:24.720 --> 47:26.520
Poo and GP butting heads.

47:26.520 --> 47:28.640
GT is funny if you let it.

47:28.640 --> 47:33.200
I personally believe that porn court filing's story on Jackie Poo was his attempt to show

47:33.200 --> 47:37.660
the judge was biased against him in the case versus the Florida Bar.

47:37.660 --> 47:40.820
Mission accomplished, but now the legal system is against him.

47:40.820 --> 47:45.200
Sorry for the misquote, but if you strike Jackie Poo down, he'll become stronger than

47:45.200 --> 47:46.200
ever.

47:46.200 --> 47:51.040
I'd rather we adopt a meh attitude and maybe he'll start eating crayons as recreational

47:51.040 --> 47:52.040
drugs.

47:52.040 --> 47:53.040
Rob Bubba.

47:53.040 --> 48:00.320
And he wrote Bubba afterwards.

48:00.320 --> 48:05.400
This Game Twat site looks like Perez Hilton.

48:05.400 --> 48:10.600
It's awfully pink, and that joystick looks like a cock.

48:10.600 --> 48:14.300
Black Wolf in chat says something interesting, he says, wow, Game Twat is getting really

48:14.300 --> 48:15.640
too much publicity over this.

48:15.640 --> 48:18.480
So what's the debate?

48:18.480 --> 48:20.000
What are they mad at each other about?

48:20.000 --> 48:24.640
I don't get it.

48:24.640 --> 48:27.640
Hold on, I'm trying to figure this out, because Game Twat interviewed him.

48:27.640 --> 48:30.800
I can't believe he would have interviewed with a site called Game Twat.

48:30.800 --> 48:32.720
What the hell?

48:32.720 --> 48:36.720
Hi, we're with Game Twat, we want to interview you.

48:36.720 --> 48:41.080
Whatever, I don't want to get involved in the drama.

48:41.080 --> 48:44.720
It's more publicity for both sites, I mean, we just reported on it, congratulations to

48:44.720 --> 48:45.900
both sites.

48:45.900 --> 48:48.000
We need to start a fight with somebody.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.160
Who can we start a fight with?

48:49.160 --> 48:50.160
How about all games?

48:50.160 --> 48:51.160
Ah, that's too obvious.

48:51.160 --> 48:52.160
How about Bobby?

48:52.160 --> 48:54.160
Bobby, we're going to start a fight with you, is that okay?

48:54.160 --> 48:55.160
That's too obvious.

48:55.160 --> 48:57.040
It's too obvious if we start a fight with somebody.

48:57.040 --> 48:59.280
I'll start a fight with you, you want to make some noise?

48:59.280 --> 49:03.480
What about the developer of The Eye of Judgment?

49:03.480 --> 49:04.480
I don't know.

49:04.480 --> 49:05.480
Who's the developer?

49:05.480 --> 49:06.480
Well, I don't know where we are.

49:06.480 --> 49:09.880
Chat, send us an email, let us know who we should get in a fight with.

49:09.880 --> 49:12.320
Yes, chat room, who should we start a fight with?

49:12.320 --> 49:14.920
We'll say something really nasty about some other show.

49:14.920 --> 49:15.920
PM Rob.

49:15.920 --> 49:16.920
Let us know who.

49:16.920 --> 49:17.920
PM Rob with your answers.

49:17.920 --> 49:18.920
Yes, please do.

49:18.920 --> 49:24.420
Okay, to report from the Afro guy, hey, OLR, I wanted to make a correction to that rather

49:24.420 --> 49:27.720
formal review of Earth Defense Forces sent in last week.

49:27.720 --> 49:31.520
There are more enemy types than just ants in the game, but it turns out they're the

49:31.520 --> 49:32.560
best.

49:32.560 --> 49:35.800
By the way, having played Metal Slug Anthology this week, I agree with Loki that every Metal

49:35.800 --> 49:38.960
Slug game is exactly the same, even if they are really fun.

49:38.960 --> 49:43.160
Enemies, weapons, and even goddamn mini-bosses are repeated.

49:43.160 --> 49:44.160
You know what?

49:44.160 --> 49:50.040
So you can get turned into undead in the later ones.

49:50.040 --> 49:54.240
To continue, last one, dun, dun, dun.

49:54.240 --> 49:58.600
Hi, OLR people, this is Mori again.

49:58.600 --> 50:02.280
Earlier this week, I was able to get a Wii with money from various sources, and so far

50:02.280 --> 50:04.120
I've been enjoying it immensely.

50:04.120 --> 50:07.960
My house has been lacking in a home version of DDR for quite some time, so I splurged

50:07.960 --> 50:13.000
and picked up the new DDR Hottest Party bundle that came out Tuesday, I think.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
Anywho.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.720
The game's, in a nutshell, excellent.

50:16.720 --> 50:19.240
It's easily the best DDR home version in a while.

50:19.240 --> 50:24.160
The song list is a tad shorter than the average game, by about 50 total, but most of the songs

50:24.160 --> 50:25.360
are actually fun to play.

50:25.360 --> 50:29.600
About half of it consists of licenses, they're all covers, but the range and quality from

50:29.600 --> 50:32.280
good to questionable.

50:32.280 --> 50:34.520
For some reason, the 80s ones tend to be the most fun.

50:34.520 --> 50:37.900
Blue Monday by New Order is the first one that comes to mind.

50:37.900 --> 50:40.760
The original songs in the game are pretty awesome, too.

50:40.760 --> 50:45.280
Furthermore, whoever did the step charts for this game needs to stay around forever.

50:45.280 --> 50:47.760
There's a wide range of difficulty.

50:47.760 --> 50:52.400
A couple of genuine ten-footers in the other charts are fun without being mind-numbingly

50:52.400 --> 50:53.400
boring.

50:53.400 --> 50:57.800
The Wii remote motions are kind of hard to get the hang of, though, and the game doesn't

50:57.800 --> 51:01.280
give you any advice besides swinging the controller.

51:01.280 --> 51:04.520
As far as I can tell, the best way to do it is to hold the remote and nunchuck in front

51:04.520 --> 51:06.480
of you vertically and swing them forward.

51:06.480 --> 51:09.840
Oh, and the new Love Shine remix is rad.

51:09.840 --> 51:11.400
Finally, a quick question.

51:11.400 --> 51:13.120
What other Wii games are good at the moment?

51:13.120 --> 51:14.120
I'm into quirky stuff.

51:14.120 --> 51:15.120
Cheers, Mori.

51:15.120 --> 51:18.640
Um, I still love Trauma Center.

51:18.640 --> 51:23.560
If you really want quirky, escape from Bug Island.

51:23.560 --> 51:24.560
That's really quirky.

51:24.560 --> 51:25.880
Quirky games?

51:25.880 --> 51:31.140
Dip into the retro archive and go play some old stuff, because seriously, some developers

51:31.140 --> 51:33.720
back in the day were smoking crack.

51:33.720 --> 51:36.720
Who would have thought that a game about a loom would be so awesome?

51:36.720 --> 51:37.720
Loom is awesome.

51:37.720 --> 51:38.720
I know.

51:38.720 --> 51:39.720
That's what I'm saying.

51:39.720 --> 51:40.820
Loom is fucking rad.

51:40.820 --> 51:41.940
Go back in the archive.

51:41.940 --> 51:42.940
Play some old-school stuff.

51:42.940 --> 51:43.940
Seriously.

51:43.940 --> 51:44.940
Good times.

51:44.940 --> 51:45.940
Well, that's it for the email.

51:45.940 --> 51:48.800
Bobby Black Wolf in chat, boy, he's getting a lot of FaceTime tonight.

51:48.800 --> 51:49.800
See?

51:49.800 --> 51:51.480
Because of the fight.

51:51.480 --> 51:56.080
And he commented on our fight, the possible fight between OLR and Black Wolf.

51:56.080 --> 52:02.280
He says, we tried to fight, however, Loki refused to play ChromeHounds, so I won by

52:02.280 --> 52:03.280
default.

52:03.280 --> 52:05.680
Dude, it was like me and some other person.

52:05.680 --> 52:08.120
I think I'd already sold my copy back.

52:08.120 --> 52:13.040
Uh, GS68 says also that we should be fighting with Bobby Black Wolf, but see, that doesn't

52:13.040 --> 52:14.040
work.

52:14.040 --> 52:17.840
This suggests that we should have a fight with Tekken Games.

52:17.840 --> 52:21.040
You know, Raven's Dolphins show, because he always calls it this show and he has his own

52:21.040 --> 52:24.960
thing, the Tekken Games, which is like number three on Op 11 or something like that.

52:24.960 --> 52:26.880
It's just crazy.

52:26.880 --> 52:29.240
Which just proves people watch anything.

52:29.240 --> 52:33.320
See, I'm starting a little fight, starting a little fight.

52:33.320 --> 52:35.320
Just kidding, Raven, if you're listening.

52:35.320 --> 52:37.120
Hugs and kisses.

52:37.120 --> 52:38.120
Let's see.

52:38.120 --> 52:42.640
Oh, and then Black Wolf suggested that we fight one up.

52:42.640 --> 52:44.120
And I'm like, that fight.

52:44.120 --> 52:45.800
I would fight him with a cricket bat.

52:45.800 --> 52:48.320
That fight's so 2006.

52:48.320 --> 52:50.680
I'm over my issues with one up.

52:50.680 --> 52:52.680
I'm over my issues.

52:52.680 --> 52:54.680
Whatever.

52:54.680 --> 52:59.120
I guess so we can't fight anybody, so we have to love everybody.

52:59.120 --> 53:01.120
Hugs and kisses all around.

53:01.120 --> 53:03.760
We love everyone.

53:03.760 --> 53:07.560
The Nintendo Wii Online Development staff, how about that?

53:07.560 --> 53:08.560
Let's fight them.

53:08.560 --> 53:10.360
No, but we need a good fight.

53:10.360 --> 53:13.400
Like a really good bang up fight that people will report on.

53:13.400 --> 53:19.680
Because it's like, you know, O.L.R. threatened to kill somebody's family or something.

53:19.680 --> 53:20.680
Camp threatened to kill families.

53:20.680 --> 53:21.680
That's illegal.

53:21.680 --> 53:22.680
I know.

53:22.680 --> 53:23.680
It is illegal.

53:23.680 --> 53:24.680
Alright.

53:24.680 --> 53:29.520
We need to get some really good dirt on somebody and start a fight with them.

53:29.520 --> 53:31.520
It'd be good for publicity.

53:31.520 --> 53:32.520
Can you work on that, Loki?

53:32.520 --> 53:34.440
You have ties in dark places.

53:34.440 --> 53:36.960
Get some dirt on another cast.

53:36.960 --> 53:38.600
Alright, anyway.

53:38.600 --> 53:43.120
Yeah, don't you know, I'm just like the fucking sleuth.

53:43.120 --> 53:45.560
Alright, then get some news.

53:45.560 --> 53:46.560
God.

53:46.560 --> 53:52.600
Anyways, so, you know, when I'm not digging up dirt, apparently, we're going to be talking

53:52.600 --> 53:54.160
about Square Enix.

53:54.160 --> 53:56.280
And they're focusing on overseas.

53:56.280 --> 54:00.480
Yeah, that's a surprise.

54:00.480 --> 54:05.240
I guess, you know, of course, since they're only known, well, Square Enix is mainly known

54:05.240 --> 54:06.960
for the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest series.

54:06.960 --> 54:09.960
A lot of other stuff that they used to do, unfortunately.

54:09.960 --> 54:11.560
Never saw remixes.

54:11.560 --> 54:13.400
I really want Einhänder.

54:13.400 --> 54:20.920
But now, apparently, they're going to be focusing on overseas markets that have increased more

54:20.920 --> 54:25.360
than to three times the size of the Japanese market.

54:25.360 --> 54:26.360
Thank God.

54:26.360 --> 54:30.360
Maybe that means we'll actually get Final Fantasy XIII in a timely manner.

54:30.360 --> 54:35.680
Instead of having to wait for Japan to get it and then us getting it way afterwards.

54:35.680 --> 54:40.640
So they had, apparently, two strategies planned to seize the opportunities.

54:40.640 --> 54:48.240
First, they're, of course, going to increase their distribution channel ties throughout,

54:48.240 --> 54:51.760
you know, both the United States and, I believe, in Europe.

54:51.760 --> 55:00.800
And of course, the second is, you know, developing more titles overall.

55:00.800 --> 55:02.920
So it's pretty cool.

55:02.920 --> 55:05.420
Alright, well, we here at the Orange Lounge.

55:05.420 --> 55:09.960
You think we'd be really excited about the Orange Box, but I know there's a lot of our

55:09.960 --> 55:11.960
listeners who are excited about the Orange Box.

55:11.960 --> 55:12.960
I am excited about the Orange Box.

55:12.960 --> 55:14.980
It's not games I usually play.

55:14.980 --> 55:16.360
Maybe I should be more excited about it.

55:16.360 --> 55:17.360
Portal!

55:17.360 --> 55:18.360
Come on.

55:18.360 --> 55:21.200
Alright, well, the Orange Box has officially gone gold.

55:21.200 --> 55:22.200
And it's coming out.

55:22.200 --> 55:25.840
You know, the only thing that I wish this would have in it is Gary's mod.

55:25.840 --> 55:33.200
$59.99 on the 360, $49.99 on the PC, Half-Life 2, 1 and 2, Team Fortress 2, and, as Loki

55:33.200 --> 55:35.480
said, Portal, all in the Orange Box.

55:35.480 --> 55:38.840
Well maybe this is the perfect opportunity for me to check it out, because I, you know,

55:38.840 --> 55:44.360
haven't really played Half-Life a whole lot, I mean a little bit, but, you know, I don't

55:44.360 --> 55:47.720
play a lot of these first person shooters and stuff, so.

55:47.720 --> 55:51.620
If you're going to buy it, Loki, then I'll check it out when you get it.

55:51.620 --> 55:54.600
But it's gone gold, so those of you guys that are excited about it, I know there's a couple

55:54.600 --> 55:57.640
of people on my Twitter that are really excited about the Orange Box.

55:57.640 --> 55:59.780
It's on its way very soon.

55:59.780 --> 56:02.120
So take a look for it.

56:02.120 --> 56:07.040
Well, I can't say that I'm too excited about this bit of news, because honestly I don't

56:07.040 --> 56:09.400
give a crap about it.

56:09.400 --> 56:14.840
But some people are happy about it, so for anyone who's interested in the Sam & Max series,

56:14.840 --> 56:21.900
season 2 will be on GameTap starting November 8th for those who have subscribed for it.

56:21.900 --> 56:27.280
And it has Ice Station Santa.

56:27.280 --> 56:31.580
For the person who emailed earlier about the quirky games, here you go, Sam & Max.

56:31.580 --> 56:34.240
I think this is a good little quirky game.

56:34.240 --> 56:35.240
Fun to play.

56:35.240 --> 56:36.240
Enjoy.

56:36.240 --> 56:37.240
You don't like Sam & Max?

56:37.240 --> 56:38.240
I never got into it.

56:38.240 --> 56:39.240
Oh, it's fun.

56:39.240 --> 56:40.240
It's cute.

56:40.240 --> 56:44.560
And funny.

56:44.560 --> 56:50.840
And I like how it's the only episodic game I can think of that actually stayed, like

56:50.840 --> 56:53.120
actually continued to put out episodes.

56:53.120 --> 56:57.660
Like most episodic games you hear about die after two episodes, you know what I mean?

56:57.660 --> 56:58.660
Shenmue.

56:58.660 --> 56:59.660
What?

56:59.660 --> 57:04.160
Shenmue was supposed to be a series of, they're supposed to have a whole line of them giving

57:04.160 --> 57:06.480
episodes of What's-His-Face's Quest.

57:06.480 --> 57:13.080
But see somebody just, you know, it pooped and quit along the way, and this Sam & Max

57:13.080 --> 57:16.520
has been going for a long time.

57:16.520 --> 57:19.760
So hooray to it being a good episodic game.

57:19.760 --> 57:25.480
I did not drop my microphone.

57:25.480 --> 57:26.480
So.

57:26.480 --> 57:32.240
Alright, we're going to open the Skype line very soon if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR

57:32.240 --> 57:37.680
or our username on Skype, Orangelaunchradio, but one more story before we get to that.

57:37.680 --> 57:43.560
Yes, anyways, so it's a little bit disappointing because this was one of the big features of

57:43.560 --> 57:51.680
Unreal Tournament 3 for PlayStation 3, but no cross-platform play.

57:51.680 --> 57:55.240
It was apparently too hard to make, so they scrapped it.

57:55.240 --> 57:59.280
So you'll only be able to play people on the PC if you have the PC version, and only be

57:59.280 --> 58:05.360
able to play people on the PlayStation 3 if you have the PlayStation 3 version.

58:05.360 --> 58:06.600
So sad.

58:06.600 --> 58:09.520
So people on PCs cannot play people on PlayStation 3s.

58:09.520 --> 58:10.520
That's correct.

58:10.520 --> 58:11.720
And it's kind of sad.

58:11.720 --> 58:12.720
That's a bummer.

58:12.720 --> 58:16.980
Alright, well we are going to open up the Skype line over at Orangelaunchradio.com.

58:16.980 --> 58:23.340
Our username, of course, is Orangelaunchradio on Skype, or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

58:23.340 --> 58:27.040
Let's open up the Skype line and see who can get on through.

58:27.040 --> 58:29.440
Hello, you're on Orangelaunchradio.

58:29.440 --> 58:30.440
Who's this?

58:30.440 --> 58:33.240
It's the one and only Legend of Zaku.

58:33.240 --> 58:34.760
Hello, Legend of Zaku.

58:34.760 --> 58:37.360
What's on your mind, my friend?

58:37.360 --> 58:41.600
Just dealing with the aftermath of digital life this weekend, especially the tourney.

58:41.600 --> 58:45.700
I was hoping some of the New Yorkers would call in and tell us all about digital life.

58:45.700 --> 58:48.300
I didn't get a chance to go.

58:48.300 --> 58:50.600
As you know, I wanted to go and I didn't get to go.

58:50.600 --> 58:55.400
Somebody on my Twitter said, not that I should be thankful I didn't go, but that it wasn't

58:55.400 --> 58:56.400
that good to show.

58:56.400 --> 58:57.400
You should be glad that you didn't go.

58:57.400 --> 58:58.400
Ooh, snap.

58:58.400 --> 59:02.680
Let's just say a lot of drama is... Oh shit, what happened?

59:02.680 --> 59:04.280
What happened, Zaku?

59:04.280 --> 59:07.120
Okay, I just want to make this a short story.

59:07.120 --> 59:12.320
I don't want to get people entangled in the current affairs of our community.

59:12.320 --> 59:13.320
Wait, hold on.

59:13.320 --> 59:14.320
Hold on.

59:14.320 --> 59:15.320
Hold on, Zaku.

59:15.320 --> 59:16.320
Wait, hold on.

59:16.320 --> 59:18.080
Remember we were talking about that fight earlier?

59:18.080 --> 59:19.080
Here we go.

59:19.080 --> 59:20.680
We have to start a fight right here.

59:20.680 --> 59:21.680
Okay.

59:21.680 --> 59:22.680
All right.

59:22.680 --> 59:27.720
To sum it up, basically the biggest complaints right now were regarding freestyle and the

59:27.720 --> 59:31.040
way the rest of the other tournaments were run.

59:31.040 --> 59:36.900
Basically the... All right, for starters, the way freestyle turned out, in other words,

59:36.900 --> 59:44.720
people accusing the judges of favoritism and people pissing and moaning on why certain

59:44.720 --> 59:52.120
of their favorite freestylers didn't place at all and there was a lot of name calling.

59:52.120 --> 01:00:01.640
A lot of... It even got to the point where one of the players from Expert Tech actually

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:08.760
cursed out one of the organizers right there and he got de-cued but then ended up staying

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:12.800
after apologizing.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.800
Never mind, it's Dance Dance Revolution drama.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:15.800
Nobody's going to care about that.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:16.800
No, no, no.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:17.800
We have to start a fight somewhere else.

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:18.800
What?

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:20.280
I can email Jackie Poo for you.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:21.280
That's all right.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:28.120
That same guy, mind you, he also cursed out one of the other organizers who also freestyled

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:31.320
there on Saturday and who I happen to know personally.

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:36.920
He just basically... Yeah, he called him out for racism for his body appearance.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:37.920
Oh, boy.

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.880
It was just really nasty.

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:41.920
It was shit-load of like...

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:47.720
So, somebody was cursing out some other guy at Digital Life throwing race and all this

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:49.520
other stuff into it and they didn't get ejected?

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:50.520
Yeah, race factor.

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:51.520
They didn't get ejected?

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:57.880
His appearance because he's a big guy, it's just a lot of immature bullshit that's just

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.560
spanning four pages on the freak right now.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.840
I don't want to get into it because it's...

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:03.840
Okay, so fine.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.960
Go to DDR Freak for your DDR drama.

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:09.920
However, did this ruin Digital Life single-handedly to one little fight ruin the show?

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:10.920
How did that go down?

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:15.960
Well, it turned out pretty good and there was a lot of people that really complimented

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:21.320
and really praised the organizers for running it.

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:27.800
The pad misses were another issue that certain people had sour grapes over.

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:35.480
The way it was set up was that the machines were on the stage and since the stage itself

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:41.760
is not as secure as something like the ground, they have no choice but to put it up there.

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.920
They have no saying in where the machines are actually placed.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:59.800
Zaku, if I didn't know better, I think Digital Life is one giant DDR machine.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.160
No, it's not even that.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.240
It's just... Let's just put it this way.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:09.920
Pad misses were just caused by the instability of the stage, just having all the machines

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:16.800
and people up there and the sensors just going off like that.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:21.640
That was one of the biggest complaints by certain people.

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:26.240
They agreed with the judgment calls because there were many... The people running and

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:32.720
taking down the scores were very, very meticulous in making sure that whatever score was received

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:39.360
was the fairest and most accurate score out there received.

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:44.000
Tell me one thing in Digital Life that was cool that has nothing to do with DDR.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Guitar Hero 3.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.020
It's all right though, but I mean... Music game.

01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:50.020
It's fine.

01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:52.040
He was within the confines of the question.

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:53.040
That's fine.

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:54.040
All right.

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.040
Guitar Hero 3, how was it?

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.040
It was all right.

01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:00.280
I only played it once, but so far it's just nice graphics.

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:01.280
That's all.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:02.280
Same gameplay.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:03.280
New songs.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.280
Same gameplay.

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:10.440
Yeah, but I just can't get my mind off of the 800-pound gorilla in the room, which is

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:14.480
the DDR tournament that's still lingering right now.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:15.480
I'm sorry.

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:22.840
I just hope next year we just fix what we had that went wrong this time.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:24.720
I can't take the DDR talk anymore.

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:25.720
I'm sorry.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.400
I had to hit the red button to end it.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.080
I can't deal with the DDR drama anymore.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:33.480
I'm sorry, guys.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:38.560
If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:39.560
Hi.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:40.560
You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:41.560
Who's this?

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:42.560
It's GS68.

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:43.560
Hi, GS68.

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.320
What DDR drama would you like to report on tonight?

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:49.000
Actually, not really DDR drama.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.600
I just want to say drama in general sucks ass.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.960
Yeah, drama in general is kind of crappy.

01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:00.680
Someone violated the card line thingy today when I was playing Maximum Tune 3.

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:04.720
I so was about to hit the hang-up button because I thought you were going to say they violated

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:08.920
the card thing on DDR, and I was like, God damn it, I'm cutting off the Skype calls.

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:11.640
Okay, but it was Midnight Maximum Tune.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:12.640
I'm okay then.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:13.640
All right, so what happened?

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:22.200
Well, I have a card up on the machine to show what was next, and this guy starts to look

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:27.040
for coins so he can continue, and then I tell him that my turn is next, and then apparently

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:32.520
it's not about the card roll, so I tell him about it, and then he still wants to continue,

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:37.160
and then when he finally gets off, he calls me dumb and a faggot, et cetera.

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:44.040
So what I did was I started a game and did one of the Metro courses.

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.040
Can't we all just get along?

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:49.840
I mean, seriously, people, you all are fighting each other over, and here's the thing.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:54.200
You're starting fights over Dance Dance Revolution.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:56.180
Can't anyone see the comedy in this?

01:04:56.180 --> 01:05:02.920
And then now you're calling people a fag because they beat you to playing Midnight Maximum

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:08.080
Tune, and this gives you the right to call other people gay?

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.080
Come on.

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:13.040
Because, you know, making it to a machine first is a really different sexuality.

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:20.920
I know, his penis must be so large that I'd be like, you know, get it.

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:25.000
How would you feel if someone hogged the machine when your turn was next?

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.360
Anyway, drama sucks.

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:28.360
Tell me something.

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:29.860
I need to hear a happy story, GS68.

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:30.880
Something good happened this week.

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:31.880
Didn't it?

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:32.880
Anything?

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:33.880
Something?

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:37.040
Well, seeing as new sites don't cover arcade games, I'll cover the arcade games myself,

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.920
I finally got to play Initial D4.

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.480
Oh, I didn't even know Initial D4 came out.

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:42.480
How was that?

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:43.720
Um, it was alright.

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:47.840
I like the drifty physics because it felt more like drift racing.

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:50.200
Is that something that's new over Initial D3?

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:56.120
Yeah, Initial D3, there was some drifting, but you couldn't see it unless you were in

01:05:56.120 --> 01:06:02.320
third person view, which was useless because the camera wasn't right on your butt, so it's

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:06.000
very hard to control your car.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.840
And does it still have all the fabulous Eurobeat in Initial D4?

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:13.920
Yeah, but I heard you can't pick your own song, I just randomly choose for you.

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.880
That's so that the same person doesn't play heartbeat over and over and over again because

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.880
they don't know how to change the song.

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:25.280
Well, not if you're in speed car over and over, like the song was, Speedcar, Speedcar,

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:29.800
AEAT6, he's coming.

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:33.600
Now suddenly we've turned into a singing karaoke show, no that's alright.

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.600
This is the Eurobeat hour.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:39.120
Same, this is the strangest Skypline segment ever.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:44.720
Alright, GS60A, any quick last thoughts before we move on?

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:45.720
Um, no.

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:48.040
Alright, take care GS60A, have a good one.

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.040
You too.

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.560
And punch that kid in the face next time they try to call you names.

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:58.000
Alright, not that I should be encouraging that, I'm just kidding.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
You can't win with violence.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.480
877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, give us a call, let's talk.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.720
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.000
This is Brad from Pod Culture.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.400
Hello, Brad from Pod Culture, so good to hear from you, what's on your mind?

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:16.560
Well, you said you wanted to hear from somebody who was crazy enough to be in a midnight launch

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.560
of Halo 3.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:21.160
Oh, and let me guess, it was you, wasn't it?

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:22.160
Oh yeah.

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:26.440
Alright, so why, why did you have to be there at midnight to be, I mean, you couldn't wait

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.440
until the next day?

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.360
It's more of a social thing than anything else.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:31.360
I agree with that.

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:35.120
He had to be there because someone cut in front of him, you know, for midnight maximum

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:39.640
on Toon 3, and then, you know, the stage was unstable for DDR.

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:44.960
Well, when I had pre-ordered my copy at Best Buy, they had said that they were going to

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:47.440
be open until midnight.

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.400
Ours here in Louisville weren't.

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:50.400
Louisville?

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.400
Louisville.

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.400
Louisville, Kentucky.

01:07:52.400 --> 01:08:00.240
Sorry, for a second I thought it was Louisville, it looks like Louisville, no, like Louisville.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:04.040
Only city can take a horse race and turn it into a three week party.

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:11.320
You know what, my uncle used to live there for a little while, and that's exactly the

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:12.920
same way he described it.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:17.240
Well, no, he lived there for a little while with some woman that he was seeing, and then

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:24.040
he moved to, right outside Nashville, which is almost as bad.

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:27.680
Alright, so you were in the line in Louisville, and

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.080
Yeah, I actually went to three different lines, actually.

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.560
Dang, so you had to go all around.

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:40.040
Well, the Best Buy wasn't open, so our co-host, Glenn, had his pre-order at a GameStop over

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.040
in Indiana.

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.500
So we're, that's about 15, 20 minutes away, so I drove over there to meet him, and they

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:51.120
didn't have any more of the collector's edition, so I drove over to meet a friend at another

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:56.400
GameStop here in Louisville, they didn't have any, and wound up in line at Circuit City.

01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:57.400
Wow.

01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:02.080
Yeah, okay, Circuit City, not a lot of people seem to shop at Circuit City anymore, so that

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.080
makes sense.

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.920
There's only like 20 or 30 people in line.

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:09.220
I remember when we went out, when the Nintendo Wii went on sale, we went around to all the

01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:12.440
different lines, which, by the way, yes, there is a difference between the Wii Midnight Launch

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:15.800
and this, is that you knew everybody was going to have Halo 3 coming out the ass the next

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:19.040
day, but when the Wii came out, you had to be in line at midnight, or you weren't getting

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.040
the Wii.

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.040
Big difference.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:23.160
I finally saw a Wii on the shelf the other day.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:25.040
There you go.

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.040
Big difference.

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:28.720
Anyway, yeah, yeah, there was like, what, four people at Circuit City?

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:32.660
There was less than 20, 15, 20, 25 people, something like that.

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:34.360
But so you got it?

01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:39.120
Yeah, I got it, and the guy ahead of me spent like 800 bucks.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.720
That's right, you sent us a private message earlier, so he went all out.

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:44.680
Did he say why he was so crazy for Halo?

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:49.080
Well, if he hadn't actually had his girlfriend with him, I would have thought he hadn't moved

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.800
out of his parents' basement yet.

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:53.360
He was pretty geeky.

01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:55.360
Maybe the girlfriend lives with him in the parents' basement.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:57.000
Well, that could be it, too.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.640
Some girlfriends will visit their boyfriends in their parents' basement, sometimes, and

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:06.480
then they'll realize that he's kind of, you know, not desirable.

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.480
But yeah, he...

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.480
But he loves me.

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.000
800 bucks for a game, that was crazy.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.320
He hits me because he does me.

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:16.080
Well, you know, we are in Kentucky here.

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:22.440
Hey, hey, I'm not from too much farther away from there, so...

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:25.600
So yeah, it was actually a lot of fun hanging around talking to people.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:30.000
Now, you sent me a private message about some of the voice acting in Halo 3 that you discovered

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000
during the credits.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Yeah.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Some pretty popular sci-fi stars.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
I know you love your sci-fi.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.760
Who can we find in Halo 3, in the voice acting?

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:40.720
Nathan Fillion, Adam Baldwin, and Alan Tudyk from Firefly.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:41.720
Cool.

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:42.720
Ooh, nice!

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.520
And Katie Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica.

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:46.720
She is awesome, and bionic woman now.

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:47.720
Yep.

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:51.160
Of which I missed on Wednesday, but I have a T-vote, I'm going to watch it a little later.

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.880
She's freaking nuts on that show.

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:54.960
I hear she's the reason to watch that show.

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:55.960
Yeah.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.600
So I'm definitely going to want to check that out.

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:03.320
Good times, but some, maybe not A-list actors, in the sci-fi world, they're definitely on

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:07.840
the A-list, but some, you know, some pretty well-known actors there for the Halo 3.

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:11.600
Every time I think of dude, I still cry over the end of Firefly.

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.360
Let's not do spoilers.

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:15.680
I'm not saying anything.

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:16.680
All right.

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:19.280
Oh, come on, the movie's been out two years.

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.280
All right, that's fine.

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:23.320
That was just a sucky way to die, okay?

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.320
That sucked!

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:25.760
I'm a leaf on the wind.

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:28.600
No, you're a leaf pinned to a chair.

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:29.600
Splat!

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:30.600
Ouch.

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:31.600
Oh, man.

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:39.520
I wanted to hunt Joss down and burn my Joss Whedon is my Master Now shirt.

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:40.520
All right, nerds.

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:42.800
We've got to wrap up this call and take some more nerdy calls.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:46.760
I'm going to watch The Sarah Jean Adventures, I promise, since the new episodes are out.

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:47.760
Excellent show.

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:48.760
All right, catch you later, guys.

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:49.760
Bye.

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:50.760
All right, take care, Brad.

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:51.880
Thanks for calling.

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:53.000
Ask and ye shall receive.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
We asked to hear from crazies that were in the Halo 3 line, and we heard from one.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
That was great.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Let's go to the next call.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.240
Hello, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.240
Who's this?

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:03.520
Sarah Jean Adventures, I promise, since the new episodes are out.

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:04.520
Hello?

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:05.520
Can you hear us?

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:06.520
Yeah, hello?

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:07.520
Hi.

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.520
Hello, who's this?

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:09.520
Hey, what's going on?

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:10.520
This is GZ.

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.520
Is this who?

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.520
GZDR4E.

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:17.600
Okay, what's on your mind, buddy?

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.600
Digital life.

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:22.960
Ah, I swear to God, if this is about DDR, we're not continuing this phone call, but

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:23.960
what's on your mind?

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:26.280
How is digital life?

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:27.920
Retro arcade area.

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.120
Big problem.

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:31.720
What big problem in the retro...

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:37.440
Apparently, on VIP day on Thursday, they wanted Billy Mitchell to have a photo out with the

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.320
Donkey Kong machine.

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:41.480
I was playing on the machine.

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:44.160
They told me to get off the machine.

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.160
I refused.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:49.680
They threatened to take my VIP pass and kick me off the premises.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:53.520
So I just let them have the machine.

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:55.240
Were you going for a high score or something?

01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:59.520
I mean, were you about ready to be the new King of Kong?

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:03.080
Just playing off the machine.

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:04.080
What was that?

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:08.240
Just playing the machine.

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:11.440
So I mean, how does that feel that they had to just kick you off there because somebody

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:14.280
more important was in town and needed a photo op?

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:16.280
That's kind of got to suck.

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:21.160
Yeah, it's all about power there, I guess.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:25.280
You're going to have to actually get the world record on the machine, and then you'll be

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:28.640
able to get on any Donkey Kong machine you want in the world.

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:31.560
There you have it.

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:35.160
So were you so mad that you just kind of left, or did you walk around and check out other

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:36.880
stuff that was at Digital Life?

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:41.640
No, I just left, I was mad.

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:42.640
Wow.

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:43.640
All right.

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:50.640
Well, I'm sorry to hear that about getting kicked off the machine, but will you try again

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:53.680
for Digital Life next year, or you think you're kind of done with it?

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:55.880
Yeah, I'll try again next year.

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:56.880
All right.

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:00.880
Well, just be careful because if there's a movie about asteroids next year, you'll probably

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:05.520
want to stay away from the asteroid's machine or the same thing might happen.

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:08.520
Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.480
All right, take care.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.680
All right, take care.

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:16.840
There's connection problems there or something, but thank you for sharing the injustices of

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:20.080
Donkey Kong in this world.

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:21.080
Sorry to hear it.

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:23.280
All right, let's go to the phones and take more calls.

01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:25.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Who's this?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:32.600
So, I heard that they were holding the bar, and that wasn't cool.

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:33.600
Wow.

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.280
Welcome to DDR Drama Chat.

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:36.280
How can we help you?

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:38.280
No, this is Bobby.

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:39.280
What's going on, guys?

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:40.280
Hi, Bobby.

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:41.280
How are you?

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:42.280
It's good to hear from you.

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:46.680
You were asking about people that were in a Halo 3 midnight launch.

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:49.720
How did I know you'd call about this?

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:50.720
Yeah, what happened?

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:51.720
What's your story?

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:56.840
Well, actually, the full story I'm not going to go into, but I was actually up in Bellevue,

01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:02.080
Washington as a guest of Microsoft, so I attended one of the big midnight launches.

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:06.320
I was not standing in line for it, but it was a huge party.

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.160
It was actually fun being there.

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:10.200
I had fun, and I wasn't even getting the game.

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.200
Wow.

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:13.160
It was a cheap piece of skinnier in person.

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.200
Just wanted to throw that out there.

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.200
Okay.

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:17.760
So, what did you guys get to do?

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:21.160
Didn't you guys get to go hand out goodies to people in line and stuff?

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:26.600
Yeah, I handed out some Halo 3 shirts, and we had some Halo 3 lanyards, and these little

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:29.440
five-dollar Burger King credit card things.

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:34.040
So, we were giving out, it doesn't get you a happy meal or anything, but it was at least

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:35.040
five dollars towards something.

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:40.600
We were just giving those out to people in the line for doing stupid stuff or just throwing

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:41.600
them out.

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:42.600
That sounds like fun.

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:44.600
Were there tons of people there?

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:45.600
There were probably about four hundred.

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:46.600
Wow.

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:48.560
Four hundred to five hundred people there, all in line.

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:52.000
It stretched all the way down to the Home Depot that was across the parking lot.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Dang.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000
And everything.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.160
Mountain Dew was giving out the game fuel and all their other stuff, and Balls showed

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:05.360
up with this big, huge van, and Bungee showed up in a big charter bus coming straight from

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:09.720
their launch party, so they were all boozed up and giving out calendars and swag.

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:10.720
Bill Gates showed up.

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:15.960
He shook hands with the first fifty people in line right after he rolled out of bed.

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:16.960
But it was a big party.

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:22.120
I think Warren Moon was there, and everybody was like, we love you in tech mobile.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:26.280
I wish we could have been there to hand out orange soda and cookies in our traditional

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:28.640
fashion, but maybe next, maybe for Halo 4.

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:31.800
Oh wait, I guess there can't be a Halo 4, can there?

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:32.800
Yeah, well.

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:34.120
They'll find a way.

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:37.040
Now, it's just the end of the story arc.

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:39.160
They never said it was the end of Halo.

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.800
Doesn't the box advertise the end to the Halo chosen?

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:42.800
Halo Wars will be there.

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:43.800
There'll be more.

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:44.800
There'll be more.

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.240
There'll be another game to get excited about later.

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:47.240
There's always something.

01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:53.480
Now, they did throw out these stress balls that were oranges, and they were actually

01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:56.400
throwing them at people, like helping people with it.

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:58.560
Did you save one for us, Bobby?

01:16:58.560 --> 01:16:59.560
They didn't help them at me.

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:00.560
They were throwing people in line.

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:01.560
I'm so sorry.

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:02.560
That's alright.

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:08.800
We'll just put that on the list of reasons to start a fight with you, that's all.

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:09.800
There you go.

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:15.800
Yeah, people were walking out of there with big Halo clicks, the big, huge Spartan stuff,

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:20.520
because there was the WizKids stuff, and people were walking out of there with hundreds of

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:25.600
dollars worth of stuff, and I'm like, you guys realize this is just for a DVD?

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:29.600
Did you see people dropping $800, like the guy Brad said he saw that bought the Xbox?

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:30.600
Yes.

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:31.600
With the game?

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:32.600
Oh my gosh.

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:37.360
We did see somebody walk out with the big, huge Halo action clicks, figuring it was a

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:43.040
$800 and the legendary edition, and then I did see one Xbox 360 sold along with that

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:45.680
stuff, so yeah, I can fully believe.

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:49.040
Was that people just caught up in the moment, you think, or do you think there's just people

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:52.000
that are that hardcore for their Halo?

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.160
I think it'd be people that are that hardcore, or to buy the 360, it might be somebody who

01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:58.680
never got a 360 until Halo came out.

01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:05.440
Yeah, that would make sense, because I got the original Xbox as a Halo one, because I

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:09.680
didn't buy it until Halo was out, and it had been out a little while, and they did those

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:15.640
special green Xboxes, and I was like, oh, I have to get one of those, so I guess that

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:16.640
was me.

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.800
I didn't wait no midnight line for it either, though.

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:23.920
You didn't need to wait in a midnight line, because as I've been telling some people,

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:28.160
the Fry's Electronics near me, we walked in yesterday, there are 10 legendary editions

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.160
sitting on the shelf.

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:35.000
Yeah, I went to Fry's too, and they just had tons and tons of Halo 3, and I didn't even

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
get the limited edition.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.760
I'm not that into Halo, I just got the regular game.

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:45.320
Yeah, they only gave us the regular game, so I don't have any of the cutscene discs

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.520
or anything else that came with it.

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:53.720
Well, Loki had the other one early, because he's sly like that.

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:54.720
Good times.

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:57.960
Which reminds me, I still need to load the bonus stuff that you have on your one disc,

01:18:57.960 --> 01:18:58.960
Loki.

01:18:58.960 --> 01:18:59.960
Don't let me forget.

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:00.960
Anyhow.

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:02.360
Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners, Bobby?

01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:04.080
I'm glad to hear you had a good time.

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.680
Yeah, no, that's it.

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:10.560
You just wanted to talk about the Halo 3 launch, but really, that guy, when he touched the

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:15.440
bar and we just really all got pissed off at him and stuff, that just...

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:16.440
They didn't kick him out.

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:22.280
Okay, I had to hang up on Bobby, because I didn't want to hear about DDR drama.

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:23.920
And there is no bar raping in Halo.

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:24.920
Come on.

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:25.920
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:26.920
Who's this?

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:27.920
Hey, guys.

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:28.920
It's SSJ-100 Matt.

01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:31.760
Well, hello, SSJ-100 Matt.

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:32.760
What's on your mind?

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:37.080
I'm exhausted from a digital life.

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:38.760
Dare I ask about...

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:39.760
I don't know.

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.320
There's no drama on this call.

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:42.320
Even though I judged...

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.320
Praise you.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.320
You're a great man.

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:46.900
Even though what?

01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:52.360
Even though I was helping the judge on the elephant in the room.

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:58.740
Okay, well, tell us about digital life, like what else you saw there and some of the other

01:19:58.740 --> 01:19:59.740
stuff.

01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:03.160
What else there was in digital life besides DDR?

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:06.520
For the most part, well, this is my first time going.

01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:11.840
From what I understand, it was a lot smaller than last year, but gaming-wise, I had a really

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:15.080
good time.

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:21.800
They premiered a lot of games that haven't been out yet, mostly PC stuff.

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:30.200
I got to play World in Conflict, I should say, which I thought was pretty good.

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:37.840
I wanted to try to get on Hellgate London, but the line was too long for that.

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:43.480
And the biggest surprise, I would say, and Loki's going to hate me for this, was The

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.560
Eye of Judgment.

01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:46.560
Really?

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:47.960
Another positive...

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.640
Is this a positive review of The Eye of Judgment?

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:50.640
You thought it was cool?

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:51.640
Yes.

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:57.720
Yeah, I don't have a PS3 yet, but I would seriously consider it.

01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:01.140
This is not the first person that's called in to say The Eye of Judgment is better than

01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:02.140
you think.

01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:05.480
Actually, I was hearing some good reviews from the GameCrazy managers when they got

01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:06.600
back from conference.

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:07.880
What the crap is going on?

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:11.480
That you don't have to photocopy or buy any booster packs or anything.

01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:13.700
It comes with all of the cards available for the game.

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:18.200
But Jamie, seriously, you did see the same thing we saw at E3 last year, right?

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:19.200
With The Eye of Judgment?

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:20.200
I didn't go to The Eye of Judgment.

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:24.280
It doesn't come with all of the cards, because that's why they sell booster packs in assorted

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:25.280
decks.

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:28.800
No, that's what they were saying at the GameCrazy managers conference that's coming with them

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:29.800
all intact.

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:32.040
I bet you it's not.

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:33.040
That's from the vendor.

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.040
I'm misinformed.

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:35.040
That's from the vendor.

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:36.040
Wait, hold on.

01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:37.040
Let's go back to the hall.

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:38.040
What caller?

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:42.040
From what I understand, from what I was told, actually Wizards of the Coast is handling

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:44.040
the game packs, I believe.

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:48.320
Well, I actually should, because they were the ones hosting the event.

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:55.960
But anyways, they're going to be giving out 150 cards when you buy the game, at least

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:56.960
that's what they say.

01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:57.960
Well, maybe that was what it was.

01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:01.120
Yeah, because they figured out, probably, that everyone's going to pirate them anyways,

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:02.120
so.

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:03.120
All right.

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:07.400
Well, actually, you know, I'm going to be sending you guys a couple gifts, and one of

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:10.560
the gifts is actually a couple cards from the game.

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.680
So you guys will get this checked.

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:13.680
Awesome.

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:16.160
I'm actually thinking about getting the game, honestly.

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:19.600
Go right ahead, it's not going to sell a million units.

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:20.760
I'm just not going to happen.

01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:23.800
I think this turnaround is hilarious, in my own mind.

01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:28.600
Well, just from what I was hearing from the feedback from the manager's conference, I

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:31.200
was like, well, I'll give it a try.

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:32.200
So maybe.

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:33.200
All right.

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:43.560
What else in digital life would you think was cool?

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:46.960
They touched on it before, but I really like Guitar Hero 3.

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:48.760
Okay.

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:52.840
It was kind of hard to hear any of the songs, because, you know, the whole convention itself

01:22:52.840 --> 01:23:02.360
was loud as hell, but it just reminded me, it just seemed like a better version of one

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:05.360
and two.

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:09.480
Someone said it seems like modifiers, but there are involved, but I don't know how true

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:12.320
that is.

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:15.160
So it didn't just feel like Guitar Hero 2 with new songs?

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:23.200
No, it didn't seem like a copy and paste, like 80s style, or whatever, 80s mix.

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:26.840
Which basically was a copy and paste job, but that's a whole other story.

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:27.840
Yeah.

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:28.840
All right.

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:32.640
So if you had to judge digital life on a scale of one to ten, what would you give it?

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:38.920
Well, considering this was my first one, I'd have to give it like seven out of ten.

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:39.920
All right.

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:40.920
It's not bad.

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:48.240
Yeah, I'll be sending you guys out a couple of stuff, including some VROs I got from the

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:51.240
Elephant in the Closet.

01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:54.200
The game we can't speak of tonight.

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:58.040
We're going to give it the JT treatment, I guess.

01:23:58.040 --> 01:23:59.040
That's all right.

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:02.960
No, we do love DDR, which is why it pains us so much to hear about all this drama.

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:03.960
Can't we all just get along?

01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:05.240
You people are playing a dancing game.

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.240
Don't take it that seriously.

01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:07.240
All right.

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:11.720
Well, SJ100, Matt, we've got to let you go, but thank you so much for calling in and giving

01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:15.520
us a drama-free report from Digital Life.

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:16.520
We appreciate it.

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:17.520
Don't mention it.

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:18.520
All right.

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:19.520
Take care, buddy.

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:20.520
Yep.

01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:21.520
Take care.

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:22.520
I love this.

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:23.520
Mr. Gohan in chat sums this up perfectly.

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.320
After this, who knows?

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:28.740
Africa could be Loki's favorite game ever.

01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:30.440
Only if I get to run over the animals.

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.080
All right, guys.

01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:33.720
That's going to do it for the Sky Flying tonight.

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:36.760
Sorry to those folks that didn't get through, but thank you guys very much.

01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:38.720
We've been going a long time on this segment.

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:42.200
It's about time to go around and wrap things up, but first, we've got to ask if there's

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:44.200
any last-minute stories.

01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:45.200
No.

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.200
No.

01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:47.200
Wow.

01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:49.200
No last-minute stories.

01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:50.200
That might be a first.

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:51.600
In other news, I like beer.

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:52.600
All right.

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:53.600
Me too.

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:55.440
Well, then let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.000
Dark Sakura, we'll start with you.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000
What's your final thought?

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.360
In other words, I like beer.

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:06.720
My final thought is I need another air conditioning event in here because it's getting too hot.

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:07.720
Too hot.

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:08.720
Loki.

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:12.640
My final thought is asshole Mario is hilarious.

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:13.640
Hilarious.

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:16.040
It's like you can't stop watching it.

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:17.040
I can't.

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:20.800
We'll see you back here next week, boys and girls, for Orange Launch Radio episode number

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:23.200
250, if you can believe it.

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:29.520
I'm telling you, I know how G4 is desperate for television to play all these back-to-back.

01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:30.520
There you go.

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:31.520
There's a good hour block.

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:32.520
Isn't it a three-day weekend?

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:33.520
What?

01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:34.520
Next weekend.

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:35.520
Is next weekend a three-day weekend?

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:36.520
I don't think so.

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:37.520
I don't know.

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:38.520
Unless you get Columbus Day off.

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:39.520
I get Columbus Day.

01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:40.520
That's why.

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:41.520
Because I work for...

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:42.520
I think it's Columbus Day.

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:43.520
Because I get banking holidays.

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.520
Well, lucky you.

01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:45.520
Not me.

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:46.520
I'm going to get...

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:50.120
I'm going to bring some Metoxa and drink it on the show.

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:51.120
All right.

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:52.440
Stay tuned and see how that goes.

01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:55.520
We'll be back next week with more of Orange Launch Radio.

01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:56.520
See you guys then.

01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:57.520
