487	1368	Orange Lounge Radio
15436	19079	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
45592	49253	Rain's nice, but you know... I opened all the windows in the house while I was home.
49433	52574	Yeah, I don't necessarily want to go out and play in it, but I have the view.
52614	54775	I can look in the backyard and watch the rain fall.
55075	55915	Rain is great.
56316	56796	Rain's okay.
57836	58996	It's overrated sometimes.
59056	61477	If I wanted to see rain all the time, I'd live in Seattle or something.
61897	63018	Live in Alabama for a while.
63498	64498	Do they get a lot of rain there too?
64698	65318	Oh, hell yeah.
66139	68720	Second highest precipitation in the country.
68760	70640	It's a subtropical climate.
71140	72101	Less weather, more games.
72641	72861	Yes.
74034	85028	One interesting thing to happen this week is that Intel has actually bought the physics engine Havoc and is now going to be incorporating it into their product.
86221	95205	Interesting enough, Havoc Engine's been in quite a few games, including Bioshock, Stranglehold, Halo 2, Half-Life 2, Oblivion, and Crackdown.
95565	98506	And they've bought the company for $21 million.
98526	102327	So, it's pretty cool.
102408	104508	I could sell them my cat for $21 million.
104969	111791	So maybe we'll see some more Havoc stuff built into the new Intel chips, which would be good, because, you know, physics are awesome.
112011	113012	That's the new wave now.
114437	116419	Take it from Loki, physics are awesome.
117501	117841	In games.
117861	118943	Wouldn't it be physics is?
119163	120144	Real physics suck.
121987	123208	Intelligence are awesome.
125289	126831	Intelligence are awesome.
145209	148734	Apparently it had 4 out of 5 pieces of a tier 6 armor set.
149075	150316	Obviously the damn thing was level 7.
151618	155824	It had legendary swords that were dropped by Illidan Stormrage.
156184	158728	So basically it was about as high of a character as you can get.
159608	160469	And there you have it.
160489	161189	This character sold for $10,000.
162510	167633	Granted, I don't know where this sold, but I'm assuming it was on eBay or something.
167913	169654	The price was in euros, so it had to be in Europe.
169915	171856	Well, yeah, but was it like eBay Europe or what?
171956	172376	I'm not sure.
172556	175118	If I were rich, I would buy him and delete him.
177760	182262	I thought it was funny they were mentioning in there that the person that bought it, his regular account was banned.
184244	185464	Oh, so that's why they bought it.
185504	186145	That makes sense.
187586	191607	Yeah, that totally makes sense to spend $10,000 on a character.
191647	192087	Never mind.
192107	192607	Well, okay.
192887	195988	In somebody's mind, though, dude, what if they had a lot of friends on there or something?
196028	200309	If I had that much money, well, you know, I would do actually constructive things with it.
200330	204131	It's probably someone like Ashley Simpson or something like, I'm totally hardcore, yo!
204851	206231	Look at all the stuff I earned!
207091	207772	All the stuff.
208112	209092	I'm super awesome.
209412	215154	And of course, the chat, our chat room, chat.orangemonstrator.com is asking about Force Strength, Force Dam, Leather Belts.
215294	215754	You know what?
216394	216714	Shut up.
218507	219748	I'm only going to tell you this once, chat.
219808	220128	Shut up.
221188	221949	It's an inside joke.
221969	222149	Forget it.
222169	227811	Yeah, but World of Warcraft doesn't have a goat helmet like Ragnarok does.
227951	231433	You know what else World of Warcraft doesn't have that Ragnarok does have that's pretty awesome?
231833	233213	The bow that you can wear in your hair.
233233	234414	I know the bow is great.
234514	236135	You can get a giant bow, Rob.
236215	237695	I used to have a SARS mask and a bow.
237936	238476	It was awesome.
238556	239376	I gave you your bow.
239936	240176	Anyway.
241217	242798	It used to be my cell phone.
243538	247680	I will think about playing Ragnarok on your server, but after I beat Eternal Sonata...
250253	251633	Please don't ever tell me that again.
252914	257454	No, in one of the dungeons it's like, because the drop rate is so high, you leave with like 500 pairs of panties.
261595	262476	Only on this program.
263956	264376	It's Ragnarok.
264396	265996	Women throwing their panties at me.
267777	270177	Anyway, next story please, panty lover.
271257	272938	Don't wanna, I quit.
273138	273798	Do not want!
274318	274518	No.
275707	282451	New downloadable content for Guitar Hero 2 will have some pretty, pretty cool stuff.
283051	289455	Trivium's Detonation, Atreyu Right Side of the Bed, and Protest the Heroes Bury the Hatchet.
290296	292377	I just think it's rad there's a band called Atreyu.
293898	294338	We did.
294478	295959	That was the dude in NeverEnding Story.
296019	296339	I know.
297079	299681	Their cover of You Give Love a Bad Name.
300461	305222	It's like the verse parts are awful because he's also just doing nothing but screaming.
305842	307123	But like the chorus parts are great.
307763	310963	So that's like the worst and best cover ever.
311323	314344	The cover does in fact give love a bad name, actually.
314604	315765	It gives everything a bad name.
315785	318585	Phil Do in our chatroom says Atreyu sucks.
319665	320706	They suck.
321786	322806	But they have a rad name.
322946	325687	I mean, they might totally suck, but they have a rad name.
325827	326527	You can't deny that.
327435	331036	Well, it's even worse, though, if you have a crappy band with a cool name.
331316	333617	It's like, why didn't you pick a crappy name?
334297	336698	Damn it, now, like, a cool band can't have your name.
337258	337658	Loser.
337858	340939	What was that quote in Wayne's World, one of my favorite movies of all time?
342419	343479	Who else is playing tonight?
343739	344660	The Shitty Beatles.
344880	345740	The Shitty Beatles?
345980	346720	Yeah, they suck.
346840	348041	Oh, that's not just a clever name.
348561	349541	Yeah, that was great.
351942	354742	I'm sure I butchered that quote, but I could almost quote that entire movie.
355063	356223	That's how much I love Wayne's World.
356483	356703	Anyway.
358157	360598	Back to games, please help save the show.
362219	362659	Anyways.
364940	380287	So, you know, if you're not into downloading songs off of Xbox Live, well, maybe you just want to buy the soundtrack to Guitar Hero 3 and put that in your system and unlock some more songs that way.
380687	386450	Apparently, actually, there will be a code to download some songs off of Xbox Live and
387273	389254	to be added into Guitar Hero 3.
389514	409785	Three tracks that you unlock include, let's see here, a track by AFI, Carcigen Crush, looks like Tina by Flyleaf, and a remix of Marilyn Manson's Putting Holes in Happiness by Nick Zinner of the Yayayas.
413567	415548	So how much you want to bet?
417653	423560	How much do you want to bet that these songs are already in the game and you're just having to buy the soundtrack?
423900	426223	You're just locking them on the disc already.
427124	428125	And that pisses people off.
428166	430909	I notice that pisses a lot of Xbox people off.
431474	435257	When they download these things and they find that they're just keys to unlock shit that was already on the disc.
435357	436478	But here's the thing, though, about this.
436898	441181	It wasn't really clear to me whether this is just for the 360 or what.
441661	443343	I mean, this is coming from Billboard.
443363	445644	They were saying that this is going to be a code or whatever.
445864	451068	But they may misinterpret it to actually being a physical code that you punch into the game.
451508	454410	Because obviously this game is coming out on almost all the platforms.
454531	459214	So it wouldn't be surprising if it's just a little key code that you put in.
460283	462967	I like all that exclusive GameStop content you get.
464049	467154	Just a code that ends up leaking out in the internet later on anyways.
468355	471800	Well, this kind of news makes me angsty, but it's not time for that segment yet.
472261	475366	So instead I have to do some news that makes me happy.
476462	478503	GameTap, GameTap, GameTap, GameTap, GameTap, GameTap, GameTap, GameTap,
506596	507317	Oh my god, it's so much fun.
507337	514448	When I used to hang out with Iguana Girl, we used to just go over and do nothing but play.
515989	517530	Typing of the Dead for like hours.
517630	518431	I'm not even joking.
518771	520873	What was the version of it they had at Arcade Infinity for a while?
520893	521653	It was the Japanese one.
521773	526737	Yeah, the Japanese one, but like you couldn't beat one of the bosses because it asks you trivia questions and you can't beat it.
526757	528218	Because it's in Japanese.
528238	529259	Yeah, unless you can speak it.
529619	532781	But man, playing the Japanese one was hard because you wouldn't know the words.
534222	544089	Well, I think that it had like an all like an English typing mode and then it had the Kana mode and I used to actually have
544625	545806	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
565675	570699	Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we read them here live on air.
570759	575903	Dark Sakura will answer your questions or she'll taunt you and make fun of your grammar and punctuation.
576664	578706	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to do it.
578746	581388	Dark Sakura, open up the mailbag, dive on in.
581588	582108	What do we got?
582789	585191	The first one comes from Spamoflage.
585811	586612	That's a great name.
588169	590090	Guys, you make my Monday morning at work fun.
590150	591091	Thanks for the podcast.
591451	602041	Why is Uncharted referred to as Tomb Raider with a guy and unoriginal, whereas every single World War II slash army type slash alien space type first person shooter isn't criticized for lack of originality?
602742	604804	Lastly, I've noticed a trend on your show.
605144	609368	One, Loki makes an Xbox 360 announcement and follows it with a neutral or positive comment.
609748	613031	Two, Loki makes a PS3 announcement followed by a sarcastic or negative comment.
613601	614081	Don't believe me?
614141	614541	Try this.
614621	621624	Loki, ask the ever so lovely DarkSakura to ring a bell every time you say something negative about the PS3 and see how many times you catch yourself.
621764	622004	Enough.
622364	622784	Why the hate?
622804	623164	Come on.
623224	624425	Thanks.
624545	624885	P.S.
625185	627106	No idea how to spell Loki, so make fun of me.
627146	627646	I deserve it.
628686	630547	It's L-O-K-I, not with two E's.
631287	632187	That looks very girly.
633348	633808	Loki!
634188	635748	That's like a MySpace name.
636389	637249	Seriously.
639368	641911	Put a T in there, you have loquette.
642111	643072	Should we do that next week?
643112	643512	Get a bell?
644012	644813	Let's do it.
645273	647455	Let's keep a little tally thing.
647495	648036	A little tally?
648076	648336	Alright.
648676	654121	Next week, we'll get DarkSakura a bell, and every time Loki makes a negative comment about the PlayStation 3, we'll ring it.
654361	656363	Well, maybe they should stop making it so damn easy.
656923	657423	Seriously.
657524	659045	I mean, come on.
659185	661006	I own both systems, okay?
661147	661367	So...
662589	665110	I can't help it if they keep disappointing me.
665390	668072	Okay, well, the emailer raises a valid point.
669312	676636	Why does this Uncharted get passed off as Tomb Raider with a guy, whereas lots of other games are copies of each other?
677356	680357	Well, I'm not saying that all the games that come out are original anyways.
680397	684259	I mean, shit, there's how many World War II first-person shooter games out there?
684779	685760	I mean, seriously.
685960	690042	And if I were to compare Halo 3 to Resistance, I mean, it looks...
690913	692613	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
720600	723242	and they're expecting this to be this big holiday seller.
724243	725384	I don't think it's going to happen.
725404	731469	I mean, maybe Unreal Tournament 3, but then again, no, that's another first-person shooter game.
731549	734872	I mean, nothing's original nowadays.
734952	736874	It's very hard to make an original game.
736914	740737	Well, we'll withhold that final judgment until the game is actually released and you get a chance to play it.
740757	741437	That's fine.
741538	743059	I'm not going to buy it, but you know what?
744093	748618	If you want to buy it, and if you like those kind of action-adventure games, then maybe that's something for you.
748678	752402	Maybe that's the game that you've been looking for for the PlayStation 3.
752782	765636	If you're waiting, though, for some of these other games that they keep promising us, but, you know, I'm very disappointed that we don't have Final Fantasy XIII yet, or even a demo of it, as they promised us before, but all this stuff keeps getting pushed back.
766753	767853	I love the bell idea, though.
767873	768974	It's because Sony and they can.
769794	772175	Comments from chat, chat.orange.com.
772235	773656	Rob D would like to say, no, it's not.
773816	776577	It's very hard to get funding for an innovative game because it's a risk.
776637	777237	There's a difference.
779638	780478	So, next email?
780538	781139	Yes, please.
781319	782119	I love the bell idea.
782159	782619	We'll do that.
783520	783960	Next email.
784160	785280	This comes from Osfer.
785981	790382	Dear Rob, yeah, I said Rob, but everyone else can chime in with their opinion if they wish to do so.
790863	793844	You always talk about Final Fantasy XII as such a great game.
793864	794124	Why?
794284	794544	Why?
795049	797570	What's so great about a game that has a boring political storyline?
797910	803592	To me, a great compelling story like Final Fantasy VII and X are what make the games great.
804032	805393	Also, I don't like the battle system.
805413	806833	It's way too much like World of Warcraft.
806853	809154	I prefer the strategic system like in Final Fantasy X.
810231	813034	Speaking of which, Final Fantasy X needs more praise.
813394	818398	For me, it's the best game in the series and one of the few games I have ever pulled an all-nighter on.
818739	818939	Why?
818979	820180	The story is freaking epic.
820681	822362	It's compelled me to keep playing.
822762	825705	I also love the battle system and don't really mind the random battles.
825765	827487	Final Fantasy X too wasn't that bad either.
827807	832031	People just need to quit complaining about Yuna singing, which I think is really good.
832811	834613	A Thousand Words is an amazing song.
836542	839887	The only thing that made me sad is that Final Fantasy X-2 lacks summons, but oh well.
840108	841109	Thanks for reading, Osfer.
841690	843873	Yeah, I agree.
843893	846597	XII actually is one of the Final Fantasy games I have not played.
847879	850964	I just have no... It doesn't...
851670	852090	I don't know.
852190	853130	It just doesn't do it.
881818	886085	What I've gone through with the stories so far, I actually like political stories.
886205	887467	I love things that make you think.
888729	894058	You know, and maybe, I don't know if that, I'm not trying to be rude or anything, but sometimes people don't like...
894724	895384	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
919039	925323	But my problem with Final Fantasy VIII is that the battles and the whole like junctioning magic and all that shit ruined the game for me.
925403	926344	Single-handedly ruined the game.
926364	927484	Could not stand the battle system in VIII.
927745	928245	Couldn't stand it.
930166	931067	So I didn't want to play through it.
932850	934111	I kind of liked the junctioning.
934291	938794	I mean, I really, really liked having to draw your spells.
938814	939734	Oh, drawing magic.
939874	940775	Oh, it hits a nerve.
940855	941415	I liked it.
941455	942136	I couldn't stand it.
942536	943497	I liked that part of it.
944017	949340	But by the time I got to the third disc and was trying to put together my weapons and shit, I was like, bored now!
950061	951722	So I watched someone else beat it and didn't have to.
953042	954944	I'd already gotten all the other cool cutscenes anyway.
955084	956865	That's what I said before I got to the end of the first disc.
956905	957205	I'm like, ugh.
958326	959787	The second just had some cool crap in it.
959807	962028	It had the Ultimecia battles and all that.
963427	965708	I don't really like when the monsters level with you either.
966129	966749	I don't know.
966769	968050	That kind of thing bugs me.
968070	968510	I don't know why.
968530	973053	I like being able to go to so and such area and knowing what to expect.
974334	974614	You know.
975574	976075	But then again.
977296	979797	This next email, if we are ready.
980978	982319	It's from Rob with two B's.
983739	984980	Oh, I haven't heard from him in a while.
985240	986001	Hooray for Rob with two B's.
986021	991864	Well, he sends us a few stories, but... And sometimes we try to work them into the show role, but, you know.
992005	992505	Oh, here we go.
993206	994046	I think that was the name.
1017364	1018545	No, I kind of agree.
1018685	1022687	I mean, let's just say I did not jump up and want to spend $10 on this game.
1023147	1024208	I mean, I just, I don't know.
1024888	1025229	You're right.
1026149	1030992	It's like all the parts are there, but the whole they'd add up to, it's just eh.
1031432	1039677	It's like when you look at $10, you know, spending on that game and you're saying, hmm, look, Rez HD's coming out at some point and Ikaruga and all that stuff.
1039717	1039937	It's like...
1041155	1044057	Ikaruga Yeah, I don't know if I want to spend $10 on this one.
1044097	1046318	I can buy that for probably about $10 as well.
1046458	1047598	That's a damn fine point.
1049679	1049999	That's it.
1050400	1053781	Ikaruga Next email, shall I?
1054822	1055282	You shall.
1055522	1061665	Dear Our Lady of the Rosary, OLR, Video Game Missionaries, Howdy, I have two questions for you fine people.
1062886	1063366	I don't know.
1063506	1064347	Someone be creative.
1064827	1065047	Huh.
1065507	1066468	That is certainly creative.
1067828	1069069	I beat the ferret in your honor.
1070419	1071379	and a ferret liked it.
1072480	1071379	1.
1073240	1084345	I once had a PS2, the original bigger kind, but it was getting a little spotty on playing some games and I wanted a GameCube anyway, so a couple years ago I traded it in, but now I miss the Silent Hill games, never finished 2.
1084925	1085886	Why haven't you finished 2?
1086306	1087487	It's the shortest one!
1088007	1088267	Anyway.
1088937	1091820	But I've been getting all nostalgic when you guys talk about them.
1092260	1098346	And I want to play Final Fantasy XII, so I'm going to buy a used one online with some birthday money.
1098426	1103850	However, I'll be getting a slim PS2, and I remember reading something about the slims getting too hot and frying the unit.
1104291	1112138	My question is, do I have to worry about this with used slash refurb PS2s, or have all the units in question been recalled or fixed at the time of refurbishment?
1112748	1117532	If I do have to worry about this, is there some way I can tell if the unit I get is one of the models prone to overheating?
1117912	1123716	That I personally do not know because I actually have our first PS2 still, and it works just fine.
1124537	1129240	And on top of that, I have a first model Japanese PS2 that works just fine, which is an oddity.
1130101	1130521	You know what?
1130721	1131242	Here's the thing.
1131502	1137586	Any system is going to have some faulty ones, but you can take steps in making sure that the system is not going to fry itself.
1137646	1139628	Not buying it on eBay.
1139748	1140789	Don't put it in an oven.
1141500	1143941	Make sure it's in a well-ventilated place.
1144021	1144941	Don't put it in a box.
1145221	1146922	Take care of it when you move it around.
1147482	1161346	A suggestion I do have that came back from the Dreamcast days is if you have carpet or anything, put a flat surface down like a cutting board or something and then set your system on top of that.
1161886	1170969	And that way it'll be elevated so that the vents, if the vents are underneath it, can get some... You're like the Martha Stewart of gaming.
1172057	1175118	Well, the Dreamcast did have a problem with getting a little too hot.
1175218	1176018	Without the jail time.
1177179	1178139	And without the bad hair.
1179540	1181160	And without the fruits of the garden.
1181640	1183481	No, my Slim PS2 works just fine.
1183501	1187763	I did not buy an American PS2 until the Slims were out.
1187843	1190183	I only had a Japanese PlayStation 2 for the longest time.
1191464	1194985	And I finally bought a US one when the Slims came out.
1195585	1196826	And it works just fine for me still.
1197946	1200347	So for whatever it's worth, there you have it.
1201587	1202268	Shall I move forward?
1202328	1202748	You shall.
1203549	1203809	Yay.
1203989	1206071	Oh, the second question by this person.
1206672	1211316	One of my favorite games ever is Pokemon Snap, and I've been hoping for years they'd make a sequel, but to no avail.
1211916	1214639	Are there any other good photography... I know, I was just thinking that.
1215019	1218342	Any other good photography-themed games out there that you would recommend?
1218442	1226889	I know Metal Gear Solid 2 had a camera, and some of the Zelda games had minigames, but other than that, I don't know anything, especially with photography figures in largely.
1226949	1227610	Keep on rocking.
1227670	1228110	Ciao.
1228250	1228631	Atreyu.
1229221	1232204	I highly recommend... What's with Atreyu tonight?
1232284	1234366	Atreyu!
1234406	1234806	Wow.
1235367	1236988	Say my name, Bastion.
1237028	1237228	What?
1237389	1241452	I highly recommend Bioshock because you have to take pictures of dead bodies.
1241472	1242173	Dead Rising.
1243534	1243914	Dead Rising.
1243954	1245436	Dead Rising, an awesome photography mode.
1245576	1246096	Good point.
1246457	1250961	Eternal Sonata, actually... Don't get the cardcaptor Sakura game on Dreamcast.
1251664	1253366	Eternal Sonata actually has a photographer.
1253406	1258670	One of the characters, their special move, they can take photos and you can control what's taken a picture of.
1258911	1260692	And you can sell the photos at shops.
1260812	1262394	And the better the picture, the more they sell for.
1262454	1263014	Here's the thing.
1263355	1266838	It's actually one of the things I should have said was one of my kind of complaints about the game.
1267258	1269340	It totally throws the game off balance.
1269700	1274605	Like weapons and things in the part of the game I'm in are like 800 gold, 1,000 gold maybe.
1274945	1276947	You can sell one picture for 14,000 gold.
1279382	1283705	Gold is not a factor in this game if you just take ten pictures and sell them all.
1283845	1285786	I mean, they don't even have to be that good of pictures.
1286147	1293251	That's one other little bitch I have about Eternal Sonata, is that I think somebody threw the photo system way out of whack in testing.
1294172	1294712	Next email?
1294912	1295093	Yep.
1296133	1299155	I'm not certain, but I believe this is the same... Okay, this is something else from Rob.
1299696	1303638	About the man who died after three days straight in the internet cafe in China.
1304179	1305880	The game he played was Online Bridge.
1307102	1313528	How unexciting, but it shows that it's self-neglect from obsession, not an MMO or other game.
1314409	1315169	Good point.
1315189	1318052	Because most of us automatically think, oh, he was playing Warcraft.
1318432	1319333	No, he was playing Bridge.
1319614	1322296	It's these people who do online poker or some shit.
1322316	1322997	It's Final Fantasy XI.
1323017	1323737	It was Evercrack.
1323938	1325259	Evercrack takes another soul.
1325719	1326960	Nope, it was online Bridge.
1327301	1328422	Hoyle is deadly.
1331765	1332505	So shall I keep going?
1332786	1333126	You shall.
1333880	1345452	Dear OLR, I recently joined a game rental service and decided to rent out Earth Defense Force, although it was the PS2 version since I don't have a 360, to find out whether Loki's claims were accurate or not, and they are, sort of.
1345852	1346573	The game is fun.
1346633	1347334	It is really fun.
1347354	1355022	Destroying armies of ants, sorry, gigantors, is supremely satisfying, and the way that you can mold the battlegrounds by destroying the infected city is genius.
1355697	1363820	The variation in weapon types gives the game an element of strategy and all loads extremely quickly, very useful on some difficulty levels.
1363980	1367101	I forgot I played more of Earth Defense Force this week as well.
1368262	1371283	Maybe you're just so used to it that it just blends in with the rest of your schedule.
1371463	1371783	Yeah.
1372589	1381412	The game's budget nature is very obvious from the horrible color scheme that makes some levels look like big piles of sludge to the plot, which is basic to say the least.
1381953	1388635	It's common to find the alien invaders trapped in the scenery, while the variations in enemy types are small and uninteresting visually.
1388955	1395318	There are some that fly, some that shoot suspicious looking brown stuff from their bottoms, but in the end they're all ants.
1395965	1400289	Whether these problems are dealt with in the sequel, I don't know, but they don't detract from the game too much.
1400609	1404593	Put simply, the game is a grand version of squashing armies of ants like I did when I was a kid.
1404873	1406535	The squashing ants never seems to get old.
1406735	1407295	The Afro guy.
1410919	1412580	I still have yet to play Earth Defense Force.
1412600	1413521	I'm going to have to check it out.
1413581	1422389	I'm telling you, they need, and there's another story we're going to get to later, they need to bring out the other PlayStation 2 games and
1422964	1426626	Convert them over to be able to be played on some of these systems over here.
1428427	1435011	Seriously, all the games have been almost exactly the same, just different locations and stuff, but I don't think they get old at all.
1435271	1440414	It's still a very scary thought to me that our reviews and suggestions on games actually influence people.
1440434	1441775	It's kind of scary.
1442636	1446618	Well, speaking of someone wanting some influence, we got an email from the doctor!
1447258	1448319	Alright, hooray!
1448359	1449240	I love the doctor!
1450861	1451641	So, I'm going to read it.
1452324	1454204	I saw the Dalek the other night too.
1454244	1455285	Yes, I have the remote controlled Dalek.
1481428	1482268	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1509482	1509562	Good.
1535339	1542941	Fans of Drum Mania or Keyboard Mania will notice this first, as those two games let you hit as many extra notes as you wanted to without penalizing you, and therefore let you improvise a bit.
1543261	1547242	In Rock Band, you can't improvise until you're told to, except sometimes on vocals.
1548903	1553444	Second, the drum pedal on the pre-release units works just like in Arcade Drum Mania.
1553504	1559986	It's big, has a long throw and relatively little resistance, and it triggers somewhere near the end of its throw, but not all the way at the end.
1560046	1561586	No quick bass rolls with your toes here.
1562580	1567643	Third, the drum pedals connect to the main unit by a 1.8 inch mono phone plugs.
1568043	1569804	Basically the mono headphone jack.
1570724	1572545	These work electrically like I think they do.
1572865	1579269	You should be able to wire two of them in parallel using a mono headphone splitter and make a double bass so that you can be the god of thunder.
1580209	1583911	I asked a Harmonix dev about this and he said he will try it at the office and get back to me.
1584392	1585532	Fourth, Byrite sucks.
1586573	1587073	Yes, they do.
1587759	1592343	Fifth, there is a crazy advanced lag compensation tool built in case your TV internally desyncs audio and video.
1592363	1592824	I love harmonics.
1610805	1613987	Lastly, the new guitar buttons and switches feel very solid and responsive.
1614327	1620070	This drum bar is a bit longer now and does not use clicking micro switches, but still seems to be pretty accurate.
1620190	1624833	I have experimentally verified that it works well played behind your head and between your legs.
1625493	1627915	Looking forward to your next show tonight, Warrior Bob.
1628655	1632877	Yeah, see, mine must have been busted from constant use or something.
1633318	1634218	Someone must have broke it.
1634298	1639201	Who knows what kind of drunk middle-aged people were playing it.
1640091	1643474	at the event that I went to, but it's fun.
1645495	1645996	Sounds like fun.
1646196	1646876	Is that it for email?
1647157	1648257	That be all, sir.
1648678	1649799	Bye, email bag.
1649959	1650519	Send us more.
1650579	1651740	Mailbag at orangeonestradio.com.
1651760	1652841	You know what we have missed, though?
1653081	1653301	What?
1653381	1654002	Talk Like a Pirate Day?
1654022	1654682	Talk Like a Pirate Day.
1654702	1657865	Because you said R. I was like, did you celebrate?
1658045	1662008	I did by making a one-line comment in my live journal.
1662572	1664273	Oh, it was Talk Like a Pirate Day.
1664293	1664913	I was off that day.
1664933	1668794	So I made like a pirate and slept in my cabin.
1668915	1670615	I was doing other pirate related things.
1671716	1673776	I was pirating comic books.
1674217	1678038	I sent an email to all my coworkers with something from I Can Ask Cheeseburger.
1678838	1683260	I said, you better have a good and productive work day today or else I'm going to send you to the captain.
1683660	1684581	It was Talk Like a Pirate Day.
1684961	1688302	It was a little kitty that had a little hook and a pirate hat on.
1688682	1689523	I know that picture.
1689543	1690523	It said something like,
1690743	1691543	I can have booty.
1691743	1694205	Or no, it said something like, why are you laughing?
1694245	1694865	Walk plank.
1694905	1696466	Or I said walk plank or something like that.
1696486	1697046	It's really funny.
1697126	1698046	So I sent that to my coworkers.
1698306	1699107	That's all I celebrated.
1699867	1700487	Yeah, I'm lame.
1700567	1700867	Shut up.
1703148	1703788	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1725399	1731961	Now, I know I'm not supposed to show Jamie on the cam, and I won't, but I can show that she gets a fancy little blue chair to sit on.
1732302	1734782	So you can see, like, I'm showing her feet on the footstool.
1735723	1738124	You can see this fancy little chair that she gets to sit in.
1738684	1743706	And that's why Loki has to take the crappy chair, because the woman took the nice chair, I guess.
1744646	1745306	That's how it goes.
1746066	1746567	So there you have it.
1748347	1748647	Anyhow.
1751428	1752909	Moving on to another story.
1753422	1754584	Project Gotham Racing 4 Demo
1768374	1772277	and it's going to have content I guess that's exclusive to the demo itself.
1772757	1778200	In fact, I guess there's supposed to be some electric versus gas engine race that they're going to be doing.
1778760	1784684	There's also going to be arcade mode, which is going to be exclusive to it, set in Macau, I guess.
1785144	1785645	Macau.
1786465	1788987	And it's going to feature exclusive challenges.
1789507	1791588	So I guess that's kind of neat that it's going to have that.
1793729	1795971	They're also going to feature a time trial for...
1797623	1800405	Looks like Nurburgrin Snow.
1801405	1803387	And it's... Yeah.
1803727	1806969	It says it's due out... Well, the game I know is due out, like, in what?
1807969	1808490	Two weeks?
1809090	1811771	So the demo's gotta be coming out here pretty soon, I'd imagine.
1812032	1814893	It's kind of weird that the demo would have, like, something special.
1816374	1822878	Maybe... It would be kind of cool if, like, whatever content was in the demo, you could get in the game because you downloaded the demo.
1823118	1824199	Like, some type of, like, unlock.
1824219	1824459	I don't know.
1824479	1825960	Well, it's just like what they did with, um...
1827163	1828104	NINJAGATING SIGMA
1841816	1848341	One thing on the Xbox 360 that some folks were doing on Talk Like a Pirate Day was doing some piracy of their own.
1848401	1851203	And it was leaking Halo 3 onto the internet.
1851684	1852424	Yes, that's right.
1852464	1856548	Halo 3 made its way to some Wares sites.
1856888	1859490	6.14 gigabytes is how big the game clocks in as.
1860671	1870018	And of course, you know, kind of sucks that people are doing this and taking away from the folks that have spent so much hard time and effort developing the game.
1870438	1871319	But at the same time,
1872193	1873494	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1898826	1900227	Where it's undetectable.
1900347	1901528	I think all of it's done.
1901548	1906971	I mean, it's going to be hard for them to do that because they have some sort of encryption on there.
1906991	1920019	So if that's cracked, then the only other thing is there's a media detector or something like that that detects whether you're playing a CD-R, a DVD-R, a press CD, DVD, etc.
1920939	1927063	And if you can change that, if you can get that to go over so that makes a DVD-R look like a press DVD...
1928055	1928615	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1953683	1954485	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1961454	1965615	Yeah, but when they try to take these things online, won't it kind of screw it up?
1965756	1966836	No.
1967076	1973758	If the system can't tell that it's not an official game, then no, there won't be any problems.
1974018	1981621	It's if you run a special firmware or something that disables that checking, that's when you're going to run into problems.
1981741	1989564	But if the system itself cannot tell that it's a burned copy and you haven't modified it in any way, then...
1990245	1991847	Yeah, you will be able to get away with it.
1993709	1994150	Interesting.
1994831	2005083	All right, well, I imagine, though, it's just a small percentage, a very, very, very small percentage of people that are able to get away with this, and the game will still sell like hotcakes the day it was released.
2005123	2006185	Yeah, they're going to make tons of money.
2006345	2007326	That's not a problem.
2008137	2012100	And besides, the people that are pirating it probably had no intention of buying it in the first place.
2012240	2015042	And Loki, you did not get banned for playing Halo 3 early, right?
2015242	2016083	No, I did not.
2016483	2021908	The only thing, here's the only thing that they did do is the matchmaking servers aren't up, so you can't play online.
2022968	2023369	Oh, noes.
2023889	2025290	Well, right now, until they start them.
2026091	2026291	Well...
2027930	2033613	Something that you can play online on Xbox Live is Viva Pinata Party.
2033773	2034673	The demo is up.
2035734	2037635	No, Viva Pinata Party Animals is up.
2037675	2038015	I'm sorry.
2038675	2042297	It's 971.17 megabytes.
2044258	2047620	It's basically a big minigame compilation, and it's, of course, by Rare.
2048300	2056384	So the official game is going to be out by Christmas with over 40 minigames, and you can burp boats down a stream.
2057856	2059018	and Smash Up Gardens.
2061481	2063303	Burping Boats is just so much fun, you know.
2064024	2067928	I think it's a racing game mixed with mini-games.
2069270	2073175	Escapist in our chatroom asks, will someone be proposing on that one as well?
2073235	2074737	You know, funny story.
2075766	2076967	and DarkSakura.com.
2098339	2099540	www.DarkSakura.com
2117828	2127770	Really wanted to do an interview on iChat, and unfortunately the way we're wired, where we have the Mac laptop does our Operator 11 stuff, and the PC does most of the audio here, it just wouldn't work for me to do iChat.
2128050	2130771	But I'm hoping we can call him this week and get him on the show next week.
2131011	2135392	So if you're listening, Mr. Pinata, let's make that interview happen this week.
2136112	2136932	So you can clear the air.
2137812	2140733	I still think it's kind of retarded, but we'll go with that.
2140973	2141973	It's like those people who...
2142631	2148116	Who proposed, though, on the big screens, but that I sort of feel like you're pressuring someone into saying yes.
2149016	2153380	Well, it's just... If it's in a public place like that... But I don't think it was.
2153400	2154040	It was in their home.
2154280	2155542	Well, if it's in their home, that's one thing.
2155562	2157343	Well, we'll find out soon.
2157383	2158604	We're going to ask all the questions.
2158624	2167611	Because part of me kind of goes, is this really big to be on all these different blogs?
2167651	2169493	I mean, this is kind of a private matter in a way.
2170457	2170737	I don't know.
2170757	2171097	We'll see.
2171437	2171797	We'll see.
2171897	2172898	We'll get our questions answered.
2173418	2173938	I'm excited.
2175318	2176699	Back to the gaming news then.
2177739	2177959	Yes.
2179779	2187601	Anyways, one thing I'm excited about, as I hinted before, the Simple series is possibly coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
2188782	2194023	According to some digging done during Tokyo Game Show,
2194848	2199512	The Simple 2000 series, which of course brought us wonderful games, much like Earth Defense Force.
2201574	2209681	They're talking about releasing some of them on, of course, the online service, and possibly also the PlayStation Network as well.
2210422	2220151	And according to Kotaku's article here, it says they're asking about the possibility of the series turning up as downloadable titles, and they said that...
2221656	2225941	They had two cheap, easy games coming out on Xbox Live Arcade soon.
2226581	2230666	So, maybe we'll see some more stuff from that series come over.
2230866	2232067	I hope they port some of that stuff.
2232568	2237313	Because there was some weird shit over there, like Zombies vs. Abulences.
2237493	2240436	Awesome.
2241217	2241757	Gotta love it.
2243099	2243339	Well...
2244372	2245293	You gotta love this too.
2245353	2246633	I know Loki loves this.
2247013	2247934	Lesbians!
2248694	2250735	I do love me some lesbians.
2250755	2252556	Then you'll definitely want to pick up Mass Effect.
2252816	2253736	I was already gonna pick it up.
2253756	2254777	It's like the icing on the cake.
2255586	2267689	Well, apparently, Mass Effect has been causing some waves in the gaming blogs and the gaming news sites this week because, apparently, if you play as a female character, there is a sex scene that you can initiate in the game.
2268089	2274050	And you can initiate this scene between her and a male human or a female humanoid alien.
2274130	2277231	So you get some female-on-female action.
2277811	2278691	But here's the thing, though.
2278731	2280492	You can also play as a male character.
2280912	2285093	However, a male character can only initiate sex between him and a human woman.
2285962	2289506	or the humanoid female alien.
2289947	2294211	So, no man sex, but Lesbo's okay.
2294271	2295673	But surprise, butt sex is great.
2297154	2298856	Well, here's another thing, okay?
2299236	2299877	Just a thought.
2300117	2303261	Maybe the storyline, it's between these two women anyways.
2303941	2306564	It's, you know, you either pick one or the other or something like that.
2306644	2308026	Maybe because your character...
2308513	2312075	They didn't make a branching type of storyline or something for this one part.
2312435	2312775	I see.
2312895	2317057	So you're saying this lesbian sex is for artistic and story purposes.
2317277	2319919	It's like the character in the game or something.
2320919	2328003	For example, wasn't there something in Knights of the Old Republic or Jade Empire or something like that where they had something similar?
2328423	2330924	I think it was Knights of the Old Republic 2 or maybe the first one.
2331739	2332860	www.DarkSakura.com
2371516	2372917	DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?
2373137	2376179	I know lack of gay sex makes you mad.
2377340	2378320	Well, yeah.
2378981	2386725	But F you to male drivers, especially stupid old men, and men who drive big trucks and SUVs.
2387826	2391288	Every last bad driver I've encountered on the road has been male.
2392489	2401234	First of all, when I was picking up Dan from the airport yesterday, there was a guy driving an Altima, and he was drifting into my lane.
2402182	2430947	and I didn't know if he was just changing lanes without signaling or if he was just old and stupid he seemed to lean about middle age but he almost bumped me off the road until I banged on the horn and his wife shook him awake he couldn't have been more than 50 so he wasn't that old but I was like, he's a stupid man and then this guy driving a truck cutting off everybody in front of him just being an asshole driver
2431345	2436507	Which I consider being an asshole driver is pretty much equivalent with being a bad driver.
2436527	2439748	Because you're supposed to maintain your cool and calm on the road.
2440168	2443349	And if you do get angry, you're not supposed to let it affect how you drive.
2443669	2445890	This guy was cutting off everybody left and right.
2445950	2449791	He made one car swerve, and I did thankfully get to see him pull over.
2449851	2453472	I know, I was going to say, I saw an asshole driver get pulled over this week, and it was very satisfying.
2454289	2460532	And then, um, you know, I saw so many people just changing lanes without signaling and almost causing accidents.
2460652	2462612	And you know, every last one of them happened to be male.
2464273	2469195	So I would like to point out there that bad drivers are bad drivers regardless of gender.
2469235	2470216	Shut the fuck up.
2471016	2471556	Next, please.
2472977	2473437	Anyways.
2474316	2477678	I didn't really have anything to make an FU for, but now I do.
2478178	2481760	So, yes, once again, women drivers, horrible.
2482100	2485922	In fact, I bet that guy falling asleep is probably falling asleep from nagging from his wife.
2486483	2488344	So, you know, I blame her for that.
2488384	2493947	But, yeah, there are a lot of bad drivers, especially SUV drivers, cell phone drivers.
2494007	2496668	Cell phone drivers are even worse than stupid men.
2496688	2498309	And a combination of those as well.
2498409	2501331	So, fuck you to bad drivers, no matter which sex.
2502772	2503532	Mainly women drivers.
2504051	2506672	Hey, cell phone drivers are the worst.
2507292	2507712	Sorry, Rob.
2508833	2509393	Well, that's all right.
2509433	2511874	I have my Bluetooth now, so it doesn't matter.
2512094	2512894	Yes.
2513935	2516756	Although I never got in an accident while talking in the phone and driving.
2516776	2518336	It's an urban legend.
2519637	2521937	It's made up, just like how man actually went to the moon.
2521977	2524498	It's all made up, those cell phones.
2524558	2525238	What was I going to say?
2525359	2532221	I don't really have a whole lot of FUs, so I'll just say, I don't know.
2533434	2535735	FU to lack of angst this week.
2535775	2536835	I'm actually in a pretty good mood.
2537235	2539456	FU to the million and one projects I have at work.
2539937	2541317	I have so many projects at work.
2541357	2542377	I'm all project out.
2542998	2544678	Projects are work of the devil.
2544898	2545699	I have too many of them.
2546759	2547139	That's it.
2547559	2548820	A rather tame FU this week.
2550060	2550661	So there you have it.
2550781	2553001	Another successful FUs of the week segment.
2553121	2555282	I have one last thing I was just going to add in there real quick.
2555362	2555862	Oh lordy.
2556283	2562065	FU to the Halo 3 launch because I fucking hate having to deal with customers asking about when they're going to get Halo 3.
2563643	2564945	You get it when it's good and ready.
2565145	2565785	Exactly.
2566226	2567547	That's how you should respond to them, too.
2569229	2570870	Alright, back to some gaming news.
2573653	2581821	Well, anyone who is interested in watching movies and things on Xbox Live will be happy.
2581981	2583182	That's an anime fan, at least.
2583680	2584940	We'll be happy to know that S.T.A.R.S.
2584980	2586721	is bringing different shows.
2587221	2596745	We are getting Ghost in the Shell, Standalone Complex, Both Seasons, Street Fighter 2V, Noyan, Toko, Virus, and Astro Boy.
2598125	2599666	There's actually a bunch more.
2601246	2605848	Some of the other ones that were listed is...
2608157	2618146	Well, at least they have particular access to was like Blood the Last Vampire, A Different Loop in the Third, Appleseed, Blood the Last Vampire, Ninja Scroll, Perfect Blue.
2618226	2618987	I love Perfect Blue.
2620888	2621889	Just different series.
2624271	2626533	I haven't seen a single one of those series you mentioned.
2626653	2629736	Perfect Blue was like, oh my god, head trip.
2630216	2631317	I've seen it twice in the theater.
2631938	2632759	Perfect Blue was weird.
2633119	2634240	Perfect Blue was awesome.
2635449	2641973	Anyway, some people are not so happy about NHL 2K8 charging you $5 to unlock a feature that's already on the game.
2642813	2654939	This feature, of course, is actually the 2K ReelMaker add-on, and it will allow you to do a variety of video recording and playback options for the game.
2655860	2663984	But the download was a Puny 108K, which means that you're just paying for an unlock key for something that's already on the disc.
2665458	2666439	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2683465	2684306	Eternalsonata Eternalsonata
2709901	2716773	There's, I mean, sports games, you know, you play over and over and over again in little bursts, but a game like Eternal Sonata is really meant to be played start to finish.
2717194	2719498	So what good does this, I don't know, it doesn't make sense.
2720539	2723204	They're just hoping for people to buy these things at a push of a button.
2725040	2731644	What does make a little more sense is buying things that were not included with the original game, such as new outfits.
2732345	2736988	And this is pretty interesting, is that Bomberman Live is going to be getting a new download pack.
2737008	2739289	Actually, I believe it's already up, this new download pack they have.
2739870	2747214	One of the characters that's in the download pack is based off of the mascot from Destructoid.com, which of course is another gaming blog.
2747234	2750076	We had some of those guys on our year-end show a while ago.
2750736	2751877	We'll have to have them back sometime.
2751917	2760165	But yeah, they've crossed over from gaming press blog site into video game character with their little mascot, that green little robot face thing.
2761106	2763628	Actually, I thought it was silver in some of the pictures I've seen, but whatever.
2763989	2771876	Color be damned, the little mascot has certainly made a name for itself now by crossing over into a OMG legitimate video game.
2774108	2778129	So where's the giant Loki head for future expansions?
2778169	2783271	Well, people would argue that it would have to be a Tingle head because they're fascinated with the character Tingle.
2783751	2785972	I do not understand this, but whatever.
2785992	2788833	Then that wouldn't work because you're crossing over Nintendo.
2788853	2792054	Then they would say, well, he should be in Super Smash Bros.
2792114	2794535	Brawl as Tingle, dressed up as Tingle.
2794575	2795275	Yeah, there you go.
2795415	2797196	That's an awesome idea.
2797256	2798436	Why don't we make that happen?
2798496	2799036	No, just kidding.
2799076	2799917	No, it's not an awesome idea.
2799937	2801997	That's like mixing the matter with antimatter.
2802258	2802618	I don't know.
2804059	2809082	Escapist in our chatroom asks, if Destructoid can do it, why not Bomberman based on the OLR staff?
2809142	2810803	Well, that's a very nice thought.
2811183	2814665	I'm sure, A, Destructoid gets like a million more hits in a month than we do.
2814925	2817226	We're just a tiny little show in somebody's spare bedroom.
2818047	2820848	Whereas Destructoid is like, they've come a long way.
2820868	2822349	They've only been around, what, like a year and a half?
2822369	2823029	They've come a long way.
2825451	2833435	B, I seem to recall that a couple weeks ago, I don't know if it was their E3 coverage, or they had some coverage of some expo that was sponsored by...
2835121	2852681	and they had like ads all over their site so they had some type of relationship going on with the folks that made Bomberman so you know that's kind of cool though I'm not knocking it I think it's awesome what happened and I love the fact that the Microsoft community as a whole is really seeming to embrace the community more and more
2853810	2860152	Some of our other buddy podcasts, such as the Gamerscore blog and Gamertag Radio.
2860172	2862133	What are all those guys called together?
2862233	2862813	Gamercast.
2863214	2865354	They all have their own pictures up on the marketplace.
2865374	2865995	That's pretty rad.
2866715	2868015	Hopefully we'll see more of those very soon.
2868315	2868495	Yes.
2870656	2872697	Anyhow, back to the gaming news.
2876618	2881080	Well, something that should interest a few people, especially that are mobile phone gamers...
2882301	2889925	Coming out will be Rockman Dash, which is one of the Mega Man Legends series.
2890345	2894848	It's a new Rockman Dash game, and those fuckers didn't put it on a damn console that I can play.
2895448	2896849	Cell phones do not need more games.
2896909	2898369	I hate the Mega Man Legends games.
2900030	2911176	There's also Resident Evil 4 Mobile Edition, Devil May Cry, Dante vs. Virgil, Sengoku Basara, Tactical RPG, and Breath of Fire 4.
2913186	2915007	I wouldn't mind having Breath of Fire 4 on my phone.
2916567	2918568	But anyway, that's all Japanese only right now.
2920469	2921830	Yeah, but it's mobile phone, so who cares?
2922890	2923190	I care.
2923570	2924751	I play Luminous on my phone.
2924971	2925291	Really?
2925511	2925711	Yes.
2926231	2926511	Really?
2927732	2928032	Why?
2928872	2933394	Because, first of all, I can sneak around outside at work and play it.
2934255	2935395	And it's actually not too bad.
2935595	2938096	Actually, I enjoy Luminous on mobile phones too, I have to be honest.
2938476	2939577	I'm going to load it up right now.
2940057	2940857	I'm playing during a show.
2940877	2942398	Well, you have fun with that, Miss Thing.
2942578	2942758	I will.
2944051	2954277	Anyways, so, maybe you're looking to find that special someone to eventually proclaim your love over Viva Pinata 2.
2955297	2956118	Well, fear not.
2956958	2966804	We're here to help you, and thanks to the Sexy Video Game Land blog, they have compiled a list of what they think are... What a great blog name, by the way, might I add.
2967204	2970406	The best video game pickup lines.
2971206	2972327	Here are some to...
2975620	2976460	What do you say?
2976880	2978981	I take my flag to your base and score.
2980021	2982161	So, you ever been in a five man raid?
2983922	2987323	Hey baby, I need a new hoe and it ain't for gardening.
2988383	2989984	How does that have anything to do with video games?
2990044	2990864	It's Harvest Moon.
2991384	2992024	Oh god.
2992084	2993184	That's so stupid.
2993705	2998426	Let me call you Silent Hill because things really get freaky when I'm inside you.
2999958	3003140	I know how Mario must feel because I really want to clean your pipes.
3004820	3006781	Call me Ash because I choose you.
3009382	3010863	There's a warp zone in my pants.
3012604	3013264	I made that one up.
3013544	3014165	Oh, let's see.
3014505	3015865	You're just like an RPG.
3015925	3021748	I can't wait to take you home, unwrap you, put it in, and then grind all the way until sun rises.
3022969	3024970	Girl, you got me like WarioWare.
3025130	3025730	I'm touched.
3026601	3027561	That's stupid.
3027821	3031563	You can't be Phoenix Wright because I have no objection to you, baby.
3033063	3033443	Okay.
3033663	3034904	Those are awful.
3035764	3039445	If you're a devil, you may cry by the time I'm finished with you.
3040846	3042486	You remind me of a game of Tetris.
3043067	3045848	You always want the long ones.
3048028	3048368	What?
3048388	3050049	That doesn't even make sense.
3050089	3051450	That's stupid.
3051650	3055551	Hey, baby, can I hide my solid snake in your box?
3058015	3059476	That makes me want to throw up a little.
3060257	3061698	I think I did just throw up in my mouth.
3063039	3064980	Now see, our chat room's joining in now.
3065020	3066361	Did you throw up in your stomach, Rob?
3066821	3067062	Huh?
3067382	3068943	Did you throw up in your stomach?
3069203	3069583	Shut up.
3070224	3072165	DJ Dark Knight says, Back me wool, baby.
3072766	3074327	That's an old OLR joke.
3074767	3078910	Ranma says, Hey baby, how about I dance dance to your revolution and you beat my mania?
3081152	3081472	Okay.
3081872	3085415	GS68 says, You must play 2DX because you've got me on hard mode.
3087018	3087598	I like that one.
3087618	3088198	That one's funny.
3089680	3091721	Warrior Bob says, you remind me of Tetris.
3091801	3093042	I just want to make you disappear.
3093143	3094584	I mean, wait, have sex with me.
3096785	3097306	I like that one.
3097406	3102050	You know, my favorite pickup line was always, hi, I like peanut butter.
3102070	3102570	Want to fuck?
3102850	3103611	Or how about this one?
3103971	3107374	Babe, you're hotter than my first edition 360s power supply.
3108495	3109236	That's lame.
3109596	3110397	Stupid.
3111017	3111437	Wow.
3113119	3113379	Lame.
3114622	3117584	Baby, you can screw attack me all night long.
3119826	3123288	Anyhow, Drew Nami says, you must play Tetris because you're stacked.
3124349	3125630	That one's actually kind of good.
3126150	3126570	Not bad.
3126630	3128311	Drew Nami has a funny joke once in a while.
3128652	3129552	All right, moving on.
3129612	3130533	Add it to the toilet paper.
3130553	3132334	For the love of God, a new story, please.
3133035	3136397	From Video Game Pickup Lines, from what was that, Sexy Game Blog?
3136417	3136877	What was that called?
3136917	3138098	Sexy Game Land Blog.
3138118	3139439	Sexy Game Land Blog, nice.
3140180	3142121	Moving on to something completely different.
3142751	3145932	I don't keep up with too many Republicans.
3164978	3173602	So imagine the irony and hilarity when you notice the Mitt Romney ad campaign ads start showing up on GameTrailers.com.
3174142	3174602	That's right.
3175422	3181565	A joystick snapped a picture of a GameTrailers.com site with – and it's not a Photoshop thing.
3181625	3182325	It's the real deal.
3182365	3186807	It's the GameTrailers little logo there and the Mitt Romney ad right on top of the site.
3187187	3191269	Hilarity that their campaign would be advertising on the site.
3191369	3191629	Now –
3192608	3208141	Let's see, I'm going to go for the obvious here and say that probably they're people or whatever bought into a package deal or some type of advertising company that distributes through all these different websites and game trailers just happens to be one of many.
3208161	3211203	Because doesn't MTV own game trailers, I want to say?
3211804	3212904	Or there's some type of partnership there?
3212944	3214005	I could be wrong, I don't remember.
3214426	3218549	But yeah, there's probably some much bigger thing that just showed up on that site.
3220828	3221488	That's kind of funny.
3221608	3223209	That's karma for you.
3223969	3226189	This is why we don't do banner ads on OrangeLawnTrader.com.
3226209	3227590	This is also why we're poor.
3228530	3229310	I'd just like to point out.
3229590	3231751	But irony for the win in this case.
3232451	3233151	So there you have it.
3234712	3238833	Well, here is a little bit more for anyone who wants.
3239413	3242274	Yakuza 2 is coming out in the U.S.
3243094	3247035	Dinosaur King and Mystery Dungeon is also coming out thanks to Sega!
3248696	3249396	So, um...
3250735	3253456	They are supposed to be coming out in 2008.
3254497	3256097	And I think that's going to be very cool.
3256117	3259759	Because I honestly want... I actually was looking into a little bit on Mystery Dungeon.
3259819	3260799	It's Shiren the Wanderer.
3262300	3266521	Dinosaur King is a game where you collect 100 dinosaurs with different moves and you make them fight.
3267842	3269242	And... Wow.
3270623	3273444	I just want Yakuza 2 so I can go around beating people up.
3274784	3275705	You just like violence.
3276105	3276885	I do like violence.
3276905	3278466	I like beating up people wearing nice suits.
3280916	3281257	All right.
3281797	3283699	Well, those games coming to you very soon from Sega.
3284800	3286923	Also coming to you very soon, the Skype line.
3287303	3293930	You can give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3294030	3295271	We love to be interactive.
3295792	3297434	But one more story for you real quick.
3298595	3300116	Yeah, I like being interactive.
3300177	3300457	All right.
3300777	3301118	Anyways.
3302267	3303907	Okay, enough with the pickup lines, seriously.
3304267	3312609	Although, I have to say this, SSJ100Matt sent me a message and says that there should be a voicemail challenge for people to leave pickup lines on the Skype line voicemail.
3312849	3313809	Do you want some hot coffee?
3314210	3316130	Yeah, so please, I love that idea.
3316230	3324412	So please call, if you give our number a call, either on Skype or the phone number when we're not live, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3324732	3330193	Leave us a message with your sexy video game pickup line and we'll play some of our favorites on next week's show, but I bet you we don't get any.
3330976	3354232	Anyways, in case you had hopes and dreams that that wonderful Halo 3 Legendary Edition game box was actually going to become a brand new helmet for your cat, unfortunately, that will not be the case, because the helmet itself, as IGN found out, is not hollowed and will not fit on your cat.
3356462	3357082	That sucks.
3357463	3360004	Now I can't put the helmet on my cat and watch my cat run into walls?
3360465	3360725	No.
3360905	3364007	But, I mean, with some simple modding, you probably could do that.
3364067	3365168	Oh, wait, I don't own a cat.
3366108	3366709	I own a cat.
3366909	3370271	There's no way a cat would put their head in that anyways.
3370491	3373834	Could we put the helmet on the ferret?
3375615	3376896	Yeah, that would look weird, though.
3377416	3378757	That we might be able to pull off.
3378877	3380818	I bet Shermie's little head would fit in it.
3381118	3382019	She's got a small brain.
3382379	3382960	Are you kidding?
3382980	3384481	Shermie's the fattest cat I've ever seen.
3385041	3386302	But her brain is very small.
3387188	3389611	Cat's aren't dumb enough to put their head in there.
3403223	3422894	Yes, as this is very interesting, well, not for me, but for maybe Rob, apparently if you were looking for some man sex type game or whatever, there's Dual Love, which is going to be coming to the DS, and it includes a part of the game where you scrub down a naked man.
3423454	3423954	Yay!
3424175	3426716	Oh, God, I saw a preview for that on some website.
3426736	3427616	I'm going to scrub down a naked man.
3427656	3428537	No, it looks stupid.
3429689	3430609	Somebody sent me a link to it.
3430629	3431149	It looks stupid.
3431189	3432330	Anyway, we're getting some phone calls.
3432930	3434090	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3434130	3434490	Who's this?
3435250	3436211	Oh, this is Warrior Bob.
3436251	3436991	How's it going, Scott?
3437011	3437751	Hi, Warrior Bob.
3438011	3438391	It's good.
3438431	3438871	How about you?
3439772	3440352	Not too bad.
3440652	3441532	Long time no chat.
3442232	3442812	Yeah, serious.
3443292	3445053	So we read your email about the rock band.
3445493	3445833	Good times?
3445853	3446193	I heard that.
3446253	3446573	Thank you.
3446913	3449214	Loki went down and played it, but I missed out.
3449314	3450554	I totally forgot.
3451374	3452115	Oh, when was he there?
3452555	3452855	Today.
3454295	3455175	Oh, that's why I didn't see you.
3456136	3457676	Were you there like all day or something?
3458001	3462682	I was there most of the day Thursday and Friday because I had a group of friends going and I figured, eh, why not?
3463002	3464683	But you went to the Sac State one, right?
3465263	3465583	That's right.
3465643	3467724	Loki went to the Ribs, what was it, Rib Fest?
3467764	3469184	The Rhythm and Ribs Fest.
3469244	3469984	Rhythm and Ribs.
3471485	3472825	I should have gone to that, I love Ribs.
3473025	3473725	That's awesome.
3473845	3476906	I would have went to the one on Friday but I had to work and unfortunately I only went until 6.
3478087	3483168	Unfortunately a Rib Festival doesn't work very well for someone who's trying to be more vegetarian but what have you.
3483894	3485776	Anyway... I'm unemployed, so Friday was a great day.
3486116	3486677	Ah, gotcha.
3486717	3487838	What would you call in about tonight?
3487858	3488338	What's on your mind?
3488938	3497226	Well, so, I figured it's the first time I've gotten to listen to your show live in a few years, so I'd figure I'll take some of your advice.
3497266	3498407	I've been playing the Guardian Legend.
3498707	3499548	Yay!
3500108	3500549	Awesome.
3500569	3501009	What do you think?
3501730	3506654	Well, it's a lot of fun, and I can't put my finger on it, but what in God's name am I supposed to be doing?
3507635	3508696	Wandering around...
3509565	3520232	You fight things and collect the power-ups, and then you go into the different levels, and the levels are numbered by, like, 1, 21, 2, you know, they back and forth.
3520252	3520873	I think it's 1, 11.
3521633	3523535	Yeah, 1, 11, and your last two levels are 10 and 20.
3524535	3525596	And they are fucking hard.
3527237	3534302	Here's the thing, is that you walk around the Zelda-ish world looking for where the corridors are, and the first few corridors are easy to open up.
3534904	3536726	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3550544	3552725	and they'd give you tips on how to open up the corridors.
3553025	3565811	When you beat the corridors, like 1 through 10, they give you a key, like you'll get a little moon key or you get a little square key or a diamond key and that will allow you to progress to another section of the Zelda world where there are more corridors waiting for you.
3566491	3567532	Well, that makes way more sense.
3567612	3570853	I thought I was supposed to go to like level moon or level plus sign or something.
3571273	3575235	No, no, you find those moons and plus signs in the corridors when you beat them.
3576212	3577492	Yeah, they're different keys.
3577753	3581114	And then the corridors 11 through 20 just give you weapon upgrades and stuff, right?
3581474	3581834	I think so.
3581874	3582054	Yeah.
3582254	3584195	I don't think you get too much other stuff special.
3584515	3587436	Well, you still have to beat every level to progress through it.
3587856	3595539	But the weapons that you get, the one weapon that's going to be your best friend, especially in the last level, is the multi-directional ball.
3596119	3599200	Because you can shoot it up, down, left, right, and diagonals.
3600609	3604332	and the way you beat the last boss is so freaking easy, but everything else is really hard.
3604352	3606573	It isn't way better than GameFAQs.
3607073	3608094	Thank you.
3608134	3611556	But TGL mode, you want to try TGL mode at least once.
3612496	3615898	You go into your password and just put in in all caps TGL.
3617139	3617419	Okay.
3617840	3620221	It's just all the shooting stages back to back.
3620241	3626125	And it gives you your power-ups, however there are ways to get around and get earlier power-ups and other things playing in RPG mode.
3626685	3628426	But TGL mode is definitely for the win.
3629659	3630199	Crazy talk.
3660202	3660502	They are.
3660662	3662242	So where the hell is Lolo in these games?
3662862	3665243	He probably died because, like, everything kills you in that game.
3665823	3666123	Hmm.
3668183	3669844	There was a button that killed you in that game.
3670464	3673864	Escapist said Lolo moonlighted in the first Kirby game then disappeared.
3675505	3675965	That's true.
3676025	3681246	He probably hit the select button or whatever the seppuku button was in Lolo.
3681606	3682306	Those are some tough games.
3682326	3683066	Lolo's seppuku button.
3683866	3684186	That's right.
3684206	3685806	There was Lolo Lo and La La La.
3686026	3687327	Remember his girlfriend La La La?
3687527	3689527	She was the girl because she had a bow in her hair and she was pink.
3690558	3691699	Well, there's the connection.
3691739	3692900	Kirby had King Dedede.
3692940	3697542	It's like you take a syllable and just repeat it a bunch of times.
3697682	3700284	We need a new enemy in this next HAL game.
3700344	3703706	How about King Nanana or King Boo Boo Boo?
3705908	3708149	They let their babies name them, actually, is what they do.
3709470	3712071	Learn your first Japanese character and just write it a bunch of times.
3712131	3712592	That's right.
3712612	3715253	All right, Warrior Bob, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
3716934	3719476	No, I've got an NES plugged in now, so what should I play?
3719980	3720480	See you next time.
3720500	3720720	See ya.
3748752	3750313	I hope Warrior Bob comes back to visit sometime.
3750353	3751353	It was fun having him on the show.
3752113	3753754	And lots of folks in the chat room are chiming in.
3753814	3758816	Tecmo Bowl, Ninja Gaiden, Clue Clue Land, Archon.
3758896	3760576	Ooh, that's a good suggestion, Archon.
3760777	3761537	Clue Clue Land.
3761617	3763558	Oh my god, I played so much of that stupid game.
3764818	3765858	I did an Animal Crossing.
3765878	3766479	We have another call.
3766519	3767559	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3767579	3767899	Who's this?
3769160	3770160	This is Mr. DeBucket.
3770360	3771501	Hello, Mr. DeBucket.
3771641	3772181	What's on your mind?
3772881	3775142	He's going to yell at me for kicking him over the Dreamcast.
3775874	3777295	No, I'm not going to yell at you for that.
3777575	3778696	That's understandable.
3778756	3781298	I know how Dreamcast fans are really defensive.
3782079	3782599	This is true.
3782899	3783720	Well, what's on your mind then?
3784761	3787163	Oh, Metal Gear Solid 4, Metal Gear Solid Online.
3787183	3791246	I wanted to know what you guys thought of them making the game separate from the multiplayer.
3793067	3794368	You know, I don't... Here's the thing.
3794388	3794968	I have to be honest.
3795088	3801593	I don't follow the Metal Gear series too much, but I'm kind of welcoming the idea of an online version.
3801633	3802774	I think that might be a lot of fun.
3803174	3803715	Kind of like this...
3805857	3806838	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3826809	3827429	How do you finish it?
3827489	3832351	As far as I got was I found a dude tied up by some, you know, in the middle of the jungle.
3832391	3833071	I untied him.
3833351	3834071	He runs off.
3834191	3834611	I leave.
3834671	3837412	And then it's just all darkness and fireworks going off.
3837892	3839473	I seriously don't remember.
3839513	3840633	When I rented it, I was like 11.
3840773	3844454	Yeah, every time I went to a new screen, it was all dark.
3844494	3846955	Then fireworks went off and everything was lit up for some reason.
3847075	3850516	And helicopters couldn't see you even though you're standing right next to them.
3850856	3851896	Well, how do you feel about it?
3851916	3853657	Because you must have called this because you had an opinion on it.
3854740	3856121	I think it's an interesting idea.
3856161	3864686	I mean, if you don't like Metal Gear that much, if you really can't get into the single player, the multiplayer aspect, since it's a second game, I'm pretty sure you will be able to buy it separate.
3865027	3866288	You could like that better.
3866448	3868229	And also, they changed the controls.
3868669	3875033	They make them more like Western games or things that a lot of online gamers would get into.
3875073	3882718	Like, now you use R1 to shoot and stuff, kind of like most games do, using the right trigger, the fire, and use L to aim.
3883585	3908048	Yeah, and the Sons of Patriot system, which is a new thing you can do, because normally in a multiplayer game, you know, you can always, like, see your buddies and tell if they died or something like that, or, you know, say, like, this person's name got shot, or, but you can actually see everything that they're doing by, like, at the beginning, every time you begin a match, you all, like, link up, and you can see everybody's stats, and what weapon they have, and what they're exactly doing, so you can go help them out or something, and
3908661	3917008	It's a really cool system, and it's a completely different game, and they're selling it different, but if you do buy Metal Gear Solid 4, you will get a starter pack or something.
3917188	3918029	Yeah, I heard about that.
3918969	3922112	Yeah, and apparently they're going to be making more downloadable content over...
3923108	3924708	The next year's if people still play it.
3925029	3925749	That's cool.
3925829	3928829	And I think what you said is kind of right where I feel.
3928849	3931890	I'm not so excited about Metal Gear Solid 4, but I hear about this online one.
3931910	3932570	I'm like, oh, really?
3933050	3934291	That looks like it could be fun.
3934991	3940192	I don't really follow the story, but just throwing me in the arena and shoot them up looks like a lot of fun.
3940512	3942813	So I definitely will check it out, if nothing else.
3943253	3944913	I may not get so into it, but we'll see.
3946333	3946613	Okay.
3946914	3947194	All right.
3947214	3948634	Anything else you want to share with our listeners today?
3949625	3950125	I appreciate it.
3950285	3951066	Thank you very much.
3951106	3952487	Have a good one, buddy.
3952507	3952607	Bye.
3952627	3952787	Bye-bye.
3971751	3975212	In fact, I think that we should play this, though, in the afterbirth.
3975392	3975712	What's that?
3975732	3977113	If we can find the video of it.
3977193	3977513	I'll try.
3977613	3980854	Of the PlayStation 2 vs. Dreamcast with special guest the VMU.
3982735	3984775	With them arguing over who was better.
3984815	3985135	I'll try.
3985215	3985735	I'll find it.
3985876	3986716	All right, I picked up a call.
3986736	3987416	Let's go to the phones.
3987456	3988276	Hi, you're on Orange Zone Radio.
3988296	3988596	Who's this?
3989417	3990137	Legend of Zaku.
3990917	3991897	Hello, Legend of Zaku.
3991917	3992378	What's on your mind?
3993458	3997119	Nah, just chilling, just getting ready for Digital Life, which is at the end of the week.
3997532	3998692	I'm sorry, I'm not coming.
3998733	4000773	I was looking forward to it, but something else came up.
4000793	4001354	I've been knowing that.
4001434	4002054	It's alright, though.
4002914	4008416	Yeah, just the general stuff within the community.
4008996	4012258	You know, stuff like Metal Gear Solid 4.
4013618	4014819	What the hell are you typing?
4014939	4016419	Hey, are you typing to somebody else?
4016839	4017360	It's our turn.
4017400	4018040	You talk to us.
4018980	4020001	No, I mean Final Fantasy.
4020161	4021641	I mean, you know, all the Halo stuff.
4022482	4023302	All the reviews.
4024192	4030777	All the Halo 3 reviews coming back almost at 100 or something.
4030817	4036821	The general internet says stuff like OMG, they probably got paid off by Microsoft.
4037542	4038703	But yeah, that sort of thing.
4039403	4043886	I'm not really buying into that much hype.
4044106	4046108	What are you most looking forward to about digital life?
4047524	4050385	Um, just the, you know, just the DDR tournament.
4050425	4051886	I'm competing in freestyle on Saturday.
4051906	4053907	Ooh, any hints about your routine?
4053927	4055808	Um, not yet.
4056348	4068053	Um, when you see it up on YouTube, hopefully at that, you know, at that night, you know, the night of the tour, I mean, the night, the day, you know, after the tournament, then you'll see something.
4068113	4070414	But yeah, I'm trying to keep it under wraps.
4070754	4073415	I will be looking for you on the YouTube-age.
4074903	4076244	Yeah, that too.
4076324	4079286	I mean, why else do people DDR freestyle anymore?
4079326	4082248	I mean, it's all about being on YouTube and everybody able to watch your routine.
4083089	4091035	Well, yeah, I mean, freestyle is kind of like a dying art right now because most tournaments don't even have that except for a few exceptions.
4091316	4098441	If they have that whole SingStar thing on the PlayStation 3 where you're going to be able to upload your videos like a karaoke thing, why don't they do that with DDR?
4098541	4099162	That's what I don't get.
4099542	4100663	Microsoft doesn't care.
4101343	4102064	Konami doesn't care.
4102662	4106284	Don't most DDR mixes have some sort of camera support?
4106324	4108525	I know, you know, the PS2 ones had iToy.
4108625	4109025	Exactly.
4109045	4110305	I don't know about 360.
4110425	4112646	So how about just a website you can upload all that to?
4112766	4114087	Come on, it's untapped resource.
4114107	4115828	Konami, I'm giving you free hints here.
4116028	4120230	I don't think Konami's ready to, you know, to drop that much bandwidth on that.
4120310	4123771	I mean, they're taking DDR that far, but, you know, that's about it.
4124231	4124512	All right.
4124992	4127613	Well, what else is on your mind tonight, buddy?
4127653	4132295	Just really go over the whole, you know, the whole Rumble, Sony actually getting it
4132967	4139969	and supposedly taking their quote-unquote last-gen feature and just polishing it up as if it were new.
4141330	4142690	Basically polishing a turd.
4143451	4144171	We all know better.
4145811	4146111	All right.
4146131	4148372	Well, Sakura, I've got to let you go to get more calls, but have a good one.
4148392	4150533	Have fun in digital life and tell everybody we said hi.
4151773	4153734	Tell Don I said hi, and I'm sorry I didn't make it.
4154514	4156255	Yeah, I will.
4156395	4156675	All right.
4156795	4157235	Later, buddy.
4158876	4161217	See, I'm having people relay my personal messages now.
4161757	4162037	All right.
4162257	4162497	Rob.
4162884	4163104	What?
4163384	4164285	I sent you that thing.
4164525	4164746	Yes.
4165506	4167668	Do you want me to play it now or do you want me to play it in the after?
4167708	4168109	Right before.
4169209	4169570	Right now?
4169930	4170410	No, not now.
4170431	4171531	Right before the very end.
4171591	4172212	Okay.
4172853	4173233	You got it.
4174065	4175446	A little treat for our live listeners.
4176306	4177306	Are we going to get any more calls?
4177366	4177646	I don't know.
4177686	4179447	How about some more last-minute stories while we wait for more calls?
4179467	4182729	1-877-GAME-OLR or username OrangeLawsRadio on Skype.
4182949	4183589	Loki, anything else?
4183689	4192512	If you like Owen Dunn or Elite Beat Agents, you'll be happy to know that OSU, the sim for those games, has been released onto the PC.
4193053	4196974	It is available to download and is actually pretty interesting.
4197454	4200536	You can find it at osu.ppy.sh.
4201056	4202597	It's in one of their forum posts there.
4204392	4209234	It's just like playing Owen Dunn, but just with your mouse, which must be insanely difficult.
4209274	4209514	Hold on.
4209534	4210215	We'll talk about that in a minute.
4210235	4210855	We got another call.
4210895	4211836	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4211856	4212196	Who's this?
4213336	4214117	This is Misty.
4214537	4215277	Hi, Misty.
4215357	4216758	How are you, Misty?
4218459	4219099	Up for once.
4219839	4220420	Wow, I know.
4220500	4224001	We never hear from you live on the show, but I'm so happy you were able to call in.
4224361	4225882	OMG, a girl, everybody.
4226302	4226843	OMG.
4228263	4228924	Dot, dot, dot.
4229784	4230864	Well, yeah, but you're always here.
4231385	4231585	All right.
4232617	4234158	What do you think of Cooking Momma?
4264457	4265237	It is addictive.
4265778	4266618	This is very addictive.
4266818	4269139	What kind of foods have you been preparing in Cooking Mama lately?
4271801	4274842	Pretty much so far, the stuff that has retained its Japanese names.
4275482	4275943	Okay.
4276303	4276803	Very cool.
4276843	4277163	Very cool.
4277423	4280065	Is there anything coming out soon on the DS that you're looking forward to?
4282886	4285407	Not really, because I've only been half paying attention.
4286048	4291390	But considering my birthday's coming up, I'm going to start paying more attention at Target.
4292271	4292391	Okay.
4292411	4292591	Okay.
4293072	4294033	and seeing what else is coming out.
4294073	4299236	I don't know, actually, I don't know if there's a whole lot on DS coming out soon to get excited about this year.
4299396	4300337	Zelda Phantom Hourglass?
4300677	4301238	Oh, thank you.
4301398	4302518	I knew I was forgetting something big.
4302538	4303239	It's the week after next.
4303299	4304680	There you go, Zelda Phantom Hourglass.
4304700	4309503	But most of their big stuff for the holidays have already come out, like Brain Age 2 and all that, right?
4310143	4312105	There's Final Fantasy Tactics on the DS.
4312165	4313105	Oh, Final Fantasy 4.
4313266	4315387	A front mission, Revenant Wings.
4315927	4316828	All right, all right.
4316968	4319170	So shoot me for not following the DS so much.
4319290	4319670	My bad.
4319910	4321251	Well, I don't think it's coming out this year, but...
4322424	4325686	Now, folks in the chat room are giving you some advice on DS games to pick up.
4325726	4327887	TheRobD says you need to get Clubhouse games.
4328288	4329969	SonofDad says Planet Puzzle League.
4330009	4330589	That's a good game.
4331810	4336372	Yeah, those two look like ones that I've been considering.
4337133	4347659	And for Clubhouse, I have considered it last night, but I came and got Cookie Mama because I saw that it was only $20, and I was trying to watch my money a little bit.
4348352	4353055	because that GameStop was only my first stop in the mall.
4353075	4354915	I still had a good portion of the mall to go.
4355196	4355436	Right.
4355916	4358577	See, the good deals always went out when they're cheaper.
4359057	4359578	Always went out.
4360058	4362119	Well, Misty, anything else you want to share with our listeners today?
4363980	4366381	Not really anything that I can think of.
4366961	4367222	All right.
4367242	4369963	Well, Misty, thanks so much for calling in, and I'm glad to hear you got through.
4369983	4373365	I know you've been listening to our show forever, and it's always good to listen to you live.
4373425	4373725	All right?
4374905	4375306	All right.
4375486	4375666	All right.
4375686	4376126	Have a good one.
4377421	4377641	You too.
4377681	4377821	Bye-bye.
4377841	4378402	Hey, no moleste.
4378422	4379743	This is.
4379763	4380203	How's it going?
4406881	4418672	I went into the chat room, I was playing my puzzle quest, and I went onto the website, and so I decided to call in.
4418872	4419572	Well, there you have it.
4419592	4420974	I thought you guys were taking calls.
4421554	4423916	Do you miss living where the show is recorded?
4425638	4428640	Yeah, I don't miss you, but I miss the show.
4429121	4430982	I miss everything about the show.
4431162	4432824	You miss Jamie and Matt, but...
4434573	4435794	I miss Jamie and that.
4437135	4438316	Nothing about you, though.
4440779	4444462	You need to actually come with us to get Indian food when you can eat.
4446184	4446965	Yeah, I know.
4447125	4453251	Actually, that place is very friendly to the South Beach diet, is what I was reading.
4455292	4456834	It's all whole wheat or unbleached.
4457139	4458200	And it's great for vegetarians.
4458220	4458820	Except for the rice.
4459060	4460561	It's awesome for vegetarians, too.
4461041	4462922	I'm actually thinking about going vegetarian again.
4462942	4463942	I just did three days ago.
4464383	4464743	Did you?
4464843	4465023	Yes.
4465543	4465863	Cool.
4466003	4467604	That's why I'm taking vitamins and stuff.
4467624	4471566	I didn't want to make too big a deal out of it, because last time I went vegetarian, I was not able to do it for more than a week and a half.
4471606	4474508	So you're being a vegetarian, Rob?
4474768	4474988	What?
4476314	4478336	I will go vegetarian with you, except I will need to eat fish.
4499702	4502983	No, I'm going to eat fish, too, because protein is so hard to get.
4503283	4504203	I get an earache.
4504223	4505523	Well, then you're not a true vegetarian.
4505543	4506563	You're right, I'm not.
4506643	4508884	So it would be more appropriate to say I don't eat meat.
4509924	4510404	No red meat.
4510424	4511524	Yeah, you're a fishitarian.
4511564	4512384	No red meat and no protein.
4512404	4513304	Yeah, I'm a fishitarian.
4513864	4514745	I can't give up sushi.
4514765	4515165	I just can't.
4515445	4516785	All right, well, anyway, enough about that.
4518085	4519605	Who the fuck cares about what I eat?
4519665	4520286	Extrovert.
4520346	4521466	Nobody cares about what I eat.
4521926	4524446	Extrovert, what kind of games have you been playing this week?
4524646	4527267	I don't know if you remember, but we talk about video games on this show once in a while.
4527287	4528387	What kind of video games have you been playing?
4530763	4534886	I've been playing World of Warcraft and Puzzle Quest.
4535006	4535926	Big surprise!
4536506	4540529	How's World of Warcraft been treating you?
4540569	4541129	Pretty good.
4541629	4547952	I'm at the end of a grind in the game, and I don't know.
4548233	4554516	Like, it's getting kind of boring because I've gotten a lot of stuff, and so now I'm like,
4555347	4561272	What are you most looking forward to about Wrath of the Lich King?
4565556	4566737	I haven't decided yet.
4567197	4571881	I think that just to look in the new areas and stuff like that, explore in the new areas.
4573493	4573773	Awesome.
4574094	4596010	Well, you know, when I come back to World of Warcraft, which is probably going to happen, because, oh, my gosh, I can't believe we didn't talk about it during the news, but Final Fantasy XI, okay, A, I kind of stopped playing like a couple weeks ago, but B, they announced that for the new expansion that's coming out, Wings of the Goddess is the new expansion coming out, they have announced one of the new job classes for Wings of the Goddess, Dancer.
4596770	4597691	So you can shake your booty.
4597711	4598252	Yeah, I know.
4598552	4599633	Oh, I'm so excited.
4599673	4602715	By the way, Sauce says it's technically pescatarianism.
4603399	4603959	is that what it is?
4604080	4604720	Pescatarian?
4604760	4619750	will not eat the flesh of any animal other than types of seafood yes and I don't want to live off seafood but I just want that to be available because I'm not I'm doing it for health reasons not I'm not a member of PETA or anything it's just health reasons people eating tasty animals well hey what?
4619871	4625755	if you come back to WoW then you can't you're like a you're a cooker right?
4625775	4627156	you cook food in WoW right?
4627196	4627556	yes yes
4628655	4630396	Yeah, so you can't make any meat anymore.
4630596	4633358	I'll call you a liar.
4633879	4635120	It's a virtual game.
4635180	4635920	It doesn't matter.
4636761	4638502	It matters.
4638782	4639823	It matters to me.
4640223	4643005	If you give me meat, I'm going to call you a liar.
4643165	4647268	If I was a card-carrying member of PETA, then maybe, but I'm doing it for health reasons.
4647568	4651831	Because I'll tell you what, making yourself vegetarian really makes you stop and think about everything you're eating.
4652112	4653713	Whereas usually, you don't.
4654473	4655794	If you're not on some type of thing, you don't.
4656174	4657635	But I don't want to talk about food anymore.
4657675	4658216	Jesus Christ.
4658636	4658876	Alright.
4660077	4661277	See, now everybody in chat is yelling at me.
4661297	4662558	I should never call myself a vegetarian.
4662578	4664099	I'm just on a lifestyle adjustment.
4664419	4664839	Who cares?
4665640	4665880	Alright.
4666300	4667281	Excellent hanging up on you.
4667321	4668101	You're ruining the show.
4668121	4668501	You had a what?
4671670	4673431	I had a mushroom Swiss burger today.
4673471	4674092	It was so good.
4674112	4674972	I'm so glad to hear it.
4674992	4677534	Filled with meat and protein and meat.
4677794	4679115	All right, I'm hanging up.
4679235	4680196	Buy extra frozen.
4680216	4683739	But remember, you can only eat top cuts of meat.
4683819	4689443	It has to all be lean, less than 5% fat from meat if you're doing South Beach.
4689963	4691724	That's right.
4692005	4695107	You'll balloon up and you'll look like all those contestants on Biggest Loser.
4696712	4697613	You look like Roseanne.
4697633	4698193	Well, good.
4698233	4701075	Then I can try out for Biggest Loser next year.
4701716	4702016	All right.
4702096	4703157	I'm hanging up on you, Extifer.
4704237	4704618	Okay.
4704638	4705038	Take care.
4705078	4705798	I love you all.
4705818	4706519	Bye.
4706679	4707039	Bye.
4708981	4712543	I'm surprised Extifer didn't use the opportunity to tell us he was talking to us on his iPhone.
4713524	4715605	Because usually he'll say, I'm on my iPhone.
4716786	4720448	Actually, the funny thing about Extifer, he has a whole YouTube series now.
4720508	4722690	His live journal posts have all been YouTube clips.
4723090	4725952	Extifer, if you're still in chat, you can plug your YouTube channel there.
4726678	4729561	You have to spell his name really funny, so I can't even remember how to get there.
4730001	4730381	There you go.
4731402	4737107	And Actdeft will also be coming back to Orange Launch Radio just as soon as we can get coordinated and get our Wednesday show off the ground again.
4737147	4740790	But we're going to do something with video this time because of Op 11 and all that fun stuff.
4740850	4741591	I'm going to hide.
4741611	4743373	It's the Wednesday show.
4743413	4743933	You're not on it.
4743973	4746015	I should come on the Wednesday show and bring pizza.
4746035	4746856	But then you have to be on cam.
4747176	4747476	No.
4748077	4748177	Fine.
4748197	4749998	Then you have to wear a paper bag over your head the whole time.
4750038	4751860	Like Faust from Guilty Gear.
4752641	4752921	All right.
4754196	4755817	That's it for the Skype line tonight, you guys.
4755837	4758378	Thanks so much for tuning in and participating.
4758418	4758918	Appreciate it.
4759318	4759698	Play it.
4759738	4759978	Hold on.
4759998	4760578	We're not there yet.
4760698	4761219	I'm not there yet.
4761819	4763179	Any more last-minute stories?
4763319	4763599	Yes.
4764080	4764360	Thank you.
4764400	4766580	I've been finding more as we wait.
4767121	4779265	Anyways, some interesting stuff to kind of go back to last week's story, how we talked about Sony releasing 3.71 firmware for the PSP and PSP Slim to circumvent the...
4780614	4787820	Team M33 has just released the custom firmware 3.71 to combat that.
4789181	4795546	So now you have all the wonderful features of the most current firmware for the PSP, and you can also run homebrew.
4796506	4798348	It will never work, Sony.
4798448	4802110	Try as you may, it will never, ever work.
4803792	4804112	Anyways...
4805067	4806547	Some other interesting stuff.
4807027	4814549	There is a Chinese MMO company, Shonda Entertainment, who has a MMO called King of the World.
4815009	4819450	Apparently, they have banned men playing women characters.
4820950	4822391	Oh, shit.
4822431	4824031	You know I only play women characters now.
4824051	4827192	You will be required to prove your gender via webcam.
4829472	4831032	What if it's a really pretty guy?
4831113	4831373	I know.
4831393	4832333	That won't be hard to fake.
4832353	4833273	What if you're Chris Crocker?
4834442	4836904	or just put your sister in front of the camera.
4837404	4839705	My little six-year-old sister.
4839825	4843987	Or what if you have a woman who has very masculine features?
4844988	4846048	You mad.
4846769	4847909	Yeah, what do they do with trannies?
4848290	4848950	I don't know.
4848970	4850331	No love for the transsexuals.
4853728	4854809	I love channies, Rob.
4855429	4855789	I know you do.
4877403	4882146	People are noticing that more and more EB games are slowly becoming GameStop.
4882206	4884487	I wonder what's going to happen to the two that are in the mall.
4884527	4886328	So it's kind of speculation, isn't it?
4886949	4892872	Well, they said just this week that two stores in Rochester have already become GameStops.
4893613	4896294	And that they've noticed more and more since then.
4897675	4901017	Samurai Shodown 2 is coming to Xbox Live Arcade and the Wii.
4901458	4903679	Which is the best one in the series.
4903739	4907181	It was shown at Tokyo Game Show, so people will be happy about that.
4907970	4909370	Best one ever.
4910050	4914051	It is coming to the Japanese Xbox Live Arcade, so no one worried if it's coming to the US.
4914391	4915071	Probably will be.
4916431	4925333	And then finally, there have been some tools released for modders of the Xbox 360.
4926533	4937795	Using, I guess, a timing attack with a mod chip that's out there right now, you can drop your firmware down to one that can be exploited
4938308	4948310	and it will allow you to install Linux on your Xbox 360 and probably also run Homebrew and God knows probably running backups of games.
4949630	4957671	And then real quick, this is more for in-studio unfortunately, check out this cool add-on for the Arkanoid DS game that's got the... Oh yeah, the little paddle.
4957711	4958131	That's cool.
4958211	4959552	I saw that somewhere, that was awesome.
4959572	4960552	Yeah, that's pretty awesome.
4962792	4965353	Let's see, I think, yep, that's all the stories I had.
4966693	4967593	Well, it's about time.
4967952	4974601	All right, now, DarkSakura, set up this YouTube-age I'm going to look at here in studio, and the folks on the stream and podcast will get the audio.
4975146	4980429	This was back in the day when there was the big debate between the Dreamcast and the PS2.
4980870	4982471	People trying to decide what was better.
4982951	4988474	And this is basically a Dreamcast and a VMU talking to a PlayStation 2.
4988514	4991176	Now wait, was this an actual commercial on TV or what was this?
4991196	4992417	No, this is just a fan video.
4992497	4995919	And it was on some site a long time ago, but a bunch of people have re-uploaded it.
4996519	4999481	But the PS2 was the one with the really snooty voice.
5000501	5003003	And the Dreamcast is like the regular, you know...
5003581	5003741	Hey, PS2!
5003761	5003841	Yes?
5015586	5017527	Me and the VMU were watching you play Ridge Racer 5.
5017887	5019108	Oh, really?
5019128	5021129	Yeah, and we thought it looked really good.
5021669	5023090	Ah, thank you.
5023410	5024511	Yeah, it looks good.
5024951	5026432	For us to poop on.
5029013	5034896	Mock me if you must, but keep in mind that I am powered by the 128-bit emotion engine.
5034936	5037877	Yeah, the only emotion you're giving developers is frustration.
5037897	5038858	Ha ha ha ha!
5039558	5041479	They better be programming on a Saturn!
5041559	5042920	What a disappointment.
5042960	5048042	Only top-notch Japanese development studios can obtain optimum results from my hardware.
5048222	5051403	Yeah, then how come Dead or Alive 2 looks better running on me than on you?
5051583	5052784	What a disappointment.
5053484	5057006	But surely you've witnessed the raw beauty that is Tekken Tag Tournament.
5057426	5060507	Yeah, a game that looks like Tekken 3 running in enhanced mode.
5060687	5061688	What a disappointment.
5061848	5062548	Oh, I see.
5062888	5073132	Do you actually believe your crappy lineup can compete with Japs at Radio, Grandia 2, Echo the Dolphin, Metropolis Street Racer, Furballs, NFL 2001, Eternal Arcadia, Slammity Amigo, and Sonic Adventure 2?
5073352	5074993	Oh, yeah?
5075393	5078494	Well, all that Namco thinks you can handle is Mr. Drew!
5078514	5080074	Hey, hey, hey, do you want to go?
5080175	5080795	Do you want some of this?
5080935	5084416	I'll spank you like a little bitch, you f***ing b***h!
5084456	5085536	Come on, come on!
5085556	5086537	Good luck, you're okay!
5097285	5103909	I have had enough of you!
5103929	5105970	The internet thanks you for blowing out their speakers.
5105990	5106451	Good job.
5106831	5107991	What a disappointment.
5109732	5110353	That was great.
5110433	5113134	I love that little video.
5113435	5115876	That was from user Kohan69 on YouTube.
5115936	5117997	I'm going to post it in the chat room again.
5118518	5119178	It's funny.
5121158	5121578	Wow.
5122159	5124400	Okay, well, on that note, God, this has been a long show tonight.
5124420	5125701	Both segments over an hour and a half.
5126021	5127002	That's because we're awesome.
5127022	5128483	I think it's time to wrap this shit up.
5129123	5131905	Just like that PlayStation 2 got, we need to put a bullet in this show.
5131965	5132406	It's done.
5132806	5135648	So that means we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.
5136368	5137309	Loki, your final thought.
5138407	5142711	My final thought is... I was just reading this last article here.
5142731	5152799	There's some 12-year-old, I guess, a 6th grader that received $6.5 million for an in-game commerce network they designed.
5153840	5154280	Bastard.
5155721	5156382	Okay.
5156462	5157122	I want $6.5 million.
5158003	5162346	My final thought is... I want a cookie.
5163187	5164228	DarkSakura, your final thought.
5164448	5165269	Dreamcast!
