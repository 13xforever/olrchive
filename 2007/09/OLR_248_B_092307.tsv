15300	19600	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19600	24900	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, September the 23rd of 2007.
24900	28300	I know we don't talk about the weather a lot on this program because we're a video game podcast after all,
28300	31900	but I have to say here locally, where we're based out of Sacramento, California,
31900	38000	it's been nice to actually see some signs of fall recently as opposed to still the temperatures above 100 degrees.
38000	42100	So it actually rained this weekend. Perfect day to stay indoors and play video games, which is what I did.
42100	43800	I played Eternal Sonata like all day yesterday.
43800	45400	I love the rain.
45400	46800	Rain's nice, but you know...
46800	49400	I opened all the windows in the house while I was home.
49400	52600	Yeah, I don't necessarily want to go out and play in it, but I have the view.
52600	54900	I can look in the backyard and watch the rain fall, so...
54900	56200	Rain is great.
56200	59000	Rain's okay. It's overrated sometimes.
59000	61700	If I wanted to see rain all the time, I'd live in Seattle or something.
61700	63300	Live in Alabama for a while.
63300	64600	Do they get a lot of rain there too?
64600	65400	Oh, hell yeah.
65400	66000	All right.
66000	68700	Second highest precipitation in the country.
68700	70800	It's a subtropical climate.
70800	72600	All right. Less weather, more games.
72600	82400	Yes. One interesting thing to happen this week is that Intel has actually bought the physics engine Havok
82400	86000	and is now going to be incorporating it into their product.
86000	89200	Interesting enough, the Havok engine has been in quite a few games,
89200	95600	including Bioshock, Stranglehold, Halo 2, Half-Life 2, Oblivion, and Crackdown,
95600	99900	and they've bought the company for $21 million.
99900	101600	So...
101600	102200	It's pretty cool.
102200	104800	I could sell them my cat for $21 million.
104800	109400	So maybe we'll see some more Havok stuff built into the new Intel chips,
109400	111900	which would be good because, you know, physics are awesome.
111900	114300	That's the new wave now.
114300	115200	Take it from Loki.
115200	117300	Physics are awesome.
117300	117800	In games.
117800	119000	Wouldn't it be physics is?
119000	121600	Real physics suck.
121600	125000	Intelligence are awesome.
125000	126700	Intelligence are awesome.
126700	128600	That's right.
128600	132000	Get this, and you have to be really intelligent to do something like this.
132000	137500	A World of Warcraft character has been sold for 7,000 euros.
137500	141200	That would be about $9,700 US.
141200	144900	The reason why it sold for so damn much money,
144900	148900	apparently it had four out of five pieces of a tier six armor set.
148900	151000	Obviously the damn thing was level sevenary.
151000	156000	It had legendary swords that were dropped by Illidan Stormrage.
156000	159300	So basically it was about as high of a character as you can get.
159300	160400	And there you have it.
160400	162300	This character sold for $10,000.
162300	165800	Granted, I don't know where this sold, but I'm assuming it was on eBay or something.
165800	167800	It sold for...
167800	169800	The price was in euros, so it had to be in Europe.
169800	171800	Well, yeah, but was it like eBay Europe or what?
171800	172400	I'm not sure.
172400	175400	If I were rich, I would buy him and delete him.
175400	177400	That would piss everyone off.
177400	180900	Well, I thought it was funny they were mentioning in there that the person that bought it,
180900	182400	his regular account was banned.
182400	185400	Oh, so that's why they bought it.
185400	186400	That makes sense.
186400	188400	But apparently it had been banned for some time.
188400	191400	Yeah, that totally makes sense to spend $10,000 on a character.
191400	192400	Never mind.
192400	193900	Well, okay, in somebody's mind though,
193900	195900	dude, what if they had a lot of friends on there or something?
195900	197400	Dude, if I had that much money,
197400	200400	well, you know, I would do actually constructive things with it.
200400	202400	Probably someone like Ashlee Simpson or something like that.
202400	204400	I'm totally hardcore, yo!
204400	206400	Look at all the stuff I earned!
206400	209400	All the stuff. I'm super awesome.
209400	211400	And of course, the chat, our chat room,
211400	213400	chat, thatorangehonestradio.com is asking about
213400	215400	four strength, four stamped leather belts.
215400	217400	You know what? Shut up.
217400	220400	I'm only going to tell you this once, chat. Shut up.
220400	222400	It's an inside joke. Forget it.
222400	225400	Yeah, but World of Warcraft doesn't have a goat helmet.
225400	227400	Like, like, Ragnarok does.
227400	229400	You know what else World of Warcraft
229400	231400	doesn't have that Ragnarok does have that's pretty awesome?
231400	232400	Awesome.
232400	233400	The bow that you can wear in your hair.
233400	234400	You know, the bow is great.
234400	236400	You can get a giant bow, Rob.
236400	238400	I used to have a SARS mask and a bow. It's awesome.
238400	239400	I gave you your bow.
239400	240400	Anyway.
240400	243400	It used to be my cell phone.
243400	246400	I will think about playing Ragnarok on your server,
246400	247400	but after I beat Eternal Sonata.
247400	249400	I could give you panties.
249400	252400	Please don't ever tell me that again.
252400	254400	No, in one of the dungeons,
254400	256400	it's like because the drop rate is so high,
256400	258400	you leave with like 500 pairs of panties.
258400	262400	Only on this program.
262400	264400	It's Ragnarok.
264400	266400	Women throwing their panties at me.
266400	268400	Anyway.
268400	269400	Next story, please.
269400	270400	Panty lover.
270400	272400	Don't wanna. I quit.
272400	273400	Do not want.
273400	274400	No.
274400	277400	New downloadable content for Guitar Hero 2
277400	282400	will have some pretty, pretty cool stuff.
282400	284400	Trivium's a detonation.
284400	289400	Atreyu a right side of the bed and protest the heroes bury the hatchet.
289400	293400	I just think it's rad there's a band called Atreyu.
293400	294400	We did.
294400	295400	That was the dude in Never Ending Story.
295400	296400	I know.
296400	299400	Their cover of You Give Love a Bad Name.
299400	303400	It's like the verse parts are awful,
303400	305400	because he's also just doing nothing but screaming,
305400	307400	but like the chorus parts are great.
307400	310400	So that's like the worst and best cover ever.
310400	314400	The cover does in fact give love a bad name, actually.
314400	315400	It gives everything a bad name.
315400	319400	Phil Do in our chat room says Atreyu sucks.
319400	321400	They suck.
321400	322400	But they have a rad name.
322400	325400	I mean they might totally suck, but they have a rad name.
325400	326400	You can't deny that.
326400	330400	Well it's even worse though if you have a crappy band with a cool name.
330400	333400	It's like why didn't you pick a crappy name?
333400	336400	Dammit, now like a cool band can't have your name.
336400	337400	Loser.
337400	342400	What was that quote in Wayne's World, one of my favorite movies of all time?
342400	343400	Who else is playing tonight?
343400	344400	The shitty Beatles.
344400	345400	The shitty Beatles?
345400	346400	Yeah, they suck.
346400	348400	Oh, that's not just a clever name.
348400	351400	Yeah, that was great.
351400	354400	I'm sure I butchered that quote, but I could almost quote that entire movie.
354400	357400	That's how much I love Wayne's World.
357400	358400	Anyway.
358400	362400	Back to games, please help save the show.
362400	364400	Anyways.
364400	371400	So, you know, if you're not into downloading songs off of Xbox Live, well maybe you just
371400	379400	want to buy the soundtrack to Guitar Hero 3 and put that in your system and unlock some
379400	380400	more songs that way.
380400	387400	Apparently actually there will be a code to download some songs off of Xbox Live to be
387400	389400	added into Guitar Hero 3.
389400	394400	Okay, three tracks that you want to unlock include, let's see here.
394400	405400	A track by AFI, Carcigen Crush looks like Tina by Flyleaf and a remix of Marilyn Manson's
405400	412400	Putting Holes in Happiness by Nick Zinner of the Ya Ya Yas.
412400	416400	So, how much you want to bet?
416400	422400	Just, you know, how much you want to bet that these songs are already in the game and you're
422400	423400	just having to buy the soundtrack?
423400	426400	Well, you're just unlocking them on the disc already.
426400	428400	And that pisses people off.
428400	432400	I notice that pisses a lot of Xbox people off when they download these things and they
432400	435400	find that they're just keys to unlock shit that was already on the disc.
435400	436400	But here's the thing, though, about this.
436400	441400	It wasn't really clear to me whether this is just for the 360 or what.
441400	443400	I mean, this is coming from Billboard.
443400	446400	They were saying that this is going to be a code or whatever, but they may misinterpret
446400	451400	it to actually being a physical code that you punch into the game.
451400	456400	Because obviously this game is coming out on almost all the platforms, so it wouldn't
456400	459400	be surprising if it's just a little key code that you put in.
459400	463400	Kind of like all that exclusive GameStop content you get.
463400	468400	It's just a code that ends up leaking out on the internet later on anyways.
468400	472400	Well this kind of news makes me angsty, but it's not time for that segment yet.
472400	476400	Well instead I have to do some news that makes me happy.
476400	478400	You know I love me some GameTap.
478400	480400	I've talked about the service here and I think it's a great service.
480400	484400	GameTap is getting a much beloved game here of the OLR staff.
484400	485400	I totally need GameTap now.
485400	488400	Typing of the Dead is coming to GameTap in October.
488400	490400	That's awesome!
490400	494400	October 11th they'll be getting a Typing of the Dead there on GameTap.
494400	496400	And I'm assuming that must be the Dreamcast one.
496400	497400	I have that on Dreamcast.
497400	500400	Because GameTap emulates Dreamcast software.
500400	501400	So I'm assuming that's what it is.
501400	502400	That's awesome.
502400	504400	I have that on Dreamcast.
504400	505400	It's so much fun.
505400	507400	Oh my god it's so much fun.
507400	511400	When I used to hang out with Iguana Girl.
511400	517400	We used to just go over and do nothing but play Typing of the Dead for hours.
517400	518400	I'm not even joking.
518400	520400	What was the version of it they had at Arcade Infinity for a while?
520400	521400	It was the Japanese one.
521400	522400	Yeah the Japanese one.
522400	525400	But you couldn't beat one of the bosses because it asks you trivia questions.
525400	526400	And you can't beat it.
526400	528400	Because it's in Japanese.
528400	529400	Yeah unless you can speak it.
529400	531400	But man playing the Japanese one was hard.
531400	533400	Because you wouldn't know the words.
533400	539400	Well I think that it had like an English Typing mode.
539400	541400	And then it had the Kana mode.
541400	545400	And I used to actually have the Kana memorized.
545400	546400	But it's been a long time.
546400	548400	Oh no I played the one that was normal.
548400	549400	Like Romaji letters.
549400	550400	You know you just play.
550400	551400	It's easy.
551400	553400	But then when you got to the boss that asked you trivia questions.
553400	555400	You couldn't beat him.
555400	556400	Unless you spoke Japanese.
556400	557400	Of which I don't.
557400	560400	And if you've ever listened to me cover Japanese release dates.
560400	562400	And you already know this.
562400	565400	Anyhow let's open up the old mailbag.
565400	567400	Every week you guys send us emails.
567400	568400	Mailbag at Orangelandsradio.com.
568400	570400	And we read them here live on air.
570400	572400	Dark Sakura will answer your questions.
572400	576400	Or she'll taunt you and make fun of your grammar and punctuation.
576400	578400	Mailbag at Orangelandsradio.com is the place to do it.
578400	580400	Dark Sakura open up the mailbag.
580400	581400	Dive on in.
581400	582400	What do we got?
582400	585400	The first one comes from Spamouflage.
585400	587400	That's a great name.
587400	589400	Guys you make my Monday morning at work fun.
589400	591400	Thanks for the podcast.
591400	594400	Why is Uncharted referred to as Tomb Raider with a guy and unoriginal.
594400	599400	Where as every single WW2 slash army type slash alien space type first person shooter.
599400	602400	Isn't criticized for lack of originality.
602400	604400	Lastly I've noticed a trend on your show.
604400	605400	1.
605400	609400	Loki makes an Xbox 360 announcement and follows it with a neutral or positive comment.
609400	610400	2.
610400	613400	Loki makes a PS3 announcement followed by a sarcastic or negative comment.
613400	614400	Don't believe me?
614400	615400	3.
615400	619400	Loki asks the ever so lovely Dark Sakura to ring a bell every time you say something negative
619400	621400	about the PS3 and see how many times you catch yourself.
621400	622400	Enough.
622400	623400	Why the hate?
623400	624400	Come on.
624400	625400	Thanks.
625400	626400	4.
626400	627400	P.S.
627400	628400	No idea how to spell Loki so make fun of me.
628400	629400	I deserve it.
629400	630400	It's L.O.K.I.
630400	631400	Not with two E's.
631400	632400	That looks very girly.
632400	633400	Loki!
633400	636400	That's like a MySpace name.
636400	637400	Seriously.
637400	641400	Put a T in there you have lockette.
641400	643400	Should we do that next week?
643400	644400	A bell?
644400	645400	Let's do it.
645400	647400	Let's keep a little tally thing.
647400	648400	A little tally?
648400	649400	Alright.
649400	653400	Next week we'll get Dark Sakura a bell and every time Loki makes a negative comment about
653400	654400	the PS3 we'll ring it.
654400	656400	Well maybe they should stop making it so damn easy.
656400	657400	Seriously.
657400	658400	I mean.
658400	659400	Come on.
659400	661400	I own both systems, okay?
661400	662400	Alright.
662400	665400	I can't help it if they keep disappointing me.
665400	666400	Okay.
666400	669400	Well the emailer raises a valid point.
669400	675400	Why does this Uncharted get passed off as Tomb Raider with a guy whereas lots of other
675400	677400	games are copies of each other?
677400	680400	Well I'm not saying that all the games that come out are original anyways.
680400	681400	I mean, shit.
681400	684400	There's how many World War II first person shooter games out there?
684400	685400	I mean, seriously.
685400	692880	And if I were to compare Halo 3 to Resistance I mean it looks and kind of plays very similar
692880	693880	so.
693880	694880	Ah, so you did?
694880	695880	Yeah, that's true.
695880	697560	You did make an Xbox 360 comparison earlier in the show.
697560	702200	I mean I'm not saying that all the 360 games that come out are original and that's definitely
702200	703560	not the case.
703560	709680	You know, but I don't know it's just unfortunately the problem with Uncharted and not that it's
709680	714940	going to be a bad game or anything but unfortunately their track record so far is all these games
714940	720680	seem to be pretty average and it looks just like a Tomb Raider game but with a male lead
720680	724120	and they're expecting this to be this big holiday seller.
724120	725440	I don't think it's going to happen.
725440	731440	I mean, maybe Unreal Tournament 3 but then again, no, that's another first person shooter
731440	732440	game.
732440	735040	I mean, nothing's original nowadays.
735040	737000	It's very hard to make an original game.
737000	740160	Well we'll withhold that final judgment until the game is actually released and you get
740160	741160	a chance to play it.
741160	742160	That's fine.
742160	744120	I'm not going to buy it but you know what?
744120	747720	If you want to buy it and if you like those kind of action adventure games then maybe
747720	748720	that's something for you.
748720	752800	Maybe that's the game that you've been looking for for the Playstation 3.
752800	756880	If you're waiting though for some of these other games that they keep promising us but
756880	761680	you know, I'm very disappointed that we don't have Final Fantasy 13 yet or even a demo of
761680	766680	it as they promised us before but all this stuff keeps getting pushed back.
766680	767920	I love the bell idea though.
767920	770080	It's because Sony and they can.
770080	771080	Comments from chat.
771080	772080	Chat.orangehonestradio.com.
772080	773880	Rob D. would like to say, no it's not.
773880	776760	It's very hard to get funding for an innovative game because it's a risk.
776760	779760	There's a difference.
779760	780760	So next email?
780760	781760	Yes, please.
781760	782760	That's the bell idea.
782760	783760	We'll do that.
783760	784760	Next email.
784760	785760	This comes from Ospher.
785760	786760	Dear Rob.
786760	790920	Yeah, I said Rob but everyone else can chime in with their opinion if they wish to do so.
790920	793840	You always talk about Final Fantasy 12 as such a great game.
793840	794840	Why?
794840	797980	What's so great about a game that has a boring political storyline?
797980	804200	To me a great compelling story like Final Fantasy 7 and 10 are what make the games great.
804200	805480	Also I don't like the battle system.
805480	806720	It's way too much like World of Warcraft.
806720	810240	I prefer the strategic system like in Final Fantasy 10.
810240	813440	Speaking of which, Final Fantasy 10 needs more praise.
813440	817680	For me it's the best game in the series and one of the few games I have ever pulled an
817680	818800	all-nighter on.
818800	820760	Why the story is freaking epic.
820760	822560	It's compelled me to keep playing.
822560	825720	I also love the battle system and don't really mind the random battles.
825720	827960	Final Fantasy 10 too wasn't that bad either.
827960	832960	People just need to quit complaining about Yuna singing which I think is really good.
832960	836560	A Thousand Words is an amazing song.
836560	840240	The only thing that made me sad is that Final Fantasy 10 too likes summons but oh well.
840240	841240	Thanks for reading Ospher.
841240	842240	I agree.
842240	847960	It's 12 is actually one of the Final Fantasy games I have not played.
847960	853040	I just have no, it doesn't, I don't know, it just doesn't.
853040	854660	You know I don't know how else to say it.
854660	857160	I enjoyed the story.
857160	860700	Sometimes you watch a movie that one person doesn't like but another person likes.
860700	864400	I would agree though that 10 is sometimes underrated by the community as a whole and
864400	866120	gets a lot of shit that it doesn't deserve.
866120	867120	I love 10.
867120	868120	10 had a great story.
868120	871680	But I don't think the battle system, I mean the battle system in 12 to me is what makes
871680	872680	it so great.
872680	873760	It's not the story that makes 12 great.
873760	875240	I think the battle system is what makes it great.
875240	876240	I hate the battle system.
876240	877240	Really?
877240	878480	It's not like WoW to me.
878480	881920	It's more like Final Fantasy 11 but with people that you can control.
881920	886120	What I've gone through with the story so far, I actually like political stories.
886120	888760	I love things that make you think.
888760	892920	You know and maybe, I don't know if that, I'm not trying to be rude or anything but
892920	898320	sometimes people don't like stories that require a lot of, I would have to say, logical thought
898320	900420	as opposed to emotional thought.
900420	901420	You know what I mean?
901420	902680	Well, a good game takes both.
902680	907200	A good battle schematic and a play schematic and story.
907200	908200	And here's the thing.
908200	909200	I'm going to use 8 as an example.
909200	912960	I can't fucking stand Final Fantasy 8 and it has nothing to do with the story because
912960	916700	I think the story is awesome and I kind of wish they would have made the story what they
916700	919120	ended up making the movie, Final Fantasy the movie.
919120	923160	But my problem with Final Fantasy 8 is that the battles and the whole junctioning magic
923160	925440	and all that shit ruined the game for me.
925440	927880	Single-handedly ruined the game and could not stand the battle system at 8.
927880	928880	Couldn't stand it.
928880	931840	So I didn't want to play through it.
931840	932840	See, 8.
932840	934200	I kind of liked the junctioning.
934200	939280	I mean, I really, really liked having to draw your spells.
939280	940280	Drawing magic.
940280	941280	It hits a nerve.
941280	942280	I liked it.
942280	943280	I couldn't stand it.
943280	944280	I liked that part of it.
944280	947160	But by the time I got to the third disc and was trying to put together my weapons and
947160	950120	shit, I was like, BORED NOW!
950120	952080	So I watched someone else beat it and didn't have to.
952080	955200	I had already gotten all the other cool cutscenes anyway.
955200	958320	That's why I said before I got to the end of the first disc, I'm like, ugh.
958320	960000	The second disc had some cool crap in it.
960000	963360	Had the Ultimatia battles and all that.
963360	965720	I don't really like when the monster is level with you either.
965720	966720	I don't know.
966720	967720	Yeah, no, that was kind of...
967720	968720	That kind of thing bugs me.
968720	969720	I don't know why.
969720	974400	I like being able to go to so and such area and knowing what to expect.
974400	975400	You know.
975400	981040	But then again, this next email, if we are ready.
981040	982040	It's from RobWithTwoBees.
982040	983040	Yes, ma'am.
983040	985040	Oh, I haven't heard from him in a while.
985040	986040	Hooray for RobWithTwoBees.
986040	988040	Well, he sent us a few stories, but...
988040	992000	And sometimes we try to work them into the show role, but, you know.
992000	993000	Oh, here we go.
993000	998320	I haven't said this in a while, but the latest Xbox Live Arcade title, is it Genom or Genom?
998320	1000640	I guess it would be Genom if you were using proper pronunciation.
1000640	1002680	Oh, that's the one I mentioned in part A.
1002680	1003760	I think that was the name.
1003760	1006000	Had everything right except for fun.
1006000	1007400	It just isn't fun to me.
1007400	1011320	I'm hoping I missed something, but the whole collection of dots is arbitrary and making
1011320	1015680	them in... and then making it an arena game competitive dot eating.
1015680	1016680	Rob?
1016680	1018640	No, I kind of agree.
1018640	1022360	I mean, the game... let's just say I did not jump up and want to spend 10 bucks on this
1022360	1023360	game.
1023360	1024960	I mean, I just... I don't know.
1024960	1025960	You're right.
1025960	1030480	It's just... it's like all the parts are there, but the whole they'd add up to.
1030480	1031480	It's just...
1031480	1035320	It's like when you look at $10, you know, spending on that game and you're saying, hmm,
1035320	1039760	look, Res HD is coming out at some point and Ikaruga and all that stuff.
1039760	1040760	It's like...
1040760	1041760	Ikaruga?
1041760	1044080	Yeah, I don't know if I want to spend $10 on this one.
1044080	1046600	I can buy that for probably about $10 as well, so...
1046600	1049840	That's a damn fine point.
1049840	1050840	That's it.
1050840	1051840	Ikaruga.
1051840	1054880	Um, next email, shall I?
1054880	1055880	You shall.
1055880	1060800	Dear Our Lady of the Rosary, OLR, video game missionaries, howdy, I have two questions
1060800	1061800	for you fine people.
1061800	1062800	What?
1062800	1063800	I don't know.
1063800	1064800	Okay.
1064800	1065800	Someone be creative.
1065800	1066800	Huh.
1066800	1067800	What?
1067800	1068800	That is certainly creative.
1068800	1069800	I beat the ferret in your honor.
1069800	1072280	And the ferret liked it.
1072280	1077880	One, I once had a PS2, the original bigger kind, but it was getting a little spotty on
1077880	1081360	playing some games and I wanted a GameCube anyway, so a couple of years ago I traded
1081360	1082360	it in.
1082360	1083680	But now I miss the Silent Hill games.
1083680	1084680	Never finished two.
1084680	1086440	Why haven't you finished two?
1086440	1087840	It's the shortest one.
1087840	1088840	Anyway.
1088840	1092320	But I've been getting all nostalgic when you guys talk about them.
1092320	1097540	And I want to play Final Fantasy XII, so I'm going to buy one, buy a used one online with
1097540	1098540	some birthday money.
1098540	1102220	However, I'll be getting a slim PS2 and I remember reading something about the slims
1102220	1104300	getting too hot and frying the unit.
1104300	1109120	My question is, do I have to worry about this with used slash refurb PS2s or have all the
1109120	1112760	units in question been recalled or fixed at the time of refurbishment?
1112760	1116240	If I do have to worry about this, is there some way I can tell if the unit I get is one
1116240	1118040	of the models prone to overheating?
1118040	1123200	That I personally do not know because I actually have our first PS2 still and it works just
1123200	1124580	fine.
1124580	1130140	And on top of that, I have a first model Japanese PS2 that works just fine, which is an oddity.
1130140	1131140	You know what?
1131140	1132140	Here's the thing.
1132140	1136120	Any system is going to have some faulty ones, but you can take steps in making sure that
1136120	1138760	the system is not going to fry itself and that would be, you know, make sure...
1138760	1139920	Not buying it on eBay.
1139920	1141600	Don't put it in an oven.
1141600	1143780	Make sure it's in a well-ventilated place.
1143780	1145560	You know, don't put it in a box.
1145560	1147400	Take care of it when you move it around, you know.
1147400	1155040	A suggestion I do have that came back from the Dreamcast days is if you have carpet or
1155040	1159960	anything, put a flat surface down like, you know, a cutting board or something and then
1159960	1161960	set your system on top of that.
1161960	1167880	And that way it'll be elevated so that the vents, if the vents are underneath it, can
1167880	1168880	get some...
1168880	1171440	You're like the Martha Stewart of gaming.
1171440	1175400	Well, you know, the Dreamcast did have a problem with getting a little too hot.
1175400	1177220	Without the jail time.
1177220	1179600	And without the bad hair.
1179600	1181440	And without the fruits of the garden.
1181440	1183440	No, my Slim PS2 works just fine.
1183440	1184440	I've been using...
1184440	1187800	I did not buy an American PS2 until the Slims were out.
1187800	1191560	I only had a Japanese PlayStation 2 for the longest time.
1191560	1194840	And I finally bought a US one when the Slims came out.
1194840	1198000	So it works just fine for me still.
1198000	1201680	So for whatever it's worth, there you have it.
1201680	1202680	Shall I move forward?
1202680	1203680	You shall.
1203680	1204680	Yay.
1204680	1206720	Oh, the second question by this person.
1206720	1210600	One of my favorite games ever is Pokemon Snap and I've been hoping for years to make a sequel,
1210600	1211600	but to no avail.
1211600	1218160	Are there any other good photography themed games out there that you would recommend?
1218160	1222480	I know Metal Gear Solid 2 had a camera and some of the Zelda games had minigames, but
1222480	1227040	other than that, I don't know anything, especially with photography figures and largely.
1227040	1228040	Keep on rocking.
1228040	1229040	Ciao, Atreyu.
1229040	1230040	I highly recommend.
1230040	1231040	What's with Atreyu tonight?
1231040	1232040	That's just...
1232040	1233040	Atreyu.
1233040	1234040	Wow.
1234040	1235040	Say my name.
1235040	1236040	Bashur.
1236040	1237040	Hey, Bastion.
1237040	1238040	What?
1238040	1241760	I highly recommend Bioshock because you have to take pictures of dead bodies.
1241760	1242760	Dead Rising.
1242760	1243760	Dead Rising.
1243760	1244760	Dead Rising.
1244760	1245760	Dead Rising.
1245760	1246760	An awesome photography mode in there.
1246760	1247760	Good point.
1247760	1248760	Yes.
1248760	1249760	Eternal Sonata actually has...
1249760	1251600	Don't get the card capture soccer at a game on Dreamcast.
1251600	1253460	Eternal Sonata actually has a photograph.
1253460	1258080	One of the characters, their special move, they can take photos and you can control what's
1258080	1261860	taken a picture of and you can sell the photos at shops and the better the picture, the more
1261860	1262860	they sell for.
1262860	1263860	Here's the thing.
1263860	1267280	One of the things I should have said was one of my kind of complaints about the game.
1267280	1270720	It totally throws the game off balance.
1270720	1275000	Weapons and things and the part of the game I'm in are like 800 gold, 1,000 gold maybe.
1275000	1279640	You can sell one picture for 14,000 gold.
1279640	1284400	Gold is not a factor in this game if you just take 10 pictures and sell them all.
1284400	1286280	They don't even have to be that good at pictures.
1286280	1290000	That's one other little bitch I have about Eternal Sonata is that I think somebody threw
1290000	1294080	the photo system way out of whack in testing.
1294080	1296080	Next email?
1296080	1301400	I'm not certain but I believe this is something else from Rob about the man who died after
1301400	1304180	three days straight in the internet cafe in China.
1304180	1307160	The game he played was Online Bridge.
1307160	1313440	How unexciting but it shows that it's self neglect from obsession, not an MMO or other
1313440	1314440	game.
1314440	1315440	Good point.
1315440	1318240	Because most of us automatically think, oh, he was playing Warcraft.
1318240	1320520	No, he was playing Bridge.
1320520	1322360	These people who do online poker or something.
1322360	1323360	It's Final Fantasy XI.
1323360	1324360	It was Evercrack.
1324360	1325360	Evercrack takes another soul.
1325360	1327120	Nope, it was Online Bridge.
1327120	1331800	Hoyle is deadly.
1331800	1332800	So shall I keep going?
1332800	1333800	You shall.
1333800	1337880	Dear OLR, I recently joined a game rental service and decided to rent out Earth Defense
1337880	1343040	Force, although it was the PS2 version since I don't have a 360, to find out whether Loki's
1343040	1345880	claims were accurate or not and they are sort of.
1345880	1346880	The game is fun.
1346880	1351200	It's really fun destroying armies of ants, sorry, gigant horse, is supremely satisfying
1351200	1355720	and the way that you can mold the battlegrounds by destroying the infected city is genius.
1355720	1360700	The variation in weapon types gives the game an element of strategy and all loads extremely
1360700	1363920	quickly very useful on some difficulty levels.
1363920	1368400	I forgot I played more of Earth Defense Force this week as well.
1368400	1371880	Maybe you're just so used to it that it just blends in with the rest of your schedule.
1371880	1372880	Yeah.
1372880	1377320	The game's budget nature is very obvious from the horrible color scheme that makes some
1377320	1382040	levels look like big piles of sludge to the plot, which is basic to say the least.
1382040	1386720	It's common to find the alien invaders trapped in the scenery while the variations in enemy
1386720	1389040	types are small and uninteresting visually.
1389040	1394160	There are some that fly, some that shoot suspicious looking brown stuff from their bottoms, but
1394160	1396120	in the end, they're all ants.
1396120	1399360	Whether these problems are dealt with in the sequel, I don't know, but they don't detract
1399360	1400480	from the game too much.
1400480	1404000	Put simply, the game is a grown-up version of squashing armies of ants like I did when
1404000	1405000	I was a kid.
1405000	1406780	The squashing ants never seems to get old.
1406780	1410800	The Afro guy.
1410800	1412440	I still have yet to play Earth Defense Force.
1412440	1413600	I'm going to have to check it out.
1413600	1419760	I'm telling you, they need, and there's another story we can get to later, they need to bring
1419760	1425560	out the other PlayStation 2 games and convert them over to be able to be played on some
1425560	1430460	of these systems over here because seriously, all the games have been almost exactly the
1430460	1435320	same, just different locations and stuff, but I don't think they get old at all.
1435320	1439480	It's still a very scary thought to me that our reviews and suggestions on games actually
1439480	1440480	influence people.
1440480	1442480	It's kind of scary.
1442480	1446680	Well, speaking of someone wanting some influence, we got an email from the doctor.
1446680	1447680	All right.
1447680	1448680	Hooray.
1448680	1450880	I love the doctor.
1450880	1451880	So I'm going to read it.
1451880	1454120	Hello, I've been somewhat busy.
1454120	1456520	Do you guys remember Shadow of Destiny for the PS2?
1456520	1459940	I can't find it in any GameStop or EB games and I really want to play it again.
1459940	1462600	If you guys remember it, could you possibly give me your thoughts on the game?
1462600	1464140	I didn't play it.
1464140	1466920	And to DarkSakura, I got me a Sonic Screwdriver pen and I love it.
1466920	1469960	I use it at work to write with him and pretend I'm the doctor.
1469960	1472040	I have a Sonic Screwdriver too.
1472040	1476520	One of our listeners sent it to me and I love our listener now forever.
1476520	1478320	I saw the Dalek the other night too.
1478320	1484040	Yes, I have the remote control Dalek that goes for like $100 on eBay and I got it for
1484040	1485040	$40.
1485040	1486040	Nice.
1486040	1487840	Oh, we got another email at the end and it's from Warrior Bob.
1487840	1488840	Wait, hold on.
1488840	1489840	Shadow of Destiny?
1489840	1491440	I didn't play it either.
1491440	1492440	That's kind of weird.
1492440	1493640	There's like this one game we totally like all missed.
1493640	1497360	I was trying to look up screenshots but our net's running slow because of the webcam,
1497360	1498760	so oh well.
1498760	1501320	Well, I'm going to read.
1501320	1505520	Since Warrior Bob got this email in right before, I'm going to read it too because Warrior
1505520	1507560	Bob is like my hero.
1507560	1508560	Shall I?
1508560	1509560	Sure.
1509560	1513800	Dear OLR, I got to play Rockman this week during the demo at Sac State.
1513800	1516760	By now I'm sure you've heard plenty about the game and I won't bug you further but I
1516760	1520480	discovered some things that I thought might be of interest to you, more veteran music
1520480	1521480	game fans.
1521480	1525360	This is a long email so feel free to edit as you choose if you read it out loud.
1525360	1530120	First the game implements what used to be called guessing penalty.
1530120	1534200	Any extra inputs you make beyond what is required of you are counted against you and reset your
1534200	1535200	combo.
1535200	1536200	Good.
1536200	1538740	Fans of drum mania or keyboard mania will notice this first as those two games let you
1538740	1542640	hit as many extra notes as you wanted to without penalizing you and therefore let you improvise
1542640	1543640	a bit.
1543640	1547960	It's a command you can't improvise until you're told to, except sometimes on vocals.
1547960	1553600	Second, the drum pedal on the pre-release units works just like in arcade drum mania.
1553600	1557280	It's big, has a long throw and relatively little resistance and it triggers somewhere
1557280	1560080	near the end of its throw but not all the way at the end.
1560080	1562160	No quick bass rolls with your toes here.
1562160	1568400	Third, the drum pedals connect to the main unit by a 1-8 inch mono foam plugs, basically
1568400	1570840	the mono headphone jack.
1570840	1574120	These work electrically like I think they do, you should be able to wire two of them
1574120	1578020	in parallel using a mono headphone splitter and make a double bass so that you can be
1578020	1580120	the god of thunder.
1580120	1583480	I asked a harmonics dev about this and he said he will try it at the office and get
1583480	1584480	back to me.
1584480	1585920	Fourth, biorite sucks.
1585920	1587640	Yes, they do.
1587640	1590800	Fifth, there is a crazy advanced slide compensation tool built in-
1590800	1593600	Wait, he just threw that in the middle there?
1593600	1594600	Yes, it's true.
1594600	1595600	This is why you love Warrior Bob.
1595600	1596600	It's damn true.
1596600	1598480	Didn't they go out of business?
1598480	1599480	I think so.
1599480	1600480	Then stop hatin'.
1600480	1601480	Stop hatin'.
1601480	1602480	I still hate them, Rob.
1602480	1608680	Fifth, there is a crazy advanced slide compensation tool built in case your TV internally de-syncs
1608680	1609680	audio and video.
1609680	1610680	I love harmonics.
1610680	1614400	Lastly, the new guitar buttons and switches feel very solid and responsive.
1614400	1619160	This drum bar is a bit longer now and does not use clicky micro switches but still seems
1619160	1620160	to be pretty accurate.
1620160	1624600	I have experimentally verified that it works well played behind your head and between your
1624600	1625600	legs.
1625600	1628360	Looking forward to your next show tonight, Warrior Bob.
1628360	1633520	Yes, see, mine must have been busted from constant use or something.
1633520	1634520	Someone must have broke it.
1634520	1640560	Who knows what kind of, I don't know, drunk middle-aged people were playing it at the
1640560	1644160	event that I went to, but it's fun.
1644160	1645880	Sounds like fun.
1645880	1647320	Is that it for email?
1647320	1648720	That be all, sir.
1648720	1649720	Goodbye, email bag.
1649720	1650720	R.
1650720	1651720	Send us more.
1651720	1652720	Mailbag, orange.onstrator.com.
1652720	1653720	You know what we have missed, though?
1653720	1654720	What?
1654720	1655720	Talk Like a Pirate Day?
1655720	1656720	Talk Like a Pirate Day.
1656720	1657720	I was just thinking because you said R. I was like, did you celebrate?
1657720	1662760	I did by making a one-line comment in my live journal.
1662760	1663760	It was Talk Like a Pirate Day.
1663760	1668880	I was off that day, so I made a pirate and slept in my cabin.
1668880	1671520	I was doing other pirate related things.
1671520	1673880	I was pirating comic books.
1673880	1679240	I sent an email to all my coworkers with something from I Can Ask Cheeseburger that I said you
1679240	1682720	better have a good and productive work day today or else I'm going to send you to the
1682720	1687080	captain because it was Talk Like a Pirate Day and it was a little kitty that had a little
1687080	1688720	hook and a pirate hat on it.
1688720	1689720	I know that picture.
1689720	1690720	It said something like...
1690720	1691720	I can have booty.
1691720	1694400	No, it said something like, why you laughing?
1694400	1695400	Walk plank.
1695400	1696400	Or I said walk plank or something like that.
1696400	1698440	It was really funny, so I sent that to my coworkers.
1698440	1699440	That's how I celebrated.
1699440	1700440	Yeah, I'm lame.
1700440	1701440	Shut up.
1701440	1702440	Let's see.
1702440	1703440	I was going to chat.
1703440	1704440	Oh, yeah.
1704440	1709120	Chat's commenting on things that they're watching on the operator 11 feed and Phildo wants to
1709120	1713160	know why doesn't Loki get a comfy chair because Loki gets one of the kitchen chairs to sit
1713160	1714160	in here.
1714160	1715160	They can't...
1715160	1716160	It's a far sight more comfy than the one that was there.
1716160	1720640	Yeah, the unfortunate one that was here is this crappy computer desk chair that was actually
1720640	1725480	slanted forward and had even less padding than this piece of wood.
1725480	1729120	Now I know I'm not supposed to show Jamie on the cam and I won't, but I can show that
1729120	1732400	she gets a fancy little blue chair to sit on.
1732400	1735800	So you can see I'm showing her feet on the footstool.
1735800	1739920	You can see this fancy little chair that she gets to sit in and that's why Loki has to
1739920	1746320	take the crappy chair because the woman took the nice chair, I guess, is how it goes.
1746320	1749640	So there you have it.
1749640	1755240	Anyhow, moving on to another story because I don't want this to turn into too much TV
1755240	1758640	or else folks are going to go crazy.
1758640	1760640	Loki, what's up next?
1760640	1768040	Anywho, so of course pretty soon we're going to be getting a Project Gotham Racing 4 demo
1768040	1772200	and it's going to have content, I guess, that's exclusive to the demo itself.
1772200	1777600	In fact, I guess there's supposed to be some electric versus gas engine race that they're
1777600	1778600	going to be doing.
1778600	1784280	There's also going to be arcade mode, which is going to be exclusive to it, set in Makau,
1784280	1789560	I guess, Makau, and it's going to feature exclusive challenges.
1789560	1793840	So I guess that's kind of neat that it's going to have that.
1793840	1801680	They're also going to feature a time trial for, it looks like a Nurburgring Snow and
1801680	1809160	it's, yeah, it says it's due out, well the game I know is due out in what, two weeks?
1809160	1811760	So the demo's got to be coming out here pretty soon I'd imagine.
1811760	1814920	It's kind of weird that the demo would have something special.
1814920	1821240	It would be kind of cool if whatever content was in the demo you could get in the game
1821240	1823160	because you downloaded the demo.
1823160	1824160	Like some type of unlock.
1824160	1825160	I don't know.
1825160	1830520	Well it's just like what they did with, what was it, Ninja Gaiden Sigma, where you earn
1830520	1837480	money in the game and then you can transfer it over to your save on the full retail version.
1837480	1840080	Interesting.
1840080	1846480	Well, one thing on the Xbox 360 that some folks were doing on Talk Like a Pirate Day
1846480	1851360	was doing some piracy of their own and it was leaking Halo 3 onto the internet.
1851360	1858080	Yes, that's right, Halo 3 made its way to some where's sites, 6.14 gigabytes is how
1858080	1860760	big the game clocks in as.
1860760	1866540	And of course, you know, kind of sucks that people are doing this and taking away from
1866540	1870520	the folks that have spent so much hard time and effort developing the game.
1870520	1875680	But at the same time, kind of impressive that they did it that fast.
1875680	1879320	But yeah, that's just a gift for releasing the game.
1879320	1882640	Well also, you know it's only going to be a matter of time before Microsoft figures
1882640	1884880	out how it's done and puts a little ban on it.
1884880	1888720	Or did they finally figure out some way that Microsoft can't patch its way out of?
1888720	1892000	Because I thought Microsoft liked to put down the ban hammer on this stuff and patch it.
1892000	1897160	There's ways, I guess, because I don't pirate 360 games, so there's ways I've read that
1897160	1900280	you can patch the game where it's undetectable.
1900280	1904960	I think all of it's done, I mean it's going to be hard for them to do that because they
1904960	1909280	have some sort of encryption on there, so if that's cracked, then the only other thing
1909280	1913920	is there's a media detector or something like that that detects whether you're playing
1913920	1921120	a CD-R, a DVD-R, a press CD, DVD, etc.
1921120	1926060	And if you can change that, if you can get that to go over so that makes a DVD-R look
1926060	1931820	like a press DVD, then really the system's going to have no way of telling whether that's
1931820	1939840	a burned disc or an actual copy of Halo 3.
1939840	1945200	At one point, it is going to be impossible to stop it unless they change up something
1945200	1947240	else or that you can't crack them.
1947240	1951480	Remember, for the longest time, PlayStation 2 games, with that bad blocks that they put
1951480	1955800	on there so that you can't burn them, that stopped people for a while, but eventually
1955800	1960000	they figured out how to get around that, so it's only a matter of time before that happens,
1960000	1961000	if it hasn't already.
1961000	1965400	Yeah, but, I mean, when they try to take these things online, won't it kind of screw it
1965400	1966400	up?
1966400	1970900	No, I mean, the game, if they don't, if the system can't tell that it's not an official
1970900	1973720	game, then no, there won't be any problems.
1973720	1980520	It's if you run a special firmware or something that disables that checking, that's when
1980520	1985680	you're going to run into problems, but if the system itself cannot tell that, you know,
1985680	1991160	it's a burned copy and you haven't modified it in any way, then, yeah, you will be able
1991160	1992720	to get away with it.
1992720	1993720	Hmm.
1993720	1994720	Interesting.
1994720	2000320	All right, well, I imagine, though, it's just a small percentage, a very, very, very small
2000320	2003600	percentage of people that are able to get away with this, and the game will still sell
2003600	2005000	like hotcakes the day it was released.
2005000	2006520	Yeah, they're going to make tons of money.
2006520	2007760	That's not a problem.
2007760	2011600	And besides, the people that are pirating it probably had no intention to buy it in
2011600	2012600	the first place.
2012600	2015200	And, Loki, you did not get banned for playing Halo 3 early, right?
2015200	2016520	No, I did not.
2016520	2019800	The only thing, here's the only thing that they did do is the matchmaking servers aren't
2019800	2022360	up, so you can't play online.
2022360	2024240	Oh, noes.
2024240	2025240	Right now.
2025240	2027240	Until they start them.
2027240	2034360	Well, something that you can play online on Xbox Live is Viva Pinata Party, the demo is
2034360	2035360	up.
2035360	2038760	No, Viva Pinata Party Animals is up, I'm sorry.
2038760	2044320	It's 971.17 megabytes.
2044320	2048360	It's basically a big minigame compilation, and it's, of course, by Rare.
2048360	2053600	So the official game is going to be out by Christmas with over 40 minigames, and you
2053600	2060040	can burp boats down a stream and smash up gardens.
2060040	2061720	Wow.
2061720	2064120	Burping boats is just so much fun, you know.
2064120	2069120	It's a, I think it's a racing game mixed with minigames.
2069120	2073280	Escapist in our chatroom asks, will someone be proposing on that one as well?
2073280	2076960	You know, funny story.
2076960	2080700	Sometimes I forget that there's actually quite a few people who listen to this program, not
2080700	2084240	to sound like you could do this or whatever, but when we first started the program, we
2084240	2087340	were lucky to get like 15 people listening to our show.
2087340	2091600	And since we've been doing the podcast, the numbers have climbed a little bit.
2091600	2095560	And you remember last week we did that story about the guy who got engaged on Viva Pinata.
2095560	2096560	Well, guess what?
2096560	2097840	He sent us a message on MySpace.
2097840	2098840	Did he?
2098840	2100080	Yes, he did.
2100080	2104760	He said, he actually wants to come on the show to, what did he say, correct some of
2104760	2109760	the things that the bloggers who, you know, live with their parents and stay at home all
2109760	2111000	day got wrong.
2111000	2112000	And I'm like, great.
2112000	2113520	I totally want to hear it from the horse's mouth.
2113520	2115600	So I'm hoping we have him on next week or soon.
2115600	2120480	I wanted to get him on this week, but he really wanted to do an interview on iChat, and unfortunately
2120480	2124560	the way we're wired where we have the Mac laptop does our Operate 11 stuff and the PC
2124560	2128120	does most of the audio here, it just wouldn't work for me to do iChat.
2128120	2131060	But I'm hoping we can call him this week and get him on the show next week.
2131060	2136440	So if you're listening, Mr. Pinata, let's make that interview happen this week so you
2136440	2137440	can clear the air.
2137440	2141040	I still think it's kind of retarded, but we'll go a little bit there.
2141040	2146200	It's like there's people who propose, though, on the big screens, though, but that I sort
2146200	2149120	of feel like you're pressuring someone into saying yes.
2149120	2150120	Well it's just...
2150120	2152460	It's in a public place like that?
2152460	2153460	But I don't think it was.
2153460	2154460	It was in their home.
2154460	2155600	Well, if it's in their home, that's one thing.
2155600	2157440	Well, we'll find out soon.
2157440	2160880	We're going to ask all the questions.
2160880	2167480	Part of me kind of goes, is this really big to be on all these different blogs?
2167480	2170800	I mean, this is kind of a private matter in a way, but I don't know.
2170800	2171800	We'll see.
2171800	2172800	We'll see.
2172800	2173800	We'll get our questions answered.
2173800	2175440	I'm excited.
2175440	2178360	Back to the gaming news, then.
2178360	2179360	Yes.
2179360	2185520	Anyways, one thing I'm excited about, as I hinted before, the Simple series is possibly
2185520	2189160	coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
2189160	2196600	According to some digging done during Tokyo Game Show, the Simple 2000 series, which of
2196600	2202320	course brought us wonderful games, much like Earth Defense Force, they're talking about
2202320	2208980	releasing some of them on, of course, the online service, and possibly also the Playstation
2208980	2210480	network as well.
2210480	2215680	And according to Kotaku's article here, it says they're asking about the possibility
2215680	2223200	of the series turning up as downloadable titles, and they said that they had two cheap, easy
2223200	2229960	games coming out on Xbox Live Arcade soon, so maybe we'll see some more stuff from that
2229960	2230960	series come over.
2230960	2235880	I hope they port some of that stuff, because there's some weird shit over there, like Zombies
2235880	2241400	versus Abulances, and more shit like that.
2241400	2242400	Awesome.
2242400	2243400	Gotta love it.
2243400	2245320	Well, you gotta love this, too.
2245320	2247320	I know Loki loves this.
2247320	2248520	Lesbians!
2248520	2250200	I do love me some lesbians.
2250200	2251200	Oh, lesbians.
2251200	2252680	Then you'll definitely want to pick up Mass Effect.
2252680	2253800	I was already going to pick it up.
2253800	2255360	It's like the icing on the cake.
2255360	2259880	Well, apparently, Mass Effect has been causing some waves in the gaming blogs and the gaming
2259880	2266000	news sites this week, because apparently, if you play as a female character, there is
2266000	2269960	a sex scene that you can initiate in the game, and you can initiate this scene between her
2269960	2274200	and a male human or a female humanoid alien.
2274200	2277960	So you get some female on female action.
2277960	2278960	But here's the thing, though.
2278960	2284020	You can also play as a male character, however, a male character can only initiate sex between
2284020	2290000	him and a human woman or the humanoid female alien.
2290000	2294360	So no man sex, but Lesbo's okay.
2294360	2296360	But surprise, butt sex is great.
2296360	2299400	Well, here's another thing, okay?
2299400	2300400	Just a thought.
2300400	2304040	Maybe the storyline, it's between these two women anyways.
2304040	2306820	It's either pick one or the other, something like that.
2306820	2311240	Maybe because your character, they didn't make a branching type of storyline or something
2311240	2312280	for this one part.
2312280	2313280	I see.
2313280	2317360	So you're saying this lesbian sex is for artistic and story purposes?
2317360	2320960	It's like the character in the game or something.
2320960	2325760	For example, wasn't there something in Knights of the Old Republic or Jade Empire or something
2325760	2327840	like that where they had something similar?
2327840	2333080	I think it was Knights of the Old Republic II or maybe the first one, where if you played
2333080	2336520	as a female character, then yeah, it would be a lesbian.
2336520	2339820	Almost like your partner or something had some love interest with you, and so it's sort
2339820	2342080	of lesbian since you're playing as a female character.
2342080	2345840	But really what it was is that they didn't program any different responses between a
2345840	2348200	male and female character.
2348200	2356120	Well, even though I still really want this game, the lack of man sex makes this gay man
2356120	2357200	a little bit angsty.
2357200	2358200	So you know what that means.
2358200	2361640	It's time to bring on the FUs of the week!
2361640	2373080	Dr. Sakura, why don't you start us off?
2373080	2376760	I know lack of gay sex makes you mad.
2376760	2385720	Well, yeah, but FU to male drivers, especially stupid old men, and men who drive big trucks
2385720	2388000	and SUVs.
2388000	2392640	Every last bad driver I've encountered on the road has been male.
2392640	2397100	First of all, when I was picking up Dan from the airport yesterday, there was a guy driving
2397100	2403480	in Altima, and he was drifting into my lane, and I didn't know if he was just changing
2403480	2407700	lanes without signaling or if he was just old and stupid.
2407700	2412960	He seemed to me in about middle age, but he almost bumped me off the road until I banged
2412960	2415360	on the horn, and his wife shook him awake.
2415360	2420440	He couldn't have been more than 50, so he wasn't that old.
2420440	2424840	But I was like, you stupid man!
2424840	2429640	And then this guy driving a truck, cutting off everybody in front of him, just being
2429640	2435440	an asshole driver, which I consider being an asshole driver is pretty much equivalent
2435440	2440220	with being a bad driver, because you're supposed to maintain your cool and calm on the road.
2440220	2443720	And if you do get angry, you're not supposed to let it affect how you drive.
2443720	2448080	This guy was cutting off everybody left and right, he made one car swerve, and I did thankfully
2448080	2450840	get to see him get pulled over.
2450840	2454400	I saw an asshole driver get pulled over this week, and it was very satisfying.
2454400	2459540	And then, you know, I saw so many people just changing lanes without signaling, and almost
2459540	2464340	causing accidents, and you know, every last one of them happened to be male.
2464340	2469120	So I would like to point out there that bad drivers are bad drivers regardless of gender,
2469120	2470920	shut the fuck up.
2470920	2472800	Next, please.
2472800	2478240	Anyways, I didn't really have anything to make an FU for, but now I do!
2478240	2483720	So um, yes, once again, women drivers, horrible, in fact, I bet that guy falling asleep is
2483720	2488440	probably falling asleep from nagging from his wife, so you know, I blame her for that.
2488440	2493880	But yeah, there are a lot of bad drivers, especially SUV drivers, cell phone drivers,
2493880	2496520	and cell phone drivers are even worse than stupid men.
2496520	2502320	And a combination of those as well, so, lucky the bad drivers, no matter which sex, may
2502320	2503320	or may not.
2503320	2504320	Mainly women drivers.
2504320	2506920	Hey, cell phone drivers are the worst.
2506920	2507920	Sorry, Rob.
2507920	2513040	Uh, well that's alright, I don't, I have my Bluetooth now, so it doesn't matter.
2513040	2514040	Yes.
2514040	2517240	Although I never got in an accident while talking into phone and driving, it's an urban
2517240	2518240	legend.
2518240	2522680	Um, it's made up, just like how man actually went to the moon, it's all made up, those
2522680	2523680	cell phones.
2523680	2529760	Uh, what was I gonna say, I don't really have a whole lot of FUs, so I'll just say, um,
2529760	2537040	I don't know, the FU to lack of angst this week, I'm actually in a pretty good mood,
2537040	2539920	FU to the million and one projects I have at work.
2539920	2543400	I have so many projects at work, I'm all project out.
2543400	2546960	Projects are work of the devil, and I have too many of them.
2546960	2547960	That's it.
2547960	2549200	A rather tame FU this week.
2549200	2553040	So there you have it, another successful FUs of the Week segment.
2553040	2555440	I have one last thing I was just gonna add in there real quick.
2555440	2556440	Oh lordy.
2556440	2560760	FU to the Halo 3 launch because I fucking hate having to deal with customers asking
2560760	2562400	about when they're gonna get Halo 3.
2562400	2563400	Absolutely hate it.
2563400	2565520	You'll get it when it's good and ready.
2565520	2566520	Exactly.
2566520	2569240	That's how you should respond to them too.
2569240	2572160	Alright, back to some gaming news.
2572160	2582160	Well, um, anyone who is interested in watching movies and things on Xbox Live will be happy,
2582160	2586440	as an anime fan at least, will be happy to know that S.T.A.R.S. is bringing different
2586440	2587440	shows.
2587440	2593600	We are getting Ghost in the Shell, Stand Alone Complex, Both Seasons, Street Fighter 2V,
2593600	2598320	Noian, Toko, Virus, and Astro Boy.
2598320	2601380	There's actually a bunch more.
2601380	2611000	Some of the other ones that were listed is, well, at least they have particular access
2611000	2616840	to was like Blood the Last Vampire, A Different Loop in the Third, Appleseed, Blood the Last
2616840	2621000	Vampire, Ninja Scroll, Perfect Blue, I love Perfect Blue.
2621000	2624160	Just different series.
2624160	2627080	I haven't seen a single one of those series you mentioned.
2627080	2630080	Perfect Blue was like, oh my god, Head Trip.
2630080	2632160	I've seen it twice in the theater.
2632160	2633280	Perfect Blue was weird.
2633280	2635080	Perfect Blue was awesome.
2635080	2640920	Anyway, some people are not so happy about NHL 2K8 charging you $5 to unlock a feature
2640920	2642920	that's already on the game.
2642920	2651600	This feature, of course, is actually the 2K real maker add-on, and it will allow you to
2651600	2657120	do a variety of video recording and playback options for the game, but the download was
2657120	2663200	a puny 108K, which means that you're just paying for an unlock key for something that's
2663200	2665640	already on the disc.
2665640	2670240	That being said, at the same time, you don't have to buy it, and it was 400 Microsoft points
2670240	2675440	or $5 in real money.
2675440	2676740	That is kind of shitty.
2676740	2679520	It is shitty, but here's the thing.
2679520	2680520	Don't buy it.
2680520	2683520	If people don't buy it, they will stop doing stuff like that.
2683520	2684800	But people keep buying this shit.
2684800	2685800	You know what's funny?
2685800	2687120	Eternal Sonata has something like that, too.
2687120	2689420	Eternal Sonata has a theme that you can just unlock.
2689420	2694640	I think it's you get all the piano score pieces in the game, which you would unlock naturally
2694640	2698640	just by playing it anyway, if you have the patience to play it the whole way through.
2698640	2703240	But I'm thinking, in sports games is one thing, but a game like Eternal Sonata, if you don't
2703240	2707840	have the patience to play it the whole way through, what the fuck did you buy it for?
2707840	2711040	I mean, really.
2711040	2715040	Sports games, you play over and over and over again in little bursts, but a game like Eternal
2715040	2717240	Sonata is really meant to be played start to finish.
2717240	2718240	So what good does this...
2718240	2720640	I don't know, it doesn't make sense.
2720640	2725160	They're just hoping for people to buy these things at a push of a button.
2725160	2730280	What does make a little more sense is buying things that were not included with the original
2730280	2732840	game, such as new outfits.
2732840	2736760	This is pretty interesting, is that Bomberman Live is going to be getting a new download
2736760	2737760	pack.
2737760	2739900	Actually, I believe it's already up, this new download pack they have.
2739900	2745200	One of the characters that's in the download pack is based off of the mascot from Destructoid.com,
2745200	2747280	which of course is another gaming blog.
2747280	2751440	We had some of those guys on our year-end show a while ago, we'll have to have them
2751440	2752440	back sometime.
2752440	2757520	But yeah, they've crossed over from gaming press blog site into video game character
2757520	2760960	with their little mascot, that green little robot face thing that they...
2760960	2764080	Actually, I thought it was silver in some of the pictures I've seen, but whatever.
2764080	2769180	Color be damned, the little mascot has certainly made a name for itself now by crossing over
2769180	2774200	into a OMG legitimate video game.
2774200	2778800	So where's the giant Loki head for future expansions or something like that?
2778800	2782360	People would argue there would have to be a Tingle head, because they're fascinated
2782360	2783360	with the character Tingle.
2783360	2784360	Oh, then that wouldn't work.
2784360	2785720	I do not understand this, but whatever.
2785720	2789200	Then that wouldn't work, because you're crossing over, you know, Nintendo, and then that's
2789200	2790200	like mixing...
2790200	2793680	Then they would say, oh, he should be in Super Smash Brothers Brawl, you know, as Tingle,
2793680	2794680	dressed up as Tingle.
2794680	2795680	Yeah, there you go.
2795680	2796680	That's like mixing...
2796680	2797680	That's an awesome idea.
2797680	2798680	Why don't we make that happen?
2798680	2799680	No, just kidding.
2799680	2800680	No, it's not an awesome idea.
2800680	2802200	That's like mixing the matter with antimatter.
2802200	2804000	I don't know.
2804000	2808320	Escapist in our chat room asks, if Destructoid can do it, why not Bomberman based on the
2808320	2809320	OLR staff?
2809320	2811120	Well, that's a very nice thought.
2811120	2814800	I'm sure, A, Destructoid gets like a million more hits in a month than we do.
2814800	2818840	You know, we're just a tiny little show in somebody's spare bedroom, whereas Destructoid
2818840	2820960	is like, you know, they've come a long way.
2820960	2822440	They've only been around, what, like a year and a half?
2822440	2824400	They've come a long way.
2824400	2829760	B, I seem to recall that a couple weeks ago, I don't know if it was their E3 coverage or
2829760	2835960	they had some coverage of some expo that was sponsored by Bomberman and they had like ads
2835960	2836960	all over their site.
2836960	2840480	So they had some type of relationship going on with the folks that made Bomberman.
2840480	2843160	So, you know, that's kind of cool though and I'm not going to...
2843160	2845040	I think it's awesome what happened.
2845040	2851720	And I love the fact that the Microsoft community as a whole is really seeming to embrace the
2851720	2853600	community more and more.
2853600	2860440	You know, some of our other buddy podcasts, such as the Gamerscore blog and Gamertag Radio,
2860440	2862360	what are all those guys called together?
2862360	2863360	Gamercast.
2863360	2865480	They all have their own pictures up on the marketplace.
2865480	2866480	That's pretty rad.
2866480	2869200	Hopefully we'll see more of those very soon.
2869200	2870320	Yes.
2870320	2874640	Anyhow, back to the gaming news.
2874640	2882400	Well, something that should interest a few people, especially that are mobile phone gamers,
2882400	2890400	coming out will be Rockman Dash, which is one of the Mega Man Legends series.
2890400	2894320	It's a new Rockman Dash game and those fuckers didn't put it on a damn console that I can
2894320	2895320	play.
2895320	2896320	I hate the...
2896320	2897320	Cell phones do not need more games.
2897320	2900200	I hate the Mega Man Legends games.
2900200	2908440	There's also Resident Evil 4 mobile edition, Devil May Cry Dante vs. Virgil, Sengoku Basara,
2908440	2913200	Tactical RPG, and Breath of Fire 4.
2913200	2918000	I wouldn't mind having Breath of Fire 4 on my phone, but anyway, that's all Japanese
2918000	2919000	only right now.
2919000	2922840	Yeah, but it's mobile phones, so who cares?
2922840	2923840	I care.
2923840	2924840	I play Lumines on my phone.
2924840	2925840	Really?
2925840	2926840	Yes.
2926840	2927840	Really?
2927840	2928840	Why?
2928840	2934800	Because, first of all, I can sneak around outside at work and play it, and it's actually
2934800	2935800	not too bad.
2935800	2937360	Actually, I enjoyed Lumines on mobile phones, too.
2937360	2938360	I have to be honest.
2938360	2940000	I'm going to load it up right now.
2940000	2941000	I'll play it during a show.
2941000	2942480	Well, you have fun with that, Miss Thing.
2942480	2944480	I will.
2944480	2952080	Anyways, so, maybe you're looking to find that special someone to eventually proclaim
2952080	2954960	your love over Viva Pinata 2.
2954960	2957080	Well, fear not.
2957080	2962940	We're here to help you, and thanks to the Sexy Video Game Land blog, they have compiled
2962940	2964600	a list of what they think are...
2964600	2967240	What a great blog name, by the way, might I add.
2967240	2975720	The best video game pickup lines, and here are some to run by you guys, including, What
2975720	2980080	do you say I take my flag to your base and score?
2980080	2982760	So you ever been in a five-man raid?
2982760	2988440	Hey, baby, I need a new hoe, and it ain't for gardening.
2988440	2990080	How does that have anything to do with video games?
2990080	2991080	It's Harvest Moon.
2991080	2992080	Oh, God.
2992080	2993760	That's so stupid.
2993760	2999880	Let me call you Silent Hill, because things will really get freaky when I'm inside you.
2999880	3004960	I know how Mario must feel, because I really want to clean your pipes.
3004960	3009520	Call me Ash, because I choose you.
3009520	3012520	There's a warp zone in my pants.
3012520	3013520	I made that one up.
3013520	3014520	Oh, let's see.
3014520	3015880	You're just like an RPG.
3015880	3022520	I can't wait to take you home, unwrap you, put it in, and then grind away until sun rises.
3022520	3026800	Girl, you got me like WarioWare, I'm touched.
3026800	3027880	That's stupid.
3027880	3032360	You can't be Phoenix Wright, because I have no objection to you, baby.
3032360	3033360	Okay.
3033360	3035800	Those are awful.
3035800	3040920	If you're a devil, you may cry by the time I'm finished with you.
3040920	3044240	You remind me of a game of Tetris.
3044240	3046440	You always want the long ones.
3046440	3047440	What?
3047440	3050360	That doesn't even make sense.
3050360	3051360	That's stupid.
3051360	3058120	Hey, baby, can I hide my solid snake in your box?
3058120	3060200	That makes me want to throw up a little.
3060200	3062320	I think I did just throw up in my mouth.
3062320	3064960	Now, see, our chat room's joining in now.
3064960	3066960	Did you throw up in your stomach, Rob?
3066960	3067960	Huh?
3067960	3068960	Did you throw up in your stomach?
3068960	3069960	Shut up.
3069960	3072920	DJ Dark Knight says, back me wool, baby.
3072920	3074760	That's an old OLR joke.
3074760	3079960	Rama says, hey, baby, how about I dance dance to your revolution and you beat my mania?
3079960	3081440	Okay.
3081440	3085640	GS68 says, you must play 2DX because you've got me on hard mode.
3085640	3089720	I don't like that one, that one's funny.
3089720	3091720	Warrior Bob says, you remind me of Tetris.
3091720	3093080	I just want to make you disappear.
3093080	3096720	I mean, wait, have sex with me.
3096720	3098120	I like that one.
3098120	3102800	My favorite pickup line was always, hi, I like peanut butter, want to fuck?
3102800	3108680	Or how about this one, babe, you're hotter than my first edition 360s power supply.
3108680	3109680	That's lame.
3109680	3110680	Stupid.
3110680	3111680	Wow.
3111680	3112680	Lame.
3112680	3118720	Baby, you could screw attack me all night long.
3118720	3124480	Anyhow, Jiranami says, you must play Tetris because you're stacked.
3124480	3126240	That one's actually kind of good.
3126240	3127240	Not bad.
3127240	3128720	Jiranami has a funny joke once in a while.
3128720	3129720	All right, moving on, please.
3129720	3130720	Add it to the toilet paper.
3130720	3133200	For the love of God, a new story, please.
3133200	3136280	From video game pickup lines from, what was that, Sexy Game Blog?
3136280	3137280	What was it called?
3137280	3138280	Sexy Game Land Blog.
3138280	3140360	Sexy Game Land Blog, nice.
3140360	3146640	Moving on to something completely different, political stuffs, and that would be Mitt Romney
3146640	3147640	specifically.
3147640	3148640	You might know him.
3148640	3151840	He's a Mormon guy, right, running for president on a Republican ticket?
3151840	3154120	I don't keep up with too many Republicans.
3154120	3156520	Very staunch conservative fellow.
3156520	3163440	Well, he has once called video games, quote, a cesspool of violence, sex, drugs, indolence,
3163440	3165040	and perversions.
3165040	3170880	So imagine the irony and hilarity when you notice the Mitt Romney ad campaign ad start
3170880	3174280	showing up on gametrailers.com.
3174280	3180800	That's right, a joystick snapped a picture of gametrailers.com site with, and it's not
3180800	3181800	a Photoshop thing.
3181800	3182800	It's the real deal.
3182800	3186760	It's the game trailer's little logo there and the Mitt Romney ad right on top of the
3186760	3187760	site.
3187760	3191400	Hilarity that their campaign would be advertising on the site.
3191400	3198240	Now let's see, I'm going to go for the obvious here and say that probably there are people
3198240	3203760	or whatever bought into a package deal or some type of advertising company that distributes
3203760	3208280	through all these different websites and game trailers just happens to be one of many.
3208280	3212840	Because doesn't MTV own game trailers, I want to say, or there's some type of partnership
3212840	3213840	there?
3213840	3214840	I could be wrong.
3214840	3215840	I don't remember.
3215840	3220920	But yeah, there's probably some much bigger thing and just showed up on that site.
3220920	3221920	That's kind of funny.
3221920	3224040	That's karma for you.
3224040	3226280	This is why we don't do banner ads on orangeontrader.com.
3226280	3229720	This is also why we're poor, I'd just like to point out.
3229720	3232500	But irony for the win in this case.
3232500	3234960	So there you have it.
3234960	3239440	Well, here is a little bit more for anyone who wants.
3239440	3242960	Yakuza 2 is coming out in the US.
3242960	3248760	Dinosaur King and Mystery Dungeon is also coming out thanks to Sega.
3248760	3256440	So they are supposed to be coming out in 2008 and I think that's going to be very cool because
3256440	3259880	I honestly want, I actually was looking into a little bit on Mystery Dungeon.
3259880	3262680	It's Sheeran the Wanderer.
3262680	3265800	Dinosaur King is a game where you collect 100 dinosaurs with different moves and you
3265800	3267960	make them fight.
3267960	3274840	And wow, I just won Yakuza 2 so I can go around beating people up.
3274840	3276000	You just like violence.
3276000	3277000	I do like violence.
3277000	3279800	I like beating up people wearing nice suits.
3279800	3285000	Alright, those games coming to you very soon from Sega.
3285000	3287400	Also coming to you very soon, the Skype line.
3287400	3294080	You can give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.
3294080	3295880	We love to be interactive.
3295880	3297920	But one more story for you real quick.
3297920	3300920	Yeah, I like being interactive alright.
3300920	3304320	Anyways, enough with the pick up line, seriously.
3304320	3307960	Although I have to say this, SSJ100Matt sent me a message and says that there should be
3307960	3312520	a voicemail challenge for people to leave pick up lines on the Skype line voicemail.
3312520	3314080	Do you want some hot coffee?
3314080	3316320	Yeah, so please, I love that idea.
3316320	3321560	So please call, if you give our number a call either on Skype or the phone number when we're
3321560	3324880	not live, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3324880	3328560	Leave us a message with your sexy video game pick up line and we'll play some of our favorites
3328560	3331040	on next week's show but I bet you we don't get any.
3331040	3339200	Anyways, in case you had hopes and dreams that that wonderful Halo 3 Legendary Edition
3339200	3344720	game box was actually going to become a brand new helmet for your cat, unfortunately that
3344720	3353040	will not be the case because the helmet itself, as IGN found out, is not hollowed and will
3353040	3356560	not fit on your cat.
3356560	3357560	That sucks.
3357560	3361160	I can't put the helmet on my cat and watch my cat run into walls.
3361160	3364040	But I mean, with some simple modding you probably could do that.
3364040	3365960	Oh wait, I don't own a cat.
3365960	3367960	I own a cat.
3367960	3372360	There's no way a cat would put their head in that anyways.
3372360	3374560	Could we put the helmet on the ferret?
3374560	3377560	Yeah, that would look weird though.
3377560	3378840	That we might be able to pull off.
3378840	3381200	I bet Shermie's little head would fit in it.
3381200	3382200	She's got a small brain.
3382200	3383200	Are you kidding?
3383200	3385120	Shermie's the fattest cat I've ever seen.
3385120	3387320	But her brain is very small.
3387320	3390960	Cats aren't dumb enough to put their head in there.
3390960	3393960	Alright, our Skype line is open if you want to call.
3393960	3400200	Give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.
3400200	3403560	And while we wait for some calls, last minute stories.
3403560	3410780	Yes, this is very interesting, well not for me, but for maybe Rob, apparently if you were
3410780	3416280	looking for some man sex type game or whatever, there's Duel Love which is going to be coming
3416280	3423240	to the DS and it includes a part of the game where you scrub down a naked man.
3423240	3427840	Oh god, I saw a preview for that on some website.
3427840	3429760	It looks stupid.
3429760	3430760	Somebody sent me a link to it.
3430760	3431760	It looks stupid.
3431760	3432760	Anyway, we're getting some phone calls.
3432760	3434200	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3434200	3435200	Who's this?
3435200	3436200	Oh, this is Warrior Bob.
3436200	3437200	How's it going?
3437200	3438200	I'm Warrior Bob.
3438200	3439200	It's good.
3439200	3440200	How about you?
3440200	3441200	Not too bad.
3441200	3442200	Long time, no chat.
3442200	3443320	Yeah, serious.
3443320	3445200	So we read your email about the rock band.
3445200	3446200	Good times.
3446200	3447200	Yeah, thank you.
3447200	3449600	Loki went down and played it, but I missed out.
3449600	3450880	I totally forgot.
3450880	3453080	Oh, when was he there?
3453080	3454080	Today.
3454080	3455680	Oh, that's why I didn't see you.
3455680	3457960	Were you there like all day or something?
3457960	3461660	I was there most of the day, Thursday and Friday because I had a group of friends going
3461660	3462880	and I figured, eh, why not?
3462880	3465400	But you went to the Sac State one, right?
3465400	3466400	That's right.
3466400	3467840	Loki went to the Ribs and what was it, Ribfest?
3467840	3469440	The Rhythm and Ribs Fest.
3469440	3471440	Rhythm and Ribs.
3471440	3472440	I should have gone to that.
3472440	3473440	I love Ribs.
3473440	3474440	That's awesome.
3474440	3478520	I went to the one on Friday where I had the work and unfortunately I only went until six.
3478520	3481680	Unfortunately a rib festival doesn't work very well for someone who's trying to be more
3481680	3483680	vegetarian but what have you.
3483680	3484680	Anyway.
3484680	3485960	I'm unemployed so Friday was a great day.
3485960	3486960	Ah, gotcha.
3486960	3487960	What would you call in about tonight?
3487960	3488960	What's on your mind?
3488960	3492280	Well, so, I figured it's the first time I've gotten to listen to your show live in a few
3492280	3497240	years so I'd figure I'll take some of your advice.
3497240	3499480	I've been playing the Guardian Legend while I'm listening.
3499480	3500480	Yay!
3500480	3501480	Awesome.
3501480	3502480	What do you think?
3502480	3507760	It's fun and I can't put my finger on it but what in God's name am I supposed to be doing?
3507760	3512440	Wandering around, you fight things and collect the power-ups and then you go into the different
3512440	3519700	levels and the levels are numbered by like one, twenty-one, two, you know, they back
3519700	3520700	and forth.
3520700	3521700	I think it's one, eleven.
3521700	3527360	Yeah, one, eleven and your last two levels are ten and twenty and they are fucking hard.
3527360	3531320	Here's the thing is that you walk around the Zelda-ish world looking for where the corridors
3531320	3537600	are and the first few corridors are easy to open up but what happens is that later on
3537600	3539100	the corridors get harder to open up.
3539100	3542520	You have to figure out the tricks to open them up and you can either cheat and go to
3542520	3546040	Game Facts or you can look around for those little blue happy face guys, what do they
3546040	3547040	call them?
3547040	3548040	The Lunars?
3548040	3549040	What do they call them?
3549040	3550040	Oh, they're like the Lolo guys.
3550040	3553120	Yeah, they look like Lolo and they give you tips on how to open up the corridors.
3553120	3558160	When you beat the corridors like one through ten, they give you a key like you'll get a
3558160	3562520	little moon key or you'll get a little square key or a diamond key and that will allow you
3562520	3565520	to progress to another section of the Zelda world where there are more corridors waiting
3565520	3566520	for you.
3566520	3567520	Well, that makes way more sense.
3567520	3571080	I thought I was supposed to go to like level moon or level plus sign or something.
3571080	3575800	No, no, you find those moons and plus signs in the corridors when you beat them.
3575800	3577840	Yeah, they're different keys.
3577840	3581440	And then the corridors eleven through twenty just give you weapon upgrades and stuff, right?
3581440	3582440	I think so.
3582440	3583440	Yeah.
3583440	3584440	I don't think you get too much other stuff special.
3584440	3588640	Well, you still have to beat every level to progress through it, but the weapons that
3588640	3592880	you get, the one weapon that's going to be your best friend, especially in the last level,
3592880	3600760	is the multidirectional ball because you can shoot it up, down, left, right, and diagonals
3600760	3604640	and the way you beat the last boss is so freaking easy, but everything else is really hard.
3604640	3605640	Drunami says...
3605640	3606640	This is way better than GameFAQs.
3606640	3607640	Thank you.
3607640	3612560	But TGL mode, you want to try TGL mode at least once.
3612560	3616240	You go into your password and just put in an all caps TGL.
3616240	3617240	Okay.
3617240	3618240	I'll give that a try.
3618240	3620320	It's just all the shooting stages back to back.
3620320	3623520	And it gives you your power-ups, however, there are ways to get around and get earlier
3623520	3629720	power-ups and other things playing in RPG mode, but TGL mode is definitely for the win.
3629720	3630720	Crazy talk.
3630720	3633640	Drunami says they're called Blue Landers just for the record.
3633640	3635320	I like Lolo better.
3635320	3636920	Lolo was pretty awesome.
3636920	3640200	Where it ever happened to Lolo, there was like three of those games on the NES and then
3640200	3641200	Lolo disappeared.
3641200	3643000	He showed up on Virtual Console.
3643000	3644000	Oh, that's right.
3644000	3645000	He came out.
3645000	3650280	You know, Lolo should be in Smash Brothers because didn't HAL make a... and HAL is like
3650280	3651680	a second party, right?
3651680	3653680	They're owned by Nintendo, kind of.
3653680	3656500	They only make games for Nintendo.
3656500	3660220	And they made Lolo and they're the ones that make Smash Brothers, right?
3660220	3661220	They are.
3661220	3662880	So where the hell is Lolo in these games?
3662880	3668280	He probably died because everything kills you in that game.
3668280	3670440	There was a button that killed you in that game.
3670440	3675680	Escapist said Lolo moonlighted in the first Kirby game then disappeared.
3675680	3676680	That's true.
3676680	3681760	He probably hit the select button or whatever the seppuku button was in Lolo.
3681760	3684040	Those were some tough games.
3684040	3685040	That's right.
3685040	3686040	There was Lolo Lolo and La La La.
3686040	3687620	Remember his girlfriend, La La La?
3687620	3690520	She was the girl because she had a bow in her hair and she was pink.
3690520	3691520	The quintessential girl.
3691520	3692520	Well, there's the connection.
3692520	3693520	Kirby had King Dedede.
3693520	3696560	It's like you take a syllable and just repeat it a bunch of times.
3696560	3700420	We need a new... yes, we need a new enemy in this next HAL game.
3700420	3705960	How about King Nanana or King Boo Boo Boo?
3705960	3709600	They let their babies name them, actually, is what they do.
3709600	3712320	Learn your first Japanese character and just write it a bunch of times.
3712320	3713320	That's right.
3713320	3715760	All right, WarriorBob, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
3715760	3719680	No, I've got an NES plugged in now, so what should I play?
3719680	3722000	I've got a legend fund, but I'm looking for more ammo.
3722000	3723200	More NES games to play.
3723200	3727760	Well, I said Cobra Triangle earlier in the show and I still stand by that one.
3727760	3734080	Here's one of my favorite NES games that nobody ever talks about, Snake, Rattle, and Roll.
3734080	3735080	I've got that.
3735080	3736080	I'll put that in.
3736080	3737080	That game is rad.
3737080	3738080	You've got to play that game.
3738080	3739080	DuckTales.
3739080	3742080	Yeah, DuckTales is awesome.
3742080	3744080	Chat rooms can be used to suggest it's true.
3744080	3745080	All right, thank you guys so much.
3745080	3746080	Yeah, no problem.
3746080	3747080	Have a good one.
3747080	3748080	See you next time.
3748080	3749080	See you.
3749080	3750240	I hope WarriorBob comes back to visit sometime.
3750240	3752200	It was fun having him on the show.
3752200	3753760	And lots of folks in the chat room are chiming in.
3753760	3759240	Tech Mobile, Ninja Gaiden, Clu Clu Land, Arkon.
3759240	3760240	That's a good suggestion.
3760240	3761240	Arkon.
3761240	3762240	Clu Clu Land.
3762240	3764720	Oh my God, I played so much of that stupid game.
3764720	3765920	I did an Animal Crossing.
3765920	3766920	We have another call.
3766920	3767920	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3767920	3768920	Who's this?
3768920	3770360	No, this is Mr. DeBucket.
3770360	3771760	Hello, Mr. DeBucket.
3771760	3772760	What's on your mind?
3772760	3775160	He's going to yell at me for kicking him over the Dreamcast.
3775160	3777760	No, I'm not going to yell at you for that.
3777760	3778760	That's understandable.
3778760	3782160	I know how Dreamcast fans are really defensive.
3782160	3783160	This is true.
3783160	3784160	What's on your mind then?
3784160	3786920	Oh, Metal Gear Solid 4, Metal Gear Solid Online.
3786920	3793120	I wanted to know what you guys thought of them making the game separate from the multiplayer.
3793120	3795000	You know, I don't, here's the thing, I have to be honest.
3795000	3800540	I don't follow the Metal Gear series too much, but I'm, I'm kind of welcoming the idea of
3800540	3801600	an online version.
3801600	3803300	I think that might be a lot of fun.
3803300	3809120	Kind of like a, not so much like a first person shooter, but kind of like a different type
3809120	3810600	of direction for that.
3810600	3811600	But I don't know.
3811600	3815240	Like, I'm not so excited about Metal Gear Solid 4 because I didn't play the first three
3815240	3816240	so much.
3816240	3820440	Like, I haven't really played a Metal Gear game since Snake's Revenge on the NES, I have
3820440	3821440	to be honest.
3821440	3822440	You played that?
3822440	3823440	Yeah, I did.
3823440	3824440	I rented it one weekend.
3824440	3825440	I played quite a bit of it.
3825440	3826440	How did you finish it?
3826440	3827440	Huh?
3827440	3828440	How did you finish it?
3828440	3831960	As far as I got was I found like a dude tied up by some, you know, in the middle of the
3831960	3832960	jungle.
3832960	3833960	I untied him.
3833960	3834960	He runs off.
3834960	3837760	I leave and then it's just all darkness and fireworks going off.
3837760	3839600	I seriously don't remember.
3839600	3841680	When I rented it, I was like 11.
3841680	3845560	Yeah, every time we went to a new screen, it was all dark, then fireworks went off and
3845560	3849600	everything was lit up for some reason and helicopters couldn't see you even though you're
3849600	3850720	standing right next to them.
3850720	3853420	Well, how do you feel about it because you must have called this because you had an opinion
3853420	3854420	on it.
3854420	3856160	Oh yeah, I think it's an interesting idea.
3856160	3859540	I mean, if you don't like Metal Gear that much, if you really can't get into the single
3859540	3863520	player, the multiplayer aspect, since it's the second game, I'm pretty sure you will
3863520	3865080	be able to buy it separate.
3865080	3866520	You could like that better.
3866520	3873680	Also, they change the controls to make them more like Western games or things that a lot
3873680	3875640	of online gamers would get into.
3875640	3880760	Now use R1, the shooting stuff, kind of like most games do, using the right trigger, the
3880760	3884320	fire, and use L to aim.
3884320	3889080	The Sons of Patriot system, which is a new thing you can do because no multiplayer game,
3889080	3892720	you can always see your buddies and tell if they died or something like that.
3892720	3896800	You know, say like this person's name got shot, but you can actually see everything
3896800	3897800	that they're doing.
3897800	3903400	Every time you begin a match, you all link up and you can see everybody's stats and
3903400	3908740	what weapon they have and what they're exactly doing so you can go help them out or something.
3908740	3912100	It's a really cool system and it's a completely different game.
3912100	3915800	They're selling it different, but if you do buy Metal Gear Solid 4, you will get like
3915800	3917040	a starter pack or something.
3917040	3918640	Yeah, I heard about that.
3918640	3923760	Yeah, apparently they're going to be making more downloadable content over the next years
3923760	3925200	if people still play it.
3925200	3926200	That's cool.
3926200	3929220	You know, and I think what you said is kind of right where I feel, is that I'm not so
3929220	3932800	excited about Metal Gear Solid 4, but I hear about this online one and I'm like, oh really?
3932800	3934760	That looks like it could be fun.
3934760	3938560	You know, I don't really follow the story, but you know, just throwing me in the arena
3938560	3940560	and shoot them up so it looks like a lot of fun.
3940560	3943200	So I definitely will check it out if nothing else.
3943200	3945280	I may not get so into it, but we'll see.
3945280	3946280	Okay.
3946280	3949000	All right, well anything else you want to share with our listeners today?
3949000	3953840	No, I just think the show was good and I'll keep listening from that one.
3953840	3954840	I appreciate it.
3954840	3955840	Thank you very much.
3955840	3956840	Have a good one, buddy.
3956840	3957840	Bye.
3957840	3958840	Bye-bye.
3958840	3961200	Even if he did, even if he was hating on the Dreamcast, what do you say about the Dreamcast
3961200	3963080	that got him kicked?
3963080	3968080	Just it was in this pickup line thing saying the Dreamcast sucks dick or something.
3968080	3975040	Okay, Rob, do you remember, in fact, I think that we should play this though in the Afterbirth.
3975040	3976040	What's that?
3976040	3977040	I'll try.
3977040	3978040	I'll try.
3978040	3979040	I'll try.
3979040	3980040	I'll try.
3980040	3981040	I'll try.
3981040	3982040	I'll try.
3982040	3983040	I'll try.
3983040	3984040	I'll find it.
3984040	3985040	All right.
3985040	3986040	I picked up a call.
3986040	3987040	Let's go to the phones.
3987040	3988040	Hi, you're on Orange County.
3988040	3989040	I'll show you.
3989040	3990040	Who's this?
3990040	3991040	Legend of Zaku.
3991040	3992040	Hello, Legend of Zaku.
3992040	3993040	What's on your mind?
3993040	3997440	Nah, just chilling, just getting ready for digital life, which is at the end of the week.
3997440	3998440	I'm sorry.
3998440	3999440	I'm not coming.
3999440	4000440	I was looking forward to it.
4000440	4001440	Something else came up.
4001440	4002440	I've been knowing that.
4002440	4003440	It's all right though.
4003440	4013680	Just the general stuff within the community, stuff like Middle Gear Solid 4.
4013680	4014680	What the hell are you typing?
4014680	4016880	Hey, are you typing to somebody else?
4016880	4017880	It's our turn.
4017880	4018880	You talk to us.
4018880	4023920	No, I mean Final Fantasy, all the Halo stuff, all the reviews.
4023920	4030840	Most of them are actually all the Halo 3 reviews coming back almost at 100 or something.
4030840	4037640	The general internet says stuff like OMG, they probably got paid off by Microsoft, but
4037640	4039320	yeah, that sort of thing.
4039320	4042840	I'm not really buying into that much hype.
4042840	4048200	Okay, Zaku, what are you most looking forward to about digital life?
4048200	4050400	Just the DDR tournament.
4050400	4052040	I'm competing in freestyle on Saturday.
4052040	4055440	Are you getting hints about your routine?
4055440	4057440	Not yet.
4057440	4067480	When you see it up on YouTube, hopefully at that night after the tournament, then you'll
4067480	4068480	see something.
4068480	4071240	But yeah, I'm trying to keep it under wraps.
4071240	4076640	I will be looking for you on the YouTubage.
4076640	4079560	Why else do people do DDR freestyle anymore?
4079560	4084520	It's all about being on YouTube and everybody being able to watch your routine.
4084520	4089840	It's kind of like a dying art right now because most tournaments don't even have that except
4089840	4091340	for a few exceptions.
4091340	4095240	If they have that whole SingStar thing on the PlayStation 3 where you're going to be
4095240	4098640	able to upload your videos like a karaoke thing, why don't they do that with DDR?
4098640	4099640	That's what I don't get.
4099640	4104120	Microsoft doesn't care or Konami doesn't care.
4104120	4106320	Most DDR makes us have some sort of camera support.
4106320	4108480	I know the PS2 ones have iToy.
4108480	4109480	Exactly.
4109480	4110480	I don't know about 360.
4110480	4112840	So how about just a website you can upload all that to?
4112840	4113840	Come on.
4113840	4114840	It's free.
4114840	4115960	So Konami, I'm giving you free hints here.
4115960	4119960	I don't think Konami is ready to drop that much bandwidth on that.
4119960	4125160	I mean, they're taking DDR that far, but that's about it.
4125160	4127840	What else is on your mind tonight, buddy?
4127840	4131320	Just really go over the whole rumble.
4131320	4137480	Sony actually getting it supposedly taking their quote unquote last gen feature and just
4137480	4141700	polishing it as if it were new.
4141700	4143480	Basically polishing a turd.
4143480	4144480	We all know better.
4144480	4145480	All right.
4145480	4148440	Well, Zach, I got to let you go to get more calls, but have a good one.
4148440	4151840	Have fun in digital life and tell everybody we said hi.
4151840	4154280	Tell Don I said hi and I'm sorry I didn't make it.
4154280	4155840	Yeah, I will.
4155840	4156840	All right.
4156840	4157840	All right.
4157840	4158840	Later, buddy.
4158840	4161520	See, I'm having people relay my personal messages now.
4161520	4162520	All right.
4162520	4163520	Rob.
4163520	4164520	What?
4164520	4165520	I sent you that thing.
4165520	4166520	Yes.
4166520	4167520	Well, do you want me to play it now or do you want me to play it in the athlete?
4167520	4168520	Right before.
4168520	4169520	Right before.
4169520	4170520	Right now?
4170520	4171520	No, not now.
4171520	4172520	Oh, right before the very end.
4172520	4173520	You got it.
4173520	4176360	A little treat for our live listeners.
4176360	4177360	Are we going to get any more calls?
4177360	4178360	I don't know.
4178360	4179360	How about some more last minute stories?
4179360	4180360	We'll wait for more calls.
4180360	4182800	1-877-GAME-OLR or username orangeonsradio on Skype.
4182800	4183800	Okay.
4183800	4184800	Anything else?
4184800	4189320	If you like Owen Dunn or Elite Beat Agents, you'll be happy to know that OSU, the sim
4189320	4192560	for those games has been released onto the PC.
4192560	4197480	It is available to download and is actually pretty interesting.
4197480	4204460	You can find it at osu.ppy.sh and it's in one of their forum posts there.
4204460	4207600	It's just like playing Owen Dunn but just with your mouse.
4207600	4209080	Which must be insanely difficult.
4209080	4210080	Hold on.
4210080	4211080	We'll talk about that in a minute.
4211080	4212080	We got another call.
4212080	4213080	Hi.
4213080	4214080	You're on orangeonsradio.
4214080	4215080	Who's this?
4215080	4216080	This is Misty.
4216080	4217080	Hi, Misty.
4217080	4218080	Misty.
4218080	4219080	How are you, Misty?
4219080	4220080	Up for once.
4220080	4221080	Wow.
4221080	4222080	I know.
4222080	4224080	We never hear from you live on the show, but I'm so happy you were able to call in.
4224080	4227080	OMG, a girl, everybody.
4227080	4233800	Well, yeah, but you're always here.
4233800	4236800	DarkSakura is looking at her boobs to make sure they're still there.
4236800	4237800	What was that?
4237800	4238800	OMG, a girl.
4238800	4241040	I'm like, yeah, what am I?
4241040	4244400	I wish you would let us put you on OP11 for the funny stuff like that sometimes.
4244400	4245400	No.
4245400	4246400	Alright.
4246400	4247400	Well, Misty, what's on your mind tonight?
4247400	4250120	You just wanted to say hi or what kind of games you've been playing lately?
4250120	4252720	Well, actually, I went to the mall.
4252720	4255760	I caved and got the Crimson Black Deus White Combo.
4255760	4259480	I've been playing a little bit of Brain Age, got Cooking Mama.
4259480	4260480	Awesome.
4260480	4264480	What do you think of Cooking Mama?
4264480	4265480	It is addictive.
4265480	4266880	This is very addictive.
4266880	4269560	What kind of foods have you been preparing in Cooking Mama lately?
4269560	4275240	Pretty much so far the stuff that has retained its Japanese names.
4275240	4276240	Okay.
4276240	4277240	Very cool.
4277240	4278240	Very cool.
4278240	4283000	Is there anything coming out soon on the DS that you're looking forward to?
4283000	4288440	Not really because I've only been half paying attention, but considering my birthday is
4288440	4292040	coming up, I'm going to start paying more attention at Target.
4292040	4293040	Okay.
4293040	4294040	Let's see what else is coming out.
4294040	4295040	I don't know.
4295040	4298400	Actually, I don't know if there's a whole lot on DS coming out soon to get excited about
4298400	4299400	this year.
4299400	4300400	Zelda Phantom Hourglass.
4300400	4301400	Ah, thank you.
4301400	4302400	I knew I was forgetting something.
4302400	4303400	It's the week after next.
4303400	4304400	There you go.
4304400	4305400	Zelda Phantom Hourglass.
4305400	4308960	Most of their big stuff for the holidays have already come out like Brain Age 2 and all
4308960	4310320	that, right?
4310320	4312160	There's Final Fantasy Tactics on the DS.
4312160	4313160	Final Fantasy IV.
4313160	4314160	Oh, Final Fantasy IV.
4314160	4315160	A front mission.
4315160	4316160	Revenant Wings.
4316160	4317160	All right.
4317160	4318160	All right.
4318160	4319160	So shoot me for not following the DS so much.
4319160	4320160	My bad.
4320160	4322440	Well, I don't think it's coming out this year, but...
4322440	4326000	Now as folks in the chat room are giving you some advice on DS games to pick up, the Rob
4326000	4328400	D says you need to get Clubhouse games.
4328400	4330140	Son of Dad says Planet Puzzle League.
4330140	4331140	That's a good game.
4331140	4337160	Yeah, those two look like ones that I've been considering.
4337160	4343160	And for Clubhouse, I have considered it last night, but I came and got Cookie Mommy because
4343160	4348800	I saw that it was only $20, and I was trying to watch my money a little bit, because when
4348800	4349800	I...
4349800	4350800	The DS was...
4350800	4353040	That game stuff was only my first step in the mall.
4353040	4355720	I still had a good portion of the mall to go.
4355720	4356720	Right.
4356720	4359240	So I see the good deals always went out when they're cheaper.
4359240	4360240	Always went out.
4360240	4362760	Well, Misty, anything else you want to share with our listeners today?
4362760	4367000	Not really that I can think of.
4367000	4368000	All right.
4368000	4369920	Well, Misty, thanks so much for calling in, and I'm glad to hear you got through.
4369920	4373440	I know you've been listening to our show forever, and it's always good to listen to you live,
4373440	4374440	all right?
4374440	4375440	All righty.
4375440	4377440	All right, have a good one.
4377440	4378440	You too.
4378440	4379440	Bye-bye.
4379440	4380960	Misty is all kinds of rad.
4380960	4384920	Misty makes OLR jewelry, which I think is the cutest thing ever.
4384920	4385920	It's so cute.
4385920	4389520	If you want to get in on that, go to the forums at our orangelawntrader.com.
4389520	4390520	Click on forums.
4390520	4391520	We're getting more calls.
4391520	4392520	More.
4392520	4394160	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
4394160	4395160	Who's this?
4395160	4399000	Hey, no more less day.
4399000	4400000	Is this Extover?
4400000	4401000	This is.
4401000	4403760	How's it going?
4403760	4406680	You're actually listening to the show tonight, Extover?
4406680	4408640	I went into the chat room.
4408640	4418560	I was playing my puzzle quest, and I went onto the website, and so I decided to call
4418560	4419560	in.
4419560	4420560	Well, there you have it.
4420560	4421560	I thought you guys were taking calls.
4421560	4425440	Do you miss living where the show is recorded?
4425440	4426440	Because now you have to call in.
4426440	4428760	Yeah, I don't miss you, but I miss the show.
4428760	4431200	I miss everything about the show.
4431200	4433120	You miss Jamie and Matt, but.
4433120	4434120	Yeah.
4434120	4435120	Yeah, I'm all right.
4435120	4437400	I miss Jamie and Matt.
4437400	4438400	Nothing about you, though.
4438400	4439400	Yeah, I know.
4439400	4440400	I'm kind of.
4440400	4441480	I'm really horrible to live with.
4441480	4445120	You need to actually come with us to get Indian food when you can eat.
4445120	4447380	Yeah, I know.
4447380	4455360	Really that place is very friendly to the South Beach diet is what I was reading.
4455360	4457200	It's all whole wheat or unbleached.
4457200	4458200	And it's great for vegetarians.
4458200	4459200	Except for the rice.
4459200	4460600	It's awesome for vegetarians, too.
4460600	4462640	I'm actually thinking about going vegetarian again.
4462640	4464200	I just did three days ago.
4464200	4465200	Did you?
4465200	4466200	Yes.
4466200	4467200	Cool.
4467200	4468200	That's why I'm taking vitamins and stuff.
4468200	4470120	I didn't want to make too big a deal out of it, because last time I went vegetarian, I
4470120	4472120	was not able to do it for more than a week and a half.
4472120	4473120	Well, yeah, but you were.
4473120	4475400	So you're being a vegetarian, Rob?
4475400	4476400	What?
4476400	4477400	You're being a vegetarian?
4477400	4478400	Yeah.
4478400	4480600	I threw out everything I had that had meat in it, and I've replaced everything in my
4480600	4481600	fridge with products.
4481600	4482600	I'll tell you what.
4482600	4483600	I will.
4483600	4484600	Because I do have to have.
4484600	4485600	Oh, my God.
4485600	4486600	You're a loser.
4486600	4487600	I get an email really quickly.
4487600	4488600	Wait.
4488600	4489600	Why'd you call me a loser?
4489600	4490600	I don't know.
4490600	4491600	Just don't like it.
4491600	4492600	Go to hell.
4492600	4493600	I hate you.
4493600	4494600	What?
4494600	4495600	Okay.
4495600	4499160	I will go vegetarian with you, except I will need to eat fish.
4499160	4503160	No, I'm going to eat fish, too, because protein's so hard to get.
4503160	4504160	I get an email.
4504160	4505160	Well, then you're not a true vegetarian.
4505160	4506720	You're right, I'm not.
4506720	4509960	So it would be more appropriate to say I don't eat meat.
4509960	4510960	No red meat.
4510960	4511960	Yeah, you're a fish-itarian.
4511960	4512960	No red meat and no poultry.
4512960	4513960	Yeah, I'm a fish-itarian.
4513960	4514960	I can't give up sushi.
4514960	4515960	I just can't.
4515960	4516960	All right.
4516960	4517960	Well, anyway, enough about that.
4517960	4518960	Yeah.
4518960	4519960	Who the fuck cares about what I eat?
4519960	4520960	In other words, you're a pretty vegetarian.
4520960	4521960	Nobody cares about what I eat.
4521960	4522960	Extra fur.
4522960	4524440	What kind of games have you been playing this week?
4524440	4527320	I don't know if you remember, but we talk about video games on this show once in a while.
4527320	4530680	What kind of video games have you been playing?
4530680	4536920	I've been playing World of Warcraft and Puzzle Quest, big surprise.
4536920	4540720	How's World of Warcraft been treating you?
4540720	4541720	Pretty good.
4541720	4549720	I'm at the end of a grind in the game, and I don't know.
4549720	4555680	It's getting kind of boring, because I've gotten a lot of stuff, and so now I'm wondering
4555680	4558480	what to do half the time when I get on.
4558480	4565480	What are you most looking forward to about Wrath of the Lich King?
4565480	4567120	I haven't decided yet.
4567120	4575320	I think just to look in the new areas and stuff like that, explore in the new areas.
4575320	4579400	When I come back to World of Warcraft, which is probably going to happen, because, oh my
4579400	4582440	gosh, I can't believe we didn't talk about it during the news, but Final Fantasy XI,
4582440	4587780	okay, A, I kind of stopped playing a couple weeks ago, but B, they announced that for
4587780	4592380	the new expansion is coming out, Wings of the Goddess is the new expansion coming out,
4592380	4596840	they have announced one of the new job classes for Wings of the Goddess, Dancer.
4596840	4597840	So you can shake your booty.
4597840	4598840	Yeah, I know.
4598840	4599840	Oh, I'm so excited.
4599840	4603400	By the way, Sauce says it's technically pescetarianism.
4603400	4604400	Is that what it is?
4604400	4605400	Pescetarian?
4605400	4606400	Yes.
4606400	4607840	Well, not eat the flesh of any animal other than types of seafood.
4607840	4612200	Yes, and I don't want to live off seafood, but I just want that to be available, because
4612200	4616800	I'm doing it for health reasons, not, you know, I'm not a member of PETA or anything.
4616800	4617800	This is health reasons.
4617800	4618800	People eating tasty animals.
4618800	4619800	Well, hey.
4619800	4620800	What?
4620800	4626600	If you come back to WoW, then you can't, you're like a, you're a cooker, right, you cook food
4626600	4627600	in WoW, right?
4627600	4628600	Yes, yes.
4628600	4630520	Yeah, so you can't make any meat anymore.
4630520	4631520	But it's, it's a virtual.
4631520	4633960	I'll call you a liar.
4633960	4636440	It's a virtual game, it doesn't matter.
4636440	4637760	And again, I'm not doing.
4637760	4638760	It matters.
4638760	4639760	It matters to me.
4639760	4640760	Okay, if I was.
4640760	4643180	If you give me meat, I'm going to call you a liar.
4643180	4647200	If I was a card-carrying member of PETA, then maybe, but I'm doing it for health reasons,
4647200	4650720	not, because I'll tell you what, making yourself vegetarian really makes you stop and think
4650720	4654080	about everything you're eating, whereas usually, you don't.
4654080	4656240	You don't, like, if you're not on some type of thing, you don't.
4656240	4657640	But I don't want to talk about food anymore.
4657640	4658640	Jesus Christ.
4658640	4659640	All right.
4659640	4660640	Aw, okay.
4660640	4661640	See, now everybody in chat is yelling at me.
4661640	4662640	I should never call myself a vegetarian.
4662640	4664440	I'm just on a lifestyle adjustment.
4664440	4665440	Who cares?
4665440	4666440	All right.
4666440	4667440	Excellent meeting up on you.
4667440	4668440	You're ruining the show.
4668440	4669440	I had a mushroom Swiss burger today.
4669440	4670440	It was so good.
4670440	4671440	You had a what?
4671440	4673400	I had a mushroom Swiss burger today.
4673400	4674400	It was so good.
4674400	4675400	I'm so glad to hear it.
4675400	4677520	Filled with meat and protein and meat.
4677520	4678520	All right.
4678520	4679520	I'm hanging up.
4679520	4680520	Lots of meat.
4680520	4681520	Buy extra frozen.
4681520	4683840	But remember, you can only eat top cuts of meat.
4683840	4689200	It has to all be lean, less than 3%, no, less than 5% fat from meat if you're doing South
4689200	4690200	Beach.
4690200	4691200	That's right, or you'll balloon up.
4691200	4692200	Yeah, I know.
4692200	4695360	You'll balloon up, and you'll look like all those contestants on Biggest Loser.
4695360	4697160	You look like Roseanne.
4697160	4698160	Well, good.
4698160	4701560	Then I can try out for Biggest Loser next year.
4701560	4702560	All right.
4702560	4703560	I'm hanging up on you, Extrofer.
4703560	4704560	Okay.
4704560	4705560	Take care.
4705560	4706560	I love you all.
4706560	4707560	Bye.
4707560	4708560	Bye.
4708560	4712680	I'm surprised Extrofer didn't use the opportunity to tell us he was talking to us on his iPhone.
4712680	4716960	Because usually he'll say, I'm on my iPhone.
4716960	4720520	Actually the funny thing about Extrofer, he has a whole YouTube series now.
4720520	4722760	His live journal posts have all been YouTube clips.
4722760	4727200	Extrofer, if you're still in chat, you can plug your YouTube channel there.
4727200	4730040	You have to spell his name really funny, so I can't even remember how to get there.
4730040	4731480	There you go.
4731480	4735120	And Extrofer will also be coming back to Orange Launch Radio just as soon as we can get coordinated
4735120	4737040	and get our Wednesday show off the ground again.
4737040	4740520	But we're going to do something with video this time, because of Op 11 and all that fun
4740520	4741520	stuff.
4741520	4742520	I'm going to hide.
4742520	4743520	Well, it's the Wednesday show.
4743520	4744520	You're not on it.
4744520	4745920	I should come on the Wednesday show and bring pizza.
4745920	4747200	But then you have to be on cam.
4747200	4748200	No.
4748200	4749200	Fine.
4749200	4750200	Then you have to wear a paper bag over your head the whole time.
4750200	4752520	Like Faust from Guilty Gear.
4752520	4754360	All right.
4754360	4755840	That's it for the Skype line tonight, you guys.
4755840	4758080	Thanks so much for tuning in and participating.
4758080	4759080	Play it.
4759080	4760080	Appreciate it.
4760080	4761080	Play it.
4761080	4762080	Hold on.
4762080	4763080	We're not there yet.
4763080	4764080	I'm not there yet.
4764080	4765080	Any more last minute stories?
4765080	4766080	Yes.
4766080	4767080	Thank you.
4767080	4768080	I've been finding more as we wait.
4768080	4772240	Anyways, some interesting stuff to kind of go back to last week's story, how we talked
4772240	4781080	about Sony releasing 3.71 firmware for the PSP and the PSP Slim to circumvent the independent
4781080	4782080	firmwares.
4782080	4789240	M33 has just released the custom firmware 3.71 to combat that.
4789240	4794360	So now you have all the wonderful features of the most current firmware for the PSP and
4794360	4796520	you can also run homebrew.
4796520	4798600	It will never work, Sony.
4798600	4799600	Try as you may.
4799600	4803400	It will never, ever work.
4803400	4807100	Anyways, some other interesting stuff.
4807100	4814760	There is a Chinese MMO company, Shonda Entertainment, who has a MMO called King of the World.
4814760	4822480	Apparently, they have banned men playing women characters.
4822480	4824000	You know I only play women characters.
4824000	4827400	You will be required to prove your gender via webcam.
4827400	4831040	What if it's a really pretty guy?
4831040	4832040	I know.
4832040	4833040	That won't be hard to fake.
4833040	4834040	What if you're Chris Crocker?
4834040	4836280	Or just put your sister in front of the camera.
4836280	4845600	What if you have a woman who has very masculine features?
4845600	4846600	You mad.
4846600	4851000	What do they do with trannies?
4851000	4853280	No love for the transsexuals.
4853280	4855960	I love trannies, Rob.
4855960	4860840	Pretty soon, actually, their EB is going to be no more.
4860840	4868600	In fact, GameStop is finishing up converting over the remaining EB Games stores to become
4868600	4870600	GameStop.
4870600	4878440	Apparently, the official announcement has to be given, but people are noticing that
4878440	4881920	more and more EB Games are slowly becoming GameStop.
4881920	4884560	I wonder what's going to happen to the two that are in the mall.
4884560	4887080	So it's kind of speculation, isn't it?
4887080	4894640	Well, they said just this week that two stores in Rochester have already become GameStops.
4894640	4897760	They've noticed more and more since then.
4897760	4901520	Samurai Shodown 2 is coming to Xbox Live Arcade and the Wii.
4901520	4903560	That was also the best one in the series.
4903560	4908280	It was shown at Tokyo Game Show, so people will be happy about that.
4908280	4909280	Best one ever.
4909280	4914320	It is coming to the Japanese Xbox Live Arcade, so no word if it's coming to the U.S.
4914320	4917960	It probably will be.
4917960	4928400	Finally, there have been some tools released for modders of the Xbox 360 using a timing
4928400	4933280	attack with a mod chip that's out there right now.
4933280	4940520	You can drop your firmware down to one that can be exploited and it will allow you to
4940520	4946920	install Linux on your Xbox 360 and probably also run Homebrew and, God knows, probably
4946920	4949960	running backups of games.
4949960	4952440	Real quick, this is more for in-studio, unfortunately.
4952440	4957760	Check out this cool add-on for the Arkanoid DS game that's got the little paddle.
4957760	4958760	That's cool.
4958760	4959760	I saw that somewhere.
4959760	4960760	That looks awesome.
4960760	4961760	Yeah, that's pretty awesome.
4961760	4962760	Let's see.
4962760	4966840	I think, yep, that's all the stories I had.
4966840	4967840	Well it's about time.
4967840	4972480	All right, now DarkSakura, set up this YouTubage I'm going to look at here in studio and the
4972480	4975280	folks on the stream and podcast will get the audio.
4975280	4981040	This was back in the day when there was the big debate between the Dreamcast and the PS2.
4981040	4987640	People trying to decide what was better and this is basically a Dreamcast and a VMU talking
4987640	4989480	to a PlayStation 2.
4989480	4991160	Was this an actual commercial on TV or what was it?
4991160	4995000	No, this is just a fan video and it was on some site a long time ago but a bunch of people
4995000	5001720	have re-uploaded it but the PS2 was the one with the really snooty voice and the Dreamcast
5001720	5007040	is like the regular, you know, talking guy and the VMU is the one that goes, what a disappointment.
5007040	5010720	I'm hoping this isn't going to buffer like crazy because our net's running kind of slow.
5010720	5011720	I don't think it will.
5011720	5012720	We'll see.
5012720	5013720	We'll see what happens.
5013720	5014720	Hey, PS2.
5014720	5015720	Yes?
5015720	5018200	Me and the VMU were watching you play Ridge Racer 5.
5018200	5019200	Oh, really?
5019200	5021400	Yeah, and we thought it looked really good.
5021400	5022960	Ah, thank you.
5022960	5024960	Yeah, it looks good.
5024960	5026960	For us to poop on.
5026960	5034600	Look me if you must but keep in mind that I am powered by the 128-bit emotion engine.
5034600	5037960	Yeah, the only emotion you're giving developers is frustration.
5037960	5041680	They'd rather be programming on a Saturn.
5041680	5042680	What a disappointment.
5042680	5047880	Only top notch Japanese development studios can obtain optimum results from my hardware.
5047880	5051720	Yeah, then how come Dead or Alive 2 looks better running on me than on you?
5051720	5052720	What a disappointment.
5052720	5057120	Oh, but surely you've witnessed the raw beauty that has Tekken tagged tournament.
5057120	5060800	Yeah, a game that looks like Tekken 3 running in enhanced mode.
5060800	5061800	What a disappointment.
5061800	5062800	Oh, I say.
5062800	5067040	Do you actually believe your crappy lineup can compete with Jet Set Radio, Grandia 2,
5067040	5071920	Echo the Dolphin, Metropolis Street Racer, Furballs, NFL 2001, Eternal Arcadia, somebody
5071920	5073600	amigo on Sonic Adventure 2?
