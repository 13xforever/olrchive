00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:01,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:15,436 --> 00:00:19,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:45,592 --> 00:00:49,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Rain's nice, but you know... I opened all the windows in the house while I was home.

4
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:52,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I don't necessarily want to go out and play in it, but I have the view.

5
00:00:52,614 --> 00:00:54,775
[SPEAKER_10]: I can look in the backyard and watch the rain fall.

6
00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:55,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Rain is great.

7
00:00:56,316 --> 00:00:56,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Rain's okay.

8
00:00:57,836 --> 00:00:58,996
[SPEAKER_10]: It's overrated sometimes.

9
00:00:59,056 --> 00:01:01,477
[SPEAKER_10]: If I wanted to see rain all the time, I'd live in Seattle or something.

10
00:01:01,897 --> 00:01:03,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Live in Alabama for a while.

11
00:01:03,498 --> 00:01:04,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Do they get a lot of rain there too?

12
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:05,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hell yeah.

13
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:08,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Second highest precipitation in the country.

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,640
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a subtropical climate.

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Less weather, more games.

16
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:12,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

17
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:25,028
[SPEAKER_09]: One interesting thing to happen this week is that Intel has actually bought the physics engine Havoc and is now going to be incorporating it into their product.

18
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:35,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting enough, Havoc Engine's been in quite a few games, including Bioshock, Stranglehold, Halo 2, Half-Life 2, Oblivion, and Crackdown.

19
00:01:35,565 --> 00:01:38,506
[SPEAKER_09]: And they've bought the company for $21 million.

20
00:01:38,526 --> 00:01:42,327
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it's pretty cool.

21
00:01:42,408 --> 00:01:44,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I could sell them my cat for $21 million.

22
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:51,791
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe we'll see some more Havoc stuff built into the new Intel chips, which would be good, because, you know, physics are awesome.

23
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,012
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the new wave now.

24
00:01:54,437 --> 00:01:56,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Take it from Loki, physics are awesome.

25
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:57,841
[SPEAKER_09]: In games.

26
00:01:57,861 --> 00:01:58,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't it be physics is?

27
00:01:59,163 --> 00:02:00,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Real physics suck.

28
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:03,208
[SPEAKER_10]: Intelligence are awesome.

29
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:06,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Intelligence are awesome.

30
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:28,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently it had 4 out of 5 pieces of a tier 6 armor set.

31
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:30,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously the damn thing was level 7.

32
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:35,824
[SPEAKER_10]: It had legendary swords that were dropped by Illidan Stormrage.

33
00:02:36,184 --> 00:02:38,728
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically it was about as high of a character as you can get.

34
00:02:39,608 --> 00:02:40,469
[SPEAKER_10]: And there you have it.

35
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:41,189
[SPEAKER_10]: This character sold for $10,000.

36
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Granted, I don't know where this sold, but I'm assuming it was on eBay or something.

37
00:02:47,913 --> 00:02:49,654
[SPEAKER_06]: The price was in euros, so it had to be in Europe.

38
00:02:49,915 --> 00:02:51,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, but was it like eBay Europe or what?

39
00:02:51,956 --> 00:02:52,376
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure.

40
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:55,118
[SPEAKER_09]: If I were rich, I would buy him and delete him.

41
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was funny they were mentioning in there that the person that bought it, his regular account was banned.

42
00:03:04,244 --> 00:03:05,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, so that's why they bought it.

43
00:03:05,504 --> 00:03:06,145
[SPEAKER_10]: That makes sense.

44
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:11,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that totally makes sense to spend $10,000 on a character.

45
00:03:11,647 --> 00:03:12,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Never mind.

46
00:03:12,107 --> 00:03:12,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, okay.

47
00:03:12,887 --> 00:03:15,988
[SPEAKER_10]: In somebody's mind, though, dude, what if they had a lot of friends on there or something?

48
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:20,309
[SPEAKER_06]: If I had that much money, well, you know, I would do actually constructive things with it.

49
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:24,131
[SPEAKER_09]: It's probably someone like Ashley Simpson or something like, I'm totally hardcore, yo!

50
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:26,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at all the stuff I earned!

51
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:27,772
[SPEAKER_09]: All the stuff.

52
00:03:28,112 --> 00:03:29,092
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm super awesome.

53
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:35,154
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, the chat, our chat room, chat.orangemonstrator.com is asking about Force Strength, Force Dam, Leather Belts.

54
00:03:35,294 --> 00:03:35,754
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

55
00:03:36,394 --> 00:03:36,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

56
00:03:38,507 --> 00:03:39,748
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm only going to tell you this once, chat.

57
00:03:39,808 --> 00:03:40,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

58
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:41,949
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an inside joke.

59
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:42,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Forget it.

60
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:47,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but World of Warcraft doesn't have a goat helmet like Ragnarok does.

61
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:51,433
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what else World of Warcraft doesn't have that Ragnarok does have that's pretty awesome?

62
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,213
[SPEAKER_10]: The bow that you can wear in your hair.

63
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the bow is great.

64
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:56,135
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get a giant bow, Rob.

65
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:57,695
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to have a SARS mask and a bow.

66
00:03:57,936 --> 00:03:58,476
[SPEAKER_10]: It was awesome.

67
00:03:58,556 --> 00:03:59,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave you your bow.

68
00:03:59,936 --> 00:04:00,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

69
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:02,798
[SPEAKER_06]: It used to be my cell phone.

70
00:04:03,538 --> 00:04:07,680
[SPEAKER_10]: I will think about playing Ragnarok on your server, but after I beat Eternal Sonata...

71
00:04:10,253 --> 00:04:11,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Please don't ever tell me that again.

72
00:04:12,914 --> 00:04:17,454
[SPEAKER_06]: No, in one of the dungeons it's like, because the drop rate is so high, you leave with like 500 pairs of panties.

73
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:22,476
[SPEAKER_10]: Only on this program.

74
00:04:23,956 --> 00:04:24,376
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Ragnarok.

75
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:25,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Women throwing their panties at me.

76
00:04:27,777 --> 00:04:30,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, next story please, panty lover.

77
00:04:31,257 --> 00:04:32,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't wanna, I quit.

78
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:33,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not want!

79
00:04:34,318 --> 00:04:34,518
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

80
00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:42,451
[SPEAKER_06]: New downloadable content for Guitar Hero 2 will have some pretty, pretty cool stuff.

81
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:49,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Trivium's Detonation, Atreyu Right Side of the Bed, and Protest the Heroes Bury the Hatchet.

82
00:04:50,296 --> 00:04:52,377
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think it's rad there's a band called Atreyu.

83
00:04:53,898 --> 00:04:54,338
[SPEAKER_06]: We did.

84
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:55,959
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the dude in NeverEnding Story.

85
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:56,339
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

86
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Their cover of You Give Love a Bad Name.

87
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:05,222
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the verse parts are awful because he's also just doing nothing but screaming.

88
00:05:05,842 --> 00:05:07,123
[SPEAKER_06]: But like the chorus parts are great.

89
00:05:07,763 --> 00:05:10,963
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's like the worst and best cover ever.

90
00:05:11,323 --> 00:05:14,344
[SPEAKER_10]: The cover does in fact give love a bad name, actually.

91
00:05:14,604 --> 00:05:15,765
[SPEAKER_06]: It gives everything a bad name.

92
00:05:15,785 --> 00:05:18,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Phil Do in our chatroom says Atreyu sucks.

93
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:20,706
[SPEAKER_10]: They suck.

94
00:05:21,786 --> 00:05:22,806
[SPEAKER_10]: But they have a rad name.

95
00:05:22,946 --> 00:05:25,687
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they might totally suck, but they have a rad name.

96
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:26,527
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't deny that.

97
00:05:27,435 --> 00:05:31,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's even worse, though, if you have a crappy band with a cool name.

98
00:05:31,316 --> 00:05:33,617
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, why didn't you pick a crappy name?

99
00:05:34,297 --> 00:05:36,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn it, now, like, a cool band can't have your name.

100
00:05:37,258 --> 00:05:37,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Loser.

101
00:05:37,858 --> 00:05:40,939
[SPEAKER_10]: What was that quote in Wayne's World, one of my favorite movies of all time?

102
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:43,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Who else is playing tonight?

103
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:44,660
[SPEAKER_10]: The Shitty Beatles.

104
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,740
[SPEAKER_10]: The Shitty Beatles?

105
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they suck.

106
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's not just a clever name.

107
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:49,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was great.

108
00:05:51,942 --> 00:05:54,742
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure I butchered that quote, but I could almost quote that entire movie.

109
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,223
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how much I love Wayne's World.

110
00:05:56,483 --> 00:05:56,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

111
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Back to games, please help save the show.

112
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:02,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways.

113
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:20,287
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, if you're not into downloading songs off of Xbox Live, well, maybe you just want to buy the soundtrack to Guitar Hero 3 and put that in your system and unlock some more songs that way.

114
00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:26,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, actually, there will be a code to download some songs off of Xbox Live and

115
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:29,254
[SPEAKER_09]: to be added into Guitar Hero 3.

116
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:49,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Three tracks that you unlock include, let's see here, a track by AFI, Carcigen Crush, looks like Tina by Flyleaf, and a remix of Marilyn Manson's Putting Holes in Happiness by Nick Zinner of the Yayayas.

117
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:55,548
[SPEAKER_09]: So how much you want to bet?

118
00:06:57,653 --> 00:07:03,560
[SPEAKER_09]: How much do you want to bet that these songs are already in the game and you're just having to buy the soundtrack?

119
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,223
[SPEAKER_10]: You're just locking them on the disc already.

120
00:07:07,124 --> 00:07:08,125
[SPEAKER_10]: And that pisses people off.

121
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,909
[SPEAKER_10]: I notice that pisses a lot of Xbox people off.

122
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:15,257
[SPEAKER_10]: When they download these things and they find that they're just keys to unlock shit that was already on the disc.

123
00:07:15,357 --> 00:07:16,478
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the thing, though, about this.

124
00:07:16,898 --> 00:07:21,181
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't really clear to me whether this is just for the 360 or what.

125
00:07:21,661 --> 00:07:23,343
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, this is coming from Billboard.

126
00:07:23,363 --> 00:07:25,644
[SPEAKER_09]: They were saying that this is going to be a code or whatever.

127
00:07:25,864 --> 00:07:31,068
[SPEAKER_09]: But they may misinterpret it to actually being a physical code that you punch into the game.

128
00:07:31,508 --> 00:07:34,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Because obviously this game is coming out on almost all the platforms.

129
00:07:34,531 --> 00:07:39,214
[SPEAKER_09]: So it wouldn't be surprising if it's just a little key code that you put in.

130
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:42,967
[SPEAKER_09]: I like all that exclusive GameStop content you get.

131
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:47,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a code that ends up leaking out in the internet later on anyways.

132
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:51,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this kind of news makes me angsty, but it's not time for that segment yet.

133
00:07:52,261 --> 00:07:55,366
[SPEAKER_10]: So instead I have to do some news that makes me happy.

134
00:07:56,462 --> 00:07:58,503
[SPEAKER_10]: GameTap, GameTap, GameTap, GameTap, GameTap, GameTap, GameTap, GameTap,

135
00:08:26,596 --> 00:08:27,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, it's so much fun.

136
00:08:27,337 --> 00:08:34,448
[SPEAKER_06]: When I used to hang out with Iguana Girl, we used to just go over and do nothing but play.

137
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:37,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Typing of the Dead for like hours.

138
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,431
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not even joking.

139
00:08:38,771 --> 00:08:40,873
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the version of it they had at Arcade Infinity for a while?

140
00:08:40,893 --> 00:08:41,653
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the Japanese one.

141
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:46,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the Japanese one, but like you couldn't beat one of the bosses because it asks you trivia questions and you can't beat it.

142
00:08:46,757 --> 00:08:48,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's in Japanese.

143
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:49,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, unless you can speak it.

144
00:08:49,619 --> 00:08:52,781
[SPEAKER_10]: But man, playing the Japanese one was hard because you wouldn't know the words.

145
00:08:54,222 --> 00:09:04,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think that it had like an all like an English typing mode and then it had the Kana mode and I used to actually have

146
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:05,806
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

147
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:30,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we read them here live on air.

148
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:35,903
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark Sakura will answer your questions or she'll taunt you and make fun of your grammar and punctuation.

149
00:09:36,664 --> 00:09:38,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to do it.

150
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:41,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark Sakura, open up the mailbag, dive on in.

151
00:09:41,588 --> 00:09:42,108
[SPEAKER_10]: What do we got?

152
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:45,191
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one comes from Spamoflage.

153
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:46,612
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great name.

154
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:50,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Guys, you make my Monday morning at work fun.

155
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the podcast.

156
00:09:51,451 --> 00:10:02,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is Uncharted referred to as Tomb Raider with a guy and unoriginal, whereas every single World War II slash army type slash alien space type first person shooter isn't criticized for lack of originality?

157
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:04,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly, I've noticed a trend on your show.

158
00:10:05,144 --> 00:10:09,368
[SPEAKER_06]: One, Loki makes an Xbox 360 announcement and follows it with a neutral or positive comment.

159
00:10:09,748 --> 00:10:13,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Two, Loki makes a PS3 announcement followed by a sarcastic or negative comment.

160
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:14,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't believe me?

161
00:10:14,141 --> 00:10:14,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Try this.

162
00:10:14,621 --> 00:10:21,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, ask the ever so lovely DarkSakura to ring a bell every time you say something negative about the PS3 and see how many times you catch yourself.

163
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:22,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Enough.

164
00:10:22,364 --> 00:10:22,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Why the hate?

165
00:10:22,804 --> 00:10:23,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

166
00:10:23,224 --> 00:10:24,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

167
00:10:24,545 --> 00:10:24,885
[SPEAKER_06]: P.S.

168
00:10:25,185 --> 00:10:27,106
[SPEAKER_06]: No idea how to spell Loki, so make fun of me.

169
00:10:27,146 --> 00:10:27,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I deserve it.

170
00:10:28,686 --> 00:10:30,547
[SPEAKER_06]: It's L-O-K-I, not with two E's.

171
00:10:31,287 --> 00:10:32,187
[SPEAKER_06]: That looks very girly.

172
00:10:33,348 --> 00:10:33,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki!

173
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:35,748
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like a MySpace name.

174
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:37,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

175
00:10:39,368 --> 00:10:41,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Put a T in there, you have loquette.

176
00:10:42,111 --> 00:10:43,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Should we do that next week?

177
00:10:43,112 --> 00:10:43,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Get a bell?

178
00:10:44,012 --> 00:10:44,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do it.

179
00:10:45,273 --> 00:10:47,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's keep a little tally thing.

180
00:10:47,495 --> 00:10:48,036
[SPEAKER_10]: A little tally?

181
00:10:48,076 --> 00:10:48,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

182
00:10:48,676 --> 00:10:54,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Next week, we'll get DarkSakura a bell, and every time Loki makes a negative comment about the PlayStation 3, we'll ring it.

183
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:56,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, maybe they should stop making it so damn easy.

184
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:57,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

185
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,045
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, come on.

186
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:01,006
[SPEAKER_09]: I own both systems, okay?

187
00:11:01,147 --> 00:11:01,367
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

188
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:05,110
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't help it if they keep disappointing me.

189
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, well, the emailer raises a valid point.

190
00:11:09,312 --> 00:11:16,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Why does this Uncharted get passed off as Tomb Raider with a guy, whereas lots of other games are copies of each other?

191
00:11:17,356 --> 00:11:20,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm not saying that all the games that come out are original anyways.

192
00:11:20,397 --> 00:11:24,259
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, shit, there's how many World War II first-person shooter games out there?

193
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:25,760
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously.

194
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,042
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I were to compare Halo 3 to Resistance, I mean, it looks...

195
00:11:30,913 --> 00:11:32,613
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

196
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,242
[SPEAKER_09]: and they're expecting this to be this big holiday seller.

197
00:12:04,243 --> 00:12:05,384
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's going to happen.

198
00:12:05,404 --> 00:12:11,469
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, maybe Unreal Tournament 3, but then again, no, that's another first-person shooter game.

199
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:14,872
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, nothing's original nowadays.

200
00:12:14,952 --> 00:12:16,874
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very hard to make an original game.

201
00:12:16,914 --> 00:12:20,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we'll withhold that final judgment until the game is actually released and you get a chance to play it.

202
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:21,437
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine.

203
00:12:21,538 --> 00:12:23,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to buy it, but you know what?

204
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:28,618
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to buy it, and if you like those kind of action-adventure games, then maybe that's something for you.

205
00:12:28,678 --> 00:12:32,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe that's the game that you've been looking for for the PlayStation 3.

206
00:12:32,782 --> 00:12:45,636
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're waiting, though, for some of these other games that they keep promising us, but, you know, I'm very disappointed that we don't have Final Fantasy XIII yet, or even a demo of it, as they promised us before, but all this stuff keeps getting pushed back.

207
00:12:46,753 --> 00:12:47,853
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the bell idea, though.

208
00:12:47,873 --> 00:12:48,974
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because Sony and they can.

209
00:12:49,794 --> 00:12:52,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Comments from chat, chat.orange.com.

210
00:12:52,235 --> 00:12:53,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob D would like to say, no, it's not.

211
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:56,577
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very hard to get funding for an innovative game because it's a risk.

212
00:12:56,637 --> 00:12:57,237
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a difference.

213
00:12:59,638 --> 00:13:00,478
[SPEAKER_06]: So, next email?

214
00:13:00,538 --> 00:13:01,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, please.

215
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:02,119
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the bell idea.

216
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:02,619
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll do that.

217
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:03,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Next email.

218
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,280
[SPEAKER_06]: This comes from Osfer.

219
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:10,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear Rob, yeah, I said Rob, but everyone else can chime in with their opinion if they wish to do so.

220
00:13:10,863 --> 00:13:13,844
[SPEAKER_06]: You always talk about Final Fantasy XII as such a great game.

221
00:13:13,864 --> 00:13:14,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

222
00:13:14,284 --> 00:13:14,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

223
00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:17,570
[SPEAKER_06]: What's so great about a game that has a boring political storyline?

224
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:23,592
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, a great compelling story like Final Fantasy VII and X are what make the games great.

225
00:13:24,032 --> 00:13:25,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I don't like the battle system.

226
00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:26,833
[SPEAKER_06]: It's way too much like World of Warcraft.

227
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:29,154
[SPEAKER_06]: I prefer the strategic system like in Final Fantasy X.

228
00:13:30,231 --> 00:13:33,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of which, Final Fantasy X needs more praise.

229
00:13:33,394 --> 00:13:38,398
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, it's the best game in the series and one of the few games I have ever pulled an all-nighter on.

230
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:38,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

231
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:40,180
[SPEAKER_06]: The story is freaking epic.

232
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:42,362
[SPEAKER_06]: It's compelled me to keep playing.

233
00:13:42,762 --> 00:13:45,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I also love the battle system and don't really mind the random battles.

234
00:13:45,765 --> 00:13:47,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy X too wasn't that bad either.

235
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:52,031
[SPEAKER_06]: People just need to quit complaining about Yuna singing, which I think is really good.

236
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:54,613
[SPEAKER_06]: A Thousand Words is an amazing song.

237
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:59,887
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing that made me sad is that Final Fantasy X-2 lacks summons, but oh well.

238
00:14:00,108 --> 00:14:01,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for reading, Osfer.

239
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I agree.

240
00:14:03,893 --> 00:14:06,597
[SPEAKER_09]: XII actually is one of the Final Fantasy games I have not played.

241
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:10,964
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have no... It doesn't...

242
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,090
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

243
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,130
[SPEAKER_09]: It just doesn't do it.

244
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:46,085
[SPEAKER_06]: What I've gone through with the stories so far, I actually like political stories.

245
00:14:46,205 --> 00:14:47,467
[SPEAKER_06]: I love things that make you think.

246
00:14:48,729 --> 00:14:54,058
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and maybe, I don't know if that, I'm not trying to be rude or anything, but sometimes people don't like...

247
00:14:54,724 --> 00:14:55,384
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

248
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:25,323
[SPEAKER_10]: But my problem with Final Fantasy VIII is that the battles and the whole like junctioning magic and all that shit ruined the game for me.

249
00:15:25,403 --> 00:15:26,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Single-handedly ruined the game.

250
00:15:26,364 --> 00:15:27,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Could not stand the battle system in VIII.

251
00:15:27,745 --> 00:15:28,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Couldn't stand it.

252
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,067
[SPEAKER_10]: So I didn't want to play through it.

253
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,111
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of liked the junctioning.

254
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:38,794
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I really, really liked having to draw your spells.

255
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:39,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, drawing magic.

256
00:15:39,874 --> 00:15:40,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it hits a nerve.

257
00:15:40,855 --> 00:15:41,415
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked it.

258
00:15:41,455 --> 00:15:42,136
[SPEAKER_10]: I couldn't stand it.

259
00:15:42,536 --> 00:15:43,497
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked that part of it.

260
00:15:44,017 --> 00:15:49,340
[SPEAKER_06]: But by the time I got to the third disc and was trying to put together my weapons and shit, I was like, bored now!

261
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:51,722
[SPEAKER_06]: So I watched someone else beat it and didn't have to.

262
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:54,944
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd already gotten all the other cool cutscenes anyway.

263
00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:56,865
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I said before I got to the end of the first disc.

264
00:15:56,905 --> 00:15:57,205
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, ugh.

265
00:15:58,326 --> 00:15:59,787
[SPEAKER_06]: The second just had some cool crap in it.

266
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:02,028
[SPEAKER_06]: It had the Ultimecia battles and all that.

267
00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:05,708
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really like when the monsters level with you either.

268
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:06,749
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

269
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:08,050
[SPEAKER_10]: That kind of thing bugs me.

270
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:08,510
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why.

271
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:13,053
[SPEAKER_06]: I like being able to go to so and such area and knowing what to expect.

272
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:14,614
[SPEAKER_06]: You know.

273
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:16,075
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again.

274
00:16:17,296 --> 00:16:19,797
[SPEAKER_06]: This next email, if we are ready.

275
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:22,319
[SPEAKER_06]: It's from Rob with two B's.

276
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:24,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I haven't heard from him in a while.

277
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Hooray for Rob with two B's.

278
00:16:26,021 --> 00:16:31,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, he sends us a few stories, but... And sometimes we try to work them into the show role, but, you know.

279
00:16:32,005 --> 00:16:32,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, here we go.

280
00:16:33,206 --> 00:16:34,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was the name.

281
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:58,545
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I kind of agree.

282
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:02,687
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, let's just say I did not jump up and want to spend $10 on this game.

283
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,208
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I just, I don't know.

284
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:05,229
[SPEAKER_10]: You're right.

285
00:17:06,149 --> 00:17:10,992
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like all the parts are there, but the whole they'd add up to, it's just eh.

286
00:17:11,432 --> 00:17:19,677
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like when you look at $10, you know, spending on that game and you're saying, hmm, look, Rez HD's coming out at some point and Ikaruga and all that stuff.

287
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:19,937
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like...

288
00:17:21,155 --> 00:17:24,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Ikaruga Yeah, I don't know if I want to spend $10 on this one.

289
00:17:24,097 --> 00:17:26,318
[SPEAKER_09]: I can buy that for probably about $10 as well.

290
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,598
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a damn fine point.

291
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:29,999
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

292
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Ikaruga Next email, shall I?

293
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:35,282
[SPEAKER_10]: You shall.

294
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:41,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear Our Lady of the Rosary, OLR, Video Game Missionaries, Howdy, I have two questions for you fine people.

295
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:43,366
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

296
00:17:43,506 --> 00:17:44,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone be creative.

297
00:17:44,827 --> 00:17:45,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh.

298
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:46,468
[SPEAKER_10]: That is certainly creative.

299
00:17:47,828 --> 00:17:49,069
[SPEAKER_06]: I beat the ferret in your honor.

300
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:51,379
[SPEAKER_06]: and a ferret liked it.

301
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:51,379
1.

302
00:17:53,240 --> 00:18:04,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I once had a PS2, the original bigger kind, but it was getting a little spotty on playing some games and I wanted a GameCube anyway, so a couple years ago I traded it in, but now I miss the Silent Hill games, never finished 2.

303
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:05,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Why haven't you finished 2?

304
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:07,487
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the shortest one!

305
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:08,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

306
00:18:08,937 --> 00:18:11,820
[SPEAKER_06]: But I've been getting all nostalgic when you guys talk about them.

307
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:18,346
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to play Final Fantasy XII, so I'm going to buy a used one online with some birthday money.

308
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:23,850
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I'll be getting a slim PS2, and I remember reading something about the slims getting too hot and frying the unit.

309
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:32,138
[SPEAKER_06]: My question is, do I have to worry about this with used slash refurb PS2s, or have all the units in question been recalled or fixed at the time of refurbishment?

310
00:18:32,748 --> 00:18:37,532
[SPEAKER_06]: If I do have to worry about this, is there some way I can tell if the unit I get is one of the models prone to overheating?

311
00:18:37,912 --> 00:18:43,716
[SPEAKER_06]: That I personally do not know because I actually have our first PS2 still, and it works just fine.

312
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:49,240
[SPEAKER_06]: And on top of that, I have a first model Japanese PS2 that works just fine, which is an oddity.

313
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:50,521
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

314
00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:51,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing.

315
00:18:51,502 --> 00:18:57,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Any system is going to have some faulty ones, but you can take steps in making sure that the system is not going to fry itself.

316
00:18:57,646 --> 00:18:59,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Not buying it on eBay.

317
00:18:59,748 --> 00:19:00,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't put it in an oven.

318
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure it's in a well-ventilated place.

319
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:04,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't put it in a box.

320
00:19:05,221 --> 00:19:06,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care of it when you move it around.

321
00:19:07,482 --> 00:19:21,346
[SPEAKER_06]: A suggestion I do have that came back from the Dreamcast days is if you have carpet or anything, put a flat surface down like a cutting board or something and then set your system on top of that.

322
00:19:21,886 --> 00:19:30,969
[SPEAKER_06]: And that way it'll be elevated so that the vents, if the vents are underneath it, can get some... You're like the Martha Stewart of gaming.

323
00:19:32,057 --> 00:19:35,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the Dreamcast did have a problem with getting a little too hot.

324
00:19:35,218 --> 00:19:36,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Without the jail time.

325
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:38,139
[SPEAKER_06]: And without the bad hair.

326
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,160
[SPEAKER_06]: And without the fruits of the garden.

327
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,481
[SPEAKER_10]: No, my Slim PS2 works just fine.

328
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:47,763
[SPEAKER_10]: I did not buy an American PS2 until the Slims were out.

329
00:19:47,843 --> 00:19:50,183
[SPEAKER_10]: I only had a Japanese PlayStation 2 for the longest time.

330
00:19:51,464 --> 00:19:54,985
[SPEAKER_10]: And I finally bought a US one when the Slims came out.

331
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:56,826
[SPEAKER_10]: And it works just fine for me still.

332
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,347
[SPEAKER_10]: So for whatever it's worth, there you have it.

333
00:20:01,587 --> 00:20:02,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Shall I move forward?

334
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:02,748
[SPEAKER_10]: You shall.

335
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:03,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

336
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:06,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the second question by this person.

337
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:11,316
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my favorite games ever is Pokemon Snap, and I've been hoping for years they'd make a sequel, but to no avail.

338
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any other good photography... I know, I was just thinking that.

339
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:18,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other good photography-themed games out there that you would recommend?

340
00:20:18,442 --> 00:20:26,889
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Metal Gear Solid 2 had a camera, and some of the Zelda games had minigames, but other than that, I don't know anything, especially with photography figures in largely.

341
00:20:26,949 --> 00:20:27,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep on rocking.

342
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Ciao.

343
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:28,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Atreyu.

344
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:32,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I highly recommend... What's with Atreyu tonight?

345
00:20:32,284 --> 00:20:34,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Atreyu!

346
00:20:34,406 --> 00:20:34,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

347
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Say my name, Bastion.

348
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:37,228
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

349
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:41,452
[SPEAKER_09]: I highly recommend Bioshock because you have to take pictures of dead bodies.

350
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:42,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Dead Rising.

351
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:43,914
[SPEAKER_10]: Dead Rising.

352
00:20:43,954 --> 00:20:45,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Dead Rising, an awesome photography mode.

353
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:46,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Good point.

354
00:20:46,457 --> 00:20:50,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Eternal Sonata, actually... Don't get the cardcaptor Sakura game on Dreamcast.

355
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:53,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Eternal Sonata actually has a photographer.

356
00:20:53,406 --> 00:20:58,670
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the characters, their special move, they can take photos and you can control what's taken a picture of.

357
00:20:58,911 --> 00:21:00,692
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can sell the photos at shops.

358
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:02,394
[SPEAKER_10]: And the better the picture, the more they sell for.

359
00:21:02,454 --> 00:21:03,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing.

360
00:21:03,355 --> 00:21:06,838
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually one of the things I should have said was one of my kind of complaints about the game.

361
00:21:07,258 --> 00:21:09,340
[SPEAKER_10]: It totally throws the game off balance.

362
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Like weapons and things in the part of the game I'm in are like 800 gold, 1,000 gold maybe.

363
00:21:14,945 --> 00:21:16,947
[SPEAKER_10]: You can sell one picture for 14,000 gold.

364
00:21:19,382 --> 00:21:23,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Gold is not a factor in this game if you just take ten pictures and sell them all.

365
00:21:23,845 --> 00:21:25,786
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they don't even have to be that good of pictures.

366
00:21:26,147 --> 00:21:33,251
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one other little bitch I have about Eternal Sonata, is that I think somebody threw the photo system way out of whack in testing.

367
00:21:34,172 --> 00:21:34,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Next email?

368
00:21:34,912 --> 00:21:35,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

369
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:39,155
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not certain, but I believe this is the same... Okay, this is something else from Rob.

370
00:21:39,696 --> 00:21:43,638
[SPEAKER_06]: About the man who died after three days straight in the internet cafe in China.

371
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:45,880
[SPEAKER_06]: The game he played was Online Bridge.

372
00:21:47,102 --> 00:21:53,528
[SPEAKER_06]: How unexciting, but it shows that it's self-neglect from obsession, not an MMO or other game.

373
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:55,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Good point.

374
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Because most of us automatically think, oh, he was playing Warcraft.

375
00:21:58,432 --> 00:21:59,333
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he was playing Bridge.

376
00:21:59,614 --> 00:22:02,296
[SPEAKER_06]: It's these people who do online poker or some shit.

377
00:22:02,316 --> 00:22:02,997
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Final Fantasy XI.

378
00:22:03,017 --> 00:22:03,737
[SPEAKER_10]: It was Evercrack.

379
00:22:03,938 --> 00:22:05,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Evercrack takes another soul.

380
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:06,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope, it was online Bridge.

381
00:22:07,301 --> 00:22:08,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Hoyle is deadly.

382
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:12,505
[SPEAKER_06]: So shall I keep going?

383
00:22:12,786 --> 00:22:13,126
[SPEAKER_10]: You shall.

384
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:25,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear OLR, I recently joined a game rental service and decided to rent out Earth Defense Force, although it was the PS2 version since I don't have a 360, to find out whether Loki's claims were accurate or not, and they are, sort of.

385
00:22:25,852 --> 00:22:26,573
[SPEAKER_06]: The game is fun.

386
00:22:26,633 --> 00:22:27,334
[SPEAKER_06]: It is really fun.

387
00:22:27,354 --> 00:22:35,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Destroying armies of ants, sorry, gigantors, is supremely satisfying, and the way that you can mold the battlegrounds by destroying the infected city is genius.

388
00:22:35,697 --> 00:22:43,820
[SPEAKER_06]: The variation in weapon types gives the game an element of strategy and all loads extremely quickly, very useful on some difficulty levels.

389
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,101
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot I played more of Earth Defense Force this week as well.

390
00:22:48,262 --> 00:22:51,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you're just so used to it that it just blends in with the rest of your schedule.

391
00:22:51,463 --> 00:22:51,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

392
00:22:52,589 --> 00:23:01,412
[SPEAKER_06]: The game's budget nature is very obvious from the horrible color scheme that makes some levels look like big piles of sludge to the plot, which is basic to say the least.

393
00:23:01,953 --> 00:23:08,635
[SPEAKER_06]: It's common to find the alien invaders trapped in the scenery, while the variations in enemy types are small and uninteresting visually.

394
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:15,318
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some that fly, some that shoot suspicious looking brown stuff from their bottoms, but in the end they're all ants.

395
00:23:15,965 --> 00:23:20,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether these problems are dealt with in the sequel, I don't know, but they don't detract from the game too much.

396
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:24,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Put simply, the game is a grand version of squashing armies of ants like I did when I was a kid.

397
00:23:24,873 --> 00:23:26,535
[SPEAKER_06]: The squashing ants never seems to get old.

398
00:23:26,735 --> 00:23:27,295
[SPEAKER_06]: The Afro guy.

399
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:32,580
[SPEAKER_10]: I still have yet to play Earth Defense Force.

400
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,521
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to have to check it out.

401
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:42,389
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm telling you, they need, and there's another story we're going to get to later, they need to bring out the other PlayStation 2 games and

402
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:46,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Convert them over to be able to be played on some of these systems over here.

403
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:55,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, all the games have been almost exactly the same, just different locations and stuff, but I don't think they get old at all.

404
00:23:55,271 --> 00:24:00,414
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still a very scary thought to me that our reviews and suggestions on games actually influence people.

405
00:24:00,434 --> 00:24:01,775
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of scary.

406
00:24:02,636 --> 00:24:06,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, speaking of someone wanting some influence, we got an email from the doctor!

407
00:24:07,258 --> 00:24:08,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, hooray!

408
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,240
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the doctor!

409
00:24:10,861 --> 00:24:11,641
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'm going to read it.

410
00:24:12,324 --> 00:24:14,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw the Dalek the other night too.

411
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I have the remote controlled Dalek.

412
00:24:41,428 --> 00:24:42,268
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

413
00:25:09,482 --> 00:25:09,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

414
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:42,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Fans of Drum Mania or Keyboard Mania will notice this first, as those two games let you hit as many extra notes as you wanted to without penalizing you, and therefore let you improvise a bit.

415
00:25:43,261 --> 00:25:47,242
[SPEAKER_06]: In Rock Band, you can't improvise until you're told to, except sometimes on vocals.

416
00:25:48,903 --> 00:25:53,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Second, the drum pedal on the pre-release units works just like in Arcade Drum Mania.

417
00:25:53,504 --> 00:25:59,986
[SPEAKER_06]: It's big, has a long throw and relatively little resistance, and it triggers somewhere near the end of its throw, but not all the way at the end.

418
00:26:00,046 --> 00:26:01,586
[SPEAKER_06]: No quick bass rolls with your toes here.

419
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:07,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Third, the drum pedals connect to the main unit by a 1.8 inch mono phone plugs.

420
00:26:08,043 --> 00:26:09,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically the mono headphone jack.

421
00:26:10,724 --> 00:26:12,545
[SPEAKER_06]: These work electrically like I think they do.

422
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:19,269
[SPEAKER_06]: You should be able to wire two of them in parallel using a mono headphone splitter and make a double bass so that you can be the god of thunder.

423
00:26:20,209 --> 00:26:23,911
[SPEAKER_06]: I asked a Harmonix dev about this and he said he will try it at the office and get back to me.

424
00:26:24,392 --> 00:26:25,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Fourth, Byrite sucks.

425
00:26:26,573 --> 00:26:27,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they do.

426
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:32,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Fifth, there is a crazy advanced lag compensation tool built in case your TV internally desyncs audio and video.

427
00:26:32,363 --> 00:26:32,824
[SPEAKER_10]: I love harmonics.

428
00:26:50,805 --> 00:26:53,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly, the new guitar buttons and switches feel very solid and responsive.

429
00:26:54,327 --> 00:27:00,070
[SPEAKER_06]: This drum bar is a bit longer now and does not use clicking micro switches, but still seems to be pretty accurate.

430
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:04,833
[SPEAKER_06]: I have experimentally verified that it works well played behind your head and between your legs.

431
00:27:05,493 --> 00:27:07,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking forward to your next show tonight, Warrior Bob.

432
00:27:08,655 --> 00:27:12,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, see, mine must have been busted from constant use or something.

433
00:27:13,318 --> 00:27:14,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone must have broke it.

434
00:27:14,298 --> 00:27:19,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows what kind of drunk middle-aged people were playing it.

435
00:27:20,091 --> 00:27:23,474
[SPEAKER_09]: at the event that I went to, but it's fun.

436
00:27:25,495 --> 00:27:25,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like fun.

437
00:27:26,196 --> 00:27:26,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that it for email?

438
00:27:27,157 --> 00:27:28,257
[SPEAKER_06]: That be all, sir.

439
00:27:28,678 --> 00:27:29,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye, email bag.

440
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:30,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Send us more.

441
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:31,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag at orangeonestradio.com.

442
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,841
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what we have missed, though?

443
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:33,301
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

444
00:27:33,381 --> 00:27:34,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Talk Like a Pirate Day?

445
00:27:34,022 --> 00:27:34,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk Like a Pirate Day.

446
00:27:34,702 --> 00:27:37,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you said R. I was like, did you celebrate?

447
00:27:38,045 --> 00:27:42,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I did by making a one-line comment in my live journal.

448
00:27:42,572 --> 00:27:44,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it was Talk Like a Pirate Day.

449
00:27:44,293 --> 00:27:44,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I was off that day.

450
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:48,794
[SPEAKER_06]: So I made like a pirate and slept in my cabin.

451
00:27:48,915 --> 00:27:50,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I was doing other pirate related things.

452
00:27:51,716 --> 00:27:53,776
[SPEAKER_06]: I was pirating comic books.

453
00:27:54,217 --> 00:27:58,038
[SPEAKER_10]: I sent an email to all my coworkers with something from I Can Ask Cheeseburger.

454
00:27:58,838 --> 00:28:03,260
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, you better have a good and productive work day today or else I'm going to send you to the captain.

455
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,581
[SPEAKER_10]: It was Talk Like a Pirate Day.

456
00:28:04,961 --> 00:28:08,302
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a little kitty that had a little hook and a pirate hat on.

457
00:28:08,682 --> 00:28:09,523
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that picture.

458
00:28:09,543 --> 00:28:10,523
[SPEAKER_10]: It said something like,

459
00:28:10,743 --> 00:28:11,543
[SPEAKER_06]: I can have booty.

460
00:28:11,743 --> 00:28:14,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Or no, it said something like, why are you laughing?

461
00:28:14,245 --> 00:28:14,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Walk plank.

462
00:28:14,905 --> 00:28:16,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Or I said walk plank or something like that.

463
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,046
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really funny.

464
00:28:17,126 --> 00:28:18,046
[SPEAKER_10]: So I sent that to my coworkers.

465
00:28:18,306 --> 00:28:19,107
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I celebrated.

466
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:20,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm lame.

467
00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:20,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

468
00:28:23,148 --> 00:28:23,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

469
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:51,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I know I'm not supposed to show Jamie on the cam, and I won't, but I can show that she gets a fancy little blue chair to sit on.

470
00:28:52,302 --> 00:28:54,782
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can see, like, I'm showing her feet on the footstool.

471
00:28:55,723 --> 00:28:58,124
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see this fancy little chair that she gets to sit in.

472
00:28:58,684 --> 00:29:03,706
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why Loki has to take the crappy chair, because the woman took the nice chair, I guess.

473
00:29:04,646 --> 00:29:05,306
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how it goes.

474
00:29:06,066 --> 00:29:06,567
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you have it.

475
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:08,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow.

476
00:29:11,428 --> 00:29:12,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on to another story.

477
00:29:13,422 --> 00:29:14,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Project Gotham Racing 4 Demo

478
00:29:28,374 --> 00:29:32,277
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's going to have content I guess that's exclusive to the demo itself.

479
00:29:32,757 --> 00:29:38,200
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I guess there's supposed to be some electric versus gas engine race that they're going to be doing.

480
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:44,684
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also going to be arcade mode, which is going to be exclusive to it, set in Macau, I guess.

481
00:29:45,144 --> 00:29:45,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Macau.

482
00:29:46,465 --> 00:29:48,987
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's going to feature exclusive challenges.

483
00:29:49,507 --> 00:29:51,588
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess that's kind of neat that it's going to have that.

484
00:29:53,729 --> 00:29:55,971
[SPEAKER_09]: They're also going to feature a time trial for...

485
00:29:57,623 --> 00:30:00,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like Nurburgrin Snow.

486
00:30:01,405 --> 00:30:03,387
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's... Yeah.

487
00:30:03,727 --> 00:30:06,969
[SPEAKER_09]: It says it's due out... Well, the game I know is due out, like, in what?

488
00:30:07,969 --> 00:30:08,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Two weeks?

489
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,771
[SPEAKER_09]: So the demo's gotta be coming out here pretty soon, I'd imagine.

490
00:30:12,032 --> 00:30:14,893
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of weird that the demo would have, like, something special.

491
00:30:16,374 --> 00:30:22,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe... It would be kind of cool if, like, whatever content was in the demo, you could get in the game because you downloaded the demo.

492
00:30:23,118 --> 00:30:24,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, some type of, like, unlock.

493
00:30:24,219 --> 00:30:24,459
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

494
00:30:24,479 --> 00:30:25,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's just like what they did with, um...

495
00:30:27,163 --> 00:30:28,104
[SPEAKER_09]: NINJAGATING SIGMA

496
00:30:41,816 --> 00:30:48,341
[SPEAKER_10]: One thing on the Xbox 360 that some folks were doing on Talk Like a Pirate Day was doing some piracy of their own.

497
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:51,203
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was leaking Halo 3 onto the internet.

498
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:52,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's right.

499
00:30:52,464 --> 00:30:56,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Halo 3 made its way to some Wares sites.

500
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,490
[SPEAKER_10]: 6.14 gigabytes is how big the game clocks in as.

501
00:31:00,671 --> 00:31:10,018
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, you know, kind of sucks that people are doing this and taking away from the folks that have spent so much hard time and effort developing the game.

502
00:31:10,438 --> 00:31:11,319
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same time,

503
00:31:12,193 --> 00:31:13,494
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

504
00:31:38,826 --> 00:31:40,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Where it's undetectable.

505
00:31:40,347 --> 00:31:41,528
[SPEAKER_09]: I think all of it's done.

506
00:31:41,548 --> 00:31:46,971
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's going to be hard for them to do that because they have some sort of encryption on there.

507
00:31:46,991 --> 00:32:00,019
[SPEAKER_09]: So if that's cracked, then the only other thing is there's a media detector or something like that that detects whether you're playing a CD-R, a DVD-R, a press CD, DVD, etc.

508
00:32:00,939 --> 00:32:07,063
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you can change that, if you can get that to go over so that makes a DVD-R look like a press DVD...

509
00:32:08,055 --> 00:32:08,615
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

510
00:32:33,683 --> 00:32:34,485
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

511
00:32:41,454 --> 00:32:45,615
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but when they try to take these things online, won't it kind of screw it up?

512
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:46,836
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

513
00:32:47,076 --> 00:32:53,758
[SPEAKER_09]: If the system can't tell that it's not an official game, then no, there won't be any problems.

514
00:32:54,018 --> 00:33:01,621
[SPEAKER_09]: It's if you run a special firmware or something that disables that checking, that's when you're going to run into problems.

515
00:33:01,741 --> 00:33:09,564
[SPEAKER_09]: But if the system itself cannot tell that it's a burned copy and you haven't modified it in any way, then...

516
00:33:10,245 --> 00:33:11,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you will be able to get away with it.

517
00:33:13,709 --> 00:33:14,150
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

518
00:33:14,831 --> 00:33:25,083
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, I imagine, though, it's just a small percentage, a very, very, very small percentage of people that are able to get away with this, and the game will still sell like hotcakes the day it was released.

519
00:33:25,123 --> 00:33:26,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they're going to make tons of money.

520
00:33:26,345 --> 00:33:27,326
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a problem.

521
00:33:28,137 --> 00:33:32,100
[SPEAKER_09]: And besides, the people that are pirating it probably had no intention of buying it in the first place.

522
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,042
[SPEAKER_10]: And Loki, you did not get banned for playing Halo 3 early, right?

523
00:33:35,242 --> 00:33:36,083
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I did not.

524
00:33:36,483 --> 00:33:41,908
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing, here's the only thing that they did do is the matchmaking servers aren't up, so you can't play online.

525
00:33:42,968 --> 00:33:43,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, noes.

526
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:45,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, right now, until they start them.

527
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:46,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Well...

528
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:53,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that you can play online on Xbox Live is Viva Pinata Party.

529
00:33:53,773 --> 00:33:54,673
[SPEAKER_06]: The demo is up.

530
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:57,635
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Viva Pinata Party Animals is up.

531
00:33:57,675 --> 00:33:58,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

532
00:33:58,675 --> 00:34:02,297
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 971.17 megabytes.

533
00:34:04,258 --> 00:34:07,620
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically a big minigame compilation, and it's, of course, by Rare.

534
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:16,384
[SPEAKER_06]: So the official game is going to be out by Christmas with over 40 minigames, and you can burp boats down a stream.

535
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:19,018
[SPEAKER_06]: and Smash Up Gardens.

536
00:34:21,481 --> 00:34:23,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Burping Boats is just so much fun, you know.

537
00:34:24,024 --> 00:34:27,928
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a racing game mixed with mini-games.

538
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:33,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Escapist in our chatroom asks, will someone be proposing on that one as well?

539
00:34:33,235 --> 00:34:34,737
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, funny story.

540
00:34:35,766 --> 00:34:36,967
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.com.

541
00:34:58,339 --> 00:34:59,540
[SPEAKER_10]: www.DarkSakura.com

542
00:35:17,828 --> 00:35:27,770
[SPEAKER_10]: Really wanted to do an interview on iChat, and unfortunately the way we're wired, where we have the Mac laptop does our Operator 11 stuff, and the PC does most of the audio here, it just wouldn't work for me to do iChat.

543
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:30,771
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm hoping we can call him this week and get him on the show next week.

544
00:35:31,011 --> 00:35:35,392
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're listening, Mr. Pinata, let's make that interview happen this week.

545
00:35:36,112 --> 00:35:36,932
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can clear the air.

546
00:35:37,812 --> 00:35:40,733
[SPEAKER_09]: I still think it's kind of retarded, but we'll go with that.

547
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:41,973
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like those people who...

548
00:35:42,631 --> 00:35:48,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Who proposed, though, on the big screens, but that I sort of feel like you're pressuring someone into saying yes.

549
00:35:49,016 --> 00:35:53,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's just... If it's in a public place like that... But I don't think it was.

550
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,040
[SPEAKER_10]: It was in their home.

551
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if it's in their home, that's one thing.

552
00:35:55,562 --> 00:35:57,343
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we'll find out soon.

553
00:35:57,383 --> 00:35:58,604
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to ask all the questions.

554
00:35:58,624 --> 00:36:07,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Because part of me kind of goes, is this really big to be on all these different blogs?

555
00:36:07,651 --> 00:36:09,493
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, this is kind of a private matter in a way.

556
00:36:10,457 --> 00:36:10,737
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

557
00:36:10,757 --> 00:36:11,097
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

558
00:36:11,437 --> 00:36:11,797
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

559
00:36:11,897 --> 00:36:12,898
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get our questions answered.

560
00:36:13,418 --> 00:36:13,938
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm excited.

561
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:16,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Back to the gaming news then.

562
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:17,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

563
00:36:19,779 --> 00:36:27,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, one thing I'm excited about, as I hinted before, the Simple series is possibly coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

564
00:36:28,782 --> 00:36:34,023
[SPEAKER_09]: According to some digging done during Tokyo Game Show,

565
00:36:34,848 --> 00:36:39,512
[SPEAKER_09]: The Simple 2000 series, which of course brought us wonderful games, much like Earth Defense Force.

566
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:49,681
[SPEAKER_09]: They're talking about releasing some of them on, of course, the online service, and possibly also the PlayStation Network as well.

567
00:36:50,422 --> 00:37:00,151
[SPEAKER_09]: And according to Kotaku's article here, it says they're asking about the possibility of the series turning up as downloadable titles, and they said that...

568
00:37:01,656 --> 00:37:05,941
[SPEAKER_09]: They had two cheap, easy games coming out on Xbox Live Arcade soon.

569
00:37:06,581 --> 00:37:10,666
[SPEAKER_09]: So, maybe we'll see some more stuff from that series come over.

570
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:12,067
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope they port some of that stuff.

571
00:37:12,568 --> 00:37:17,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there was some weird shit over there, like Zombies vs. Abulences.

572
00:37:17,493 --> 00:37:20,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

573
00:37:21,217 --> 00:37:21,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotta love it.

574
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:23,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Well...

575
00:37:24,372 --> 00:37:25,293
[SPEAKER_10]: You gotta love this too.

576
00:37:25,353 --> 00:37:26,633
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Loki loves this.

577
00:37:27,013 --> 00:37:27,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Lesbians!

578
00:37:28,694 --> 00:37:30,735
[SPEAKER_09]: I do love me some lesbians.

579
00:37:30,755 --> 00:37:32,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you'll definitely want to pick up Mass Effect.

580
00:37:32,816 --> 00:37:33,736
[SPEAKER_09]: I was already gonna pick it up.

581
00:37:33,756 --> 00:37:34,777
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like the icing on the cake.

582
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:47,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, apparently, Mass Effect has been causing some waves in the gaming blogs and the gaming news sites this week because, apparently, if you play as a female character, there is a sex scene that you can initiate in the game.

583
00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:54,050
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can initiate this scene between her and a male human or a female humanoid alien.

584
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:57,231
[SPEAKER_10]: So you get some female-on-female action.

585
00:37:57,811 --> 00:37:58,691
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the thing, though.

586
00:37:58,731 --> 00:38:00,492
[SPEAKER_10]: You can also play as a male character.

587
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:05,093
[SPEAKER_10]: However, a male character can only initiate sex between him and a human woman.

588
00:38:05,962 --> 00:38:09,506
[SPEAKER_10]: or the humanoid female alien.

589
00:38:09,947 --> 00:38:14,211
[SPEAKER_10]: So, no man sex, but Lesbo's okay.

590
00:38:14,271 --> 00:38:15,673
[SPEAKER_06]: But surprise, butt sex is great.

591
00:38:17,154 --> 00:38:18,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's another thing, okay?

592
00:38:19,236 --> 00:38:19,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a thought.

593
00:38:20,117 --> 00:38:23,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe the storyline, it's between these two women anyways.

594
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:26,564
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, you know, you either pick one or the other or something like that.

595
00:38:26,644 --> 00:38:28,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe because your character...

596
00:38:28,513 --> 00:38:32,075
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't make a branching type of storyline or something for this one part.

597
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:32,775
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

598
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:37,057
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're saying this lesbian sex is for artistic and story purposes.

599
00:38:37,277 --> 00:38:39,919
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like the character in the game or something.

600
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:48,003
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, wasn't there something in Knights of the Old Republic or Jade Empire or something like that where they had something similar?

601
00:38:48,423 --> 00:38:50,924
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was Knights of the Old Republic 2 or maybe the first one.

602
00:38:51,739 --> 00:38:52,860
[SPEAKER_09]: www.DarkSakura.com

603
00:39:31,516 --> 00:39:32,917
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?

604
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:36,179
[SPEAKER_10]: I know lack of gay sex makes you mad.

605
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.

606
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:46,725
[SPEAKER_06]: But F you to male drivers, especially stupid old men, and men who drive big trucks and SUVs.

607
00:39:47,826 --> 00:39:51,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Every last bad driver I've encountered on the road has been male.

608
00:39:52,489 --> 00:40:01,234
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, when I was picking up Dan from the airport yesterday, there was a guy driving an Altima, and he was drifting into my lane.

609
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:30,947
[SPEAKER_06]: and I didn't know if he was just changing lanes without signaling or if he was just old and stupid he seemed to lean about middle age but he almost bumped me off the road until I banged on the horn and his wife shook him awake he couldn't have been more than 50 so he wasn't that old but I was like, he's a stupid man and then this guy driving a truck cutting off everybody in front of him just being an asshole driver

610
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:36,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I consider being an asshole driver is pretty much equivalent with being a bad driver.

611
00:40:36,527 --> 00:40:39,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you're supposed to maintain your cool and calm on the road.

612
00:40:40,168 --> 00:40:43,349
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you do get angry, you're not supposed to let it affect how you drive.

613
00:40:43,669 --> 00:40:45,890
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy was cutting off everybody left and right.

614
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:49,791
[SPEAKER_06]: He made one car swerve, and I did thankfully get to see him pull over.

615
00:40:49,851 --> 00:40:53,472
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I was going to say, I saw an asshole driver get pulled over this week, and it was very satisfying.

616
00:40:54,289 --> 00:41:00,532
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, um, you know, I saw so many people just changing lanes without signaling and almost causing accidents.

617
00:41:00,652 --> 00:41:02,612
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, every last one of them happened to be male.

618
00:41:04,273 --> 00:41:09,195
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would like to point out there that bad drivers are bad drivers regardless of gender.

619
00:41:09,235 --> 00:41:10,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut the fuck up.

620
00:41:11,016 --> 00:41:11,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Next, please.

621
00:41:12,977 --> 00:41:13,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways.

622
00:41:14,316 --> 00:41:17,678
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't really have anything to make an FU for, but now I do.

623
00:41:18,178 --> 00:41:21,760
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yes, once again, women drivers, horrible.

624
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,922
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I bet that guy falling asleep is probably falling asleep from nagging from his wife.

625
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:28,344
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I blame her for that.

626
00:41:28,384 --> 00:41:33,947
[SPEAKER_09]: But, yeah, there are a lot of bad drivers, especially SUV drivers, cell phone drivers.

627
00:41:34,007 --> 00:41:36,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Cell phone drivers are even worse than stupid men.

628
00:41:36,688 --> 00:41:38,309
[SPEAKER_09]: And a combination of those as well.

629
00:41:38,409 --> 00:41:41,331
[SPEAKER_09]: So, fuck you to bad drivers, no matter which sex.

630
00:41:42,772 --> 00:41:43,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Mainly women drivers.

631
00:41:44,051 --> 00:41:46,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, cell phone drivers are the worst.

632
00:41:47,292 --> 00:41:47,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Rob.

633
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:49,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's all right.

634
00:41:49,433 --> 00:41:51,874
[SPEAKER_10]: I have my Bluetooth now, so it doesn't matter.

635
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:52,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

636
00:41:53,935 --> 00:41:56,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I never got in an accident while talking in the phone and driving.

637
00:41:56,776 --> 00:41:58,336
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an urban legend.

638
00:41:59,637 --> 00:42:01,937
[SPEAKER_10]: It's made up, just like how man actually went to the moon.

639
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:04,498
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all made up, those cell phones.

640
00:42:04,558 --> 00:42:05,238
[SPEAKER_10]: What was I going to say?

641
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:12,221
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really have a whole lot of FUs, so I'll just say, I don't know.

642
00:42:13,434 --> 00:42:15,735
[SPEAKER_10]: FU to lack of angst this week.

643
00:42:15,775 --> 00:42:16,835
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually in a pretty good mood.

644
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:19,456
[SPEAKER_10]: FU to the million and one projects I have at work.

645
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:21,317
[SPEAKER_10]: I have so many projects at work.

646
00:42:21,357 --> 00:42:22,377
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm all project out.

647
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Projects are work of the devil.

648
00:42:24,898 --> 00:42:25,699
[SPEAKER_10]: I have too many of them.

649
00:42:26,759 --> 00:42:27,139
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

650
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:28,820
[SPEAKER_10]: A rather tame FU this week.

651
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:30,661
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you have it.

652
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:33,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Another successful FUs of the week segment.

653
00:42:33,121 --> 00:42:35,282
[SPEAKER_09]: I have one last thing I was just going to add in there real quick.

654
00:42:35,362 --> 00:42:35,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh lordy.

655
00:42:36,283 --> 00:42:42,065
[SPEAKER_09]: FU to the Halo 3 launch because I fucking hate having to deal with customers asking about when they're going to get Halo 3.

656
00:42:43,643 --> 00:42:44,945
[SPEAKER_10]: You get it when it's good and ready.

657
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:45,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

658
00:42:46,226 --> 00:42:47,547
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how you should respond to them, too.

659
00:42:49,229 --> 00:42:50,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, back to some gaming news.

660
00:42:53,653 --> 00:43:01,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anyone who is interested in watching movies and things on Xbox Live will be happy.

661
00:43:01,981 --> 00:43:03,182
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an anime fan, at least.

662
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,940
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be happy to know that S.T.A.R.S.

663
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,721
[SPEAKER_06]: is bringing different shows.

664
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:16,745
[SPEAKER_06]: We are getting Ghost in the Shell, Standalone Complex, Both Seasons, Street Fighter 2V, Noyan, Toko, Virus, and Astro Boy.

665
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:19,666
[SPEAKER_06]: There's actually a bunch more.

666
00:43:21,246 --> 00:43:25,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the other ones that were listed is...

667
00:43:28,157 --> 00:43:38,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, at least they have particular access to was like Blood the Last Vampire, A Different Loop in the Third, Appleseed, Blood the Last Vampire, Ninja Scroll, Perfect Blue.

668
00:43:38,226 --> 00:43:38,987
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Perfect Blue.

669
00:43:40,888 --> 00:43:41,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Just different series.

670
00:43:44,271 --> 00:43:46,533
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't seen a single one of those series you mentioned.

671
00:43:46,653 --> 00:43:49,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect Blue was like, oh my god, head trip.

672
00:43:50,216 --> 00:43:51,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen it twice in the theater.

673
00:43:51,938 --> 00:43:52,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect Blue was weird.

674
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:54,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect Blue was awesome.

675
00:43:55,449 --> 00:44:01,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, some people are not so happy about NHL 2K8 charging you $5 to unlock a feature that's already on the game.

676
00:44:02,813 --> 00:44:14,939
[SPEAKER_09]: This feature, of course, is actually the 2K ReelMaker add-on, and it will allow you to do a variety of video recording and playback options for the game.

677
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:23,984
[SPEAKER_09]: But the download was a Puny 108K, which means that you're just paying for an unlock key for something that's already on the disc.

678
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:26,439
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

679
00:44:43,465 --> 00:44:44,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Eternalsonata Eternalsonata

680
00:45:09,901 --> 00:45:16,773
[SPEAKER_10]: There's, I mean, sports games, you know, you play over and over and over again in little bursts, but a game like Eternal Sonata is really meant to be played start to finish.

681
00:45:17,194 --> 00:45:19,498
[SPEAKER_10]: So what good does this, I don't know, it doesn't make sense.

682
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:23,204
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just hoping for people to buy these things at a push of a button.

683
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:31,644
[SPEAKER_10]: What does make a little more sense is buying things that were not included with the original game, such as new outfits.

684
00:45:32,345 --> 00:45:36,988
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is pretty interesting, is that Bomberman Live is going to be getting a new download pack.

685
00:45:37,008 --> 00:45:39,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I believe it's already up, this new download pack they have.

686
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:47,214
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the characters that's in the download pack is based off of the mascot from Destructoid.com, which of course is another gaming blog.

687
00:45:47,234 --> 00:45:50,076
[SPEAKER_10]: We had some of those guys on our year-end show a while ago.

688
00:45:50,736 --> 00:45:51,877
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have to have them back sometime.

689
00:45:51,917 --> 00:46:00,165
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, they've crossed over from gaming press blog site into video game character with their little mascot, that green little robot face thing.

690
00:46:01,106 --> 00:46:03,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I thought it was silver in some of the pictures I've seen, but whatever.

691
00:46:03,989 --> 00:46:11,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Color be damned, the little mascot has certainly made a name for itself now by crossing over into a OMG legitimate video game.

692
00:46:14,108 --> 00:46:18,129
[SPEAKER_10]: So where's the giant Loki head for future expansions?

693
00:46:18,169 --> 00:46:23,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, people would argue that it would have to be a Tingle head because they're fascinated with the character Tingle.

694
00:46:23,751 --> 00:46:25,972
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not understand this, but whatever.

695
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:28,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Then that wouldn't work because you're crossing over Nintendo.

696
00:46:28,853 --> 00:46:32,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Then they would say, well, he should be in Super Smash Bros.

697
00:46:32,114 --> 00:46:34,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Brawl as Tingle, dressed up as Tingle.

698
00:46:34,575 --> 00:46:35,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there you go.

699
00:46:35,415 --> 00:46:37,196
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an awesome idea.

700
00:46:37,256 --> 00:46:38,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't we make that happen?

701
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:39,036
[SPEAKER_09]: No, just kidding.

702
00:46:39,076 --> 00:46:39,917
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's not an awesome idea.

703
00:46:39,937 --> 00:46:41,997
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like mixing the matter with antimatter.

704
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:42,618
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

705
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:49,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Escapist in our chatroom asks, if Destructoid can do it, why not Bomberman based on the OLR staff?

706
00:46:49,142 --> 00:46:50,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's a very nice thought.

707
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:54,665
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure, A, Destructoid gets like a million more hits in a month than we do.

708
00:46:54,925 --> 00:46:57,226
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just a tiny little show in somebody's spare bedroom.

709
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas Destructoid is like, they've come a long way.

710
00:47:00,868 --> 00:47:02,349
[SPEAKER_10]: They've only been around, what, like a year and a half?

711
00:47:02,369 --> 00:47:03,029
[SPEAKER_10]: They've come a long way.

712
00:47:05,451 --> 00:47:13,435
[SPEAKER_10]: B, I seem to recall that a couple weeks ago, I don't know if it was their E3 coverage, or they had some coverage of some expo that was sponsored by...

713
00:47:15,121 --> 00:47:32,681
[SPEAKER_10]: and they had like ads all over their site so they had some type of relationship going on with the folks that made Bomberman so you know that's kind of cool though I'm not knocking it I think it's awesome what happened and I love the fact that the Microsoft community as a whole is really seeming to embrace the community more and more

714
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:40,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of our other buddy podcasts, such as the Gamerscore blog and Gamertag Radio.

715
00:47:40,172 --> 00:47:42,133
[SPEAKER_10]: What are all those guys called together?

716
00:47:42,233 --> 00:47:42,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Gamercast.

717
00:47:43,214 --> 00:47:45,354
[SPEAKER_10]: They all have their own pictures up on the marketplace.

718
00:47:45,374 --> 00:47:45,995
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty rad.

719
00:47:46,715 --> 00:47:48,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully we'll see more of those very soon.

720
00:47:48,315 --> 00:47:48,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

721
00:47:50,656 --> 00:47:52,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, back to the gaming news.

722
00:47:56,618 --> 00:48:01,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, something that should interest a few people, especially that are mobile phone gamers...

723
00:48:02,301 --> 00:48:09,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming out will be Rockman Dash, which is one of the Mega Man Legends series.

724
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:14,848
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a new Rockman Dash game, and those fuckers didn't put it on a damn console that I can play.

725
00:48:15,448 --> 00:48:16,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Cell phones do not need more games.

726
00:48:16,909 --> 00:48:18,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate the Mega Man Legends games.

727
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:31,176
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also Resident Evil 4 Mobile Edition, Devil May Cry, Dante vs. Virgil, Sengoku Basara, Tactical RPG, and Breath of Fire 4.

728
00:48:33,186 --> 00:48:35,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't mind having Breath of Fire 4 on my phone.

729
00:48:36,567 --> 00:48:38,568
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, that's all Japanese only right now.

730
00:48:40,469 --> 00:48:41,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but it's mobile phone, so who cares?

731
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:43,190
[SPEAKER_06]: I care.

732
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:44,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I play Luminous on my phone.

733
00:48:44,971 --> 00:48:45,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

734
00:48:45,511 --> 00:48:45,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

735
00:48:46,231 --> 00:48:46,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

736
00:48:47,732 --> 00:48:48,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

737
00:48:48,872 --> 00:48:53,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, first of all, I can sneak around outside at work and play it.

738
00:48:54,255 --> 00:48:55,395
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's actually not too bad.

739
00:48:55,595 --> 00:48:58,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I enjoy Luminous on mobile phones too, I have to be honest.

740
00:48:58,476 --> 00:48:59,577
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to load it up right now.

741
00:49:00,057 --> 00:49:00,857
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm playing during a show.

742
00:49:00,877 --> 00:49:02,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you have fun with that, Miss Thing.

743
00:49:02,578 --> 00:49:02,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I will.

744
00:49:04,051 --> 00:49:14,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, so, maybe you're looking to find that special someone to eventually proclaim your love over Viva Pinata 2.

745
00:49:15,297 --> 00:49:16,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, fear not.

746
00:49:16,958 --> 00:49:26,804
[SPEAKER_09]: We're here to help you, and thanks to the Sexy Video Game Land blog, they have compiled a list of what they think are... What a great blog name, by the way, might I add.

747
00:49:27,204 --> 00:49:30,406
[SPEAKER_09]: The best video game pickup lines.

748
00:49:31,206 --> 00:49:32,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Here are some to...

749
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,460
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you say?

750
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,981
[SPEAKER_09]: I take my flag to your base and score.

751
00:49:40,021 --> 00:49:42,161
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you ever been in a five man raid?

752
00:49:43,922 --> 00:49:47,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey baby, I need a new hoe and it ain't for gardening.

753
00:49:48,383 --> 00:49:49,984
[SPEAKER_09]: How does that have anything to do with video games?

754
00:49:50,044 --> 00:49:50,864
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Harvest Moon.

755
00:49:51,384 --> 00:49:52,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh god.

756
00:49:52,084 --> 00:49:53,184
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so stupid.

757
00:49:53,705 --> 00:49:58,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me call you Silent Hill because things really get freaky when I'm inside you.

758
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:03,140
[SPEAKER_09]: I know how Mario must feel because I really want to clean your pipes.

759
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Call me Ash because I choose you.

760
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:10,863
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a warp zone in my pants.

761
00:50:12,604 --> 00:50:13,264
[SPEAKER_10]: I made that one up.

762
00:50:13,544 --> 00:50:14,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, let's see.

763
00:50:14,505 --> 00:50:15,865
[SPEAKER_09]: You're just like an RPG.

764
00:50:15,925 --> 00:50:21,748
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't wait to take you home, unwrap you, put it in, and then grind all the way until sun rises.

765
00:50:22,969 --> 00:50:24,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Girl, you got me like WarioWare.

766
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:25,730
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm touched.

767
00:50:26,601 --> 00:50:27,561
[SPEAKER_06]: That's stupid.

768
00:50:27,821 --> 00:50:31,563
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't be Phoenix Wright because I have no objection to you, baby.

769
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:33,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

770
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:34,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are awful.

771
00:50:35,764 --> 00:50:39,445
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're a devil, you may cry by the time I'm finished with you.

772
00:50:40,846 --> 00:50:42,486
[SPEAKER_09]: You remind me of a game of Tetris.

773
00:50:43,067 --> 00:50:45,848
[SPEAKER_09]: You always want the long ones.

774
00:50:48,028 --> 00:50:48,368
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

775
00:50:48,388 --> 00:50:50,049
[SPEAKER_09]: That doesn't even make sense.

776
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:51,450
[SPEAKER_09]: That's stupid.

777
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:55,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, baby, can I hide my solid snake in your box?

778
00:50:58,015 --> 00:50:59,476
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes me want to throw up a little.

779
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:01,698
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I did just throw up in my mouth.

780
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Now see, our chat room's joining in now.

781
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you throw up in your stomach, Rob?

782
00:51:06,821 --> 00:51:07,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh?

783
00:51:07,382 --> 00:51:08,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you throw up in your stomach?

784
00:51:09,203 --> 00:51:09,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

785
00:51:10,224 --> 00:51:12,165
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Dark Knight says, Back me wool, baby.

786
00:51:12,766 --> 00:51:14,327
[SPEAKER_10]: That's an old OLR joke.

787
00:51:14,767 --> 00:51:18,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Ranma says, Hey baby, how about I dance dance to your revolution and you beat my mania?

788
00:51:21,152 --> 00:51:21,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

789
00:51:21,872 --> 00:51:25,415
[SPEAKER_10]: GS68 says, You must play 2DX because you've got me on hard mode.

790
00:51:27,018 --> 00:51:27,598
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that one.

791
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:28,198
[SPEAKER_10]: That one's funny.

792
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Warrior Bob says, you remind me of Tetris.

793
00:51:31,801 --> 00:51:33,042
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make you disappear.

794
00:51:33,143 --> 00:51:34,584
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, wait, have sex with me.

795
00:51:36,785 --> 00:51:37,306
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that one.

796
00:51:37,406 --> 00:51:42,050
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, my favorite pickup line was always, hi, I like peanut butter.

797
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:42,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Want to fuck?

798
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:43,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Or how about this one?

799
00:51:43,971 --> 00:51:47,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Babe, you're hotter than my first edition 360s power supply.

800
00:51:48,495 --> 00:51:49,236
[SPEAKER_09]: That's lame.

801
00:51:49,596 --> 00:51:50,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Stupid.

802
00:51:51,017 --> 00:51:51,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

803
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:53,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Lame.

804
00:51:54,622 --> 00:51:57,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Baby, you can screw attack me all night long.

805
00:51:59,826 --> 00:52:03,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, Drew Nami says, you must play Tetris because you're stacked.

806
00:52:04,349 --> 00:52:05,630
[SPEAKER_06]: That one's actually kind of good.

807
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:06,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Not bad.

808
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:08,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Drew Nami has a funny joke once in a while.

809
00:52:08,652 --> 00:52:09,552
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, moving on.

810
00:52:09,612 --> 00:52:10,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Add it to the toilet paper.

811
00:52:10,553 --> 00:52:12,334
[SPEAKER_10]: For the love of God, a new story, please.

812
00:52:13,035 --> 00:52:16,397
[SPEAKER_10]: From Video Game Pickup Lines, from what was that, Sexy Game Blog?

813
00:52:16,417 --> 00:52:16,877
[SPEAKER_10]: What was that called?

814
00:52:16,917 --> 00:52:18,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Sexy Game Land Blog.

815
00:52:18,118 --> 00:52:19,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Sexy Game Land Blog, nice.

816
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on to something completely different.

817
00:52:22,751 --> 00:52:25,932
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't keep up with too many Republicans.

818
00:52:44,978 --> 00:52:53,602
[SPEAKER_10]: So imagine the irony and hilarity when you notice the Mitt Romney ad campaign ads start showing up on GameTrailers.com.

819
00:52:54,142 --> 00:52:54,602
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

820
00:52:55,422 --> 00:53:01,565
[SPEAKER_10]: A joystick snapped a picture of a GameTrailers.com site with – and it's not a Photoshop thing.

821
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:02,325
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the real deal.

822
00:53:02,365 --> 00:53:06,807
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the GameTrailers little logo there and the Mitt Romney ad right on top of the site.

823
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:11,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Hilarity that their campaign would be advertising on the site.

824
00:53:11,369 --> 00:53:11,629
[SPEAKER_10]: Now –

825
00:53:12,608 --> 00:53:28,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, I'm going to go for the obvious here and say that probably they're people or whatever bought into a package deal or some type of advertising company that distributes through all these different websites and game trailers just happens to be one of many.

826
00:53:28,161 --> 00:53:31,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Because doesn't MTV own game trailers, I want to say?

827
00:53:31,804 --> 00:53:32,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Or there's some type of partnership there?

828
00:53:32,944 --> 00:53:34,005
[SPEAKER_10]: I could be wrong, I don't remember.

829
00:53:34,426 --> 00:53:38,549
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, there's probably some much bigger thing that just showed up on that site.

830
00:53:40,828 --> 00:53:41,488
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of funny.

831
00:53:41,608 --> 00:53:43,209
[SPEAKER_09]: That's karma for you.

832
00:53:43,969 --> 00:53:46,189
[SPEAKER_10]: This is why we don't do banner ads on OrangeLawnTrader.com.

833
00:53:46,209 --> 00:53:47,590
[SPEAKER_10]: This is also why we're poor.

834
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:49,310
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd just like to point out.

835
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:51,751
[SPEAKER_10]: But irony for the win in this case.

836
00:53:52,451 --> 00:53:53,151
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you have it.

837
00:53:54,712 --> 00:53:58,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here is a little bit more for anyone who wants.

838
00:53:59,413 --> 00:54:02,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Yakuza 2 is coming out in the U.S.

839
00:54:03,094 --> 00:54:07,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Dinosaur King and Mystery Dungeon is also coming out thanks to Sega!

840
00:54:08,696 --> 00:54:09,396
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um...

841
00:54:10,735 --> 00:54:13,456
[SPEAKER_06]: They are supposed to be coming out in 2008.

842
00:54:14,497 --> 00:54:16,097
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's going to be very cool.

843
00:54:16,117 --> 00:54:19,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I honestly want... I actually was looking into a little bit on Mystery Dungeon.

844
00:54:19,819 --> 00:54:20,799
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Shiren the Wanderer.

845
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:26,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Dinosaur King is a game where you collect 100 dinosaurs with different moves and you make them fight.

846
00:54:27,842 --> 00:54:29,242
[SPEAKER_06]: And... Wow.

847
00:54:30,623 --> 00:54:33,444
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want Yakuza 2 so I can go around beating people up.

848
00:54:34,784 --> 00:54:35,705
[SPEAKER_10]: You just like violence.

849
00:54:36,105 --> 00:54:36,885
[SPEAKER_06]: I do like violence.

850
00:54:36,905 --> 00:54:38,466
[SPEAKER_06]: I like beating up people wearing nice suits.

851
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:41,257
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

852
00:54:41,797 --> 00:54:43,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, those games coming to you very soon from Sega.

853
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Also coming to you very soon, the Skype line.

854
00:54:47,303 --> 00:54:53,930
[SPEAKER_10]: You can give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

855
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:55,271
[SPEAKER_10]: We love to be interactive.

856
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,434
[SPEAKER_10]: But one more story for you real quick.

857
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:00,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I like being interactive.

858
00:55:00,177 --> 00:55:00,457
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

859
00:55:00,777 --> 00:55:01,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways.

860
00:55:02,267 --> 00:55:03,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, enough with the pickup lines, seriously.

861
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:12,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Although, I have to say this, SSJ100Matt sent me a message and says that there should be a voicemail challenge for people to leave pickup lines on the Skype line voicemail.

862
00:55:12,849 --> 00:55:13,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want some hot coffee?

863
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:16,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so please, I love that idea.

864
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:24,412
[SPEAKER_10]: So please call, if you give our number a call, either on Skype or the phone number when we're not live, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

865
00:55:24,732 --> 00:55:30,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Leave us a message with your sexy video game pickup line and we'll play some of our favorites on next week's show, but I bet you we don't get any.

866
00:55:30,976 --> 00:55:54,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, in case you had hopes and dreams that that wonderful Halo 3 Legendary Edition game box was actually going to become a brand new helmet for your cat, unfortunately, that will not be the case, because the helmet itself, as IGN found out, is not hollowed and will not fit on your cat.

867
00:55:56,462 --> 00:55:57,082
[SPEAKER_10]: That sucks.

868
00:55:57,463 --> 00:56:00,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I can't put the helmet on my cat and watch my cat run into walls?

869
00:56:00,465 --> 00:56:00,725
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

870
00:56:00,905 --> 00:56:04,007
[SPEAKER_09]: But, I mean, with some simple modding, you probably could do that.

871
00:56:04,067 --> 00:56:05,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wait, I don't own a cat.

872
00:56:06,108 --> 00:56:06,709
[SPEAKER_09]: I own a cat.

873
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:10,271
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no way a cat would put their head in that anyways.

874
00:56:10,491 --> 00:56:13,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Could we put the helmet on the ferret?

875
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that would look weird, though.

876
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:18,757
[SPEAKER_10]: That we might be able to pull off.

877
00:56:18,877 --> 00:56:20,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet Shermie's little head would fit in it.

878
00:56:21,118 --> 00:56:22,019
[SPEAKER_06]: She's got a small brain.

879
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:22,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you kidding?

880
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Shermie's the fattest cat I've ever seen.

881
00:56:25,041 --> 00:56:26,302
[SPEAKER_06]: But her brain is very small.

882
00:56:27,188 --> 00:56:29,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Cat's aren't dumb enough to put their head in there.

883
00:56:43,223 --> 00:57:02,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, as this is very interesting, well, not for me, but for maybe Rob, apparently if you were looking for some man sex type game or whatever, there's Dual Love, which is going to be coming to the DS, and it includes a part of the game where you scrub down a naked man.

884
00:57:03,454 --> 00:57:03,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

885
00:57:04,175 --> 00:57:06,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God, I saw a preview for that on some website.

886
00:57:06,736 --> 00:57:07,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to scrub down a naked man.

887
00:57:07,656 --> 00:57:08,537
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it looks stupid.

888
00:57:09,689 --> 00:57:10,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody sent me a link to it.

889
00:57:10,629 --> 00:57:11,149
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks stupid.

890
00:57:11,189 --> 00:57:12,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, we're getting some phone calls.

891
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

892
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:14,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

893
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:16,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, this is Warrior Bob.

894
00:57:16,251 --> 00:57:16,991
[SPEAKER_10]: How's it going, Scott?

895
00:57:17,011 --> 00:57:17,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Warrior Bob.

896
00:57:18,011 --> 00:57:18,391
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good.

897
00:57:18,431 --> 00:57:18,871
[SPEAKER_10]: How about you?

898
00:57:19,772 --> 00:57:20,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Not too bad.

899
00:57:20,652 --> 00:57:21,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Long time no chat.

900
00:57:22,232 --> 00:57:22,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, serious.

901
00:57:23,292 --> 00:57:25,053
[SPEAKER_10]: So we read your email about the rock band.

902
00:57:25,493 --> 00:57:25,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Good times?

903
00:57:25,853 --> 00:57:26,193
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard that.

904
00:57:26,253 --> 00:57:26,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

905
00:57:26,913 --> 00:57:29,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki went down and played it, but I missed out.

906
00:57:29,314 --> 00:57:30,554
[SPEAKER_10]: I totally forgot.

907
00:57:31,374 --> 00:57:32,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, when was he there?

908
00:57:32,555 --> 00:57:32,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Today.

909
00:57:34,295 --> 00:57:35,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's why I didn't see you.

910
00:57:36,136 --> 00:57:37,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Were you there like all day or something?

911
00:57:38,001 --> 00:57:42,682
[SPEAKER_07]: I was there most of the day Thursday and Friday because I had a group of friends going and I figured, eh, why not?

912
00:57:43,002 --> 00:57:44,683
[SPEAKER_10]: But you went to the Sac State one, right?

913
00:57:45,263 --> 00:57:45,583
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

914
00:57:45,643 --> 00:57:47,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki went to the Ribs, what was it, Rib Fest?

915
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:49,184
[SPEAKER_10]: The Rhythm and Ribs Fest.

916
00:57:49,244 --> 00:57:49,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Rhythm and Ribs.

917
00:57:51,485 --> 00:57:52,825
[SPEAKER_10]: I should have gone to that, I love Ribs.

918
00:57:53,025 --> 00:57:53,725
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

919
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:56,906
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have went to the one on Friday but I had to work and unfortunately I only went until 6.

920
00:57:58,087 --> 00:58:03,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately a Rib Festival doesn't work very well for someone who's trying to be more vegetarian but what have you.

921
00:58:03,894 --> 00:58:05,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway... I'm unemployed, so Friday was a great day.

922
00:58:06,116 --> 00:58:06,677
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, gotcha.

923
00:58:06,717 --> 00:58:07,838
[SPEAKER_10]: What would you call in about tonight?

924
00:58:07,858 --> 00:58:08,338
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

925
00:58:08,938 --> 00:58:17,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, so, I figured it's the first time I've gotten to listen to your show live in a few years, so I'd figure I'll take some of your advice.

926
00:58:17,266 --> 00:58:18,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been playing the Guardian Legend.

927
00:58:18,707 --> 00:58:19,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

928
00:58:20,108 --> 00:58:20,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

929
00:58:20,569 --> 00:58:21,009
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think?

930
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:26,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's a lot of fun, and I can't put my finger on it, but what in God's name am I supposed to be doing?

931
00:58:27,635 --> 00:58:28,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Wandering around...

932
00:58:29,565 --> 00:58:40,232
[SPEAKER_06]: You fight things and collect the power-ups, and then you go into the different levels, and the levels are numbered by, like, 1, 21, 2, you know, they back and forth.

933
00:58:40,252 --> 00:58:40,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's 1, 11.

934
00:58:41,633 --> 00:58:43,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, 1, 11, and your last two levels are 10 and 20.

935
00:58:44,535 --> 00:58:45,596
[SPEAKER_06]: And they are fucking hard.

936
00:58:47,237 --> 00:58:54,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing, is that you walk around the Zelda-ish world looking for where the corridors are, and the first few corridors are easy to open up.

937
00:58:54,904 --> 00:58:56,726
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

938
00:59:10,544 --> 00:59:12,725
[SPEAKER_10]: and they'd give you tips on how to open up the corridors.

939
00:59:13,025 --> 00:59:25,811
[SPEAKER_10]: When you beat the corridors, like 1 through 10, they give you a key, like you'll get a little moon key or you get a little square key or a diamond key and that will allow you to progress to another section of the Zelda world where there are more corridors waiting for you.

940
00:59:26,491 --> 00:59:27,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that makes way more sense.

941
00:59:27,612 --> 00:59:30,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought I was supposed to go to like level moon or level plus sign or something.

942
00:59:31,273 --> 00:59:35,235
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, you find those moons and plus signs in the corridors when you beat them.

943
00:59:36,212 --> 00:59:37,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're different keys.

944
00:59:37,753 --> 00:59:41,114
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the corridors 11 through 20 just give you weapon upgrades and stuff, right?

945
00:59:41,474 --> 00:59:41,834
[SPEAKER_10]: I think so.

946
00:59:41,874 --> 00:59:42,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

947
00:59:42,254 --> 00:59:44,195
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think you get too much other stuff special.

948
00:59:44,515 --> 00:59:47,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you still have to beat every level to progress through it.

949
00:59:47,856 --> 00:59:55,539
[SPEAKER_06]: But the weapons that you get, the one weapon that's going to be your best friend, especially in the last level, is the multi-directional ball.

950
00:59:56,119 --> 00:59:59,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you can shoot it up, down, left, right, and diagonals.

951
01:00:00,609 --> 01:00:04,332
[SPEAKER_06]: and the way you beat the last boss is so freaking easy, but everything else is really hard.

952
01:00:04,352 --> 01:00:06,573
[SPEAKER_10]: It isn't way better than GameFAQs.

953
01:00:07,073 --> 01:00:08,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

954
01:00:08,134 --> 01:00:11,556
[SPEAKER_06]: But TGL mode, you want to try TGL mode at least once.

955
01:00:12,496 --> 01:00:15,898
[SPEAKER_06]: You go into your password and just put in in all caps TGL.

956
01:00:17,139 --> 01:00:17,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

957
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,221
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just all the shooting stages back to back.

958
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:26,125
[SPEAKER_06]: And it gives you your power-ups, however there are ways to get around and get earlier power-ups and other things playing in RPG mode.

959
01:00:26,685 --> 01:00:28,426
[SPEAKER_06]: But TGL mode is definitely for the win.

960
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:30,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Crazy talk.

961
01:01:00,202 --> 01:01:00,502
[SPEAKER_10]: They are.

962
01:01:00,662 --> 01:01:02,242
[SPEAKER_10]: So where the hell is Lolo in these games?

963
01:01:02,862 --> 01:01:05,243
[SPEAKER_07]: He probably died because, like, everything kills you in that game.

964
01:01:05,823 --> 01:01:06,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

965
01:01:08,183 --> 01:01:09,844
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a button that killed you in that game.

966
01:01:10,464 --> 01:01:13,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Escapist said Lolo moonlighted in the first Kirby game then disappeared.

967
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:15,965
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.

968
01:01:16,025 --> 01:01:21,246
[SPEAKER_10]: He probably hit the select button or whatever the seppuku button was in Lolo.

969
01:01:21,606 --> 01:01:22,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are some tough games.

970
01:01:22,326 --> 01:01:23,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Lolo's seppuku button.

971
01:01:23,866 --> 01:01:24,186
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

972
01:01:24,206 --> 01:01:25,806
[SPEAKER_10]: There was Lolo Lo and La La La.

973
01:01:26,026 --> 01:01:27,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember his girlfriend La La La?

974
01:01:27,527 --> 01:01:29,527
[SPEAKER_10]: She was the girl because she had a bow in her hair and she was pink.

975
01:01:30,558 --> 01:01:31,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's the connection.

976
01:01:31,739 --> 01:01:32,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Kirby had King Dedede.

977
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:37,542
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you take a syllable and just repeat it a bunch of times.

978
01:01:37,682 --> 01:01:40,284
[SPEAKER_10]: We need a new enemy in this next HAL game.

979
01:01:40,344 --> 01:01:43,706
[SPEAKER_10]: How about King Nanana or King Boo Boo Boo?

980
01:01:45,908 --> 01:01:48,149
[SPEAKER_10]: They let their babies name them, actually, is what they do.

981
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:52,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Learn your first Japanese character and just write it a bunch of times.

982
01:01:52,131 --> 01:01:52,592
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

983
01:01:52,612 --> 01:01:55,253
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Warrior Bob, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

984
01:01:56,934 --> 01:01:59,476
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I've got an NES plugged in now, so what should I play?

985
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:00,480
[SPEAKER_07]: See you next time.

986
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:00,720
[SPEAKER_07]: See ya.

987
01:02:28,752 --> 01:02:30,313
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope Warrior Bob comes back to visit sometime.

988
01:02:30,353 --> 01:02:31,353
[SPEAKER_10]: It was fun having him on the show.

989
01:02:32,113 --> 01:02:33,754
[SPEAKER_10]: And lots of folks in the chat room are chiming in.

990
01:02:33,814 --> 01:02:38,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Tecmo Bowl, Ninja Gaiden, Clue Clue Land, Archon.

991
01:02:38,896 --> 01:02:40,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, that's a good suggestion, Archon.

992
01:02:40,777 --> 01:02:41,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Clue Clue Land.

993
01:02:41,617 --> 01:02:43,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, I played so much of that stupid game.

994
01:02:44,818 --> 01:02:45,858
[SPEAKER_10]: I did an Animal Crossing.

995
01:02:45,878 --> 01:02:46,479
[SPEAKER_10]: We have another call.

996
01:02:46,519 --> 01:02:47,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

997
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:47,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

998
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:50,160
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Mr. DeBucket.

999
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, Mr. DeBucket.

1000
01:02:51,641 --> 01:02:52,181
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

1001
01:02:52,881 --> 01:02:55,142
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to yell at me for kicking him over the Dreamcast.

1002
01:02:55,874 --> 01:02:57,295
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not going to yell at you for that.

1003
01:02:57,575 --> 01:02:58,696
[SPEAKER_00]: That's understandable.

1004
01:02:58,756 --> 01:03:01,298
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how Dreamcast fans are really defensive.

1005
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:02,599
[SPEAKER_10]: This is true.

1006
01:03:02,899 --> 01:03:03,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's on your mind then?

1007
01:03:04,761 --> 01:03:07,163
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Metal Gear Solid 4, Metal Gear Solid Online.

1008
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:11,246
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to know what you guys thought of them making the game separate from the multiplayer.

1009
01:03:13,067 --> 01:03:14,368
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I don't... Here's the thing.

1010
01:03:14,388 --> 01:03:14,968
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to be honest.

1011
01:03:15,088 --> 01:03:21,593
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't follow the Metal Gear series too much, but I'm kind of welcoming the idea of an online version.

1012
01:03:21,633 --> 01:03:22,774
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that might be a lot of fun.

1013
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:23,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of like this...

1014
01:03:25,857 --> 01:03:26,838
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1015
01:03:46,809 --> 01:03:47,429
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you finish it?

1016
01:03:47,489 --> 01:03:52,351
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I got was I found a dude tied up by some, you know, in the middle of the jungle.

1017
01:03:52,391 --> 01:03:53,071
[SPEAKER_00]: I untied him.

1018
01:03:53,351 --> 01:03:54,071
[SPEAKER_00]: He runs off.

1019
01:03:54,191 --> 01:03:54,611
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave.

1020
01:03:54,671 --> 01:03:57,412
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's just all darkness and fireworks going off.

1021
01:03:57,892 --> 01:03:59,473
[SPEAKER_10]: I seriously don't remember.

1022
01:03:59,513 --> 01:04:00,633
[SPEAKER_10]: When I rented it, I was like 11.

1023
01:04:00,773 --> 01:04:04,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, every time I went to a new screen, it was all dark.

1024
01:04:04,494 --> 01:04:06,955
[SPEAKER_00]: Then fireworks went off and everything was lit up for some reason.

1025
01:04:07,075 --> 01:04:10,516
[SPEAKER_00]: And helicopters couldn't see you even though you're standing right next to them.

1026
01:04:10,856 --> 01:04:11,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how do you feel about it?

1027
01:04:11,916 --> 01:04:13,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you must have called this because you had an opinion on it.

1028
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:16,121
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's an interesting idea.

1029
01:04:16,161 --> 01:04:24,686
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you don't like Metal Gear that much, if you really can't get into the single player, the multiplayer aspect, since it's a second game, I'm pretty sure you will be able to buy it separate.

1030
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:26,288
[SPEAKER_00]: You could like that better.

1031
01:04:26,448 --> 01:04:28,229
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, they changed the controls.

1032
01:04:28,669 --> 01:04:35,033
[SPEAKER_00]: They make them more like Western games or things that a lot of online gamers would get into.

1033
01:04:35,073 --> 01:04:42,718
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, now you use R1 to shoot and stuff, kind of like most games do, using the right trigger, the fire, and use L to aim.

1034
01:04:43,585 --> 01:05:08,048
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and the Sons of Patriot system, which is a new thing you can do, because normally in a multiplayer game, you know, you can always, like, see your buddies and tell if they died or something like that, or, you know, say, like, this person's name got shot, or, but you can actually see everything that they're doing by, like, at the beginning, every time you begin a match, you all, like, link up, and you can see everybody's stats, and what weapon they have, and what they're exactly doing, so you can go help them out or something, and

1035
01:05:08,661 --> 01:05:17,008
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really cool system, and it's a completely different game, and they're selling it different, but if you do buy Metal Gear Solid 4, you will get a starter pack or something.

1036
01:05:17,188 --> 01:05:18,029
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I heard about that.

1037
01:05:18,969 --> 01:05:22,112
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and apparently they're going to be making more downloadable content over...

1038
01:05:23,108 --> 01:05:24,708
[SPEAKER_00]: The next year's if people still play it.

1039
01:05:25,029 --> 01:05:25,749
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cool.

1040
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:28,829
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think what you said is kind of right where I feel.

1041
01:05:28,849 --> 01:05:31,890
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not so excited about Metal Gear Solid 4, but I hear about this online one.

1042
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:32,570
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, oh, really?

1043
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:34,291
[SPEAKER_10]: That looks like it could be fun.

1044
01:05:34,991 --> 01:05:40,192
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really follow the story, but just throwing me in the arena and shoot them up looks like a lot of fun.

1045
01:05:40,512 --> 01:05:42,813
[SPEAKER_10]: So I definitely will check it out, if nothing else.

1046
01:05:43,253 --> 01:05:44,913
[SPEAKER_10]: I may not get so into it, but we'll see.

1047
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:46,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1048
01:05:46,914 --> 01:05:47,194
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1049
01:05:47,214 --> 01:05:48,634
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners today?

1050
01:05:49,625 --> 01:05:50,125
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.

1051
01:05:50,285 --> 01:05:51,066
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

1052
01:05:51,106 --> 01:05:52,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good one, buddy.

1053
01:05:52,507 --> 01:05:52,607
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

1054
01:05:52,627 --> 01:05:52,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.

1055
01:06:11,751 --> 01:06:15,212
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I think that we should play this, though, in the afterbirth.

1056
01:06:15,392 --> 01:06:15,712
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

1057
01:06:15,732 --> 01:06:17,113
[SPEAKER_06]: If we can find the video of it.

1058
01:06:17,193 --> 01:06:17,513
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll try.

1059
01:06:17,613 --> 01:06:20,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Of the PlayStation 2 vs. Dreamcast with special guest the VMU.

1060
01:06:22,735 --> 01:06:24,775
[SPEAKER_06]: With them arguing over who was better.

1061
01:06:24,815 --> 01:06:25,135
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll try.

1062
01:06:25,215 --> 01:06:25,735
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll find it.

1063
01:06:25,876 --> 01:06:26,716
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I picked up a call.

1064
01:06:26,736 --> 01:06:27,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to the phones.

1065
01:06:27,456 --> 01:06:28,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Zone Radio.

1066
01:06:28,296 --> 01:06:28,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1067
01:06:29,417 --> 01:06:30,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Legend of Zaku.

1068
01:06:30,917 --> 01:06:31,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, Legend of Zaku.

1069
01:06:31,917 --> 01:06:32,378
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

1070
01:06:33,458 --> 01:06:37,119
[SPEAKER_12]: Nah, just chilling, just getting ready for Digital Life, which is at the end of the week.

1071
01:06:37,532 --> 01:06:38,692
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, I'm not coming.

1072
01:06:38,733 --> 01:06:40,773
[SPEAKER_10]: I was looking forward to it, but something else came up.

1073
01:06:40,793 --> 01:06:41,354
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been knowing that.

1074
01:06:41,434 --> 01:06:42,054
[SPEAKER_12]: It's alright, though.

1075
01:06:42,914 --> 01:06:48,416
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, just the general stuff within the community.

1076
01:06:48,996 --> 01:06:52,258
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, stuff like Metal Gear Solid 4.

1077
01:06:53,618 --> 01:06:54,819
[SPEAKER_10]: What the hell are you typing?

1078
01:06:54,939 --> 01:06:56,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, are you typing to somebody else?

1079
01:06:56,839 --> 01:06:57,360
[SPEAKER_10]: It's our turn.

1080
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:58,040
[SPEAKER_10]: You talk to us.

1081
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:00,001
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I mean Final Fantasy.

1082
01:07:00,161 --> 01:07:01,641
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you know, all the Halo stuff.

1083
01:07:02,482 --> 01:07:03,302
[SPEAKER_12]: All the reviews.

1084
01:07:04,192 --> 01:07:10,777
[SPEAKER_12]: All the Halo 3 reviews coming back almost at 100 or something.

1085
01:07:10,817 --> 01:07:16,821
[SPEAKER_12]: The general internet says stuff like OMG, they probably got paid off by Microsoft.

1086
01:07:17,542 --> 01:07:18,703
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, that sort of thing.

1087
01:07:19,403 --> 01:07:23,886
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not really buying into that much hype.

1088
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:26,108
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you most looking forward to about digital life?

1089
01:07:27,524 --> 01:07:30,385
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, just the, you know, just the DDR tournament.

1090
01:07:30,425 --> 01:07:31,886
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm competing in freestyle on Saturday.

1091
01:07:31,906 --> 01:07:33,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, any hints about your routine?

1092
01:07:33,927 --> 01:07:35,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, not yet.

1093
01:07:36,348 --> 01:07:48,053
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, when you see it up on YouTube, hopefully at that, you know, at that night, you know, the night of the tour, I mean, the night, the day, you know, after the tournament, then you'll see something.

1094
01:07:48,113 --> 01:07:50,414
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, I'm trying to keep it under wraps.

1095
01:07:50,754 --> 01:07:53,415
[SPEAKER_10]: I will be looking for you on the YouTube-age.

1096
01:07:54,903 --> 01:07:56,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that too.

1097
01:07:56,324 --> 01:07:59,286
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, why else do people DDR freestyle anymore?

1098
01:07:59,326 --> 01:08:02,248
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's all about being on YouTube and everybody able to watch your routine.

1099
01:08:03,089 --> 01:08:11,035
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, yeah, I mean, freestyle is kind of like a dying art right now because most tournaments don't even have that except for a few exceptions.

1100
01:08:11,316 --> 01:08:18,441
[SPEAKER_10]: If they have that whole SingStar thing on the PlayStation 3 where you're going to be able to upload your videos like a karaoke thing, why don't they do that with DDR?

1101
01:08:18,541 --> 01:08:19,162
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I don't get.

1102
01:08:19,542 --> 01:08:20,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Microsoft doesn't care.

1103
01:08:21,343 --> 01:08:22,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Konami doesn't care.

1104
01:08:22,662 --> 01:08:26,284
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't most DDR mixes have some sort of camera support?

1105
01:08:26,324 --> 01:08:28,525
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, you know, the PS2 ones had iToy.

1106
01:08:28,625 --> 01:08:29,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1107
01:08:29,045 --> 01:08:30,305
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know about 360.

1108
01:08:30,425 --> 01:08:32,646
[SPEAKER_10]: So how about just a website you can upload all that to?

1109
01:08:32,766 --> 01:08:34,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on, it's untapped resource.

1110
01:08:34,107 --> 01:08:35,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Konami, I'm giving you free hints here.

1111
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:40,230
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think Konami's ready to, you know, to drop that much bandwidth on that.

1112
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:43,771
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they're taking DDR that far, but, you know, that's about it.

1113
01:08:44,231 --> 01:08:44,512
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1114
01:08:44,992 --> 01:08:47,613
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, what else is on your mind tonight, buddy?

1115
01:08:47,653 --> 01:08:52,295
[SPEAKER_12]: Just really go over the whole, you know, the whole Rumble, Sony actually getting it

1116
01:08:52,967 --> 01:08:59,969
[SPEAKER_12]: and supposedly taking their quote-unquote last-gen feature and just polishing it up as if it were new.

1117
01:09:01,330 --> 01:09:02,690
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically polishing a turd.

1118
01:09:03,451 --> 01:09:04,171
[SPEAKER_12]: We all know better.

1119
01:09:05,811 --> 01:09:06,111
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1120
01:09:06,131 --> 01:09:08,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Sakura, I've got to let you go to get more calls, but have a good one.

1121
01:09:08,392 --> 01:09:10,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Have fun in digital life and tell everybody we said hi.

1122
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:13,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell Don I said hi, and I'm sorry I didn't make it.

1123
01:09:14,514 --> 01:09:16,255
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I will.

1124
01:09:16,395 --> 01:09:16,675
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1125
01:09:16,795 --> 01:09:17,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Later, buddy.

1126
01:09:18,876 --> 01:09:21,217
[SPEAKER_10]: See, I'm having people relay my personal messages now.

1127
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:22,037
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1128
01:09:22,257 --> 01:09:22,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

1129
01:09:22,884 --> 01:09:23,104
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1130
01:09:23,384 --> 01:09:24,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I sent you that thing.

1131
01:09:24,525 --> 01:09:24,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1132
01:09:25,506 --> 01:09:27,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want me to play it now or do you want me to play it in the after?

1133
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:28,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Right before.

1134
01:09:29,209 --> 01:09:29,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now?

1135
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:30,410
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not now.

1136
01:09:30,431 --> 01:09:31,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Right before the very end.

1137
01:09:31,591 --> 01:09:32,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1138
01:09:32,853 --> 01:09:33,233
[SPEAKER_10]: You got it.

1139
01:09:34,065 --> 01:09:35,446
[SPEAKER_10]: A little treat for our live listeners.

1140
01:09:36,306 --> 01:09:37,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we going to get any more calls?

1141
01:09:37,366 --> 01:09:37,646
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1142
01:09:37,686 --> 01:09:39,447
[SPEAKER_10]: How about some more last-minute stories while we wait for more calls?

1143
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:42,729
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username OrangeLawsRadio on Skype.

1144
01:09:42,949 --> 01:09:43,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, anything else?

1145
01:09:43,689 --> 01:09:52,512
[SPEAKER_09]: If you like Owen Dunn or Elite Beat Agents, you'll be happy to know that OSU, the sim for those games, has been released onto the PC.

1146
01:09:53,053 --> 01:09:56,974
[SPEAKER_09]: It is available to download and is actually pretty interesting.

1147
01:09:57,454 --> 01:10:00,536
[SPEAKER_09]: You can find it at osu.ppy.sh.

1148
01:10:01,056 --> 01:10:02,597
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in one of their forum posts there.

1149
01:10:04,392 --> 01:10:09,234
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like playing Owen Dunn, but just with your mouse, which must be insanely difficult.

1150
01:10:09,274 --> 01:10:09,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

1151
01:10:09,534 --> 01:10:10,215
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll talk about that in a minute.

1152
01:10:10,235 --> 01:10:10,855
[SPEAKER_10]: We got another call.

1153
01:10:10,895 --> 01:10:11,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1154
01:10:11,856 --> 01:10:12,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1155
01:10:13,336 --> 01:10:14,117
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Misty.

1156
01:10:14,537 --> 01:10:15,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Misty.

1157
01:10:15,357 --> 01:10:16,758
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you, Misty?

1158
01:10:18,459 --> 01:10:19,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Up for once.

1159
01:10:19,839 --> 01:10:20,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, I know.

1160
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:24,001
[SPEAKER_10]: We never hear from you live on the show, but I'm so happy you were able to call in.

1161
01:10:24,361 --> 01:10:25,882
[SPEAKER_10]: OMG, a girl, everybody.

1162
01:10:26,302 --> 01:10:26,843
[SPEAKER_10]: OMG.

1163
01:10:28,263 --> 01:10:28,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Dot, dot, dot.

1164
01:10:29,784 --> 01:10:30,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, but you're always here.

1165
01:10:31,385 --> 01:10:31,585
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1166
01:10:32,617 --> 01:10:34,158
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think of Cooking Momma?

1167
01:11:04,457 --> 01:11:05,237
[SPEAKER_01]: It is addictive.

1168
01:11:05,778 --> 01:11:06,618
[SPEAKER_10]: This is very addictive.

1169
01:11:06,818 --> 01:11:09,139
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of foods have you been preparing in Cooking Mama lately?

1170
01:11:11,801 --> 01:11:14,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much so far, the stuff that has retained its Japanese names.

1171
01:11:15,482 --> 01:11:15,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1172
01:11:16,303 --> 01:11:16,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool.

1173
01:11:16,843 --> 01:11:17,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool.

1174
01:11:17,423 --> 01:11:20,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there anything coming out soon on the DS that you're looking forward to?

1175
01:11:22,886 --> 01:11:25,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really, because I've only been half paying attention.

1176
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:31,390
[SPEAKER_01]: But considering my birthday's coming up, I'm going to start paying more attention at Target.

1177
01:11:32,271 --> 01:11:32,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1178
01:11:32,411 --> 01:11:32,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1179
01:11:33,072 --> 01:11:34,033
[SPEAKER_10]: and seeing what else is coming out.

1180
01:11:34,073 --> 01:11:39,236
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, actually, I don't know if there's a whole lot on DS coming out soon to get excited about this year.

1181
01:11:39,396 --> 01:11:40,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Zelda Phantom Hourglass?

1182
01:11:40,677 --> 01:11:41,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, thank you.

1183
01:11:41,398 --> 01:11:42,518
[SPEAKER_10]: I knew I was forgetting something big.

1184
01:11:42,538 --> 01:11:43,239
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the week after next.

1185
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,680
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go, Zelda Phantom Hourglass.

1186
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:49,503
[SPEAKER_10]: But most of their big stuff for the holidays have already come out, like Brain Age 2 and all that, right?

1187
01:11:50,143 --> 01:11:52,105
[SPEAKER_09]: There's Final Fantasy Tactics on the DS.

1188
01:11:52,165 --> 01:11:53,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Final Fantasy 4.

1189
01:11:53,266 --> 01:11:55,387
[SPEAKER_09]: A front mission, Revenant Wings.

1190
01:11:55,927 --> 01:11:56,828
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, all right.

1191
01:11:56,968 --> 01:11:59,170
[SPEAKER_10]: So shoot me for not following the DS so much.

1192
01:11:59,290 --> 01:11:59,670
[SPEAKER_10]: My bad.

1193
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:01,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't think it's coming out this year, but...

1194
01:12:02,424 --> 01:12:05,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, folks in the chat room are giving you some advice on DS games to pick up.

1195
01:12:05,726 --> 01:12:07,887
[SPEAKER_10]: TheRobD says you need to get Clubhouse games.

1196
01:12:08,288 --> 01:12:09,969
[SPEAKER_10]: SonofDad says Planet Puzzle League.

1197
01:12:10,009 --> 01:12:10,589
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good game.

1198
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:16,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those two look like ones that I've been considering.

1199
01:12:17,133 --> 01:12:27,659
[SPEAKER_01]: And for Clubhouse, I have considered it last night, but I came and got Cookie Mama because I saw that it was only $20, and I was trying to watch my money a little bit.

1200
01:12:28,352 --> 01:12:33,055
[SPEAKER_01]: because that GameStop was only my first stop in the mall.

1201
01:12:33,075 --> 01:12:34,915
[SPEAKER_01]: I still had a good portion of the mall to go.

1202
01:12:35,196 --> 01:12:35,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1203
01:12:35,916 --> 01:12:38,577
[SPEAKER_10]: See, the good deals always went out when they're cheaper.

1204
01:12:39,057 --> 01:12:39,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Always went out.

1205
01:12:40,058 --> 01:12:42,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Misty, anything else you want to share with our listeners today?

1206
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:46,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really anything that I can think of.

1207
01:12:46,961 --> 01:12:47,222
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1208
01:12:47,242 --> 01:12:49,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Misty, thanks so much for calling in, and I'm glad to hear you got through.

1209
01:12:49,983 --> 01:12:53,365
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you've been listening to our show forever, and it's always good to listen to you live.

1210
01:12:53,425 --> 01:12:53,725
[SPEAKER_10]: All right?

1211
01:12:54,905 --> 01:12:55,306
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1212
01:12:55,486 --> 01:12:55,666
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1213
01:12:55,686 --> 01:12:56,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one.

1214
01:12:57,421 --> 01:12:57,641
[SPEAKER_10]: You too.

1215
01:12:57,681 --> 01:12:57,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye-bye.

1216
01:12:57,841 --> 01:12:58,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, no moleste.

1217
01:12:58,422 --> 01:12:59,743
[SPEAKER_10]: This is.

1218
01:12:59,763 --> 01:13:00,203
[SPEAKER_10]: How's it going?

1219
01:13:26,881 --> 01:13:38,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I went into the chat room, I was playing my puzzle quest, and I went onto the website, and so I decided to call in.

1220
01:13:38,872 --> 01:13:39,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there you have it.

1221
01:13:39,592 --> 01:13:40,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you guys were taking calls.

1222
01:13:41,554 --> 01:13:43,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you miss living where the show is recorded?

1223
01:13:45,638 --> 01:13:48,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't miss you, but I miss the show.

1224
01:13:49,121 --> 01:13:50,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss everything about the show.

1225
01:13:51,162 --> 01:13:52,824
[SPEAKER_10]: You miss Jamie and Matt, but...

1226
01:13:54,573 --> 01:13:55,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss Jamie and that.

1227
01:13:57,135 --> 01:13:58,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing about you, though.

1228
01:14:00,779 --> 01:14:04,462
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to actually come with us to get Indian food when you can eat.

1229
01:14:06,184 --> 01:14:06,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

1230
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:13,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that place is very friendly to the South Beach diet, is what I was reading.

1231
01:14:15,292 --> 01:14:16,834
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all whole wheat or unbleached.

1232
01:14:17,139 --> 01:14:18,200
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's great for vegetarians.

1233
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:18,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for the rice.

1234
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,561
[SPEAKER_10]: It's awesome for vegetarians, too.

1235
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:22,922
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually thinking about going vegetarian again.

1236
01:14:22,942 --> 01:14:23,942
[SPEAKER_10]: I just did three days ago.

1237
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:24,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you?

1238
01:14:24,843 --> 01:14:25,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1239
01:14:25,543 --> 01:14:25,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

1240
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:27,604
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I'm taking vitamins and stuff.

1241
01:14:27,624 --> 01:14:31,566
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't want to make too big a deal out of it, because last time I went vegetarian, I was not able to do it for more than a week and a half.

1242
01:14:31,606 --> 01:14:34,508
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're being a vegetarian, Rob?

1243
01:14:34,768 --> 01:14:34,988
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1244
01:14:36,314 --> 01:14:38,336
[SPEAKER_10]: I will go vegetarian with you, except I will need to eat fish.

1245
01:14:59,702 --> 01:15:02,983
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm going to eat fish, too, because protein is so hard to get.

1246
01:15:03,283 --> 01:15:04,203
[SPEAKER_06]: I get an earache.

1247
01:15:04,223 --> 01:15:05,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then you're not a true vegetarian.

1248
01:15:05,543 --> 01:15:06,563
[SPEAKER_10]: You're right, I'm not.

1249
01:15:06,643 --> 01:15:08,884
[SPEAKER_10]: So it would be more appropriate to say I don't eat meat.

1250
01:15:09,924 --> 01:15:10,404
[SPEAKER_06]: No red meat.

1251
01:15:10,424 --> 01:15:11,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you're a fishitarian.

1252
01:15:11,564 --> 01:15:12,384
[SPEAKER_06]: No red meat and no protein.

1253
01:15:12,404 --> 01:15:13,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm a fishitarian.

1254
01:15:13,864 --> 01:15:14,745
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't give up sushi.

1255
01:15:14,765 --> 01:15:15,165
[SPEAKER_10]: I just can't.

1256
01:15:15,445 --> 01:15:16,785
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, anyway, enough about that.

1257
01:15:18,085 --> 01:15:19,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Who the fuck cares about what I eat?

1258
01:15:19,665 --> 01:15:20,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Extrovert.

1259
01:15:20,346 --> 01:15:21,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody cares about what I eat.

1260
01:15:21,926 --> 01:15:24,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Extrovert, what kind of games have you been playing this week?

1261
01:15:24,646 --> 01:15:27,267
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you remember, but we talk about video games on this show once in a while.

1262
01:15:27,287 --> 01:15:28,387
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of video games have you been playing?

1263
01:15:30,763 --> 01:15:34,886
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing World of Warcraft and Puzzle Quest.

1264
01:15:35,006 --> 01:15:35,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Big surprise!

1265
01:15:36,506 --> 01:15:40,529
[SPEAKER_10]: How's World of Warcraft been treating you?

1266
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:41,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty good.

1267
01:15:41,629 --> 01:15:47,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm at the end of a grind in the game, and I don't know.

1268
01:15:48,233 --> 01:15:54,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's getting kind of boring because I've gotten a lot of stuff, and so now I'm like,

1269
01:15:55,347 --> 01:16:01,272
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you most looking forward to about Wrath of the Lich King?

1270
01:16:05,556 --> 01:16:06,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't decided yet.

1271
01:16:07,197 --> 01:16:11,881
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that just to look in the new areas and stuff like that, explore in the new areas.

1272
01:16:13,493 --> 01:16:13,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

1273
01:16:14,094 --> 01:16:36,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, when I come back to World of Warcraft, which is probably going to happen, because, oh, my gosh, I can't believe we didn't talk about it during the news, but Final Fantasy XI, okay, A, I kind of stopped playing like a couple weeks ago, but B, they announced that for the new expansion that's coming out, Wings of the Goddess is the new expansion coming out, they have announced one of the new job classes for Wings of the Goddess, Dancer.

1274
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:37,691
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can shake your booty.

1275
01:16:37,711 --> 01:16:38,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

1276
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:39,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm so excited.

1277
01:16:39,673 --> 01:16:42,715
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, Sauce says it's technically pescatarianism.

1278
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:43,959
[SPEAKER_10]: is that what it is?

1279
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:44,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Pescatarian?

1280
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:59,750
[SPEAKER_10]: will not eat the flesh of any animal other than types of seafood yes and I don't want to live off seafood but I just want that to be available because I'm not I'm doing it for health reasons not I'm not a member of PETA or anything it's just health reasons people eating tasty animals well hey what?

1281
01:16:59,871 --> 01:17:05,755
[SPEAKER_02]: if you come back to WoW then you can't you're like a you're a cooker right?

1282
01:17:05,775 --> 01:17:07,156
[SPEAKER_02]: you cook food in WoW right?

1283
01:17:07,196 --> 01:17:07,556
[SPEAKER_10]: yes yes

1284
01:17:08,655 --> 01:17:10,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so you can't make any meat anymore.

1285
01:17:10,596 --> 01:17:13,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll call you a liar.

1286
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:15,120
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a virtual game.

1287
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:15,920
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter.

1288
01:17:16,761 --> 01:17:18,502
[SPEAKER_10]: It matters.

1289
01:17:18,782 --> 01:17:19,823
[SPEAKER_02]: It matters to me.

1290
01:17:20,223 --> 01:17:23,005
[SPEAKER_10]: If you give me meat, I'm going to call you a liar.

1291
01:17:23,165 --> 01:17:27,268
[SPEAKER_10]: If I was a card-carrying member of PETA, then maybe, but I'm doing it for health reasons.

1292
01:17:27,568 --> 01:17:31,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I'll tell you what, making yourself vegetarian really makes you stop and think about everything you're eating.

1293
01:17:32,112 --> 01:17:33,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas usually, you don't.

1294
01:17:34,473 --> 01:17:35,794
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're not on some type of thing, you don't.

1295
01:17:36,174 --> 01:17:37,635
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't want to talk about food anymore.

1296
01:17:37,675 --> 01:17:38,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Jesus Christ.

1297
01:17:38,636 --> 01:17:38,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1298
01:17:40,077 --> 01:17:41,277
[SPEAKER_10]: See, now everybody in chat is yelling at me.

1299
01:17:41,297 --> 01:17:42,558
[SPEAKER_10]: I should never call myself a vegetarian.

1300
01:17:42,578 --> 01:17:44,099
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just on a lifestyle adjustment.

1301
01:17:44,419 --> 01:17:44,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Who cares?

1302
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:45,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1303
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:47,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent hanging up on you.

1304
01:17:47,321 --> 01:17:48,101
[SPEAKER_02]: You're ruining the show.

1305
01:17:48,121 --> 01:17:48,501
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a what?

1306
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:53,431
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a mushroom Swiss burger today.

1307
01:17:53,471 --> 01:17:54,092
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so good.

1308
01:17:54,112 --> 01:17:54,972
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so glad to hear it.

1309
01:17:54,992 --> 01:17:57,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Filled with meat and protein and meat.

1310
01:17:57,794 --> 01:17:59,115
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm hanging up.

1311
01:17:59,235 --> 01:18:00,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Buy extra frozen.

1312
01:18:00,216 --> 01:18:03,739
[SPEAKER_06]: But remember, you can only eat top cuts of meat.

1313
01:18:03,819 --> 01:18:09,443
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to all be lean, less than 5% fat from meat if you're doing South Beach.

1314
01:18:09,963 --> 01:18:11,724
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1315
01:18:12,005 --> 01:18:15,107
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll balloon up and you'll look like all those contestants on Biggest Loser.

1316
01:18:16,712 --> 01:18:17,613
[SPEAKER_10]: You look like Roseanne.

1317
01:18:17,633 --> 01:18:18,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, good.

1318
01:18:18,233 --> 01:18:21,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I can try out for Biggest Loser next year.

1319
01:18:21,716 --> 01:18:22,016
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1320
01:18:22,096 --> 01:18:23,157
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hanging up on you, Extifer.

1321
01:18:24,237 --> 01:18:24,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1322
01:18:24,638 --> 01:18:25,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.

1323
01:18:25,078 --> 01:18:25,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you all.

1324
01:18:25,818 --> 01:18:26,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

1325
01:18:26,679 --> 01:18:27,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

1326
01:18:28,981 --> 01:18:32,543
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm surprised Extifer didn't use the opportunity to tell us he was talking to us on his iPhone.

1327
01:18:33,524 --> 01:18:35,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Because usually he'll say, I'm on my iPhone.

1328
01:18:36,786 --> 01:18:40,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, the funny thing about Extifer, he has a whole YouTube series now.

1329
01:18:40,508 --> 01:18:42,690
[SPEAKER_10]: His live journal posts have all been YouTube clips.

1330
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:45,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Extifer, if you're still in chat, you can plug your YouTube channel there.

1331
01:18:46,678 --> 01:18:49,561
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to spell his name really funny, so I can't even remember how to get there.

1332
01:18:50,001 --> 01:18:50,381
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1333
01:18:51,402 --> 01:18:57,107
[SPEAKER_10]: And Actdeft will also be coming back to Orange Launch Radio just as soon as we can get coordinated and get our Wednesday show off the ground again.

1334
01:18:57,147 --> 01:19:00,790
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're going to do something with video this time because of Op 11 and all that fun stuff.

1335
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:01,591
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to hide.

1336
01:19:01,611 --> 01:19:03,373
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the Wednesday show.

1337
01:19:03,413 --> 01:19:03,933
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not on it.

1338
01:19:03,973 --> 01:19:06,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I should come on the Wednesday show and bring pizza.

1339
01:19:06,035 --> 01:19:06,856
[SPEAKER_10]: But then you have to be on cam.

1340
01:19:07,176 --> 01:19:07,476
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1341
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:08,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Fine.

1342
01:19:08,197 --> 01:19:09,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you have to wear a paper bag over your head the whole time.

1343
01:19:10,038 --> 01:19:11,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Faust from Guilty Gear.

1344
01:19:12,641 --> 01:19:12,921
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1345
01:19:14,196 --> 01:19:15,817
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it for the Skype line tonight, you guys.

1346
01:19:15,837 --> 01:19:18,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks so much for tuning in and participating.

1347
01:19:18,418 --> 01:19:18,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Appreciate it.

1348
01:19:19,318 --> 01:19:19,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Play it.

1349
01:19:19,738 --> 01:19:19,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

1350
01:19:19,998 --> 01:19:20,578
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not there yet.

1351
01:19:20,698 --> 01:19:21,219
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not there yet.

1352
01:19:21,819 --> 01:19:23,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Any more last-minute stories?

1353
01:19:23,319 --> 01:19:23,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1354
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:24,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1355
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,580
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been finding more as we wait.

1356
01:19:27,121 --> 01:19:39,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, some interesting stuff to kind of go back to last week's story, how we talked about Sony releasing 3.71 firmware for the PSP and PSP Slim to circumvent the...

1357
01:19:40,614 --> 01:19:47,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Team M33 has just released the custom firmware 3.71 to combat that.

1358
01:19:49,181 --> 01:19:55,546
[SPEAKER_09]: So now you have all the wonderful features of the most current firmware for the PSP, and you can also run homebrew.

1359
01:19:56,506 --> 01:19:58,348
[SPEAKER_09]: It will never work, Sony.

1360
01:19:58,448 --> 01:20:02,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Try as you may, it will never, ever work.

1361
01:20:03,792 --> 01:20:04,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways...

1362
01:20:05,067 --> 01:20:06,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Some other interesting stuff.

1363
01:20:07,027 --> 01:20:14,549
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a Chinese MMO company, Shonda Entertainment, who has a MMO called King of the World.

1364
01:20:15,009 --> 01:20:19,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, they have banned men playing women characters.

1365
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:22,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, shit.

1366
01:20:22,431 --> 01:20:24,031
[SPEAKER_10]: You know I only play women characters now.

1367
01:20:24,051 --> 01:20:27,192
[SPEAKER_09]: You will be required to prove your gender via webcam.

1368
01:20:29,472 --> 01:20:31,032
[SPEAKER_06]: What if it's a really pretty guy?

1369
01:20:31,113 --> 01:20:31,373
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1370
01:20:31,393 --> 01:20:32,333
[SPEAKER_10]: That won't be hard to fake.

1371
01:20:32,353 --> 01:20:33,273
[SPEAKER_10]: What if you're Chris Crocker?

1372
01:20:34,442 --> 01:20:36,904
[SPEAKER_09]: or just put your sister in front of the camera.

1373
01:20:37,404 --> 01:20:39,705
[SPEAKER_10]: My little six-year-old sister.

1374
01:20:39,825 --> 01:20:43,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Or what if you have a woman who has very masculine features?

1375
01:20:44,988 --> 01:20:46,048
[SPEAKER_10]: You mad.

1376
01:20:46,769 --> 01:20:47,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, what do they do with trannies?

1377
01:20:48,290 --> 01:20:48,950
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1378
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:50,331
[SPEAKER_10]: No love for the transsexuals.

1379
01:20:53,728 --> 01:20:54,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I love channies, Rob.

1380
01:20:55,429 --> 01:20:55,789
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you do.

1381
01:21:17,403 --> 01:21:22,146
[SPEAKER_09]: People are noticing that more and more EB games are slowly becoming GameStop.

1382
01:21:22,206 --> 01:21:24,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder what's going to happen to the two that are in the mall.

1383
01:21:24,527 --> 01:21:26,328
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of speculation, isn't it?

1384
01:21:26,949 --> 01:21:32,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they said just this week that two stores in Rochester have already become GameStops.

1385
01:21:33,613 --> 01:21:36,294
[SPEAKER_09]: And that they've noticed more and more since then.

1386
01:21:37,675 --> 01:21:41,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Samurai Shodown 2 is coming to Xbox Live Arcade and the Wii.

1387
01:21:41,458 --> 01:21:43,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is the best one in the series.

1388
01:21:43,739 --> 01:21:47,181
[SPEAKER_09]: It was shown at Tokyo Game Show, so people will be happy about that.

1389
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:49,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Best one ever.

1390
01:21:50,050 --> 01:21:54,051
[SPEAKER_09]: It is coming to the Japanese Xbox Live Arcade, so no one worried if it's coming to the US.

1391
01:21:54,391 --> 01:21:55,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably will be.

1392
01:21:56,431 --> 01:22:05,333
[SPEAKER_09]: And then finally, there have been some tools released for modders of the Xbox 360.

1393
01:22:06,533 --> 01:22:17,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Using, I guess, a timing attack with a mod chip that's out there right now, you can drop your firmware down to one that can be exploited

1394
01:22:18,308 --> 01:22:28,310
[SPEAKER_09]: and it will allow you to install Linux on your Xbox 360 and probably also run Homebrew and God knows probably running backups of games.

1395
01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:37,671
[SPEAKER_09]: And then real quick, this is more for in-studio unfortunately, check out this cool add-on for the Arkanoid DS game that's got the... Oh yeah, the little paddle.

1396
01:22:37,711 --> 01:22:38,131
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.

1397
01:22:38,211 --> 01:22:39,552
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw that somewhere, that was awesome.

1398
01:22:39,572 --> 01:22:40,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's pretty awesome.

1399
01:22:42,792 --> 01:22:45,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, I think, yep, that's all the stories I had.

1400
01:22:46,693 --> 01:22:47,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's about time.

1401
01:22:47,952 --> 01:22:54,601
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, now, DarkSakura, set up this YouTube-age I'm going to look at here in studio, and the folks on the stream and podcast will get the audio.

1402
01:22:55,146 --> 01:23:00,429
[SPEAKER_06]: This was back in the day when there was the big debate between the Dreamcast and the PS2.

1403
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:02,471
[SPEAKER_06]: People trying to decide what was better.

1404
01:23:02,951 --> 01:23:08,474
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is basically a Dreamcast and a VMU talking to a PlayStation 2.

1405
01:23:08,514 --> 01:23:11,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Now wait, was this an actual commercial on TV or what was this?

1406
01:23:11,196 --> 01:23:12,417
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this is just a fan video.

1407
01:23:12,497 --> 01:23:15,919
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was on some site a long time ago, but a bunch of people have re-uploaded it.

1408
01:23:16,519 --> 01:23:19,481
[SPEAKER_06]: But the PS2 was the one with the really snooty voice.

1409
01:23:20,501 --> 01:23:23,003
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Dreamcast is like the regular, you know...

1410
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:23,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, PS2!

1411
01:23:23,761 --> 01:23:23,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes?

1412
01:23:35,586 --> 01:23:37,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Me and the VMU were watching you play Ridge Racer 5.

1413
01:23:37,887 --> 01:23:39,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, really?

1414
01:23:39,128 --> 01:23:41,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and we thought it looked really good.

1415
01:23:41,669 --> 01:23:43,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, thank you.

1416
01:23:43,410 --> 01:23:44,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it looks good.

1417
01:23:44,951 --> 01:23:46,432
[SPEAKER_11]: For us to poop on.

1418
01:23:49,013 --> 01:23:54,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Mock me if you must, but keep in mind that I am powered by the 128-bit emotion engine.

1419
01:23:54,936 --> 01:23:57,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the only emotion you're giving developers is frustration.

1420
01:23:57,897 --> 01:23:58,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Ha ha ha ha!

1421
01:23:59,558 --> 01:24:01,479
[SPEAKER_11]: They better be programming on a Saturn!

1422
01:24:01,559 --> 01:24:02,920
[SPEAKER_11]: What a disappointment.

1423
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:08,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Only top-notch Japanese development studios can obtain optimum results from my hardware.

1424
01:24:08,222 --> 01:24:11,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, then how come Dead or Alive 2 looks better running on me than on you?

1425
01:24:11,583 --> 01:24:12,784
[SPEAKER_11]: What a disappointment.

1426
01:24:13,484 --> 01:24:17,006
[SPEAKER_11]: But surely you've witnessed the raw beauty that is Tekken Tag Tournament.

1427
01:24:17,426 --> 01:24:20,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, a game that looks like Tekken 3 running in enhanced mode.

1428
01:24:20,687 --> 01:24:21,688
[SPEAKER_11]: What a disappointment.

1429
01:24:21,848 --> 01:24:22,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I see.

1430
01:24:22,888 --> 01:24:33,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you actually believe your crappy lineup can compete with Japs at Radio, Grandia 2, Echo the Dolphin, Metropolis Street Racer, Furballs, NFL 2001, Eternal Arcadia, Slammity Amigo, and Sonic Adventure 2?

1431
01:24:33,352 --> 01:24:34,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah?

1432
01:24:35,393 --> 01:24:38,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, all that Namco thinks you can handle is Mr. Drew!

1433
01:24:38,514 --> 01:24:40,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, hey, hey, do you want to go?

1434
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:40,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want some of this?

1435
01:24:40,935 --> 01:24:44,416
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll spank you like a little bitch, you f***ing b***h!

1436
01:24:44,456 --> 01:24:45,536
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, come on!

1437
01:24:45,556 --> 01:24:46,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Good luck, you're okay!

1438
01:24:57,285 --> 01:25:03,909
[SPEAKER_10]: I have had enough of you!

1439
01:25:03,929 --> 01:25:05,970
[SPEAKER_10]: The internet thanks you for blowing out their speakers.

1440
01:25:05,990 --> 01:25:06,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job.

1441
01:25:06,831 --> 01:25:07,991
[SPEAKER_10]: What a disappointment.

1442
01:25:09,732 --> 01:25:10,353
[SPEAKER_06]: That was great.

1443
01:25:10,433 --> 01:25:13,134
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that little video.

1444
01:25:13,435 --> 01:25:15,876
[SPEAKER_10]: That was from user Kohan69 on YouTube.

1445
01:25:15,936 --> 01:25:17,997
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to post it in the chat room again.

1446
01:25:18,518 --> 01:25:19,178
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny.

1447
01:25:21,158 --> 01:25:21,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1448
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:24,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, well, on that note, God, this has been a long show tonight.

1449
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:25,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Both segments over an hour and a half.

1450
01:25:26,021 --> 01:25:27,002
[SPEAKER_10]: That's because we're awesome.

1451
01:25:27,022 --> 01:25:28,483
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's time to wrap this shit up.

1452
01:25:29,123 --> 01:25:31,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like that PlayStation 2 got, we need to put a bullet in this show.

1453
01:25:31,965 --> 01:25:32,406
[SPEAKER_10]: It's done.

1454
01:25:32,806 --> 01:25:35,648
[SPEAKER_10]: So that means we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.

1455
01:25:36,368 --> 01:25:37,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, your final thought.

1456
01:25:38,407 --> 01:25:42,711
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is... I was just reading this last article here.

1457
01:25:42,731 --> 01:25:52,799
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some 12-year-old, I guess, a 6th grader that received $6.5 million for an in-game commerce network they designed.

1458
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:54,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Bastard.

1459
01:25:55,721 --> 01:25:56,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1460
01:25:56,462 --> 01:25:57,122
[SPEAKER_09]: I want $6.5 million.

1461
01:25:58,003 --> 01:26:02,346
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is... I want a cookie.

1462
01:26:03,187 --> 01:26:04,228
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

1463
01:26:04,448 --> 01:26:05,269
[SPEAKER_01]: Dreamcast!

1464
01:26:06,624 --> 01:26:12,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you everybody for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting and independent radio and supporting Orange Launch Radio.

1465
01:26:12,706 --> 01:26:13,367
[SPEAKER_10]: We really appreciate it.

1466
01:26:13,407 --> 01:26:15,367
[SPEAKER_10]: If you like our show, we give it to you for free.

1467
01:26:15,567 --> 01:26:19,889
