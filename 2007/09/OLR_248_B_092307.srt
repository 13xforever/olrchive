Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,900
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, September the 23rd of 2007.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,300
I know we don't talk about the weather a lot on this program because we're a video game podcast after all,

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,900
but I have to say here locally, where we're based out of Sacramento, California,

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:38,000
it's been nice to actually see some signs of fall recently as opposed to still the temperatures above 100 degrees.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,100
So it actually rained this weekend. Perfect day to stay indoors and play video games, which is what I did.

10
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,800
I played Eternal Sonata like all day yesterday.

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,400
I love the rain.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,800
Rain's nice, but you know...

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,400
I opened all the windows in the house while I was home.

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,600
Yeah, I don't necessarily want to go out and play in it, but I have the view.

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,900
I can look in the backyard and watch the rain fall, so...

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,200
Rain is great.

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,000
Rain's okay. It's overrated sometimes.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,700
If I wanted to see rain all the time, I'd live in Seattle or something.

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,300
Live in Alabama for a while.

20
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,600
Do they get a lot of rain there too?

21
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,400
Oh, hell yeah.

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,000
All right.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,700
Second highest precipitation in the country.

24
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,800
It's a subtropical climate.

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,600
All right. Less weather, more games.

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:22,400
Yes. One interesting thing to happen this week is that Intel has actually bought the physics engine Havok

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,000
and is now going to be incorporating it into their product.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,200
Interesting enough, the Havok engine has been in quite a few games,

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,600
including Bioshock, Stranglehold, Halo 2, Half-Life 2, Oblivion, and Crackdown,

30
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,900
and they've bought the company for $21 million.

31
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,600
So...

32
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,200
It's pretty cool.

33
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,800
I could sell them my cat for $21 million.

34
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,400
So maybe we'll see some more Havok stuff built into the new Intel chips,

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,900
which would be good because, you know, physics are awesome.

36
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,300
That's the new wave now.

37
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,200
Take it from Loki.

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,300
Physics are awesome.

39
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:57,800
In games.

40
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,000
Wouldn't it be physics is?

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,600
Real physics suck.

42
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,000
Intelligence are awesome.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,700
Intelligence are awesome.

44
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,600
That's right.

45
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,000
Get this, and you have to be really intelligent to do something like this.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,500
A World of Warcraft character has been sold for 7,000 euros.

47
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,200
That would be about $9,700 US.

48
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,900
The reason why it sold for so damn much money,

49
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,900
apparently it had four out of five pieces of a tier six armor set.

50
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,000
Obviously the damn thing was level sevenary.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It had legendary swords that were dropped by Illidan Stormrage.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,300
So basically it was about as high of a character as you can get.

53
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,400
And there you have it.

54
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,300
This character sold for $10,000.

55
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,800
Granted, I don't know where this sold, but I'm assuming it was on eBay or something.

56
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
It sold for...

57
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,800
The price was in euros, so it had to be in Europe.

58
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Well, yeah, but was it like eBay Europe or what?

59
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,400
I'm not sure.

60
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,400
If I were rich, I would buy him and delete him.

61
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
That would piss everyone off.

62
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,900
Well, I thought it was funny they were mentioning in there that the person that bought it,

63
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,400
his regular account was banned.

64
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Oh, so that's why they bought it.

65
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
That makes sense.

66
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,400
But apparently it had been banned for some time.

67
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Yeah, that totally makes sense to spend $10,000 on a character.

68
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Never mind.

69
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,900
Well, okay, in somebody's mind though,

70
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,900
dude, what if they had a lot of friends on there or something?

71
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,400
Dude, if I had that much money,

72
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,400
well, you know, I would do actually constructive things with it.

73
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
Probably someone like Ashlee Simpson or something like that.

74
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
I'm totally hardcore, yo!

75
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400
Look at all the stuff I earned!

76
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,400
All the stuff. I'm super awesome.

77
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
And of course, the chat, our chat room,

78
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,400
chat, thatorangehonestradio.com is asking about

79
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
four strength, four stamped leather belts.

80
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
You know what? Shut up.

81
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,400
I'm only going to tell you this once, chat. Shut up.

82
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
It's an inside joke. Forget it.

83
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Yeah, but World of Warcraft doesn't have a goat helmet.

84
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Like, like, Ragnarok does.

85
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
You know what else World of Warcraft

86
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
doesn't have that Ragnarok does have that's pretty awesome?

87
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
Awesome.

88
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
The bow that you can wear in your hair.

89
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
You know, the bow is great.

90
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
You can get a giant bow, Rob.

91
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
I used to have a SARS mask and a bow. It's awesome.

92
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
I gave you your bow.

93
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Anyway.

94
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,400
It used to be my cell phone.

95
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,400
I will think about playing Ragnarok on your server,

96
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
but after I beat Eternal Sonata.

97
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
I could give you panties.

98
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,400
Please don't ever tell me that again.

99
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
No, in one of the dungeons,

100
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,400
it's like because the drop rate is so high,

101
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,400
you leave with like 500 pairs of panties.

102
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Only on this program.

103
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,400
It's Ragnarok.

104
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Women throwing their panties at me.

105
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
Anyway.

106
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Next story, please.

107
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Panty lover.

108
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
Don't wanna. I quit.

109
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Do not want.

110
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
No.

111
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,400
New downloadable content for Guitar Hero 2

112
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,400
will have some pretty, pretty cool stuff.

113
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
Trivium's a detonation.

114
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Atreyu a right side of the bed and protest the heroes bury the hatchet.

115
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,400
I just think it's rad there's a band called Atreyu.

116
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
We did.

117
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
That was the dude in Never Ending Story.

118
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
I know.

119
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Their cover of You Give Love a Bad Name.

120
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,400
It's like the verse parts are awful,

121
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
because he's also just doing nothing but screaming,

122
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,400
but like the chorus parts are great.

123
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,400
So that's like the worst and best cover ever.

124
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,400
The cover does in fact give love a bad name, actually.

125
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
It gives everything a bad name.

126
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,400
Phil Do in our chat room says Atreyu sucks.

127
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,400
They suck.

128
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
But they have a rad name.

129
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,400
I mean they might totally suck, but they have a rad name.

130
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
You can't deny that.

131
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Well it's even worse though if you have a crappy band with a cool name.

132
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,400
It's like why didn't you pick a crappy name?

133
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Dammit, now like a cool band can't have your name.

134
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Loser.

135
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,400
What was that quote in Wayne's World, one of my favorite movies of all time?

136
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,400
Who else is playing tonight?

137
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
The shitty Beatles.

138
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
The shitty Beatles?

139
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Yeah, they suck.

140
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
Oh, that's not just a clever name.

141
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Yeah, that was great.

142
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,400
I'm sure I butchered that quote, but I could almost quote that entire movie.

143
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,400
That's how much I love Wayne's World.

144
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Anyway.

145
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,400
Back to games, please help save the show.

146
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Anyways.

147
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,400
So, you know, if you're not into downloading songs off of Xbox Live, well maybe you just

148
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:19,400
want to buy the soundtrack to Guitar Hero 3 and put that in your system and unlock some

149
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,400
more songs that way.

150
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:27,400
Apparently actually there will be a code to download some songs off of Xbox Live to be

151
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,400
added into Guitar Hero 3.

152
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Okay, three tracks that you want to unlock include, let's see here.

153
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:45,400
A track by AFI, Carcigen Crush looks like Tina by Flyleaf and a remix of Marilyn Manson's

154
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:52,400
Putting Holes in Happiness by Nick Zinner of the Ya Ya Yas.

155
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,400
So, how much you want to bet?

156
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Just, you know, how much you want to bet that these songs are already in the game and you're

157
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
just having to buy the soundtrack?

158
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Well, you're just unlocking them on the disc already.

159
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
And that pisses people off.

160
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,400
I notice that pisses a lot of Xbox people off when they download these things and they

161
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,400
find that they're just keys to unlock shit that was already on the disc.

162
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
But here's the thing, though, about this.

163
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,400
It wasn't really clear to me whether this is just for the 360 or what.

164
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
I mean, this is coming from Billboard.

165
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,400
They were saying that this is going to be a code or whatever, but they may misinterpret

166
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,400
it to actually being a physical code that you punch into the game.

167
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Because obviously this game is coming out on almost all the platforms, so it wouldn't

168
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,400
be surprising if it's just a little key code that you put in.

169
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Kind of like all that exclusive GameStop content you get.

170
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,400
It's just a code that ends up leaking out on the internet later on anyways.

171
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,400
Well this kind of news makes me angsty, but it's not time for that segment yet.

172
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Well instead I have to do some news that makes me happy.

173
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
You know I love me some GameTap.

174
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
I've talked about the service here and I think it's a great service.

175
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,400
GameTap is getting a much beloved game here of the OLR staff.

176
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
I totally need GameTap now.

177
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Typing of the Dead is coming to GameTap in October.

178
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
That's awesome!

179
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,400
October 11th they'll be getting a Typing of the Dead there on GameTap.

180
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
And I'm assuming that must be the Dreamcast one.

181
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
I have that on Dreamcast.

182
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Because GameTap emulates Dreamcast software.

183
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
So I'm assuming that's what it is.

184
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
That's awesome.

185
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
I have that on Dreamcast.

186
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
It's so much fun.

187
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Oh my god it's so much fun.

188
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,400
When I used to hang out with Iguana Girl.

189
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:37,400
We used to just go over and do nothing but play Typing of the Dead for hours.

190
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
I'm not even joking.

191
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
What was the version of it they had at Arcade Infinity for a while?

192
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
It was the Japanese one.

193
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Yeah the Japanese one.

194
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,400
But you couldn't beat one of the bosses because it asks you trivia questions.

195
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
And you can't beat it.

196
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
Because it's in Japanese.

197
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Yeah unless you can speak it.

198
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
But man playing the Japanese one was hard.

199
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,400
Because you wouldn't know the words.

200
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:59,400
Well I think that it had like an English Typing mode.

201
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
And then it had the Kana mode.

202
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,400
And I used to actually have the Kana memorized.

203
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
But it's been a long time.

204
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Oh no I played the one that was normal.

205
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Like Romaji letters.

206
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
You know you just play.

207
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
It's easy.

208
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
But then when you got to the boss that asked you trivia questions.

209
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,400
You couldn't beat him.

210
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Unless you spoke Japanese.

211
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Of which I don't.

212
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,400
And if you've ever listened to me cover Japanese release dates.

213
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
And you already know this.

214
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,400
Anyhow let's open up the old mailbag.

215
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Every week you guys send us emails.

216
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Mailbag at Orangelandsradio.com.

217
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
And we read them here live on air.

218
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Dark Sakura will answer your questions.

219
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Or she'll taunt you and make fun of your grammar and punctuation.

220
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Mailbag at Orangelandsradio.com is the place to do it.

221
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
Dark Sakura open up the mailbag.

222
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
Dive on in.

223
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
What do we got?

224
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,400
The first one comes from Spamouflage.

225
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
That's a great name.

226
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Guys you make my Monday morning at work fun.

227
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
Thanks for the podcast.

228
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Why is Uncharted referred to as Tomb Raider with a guy and unoriginal.

229
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Where as every single WW2 slash army type slash alien space type first person shooter.

230
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Isn't criticized for lack of originality.

231
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Lastly I've noticed a trend on your show.

232
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
1.

233
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,400
Loki makes an Xbox 360 announcement and follows it with a neutral or positive comment.

234
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
2.

235
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Loki makes a PS3 announcement followed by a sarcastic or negative comment.

236
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Don't believe me?

237
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
3.

238
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,400
Loki asks the ever so lovely Dark Sakura to ring a bell every time you say something negative

239
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
about the PS3 and see how many times you catch yourself.

240
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Enough.

241
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Why the hate?

242
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Come on.

243
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,400
Thanks.

244
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
4.

245
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
P.S.

246
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
No idea how to spell Loki so make fun of me.

247
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
I deserve it.

248
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
It's L.O.K.I.

249
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Not with two E's.

250
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
That looks very girly.

251
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Loki!

252
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,400
That's like a MySpace name.

253
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Seriously.

254
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Put a T in there you have lockette.

255
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Should we do that next week?

256
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
A bell?

257
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
Let's do it.

258
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Let's keep a little tally thing.

259
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
A little tally?

260
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
Alright.

261
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,400
Next week we'll get Dark Sakura a bell and every time Loki makes a negative comment about

262
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
the PS3 we'll ring it.

263
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Well maybe they should stop making it so damn easy.

264
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Seriously.

265
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
I mean.

266
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
Come on.

267
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
I own both systems, okay?

268
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Alright.

269
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,400
I can't help it if they keep disappointing me.

270
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
Okay.

271
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Well the emailer raises a valid point.

272
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Why does this Uncharted get passed off as Tomb Raider with a guy whereas lots of other

273
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
games are copies of each other?

274
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,400
Well I'm not saying that all the games that come out are original anyways.

275
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
I mean, shit.

276
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,400
There's how many World War II first person shooter games out there?

277
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
I mean, seriously.

278
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:32,880
And if I were to compare Halo 3 to Resistance I mean it looks and kind of plays very similar

279
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,880
so.

280
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,880
Ah, so you did?

281
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
Yeah, that's true.

282
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,560
You did make an Xbox 360 comparison earlier in the show.

283
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,200
I mean I'm not saying that all the 360 games that come out are original and that's definitely

284
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,560
not the case.

285
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,680
You know, but I don't know it's just unfortunately the problem with Uncharted and not that it's

286
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,940
going to be a bad game or anything but unfortunately their track record so far is all these games

287
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:00,680
seem to be pretty average and it looks just like a Tomb Raider game but with a male lead

288
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,120
and they're expecting this to be this big holiday seller.

289
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,440
I don't think it's going to happen.

290
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,440
I mean, maybe Unreal Tournament 3 but then again, no, that's another first person shooter

291
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
game.

292
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,040
I mean, nothing's original nowadays.

293
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,000
It's very hard to make an original game.

294
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,160
Well we'll withhold that final judgment until the game is actually released and you get

295
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,160
a chance to play it.

296
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,160
That's fine.

297
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,120
I'm not going to buy it but you know what?

298
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,720
If you want to buy it and if you like those kind of action adventure games then maybe

299
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
that's something for you.

300
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,800
Maybe that's the game that you've been looking for for the Playstation 3.

301
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,880
If you're waiting though for some of these other games that they keep promising us but

302
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,680
you know, I'm very disappointed that we don't have Final Fantasy 13 yet or even a demo of

303
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,680
it as they promised us before but all this stuff keeps getting pushed back.

304
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,920
I love the bell idea though.

305
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,080
It's because Sony and they can.

306
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
Comments from chat.

307
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,080
Chat.orangehonestradio.com.

308
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,880
Rob D. would like to say, no it's not.

309
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,760
It's very hard to get funding for an innovative game because it's a risk.

310
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,760
There's a difference.

311
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,760
So next email?

312
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,760
Yes, please.

313
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,760
That's the bell idea.

314
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,760
We'll do that.

315
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,760
Next email.

316
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
This comes from Ospher.

317
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,760
Dear Rob.

318
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,920
Yeah, I said Rob but everyone else can chime in with their opinion if they wish to do so.

319
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,840
You always talk about Final Fantasy 12 as such a great game.

320
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
Why?

321
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,980
What's so great about a game that has a boring political storyline?

322
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:24,200
To me a great compelling story like Final Fantasy 7 and 10 are what make the games great.

323
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,480
Also I don't like the battle system.

324
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,720
It's way too much like World of Warcraft.

325
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,240
I prefer the strategic system like in Final Fantasy 10.

326
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,440
Speaking of which, Final Fantasy 10 needs more praise.

327
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,680
For me it's the best game in the series and one of the few games I have ever pulled an

328
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,800
all-nighter on.

329
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,760
Why the story is freaking epic.

330
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,560
It's compelled me to keep playing.

331
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,720
I also love the battle system and don't really mind the random battles.

332
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,960
Final Fantasy 10 too wasn't that bad either.

333
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,960
People just need to quit complaining about Yuna singing which I think is really good.

334
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,560
A Thousand Words is an amazing song.

335
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,240
The only thing that made me sad is that Final Fantasy 10 too likes summons but oh well.

336
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,240
Thanks for reading Ospher.

337
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
I agree.

338
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,960
It's 12 is actually one of the Final Fantasy games I have not played.

339
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:13,040
I just have no, it doesn't, I don't know, it just doesn't.

340
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,660
You know I don't know how else to say it.

341
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,160
I enjoyed the story.

342
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,700
Sometimes you watch a movie that one person doesn't like but another person likes.

343
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,400
I would agree though that 10 is sometimes underrated by the community as a whole and

344
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,120
gets a lot of shit that it doesn't deserve.

345
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,120
I love 10.

346
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,120
10 had a great story.

347
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,680
But I don't think the battle system, I mean the battle system in 12 to me is what makes

348
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,680
it so great.

349
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,760
It's not the story that makes 12 great.

350
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,240
I think the battle system is what makes it great.

351
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
I hate the battle system.

352
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
Really?

353
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,480
It's not like WoW to me.

354
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,920
It's more like Final Fantasy 11 but with people that you can control.

355
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,120
What I've gone through with the story so far, I actually like political stories.

356
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,760
I love things that make you think.

357
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,920
You know and maybe, I don't know if that, I'm not trying to be rude or anything but

358
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,320
sometimes people don't like stories that require a lot of, I would have to say, logical thought

359
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,420
as opposed to emotional thought.

360
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,420
You know what I mean?

361
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,680
Well, a good game takes both.

362
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,200
A good battle schematic and a play schematic and story.

363
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
And here's the thing.

364
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
I'm going to use 8 as an example.

365
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,960
I can't fucking stand Final Fantasy 8 and it has nothing to do with the story because

366
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,700
I think the story is awesome and I kind of wish they would have made the story what they

367
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,120
ended up making the movie, Final Fantasy the movie.

368
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,160
But my problem with Final Fantasy 8 is that the battles and the whole junctioning magic

369
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,440
and all that shit ruined the game for me.

370
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,880
Single-handedly ruined the game and could not stand the battle system at 8.

371
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Couldn't stand it.

372
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,840
So I didn't want to play through it.

373
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
See, 8.

374
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,200
I kind of liked the junctioning.

375
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,280
I mean, I really, really liked having to draw your spells.

376
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,280
Drawing magic.

377
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
It hits a nerve.

378
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,280
I liked it.

379
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,280
I couldn't stand it.

380
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,280
I liked that part of it.

381
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,160
But by the time I got to the third disc and was trying to put together my weapons and

382
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,120
shit, I was like, BORED NOW!

383
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,080
So I watched someone else beat it and didn't have to.

384
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,200
I had already gotten all the other cool cutscenes anyway.

385
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,320
That's why I said before I got to the end of the first disc, I'm like, ugh.

386
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,000
The second disc had some cool crap in it.

387
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,360
Had the Ultimatia battles and all that.

388
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,720
I don't really like when the monster is level with you either.

389
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
I don't know.

390
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
Yeah, no, that was kind of...

391
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,720
That kind of thing bugs me.

392
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,720
I don't know why.

393
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,400
I like being able to go to so and such area and knowing what to expect.

394
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,400
You know.

395
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:21,040
But then again, this next email, if we are ready.

396
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
It's from RobWithTwoBees.

397
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,040
Yes, ma'am.

398
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,040
Oh, I haven't heard from him in a while.

399
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
Hooray for RobWithTwoBees.

400
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,040
Well, he sent us a few stories, but...

401
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,000
And sometimes we try to work them into the show role, but, you know.

402
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Oh, here we go.

403
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,320
I haven't said this in a while, but the latest Xbox Live Arcade title, is it Genom or Genom?

404
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,640
I guess it would be Genom if you were using proper pronunciation.

405
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,680
Oh, that's the one I mentioned in part A.

406
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,760
I think that was the name.

407
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,000
Had everything right except for fun.

408
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,400
It just isn't fun to me.

409
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,320
I'm hoping I missed something, but the whole collection of dots is arbitrary and making

410
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,680
them in... and then making it an arena game competitive dot eating.

411
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,680
Rob?

412
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,640
No, I kind of agree.

413
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,360
I mean, the game... let's just say I did not jump up and want to spend 10 bucks on this

414
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,360
game.

415
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,960
I mean, I just... I don't know.

416
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,960
You're right.

417
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,480
It's just... it's like all the parts are there, but the whole they'd add up to.

418
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,480
It's just...

419
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,320
It's like when you look at $10, you know, spending on that game and you're saying, hmm,

420
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,760
look, Res HD is coming out at some point and Ikaruga and all that stuff.

421
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,760
It's like...

422
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,760
Ikaruga?

423
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,080
Yeah, I don't know if I want to spend $10 on this one.

424
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,600
I can buy that for probably about $10 as well, so...

425
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,840
That's a damn fine point.

426
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,840
That's it.

427
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,840
Ikaruga.

428
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,880
Um, next email, shall I?

429
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
You shall.

430
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,800
Dear Our Lady of the Rosary, OLR, video game missionaries, howdy, I have two questions

431
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
for you fine people.

432
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
What?

433
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
I don't know.

434
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Okay.

435
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
Someone be creative.

436
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
Huh.

437
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,800
What?

438
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
That is certainly creative.

439
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
I beat the ferret in your honor.

440
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,280
And the ferret liked it.

441
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,880
One, I once had a PS2, the original bigger kind, but it was getting a little spotty on

442
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,360
playing some games and I wanted a GameCube anyway, so a couple of years ago I traded

443
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
it in.

444
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,680
But now I miss the Silent Hill games.

445
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,680
Never finished two.

446
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,440
Why haven't you finished two?

447
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,840
It's the shortest one.

448
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,840
Anyway.

449
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,320
But I've been getting all nostalgic when you guys talk about them.

450
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,540
And I want to play Final Fantasy XII, so I'm going to buy one, buy a used one online with

451
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,540
some birthday money.

452
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,220
However, I'll be getting a slim PS2 and I remember reading something about the slims

453
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,300
getting too hot and frying the unit.

454
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:29,120
My question is, do I have to worry about this with used slash refurb PS2s or have all the

455
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,760
units in question been recalled or fixed at the time of refurbishment?

456
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,240
If I do have to worry about this, is there some way I can tell if the unit I get is one

457
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,040
of the models prone to overheating?

458
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:43,200
That I personally do not know because I actually have our first PS2 still and it works just

459
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,580
fine.

460
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:50,140
And on top of that, I have a first model Japanese PS2 that works just fine, which is an oddity.

461
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,140
You know what?

462
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,140
Here's the thing.

463
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,120
Any system is going to have some faulty ones, but you can take steps in making sure that

464
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,760
the system is not going to fry itself and that would be, you know, make sure...

465
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,920
Not buying it on eBay.

466
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,600
Don't put it in an oven.

467
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,780
Make sure it's in a well-ventilated place.

468
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,560
You know, don't put it in a box.

469
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,400
Take care of it when you move it around, you know.

470
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:15,040
A suggestion I do have that came back from the Dreamcast days is if you have carpet or

471
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,960
anything, put a flat surface down like, you know, a cutting board or something and then

472
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,960
set your system on top of that.

473
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,880
And that way it'll be elevated so that the vents, if the vents are underneath it, can

474
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,880
get some...

475
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,440
You're like the Martha Stewart of gaming.

476
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,400
Well, you know, the Dreamcast did have a problem with getting a little too hot.

477
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,220
Without the jail time.

478
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,600
And without the bad hair.

479
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,440
And without the fruits of the garden.

480
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
No, my Slim PS2 works just fine.

481
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,440
I've been using...

482
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,800
I did not buy an American PS2 until the Slims were out.

483
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,560
I only had a Japanese PlayStation 2 for the longest time.

484
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,840
And I finally bought a US one when the Slims came out.

485
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,000
So it works just fine for me still.

486
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,680
So for whatever it's worth, there you have it.

487
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,680
Shall I move forward?

488
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
You shall.

489
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,680
Yay.

490
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,720
Oh, the second question by this person.

491
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,600
One of my favorite games ever is Pokemon Snap and I've been hoping for years to make a sequel,

492
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
but to no avail.

493
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:18,160
Are there any other good photography themed games out there that you would recommend?

494
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,480
I know Metal Gear Solid 2 had a camera and some of the Zelda games had minigames, but

495
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,040
other than that, I don't know anything, especially with photography figures and largely.

496
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
Keep on rocking.

497
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,040
Ciao, Atreyu.

498
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
I highly recommend.

499
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,040
What's with Atreyu tonight?

500
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,040
That's just...

501
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,040
Atreyu.

502
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,040
Wow.

503
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,040
Say my name.

504
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
Bashur.

505
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,040
Hey, Bastion.

506
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
What?

507
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,760
I highly recommend Bioshock because you have to take pictures of dead bodies.

508
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,760
Dead Rising.

509
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
Dead Rising.

510
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,760
Dead Rising.

511
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,760
Dead Rising.

512
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,760
An awesome photography mode in there.

513
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Good point.

514
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,760
Yes.

515
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,760
Eternal Sonata actually has...

516
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,600
Don't get the card capture soccer at a game on Dreamcast.

517
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,460
Eternal Sonata actually has a photograph.

518
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,080
One of the characters, their special move, they can take photos and you can control what's

519
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,860
taken a picture of and you can sell the photos at shops and the better the picture, the more

520
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,860
they sell for.

521
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,860
Here's the thing.

522
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,280
One of the things I should have said was one of my kind of complaints about the game.

523
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,720
It totally throws the game off balance.

524
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,000
Weapons and things and the part of the game I'm in are like 800 gold, 1,000 gold maybe.

525
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,640
You can sell one picture for 14,000 gold.

526
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,400
Gold is not a factor in this game if you just take 10 pictures and sell them all.

527
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,280
They don't even have to be that good at pictures.

528
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,000
That's one other little bitch I have about Eternal Sonata is that I think somebody threw

529
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,080
the photo system way out of whack in testing.

530
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,080
Next email?

531
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,400
I'm not certain but I believe this is something else from Rob about the man who died after

532
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,180
three days straight in the internet cafe in China.

533
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,160
The game he played was Online Bridge.

534
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:53,440
How unexciting but it shows that it's self neglect from obsession, not an MMO or other

535
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
game.

536
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
Good point.

537
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,240
Because most of us automatically think, oh, he was playing Warcraft.

538
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,520
No, he was playing Bridge.

539
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,360
These people who do online poker or something.

540
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,360
It's Final Fantasy XI.

541
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,360
It was Evercrack.

542
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,360
Evercrack takes another soul.

543
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,120
Nope, it was Online Bridge.

544
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,800
Hoyle is deadly.

545
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
So shall I keep going?

546
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
You shall.

547
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,880
Dear OLR, I recently joined a game rental service and decided to rent out Earth Defense

548
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:23,040
Force, although it was the PS2 version since I don't have a 360, to find out whether Loki's

549
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,880
claims were accurate or not and they are sort of.

550
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,880
The game is fun.

551
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,200
It's really fun destroying armies of ants, sorry, gigant horse, is supremely satisfying

552
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,720
and the way that you can mold the battlegrounds by destroying the infected city is genius.

553
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,700
The variation in weapon types gives the game an element of strategy and all loads extremely

554
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,920
quickly very useful on some difficulty levels.

555
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,400
I forgot I played more of Earth Defense Force this week as well.

556
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,880
Maybe you're just so used to it that it just blends in with the rest of your schedule.

557
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,880
Yeah.

558
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,320
The game's budget nature is very obvious from the horrible color scheme that makes some

559
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:02,040
levels look like big piles of sludge to the plot, which is basic to say the least.

560
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,720
It's common to find the alien invaders trapped in the scenery while the variations in enemy

561
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,040
types are small and uninteresting visually.

562
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:14,160
There are some that fly, some that shoot suspicious looking brown stuff from their bottoms, but

563
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,120
in the end, they're all ants.

564
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,360
Whether these problems are dealt with in the sequel, I don't know, but they don't detract

565
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,480
from the game too much.

566
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,000
Put simply, the game is a grown-up version of squashing armies of ants like I did when

567
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I was a kid.

568
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,780
The squashing ants never seems to get old.

569
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,800
The Afro guy.

570
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,440
I still have yet to play Earth Defense Force.

571
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,600
I'm going to have to check it out.

572
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,760
I'm telling you, they need, and there's another story we can get to later, they need to bring

573
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,560
out the other PlayStation 2 games and convert them over to be able to be played on some

574
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:50,460
of these systems over here because seriously, all the games have been almost exactly the

575
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,320
same, just different locations and stuff, but I don't think they get old at all.

576
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,480
It's still a very scary thought to me that our reviews and suggestions on games actually

577
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,480
influence people.

578
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,480
It's kind of scary.

579
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,680
Well, speaking of someone wanting some influence, we got an email from the doctor.

580
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,680
All right.

581
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,680
Hooray.

582
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,880
I love the doctor.

583
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,880
So I'm going to read it.

584
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,120
Hello, I've been somewhat busy.

585
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,520
Do you guys remember Shadow of Destiny for the PS2?

586
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,940
I can't find it in any GameStop or EB games and I really want to play it again.

587
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,600
If you guys remember it, could you possibly give me your thoughts on the game?

588
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,140
I didn't play it.

589
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,920
And to DarkSakura, I got me a Sonic Screwdriver pen and I love it.

590
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,960
I use it at work to write with him and pretend I'm the doctor.

591
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,040
I have a Sonic Screwdriver too.

592
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,520
One of our listeners sent it to me and I love our listener now forever.

593
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,320
I saw the Dalek the other night too.

594
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:44,040
Yes, I have the remote control Dalek that goes for like $100 on eBay and I got it for

595
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,040
$40.

596
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,040
Nice.

597
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,840
Oh, we got another email at the end and it's from Warrior Bob.

598
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,840
Wait, hold on.

599
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,840
Shadow of Destiny?

600
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,440
I didn't play it either.

601
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,440
That's kind of weird.

602
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,640
There's like this one game we totally like all missed.

603
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,360
I was trying to look up screenshots but our net's running slow because of the webcam,

604
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,760
so oh well.

605
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,320
Well, I'm going to read.

606
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,520
Since Warrior Bob got this email in right before, I'm going to read it too because Warrior

607
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,560
Bob is like my hero.

608
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,560
Shall I?

609
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,560
Sure.

610
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,800
Dear OLR, I got to play Rockman this week during the demo at Sac State.

611
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,760
By now I'm sure you've heard plenty about the game and I won't bug you further but I

612
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,480
discovered some things that I thought might be of interest to you, more veteran music

613
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,480
game fans.

614
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,360
This is a long email so feel free to edit as you choose if you read it out loud.

615
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,120
First the game implements what used to be called guessing penalty.

616
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,200
Any extra inputs you make beyond what is required of you are counted against you and reset your

617
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,200
combo.

618
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,200
Good.

619
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,740
Fans of drum mania or keyboard mania will notice this first as those two games let you

620
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:42,640
hit as many extra notes as you wanted to without penalizing you and therefore let you improvise

621
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,640
a bit.

622
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,960
It's a command you can't improvise until you're told to, except sometimes on vocals.

623
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:53,600
Second, the drum pedal on the pre-release units works just like in arcade drum mania.

624
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,280
It's big, has a long throw and relatively little resistance and it triggers somewhere

625
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,080
near the end of its throw but not all the way at the end.

626
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,160
No quick bass rolls with your toes here.

627
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:08,400
Third, the drum pedals connect to the main unit by a 1-8 inch mono foam plugs, basically

628
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,840
the mono headphone jack.

629
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,120
These work electrically like I think they do, you should be able to wire two of them

630
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:18,020
in parallel using a mono headphone splitter and make a double bass so that you can be

631
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,120
the god of thunder.

632
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,480
I asked a harmonics dev about this and he said he will try it at the office and get

633
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
back to me.

634
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,920
Fourth, biorite sucks.

635
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,640
Yes, they do.

636
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,800
Fifth, there is a crazy advanced slide compensation tool built in-

637
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,600
Wait, he just threw that in the middle there?

638
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Yes, it's true.

639
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
This is why you love Warrior Bob.

640
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,600
It's damn true.

641
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,480
Didn't they go out of business?

642
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,480
I think so.

643
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
Then stop hatin'.

644
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,480
Stop hatin'.

645
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,480
I still hate them, Rob.

646
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,680
Fifth, there is a crazy advanced slide compensation tool built in case your TV internally de-syncs

647
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,680
audio and video.

648
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,680
I love harmonics.

649
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,400
Lastly, the new guitar buttons and switches feel very solid and responsive.

650
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,160
This drum bar is a bit longer now and does not use clicky micro switches but still seems

651
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,160
to be pretty accurate.

652
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,600
I have experimentally verified that it works well played behind your head and between your

653
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,600
legs.

654
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,360
Looking forward to your next show tonight, Warrior Bob.

655
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,520
Yes, see, mine must have been busted from constant use or something.

656
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,520
Someone must have broke it.

657
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:20,560
Who knows what kind of, I don't know, drunk middle-aged people were playing it at the

658
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:24,160
event that I went to, but it's fun.

659
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,880
Sounds like fun.

660
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,320
Is that it for email?

661
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,720
That be all, sir.

662
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,720
Goodbye, email bag.

663
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
R.

664
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
Send us more.

665
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
Mailbag, orange.onstrator.com.

666
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,720
You know what we have missed, though?

667
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
What?

668
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
Talk Like a Pirate Day?

669
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
Talk Like a Pirate Day.

670
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,720
I was just thinking because you said R. I was like, did you celebrate?

671
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,760
I did by making a one-line comment in my live journal.

672
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,760
It was Talk Like a Pirate Day.

673
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,880
I was off that day, so I made a pirate and slept in my cabin.

674
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,520
I was doing other pirate related things.

675
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,880
I was pirating comic books.

676
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,240
I sent an email to all my coworkers with something from I Can Ask Cheeseburger that I said you

677
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,720
better have a good and productive work day today or else I'm going to send you to the

678
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,080
captain because it was Talk Like a Pirate Day and it was a little kitty that had a little

679
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,720
hook and a pirate hat on it.

680
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
I know that picture.

681
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
It said something like...

682
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,720
I can have booty.

683
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,400
No, it said something like, why you laughing?

684
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,400
Walk plank.

685
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Or I said walk plank or something like that.

686
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,440
It was really funny, so I sent that to my coworkers.

687
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
That's how I celebrated.

688
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,440
Yeah, I'm lame.

689
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
Shut up.

690
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,440
Let's see.

691
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,440
I was going to chat.

692
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,440
Oh, yeah.

693
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,120
Chat's commenting on things that they're watching on the operator 11 feed and Phildo wants to

694
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,160
know why doesn't Loki get a comfy chair because Loki gets one of the kitchen chairs to sit

695
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,160
in here.

696
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,160
They can't...

697
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,160
It's a far sight more comfy than the one that was there.

698
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,640
Yeah, the unfortunate one that was here is this crappy computer desk chair that was actually

699
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,480
slanted forward and had even less padding than this piece of wood.

700
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,120
Now I know I'm not supposed to show Jamie on the cam and I won't, but I can show that

701
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,400
she gets a fancy little blue chair to sit on.

702
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,800
So you can see I'm showing her feet on the footstool.

703
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,920
You can see this fancy little chair that she gets to sit in and that's why Loki has to

704
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:06,320
take the crappy chair because the woman took the nice chair, I guess, is how it goes.

705
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,640
So there you have it.

706
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:15,240
Anyhow, moving on to another story because I don't want this to turn into too much TV

707
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,640
or else folks are going to go crazy.

708
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,640
Loki, what's up next?

709
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:28,040
Anywho, so of course pretty soon we're going to be getting a Project Gotham Racing 4 demo

710
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,200
and it's going to have content, I guess, that's exclusive to the demo itself.

711
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:37,600
In fact, I guess there's supposed to be some electric versus gas engine race that they're

712
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
going to be doing.

713
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:44,280
There's also going to be arcade mode, which is going to be exclusive to it, set in Makau,

714
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:49,560
I guess, Makau, and it's going to feature exclusive challenges.

715
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,840
So I guess that's kind of neat that it's going to have that.

716
00:29:53,840 --> 00:30:01,680
They're also going to feature a time trial for, it looks like a Nurburgring Snow and

717
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:09,160
it's, yeah, it says it's due out, well the game I know is due out in what, two weeks?

718
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,760
So the demo's got to be coming out here pretty soon I'd imagine.

719
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,920
It's kind of weird that the demo would have something special.

720
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:21,240
It would be kind of cool if whatever content was in the demo you could get in the game

721
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,160
because you downloaded the demo.

722
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,160
Like some type of unlock.

723
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,160
I don't know.

724
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:30,520
Well it's just like what they did with, what was it, Ninja Gaiden Sigma, where you earn

725
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:37,480
money in the game and then you can transfer it over to your save on the full retail version.

726
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,080
Interesting.

727
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:46,480
Well, one thing on the Xbox 360 that some folks were doing on Talk Like a Pirate Day

728
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,360
was doing some piracy of their own and it was leaking Halo 3 onto the internet.

729
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:58,080
Yes, that's right, Halo 3 made its way to some where's sites, 6.14 gigabytes is how

730
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,760
big the game clocks in as.

731
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:06,540
And of course, you know, kind of sucks that people are doing this and taking away from

732
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:10,520
the folks that have spent so much hard time and effort developing the game.

733
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:15,680
But at the same time, kind of impressive that they did it that fast.

734
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,320
But yeah, that's just a gift for releasing the game.

735
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,640
Well also, you know it's only going to be a matter of time before Microsoft figures

736
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,880
out how it's done and puts a little ban on it.

737
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,720
Or did they finally figure out some way that Microsoft can't patch its way out of?

738
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,000
Because I thought Microsoft liked to put down the ban hammer on this stuff and patch it.

739
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,160
There's ways, I guess, because I don't pirate 360 games, so there's ways I've read that

740
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,280
you can patch the game where it's undetectable.

741
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,960
I think all of it's done, I mean it's going to be hard for them to do that because they

742
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,280
have some sort of encryption on there, so if that's cracked, then the only other thing

743
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,920
is there's a media detector or something like that that detects whether you're playing

744
00:31:53,920 --> 00:32:01,120
a CD-R, a DVD-R, a press CD, DVD, etc.

745
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,060
And if you can change that, if you can get that to go over so that makes a DVD-R look

746
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:11,820
like a press DVD, then really the system's going to have no way of telling whether that's

747
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:19,840
a burned disc or an actual copy of Halo 3.

748
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:25,200
At one point, it is going to be impossible to stop it unless they change up something

749
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,240
else or that you can't crack them.

750
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,480
Remember, for the longest time, PlayStation 2 games, with that bad blocks that they put

751
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,800
on there so that you can't burn them, that stopped people for a while, but eventually

752
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,000
they figured out how to get around that, so it's only a matter of time before that happens,

753
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
if it hasn't already.

754
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,400
Yeah, but, I mean, when they try to take these things online, won't it kind of screw it

755
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,400
up?

756
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,900
No, I mean, the game, if they don't, if the system can't tell that it's not an official

757
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,720
game, then no, there won't be any problems.

758
00:32:53,720 --> 00:33:00,520
It's if you run a special firmware or something that disables that checking, that's when

759
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:05,680
you're going to run into problems, but if the system itself cannot tell that, you know,

760
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:11,160
it's a burned copy and you haven't modified it in any way, then, yeah, you will be able

761
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,720
to get away with it.

762
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
Hmm.

763
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,720
Interesting.

764
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,320
All right, well, I imagine, though, it's just a small percentage, a very, very, very small

765
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,600
percentage of people that are able to get away with this, and the game will still sell

766
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,000
like hotcakes the day it was released.

767
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,520
Yeah, they're going to make tons of money.

768
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,760
That's not a problem.

769
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,600
And besides, the people that are pirating it probably had no intention to buy it in

770
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
the first place.

771
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,200
And, Loki, you did not get banned for playing Halo 3 early, right?

772
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,520
No, I did not.

773
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,800
The only thing, here's the only thing that they did do is the matchmaking servers aren't

774
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,360
up, so you can't play online.

775
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,240
Oh, noes.

776
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,240
Right now.

777
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,240
Until they start them.

778
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:54,360
Well, something that you can play online on Xbox Live is Viva Pinata Party, the demo is

779
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,360
up.

780
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,760
No, Viva Pinata Party Animals is up, I'm sorry.

781
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:04,320
It's 971.17 megabytes.

782
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,360
It's basically a big minigame compilation, and it's, of course, by Rare.

783
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:13,600
So the official game is going to be out by Christmas with over 40 minigames, and you

784
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:20,040
can burp boats down a stream and smash up gardens.

785
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,720
Wow.

786
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,120
Burping boats is just so much fun, you know.

787
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:29,120
It's a, I think it's a racing game mixed with minigames.

788
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,280
Escapist in our chatroom asks, will someone be proposing on that one as well?

789
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,960
You know, funny story.

790
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,700
Sometimes I forget that there's actually quite a few people who listen to this program, not

791
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,240
to sound like you could do this or whatever, but when we first started the program, we

792
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,340
were lucky to get like 15 people listening to our show.

793
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:51,600
And since we've been doing the podcast, the numbers have climbed a little bit.

794
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,560
And you remember last week we did that story about the guy who got engaged on Viva Pinata.

795
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,560
Well, guess what?

796
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,840
He sent us a message on MySpace.

797
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,840
Did he?

798
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,080
Yes, he did.

799
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,760
He said, he actually wants to come on the show to, what did he say, correct some of

800
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:09,760
the things that the bloggers who, you know, live with their parents and stay at home all

801
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,000
day got wrong.

802
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And I'm like, great.

803
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,520
I totally want to hear it from the horse's mouth.

804
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,600
So I'm hoping we have him on next week or soon.

805
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:20,480
I wanted to get him on this week, but he really wanted to do an interview on iChat, and unfortunately

806
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,560
the way we're wired where we have the Mac laptop does our Operate 11 stuff and the PC

807
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,120
does most of the audio here, it just wouldn't work for me to do iChat.

808
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,060
But I'm hoping we can call him this week and get him on the show next week.

809
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:36,440
So if you're listening, Mr. Pinata, let's make that interview happen this week so you

810
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,440
can clear the air.

811
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,040
I still think it's kind of retarded, but we'll go a little bit there.

812
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,200
It's like there's people who propose, though, on the big screens, though, but that I sort

813
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,120
of feel like you're pressuring someone into saying yes.

814
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,120
Well it's just...

815
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,460
It's in a public place like that?

816
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,460
But I don't think it was.

817
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,460
It was in their home.

818
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,600
Well, if it's in their home, that's one thing.

819
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,440
Well, we'll find out soon.

820
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,880
We're going to ask all the questions.

821
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:07,480
Part of me kind of goes, is this really big to be on all these different blogs?

822
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,800
I mean, this is kind of a private matter in a way, but I don't know.

823
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,800
We'll see.

824
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,800
We'll see.

825
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800
We'll get our questions answered.

826
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,440
I'm excited.

827
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,360
Back to the gaming news, then.

828
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,360
Yes.

829
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:25,520
Anyways, one thing I'm excited about, as I hinted before, the Simple series is possibly

830
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,160
coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

831
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:36,600
According to some digging done during Tokyo Game Show, the Simple 2000 series, which of

832
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:42,320
course brought us wonderful games, much like Earth Defense Force, they're talking about

833
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:48,980
releasing some of them on, of course, the online service, and possibly also the Playstation

834
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,480
network as well.

835
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,680
And according to Kotaku's article here, it says they're asking about the possibility

836
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:03,200
of the series turning up as downloadable titles, and they said that they had two cheap, easy

837
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:09,960
games coming out on Xbox Live Arcade soon, so maybe we'll see some more stuff from that

838
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,960
series come over.

839
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,880
I hope they port some of that stuff, because there's some weird shit over there, like Zombies

840
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:21,400
versus Abulances, and more shit like that.

841
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,400
Awesome.

842
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Gotta love it.

843
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,320
Well, you gotta love this, too.

844
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,320
I know Loki loves this.

845
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,520
Lesbians!

846
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,200
I do love me some lesbians.

847
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,200
Oh, lesbians.

848
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,680
Then you'll definitely want to pick up Mass Effect.

849
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,800
I was already going to pick it up.

850
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,360
It's like the icing on the cake.

851
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,880
Well, apparently, Mass Effect has been causing some waves in the gaming blogs and the gaming

852
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:46,000
news sites this week, because apparently, if you play as a female character, there is

853
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,960
a sex scene that you can initiate in the game, and you can initiate this scene between her

854
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:54,200
and a male human or a female humanoid alien.

855
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,960
So you get some female on female action.

856
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,960
But here's the thing, though.

857
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,020
You can also play as a male character, however, a male character can only initiate sex between

858
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:10,000
him and a human woman or the humanoid female alien.

859
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,360
So no man sex, but Lesbo's okay.

860
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,360
But surprise, butt sex is great.

861
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,400
Well, here's another thing, okay?

862
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,400
Just a thought.

863
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,040
Maybe the storyline, it's between these two women anyways.

864
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,820
It's either pick one or the other, something like that.

865
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,240
Maybe because your character, they didn't make a branching type of storyline or something

866
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,280
for this one part.

867
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,280
I see.

868
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,360
So you're saying this lesbian sex is for artistic and story purposes?

869
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,960
It's like the character in the game or something.

870
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,760
For example, wasn't there something in Knights of the Old Republic or Jade Empire or something

871
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,840
like that where they had something similar?

872
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:53,080
I think it was Knights of the Old Republic II or maybe the first one, where if you played

873
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,520
as a female character, then yeah, it would be a lesbian.

874
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,820
Almost like your partner or something had some love interest with you, and so it's sort

875
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,080
of lesbian since you're playing as a female character.

876
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,840
But really what it was is that they didn't program any different responses between a

877
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,200
male and female character.

878
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:16,120
Well, even though I still really want this game, the lack of man sex makes this gay man

879
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,200
a little bit angsty.

880
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,200
So you know what that means.

881
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,640
It's time to bring on the FUs of the week!

882
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:33,080
Dr. Sakura, why don't you start us off?

883
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,760
I know lack of gay sex makes you mad.

884
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:45,720
Well, yeah, but FU to male drivers, especially stupid old men, and men who drive big trucks

885
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,000
and SUVs.

886
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,640
Every last bad driver I've encountered on the road has been male.

887
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,100
First of all, when I was picking up Dan from the airport yesterday, there was a guy driving

888
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:03,480
in Altima, and he was drifting into my lane, and I didn't know if he was just changing

889
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,700
lanes without signaling or if he was just old and stupid.

890
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:12,960
He seemed to me in about middle age, but he almost bumped me off the road until I banged

891
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,360
on the horn, and his wife shook him awake.

892
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:20,440
He couldn't have been more than 50, so he wasn't that old.

893
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,840
But I was like, you stupid man!

894
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:29,640
And then this guy driving a truck, cutting off everybody in front of him, just being

895
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:35,440
an asshole driver, which I consider being an asshole driver is pretty much equivalent

896
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,220
with being a bad driver, because you're supposed to maintain your cool and calm on the road.

897
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,720
And if you do get angry, you're not supposed to let it affect how you drive.

898
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,080
This guy was cutting off everybody left and right, he made one car swerve, and I did thankfully

899
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,840
get to see him get pulled over.

900
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,400
I saw an asshole driver get pulled over this week, and it was very satisfying.

901
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,540
And then, you know, I saw so many people just changing lanes without signaling, and almost

902
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,340
causing accidents, and you know, every last one of them happened to be male.

903
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:09,120
So I would like to point out there that bad drivers are bad drivers regardless of gender,

904
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,920
shut the fuck up.

905
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,800
Next, please.

906
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,240
Anyways, I didn't really have anything to make an FU for, but now I do!

907
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,720
So um, yes, once again, women drivers, horrible, in fact, I bet that guy falling asleep is

908
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:28,440
probably falling asleep from nagging from his wife, so you know, I blame her for that.

909
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:33,880
But yeah, there are a lot of bad drivers, especially SUV drivers, cell phone drivers,

910
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,520
and cell phone drivers are even worse than stupid men.

911
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:42,320
And a combination of those as well, so, lucky the bad drivers, no matter which sex, may

912
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,320
or may not.

913
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,320
Mainly women drivers.

914
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,920
Hey, cell phone drivers are the worst.

915
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,920
Sorry, Rob.

916
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,040
Uh, well that's alright, I don't, I have my Bluetooth now, so it doesn't matter.

917
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,040
Yes.

918
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,240
Although I never got in an accident while talking into phone and driving, it's an urban

919
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,240
legend.

920
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,680
Um, it's made up, just like how man actually went to the moon, it's all made up, those

921
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,680
cell phones.

922
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:09,760
Uh, what was I gonna say, I don't really have a whole lot of FUs, so I'll just say, um,

923
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:17,040
I don't know, the FU to lack of angst this week, I'm actually in a pretty good mood,

924
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,920
FU to the million and one projects I have at work.

925
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,400
I have so many projects at work, I'm all project out.

926
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,960
Projects are work of the devil, and I have too many of them.

927
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,960
That's it.

928
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,200
A rather tame FU this week.

929
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,040
So there you have it, another successful FUs of the Week segment.

930
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,440
I have one last thing I was just gonna add in there real quick.

931
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,440
Oh lordy.

932
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,760
FU to the Halo 3 launch because I fucking hate having to deal with customers asking

933
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,400
about when they're gonna get Halo 3.

934
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,400
Absolutely hate it.

935
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,520
You'll get it when it's good and ready.

936
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,520
Exactly.

937
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,240
That's how you should respond to them too.

938
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,160
Alright, back to some gaming news.

939
00:42:52,160 --> 00:43:02,160
Well, um, anyone who is interested in watching movies and things on Xbox Live will be happy,

940
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,440
as an anime fan at least, will be happy to know that S.T.A.R.S. is bringing different

941
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,440
shows.

942
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,600
We are getting Ghost in the Shell, Stand Alone Complex, Both Seasons, Street Fighter 2V,

943
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:18,320
Noian, Toko, Virus, and Astro Boy.

944
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,380
There's actually a bunch more.

945
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:31,000
Some of the other ones that were listed is, well, at least they have particular access

946
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,840
to was like Blood the Last Vampire, A Different Loop in the Third, Appleseed, Blood the Last

947
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:41,000
Vampire, Ninja Scroll, Perfect Blue, I love Perfect Blue.

948
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,160
Just different series.

949
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,080
I haven't seen a single one of those series you mentioned.

950
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:50,080
Perfect Blue was like, oh my god, Head Trip.

951
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,160
I've seen it twice in the theater.

952
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,280
Perfect Blue was weird.

953
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,080
Perfect Blue was awesome.

954
00:43:55,080 --> 00:44:00,920
Anyway, some people are not so happy about NHL 2K8 charging you $5 to unlock a feature

955
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,920
that's already on the game.

956
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:11,600
This feature, of course, is actually the 2K real maker add-on, and it will allow you to

957
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:17,120
do a variety of video recording and playback options for the game, but the download was

958
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:23,200
a puny 108K, which means that you're just paying for an unlock key for something that's

959
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,640
already on the disc.

960
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:30,240
That being said, at the same time, you don't have to buy it, and it was 400 Microsoft points

961
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,440
or $5 in real money.

962
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,740
That is kind of shitty.

963
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,520
It is shitty, but here's the thing.

964
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,520
Don't buy it.

965
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,520
If people don't buy it, they will stop doing stuff like that.

966
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,800
But people keep buying this shit.

967
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,800
You know what's funny?

968
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,120
Eternal Sonata has something like that, too.

969
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,420
Eternal Sonata has a theme that you can just unlock.

970
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:54,640
I think it's you get all the piano score pieces in the game, which you would unlock naturally

971
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,640
just by playing it anyway, if you have the patience to play it the whole way through.

972
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:03,240
But I'm thinking, in sports games is one thing, but a game like Eternal Sonata, if you don't

973
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,840
have the patience to play it the whole way through, what the fuck did you buy it for?

974
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:11,040
I mean, really.

975
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,040
Sports games, you play over and over and over again in little bursts, but a game like Eternal

976
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,240
Sonata is really meant to be played start to finish.

977
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,240
So what good does this...

978
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,640
I don't know, it doesn't make sense.

979
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,160
They're just hoping for people to buy these things at a push of a button.

980
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:30,280
What does make a little more sense is buying things that were not included with the original

981
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,840
game, such as new outfits.

982
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,760
This is pretty interesting, is that Bomberman Live is going to be getting a new download

983
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,760
pack.

984
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,900
Actually, I believe it's already up, this new download pack they have.

985
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:45,200
One of the characters that's in the download pack is based off of the mascot from Destructoid.com,

986
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,280
which of course is another gaming blog.

987
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,440
We had some of those guys on our year-end show a while ago, we'll have to have them

988
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,440
back sometime.

989
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,520
But yeah, they've crossed over from gaming press blog site into video game character

990
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,960
with their little mascot, that green little robot face thing that they...

991
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,080
Actually, I thought it was silver in some of the pictures I've seen, but whatever.

992
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:09,180
Color be damned, the little mascot has certainly made a name for itself now by crossing over

993
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:14,200
into a OMG legitimate video game.

994
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,800
So where's the giant Loki head for future expansions or something like that?

995
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,360
People would argue there would have to be a Tingle head, because they're fascinated

996
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,360
with the character Tingle.

997
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,360
Oh, then that wouldn't work.

998
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,720
I do not understand this, but whatever.

999
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,200
Then that wouldn't work, because you're crossing over, you know, Nintendo, and then that's

1000
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,200
like mixing...

1001
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,680
Then they would say, oh, he should be in Super Smash Brothers Brawl, you know, as Tingle,

1002
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,680
dressed up as Tingle.

1003
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,680
Yeah, there you go.

1004
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,680
That's like mixing...

1005
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,680
That's an awesome idea.

1006
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,680
Why don't we make that happen?

1007
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,680
No, just kidding.

1008
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,680
No, it's not an awesome idea.

1009
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,200
That's like mixing the matter with antimatter.

1010
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,000
I don't know.

1011
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,320
Escapist in our chat room asks, if Destructoid can do it, why not Bomberman based on the

1012
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,320
OLR staff?

1013
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,120
Well, that's a very nice thought.

1014
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,800
I'm sure, A, Destructoid gets like a million more hits in a month than we do.

1015
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,840
You know, we're just a tiny little show in somebody's spare bedroom, whereas Destructoid

1016
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,960
is like, you know, they've come a long way.

1017
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,440
They've only been around, what, like a year and a half?

1018
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,400
They've come a long way.

1019
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,760
B, I seem to recall that a couple weeks ago, I don't know if it was their E3 coverage or

1020
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:15,960
they had some coverage of some expo that was sponsored by Bomberman and they had like ads

1021
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:16,960
all over their site.

1022
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,480
So they had some type of relationship going on with the folks that made Bomberman.

1023
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,160
So, you know, that's kind of cool though and I'm not going to...

1024
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,040
I think it's awesome what happened.

1025
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:31,720
And I love the fact that the Microsoft community as a whole is really seeming to embrace the

1026
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,600
community more and more.

1027
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:40,440
You know, some of our other buddy podcasts, such as the Gamerscore blog and Gamertag Radio,

1028
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,360
what are all those guys called together?

1029
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,360
Gamercast.

1030
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,480
They all have their own pictures up on the marketplace.

1031
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,480
That's pretty rad.

1032
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,200
Hopefully we'll see more of those very soon.

1033
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,320
Yes.

1034
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,640
Anyhow, back to the gaming news.

1035
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:02,400
Well, something that should interest a few people, especially that are mobile phone gamers,

1036
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:10,400
coming out will be Rockman Dash, which is one of the Mega Man Legends series.

1037
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,320
It's a new Rockman Dash game and those fuckers didn't put it on a damn console that I can

1038
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,320
play.

1039
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,320
I hate the...

1040
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,320
Cell phones do not need more games.

1041
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,200
I hate the Mega Man Legends games.

1042
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:28,440
There's also Resident Evil 4 mobile edition, Devil May Cry Dante vs. Virgil, Sengoku Basara,

1043
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:33,200
Tactical RPG, and Breath of Fire 4.

1044
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:38,000
I wouldn't mind having Breath of Fire 4 on my phone, but anyway, that's all Japanese

1045
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
only right now.

1046
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,840
Yeah, but it's mobile phones, so who cares?

1047
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,840
I care.

1048
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,840
I play Lumines on my phone.

1049
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,840
Really?

1050
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,840
Yes.

1051
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,840
Really?

1052
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:48,840
Why?

1053
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:54,800
Because, first of all, I can sneak around outside at work and play it, and it's actually

1054
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,800
not too bad.

1055
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,360
Actually, I enjoyed Lumines on mobile phones, too.

1056
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,360
I have to be honest.

1057
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,000
I'm going to load it up right now.

1058
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I'll play it during a show.

1059
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,480
Well, you have fun with that, Miss Thing.

1060
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,480
I will.

1061
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:12,080
Anyways, so, maybe you're looking to find that special someone to eventually proclaim

1062
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,960
your love over Viva Pinata 2.

1063
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,080
Well, fear not.

1064
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:22,940
We're here to help you, and thanks to the Sexy Video Game Land blog, they have compiled

1065
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,600
a list of what they think are...

1066
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,240
What a great blog name, by the way, might I add.

1067
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:35,720
The best video game pickup lines, and here are some to run by you guys, including, What

1068
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:40,080
do you say I take my flag to your base and score?

1069
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,760
So you ever been in a five-man raid?

1070
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:48,440
Hey, baby, I need a new hoe, and it ain't for gardening.

1071
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,080
How does that have anything to do with video games?

1072
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,080
It's Harvest Moon.

1073
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,080
Oh, God.

1074
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,760
That's so stupid.

1075
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:59,880
Let me call you Silent Hill, because things will really get freaky when I'm inside you.

1076
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,960
I know how Mario must feel, because I really want to clean your pipes.

1077
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,520
Call me Ash, because I choose you.

1078
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,520
There's a warp zone in my pants.

1079
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,520
I made that one up.

1080
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,520
Oh, let's see.

1081
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,880
You're just like an RPG.

1082
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:22,520
I can't wait to take you home, unwrap you, put it in, and then grind away until sun rises.

1083
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,800
Girl, you got me like WarioWare, I'm touched.

1084
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,880
That's stupid.

1085
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:32,360
You can't be Phoenix Wright, because I have no objection to you, baby.

1086
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,360
Okay.

1087
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,800
Those are awful.

1088
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:40,920
If you're a devil, you may cry by the time I'm finished with you.

1089
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,240
You remind me of a game of Tetris.

1090
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,440
You always want the long ones.

1091
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,440
What?

1092
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,360
That doesn't even make sense.

1093
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,360
That's stupid.

1094
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:58,120
Hey, baby, can I hide my solid snake in your box?

1095
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,200
That makes me want to throw up a little.

1096
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,320
I think I did just throw up in my mouth.

1097
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,960
Now, see, our chat room's joining in now.

1098
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,960
Did you throw up in your stomach, Rob?

1099
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,960
Huh?

1100
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:08,960
Did you throw up in your stomach?

1101
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,960
Shut up.

1102
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,920
DJ Dark Knight says, back me wool, baby.

1103
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,760
That's an old OLR joke.

1104
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:19,960
Rama says, hey, baby, how about I dance dance to your revolution and you beat my mania?

1105
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,440
Okay.

1106
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,640
GS68 says, you must play 2DX because you've got me on hard mode.

1107
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,720
I don't like that one, that one's funny.

1108
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,720
Warrior Bob says, you remind me of Tetris.

1109
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,080
I just want to make you disappear.

1110
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:36,720
I mean, wait, have sex with me.

1111
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,120
I like that one.

1112
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:42,800
My favorite pickup line was always, hi, I like peanut butter, want to fuck?

1113
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:48,680
Or how about this one, babe, you're hotter than my first edition 360s power supply.

1114
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:49,680
That's lame.

1115
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,680
Stupid.

1116
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,680
Wow.

1117
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,680
Lame.

1118
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:58,720
Baby, you could screw attack me all night long.

1119
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:04,480
Anyhow, Jiranami says, you must play Tetris because you're stacked.

1120
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,240
That one's actually kind of good.

1121
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,240
Not bad.

1122
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,720
Jiranami has a funny joke once in a while.

1123
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,720
All right, moving on, please.

1124
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,720
Add it to the toilet paper.

1125
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,200
For the love of God, a new story, please.

1126
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,280
From video game pickup lines from, what was that, Sexy Game Blog?

1127
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,280
What was it called?

1128
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,280
Sexy Game Land Blog.

1129
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,360
Sexy Game Land Blog, nice.

1130
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:26,640
Moving on to something completely different, political stuffs, and that would be Mitt Romney

1131
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,640
specifically.

1132
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,640
You might know him.

1133
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,840
He's a Mormon guy, right, running for president on a Republican ticket?

1134
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,120
I don't keep up with too many Republicans.

1135
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,520
Very staunch conservative fellow.

1136
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:43,440
Well, he has once called video games, quote, a cesspool of violence, sex, drugs, indolence,

1137
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,040
and perversions.

1138
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:50,880
So imagine the irony and hilarity when you notice the Mitt Romney ad campaign ad start

1139
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,280
showing up on gametrailers.com.

1140
00:52:54,280 --> 00:53:00,800
That's right, a joystick snapped a picture of gametrailers.com site with, and it's not

1141
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,800
a Photoshop thing.

1142
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,800
It's the real deal.

1143
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,760
It's the game trailer's little logo there and the Mitt Romney ad right on top of the

1144
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:07,760
site.

1145
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,400
Hilarity that their campaign would be advertising on the site.

1146
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:18,240
Now let's see, I'm going to go for the obvious here and say that probably there are people

1147
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:23,760
or whatever bought into a package deal or some type of advertising company that distributes

1148
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,280
through all these different websites and game trailers just happens to be one of many.

1149
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:32,840
Because doesn't MTV own game trailers, I want to say, or there's some type of partnership

1150
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,840
there?

1151
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,840
I could be wrong.

1152
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,840
I don't remember.

1153
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:40,920
But yeah, there's probably some much bigger thing and just showed up on that site.

1154
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,920
That's kind of funny.

1155
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,040
That's karma for you.

1156
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,280
This is why we don't do banner ads on orangeontrader.com.

1157
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,720
This is also why we're poor, I'd just like to point out.

1158
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,500
But irony for the win in this case.

1159
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,960
So there you have it.

1160
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,440
Well, here is a little bit more for anyone who wants.

1161
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,960
Yakuza 2 is coming out in the US.

1162
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:08,760
Dinosaur King and Mystery Dungeon is also coming out thanks to Sega.

1163
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:16,440
So they are supposed to be coming out in 2008 and I think that's going to be very cool because

1164
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,880
I honestly want, I actually was looking into a little bit on Mystery Dungeon.

1165
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,680
It's Sheeran the Wanderer.

1166
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,800
Dinosaur King is a game where you collect 100 dinosaurs with different moves and you

1167
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,960
make them fight.

1168
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:34,840
And wow, I just won Yakuza 2 so I can go around beating people up.

1169
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,000
You just like violence.

1170
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I do like violence.

1171
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,800
I like beating up people wearing nice suits.

1172
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:45,000
Alright, those games coming to you very soon from Sega.

1173
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,400
Also coming to you very soon, the Skype line.

1174
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:54,080
You can give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.

1175
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,880
We love to be interactive.

1176
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,920
But one more story for you real quick.

1177
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,920
Yeah, I like being interactive alright.

1178
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,320
Anyways, enough with the pick up line, seriously.

1179
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,960
Although I have to say this, SSJ100Matt sent me a message and says that there should be

1180
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:12,520
a voicemail challenge for people to leave pick up lines on the Skype line voicemail.

1181
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,080
Do you want some hot coffee?

1182
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,320
Yeah, so please, I love that idea.

1183
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:21,560
So please call, if you give our number a call either on Skype or the phone number when we're

1184
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,880
not live, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1185
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,560
Leave us a message with your sexy video game pick up line and we'll play some of our favorites

1186
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,040
on next week's show but I bet you we don't get any.

1187
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:39,200
Anyways, in case you had hopes and dreams that that wonderful Halo 3 Legendary Edition

1188
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:44,720
game box was actually going to become a brand new helmet for your cat, unfortunately that

1189
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:53,040
will not be the case because the helmet itself, as IGN found out, is not hollowed and will

1190
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,560
not fit on your cat.

1191
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,560
That sucks.

1192
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:01,160
I can't put the helmet on my cat and watch my cat run into walls.

1193
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:04,040
But I mean, with some simple modding you probably could do that.

1194
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,960
Oh wait, I don't own a cat.

1195
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,960
I own a cat.

1196
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:12,360
There's no way a cat would put their head in that anyways.

1197
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,560
Could we put the helmet on the ferret?

1198
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,560
Yeah, that would look weird though.

1199
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:18,840
That we might be able to pull off.

1200
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,200
I bet Shermie's little head would fit in it.

1201
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,200
She's got a small brain.

1202
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,200
Are you kidding?

1203
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,120
Shermie's the fattest cat I've ever seen.

1204
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,320
But her brain is very small.

1205
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:30,960
Cats aren't dumb enough to put their head in there.

1206
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,960
Alright, our Skype line is open if you want to call.

1207
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:40,200
Give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.

1208
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,560
And while we wait for some calls, last minute stories.

1209
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:50,780
Yes, this is very interesting, well not for me, but for maybe Rob, apparently if you were

1210
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:56,280
looking for some man sex type game or whatever, there's Duel Love which is going to be coming

1211
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:03,240
to the DS and it includes a part of the game where you scrub down a naked man.

1212
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:07,840
Oh god, I saw a preview for that on some website.

1213
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,760
It looks stupid.

1214
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,760
Somebody sent me a link to it.

1215
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,760
It looks stupid.

1216
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,760
Anyway, we're getting some phone calls.

1217
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,200
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1218
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,200
Who's this?

1219
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,200
Oh, this is Warrior Bob.

1220
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,200
How's it going?

1221
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,200
I'm Warrior Bob.

1222
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,200
It's good.

1223
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,200
How about you?

1224
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,200
Not too bad.

1225
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,200
Long time, no chat.

1226
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,320
Yeah, serious.

1227
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,200
So we read your email about the rock band.

1228
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,200
Good times.

1229
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,200
Yeah, thank you.

1230
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,600
Loki went down and played it, but I missed out.

1231
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,880
I totally forgot.

1232
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,080
Oh, when was he there?

1233
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,080
Today.

1234
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,680
Oh, that's why I didn't see you.

1235
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,960
Were you there like all day or something?

1236
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,660
I was there most of the day, Thursday and Friday because I had a group of friends going

1237
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:42,880
and I figured, eh, why not?

1238
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,400
But you went to the Sac State one, right?

1239
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,400
That's right.

1240
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,840
Loki went to the Ribs and what was it, Ribfest?

1241
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,440
The Rhythm and Ribs Fest.

1242
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,440
Rhythm and Ribs.

1243
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,440
I should have gone to that.

1244
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,440
I love Ribs.

1245
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,440
That's awesome.

1246
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:58,520
I went to the one on Friday where I had the work and unfortunately I only went until six.

1247
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:01,680
Unfortunately a rib festival doesn't work very well for someone who's trying to be more

1248
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,680
vegetarian but what have you.

1249
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,680
Anyway.

1250
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,960
I'm unemployed so Friday was a great day.

1251
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:06,960
Ah, gotcha.

1252
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:07,960
What would you call in about tonight?

1253
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:08,960
What's on your mind?

1254
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,280
Well, so, I figured it's the first time I've gotten to listen to your show live in a few

1255
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:17,240
years so I'd figure I'll take some of your advice.

1256
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,480
I've been playing the Guardian Legend while I'm listening.

1257
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,480
Yay!

1258
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,480
Awesome.

1259
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,480
What do you think?

1260
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:27,760
It's fun and I can't put my finger on it but what in God's name am I supposed to be doing?

1261
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:32,440
Wandering around, you fight things and collect the power-ups and then you go into the different

1262
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:39,700
levels and the levels are numbered by like one, twenty-one, two, you know, they back

1263
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,700
and forth.

1264
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:41,700
I think it's one, eleven.

1265
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:47,360
Yeah, one, eleven and your last two levels are ten and twenty and they are fucking hard.

1266
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:51,320
Here's the thing is that you walk around the Zelda-ish world looking for where the corridors

1267
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:57,600
are and the first few corridors are easy to open up but what happens is that later on

1268
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,100
the corridors get harder to open up.

1269
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:02,520
You have to figure out the tricks to open them up and you can either cheat and go to

1270
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:06,040
Game Facts or you can look around for those little blue happy face guys, what do they

1271
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,040
call them?

1272
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,040
The Lunars?

1273
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,040
What do they call them?

1274
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,040
Oh, they're like the Lolo guys.

1275
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:13,120
Yeah, they look like Lolo and they give you tips on how to open up the corridors.

1276
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:18,160
When you beat the corridors like one through ten, they give you a key like you'll get a

1277
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:22,520
little moon key or you'll get a little square key or a diamond key and that will allow you

1278
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,520
to progress to another section of the Zelda world where there are more corridors waiting

1279
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,520
for you.

1280
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,520
Well, that makes way more sense.

1281
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,080
I thought I was supposed to go to like level moon or level plus sign or something.

1282
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:35,800
No, no, you find those moons and plus signs in the corridors when you beat them.

1283
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,840
Yeah, they're different keys.

1284
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,440
And then the corridors eleven through twenty just give you weapon upgrades and stuff, right?

1285
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,440
I think so.

1286
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,440
Yeah.

1287
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,440
I don't think you get too much other stuff special.

1288
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:48,640
Well, you still have to beat every level to progress through it, but the weapons that

1289
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,880
you get, the one weapon that's going to be your best friend, especially in the last level,

1290
00:59:52,880 --> 01:00:00,760
is the multidirectional ball because you can shoot it up, down, left, right, and diagonals

1291
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:04,640
and the way you beat the last boss is so freaking easy, but everything else is really hard.

1292
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:05,640
Drunami says...

1293
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,640
This is way better than GameFAQs.

1294
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,640
Thank you.

1295
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:12,560
But TGL mode, you want to try TGL mode at least once.

1296
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:16,240
You go into your password and just put in an all caps TGL.

1297
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,240
Okay.

1298
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,240
I'll give that a try.

1299
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,320
It's just all the shooting stages back to back.

1300
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,520
And it gives you your power-ups, however, there are ways to get around and get earlier

1301
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:29,720
power-ups and other things playing in RPG mode, but TGL mode is definitely for the win.

1302
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:30,720
Crazy talk.

1303
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,640
Drunami says they're called Blue Landers just for the record.

1304
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,320
I like Lolo better.

1305
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,920
Lolo was pretty awesome.

1306
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:40,200
Where it ever happened to Lolo, there was like three of those games on the NES and then

1307
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,200
Lolo disappeared.

1308
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,000
He showed up on Virtual Console.

1309
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Oh, that's right.

1310
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
He came out.

1311
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,280
You know, Lolo should be in Smash Brothers because didn't HAL make a... and HAL is like

1312
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,680
a second party, right?

1313
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,680
They're owned by Nintendo, kind of.

1314
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,500
They only make games for Nintendo.

1315
01:00:56,500 --> 01:01:00,220
And they made Lolo and they're the ones that make Smash Brothers, right?

1316
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:01,220
They are.

1317
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:02,880
So where the hell is Lolo in these games?

1318
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:08,280
He probably died because everything kills you in that game.

1319
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,440
There was a button that killed you in that game.

1320
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:15,680
Escapist said Lolo moonlighted in the first Kirby game then disappeared.

1321
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,680
That's true.

1322
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:21,760
He probably hit the select button or whatever the seppuku button was in Lolo.

1323
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,040
Those were some tough games.

1324
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:25,040
That's right.

1325
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,040
There was Lolo Lolo and La La La.

1326
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,620
Remember his girlfriend, La La La?

1327
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:30,520
She was the girl because she had a bow in her hair and she was pink.

1328
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,520
The quintessential girl.

1329
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:32,520
Well, there's the connection.

1330
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,520
Kirby had King Dedede.

1331
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,560
It's like you take a syllable and just repeat it a bunch of times.

1332
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:40,420
We need a new... yes, we need a new enemy in this next HAL game.

1333
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:45,960
How about King Nanana or King Boo Boo Boo?

1334
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:49,600
They let their babies name them, actually, is what they do.

1335
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,320
Learn your first Japanese character and just write it a bunch of times.

1336
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,320
That's right.

1337
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,760
All right, WarriorBob, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

1338
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,680
No, I've got an NES plugged in now, so what should I play?

1339
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,000
I've got a legend fund, but I'm looking for more ammo.

1340
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,200
More NES games to play.

1341
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:07,760
Well, I said Cobra Triangle earlier in the show and I still stand by that one.

1342
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:14,080
Here's one of my favorite NES games that nobody ever talks about, Snake, Rattle, and Roll.

1343
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,080
I've got that.

1344
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,080
I'll put that in.

1345
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,080
That game is rad.

1346
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,080
You've got to play that game.

1347
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,080
DuckTales.

1348
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:22,080
Yeah, DuckTales is awesome.

1349
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:24,080
Chat rooms can be used to suggest it's true.

1350
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,080
All right, thank you guys so much.

1351
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,080
Yeah, no problem.

1352
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,080
Have a good one.

1353
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,080
See you next time.

1354
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,080
See you.

1355
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,240
I hope WarriorBob comes back to visit sometime.

1356
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,200
It was fun having him on the show.

1357
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,760
And lots of folks in the chat room are chiming in.

1358
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:39,240
Tech Mobile, Ninja Gaiden, Clu Clu Land, Arkon.

1359
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,240
That's a good suggestion.

1360
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,240
Arkon.

1361
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,240
Clu Clu Land.

1362
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,720
Oh my God, I played so much of that stupid game.

1363
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,920
I did an Animal Crossing.

1364
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:46,920
We have another call.

1365
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:47,920
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1366
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:48,920
Who's this?

1367
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,360
No, this is Mr. DeBucket.

1368
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,760
Hello, Mr. DeBucket.

1369
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:52,760
What's on your mind?

1370
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,160
He's going to yell at me for kicking him over the Dreamcast.

1371
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,760
No, I'm not going to yell at you for that.

1372
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:58,760
That's understandable.

1373
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:02,160
I know how Dreamcast fans are really defensive.

1374
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,160
This is true.

1375
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,160
What's on your mind then?

1376
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,920
Oh, Metal Gear Solid 4, Metal Gear Solid Online.

1377
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:13,120
I wanted to know what you guys thought of them making the game separate from the multiplayer.

1378
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,000
You know, I don't, here's the thing, I have to be honest.

1379
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,540
I don't follow the Metal Gear series too much, but I'm, I'm kind of welcoming the idea of

1380
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:21,600
an online version.

1381
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,300
I think that might be a lot of fun.

1382
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:29,120
Kind of like a, not so much like a first person shooter, but kind of like a different type

1383
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,600
of direction for that.

1384
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,600
But I don't know.

1385
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:35,240
Like, I'm not so excited about Metal Gear Solid 4 because I didn't play the first three

1386
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,240
so much.

1387
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:40,440
Like, I haven't really played a Metal Gear game since Snake's Revenge on the NES, I have

1388
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,440
to be honest.

1389
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,440
You played that?

1390
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:43,440
Yeah, I did.

1391
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,440
I rented it one weekend.

1392
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,440
I played quite a bit of it.

1393
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:46,440
How did you finish it?

1394
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:47,440
Huh?

1395
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,440
How did you finish it?

1396
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:51,960
As far as I got was I found like a dude tied up by some, you know, in the middle of the

1397
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:52,960
jungle.

1398
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:53,960
I untied him.

1399
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:54,960
He runs off.

1400
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,760
I leave and then it's just all darkness and fireworks going off.

1401
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,600
I seriously don't remember.

1402
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,680
When I rented it, I was like 11.

1403
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,560
Yeah, every time we went to a new screen, it was all dark, then fireworks went off and

1404
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:09,600
everything was lit up for some reason and helicopters couldn't see you even though you're

1405
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,720
standing right next to them.

1406
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,420
Well, how do you feel about it because you must have called this because you had an opinion

1407
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:14,420
on it.

1408
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:16,160
Oh yeah, I think it's an interesting idea.

1409
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:19,540
I mean, if you don't like Metal Gear that much, if you really can't get into the single

1410
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:23,520
player, the multiplayer aspect, since it's the second game, I'm pretty sure you will

1411
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,080
be able to buy it separate.

1412
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,520
You could like that better.

1413
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:33,680
Also, they change the controls to make them more like Western games or things that a lot

1414
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,640
of online gamers would get into.

1415
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:40,760
Now use R1, the shooting stuff, kind of like most games do, using the right trigger, the

1416
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:44,320
fire, and use L to aim.

1417
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:49,080
The Sons of Patriot system, which is a new thing you can do because no multiplayer game,

1418
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:52,720
you can always see your buddies and tell if they died or something like that.

1419
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:56,800
You know, say like this person's name got shot, but you can actually see everything

1420
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:57,800
that they're doing.

1421
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:03,400
Every time you begin a match, you all link up and you can see everybody's stats and

1422
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:08,740
what weapon they have and what they're exactly doing so you can go help them out or something.

1423
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:12,100
It's a really cool system and it's a completely different game.

1424
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:15,800
They're selling it different, but if you do buy Metal Gear Solid 4, you will get like

1425
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,040
a starter pack or something.

1426
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,640
Yeah, I heard about that.

1427
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:23,760
Yeah, apparently they're going to be making more downloadable content over the next years

1428
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,200
if people still play it.

1429
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,200
That's cool.

1430
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,220
You know, and I think what you said is kind of right where I feel, is that I'm not so

1431
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:32,800
excited about Metal Gear Solid 4, but I hear about this online one and I'm like, oh really?

1432
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,760
That looks like it could be fun.

1433
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:38,560
You know, I don't really follow the story, but you know, just throwing me in the arena

1434
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,560
and shoot them up so it looks like a lot of fun.

1435
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,200
So I definitely will check it out if nothing else.

1436
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,280
I may not get so into it, but we'll see.

1437
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,280
Okay.

1438
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:49,000
All right, well anything else you want to share with our listeners today?

1439
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,840
No, I just think the show was good and I'll keep listening from that one.

1440
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:54,840
I appreciate it.

1441
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:55,840
Thank you very much.

1442
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:56,840
Have a good one, buddy.

1443
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:57,840
Bye.

1444
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:58,840
Bye-bye.

1445
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:01,200
Even if he did, even if he was hating on the Dreamcast, what do you say about the Dreamcast

1446
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,080
that got him kicked?

1447
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:08,080
Just it was in this pickup line thing saying the Dreamcast sucks dick or something.

1448
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:15,040
Okay, Rob, do you remember, in fact, I think that we should play this though in the Afterbirth.

1449
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,040
What's that?

1450
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,040
I'll try.

1451
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,040
I'll try.

1452
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,040
I'll try.

1453
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,040
I'll try.

1454
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,040
I'll try.

1455
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:22,040
I'll try.

1456
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,040
I'll try.

1457
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,040
I'll find it.

1458
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,040
All right.

1459
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,040
I picked up a call.

1460
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,040
Let's go to the phones.

1461
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,040
Hi, you're on Orange County.

1462
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,040
I'll show you.

1463
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,040
Who's this?

1464
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,040
Legend of Zaku.

1465
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:32,040
Hello, Legend of Zaku.

1466
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,040
What's on your mind?

1467
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:37,440
Nah, just chilling, just getting ready for digital life, which is at the end of the week.

1468
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,440
I'm sorry.

1469
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:39,440
I'm not coming.

1470
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:40,440
I was looking forward to it.

1471
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,440
Something else came up.

1472
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,440
I've been knowing that.

1473
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:43,440
It's all right though.

1474
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:53,680
Just the general stuff within the community, stuff like Middle Gear Solid 4.

1475
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:54,680
What the hell are you typing?

1476
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,880
Hey, are you typing to somebody else?

1477
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:57,880
It's our turn.

1478
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:58,880
You talk to us.

1479
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:03,920
No, I mean Final Fantasy, all the Halo stuff, all the reviews.

1480
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:10,840
Most of them are actually all the Halo 3 reviews coming back almost at 100 or something.

1481
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:17,640
The general internet says stuff like OMG, they probably got paid off by Microsoft, but

1482
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,320
yeah, that sort of thing.

1483
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:22,840
I'm not really buying into that much hype.

1484
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:28,200
Okay, Zaku, what are you most looking forward to about digital life?

1485
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,400
Just the DDR tournament.

1486
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,040
I'm competing in freestyle on Saturday.

1487
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:35,440
Are you getting hints about your routine?

1488
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,440
Not yet.

1489
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:47,480
When you see it up on YouTube, hopefully at that night after the tournament, then you'll

1490
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,480
see something.

1491
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,240
But yeah, I'm trying to keep it under wraps.

1492
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:56,640
I will be looking for you on the YouTubage.

1493
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,560
Why else do people do DDR freestyle anymore?

1494
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:04,520
It's all about being on YouTube and everybody being able to watch your routine.

1495
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:09,840
It's kind of like a dying art right now because most tournaments don't even have that except

1496
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,340
for a few exceptions.

1497
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:15,240
If they have that whole SingStar thing on the PlayStation 3 where you're going to be

1498
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:18,640
able to upload your videos like a karaoke thing, why don't they do that with DDR?

1499
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:19,640
That's what I don't get.

1500
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:24,120
Microsoft doesn't care or Konami doesn't care.

1501
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,320
Most DDR makes us have some sort of camera support.

1502
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,480
I know the PS2 ones have iToy.

1503
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,480
Exactly.

1504
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,480
I don't know about 360.

1505
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,840
So how about just a website you can upload all that to?

1506
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:33,840
Come on.

1507
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:34,840
It's free.

1508
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:35,960
So Konami, I'm giving you free hints here.

1509
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:39,960
I don't think Konami is ready to drop that much bandwidth on that.

1510
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:45,160
I mean, they're taking DDR that far, but that's about it.

1511
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,840
What else is on your mind tonight, buddy?

1512
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:51,320
Just really go over the whole rumble.

1513
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:57,480
Sony actually getting it supposedly taking their quote unquote last gen feature and just

1514
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:01,700
polishing it as if it were new.

1515
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:03,480
Basically polishing a turd.

1516
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:04,480
We all know better.

1517
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:05,480
All right.

1518
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:08,440
Well, Zach, I got to let you go to get more calls, but have a good one.

1519
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,840
Have fun in digital life and tell everybody we said hi.

1520
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:14,280
Tell Don I said hi and I'm sorry I didn't make it.

1521
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,840
Yeah, I will.

1522
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:16,840
All right.

1523
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:17,840
All right.

1524
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:18,840
Later, buddy.

1525
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:21,520
See, I'm having people relay my personal messages now.

1526
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,520
All right.

1527
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,520
Rob.

1528
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,520
What?

1529
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,520
I sent you that thing.

1530
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,520
Yes.

1531
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,520
Well, do you want me to play it now or do you want me to play it in the athlete?

1532
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,520
Right before.

1533
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:29,520
Right before.

1534
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,520
Right now?

1535
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:31,520
No, not now.

1536
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,520
Oh, right before the very end.

1537
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:33,520
You got it.

1538
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:36,360
A little treat for our live listeners.

1539
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:37,360
Are we going to get any more calls?

1540
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:38,360
I don't know.

1541
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:39,360
How about some more last minute stories?

1542
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:40,360
We'll wait for more calls.

1543
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,800
1-877-GAME-OLR or username orangeonsradio on Skype.

1544
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:43,800
Okay.

1545
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:44,800
Anything else?

1546
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:49,320
If you like Owen Dunn or Elite Beat Agents, you'll be happy to know that OSU, the sim

1547
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:52,560
for those games has been released onto the PC.

1548
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:57,480
It is available to download and is actually pretty interesting.

1549
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:04,460
You can find it at osu.ppy.sh and it's in one of their forum posts there.

1550
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:07,600
It's just like playing Owen Dunn but just with your mouse.

1551
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,080
Which must be insanely difficult.

1552
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,080
Hold on.

1553
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,080
We'll talk about that in a minute.

1554
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,080
We got another call.

1555
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,080
Hi.

1556
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,080
You're on orangeonsradio.

1557
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,080
Who's this?

1558
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,080
This is Misty.

1559
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,080
Hi, Misty.

1560
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,080
Misty.

1561
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,080
How are you, Misty?

1562
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:20,080
Up for once.

1563
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,080
Wow.

1564
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:22,080
I know.

1565
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,080
We never hear from you live on the show, but I'm so happy you were able to call in.

1566
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,080
OMG, a girl, everybody.

1567
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:33,800
Well, yeah, but you're always here.

1568
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,800
DarkSakura is looking at her boobs to make sure they're still there.

1569
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,800
What was that?

1570
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:38,800
OMG, a girl.

1571
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,040
I'm like, yeah, what am I?

1572
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:44,400
I wish you would let us put you on OP11 for the funny stuff like that sometimes.

1573
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,400
No.

1574
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,400
Alright.

1575
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,400
Well, Misty, what's on your mind tonight?

1576
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,120
You just wanted to say hi or what kind of games you've been playing lately?

1577
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,720
Well, actually, I went to the mall.

1578
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:55,760
I caved and got the Crimson Black Deus White Combo.

1579
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:59,480
I've been playing a little bit of Brain Age, got Cooking Mama.

1580
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:00,480
Awesome.

1581
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:04,480
What do you think of Cooking Mama?

1582
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:05,480
It is addictive.

1583
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:06,880
This is very addictive.

1584
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,560
What kind of foods have you been preparing in Cooking Mama lately?

1585
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:15,240
Pretty much so far the stuff that has retained its Japanese names.

1586
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:16,240
Okay.

1587
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:17,240
Very cool.

1588
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,240
Very cool.

1589
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:23,000
Is there anything coming out soon on the DS that you're looking forward to?

1590
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,440
Not really because I've only been half paying attention, but considering my birthday is

1591
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:32,040
coming up, I'm going to start paying more attention at Target.

1592
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,040
Okay.

1593
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,040
Let's see what else is coming out.

1594
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,040
I don't know.

1595
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:38,400
Actually, I don't know if there's a whole lot on DS coming out soon to get excited about

1596
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,400
this year.

1597
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,400
Zelda Phantom Hourglass.

1598
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,400
Ah, thank you.

1599
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,400
I knew I was forgetting something.

1600
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,400
It's the week after next.

1601
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,400
There you go.

1602
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,400
Zelda Phantom Hourglass.

1603
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:48,960
Most of their big stuff for the holidays have already come out like Brain Age 2 and all

1604
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,320
that, right?

1605
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,160
There's Final Fantasy Tactics on the DS.

1606
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:53,160
Final Fantasy IV.

1607
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,160
Oh, Final Fantasy IV.

1608
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:55,160
A front mission.

1609
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,160
Revenant Wings.

1610
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,160
All right.

1611
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,160
All right.

1612
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:59,160
So shoot me for not following the DS so much.

1613
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:00,160
My bad.

1614
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,440
Well, I don't think it's coming out this year, but...

1615
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:06,000
Now as folks in the chat room are giving you some advice on DS games to pick up, the Rob

1616
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,400
D says you need to get Clubhouse games.

1617
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,140
Son of Dad says Planet Puzzle League.

1618
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:11,140
That's a good game.

1619
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:17,160
Yeah, those two look like ones that I've been considering.

1620
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:23,160
And for Clubhouse, I have considered it last night, but I came and got Cookie Mommy because

1621
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:28,800
I saw that it was only $20, and I was trying to watch my money a little bit, because when

1622
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:29,800
I...

1623
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:30,800
The DS was...

1624
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,040
That game stuff was only my first step in the mall.

1625
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,720
I still had a good portion of the mall to go.

1626
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:36,720
Right.

1627
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,240
So I see the good deals always went out when they're cheaper.

1628
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,240
Always went out.

1629
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:42,760
Well, Misty, anything else you want to share with our listeners today?

1630
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:47,000
Not really that I can think of.

1631
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
All right.

1632
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,920
Well, Misty, thanks so much for calling in, and I'm glad to hear you got through.

1633
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:53,440
I know you've been listening to our show forever, and it's always good to listen to you live,

1634
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:54,440
all right?

1635
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:55,440
All righty.

1636
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,440
All right, have a good one.

1637
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,440
You too.

1638
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,440
Bye-bye.

1639
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,960
Misty is all kinds of rad.

1640
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,920
Misty makes OLR jewelry, which I think is the cutest thing ever.

1641
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:05,920
It's so cute.

1642
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:09,520
If you want to get in on that, go to the forums at our orangelawntrader.com.

1643
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,520
Click on forums.

1644
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:11,520
We're getting more calls.

1645
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,520
More.

1646
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,160
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

1647
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:15,160
Who's this?

1648
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:19,000
Hey, no more less day.

1649
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Is this Extover?

1650
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
This is.

1651
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,760
How's it going?

1652
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,680
You're actually listening to the show tonight, Extover?

1653
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:28,640
I went into the chat room.

1654
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:38,560
I was playing my puzzle quest, and I went onto the website, and so I decided to call

1655
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:39,560
in.

1656
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:40,560
Well, there you have it.

1657
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,560
I thought you guys were taking calls.

1658
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:45,440
Do you miss living where the show is recorded?

1659
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,440
Because now you have to call in.

1660
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,760
Yeah, I don't miss you, but I miss the show.

1661
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:51,200
I miss everything about the show.

1662
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,120
You miss Jamie and Matt, but.

1663
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,120
Yeah.

1664
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,120
Yeah, I'm all right.

1665
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,400
I miss Jamie and Matt.

1666
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:58,400
Nothing about you, though.

1667
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,400
Yeah, I know.

1668
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,400
I'm kind of.

1669
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,480
I'm really horrible to live with.

1670
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:05,120
You need to actually come with us to get Indian food when you can eat.

1671
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,380
Yeah, I know.

1672
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:15,360
Really that place is very friendly to the South Beach diet is what I was reading.

1673
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,200
It's all whole wheat or unbleached.

1674
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,200
And it's great for vegetarians.

1675
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,200
Except for the rice.

1676
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,600
It's awesome for vegetarians, too.

1677
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,640
I'm actually thinking about going vegetarian again.

1678
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,200
I just did three days ago.

1679
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,200
Did you?

1680
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,200
Yes.

1681
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,200
Cool.

1682
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,200
That's why I'm taking vitamins and stuff.

1683
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,120
I didn't want to make too big a deal out of it, because last time I went vegetarian, I

1684
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,120
was not able to do it for more than a week and a half.

1685
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:33,120
Well, yeah, but you were.

1686
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,400
So you're being a vegetarian, Rob?

1687
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,400
What?

1688
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,400
You're being a vegetarian?

1689
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:38,400
Yeah.

1690
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,600
I threw out everything I had that had meat in it, and I've replaced everything in my

1691
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,600
fridge with products.

1692
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:42,600
I'll tell you what.

1693
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:43,600
I will.

1694
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,600
Because I do have to have.

1695
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:45,600
Oh, my God.

1696
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:46,600
You're a loser.

1697
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:47,600
I get an email really quickly.

1698
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:48,600
Wait.

1699
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:49,600
Why'd you call me a loser?

1700
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,600
I don't know.

1701
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:51,600
Just don't like it.

1702
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:52,600
Go to hell.

1703
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:53,600
I hate you.

1704
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:54,600
What?

1705
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:55,600
Okay.

1706
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:59,160
I will go vegetarian with you, except I will need to eat fish.

1707
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:03,160
No, I'm going to eat fish, too, because protein's so hard to get.

1708
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,160
I get an email.

1709
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:05,160
Well, then you're not a true vegetarian.

1710
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,720
You're right, I'm not.

1711
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:09,960
So it would be more appropriate to say I don't eat meat.

1712
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:10,960
No red meat.

1713
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:11,960
Yeah, you're a fish-itarian.

1714
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:12,960
No red meat and no poultry.

1715
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:13,960
Yeah, I'm a fish-itarian.

1716
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:14,960
I can't give up sushi.

1717
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:15,960
I just can't.

1718
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:16,960
All right.

1719
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:17,960
Well, anyway, enough about that.

1720
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:18,960
Yeah.

1721
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:19,960
Who the fuck cares about what I eat?

1722
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:20,960
In other words, you're a pretty vegetarian.

1723
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:21,960
Nobody cares about what I eat.

1724
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:22,960
Extra fur.

1725
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,440
What kind of games have you been playing this week?

1726
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:27,320
I don't know if you remember, but we talk about video games on this show once in a while.

1727
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:30,680
What kind of video games have you been playing?

1728
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:36,920
I've been playing World of Warcraft and Puzzle Quest, big surprise.

1729
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:40,720
How's World of Warcraft been treating you?

1730
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:41,720
Pretty good.

1731
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:49,720
I'm at the end of a grind in the game, and I don't know.

1732
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:55,680
It's getting kind of boring, because I've gotten a lot of stuff, and so now I'm wondering

1733
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:58,480
what to do half the time when I get on.

1734
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:05,480
What are you most looking forward to about Wrath of the Lich King?

1735
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:07,120
I haven't decided yet.

1736
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:15,320
I think just to look in the new areas and stuff like that, explore in the new areas.

1737
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:19,400
When I come back to World of Warcraft, which is probably going to happen, because, oh my

1738
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:22,440
gosh, I can't believe we didn't talk about it during the news, but Final Fantasy XI,

1739
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:27,780
okay, A, I kind of stopped playing a couple weeks ago, but B, they announced that for

1740
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:32,380
the new expansion is coming out, Wings of the Goddess is the new expansion coming out,

1741
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:36,840
they have announced one of the new job classes for Wings of the Goddess, Dancer.

1742
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:37,840
So you can shake your booty.

1743
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:38,840
Yeah, I know.

1744
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:39,840
Oh, I'm so excited.

1745
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,400
By the way, Sauce says it's technically pescetarianism.

1746
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,400
Is that what it is?

1747
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,400
Pescetarian?

1748
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,400
Yes.

1749
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,840
Well, not eat the flesh of any animal other than types of seafood.

1750
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:52,200
Yes, and I don't want to live off seafood, but I just want that to be available, because

1751
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:56,800
I'm doing it for health reasons, not, you know, I'm not a member of PETA or anything.

1752
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:57,800
This is health reasons.

1753
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:58,800
People eating tasty animals.

1754
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,800
Well, hey.

1755
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:00,800
What?

1756
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:06,600
If you come back to WoW, then you can't, you're like a, you're a cooker, right, you cook food

1757
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:07,600
in WoW, right?

1758
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,600
Yes, yes.

1759
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,520
Yeah, so you can't make any meat anymore.

1760
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:11,520
But it's, it's a virtual.

1761
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,960
I'll call you a liar.

1762
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,440
It's a virtual game, it doesn't matter.

1763
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:17,760
And again, I'm not doing.

1764
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:18,760
It matters.

1765
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:19,760
It matters to me.

1766
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:20,760
Okay, if I was.

1767
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:23,180
If you give me meat, I'm going to call you a liar.

1768
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:27,200
If I was a card-carrying member of PETA, then maybe, but I'm doing it for health reasons,

1769
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:30,720
not, because I'll tell you what, making yourself vegetarian really makes you stop and think

1770
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:34,080
about everything you're eating, whereas usually, you don't.

1771
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,240
You don't, like, if you're not on some type of thing, you don't.

1772
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:37,640
But I don't want to talk about food anymore.

1773
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:38,640
Jesus Christ.

1774
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:39,640
All right.

1775
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:40,640
Aw, okay.

1776
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:41,640
See, now everybody in chat is yelling at me.

1777
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:42,640
I should never call myself a vegetarian.

1778
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,440
I'm just on a lifestyle adjustment.

1779
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:45,440
Who cares?

1780
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:46,440
All right.

1781
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:47,440
Excellent meeting up on you.

1782
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,440
You're ruining the show.

1783
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:49,440
I had a mushroom Swiss burger today.

1784
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,440
It was so good.

1785
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:51,440
You had a what?

1786
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,400
I had a mushroom Swiss burger today.

1787
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,400
It was so good.

1788
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,400
I'm so glad to hear it.

1789
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,520
Filled with meat and protein and meat.

1790
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:58,520
All right.

1791
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,520
I'm hanging up.

1792
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:00,520
Lots of meat.

1793
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:01,520
Buy extra frozen.

1794
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,840
But remember, you can only eat top cuts of meat.

1795
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:09,200
It has to all be lean, less than 3%, no, less than 5% fat from meat if you're doing South

1796
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,200
Beach.

1797
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,200
That's right, or you'll balloon up.

1798
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,200
Yeah, I know.

1799
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:15,360
You'll balloon up, and you'll look like all those contestants on Biggest Loser.

1800
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:17,160
You look like Roseanne.

1801
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:18,160
Well, good.

1802
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:21,560
Then I can try out for Biggest Loser next year.

1803
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:22,560
All right.

1804
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,560
I'm hanging up on you, Extrofer.

1805
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:24,560
Okay.

1806
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:25,560
Take care.

1807
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:26,560
I love you all.

1808
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:27,560
Bye.

1809
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:28,560
Bye.

1810
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:32,680
I'm surprised Extrofer didn't use the opportunity to tell us he was talking to us on his iPhone.

1811
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:36,960
Because usually he'll say, I'm on my iPhone.

1812
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:40,520
Actually the funny thing about Extrofer, he has a whole YouTube series now.

1813
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:42,760
His live journal posts have all been YouTube clips.

1814
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:47,200
Extrofer, if you're still in chat, you can plug your YouTube channel there.

1815
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:50,040
You have to spell his name really funny, so I can't even remember how to get there.

1816
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,480
There you go.

1817
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:55,120
And Extrofer will also be coming back to Orange Launch Radio just as soon as we can get coordinated

1818
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,040
and get our Wednesday show off the ground again.

1819
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:00,520
But we're going to do something with video this time, because of Op 11 and all that fun

1820
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:01,520
stuff.

1821
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,520
I'm going to hide.

1822
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:03,520
Well, it's the Wednesday show.

1823
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:04,520
You're not on it.

1824
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,920
I should come on the Wednesday show and bring pizza.

1825
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,200
But then you have to be on cam.

1826
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,200
No.

1827
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:09,200
Fine.

1828
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,200
Then you have to wear a paper bag over your head the whole time.

1829
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,520
Like Faust from Guilty Gear.

1830
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,360
All right.

1831
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:15,840
That's it for the Skype line tonight, you guys.

1832
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,080
Thanks so much for tuning in and participating.

1833
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:19,080
Play it.

1834
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,080
Appreciate it.

1835
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,080
Play it.

1836
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:22,080
Hold on.

1837
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,080
We're not there yet.

1838
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:24,080
I'm not there yet.

1839
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,080
Any more last minute stories?

1840
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:26,080
Yes.

1841
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,080
Thank you.

1842
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,080
I've been finding more as we wait.

1843
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:32,240
Anyways, some interesting stuff to kind of go back to last week's story, how we talked

1844
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:41,080
about Sony releasing 3.71 firmware for the PSP and the PSP Slim to circumvent the independent

1845
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,080
firmwares.

1846
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:49,240
M33 has just released the custom firmware 3.71 to combat that.

1847
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:54,360
So now you have all the wonderful features of the most current firmware for the PSP and

1848
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,520
you can also run homebrew.

1849
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:58,600
It will never work, Sony.

1850
01:19:58,600 --> 01:19:59,600
Try as you may.

1851
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:03,400
It will never, ever work.

1852
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:07,100
Anyways, some other interesting stuff.

1853
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:14,760
There is a Chinese MMO company, Shonda Entertainment, who has a MMO called King of the World.

1854
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:22,480
Apparently, they have banned men playing women characters.

1855
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,000
You know I only play women characters.

1856
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,400
You will be required to prove your gender via webcam.

1857
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:31,040
What if it's a really pretty guy?

1858
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,040
I know.

1859
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,040
That won't be hard to fake.

1860
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,040
What if you're Chris Crocker?

1861
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:36,280
Or just put your sister in front of the camera.

1862
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:45,600
What if you have a woman who has very masculine features?

1863
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,600
You mad.

1864
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:51,000
What do they do with trannies?

1865
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,280
No love for the transsexuals.

1866
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,960
I love trannies, Rob.

1867
01:20:55,960 --> 01:21:00,840
Pretty soon, actually, their EB is going to be no more.

1868
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:08,600
In fact, GameStop is finishing up converting over the remaining EB Games stores to become

1869
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,600
GameStop.

1870
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:18,440
Apparently, the official announcement has to be given, but people are noticing that

1871
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,920
more and more EB Games are slowly becoming GameStop.

1872
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,560
I wonder what's going to happen to the two that are in the mall.

1873
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,080
So it's kind of speculation, isn't it?

1874
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:34,640
Well, they said just this week that two stores in Rochester have already become GameStops.

1875
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,760
They've noticed more and more since then.

1876
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:41,520
Samurai Shodown 2 is coming to Xbox Live Arcade and the Wii.

1877
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,560
That was also the best one in the series.

1878
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:48,280
It was shown at Tokyo Game Show, so people will be happy about that.

1879
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:49,280
Best one ever.

1880
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:54,320
It is coming to the Japanese Xbox Live Arcade, so no word if it's coming to the U.S.

1881
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:57,960
It probably will be.

1882
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:08,400
Finally, there have been some tools released for modders of the Xbox 360 using a timing

1883
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:13,280
attack with a mod chip that's out there right now.

1884
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:20,520
You can drop your firmware down to one that can be exploited and it will allow you to

1885
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:26,920
install Linux on your Xbox 360 and probably also run Homebrew and, God knows, probably

1886
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:29,960
running backups of games.

1887
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:32,440
Real quick, this is more for in-studio, unfortunately.

1888
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:37,760
Check out this cool add-on for the Arkanoid DS game that's got the little paddle.

1889
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:38,760
That's cool.

1890
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:39,760
I saw that somewhere.

1891
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:40,760
That looks awesome.

1892
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:41,760
Yeah, that's pretty awesome.

1893
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:42,760
Let's see.

1894
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:46,840
I think, yep, that's all the stories I had.

1895
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:47,840
Well it's about time.

1896
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:52,480
All right, now DarkSakura, set up this YouTubage I'm going to look at here in studio and the

1897
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:55,280
folks on the stream and podcast will get the audio.

1898
01:22:55,280 --> 01:23:01,040
This was back in the day when there was the big debate between the Dreamcast and the PS2.

1899
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:07,640
People trying to decide what was better and this is basically a Dreamcast and a VMU talking

1900
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:09,480
to a PlayStation 2.

1901
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:11,160
Was this an actual commercial on TV or what was it?

1902
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:15,000
No, this is just a fan video and it was on some site a long time ago but a bunch of people

1903
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:21,720
have re-uploaded it but the PS2 was the one with the really snooty voice and the Dreamcast

1904
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:27,040
is like the regular, you know, talking guy and the VMU is the one that goes, what a disappointment.

1905
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,720
I'm hoping this isn't going to buffer like crazy because our net's running kind of slow.

1906
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:31,720
I don't think it will.

1907
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:32,720
We'll see.

1908
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:33,720
We'll see what happens.

1909
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:34,720
Hey, PS2.

1910
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:35,720
Yes?

1911
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:38,200
Me and the VMU were watching you play Ridge Racer 5.

1912
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,200
Oh, really?

1913
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:41,400
Yeah, and we thought it looked really good.

1914
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,960
Ah, thank you.

1915
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,960
Yeah, it looks good.

1916
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:46,960
For us to poop on.

1917
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:54,600
Look me if you must but keep in mind that I am powered by the 128-bit emotion engine.

1918
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:57,960
Yeah, the only emotion you're giving developers is frustration.

1919
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:01,680
They'd rather be programming on a Saturn.

1920
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:02,680
What a disappointment.

1921
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:07,880
Only top notch Japanese development studios can obtain optimum results from my hardware.

1922
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:11,720
Yeah, then how come Dead or Alive 2 looks better running on me than on you?

1923
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:12,720
What a disappointment.

1924
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:17,120
Oh, but surely you've witnessed the raw beauty that has Tekken tagged tournament.

1925
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:20,800
Yeah, a game that looks like Tekken 3 running in enhanced mode.

1926
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:21,800
What a disappointment.

1927
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:22,800
Oh, I say.

1928
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:27,040
Do you actually believe your crappy lineup can compete with Jet Set Radio, Grandia 2,

1929
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:31,920
Echo the Dolphin, Metropolis Street Racer, Furballs, NFL 2001, Eternal Arcadia, somebody

1930
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:33,600
amigo on Sonic Adventure 2?

1931
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:34,600
Oh, yeah?

1932
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:38,600
Well, all that Namco thinks you can handle is Mr. Trio.

1933
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:39,600
Hey, hey, hey.

1934
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:40,600
You want to go?

1935
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:41,600
You want something else?

1936
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,320
You like it, I do.

1937
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:44,320
**** you.

1938
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:45,320
**** you.

1939
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:46,320
**** you.

1940
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:47,320
**** you.

1941
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:48,320
Come on, come on.

1942
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:49,320
Come on, come on.

1943
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:50,320
Come on, come on.

1944
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,320
Come on.

1945
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:57,100
The dumbest thing I've ever seen.

1946
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:59,520
I have had enough of you.

1947
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,520
You're last.

1948
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:06,280
The Internet thanks you for blowing on their speakers.

1949
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:07,280
Good job.

1950
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,840
What a disappointment.

1951
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:10,840
That was great.

1952
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:17,160
that little video search that was from user kohan69 on youtube kohn69

1953
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,160
I'm going to post it in the chatroom again. It's funny.
