1
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:19,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, September 9th, 2007, Laird's Hot Coffee Mode is found, but it's not what you think.

2
00:00:19,851 --> 00:00:25,596
[SPEAKER_00]: HD DVD gets a price cut in Europe, and a third-party company has something to say about PlayStation's marketing.

3
00:00:32,267 --> 00:00:36,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:36,349 --> 00:00:45,252
[SPEAKER_08]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer lifestyle and gamer culture.

5
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,793
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll teach me to say so damn much during the introduction.

6
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:52,175
[SPEAKER_08]: That voice you hear taunting behind me is the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:52,475 --> 00:00:52,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

8
00:00:53,255 --> 00:00:56,957
[SPEAKER_08]: And my name is Rob Roberts and joining me as well, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

9
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

10
00:00:57,997 --> 00:00:58,918
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing, Jamie?

11
00:00:58,938 --> 00:00:59,578
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing tonight?

12
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:01,252
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a soda.

13
00:01:01,513 --> 00:01:02,273
[SPEAKER_08]: You has a soda?

14
00:01:02,293 --> 00:01:03,434
[SPEAKER_10]: I has a soda.

15
00:01:03,534 --> 00:01:04,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it delicious?

16
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:05,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Not really.

17
00:01:05,575 --> 00:01:05,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really?

18
00:01:06,195 --> 00:01:07,296
[SPEAKER_08]: You're very quiet tonight.

19
00:01:07,316 --> 00:01:08,557
[SPEAKER_08]: You seem kind of timid.

20
00:01:09,057 --> 00:01:09,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Is everything okay?

21
00:01:10,818 --> 00:01:11,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I just ate.

22
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:12,739
[SPEAKER_08]: You just ate?

23
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:14,080
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're very well satiated?

24
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,123
[SPEAKER_11]: I was getting into uber bitch mode because I didn't eat and then I ate and I ate too much.

25
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:27,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I should say something before we get to the rest of the show is that we are taking new pictures tonight, which I'm hoping you guys will see the results of in our album.

26
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:29,155
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't talk tonight.

27
00:01:29,195 --> 00:01:29,915
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell's wrong with me?

28
00:01:30,195 --> 00:01:35,198
[SPEAKER_08]: In our album artwork that you'll be seeing for episode 250, at least a little later on.

29
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,079
[SPEAKER_08]: And Jamie got to eat.

30
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Weren't you eating a Pikachu?

31
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:40,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Or was that?

32
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:43,062
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you were squishing a Pikachu, pretending to eat a Pikachu.

33
00:01:43,142 --> 00:01:44,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I ate my cell phone.

34
00:01:44,983 --> 00:01:45,843
[SPEAKER_08]: You ate your cell phone.

35
00:01:45,963 --> 00:01:46,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it delicious?

36
00:01:46,944 --> 00:01:47,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

37
00:01:47,444 --> 00:01:48,665
[SPEAKER_02]: It tasted like Samsung.

38
00:01:49,065 --> 00:01:49,505
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

39
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:50,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Wonderful.

40
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:51,261
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

41
00:01:51,822 --> 00:01:54,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, also joining us tonight, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

42
00:01:55,224 --> 00:01:56,566
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already said hello, but yes.

43
00:01:56,726 --> 00:01:57,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.

44
00:01:57,266 --> 00:01:57,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

45
00:01:57,927 --> 00:01:58,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hi again.

46
00:01:58,567 --> 00:01:58,928
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?

47
00:01:59,328 --> 00:01:59,868
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing fine.

48
00:02:00,249 --> 00:02:00,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

49
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:01,189
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

50
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:06,114
[SPEAKER_08]: And also say hello to our chat room, which is available at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

51
00:02:06,674 --> 00:02:11,218
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can also say hello to Gay Eddie, who's here tonight joining us on the show.

52
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that'd be Casper the Gay.

53
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,542
[SPEAKER_04]: You just always call me Gay Eddie because you're a douche.

55
00:02:16,698 --> 00:02:18,259
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what else to call you, I'm sorry.

56
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:26,904
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're going to start off with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week, and we'll come back to you and fill in a little more for the folks that may not know you, because you haven't been on the show in a long time.

57
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:29,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Has it really been six months?

58
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:31,647
[SPEAKER_08]: You could have had a baby since the last time.

59
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:34,349
[SPEAKER_08]: See, maybe you had a baby, and we'll find that out.

60
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:36,030
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we'll start with Dark Sakura.

61
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,910
[SPEAKER_08]: How was your gaming week?

62
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about video games.

63
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:39,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of pinball.

64
00:02:39,472 --> 00:02:41,553
[SPEAKER_02]: We sold the whodunit, finally.

65
00:02:42,253 --> 00:02:43,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I liked whodunit.

66
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but we can get a much better one than the one that we had.

67
00:02:46,903 --> 00:02:48,264
[SPEAKER_02]: We're babysitting some machines.

68
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:55,672
[SPEAKER_02]: We're babysitting a Back to the Future, which Back to the Future sucks because Michael J. Fox wouldn't let his likeness be used in the game.

69
00:02:56,512 --> 00:02:58,434
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has somebody who completely doesn't look like him.

70
00:02:58,995 --> 00:02:59,275
[SPEAKER_00]: What a bastard.

71
00:02:59,295 --> 00:03:00,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the sound files.

72
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:03,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it's either him or his agent or something.

73
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,344
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we got a Time Machine, which is one of my favorite older pens.

74
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:09,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Project Gotham Racing 3 Land 5 360s

75
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,924
[SPEAKER_07]: But one of them does not want to land.

76
00:03:41,405 --> 00:03:42,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why.

77
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:45,545
[SPEAKER_07]: It will land other games, but it just doesn't like Project Gotham Racing 3.

78
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:47,166
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

79
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,506
[SPEAKER_07]: So we played four players with that.

80
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:53,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Luckily that day there was someone missing, so it worked out.

81
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Then Saints Row multiplayer, also via System Link.

82
00:03:56,688 --> 00:04:00,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear, you know, there's just not enough support for System Link.

83
00:04:00,588 --> 00:04:01,049
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sad.

84
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:05,910
[SPEAKER_07]: But hopefully we'll get live soon at work and then be able to play anything.

85
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, other things I played...

86
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:35,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Bioshock, more of that I'm actually a little bit more into it now I forget where the hell I'm at but it's still been very good so definitely looking forward to playing more of that game and then let's see I tried a little bit more stuff on 360 I actually downloaded the full version of Worms and well it's Worms so can't really say too much on that and let's see what else did I try out um

87
00:04:37,603 --> 00:04:47,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Also on the PSP, I found a... Someone had dumped a version of Sega Rally on there that's not out yet, but it's actually very awesome.

88
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Sega Rally Revo, I know it's going to be on most other systems.

89
00:04:52,113 --> 00:04:57,096
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're just dropping the Revo part for the PSP version, though, but it's cool.

90
00:04:57,296 --> 00:05:00,438
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very awesome if you've played Sega Rally in the arcades exactly like that.

91
00:05:00,936 --> 00:05:02,198
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it looks good, too.

92
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:03,901
[SPEAKER_07]: So, really recommend that one.

93
00:05:04,962 --> 00:05:05,743
[SPEAKER_07]: And... Oh!

94
00:05:06,064 --> 00:05:06,765
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost forgot!

95
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,489
[SPEAKER_07]: On 360, play FlatOut Ultimate Carnage.

96
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking love this game.

97
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:14,256
[SPEAKER_07]: This game right now, I think, best racing game of the year.

98
00:05:14,977 --> 00:05:15,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Hands down.

99
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,231
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a pretty hefty title.

100
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:19,132
[SPEAKER_07]: It is, and it's fucking fun.

101
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:23,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Flat out, I used to love the game, first off, because you can crash into things.

102
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:32,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the first game really pissed me off, because when you'd crash into objects on the track, you would kind of get stuck on them, and that kind of sucked.

103
00:05:32,682 --> 00:05:42,770
[SPEAKER_07]: But, they went back, fixed all that shit, now there's like 6,000 things on the track to crash into, and you see all of them all strewn about on the track.

104
00:05:43,257 --> 00:05:45,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Ultimate Carnage, Destruction Derby, Ragdoll Olympics

105
00:06:12,145 --> 00:06:14,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely check out FlatOut Ultimate Carnage.

106
00:06:30,603 --> 00:06:33,864
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically, but FlatOut is a completely different game.

107
00:06:34,284 --> 00:06:38,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Their thing is the fact that you can crash into a bunch of different objects on the course.

108
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:40,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Burnout doesn't really have that.

109
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:44,007
[SPEAKER_07]: It's mainly just crashing into the cars and exploding and stuff like that.

110
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:48,388
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a different type of game, but I really recommend checking it out.

111
00:06:49,288 --> 00:06:49,909
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty awesome.

112
00:06:49,929 --> 00:06:53,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I played the demo for a good half an hour at least, and probably will play it a little bit more until it comes out.

113
00:06:55,512 --> 00:06:55,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Worms 2 Open Warfare

114
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:24,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Only on this show would saying you're a whore for worms actually make sense.

115
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:27,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you imagine if I walked up to just a random person on a street?

116
00:07:27,173 --> 00:07:28,673
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a whore for worms!

117
00:07:28,693 --> 00:07:30,514
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a worm whore!

118
00:07:30,974 --> 00:07:32,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless they liked worms.

119
00:07:32,814 --> 00:07:33,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Or were fishermen.

120
00:07:34,015 --> 00:07:36,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think there are such things like worm fetish?

121
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:36,775
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really gross.

122
00:07:37,135 --> 00:07:37,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably.

123
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,116
[SPEAKER_08]: There's sick people in the world.

124
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:40,256
[SPEAKER_07]: There's fetishes for everything.

125
00:07:40,716 --> 00:07:41,577
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what they say.

126
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:42,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously?

127
00:07:42,277 --> 00:07:44,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have anybody in the chatroom with worm fetish?

128
00:07:44,957 --> 00:07:47,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody in the chatroom is talking about their gaming weeks.

129
00:07:47,078 --> 00:07:47,278
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't...

130
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:48,700
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

131
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Eh, that's pretty old.

132
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:06,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, 1942 and Lode Runner.

133
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:10,853
[SPEAKER_07]: But, and Kaboom, on this Activision's hit remix, which sucks.

134
00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:11,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Kaboom is awesome.

135
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:13,974
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about Kunio games earlier.

136
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:17,576
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I just didn't like the Activision hits remixed on the PSP.

137
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:18,276
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just...

138
00:08:19,073 --> 00:08:19,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

139
00:08:19,634 --> 00:08:22,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, but isn't that the only system they put it out on is the remixed ones?

140
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Like all the souped up titles?

141
00:08:23,977 --> 00:08:25,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they weren't really souped up.

142
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,699
[SPEAKER_07]: These were just the standard games.

143
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

144
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:34,225
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the Atari Classics one that's going to be redone with the ones that they had on Xbox Live Arcade.

145
00:08:34,545 --> 00:08:35,566
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just the old one.

146
00:08:35,626 --> 00:08:41,630
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a collection of 70-some Activision titles like Kaboom, Pitfall, Pitfall 2, etc.

147
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:43,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is okay.

148
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:46,674
[SPEAKER_07]: If you really want a collection of those old games, then great.

149
00:08:46,774 --> 00:08:47,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Pick that up.

150
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:48,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it's dirt cheap by now.

151
00:08:50,741 --> 00:08:51,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

152
00:08:51,161 --> 00:08:51,941
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not for me.

153
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:54,942
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not... I don't want to play it on that console.

154
00:08:55,523 --> 00:08:58,204
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100Mad is applauding you, Loki, in our chatroom.

155
00:08:58,264 --> 00:08:59,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki is really branching out.

156
00:08:59,564 --> 00:09:01,125
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought he was just an achievement point whore.

157
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:02,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I still am.

158
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,243
[SPEAKER_07]: I was playing Worms and I was getting achievements on that.

159
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:07,983
[SPEAKER_07]: What was I playing?

160
00:09:08,003 --> 00:09:08,784
[SPEAKER_07]: There was something else I was playing.

161
00:09:09,004 --> 00:09:10,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I played Mutant Storm Reloaded.

162
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:15,089
[SPEAKER_07]: I played that and I was getting some more achievements on that as well.

163
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:16,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, actually, no.

164
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,310
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking through my arcade games.

165
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:22,354
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I own like 40 arcade games and I don't have the high scores on any of them among my friends.

166
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:24,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, which one can I possibly get the high score on?

167
00:09:25,677 --> 00:09:30,000
[SPEAKER_07]: And I tried on Mutant Storm Reloaded and I just didn't have enough time to dedicate to it.

168
00:09:30,888 --> 00:09:32,849
[SPEAKER_07]: How many games am I whooping your ass on?

169
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

170
00:09:33,549 --> 00:09:36,229
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't play live arcade games that much, so probably a lot.

171
00:09:36,249 --> 00:09:36,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Just curious.

172
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:37,910
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

173
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,130
[SPEAKER_08]: All finished?

174
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm all finished.

175
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:40,791
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

176
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:44,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Call of Duty 4 multiplayer, the beta.

177
00:09:44,271 --> 00:09:44,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

178
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:45,272
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty awesome.

179
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:46,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you in it legally?

180
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:47,612
[SPEAKER_07]: I am in it legally.

181
00:09:47,832 --> 00:09:48,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, congratulations.

182
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:53,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there's a way people were getting on there illegally, but no, they actually put me in the first wave.

183
00:09:53,434 --> 00:09:54,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you allowed to talk about it?

184
00:09:55,092 --> 00:09:55,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck if I know.

185
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, let me put it this way.

186
00:09:57,254 --> 00:09:57,995
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Call of Duty.

187
00:09:58,035 --> 00:10:00,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, shit, they haven't really changed much since, you know, 2.

188
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,420
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's no modern day stuff.

189
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,301
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks awesome.

190
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:06,082
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

191
00:10:06,202 --> 00:10:12,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you want me to describe it for you, go play Call of Duty 3, but just imagine it's futuristic or modern day.

192
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:14,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's basically the same damn thing.

193
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:15,590
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good.

194
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, people are, like, loving this game.

195
00:10:17,832 --> 00:10:18,373
[SPEAKER_07]: It is good.

196
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:18,753
[SPEAKER_07]: It's...

197
00:10:19,673 --> 00:10:20,454
[SPEAKER_07]: CasperTheGay

198
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got Newtopia and Newtopia 2.

199
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:08,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, do you have Nootopia 2?

200
00:11:09,065 --> 00:11:10,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I have TurboGrafx.

201
00:11:10,806 --> 00:11:11,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, okay.

202
00:11:11,707 --> 00:11:14,269
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the thing about it is, it's a Zelda clone.

203
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:17,031
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like Zelda games, you'll like it for that old-school gameplay.

204
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:19,853
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's some reasons why Zelda was way more popular.

205
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:27,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like, for instance, if you bomb a cave or you bomb a wall in a dungeon, you have to re-bomb it the next time you go back in, which is a real pain in the ass.

206
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,859
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they get for being HuCard games.

207
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:29,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's horrible.

208
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:33,660
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you go into the cave or something, you automatically have to start talking to the person.

209
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,960
[SPEAKER_04]: You have no choice.

210
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:39,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if somebody's in a dungeon in a room, every time you pass through that room, you start talking to them again.

211
00:11:39,362 --> 00:11:40,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, ugh.

212
00:11:40,562 --> 00:11:41,222
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's still fun.

213
00:11:41,322 --> 00:11:41,822
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good stuff.

214
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:43,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, Hugh Card game.

215
00:11:45,123 --> 00:11:45,883
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's good times, though.

216
00:11:45,903 --> 00:11:46,723
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty much it.

217
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:51,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played any new stuff, so I want to play Metroid, the new one, so that looks pretty awesome.

218
00:11:53,565 --> 00:11:56,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Kick them off the TV watching Battlestar reruns and go play Metroid.

219
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:56,906
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.

220
00:11:57,726 --> 00:11:57,966
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

221
00:11:58,783 --> 00:11:59,023
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

222
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:04,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I got to talk about my gaming week and... Oh, hell.

223
00:12:04,453 --> 00:12:06,677
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I really want to say anything about my gaming week.

224
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,180
[SPEAKER_08]: I better brace myself.

225
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:11,225
[SPEAKER_08]: This week, I...

226
00:12:13,783 --> 00:12:17,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI

227
00:12:42,076 --> 00:12:43,077
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a camera on me.

228
00:12:44,739 --> 00:12:50,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I wanted to play something and I had codes that would make it so I could play for a month for free.

229
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:50,986
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was like, I'm going to do that.

230
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:55,291
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you got a free month on WoW and you're like, okay, I'll come play Final Fantasy XI.

231
00:12:55,932 --> 00:12:57,774
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we got two of our friends to play too.

232
00:12:58,775 --> 00:13:00,517
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're all just going back.

233
00:13:00,617 --> 00:13:01,518
[SPEAKER_09]: We're migrating back.

234
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:08,583
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing about it is that they've changed a lot since I've been gone, and I was kind of curious what all has changed.

235
00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:14,586
[SPEAKER_08]: And it does seem like they have fixed a lot of things that were pissing me off before, such as they got rid of a lot of the gold sellers.

236
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:16,868
[SPEAKER_08]: The economy seems to be a lot better than it was before.

237
00:13:16,888 --> 00:13:18,368
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like it's stabilized.

238
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:19,709
[SPEAKER_08]: The economy changes.

239
00:13:19,749 --> 00:13:21,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, seriously, the economy changes.

240
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,531
[SPEAKER_08]: It happens in a lot of MMOs.

241
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:28,574
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's the most hilarious part, and old-school OLR listeners will really get a kick out of this.

242
00:13:28,854 --> 00:13:30,195
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what server we're playing on?

243
00:13:31,296 --> 00:13:31,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Faerie.

244
00:13:32,642 --> 00:13:33,723
[SPEAKER_08]: The Fairy Server!

245
00:13:33,743 --> 00:13:36,005
[SPEAKER_08]: We're playing on the Fairy Server!

246
00:13:36,425 --> 00:13:37,826
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're pretending we're noobs.

247
00:13:38,006 --> 00:13:41,869
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to go back to like episode 80 to get these jokes when I was first getting into Final Fantasy XI.

248
00:13:41,909 --> 00:13:43,931
[SPEAKER_08]: But yes, we're playing on the Fairy Server.

249
00:13:43,951 --> 00:13:45,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember why we were pissed off at that chick.

250
00:13:45,752 --> 00:13:47,013
[SPEAKER_07]: What was it?

251
00:13:47,334 --> 00:13:47,694
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember.

252
00:13:47,714 --> 00:13:49,936
[SPEAKER_08]: It was something to do with live journal drama or something.

253
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:51,297
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to go back.

254
00:13:51,517 --> 00:13:52,758
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really fun though in...

255
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,632
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually having a really good time.

256
00:13:55,652 --> 00:13:58,014
[SPEAKER_09]: So am I. I keep leveling everything I can.

257
00:13:58,094 --> 00:14:03,598
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm wondering if it's one of those things where when I have to start partying in the dunes, if it's going to wear off real quick.

258
00:14:03,618 --> 00:14:04,619
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know what the dunes are.

259
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Give me my drink, Eddie.

260
00:14:07,401 --> 00:14:08,161
[SPEAKER_08]: This is great radio.

261
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:08,422
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

262
00:14:08,642 --> 00:14:09,823
[SPEAKER_09]: He's trying to steal my drink.

263
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,904
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know what the dunes are yet.

264
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:14,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, we're just low levels.

265
00:14:15,027 --> 00:14:15,447
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be there.

266
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,109
[SPEAKER_08]: We've never played before.

267
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,131
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking in the chat room to see what people are saying.

268
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:23,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Ghost Guy says Final Fantasy XI equals not so good.

269
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:27,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that person's name that you just read equals not so good.

270
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:31,834
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100Matt says, why isn't Jamie on top of Rob about this?

271
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:33,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Shane took her mic for one.

272
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:34,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I needed to talk to him to some point.

273
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be curious what Jamie's thoughts are on all of this.

274
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:37,640
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go watch what else.

275
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,281
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, bye.

276
00:14:39,301 --> 00:14:39,922
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care.

277
00:14:40,703 --> 00:14:43,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I thought you were going to call me an addict or yell at me or something.

278
00:14:43,485 --> 00:14:43,806
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

279
00:14:44,686 --> 00:14:44,907
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

280
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:46,108
[SPEAKER_02]: What you play is up to you.

281
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:47,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I like this.

282
00:14:47,163 --> 00:14:49,945
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the kinder, gentler Jamie than we had a few episodes ago.

283
00:14:49,965 --> 00:14:52,228
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is the indifferent, apathetic Jamie.

284
00:14:52,328 --> 00:14:52,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see.

285
00:14:52,908 --> 00:14:54,069
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the meh Jamie.

286
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:54,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

287
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:55,191
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

288
00:14:56,392 --> 00:14:56,832
[SPEAKER_08]: The meh.

289
00:14:57,473 --> 00:14:58,594
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think about that, Jamie?

290
00:14:58,834 --> 00:14:59,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Meh.

291
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:05,214
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't just play Final Fantasy XI, though, because I swear I'm going to limit my time on it this time around.

292
00:15:05,354 --> 00:15:07,095
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll let you guys know how long I actually stick with it.

293
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:10,418
[SPEAKER_08]: But I also was playing some more Blue Dragon and made some more progress on that.

294
00:15:10,438 --> 00:15:11,799
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm enjoying Blue Dragon.

295
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:17,824
[SPEAKER_08]: I realize the critics didn't exactly give it the best scores in the world, but I'm having a good time with it.

296
00:15:18,745 --> 00:15:20,266
[SPEAKER_08]: And then some stuff on Xbox Live Arcade.

297
00:15:20,306 --> 00:15:21,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, Fatal Fury Special.

298
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:22,748
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to give that a go.

299
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:26,351
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's the same game, basically, from the Neo Geo.

300
00:15:26,371 --> 00:15:28,753
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't really change anything, but that's okay, because Fatal Fury...

301
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:29,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Street Fighter is $10?

302
00:15:29,854 --> 00:15:31,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, I thought that virtual console games were expensive.

303
00:15:31,314 --> 00:15:31,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Not even Super Mario Bros.

304
00:15:55,411 --> 00:15:56,212
[SPEAKER_08]: or $5 for Metroid.

305
00:15:56,252 --> 00:15:57,472
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that stuff's expensive.

306
00:15:57,492 --> 00:15:59,773
[SPEAKER_07]: You should see the PlayStation Network game prices.

307
00:16:01,114 --> 00:16:05,476
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, granted, they're more full games, but we're talking like $40, $20.

308
00:16:10,138 --> 00:16:21,903
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say one other thing I've noticed about Final Fantasy XI is that it seems like there's a lot less OMG, WTF-type kids on there now, and I'm noticing there's a lot of older people that are getting into Final Fantasy XI.

309
00:16:22,403 --> 00:16:24,024
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of stay-at-home moms...

310
00:16:24,835 --> 00:16:25,615
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

311
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:55,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Run faster!

312
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where my discs are either.

313
00:16:56,841 --> 00:16:58,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie's thinking about coming back to Final Fantasy.

314
00:17:02,265 --> 00:17:03,465
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay, I only got to level 15.

315
00:17:05,814 --> 00:17:06,654
[SPEAKER_08]: She's thinking about it.

316
00:17:07,035 --> 00:17:08,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this is exciting news.

317
00:17:08,075 --> 00:17:09,796
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably actually going to quit World of Warcraft 2.

318
00:17:10,616 --> 00:17:11,637
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to quit MMOs.

319
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:12,797
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't quit World of Warcraft.

320
00:17:12,837 --> 00:17:13,377
[SPEAKER_08]: I should say that.

321
00:17:13,437 --> 00:17:18,179
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just that I have a free month because I got somebody else to play through the rewards program.

322
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:21,941
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is my month where I'm going to decide which one I'm going to stick with, if any.

323
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Because honestly, when I play MMOs... You should totally play World of Warcraft.

324
00:17:25,102 --> 00:17:25,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye!

325
00:17:25,743 --> 00:17:27,783
[SPEAKER_08]: It cuts into my console times.

326
00:17:28,544 --> 00:17:29,004
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll see.

327
00:17:29,244 --> 00:17:30,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try to play through Super Metroid.

328
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:32,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Super Metroid.

329
00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:33,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Good stuff.

330
00:17:34,384 --> 00:17:42,747
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been looking for a video capture card for the Mac so we can do Operator 11 stuff with the Super Metroid.

331
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:45,268
[SPEAKER_08]: We can do our live playthrough and have the video feed actually on it.

332
00:17:45,288 --> 00:17:46,548
[SPEAKER_08]: You actually have to do it this week.

333
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:47,448
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

334
00:17:47,528 --> 00:17:48,189
[SPEAKER_08]: We totally will.

335
00:17:48,209 --> 00:17:49,009
[SPEAKER_08]: I just need to get the card.

336
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:52,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been doing my show on Tuesday so we should do that instead of my show.

337
00:18:18,582 --> 00:18:21,864
[SPEAKER_08]: So keep an eye out on our page on Operator11.com.

338
00:18:21,924 --> 00:18:25,646
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure exactly how to get to our profile, but I can tell you our username is Orange Laundry.

339
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,827
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a really bad plug, huh?

340
00:18:27,187 --> 00:18:28,608
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really know how you get there.

341
00:18:28,628 --> 00:18:30,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Best plug ever.

342
00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:30,989
[SPEAKER_08]: But just find it.

343
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,250
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so there you go.

344
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:35,232
[SPEAKER_08]: And let's see.

345
00:18:35,272 --> 00:18:37,073
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really have a whole lot of other housekeeping.

346
00:18:37,093 --> 00:18:39,014
[SPEAKER_08]: I already talked about that we have new pictures coming.

347
00:18:39,074 --> 00:18:40,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I ate too much pizza.

348
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:41,115
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry to hear that.

349
00:18:41,576 --> 00:18:42,356
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually hungry.

350
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:43,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Eddie, you want to make another run to talk about?

351
00:18:44,097 --> 00:18:45,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want my breadsticks?

352
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, can I have some breadsticks?

353
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

354
00:18:47,451 --> 00:18:48,511
[SPEAKER_08]: I would heart you forever.

355
00:18:49,071 --> 00:18:49,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooray.

356
00:18:49,491 --> 00:18:52,733
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to eat breadsticks, and we're going to get into tonight's gaming news.

357
00:18:52,773 --> 00:18:53,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully, I'm not first.

358
00:18:54,573 --> 00:18:55,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Rob's first.

359
00:18:56,454 --> 00:18:56,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways.

360
00:18:56,754 --> 00:18:58,215
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm kidding.

361
00:18:58,935 --> 00:18:59,175
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

362
00:18:59,715 --> 00:19:05,898
[SPEAKER_07]: So, to start things off, let's talk about pathetic stuff, including how pathetic Lair was.

363
00:19:06,718 --> 00:19:13,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, personally, I haven't played it, so I don't know if it's pathetic, but based on people's reviews of it, you know, for example, IGN gave it a 4.9.

364
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:20,182
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say it's pretty pathetic, and I guess, you know, there are some control issues and stuff like that.

365
00:19:20,682 --> 00:19:30,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, to, I guess, help save face, Sony has figured, you know what, the reason why our game is getting bad scores is because reviewers just don't know how to review our game.

366
00:19:32,189 --> 00:19:33,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's never a good argument.

367
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,491
[SPEAKER_07]: So, what they did was they sent out...

368
00:19:36,403 --> 00:19:38,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Reviewers Guides for Lair.

369
00:19:38,884 --> 00:19:45,526
[SPEAKER_07]: They basically sent IGN a guide of how to review their game because they figure, oh, you're stupid and you don't know how to play our game.

370
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:49,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that really makes you look cool.

371
00:19:50,868 --> 00:20:01,052
[SPEAKER_07]: So, apparently six of the 21 pages of the guide are devoted to the game's controls and I guess it has, you know, like a fact or something in it.

372
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,533
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so retarded.

373
00:20:06,227 --> 00:20:08,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Ghost Guy in our chatroom says Lair is lame.

374
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:12,374
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

375
00:20:12,975 --> 00:20:14,857
[SPEAKER_08]: I will withhold judgment until I have a chance to play it.

376
00:20:14,977 --> 00:20:15,838
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked good, though.

377
00:20:15,878 --> 00:20:22,185
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked like the game that could save the PlayStation 3 from all this, you know, that people are saying at it.

378
00:20:22,686 --> 00:20:24,107
[SPEAKER_08]: So what went wrong, Loki?

379
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:25,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

380
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:27,393
[SPEAKER_07]: It just kind of sucked.

381
00:20:28,054 --> 00:20:28,414
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

382
00:20:28,774 --> 00:20:32,517
[SPEAKER_07]: I think one of the things was, first off, you had to use the motion controls.

383
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,860
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't just you can turn them off or it's optional.

384
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,941
[SPEAKER_07]: You had to use them.

385
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:38,762
[SPEAKER_07]: They were kind of floaty.

386
00:20:40,964 --> 00:20:43,306
[SPEAKER_07]: There was, I guess, some lag between certain things.

387
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:44,787
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

388
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,869
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a lot harder than people thought.

389
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:55,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. DeBucket in our chat room at chat.orangesoundsradio.com says, Lair is better on PSP via remote play.

390
00:20:58,487 --> 00:21:00,388
[SPEAKER_07]: You know... Gimmick.

391
00:21:00,768 --> 00:21:01,568
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I'm saying.

392
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:07,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, it's interesting that that gets brought up because it makes me think about the whole, like, DS Wii thing.

393
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Shouldn't we have seen something with that by now?

394
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I guess we have the Pokemon game, huh?

395
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:14,251
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess we do have a little bit of connectivity, but nothing to this extent.

396
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:15,992
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool, but here's the thing, though.

397
00:21:16,112 --> 00:21:26,134
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't want to get into other stories or anything, but I'm just saying, you know, the remote play isn't like... It's not like the DS thing with the Wii, where

398
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:32,473
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's actually being used as a controller, and it actually has an earface on there and menus and stuff.

399
00:21:32,593 --> 00:21:34,414
[SPEAKER_07]: It's different than what's on the screen.

400
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:37,395
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually, you know, kind of an accessory to the game.

401
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:43,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas remote play is, look, I can play this from, you know, Starbucks down the street.

402
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:46,120
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm playing my PlayStation 3 on my PSP.

403
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it doesn't work completely.

404
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:51,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Even that's kind of broken.

405
00:21:51,142 --> 00:21:54,424
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, sure, you can do it, but, you know, it's just like...

406
00:21:55,302 --> 00:21:55,963
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

407
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,960
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

408
00:22:42,466 --> 00:22:45,988
[SPEAKER_07]: So is this possibly just the beginning of more to come for the console?

409
00:22:46,308 --> 00:22:53,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember when they were shown off the console and they had the Formula 1 racing game and they were like, look, you can use your PSP as a rearview mirror.

410
00:22:55,311 --> 00:22:55,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

411
00:22:56,451 --> 00:22:57,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would you do that?

412
00:22:58,892 --> 00:23:03,274
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just going to set it on a stand next to you or something.

413
00:23:03,514 --> 00:23:07,736
[SPEAKER_07]: They have rearview mirrors on your car model in the game.

414
00:23:08,076 --> 00:23:10,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would you need to have it on a separate screen?

415
00:23:10,297 --> 00:23:11,157
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a gimmick.

416
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:12,505
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

417
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:47,558
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some other... When they were doing it at the GameCube, too, there was some cooler, like, connectivity with the Game Boy Advance because, like, when you were playing, I think it was one of the Metal Gear games, something like that, it was, like, your sonar, and it was, like, having your own cool, like, device, but in the game.

418
00:23:47,618 --> 00:23:48,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

419
00:23:48,098 --> 00:23:53,601
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a gimmick, but it was, like, practical, too, so... Oh, I... No, here's the thing.

420
00:23:53,762 --> 00:23:56,183
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason why they did that is so that you can make...

421
00:23:56,821 --> 00:23:58,583
[SPEAKER_08]: The Racing Game More Like Real Life.

422
00:23:59,183 --> 00:24:03,367
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, Mr. DeBucket in chat wants to point out, it was a tech demo, you dumbass.

423
00:24:03,447 --> 00:24:04,668
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't even in the game.

424
00:24:04,848 --> 00:24:05,829
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, that's what I'm saying.

425
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:06,790
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the tech demo.

426
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,831
[SPEAKER_08]: It was when they were first showing the PlayStation 3 on.

427
00:24:08,892 --> 00:24:13,796
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes it more like real life because what you do is you get a woman to sit next to you while you drive.

428
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's something I can throw at Rob right now?

429
00:24:15,557 --> 00:24:16,378
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not even finished.

430
00:24:16,738 --> 00:24:22,003
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have the PSP and the woman's watching and she's nagging about everything you're doing wrong.

431
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's something I can throw at Rob?

432
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:24,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me one of your Pikachus.

433
00:24:24,924 --> 00:24:26,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Throw one of these breadsticks.

434
00:24:26,586 --> 00:24:27,708
[SPEAKER_08]: These things will knock me out.

435
00:24:27,748 --> 00:24:28,629
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like rock solid.

436
00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:29,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, they're nasty.

437
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:34,335
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the Operator 11 people heard me banging it against the wall earlier.

438
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:35,156
[SPEAKER_08]: These things are tough.

439
00:24:35,697 --> 00:24:37,439
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, anyway, that's all I have to say.

440
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:39,141
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay, because Rob drives like Grand Moff.

441
00:24:39,862 --> 00:24:40,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

442
00:24:40,182 --> 00:24:41,223
[SPEAKER_02]: See?

443
00:24:41,464 --> 00:24:42,705
[SPEAKER_07]: You're criticizing my driving!

444
00:24:59,538 --> 00:25:04,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Then why even put some half-assed control system in there that you can play this thing remotely?

445
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:05,719
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stupid.

446
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:11,320
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like those people that use their media center extender to view the internet on their 360.

447
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,141
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stupid.

448
00:25:13,341 --> 00:25:14,181
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gimmicky.

449
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,501
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need to do that.

450
00:25:16,361 --> 00:25:19,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if you'd like to comment on Loki's rants, we always welcome your emails.

451
00:25:19,802 --> 00:25:25,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com No, that's Loki at... Send them directly to Loki.

452
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:26,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Send them to him.

453
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:27,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need them.

454
00:25:28,374 --> 00:25:33,118
[SPEAKER_08]: And while you're at it, sign him up for lots of Nigerian bank lotteries.

455
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,419
[SPEAKER_08]: I already get enough spam.

456
00:25:37,882 --> 00:25:41,404
[SPEAKER_08]: And Loki's definitely interested in anything you have on Viagra or Cialis.

457
00:25:41,845 --> 00:25:45,308
[SPEAKER_08]: I will forward all my email to you, Rob.

458
00:25:46,328 --> 00:25:47,750
[SPEAKER_02]: He also wants bigger breasts.

459
00:25:50,552 --> 00:25:51,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I'm done.

460
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,114
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I wanted to say about the connectivity.

461
00:25:53,587 --> 00:26:05,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know our favorite crayon eater was going around in his days at Sony saying that the PS3 was a computer and a multimedia whatever.

462
00:26:06,238 --> 00:26:08,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Kaz Hirai, who is now the man again.

463
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:15,836
[SPEAKER_02]: said, and I'm going to quote, I'd like to clearly say the PS3 is a game machine.

464
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:17,537
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing more than that.

465
00:26:17,637 --> 00:26:18,317
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it is not.

466
00:26:18,438 --> 00:26:22,320
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, all their commercials say computer entertainment system.

467
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,541
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fucking computer.

468
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:25,283
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it is not.

469
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:26,664
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Sony PlayStation.

470
00:26:26,884 --> 00:26:27,084
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

471
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,611
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a fucking computer.

472
00:26:29,651 --> 00:26:30,652
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been saying computer.

473
00:26:30,732 --> 00:26:37,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because your fucking computer does not sell does not mean that you have to start calling it a game machine now.

474
00:26:37,757 --> 00:26:38,698
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fucking computer.

475
00:26:38,778 --> 00:26:39,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Stick with it.

476
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:41,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Who turned Loki to 11 tonight?

477
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,220
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I want to know.

478
00:26:43,762 --> 00:26:45,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you just make 10 louder?

479
00:26:46,055 --> 00:26:46,876
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

480
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:07,970
[SPEAKER_08]: and many more.

481
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:36,440
[SPEAKER_08]: What makes the PlayStation 3 a little bit appealing as well?

482
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,003
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the one thing that has people more excited than anything about PlayStation 3?

483
00:27:40,703 --> 00:27:41,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Home.

484
00:27:41,584 --> 00:27:42,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Is home a game?

485
00:27:43,305 --> 00:27:45,406
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's kind of something outside the box.

486
00:27:45,827 --> 00:27:50,070
[SPEAKER_08]: So for them to go out and say a quote like this is a little bit like, huh?

487
00:27:51,098 --> 00:27:53,640
[SPEAKER_08]: But you're like the worst at being a game machine.

488
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,101
[SPEAKER_08]: You do everything else really good.

489
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:55,601
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

490
00:27:55,781 --> 00:27:56,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what?

491
00:27:56,221 --> 00:27:58,323
[SPEAKER_07]: People didn't care that you can load Linux on it.

492
00:27:58,363 --> 00:28:02,085
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why it's now a game system and not a fucking computer.

493
00:28:03,045 --> 00:28:05,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, okay, fine then.

494
00:28:05,327 --> 00:28:06,928
[SPEAKER_07]: $600 is too much for a game system.

495
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:11,891
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, $600 was cheap for a computer, too much for a game system.

496
00:28:12,071 --> 00:28:13,552
[SPEAKER_07]: So now it's too much for a game system.

497
00:28:15,413 --> 00:28:15,913
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's see.

498
00:28:16,213 --> 00:28:20,955
[SPEAKER_08]: SonOfDad says, PlayStation 3 right now is a cheap Blu-ray player, no more, no less.

499
00:28:21,696 --> 00:28:24,097
[SPEAKER_08]: There might be some Sony fans that disagree, but I don't know.

500
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:28,539
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I still have yet to buy a PlayStation 3 because, I have to admit, I feel kind of similar.

501
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:30,639
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing out there to play.

502
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Even, I mean...

503
00:28:33,135 --> 00:28:34,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Ratchet and Clank Future.

504
00:28:34,616 --> 00:28:35,577
[SPEAKER_08]: That looks pretty good.

505
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:36,959
[SPEAKER_08]: And Resistance was good.

506
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:41,042
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure when Final Fantasy XIII comes out, I'll be like, Hail Sony!

507
00:28:41,142 --> 00:28:42,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome into my house!

508
00:28:42,223 --> 00:28:43,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Hail PlayStation 3!

509
00:28:43,364 --> 00:28:43,865
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you!

510
00:28:44,005 --> 00:28:47,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then you'll have a lot of time to save up money when it comes out Spring 2009.

511
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:50,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the current release?

512
00:28:50,860 --> 00:29:00,502
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just guessing, because, you know, this shit... I mean, because it'll come out in Japan, you know, probably Christmas next year or something, and then we'll see it maybe spring or summer of 2009.

513
00:29:01,443 --> 00:29:02,083
[SPEAKER_07]: But don't worry!

514
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:02,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't worry!

515
00:29:02,823 --> 00:29:05,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Good games are coming to the PlayStation 3 someday.

516
00:29:06,624 --> 00:29:07,044
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

517
00:29:08,505 --> 00:29:09,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Jamie, for the quote.

518
00:29:09,805 --> 00:29:12,666
[SPEAKER_08]: It certainly livened up our show a little bit tonight.

519
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:13,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Meh.

520
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:16,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Except for you.

521
00:29:16,627 --> 00:29:17,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways...

522
00:29:20,709 --> 00:29:23,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so guess what?

523
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:26,950
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't talk about PSP Homebrew on the official Sony forums.

524
00:29:29,891 --> 00:29:32,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, surprise.

525
00:29:32,632 --> 00:29:36,252
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't talk about cracking their system on their own forums.

526
00:29:37,613 --> 00:29:38,833
[SPEAKER_07]: How dare they do that?

527
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:43,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm more concerned with the fact that it took them this long to ban that chat.

528
00:29:44,054 --> 00:29:44,274
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

529
00:29:45,438 --> 00:29:49,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, the PSP is only a game system.

530
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:50,562
[SPEAKER_07]: You shouldn't be doing other things on there.

531
00:29:50,602 --> 00:29:51,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up and read the story.

532
00:29:52,603 --> 00:30:02,231
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, if you talk about homebrew, you will be banned from Sony's official chatroom or forum.

533
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:03,492
[SPEAKER_07]: And guess what?

534
00:30:04,132 --> 00:30:05,713
[SPEAKER_07]: We ban you!

535
00:30:06,154 --> 00:30:14,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we're on the topic of homebrew, it should not be a surprise that with the PlayStation Slim coming out,

536
00:30:15,368 --> 00:30:16,329
[SPEAKER_07]: The PlayStation Portable Slim

537
00:30:37,955 --> 00:30:43,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I know I can say this, and it won't go anywhere, so nobody tell him, but I think I know what I'm going to get William for.

538
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,981
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm totally serious here.

539
00:30:45,001 --> 00:30:46,462
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I know what I'm going to get William for his birthday.

540
00:30:46,482 --> 00:30:47,723
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to get him a PSP Slim.

541
00:30:48,203 --> 00:30:51,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Because funny enough, William is a huge Sony fanboy.

542
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:53,107
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know what it is.

543
00:30:53,368 --> 00:31:00,713
[SPEAKER_08]: He doesn't even play a whole lot of video games, but every time we go into Best Buy, we'll be looking at MotorStorm or whatever, and he's always like, don't you want a PlayStation 3?

544
00:31:01,034 --> 00:31:01,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at it.

545
00:31:01,414 --> 00:31:02,034
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so beautiful.

546
00:31:02,075 --> 00:31:03,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you have a PlayStation 3 in your house?

547
00:31:03,336 --> 00:31:04,236
[SPEAKER_08]: You have another game system.

548
00:31:04,256 --> 00:31:05,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you get a PlayStation 3?

549
00:31:05,077 --> 00:31:06,358
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, are you going to buy me one?

550
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:07,299
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, no.

551
00:31:08,459 --> 00:31:35,915
[SPEAKER_08]: but I think he really wants a PSP so I'm going to get him one because he thinks they're cool but I'm going to get him the Slim because they're new and then I can go look it's a new toy too and I think he'll get a kick out of that so Sony fanboys who are pissed off at the show right now because we're knocking Sony I just thought I'd let you know they are still getting some of our money because I do think the PSP is pretty awesome now it was a slow start but then again the DS had a slow start too so what can you say well

552
00:31:36,863 --> 00:31:44,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, one thing, of course, that you can play on those PSPs is Lair, which goes back and forth, you know, with a little remote connectivity.

553
00:31:44,387 --> 00:31:46,728
[SPEAKER_08]: But yes, we have one more Lair story for you guys.

554
00:31:47,528 --> 00:31:51,671
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a brand new hot coffee mode that's been discovered inside Lair.

555
00:31:51,711 --> 00:31:55,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, there's a hot coffee mode, except it's not really what you think.

556
00:31:56,673 --> 00:32:00,335
[SPEAKER_08]: If you actually watch the video of the hot coffee mode...

557
00:32:00,891 --> 00:32:09,815
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually just something you unlock where somebody brews a pot of hot coffee.

558
00:32:10,515 --> 00:32:17,879
[SPEAKER_08]: All you have to do is enter in this big long string at the cheat menu and you'll be welcomed with this video of somebody making hot coffee.

559
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,520
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best joke ever.

560
00:32:21,741 --> 00:32:24,482
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of stupid, but it's stupid funny.

561
00:32:25,262 --> 00:32:27,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a Jim Carrey movie, it's stupid funny.

562
00:32:28,184 --> 00:32:29,004
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

563
00:32:29,471 --> 00:32:38,553
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, that code that you can enter in, 686-F7-420-636-F66666565.

564
00:32:39,154 --> 00:32:42,734
[SPEAKER_08]: If you missed any part of this show and need a transcription, get out a pen next time.

565
00:32:42,774 --> 00:32:43,215
[SPEAKER_07]: And guess what?

566
00:32:43,235 --> 00:32:48,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Those also happen to be the reviews that this game got as well.

567
00:32:50,016 --> 00:32:51,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job, Loki.

568
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:56,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Just as I was reminded in the chat room, though, the

569
00:32:57,028 --> 00:33:11,037
[SPEAKER_07]: PSP is, I guess, they've already cracked the firmware and they're going to be releasing a, I guess, Team M33 is going to be releasing a CFW 3.6 firmware for it.

570
00:33:14,139 --> 00:33:16,340
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one of the better jokes we've had in a while on this program.

571
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job, Loki.

572
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:20,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, chatroom, now you two get to beat that one into the ground.

573
00:33:21,443 --> 00:33:23,444
[SPEAKER_02]: So, some news for our UK listeners.

574
00:33:23,765 --> 00:33:26,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega's got some dates out for some of their stuff.

581
00:33:56,107 --> 00:33:59,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Hitstun asks, do they get Virtua Fighter 5 360 before we do?

582
00:33:59,928 --> 00:34:01,529
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure.

583
00:34:02,989 --> 00:34:03,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably about the same week, right?

584
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,410
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting the last week of October.

585
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:06,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

586
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:14,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's go to some release dates and travel the world and see what's coming out right now in all different places, not just from Sega.

587
00:34:14,914 --> 00:34:16,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.

588
00:34:16,274 --> 00:34:17,835
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, this week's actually pretty good.

589
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:23,717
[SPEAKER_07]: We're starting to get into some of the better stuff, you know, fourth quarter stuff for all systems.

590
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:34,114
[SPEAKER_07]: and I know next week, well, I'm not a huge fan of it, but NHL 08 and NHL 2K8 are both coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and 360.

00:34:44,121 --> 00:34:44,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

593
00:34:46,183 --> 00:34:46,623
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

00:34:48,944 --> 00:34:53,888

598
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:35,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Guilty Gear XX Accent Core on PlayStation 2, that should make a lot of import fans happy.

599
00:35:36,527 --> 00:35:37,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see then, also...

600
00:35:39,197 --> 00:35:45,678
[SPEAKER_07]: On 360, you will be getting the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Game of the Year Edition.

601
00:35:45,758 --> 00:35:50,599
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be including both the expansion, I believe, and some of the download content for that.

602
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:56,600
[SPEAKER_08]: In other words, this is the release that fucks you all over who bought the game originally at full price and then all the expansions at full price.

603
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,441
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want the PlayStation 3 one, guess what?

604
00:35:58,481 --> 00:35:59,201
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not coming out.

605
00:35:59,261 --> 00:35:59,901
[SPEAKER_07]: It got delayed.

606
00:36:00,481 --> 00:36:06,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Fatal Inertia is also coming out on 360 next week, as well as Kengo, Legend of the Nine.

607
00:36:07,604 --> 00:36:35,472
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's see, then also on the Wii, Big Fat Nothin' On PC, of course, Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, the Game of the Year edition Democracy, apparently we're getting Democracy on September 11th, how appropriate And some crappy Sherlock Holmes game, that's interesting And then, of course, my favorite for the DS, Drawn to Life is coming out next week That looks really awesome

608
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:36,888
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that'd be cool.

609
00:36:37,048 --> 00:36:39,811
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, if you're a music game fan, Jam Sessions.

610
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:45,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually thinking about picking this up just because I need some guitar stuff in the mixes I do.

611
00:36:45,257 --> 00:36:46,919
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Jam Sessions.

612
00:36:48,427 --> 00:36:49,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

[SPEAKER_02]: Happiness Deluxe

615
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:43,362
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's even better, it's made by Marvelous Entertainment.

616
00:37:43,402 --> 00:37:43,903
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.

617
00:37:44,243 --> 00:37:45,263
[SPEAKER_11]: It's marvelously happy.

618
00:37:45,644 --> 00:37:48,425
[SPEAKER_08]: And Sega's putting out yet another Pachinko game.

619
00:37:48,925 --> 00:37:49,265
[SPEAKER_08]: No!

620
00:37:49,285 --> 00:37:54,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Tyson Pachinko, he's... Sakura Tyson is coming out.

621
00:37:55,008 --> 00:37:55,729
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I want to see?

622
00:37:55,809 --> 00:37:58,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, dude, they're doing a Sakura Tyson Pachinko?

623
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,871
[SPEAKER_07]: They should have a Pachinko Xbox Live Arcade game.

624
00:38:01,591 --> 00:38:02,112
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be funny.

625
00:38:02,392 --> 00:38:03,452
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be actually pretty rad.

626
00:38:03,472 --> 00:38:04,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be pretty great.

627
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,220
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

628
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:32,744
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Dolphin!

629
00:38:32,924 --> 00:38:34,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming to the Nintendo DS.

630
00:38:34,565 --> 00:38:35,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Dolphin safe.

631
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:36,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know they make a vibrator for the Dolphin?

632
00:38:37,028 --> 00:38:40,691
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, some Pokemon games and SimCity DS, you know, blah blah blah.

633
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:42,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I can't forget the PSP.

634
00:38:42,272 --> 00:38:43,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see if there's anything on the PSP worth mentioning.

635
00:38:44,214 --> 00:38:44,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Crap!

636
00:38:44,814 --> 00:38:45,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Crisis Core!

637
00:38:46,236 --> 00:38:47,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Shit, I think there's a lot of people really excited about that.

638
00:38:48,037 --> 00:38:51,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Crisis Core also out on September 13th, as well as Fate Tiger Coliseum.

639
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:52,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh.

640
00:38:53,762 --> 00:38:54,122
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

641
00:38:54,983 --> 00:38:56,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are your release dates for Japan.

642
00:38:56,384 --> 00:38:57,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how about for our friends in the UK?

643
00:38:59,986 --> 00:39:17,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Blazing Angels Secret Missions of World War 2 CSI Three Dimensions of Murder Dungeons and Dragons Tactics for PSP Fatal Inertia on Xbox 360 Freshly Picked Tingles Rosy Rupeeland Hooray!

644
00:39:18,781 --> 00:39:20,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Freshly Picked Tingles, I love those!

645
00:39:22,264 --> 00:39:23,185
[SPEAKER_02]: That's on the DS.

646
00:39:23,605 --> 00:39:25,707
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope it never comes over here.

647
00:39:25,747 --> 00:39:26,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to import it.

648
00:39:27,748 --> 00:39:28,429
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be in English.

649
00:39:28,857 --> 00:39:32,079
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Heavenly... English, English.

650
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,840
[SPEAKER_02]: That means there'll be extra vowels.

651
00:39:36,781 --> 00:39:38,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Extra vowels make everything better.

652
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:51,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Heavenly Sword on PlayStation 3, Heroes of Mana, which we already have over here, MotoGP07, Sonic Rush Adventure on the 14th, Stranglehold, Super Paper Mario on Wii.

653
00:39:53,311 --> 00:39:53,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

654
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:53,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

655
00:39:54,873 --> 00:40:04,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Something you guys were talking about reminded me of one other thing that I really missed in Final Fantasy XI, and that was boss monsters with no vowels in their name.

656
00:40:04,677 --> 00:40:08,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, Xrrr, is the name of a dragon.

657
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:11,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Or no, I think there's a dragon you have to fight called Vrth.

658
00:40:15,735 --> 00:40:17,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times!

659
00:40:18,477 --> 00:40:23,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, as with most games, they've been getting updates and patches every now and then.

660
00:40:23,902 --> 00:40:31,489
[SPEAKER_07]: And one in particular that happened this last week was Bioshock got a title update to fix a few things.

661
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Just some minor stuff, I guess.

662
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:39,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Updates improve stability when loading autosaves, and overall game stability corrects audio during

663
00:40:40,878 --> 00:40:45,220
[SPEAKER_07]: and addresses AI behaviors regarding health stations.

664
00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:48,842
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of interesting.

665
00:40:48,942 --> 00:41:06,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Another interesting thing though is of course people picking apart the PC version found a couple of notations for Plasmid Pack 1 which is believed to be a download that's going to happen later on including some brand new plasmids that you'll be able to buy from the machines and whatnot.

666
00:41:06,691 --> 00:41:09,232
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully we'll see some download content a little bit later on

667
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,361
[SPEAKER_07]: But of course, nothing official yet.

668
00:41:15,663 --> 00:41:16,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

669
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:18,345
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm choking on breath.

670
00:41:18,365 --> 00:41:21,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I just sounded like a murloc just then.

671
00:41:22,427 --> 00:41:23,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, keep talking.

672
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:24,548
[SPEAKER_08]: It's rude of me to talk with my mouth full.

673
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:27,150
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be awesome.

674
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:28,951
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking forward to some new plasmids.

675
00:41:31,012 --> 00:41:32,033
[SPEAKER_02]: You like new plasma?

676
00:41:32,993 --> 00:41:33,774
[SPEAKER_07]: New plasmids.

677
00:41:33,974 --> 00:41:35,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought you said plasma.

678
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, there's people who recycle their plasma.

679
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:39,590
[SPEAKER_07]: No, new plasmids for the game.

680
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:40,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this show.

681
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:44,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you know what you should check out if you dig that Drawn to Life?

682
00:41:44,332 --> 00:41:53,115
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a game that nobody knows about for GameCube called Monster Island, where you could basically create your own monsters, draw them out on a screen, and then play them in various competitions.

683
00:41:53,155 --> 00:41:53,795
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very cool.

684
00:41:53,835 --> 00:41:54,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't that like Magic Penjel?

685
00:41:54,936 --> 00:41:58,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they had Magic Penjel, and they had Graffiti Kingdom that were also the same type of thing.

686
00:41:58,217 --> 00:41:59,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was cool, though.

687
00:41:59,097 --> 00:42:00,618
[SPEAKER_04]: It was good times, if you like that kind of thing.

688
00:42:00,758 --> 00:42:07,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Magic Penjel, I had a 2DX system that was fighting, and we also had poppin' music, and

689
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:11,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I think people drew a penis monster as well.

690
00:42:12,251 --> 00:42:13,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Penis monster was great.

691
00:42:13,951 --> 00:42:15,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I really have to say the penis monster was good.

692
00:42:16,372 --> 00:42:21,193
[SPEAKER_02]: My character... That's, you know, some people don't like that.

693
00:42:21,213 --> 00:42:22,913
[SPEAKER_07]: The game is easy to exploit, though.

694
00:42:22,953 --> 00:42:30,715
[SPEAKER_07]: My character was just like a teddy bear, and I'd draw this big square that would be attached to it, and it'd be all blue, which would give you more magic attack or something.

695
00:42:30,735 --> 00:42:33,176
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the attack of the penis monster?

696
00:42:33,836 --> 00:42:34,916
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd poke it.

697
00:42:38,351 --> 00:42:41,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it have a similar attack as to a squid?

698
00:42:42,153 --> 00:42:44,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what happened when you poked it?

699
00:42:44,234 --> 00:42:45,915
[SPEAKER_02]: It would just sit and hunch over.

700
00:42:47,376 --> 00:42:49,657
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because you weren't doing it right.

701
00:42:49,937 --> 00:43:01,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoever drew the penis monster, it thought that the hair that someone drew on the testicles was actually legs.

702
00:43:01,104 --> 00:43:03,325
[SPEAKER_07]: So it would walk around on legs of this giant thing.

703
00:43:04,546 --> 00:43:07,047
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the worst Pokemon type game ever.

704
00:43:09,158 --> 00:43:12,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that is something we need for fucking Operator 11.

705
00:43:13,562 --> 00:43:18,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, too bad the cam just shut off on Op 11 like five minutes ago because we got booted out from time feeds.

706
00:43:18,147 --> 00:43:20,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we can only do 40 minute shows on there, but whatever.

707
00:43:20,269 --> 00:43:22,772
[SPEAKER_08]: What was I going to say?

708
00:43:23,272 --> 00:43:28,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, Jason, Webmaster Jason, remind me to mark this episode explicit, please, a little later.

709
00:43:29,598 --> 00:43:30,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

710
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:40,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously though, if you can find Magic Pendulum or even better, Graffiti Kingdom, that game is really fun, especially... For five minutes.

711
00:43:40,835 --> 00:43:42,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's not fun for five minutes.

712
00:43:42,836 --> 00:43:49,399
[SPEAKER_07]: You get your friends over and you're like, you can draw your own characters and give them just time and eventually something perverted is going to come out of it.

713
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:52,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we tried to draw a vagina monster so they could fight, but we ran out of ink.

714
00:43:57,323 --> 00:43:59,064
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we got the... Never mind.

715
00:43:59,104 --> 00:44:02,226
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to get into female anatomy, but probably I shouldn't do that.

716
00:44:03,326 --> 00:44:04,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, what was I going to say?

717
00:44:05,927 --> 00:44:07,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. DeBucket says Wangzilla for the win.

718
00:44:08,549 --> 00:44:10,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, oh, I like this quote from Mr. DeBucket.

719
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:13,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't every GameCube game a game for GameCube that no one knows about?

720
00:44:14,593 --> 00:44:14,793
Aww.

721
00:44:16,414 --> 00:44:16,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Touche.

722
00:44:17,055 --> 00:44:20,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Drew Nami says, I think I still have a save file with the penis monster.

723
00:44:21,298 --> 00:44:24,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right, because that was the day that we had Paper Plate Battle Royale.

724
00:44:26,201 --> 00:44:31,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Son of Dad is thinking that the movie Superbad, the end credits, is suddenly reminding him of our discussion right now.

725
00:44:32,864 --> 00:44:38,308
[SPEAKER_08]: so go figure anyhow moving from Penis Monster back to Bioshock

726
00:44:41,815 --> 00:44:43,136
[SPEAKER_08]: God, what can I say about this?

727
00:44:43,176 --> 00:44:51,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, somebody posted on the 2K forums about that basically his brother and him were trying to play the game Bioshock together.

728
00:44:51,465 --> 00:44:57,471
[SPEAKER_08]: But the game wouldn't let him because, as you may know, Bioshock on the PC only limits you to activate your account so many times.

729
00:44:57,771 --> 00:45:00,314
[SPEAKER_08]: You only get like five activations for the game and then that's it.

730
00:45:00,354 --> 00:45:00,874
[SPEAKER_08]: You're cut off.

731
00:45:00,934 --> 00:45:01,275
[SPEAKER_08]: No more.

732
00:45:01,655 --> 00:45:04,077
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's been a very controversial maneuver.

733
00:45:04,117 --> 00:45:05,359
[SPEAKER_08]: But what happened, okay...

734
00:45:05,979 --> 00:45:14,473
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy named 2KTechJT responded, There's no other way to view this, is one user has purchased the game, not the whole family.

735
00:45:14,853 --> 00:45:16,876
[SPEAKER_08]: So why should your brother play for free?

736
00:45:17,778 --> 00:45:19,480
[SPEAKER_08]: To which everybody goes, um...

737
00:45:20,143 --> 00:45:22,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, hasn't it always been that way?

738
00:45:22,224 --> 00:45:31,687
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if you bring a traditional CD, let's say Xbox 360 or PlayStation 2 game home, and, you know, everybody gets to use that game, right?

739
00:45:32,047 --> 00:45:33,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, this is nothing normal.

740
00:45:33,407 --> 00:45:41,570
[SPEAKER_07]: If you buy a CD, everybody in the house... Or how about they, if he wants his brother to play, how about you just log into your brother's account on Windows and fucking play the game?

741
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:45,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of being a little whiny bitch about, I don't want to install it on mine!

742
00:45:45,771 --> 00:45:48,072
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a certain amount of, you know...

743
00:45:49,893 --> 00:45:52,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say that I don't let anybody else use my computer.

744
00:45:54,254 --> 00:45:57,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, stop being so fucking lazy and just do what you need to do.

745
00:46:18,672 --> 00:46:20,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

746
00:46:38,075 --> 00:46:42,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Please note that the forum moderator has been incorrectly quoted as a 2K employee.

747
00:46:42,739 --> 00:46:48,744
[SPEAKER_08]: The individual JT Tech 2K works for an outside tech support group and is not an employee of 2K.

748
00:46:49,184 --> 00:46:51,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, 2K is investigating the validity of the post.

749
00:46:56,311 --> 00:46:57,532
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

750
00:47:23,168 --> 00:47:25,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki from Orange Lounge Radio reminding you to think of the children.

751
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:25,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I'm done.

752
00:47:52,008 --> 00:47:53,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Think of how tasty they are.

753
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:31,495
[SPEAKER_02]: So for some news regarding, again, more information in the UK, it says that the sales for the Xbox 360 are up, actually have increased, and the PSP is having their worst week since launch.

754
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:34,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor Sony, baby.

755
00:48:37,168 --> 00:49:05,431
[SPEAKER_02]: but at any rate what they're claiming is responsible for the increase in Xbox 360 sales would be the Elite model and the other price reductions for the Premium and Core systems which are I guess making people really crazy about wanting them however with the upcoming launches for the Slim PSP on September 14th overseas people just still don't care

756
00:49:06,072 --> 00:49:10,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I was going to say, without sounding like an ass, I mean, this isn't like a fanboy or whatever.

757
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:16,400
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this news is only temporary because the Slims are coming out and because Christmas Hello is right around the corner.

758
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,221
[SPEAKER_08]: I still think people don't care.

759
00:49:17,241 --> 00:49:18,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Sales for everything are going to pick up.

760
00:49:19,282 --> 00:49:19,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we'll see.

761
00:49:21,464 --> 00:49:21,924
[SPEAKER_08]: We will see.

762
00:49:24,026 --> 00:49:25,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways.

763
00:49:26,508 --> 00:49:29,410
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the Xbox HD DVD...

764
00:49:30,356 --> 00:49:31,418
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

765
00:49:45,572 --> 00:49:47,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Get a little bit of a discount.

766
00:49:47,593 --> 00:49:56,138
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if it's going on over there as well, but I know over here, once you buy it, you do get a rebate for five free HD DVD movies.

767
00:49:56,238 --> 00:49:56,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuckers.

768
00:49:57,039 --> 00:49:58,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Not when I bought my HD DVD player.

769
00:49:59,040 --> 00:49:59,920
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I got?

770
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:01,061
[SPEAKER_07]: King Kong.

771
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:02,962
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still in the wrapping.

772
00:50:03,522 --> 00:50:04,383
[SPEAKER_07]: I just would like to point out.

773
00:50:05,223 --> 00:50:06,664
[SPEAKER_07]: You can also get Blu-ray players, too.

774
00:50:06,684 --> 00:50:07,705
[SPEAKER_07]: They're kind of doing the same thing.

775
00:50:08,665 --> 00:50:13,088
[SPEAKER_07]: They are desperate for people to adopt the next-gen video formats, but...

776
00:50:14,417 --> 00:50:15,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think they're feeling a little heat?

777
00:50:15,799 --> 00:50:22,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Because whether you want to say it's thanks to the PlayStation 3 or whatever, Blu-ray does seem to be pushing a little more of the market share.

778
00:50:25,117 --> 00:50:31,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but really, I mean, they're counting them as players, Blu-ray players, but really how many people are actually using them for Blu-ray?

779
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,979
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the thing, is there is no way of showing that.

780
00:50:33,999 --> 00:50:34,739
[SPEAKER_05]: If I had one, I would be.

781
00:50:35,019 --> 00:50:37,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, but there's no way of showing it.

782
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:45,542
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because, yeah, okay, I use mine for Blu-ray movies sometimes, but I can count on one hand how many times I've watched a Blu-ray movie on there.

783
00:50:45,562 --> 00:50:47,422
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's not a lot.

784
00:50:47,482 --> 00:50:49,163
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't use the system at all.

785
00:50:50,523 --> 00:50:54,684
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I bought an HD DVD player, I don't think I would use it any more than I'm using...

786
00:50:55,303 --> 00:50:57,684
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

787
00:50:57,964 --> 00:51:07,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Personally, I would not buy an add-on for the 360 for any sort of next-gen video format because at least with the PlayStation 3, if Blu-ray doesn't win out, big deal.

788
00:51:07,528 --> 00:51:08,708
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fucking game machine.

789
00:51:09,888 --> 00:51:11,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Computer, my mistake.

790
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:19,912
[SPEAKER_07]: And if, you know, say, HDTV doesn't win out, then you're stuck with this fucking external drive for, you know, you can't do anything with.

791
00:51:20,732 --> 00:51:22,133
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know.

792
00:51:24,045 --> 00:51:33,093
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, now one period of time when you're going to have to watch these movies on the HD DVD is a four-hour period between 2 a.m.

793
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:36,376
[SPEAKER_08]: tonight and 9 in the, or I'm sorry, it actually starts at 2 a.m.

794
00:51:36,416 --> 00:51:38,057
[SPEAKER_08]: tonight and runs to 6 a.m.

795
00:51:38,818 --> 00:51:40,620
[SPEAKER_08]: That's because Xbox Live is going to be down.

796
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:51,009
[SPEAKER_08]: So sorry, kids, you're going to have to hold off on yelling the N-word and the F-A-G-word at each other for four hours while the system is down because that's all people really do on Xbox Live.

797
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:58,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, by the way, I... So they call each other nice and fancy?

798
00:52:01,656 --> 00:52:04,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they call each other nice and fancy.

799
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:09,241
[SPEAKER_05]: See, you're not helping your hole.

800
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:12,844
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to call me Casper instead of Big Gay Eddie.

801
00:52:15,806 --> 00:52:16,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever, Rob.

802
00:52:16,506 --> 00:52:17,547
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just the big silly.

803
00:52:18,988 --> 00:52:21,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, guys, you just fragged me.

804
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:22,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't that fancy?

805
00:52:22,951 --> 00:52:23,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

806
00:52:25,794 --> 00:52:29,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, look at me, I'm on the ground now, all helpless and laid down.

807
00:52:29,557 --> 00:52:33,079
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be awful if someone violated me.

808
00:52:36,261 --> 00:52:40,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I see you're squatting over and over again above my pelvis.

809
00:52:40,844 --> 00:52:41,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that nice?

810
00:52:42,045 --> 00:52:43,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that fancy?

811
00:52:43,366 --> 00:52:46,868
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell is wrong with you, Eddie?

812
00:52:47,749 --> 00:52:50,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because you've been watching what I do on Saturday nights by myself.

813
00:52:51,791 --> 00:52:52,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't make fun of me.

814
00:52:58,338 --> 00:53:05,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderdog Harold says in our chatroom Snagglepuss is on Xbox Live

815
00:53:14,779 --> 00:53:16,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox Live is going to be down.

816
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:16,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Get over it.

817
00:53:16,701 --> 00:53:20,144
[SPEAKER_05]: By the time most of you downloaded the podcast, it's already done anyway.

818
00:53:20,484 --> 00:53:23,086
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've spent far too long on this useless story.

819
00:53:23,647 --> 00:53:25,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, please save the show.

820
00:53:25,348 --> 00:53:29,812
[SPEAKER_07]: I like how Ranma says, fag, fancy, articulate guys.

821
00:53:30,253 --> 00:53:34,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, who said that?

822
00:53:34,897 --> 00:53:35,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma.

823
00:53:35,377 --> 00:53:36,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma, you're the best.

824
00:53:36,478 --> 00:53:36,819
[SPEAKER_04]: You're awesome.

825
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you talking about a cigarette?

826
00:53:39,861 --> 00:53:41,643
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a fancy, articulate guy.

827
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:48,734
[SPEAKER_02]: So according to Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry... Man, they're old.

828
00:53:50,675 --> 00:53:51,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sorry.

829
00:53:51,816 --> 00:53:53,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Aerosmith is really awesome, don't get me wrong.

830
00:53:54,818 --> 00:54:00,381
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, I see really good pictures of all of them, and then I see really old pictures of all of them.

831
00:54:00,661 --> 00:54:02,282
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I look at Keith Richards and feel better.

832
00:54:02,923 --> 00:54:09,807
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, since they're working hand-in-hand with the folks behind Guitar Hero 4...

833
00:54:10,965 --> 00:54:18,189
[SPEAKER_02]: and they are going to be the the game is pretty much going to be Aerosmith Edition Guitar Hero.

834
00:54:18,449 --> 00:54:22,431
[SPEAKER_07]: So they told Aerosmith, yeah, it's all going to be about you.

835
00:54:22,912 --> 00:54:24,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally about you.

836
00:54:24,633 --> 00:54:25,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Please be in our game.

837
00:54:26,854 --> 00:54:32,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there will be other stuff, of course, but the hope is that the master tracks are Aerosmith, so that'd be cool.

838
00:54:34,178 --> 00:54:36,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I have a bad joke for you guys.

839
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:39,661
[SPEAKER_08]: What did Steven Tyler say about

840
00:54:39,946 --> 00:54:42,647
[SPEAKER_08]: when Activision asked him to be in the next Guitar Hero game.

841
00:54:44,068 --> 00:54:44,969
[SPEAKER_08]: What did he say?

842
00:54:49,811 --> 00:54:51,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that was... That's fancy talk.

843
00:54:54,593 --> 00:54:56,434
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty accurate as being crappy.

844
00:54:58,755 --> 00:55:01,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways... I think something was in the breadsticks at this point.

845
00:55:03,138 --> 00:55:05,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even eat the breadsticks, Rob, and I'm turning gay.

846
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:06,800
[SPEAKER_04]: You smelled them.

847
00:55:09,541 --> 00:55:09,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

848
00:55:10,399 --> 00:55:11,620
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

849
00:55:33,023 --> 00:55:40,829
[SPEAKER_07]: I was confirming with our boss that we need to do a road trip if they happen to be down here pretty soon.

850
00:55:40,909 --> 00:55:44,952
[SPEAKER_07]: So it looks like actually in the next couple weeks, the 23rd or 23rd, they're going to be in Sacramento.

851
00:55:44,992 --> 00:55:46,112
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll have to go check it out.

852
00:55:46,253 --> 00:55:48,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, are we going to go to the rock band show and have some fun?

853
00:55:49,155 --> 00:55:50,696
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm going to go see They Might Be Giants.

854
00:55:51,829 --> 00:55:53,350
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be here for three days.

855
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to see They Might Be Giants for three days?

856
00:55:55,492 --> 00:55:58,414
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm going to see them for one day, and that's about as much concert as I can stand.

857
00:55:58,734 --> 00:55:59,735
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a concert.

858
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:00,636
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a play the game.

859
00:56:00,676 --> 00:56:01,817
[SPEAKER_08]: You make your own concert.

860
00:56:01,837 --> 00:56:02,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, play the game.

861
00:56:02,678 --> 00:56:03,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

862
00:56:03,738 --> 00:56:04,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then no.

863
00:56:04,459 --> 00:56:05,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's what we do here on the show, Jamie.

864
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:07,641
[SPEAKER_08]: We talk about playing games, remember?

865
00:56:07,862 --> 00:56:08,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no.

866
00:56:11,297 --> 00:56:13,498
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, Loki, will you go to the Rock Band tour with me?

867
00:56:14,298 --> 00:56:14,938
[SPEAKER_07]: I will definitely go.

868
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:18,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if it's going to be with you, though, but I will try to make it out there.

869
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:18,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Gee, thanks.

870
00:56:18,919 --> 00:56:22,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, sorry, I don't know if I'm going to... Yeah, I'm definitely going to go.

871
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:23,020
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably won't go with you.

872
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:27,901
[SPEAKER_07]: I will make a trip out there with you, but I will also make a trip out there maybe with my work.

873
00:56:28,601 --> 00:56:33,202
[SPEAKER_07]: I will not, on either of those trips, be singing in the game.

874
00:56:33,543 --> 00:56:34,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck that shit.

875
00:56:34,963 --> 00:56:39,044
[SPEAKER_07]: If it comes down, well, all we got left is karaoke for you, I'll be like, fuck you, I'm leaving.

876
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:44,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I thought I heard somebody say that we're doing some type of concert for the thing.

877
00:56:44,213 --> 00:56:45,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.

878
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:46,475
[SPEAKER_07]: You're the concert.

879
00:56:46,495 --> 00:56:53,600
[SPEAKER_07]: They basically have this giant semi-truck and there's a stage that they have set up and you play a game.

880
00:56:54,381 --> 00:56:54,761
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

881
00:56:54,801 --> 00:56:55,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Screw you, Loki.

882
00:56:55,942 --> 00:56:57,023
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take Gay Eddie with me.

883
00:56:57,543 --> 00:56:58,424
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go do it.

884
00:56:58,604 --> 00:56:59,685
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go play the game.

885
00:56:59,705 --> 00:57:00,085
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

886
00:57:00,245 --> 00:57:00,666
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fine.

887
00:57:00,766 --> 00:57:01,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go.

888
00:57:01,206 --> 00:57:04,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, Rob, when you sing, it's nice and fancy.

889
00:57:05,469 --> 00:57:06,530
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be the fancy band.

890
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:10,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, we'll be the fancy band boys, oh my god.

891
00:57:12,944 --> 00:57:13,944
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's what you should be.

892
00:57:14,485 --> 00:57:17,487
[SPEAKER_07]: We are the fancy articulate guys.

893
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:20,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you're so silly, I love you so much.

894
00:57:23,071 --> 00:57:26,313
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, Sal, we're going to get hate mail.

895
00:57:26,333 --> 00:57:29,456
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I really am gay, so I don't hate gay people.

896
00:57:29,516 --> 00:57:31,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you really talk like that, that's cool, I don't care.

897
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:33,118
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just funny.

898
00:57:34,459 --> 00:57:35,520
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can film it.

899
00:57:38,729 --> 00:57:44,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, speaking of Rock Band, there's some new songs.

900
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:44,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

901
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:48,793
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one of the most horrible pictures I have ever seen on this computer.

902
00:57:48,813 --> 00:57:49,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that Courtney Love?

903
00:57:49,753 --> 00:57:50,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that Courtney Love?

904
00:57:52,475 --> 00:57:53,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it is.

905
00:57:53,535 --> 00:57:54,315
[SPEAKER_10]: That is Courtney Love.

906
00:57:54,335 --> 00:57:57,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, by the way, she'll be making an appearance in Rock Band, you should know.

907
00:57:57,897 --> 00:58:04,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Celebrity Skin by Hole will be in Rock Band, as well as the Yeah Yeah Yeah's Maps and the Pixies' Wave of Mutilation.

908
00:58:04,759 --> 00:58:05,980
[SPEAKER_08]: But very exciting to me.

909
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I love this song, Garbages, I Think I'm Paranoid.

910
00:58:08,701 --> 00:58:09,361
[SPEAKER_08]: The Pixies, that's cool.

911
00:58:34,267 --> 00:58:38,949
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, come on, who does not remember the video to Black Hole Sun back from the days when MTV was cool?

912
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:45,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, by the way, thank you to our live listeners tonight for choosing us over to those skanky awards shows that are going on in MTV right now.

913
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:46,573
[SPEAKER_11]: Back in the day?

914
00:58:46,613 --> 00:58:47,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Back in the day, yes.

915
00:58:48,314 --> 00:58:50,275
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my freshman year of college.

916
00:58:50,315 --> 00:58:51,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Back in the day.

917
00:58:52,096 --> 00:58:53,997
[SPEAKER_02]: How old are you?

918
00:58:54,017 --> 00:58:53,997
31.

919
00:58:56,538 --> 00:58:56,938
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

920
00:58:57,639 --> 00:59:00,840
[SPEAKER_08]: She's just a fabulously accessorized girl.

921
00:59:01,281 --> 00:59:02,101
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all she is.

922
00:59:03,653 --> 00:59:04,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.

923
00:59:04,973 --> 00:59:10,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, that's all I have to say on... Well, speaking of things from back in Rob's day, no, I'm kidding.

924
00:59:11,955 --> 00:59:18,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Band is also saying there will be 18 master recordings from the Grateful Dead as downloadable content.

925
00:59:19,216 --> 00:59:19,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that cool?

926
00:59:20,497 --> 00:59:22,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, gosh, I hope it has Keep On Truckin' in it.

927
00:59:22,937 --> 00:59:27,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Truckin' is one, Uncle John's Band, Touch of Grey, Sugar Magnolia, and Casey Jones.

928
00:59:28,018 --> 00:59:32,499
[SPEAKER_07]: And my best, or my favorite part about the whole thing is they still haven't announced what the price point's gonna be.

929
00:59:33,744 --> 00:59:36,426
[SPEAKER_07]: GhostGuyInOurTerms says Jamie is old?

930
00:59:36,466 --> 00:59:37,186
[SPEAKER_07]: She doesn't sound old.

931
00:59:50,851 --> 00:59:53,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you have to consider this guy's probably 15 or 16 or 18.

932
00:59:53,253 --> 00:59:55,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Bite my butt.

933
00:59:56,876 --> 00:59:57,977
[SPEAKER_08]: But you're young at heart.

934
00:59:58,117 --> 00:59:58,918
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all that matters.

935
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:03,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, the older I get, I realize 30 is not as old as you think.

936
01:00:04,503 --> 01:00:05,884
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember when I was 18.

937
01:00:05,964 --> 01:00:09,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to think that 30 was old because my mom had me really young.

938
01:00:09,787 --> 01:00:14,251
[SPEAKER_02]: So my mom was 30 when I was in high school.

939
01:00:14,871 --> 01:00:18,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my mom was 30 when I was in high school, and I thought 30 was old.

940
01:00:18,454 --> 01:00:18,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

941
01:00:19,744 --> 01:00:21,205
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I saw my friend's parents.

942
01:00:21,725 --> 01:00:23,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, is that your grandmother?

943
01:00:24,467 --> 01:00:29,030
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was in high school, my parents were like 60, so... I always thought that was so bizarre.

944
01:00:30,371 --> 01:00:31,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, my mom had me when she was 38.

945
01:00:32,673 --> 01:00:34,594
[SPEAKER_08]: So, like, my mom... My mom had me at 17.

946
01:00:34,754 --> 01:00:35,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

947
01:00:35,294 --> 01:00:36,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, wow, wow.

948
01:00:37,656 --> 01:00:40,538
[SPEAKER_08]: GhostGuy responded, I'm not gonna bite anyone's butt.

949
01:00:40,558 --> 01:00:44,240
[SPEAKER_08]: I love, I love our chat.

950
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:45,261
[SPEAKER_08]: That was GhostGuy.

951
01:00:47,822 --> 01:00:47,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

952
01:00:47,983 --> 01:00:48,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway...

953
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:53,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie's trying to figure out the whole bathroom situation.

954
01:00:53,382 --> 01:00:53,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, guys.

955
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:56,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we're listening to Jamie try to get in the bathroom.

956
01:00:56,464 --> 01:00:57,105
[SPEAKER_08]: She's yelling at it.

957
01:00:58,186 --> 01:01:00,167
[SPEAKER_04]: She came, she went out there and she's like, oh, somebody's in there.

958
01:01:00,187 --> 01:01:02,028
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm thinking, nobody's in there, but I wasn't going to tell her.

959
01:01:07,152 --> 01:01:07,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways.

960
01:01:07,753 --> 01:01:08,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Just be outside.

961
01:01:08,913 --> 01:01:17,840
[SPEAKER_07]: So, surprise, Guitar Hero 3 on the Wii is not going to have download content initially, but at least it will have online play.

962
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:18,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently,

963
01:01:20,032 --> 01:01:21,033
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

964
01:01:41,411 --> 01:01:42,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

965
01:02:10,774 --> 01:02:11,494
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stupid.

966
01:02:11,594 --> 01:02:12,174
[SPEAKER_07]: It really is.

967
01:02:12,355 --> 01:02:17,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Or just supporting... Or just supporting, you know, maybe additional storage or something.

968
01:02:17,976 --> 01:02:18,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Benstead?

969
01:02:18,616 --> 01:02:18,776
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

970
01:02:19,837 --> 01:02:21,437
[SPEAKER_07]: You can add memory cards to it.

971
01:02:21,497 --> 01:02:24,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for saving your save games, but not for anything else.

972
01:02:25,218 --> 01:02:25,659
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

973
01:02:25,819 --> 01:02:28,639
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just for save games and maybe virtual console titles and that.

974
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:33,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I mean, they can't, like, design it so that when you download content that it would go into the memory card?

975
01:02:33,821 --> 01:02:34,261
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

976
01:02:34,281 --> 01:02:36,462
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't seem like it'd be that hard for them to design it that way.

977
01:02:36,482 --> 01:02:40,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they have to add a patch or something because right now it doesn't support that, so...

978
01:02:40,945 --> 01:02:43,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, why did you walk in here and then tell me to die in a boat fire?

979
01:02:43,647 --> 01:02:44,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you should.

980
01:02:45,028 --> 01:02:45,248
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

981
01:02:45,529 --> 01:02:46,309
[SPEAKER_08]: That's mean!

982
01:02:46,449 --> 01:02:47,410
[SPEAKER_08]: See, you're mean!

983
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:53,094
[SPEAKER_08]: You were making fun of me while I was going to the... Especially if you die... That's what we do here.

984
01:02:53,194 --> 01:02:55,036
[SPEAKER_08]: We make fun of you when you're not here.

985
01:02:55,176 --> 01:02:57,397
[SPEAKER_08]: If you die in a boat fire, that's pretty pathetic.

986
01:02:57,898 --> 01:02:58,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kidding.

987
01:02:58,758 --> 01:03:01,961
[SPEAKER_02]: If you die in a boat fire, that would be really awesome and stupid.

988
01:03:02,661 --> 01:03:03,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to die in a boat fire.

989
01:03:03,642 --> 01:03:04,643
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to go on a boat now.

990
01:03:06,184 --> 01:03:07,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Well... Is it my turn yet?

991
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:08,780
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not your turn.

992
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:09,301
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my turn.

993
01:03:09,421 --> 01:03:16,047
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm taking my turn to tell you guys that Video Games Live is having a CD release on October 15th.

994
01:03:16,107 --> 01:03:18,229
[SPEAKER_08]: It's their Greatest Hits Volume 1.

995
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:22,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, it's actually not a live show.

996
01:03:22,073 --> 01:03:24,976
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't go around all these venues and actually tape the songs being played live.

997
01:03:25,797 --> 01:03:28,019
[SPEAKER_08]: But they've actually taken some of these artists in the studio.

998
01:03:28,059 --> 01:03:31,703
[SPEAKER_08]: For instance, Martin Lung, who's like the piano player who plays all the songs.

999
01:03:31,943 --> 01:03:38,407
[SPEAKER_08]: They got him to record some of these songs, and they're going to have the CD come out for World of Warcraft, Super Mario, Halo.

1000
01:03:38,927 --> 01:03:39,868
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be pretty awesome.

1001
01:03:40,668 --> 01:03:41,449
[SPEAKER_08]: That is, if you're a nerd.

1002
01:03:42,549 --> 01:03:47,613
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a rumor, but I believe that each copy is going to come with a lock of Tommy Tallarico's hair.

1003
01:03:49,254 --> 01:03:50,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't confirm that.

1004
01:03:51,475 --> 01:03:52,796
[SPEAKER_08]: From his head or his pubes.

1005
01:03:53,816 --> 01:03:54,817
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't say.

1006
01:03:57,218 --> 01:04:00,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the limited edition comes from a different place.

1007
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:01,621
[SPEAKER_08]: That's disgusting.

1008
01:04:02,434 --> 01:04:05,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, wow, I think I made myself throw up in my stomach.

1009
01:04:06,436 --> 01:04:07,957
[SPEAKER_02]: You threw up in your stomach?

1010
01:04:09,418 --> 01:04:09,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1011
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:12,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, how does your body even work?

1012
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:15,121
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what happens when I'm gone for a week.

1013
01:04:15,281 --> 01:04:17,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything just goes to hell.

1014
01:04:17,983 --> 01:04:20,844
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rob throws up in his stomach.

1015
01:04:20,884 --> 01:04:22,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is totally counterproductive.

1016
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:24,746
[SPEAKER_08]: I meant to say my mouth.

1017
01:04:25,827 --> 01:04:27,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't I tell you guys, like...

1018
01:04:28,032 --> 01:04:30,334
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be like regurgitative eating.

1019
01:04:30,814 --> 01:04:31,715
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be like a mother bird.

1020
01:04:31,735 --> 01:04:32,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that eating?

1021
01:04:32,216 --> 01:04:32,756
[SPEAKER_08]: When you eat.

1022
01:04:33,056 --> 01:04:34,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, Rob, shut up.

1023
01:04:34,217 --> 01:04:35,338
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be like a mother bird.

1024
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:39,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you never heard the expression, you just made me throw up in my mouth a little bit?

1025
01:04:39,302 --> 01:04:39,742
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1026
01:04:39,782 --> 01:04:40,963
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I was going for.

1027
01:04:41,083 --> 01:04:42,024
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's not what you said.

1028
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,485
[SPEAKER_08]: For some reason I said stomach.

1029
01:04:43,625 --> 01:04:44,366
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why.

1030
01:04:44,486 --> 01:04:47,248
[SPEAKER_08]: I told you guys at the top of the show, I'm broken tonight.

1031
01:04:48,129 --> 01:04:49,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, poor baby.

1032
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:51,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get Rob some duct tape.

1033
01:04:51,172 --> 01:04:52,533
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't even had anything to drink.

1034
01:04:53,133 --> 01:04:53,714
[SPEAKER_08]: What's wrong with me?

1035
01:04:54,196 --> 01:05:00,880
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to come last week and bring you my really expensive booze from Greece and it didn't happen.

1036
01:05:01,721 --> 01:05:05,423
[SPEAKER_08]: We definitely need to take a break pretty soon because the show is already broken as it is.

1037
01:05:05,523 --> 01:05:17,730
[SPEAKER_08]: But we've got one more thing for you guys before we go to a break and that is the one and only website of the week as presented by DarkSakura who surfs the internet up and down and all around every week to find a website she likes to share with all of you.

1038
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:22,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Miss DarkSakura, where should the kids be pointing their web browsers to this week?

1039
01:05:25,370 --> 01:05:26,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere else.

1040
01:05:27,511 --> 01:05:30,993
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the website of the week is BBC Radio 1 homepage, actually.

1041
01:05:31,973 --> 01:05:36,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I, a lot of times, really hate the crap that's on the radio over here.

1042
01:05:36,596 --> 01:05:42,719
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will go, you know, turn on the BBC Radio 1 and listen to it.

1043
01:05:42,779 --> 01:05:43,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I also...

1044
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:49,523
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times we'll record the interviews that go off of there and some of the music specials.

1045
01:05:50,163 --> 01:05:54,265
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually get a lot of good information off there too.

1046
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:55,786
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other interviews posted.

1047
01:05:55,886 --> 01:05:57,226
[SPEAKER_02]: There's your singles charts.

1048
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:01,548
[SPEAKER_02]: You even get in some of the indie stuff that comes through.

1049
01:06:01,568 --> 01:06:02,429
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's pretty cool.

1050
01:06:02,629 --> 01:06:07,011
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of different variety of music than what we're used to over here.

1051
01:06:07,451 --> 01:06:08,252
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it's the same.

1052
01:06:08,272 --> 01:06:08,732
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got your

1053
01:06:09,557 --> 01:06:11,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiger Claw says BBC Radio 1 is awesome.

1054
01:06:11,058 --> 01:06:12,179
[SPEAKER_02]: The essential mix is the best show.

1055
01:06:35,484 --> 01:06:41,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I like listening to... I can't think of her name, but she's one of the DJs on there.

1056
01:06:41,568 --> 01:06:43,650
[SPEAKER_02]: She really does some good interviews.

1057
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:44,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1058
01:06:46,191 --> 01:06:46,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.

1059
01:06:46,872 --> 01:06:48,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Do they still play the Spice Girls on BBC Radio 1?

1060
01:06:49,073 --> 01:06:49,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1061
01:06:50,174 --> 01:06:51,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I just block that out.

1062
01:06:53,156 --> 01:06:54,077
[SPEAKER_08]: I miss the Spice Girls.

1063
01:06:54,977 --> 01:06:55,918
[SPEAKER_02]: The Shice Girls?

1064
01:06:56,058 --> 01:06:58,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Eddie, you want to go see the reunion tour with me in San Jose?

1065
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,241
[SPEAKER_08]: I so want to go, like so bad.

1066
01:07:00,781 --> 01:07:01,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Me too.

1067
01:07:01,182 --> 01:07:03,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember?

1068
01:07:04,224 --> 01:07:04,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember?

1069
01:07:04,978 --> 01:07:05,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Why am I out here?

1070
01:07:07,159 --> 01:07:14,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no wait, the short, no, the very short version is that Irene and I, it was like 3 in the morning, we're playing Spice World, I don't know if you guys remember that game from PS1.

1071
01:07:14,384 --> 01:07:15,324
[SPEAKER_04]: That game was awful!

1072
01:07:15,344 --> 01:07:17,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was awesome, awful, awful, awesome.

1073
01:07:18,106 --> 01:07:23,609
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, we were laughing so hard, and it's like 3 in the morning, so of course Rob comes out wagging his finger, why am I out here?

1074
01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:26,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we were being bad and Rob was going to spank us, I don't know.

1075
01:07:28,382 --> 01:07:29,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, never mind.

1076
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:33,825
[SPEAKER_08]: There's another part to this story, but I can't say it, even though the show's already got an explicit tag.

1077
01:07:34,245 --> 01:07:39,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just say they were interrupting something from all their laughing.

1078
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:42,810
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was very upset.

1079
01:07:46,893 --> 01:07:51,996
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we need to take a break on the show now, because I don't actually know how much video game content was in tonight's program.

1080
01:07:52,396 --> 01:07:57,599
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will go, and the people responsible for screwing up tonight's program will be sacked.

1081
01:07:58,457 --> 01:08:02,359
[SPEAKER_02]: And those responsible for the sacking would like it to be known that they too have just been sacked.

1082
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:05,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so everybody will be sacked during our break.

1083
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:09,781
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to come back with a stupendous Part B. It'll be fancy and nice.

1084
01:08:09,801 --> 01:08:12,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing it in a completely different manner and at great expense.

1085
01:08:13,142 --> 01:08:17,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Because honestly, guys, there's only one way we could probably fuck up this show even more.

1086
01:08:17,784 --> 01:08:19,025
[SPEAKER_02]: That's by letting Rob keep talking.

1087
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:20,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that would be one.

1088
01:08:21,145 --> 01:08:23,846
[SPEAKER_08]: But the other would be is that tonight, and by the way, fuck you.

1089
01:08:25,507 --> 01:08:27,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight's Part B. Do not want.

1090
01:08:30,703 --> 01:08:31,724
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1091
01:08:48,543 --> 01:08:49,984
[SPEAKER_02]: That means I have to sound really apathetic.

1092
01:08:50,004 --> 01:08:51,645
[SPEAKER_08]: May we go to break time now?

1093
01:08:52,325 --> 01:08:57,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice a week.

1094
