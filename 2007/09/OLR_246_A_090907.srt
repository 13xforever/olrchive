Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We're your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loco here

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, September 9th, 2007, Layers Hot Coffee Mode is found, but it's not what you think.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
HD DVD gets a price cut in Europe, and a third-party company has something to say about PlayStation's marketing.

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer lifestyle, and gamer culture.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That'll teach me to say so damn much during the introduction.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That voice you hear taunting behind me is the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hi. And my name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as well, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hello. How you doing, Jamie? How you doing tonight?

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I have a soda. You has a soda?

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I has a soda. Is it delicious?

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Not really. Not really? You're very quiet tonight. You seem kind of timid. Is everything okay?

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I just ate. You just ate, so you're very well satiated?

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I was getting into Uber bitch mode because I didn't eat, and then I ate, and I ate too much.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Now I should say something before we get to the rest of the show is that we are taking new pictures tonight,

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
which I'm hoping you guys will see the results of in our album.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I can't talk tonight. What the hell's wrong with me?

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In our album artwork that you'll be seeing for episode 250 at least a little later on, and Jamie got to eat.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Weren't you eating a Pikachu? Or was that? No, you were squishing a Pikachu, pretending to eat a Pikachu.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I ate my cell phone.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You ate your cell phone. Was it delicious?

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Not really. It tasted like Samsung.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Wonderful. Anyhow, also joining us tonight, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I've already said hello, but yes. Hello.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Hi again. How are you?

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm doing fine.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Awesome. Also say hello to our chat room, which is available at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You can also say hello to Gay Eddie, who's here tonight, joining us on the show.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah, that'd be Casper the Gay, thank you very much. You just always call me Gay Eddie, because you're a douche.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't know what else to call you. I'm sorry.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We're going to start off with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week?

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We'll come back to you and get you filled in a little more for the folks that may not know you,

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
because you haven't been on the show in a long time.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Has it really been six months? You could have had a baby since the last time.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Maybe you had a baby, and we'll find that out.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We'll start with Dark Sakura. How was your gaming week? Let's talk about video games.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Lots of pinball. We sold the Whodunnit, finally.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh, I liked Whodunnit.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yeah, but we can get a much better one than the one that we had.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We're babysitting some machines. We're babysitting Back to the Future, which, Back to the Future sucks,

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
because Michael J. Fox wouldn't let his likeness be used in the game,

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
so it has somebody who completely doesn't look like him.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What a bastard.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Or it's either him or his agent or something.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And then we got a time machine, which is one of my favorite older pins,

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and I played a whole crap ton of World Cup Soccer 94, which is my favorite pinball ever,

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and some Final Fantasy VI Advance.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Good times.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And no World of Warcraft.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Aw, sadness. That's all right. I haven't been playing World of Warcraft either,

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and I'll tell you why in a little bit. Let's go over to the one and only Loki.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hello.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I played this week Project Gotham Racing 3 Land,

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
which is weird, though, because we have five 360s,

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
but one of them does not want to land.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't know why. It will land other games, but it just doesn't like Project Gotham Racing 3.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't know.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So we played four players with that.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Luckily, that day there was someone missing, so it worked out.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Then Saints Row multiplayer, also via System Link.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I swear, you know, there's just not enough support for System Link.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's sad.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But hopefully we'll get live soon at work and then be able to play anything.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's see, other things I played.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Bioshock, more of that.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm actually a little bit more into it now.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I forget where the hell I'm at, but it's still been very good,

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
so definitely looking forward to playing more of that game.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And then, let's see, I tried a little bit more stuff on the 360.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I actually downloaded the full version of Worms, and well, it's Worms,

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
so I can't really say too much on that.

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Let's see, what else did I try out?

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Also on the PSP, I found someone had dumped a version of Sega Rally on there that's not out yet,

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
but it's actually very awesome.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Sega Rally Revo, I know it's going to be on most other systems.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I think they just drop in the Revo part for the PSP version though,

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
but it's cool. It's very awesome.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
If you've played Sega Rally in the arcades, it's exactly like that.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I mean, it looks good too, so I really recommend that one.

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And, oh! I almost forgot.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
On 360, play Flatout Ultimate Carnage.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Fucking love this game.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
This game right now, I think, best racing game of the year.

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Hands down.

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's a pretty hefty title.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's fucking fun. It's got, you know, Flatout used to love the game first off,

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
because you can crash into things.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Now, the first game really pissed me off,

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
because when you'd crash into objects on the track,

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
you would kind of get stuck on them, and that kind of sucked.

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But, they went back, fixed all that shit.

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Now there's like 6,000 things on the track to crash into,

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and you see all of them, you know, all strewn about on the track.

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Then they have like this Ultimate Carnage mode,

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
which is basically like the takedown mode in Burnout,

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and it's really fun.

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And then they've also got Destruction Derby,

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and of course the Ragdoll Olympics.

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Highly recommend this game when it comes out in October.

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm definitely picking it up.

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
As far as arcade racers, it's definitely the best one this year.

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm not sure if people would agree as far as sim racers.

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm sure Project Gotham Racing 4 will take that.

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But as far as arcade racers go,

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
if you want something that's pretty fun,

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
definitely check out Burnout, not Burnout, Flatout, Ultimate Carnage.

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I was going to say, isn't this the game that I seem to recall reading

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
on one of the big blogs out there,

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and I'm sorry, I forget which one,

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
but they have like a side-by-side comparison of the box art

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
from Flatout to Burnout, and it's like the same fucking box,

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
but just with a different title?

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Basically, but, you know, Flatout is a completely different game.

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I mean, their thing is, you know,

117
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
the fact that you can crash into a bunch of different objects on the course.

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You know, Burnout doesn't really have that.

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's mainly just crashing into the cars and exploding and stuff like that.

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So it's a different type of game,

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
but I really recommend checking it out.

122
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's pretty awesome.

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I played the demo for a good half an hour at least,

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and probably will play it a little bit more until it comes out.

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Then, of course, I also tried out Worms 2,

126
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Open Warfare on the PSP.

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Once again, that's also Worms,

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and, you know, I don't know why the hell I'm playing these Worms games.

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's probably because I can get them for free.

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Because you're a whore for worms.

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah, it's a fun game.

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's just, you know, it's a fun game to play with other people.

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's kind of like a board game, almost.

134
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You need other people to make it fun,

135
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
because the computer sucks.

136
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Only on this show would saying,

137
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
you're a whore for worms actually make sense.

138
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Like, could you imagine if I walked up to,

139
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
like, just a random person on the street,

140
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
you're a whore for worms!

141
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You're a worm whore!

142
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Unless they liked worms.

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Or were a fisherman.

144
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Do you think there is such a thing as, like, worm fetish?

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's really gross.

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Probably. There's sick people in the world.

147
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
There's fish fetish for everything.

148
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
That's what they say.

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Seriously?

150
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Do we have anybody in the chatroom with a worm fetish?

151
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Everybody in the chatroom is talking about their gaming weeks.

152
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I don't care what you play in your gaming weeks.

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We haven't asked any of you.

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I know.

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh, no, dude.

156
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm trying to see if there's any other stuff that catches my eye in chat.

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I like DJ Jenai, because he's got, like, old school stuff in his gaming week,

158
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
like Mighty Bomb Jack and Mappy.

159
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That's pretty old, right?

160
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Hey, 1942 in Lode Runner.

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But in Kaboom, on this, uh, the Activision's hit Remix, which sucks.

162
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Kaboom is awesome.

163
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Wait, you didn't like the Remix?

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We were talking about Kunio games earlier.

165
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
No, I just didn't like the, Activision hits Remix on the PSP.

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's just, I don't know.

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Wait, but isn't that the only system they put it out on, is the Remix ones?

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Like, all the souped up titles?

169
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Well, they weren't really souped up.

170
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
These were just the standard games.

171
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Oh.

172
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
This is the classic one that's going to be redone, you know, with the ones that they had in, like, Xbox Live Arcade.

173
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
This is just the old one.

174
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It was a collection of, like, 70-some Activision titles, you know, like Kaboom, Pitfall, Pitfall 2, etc.

175
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh, okay.

176
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Which is okay.

177
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
If you really want a collection of those old games, then great.

178
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Pick that up.

179
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm sure it's dirt cheap by now.

180
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't know.

181
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's just not for me.

182
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm not, I don't want to play it on that console.

183
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Hey, I was playing Worms, and I was getting achievements on that.

184
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What was I playing?

185
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
There was something else I was playing.

186
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh, I played Mutant Storm Reloaded.

187
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I played that, and I was getting some more achievements on that as well.

188
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh, actually, no.

189
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I was looking through my arcade games.

190
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm like, I own, like, 40 arcade games, and I don't have the high scores on any of them among my friends.

191
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm like, which one can I possibly get the high score on?

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And I was like, okay.

193
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't know.

194
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't know.

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't have the high score on.

196
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And I tried on Mutant Storm Reloaded, and I just didn't have enough time to dedicate to it.

197
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
How many games am I whipping your ass on?

198
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I don't know.

199
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't play live arcade games that much, so probably a lot.

200
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Just curious.

201
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
All finished?

202
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm all finished.

203
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh, Call of Duty 4 multiplayer, the beta.

204
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Oh.

205
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's pretty awesome.

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Are you in it legally?

207
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I am in it legally.

208
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Call of Duty actually put me in the first wave.

209
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Are you allowed to talk about it?

210
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Fuck if I know.

211
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Okay, let me put it this way.

212
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's Call of Duty.

213
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I mean, shit, they haven't really changed much since, you know, 2.

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And it's no modern day stuff.

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It looks awesome.

216
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's it.

217
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I mean, if you want me to describe it for you, go play Call of Duty 3, but just imagine it's futuristic.

218
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Or modern day.

219
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I mean, it's basically the same damn thing.

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's good.

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
People are loving this game.

222
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You know, it ran really smooth.

223
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Didn't have any lag issues.

224
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Just, it looks awesome, and I kind of figured it would.

225
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So, you know, I will definitely be picking it up when it comes out, but just so you know, it looks good.

226
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
All right.

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Well, we're going to go over to Casper, the gay, and find out about his gaming week and what kind of stuff he's been playing.

228
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I've just been doing the virtual console thing, just playing the heck out of Super Metroid, which is still one of the best games ever.

229
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So, I'm not very far, because it's actually the first time I've ever played this game, because I think it was in a coma in the 90s when it came out.

230
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So, I'm like, oh my God, this is like my first time playing, and it's awesome.

231
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So, you know, I've got all the cool power-ups, and it's awesome.

232
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And then Neotopia, or whatever it's called, which is that Zelda clone for TurboGrafx.

233
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Neotopia is great.

234
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I've got Neotopia and Neotopia 2.

235
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Oh, do you have Neotopia 2?

236
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I have TurboGrafx.

237
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Okay, okay. The thing about it is, it's a Zelda clone. If you like Zelda games, you'll like it for that old-school gameplay.

238
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But there's some reasons why Zelda was way more popular.

239
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
For instance, if you bomb a cave or you bomb a wall in a dungeon, you have to re-bomb it the next time you go back in, which is a real pain in the ass.

240
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
That's what they get for being HuCard games.

241
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah, it's horrible. And then if you go into the cave or something, you automatically have to start talking to the person.

242
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You have no choice. Or if somebody's in a dungeon in a room, every time you pass through that room, you start talking to them again.

243
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm like, ugh! But it's still fun. It's good stuff.

244
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Again, HuCard games.

245
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's good times, though. I haven't played any new stuff, so I want to play Metroid, the new one, so that looks pretty awesome.

246
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Kick them off the TV watching Battlestar reruns and go play Metroid. It's awesome.

247
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Alright. Well, I've got to talk about my gaming week.

248
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Oh, hell. I don't know if I really want to say anything about my gaming week. I'd better brace myself.

249
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
This week, I played Final Fantasy XI of a lot this week.

250
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh, hi, Shane. How are you?

251
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Hello. I'm good.

252
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I've been playing Final Fantasy XI. I went back.

253
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What's the old saying, Shane? Final Fantasy XI is like an abusive husband?

254
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah. You just keep going back to them, despite the fact that they abuse you and beat you up.

255
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yeah, I went back. But why, Shane, did we end up going back to Final Fantasy XI, out of curiosity?

256
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
There's a camera on me.

257
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Because I wanted to play something, and I had codes that would make it so I could play for a month for free, so I was like, I'm going to do that.

258
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And then you got a free month on WoW, and you're like, okay, I'll come play Final Fantasy XI.

259
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And then we got two of our friends to play, too. So we're all just going back. We're migrating back.

260
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The thing about it is that they've changed a lot since I've been gone, and I was kind of curious what all has changed.

261
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And it does seem like they have fixed a lot of things that were pissing me off before, such as they got rid of a lot of the gold sellers.

262
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The economy seems to be a lot better than it was before. Seems like it's stabilized.

263
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,000
The economy changed?

264
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah, seriously, the economy changes. It happens in a lot of MMOs.

265
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But here's the most hilarious part, and old-school OLR listeners will really get a kick out of this.

266
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You know what server we're playing on?

267
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Faerie.

268
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The Faerie server!

269
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
We're playing on the Faerie server!

270
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And we're pretending we're noobs.

271
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You have to go back to Episode 80 to get these jokes when I was first getting into Final Fantasy XI.

272
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But yes, we're playing on the Faerie server.

273
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
For what reason?

274
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What was it?

275
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I don't remember. It was something to do with live journal trauma or something.

276
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You have to go back.

277
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's really fun, though.

278
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm actually having a really good time playing this time.

279
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So am I. I keep leveling everything I can.

280
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But I'm wondering if it's one of those things where when I have to start partying in the dunes, if it's going to wear off real quick.

281
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
We don't know what the dunes are. Give me my drink, Eddie!

282
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
This is great radio. What?

283
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He's trying to steal my drink.

284
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
We don't know what the dunes are yet. Remember, we're just low levels.

285
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
We'll be there soon.

286
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
We've never played before.

287
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm looking in the chat room to see what people are saying.

288
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Ghostguy says Final Fantasy XI equals not so good.

289
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Cry.

290
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Well, that person's name that you just read equals not so good.

291
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
SSJ100Matt says, why isn't Jamie on top of Rob about this?

292
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Well, Shane took her mic, for one.

293
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Well, I needed talking to something.

294
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I would be curious what Jamie's thoughts are on all of this.

295
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm going to go ask her. I'll start by.

296
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I don't care.

297
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Oh, I thought you were going to call me an addict or yell at me or something.

298
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
No.

299
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
The play is up to you.

300
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Oh, I like this. This is the kinder, gentler Jamie than we had a few episodes ago.

301
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
No, this is the indifferent, apathetic Jamie.

302
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh, I see. This is the meh Jamie.

303
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yeah.

304
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The meh. What do you think about that, Jamie?

305
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Meh.

306
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I didn't just play Final Fantasy XI, though.

307
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Because I swear I'm going to limit my time on it this time around.

308
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'll let you guys know how long I actually stick with it.

309
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But I also was playing some more Blue Dragon and made some more progress on that.

310
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm enjoying Blue Dragon.

311
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I realize the critics didn't exactly give it the best scores in the world,

312
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
but I'm actually having a good time with it.

313
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And then some stuff on Xbox Live Arcade. Hello, Fatal Fury Special.

314
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I had to give that a go.

315
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's the same game, basically, from the Neo Geo.

316
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
They didn't really change anything, but that's okay,

317
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
because Fatal Fury is an awesome game.

318
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
But they did add Xbox Live support and achievements.

319
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
For five bucks, I actually think it's one of the better fighting game deals on Xbox Live right now.

320
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I think it's a better value than the $10 Street Fighter II that's up there now,

321
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
although I am still looking forward to the Street Fighter II HD remix.

322
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Street Fighter is $10?

323
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Street Fighter is $10, believe it or not.

324
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I thought that Virtual Console games were expensive.

325
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Well, Virtual Console games are expensive.

326
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I mean, like $5 for Mario Brothers.

327
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Excuse me, not even Super Mario Brothers.

328
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Or $5 for Metroid. Hello.

329
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You should see the PlayStation Network game prices.

330
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Granted, they're more full games, but we're talking like $40, $20.

331
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I want to say one other thing I've noticed about Final Fantasy XI

332
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
is that it seems like there's a lot less OMGWTF-type kids on there now,

333
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and I'm noticing there's a lot of older people that are getting into Final Fantasy XI.

334
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
A lot of stay-at-home moms seem to be playing the game. It's interesting.

335
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So what do you think I should see about getting back in?

336
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Are you a stay-at-home mom?

337
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Shut the heck up. Are you actually thinking about coming back?

338
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Well, I'd play it about as much as I'd play World of Warcraft.

339
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Shane, you gotta hear this!

340
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Somebody go, Shane!

341
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Well, this is like news-breaking stories here. I'm sure the chat room is like OMG.

342
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I have to find my controller again, though.

343
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Shane! I'm running!

344
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But I haven't installed all that square crap off my computer.

345
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Run faster!

346
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I don't know where my discs are either.

347
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
If you want, you have to play like you've never played before, though.

348
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's okay. I only got to, what, level 15?

349
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
There you go. You'll forget everything.

350
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
She's thinking about it. Oh, this is exciting news.

351
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm probably actually going to quit World of Warcraft, too.

352
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm just going to quit MMOs.

353
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I haven't quit World of Warcraft. I should say that.

354
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's just that I have a free month because I got somebody else to play through the rewards room,

355
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
so this is my month where I'm going to decide which one I'm going to stick with, if any,

356
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
because honestly, when I play MMOs...

357
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You should totally play World of Warcraft. Bye!

358
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It cuts into my console times, so we'll see.

359
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm going to try to play through Super Metroid.

360
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Oh, Super Metroid. Good stuff.

361
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You know, I've been looking for a video capture card for the Mac,

362
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
so we can do Operator 11 stuff with the Super Metroid.

363
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
We can do our live playthrough and have the video feed actually on it.

364
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You actually have to do it this week.

365
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I know. We totally will. I just need to get the card.

366
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I haven't been doing my show on Tuesday, so we should do that instead of my show.

367
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
We'll figure something out.

368
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Speaking of Operator 11, let's go into housekeeping tonight.

369
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yeah.

370
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I want to remind everybody out there, we do have our video feeds now on Operator 11.

371
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't think it's the most interesting thing in the world to just kind of sit here and watch us do the show,

372
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
but I'm hoping as time goes on, we'll think of more ways to integrate the video,

373
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
but what I do want to point you guys to is that we're looking at putting other videos on Operator 11,

374
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
like us playing new games as they come out.

375
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Like Jamie said, we're going to play through Super Metroid and a bunch of other stuff,

376
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
so keep an eye out on our page on operator11.com.

377
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm not sure exactly how to get to our profile,

378
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
but I can tell you our username is orangelanerator. That was a really bad plug, huh?

379
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I don't really know how you get there.

380
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Best. Plug. Ever.

381
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Just find it.

382
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
All right, so there you go.

383
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Let's see, I don't really have a whole lot of other housekeeping.

384
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I already talked about that we have new pictures coming.

385
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I ate too much pizza.

386
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm actually hungry.

387
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Eddie, you want to make another round to talk about?

388
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Do you want my breadsticks?

389
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Seriously, can I have some breadsticks?

390
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Sure.

391
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And we're going to get into tonight's gaming news.

392
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Hopefully I'm not first.

393
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Hey, Rob's first!

394
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
No, I'm kidding.

395
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So, to start things off, let's talk about pathetic stuff,

396
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
including how pathetic Lair was.

397
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Well, personally, I haven't played it,

398
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
so I don't know if it's pathetic, but based on people's reviews of it,

399
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
for example, IGN gave it a 4.9,

400
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I would say it's pretty pathetic,

401
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
and I guess, you know, there are some control issues and stuff like that.

402
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Well, to, I guess, help save face,

403
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Sony has figured, you know what,

404
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
the reason why our game is getting bad scores

405
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
is because reviewers just don't know how to review our game.

406
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yeah, it's never a good argument.

407
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So, what they did was they sent out reviewers guides for Lair.

408
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
They basically sent IGN a guide of how to review their game,

409
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
because they figure, oh, you're stupid and you don't know how to play our game.

410
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yeah, that really makes you look cool.

411
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So, apparently, six of the 21 pages of the guide

412
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
are devoted to the game's controls,

413
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
and I guess it has, you know, like a fact or something in it.

414
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
That's so retarded.

415
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Ghostguy in our chat room says Lair is lame.

416
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I don't know, I will withhold judgment until I have a chance to play it.

417
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It looked good, though.

418
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It looked like the game that could save the PlayStation 3

419
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
from all this, you know, that people are saying at it.

420
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So, what went wrong, Loki?

421
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It just kind of sucked.

422
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't know.

423
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I think one of the things was, first off,

424
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
you had to use the motion controls.

425
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It wasn't just, you know, you can turn them off or it's optional.

426
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You had to use them.

427
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
They were kind of floaty.

428
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
There was, I guess, some lag between certain things,

429
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
and I don't know, it's just a lot harder than people thought.

430
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So...

431
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Mr. DeBucket in our chat room at chat.orangestonesradio.com says

432
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Lair is better on PSP via remote play.

433
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You know, gimmick. That's all I'm saying.

434
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Well, you know, it's interesting that that gets brought up

435
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
because it makes me think about the whole DS Wii thing.

436
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Should we have seen something with that by now?

437
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Oh, I guess we have the Pokemon game, huh?

438
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I guess we do have a little bit of connectivity, but nothing to this extent.

439
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That's cool, but here's the thing, though.

440
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I mean, I don't want to get into other stories or anything,

441
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
but I'm just saying, you know, the remote play isn't like,

442
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
it's not like the DS thing with the Wii,

443
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
where, you know, that's actually being used as a controller,

444
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
and it actually has an interface on there and menus and stuff.

445
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's different than what's on the screen.

446
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's actually, you know, kind of an accessory to the game.

447
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Whereas remote play is, look, I can play this from, you know,

448
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Starbucks down the street.

449
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm playing my PlayStation 3 on my PSP.

450
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I mean, it doesn't work completely.

451
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Even that's kind of broken.

452
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I mean, sure, you can do it, but, you know,

453
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
it's just like, sure, you can emulate PlayStation 1 games on there,

454
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
but not perfectly, so I don't know.

455
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It is a gimmick.

456
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I can understand watching the movies, you know,

457
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
maybe streaming that stuff when you're on the go,

458
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
you know, waiting in the airport and you have free Wi-Fi

459
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
or something like that, but playing Lair on the go,

460
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I mean, if you really want to play Lair on your PSP,

461
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
make a version of Lair for your PSP.

462
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Alright, let me go ahead and say this,

463
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
because, you know, I know Loki's dying for me to get to this,

464
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
so he can go off even more than he already is,

465
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
but of course, you know, as you guys know,

466
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Lair has that connectivity between the PSP and the PlayStation 3,

467
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
and a Sony technical insider has been spotted saying,

468
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
quote, it's a nice start.

469
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Over time, I'm sure we'll have more advanced features.

470
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So is this possibly just the beginning of more to come for the console?

471
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Well, remember when they were shown off the console

472
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
and they had the Formula One racing game

473
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
and they were like, look, you can use your PSP as a rear view mirror.

474
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Why? Why would you do that?

475
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Where are you going to put it?

476
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You're just going to set it, stand next to you or something.

477
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Just put it in your damn, you know,

478
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
they have rear view mirrors on your car model in the game.

479
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Why would you need to have it on a separate screen?

480
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's just a gimmick. Fucking gimmick is what it is.

481
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
You know, and granted, the DS connectivity with the Wii,

482
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
you know, very brief, you know, all one game of it,

483
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
is very gimmicky as well because you don't really need it to play.

484
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
But, you know, at least it is something in additional to the game.

485
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It's not like, oh look, you can sort of control the game with this.

486
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
There were some other, when they were doing the GameCube too,

487
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
there was some cooler like connectivity with the Game Boy Advance

488
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
because like when you were playing, I think it was one of the Metal Gear games,

489
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
something like that, it was like your sonar

490
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
and it was like having your own cool like device but in the game.

491
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
So it was a gimmick but it was like practical too, so.

492
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Oh, no, here's the thing, the reason why they did that

493
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
is so that you can make the racing game more like real life.

494
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
And by the way, Mr. DeBucket in chat wants to point out,

495
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
it was a tech demo, you dumbass, it wasn't even in the game.

496
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I know, that's what I'm saying, it was the tech demos

497
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
when they were first showing the PlayStation 3 on.

498
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It makes it more like real life because what you do

499
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
is you get a woman to sit next to you while you drive.

500
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Where's something I can throw at Rob right now?

501
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm not even finished, and you have the PSP

502
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
and the woman's watching and she's nagging about everything you're doing wrong.

503
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Where's something I can throw at Rob? Give me one of your Pikachus.

504
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Throw one of these breadsticks, these things will knock me out.

505
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
They're like rock solid.

506
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I think the Operator 11 people heard me banging it against the wall earlier.

507
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
These things are tough.

508
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Alright, anyway, that's all I have to say.

509
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
It's okay because Rob drives like Grandma.

510
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
See? You're criticizing my driving.

511
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Now, Rob, the game they even admitted when they were showing off the connectivity,

512
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
yeah, you can use it to control your dragon.

513
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Oh, by the way, you can't land your dragon or anything

514
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
because there's no additional L2 buttons or R2 and stuff like that,

515
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
so some of the controls are broken.

516
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Then why even put some half-assed control system in there

517
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
that you can play this thing remotely? It's stupid.

518
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's just like those people that use their media center extender

519
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
to view the internet on their 360.

520
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
It's stupid. It's gimmicky.

521
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You don't need to do that.

522
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Well, if you'd like to comment on Loki's rants,

523
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
we always welcome your emails.

524
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and of course our chat room.

525
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Send them directly to Loki.

526
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Send them to him. I don't need them.

527
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And while you're at it, sign him up for lots of Nigerian bank lotteries.

528
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I already get enough spam.

529
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And Loki's definitely interested in anything you have on Viagra or Syalis.

530
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I will forward all my email to you, Rob.

531
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
He also wants bigger breasts.

532
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
All right, I'm done. That's all I wanted to say about the connectivity.

533
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Well, you know our favorite crayon eater was going around in his days at Sony

534
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
saying that the PS3 was a computer and a multimedia whatever.

535
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Kazurai, who is now the man again, said, and I'm going to quote,

536
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'd like to clearly say the PS3 is a game machine.

537
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It's nothing more than that.

538
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
No, it is not. In fact, all their commercials say computer entertainment system.

539
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
It's a fucking computer.

540
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
No, it is not. It's the Sony PlayStation.

541
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I mean, it is a fucking computer. You've been saying computer.

542
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Just because your fucking computer does not sell,

543
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
does not mean that you have to start calling it a game machine now.

544
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's a fucking computer. Stick with it.

545
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Who turned Loki to 11 tonight? That's what I want to know.

546
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Why don't you just make 10 louder?

547
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
No, he's too loud. Here's my thing.

548
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
This is why I think this is a newsworthy quote.

549
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Because of the fact that I remember them selling the PlayStation 3 as a computer.

550
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And to some extent, I think this is where Sony excels best.

551
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Like, what makes the PSP better than a DS to some people?

552
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Now again, you can argue all you want until you're blue in the face about the games,

553
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
but some people prefer the PSP because you can surf the internet on it as built in.

554
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
You can listen to MP3s, help people download our show.

555
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
A lot of people download this podcast and listen to it on it.

556
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
You can carry the pictures with you anywhere you go,

557
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
and pretty soon they're going to have the video out and you can watch the movies.

558
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Sony actually does this pretty well at being more than just a game system.

559
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And that's kind of what makes the PlayStation 3 a little bit appealing as well.

560
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
What's the one thing that has people more excited than anything about PlayStation 3?

561
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Home. Is home a game? No, it's kind of something outside the box.

562
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So for them to go out and say a quote like this is a little bit like, huh?

563
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
But you're like the worst at being a game machine.

564
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You do everything else really good. I don't know.

565
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Guess what? People didn't care that you can load Linux on it.

566
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
That's why it's now a game system and not a fucking computer.

567
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Well, okay, fine then. $600 is too much for a game system.

568
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
$600 was cheap for a computer, too much for a game system.

569
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
So now it's too much for a game system.

570
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,000
All right, let's see. Son of Dad says PlayStation 3 right now is a cheap Blu-ray player, no more, no less.

571
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
There might be some Sony fans that disagree, but I don't know.

572
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I mean, I still have yet to buy a PlayStation 3 because I have to admit I feel kind of similar. Sorry.

573
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
There's nothing out there to play.

574
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Even, I mean, Ratchet and Clank Future, that looks pretty good and Resistance was good.

575
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I'm sure when Final Fantasy 13 comes out, I'll be like,

576
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Hail, Sony! Welcome into my house! Hello, PlayStation 3! I love you!

577
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Well, then you'll have a lot of time to save up money, you know, when it comes out spring 2009.

578
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Is that the current release they're saying?

579
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
No, I'm just guessing because, you know, that's shit.

580
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I mean, because it'll come out in Japan, you know, probably Christmas next year or something,

581
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
and then we'll see it maybe spring or summer of 2009.

582
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
But don't worry, don't worry. Good games are coming to the PlayStation 3 someday.

583
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
All right. Thank you, Jamie, for the quote.

584
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It certainly livened up our show a little bit tonight.

585
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Nah.

586
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Except for you.

587
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Anyway, so guess what? You can't talk about PSP Homebrew on the official Sony forums.

588
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Wow! Surprise! You know, you can't talk about cracking their system on their own forums.

589
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
How dare they do that?

590
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm more concerned with the fact that it took them this long to ban that chat.

591
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
What?

592
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Well, you know, the PSP is only a game system. You shouldn't be doing everything.

593
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Shut up and read the story!

594
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:01,000
So, yeah, if you talk about Homebrew, you will be banned from Sony's official chat room or forum.

595
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And guess what?

596
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
We ban you!

597
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Since we're on the topic of Homebrew, it should not be a surprise that with the PlayStation Slim coming out,

598
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:24,000
the PlayStation Portable Slim, that they've already cracked, or not really cracked, but dumped the 3.6 firmware that is included with it.

599
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So you know what that means. First they dump it, then they crack it, and then you run your Homebrew.

600
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
So it's only a matter of time before I will be picking up a PSP Slim.

601
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:43,000
You know, I know I can say this, and it won't go anywhere, so nobody tell him, but I think I know what I'm going to get William for.

602
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I'm totally serious here. I think I know what I'm going to get William for his birthday. I'm going to get him a PSP Slim.

603
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Because funny enough, William is a huge Sony fanboy.

604
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And I don't know what it is. He doesn't even play a whole lot of video games, but every time we go into Best Buy,

605
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
we'll be looking at Motorstorm or whatever, and he's always like,

606
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
don't you want a PlayStation 3? Look at it. It's so beautiful. Why don't you have a PlayStation 3 in your house? You ever heard of the game system?

607
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Why don't you get a PlayStation 3? I'm like, are you going to buy me one? And he's like, no.

608
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
But I think he really wants a PSP, so I'm going to get him one, because he thinks they're cool.

609
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I know, but I'm going to get him the Slim, because they're new, and then I can go, look, it's a new toy too, and I think he'll get a kick out of that.

610
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So Sony fanboys who are pissed off at the show right now because we're, you know, knocking Sony,

611
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I just thought I'd let you know they are still getting some of our money.

612
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Because, you know, I do think the PSP is pretty awesome now.

613
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It was a slow start, but then again, the DS had a slow start too, so what can you say?

614
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Well, anyhow, one thing, of course, that you can play on those PSPs is Lair, which goes back and forth, you know, with a little remote connectivity.

615
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
But yes, we have one more Lair story for you guys.

616
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:55,000
There's a brand new hot coffee mode that's been discovered inside Lair. Yes, there's a hot coffee mode, except it's not really what you think.

617
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:06,000
If you actually watch the video of the hot coffee mode, it's actually just something you unlock where somebody brews, we're watching it here in the studio, so you can hear it on the TV.

618
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Somebody just brews a pot of hot coffee.

619
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,000
All you have to do is enter in this big, long string at the cheat menu, and you'll be welcomed with this video of somebody making hot coffee.

620
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
That's the best joke ever.

621
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It's kind of stupid, but like it's stupid funny. Like a Jim Carrey movie, it's stupid funny.

622
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
That's great.

623
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:37,000
By the way, that code that you can enter in, 686-F7-420-636-F66666565.

624
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
If you missed any part of this show and need a transcription, get out a pen next time.

625
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And guess what, those also happen to be the reviews that this game got as well.

626
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Good job, Loki.

627
00:32:51,000 --> 00:33:03,000
As I was reminded in the chat room, though, the PSP has already cracked the firmware, and they're going to be releasing a...

628
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I guess Team M33 is going to be releasing a CFW 3.6 firmware for it.

629
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
That's one of the better jokes we've had in a while on this program. Good job, Loki.

630
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yes, chat room, now you two get to beat that one into the ground.

631
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
So, some news for our UK listeners. Sega's got some dates out for some of their stuff.

632
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Virtua Fighter V, who gives a crap on Xbox 360, will be 26th October, Universe at War for PC and Ghost Squad on Wii is 2nd November, Sonic Rush Adventure for the DS will be next week, Crazy Taxi, Fair Wars also will be later this month on PSP.

633
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Sonic Rivals 2 will be on November 2nd, and The Golden Compass will be on November 30th. There you go.

634
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Hitstun asks, do they get Virtua Fighter V 360 before we do?

635
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm not sure.

636
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Probably about the same week, right?

637
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
We're getting the last week of October.

638
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Interesting. Well, let's go to some release dates and travel the world and see what's coming out right now in all different places, not just from Sega.

639
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Oh, yes. In fact, this week's actually pretty good. We're starting to get into some of the better stuff, you know, fourth quarter stuff for all systems.

640
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And I know next week, well, I'm not a huge fan of it, but NHL 08 and NHL 2K8 are both coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and 360.

641
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Then we have EA's competition for Tony Hawk's Skate that's also going to be coming out next week.

642
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Let's see here. What? Anyways, Heavenly Sword will be making its way out next week, and hopefully that's another game that we will not be seeing a reviewer's guide going out for as well.

643
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I have high hopes for Heavenly Sword. It looks really good.

644
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It looks okay.

645
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
It could be what Laird, unfortunately, was not.

646
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I am waiting a little bit to get it just because, you know, I don't know, the demo, it was short and I didn't enjoy myself too much with it, so we'll see.

647
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Also next week, Dirt on PlayStation 3, finally getting that game.

648
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
On PlayStation 2,.hack//G.U. Volume 3, the last game in that trilogy.

649
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Guilty Gear XX Accent Core on PlayStation 2, that should make a lot of import fans happy.

650
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Let's see, then also on 360, you will be getting the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Game of the Year Edition.

651
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
That's going to be including both the expansion, I believe, and some of the download content for that.

652
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
In other words, this is the release that fucks you all over who bought the game originally at full price and then all the expansions at full price.

653
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
If you want the PlayStation 3 one, guess what, it's not coming out. It got delayed.

654
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Fatal Inertia is also coming out in 360 next week, as well as Kengo, Legend of the Nine.

655
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And let's see, then also on the Wii, Big Fat Nothing.

656
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
On PC, of course, Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, the Game of the Year Edition.

657
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Democracy, apparently we're getting Democracy on September 11th, how appropriate.

658
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And some crappy Sherlock Holmes game, that's interesting.

659
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And then, of course, my favorite for the DS, Drawn to Life is coming out next week.

660
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
That looks really awesome, so that would be cool.

661
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
And then, of course, if you're a music game fan, Jam Sessions.

662
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I'm actually thinking about picking this up just because I need some guitar stuff in the mixes I do, so Jam Sessions.

663
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
That's pretty much it.

664
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Good times. Lots of stuff coming out on the Japan release calendar for September 13th, 2007.

665
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,000
On the Xbox 360, Musou Orochi is coming out. It's an action game. It'll be available on the Xbox 360.

666
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It doesn't look like a game they're bringing over here, but it looks like it could be a little bit of fun.

667
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, SSX Blur finally comes out in Japan for you guys over there.

668
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Mega Zone 23, Ali Garland is coming out.

669
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
That's like old school anime, too.

670
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Yet another old school anime having a game made out of it. Who would have thought?

671
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Like we don't have 20 million Lupin games.

672
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Yeah, I know. But you get those games.

673
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Also, on the PlayStation 2, I like this title.

674
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I think this is just getting a price reduction because it's going into Best Collection, but it's a game called Happiness Deluxe.

675
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And it's even better. It's made by Marvelous Entertainment. So there you go.

676
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
It's marvelously happy.

677
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And Sega's putting out yet another Pachinko game.

678
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,000
No!

679
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Taisen Pachinko. He's shou... He's shou...

680
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Sakura Taisen is coming out.

681
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,000
You know what I want to see?

682
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Oh, dude, they're doing a Sakura Taisen Pachinko?

683
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
They should have a Pachinko Xbox Live Arcade game. That'd be funny.

684
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
That would be actually pretty rad.

685
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I think that would be pretty great.

686
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
You know, then maybe we can find out what we're missing out on over here.

687
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Also coming out on the Nintendo DS.

688
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I love this. This is my favorite title of the week.

689
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Coming out on the Nintendo DS.

690
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I Love Dolphin is coming out in Japan.

691
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Oh, I bet you do.

692
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I would make a comment about that. Knowing certain things about certain people.

693
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Here's the best part. It's made by Starfish Entertainment.

694
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I Love Dolphin coming to the Nintendo DS.

695
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Dolphin safe.

696
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Do you know they make a viper called the Dolphin?

697
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I don't know. Some Pokemon games and SimCity DS.

698
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,000
You know, blah, blah, blah.

699
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Oh, I can't forget the PSP. Let me see if there's anything on the PSP worth mentioning.

700
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Crap!

701
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Oh, Crisis Core!

702
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Shit, I think there's a lot of people really excited about that.

703
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Crisis Core also out on September 13th.

704
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
As well as Fate Tiger Coliseum.

705
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Ooh.

706
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
There you go.

707
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Those are your release dates for Japan.

708
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Well, how about for our friends in the UK?

709
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
On the 14th is Blazing Angels Secret Missions of World War II.

710
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
CSI Three Dimensions of Murder.

711
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Yay.

712
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Dungeons and Dragons Tactics for PSP.

713
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Fatal Inertia on Xbox 360.

714
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Freshly Picked Tingles Rosy Ruby Land.

715
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Hooray!

716
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Freshly Picked Tingles. I love those!

717
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
That's on the DS.

718
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I hope it never comes over here.

719
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I'm going to import it.

720
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
It will be in English.

721
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
We have Heavenly...

722
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
English, English!

723
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
That means there will be extra vowels.

724
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Extra vowels make everything better.

725
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Heavenly Sword on PlayStation 3.

726
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Heroes of Mana, which we already have over here.

727
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
MotoGP07 Sonic Rush Adventure on the 14th.

728
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Stranglehold Super Paper Mario on Wii.

729
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Yay!

730
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Something you guys were talking about reminded me of one other thing that I really missed in Final Fantasy XI.

731
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
And that was boss monsters with no vowels in their name.

732
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Like...

733
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Is the name of a dragon.

734
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Or no, I think there's a dragon you have to fight called...

735
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Good times.

736
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Good times. Anyways, as with most games, they've been getting updates and patches every now and then.

737
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And one in particular that happened this last week was BioShock got a title update to fix a few things.

738
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Just some minor stuff I guess.

739
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Updates improve stability when loading autosaves and overall game stability corrects audio during title menu loading and addresses AI behaviors regarding health stations.

740
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So, that's kind of interesting.

741
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Another interesting thing though is of course people picking apart the PC version found a couple of notations for Plasmid Pack 1.

742
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Which is believed to be a download that's going to happen later on.

743
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Including some brand new Plasmids that you'll be able to buy from the machines and whatnot.

744
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
So hopefully we'll see some download content a little bit later on.

745
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
But of course, nothing official yet.

746
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm choking on breath. Yes, I just sounded like a Murloc just then.

747
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Loki, keep talking. It's rude of me to talk with my mouth full.

748
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,000
That's going to be awesome. I'm looking forward to some new Plasmids.

749
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
You like new plasma?

750
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
New Plasmids.

751
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Oh, I thought you said plasma. There's people who recycle their plasma.

752
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
No, new Plasmids for the game. I love this show.

753
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Loki, you know what you should check out if you dig that Drawn to Life is there's a game that nobody knows about for GameCube called Monster Island.

754
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Where you could basically create your own monsters, draw them out on a screen and then play them in various competitions. It was very cool.

755
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Wasn't that like Magic Penjil?

756
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Yeah, they had Magic Penjil and they had Graffiti Kingdom that were also the same type of things.

757
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Yeah, it was cool though. It was good times if you liked that kind of thing.

758
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Magic Penjil, I had a 2DX system that was fighting and we also had popin' music.

759
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Yes, I think people drew a penis monster as well.

760
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
The penis monster was great. I really have to say the penis monster was good.

761
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
My character...

762
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Not that that's, you know, some people don't like that.

763
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:30,000
See, the game is easy to exploit though. My character was just like a teddy bear and I'd draw this big like square that would be attached to it and it would be all blue which would give you like more magic attack or something.

764
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
What was the attack of the penis monster?

765
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
It was like, poke it.

766
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And swing around.

767
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Did it have a similar attack as to a squid? Is that what happened when you poked it?

768
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
It was just, it would just sit and hunch over.

769
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Apparently...

770
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
That's because you weren't doing it right.

771
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Whoever drew the penis monster...

772
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Excuse me, what the fuck were you doing?

773
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It thought that the hair that someone drew on the testicles was actually like legs so it would walk around on legs of this giant thing and it was the worst Pokemon type game ever.

774
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Oh my god. Now that is something we need for the fucking Operator 11.

775
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Yeah, too bad the cam just shut off on Op 11 like 5 minutes ago because we got booted out from time feeds because we can only do 40 minute shows on there but whatever.

776
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:30,000
What was I going to say? Oh yeah, Jason, Webmaster Jason, remind me to mark this episode explicit please a little later. Thank you.

777
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Seriously though, if you can find Magic Penjal or even better, Graffiti Kingdom, that game is really fun especially for 5 minutes.

778
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Oh, it's not fun for 5 minutes. Just, you get your friends over and you're like, you can draw your own characters and give them just time and eventually something perverted is going to come out of...

779
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Yeah, we tried to draw a vagina monster so they could fight but we ran out of ink.

780
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I think we got the...never mind. I was going to get into female anatomy but probably I shouldn't do that.

781
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Let's see, what was I going to say? Mr. DeBucket says, Wangzilla for the win. Also, oh I like this quote from Mr. DeBucket, isn't every GameCube game a game for GameCube that no one knows about?

782
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Aww.

783
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Touche.

784
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Drunami says, I think I still have a save file with a penis monster.

785
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Oh, that's right because that was the day that we had Paper Plate Battle Royale.

786
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Son of Dad is thinking that the movie Superbad, the end credits, is suddenly reminding him of our discussion right now. So, go figure.

787
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Anyhow, moving from penis monster back to Bioshock.

788
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:50,000
God, what can I say about this? Okay, somebody posted on the 2K forums about that basically his brother and him were trying to play the game Bioshock together.

789
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,000
But the game wouldn't let him because as you may know, Bioshock on the PC only limits you to activate your account so many times.

790
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
You only get like five activations for the game and then that's it, you're cut off, no more.

791
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And it's been a very controversial maneuver. But what happened, okay, this guy named 2kTechJT responded,

792
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
there's no other way to view this as one user has purchased the game, not the whole family.

793
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:22,000
So why should your brother play for free? To which everybody goes, hello, hasn't it always been that way?

794
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I mean, if you bring a traditional CD, let's say Xbox 360 or Playstation 2 game home, and everybody gets to use that game, right?

795
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Hello, this is nothing normal. If you buy a CD, everybody in the house...

796
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
How about if he wants his brother to play, how about you just log into your brother's account on Windows and fucking play the game?

797
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Instead of being a little whiny bitch about it, I want to install it on mine!

798
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
There's a certain amount of usage that goes along with it.

799
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I have to say that I don't let anybody else use my computer.

800
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Yeah, but that's just because you're mean. How about you buy a 360 and play it on there? How about that, huh?

801
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
How about that? Why are people whining so fucking much about this shit?

802
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:12,000
If you know you're not supposed to be copying it for your brother and stuff like that, just have him log into your damn account and do it.

803
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Seriously, stop being so fucking lazy and just do what you need to do.

804
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
What you need to do? Rob...

805
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
What? What? What? What?

806
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Anyway, this is a very important update I need to go here. 2K actually reached out to some of the gaming blogs and said,

807
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Just so you know, this 2K Tech JT guy, he's actually not an employee of 2K. He's an outside contractor.

808
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Please note that the forum moderator has been incorrectly quoted as a 2K employee.

809
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:48,000
The individual JT Tech 2K works for an outside tech support group and is not an employee of 2K.

810
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Additionally, 2K is investigating the validity of the post.

811
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I will say this, for all the BS people have been posting all around the internet about Bioshock on the PC,

812
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
2K has done pretty good on their damage control because there's been a lot of companies out there that would have just kept their mouths shut and just said,

813
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Suck it. We don't care. You're buying the game anyway. But hats off to 2K for kind of doing something about all the noise around the internet.

814
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
So, very cool.

815
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Rama would like to say, but Loki, if my account is password locked, I'm not telling it to my brother.

816
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Tough. Your brother doesn't get to play Bioshock now, does he?

817
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I don't really have a little brother or anything that would find, but I would not want them to find my massive porn collection on my computer.

818
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:38,000
And how old is his little brother anyways? I mean, because maybe he's not of age to be able to play the game.

819
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Hmm? Where are the parents? Think of the children?

820
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Yes. Loki from Orange Lounge Radio reminding you to think of the children. Alright, I'm done.

821
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Think of how tasty they are.

822
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Oh my.

823
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Barbecued.

824
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
With, like, asparagus. Asparagus is good.

825
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Hello, gaming story.

826
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Oh yeah, sorry, I was hungry again. You're eating on my breadsticks. That's okay, because they're bread bricks.

827
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
So, for some news regarding, again, more information in the UK,

828
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:31,000
it says that the sales for the Xbox 360 actually have increased, and the PSP is having their worst week since launch.

829
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Poor Sony baby.

830
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:47,000
But at any rate, what they're claiming is responsible for the increase in Xbox 360 sales would be the Elite model, and the other price reductions for the Premium and Core systems,

831
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,000
which are, I guess, making people really, you know, crazy about wanting them.

832
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:05,000
However, with the upcoming launches for the Slim PSP on September 14th overseas, people just still don't care.

833
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Well, I was going to say, without sounding like an ass, I mean, this isn't like, or a fanboy or whatever,

834
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I think this news is only temporary because the Slims are coming out, and because Christmas Hello is right around the corner,

835
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
sales for everything are going to pick up.

836
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Well, we'll see.

837
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
We will see.

838
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Anyways, so, the Xbox HD DVD add-on, I guess, has gotten a price drop in Europe,

839
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
which is good, because everyone wants cheap add-ons.

840
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
It will drop, looks like from 200 euros to 180 euros.

841
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
So, great.

842
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
You get a little bit of a discount, and I do, I'm not sure if it's going on over there as well,

843
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:55,000
but I know over here, once you buy it, you do get a rebate for five free HD DVD movies.

844
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Fuckers. Not when I bought my HD DVD player.

845
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
You know what I got? King Kong. It's still in the wrapping, I just would like to point out.

846
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
You can also get Blu-ray players, too. They're kind of doing the same thing.

847
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
They are desperate for people to adopt the next-gen video formats, but you should be fine.

848
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Do you think they're feeling a little heat, because whether you want to say it's thanks to the PlayStation 3 or whatever,

849
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Blu-ray does seem to be pushing a little more of the market share.

850
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Yeah, but really, they're counting them as players, Blu-ray players,

851
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
but really how many people are actually using them for Blu-ray. That's the thing.

852
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
There is no way of showing that.

853
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Well, yeah, but there is no way of showing it.

854
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I mean, because, yeah, okay, I use mine for Blu-ray movies sometimes, but I can count on one hand

855
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
how many times I've watched a Blu-ray movie on there. I mean, it's not a lot.

856
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I just don't use the system at all.

857
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:56,000
And if I bought an HD DVD player, I don't think I would use it any more than I'm using the Blu-ray player.

858
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I don't know. Personally, I would not buy an add-on for the 360 for any sort of next-gen video format,

859
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
because at least with the PlayStation 3, if Blu-ray doesn't win out, big deal. It's a fucking game machine.

860
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Computer. My mistake.

861
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,000
And if, you know, say, HD DVD doesn't win out, then you're stuck with this fucking external drive

862
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
for, you know, you can't do anything with.

863
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
So, I don't know.

864
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Alright, well, now, one period of time when you're going to have to watch these movies on the HD DVD

865
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:36,000
is a four-hour period between 2 a.m. tonight and 9 in the, or I'm sorry, it actually starts at 2 a.m. tonight

866
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
and runs to 6 a.m.

867
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
That's because Xbox Live is going to be down.

868
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
So, sorry, kids, you're going to have to hold off on yelling the N word and the F-A-G word at each other

869
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
for four hours while the system is down, because that's all people really do on Xbox Live.

870
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Which, by the way, I...

871
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
So, they call each other nice and fancy?

872
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Yes, they call each other nice and fancy.

873
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:13,000
See, you're not helping your hole. You need to call me Casper instead of Big Gay Eddie.

874
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Whatever, Rob, you're just a big silly.

875
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Well, guys, you just fragged me. Wasn't that fancy?

876
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Oh, look at me. I'm on the ground now, all helpless and laid down.

877
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
It would be awful if someone violated me.

878
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Oh, I see you're squatting over and over again above my pelvis. Isn't that nice? Isn't that fancy?

879
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
What the hell is wrong with you, Eddie?

880
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Just because you've been watching what I do on Saturday nights by myself. Don't make fun of me.

881
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Wonder Dog Harold sits in our chat room. Snagglepuss is on Xbox Live.

882
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I can't even talk.

883
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Xbox Live is going to be down. Get over it. By the time most of you downloaded the podcast, it's already done anyway.

884
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
So, we've spent far too long on this useless story. Jamie, please save the show.

885
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I like how Ranma says, Fag, fancy, articulate guys.

886
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Who said that?

887
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Ranma, you're the best. You're awesome.

888
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Why are you talking about a cigarette?

889
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I am a fancy, articulate guy.

890
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,000
So, according to Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry, man, they're old.

891
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I mean, I'm sorry. Aerosmith is really awesome, don't get me wrong.

892
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,000
But it's like, I see really good pictures of all of them and then I see really old pictures of all of them.

893
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
And then I look at Keith Richards and feel better.

894
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:18,000
So, anyway, since they're working hand in hand with the folks behind Guitar Hero 4, and they are going to be, the game is pretty much going to be Aerosmith edition Guitar Hero.

895
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:25,000
So, they told Aerosmith, yeah, it's all going to be about you. Totally about you. Please be in our game.

896
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Well, there will be other stuff, of course, but the hope is that the master tracks are Aerosmith, so that'd be cool.

897
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Okay, I have a bad joke for you guys.

898
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,000
What did Steven Tyler say when Activision asked him to be in the next Guitar Hero game?

899
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
What did he say?

900
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH!

901
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Yes, that was it.

902
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
That's fancy talk.

903
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
That's pretty accurate as being crappy.

904
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Anyways...

905
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I think something was in the breadsticks at this point.

906
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I didn't even eat the breadsticks, Rob, and I'm turning gay.

907
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
You smelled them.

908
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:27,000
So, anyways, if you're interested in checking out Rock Band and you happen to be living in the United States, guess what? They're going to be doing a road tour. In fact, it's going to be touring from Las Vegas and pretty much most of the country, including stopping in California a few times.

909
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I heard they're going to be in Sacramento.

910
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Yes, they are going to be in Sacramento. In fact, I was confirming with our boss that we need to do a road trip if they happen to be down here pretty soon.

911
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Looks like actually in the next couple weeks, the 23rd or 23rd they're going to be in Sacramento, so we'll have to go check it out.

912
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Jamie, are we going to go to the Rock Band show and have some fun?

913
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
No, I'm going to go see They Might Be Giants.

914
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Okay, but it's going to be here for three days. Are you going to see They Might Be Giants for three days?

915
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
No, I'm going to see them for one day, and that's about as much a concert as I can stand.

916
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
It's not a concert, it's a play the game. You make your own concert.

917
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Oh, play the game, I see. Well then, no.

918
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Yes, it's what we do here on this show, Jamie. We talk about playing games, remember?

919
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Well, no.

920
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Well, Loki, will you go to the Rock Band tour with me?

921
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I will definitely go. I'm not sure if it's going to be with you, though, but I will try to make it happen.

922
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Oh, gee, thanks.

923
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Well, sorry, I don't know if I'm going to.

924
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I will definitely go. I probably won't go with you.

925
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I will make a trip out there with you, but I will also make a trip out there maybe with my work.

926
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I will not, on either of those trips, be singing in the game. Fuck that shit.

927
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
If it comes down, well, all we've got left is karaoke for you, Bell. Fuck you, I'm leaving.

928
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I'm sorry, I thought I heard somebody say that they were doing some type of concert for the thing.

929
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Oh, no. You're the concert.

930
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:53,000
No, they basically have this giant semi-truck and there's a stage that they have set up and you play a game.

931
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
You know what? Screw you, Loki. I'll take Gay Eddie with me.

932
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I'll go do it. I'll go play the game.

933
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Rob, I'll go.

934
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Because, Rob, when you sing, it's nice. And fancy.

935
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
We'll be the fancy band.

936
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Oh, my God. We'll be the fancy band boys. Oh, my God.

937
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
No, that's what you should be.

938
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
We are the fancy, articulate guys.

939
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Loki, you're so silly. I love you so much.

940
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
You know what, Sal? We're going to get hate mail.

941
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:32,000
No, because I really am gay, so I don't hate gay people. I mean, if you really talk like that, that's cool. I don't care. It's just funny.

942
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
And then you can film it.

943
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Okay, speaking of Rock Band, there's some new song.

944
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Oh, my God.

945
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
This is one of the most horrible picture-ups I have ever seen on this computer. Is that Courtney Love?

946
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Is that Courtney Love?

947
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Yes, it is.

948
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
That is Courtney Love.

949
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Which, by the way, she'll be making an appearance in Rock Band, you should know. Celebrity Skin by Hole will be in Rock Band, as well as the Yaya Yas maps and the Pixies Wave of Mutilation.

950
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Dude, cool.

951
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I love this song. Garbages, I think I'm paranoid because I love garbage.

952
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
No, the Pixies. That's cool.

953
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
That is pretty rad. I like the Pixies, too.

954
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Now, there's some unconfirmed songs in the game, and these are forum members that are saying this from the Score Hero and Something Awful forums.

955
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:31,000
So take this with a little bit of a grain of salt, but these would be very cool additions to the game. Red Hot Chili Peppers Danny California is rumored for the game, as well as Soundgarden's Black Hole Sun.

956
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
That sucks.

957
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I mean, come on, who does not remember the video to Black Hole Sun back from the days when MTV was cool?

958
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Rob.

959
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Which, by the way, thank you to our live listeners tonight for choosing us over to those Skanky Awards shows that are going on on MTV right now.

960
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Back in the day?

961
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Back in the day, yes. That was my freshman year of college.

962
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Back in the day. How old are you?

963
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Thirty-one.

964
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:02,000
That's right. She's just a fabulously accessorized girl. That's all she is.

965
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Yeah, right.

966
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Anyway, that's all I have to say.

967
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Well, speaking of things, from back in Rob's day, no, I'm kidding. Rock Band is also saying there will be 18 master recordings from The Grateful Dead as downloadable content. Isn't that cool?

968
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Oh, gosh, I hope it has Keep On Truckin' in it.

969
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Truckin' is one, Uncle John's Band, Touch of Gray, Sugar Magnolia, and Casey Jones.

970
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
And my favorite part about the whole thing is they still haven't announced what the price point is going to be.

971
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Didn't they?

972
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:41,000
No, they have never announced price points for download content for Rock Band yet, so people are kind of afraid.

973
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Wimpy people.

974
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
What?

975
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
The ghost guy in our chat room says Jamie is old? She doesn't sound old?

976
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Well, you have to consider this guy's probably 15 or 16 or 18.

977
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Bite my butt.

978
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
But you're young at heart. That's all that matters.

979
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Seriously, the older I get, I realize 30 is not as old as you think. I remember when I was 18.

980
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I used to think that 30 was old because my mom had me really young, so my mom was 30 when I was in high school.

981
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Yeah, my mom was 30 when I was in high school, and I thought 30 was old.

982
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:24,000
And then I saw my friend's parents. I was like, is that your grandfather?

983
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
When I was in high school, my parents were like 60.

984
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I always thought that was so bizarre.

985
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
My mom had me when she was 38.

986
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
My mom had me at 17.

987
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Wow. Ghost guy responded, I'm not going to bite anyone's butt.

988
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I love our chat. That was ghost guy.

989
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Jamie is trying to figure out the whole bathroom situation.

990
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Sorry, guys. We're listening to Jamie try to get in the bathroom. She's yelling at it.

991
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
She went out there and she's like, oh, somebody's in there, and I'm thinking nobody's in there, but I wasn't going to tell her.

992
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Anyways, so, surprise! Guitar Hero 3 on the Wii is not going to have download content initially, but at least it will have online play.

993
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I don't know. They haven't really figured out how to implement download content yet, I guess, on the Wii.

994
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I know. I was going to say, how would they have download content on the Wii? The Wii is not exactly set up very friendly.

995
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I guess there's the Wii Shop channel.

996
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:41,000
And also, where would they store it? There's no storage on the Wii, so they're going to be very challenged to try and figure out how to even do that.

997
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
They just didn't really think when they designed the Wii, did they?

998
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
They're just like, oh, if no one knows the story, who's going to store it?

999
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
No, it's not that, because remember, they were trying to release the Wii for cheap. Remember, they wanted to do it at, what, $99 at first?

1000
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
They wanted to make it a very, very cheap system, so they purposely left all that crap out.

1001
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:09,000
But honestly, though, how much are flash drives? They're not that expensive. I mean, you can easily put a two or four gig drive in there and it wouldn't cost you anything.

1002
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I mean, it's stupid. It really is. Or just support additional storage or something. Ben said, no.

1003
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
You can add memory cards to it.

1004
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Yeah, for saving your save games, but not for anything else. That's it. It's just for save games and maybe virtual console titles and that shit.

1005
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Yeah, but they can't design it so that when you download content that it would go into the memory card?

1006
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
That doesn't seem like it would be that hard for them to design it that way.

1007
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Well, they have to add a patch or something, because right now it doesn't support that.

1008
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Jamie, why did you walk in here and then tell me to die in a boat fire?

1009
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Because you should.

1010
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
That's mean! See, you're mean!

1011
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
You were making fun of me while I was going to the...

1012
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Especially if you die...

1013
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
That's what we do here. We make fun of you when you're not here.

1014
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
If you die in a boat fire, that's pretty pathetic.

1015
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Just kidding.

1016
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
If you die in a boat fire, that would be really awesome and stupid.

1017
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I don't want to die in a boat fire. I'm not going to go on a boat now.

1018
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Is it my turn yet?

1019
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
No, it's not your turn. It's my turn.

1020
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I'm taking my turn to tell you guys that Video Games Live is having a CD release on October 15th.

1021
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
It's their Greatest Hits Volume 1.

1022
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Now, it's actually not a live show.

1023
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
They didn't go around to all these venues and actually tape the songs being played live.

1024
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
But they've actually taken some of these artists into the studio.

1025
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
For instance, Martin Lung, who's the piano player who plays all the songs.

1026
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
They got him to record some of these songs.

1027
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
And they're going to have the CD come out from World of Warcraft, Super Mario, Halo.

1028
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
It's going to be pretty awesome.

1029
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
That is, if you're a nerd.

1030
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:48,000
And it's a rumor, but I believe that each copy is going to come with a lock of Tommy Tallarico's hair.

1031
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Can't confirm that.

1032
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
From his head or his pubes?

1033
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
It doesn't say.

1034
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Maybe the limited edition comes from a different place.

1035
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
That's disgusting.

1036
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Wow, I think I made myself throw up in my stomach.

1037
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Rob, how does your body even work?

1038
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
This is what happens when I'm gone for a week.

1039
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Everything just goes to hell.

1040
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
And Rob throws up in his stomach.

1041
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Which is totally counterproductive.

1042
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I meant to say my mouth.

1043
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Didn't I tell you guys when the show started?

1044
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
That would be like regurgitated feeding.

1045
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Isn't that eating?

1046
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Yeah, no Rob, shut up.

1047
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Have you never heard the expression, you just made me throw up in my mouth a little bit?

1048
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
There you go, that's what I was going for.

1049
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
But for some reason I said stomach.

1050
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I don't know why, I told you guys at the top of the show, I'm broken tonight.

1051
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Aw, poor baby.

1052
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Let's get Rob some duct tape.

1053
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I haven't even had anything to drink.

1054
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
What's wrong with me?

1055
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
I was going to come last week and bring you my really expensive booze from Grease.

1056
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
And it didn't happen.

1057
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
We definitely need to take a break pretty soon because the show is already broken as it is.

1058
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
But we've got one more thing for you guys before we go to a break.

1059
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
And that is the one and only Website of the Week.

1060
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,000
As presented by Dark Sakura who surfs the internet up and down and all around every week to find a website she likes to share with all of you.

1061
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Miss Dark Sakura, where should the kids be pointing their web browsers to this week?

1062
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Somewhere else.

1063
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
No, the Website of the Week is BBC Radio 1 homepage actually.

1064
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I a lot of times really hate the crap that's on the radio over here.

1065
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:42,000
So I will go, you know, turn on the BBC Radio 1 and listen to it.

1066
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I also a lot of times will record the, you know, interviews that go off of there and some of the music specials.

1067
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
You can actually get a lot of good information off there too.

1068
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Just like, you know, if there's other interviews posted, there's your singles charts.

1069
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
You know, you even get in some of the indie stuff that comes through.

1070
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
So I think that's pretty cool.

1071
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
A lot, I think, a different variety of music than what we're used to over here.

1072
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I mean, a lot of it's the same. You know, you got your mainstays, but I think it's pretty cool.

1073
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I like that it's all free streaming radio.

1074
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
And the other good thing about it is that there's a schedule up.

1075
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
So if there's something in particular that you want to listen to, a lot of times it will be up there.

1076
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
You can rewind it too and get back.

1077
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I've actually recorded a number of guerrillas and interviews off of there back in the day.

1078
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Pretty cool.

1079
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Tiger Claw would like to back you up. Tiger Claw says BBC Radio 1 is awesome.

1080
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
The essential mix is the best show.

1081
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I like listening to, I can't think of her name, but she's one of the DJs on there.

1082
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
She really does some good interviews.

1083
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Anyway, very good stuff.

1084
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Do they still play the Spice Girls on BBC Radio 1?

1085
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I don't know. Usually I just block that out.

1086
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I miss the Spice Girls.

1087
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
The sheist girls.

1088
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Eddie, you want to go see the reunion tour with me in San Jose?

1089
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I so want to go, like, so bad.

1090
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Me too!

1091
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Remember, why am I out here?

1092
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:11,000
The very short version is that Irene and I, it was like 3 in the morning, were playing Spice World.

1093
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
I don't know if you guys remember that game from PS1.

1094
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
That game was awful!

1095
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Awful, awful, awful, awesome.

1096
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
We were laughing so hard and it was like 3 in the morning, so of course Rob comes out wagging his finger.

1097
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Why am I out here?

1098
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Because we were being bad and Rob was going to spank us, I don't know.

1099
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Well, never mind. There's another part to this story, but I can't say it, even though the show's already got an explicit tag.

1100
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Let's just say, let's just say they were interrupting something from all their laughing.

1101
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I was very upset.

1102
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I think we need to take a break on the show now, because I don't actually know how much video game content was in tonight's program.

1103
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:57,000
So we will go, and the people responsible for screwing up tonight's program will be sacked.

1104
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
And those responsible for the sacking would like it to be known that they too have just been sacked.

1105
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Alright, so everybody will be sacked during our break, and we're going to come back with a stupendous Part B.

1106
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
It'll be fancy and nice.

1107
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Doing it in a completely different manner and at great expense.

1108
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Because, honestly guys, there's only one way we could probably fuck up this show even more.

1109
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
That's by letting Rob keep talking.

1110
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Well, that would be one. But the other would be is that tonight, and by the way, fuck you.

1111
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
In tonight's Part B...

1112
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Do not want.

1113
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
No, but you do want this. Part B tonight will have the match game.

1114
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
That's right. Nerd match game in Part B tonight. Can't wait for that.

1115
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
So Eddie will be here.

1116
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
That's too much metal for one man.

1117
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Shane will be here, and one more guest. We haven't even...

1118
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Did you point at me when you said Shane would be here?

1119
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
No! No, that means I have to sound really apathetic.

1120
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
May we go to break time now?

1121
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,000
