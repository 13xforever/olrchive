Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
This is Part B of our podcast, taped live on September 9th, 2007.
And a lot of you guys have been giving us some feedback in our forums lately on OrangeLoungeRadio.com, in our forums, that you guys want to see Part B of the podcast a little bit sooner than you're seeing it today.
So you will get the Part B of our podcast a little bit sooner.
Very soon, we're going to change the order in which, well, not the order, but the...
So we get Part B first.
Yeah, you're not going to get Part B first, but we'll change the speed in which we get the podcast out to you guys very soon.
We're going to be making some changes with Episode 250, which is coming up very soon, if you can believe it.
Yikes.
It's very, very soon.
All right.
So let's get back into some gaming news, shall we?
All right.
We shall.
So some interesting trademarks were made from Nintendo.
And of course, some things people wondering what they are, including a Wii body controller, which people are thinking is just the balance board or whatever it was called before because it wasn't the final name.
Another one, Wii Handle, which could possibly be either a new controller or possibly something that has to do with, you know,
your online name or something like that.
Nintendo Magic, which unfortunately is going to be a DS game.
It's to teach you how to do magic.
And Mii Audition, which is supposed to be that everybody votes channel for your Miis.
And then that's it.
Also, they renewed the Pikmin trademark.
So maybe we'll see a new Pikmin game for the Wii.
And
Yeah, so that's it.
I thought a Nintendo Magic is what it's going to take for them to do some more online gaming.
Some magic.
No, actually the game already came out in Japan and it's coming out over here in November.
Well, that's cool.
It's like a teaching you magic game.
All right, very cool.
Well, there's actually a lot of third party stuff going on with the Nintendo Wii.
And this, of course, is if you want to listen to what Satoru Iwata, the president of Nintendo, has to say, quote, I believe that third party publishers kind of look at the software titles that are being sold on Nintendo.
They don't want Nintendo to have more than one third.
Otherwise, Nintendo will be too strong.
They want to have two thirds of what's being sold on the platform.
I believe that the job of first-party software is to drive hardware.
If you don't have a quick impact and a quick dissemination amongst the audience, you lose momentum.
If you don't have momentum, the third parties don't want to jump on your platform.
So that's not a good situation to be in.
It's interesting because a lot of people have been paralleling what's going on with the Wii here to the Nintendo DS, where there wasn't a lot of stuff available for the DS when it first came out.
It took a long time for the titles to really start coming in.
And even Satori Wada...
is aware of this.
Quote,
New, Innovative, Original Content
I guess I can agree with both of that.
And Nintendo, I think, needs to open up a bit more of those little things they like to sit on and then announce later when their own stuff comes out.
Need to make things more available to the other developers, I think.
I would certainly agree with that.
So they need to open up the online stuff a little faster and the DS connectivity, you know, even though I guess they kind of did that with Pokemon.
You know, more.
Open that up a little more.
We need more, please.
Well...
Another very interesting development is that Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, is coming to the Wii in November.
That looks hilarious.
But it's actually being put out by Capcom, and it's going to be, and I quote, a fully animated interactive adventure game.
So maybe it's going to be fun for...
I would like to say I saw that at Comic Con this year, and what little I played of it was really crappy.
Well, then again, Phoenix Wright doesn't really take itself very seriously.
Did you see the pun that they put in the last Phoenix Wright game?
No, I don't play those games.
Oh, they did this as Sparta.
It was like crazy.
Wow, this is totally original.
This is Sparta.
300, I get it.
Anyways, something that is totally original, a game by Square Enix.
That's not featuring any Final Fantasy characters.
Wait, is there any Dragon Quest characters in it?
I don't think so.
Is it Tales of blank?
Blank of Mana?
What is it?
It is a puzzle game.
So... Hooray!
Well, you know what?
You joke about... Urgeis 2, please.
No, it's not Urgeis 2.
That would be...
Pocket Fighter!
DarkTetsuya says, what they don't tell you is that Cloud and Sephiroth are unlockable characters.
That comment coming from our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
Whatever.
Sephiroth, Sephiroth, whatever.
I don't care.
Who cares?
Overplayed.
That's his name.
Overplayed.
and Drew Nami says Tales of Blank is Namco Bandai.
You know, that's true and yet I said it anyway and I knew that.
It's weird.
Like I said, I'm broken tonight, remember?
It's because of all the cocaine you've been doing.
Apparently.
I don't do drugs, that's not cool.
Alright, but what is cool is the virtual console and what's really, really super cool, Donkey Kong Jr.
Math.
You know, I actually had a Donkey Kong Jr.
Math cartridge.
Go figure.
But I saw it for like two bucks once, and I thought, ooh, this will be a collector's item someday.
Yeah, I was wrong.
But anyway, Donkey Kong Jr.
Math has made its way to the Virtual Console this week.
I guess you could say it was part of like a whole back-to-school type thing, because it did come out.
Of course, it's 500 points for Donkey Kong Jr.
Math, which, by the way, way too much money for Donkey Kong Jr.
Math.
Here, I have a suggestion for you guys.
Here's what you should do.
For 500 points or 5 bucks, you could buy Donkey Kong Jr.
Math.
Yeah, that may sound like a good deal for you, but how about this?
Spend just a little bit more money, buy Animal Crossing for the GameCube, and guess what?
Look, you've got a bunch of virtual console games right there.
By the way, Animal Crossing is one of those backwards-compatible games as well, right?
Exactly, and it's probably around 20 bucks right now, if not cheaper.
Goddamn, I can't wait for Animal Crossing Wii.
Even if the DS one was a little bit disappointing because it was kind of the same thing, I really hope they kind of change it up and make Animal Crossing Wii just awesome.
You know what?
I was actually using the Japanese GameCube one as a training tool to help me read better because it doesn't use any kanji except for really simple ones.
And they say, you know how they say every letter?
It still sounds that way, but you can actually hear a little bit more of it like they're actually saying it.
And so I found it to be very educational, and I kind of hope that they'd have a language mode in the release that we get.
I think that'd be a good idea.
You never know, it might happen.
It'd be very cool.
Also, I want to point out what also came out on the Virtual Console.
Adventure Island, which was one of the very first NES games I ever owned.
Adventure Island is also out.
And if you want to hop over to the Genesis, Landstalker, The Treasures of King Gnoll, as well as Bonk 3, Bonk's Big Adventure on the TurboGrafx-16.
Just a note for those of you guys listening on the podcast, this would be last week's releases by the time you guys hear this.
But for our live listeners on Sunday, that's all the stuff that came out for you guys this week.
By the way, also, we have a very important message from SSJ100 Matt in our chat room right now.
Apparently there's one of those character battles going on on GameFacts.com right now.
And it should be noted now, again, this only really will work for those of you guys on Sunday night, but it should be noted that our beloved, one of our favorite game characters of all time, Pyramid Head, is in the running right now in the character battle.
And Pyramid Head needs more votes.
He's up against Aron from Final Fantasy, Chris Redfield from, I believe, Resident Evil, right?
And Shadow the Hedgehog from, of course, the Sonic series.
But Pyramid Head needs your help.
So please go vote for Pyramid Head.
Or else we will send him to your house to rape you.
That's all.
I voted.
Did you vote for Pyramid Head?
I'm very proud of you.
That's all I have to say on Virtual Console.
I have things to say on Virtual Console.
Well, isn't that nice?
It's all Sega.
Sega, Sega, Sega, Sega, Sega, or in this case for the UK, Mega.
Mega Drive Games.
We have Sonic the Hedgehog 3, which is really good.
And then one of my personal favorites, Ghouls N' Ghosts, which is really still freaking hard even to this day, because it's like, let's play Ghouls N' Ghosts, blah, blah, blah, beat Satan.
Oh, I have to play again.
Shit.
So that's, by the way, Ghouls N' Ghosts in a nutshell.
E-SWAT, City Under Siege Shining in the Darkness Crackdown
I really need to go back and play some more Crackdown I remember the Crackdown that came out on 360 a little while ago This is two words, Crackdown Oh, that's an old ass game And maybe it had a different name over here, I don't know Why is it that the folks in the UK get completely different releases?
Why don't they just make it the same for everybody?
You have to save the world from evil cyborgs and then bomb them That's kind of cool
But just to let our listeners overseas know, they are 800 points apiece, translated to 5 pounds 60 and 8 euros.
So, there you go.
Alright, check it out if you're in the UK and need some more virtual console games.
Now to kind of switch gears to something a little different, Square Enix was saying that PlayStation 3 needs their marketing to be straightened up.
And I think basically referring to...
This is kind of going back to the stories we were talking about in Part A where they were calling it a computer, strictly a home media center or something like that.
Because basically according to Wada, he says, Sony first unveiled the PlayStation 3 as a mighty home electronics product.
Then after some badgering from game companies, it shifted the position of the console closer to a game machine.
The future of the PlayStation 3 would be tough if its marketing strategy is not straightened up.
And, you know, to be honest, I can kind of agree with him a little bit.
If you've seen any of the marketing that they've done, you know, in the UK, especially with, you know, This Is Living...
It makes no fucking sense whatsoever.
And even now, I remember the first commercials that came out for the PlayStation 3 with the crying baby doll and weird shit like that.
It made no fucking sense.
Luckily now though, they show gameplay during their commercials and just kind of leave it at that.
That is what they need to be doing.
So it sounds like they're kind of smarting up a little bit, but
My god, do not fucking let the people that did the advertising campaign in the UK get a hold of anything.
In fact, they should all be fired.
Or the people that did the All I Want for Xmas is a PSP.com.
Yeah.
Yeah, all fired.
Good stuff.
They all should be sacked.
And then the people that sacked them will be sacked as well.
And then they'll do them again at great expense with llamas.
All right, well, moving on to something, and now for something completely different, so to speak.
This is how not to be seen.
There was, of course, big announcements in the nerd world this week from Apple.
And Apple is launching, just in time for the holiday season, they are launching all sorts of new crap.
Basically, now they have an iPhone without the phone, which they're calling the new iPod.
They are also releasing a classic iPod, but what should be noted and what the hell this has to do with gaming is a new iPod Nano that's coming out.
The new iPod Nano has a little bit more of a wider screen, and what should also be noted is that not only does the Nano have this, but the classics ship with this as well.
Some games.
Some games will actually be included with these.
The games will be included Vortex, iQuiz, and Klondike.
iQuiz and Klondike, I believe, have been available on the store for a little while.
I think Vortex might have been as well.
Vortex is basically like a 3D version of Arknoid or Breakout, if you will, where basically you move the paddle.
I think that's a pretty creative use of the wheel, is that you actually move the little wheel around, which moves the paddle around.
and it's like Breakout.
You're breaking bricks towards the center of the screen.
So, kind of cool.
I played a whole crap ton of Arkanoid back in the day.
Yeah, back in the day.
It's kind of interesting, and it brings to note that especially with the release of the iPod without the phone or whatever you want to call it, it's kind of interesting that Apple does seem to be sticking their foot in there a little more and more with this whole gaming thing.
And I don't think it's time to say, like, OMG, Apple's going to release a gaming console because we all remember Pippin.
But I think that it's interesting to see, especially when it comes to… You remember the Pippin?
Yeah.
I've completely shoved that out of my head.
I think it would be interesting to see what kind of happens with the whole, like, you know, especially with, like, classic games.
I was just telling you.
The sandwich smells.
Get it out of here.
Mmm, sandwich.
Sorry, Eddie.
You can come back when the sandwich is gone.
Here's an old system name that will make you laugh, Rob.
What's that?
GameCom.
Wow.
I have one.
Really?
Yes.
Then again, I also had an N-Gage and we gave it away.
You have a lot of weird consoles.
You also have a lot of weird emails this week, I bet.
Oh, God.
Always invite our listeners to email us at our website, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
I want one of these, Rob.
And send us some emails.
This is adorable.
What things?
I want one of these iPod things.
Which ones?
The little one with the square looking one.
The Nanos?
Is that the Nano?
I actually kind of want an iPhone.
Yeah, that's a nano.
That's cute.
I actually kind of want an iPhone now that they dropped in price.
We'll save that another day.
Let's do the e-mails.
Mailbag at originalsradio.com.
DarkSakura will now open up the mailbag and read a few of her favorites.
At least I'll read a few of the ones that actually have substance to them.
And I'm sorry, Misty, I did get both of yours, and I'm very sorry that you have to work.
Really sorry.
This one's from our friend Rob with two Bs.
I read in Nintendo Power the next version of Williams Classic Pinball will include Gorgar, the first talkie, Black Knight, which inspired David's Midnight Magic, and Pinbot.
Hooray!
I'm hoping for Z and B to be the flippers for the nunchuck.
And my two bits on Space Giraffe.
Bit 1.
I love the arcade's style play in similarity to Tempest 2000.
Bit 2.
The blurry visuals are sort of low-res and the game's LSD-inspired visuals seem to be their
I bought it, but I haven't really played it much.
Boredom get.
And one last topic, PS3 pricing.
The original price was intended for the hardcore gamer.
Not many people wanted it.
It was priced too high for resale on eBay, and it was readily available in mid-December.
Did Sony effectively kill the third-party market for initial PS3 games?
Did they actually get the money that the eBayers would have gotten?
It's an interesting thought because the answers to both seem to be yes.
They still didn't stop the stabbings and shootings, but I don't blame them for that.
See you later, Rob Bubba.
I like hearing from Rob.
It's been a little while, so.
I actually am really looking forward to this whole pinball game that's going to be on the Wii that we talked about at the very beginning.
Like, pinbot and stuff.
I would like to see a type of reincarnation of the old school pinbot on the NES as an optional mode where you could actually have the little aliens come out on the table and try to eat your ball and all the crazy shit they had in the NES version of the game.
You know what?
What?
Right now our NES is hooked up with Pinbot in it.
That is rad.
Of course, also hooked up to the same receiver is our PS2 with Guitar Hero.
Nice.
Yeah, anyway.
Many greetings, Orange Lounge Radio.
I'm a big fan of your show.
No, it's not that I like your show a lot.
It's just that a lifetime of Doritos has made me very big.
Wait, who is this?
I'm only joking.
Mr. Patch.
Oh, okay.
I love your show, but for about three months I lost you.
No, not really.
And I understand it's not the best game for some hardcore gamers, but for me, Banjo-Kazooie really turned me into the gamer I am today.
Anyways, finally my question.
Do you think Microsoft will push Banjo-3-E when its release date comes near, or will it be a quiet release like some of the other Rare games?
Thanks for taking the time to read this email, and thanks even more if you answer my question with curse words.
Love, HeyMrPatch.
Well, fuck!
Listen here, you little fucker.
Yeah, I'm not the biggest fan of these games, but I think Microsoft will realize that there is a fan base for the games.
Guys like you, you know.
And I think they will, for that reason, definitely try to get it out there that, hey, it's back.
Banjo-Kazooie comes back.
And I think you will see a little bit of a marketing campaign like that.
I don't think it's going to be near the size that you would see for one of their AAA titles, but I don't see any reason why I won't get
Some notability.
I don't think it'll be a quiet release by any means.
There you go.
I think of Banjo-Kazooie, and for some reason I always think of Pandemonium.
Do you remember that game, Rob?
Um, no.
Pandemonium was a side-scrolling, very bizarre game, but I actually have the Japanese version of it, which was Magical Hoppers, and they re-pixeled it or whatever, and...
But I don't know why, but it's always one of those... I always think of those very early PlayStation 1 games and the early Nintendo games and every game that's come out since then that's in that franchise, like Spyro.
I always lump them into that one category that I label, why God, why?
SSJ100 Matt in our chat room at chat.org.com says, Fuck Banjo, give me a new fucking Killer Instincts.
Why so much love for Killer Instincts?
Because I've also seen people with a lot of hate for Killer Instinct.
Keep in mind, I played a shit ton of the first Killer Instinct when it... Or if I'm going to go give my homage... How many pounds in a shit ton?
I'm going to give my homage to Don French right now.
I played crock shits of Killer Instinct when I was in college.
And KI2 was very exciting to me when it came out because...
Except that I hated that they changed all of Orchid's moves, but it was very, very cool for me, and even to the point where Dan had it on his Super Nintendo when I lived here, well, when I lived in Alabama, to the point that he kept starting over and over until it started off with Orchid's level so he could copy the music for me.
Isn't that romantic?
That's very sweet.
Anyway, next email.
Aw, barf.
Combo breaker, next email, please.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oi, peeps.
This is Nosoulboy.
Alcohol and Tylenol can kill you.
Prime 3.
Oh yeah, you weren't here last week.
I was actually, you want to know what I did last week?
It was my anniversary.
Were you seeing Weird Al?
I did more than that.
On Friday night, Dan and I hung out and did stuff.
Well, actually I hung out online and talked to people and then Dan and I did a couple of things.
Saturday we went to Benihana.
and I drank a lot and Sunday I cracked open my bottle of Metoxa which I was going to bring over and you said you were sick so I was like I don't want to get sick not on my anniversary so I said I'm not going to hang out with Bob
It wasn't contagious, whatever it was.
It's gone, thank God.
Rob had the rocket pneumonia and the boogie-woogie flu.
Here's the thing, and I do want to apologize if I came off like an idiot, but I did say something about I'd been taking Tylenol because I was sick, and I was drinking because I don't care.
And I said something like, it's not going to kill me.
Here's the thing.
Obviously, if you drink a lot and you take a lot of Tylenol, yes, that can kill you.
I'm not stupid.
And I've seen a lot of kids do a lot of stupid things, unfortunately, in my lifetime.
But here's the thing.
A little tiny bit.
It wasn't that much Tylenol.
It really wasn't.
It wasn't that much liquor I drank last week either.
I think little bits, like a lot of things, moderation is okay.
Overdoing it, not okay.
So, the more you know, NBC.
There you go.
Can I finish with an email now?
You may.
Prime 3, you can die if you don't kill Meta Ridley in time.
Yes, I suck, but give me a break.
Second Wii game I ever played.
I'm a Mac lover, but iPhones are for people with too much money and too much to do.
Finish Bioshock.
That part that scared me was when the Spicers started playing dead.
Oh, and also the huge room with the water on the floor and the plaster-covered ballet dancers are very creepy.
I listen to your podcast and game theory.
As a designer, I'd really like to hear more about excellent game design as opposed to graphics or effects.
For instance, on the DC Phantasy Star Online's UI and menu system, amazingly fluid and functional during gameplay.
Hell yes!
That was one of the biggest things that I hated about Phantasy Star Universe is that the menus in Phantasy Star Online were so much freaking better.
Okay, so I'm going to keep going.
or for anyone who's ever played a squad game to compare it to the four player action in Crystal Chronicles on GameCube.
People started working together in a way that is just genius and it's totally obvious that it was the intent of the designers.
Or how about most of the games by Treasure?
A freaking men.
Talk about walking out on a limb and creating amazing experiences.
These games are perfect arguments for the game as art debate.
You know what?
Treasure is just... Okay, Treasure gave us
Ikaruga.
They gave us Bangayo.
I love Bangayo.
Oh my god.
The game is so cool.
They gave us Silhouette Mirage, which is just... It was... When it came out, it was like something nobody had ever seen.
No one had ever seen anything like that before.
Even that dorky little chameleon twist game was cool.
I mean, Treasure is all about the innovation in gameplay.
Another game that you're talking about having people work together is Pac-Man vs...
Where you have three people on individual game... S, it's GBAs actually.
Or a Game Boy SP because of the connector that they use for it.
But they control the ghosts and you have your person as Pac-Man.
You know, I gotta hand it to the GameCube.
Those games that had the connectivity between the DS and the GameCube were a heck of a lot of fun.
Like the Four Swords Adventures.
I had a lot of fun playing that game with some of my friends.
It's kind of a shame because you see that potential...
Thanks for watching!
Yes, Eddie's back.
Hey, I'm back.
Yeah, no, I agree because what I was thinking is a lot of those games would be cool is if the DS was like a device in the game and like it was like a spy sort of espionage game.
Like you would get like secret messages on your DS or something like that and it would, you know, light up or something like that.
I think that'd be cool.
Like you're saying more like make it more like reality, you know, just make it really interactive with the game.
I think it'd be awesome.
You know what else I thought was cool, kind of speaking of that, was that whole, you know, in a red steel, like, you could, you'd put the Wiimote up to your ear, because it has a speaker in there, and it would tell you what your objective was, like, hey, you need to kill player three or whatever it is.
That was lame.
It sounded cool, but it was lame.
I know.
Unfortunately, the game turned out to be kind of dumb, but I think the idea was good, and I can recognize that that was, you know, especially for a launch title, that was a pretty neat usage of the stuff.
Because they could do that like if the phone's ringing in the game or something, like you put the Wiimote up to your ear or something like that and press A, and then it's like they're talking to you on the phone.
That'd be cool.
Well, you can do that in WarioWare.
That's one of the mini games.
Yeah, you pick up the phone, and then you hear it coming out the speaker and the Wiimote.
Hello, hello.
It's really funny.
That kind of little shit goes a long way.
I love it.
So there you have it.
All right.
Sorry.
That's my response to the email.
I don't even know if that's what they were looking for, but there you have it.
Um, okay.
I'm adjusting.
Wedgie?
No.
This chair's like sitting on, it's like the princess and the pea.
You know, where you've got, hey!
What?
I'm asking where I'll be in Tylenol.
It's in the bathroom.
Yeah, I believe I do.
Yes, I'll go show you where the Tylenol is while Jamie reads more emails.
Look at the left side of the cabinet.
This chair's like the princess and the pea, you know, where you have all this cushion, but you feel that one little lump that's like, I can't sit in this chair.
That's it.
Okay, princess, next email.
Hi to you, O'Reilly folks.
Wave.
Anyway, I went to Project Revolution Tour here in Chicago, and me and my friend got there around 1.30.
I found out the band I really wanted to see, Linkin Park, wasn't playing until 9.30.
So me and my friend hung out and walked around for a few hours, and then we saw...
MSI and that was cool now upon walking around I discovered a tent that had two long banners that just had three on them and believe 92507 at the bottom you know so I was like do one and asked the two guys standing there if I could go in they said that it was a private party after this I just kind of listened hard as much as you can at a rock concert and I heard the distinctive noise of shields recharging I knew I had to get in
That was before as Mindless Self-Indulgence.
Okay, I was like, hey, that's a band I like.
Now, fast forward to the end of the MSI show.
I went back to find the tent open with quite a few people inside.
I stood there with a few other people and knew I was going to get in somehow.
Unfortunately, one guy gave out three passes to three people around me.
I stuck around, though, and saw none.
Okay.
Oh.
None other than Jay Wineland, I guess that's... I don't know if this is misspelled.
The head sound designer for Bungie.
I pointed to him and said, Hey, you're Jay, right?
The sound guy.
And he just nodded in a smile and says, Wow, that was good.
Kind of creepy, but good.
And disappeared for a sec.
And then he came back with a pass for me to get in.
I was all happy, got his autograph, and went and played.
Let me tell you, Narrows is going to be a classic map.
This is about Halo 3, by the way.
Seriously, the build he had wasn't final, but you could tell it almost was because the fourth grenade was up there.
Unfortunately, all we had were the following maps.
High Ground, Valhalla, Snowbound, Narrows, Epitaph, Last Resort, and Sand Trap.
One thing I loved about the game overall, everything was colorful.
I don't mean like bright colors everywhere, but it was just vibrant.
I couldn't see clearly 100% of the time, but unlike in Halo 2 where I have to turn the brightness up a ton, it looked much better than Gears of War.
Anyway, I didn't see much new stuff.
I really did get to see a game of Infection Slash Zombies, though, which I didn't quite understand.
Weird shrug.
So around 7.30 to 8 o'clock or so, Mike, Rob, and Joe from Linkin Park walk in and just sit down and start playing.
Everyone in the room outside who didn't get in was all OMG for a while, and people just sat down and played.
I totally kicked their butts.
Mike and Joe, the rapper and DJ, were pretty good, and you could tell Rob, the drummer, doesn't play much.
I hung around Rob, got his autograph as well, and Mike Slater.
But Rob was there.
As long as I don't get last place, I'm good.
And he didn't.
He did pretty good.
Oh, and that was pretty much the highlight of my summer and definitely the best concert I've ever been to.
Here's any pictures of the event.
So I will actually save this email so that we can put this up on the website.
How's that sound?
Rad.
Yeah, you should put the pictures up because I was actually looking at that email earlier this week.
And that's from Sycoon, by the way.
That's our buddy, Sycoon.
Good job, Sycoon, with your field reporting.
More emails.
Yes.
Hey, OLR crew.
There are quite a few new games coming out that are being reported as having short play times.
Heavenly Sword, for example, is just six to ten hours.
Now, I don't have a problem with short games, but I do have a problem with paying 60 bucks for them, so I decided to join Gamefly to rent those shorter games and play them through without the heavy cost.
Okay, wow.
Um...
You know what?
Blockbuster didn't kill the movie industry.
And Netflix certainly hasn't damaged it either.
So why would Gamefly kill the games industry?
Because Gamefly still has to buy all those games from the publishers to get out to rent.
It all depends on how you see it.
I'm sure the publishers don't like Gamefly, but there's nothing really they can do about it.
I mean, because, I don't know, one argument you could say, well, people are just going to rent games and they're not going to buy them.
So we want people buying our games, not renting them.
But in the other hand, though, people rent the game, like it, and then maybe buy it.
Yeah, make a game worth buying and people will buy it.
Right?
Because how many times... I mean, seriously, that's what it boils down to.
How many people... I mean, I know I did this when I was a kid all the time.
I would rent a game and I would love it so much.
I'd be like, Mommy, Mommy, buy it for me for Christmas.
And she would because she loved me.
At least that's what she told me.
To my face.
So there you go.
Yeah, it's your face behind your back.
Anyway.
Hey OLR, I know you guys have been looking for someone who doesn't like Bioshock.
And even with my praises sung a few episodes ago, I've made your complaint about the game after getting the retail version.
It's far too dark and things that are shooting at you are impossible to see because they're either too far away and have deadly aim or you can't see them because the whole place is freaking dark.
Has anyone else had this problem?
I can't be the only one.
The story is going to keep me going through the game though, it's very intriguing.
Cheers and keep up the podcasting, AZHP
I really want to hear... I mean, that was a good email.
But I really want to hear from people that, like, fucking hate Bioshock.
But not just because I said so.
Like, I really want to hear a really good counterpoint to the whole, you know, everybody loves Bioshock.
There's always somebody that does... I mean, there's two sides to every story.
So somewhere on the internet, there is somebody that hates Bioshock for a good reason.
I want to know why, and I want to know that reason.
I did see something like that on Kotaku.
It was from...
The consumerist, I want to say.
But was it somebody just trying to be funny?
I don't know if they were trying to be funny.
Because I think I saw something.
It was just somebody trying to be funny.
Like, it wasn't real.
You know, I want to hear some real, like, I hate Bioshock and this is why.
Please.
And the last email is actually, wow, kind of long.
Read a snippet.
Well, it's mostly suggestions for games to do on the show, so I'm going to skip down to the actual gaming part.
To make this email a little more video game related, I'm a Wii PS2, is it Wii S2?
Owner that just is about ready to pounce on the Xbox 360.
Now the premium has HDMI and a price cut.
And so I've already waited this long.
Should I wait a little bit longer until the Falcon 65NM chips come out?
or with the 3 year warranty should I just finally pick one up?
A friend of mine just picked up an Xbox 360 Premium without the HDMI and it died within a week and not with the red rings of death.
Any game played would instantly lock up after 5 minutes of turning the system on and it wasn't in a cramped cabinet either.
Makes me a little tentative about getting one with the hotter 90nm chips or if it does have the extra heatsink.
Since it's not Red Wings of Death and not covered in the extended warranty, although you're still able to take it back to the store, this got long still ended here by hailstorm in our forums.
XBOX 360 Now or Wait Here's the deal
I honestly think it'll be, I mean, maybe they'll do a little tiny chipset switcheroo, but I don't think it'll be that big a deal.
The games they're putting out now, I mean, any game they put out is going to be designed to run flawlessly on the, well, if all the testing is done the way it should be, to run as best as it can on the consoles that are out now.
So I wouldn't worry so much about waiting for a chipset.
And here's the thing, if you're waiting for price reduction, new package or whatever, ain't going to happen for a year, until next Christmas season, or at least well after Christmas.
So I would say unless you're prepared to wait six months for some significant changing in the structures, price, offerings of the 360, just go get one now.
Honestly, as long as you document, I think, whatever happens.
We've actually only had to return one system, but I think that we did it through the store itself.
And we've actually got the Elite now, Dan and I do, and we've never had a problem.
and if you're also worried about that whole oh I went out and got an iPhone oh shit they just dropped the price by 200 bucks I got screwed don't worry that won't that won't happen yeah I get well I guess now they're doing the hundred dollar you know rebate or whatever but still I I know some people who bought an iPhone that weren't happy when they heard that announcement I know I'm sure I know who you're referring to several people I know weren't happy but yeah well um
Oh, shoot, I was going to say something else about the Xbox 360.
Oh, yeah.
I, though, have not seen what the HD movies look like on the Xbox 360, but I have seen an HD movie, and I kind of like Blu-ray better.
I hate to say it.
The quality is exactly the same.
Sound.
Sound.
Am I the only one that's not that intensely excited about this next gen of video?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and you know when they start making HD, DVD and Blu-ray porn, you are so there in the next generation of video.
They already have that and I'm not so there.
Rob, we still need to see Pirates.
Oh, don't they have Pirates on HD?
And Blu-ray.
It's on both.
I think I'm going to get the Blu-ray.
I used to work at a video store and people would be like, you know, I want to return this movie because when I pause it, I couldn't see the picture and it's like, okay.
Okay, listen.
I do have HD porn.
I stream it to my 360, because thank you, Media Center Extender.
But, you know what, Black Boy, that's what Black Boy says in chat.
Black Boy says, who goes out and buys porn discs?
It's all download today.
Here's the thing, no, I'm not saying I'm going to go buy the porn discs.
I'm just someone who buys a lot of porn.
Here's the thing, though.
I'm waiting for the discs to come out, so someone can rip them and put them on the internet, and then I can download them.
See?
Wow, you really need to get out.
I mean, seriously, this stuff's out there already.
For the record, the only reason I have a Blu-ray player is because we actually bought a PS3.
I'm not saying it's horrible.
I'm just saying, I'm not saying it's horrible.
I'm just like, I'm not that, I was like really, really wanting to get a DVD when they came out, DVD player.
And I'm not, I'm like, eh, you know, I can wait until they battle it out between HD and Blu-ray.
I'm sort of thinking about if I did buy a new computer, I think the next one I get will be a VAIO because all the new VAIOs come out with Blu-ray players.
Hmm.
And they cost the same that my old one did when I got it new.
Hmm.
Or meh.
Meh.
Is that it for emails?
Yes, Rob.
That's it.
Bye, mailbag.
All right.
Now what?
Back into some news.
Yes, news.
So, anyways, this is not surprising, but it's actually pretty cool.
Manhunt 2 has leaked out online, and that would be the uncensored beta from European regions, because it is in PAL format.
So, of course, everybody's been jumping on the bit to actually play it.
No word if it plays well or not, because it is beta, but I'm definitely going to find out.
Ew, MrDeBucket in chat says Manhunt 2 has neck raping.
Is that true?
That's gross.
I don't know, but I heard there's something about ripping off testicles.
It sounds awesome.
Eddie just covered his balls in the studio.
That game sounds great.
I cannot wait to play this on the Wii.
If you're a woman, it's coming to the Wii.
Oh my god.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That's not a fucking joke.
That's gross.
What if someone has a tracheotomy?
Ew, you want to fuck somebody's hole instead of tracheotomy?
No!
I was trying to think, how would that work?
And I would think that it would have to either be someone with their head chopped off or a tracheotomy.
That would be a two-part explicit episode this week.
Congratulations, crew.
You've done good.
I'm so glad you're not holding a microphone right now and that Op 11 is down.
That's wrong.
Wow.
Anyway.
Anyway.
The guy who directed Doom is directing the new Street Fighter movie and it's probably going to be just as shitty as the old one.
The end.
Yeah, I think that about says it.
I mean, gosh, there was an awful lot of internet articles about it, but I think Jamie summed it up very well.
There you go.
Yep.
I'm brilliant.
I really hope they don't destroy some guy's wonderful movie career and then that guy dies, kind of like Raul Julia.
His last movie role was M. Bison, you know?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You know what?
Forget the story.
When I can't talk for an entire night, I get angsty.
And that means it's FUs of the Week time.
FUs of the Week time.
Start off with DarkSakura.
FU goes to my sinuses.
FU goes to my toilet.
We've had this clog in our pipes.
What happens is that it makes the toilet back up, or it backs up sewage into our tub.
And it sucks.
So our landlord came out and was digging around the pipes trying to fix it today.
I hope it's fixed by the time we get home.
Yes, you can say an F you to a video game company, Eddie.
F you to LucasArts for saying, we're considering making a game for the Wii.
I'm like, fuck you!
I mean, oh my god, this is like the best system ever.
And then like, LucasArts is awesome and they need to get out their ass and stop thinking about it and actually make a game for the Wii.
So fuck you, LucasArts.
I should say, Eddie is an unapologetic Nintendo fanboy, right?
Exactly, exactly.
Has a Sony or Microsoft product or Sega product that manner ever been in your house?
Never.
Fanboy.
Alright, Loki.
Uh, fuck you, the crappy pizza.
Especially at John's Incredible Pizza, because it was not incredible, it was incredibly crappy.
Although, props to that- It probably gave you incredible diarrhea, too.
No, it did not give me incredible diarrhea, but it was just like, it was like, wow, I can tell you spent a lot of money on this.
What, there's a whole, like, two pepperonis on this pepperoni pizza they have?
I mean, seriously.
It's just, it was pretty lame, but, uh, whatever.
Whatever.
I want to give an F you first off to my voice, because apparently I can't talk at all tonight.
It's really ruining the show for me.
And then I just want to give an F you to people that start out really nice, like they want to be your best friend in the world, and like, you know, oh, I love you, and da-da-da, and then they turn into a total psycho host beast.
I'm not talking about you, Jamie.
Although you've done that too.
No, no, no.
I'm talking about work-related situations.
I actually was actually... You said that and I started thinking about somebody.
What?
I'm not going to say anyone here.
Oh.
I can probably think about it, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know who you're talking about.
Alright.
Haha.
OLR rumors you guys will never know about.
So that's all I wanted to say.
F you too.
Anyways, so, EverQuest.
Yeah, that wonderful game, EverQuest.
EverQuest 1 and 2 have added a brand new card game called Legends of Norath.
And, yeah, I guess it's going to be the Oathbound series will feature 375 cards in a 55-card starter deck for $9.99 and 15-card booster packs for $2.99.
And the game is playable from EverQuest 1 or 2, although there will be a standalone client due out for free in September, actually this week, on Wednesday.
So, I don't know.
Just trying to cash in, I guess, on the collectible card games.
And EverQuest, it's such a, you know, new product.
I don't know.
These MMOs last forever.
I mean, if you think about it, Final Fantasy XI is five years old, if you can believe it.
So these MMOs last forever.
They really do.
Alright.
Anyway, speaking of MMOs online... I have a comment.
What?
Yes.
How old is Final Fantasy?
Five years.
Just old enough to be raped now.
What is wrong with you? !
You missed our discussion on neck raping earlier.
Really?
Thank you for punching him.
That's what you get for watching Battlestar Galactica during this show.
Now stay quiet until the next year's segment, alright?
Fine.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and some new storylines are being added into the game.
And of course, Myst Online is a part of GameTap.
So if you're a GameTap subscriber, you get access to Myst Online.
I played Myst Online for like three days, but I found it to be really... Like, I didn't know what the hell I was doing.
Like, there needs to be a little more... Like, even though I thought it was cool, they had like live actors that actually did like introductions, initiations.
I just wish there had been a little more like, what the fuck do I do with this game?
Like, kind of like talk.
So, that's all.
But otherwise, I thought Myst Online was actually a really good looking game.
And you...
8th Birthday of the Dreamcast 8th Birthday of the Dreamcast
8 years.
Wow.
That's not very long when you consider how long ago the Dreamcast was out.
They brought us, though.
We had Power Stone, Bongaio, Ikaruga, Choo Choo Rocket, Soul Edge, Soul Calibur, Good Stuff, Rez, Shenmue,
and the fact that you could hack it to play Nintendo games.
Oh, you didn't even really hack it.
It would just burn you out.
Dreamcast.
Dreamcast was cool.
And they had a Pepsi Man game.
And the Dreamcast love is still out there because there's still a bunch of shit being made for it.
Not a bunch.
It's still awesome.
I love the Dreamcast.
So there you go.
I have two of them because I stole Matt's.
I have two Dreamcasts as well.
I need that back.
All right, Logie.
All right, kids.
Guess what time it is.
Burrito Day!
No, it's not Burrito Day.
That's tomorrow.
It's time for one of our favorite segments here on Orange Lounge Radio.

Good job.
All right, everybody else can shut up now.
Stop saying me.
All right, so I'm going to send GS68 a message.
You win.
Okay, there we go.
So he'll stand by there.
All right, now let me explain how this works.
Raven's Dolphin, do you know how the video game match game works?
I know how to play the match game, and I'm familiar with the rules, yes, but I can go over them like normal, like a dream reaper.
DarkSakura,
and Loki.
Hello.
And you haven't heard her yet tonight, but she is here, folks.
Rice Princess, our surprise lady tonight.
It's got to be awesome.
All right.
Raven's Dolphin's excited.
Are you a fan of Rice Princess?
I like Rice Princess.
All right.
That was a little creepy.
You might want to get a restraining order.
Get one of those nanny cams in your house.
Make sure no one comes in.
All right.
Are you guys ready?
Let's get some music because it's time to play the match game.
I love this theme song.
It's one of the best theme songs ever made.
Yes, it is.
It's fantastic.
All right, here we go.
Are you ready for question number one?
I'll try.
GS68, you're going to send us your answer over private message, okay?
And Raven Stolfen, you get to... Verbally say it.
Verbally say it, but not until I say when, okay?
You have to vocalize your reply.
Yes, here it is.
Here's the first question tonight, folks.
Rob is very excited about the Heroes Season premiere happening in a couple of weeks.
He's blocked the time on his calendar, paid the cable bill for this month.
All he has to do to be completely ready is go out and buy a blank.

Thank you for watching!
because you asked for it.
Lordy.
All right.
Does everybody have their answer in their mind?
Do you have a new answer in your mind?
I think of one.
And say ding when you thought of one.
All right.
He's thought of one.
Good.
All right.
Here we go.
Let me see.
Make sure GS68 has an answer.
Okay.
There you go.
And Raven's Dolphin, do you have an answer?
Tyvo.
Okay.
Raven's Dolphin says Tevo or Tyvo.
Okay.
Tybo?
Tybo?
It's a TiVo.
All right, here we go.
All he has to do to be completely ready is to go out and buy a TiVo.
That's what Raven's Dolphin says.
And GS68 says all he has to do is go out and buy an HD Porn.
HD Porn.
All right, let's see what happens.
Let's go around and see if any of the celebrities have matched.
Loki, what did you get?
Funny enough, I was going to say Pleasure Glove, but...
Was that it?
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
Pleasure Club.
There you go.
I was like, where's the punchline?
All right.
I forgot.
He's not funny.
DarkSakura, what did you say?
A life-size standee of George Takei.
A life-size... That's a good answer.
I love George Takei, but not a match.
I haven't really watched any except for when they took the sword, but I know that George Takei is in it, and he's awesome.
He is awesome.
That was a good answer.
My answer would be he forgot to go out and buy a blow-up Siler doll.
because Siler is gorgeous.
What, with extra brain-eating action?
Yes, because Siler is so hot.
Okay, Shane, what did you say?
He needs to go out and buy... A bottle of lube.
A bottle of lube.
Not a match.
All right, Eddie, he needs to go out and buy a... Copy of George Takei's movie, Blowed Up.
Oh, my.
Wow.
All right, Rice Princess says he needs to go out and buy...
I just stuck with the requisite.
Prostitute.
Prostitute.
All right.
So let's add it up and look at the scoreboard.
Ah, yes.
It is.
Oops.
No.
And we've been canceled, ladies and gentlemen.
The show's over.
Good night.
What did I do?
Maybe I went too far with the prostitute comment.
This show is so broken tonight.
I want a refund.
All right.
Just like my Xbox.
Yes, going back to the scoreboard, it is 0-0.
Look at that.
All right, good job.
0-0.
All right, shall we go to the next question?
Yes.
Are you going to make a better effort this time, Raven's Dolphin?
I'm trying.
I know you're trying your best.
I appreciate it.
Okay, here's question number two.
Question number two.
Loki went out to the arcades today to try out some of the new games in town.
When he drove up to Roseville Golf Land to find that they were closed though, he was very upset.
He was inspired, however, to make an awesome new video game called Blank.
Loki went out to the arcades today to try out some of the new games in town.

Ding.
Double ding.
Ding.
Okay, everybody in studio has said ding.
How are you doing?
Do you have an answer yet?
Don't say it yet, but do you have an answer yet, Raven's Dolphin?
No, but give me just two more seconds.
I'm trying to think of a new thing.
One, two.
All right.
All right, two seconds are up.
GS68 has an answer.
Do you have an answer?
Yeah.
All right, here we go.
He invented... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't say it yet.
We're not ready for it yet.
I have to read the question and ask you for your answer.
Shh.
Can I have some silence in the studio, please?
Silence.
Loki went out to the arcades today to try some of the new games in town.
When he drove up to Rosso Golf Land to find out they were closed, though, he was very upset.
He was inspired, however, to make an awesome new video game called Raven's Dolphin.
He called Drunken Cart Racer.
Drunken Cart Racer.
Okay, good show reference.
Thinking back to the last time Loki was at Rosal Goblin.
All right, GS68 said, Beat Mania 2DX16, George Takai.
This is the game that's going to be made.
So there you go.
All right, let's see what happens.
Loki, he's going to make a game called...
Mini Golf Course Tycoon.
Mini Golf Course Tycoon.
That's a fun game.
So I too can suck at running a mini golf course just like Golf Land.
All right, DarkSakura, he's going to make a game called?
Because it's Loki, I said Iraqi Suicide Baby Bombers.
Iraqi Suicide Baby Bombers, a reference to 200 episodes ago.
All right, my answer is, and you have to know what Roseville Golf Land looks like for this to make sense, but I was going to call it Castle Crashers 2.
Blizzerclaw Battle!
Oh my...
and Rice Princess.
The game is called... Yeah, I didn't have any ideas so I'm just going to stick to Cylon Occupied Caprica.
Cylon Occupied Caprica.
Occupried?
Occupied Caprica.
All right, there it is.
All right, let's go to the scoreboard and take a look.
Oh, okay, we have zero to zero.
Good job.
Oh, Rob, let's be nice and give them something each equally worthless.
All right.
Like, you know, a Fairchild Channel F for GS68 and an N-Gage for... A fart in a Ziploc bag.
Why would I want an N-Gage?
All right.
An N-Gage with no SIM card.
I got a SIM card.
What's the difference?
One more question.
What?
Yes, we have one more question.
Now, I hope somebody gets on the scoreboard or everybody loses, which is a familiar theme here for the video game match game.
All right, here it is, our last question for tonight.
Jamie borrowed Dan's camera for the awesome OLR photo shoot today.
What Dan doesn't know, however, is that after the show is over, Jamie will be using the camera to take some pictures of Blank.
Um, ding.
Have a mutual ding.
Alright, I think everybody in studio has mostly said ding.
Okay, GS68 has dinged.
Have you dinged too, Raven's Dolphin?
I'm dinging.
Alright, grats.
Alright, here we go.
Let's see.
Let's go to Raven's Dolphin, you first for an answer.
Here's the question.
Jamie borrowed Dan's camera for the awesome OLR photo shoot today.
What Dan doesn't know, however, is that after the show is over, Jamie will be using the camera to take some pictures of...
Doctor Who Nude Doctor Who Nude Okay, good answer, good answer Especially if you know Jamie And GS68 said, taking some pictures of Ferret Porn Ferret Porn Alright, let's see if there's a match with anybody in studio Let's go around, start it off with Loki Take some pictures of This goes back to, I think part B still Neck Raping
Neck raping, unfortunately, is not a match.
DarkSakura, take some pictures of?
I actually said the doctor.
The doctor, is that a match?
Well, he's nude under his clothing.
All right, we'll give Raven's Dolphin half a point.
Half a point for Raven's Dolphin.
Congratulations.
All right.
My answer was she's going to take some pictures of naked high school musical stars.
I saw it I saw it I saw it
All right.
Anyway, can we please get the rest of the answers?
Miklatov, Jamie's going to take some pictures of?
A bottle of lube.
A bottle of lube, which is not a match nor a very creative answer.
It was creative the first time I said it.
And you know what?
I said it every time.
A joke that was funny one time.
They could have got a point if they would have been paying attention.
Shh.
Just stop.
Shh.
No.
Eddie.
Shh.
It.
Eddie.
Answer is?
Rob and George Takei playing Pleasure Glove Battle together.
Oh my.
So he's officially Charles Nelson Reilly?
No, it's not Charles Nelson Reilly.
He's dead.
Rice Princess taking pictures of... The train wreck that is this show.
The train wreck that is this show.
Although it clearly said in the question, after the show is over...
Let's hear it for Rice Princess, the genius of Orange Love Radio.
Yay!
Woo!
I rock!
Because we can't keep doing the show after the show is over.
All right.
Let's go to the scoreboard and take a look.
Oh, I see we have GS68, and the game was zero points.
Good job, GS68.
A for effort.
But our winner today, with half a point, Raven's Dolphin is our winner!
Raven's Dolphin, what do you want to surprise?
I don't know, maybe a callback?
Alright, as your prize tonight, we will call you back.
Yay!
But in the meantime, we hang up on you.
All right, so we'll hear from Raven's Dolphin later in the program, but after we do some news.
So let's get back into some gaming news, which we actually don't have much of.
Bye, thanks for being on the show, celebrities.
Go watch your Galaxy Galactica with the Krylon.
Even if you were below average tonight.
All right, I give you guys a D minus.
No, a D plus.
No, that was awesome.
All right, Eddie, you get an A. We were good stuff, exactly.
Well, unfortunately I have a little bit of bad news.
There is no Crackdown sequel in development right now.
And the reason being is that Microsoft was a little late to ask them to actually make a sequel.
So now they're working on a new MMO called All Points Bulletin or APV.
It's going to be a MMO coming out in 2009.
So that sucks.
You know what?
Real Time Worlds isn't making a sequel.
Hold on.
Is that really such a bad thing?
I mean, think about it for a minute.
I know you guys all love Crackdown.
I'm not saying anything against Crackdown.
No, no, no.
Hold on, though.
I mean, what is the number one bitch people have about the gaming industry?
Long time fans.
They're not original enough.
A lot of the things you see out there are just sequels to other stuff.
So shouldn't we kind of support a company that says, you know what?
We don't really want to make a sequel right now.
Is that really such a bad thing?
Well, it wasn't that they don't want to make a sequel.
They wanted to make a sequel.
It's just that they didn't approach them for a sequel.
Oh.
Well, then they suck, and they can go die in a boat fire.
Right, Jamie?
Yes.
All right.
All right.
That's it for the gaming news tonight until we get to last-minute stories, but that means it's time for the Skype line.
Yes, we're going to open up our Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
But of course, since we promised Raven's Dolphin as his prize, we will now call him back.
So we have hit the dial button on Raven Stauffen's name, and we're waiting to connect.
Do you want to hear something creepy?
I think we got voicemail.
You have reached Tekken Game Podcast messaging line.
Voicemail, please leave a message after the beep.
Please eliminate all or most background noise.
Keep it under a minute or 30 seconds.
That's fine.
Here we go.
Raven's Dolphin, this message is for you.
We are calling you back as promised, but you're not there.
Sucks to be you.
Hugs and kisses.
All right, it's over.
All right, so let's go to the phones and see who calls us.
Again, our username is Orange Launch Radio on Skype.
Phone number 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Oh, look who's calling us back.
Do you want your own show or something?
No.
All right, what do you want, Raven's Dolphin?
I forgot to tell you that I fail at computers.
Yes, you do.
Congratulations.
Alright, real quickly.
You've had too much show time.
What's your question tonight for us?
My Xbox died.
That's it.
That's not a fucking question.
That's not a question.
No, I just want to tell you that I'm sad.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
Here's the Kleenex.
Alright, if you want to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username is Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
Meanwhile, I'm looking at chat comments.
There hasn't been a lot of chat comments tonight I've read.
I apologize.
Velerno, I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing your name.
I'm not sure how to say that.
Velerno says, I wanted a Crackdown sequel and puts those dejected little three dots right after that comment there.
So sorry about that.
All right.
We got some more calls, though.
Let's go to the calls.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, guys.
This is FootyMonster.
Hello, FootyMonster.
How are you?
I think it's just fine.
What about you guys?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Like, I don't know, maybe during a certain upcoming expo we can give you more information.
Not that I know anything, or don't, but that's it.
FootyMonster, what do you have for our listeners tonight?
Well, basically I just wanted to share with you guys, I don't know if it's a review or something, but Persona 3, which is this new game for the PS2, it's an RPG, and I just wanted to let everyone know, because it's probably underrated and under the radar, it's from the Shin Megami Tensei universe.
If anyone ever played one of those games, like Nocturne,
Digital Devil Saga, Nocturne was the game in which Dante from Devil May Cry made a cameo and stuff so it was known back in the day in the PS2 and Persona 3 came out and it was really really really good and I've been playing it I put like 40 hours into it I'm not even halfway done it's deep as hell and it's really good I don't know if you guys have heard anything about it or you know what's funny I'm holding here in my hand the Persona 3 trade demo we got sent from Atlas and I have to admit I have not played it still
Shame on you, Rob.
Alright, I'll give it to Jamie to play.
I swear I was going to play it, but then I went back to Final Fantasy XI because that's stupid.
Have you played Overlord yet?
No.
But I will.
What makes this game so great compared to the Final Fantasies of the world?
You know, most people say, what's the greatest role-playing game of all time?
People will say Dragon Quest or they'll say Final Fantasy VII.
Why is it so great?
Well,
Thank you for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thank you for watching!
You win.
I mean, on the show, a couple weeks ago, we did review the whole thing in length.
I spent like 20 minutes talking about it because it's really, really that good.
Very cool.
Well, so you can go ahead and plug your show real quick so they know where to go download that if they want.
All right.
So it's ultimatequest.net.
It's a show that I did with Shadow Slayer, Jack Ransom, and Xenocore.
And I believe that was episode 21, I want to say, or 22.
I forgot right now because it was a couple of weeks ago.
Oh, and I said I'd come on the show.
I sent a reply message back because I didn't see an email for like a week.
But any of us will – I'm sure if you can work in the time with any of us, we'll all come on at some point and talk nerdy role-playing games.
Yeah, I know that Sinogor talked with you about maybe you doing – we have this little thing called the Ultimate Side Quest, which is a show that we do on and off, sometimes like once a month.
And it's like a discussion that's not just about the news but about like maybe a topic, like let's say tabletop RPG gaming and how it would make RPGs in the consoles better.
That was the topic of the latest one.
You'll have to get Jamie for that one because I don't do a lot of tabletop.
I haven't been doing any in the past month.
I was playing D&D.
Very cool.
All right, well, Footy, thanks so much for the input and for the game suggestions.
You've been full of game suggestions lately, from the Hannah Montana DS to this.
I got to spread the Hannah Montana love.
It's awesome.
You better be calling back in a couple weeks and telling us about the next game we all need to be playing.
Oh, that reminds me.
Loki, do not buy jam sessions.
I have the Japanese version.
It's not good.
It's not good.
It's cheap, though.
It really is.
Loki likes cheap.
I'm not buying Hannah Montana, I can tell you that much.
I will buy Hannah Montana.
Alright, you do that.
Alright, bye footy monster, thanks for the call.
Talk to you later guys.
GS68 GS68
Someone sent an email complaining that Heavenly Sword was too short, right?
Mm-hmm.
Well, when I was younger, games took less than an hour to complete and had no save points.
So, people are saying that Heavenly Sword is too short of a game.
Yeah, ten hours.
Ten hours isn't that short.
Ten hours is about how long it took to beat Silent Hill 2, and that's a beautiful game.
So...
I don't think it's such a bad thing that the games are necessarily short, as long as it's fun.
You're right, a lot of those old school NES games, they were really good.
God, I could probably beat Super Mario Bros.
in 15 minutes, if that.
Yeah, or Mario 2, I just got that on Virtual Console, and that's like a 15 minute game if you know all the power-ups and stuff.
But it's part of the, is it fun to replay over and over again?
Because a game like Super Mario Bros.
2, hell yeah, it's fun to play over and over again.
Super Mario Bros.
It's really short.
I mean, you can beat it in under two hours, and there are people who play it over and over again.
Yeah.
So, hey, you know, a game is all about fun, you know, but considering how much they're charging for these games, if it is only a ten-hour game, it better be a really fun ten-hour game, like six bucks an hour good.
But if you think about it, I mean, hell, they charge ten dollars for an hour-and-a-half movie, so why not?
Yeah.
So.
Now, are you buying Heavenly Sword, Loki?
Uh,
Maybe.
Are you buying it, GS68?
Uh, no.
I don't really have much interest in games like those.
I'll probably give it a rent since I can rent for free.
There you go.
Here's one of those rent-before-you-buy things.
Maybe you'll rent it and beat it and then wonder, do I want to play this again?
What money is it out of my pocket?
Alright.
If it's free, I'll do almost anything.
Tiger Claw has an interesting point.
I hate games that force you to play on a hard difficulty just to see the better ending.
If it's normal, then I don't mind because, in my opinion, if you use easy difficulty, you're a pussy.
But I don't really do hard mode a lot on games.
There was a Star Wars game on N64 that you couldn't even see the ending unless you got to the ending and it's all.
To see the ending played in hard mode, I was like, fuck you.
Here's the thing, though.
That wasn't...
Oh shoot, now I'm... It was like the only Star Wars... No, it was other than Rogue Squadron.
Other than Rogue Squadron was the only... Yeah, the one that wasn't Rogue Squadron.
It was the one where you play the... The Ren'ei guy, yeah.
I have that game.
Here's the thing, though.
I think those subtle ending differences are pretty cool.
I go back all the way to the original Metroid.
When you played it the first time, it probably took you forever and a day to actually beat it, and so you got the crappy ending.
But then somebody at school tells you, hey, if you play it really fast, then you get to see the chick take all her clothes off.
Which is people kind of stretching the truth a little bit, but who didn't run home and play through the game just as fast as they could to see if there was that other ending in it?
I know I did.
Well, it was... There you go, see?
I couldn't get under three hours in Super Metroid, not just because of, you know... Or even the games with all the different multiple endings, if you did things a different way or did it the harder way, like Chrono Trigger.
You know, you start off, if you do save game plus and start off and just beat Lavos right away, you get the developer ending.
And that was pretty cool.
Yeah, stuff like that's really cool.
So did Airspace, apparently.
Sorry, I was reading stuff.
So, okay, so anyway, anything else you want to share with our listeners, GS68?
Yeah, I finally got around to playing 3DX Distorted on PS2.
And, what'd you think?
It's pretty good.
I've
I haven't played any, well, I don't have any 2DX between 9th and 13th style, so there's a lot of features that are new to me, like all the score data from the arcade and such.
Yeah, I haven't bought a 2DX game since 9th style either, but I did play a lot of Red.
I don't know, we'll see.
I'm kind of over a lot of those Konami music games, I have to admit.
It's the same fucking thing for like five years now.
So it's... I'm ready for something new.
So when Konami's ready to give me something new, I'll go back.
Or, you know, I do still buy, like, the new DDR games on consoles.
Like, because, you know, Universe and the Xbox DDRs have felt really new to me.
And, hell, I still think, what is it, Ultramix 2 is, like, the best DDR game they've put out in any country on a console.
I got tired of playing DDR at home.
Yeah.
It's not the same.
I'll give you that.
All right, well, GS68, thanks so much for the call.
We appreciate it, okay?
All right.
Later, buddy.
All right.
That's actually going to do it tonight for the Skype line.
We're actually running way over tonight thanks to all the craziness.
So we're actually going to wrap things up with some last minute stories.
Does anybody have some quick last minute stories?
I have some things I forgot to mention during the release dates.
There's a game that apparently was coming out on PC called 30,000 Games.
I don't know what it is, but I know there's 30,000 of them.
And I say for $19.99, that's a pretty damn good deal.
Anyways.
Oops.
Sorry, I wasn't ready for that yet.
My bad.
Okie dokie.
I've been having all sorts of sound boo-boos tonight.
Anyways.
One thing I was going to mention, South Park did win the Emmy for World of Warcraft episodes.
This is actually Loki's new theme music.
Okay.
That, by the way, was Super Mario RPG in Mario Paint.
That's what that was.
Sega's game, The Club, will not be out for Christmas, by the way.
It's going to be out early 2008 for PC, PS3, and Xbox 360.
This is perfect for what we've been talking about.
Anyways, apparently there's some, you can buy unicorns in Second Life.
There's just one teensy little, small little issue that they forgot to mention.
In order to obtain a unicorn, you have to have sex with an adult unicorn in Second Life.
Yay!
It's Super Mario RPG.
but they come with a price.
You can only get them by having sex with an adult unicorn located at the Bell Highland Sim.
Deal or no deal?
How many unicorns get a baby?
Apparently there's a website here that has not... Oh, yeah, that's interesting.
Oh, no.
That's special.
Where's the baby unicorn?
Um...
That's just... Does it really matter?
I don't know.
There's some weird shit on this website.
Like, why is... I don't even know what that is, but some sort of insect having sex with somebody.
God, Second Life is awesome.
And by awesome, you mean scary.
Yes.
Anything else for Last Minute Stories tonight?
Sell everything and get a Wii.
Try First Life.
It's great.
Loki, you done?
Um...
There's some cool Office Depot, I guess, bundle for the Xbox 360 for $2.99.
You get the premium system, so that might be worth it.
I don't know.
Woo!
All right.
That's it.
All right.
Well, that is going to do it tonight for Orange Lounge Radio, you guys.
I want to thank everybody for tuning in to and listening to Orange Lounge Radio tonight and supporting independent radio.
We really appreciate it, you guys.
You guys are awesome.
And by the way...
I want my voice back for next week.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
does an outstanding job of being an intelligent, intricate look into what's reasonably current in video games.
As one of the foremost independent video game podcasts, OLR, hosted by Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki, continues to entertain with its rants, the always low-key but questionable input by frequent guest Shane, and more importantly, its attention to audience through the live chat during the show's Sunday night airing in the mailbag.
The hosts are wonderfully funny without setting out to create comedy.
Sometimes it just works best when the show breaks down and laughter...
Hope you like tonight's show.
Due to some bizarrely inappropriate comment, usually from Shane.
Go figure.
Highly recommended to video game fans of all ages.
Okay, make that relatively mature audiences, but still.
So thank you, Robert H.M., for that review.
And all the people who've left happy, fun reviews on iTunes.
like Mac Man I see here, Mayo Nation, even though I hate mayonnaise, AJ Twist, Flaming, sure, your name got cut off.
Read some of the bad reviews.
And Blue Collar Murder.
You want to hear a bad review?
No, because that will encourage people to write bad reviews.
I don't want to write bad reviews.
No, if you wrote a bad review, then you don't get any attention on our program.
Sorry.
All right.
That's that.
So thank you guys very much for that.
and let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
Eddie, thank you for being here tonight and sticking with us through the whole show and staying away from Gattlestar Balactica during the program.
Do you have any final thoughts?
Nice and fancy.
Indeed.
DarkSakura, do you have any final thoughts tonight?
I actually have one other.
What?
Meh.
My final thought will be reject false icons and give me a dollar.
Tonight's final thought was just stolen from all of Jamie's past stuff.
Loki, your final thought.
My final thought in this... I forgot to mention this during FQs of the Week.
Comcast, for some reason, I don't know if you've noticed this, Rob, or if it's even an issue with your TV.
For some reason now, all the HD channels I get are not widescreen.
They're all, like, boxed.
Like, really small.
Mine are fine.
It's weird, because, like, it just started doing that now.
And I don't know...
I say beat them up.
I say I'm switching to something else.
All right.
There you go.
That's what more people need to do because Comcast has been pissing me off a lot lately too.
Not because of that but just their general service in general.
All right.
But we do love Comcast because that is the internet that gets us out to you guys.
So thanks for that, Comcast.
All right.
Anyhow, that's it for this week's show.
Thank you once again for downloading and supporting Independent Radio.
We couldn't do it without you guys.
Hey, why don't we do it all again next week?
Sound good?
Yeah.
Until then, have a meh week and we'll see you next time.
