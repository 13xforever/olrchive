{"text": " Orange Lounge Radio With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco. Tonight, September 2nd, 2007, Xbox Live gets a Labor Day sale, PlayStation gets a SingStar bundle, and an old PC gaming classic is now free. Orange Lounge Radio But joining us, as always, say hello to Loki. Yes. How are you doing, Loki? I'm fine. You're fine? That sounded a little bit forced. I'm doing okay. Oh, so now we've downgraded from find okay. What gives? I'm running low of soda in this cup here, but luckily I brought two backups. How much soda do you bring to this program? Two cans. Two cans. All right, also joining us tonight, say hello to Miklatov, who's filling in in the big blue chair tonight. Hello. How are you doing, Miklatov? I'm fine. What are you playing there on your PSP? It's not my PSP. Whose PSP is it? Matt's. Matt's? What are you playing on Matt's PSP? I am playing Katamari. Can I show the webcam people what you're doing? Fine, but I'm going to miss important text. Important dialogue and what have you. Dude, the king of all cosmos always says important funny things. Well, you missed that one, I'm sorry to say. All right. Well, anyhow, yes, we do have webcam tonight for the folks that are listening live. We're on operator11.com. I do want to state, though, as we were kind of talking about last week, we're not planning on suddenly changing into a video show or a video podcast. It's just that some of our live listeners wanted to see us while we were taping live, so here we are. The webcam's on. But operator11 has some funky rules, and it's supposedly going to shut off after 40 minutes, and so we won't be able to archive until part B again. But the good news is that operator11 saves an archive of the file for a long time, so if you're listening to the podcast and you wonder to yourself, I wonder what this looks like being taped live, you can go over to operator11.com and look for our feed on there and see it. I want to see how fat all the hosts look on camera and then find out. And then you can love us long time. Yes, you can. I just named my island in Katamari. What is your island in Katamari? It's Poop Island. That's lovely. Cracks me up. Do you get to name those yourself? I played the Katamari on the PSP. I don't know. It just asked me to name the island, so I named it Poop Island. My island was named Slavery Island. Why did you name it that? I don't know. All right. Let's start off tonight's show, as we always do, talking about how is your gaming week. Dark Sakura starts us off, but she's not here, so I'll go to Shane, also known as Miklotov, first, since obviously he's playing me and my Katamari. So I'm playing me and my Katamari. And how is it? I hate the controls a lot. It's really bad to control, but it's still funny, and that's what really counts in Katamari. What else have you been playing this week? Metroid Prime 3, which is the coolest. What do you like about Metroid Prime 3? It's fun. What a very descriptive answer you're giving us here. Well, that was a terrible question. Sorry. Why do you think Metroid Prime 3 is so fun? What is it about the game that appeals to you? Well, I like the fact that the controls are really cool, and I like the Metroid Prime series, and I like the fact that\u2014spoilers are coming up\u2014I got to fight Ridley, and it was really fun, and I had to shoot him in his mouth. And I was falling down this big shaft the whole time, and it was really cool. So you have to fight somebody while you're falling down? Yes. Is there a chance that you'll ever hit the ground? Probably not. Did you just keep falling forever? I think you fall forever until you beat Ridley or Ridley kills you. All right. Also, is there anything else you're giving me? I started playing Suikoden V again. I've owned it since it came out, and I worked on it, but I never actually played it, really. Can you say what you did on the game? Yeah, I've said before. I don't remember. I did text. I can't remember. There's secrets you can say and things you can't say on air. And yeah, I'm just now starting to play it. See, if I asked you if there was a Suikoden VI, could you talk about that? I could not talk about that. You can neither confirm nor deny those reports? Not. All right. Fine. Fair enough. Anything else? No. All right. Let's go over to Loki. And while Loki talks about his gaming week, I'm going to go grab another cookie. Do you want a peanut butter cookie, Loki? Yes. Awesome. I want a peanut butter cookie. All right. I'm going to go get that. Stupid cookies. Loki, tell us about your gaming week. My gaming week was a lot of Xbox 360 stuff. I played a lot of demos, including some stuff I've already played before, like beautiful Katamari. Ace Combat 6. I think I tried a little bit of Juice 2 and didn't like that still. Then, of course, I played Bioshock, which is still awesome and continues to get even more awesome as I play it. So definitely, ooh, cookie. And let's see. Other games I've played, Call of Duty 4, I actually got to try a little bit of the multiplayer beta. And I had no doubts going into it that the game's going to be awesome, and it's just amazing. It still plays like Call of Duty 2 and 3. I do like how they've updated the radar a little bit so you can actually get a better idea of where people are firing from, so that's pretty cool. And also the replays of when you get killed, they're pretty cool. So that's neat. And then other stuff, I actually played more Settlers of Catan on Xbox Live Arcade. And I thought about, oh, I played Street Trace New York. It's that hoverboard racing combat game or something. That game's really weird. It kind of reminds me of like Crossing Sonic Riders with that crappy, was it that bumper car game that came with Windows 98 or something. I don't even remember what the hell that's called. But something like that. Not recommending that game, though. It's quite boring. But I tried the demo, and that was kind of fun. Let's see. Other stuff, on PSP, I was playing a lot of We Love Katamari, and I don't know why. I absolutely hate the control in that game, but I'm stuck playing it and loving it. The only thing I wish they would do is just port that to PlayStation 2, because I know they like doing those ports from PSP to PlayStation 2. Just do that. I mean, I'll spend the $20 to actually buy the game, so I think that's what they need to do to make at least the controls a little bit better. And other than that, I believe that was my gaming week. Oh, Saints Row Multiplayer. We finally, and I wish I had pictures because I haven't finished setting it up yet, but our game room set up at work is finally done. We have five Xbox 360s land and have been playing Saints Row on it, and it's absolutely fun multiplayer. The only thing I really hate, though, is the system link multiplayer on it, you can't change the way your character looks, so everybody looks the same. You can change it on live, but you can't change it in system link, which doesn't make any sense whatsoever. But hopefully they'll fix that with a sequel, I don't know. But hopefully I'll get some actual pictures of the setup. I'm still putting the 360s in clear cases, which by the way, if I were to review the clear cases I bought, they absolutely suck. But they look pretty, so that was my gaming week. That was a hell of a lot of gaming week. There's a lot of comments going on in the chat room here at chat.orangelaunchradio.com. Again, our chat room location is chat.orangelaunchradio.com. If you guys are in the Operator 11 chat, since we are doing the video tonight, I just want to get out there. We do not read the Op 11 chat because it's on a laptop that's on the other side of the room and it's hard for us to read, so you have to be in a regular chat room. I play Contra IV for the DS. How did you do that? Our Konami rep brought in a DS with a dev thing in it. That's kind of important. That's a big one. What's Contra IV? It's awesome. It's exactly like you would imagine a sequel to Contra III being. It's true 2D side-scrolling action, it's Contra, it's awesome, and not that sort of awesome that was a neo-Contra and stuff like that. That was pretty cool. The other thing, I didn't play this game, but I dogged on it last week, Cruisin' for the Wii. I actually saw the game in motion in a trailer and it looked not as bad, let me put it that way. It looked very low poly count, it almost looked like a DS game ported to the Wii, but it was running at 60 frames per second, so while it may not have been too pretty to look at, it was really smooth and looked pretty fun. If it's cheap enough, let me try it. I want to go back to Contra IV for a minute because this is a game a lot of people are very excited about. How does it use the vertical? How does it use the two screens? Is it just a very vertical game? It's a very vertical game. It's very tall. If you'll see stuff falling down and you basically get to shoot at stuff, there's a grappling hook in it so you can grapple with stuff and crawl on bars and whatnot. Does it use a touch screen at all or did they just say fuck it? For the brief time that I had with the game, it did not use a touch screen. You have no idea if they have the top-down modes like they had in the old Super Nintendo Contra? I don't think they do, but it would be cool if they did. Very cool. All right. Wait. Wait. Wait. What? Let's tell everybody what my new island name is. Yes. On Miyamakatamari, what did you name it? I named it Penn Island. Penn Island. Think about that one for a minute. Penn Island. P-E-N-I-S-L-A-M-D. It's so good. Hilarious. That's comedy gold. Anyhow, I was going to go to the chat room here and read some comments, but we got a little bit sidetracked here. Again, chat.orangessoundsradio.com. Somebody was talking about Bioshock here earlier. Drunami said, Bioshock is fucking scary. Did you get scared by Bioshock? There was one time, I didn't get scared, but it startled me a little bit, where you're investigating this dentist's office and there's pipes breaking and it's freezing stuff. All of a sudden, one of the pipes breaks and it gets a little foggy and you turn around and there's a guy standing right there. I thought he was dead at first. The first time they played through it and then the second time I knew he was going to be there. I turned around and just stood there for a second and then he finally attacked me. It was kind of freaky. You turn around and all of a sudden, boom, there's someone there. Picker Uno says, I got scared by the demo of Bioshock. I did too a little bit. I have to admit. I got a little bit scared from just the demo alone because it's crazy. The game gets so awesome and I can't imagine Andrew Ryan, the main guy who built this whole city as Walt Disney. I can replace Walt Disney in this and just like, I don't know. You're going to make me not want to go back to Disneyland and that makes me sad because I love Disneyland. Andrew Ryan just reminds me of Walt Disney or like a really weird version of Walt Disney. Maybe they based it off him, who knows. I was hoping to get some emails from people who didn't like Bioshock, but I didn't see anything in the mail bag when I last checked. I don't know. We'll open up the email bag a little later and let you know if we heard from any people that didn't like Bioshock. Anyhow, let's go ahead and go on to My Gaming Week. I want to talk about My Gaming Week. I've also been playing Metroid Prime 3, but not quite as much as Shane has. I don't want to give this game a full review yet, but I can already tell you I like it better than 1 and 2. Because 1 and 2, I still had to get over that shock of, oh my god, Metroid is not 2D anymore. What did they do to my game? I don't want to label myself as somebody who just hates games automatically because they're 3D, but you have to remember Metroid is a series that's very near and dear to my heart and it was very hard to kind of conceptualize Metroid in a 3D world. I don't think the first two games are bad games by any means. I couldn't get into them because they didn't feel like Metroid to me. But this third game, I have to admit, the gimmicky controls are actually pretty awesome and done pretty well considering the limited amount of buttons that a Wii controller has. It's pretty fun. And I also like the fact that Metroid Prime 3 kind of breaks the mold of when you start in the world, you are missing all of your gear, like you only have your suit and a gun. And when you start in Metroid Prime 3, you already have like a double jump move. You already have, or you get the ability to shoot missiles rather quickly. You can already turn into a ball and a lot of that stuff. So I think that's kind of cool. Escapist in the chat room asks, do you have to scan everything in Metroid Prime 3 to understand what the heck is going on? Yes. No. Yes. No. But it helps. No. The scanning in Metroid Prime 3 only, it's not to tell you what's going on, it's to tell you now what you need to do to get through this room. It's not like, oh, you know, there's lore stuff you can read, but... It's not mandatory. It's not mandatory. I did notice it was a little easier to get into story-wise than one or two was, because you could go up and you could talk to people and it kind of made the story a little better for me. It wasn't just scanning things and reading things. Also, I will point out though, scanning things appears to be the way that you get most of the tokens in the game. I know there hasn't been a lot of talk about the tokens, which a couple weeks ago was labeled by a lot of the big game blogs as, like, Metroid Prime's achievement system, but it's not really achievements. The tokens that you unlock by scanning things or doing certain things in the game, you can use to unlock soundtrack things, graphics and art and all those types of things. It's kind of like, basically, Mortal Kombat, how you got the tokens from beating things and you could use them in the crypt or whatever it was called and unlock special stuff. Also, it uses Wii Connect 24 because for every 100 enemies you kill, you get a green token and you can send the green tokens to other people and they can use them. Or, I guess, no, it's a black token and when you send it to someone else, it's green or something like that, but you have to use friend codes to make that work. And then you said, Shane, you are pretty sure you got an actual achievement in the game or something. Oh, yeah. I was using my ice missile. Hey, while I'm talking, smell this alcohol. I'll talk about the alcohol in a minute, folks. I was using the ice missile on just enemies randomly. I want to drink it first. Not yet. No, I'm going to drink it first. I used the ice missile on some lizard thing and once I did that, one of the little cards you get for every 100 kills, I guess for certain random tasks you do, came up and was like a chilled lizard or something like that, like a terrible achievement name. And it was cool. I like that. It's achievements. And you know what you can do with that? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Just like the Xbox 360 achievements. By the way, the liquor talk is because it is a three-day weekend, so some of us have chosen to do a little drinking tonight, which leads me to the responsibility spiel. Of course, we are all over 21 and Matt's not drinking tonight because he didn't find a designated driver. I could have, but I figured that... Loser? He's not into it tonight. You said you were sick and were possibly not going to be drinking, so that's why I didn't want to be the only one. Yes, I have been sick, but I figure it's only Tylenol that I'm taking, so I should be okay, right? Well, yeah, unless you die, in which case then we would have been terribly wrong. All right. Well, anyhow, what else? But Shane's here and Shane's drinking, although he doesn't like his blue drink, even though he likes the smell of it. I like it. I like the smell. It's like an alcoholic blueberry muffin to me. It's really weird. You want to try this one? This pomegranate thingy? I haven't drank from it yet. Yes. I was going to say, we are all over 21 and we drink responsibly, blah, blah, blah, and kids shouldn't drink, blah, blah, blah, and so on, so yeah. Is that any good? I don't know if it's the combination of the two, but that tastes like that gamer-fueled Mountain Dew to me, which is not a pleasant taste. Really? This is pomegranate fusion smearing off. We're taking it easy tonight, so we'll see. Let's see. What else did I do in my gaming week? I bought on the Xbox 360, which of course is a Japanese RPG made by a lot of the people that were involved with Final Fantasy. You have Sakaguchi, who made the first Final Fantasy, Nobui Matsu does the music again, and then I believe, who is it, Akira Toriyama, is that his name? Something like that. Did the Dragon Ball Z characters? Those are the characters in this game. Blue Dragon is a good game. Is it a great game? No. Is it a 10? No. Is it going to leave a lot of people disappointed because they were expecting... Blue Dragon... Hold on. I'm going to have your opinion in a minute. Is it going to leave a lot of people disappointed because you hear these big names attached to it, and you are expecting greatness, or like a Final Fantasy XIII or something? Yes. It's going to leave a lot of people disappointed. But it's not a bad game by any means, and certainly it's the type of game that the Xbox 360 is severely lacking. But here's the problems I see with Blue Dragon. It's not with the battle system. I love the battle system. It's a real throwback to an old Super Nintendo RPG, and it feels very similar to Final Fantasy V with some elements in the act of time kind of thrown in. You can charge attacks and drop them in certain places in the act of time, and depending on how long you charge, it does more damage. So I personally like the battle system as a throwback to old RPGs, but the story is kind of meh. And you would think with these names attached to it would be an awesome story, but the problem with the story is that it just kind of comes out of nowhere, you know? And you don't understand what the bad guy's motivations are. I mean, literally, you go up into this big bubble in the sky. Your town is being attacked by this land shark. This shark is going around destroying buildings and things, and then you basically manage to sort of catch the land shark, but it drags you into this place. Would you say it's a street shark? No, it's a land shark. That's what they call it. And it even has a fin that sticks out above the ground. I thought it may have been a reference back to that really crappy cartoon series. Eventually, the land shark takes them underground, and then the land shark blasts off into space, and they're on it, or not, I shouldn't say into space, but into the sky. And then they finally meet the bad guy. You encounter the main bad guy within the first 30 minutes to an hour of the game, and they're like, why are you doing this? And he says, because I want to hear your screams. I'm like, what kind of motivation is that? Ooh, pedophile. It's like, that kind of uber generic bad guy thing kind of worked back in the day when there wasn't a whole lot of way to flesh out the story, but I don't know so much now. So it's got a very awkward story, and I cannot stand the little cute character Maru Maru. I cannot stand what they did with his voice. It's awful. Otherwise, those little bitches aside, I mean, it is a good game. If you're a fan of role-playing games and you have a 360, it's worth your time to check out, because importantly, it comes down to how is the game, and the game is fine. The music's really good and all that stuff. I'm sorry, but that gameplay is boring, and it has led me to call it Blue Dragon. I'm noticing DJ Disentery in chat says, because you want to hear their screams, sounds like Shane's reason for shaking babies, referring to an earlier episode of the program. Or just in general. Why did you not like Blue Dragon? You're someone that liked old RPGs, right? But we've come so far, and then to be thrown this battle system that's absolutely boring, it's just like, I don't know, it doesn't sit right with me. And the pacing seems slow, and granted, this is all, the only thing I've played is the demo that was on Xbox Live. See, I don't think that, I think the demo, now that I've played the actual game, the demo fucking sucks. The demo is not a good representation of the game, I think. I just, it looks overly generic, and not interesting. And yeah, that Maru Maru guy is, like, the reason we have mute buttons on TVs. I'm looking in the chat room here, Pika Uno says, Blue Drag On? Get it? Because it drags on. Get it? Yes, I get it. So maybe you could call it Boo Drag On, maybe, I don't know. I'm just going to stick with Boo Dragon. Mark Tetsuya says, Does Blue Dragon have the original voice? Is this an option? Yes, it does. You can choose the English language, a Japanese language, all with English subtitles, or you can have French language. So if you want all your characters to speak French, you can have that as well, which I'm sure is interesting. That might make the game a little better playing it in French. You think? Yes. But I think that one guy's voice is still going to be very annoying. But it would be. That's literally what he sounds like. It's horrible. It would be French annoying. It might be cool. Sounds like teen girl squad. Escapist in chat room says, Well, now to wait for Eternal Sonata and Lost Odyssey. Eternal Sonata is going to be awesome, but this will hold me over. That was the best thing about Blue Dragon is inside the case was a card pimping out Eternal Sonata, because that's a good game. But again, you're basing your opinions on these games off a demo. How dare you? I'm watching you play it. By Eternal Sonata, you haven't even played the real game yet. You've only played a demo. And it was the best demo ever. I'm trying to think. What were some good demos that were bad games? Loki, help me out here. Good demos that were bad games. Can you think of anything? I know there's got to be something. I'm going to think about this one. Chat room, I need your help. Good demos, bad games. Did Perfect Dark have a good demo? I don't know. Perfect Dark Zero, sorry. Not to be confused with the original Perfect Dark, sorry. Cameo maybe? I've never played that. Escapist says Final Fantasy 12. I freaking love Final Fantasy 12. What are you talking about? Who that person from the chat room, because they're idiots. Fireboma says Devil Dice. I don't even know what that is. Pika Uno says Cameo rules, shut the fuck up. It's okay. I wouldn't say it rules, but it's okay. It rules. It's sucking. All right. Let's get into tonight's gaming news, since we've talked about our gaming week for far too long. I was going to get into some housekeeping. Pretty much the only thing I had to tell you guys was that we are doing a little bit of drinking tonight, so if we sound a little off, that's why it's a three-day weekend. Why not? I'm just going to be off, period. And that we are up on Operator 11, if you want to check us out there, or the archive should be up there. I don't know about this video quality, though. It looks like it's running really slow. We'll see, though. I'm just moving really slow. As long as it doesn't kill the screen. We're not going to play to the camera, because we don't want to be a TV show. We're still Orange Lounge Radio, but to answer the calls of our live listeners who wanted us to get a webcam, we finally did. So there you have it. Wow. Enjoy. That's really... I know. That's really awesome. Figure. All right. Anyhow. Wow. FootyMonster agrees with Final Fantasy XII. I second Final Fantasy XII. Demo was great. Game sucked. You guys are mean. Yeah. How about Final Fantasy VIII? The game was awesome. Yes. How about Final Fantasy VIII? I love Final Fantasy VIII. Excellent example. That is such a good game. I don't even remember the demo. Ruined by a battle system. Where was the demo? And the battle system was great. The demo was with... What did they put the Final Fantasy VIII? Vagrant Story. Was it really? Yeah. They put the Final Fantasy VIII demo with some other Square game. I remember that. All right. Let's get into the gaming news. I don't have any housekeeping otherwise. Visit our website, OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Leave us five-star reviews on iTunes, pretty please, or elsewhere around the web. Tell two people you know about our program, and so on and so on. Live journal MySpace. Add us there. Blah, blah, blah. Gaming news. I don't know. Can I? You, Loki, or me? You are. I am. Oh, crap. Oh, because I have a follow-up to something we talked about last week. Last week, we were talking about Mass Effect is getting delayed to December. Well, guess what? That turned out to not be true, because Mass Effect is now set to be released on November 20th, which is getting close to December, but not quite there yet. So that should be out just in time for the big day after Thanksgiving holiday. And of course, a lot of people definitely looking forward to this game. They call it an RPG. It's like sci-fi. Looks to have a little bit of first-person shooter elements in it, though. I don't want to call it a first-person shooter, but some elements is kind of mixed up. I would say it's like what Phantasy Star Online should have been. Sort of. Except it's offline. Well, we'll see. You know, futuristic. Wait, wait. Phantasy Star Online or Phantasy Star Universe? Either. Phantasy Star Online was a great game. Universe was a piece of crap. I liked Universe's single-player story, and the fact that it was online was just a bonus. But it was a little bit repetitive. I'll give you that. It was a little bit repetitive. You didn't like online? It was okay. All you do is run around and hit things. It was great. It was fun to play with voice chat. It was fun to play with other people. It was a chatroom with swords. It was a terrible game fight. That's what it was. It was a chatroom with swords. Whatever. At least they didn't move as funky as they did in the old Phantasy Star Online. At least there's that much. Anyways, something less exciting now. Apparently there's some pictures that leaked out on Flickr of a new Xbox Live arcade game featuring the Toyota Yaris. Yes, those wonderful commercials featuring the car doing stupid things, yet not really talking about the car. Great. It's going to be an adver game. I don't know. This was at, I think, some Toyota event. I hope we don't pay for this because I sure as hell am not going to pay for this. Now, is this a racing game? What the hell would you do with it? It looks like a racing game. Is there screenshots? Well, there are screenshots of a shot of people playing the game, but it doesn't really show much. It was at the Evolution FGC EVO West 2007 event. Yeah, I don't know. It doesn't really show me much and I could care less that this game is coming out. Hey, you know what though? If it's free and it's a decent racing game, I'm all about that. Here it is for you. If it's free and you can get achievement points from it, you'll totally play it until you unlock everything. Yeah, shut up. You know what should be an unlockable feature in a Toyota racing game, though? To be able to race Priuses, that would be awesome. Don't you think, like Al Gore's Sun Mode? Wouldn't that be fun? I don't know how fun this is going to be, but they are making a brand new movie out of another video game, because you know Hollywood loves to make movies out of video games. CP Productions is a brand new Hollywood company and they have bought the rights to make Joust. Yes, like Joust from 1983 or whenever that game came out. Remember when you had the little lance and you tried to stab the pterodactyl in the mouth and you hit the button to flap around? It's actually a pretty fun game to play two player, and it's on Xbox Live. That's right, they are going to make Joust the movie. It's being made by producers Christine Peters and Michael Cerenzi. They have worked on such notable films as Blackout and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. Here's a quote from Cerenzi. Joust is an arcade game that's as old as Pac-Man and has global awareness. We took one element of the game and the brand itself and built a whole new world around it for the film. So you can guess what that element is going to be. I hope it's the element of the hands coming up from the lava to pull people in the lava because that was always cool. And maybe they'll pull these producers in and make them not make this movie because it's probably going to be bad. I could see one of those, I don't know, just like a pseudo-futuristic jousting movie. It's going to be boring is what it is. I mean, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, fortunately I got dragged to that and that was a horrible movie. So, I don't know. It's such a dumb idea. Let's see, going to our chat room, chat.orensonshadeo.com. Tiger Claw says, a movie about people riding on giant ostriches. Articuya says, ostriches don't fly and Dark Knight says, fail in its future. There you go. Escapist says, Kate Hudson and her ostriches bicker for half the movie than Fall in Love. Now that I'd pay to see. Anyways, there's an interesting rumor going on regarding Guitar Hero 3. Apparently another artist is in talks with Activision and Red Octane regarding, of course, being in Guitar Hero 3 as one of the legends of rock to join up with the other people in there. That person is Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine, of course, obviously going to be dueling against him. I think right now it's still, they're in talks but hasn't fully committed yet. But that'd be kind of neat. They're getting down the line here so if they're going to put him in there, it's going to have to be pretty soon. Yeah, isn't that game coming out like next month or something? Yeah, like around Halloween, seriously. Are they just maybe holding on to some secrets? Well, I mean, I can't imagine that there's too much development going into that game. You don't really have to change that much other than putting songs in there and creating the player models for these people that they're getting in there. Coming soon to the Xbox Live Video Marketplace, Family Guy. That's right, coming on September 2nd. Is that today or tomorrow? That's today. That's today. Well, holy crap. It's coming out today on Xbox Live Marketplace. That's freaking sweet. Stewie Griffin, The Untold Story, and I believe episodes from, I don't know if it's, is it every episode that's coming up on Xbox Live? I think it is. Let me just save you some time. Do not download Stewie Griffin, The Untold Story, whatever that is. Wasn't that bad? It is horrible. It's just three episodes strung together and it feels like three episodes. It was not good, but Family Guy is good. I like that they decided to put this on the Marketplace at the height of its popularity. Being sarcastic because nobody should care about the show anymore. Well, isn't it ironic, though, that the show is so damn popular and then it came out, it got canceled or whatever. It was more like a cult thing, then it got canceled, then it was popular again on DVD, like insanely popular, like it was like, you know, have you seen this, and then Fox brings it back and it's funny for a couple weeks and then it just kind of goes downhill. It's so funny. I love it. Really? But here's the thing, though. I don't watch it on Fox. I watch three runs on Cartoon Network and TBS. So you're still watching the old episodes? I'm watching, well, they're older episodes. It's basically when I don't get to catch the new episodes when they come out on Fox, they play them a few weeks later on Cartoon Network. And I think if you watch Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, your standards for entertainment are a lot lower than most people's, because god damn, I don't know how some of those shows survive on their late-night stoners watching that. Tom Goes to the Mayor or whatever? No, there's stuff that's a lot weirder than that now. Really? They're just scraping at the bottom of the barrel. Now, it's a lot worse. They actually have some perfect hair, or like, woman with perfect hair, and it's like some weird perverted guy, and some anime chick, or something, I don't know. So speaking of weird Japanese stuff, there's that Dreamcast shoot-em-up game that was coming out, I guess, next year. It's also coming out on Xbox Live Arcade in Japan. So, it's pretty interesting, I guess it's one of the games called Trigger Heart Alexia is coming to Xbox Live Arcade, and I guess it's the team behind a Sega Saturn shooter game called Shin-ru, I guess, I probably butchered that. That's pretty awesome, and I will definitely be using my Japanese account to buy that game. If you buy a game on the Japanese Xbox Live accounts, can you play it on the American accounts? Does it work that way? Um, maybe. What you can do is you can download the demo on the Japanese account, and then you register it on the US account, because if you download a game and you purchase it on another account, it's a demo on the other accounts, so what you can do is I download it on the Japanese download the demo and then register it on the US one. That should work. Interesting, I think. Alright. Also coming to Xbox Live Arcade very soon, it's in this next week, Fatal Fury Special finally makes its way to Xbox Live Arcade, which I'm actually pretty excited about because Fatal Fury Special is a game I actually really enjoyed back in the day, so I'm excited to see this game finally make its way to Xbox Live. Cyberball 2072. This was not a game I'm so fond of, but I bet there's a lot of people out there that are into this game. It's like that futuristic football game that Atari put out many years ago. I think it runs on the same hardware as games like 720, and those games did. So that game is coming out to Xbox Live Marketplace. What should be also noted, though, is that there's a Labor Day sale going on on Xbox Live Marketplace right now, and you can get certain games for half price. Small Arms and Zuma are 400 Microsoft points apiece this weekend, and Gauntlet and Dig Dug are 200 points a pop through Monday at 5 o'clock. So if you're listening to us live or on the podcast, you might want to hurry up and grab those if you want them. I don't know. I mean, even at 200 points, that's, what, 250? Eh, I don't know. Gauntlet and Dig Dug are both decent games. I don't know. I think Gauntlet is fun, like it's a nostalgia thing for, like, the first two times you play it, and then you're like, I'm done with this now. Dig Dug is a classic, though. I don't know. I guess it depends how strongly you feel about retro titles. Yeah. Anyways, there are some pictures that leaked out, or I wouldn't really say leaked out, went out on the internet showing that, yes, the elites can also crap out as well and get the wonderful three rings of death. Although, I'm not too surprised, though, seeing that they're showing, I guess, a kiosk. Now, I'm not sure what kind of ventilation those kiosks have, but just looking at it, I mean, doesn't look like there's much airflow in that at all, and depending on what they're running, no wonder that thing overheated. So, I don't know. Xbox 360s die. They'll get replaced. Live. I guess as long as they give the three-year warranty with those, right? Oh, yeah, they still do the warranties on all of them, so, I mean, apparently they're stepping up things to make sure that their turnaround time's a lot less, but... And aren't they, like, giving away free Xbox Live or something with that, too? They are. They're giving away, when you actually return the system, you'll get a free card for one month of Xbox Live, valued at probably, like, five bucks. Now, is that something that you can extend your current Xbox Live account with? I'm not sure if you can extend your current one. I'd imagine you would, because it's just those redeemable cards, the gold subscriptions. So, I'm not sure, but... Alright, well, one thing I'm looking forward to playing on the 360 at some point is Tekken 6. Hopefully it's coming to the 360, and they said, yep, I seem to remember they announced it's coming to both systems. I don't know if it's coming to the 360 yet, because I think that the arcade game's actually running off of PlayStation 3 hardware, so... Don't! No, we'll see. Well, anyway, Tekken 6 is still on its way. I guess... I probably have a PS3 by then, anyway. Yeah, Dartusuius says, are you sure you're not thinking of Virtua Fighter 5? Maybe I am. Yeah, Virtua Fighter 5's coming out in October. Well, Tekken 6 is on its way, and there's a brand new fighter that's been announced for Tekken 6, and that's Bob. Yes, he has the very unique name of Bob, but the cool thing about Bob, he's a chubby. He's a chubster, and you don't see a lot of fat guys in video games, especially in fighting games. Doesn't he sort of resemble Mario with bleached hair? Kinda. Here's a picture of him right here. He does kind of look like Mario with bleached hair. He's got the blue jeans and a red shirt and suspenders, and then bleached hair. But, you know, the only fat guys I can think of in video game history would be like, you know, Raiden from... I think he was in one of the Neo Geo fighting games. I think he was in the first Fatal Fury, I think. And there was... What other big fat guys were there? T-Honda. T-Honda, but he wasn't fat. He was... He was a sumo wrestler. Yeah. There you go. Karnov is what Jirnami says in chats. There you go. Yes, I guess he's a stereotypical American, according to Nintendo Maniac 64. According to Japanese Arcadia Magazine, who actually kind of broke the news on this, Bob used to be into conventional beauty, but he got frustrated by how his size limited him, so he got super fat. You go, boy. Awesome. Now what else is pretty neat? That Tekken 5 online is now online. And yes, it's kind of funny, but you can now download, and not for free, but for $10, you can download and get survival mode, and then I guess a practice mode, and of course the online mode. So, yay! They broke it and then make you pay $10 to fix it. Hooray. Do you have Tekken on the PlayStation Network? Fuck no. Because you know I don't even have a PlayStation 2. I'm not spending like 15 bucks for a crippled game. I'm not really a Tekken fan. I mean, I don't play fighting games that much, so much less do I play PlayStation 3 games much. All right, well, one thing we like to do is we like to open up ye old mailbag once in a while and read some of our favorite emails. Sadly, Dark Soccer is not here tonight, so she's not here to read the emails for us, but I'm here, damn it. I'll read the emails. Again, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangelaundry.com is the place to do it. Our first email tonight comes from AZHP, and AZHP says, hey OLR, random thought from last week's show that I forgot to say on the skype line. Saw the live feed for about five seconds before live 365 got cut off and you killed the operator. 11 feed. Rob is hot, call me later. Well, thank you. That's awkward. Yeah, a little bit. P.S., just kidding. Keep up the great podcasting. Less awkward. Funny. Let's go to another email. This email comes to us from Ali. It could be Ali, actually. I think it's Ali. In episode 244, part A, you got an email from someone who said your show is calming, and Rob exclaimed, I don't understand. How is this show calming? This show makes me want to do vehicular manslaughter to my cousins. I second that calming effect. I've been doing the endurance races in Forza while listening to podcasts, and I must say, it is when I listen to yours that I don't want to kill my Xbox. It cheats. Now I need to say F you to my local EB Games. It is situated in a local burg separated from the city, which is illegal to trade video games if you are under 18, and you must have photo ID to trade video games. In other words, when I went to take my stack of old Xbox games that have no replay value in to get Forza, I had to go back home, drag my mom to EB, and make her show them her driver's license so I could buy the E-rated Forza Motorsport 2, WTF. I would have called in to deliver that rant, but I'm never home when you guys tape. Also, am I the only one who finds the mouse acceleration and Bioshock unbelievably frustrating? I love how in Battlefield 1942, Half-Life 2, and Counter-Strike, the mouse response is snappy and rigid, but Bioshock has some weird acceleration built into it, or is it because I'm playing in Vista? Oh, by the way, I'm playing Bioshock on my dual-booting MacBook Pro. Suck it, Loki. Love the show, except the Mac hating, Ali. There you go. Another fan mail for Loki. Well, maybe it's because he's doing that whole dual-booting thing that his mouse is so screwed up. No, I have no idea. I have not been able to play. Bioshock won't even run on my archaic PC, so I couldn't tell you, but I'm curious, chat room, maybe is there somebody in chat that's playing Bioshock on the PC that would care to enlighten us? Does the mouse feel weird to you guys? What do you guys think about his other story where he says that you cannot trade video games if you're under 18? You have to have photo ID to trade games. You probably have a lot of theft of video games and stuff, and people are just tired of dealing with it. So they're blaming the damn kids. Yep, it's those damn kids. They make laws for reasons, so, you know, obviously they've had reason to make such a law because, you know, they were getting too much theft or people turn in stuff. I could understand needing a photo ID. I don't understand the 18 thing, but... I think all of them require photo ID. Yeah, they do now, so, I mean, 16 and up, I can see that. All right, well, let's go to the next email. Goldbanjo14 in our chat room says, that law is bullshit. Let's go to the next email in our mailbag. mailbagandorangelsrader.com. This one's not signed, so I will attribute it to Nick C, and it's titled, I agree with Loki. Hi, my name Nick, and I have been listening since I got a PSP when it first came and found the OLR PSP website. I'm reading this as is, you guys. Wow, this is a terrible email. I listen live once and a while and download the podcast all the time. I'm thinking he typed it on his PSP, so I'm giving him a break. So, listening to your podcast helped me out when buying a DDR game for my sister. I agree with Loki on Apple. I hat every product made by Apple. People always get made when I bash on Apple all the time, saying that Apple is good with their crappy iPods and Macs that are overpriced. So, what do you think he meant by hat? Was it hate or half? It's hate. I think it's half. It says, I hate every product made by Apple. People always get mad, but I read it as is. People always get mad when I bash on Apple all the time, saying that Apple is good with their crappy iPods and Macs that are overpriced, and I hope they unlock the iPhone so I can make fun of more people that bought an iPod that makes calls. So, there you go, Loki. At least you have the bad grammar kids agree with you. Okay, you know, still though, you've got to admit, I mean, $600 for a phone? Come on. I mean, if it were a Microsoft phone, I would still be giving people crap for it. I'm like, why the fuck are you spending $600 on a phone? That's what I want to know. Here's my thing. I'll tell you straight up right now. You know I love Macs and all that stuff, so I'm not going to hate on it or whatever, but here's the thing is that I did notice when I was at the airport this week, because I did spend a lot of my week in L.A. this week, is that there are tons of assholes out there with iPhones that don't even know how to use them. It's becoming this trendy thing amongst men and businesswomen to use, and there's a lot of assholes out there with iPhones, so go figure. All right. Because it's expensive and excessive, just like SUVs. Hey, if you're an Apple fan boy, fan girl, and you bought one because you want to support the great Apple in the sky, then go for it. It's all good. No hate. No hate from here. We'll do one more here. This is from Nate. Hi, Nate. Good day to you. I've been listening to your podcast for a couple months now, starting with your fifth anniversary show, and I find it very entertaining. I just want to let you know that despite Sky's frequent admonishments of the show going off subject, I find this very quality to be one of the most appealing aspects of your podcast. I am but a poor commoner and don't have any of the next gen systems, so I have to make do with the pre-DS and Wii Nintendo systems. As such, a lot of the hot news regarding Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, etc., I just don't have much interest in, although it is nice to keep up with what's happening in the industry just for the sake of staying well informed. Long story short, what keeps me coming back each week is the chemistry between you guys, your weird but hilarious sense of humor, and yes, even the bizarre rants and ostensibly off-subject forays into movies, comics, social commentary, cat websites, etc. Oh, and of course, all that forbidden sexual tension between Sky and Dark Sakura. Wow, that person obviously doesn't listen to this show whatsoever. What? What? You may have missed a small detail about me that would mean I would not think of Dark Sakura like that, although I wish she was here to react to that. That would be kind of funny. I'm going to leave that in the mail bag and see if she reads it next week. And then he closes with, keep up the good work. Thank you very much, even if that sexual tension is extremely misplaced. Maybe I could do one more. One more? All right. One more from Nintendo Maniac 64. Oh, boy. I've already said this twice in chat, but honestly, this is important in my opinion. In the final area in Super Metroid, below the four boss statues, make sure you only save in the first save room. If you save in the second one, you've already gone past a certain point where there's a room where its door is gray and deactivated, resulting in you being trapped, except for being able to complete the game. This would prevent you from going back and collecting any power ups you may have missed. Note, I learned this the hard way. I even had all the reserve tanks and energy tanks. So, boy, you got screwed, didn't you? Sorry, buddy. Sorry to hear it. All right, that's it for e-mail. Again, if you want to send us an e-mail, mailbag at orangelaundry.com is the place to do it. Yes. Anyways, we touched on this a little bit, I think, last week and a few weeks before. Neo Geo titles are confirmed to be coming to the Virtual Console and as soon as this month. In fact, September 11th, you'll be getting a few games, including Fatal Fury, Magical Lord, and God, I can't remember the last one. World Heroes. Those are each going to cost a whopping 900 Wii points. No word on whether they're coming to the US. I imagine at some point they will. Magical Lord is fucking awesome. I'm glad to see that's, you know, in the initial allotment there, because I remember playing that a lot. For some reason, you know, these grocery chains around here had Neo Geo machines a while back, so while my parents were checking out, I would be playing Magical Lord. I would think it's inevitable that the game's going to come at some point. Yeah. State side, I mean. But we'll see. We shall see. Alright, let's get on with some release dates and things that you can check out long before these Neo Geo games come state side. Although, we are going to start with the Japanese release dates, so I guess we're doing things a little backwards. Coming out on the Xbox 360, Fatal Inertia is coming out on September 6th, and that's, again, in Japan, if you want to check that game out. Going over to some other systems, on the Nintendo Wii, there's this game called Shin Chuka Taisen, Maikel to Meme no Boken, which is coming out from Starfish, and this looks to be a game. I'm trying to look at some of the screenshots. Looks like a little bit of a side scroller, action-y type game, like a throwback to an old, you know, like Mario type game. That's kind of cool. I wonder if they'll bring that state side. Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii, nothing this week, but we can go over to the PlayStation 3, and I can tell you that there is another Pachinko game coming out. There's always something coming out. And then, let's see, going to the PlayStation 2. Now, there's a lot of stuff on the PlayStation 2, including Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories finally making its way to the Japanese PlayStation 2 this week. Also, Dear My Son, but that's S-U-N, Sun, is coming out this week, as well as EA Sports Rugby 08, and Willow Wisp is coming out as well on the PlayStation 2. Going over to the Nintendo DS, Theta is coming out this week, and also a game from Bandai called, well, let's just call it Mahjong, because that's what it is. It's a Mahjong game. Let's just leave it at that. Really quickly, seeing if there's anything on the PSP worth mentioning, Sony's putting out a game called Rezel Cross. That might be kind of interesting. It's an RPG, and it's from Sony themselves. The script is written by the folks who did Ark the Lad 3 and 4, so if you like Ark the Lad, you might like this game. There you have it, Japan releases. In the US, on PlayStation 2, I hope you like Naruto, because Naruto Uzumaki Chronicles 2 is the only PS2 game coming out this week. On other systems, though, let's see, 360, we've got Medal of Honor Airborne that's also coming out on PC. Stranglehold is also coming out on Xbox 360, both the standard and collector's edition. On PSP and DS, Worms Open Warfare 2, because the Worms games are awesome. And, let's see here, on PlayStation 3, you get a big fat nothing. And then, of course, on the Wii, Pool Party, and no, that's not with water, that is billiards. And, let's see, also on the DS, Garfield Nightmares, which I'm sure is awesome, and PC games, two games that I have to love, I guess. I Love Kittens and I Love Puppies. Hooray, I Love Kittens, that sounds like fun. Let's see, other fun games, is there a Tycoon game this week, because I'm going to be very disappointed if there is not. And, no, no Tycoon game. Nice, sorry to hear it. Well, going over to European release dates, since Dark Sakura is not here, I still got a lot of love for you, Europe. I'm going to go and look at your release dates real quick. On the 7th, all these games on the 7th, Blazing Angels coming out on Xbox 360 and the PC. This would be the secret missions from Ubisoft. Crazy Taxi Fair Wars on the PSP. Two Worlds makes its way to the PC and the Xbox 360. And Valkyrie Profile 2 Slumera is coming out on the PlayStation 2. God, that game came out over here like a year ago, didn't it? Just about. God, it's about time you guys got it. Sorry to hear it, folks. Alright, well, that's it for release dates. Not that I think it's a real big disappointment that they haven't gotten it yet. Well, there's some Valkyrie Profile fans out there, I'm sure are sad. Anyways, there's an interesting game coming out in Japan, of course, because, God forbid, you know, that something like this come out over here. It's created by the team, Sega's Feel the Magic team, and it uses voice recognition technology to decipher how people really feel. It's called Koroko Scan, and apparently they have a hilarious clip on YouTube that's talking, they're interviewing, I guess, a girl and her boyfriend, and they were asking, I guess, how he feels about living together and marriage and stuff like that, and I guess it came up that he was cheating on her or something. Well, yes. I want to play with that game. That'd be fun. Any chances might come out over here? Nope, but, hey, thank goodness that those games are region-free, so, awesome. Oh, that's right, you said you'd have to be able to read Japanese to actually play them, so what the hell? It doesn't matter. Alright, well, this might be a little more mainstream, and this is coming out on the Nintendo DS, I don't know when, I'm assuming, sometime within the next year or so. The Legend of Kage, Part 2. Some folks, if you don't know how to pronounce things right, might call this Legend of Kage, because this came out years ago on NES, but The Legend of Kage is coming out on the DS, a new sequel to it, and this was something that was spotted in Famitsu Magazine with some screenshots and everything, so, pretty cool. If you like The Legend of Kage. I know that's a NES game that a lot of people liked, so. I think it's on Virtual Console now, right? I think so. Possibly. I thought I saw that it was coming back to Virtual Console, so there you go. Well, if you are looking for a game that's not so mainstream and definitely a lot cheaper, you may be interested in Rose Camellia DS. Now if you're not familiar of Rose and Camellia, it's a women's slapping game that's a Flash game right now, but it is being ported over to the DS via the homebrew community, and actually it's funny, the guy that's doing it happens to be French and needs help finishing the game, but still though, if you want to check it out, you can definitely check out the free Flash game site, and it is BeyondDS.free.fr. For the record, that game is fucking rad. The slapping game, I love that game. Slapping game, yeah. I love the slapping game. Have you ever played the slapping game, the Flash game, Shane? I know you've been checked out at the show. I think I tried to play it at work once and it wouldn't work right. I'm sorry to hear it. It's a fun game. It sounds funny, because you slap women. But you're a woman slapping the women, so it's okay. It doesn't matter. As long as the woman is getting slapped, all is right. Wow, you can send those cards and letters too. What's your email? Miklatov? Anyhow. Also announced for a Nintendo platform, not quite as huh, but it's pretty cool nonetheless. Coming to the Wii, Worms, a space odyssey. It's another game in the Worms series, and of course it will be taking advantage of the Wii's motion control system, but what's really cool about this, online worldwide play, which is not something you've been seeing a whole lot of Nintendo releases lately, so that is certainly very promising. This was announced by an official press release from THQ Inc. this week. Buying it. You're that big a fan of Worms. I love me some Worms. Just an FYI, there is still the Worms Open Warfare 2 being made for the DS and PSP. Wow, they must still really have a fan base for these games, because they crank them out left and right. Oh yeah. Are you buying all of these games, Logie? No, I bought the very first one that came out on the PC years ago, and that's the last one I bought. I think the last game I bought was for the PC, and it was Worms Armageddon. They do have one of the Worms games on GameTap, so that's one of the ones I've played too. I've been meaning to buy the one on Xbox Live Arcade, but I haven't got around to it yet. Alright. One game I'm definitely going to be around to buying is Manhunt 2, and of course people are still pissed off that the game got re-rated down to an M. They want to know why they're demanding answers, and guess what? The ESRB says, uh-uh, we ain't giving you no fucking answers. So here's their statement basically. The FTC, the National PTA, the Kaiser Family Foundation, and the Peter Hart Research team have all found that parents are overwhelmingly satisfied with the ESRB rating system, rather than publicly second-guessing what is unmistakably a strong warning to parents about the suitability of particular games for children, which presumably neither Senator Yee or the CCFC have personally reviewed. We feel that a more productive tact would be joining us in encouraging parents to take their ratings seriously when buying games for their children. You show them. So in other words, no, yeah, they re-rate it. What do they change to re-rate it? Well, fuck off. You don't get to find out. Actually, they can find out if they buy certain versions of the game in other countries and check it against them. Or maybe they didn't change much at all. Maybe they appealed or something and got it. It's freakin' okay. 17 and 18-year-olds, come on. We've discussed this before. There's not much maturity difference between a 17 and 18-year-old, okay? It's just one gets more held accountable to certain things. But other than that, really, and the whole ESRB rating system is all fucked up anyway, so big deal. It's mature now. What the fuck do you want? They just want it banned because they're fuckin' hypocrites. We want to ban everything. Keep our children safe. Oh my God. I'm more impressed that they did it this quick. I mean, we all thought the game was just not going to come out for like a year now because of this, and it seems like not even a month later, it's all fixed. So it makes me think whatever they change wasn't that much. It wasn't that much. It was probably stupid things. Remember when we talked about Lair last week and how they had to change stuff to get a teen rating, they couldn't show blood, but they could show people being burned alive. I mean, like there's a big difference there or something. So it's just, it's really stupid the requirements that they have. It's just like the, you know, MPA, it's all fucked up. But I don't know. I like how these people that haven't played the game at all can criticize, you know, the rating system or anything like that. They have no clue on what's going on, yet they're just like, oh, we want the game banned. It's horrible. They're going to be selling it to children, you know, despite the fact that it's, you know, over 17. Who cares? If it's being sold to children and you're a parent, you're going to just be like, oh my God, he bought it. I can't do nothing. It's too late. Jimmy's going to go kill people now. What they need to do is just say, hey, where'd you get that game? I'm taking this back. Or break the disc in half or something. I don't know. You have control over your damn kids. Do something. It's like they act like their parents are powerless. It's like, oh no, he's got it in his hands now. I can't take it away from him. We're doomed. Lots of comments from chat here. Fire Bulma says, won't somebody think of the children? Let's see. Escapist says, maybe they just had to excise some extreme cut scenes to Manhunt 2 down to an M. Son of Dad speculates, Manhunt wasn't changed. It was a publicity stunt. Interesting. GS 191 says, I'm 19. I don't feel any more different than when I was 17. Sure, I learned a lot of things, but these people forget that there's a lot of kids that know the difference between real and fake. Yeah, but isn't it fair to say, unfortunately, there's some that don't, and there's even some 20-year-olds that don't? Shouldn't you be more worried about your kids going and having underage sex and doing drugs and all sorts of things like that, rather than playing violent video games? I would think that you would be more encouraging of kids playing games that require them not to leave the house to do malicious things. I don't know about you, but I think, given the two choices, I'll take my kids playing violent video games. Fire Bulma in chat has a funny comment that says, my precious, unique snowflake would never do drugs. Or play these violent video games, I'm sure. I mean, seriously, how dumb are people? Really? Who doesn't enjoy a little bit of violence once in a while? Do you like violence, Shane? Yes. You do? Okay, that's good. No, only sometimes. Only sometimes? What types of violence do you like? The stuff that doesn't look too real. I can't stand the real stuff. Okay. All right. Just wanted to give you some... Violence against women. I just... Again, those cards and letters. You want to hear a funny story? Sorry. Sure, why not? This refers to last week when we were talking about Imagine Babies. I actually talked to the company that's making Imagine Babies. I think Ubisoft's putting it up. And I mentioned to them about the baby shaking. They did not know that. They didn't? I'm like, you can rock the baby with one part. I'm like, and if you shake it really fast, you're actually shaking babies. So it was fascinating. I don't want them to change that. They're not going to change that. Okay, good. Good job, Loki, ruining Imagine Babies. I know. Good job, ass. Wow, this show has gone to all sorts of places. I didn't think it would go tonight. It's because Jamie's not here to keep us in check and make pouty faces. And flip me off. A lot of controversy going around about E for All, specifically when it comes to Electronic Arts. Here's what's interesting is that there was word going around that Electronic Arts had dropped out of the show this week because I guess they suddenly didn't show up in some advertising material for the show, which started to make people go, well, gee, who's left besides Nintendo and Konami and a couple others? But Electronic Arts was contacted a little later in the week, and EA has reaffirmed that, yes, they are going to E for All. So if you want a chance to play Rock Band early, you still have a chance, because obviously if EA is going, they're bringing that game with them, because they've trucked it everywhere the past couple months. As long as the show is still on and my badge forwards to my new address, like it should, I am planning to go to E for All. I've already registered and all that crap and got the time off work, so... I haven't registered yet, but I don't know if the wife would let me. I should just register and just not go. Well, do whatever you want, but I'm going to try and go, and if All Games is doing anything down there, I'm sure I'll hang with them. Because otherwise I don't want to have to go by myself. It's going to be sad. Shane, I might have to drag you with me if you can. Go. I don't know. Depending on what's going on. Alright, well anything else in this Part A? We're kind of running a short show tonight. I don't know what's up with that. Oh, that's just Part A. That's just Part A. That's right. There's plenty more to come. Tonight in Part B, we're going to be playing a little bit of Beat the Host. So you might want to get your phones nearby or your Skype line ready, because we'll be taking the first caller to play Beat the Host. Not now, but when we come back and we tell you to call in. And if you haven't heard Beat the Host, it's a lot of fun. Stay tuned for tonight's Beat the Host. We'll be right back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.0, "text": " Orange Lounge Radio", "tokens": [11942, 36333, 8829], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.3690982952452542, "compression_ratio": 1.2654320987654322, "no_speech_prob": 0.12364713847637177}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 7.0, "end": 14.0, "text": " With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco.", "tokens": [2080, 534, 11453, 11, 3801, 20574, 11, 5274, 11, 290, 15181, 78, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.3690982952452542, "compression_ratio": 1.2654320987654322, "no_speech_prob": 0.12364713847637177}, {"id": 2, "seek": 0, "start": 14.0, "end": 27.0, "text": " Tonight, September 2nd, 2007, Xbox Live gets a Labor Day sale, PlayStation gets a SingStar bundle, and an old PC gaming classic is now free.", "tokens": [27117, 11, 2693, 362, 358, 11, 4343, 11, 9445, 7547, 3011, 257, 7882, 3596, 5466, 11, 14047, 3011, 257, 5573, 8248, 18537, 11, 290, 281, 1468, 4217, 7776, 6833, 318, 783, 1479, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.3690982952452542, "compression_ratio": 1.2654320987654322, "no_speech_prob": 0.12364713847637177}, {"id": 3, "seek": 2700, "start": 27.0, "end": 30.0, "text": " Orange Lounge Radio", "tokens": [50363, 11942, 36333, 8829, 50513], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4501353104909261, "compression_ratio": 0.7916666666666666, "no_speech_prob": 0.0010648262687027454}, {"id": 4, "seek": 5700, "start": 57.0, "end": 60.0, "text": " But joining us, as always, say hello to Loki.", "tokens": [887, 9679, 514, 11, 355, 1464, 11, 910, 23748, 284, 31771, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.1654850307263826, "compression_ratio": 1.5, "no_speech_prob": 0.9732662439346313}, {"id": 5, "seek": 5700, "start": 60.0, "end": 61.0, "text": " Yes.", "tokens": [3363, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.1654850307263826, "compression_ratio": 1.5, "no_speech_prob": 0.9732662439346313}, {"id": 6, "seek": 5700, "start": 61.0, "end": 62.0, "text": " How are you doing, Loki?", "tokens": [1374, 389, 345, 1804, 11, 31771, 30], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.1654850307263826, "compression_ratio": 1.5, "no_speech_prob": 0.9732662439346313}, {"id": 7, "seek": 5700, "start": 62.0, "end": 64.0, "text": " I'm fine.", "tokens": [314, 1101, 3734, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.1654850307263826, "compression_ratio": 1.5, "no_speech_prob": 0.9732662439346313}, {"id": 8, "seek": 5700, "start": 64.0, "end": 67.0, "text": " You're fine?
