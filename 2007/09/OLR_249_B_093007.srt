Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,440
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, September the 30th

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,120
of 2007, I almost said 2008, what's wrong with me?

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,640
We're getting into October, very soon, and gosh, where did the year go?

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,520
I don't know, pretty soon we're going to be getting into just this games upon games

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,520
upon game release.

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,400
Well, really, we're kind of already in the middle of that, really, with the launch of

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,760
Halo 3 and Bioshock, we're really in the gaming season.

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,740
So be good or Santa's not going to bring you the games you want.

14
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,660
But we will keep bringing you the gaming news you want, whether you've been good or bad.

15
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,120
So we're going to get right back into some gaming news, aren't we, Loki?

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,440
Yes, and you know, this game's kind of interesting, I don't know how popular it's going to be,

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,840
because you've got, you know, kind of conflicting elements to it.

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:15,400
For example, well Mario and Sonic at the Olympics, now Mario and Sonic games, those are good.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,640
Olympic games, those are usually bad.

20
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,220
So it's kind of, I don't know, I don't know if it's going to be good or not.

21
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,660
Either way, this could go either way.

22
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:31,320
Either way, there will be 16 characters, including your favorites from both the Sonic and Mario

23
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,440
and I guess Nintendo universes.

24
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,700
Although what's weird though is I do see the villain from one of the alligators from the

25
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,160
Donkey Kong Country franchises, yet no Donkey Kong.

26
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,160
Odd.

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,380
So that was kind of neat.

28
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:55,680
And then, you know, they have of course Sonic and Knuckles and Tails and etc.

29
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,880
So anyways, some of the events that you're going to see in there, fencing, they've got

30
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,880
that.

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:10,080
Archery, shooting skeet, gymnastics, including trampoline and vault, high jump, pole vault,

32
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,200
long jump, triple jump, javelin throw, hammer throw, single skulls for rowing of course,

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,680
table tennis, aquatics in both the 100 meter and of course the 4 lap 100 meter.

34
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,960
And let's see here, tracks of course, 110 meter, 400 meter hurdles, 100 meter relay

35
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,280
and the just normal 100 meter and 400 meter.

36
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,760
So lots of running and stuff.

37
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
I don't know.

38
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,900
I still don't understand how Mario is ever going to beat Sonic in running.

39
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,120
Like nobody's been able to explain this logic to me.

40
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,080
Like did they give Sonic some like drugs to slow him down or Mario some steroids?

41
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,800
I mean what, how is that ever going to be an even match?

42
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,240
The characters in the game, I mean it's, they've kind of broken them up like they did with

43
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,760
Mario Kart where you've got the power types, you know, the ones that are more of the robust

44
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,840
characters like Bowser and you know Wario, stuff like that, and Knuckles is in there

45
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
too.

46
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
So apparently Knuckles is a fat ass.

47
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,360
Well, he's a fatty.

48
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,400
But they say, well he does have a little bit of a gut.

49
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,000
What they're saying, Dark Knight says in our chat room at chat.orangelandsreading.com,

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,120
they balance the characters.

51
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,280
I understand they balance the characters but that still doesn't make sense in the regards

52
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,360
of that Sonic, you know, runs very fast and Mario runs kind of fast.

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,700
They also have all round characters which Mario falls under as well as Luigi and apparently

54
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,240
also the two chicks from the Sonic universe.

55
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,760
So Mario and Luigi, you're as powerful as chicks.

56
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,440
Way to go, pansies.

57
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,440
Anyways and then...

58
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,240
Woah, I think there might be some women a little angry at that comment.

59
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,080
Well, I mean, honestly.

60
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,640
Mr. DeBucket in chat says they wouldn't let Bowser into the Chinese Olympics.

61
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,640
Yeah.

62
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:01,520
And then of course for the speed types, you have Sonic, you actually have, what's his

63
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,520
name...

64
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
Tails.

65
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,880
Oh, the crappy game, what was the crappy game?

66
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,880
Driver.

67
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,400
No, the Sonic game, crappy Sonic game.

68
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
Sonic the Hedgehog.

69
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,720
No, the last one that came out before Sonic...

70
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
I don't know.

71
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
The guy with the gun.

72
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
I don't know.

73
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,720
Oh, Shadow the Hedgehog?

74
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
Shadow, yes.

75
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
Thank you.

76
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,400
Sorry, they all look alike and those games kind of blend together so pardon me for forgetting

77
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
that crappy game.

78
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:35,480
And then of course the skill types where you have Princess Peach, Tails, Waluigi, and Dr.

79
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,840
Eggman.

80
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,880
I hope Princess Peach will be able to use her emotional power in the Olympic game somehow.

81
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,720
Well, that would be a skill, I guess.

82
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,400
That's right, some type of skill.

83
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:52,400
I don't know, so it's going to be all split up, who knows, I don't know, but to be honest,

84
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,900
I don't like, I don't think I'm going to buy this game.

85
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,900
It's just...

86
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,900
Maybe I'd run it.

87
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,360
All it seems to me is it's like, hey, we put out another crappy Olympics game, but we have

88
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,280
Sonic and Mario this time, so you're going to buy it, right?

89
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
Huh?

90
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,280
Huh?

91
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,280
Yeah?

92
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,840
Maybe we'll have advertising for these games during the Olympics and that kind of crap,

93
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,720
so cross promotion stuff.

94
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,340
Be honest though, I think you guys are going to get suckered into buying another crappy

95
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,460
Olympics game because it has characters that you like, so have at it.

96
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,120
I'll be busy playing Super Mario Galaxy instead.

97
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,720
Well, I will be busy playing Super Smash Brothers Brawl when that comes out.

98
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:38,800
Oh yeah, upon its release, yes, and one thing that has lots of fanboys and girls very excited,

99
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,800
especially if you're a David Hayter fanboy or fangirl, which I believe Dark Soccer is

100
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
a David Hayter fangirl.

101
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,160
Oh yeah, because he could just talk to me all day and I'll be happy.

102
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,160
Do you watch his YouTube?

103
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,200
Apparently, he has a YouTube site where he does all these little Q&A things and does

104
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
stuff on there.

105
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
I didn't know that.

106
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
I'll have to check.

107
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
You definitely should check that out.

108
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,880
This guy named Archduke Chocula was checking it out and sent David Hayter a question that

109
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,240
said, hello, David Hayter, I have to say you are one of the greatest voice actors ever

110
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,800
and you do a great job as Snake.

111
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,800
I was wondering, are you going to voice Snake in the Super Smash Brothers Brawl, to which

112
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,320
David Hayter responded, I am indeed voicing Snake in Smash Brothers.

113
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,880
I recorded it already and I believe that fans of both games are going to be extremely happy.

114
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,080
It's very cool.

115
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,240
That's all I can say.

116
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,780
So this is authentic Snake now because it's the same voice actor and everything.

117
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:33,000
So that's just one more cool thing that you can put on the ever-growing list of cool things

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
in Smash Brothers Brawl.

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I mean, seriously.

120
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I love David Hayter.

121
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
They've got Resetti in there.

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,760
Dude, they put fucking Resetti in Smash Brothers Brawl.

123
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
That's great.

124
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,200
What is he going to do, bitch at you until you die?

125
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,520
He comes out and lectures you on the mechanics of how to play the game, I think.

126
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,040
Wasn't that the impression I got from, I don't think he's like an item or anything.

127
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,280
He lectures you on how to play the game.

128
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,060
I want Mr. Saturn still in the game as an item because I love Mr. Saturn.

129
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,680
I just want Ness.

130
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,680
Is that too much to ask?

131
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,680
PK Fire.

132
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,960
Or how about like, was it Howard and Nestor?

133
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
That'd be hilarious.

134
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,600
Dark Knight says, I would love to have a Smash Brothers on the DS.

135
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,040
Dude, I bet that'll be the next one.

136
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,520
I bet that'll be the next one.

137
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,520
Yeah.

138
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,520
Anyway.

139
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,140
Well, speaking of things, Nintendo, for Virtual Console coming out in the UK, Sin and Punishment

140
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:22,240
is the recent addition, which was a Nintendo 64 game.

141
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:30,000
Pretty cool game and it supposedly just came out looking really nice on the Wii, so it's

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,360
out there for 1200 Wii points, which translates in money to 12 euro or 8 pounds 40.

143
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,400
And then moving on to the next releases in the UK.

144
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,160
Did you have a comment?

145
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,160
Nope.

146
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,160
I had no comments.

147
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,840
You looked like you had anticipation.

148
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
No.

149
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,360
We also have The Legend of Hero Tanma.

150
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,800
I would like Anticipation to be released on Virtual Console.

151
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
That was an awesome game.

152
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Anticipation.

153
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
No it wasn't.

154
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,200
I see you shiver.

155
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
With Anticipation.

156
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
Okay.

157
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Never mind.

158
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Please move on.

159
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Say it!

160
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
No.

161
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:10,000
TurboGrafx-16 game, The Legend of Hero Tanma, 600 Wii points, which is a little platformer

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,800
kind of like Wonder Boy.

163
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,600
You go save a princess and do shit.

164
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
So, yeah.

165
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,160
You sure know how to sell those games.

166
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,160
Yeah, whatever.

167
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,160
Yeah, check out this game.

168
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,480
You go save a princess and do shit.

169
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,400
Dude, I'm saving the best for last.

170
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Alright.

171
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
So it's Mario?

172
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
No.

173
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Zelda?

174
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
No.

175
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
Just, you know, some princess.

176
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Wonder Boy!

177
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,040
Wonder Boy in Monsterland did come out, didn't it?

178
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,040
Mmm.

179
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,040
I think so.

180
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,040
I love Wonder Boy in Monsterland.

181
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,040
But anyway.

182
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:42,640
Gradius III, which was a SNES game, 900 Wii points.

183
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,160
And dude, it's fucking Gradius, so you won it right now.

184
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:51,040
And I think that's also part of that Japanese gamey thing that, you know, are the releasing

185
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,560
games in the UK that we don't have over here.

186
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,560
Gradius III.

187
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,560
Sad.

188
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,960
I actually have Gradius III, though.

189
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,040
It's in the Gradius collection on PSP.

190
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,640
Well, but I actually have a cart.

191
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,400
Well, can I touch you?

192
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
You're just so cool.

193
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
I have Gradius II.

194
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,880
I just want a little piece of your coolness.

195
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,680
I have Gradius II on Turbo Duo, which is the best version of that game ever.

196
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,080
Can we get to another story before Jamie's ego gets too big?

197
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,080
She can't leave my house.

198
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,080
Yes.

199
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,840
I have to have the ultimate gamer ego.

200
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:26,440
Speaking of the Turbo Duo, there are going to be a couple games coming out, actually

201
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,240
as part of the first Turbo CD games being announced for the Virtual Console.

202
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,360
The first two are going to be Gates of Thunder, or Gate of Thunder.

203
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,320
And they'll be coming out for 800 Wii points, as well as Super Air Zonk will be coming out

204
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
as well.

205
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,480
That was such a bizarre little game.

206
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,520
Turbo Graphics XVI was a bizarre little console, so it makes perfect sense.

207
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,800
But it has some great stuff on it.

208
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,000
I pressed the bathroom door to get a copy of Pac-Land.

209
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Remember the button?

210
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,640
Oh my god, that was so long ago.

211
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
I know, that was great.

212
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
You have to set the door.

213
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,360
Okay, well, we were at Classic Gaming Expo, right?

214
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,080
And they were selling Pac-Land on the Turbo Graphics XVI.

215
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,680
I was, what, $5 short?

216
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,080
And Jamie was like, I want that, I just need $5 to get it.

217
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,240
And so, what did we, there was this little, god, this is so stupid, I can't believe we're

218
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
telling this story.

219
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,680
It was the bathroom, there were three doors that had the automatic button.

220
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,800
But seriously, Jamie, this was a, you had to be there thing.

221
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,960
The listeners are going to be like, this story isn't funny at all.

222
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,960
But I will do stuff for Turbo Graphics games.

223
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,120
This little girl we saw, she ran up and pressed the button to open the handicapped restroom

224
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,040
and then ran away.

225
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,700
And for some reason this was the most hilarious thing in the world to us, like we were laughing

226
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,700
and laughing at this little girl.

227
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,700
We were that bored.

228
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,160
And we, I guess so.

229
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,200
So I said to Jamie, I said Jamie, if you mimic what that little girl just did, I'll give

230
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,420
you $5.

231
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,420
And she did it.

232
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,420
We took pictures.

233
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,420
They're somewhere.

234
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,420
Because, I don't know.

235
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,160
Do you know how many times I've played that copy of Pac-Land?

236
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Hmm.

237
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
Once.

238
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,160
Really?

239
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
Not even on the actual duo.

240
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
I played it on a Turbo Express.

241
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
I want my $5 back.

242
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
No.

243
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,160
You can come play my game though.

244
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
I don't wanna.

245
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,840
Another game, well another Turbo Graphics game announced as well, Samurai Ghost.

246
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,080
But of course that's not a Turbo CD title.

247
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,760
Wow, more people just entered the studio.

248
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
What is that?

249
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,760
Keep going with the story.

250
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,120
Ignore them for a minute.

251
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,600
So that's it.

252
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,560
All your Turbo CD games.

253
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,460
Was that it?

254
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,880
No more news on Turbo Graphics CD games?

255
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Nope.

256
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,880
That was it.

257
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,880
Well.

258
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:38,140
Going back to Nintendo Wii, Fatal Frame is being developed for the Nintendo Wii.

259
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,680
It's being developed by Grasshopper and it's being published by Tecmo.

260
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,280
And it's being worked on very soon, I guess, right now.

261
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,100
And it's kinda cool because Fatal Frame is very popular, well, it's no Silent Hill or

262
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,220
Resident Evil, but it's probably on that secondary tier of scary video games and so we're always

263
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,880
curious to see how games translate over to the Wii.

264
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,860
But you can bet there'll probably be something to do with photography and the Wiimote and

265
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,000
all that stuff.

266
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,760
All that stuff is very, you know, specific, Rob.

267
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,760
Absolutely.

268
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,360
Well, this makes me a happy, happy, happy bunny.

269
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,240
One of my favorite games ever...

270
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,540
They're distracting me, Rob!

271
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,440
To ignore them and read the story.

272
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:27,380
One of my favorite ever games is Samba de Amigo and there is a statement that it is

273
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,360
going to be on the Wii.

274
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:36,360
It's supposedly this cover scan from Nintendo Power that's floating around ye old interwebs

275
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:44,440
showing a Samba de Amigo for the Wii.

276
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,840
Samba de Amigo on the Wii is going to be awesome.

277
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,240
There's nothing, though, in the issue regarding gameplay, so...

278
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,240
Alright.

279
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,440
So, yeah.

280
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,740
Anyway, let's introduce, you know, X-Defer and Rice Princess barged in here, so I thought

281
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,280
I'd let them say hello.

282
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,520
Well, hello there.

283
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,800
I'm British now.

284
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,120
What are you kids up to this evening?

285
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,360
We basically came here to say hi.

286
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,280
I haven't been on Orange Laundry in a while.

287
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,640
Well, I mean, since I called in.

288
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,640
I like it that way!

289
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
Awwww.

290
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,160
Were you here last week?

291
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,360
Well, no, I called in last week.

292
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,160
Oh, that's right.

293
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,840
But I decided to...

294
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
It's me and Rice Princess.

295
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,840
Say hi, Rice Princess.

296
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,320
Hi, Rice Princess.

297
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,440
Okay.

298
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,080
And we just want to say hi.

299
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,960
And oh, yeah, we want you to do a song that we want on the cage match.

300
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,920
Okay, well, that's after the show.

301
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,120
We'll worry about that later.

302
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,400
But for right now, what games have you guys been playing?

303
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
You need to make this gaming-related.

304
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,720
Don't just come onto the show and be all, hi, I'm here, and you should care about that,

305
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,480
because, you know, we might have new listeners who don't know who the fuck you are.

306
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,840
So, what kinds of games have you been playing this week?

307
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
The Game of Life.

308
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,840
No, I pulled in...

309
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,240
You lost!

310
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:03,280
I've been playing WoW and also Puzzle Quest, which is just usual stuff.

311
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,360
I think that's what I said last week, Rice Princess.

312
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
That is what you said last week.

313
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,160
I'm just kidding.

314
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:17,440
I've been playing WoW, and I played Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo last night at a certain

315
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,320
party that was thrown that I attended.

316
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,320
It was fun.

317
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,960
Now, I have a question about Puzzle Fighter II, because you loved the one that was on

318
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,320
Sony PlayStation and the old-school one.

319
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,640
How does the Xbox 360 one compare?

320
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,300
The game itself isn't bad, but the controller is god-awful.

321
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,120
Like when I wanted to press down, it would go, like, to the left or to the right.

322
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,120
It made me mad.

323
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,680
Am I being too quiet?

324
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,200
I'm sorry about that.

325
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,240
I will raise my voice.

326
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,840
Yeah, the game itself isn't bad, but the controller is, like, a nightmare to use to play that

327
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,840
game.

328
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,840
But, yeah.

329
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,840
I enjoyed it thoroughly.

330
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,840
Yep.

331
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,280
Did you try the remix mode with the different drop patterns and stuff?

332
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,280
No.

333
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,280
What?

334
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,160
I only went into one mode.

335
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,440
I just kept pressing A until the game started, so.

336
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,800
There's like way more to the game.

337
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,120
There's, like, all these different, like, you can play modes where you don't even just

338
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,120
make bricks.

339
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,680
You make, like, different things, and you need to check out the game a little more thoroughly.

340
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,280
That was a very bad review job you did.

341
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,280
Fired!

342
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,920
Well, listen, son of a bitch, you should have told me.

343
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,920
I would have done that.

344
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,320
I just kept pressing A because I really wanted to play the game, like, because I, you know

345
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,360
what, I'm, like, the best at the game out of all of you, so.

346
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,360
That's why you're making fun of me, because you're jealous of my skills.

347
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,840
All right, no more derailing the show.

348
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,240
We gotta get back to gaming news.

349
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,320
So you can stay if you want to contribute to news, otherwise get out.

350
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,760
Well, we actually, are we gonna go?

351
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,800
I guess, way to put me on the spot.

352
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Oh, okay.

353
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,200
Well, we can stay and listen.

354
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,240
All right.

355
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,240
You do that.

356
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,240
Let's get back to some gaming news.

357
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,080
All the listeners are like, back to gaming news?

358
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,400
Well, yeah, now Irene's like, I gotta go look at Puzzle Fighter.

359
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,400
All right.

360
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
Anyways.

361
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
Yes, please.

362
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,000
So, apparently the BAFTA nominees are really coming around.

363
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,240
For those not to know, that's the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.

364
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,480
They've announced their nominees to the 2007 Video Game Awards, and topping the list is

365
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,040
Wii Sports.

366
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:29,360
With seven nominations, including Innovation and Best Game categories, and of course there's

367
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,960
also a four-way tie for the second most nominations with Crackdown, awesome game, Gears of War,

368
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:41,480
also awesome game, Akami, and God of War 2, all awesome games.

369
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,360
I don't know if it should be Game of the Year, though.

370
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,900
It's pretty rad, though, that they give it such good recognition, though, over there.

371
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,160
Other nominees, of course, Bioshock, Crysis.

372
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,280
How could Crysis be nominated?

373
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,280
It's not even out yet.

374
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,920
Gears of War, which I already mentioned, Guitar Hero 2, and Kane & Lynch.

375
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,060
Also, Kane & Lynch is not out yet.

376
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:07,880
They need a gaming Oscars, and I'm not talking about, like, what is it, the Spike TV Awards

377
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,880
or whatever that crap is.

378
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,880
The G4ia Awards.

379
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,560
You know, does that even exist anymore?

380
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,960
I think it's now, like, a segment on X-Play.

381
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
It doesn't even matter.

382
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
E4All presents.

383
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,840
None of that stuff counts.

384
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,400
I want a gaming Oscars, something that's not a joke.

385
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Oh well.

386
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,920
Forget it.

387
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,080
The Howard and Nestor Awards.

388
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,080
No.

389
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,360
The Howard and Nestor Awards.

390
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,880
That would actually be pretty awesome.

391
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,840
Winners will be announced, of course, on October 23rd.

392
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,480
Well, Xbox 360 games seem to be moving over to the Nintendo DS.

393
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,000
Heck, Viva Pinata, as you know, was announced to have an incubation coming out on the Nintendo

394
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
DS.

395
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Guess what?

396
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,360
Blue Dragon is also on its way to the Nintendo DS.

397
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,400
Now, normally you'd kind of go, well, that doesn't seem like too big a surprise.

398
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,800
I mean, it kind of seems like the kind of game that could have been on the DS.

399
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:58,040
But when you consider that, you know, Mistwalker made it for Microsoft, it is kind of interesting

400
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,240
that the game is going to have an incubation on the DS.

401
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,360
This was coming from a recent issue of the manga Shonen Jump.

402
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,360
It's funny.

403
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,480
This is my Microsoft rep about Viva Pinata and who was publishing it.

404
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,480
He got on a plane and left.

405
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,480
Interesting.

406
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,280
He didn't have the answer for me.

407
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,280
Huh.

408
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,080
And then he got on a plane and left.

409
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,080
That was your answer.

410
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,080
I guess so.

411
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,080
The answer was...

412
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,080
He's like, look over there.

413
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,080
The answer was, what's that?

414
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,080
The answer was...

415
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,080
Run away.

416
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,080
Okay, thanks.

417
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,080
Bye.

418
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,080
For real.

419
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,080
I know.

420
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,080
Really.

421
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:42,080
There is a little speculation regarding Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass, and it was confirmed

422
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:51,120
that the producer, Eiji Aonuma, basically did agree that the game was a remake of the

423
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,000
very first Zelda game.

424
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,600
Or it must have started off that way, but it certainly hopefully hasn't ended up that

425
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,920
way, because I don't want to pony up that kind of money.

426
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,280
The game's already out, and I know people who play it who didn't say that it was just

427
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,280
like it.

428
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
But it was supposed to be...

429
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,280
What the crap?

430
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,280
Phantom Hourglass came out?

431
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,280
In Japan.

432
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,280
Oh, okay.

433
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,280
I had...

434
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,280
Remember, my friends have a...

435
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
Right, right, right.

436
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,280
Ninja Pass.

437
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,280
Sorry.

438
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,280
I was like, wait, wait, wait.

439
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,280
It came out over here?

440
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,280
I missed that.

441
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,520
But at any rate, it's saying that in his attempt to return to the root series, he unintentionally

442
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,840
remade the game.

443
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,840
So it's not really a complete remake.

444
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,840
It's more of like a...

445
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,840
An homage.

446
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
A spiritual remake.

447
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,960
When I hear that, though, I go, well, if it's an original, I don't know if I want it.

448
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
Well, I'm going to get it.

449
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,960
No, I know.

450
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
I'm going to get it, too.

451
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,840
Heck, even if it was a remake of the first game, I'd probably get it, because I'm a consumer

452
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
whore.

453
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,840
And how.

454
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,840
Exactly.

455
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:54,360
Anyways, so funny that you mention remakes, because the sex pixels are actually coming

456
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,680
together to re-record Anarchy in the UK.

457
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,560
And of course, this is going to be for Guitar Hero 3.

458
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,080
Why should you care?

459
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,580
Because it's a pretty cool song.

460
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,960
But yeah, they've come back together.

461
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,080
And it's the sex pistols getting back together.

462
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,400
That's kind of cool.

463
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
Exactly.

464
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,680
And so apparently they're going to be reissuing Anarchy in the UK, as well as part of the

465
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,020
celebration, they're going to be...

466
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,520
Our Guitar Hero 3 is going to be sponsoring the band's performance at the London Brixton

467
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,600
Academy on November 8th.

468
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,960
All in thanks to a video game.

469
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,200
Well, they're re-releasing, it's kind of co-advertising here.

470
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:38,600
It's basically, they're re-releasing their album, Nevermind the Bollocks.

471
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,480
Here's the Sex Pistols.

472
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,800
And that's coming out on the 29th, which is actually the day after Guitar Hero comes out

473
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
over here.

474
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,800
I don't know.

475
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:55,520
I don't know why they decided to re-record it, probably because it's good press.

476
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,040
Going to our chatroom, chat.orangetonsready.com, Dark Tetsuya asked, wasn't that in Guitar

477
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Freaks at one point?

478
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,800
Yes it was, but it was a shitty cover of it was in the game.

479
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,760
But the real deal Sex Pistols are getting back together.

480
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,160
And you know, Anarchy in the UK is one of those songs that's just like fun to kick ass

481
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,160
to.

482
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,520
You know, it's a pretty ass kicking song.

483
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:24,440
When we think about kicking some ass, it inspires us to do the FUs of the Week.

484
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,360
Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off with tonight's FUs of the Week.

485
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:39,720
My FU of the Week goes towards, yeah, it's actually going to go to work, just in general.

486
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,500
I actually went and got my business license on Wednesday so that I can hopefully quit

487
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,400
my job and get to working at a spa, that'd be so nice.

488
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,680
And so it really, really just sort of made me realize how much more futile what I do

489
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,680
is.

490
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,680
So, FU to work.

491
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,680
Loki.

492
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:05,240
I'm FU'd the Bad Drivers, I was commuting back from Oakland today, and there are just

493
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:11,720
some people out there that don't really follow any of the laws of the road, in fact just

494
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,720
weave in and out.

495
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,320
I watched a truck almost flip itself because it turned so tight, you know, trying to go

496
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,960
between cars and stuff like that, so you know, there's just some people and there's a guy

497
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,720
with some riced up car or something that just decided, oh I'm going to just cut through

498
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:36,280
cars and stuff, no signal, no nothing, just trying to kill people, so fuck them.

499
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:43,040
I'm going to give an FU, sorry, one more thing, FU to the California Highway Patrol for stopping

500
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,800
the freeway, you morons!

501
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,120
So you know, they do all these things to stop people from speeding, so one of those things

502
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:56,360
apparently is to stop traffic on the freeway completely, all lanes at one time, because

503
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,280
that solves the problem.

504
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,820
No it doesn't, it causes more traffic, people become late and they speed more, you stupid

505
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,820
dumb fucks.

506
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,820
That's it.

507
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,640
That does seem like a little silly idea, unless there's an axe in the head or something.

508
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,640
No, they just.

509
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,640
For no reason?

510
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,640
No reason.

511
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,640
Just have fun.

512
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,640
We're bored today, let's screw with traffic.

513
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:23,240
My FU of the week goes to my ass, hear me out here for a minute, because I was a little

514
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:29,080
bit intoxicated, and I slipped and I fell on this chest that's in my room, this little

515
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,920
green, not a treasure chest, but a chest for clothes and stuff, I slipped and I fell right

516
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:38,600
on the corner of that, so my butt hit that corner, and now it's red and practically bruised.

517
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,600
I saw Rob's butt.

518
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,280
Yeah, I showed it to Jamie earlier, but only because I'm gay and she's a married woman,

519
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,280
so it's okay.

520
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,720
I gave Rob drugs.

521
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,840
Yeah, and she evaluated it and gave me some ibuprofen that was very strong.

522
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,840
Do you feel better?

523
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
I do, actually.

524
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,840
I don't feel it at all.

525
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,560
It's nice.

526
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,960
That's it for the FUs of the week, hooray.

527
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,040
Let's go back to some gaming news, and this is almost FU of the week worthy.

528
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:13,480
I found this on Digg, there's a site, EbizMBA, that tracks the top 25 gaming sites on the

529
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,360
internet, and Orange Launch Radio is nowhere to be found.

530
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,960
Well, of course.

531
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,960
That's just bullshit.

532
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,360
Okay, when was the last time we actually had news on our website?

533
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,960
Which by the way, oh, actually it was about that interview, we were supposed to have an

534
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:31,280
interview tonight, DMN did the interview, it was with a gal from Nintendo who got fired

535
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,760
over her blog, DMN actually interviewed her for their own show, STFU, which is on Thursdays

536
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,200
on the station, we were going to rebroadcast it because it's kind of an in the news current

537
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,160
thing that we thought you guys would be interested in.

538
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:46,520
Apparently their connection sucked, and the audio quality wasn't worth it to try and bring

539
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,520
it to you guys.

540
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,560
So we made an editorial decision to cut it out.

541
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,240
What about the guy that proposed over...

542
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,760
I didn't hear a fact from him on Myspace, I don't know, maybe he's listening.

543
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,640
We'll still have him on the show, call in.

544
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,520
Maybe if he's listening right now, we're going to have the Skype line later on the show,

545
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,480
we'll get to that, or anybody who wants to call in.

546
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,600
I think some of our New Yorkers that went to Digital Life are dying to get through tonight,

547
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,360
so we're going to hear from them a little later, but the 25 most popular video game

548
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,360
sites.

549
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,440
The number one video game site, according to this roster, which judges the top 25 by

550
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,960
the number of inbound links, the number of monthly visitors, the Quantcast monthly visitors,

551
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,800
I don't even know what that is, and the Alexa ranking, which by the way I think is bullshit.

552
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,480
I think you should not use, oh god, I fucking hate Alexa.

553
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,080
It's like one of the biggest plagues on the internet.

554
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,360
Who owns it, like Amazon or some shit?

555
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,520
All it is is a spyware bar that you basically have to install on your computer and it tracks

556
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,080
what websites you visit.

557
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,120
And they have the balls to release this ranking of the top sites based on who has this Alexa

558
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,120
toolbar installed.

559
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:55,040
That's not, because if you are anti-spyware, anti-toolbar, all this stuff, you probably

560
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,160
visit different sites than people who get suckered to putting this stuff on their computer.

561
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,280
Anyway, I could just go off all day, because one of the things I hate about Wikipedia is

562
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:09,440
that they use the Alexa ranking as some of their, as a site worthy to be on our page,

563
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,600
which how we've managed to keep our article up on Wikipedia for so long, I'll never be

564
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,200
able to figure that out.

565
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,960
But thank you all to the listeners who made that, but anyway, sorry, I get off my soapbox

566
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,960
there.

567
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,400
Top 25 sites, number one video game site, IGN.com, followed by GameSpot.com at number

568
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:32,280
two, GameFacts.com at number three, GamesRadar.com at number four, which kind of surprised me,

569
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:39,200
I'd never really heard of it until a few months ago, UGO.com at number five, GameSpy, CheatCC,

570
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,000
Kotaku, Yahoo Video Games, and GameTap rounding out the top 10.

571
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,920
File Front is a gaming site.

572
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,400
Apparently File Front is a gaming site, number 11.

573
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,960
File Planet?

574
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:57,200
Yeah, so some other big blogs, OneUp, who does a bunch of podcasts, they're number 13

575
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:04,760
on the list, Destructoid is number 20, Joystiq is number 19, and that's all I care to mention.

576
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,960
We're getting beat out by Strategy Informer.

577
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,840
Well, you know, life sucks sometimes.

578
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,600
Yeah, we don't have the budget.

579
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,240
I bet you all these people, none of these are, of course, independent sites, well maybe

580
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,640
Kotaku, I guess, and Joystiq, and Destructoid.

581
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,760
Well, yeah, I don't want to get into the politics of it all, yeah.

582
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,760
Yeah.

583
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
Anywho.

584
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,520
Yeah, some of the chat is asking, where's AllGames?

585
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,360
Nope, AllGames didn't make the top 25 either.

586
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,280
But AllGames doesn't really do news, you know, AllGames only shows.

587
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,240
I think if there were more to it, there might be more people going there.

588
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,320
Maybe someday.

589
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:47,240
I trust that we're at the top of our favorite sites.

590
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,240
And that's all I really care about.

591
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,800
That's all right, we're just underground, yo.

592
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,160
We're just underground.

593
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,800
We're way under the radar.

594
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,600
We're like underground at a bomb shelter.

595
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,600
That's right.

596
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,600
I'm not in a bomb shelter.

597
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,880
I'm in the land of awesome.

598
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,400
Anyway, speaking of something that could be awesome, but I sincerely doubt it, is that

599
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,440
there is a rumor about a Mortal Kombat game that will feature characters from the DC universe

600
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,720
trying to do a versus type of thing.

601
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,880
But yeah, I don't know how I feel about that.

602
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,800
In fact, I feel that it's going to be kind of dumb.

603
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
What is that?

604
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,120
A ramp I see there and a tank with sharks.

605
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,760
What's going to happen soon?

606
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,760
I wonder.

607
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:40,320
If they were going to do something awesome like Marvel vs. Capcom vs. DC Play-A-Rama.

608
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,200
Isn't that kind of what this is?

609
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,280
It's the answer to Marvel vs. Capcom, which is Street Fighter.

610
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,320
So instead of Marvel vs. Street Fighter, now you have DC vs. Mortal Kombat.

611
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,360
This makes perfect sense to me.

612
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,000
In fact, this reeks the fanboyism to me.

613
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I don't even think it's true.

614
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,600
The difference between Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter is that Street Fighter is a good game.

615
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,960
First off, the next game that they're going to do is going to be a versus game.

616
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,520
They never said it was versus DC.

617
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,520
Although that would make sense.

618
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,080
To be honest, I think the Mortal Kombat series, DC, I don't think would go for it if you think

619
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,080
about it.

620
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,960
I mean, granted, I think DC vs. Street Fighter makes sense because it's more like comic book-y

621
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,960
and stuff.

622
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,200
But, Mortal Kombat is just kind of violent.

623
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,200
Well maybe they're going to change Mortal Kombat's adventure.

624
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:31,080
Mortal Kombat vs. Monsters of Horror or something like that, where they have Freddy and Jason

625
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,080
and shit like that.

626
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,280
You know why I like the Mortal Kombat games, especially the more recent one?

627
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,720
I like them because they have more than just the fighting game stuff in them.

628
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,560
Like the kart thing, the adventure modes.

629
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,120
The games have quite a bit of depth.

630
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,120
I don't know.

631
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,320
I mean, they're not like OMG drop everything.

632
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,280
They're no Soul Calibur 2, that's for sure.

633
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
But they're fun.

634
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,280
I don't know.

635
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,400
I think you guys are beating too hard on Mortal Kombat.

636
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,400
It's fun.

637
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,720
You guys are just tough to please.

638
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,520
I am tough to please.

639
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,040
Anyways, one game though that I do like is Saints Row.

640
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,960
And Saints Row 2 has been confirmed for PlayStation 3 and the 360.

641
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,160
Some of the changes coming with the brand new version of the game, of course it's going

642
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:19,960
to bring back Stillwater as well as including some improvements to the online game.

643
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:27,760
Both the online co-op now being added and multiplayer open world multiplayer matches.

644
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,760
That's kind of cool.

645
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:33,840
I mean, don't get me wrong, the multiplayer is okay, but I kind of wish that it was open

646
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,440
world like Grand Theft Auto on the PSP and stuff like that.

647
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:47,400
After a while, those three maps that you have for death match really get old.

648
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
It should be good.

649
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:54,240
You know what though, they set the bar pretty high for Grand Theft Auto so it would be kind

650
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:00,200
of cool to see them look at what Grand Theft Auto 4 did well and then improve on that.

651
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,200
Competition is always good.

652
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,200
It makes for better games.

653
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,920
Alright, well you could say one thing that's competing with DDR, although not really, is

654
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,000
Dance Online.

655
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,360
Dance Online is that dancing MMO that was created by David Perry who also made Earthworm

656
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,920
Jim and I think I played it a long time ago and I wasn't that impressed with it.

657
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,180
It didn't have a lot of songs that really grabbed me, but now I've got to go back and

658
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:26,840
take a look because Dance Online has gotten some updates and they have apparently made

659
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,200
some type of agreement with Warner Brothers Records or Warner Music.

660
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,180
There are now songs from Ashley Tisdale, The Ramones, The Click Five, 30 songs from Warner

661
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:41,000
Music also in the game now, Paris Hilton.

662
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You know you want to...

663
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
What?

664
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
No, I don't.

665
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Oh, no.

666
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,200
No, you want to also add more items to the shop for more customization.

667
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:56,780
Over 150 hairstyles and apparently the game has also added fresh dance mode to give fresh

668
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:01,680
dance modes giving some new challenges to the dancers in the game.

669
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,880
There's a new superstar mode where you try to rack up combos and break dance and then

670
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,320
reverse notes.

671
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,760
You have to hit the opposite keyboard or dance pad arrows that you normally would.

672
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,240
A little silly.

673
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,240
Yawn.

674
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,240
I don't know.

675
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,240
I'll check it out.

676
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,240
I'll check it out.

677
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,000
I think with some good music it could be fun.

678
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I don't know.

679
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Some folks in chat...

680
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,240
Dark Tetsuya says, Pass.

681
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,040
Mr. DeBucket says, David Perry for the lose.

682
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,040
Ouch.

683
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,440
Shadow Charlie says, Play Supernova 2 for Ashley Tisdale.

684
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,360
You know a sad time or a sad sign that things are changing.

685
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,880
You know how like our show started off like, you know, because we met all playing DDR.

686
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,440
We were all about the DDR.

687
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,720
Did you notice that not one but two new DDR games this week or DDR games came out this

688
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,240
week and did either of us bother to report on them at the top of the show in our gaming

689
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,240
weeks?

690
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,240
No.

691
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,240
We talked about it last week.

692
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,240
Yeah, but did you play them?

693
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,240
No, I didn't.

694
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,240
I'm just like, did you play them?

695
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,240
I'm waiting for my free coffees.

696
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,240
I mean, come on.

697
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,240
Oh, never mind.

698
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,240
Sorry.

699
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,240
A lot's changed in five years.

700
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:05,200
I mean, I just don't want to buy, well first off I'm not buying DDR Haas Party unless I

701
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,800
get it, you know, for free.

702
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,680
And then Supernova 2, I listened to the music.

703
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,240
I was disappointed with the Trip Machine remix.

704
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,440
It was crap, so.

705
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,360
And then, Ashley, is that your official review?

706
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,800
I did like the Fascination Max remix though.

707
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,880
That reminded me a lot of like Healing Vision and then Healing Vision Angelic, that kind

708
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,600
of remix of it.

709
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:37,920
And then, some of the songs though they didn't have ripped from it though, like Volcano I

710
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,600
didn't get to hear, but some of the other ones were okay.

711
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,800
I think though, I'll have to try it.

712
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,480
I want an actual machine to be out here though instead of having to play it on the Playstation

713
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,880
2.

714
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,000
But hopefully I'll get to play it soon.

715
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,640
Alright, well one thing we're going to get to do very soon is open up the mailbag.

716
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,320
That's right, you guys email us every week at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and we

717
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,640
read some of our favorites here on the program.

718
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:09,360
So DarkSakura, jump in the mailbag, pull out some letters, let's see what we got.

719
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:17,200
First email, dun dun dun, comes from, well, you didn't give a nickname so I'm just going

720
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,200
to say Erin.

721
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,200
Hi, first of all, I want to say I love the show.

722
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,320
It's the only podcast I listen to that doesn't ever bore me.

723
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,400
It's funny, entertaining, and informative.

724
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,480
As for Rob's comments about Facebook, I totally agree.

725
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,520
It's so annoying to log in and have like five invitations for apps that you don't care about.

726
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,760
I don't think that it's as bad as MySpace, but I do think Facebook is headed in that

727
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,760
direction.

728
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,600
I got a Facebook too and I hate it.

729
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:47,960
I mean, I do kind of like getting the notifications on my phone sometimes, but that shit gets

730
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
old.

731
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,120
Anyway, to continue, I also have a few comments on Halo 3.

732
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,680
I love the first game, it's the reason I bought an Xbox.

733
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,160
I was disappointed in Halo 2 and not long after Halo 2, I stopped telling people that

734
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:08,080
I played it because I didn't want them to think I was a stupid frat boy.

735
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,280
I eventually stopped playing Halo 2 with anyone I didn't know because of the ignorant people

736
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,880
on Xbox Live.

737
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,960
I'm excited for Halo 3, but I won't be going to the midnight release because of the people

738
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,640
that will be there.

739
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,760
I think the Halo series started out well and the games are still solid, but the atmosphere

740
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,080
surrounding the games has dissolved into one blatant commercialism and poor sportsmanship,

741
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,080
for lack of a better word.

742
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,080
Love this show, guys.

743
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,080
Keep it up.

744
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,080
Aaron?

745
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:36,240
Yeah, I seem to remember we were talking about last week, you know, who's actually going

746
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,000
to the midnight release.

747
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,880
Do we hear from anyone who actually went?

748
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,360
This guy said he wanted to go, but all right.

749
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:48,720
Shall I move forward to the next one, Rob?

750
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,720
You may.

751
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:56,000
Hello, dudes and chicks, I'm playing Worms 2 Up in Warfare on my PSP 2000, and I'm naming

752
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,720
the worms on my custom team.

753
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,440
I tried to name one of my worms Star Drifter, but when the worm shows up in the game, his

754
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:07,000
name appears as S-X-X-X-X-Ifter.

755
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,400
No matter how many times I try to rename him or a new team with the worm Star Drifter,

756
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,480
it automatically changes to S-X-X-X-X-Ifter.

757
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,640
Any idea why this is?

758
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,160
Yeah, because T-A-R-D is T.A.R.D.

759
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,040
Yeah, T.A.R.D. is slang for retard, which is a naughty word.

760
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,880
They also censored death because I had a team death something.

761
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,120
Can you play this online?

762
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,120
No.

763
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,120
You play Wi-Fi.

764
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,360
Well, then why bother censoring it?

765
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,840
The person's got to be in the room with you.

766
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,040
I don't get it.

767
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,040
That's overdoing it.

768
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,040
That's from Darkraven.

769
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,040
That's overdoing it.

770
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,240
No, it's being censored because I guess T.A.R.D. is a bad word, and so anything with that

771
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,260
in it, you know.

772
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,160
What if you wanted to name your character Compass?

773
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,440
Compass has the word ass in it, so you know, you can't do that.

774
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,440
It's messed up.

775
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,640
It would be comp, compa, and maybe com is a bad word too.

776
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
Who knows?

777
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,640
Calm.

778
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,640
It depends on how it's spelled.

779
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,640
Calm.

780
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,640
Anyway, this one comes from A.Z.H.P.

781
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,640
Hey, O.L.R.

782
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,640
Crew.

783
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,140
Last week on your show you discussed Loki's bet that he would dress up as Tingle while

784
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:15,260
burning the Eye of Judgment, and since it comes out on October 23rd, six months from

785
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:19,120
then, that would be April 23rd, which is my birthday.

786
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:23,560
I just wanted to say how great a birthday present it would be if it ended up happening.

787
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,840
Looking forward to the Eye of Judgment hitting the one million mark.

788
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,240
Unfortunately, I won't be contributing to that one million because I don't have a PS3

789
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,240
in it.

790
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,240
Oh yeah, the Eye of Judgment is crap.

791
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:36,840
Oh yeah, since you guys love lolcat so much, here's the Geometry Wars galaxy ad for the

792
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,840
Wii.

793
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:47,440
Yeah, but that was actually linked from the GW Cats thing that you gave me that was going

794
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,440
to be my side of the week.

795
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,880
Well, let's take a minute to talk about Galaxy Wars Cats.

796
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,840
Genius marketing campaign, those folks at Geometry Wars Galaxy.

797
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,520
Have you seen the site gwgcats.com?

798
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,380
Somebody's taken the lolcats trend and made an advertising campaign out of it.

799
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:11,920
I think the advertising campaign for Geometry Wars Galaxies is brilliant because you can

800
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,920
even watch the commercial.

801
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,920
Wait, hold on.

802
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,920
I'm going to go to the site.

803
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,920
I'm sorry.

804
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,760
I don't care if I sound like a consumer whore, but you know what?

805
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,800
I've seen so many lame video game commercials, and you might think this is lame, but I don't

806
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,800
care.

807
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,800
I think it's funny.

808
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,280
They have this in theaters.

809
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,280
This is so great.

810
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,160
There's Geometry Wars and they have all these things like, I'm in your solar system on top

811
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,720
of your leaderboards, I'm in your battle grids, topping your highest score, and just all this

812
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,720
funny stuff.

813
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,280
And then if you actually go to the website for Geometry Wars Galaxies, the little trailer

814
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,920
for the game has a remake of Particle Man, which is so awesome.

815
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,920
Hold on.

816
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,760
I got to play a little clip of the song from the trailer.

817
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,520
This is from Geometry Wars Galaxies dot com slash us.

818
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,720
Particle Man, Particle Man, doing the things of Particle Man.

819
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
What's he like?

820
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,720
It's not important.

821
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,720
Particle Man, is he a dot?

822
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,720
Or is he his back?

823
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,720
When he's in the water, does he get wet?

824
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:08,360
Or does the water get him instead?

825
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,360
Because get it?

826
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,240
Because it's like Triangle Man and, I don't know, it's funny.

827
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,240
That's great.

828
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,240
Is that They Might Be Giants?

829
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,240
No.

830
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,640
It's like, oh, unless they redid the song, it's definitely not the original.

831
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,680
Well, I mean, I was going to say, because the voice was kind of...

832
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,680
A little bit.

833
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,680
Could have been.

834
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,680
Yeah.

835
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,680
Great.

836
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,680
Love it.

837
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,520
Well, then the next email then, if you are ready.

838
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,880
Actually, real quickly, I just want to say, Black Wolf, of course, our old buddy Bobby

839
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,360
B's in chat right now, and he does his own show, of course, on All Games.

840
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,040
It also airs on Sunday nights, and sometimes when he's done with his show, he'll come listen

841
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,480
to ours for a little bit, because he's awesome, and he says, oh, man, that email was a mass

842
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,680
email to a lot of podcasts.

843
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,740
I think he said that about the last email, the one about the Worms 2.

844
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:55,360
So somebody is like mass emailing podcasts with the same question.

845
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,540
Amazing.

846
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,540
We got spammed.

847
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:02,000
I wonder if they're trying to see if the different podcasts give different answers of some type

848
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
of survey.

849
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,400
Well, then, I wonder if they're spamming all the podcasts about whether their penis needs

850
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,920
to be larger, too, because...

851
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,320
Or maybe they're trying to spam all the podcasts with a Worms 2 email, so people will actually

852
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,800
talk about Worms 2 on the podcast.

853
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,040
There's apparently people who think that...

854
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,040
We just bought it.

855
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,040
Hook, line, and sinker.

856
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,800
There's a bunch of people who think that I need a bigger penis, too, apparently, in my

857
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,800
email.

858
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,440
So we actually deleted my email address.

859
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,320
So I don't think it'll work, but good luck.

860
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,320
You never know.

861
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:34,640
Well, if they get them back, then they have auto-delete things or some shit.

862
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,800
I'm actually thinking about changing it anyway.

863
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,800
Yeah.

864
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,800
All right.

865
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
But anyway, next email now, please, please, please, please.

866
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,800
Yes, yes, yes.

867
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,800
Can I has email, Rob?

868
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,920
Yes, you can has email.

869
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,560
Last episode, look, you said nothing is original anymore.

870
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,560
Originality is hard to find.

871
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,960
One of my favorite quotes is from one of my design teachers is, you are only as original

872
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,400
as your sources are obscure.

873
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,600
Ones are the same as design.

874
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,080
I do agree with that.

875
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,820
I was listening to episode nine of Game Theory about emotional responses to video games and

876
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:08,520
how the design aspect can begin there to create a better game, and it reminded me of my own

877
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,560
reactions to certain games or events in games.

878
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,840
Like, the first time I played through Symphony of the Night, I beat Belmont at the end, and

879
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,960
I thought, cool, whatever.

880
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,080
I had no idea about the extra gameplay.

881
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,640
I was bored a few weeks later, so I had to play through it again, but thoroughly this

882
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,640
time.

883
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,720
So when I defeated the green orb this time, the exact words out of my mouth was, what

884
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,920
the crap?

885
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,440
Talk about a reward for good gaming or the end for Final Fantasy II in the U.S.

886
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,640
That's Final Fantasy IV overseas.

887
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,760
The page turning with the great music, it was incredible.

888
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,160
I sat and smiled contentedly for a good half an hour.

889
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:44,120
I can actually say the same thing about Final Fantasy III over here when it came out, was

890
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:48,880
that I actually finally decided to wait and be patient and wait for Shadow to catch up

891
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,680
with you so that he doesn't die, spoiler, and got the ending with everybody alive.

892
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,000
That made me happy.

893
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,660
Even retarded GoGo.

894
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,840
I was missing somebody when I first beat Final Fantasy III.

895
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,840
It wasn't Shadow.

896
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,880
I actually thought to wait around for Shadow.

897
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,960
I got everybody.

898
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,960
I want to say, I was missing, like somebody really, like Gao or somebody I was like really

899
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,960
weird I was missing.

900
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,720
Well no, you couldn't play through without Gao.

901
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,140
Then who was I missing?

902
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:19,560
Your extra characters were Umaru and GoGo.

903
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,560
The stupid mimic?

904
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,020
No, isn't there a way that you can actually get all the way to the very last tower with

905
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,200
only three people?

906
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,600
You have to have Celes, you have to have Edgar, and you have to have one other person.

907
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,600
I think Locke.

908
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,600
Terra.

909
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,600
Is it?

910
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,600
No, I think you can go and skip Terra.

911
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,200
I mean, it makes no sense for the story, but remember how you could access the last tower

912
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,200
really early on?

913
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,220
Terra was like the first character you play in the game.

914
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:48,320
But then after the game resets, when it goes into World of Ruin, you start as Celes, remember?

915
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,320
That is true.

916
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,320
So, it was weird.

917
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,440
Well, at any rate, now I look for these things.

918
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,680
I want to care about my characters on normal story-based games.

919
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,960
It's not always easy to find.

920
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,600
I get by these days with a good triple Winfury crit on any gnome anywhere, or seriously just

921
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:09,000
killing anything alliance, but that kind of quick fix can't replace the more in-depth

922
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,240
stuff.

923
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,840
What are some of the moments that got you guys all teary eyed or made you jump like

924
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,840
an idiot?

925
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,520
Oh, and let's hear it for the gamers, spelled G-A-Y-M-E-R-S.

926
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,440
Apparently Seattle is the gamer mecha.

927
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,440
Really?

928
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,040
And that comes from No Soul Boy.

929
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,240
I knew there was a reason I liked Seattle.

930
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:30,400
No, let's see, games that got me, well, okay, games that got me a jump would be Silent Hill,

931
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,900
like any of them.

932
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:38,520
Games that got me all teary- Well, I actually cared when Aris died in Final Fantasy VII

933
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,520
on one of my co-hosts.

934
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,520
I cheered.

935
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,520
You're a bitch.

936
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,520
I'm not a bitch.

937
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:48,000
I hated her the entire fucking game, and oh my God, I hated her, and I was so happy when

938
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
she died.

939
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I was sad.

940
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,240
Actually, I got verklempt when that happened.

941
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,560
Actually, I got a little verklempt playing Eternal Sonata the other day.

942
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,560
That game's sad.

943
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,780
It's about all these dying kids and stuff.

944
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,780
It's kind of sad.

945
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:05,840
I laughed my ass off during the bitch slap fight in Final Fantasy VII between Scarlet

946
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:13,440
and Tifa, and oh God, there was a game though that made me completely freaking ball, and

947
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,160
I couldn't remember what it was because it was a few years ago.

948
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,960
I do know one game that completely cracked me up, and that was- Now, crap, I can't remember

949
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:31,280
the name of it, but it had the girl with the red pigtails, and she used the rings, the

950
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,240
chakram for her weapons, and you could play as either the girl or the boy, and it had

951
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:41,720
a really cool name in Japan, and then it came out with Winds of Fate in the US, but that

952
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:47,440
game had lots of crack-me-up bunny moments because she was just over the top, but I can't

953
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,720
remember the game that made me freaking ball like a baby though.

954
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,400
It was like people dying in the game.

955
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,400
Mario is missing.

956
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,920
I just, I can't believe it's missing.

957
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,920
I'll tell you what recently though- I can't believe it, please, I can't find him.

958
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:09,840
I'll tell you what recently made me so annoyed was watching on YouTube, asshole Mario, just

959
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,320
people go to YouTube and look up asshole Mario.

960
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,240
That was awesome talent, I love asshole Mario.

961
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:21,280
It's people who what they did is took Super Mario Brothers and did ROM hacks with it to

962
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,660
make these intensely hard levels, and the thing about these hard levels is that they

963
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,800
are not unplayable.

964
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:34,940
You can beat them, but you have to have the mad skills to do it and time and patience

965
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,280
and be willing to die.

966
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:42,560
The only thing that's annoying about the asshole Mario levels is that they keep showing people

967
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:47,480
dying over and over and over again, and what they should do is just show someone playing

968
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,040
through the level and then show them dying.

969
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:55,280
My favorite was how they showed one at just the very start of the game, and the very first

970
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,840
level the guy goes into, he goes into the level and then there's a bullet machine that

971
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,840
shoots him in the face.

972
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,840
Right when the level starts.

973
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:05,320
Or the womps that land directly on him.

974
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:09,580
The very first level where it does the little happy music, it starts with a womp falling

975
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:13,720
on him, and you have to find the secret hidden block.

976
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:19,920
The best thing is, and I was actually discussing this with Sauce the other day, is that when

977
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,240
they have the uber long jumps and the guy's timing it perfectly, and then he jumps and

978
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,960
hits a brick and lands in the hole.

979
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,760
It's like an invisible coin block.

980
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,560
Anyway, back to the email, shall I?

981
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,560
Yes.

982
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,560
Okay.

983
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,900
This is addressed to me, and then you guys in parentheses.

984
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,360
This is Rob with two Bs, by the way.

985
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,360
Who's it from?

986
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,360
I just told you, Rob.

987
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,840
Oh, hi, Rob and two Bs.

988
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:49,440
There's a little war of words going on between a site called Game Twat, I think that's great,

989
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,720
it just gets funnier each time you think slash say it, and game politics, as well as GP versus

990
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:00,700
Jackie Poo, and it's being taken way too seriously by GP readers.

991
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:06,000
In a GT post on a GP survey involving a Jackie Poo interview, what's more, you'd think by

992
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,520
naming a site Game Twat would sort of imply people that it's not meant to be taken 100%

993
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,260
seriously, but I guess that sort of skips people by.

994
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:16,400
I've heard of Game Cock, but I've never heard of Game Twat.

995
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,540
Game Cock is a publisher, or a developer.

996
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:24,720
I think people need to lighten up and realize how we secretly enjoy the antics between Jackie

997
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,520
Poo and GP butting heads.

998
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,640
GT is funny if you let it.

999
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,200
I personally believe that porn court filing's story on Jackie Poo was his attempt to show

1000
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,660
the judge was biased against him in the case versus the Florida Bar.

1001
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:40,820
Mission accomplished, but now the legal system is against him.

1002
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:45,200
Sorry for the misquote, but if you strike Jackie Poo down, he'll become stronger than

1003
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,200
ever.

1004
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:51,040
I'd rather we adopt a meh attitude and maybe he'll start eating crayons as recreational

1005
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,040
drugs.

1006
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,040
Rob Bubba.

1007
00:47:53,040 --> 00:48:00,320
And he wrote Bubba afterwards.

1008
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:05,400
This Game Twat site looks like Perez Hilton.

1009
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:10,600
It's awfully pink, and that joystick looks like a cock.

1010
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:14,300
Black Wolf in chat says something interesting, he says, wow, Game Twat is getting really

1011
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,640
too much publicity over this.

1012
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,480
So what's the debate?

1013
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,000
What are they mad at each other about?

1014
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,640
I don't get it.

1015
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,640
Hold on, I'm trying to figure this out, because Game Twat interviewed him.

1016
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,800
I can't believe he would have interviewed with a site called Game Twat.

1017
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,720
What the hell?

1018
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,720
Hi, we're with Game Twat, we want to interview you.

1019
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,080
Whatever, I don't want to get involved in the drama.

1020
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,720
It's more publicity for both sites, I mean, we just reported on it, congratulations to

1021
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,900
both sites.

1022
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,000
We need to start a fight with somebody.

1023
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,160
Who can we start a fight with?

1024
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,160
How about all games?

1025
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,160
Ah, that's too obvious.

1026
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,160
How about Bobby?

1027
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,160
Bobby, we're going to start a fight with you, is that okay?

1028
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,160
That's too obvious.

1029
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,040
It's too obvious if we start a fight with somebody.

1030
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,280
I'll start a fight with you, you want to make some noise?

1031
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,480
What about the developer of The Eye of Judgment?

1032
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,480
I don't know.

1033
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,480
Who's the developer?

1034
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,480
Well, I don't know where we are.

1035
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,880
Chat, send us an email, let us know who we should get in a fight with.

1036
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,320
Yes, chat room, who should we start a fight with?

1037
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,920
We'll say something really nasty about some other show.

1038
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:15,920
PM Rob.

1039
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,920
Let us know who.

1040
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,920
PM Rob with your answers.

1041
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,920
Yes, please do.

1042
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:24,420
Okay, to report from the Afro guy, hey, OLR, I wanted to make a correction to that rather

1043
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,720
formal review of Earth Defense Forces sent in last week.

1044
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,520
There are more enemy types than just ants in the game, but it turns out they're the

1045
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,560
best.

1046
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,800
By the way, having played Metal Slug Anthology this week, I agree with Loki that every Metal

1047
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,960
Slug game is exactly the same, even if they are really fun.

1048
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,160
Enemies, weapons, and even goddamn mini-bosses are repeated.

1049
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,160
You know what?

1050
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:50,040
So you can get turned into undead in the later ones.

1051
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:54,240
To continue, last one, dun, dun, dun.

1052
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,600
Hi, OLR people, this is Mori again.

1053
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:02,280
Earlier this week, I was able to get a Wii with money from various sources, and so far

1054
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,120
I've been enjoying it immensely.

1055
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,960
My house has been lacking in a home version of DDR for quite some time, so I splurged

1056
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:13,000
and picked up the new DDR Hottest Party bundle that came out Tuesday, I think.

1057
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Anywho.

1058
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,720
The game's, in a nutshell, excellent.

1059
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,240
It's easily the best DDR home version in a while.

1060
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:24,160
The song list is a tad shorter than the average game, by about 50 total, but most of the songs

1061
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,360
are actually fun to play.

1062
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:29,600
About half of it consists of licenses, they're all covers, but the range and quality from

1063
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,280
good to questionable.

1064
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,520
For some reason, the 80s ones tend to be the most fun.

1065
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,900
Blue Monday by New Order is the first one that comes to mind.

1066
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,760
The original songs in the game are pretty awesome, too.

1067
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:45,280
Furthermore, whoever did the step charts for this game needs to stay around forever.

1068
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,760
There's a wide range of difficulty.

1069
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,400
A couple of genuine ten-footers in the other charts are fun without being mind-numbingly

1070
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,400
boring.

1071
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,800
The Wii remote motions are kind of hard to get the hang of, though, and the game doesn't

1072
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,280
give you any advice besides swinging the controller.

1073
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,520
As far as I can tell, the best way to do it is to hold the remote and nunchuck in front

1074
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,480
of you vertically and swing them forward.

1075
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,840
Oh, and the new Love Shine remix is rad.

1076
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,400
Finally, a quick question.

1077
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,120
What other Wii games are good at the moment?

1078
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,120
I'm into quirky stuff.

1079
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,120
Cheers, Mori.

1080
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:18,640
Um, I still love Trauma Center.

1081
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:23,560
If you really want quirky, escape from Bug Island.

1082
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,560
That's really quirky.

1083
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,880
Quirky games?

1084
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:31,140
Dip into the retro archive and go play some old stuff, because seriously, some developers

1085
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,720
back in the day were smoking crack.

1086
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,720
Who would have thought that a game about a loom would be so awesome?

1087
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,720
Loom is awesome.

1088
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,720
I know.

1089
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,720
That's what I'm saying.

1090
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,820
Loom is fucking rad.

1091
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:41,940
Go back in the archive.

1092
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:42,940
Play some old-school stuff.

1093
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:43,940
Seriously.

1094
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:44,940
Good times.

1095
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:45,940
Well, that's it for the email.

1096
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,800
Bobby Black Wolf in chat, boy, he's getting a lot of FaceTime tonight.

1097
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,800
See?

1098
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,480
Because of the fight.

1099
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:56,080
And he commented on our fight, the possible fight between OLR and Black Wolf.

1100
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:02,280
He says, we tried to fight, however, Loki refused to play ChromeHounds, so I won by

1101
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,280
default.

1102
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,680
Dude, it was like me and some other person.

1103
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,120
I think I'd already sold my copy back.

1104
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:13,040
Uh, GS68 says also that we should be fighting with Bobby Black Wolf, but see, that doesn't

1105
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,040
work.

1106
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,840
This suggests that we should have a fight with Tekken Games.

1107
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,040
You know, Raven's Dolphins show, because he always calls it this show and he has his own

1108
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,960
thing, the Tekken Games, which is like number three on Op 11 or something like that.

1109
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,880
It's just crazy.

1110
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,240
Which just proves people watch anything.

1111
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:33,320
See, I'm starting a little fight, starting a little fight.

1112
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,320
Just kidding, Raven, if you're listening.

1113
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,120
Hugs and kisses.

1114
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,120
Let's see.

1115
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:42,640
Oh, and then Black Wolf suggested that we fight one up.

1116
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,120
And I'm like, that fight.

1117
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,800
I would fight him with a cricket bat.

1118
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,320
That fight's so 2006.

1119
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,680
I'm over my issues with one up.

1120
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,680
I'm over my issues.

1121
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,680
Whatever.

1122
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:59,120
I guess so we can't fight anybody, so we have to love everybody.

1123
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,120
Hugs and kisses all around.

1124
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,760
We love everyone.

1125
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,560
The Nintendo Wii Online Development staff, how about that?

1126
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,560
Let's fight them.

1127
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,360
No, but we need a good fight.

1128
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,400
Like a really good bang up fight that people will report on.

1129
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:19,680
Because it's like, you know, O.L.R. threatened to kill somebody's family or something.

1130
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,680
Camp threatened to kill families.

1131
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,680
That's illegal.

1132
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,680
I know.

1133
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:23,680
It is illegal.

1134
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,680
Alright.

1135
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:29,520
We need to get some really good dirt on somebody and start a fight with them.

1136
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,520
It'd be good for publicity.

1137
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,520
Can you work on that, Loki?

1138
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,440
You have ties in dark places.

1139
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,960
Get some dirt on another cast.

1140
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,600
Alright, anyway.

1141
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:43,120
Yeah, don't you know, I'm just like the fucking sleuth.

1142
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,560
Alright, then get some news.

1143
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,560
God.

1144
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:52,600
Anyways, so, you know, when I'm not digging up dirt, apparently, we're going to be talking

1145
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,160
about Square Enix.

1146
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,280
And they're focusing on overseas.

1147
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:00,480
Yeah, that's a surprise.

1148
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,240
I guess, you know, of course, since they're only known, well, Square Enix is mainly known

1149
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,960
for the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest series.

1150
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,960
A lot of other stuff that they used to do, unfortunately.

1151
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,560
Never saw remixes.

1152
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,400
I really want Einhänder.

1153
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:20,920
But now, apparently, they're going to be focusing on overseas markets that have increased more

1154
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,360
than to three times the size of the Japanese market.

1155
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,360
Thank God.

1156
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:30,360
Maybe that means we'll actually get Final Fantasy XIII in a timely manner.

1157
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:35,680
Instead of having to wait for Japan to get it and then us getting it way afterwards.

1158
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:40,640
So they had, apparently, two strategies planned to seize the opportunities.

1159
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:48,240
First, they're, of course, going to increase their distribution channel ties throughout,

1160
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,760
you know, both the United States and, I believe, in Europe.

1161
00:54:51,760 --> 00:55:00,800
And of course, the second is, you know, developing more titles overall.

1162
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,920
So it's pretty cool.

1163
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,420
Alright, well, we here at the Orange Lounge.

1164
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:09,960
You think we'd be really excited about the Orange Box, but I know there's a lot of our

1165
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,960
listeners who are excited about the Orange Box.

1166
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,960
I am excited about the Orange Box.

1167
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,980
It's not games I usually play.

1168
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:16,360
Maybe I should be more excited about it.

1169
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,360
Portal!

1170
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,360
Come on.

1171
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:21,200
Alright, well, the Orange Box has officially gone gold.

1172
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,200
And it's coming out.

1173
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,840
You know, the only thing that I wish this would have in it is Gary's mod.

1174
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:33,200
$59.99 on the 360, $49.99 on the PC, Half-Life 2, 1 and 2, Team Fortress 2, and, as Loki

1175
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,480
said, Portal, all in the Orange Box.

1176
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,840
Well maybe this is the perfect opportunity for me to check it out, because I, you know,

1177
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:44,360
haven't really played Half-Life a whole lot, I mean a little bit, but, you know, I don't

1178
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,720
play a lot of these first person shooters and stuff, so.

1179
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,620
If you're going to buy it, Loki, then I'll check it out when you get it.

1180
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:54,600
But it's gone gold, so those of you guys that are excited about it, I know there's a couple

1181
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,640
of people on my Twitter that are really excited about the Orange Box.

1182
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,780
It's on its way very soon.

1183
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:02,120
So take a look for it.

1184
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:07,040
Well, I can't say that I'm too excited about this bit of news, because honestly I don't

1185
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,400
give a crap about it.

1186
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:14,840
But some people are happy about it, so for anyone who's interested in the Sam & Max series,

1187
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:21,900
season 2 will be on GameTap starting November 8th for those who have subscribed for it.

1188
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:27,280
And it has Ice Station Santa.

1189
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,580
For the person who emailed earlier about the quirky games, here you go, Sam & Max.

1190
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:34,240
I think this is a good little quirky game.

1191
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,240
Fun to play.

1192
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,240
Enjoy.

1193
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,240
You don't like Sam & Max?

1194
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,240
I never got into it.

1195
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,240
Oh, it's fun.

1196
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,240
It's cute.

1197
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,560
And funny.

1198
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:50,840
And I like how it's the only episodic game I can think of that actually stayed, like

1199
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,120
actually continued to put out episodes.

1200
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:57,660
Like most episodic games you hear about die after two episodes, you know what I mean?

1201
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:58,660
Shenmue.

1202
00:56:58,660 --> 00:56:59,660
What?

1203
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:04,160
Shenmue was supposed to be a series of, they're supposed to have a whole line of them giving

1204
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,480
episodes of What's-His-Face's Quest.

1205
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:13,080
But see somebody just, you know, it pooped and quit along the way, and this Sam & Max

1206
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,520
has been going for a long time.

1207
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,760
So hooray to it being a good episodic game.

1208
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:25,480
I did not drop my microphone.

1209
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,480
So.

1210
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:32,240
Alright, we're going to open the Skype line very soon if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR

1211
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:37,680
or our username on Skype, Orangelaunchradio, but one more story before we get to that.

1212
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:43,560
Yes, anyways, so it's a little bit disappointing because this was one of the big features of

1213
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:51,680
Unreal Tournament 3 for PlayStation 3, but no cross-platform play.

1214
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,240
It was apparently too hard to make, so they scrapped it.

1215
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:59,280
So you'll only be able to play people on the PC if you have the PC version, and only be

1216
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:05,360
able to play people on the PlayStation 3 if you have the PlayStation 3 version.

1217
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,600
So sad.

1218
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,520
So people on PCs cannot play people on PlayStation 3s.

1219
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,520
That's correct.

1220
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,720
And it's kind of sad.

1221
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,720
That's a bummer.

1222
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,980
Alright, well we are going to open up the Skype line over at Orangelaunchradio.com.

1223
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:23,340
Our username, of course, is Orangelaunchradio on Skype, or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1224
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:27,040
Let's open up the Skype line and see who can get on through.

1225
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,440
Hello, you're on Orangelaunchradio.

1226
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,440
Who's this?

1227
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,240
It's the one and only Legend of Zaku.

1228
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,760
Hello, Legend of Zaku.

1229
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,360
What's on your mind, my friend?

1230
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:41,600
Just dealing with the aftermath of digital life this weekend, especially the tourney.

1231
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:45,700
I was hoping some of the New Yorkers would call in and tell us all about digital life.

1232
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:48,300
I didn't get a chance to go.

1233
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,600
As you know, I wanted to go and I didn't get to go.

1234
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:55,400
Somebody on my Twitter said, not that I should be thankful I didn't go, but that it wasn't

1235
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,400
that good to show.

1236
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,400
You should be glad that you didn't go.

1237
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,400
Ooh, snap.

1238
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,680
Let's just say a lot of drama is... Oh shit, what happened?

1239
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,280
What happened, Zaku?

1240
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,120
Okay, I just want to make this a short story.

1241
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:12,320
I don't want to get people entangled in the current affairs of our community.

1242
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,320
Wait, hold on.

1243
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,320
Hold on.

1244
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,320
Hold on, Zaku.

1245
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,320
Wait, hold on.

1246
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,080
Remember we were talking about that fight earlier?

1247
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,080
Here we go.

1248
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,680
We have to start a fight right here.

1249
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,680
Okay.

1250
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:22,680
All right.

1251
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:27,720
To sum it up, basically the biggest complaints right now were regarding freestyle and the

1252
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:31,040
way the rest of the other tournaments were run.

1253
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:36,900
Basically the... All right, for starters, the way freestyle turned out, in other words,

1254
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:44,720
people accusing the judges of favoritism and people pissing and moaning on why certain

1255
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:52,120
of their favorite freestylers didn't place at all and there was a lot of name calling.

1256
00:59:52,120 --> 01:00:01,640
A lot of... It even got to the point where one of the players from Expert Tech actually

1257
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:08,760
cursed out one of the organizers right there and he got de-cued but then ended up staying

1258
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:12,800
after apologizing.

1259
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,800
Never mind, it's Dance Dance Revolution drama.

1260
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:15,800
Nobody's going to care about that.

1261
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:16,800
No, no, no.

1262
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:17,800
We have to start a fight somewhere else.

1263
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:18,800
What?

1264
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,280
I can email Jackie Poo for you.

1265
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,280
That's all right.

1266
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:28,120
That same guy, mind you, he also cursed out one of the other organizers who also freestyled

1267
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:31,320
there on Saturday and who I happen to know personally.

1268
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:36,920
He just basically... Yeah, he called him out for racism for his body appearance.

1269
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:37,920
Oh, boy.

1270
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,880
It was just really nasty.

1271
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,920
It was shit-load of like...

1272
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:47,720
So, somebody was cursing out some other guy at Digital Life throwing race and all this

1273
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,520
other stuff into it and they didn't get ejected?

1274
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,520
Yeah, race factor.

1275
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,520
They didn't get ejected?

1276
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:57,880
His appearance because he's a big guy, it's just a lot of immature bullshit that's just

1277
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,560
spanning four pages on the freak right now.

1278
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,840
I don't want to get into it because it's...

1279
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:03,840
Okay, so fine.

1280
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,960
Go to DDR Freak for your DDR drama.

1281
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,920
However, did this ruin Digital Life single-handedly to one little fight ruin the show?

1282
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:10,920
How did that go down?

1283
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:15,960
Well, it turned out pretty good and there was a lot of people that really complimented

1284
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:21,320
and really praised the organizers for running it.

1285
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:27,800
The pad misses were another issue that certain people had sour grapes over.

1286
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:35,480
The way it was set up was that the machines were on the stage and since the stage itself

1287
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:41,760
is not as secure as something like the ground, they have no choice but to put it up there.

1288
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,920
They have no saying in where the machines are actually placed.

1289
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:59,800
Zaku, if I didn't know better, I think Digital Life is one giant DDR machine.

1290
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,160
No, it's not even that.

1291
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,240
It's just... Let's just put it this way.

1292
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:09,920
Pad misses were just caused by the instability of the stage, just having all the machines

1293
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:16,800
and people up there and the sensors just going off like that.

1294
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:21,640
That was one of the biggest complaints by certain people.

1295
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:26,240
They agreed with the judgment calls because there were many... The people running and

1296
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:32,720
taking down the scores were very, very meticulous in making sure that whatever score was received

1297
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:39,360
was the fairest and most accurate score out there received.

1298
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:44,000
Tell me one thing in Digital Life that was cool that has nothing to do with DDR.

1299
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Guitar Hero 3.

1300
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,020
It's all right though, but I mean... Music game.

1301
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,020
It's fine.

1302
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:52,040
He was within the confines of the question.

1303
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,040
That's fine.

1304
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,040
All right.

1305
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,040
Guitar Hero 3, how was it?

1306
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,040
It was all right.

1307
01:02:56,040 --> 01:03:00,280
I only played it once, but so far it's just nice graphics.

1308
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,280
That's all.

1309
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,280
Same gameplay.

1310
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,280
New songs.

1311
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,280
Same gameplay.

1312
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:10,440
Yeah, but I just can't get my mind off of the 800-pound gorilla in the room, which is

1313
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:14,480
the DDR tournament that's still lingering right now.

1314
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,480
I'm sorry.

1315
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:22,840
I just hope next year we just fix what we had that went wrong this time.

1316
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,720
I can't take the DDR talk anymore.

1317
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,720
I'm sorry.

1318
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,400
I had to hit the red button to end it.

1319
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,080
I can't deal with the DDR drama anymore.

1320
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:33,480
I'm sorry, guys.

1321
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:38,560
If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username OrangeLoungeRadio.

1322
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,560
Hi.

1323
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,560
You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

1324
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,560
Who's this?

1325
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:42,560
It's GS68.

1326
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:43,560
Hi, GS68.

1327
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:46,320
What DDR drama would you like to report on tonight?

1328
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:49,000
Actually, not really DDR drama.

1329
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,600
I just want to say drama in general sucks ass.

1330
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,960
Yeah, drama in general is kind of crappy.

1331
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:00,680
Someone violated the card line thingy today when I was playing Maximum Tune 3.

1332
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:04,720
I so was about to hit the hang-up button because I thought you were going to say they violated

1333
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,920
the card thing on DDR, and I was like, God damn it, I'm cutting off the Skype calls.

1334
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,640
Okay, but it was Midnight Maximum Tune.

1335
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,640
I'm okay then.

1336
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,640
All right, so what happened?

1337
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:22,200
Well, I have a card up on the machine to show what was next, and this guy starts to look

1338
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:27,040
for coins so he can continue, and then I tell him that my turn is next, and then apparently

1339
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:32,520
it's not about the card roll, so I tell him about it, and then he still wants to continue,

1340
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:37,160
and then when he finally gets off, he calls me dumb and a faggot, et cetera.

1341
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:44,040
So what I did was I started a game and did one of the Metro courses.

1342
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,040
Can't we all just get along?

1343
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:49,840
I mean, seriously, people, you all are fighting each other over, and here's the thing.

1344
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:54,200
You're starting fights over Dance Dance Revolution.

1345
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,180
Can't anyone see the comedy in this?

1346
01:04:56,180 --> 01:05:02,920
And then now you're calling people a fag because they beat you to playing Midnight Maximum

1347
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:08,080
Tune, and this gives you the right to call other people gay?

1348
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:09,080
Come on.

1349
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:13,040
Because, you know, making it to a machine first is a really different sexuality.

1350
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:20,920
I know, his penis must be so large that I'd be like, you know, get it.

1351
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:25,000
How would you feel if someone hogged the machine when your turn was next?

1352
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,360
Anyway, drama sucks.

1353
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,360
Tell me something.

1354
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:29,860
I need to hear a happy story, GS68.

1355
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:30,880
Something good happened this week.

1356
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:31,880
Didn't it?

1357
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:32,880
Anything?

1358
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:33,880
Something?

1359
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:37,040
Well, seeing as new sites don't cover arcade games, I'll cover the arcade games myself,

1360
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,920
I finally got to play Initial D4.

1361
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,480
Oh, I didn't even know Initial D4 came out.

1362
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:42,480
How was that?

1363
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,720
Um, it was alright.

1364
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:47,840
I like the drifty physics because it felt more like drift racing.

1365
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:50,200
Is that something that's new over Initial D3?

1366
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:56,120
Yeah, Initial D3, there was some drifting, but you couldn't see it unless you were in

1367
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:02,320
third person view, which was useless because the camera wasn't right on your butt, so it's

1368
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:06,000
very hard to control your car.

1369
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,840
And does it still have all the fabulous Eurobeat in Initial D4?

1370
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:13,920
Yeah, but I heard you can't pick your own song, I just randomly choose for you.

1371
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,880
That's so that the same person doesn't play heartbeat over and over and over again because

1372
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,880
they don't know how to change the song.

1373
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:25,280
Well, not if you're in speed car over and over, like the song was, Speedcar, Speedcar,

1374
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:29,800
AEAT6, he's coming.

1375
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:33,600
Now suddenly we've turned into a singing karaoke show, no that's alright.

1376
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,600
This is the Eurobeat hour.

1377
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:39,120
Same, this is the strangest Skypline segment ever.

1378
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:44,720
Alright, GS60A, any quick last thoughts before we move on?

1379
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:45,720
Um, no.

1380
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:48,040
Alright, take care GS60A, have a good one.

1381
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,040
You too.

1382
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:52,560
And punch that kid in the face next time they try to call you names.

1383
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:58,000
Alright, not that I should be encouraging that, I'm just kidding.

1384
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
You can't win with violence.

1385
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,480
877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, give us a call, let's talk.

1386
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,720
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

1387
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:09,000
This is Brad from Pod Culture.

1388
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,400
Hello, Brad from Pod Culture, so good to hear from you, what's on your mind?

1389
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,560
Well, you said you wanted to hear from somebody who was crazy enough to be in a midnight launch

1390
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:17,560
of Halo 3.

1391
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:21,160
Oh, and let me guess, it was you, wasn't it?

1392
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,160
Oh yeah.

1393
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:26,440
Alright, so why, why did you have to be there at midnight to be, I mean, you couldn't wait

1394
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,440
until the next day?

1395
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,360
It's more of a social thing than anything else.

1396
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:31,360
I agree with that.

1397
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:35,120
He had to be there because someone cut in front of him, you know, for midnight maximum

1398
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:39,640
on Toon 3, and then, you know, the stage was unstable for DDR.

1399
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:44,960
Well, when I had pre-ordered my copy at Best Buy, they had said that they were going to

1400
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,440
be open until midnight.

1401
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,400
Ours here in Louisville weren't.

1402
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,400
Louisville?

1403
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,400
Louisville.

1404
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,400
Louisville, Kentucky.

1405
01:07:52,400 --> 01:08:00,240
Sorry, for a second I thought it was Louisville, it looks like Louisville, no, like Louisville.

1406
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:04,040
Only city can take a horse race and turn it into a three week party.

1407
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:11,320
You know what, my uncle used to live there for a little while, and that's exactly the

1408
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,920
same way he described it.

1409
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:17,240
Well, no, he lived there for a little while with some woman that he was seeing, and then

1410
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:24,040
he moved to, right outside Nashville, which is almost as bad.

1411
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:27,680
Alright, so you were in the line in Louisville, and

1412
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,080
Yeah, I actually went to three different lines, actually.

1413
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,560
Dang, so you had to go all around.

1414
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:40,040
Well, the Best Buy wasn't open, so our co-host, Glenn, had his pre-order at a GameStop over

1415
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,040
in Indiana.

1416
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:45,500
So we're, that's about 15, 20 minutes away, so I drove over there to meet him, and they

1417
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:51,120
didn't have any more of the collector's edition, so I drove over to meet a friend at another

1418
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:56,400
GameStop here in Louisville, they didn't have any, and wound up in line at Circuit City.

1419
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,400
Wow.

1420
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:02,080
Yeah, okay, Circuit City, not a lot of people seem to shop at Circuit City anymore, so that

1421
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,080
makes sense.

1422
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:05,920
There's only like 20 or 30 people in line.

1423
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:09,220
I remember when we went out, when the Nintendo Wii went on sale, we went around to all the

1424
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:12,440
different lines, which, by the way, yes, there is a difference between the Wii Midnight Launch

1425
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:15,800
and this, is that you knew everybody was going to have Halo 3 coming out the ass the next

1426
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:19,040
day, but when the Wii came out, you had to be in line at midnight, or you weren't getting

1427
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,040
the Wii.

1428
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,040
Big difference.

1429
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,160
I finally saw a Wii on the shelf the other day.

1430
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,040
There you go.

1431
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,040
Big difference.

1432
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:28,720
Anyway, yeah, yeah, there was like, what, four people at Circuit City?

1433
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:32,660
There was less than 20, 15, 20, 25 people, something like that.

1434
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:34,360
But so you got it?

1435
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:39,120
Yeah, I got it, and the guy ahead of me spent like 800 bucks.

1436
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,720
That's right, you sent us a private message earlier, so he went all out.

1437
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:44,680
Did he say why he was so crazy for Halo?

1438
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:49,080
Well, if he hadn't actually had his girlfriend with him, I would have thought he hadn't moved

1439
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,800
out of his parents' basement yet.

1440
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,360
He was pretty geeky.

1441
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:55,360
Maybe the girlfriend lives with him in the parents' basement.

1442
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,000
Well, that could be it, too.

1443
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:02,640
Some girlfriends will visit their boyfriends in their parents' basement, sometimes, and

1444
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,480
then they'll realize that he's kind of, you know, not desirable.

1445
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:07,480
But yeah, he...

1446
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:08,480
But he loves me.

1447
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,000
800 bucks for a game, that was crazy.

1448
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,320
He hits me because he does me.

1449
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:16,080
Well, you know, we are in Kentucky here.

1450
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:22,440
Hey, hey, I'm not from too much farther away from there, so...

1451
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:25,600
So yeah, it was actually a lot of fun hanging around talking to people.

1452
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:30,000
Now, you sent me a private message about some of the voice acting in Halo 3 that you discovered

1453
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
during the credits.

1454
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Yeah.

1455
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Some pretty popular sci-fi stars.

1456
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I know you love your sci-fi.

1457
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,760
Who can we find in Halo 3, in the voice acting?

1458
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:40,720
Nathan Fillion, Adam Baldwin, and Alan Tudyk from Firefly.

1459
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:41,720
Cool.

1460
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:42,720
Ooh, nice!

1461
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,520
And Katie Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica.

1462
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,720
She is awesome, and bionic woman now.

1463
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:47,720
Yep.

1464
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:51,160
Of which I missed on Wednesday, but I have a T-vote, I'm going to watch it a little later.

1465
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,880
She's freaking nuts on that show.

1466
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,960
I hear she's the reason to watch that show.

1467
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:55,960
Yeah.

1468
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,600
So I'm definitely going to want to check that out.

1469
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:03,320
Good times, but some, maybe not A-list actors, in the sci-fi world, they're definitely on

1470
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:07,840
the A-list, but some, you know, some pretty well-known actors there for the Halo 3.

1471
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,600
Every time I think of dude, I still cry over the end of Firefly.

1472
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,360
Let's not do spoilers.

1473
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:15,680
I'm not saying anything.

1474
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:16,680
All right.

1475
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,280
Oh, come on, the movie's been out two years.

1476
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,280
All right, that's fine.

1477
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:23,320
That was just a sucky way to die, okay?

1478
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,320
That sucked!

1479
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,760
I'm a leaf on the wind.

1480
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,600
No, you're a leaf pinned to a chair.

1481
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:29,600
Splat!

1482
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:30,600
Ouch.

1483
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:31,600
Oh, man.

1484
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:39,520
I wanted to hunt Joss down and burn my Joss Whedon is my Master Now shirt.

1485
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,520
All right, nerds.

1486
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,800
We've got to wrap up this call and take some more nerdy calls.

1487
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,760
I'm going to watch The Sarah Jean Adventures, I promise, since the new episodes are out.

1488
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:47,760
Excellent show.

1489
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:48,760
All right, catch you later, guys.

1490
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:49,760
Bye.

1491
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,760
All right, take care, Brad.

1492
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:51,880
Thanks for calling.

1493
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,000
Ask and ye shall receive.

1494
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
We asked to hear from crazies that were in the Halo 3 line, and we heard from one.

1495
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
That was great.

1496
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Let's go to the next call.

1497
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,240
Hello, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

1498
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,240
Who's this?

1499
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:03,520
Sarah Jean Adventures, I promise, since the new episodes are out.

1500
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:04,520
Hello?

1501
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,520
Can you hear us?

1502
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,520
Yeah, hello?

1503
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:07,520
Hi.

1504
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,520
Hello, who's this?

1505
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:09,520
Hey, what's going on?

1506
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:10,520
This is GZ.

1507
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,520
Is this who?

1508
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,520
GZDR4E.

1509
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:17,600
Okay, what's on your mind, buddy?

1510
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,600
Digital life.

1511
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,960
Ah, I swear to God, if this is about DDR, we're not continuing this phone call, but

1512
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:23,960
what's on your mind?

1513
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,280
How is digital life?

1514
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,920
Retro arcade area.

1515
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,120
Big problem.

1516
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,720
What big problem in the retro...

1517
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:37,440
Apparently, on VIP day on Thursday, they wanted Billy Mitchell to have a photo out with the

1518
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,320
Donkey Kong machine.

1519
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,480
I was playing on the machine.

1520
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:44,160
They told me to get off the machine.

1521
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,160
I refused.

1522
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:49,680
They threatened to take my VIP pass and kick me off the premises.

1523
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:53,520
So I just let them have the machine.

1524
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,240
Were you going for a high score or something?

1525
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:59,520
I mean, were you about ready to be the new King of Kong?

1526
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,080
Just playing off the machine.

1527
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,080
What was that?

1528
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:08,240
Just playing the machine.

1529
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:11,440
So I mean, how does that feel that they had to just kick you off there because somebody

1530
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,280
more important was in town and needed a photo op?

1531
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:16,280
That's kind of got to suck.

1532
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:21,160
Yeah, it's all about power there, I guess.

1533
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:25,280
You're going to have to actually get the world record on the machine, and then you'll be

1534
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:28,640
able to get on any Donkey Kong machine you want in the world.

1535
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:31,560
There you have it.

1536
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:35,160
So were you so mad that you just kind of left, or did you walk around and check out other

1537
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,880
stuff that was at Digital Life?

1538
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:41,640
No, I just left, I was mad.

1539
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:42,640
Wow.

1540
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:43,640
All right.

1541
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:50,640
Well, I'm sorry to hear that about getting kicked off the machine, but will you try again

1542
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,680
for Digital Life next year, or you think you're kind of done with it?

1543
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,880
Yeah, I'll try again next year.

1544
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:56,880
All right.

1545
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:00,880
Well, just be careful because if there's a movie about asteroids next year, you'll probably

1546
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:05,520
want to stay away from the asteroid's machine or the same thing might happen.

1547
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,520
Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1548
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,480
All right, take care.

1549
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,680
All right, take care.

1550
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:16,840
There's connection problems there or something, but thank you for sharing the injustices of

1551
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:20,080
Donkey Kong in this world.

1552
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,080
Sorry to hear it.

1553
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:23,280
All right, let's go to the phones and take more calls.

1554
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1555
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Who's this?

1556
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:32,600
So, I heard that they were holding the bar, and that wasn't cool.

1557
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:33,600
Wow.

1558
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,280
Welcome to DDR Drama Chat.

1559
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,280
How can we help you?

1560
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:38,280
No, this is Bobby.

1561
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:39,280
What's going on, guys?

1562
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,280
Hi, Bobby.

1563
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:41,280
How are you?

1564
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,280
It's good to hear from you.

1565
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:46,680
You were asking about people that were in a Halo 3 midnight launch.

1566
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:49,720
How did I know you'd call about this?

1567
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:50,720
Yeah, what happened?

1568
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:51,720
What's your story?

1569
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:56,840
Well, actually, the full story I'm not going to go into, but I was actually up in Bellevue,

1570
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:02,080
Washington as a guest of Microsoft, so I attended one of the big midnight launches.

1571
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:06,320
I was not standing in line for it, but it was a huge party.

1572
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,160
It was actually fun being there.

1573
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,200
I had fun, and I wasn't even getting the game.

1574
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,200
Wow.

1575
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,160
It was a cheap piece of skinnier in person.

1576
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,200
Just wanted to throw that out there.

1577
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,200
Okay.

1578
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,760
So, what did you guys get to do?

1579
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,160
Didn't you guys get to go hand out goodies to people in line and stuff?

1580
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:26,600
Yeah, I handed out some Halo 3 shirts, and we had some Halo 3 lanyards, and these little

1581
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:29,440
five-dollar Burger King credit card things.

1582
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:34,040
So, we were giving out, it doesn't get you a happy meal or anything, but it was at least

1583
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:35,040
five dollars towards something.

1584
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:40,600
We were just giving those out to people in the line for doing stupid stuff or just throwing

1585
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:41,600
them out.

1586
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,600
That sounds like fun.

1587
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,600
Were there tons of people there?

1588
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:45,600
There were probably about four hundred.

1589
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:46,600
Wow.

1590
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,560
Four hundred to five hundred people there, all in line.

1591
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:52,000
It stretched all the way down to the Home Depot that was across the parking lot.

1592
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Dang.

1593
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
And everything.

1594
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,160
Mountain Dew was giving out the game fuel and all their other stuff, and Balls showed

1595
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:05,360
up with this big, huge van, and Bungee showed up in a big charter bus coming straight from

1596
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:09,720
their launch party, so they were all boozed up and giving out calendars and swag.

1597
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:10,720
Bill Gates showed up.

1598
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:15,960
He shook hands with the first fifty people in line right after he rolled out of bed.

1599
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:16,960
But it was a big party.

1600
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:22,120
I think Warren Moon was there, and everybody was like, we love you in tech mobile.

1601
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:26,280
I wish we could have been there to hand out orange soda and cookies in our traditional

1602
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,640
fashion, but maybe next, maybe for Halo 4.

1603
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,800
Oh wait, I guess there can't be a Halo 4, can there?

1604
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:32,800
Yeah, well.

1605
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,120
They'll find a way.

1606
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:37,040
Now, it's just the end of the story arc.

1607
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,160
They never said it was the end of Halo.

1608
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,800
Doesn't the box advertise the end to the Halo chosen?

1609
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:42,800
Halo Wars will be there.

1610
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:43,800
There'll be more.

1611
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:44,800
There'll be more.

1612
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,240
There'll be another game to get excited about later.

1613
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:47,240
There's always something.

1614
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:53,480
Now, they did throw out these stress balls that were oranges, and they were actually

1615
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:56,400
throwing them at people, like helping people with it.

1616
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,560
Did you save one for us, Bobby?

1617
01:16:58,560 --> 01:16:59,560
They didn't help them at me.

1618
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:00,560
They were throwing people in line.

1619
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:01,560
I'm so sorry.

1620
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:02,560
That's alright.

1621
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:08,800
We'll just put that on the list of reasons to start a fight with you, that's all.

1622
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:09,800
There you go.

1623
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:15,800
Yeah, people were walking out of there with big Halo clicks, the big, huge Spartan stuff,

1624
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:20,520
because there was the WizKids stuff, and people were walking out of there with hundreds of

1625
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:25,600
dollars worth of stuff, and I'm like, you guys realize this is just for a DVD?

1626
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:29,600
Did you see people dropping $800, like the guy Brad said he saw that bought the Xbox?

1627
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,600
Yes.

1628
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:31,600
With the game?

1629
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:32,600
Oh my gosh.

1630
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:37,360
We did see somebody walk out with the big, huge Halo action clicks, figuring it was a

1631
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:43,040
$800 and the legendary edition, and then I did see one Xbox 360 sold along with that

1632
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,680
stuff, so yeah, I can fully believe.

1633
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:49,040
Was that people just caught up in the moment, you think, or do you think there's just people

1634
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:52,000
that are that hardcore for their Halo?

1635
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,160
I think it'd be people that are that hardcore, or to buy the 360, it might be somebody who

1636
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:58,680
never got a 360 until Halo came out.

1637
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:05,440
Yeah, that would make sense, because I got the original Xbox as a Halo one, because I

1638
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:09,680
didn't buy it until Halo was out, and it had been out a little while, and they did those

1639
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:15,640
special green Xboxes, and I was like, oh, I have to get one of those, so I guess that

1640
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:16,640
was me.

1641
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:19,800
I didn't wait no midnight line for it either, though.

1642
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:23,920
You didn't need to wait in a midnight line, because as I've been telling some people,

1643
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:28,160
the Fry's Electronics near me, we walked in yesterday, there are 10 legendary editions

1644
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,160
sitting on the shelf.

1645
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:35,000
Yeah, I went to Fry's too, and they just had tons and tons of Halo 3, and I didn't even

1646
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
get the limited edition.

1647
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,760
I'm not that into Halo, I just got the regular game.

1648
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:45,320
Yeah, they only gave us the regular game, so I don't have any of the cutscene discs

1649
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,520
or anything else that came with it.

1650
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:53,720
Well, Loki had the other one early, because he's sly like that.

1651
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:54,720
Good times.

1652
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:57,960
Which reminds me, I still need to load the bonus stuff that you have on your one disc,

1653
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:58,960
Loki.

1654
01:18:58,960 --> 01:18:59,960
Don't let me forget.

1655
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:00,960
Anyhow.

1656
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,360
Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners, Bobby?

1657
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:04,080
I'm glad to hear you had a good time.

1658
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,680
Yeah, no, that's it.

1659
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:10,560
You just wanted to talk about the Halo 3 launch, but really, that guy, when he touched the

1660
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:15,440
bar and we just really all got pissed off at him and stuff, that just...

1661
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,440
They didn't kick him out.

1662
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:22,280
Okay, I had to hang up on Bobby, because I didn't want to hear about DDR drama.

1663
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:23,920
And there is no bar raping in Halo.

1664
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:24,920
Come on.

1665
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:25,920
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1666
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:26,920
Who's this?

1667
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:27,920
Hey, guys.

1668
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:28,920
It's SSJ-100 Matt.

1669
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:31,760
Well, hello, SSJ-100 Matt.

1670
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:32,760
What's on your mind?

1671
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:37,080
I'm exhausted from a digital life.

1672
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:38,760
Dare I ask about...

1673
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:39,760
I don't know.

1674
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,320
There's no drama on this call.

1675
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,320
Even though I judged...

1676
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,320
Praise you.

1677
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,320
You're a great man.

1678
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:46,900
Even though what?

1679
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:52,360
Even though I was helping the judge on the elephant in the room.

1680
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:58,740
Okay, well, tell us about digital life, like what else you saw there and some of the other

1681
01:19:58,740 --> 01:19:59,740
stuff.

1682
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:03,160
What else there was in digital life besides DDR?

1683
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:06,520
For the most part, well, this is my first time going.

1684
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:11,840
From what I understand, it was a lot smaller than last year, but gaming-wise, I had a really

1685
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:15,080
good time.

1686
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:21,800
They premiered a lot of games that haven't been out yet, mostly PC stuff.

1687
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:30,200
I got to play World in Conflict, I should say, which I thought was pretty good.

1688
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:37,840
I wanted to try to get on Hellgate London, but the line was too long for that.

1689
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:43,480
And the biggest surprise, I would say, and Loki's going to hate me for this, was The

1690
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:45,560
Eye of Judgment.

1691
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:46,560
Really?

1692
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:47,960
Another positive...

1693
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:49,640
Is this a positive review of The Eye of Judgment?

1694
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:50,640
You thought it was cool?

1695
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:51,640
Yes.

1696
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:57,720
Yeah, I don't have a PS3 yet, but I would seriously consider it.

1697
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:01,140
This is not the first person that's called in to say The Eye of Judgment is better than

1698
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:02,140
you think.

1699
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:05,480
Actually, I was hearing some good reviews from the GameCrazy managers when they got

1700
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:06,600
back from conference.

1701
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,880
What the crap is going on?

1702
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:11,480
That you don't have to photocopy or buy any booster packs or anything.

1703
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:13,700
It comes with all of the cards available for the game.

1704
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:18,200
But Jamie, seriously, you did see the same thing we saw at E3 last year, right?

1705
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,200
With The Eye of Judgment?

1706
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,200
I didn't go to The Eye of Judgment.

1707
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:24,280
It doesn't come with all of the cards, because that's why they sell booster packs in assorted

1708
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:25,280
decks.

1709
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,800
No, that's what they were saying at the GameCrazy managers conference that's coming with them

1710
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:29,800
all intact.

1711
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:32,040
I bet you it's not.

1712
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,040
That's from the vendor.

1713
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,040
I'm misinformed.

1714
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,040
That's from the vendor.

1715
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,040
Wait, hold on.

1716
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:37,040
Let's go back to the hall.

1717
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,040
What caller?

1718
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:42,040
From what I understand, from what I was told, actually Wizards of the Coast is handling

1719
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:44,040
the game packs, I believe.

1720
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:48,320
Well, I actually should, because they were the ones hosting the event.

1721
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:55,960
But anyways, they're going to be giving out 150 cards when you buy the game, at least

1722
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:56,960
that's what they say.

1723
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:57,960
Well, maybe that was what it was.

1724
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:01,120
Yeah, because they figured out, probably, that everyone's going to pirate them anyways,

1725
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:02,120
so.

1726
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:03,120
All right.

1727
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:07,400
Well, actually, you know, I'm going to be sending you guys a couple gifts, and one of

1728
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,560
the gifts is actually a couple cards from the game.

1729
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,680
So you guys will get this checked.

1730
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:13,680
Awesome.

1731
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:16,160
I'm actually thinking about getting the game, honestly.

1732
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:19,600
Go right ahead, it's not going to sell a million units.

1733
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:20,760
I'm just not going to happen.

1734
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:23,800
I think this turnaround is hilarious, in my own mind.

1735
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:28,600
Well, just from what I was hearing from the feedback from the manager's conference, I

1736
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:31,200
was like, well, I'll give it a try.

1737
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,200
So maybe.

1738
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,200
All right.

1739
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:43,560
What else in digital life would you think was cool?

1740
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:46,960
They touched on it before, but I really like Guitar Hero 3.

1741
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,760
Okay.

1742
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:52,840
It was kind of hard to hear any of the songs, because, you know, the whole convention itself

1743
01:22:52,840 --> 01:23:02,360
was loud as hell, but it just reminded me, it just seemed like a better version of one

1744
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:05,360
and two.

1745
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:09,480
Someone said it seems like modifiers, but there are involved, but I don't know how true

1746
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:12,320
that is.

1747
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:15,160
So it didn't just feel like Guitar Hero 2 with new songs?

1748
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:23,200
No, it didn't seem like a copy and paste, like 80s style, or whatever, 80s mix.

1749
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:26,840
Which basically was a copy and paste job, but that's a whole other story.

1750
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:27,840
Yeah.

1751
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:28,840
All right.

1752
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:32,640
So if you had to judge digital life on a scale of one to ten, what would you give it?

1753
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:38,920
Well, considering this was my first one, I'd have to give it like seven out of ten.

1754
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:39,920
All right.

1755
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:40,920
It's not bad.

1756
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:48,240
Yeah, I'll be sending you guys out a couple of stuff, including some VROs I got from the

1757
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:51,240
Elephant in the Closet.

1758
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:54,200
The game we can't speak of tonight.

1759
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:58,040
We're going to give it the JT treatment, I guess.

1760
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:59,040
That's all right.

1761
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:02,960
No, we do love DDR, which is why it pains us so much to hear about all this drama.

1762
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:03,960
Can't we all just get along?

1763
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:05,240
You people are playing a dancing game.

1764
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,240
Don't take it that seriously.

1765
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,240
All right.

1766
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:11,720
Well, SJ100, Matt, we've got to let you go, but thank you so much for calling in and giving

1767
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:15,520
us a drama-free report from Digital Life.

1768
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:16,520
We appreciate it.

1769
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:17,520
Don't mention it.

1770
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,520
All right.

1771
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:19,520
Take care, buddy.

1772
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:20,520
Yep.

1773
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:21,520
Take care.

1774
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:22,520
I love this.

1775
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:23,520
Mr. Gohan in chat sums this up perfectly.

1776
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,320
After this, who knows?

1777
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:28,740
Africa could be Loki's favorite game ever.

1778
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:30,440
Only if I get to run over the animals.

1779
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,080
All right, guys.

1780
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,720
That's going to do it for the Sky Flying tonight.

1781
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:36,760
Sorry to those folks that didn't get through, but thank you guys very much.

1782
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,720
We've been going a long time on this segment.

1783
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:42,200
It's about time to go around and wrap things up, but first, we've got to ask if there's

1784
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:44,200
any last-minute stories.

1785
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:45,200
No.

1786
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:46,200
No.

1787
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,200
Wow.

1788
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,200
No last-minute stories.

1789
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:50,200
That might be a first.

1790
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,600
In other news, I like beer.

1791
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,600
All right.

1792
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:53,600
Me too.

1793
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,440
Well, then let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1794
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,000
Dark Sakura, we'll start with you.

1795
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
What's your final thought?

1796
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,360
In other words, I like beer.

1797
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:06,720
My final thought is I need another air conditioning event in here because it's getting too hot.

1798
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:07,720
Too hot.

1799
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:08,720
Loki.

1800
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:12,640
My final thought is asshole Mario is hilarious.

1801
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:13,640
Hilarious.

1802
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:16,040
It's like you can't stop watching it.

1803
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:17,040
I can't.

1804
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:20,800
We'll see you back here next week, boys and girls, for Orange Launch Radio episode number

1805
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,200
250, if you can believe it.

1806
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:29,520
I'm telling you, I know how G4 is desperate for television to play all these back-to-back.

1807
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,520
There you go.

1808
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:31,520
There's a good hour block.

1809
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,520
Isn't it a three-day weekend?

1810
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:33,520
What?

1811
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:34,520
Next weekend.

1812
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:35,520
Is next weekend a three-day weekend?

1813
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:36,520
I don't think so.

1814
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:37,520
I don't know.

1815
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:38,520
Unless you get Columbus Day off.

1816
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:39,520
I get Columbus Day.

1817
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:40,520
That's why.

1818
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:41,520
Because I work for...

1819
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:42,520
I think it's Columbus Day.

1820
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:43,520
Because I get banking holidays.

1821
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:44,520
Well, lucky you.

1822
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:45,520
Not me.

1823
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:46,520
I'm going to get...

1824
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:50,120
I'm going to bring some Metoxa and drink it on the show.

1825
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,120
All right.

1826
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,440
Stay tuned and see how that goes.

1827
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:55,520
We'll be back next week with more of Orange Launch Radio.

1828
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:56,520
See you guys then.

1829
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:57,520

1832
