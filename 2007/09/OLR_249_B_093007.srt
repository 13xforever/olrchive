[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:20,892 --> 00:00:21,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio

3
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:50,132
[SPEAKER_12]: Be good or Santa's not going to bring you the games you want.

4
00:00:50,652 --> 00:00:53,933
[SPEAKER_12]: But we will keep bringing you the gaming news you want, whether you've been good or bad.

5
00:00:54,593 --> 00:00:56,654
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're going to get right back into some gaming news, aren't we, Loki?

6
00:00:56,834 --> 00:01:00,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and this game's kind of interesting.

7
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:06,677
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how popular it's going to be because you've got kind of conflicting elements to it.

8
00:01:06,777 --> 00:01:11,078
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, Mario and Sonic at the Olympics.

9
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:14,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, Mario and Sonic games, those are good.

10
00:01:15,072 --> 00:01:17,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Olympic Games, those are usually bad.

11
00:01:17,573 --> 00:01:20,355
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's kind of... I don't know.

12
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,856
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it's going to be good or not.

13
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:22,456
[SPEAKER_10]: Either way.

14
00:01:22,536 --> 00:01:23,796
[SPEAKER_10]: This could go either way.

15
00:01:24,557 --> 00:01:24,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Either way.

16
00:01:25,257 --> 00:01:32,921
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be 16 characters, including your favorites from both the Sonic and Mario and, I guess, Nintendo universes.

17
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:43,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Although, what's weird, though, is I do see the villain from one of the alligators from the Donkey Kong Country franchises, yet no Donkey Kong.

18
00:01:44,607 --> 00:01:44,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Odd.

19
00:01:45,347 --> 00:01:46,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Fencing, Archery,

20
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:22,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Shooting, Skeet, Gymnastics, including Trampoline and Vault, High Jump, Pull Vault, Long Jump, Triple Jump, Javelin Throw, Hammer Throw, Single Skulls for rowing, of course, Table Tennis, Aquatics, both the 100 meter and, of course, the 4-lap 100 meter.

21
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,440
[SPEAKER_10]: And let's see here, Tracks, of course, 110 meter, 400 meter, Hurdles, Freestyle,

22
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:34,659
[SPEAKER_10]: 100m Relay, and the just normal 100m and 400m.

23
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,721
[SPEAKER_10]: So lots of running and stuff.

24
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:41,984
[SPEAKER_12]: I still don't understand how Mario is ever going to beat Sonic in running.

25
00:02:42,044 --> 00:02:44,026
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody's been able to explain this logic to me.

26
00:02:44,246 --> 00:02:47,328
[SPEAKER_12]: Did they give Sonic some drugs to slow him down?

27
00:02:47,728 --> 00:02:49,330
[SPEAKER_12]: Or Mario some steroids?

28
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,611
[SPEAKER_12]: How is that ever going to be an even match?

29
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:59,277
[SPEAKER_10]: The characters in the game, they've kind of broken them up like they did with Mario Kart, where you've got the power types, the ones that

30
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:06,532
[SPEAKER_10]: are more of the robust characters, like Bowser and Wario, stuff like that.

31
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,613
[SPEAKER_10]: And Knuckles is in there too, so apparently Knuckles is a fat ass.

32
00:03:10,353 --> 00:03:11,053
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a fatty.

33
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,034
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, he does have a little bit of a gut.

34
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:19,075
[SPEAKER_12]: What they're saying, Dark Knight says in our chat room at chat.orangelongery.com, they balance the characters.

35
00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:26,717
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand they balance the characters, but that still doesn't make sense in the regards of that Sonic runs very fast and Mario runs quickly.

36
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:31,601
[SPEAKER_10]: They also have all-around characters, which Mario falls under, as well as Luigi.

37
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:36,105
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently also the two chicks from the Sonic universe.

38
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:39,167
[SPEAKER_10]: So Mario and Luigi, you're as powerful as chicks.

39
00:03:39,688 --> 00:03:41,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Way to go, pansies.

40
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:44,792
[SPEAKER_12]: Whoa, I think there might be some women a little angry at that comment.

41
00:03:45,532 --> 00:03:50,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, honestly.

42
00:03:50,677 --> 00:03:53,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. DeBucket in chat says they wouldn't let Bowser into the Chinese Olympics.

43
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:54,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

44
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:55,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh...

45
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,101
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, for the speed types, you have Sonic.

46
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:01,861
[SPEAKER_10]: You actually have... What's his name?

47
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, the crappy game.

48
00:04:05,102 --> 00:04:06,102
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the crappy game?

49
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:08,503
[SPEAKER_12]: Driver.

50
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:10,223
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Sonic game.

51
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Crappy Sonic game.

52
00:04:11,443 --> 00:04:12,303
[SPEAKER_12]: Sonic the Hedgehog.

53
00:04:12,563 --> 00:04:16,344
[SPEAKER_10]: No, the last one that came out before Sonic... I don't know.

54
00:04:16,384 --> 00:04:17,444
[SPEAKER_10]: The guy with the gun.

55
00:04:18,285 --> 00:04:18,565
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

56
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:19,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Shadow the Hedgehog?

57
00:04:19,785 --> 00:04:20,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Shadow, yes.

58
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:21,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

59
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:24,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, they all look alike, and those games kind of blend together, so...

60
00:04:25,302 --> 00:04:27,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Part of me for forgetting that crappy game.

61
00:04:27,723 --> 00:04:35,766
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, the skill types where you have Princess Peach, Tails, Waluigi, and Dr. Eggman.

62
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:41,848
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope Princess Peach will be able to use her emotional power in the Olympic Games somehow.

63
00:04:42,068 --> 00:04:43,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that would be a skill, I guess.

64
00:04:43,608 --> 00:04:44,068
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.

65
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:45,069
[SPEAKER_12]: Some type of skill.

66
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:45,789
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

67
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:47,249
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's going to be all split up.

68
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

69
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,431
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

70
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:54,712
[SPEAKER_10]: To be honest, I don't think I'm going to buy this game.

71
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:57,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I'd rent it.

72
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:06,086
[SPEAKER_10]: All it seems to me is it's like, hey, we put out another crappy Olympics game, but we have Sonic and Mario this time, so you're going to buy it, right?

73
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:06,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh?

74
00:05:06,587 --> 00:05:06,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh?

75
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:07,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah?

76
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:15,314
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe we'll have advertising for these games during the Olympics and that kind of crap, so cross-promotion stuff.

77
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:24,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Be honest, though, I think you guys are going to get suckered into buying another crappy Olympics game because it has characters that you like, so have at it.

78
00:05:24,577 --> 00:05:26,839
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be busy playing Super Mario Galaxy instead.

79
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:30,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I will be busy playing Super Smash Bros.

80
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:31,342
[SPEAKER_12]: Brawl when that comes out.

81
00:05:31,642 --> 00:05:33,284
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, yeah.

82
00:05:33,484 --> 00:05:34,445
[SPEAKER_12]: Upon its release, yes.

83
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:43,912
[SPEAKER_12]: And one thing that has lots of fanboys and girls very excited, especially if you're a David Hader fanboy or fangirl, which I believe DarkSakura is a David Hader fangirl.

84
00:05:44,072 --> 00:05:46,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he could just talk to me all day and I'll be happy.

85
00:05:46,153 --> 00:05:47,214
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you watch his YouTube?

86
00:05:47,254 --> 00:05:51,838
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently he has a YouTube site where he does all these little Q&A things and does stuff on there.

87
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:52,758
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know that.

88
00:05:52,778 --> 00:05:53,379
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to check.

89
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:54,520
[SPEAKER_12]: You definitely should check that out.

90
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,702
[SPEAKER_12]: This guy named Archduke Chocula was checking it out and sent David Hayter a question.

91
00:05:59,762 --> 00:06:01,163
[SPEAKER_12]: It said, Hello, David Hayter.

92
00:06:01,203 --> 00:06:03,344
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to say you are one of the greatest voice actors ever.

93
00:06:04,324 --> 00:06:05,565
[SPEAKER_12]: And you do a great job as Snake.

94
00:06:05,925 --> 00:06:08,747
[SPEAKER_12]: I was wondering, are you going to voice Snake in the Super Smash Bros.

95
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:09,267
[SPEAKER_12]: Brawl?

96
00:06:09,647 --> 00:06:14,309
[SPEAKER_12]: To which David Hayter responded, I am indeed voicing Snake in Smash Bros.

97
00:06:14,429 --> 00:06:18,791
[SPEAKER_12]: I recorded it already, and I believe that fans of both games are going to be extremely happy.

98
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:19,612
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very cool.

99
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:20,833
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all I can say.

100
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:25,336
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is authentic Snake now because it's the same voice actor and everything.

101
00:06:25,757 --> 00:06:33,743
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's just one more cool thing that you can put on the ever-growing list of cool things in Smash Bros.

102
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:34,044
[SPEAKER_12]: Brawl.

103
00:06:34,064 --> 00:06:34,664
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, seriously.

104
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:35,745
[SPEAKER_07]: I love David Hader.

105
00:06:35,785 --> 00:06:36,806
[SPEAKER_12]: Got Resetti in there.

106
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:40,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, they put fucking Resetti in Smash Bros.

107
00:06:40,828 --> 00:06:40,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Brawl.

108
00:06:40,948 --> 00:06:42,948
[SPEAKER_07]: What is he going to do, bitch at you until you die?

109
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:46,330
[SPEAKER_12]: He comes out and lectures you on the mechanics of how to play the game, I think.

110
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,730
[SPEAKER_12]: Was that the impression I got?

111
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,251
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think he's like an item or anything.

112
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,312
[SPEAKER_12]: I think he lectures you on how to play the game.

113
00:06:51,352 --> 00:06:54,673
[SPEAKER_07]: I want Mr. Saturn still in the game as an item because I love Mr. Saturn.

114
00:06:55,193 --> 00:06:56,374
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want Ness.

115
00:06:56,694 --> 00:06:57,574
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that too much to ask?

116
00:06:57,614 --> 00:06:58,255
[SPEAKER_12]: PK Fire?

117
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Or how about, like, was it Howard and Nestor?

118
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Dark Knight says, I would love to have a Smash Bros.

119
00:07:05,112 --> 00:07:05,773
[SPEAKER_12]: on the DS.

120
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:07,254
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, I bet that'll be the next one.

121
00:07:08,115 --> 00:07:09,076
[SPEAKER_12]: I bet that'll be the next one.

122
00:07:09,236 --> 00:07:09,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

123
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:09,897
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway.

124
00:07:10,718 --> 00:07:21,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, speaking of things Nintendo, for Virtual Console coming out in the UK, Sin and Punishment is the recent edition, which is a Nintendo 64 game.

125
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:23,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty cool game, and...

126
00:07:24,554 --> 00:07:25,815
[SPEAKER_07]: The Legend of Hirotanma

127
00:07:51,563 --> 00:07:56,785
[SPEAKER_12]: Anticipation Anticipation Anticipation Anticipation Anticipation Anticipation Anticipation Anticipation

128
00:08:18,952 --> 00:08:19,953
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, check out this game.

129
00:08:19,973 --> 00:08:21,474
[SPEAKER_12]: You get to go save a princess and do shit.

130
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:23,375
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm saving the best for last.

131
00:08:23,655 --> 00:08:24,536
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's Mario?

132
00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:24,976
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

133
00:08:25,196 --> 00:08:25,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Zelda?

134
00:08:26,057 --> 00:08:26,337
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

135
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:28,278
[SPEAKER_12]: Just, you know, some princess.

136
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonder Boy!

137
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonder Boy and Monsterland did come out, didn't it?

138
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:33,942
[SPEAKER_12]: I think so.

139
00:08:34,022 --> 00:08:35,323
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Wonder Boy and Monsterland.

140
00:08:35,423 --> 00:08:40,527
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, Gradius 3, which was a SNES game.

141
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:41,748
[SPEAKER_07]: 900 Wii points.

142
00:08:42,508 --> 00:08:44,990
[SPEAKER_07]: And dude, it's fucking Gradius, so you won it right now.

143
00:08:46,121 --> 00:08:53,326
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's also part of that Japanese gamey thing that, you know, the releasing games in the UK that we don't have over here.

144
00:08:53,546 --> 00:08:54,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Gradius 3.

145
00:08:55,207 --> 00:08:55,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Sad.

146
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:58,048
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually have Gradius 3, though.

147
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:00,790
[SPEAKER_12]: It's in the Gradius collection on PSP.

148
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, but I actually have the cart.

149
00:09:04,012 --> 00:09:05,253
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, can I touch you?

150
00:09:05,313 --> 00:09:06,193
[SPEAKER_12]: You're just so cool.

151
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:06,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I have Gradius 2.

152
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:09,015
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want a little piece of your coolness.

153
00:09:09,135 --> 00:09:13,458
[SPEAKER_07]: I have Gradius 2 on Turbo Duo, which is the best version of that game ever.

154
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:14,875
[SPEAKER_12]: GATE OF THUNDER

155
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:42,662
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'll be coming out for 800 Wii Points as well as Super Air Zonk will be coming out as well.

156
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:44,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Air Zonk was such a bizarre little game.

157
00:09:46,465 --> 00:09:50,749
[SPEAKER_10]: The TurboGrafx-16 was a bizarre little console, so it makes perfect sense.

158
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:51,809
[SPEAKER_07]: But it had some great stuff on it.

159
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I pressed the bathroom door to get a copy of Pac-Land.

160
00:09:56,794 --> 00:09:57,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember the button?

161
00:09:57,634 --> 00:10:00,777
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my god, that was so long ago.

162
00:10:00,937 --> 00:10:02,098
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, that was great.

163
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:04,180
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we were at Classic Gaming Expo, right?

164
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

165
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:07,808
[SPEAKER_12]: And they were selling Pac-Land on the TurboGrafx-16.

166
00:10:07,988 --> 00:10:09,409
[SPEAKER_07]: I was with $5 short.

167
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,910
[SPEAKER_12]: And Jamie was like, I want that.

168
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,671
[SPEAKER_12]: I just need $5 to get it.

169
00:10:13,371 --> 00:10:17,434
[SPEAKER_12]: And so there was this little... God, this is so stupid.

170
00:10:17,454 --> 00:10:17,854
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the bathroom.

171
00:10:17,874 --> 00:10:18,734
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe we're telling this story.

172
00:10:18,754 --> 00:10:20,395
[SPEAKER_07]: There were three doors that had the automatic button.

173
00:10:20,415 --> 00:10:22,716
[SPEAKER_12]: But seriously, Jamie, this was like you had to be there thing.

174
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,757
[SPEAKER_12]: The listeners are going to be like, this story isn't funny at all.

175
00:10:24,818 --> 00:10:28,259
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will do stuff for TurboGrafx games.

176
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:34,843
[SPEAKER_12]: This little girl we saw, she ran up and pressed the button to open the handicap restroom and then ran away.

177
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:38,778
[SPEAKER_12]: And for some reason, this is the most hilarious thing in the world to us.

178
00:10:38,798 --> 00:10:40,679
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, we were laughing and laughing at this little girl.

179
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:41,540
[SPEAKER_10]: We were that bored.

180
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,441
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I guess so.

181
00:10:43,121 --> 00:10:47,964
[SPEAKER_12]: So I said to Jamie, I said, Jamie, if you mimic what that little girl just did, I'll give you five dollars.

182
00:10:48,365 --> 00:10:48,965
[SPEAKER_12]: And she did it.

183
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:49,766
[SPEAKER_12]: We took pictures.

184
00:10:49,826 --> 00:10:50,406
[SPEAKER_12]: They're somewhere.

185
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:52,327
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, I don't know.

186
00:10:53,148 --> 00:10:55,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know how many times I've played that copy of Pac-Land?

187
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:55,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Once.

188
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:56,751
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

189
00:10:57,651 --> 00:10:59,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Not even on the actual duo.

190
00:10:59,152 --> 00:11:00,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I played it on a Turbo Express.

191
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:01,454
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, my five bucks back.

192
00:11:02,134 --> 00:11:02,354
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

193
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:03,695
[SPEAKER_07]: You can come play my game, though.

194
00:11:04,076 --> 00:11:04,536
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to.

195
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Other game, well another TurboGrafx game announced as well, Samurai Ghost.

196
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,692
[SPEAKER_10]: But of course that's not a TurboCD title.

197
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,092
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, more people just entered the studio.

198
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:19,413
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep going with the story, ignore them for a minute.

199
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:22,994
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's it, all your TurboCD games.

200
00:11:24,994 --> 00:11:25,374
[SPEAKER_12]: Was that it?

201
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,235
[SPEAKER_12]: No more news on TurboGrafx CD games?

202
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:28,875
[SPEAKER_12]: Nope, that was it.

203
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:36,622
[SPEAKER_12]: Going back to Nintendo Wii, Fatal Frame is being developed for the Nintendo Wii.

204
00:11:38,062 --> 00:11:41,344
[SPEAKER_12]: It's being developed by Grasshopper and it's being published by Tecmo.

205
00:11:42,565 --> 00:11:46,206
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's being worked on very soon, I guess, right now.

206
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:48,507
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's kind of cool because Fatal Frame is very popular.

207
00:11:48,587 --> 00:11:54,190
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's no Silent Hill or Resident Evil, but it's probably on that secondary tier of scary video games.

208
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,512
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we're always curious to see how games translate over to the Wii.

209
00:11:57,792 --> 00:12:00,093
[SPEAKER_12]: But you can bet there'll probably be something to do with photography.

210
00:12:00,905 --> 00:12:02,386
[SPEAKER_12]: and the Wiimote and all that stuff.

211
00:12:03,947 --> 00:12:06,469
[SPEAKER_07]: All that stuff is very specific, Rob.

212
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,310
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

213
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:12,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this makes me a happy, happy, happy bunny.

214
00:12:13,313 --> 00:12:18,397
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my favorite games ever... They're distracting me, Rob!

215
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:19,998
[SPEAKER_12]: Ignore them and read the story.

216
00:12:20,418 --> 00:12:24,161
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my favorite ever games is Samba de Amigo and there is...

217
00:12:26,252 --> 00:12:29,033
[SPEAKER_07]: A statement that it is going to be on the Wii.

218
00:12:29,253 --> 00:12:42,417
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposedly this cover scan from Nintendo Power that's floating around ye old interwebs showing a Samba de Amigo for the Wii.

219
00:12:44,338 --> 00:12:47,699
[SPEAKER_12]: Samba de Amigo on the Wii is going to be awesome.

220
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:50,159
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing, though, in the issue regarding gameplay.

221
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,020
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

222
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,440
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

223
00:12:53,755 --> 00:12:59,657
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, let's introduce, you know, Extifer and Rice Princess barged in here, so I thought I'd let them say hello.

224
00:13:01,037 --> 00:13:02,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hello there.

225
00:13:02,597 --> 00:13:03,478
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm British now.

226
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:05,878
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you kids up to this evening?

227
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,179
[SPEAKER_01]: We basically came here to say hi.

228
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:11,080
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been on Orange Lingerie in a while.

229
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, since I called in.

230
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,741
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it that way.

231
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:14,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Aww.

232
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:16,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Were you here last week?

233
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, I called in last week.

234
00:13:18,262 --> 00:13:18,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's right.

235
00:13:19,578 --> 00:13:35,747
[SPEAKER_01]: um but i i decided to it's me and rice princess say hi say hi rice princess hi rice princess okay and um we just want to say hi and oh yeah we want you to do a song that we want on the cage match

236
00:13:37,006 --> 00:13:37,786
[SPEAKER_01]: The Game of Life Rice Princess

237
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,550
[SPEAKER_06]: That is what you said last week.

238
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:10,131
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding.

239
00:14:11,512 --> 00:14:22,776
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been playing WoW and I played Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo last night at a certain party that was thrown that I attended and it was fun.

240
00:14:24,216 --> 00:14:30,218
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I have a question about Puzzle Fighter 2 because you loved the one that was on Sony PlayStation and the old school one.

241
00:14:30,258 --> 00:14:32,039
[SPEAKER_12]: How does the Xbox 360 one compare?

242
00:14:33,598 --> 00:14:36,899
[SPEAKER_06]: The game itself isn't bad, but the controller is god-awful.

243
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, when I wanted to press down, it would go, like, to the left or to the right.

244
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:41,639
[SPEAKER_06]: It made me mad.

245
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:42,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I being too quiet?

246
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry about that.

247
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,200
[SPEAKER_06]: I will raise my voice.

248
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the game itself isn't bad, but the controller is, like, a nightmare to use to play that game.

249
00:14:53,361 --> 00:14:55,442
[SPEAKER_06]: But, yeah, I enjoyed it thoroughly.

250
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:57,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

251
00:14:58,282 --> 00:15:00,643
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you try the remix mode with the different drop patterns and stuff?

252
00:15:01,843 --> 00:15:02,183
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

253
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:02,743
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

254
00:15:02,763 --> 00:15:02,843
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

255
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:05,165
[SPEAKER_06]: I only went into one mode.

256
00:15:05,185 --> 00:15:07,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I just kept pressing A until the game started.

257
00:15:08,306 --> 00:15:09,686
[SPEAKER_12]: There's like way more to the game.

258
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:12,708
[SPEAKER_12]: There's like all these different, like you can play modes where you don't even just make bricks.

259
00:15:12,748 --> 00:15:17,730
[SPEAKER_12]: You make like different things and you need to check out the game a little more thoroughly.

260
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,771
[SPEAKER_12]: That was a very bad review job you did.

261
00:15:19,871 --> 00:15:20,231
[SPEAKER_12]: Fired!

262
00:15:21,731 --> 00:15:22,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, listen, son of a bitch.

263
00:15:23,012 --> 00:15:23,772
[SPEAKER_06]: You should have told me.

264
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have done that.

265
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:28,754
[SPEAKER_06]: I just kept pressing A because I really wanted to play the game.

266
00:15:28,974 --> 00:15:30,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, because I, you know what?

267
00:15:30,635 --> 00:15:33,276
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like the best at the game out of all of you, so...

268
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:37,733
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why you're making fun of me, because you're jealous of my skills.

269
00:15:39,374 --> 00:15:40,655
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, no more derailing the show.

270
00:15:40,795 --> 00:15:41,935
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got to get back to gaming news.

271
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,796
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can stay if you want to contribute to news.

272
00:15:43,836 --> 00:15:44,476
[SPEAKER_12]: Otherwise, get out.

273
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:48,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we actually are going to go.

274
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:51,159
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

275
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Way to put me on the spot.

276
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, we can stay and listen.

277
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:55,740
All right.

278
00:15:56,201 --> 00:15:56,641
[SPEAKER_12]: You do that.

279
00:15:56,681 --> 00:15:58,322
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's get back to some gaming news.

280
00:15:58,542 --> 00:15:59,442
[SPEAKER_12]: All the listeners are like,

281
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:01,066
[SPEAKER_12]: Back to gaming news?

282
00:16:01,246 --> 00:16:03,768
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, now Irene's like, I gotta go look at Puzzle Fighter.

283
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:10,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, so apparently the BAFTA nominees are coming around.

284
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:15,319
[SPEAKER_10]: For those not in the know, that's the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.

285
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:22,306
[SPEAKER_10]: They've announced their nominees for the 2007 Video Game Awards, and topping the list is Wii Sports.

286
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:27,898
[SPEAKER_10]: with seven nominations, including Innovation and Best Game categories.

287
00:16:28,658 --> 00:16:39,243
[SPEAKER_10]: And, of course, there's also a four-way tie for the second-most nominations with Crackdown, awesome game, Gears of War, also awesome game, Akami, and God of War II, all awesome games.

288
00:16:41,485 --> 00:16:42,905
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it should be Game of the Year, though.

289
00:16:43,225 --> 00:16:46,327
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty rad, though, that they give it such good recognition, though, over there.

290
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:49,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Other nominees, of course, Bioshock, Crysis.

291
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:51,250
[SPEAKER_10]: How could Crysis be nominated?

292
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,010
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not even out yet.

293
00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:57,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Gears Award, Guitar Hero 2, and Kanan Lynch.

294
00:16:58,195 --> 00:16:59,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, Kanan Lynch is not out yet.

295
00:17:01,978 --> 00:17:03,679
[SPEAKER_12]: They need a Gaming Oscars.

296
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:09,102
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not talking about the Spike TV Awards or whatever that crap is.

297
00:17:09,142 --> 00:17:11,603
[SPEAKER_12]: Does that even exist anymore?

298
00:17:12,024 --> 00:17:13,905
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's now like a segment on X-Play.

299
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:15,766
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't even matter.

300
00:17:16,586 --> 00:17:17,787
[SPEAKER_12]: None of that stuff counts.

301
00:17:17,827 --> 00:17:18,928
[SPEAKER_12]: I want a Gaming Oscars.

302
00:17:18,988 --> 00:17:20,028
[SPEAKER_12]: Something that's not a joke.

303
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:21,089
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh well.

304
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Forget it.

305
00:17:23,861 --> 00:17:25,363
[SPEAKER_10]: The Howard and Nestor Awards.

306
00:17:26,824 --> 00:17:26,964
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

307
00:17:28,226 --> 00:17:29,347
[SPEAKER_12]: The Howard and Nestor Awards.

308
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:30,508
[SPEAKER_12]: That would actually be pretty awesome.

309
00:17:30,808 --> 00:17:32,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Winners will be announced of course on October 23rd.

310
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,501
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Xbox 360 games seem to be moving over to the Nintendo DS.

311
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:42,982
[SPEAKER_12]: Heck, Viva Pinata, as you know, was announced to have an incarnation coming out on the Nintendo DS.

312
00:17:43,322 --> 00:17:43,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Guess what?

313
00:17:43,902 --> 00:17:47,342
[SPEAKER_12]: Blue Dragon is also on its way to the Nintendo DS.

314
00:17:47,702 --> 00:17:50,563
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, normally you'd kind of go, well, that doesn't seem like too big a surprise.

315
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,763
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it kind of seems like the kind of game that could have been on the DS.

316
00:17:53,063 --> 00:18:01,785
[SPEAKER_12]: But when you consider that, you know, Mistwalker made it for Microsoft, it is kind of interesting that the game is going to have an incarnation on the DS.

317
00:18:02,145 --> 00:18:05,806
[SPEAKER_12]: This was coming from a recent issue of the manga Shonen Jump.

318
00:18:06,046 --> 00:18:06,726
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's funny.

319
00:18:06,806 --> 00:18:12,728
[SPEAKER_10]: When I asked my Microsoft rep about Viva Pinata and who was publishing it, he got on a plane and left.

320
00:18:14,448 --> 00:18:14,948
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting.

321
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:16,029
[SPEAKER_10]: He didn't have the answer for me.

322
00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:16,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh.

323
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:18,269
[SPEAKER_10]: And then he got on a plane and left.

324
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:20,670
[SPEAKER_07]: That was your answer.

325
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:21,610
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess so.

326
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,851
[SPEAKER_12]: The answer was... He's like, uh, look over there.

327
00:18:24,051 --> 00:18:25,311
[SPEAKER_12]: The answer was, what's that?

328
00:18:25,511 --> 00:18:26,752
[SPEAKER_07]: The answer was, um... Run away!

329
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thanks, bye.

330
00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:28,932
[SPEAKER_12]: For real.

331
00:18:29,452 --> 00:18:30,213
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, really.

332
00:18:30,913 --> 00:18:31,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, um...

333
00:18:32,927 --> 00:18:52,079
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a little speculation regarding Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass, and it was confirmed that the producer, Eiji Aonuma, basically did agree that the game was a remake of the very first Zelda game.

334
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:58,801
[SPEAKER_12]: or it must have started off that way, but it certainly hopefully hasn't ended up that way because I don't want to pony up that kind of money.

335
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:05,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the game's already out, and I know people who play it who didn't say that it was just like it, but it was supposed to be... What the crap?

336
00:19:05,264 --> 00:19:06,325
[SPEAKER_12]: Phantom Hourglass came out?

337
00:19:06,785 --> 00:19:07,185
[SPEAKER_07]: In Japan.

338
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:08,986
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay.

339
00:19:09,487 --> 00:19:13,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, my friends have a Ninja Pass.

340
00:19:13,308 --> 00:19:15,389
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I was like, wait, wait, it came out over here?

341
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:16,490
[SPEAKER_12]: I missed that.

342
00:19:17,094 --> 00:19:24,200
[SPEAKER_07]: But at any rate, it's saying that in his attempt to return to the root series, he unintentionally remade the game.

343
00:19:25,901 --> 00:19:30,966
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not really a complete remake, it's more like a... An homage.

344
00:19:32,227 --> 00:19:33,588
[SPEAKER_12]: A spiritual remake, I guess.

345
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:36,590
[SPEAKER_12]: When I hear that though, I go, well if it's an original, I don't know if I want it.

346
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:37,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm gonna get it.

347
00:19:38,332 --> 00:19:39,472
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I know, I'm gonna get it too.

348
00:19:40,093 --> 00:19:44,036
[SPEAKER_12]: Heck, even if it was a remake of the first game, I'd probably get it, because I'm a consumer whore.

349
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:44,737
[SPEAKER_10]: And how.

350
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:47,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

351
00:19:47,908 --> 00:19:57,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, so funny that you mentioned remakes because the Sex Pistols are actually coming together to re-record Anarchy in the UK.

352
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,411
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course this is going to be for Guitar Hero 3.

353
00:20:01,472 --> 00:20:02,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Why should you care?

354
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:05,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's a pretty cool song.

355
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:07,993
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, they've come back together.

356
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:09,914
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's the Sex Pistols getting back together.

357
00:20:09,934 --> 00:20:10,374
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of cool.

358
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:10,634
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

359
00:20:10,674 --> 00:20:11,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

360
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:39,533
[SPEAKER_10]: and so apparently they're going to be reissuing Anarchy in the UK as well as part of the celebration they're going to be our Guitar Hero 3 is going to be sponsoring the band's performance at the London Brixton Academy on November 8th all in thanks to a video game well they're re-releasing it's kind of co-advertising here it's basically they're re-releasing their album Nevermind the Bollocks here's the Sex Pistols

361
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:46,305
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's coming out on the 29th, which is actually the day after Guitar Hero comes out over here.

362
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:48,686
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

363
00:20:48,886 --> 00:20:50,887
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why they decided to re-record it.

364
00:20:51,307 --> 00:20:55,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably because it's good press.

365
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:59,950
[SPEAKER_12]: Going to our chatroom, chat.orangehoundsradio.com, DarkTetsuya asks, wasn't that in Guitar Freaks at one point?

366
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,151
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, it was, but it was a shitty cover of it was in the game.

367
00:21:03,646 --> 00:21:07,027
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with tonight's FUs of the week?

368
00:21:07,107 --> 00:21:08,087
[SPEAKER_12]: Um... My FU of the week goes towards, um...

369
00:21:34,281 --> 00:21:35,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's actually going to go to work.

370
00:21:36,882 --> 00:21:37,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Just in general.

371
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:46,324
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually went and got my business license on Wednesday so that I can hopefully quit my job and get to working at a spa.

372
00:21:46,644 --> 00:21:47,364
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be so nice.

373
00:21:48,264 --> 00:21:54,726
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, it really, really just sort of made me realize how much more futile what I do is.

374
00:21:55,046 --> 00:21:56,686
[SPEAKER_07]: So, F you to work.

375
00:21:58,647 --> 00:21:58,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

376
00:22:00,307 --> 00:22:02,968
[SPEAKER_10]: After the bad drivers, I was commuting back from

377
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:10,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Oakland Today, and there are just some people out there that don't really follow any of the laws of the road.

378
00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:12,346
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, just weave in and out.

379
00:22:12,386 --> 00:22:19,008
[SPEAKER_10]: I watched a truck almost flip itself because it turned so tight, you know, trying to go between cars and stuff like that.

380
00:22:19,148 --> 00:22:30,812
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, there's just some people, and there's a guy with some riced up car or something that just decided, oh, I'm going to just cut through cars and stuff, no signal, no nothing, just

381
00:22:32,503 --> 00:22:33,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Try and kill people.

382
00:22:33,605 --> 00:22:34,968
[SPEAKER_10]: So, fuck them.

383
00:22:36,531 --> 00:22:37,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I'm gonna give an F you.

384
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:38,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry.

385
00:22:38,635 --> 00:22:39,035
[SPEAKER_10]: One more thing.

386
00:22:39,536 --> 00:22:45,067
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to the California Highway Patrol for stopping the freeway, you morons.

387
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:49,375
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, they do all these things to stop people from speeding.

388
00:22:49,475 --> 00:22:53,858
[SPEAKER_10]: So one of those things apparently is to stop traffic on the freeway completely.

389
00:22:54,318 --> 00:22:55,800
[SPEAKER_10]: All lanes at one time.

390
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that solves the problem.

391
00:22:58,261 --> 00:22:58,682
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it doesn't.

392
00:22:58,702 --> 00:22:59,883
[SPEAKER_10]: That causes more traffic.

393
00:22:59,923 --> 00:23:03,525
[SPEAKER_10]: People become late and they speed more, you stupid dumb fucks.

394
00:23:04,986 --> 00:23:05,307
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

395
00:23:06,087 --> 00:23:07,368
[SPEAKER_12]: That does seem like a little silly idea.

396
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:08,549
[SPEAKER_12]: Unless there's an axe in the head.

397
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:10,751
[SPEAKER_12]: No, they just... For no reason?

398
00:23:11,091 --> 00:23:11,912
[SPEAKER_10]: No reason.

399
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:13,092
[SPEAKER_10]: We're bored today.

400
00:23:13,112 --> 00:23:13,853
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's screw with traffic.

401
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:18,813
[SPEAKER_12]: My FU of the week goes to my ass.

402
00:23:20,034 --> 00:23:31,664
[SPEAKER_12]: Hear me out here for a minute, because I was a little bit intoxicated, and I slipped and I fell on this chest that's in my room, this little green, not a treasure chest, but a chest for clothes and stuff.

403
00:23:31,984 --> 00:23:38,409
[SPEAKER_12]: I slipped and I fell right on the corner of that, so my butt hit that corner, and now it's red and practically bruised.

404
00:23:38,689 --> 00:23:39,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw Rob's butt.

405
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:44,214
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I showed it to Jamie earlier, but only because I'm gay and she's a married woman, so it's okay.

406
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:45,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave Rob drugs.

407
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:50,918
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and she evaluated it and gave me some ibuprofen that was very strong.

408
00:23:50,938 --> 00:23:51,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you feel better?

409
00:23:51,838 --> 00:23:52,338
[SPEAKER_12]: I do, actually.

410
00:23:52,358 --> 00:23:53,118
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't feel it at all.

411
00:23:53,138 --> 00:23:54,219
[SPEAKER_12]: It's nice.

412
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:57,519
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it for the FUs of the Week.

413
00:23:58,679 --> 00:23:58,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Hooray.

414
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go back to some gaming news.

415
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,240
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, this is almost FU of the Week worthy.

416
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:07,341
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you know, I found this on Dig.

417
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:13,762
[SPEAKER_12]: There's this site, eBizMBA, that tracks the top 25 gaming sites on the Internet.

418
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,092
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio is nowhere to be found

419
00:24:27,906 --> 00:24:32,048
[SPEAKER_12]: DMN did the interview with a gal from Nintendo who got fired over her blog.

420
00:24:32,288 --> 00:24:36,270
[SPEAKER_12]: DMN actually interviewed her for their own show, STFU, which is on Thursdays on the station.

421
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:40,952
[SPEAKER_12]: We were going to rebroadcast it because it's kind of an in-the-news current thing that we thought you guys would be interested in.

422
00:24:41,232 --> 00:24:48,455
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently, their connection sucked and the audio quality wasn't worth it to try and bring it to you guys.

423
00:24:48,595 --> 00:24:50,336
[SPEAKER_12]: We made an editorial decision to cut it out.

424
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:54,278
[SPEAKER_12]: What about the guy that proposed over... I didn't hear back from him on MySpace.

425
00:24:54,358 --> 00:24:54,618
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

426
00:24:54,638 --> 00:24:55,298
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe he's listening.

427
00:24:55,678 --> 00:24:56,619
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll still have him on the show.

428
00:24:56,659 --> 00:24:56,979
[SPEAKER_12]: Call in.

429
00:24:57,628 --> 00:24:58,348
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

430
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:22,214
[SPEAKER_12]: The Quantcast monthly visitors.

431
00:25:22,234 --> 00:25:22,934
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even know what that is.

432
00:25:23,234 --> 00:25:25,795
[SPEAKER_12]: And the Alexa ranking, which, by the way, I think is bullshit.

433
00:25:25,855 --> 00:25:29,097
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you should not use... Oh, God, I fucking hate Alexa.

434
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:31,538
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like one of the biggest plagues on the internet.

435
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:32,618
[SPEAKER_12]: Who owns it?

436
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:33,819
[SPEAKER_12]: Like Amazon or some shit?

437
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:39,701
[SPEAKER_12]: All it is is a spyware bar that you basically have to install on your computer and it tracks what websites you visit.

438
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:47,225
[SPEAKER_12]: And they have the balls to release this ranking of the top sites based on who has this Alexa toolbar installed.

439
00:25:47,765 --> 00:25:48,045
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean...

440
00:25:48,891 --> 00:25:59,134
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not... I mean, like, because if you are anti-spyware, anti-toolbar, all this stuff, you probably visit different sites than people who get suckered to putting this stuff on their computer.

441
00:25:59,154 --> 00:26:00,815
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, I could just go off all day.

442
00:26:00,835 --> 00:26:08,918
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I... One of the things I hate about Wikipedia is that they use the Alexa ranking as some of their, like, is a site worthy to be on our page.

443
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:14,480
[SPEAKER_12]: Which, how we've managed to keep our article up on Wikipedia for so long, I'll never be able to figure that out.

444
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,001
[SPEAKER_12]: But thank you all to the listeners who made that.

445
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:18,381
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway...

446
00:26:19,685 --> 00:26:21,046
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I have my soapbox there.

447
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:21,846
[SPEAKER_12]: Top 25 sites.

448
00:26:21,906 --> 00:26:23,887
[SPEAKER_12]: Number one video game site, IGN.com.

449
00:26:24,487 --> 00:26:32,051
[SPEAKER_12]: Followed by GameSpot.com at number two, GameFacts.com at number three, GamesRadar.com at number four, which kind of surprised me.

450
00:26:32,371 --> 00:26:34,072
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd never really heard of it until a few months ago.

451
00:26:34,812 --> 00:26:44,177
[SPEAKER_12]: UGO.com at number five, GameSpy, CheatCC, Kotaku, Yahoo Video Games, and GameTap rounding out the top ten.

452
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:46,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Filefront is a gaming site.

453
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:49,165
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently Filefront is a gaming site, number 11.

454
00:26:49,225 --> 00:26:50,065
[SPEAKER_12]: Fileplanet.

455
00:26:52,606 --> 00:26:57,687
[SPEAKER_12]: Some other big blogs, 1UP, who does a bunch of podcasts, they're number 13 on the list.

456
00:26:58,807 --> 00:27:00,168
[SPEAKER_12]: Destructoid is number 20.

457
00:27:00,228 --> 00:27:01,888
[SPEAKER_12]: Joystick is number 19.

458
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:04,569
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's all I care to mention.

459
00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:06,849
[SPEAKER_10]: We're getting beat out by Strategy Informer.

460
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,610
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you know, life sucks sometimes.

461
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we don't have the budget.

462
00:27:11,711 --> 00:27:12,991
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet you all these people...

463
00:27:13,462 --> 00:27:15,343
[SPEAKER_10]: None of these are, of course, independent sites.

464
00:27:15,783 --> 00:27:17,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, maybe Kotaku, I guess.

465
00:27:17,364 --> 00:27:17,944
[SPEAKER_10]: And Joystick.

466
00:27:18,824 --> 00:27:19,505
[SPEAKER_10]: And Destructoid.

467
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:23,146
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to get into the politics of it all.

468
00:27:23,306 --> 00:27:27,388
[SPEAKER_12]: Anywho.

469
00:27:27,408 --> 00:27:29,209
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of the chat is asking, where's All Games?

470
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:31,890
[SPEAKER_12]: Nope, All Games didn't make the top 25 either.

471
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,731
[SPEAKER_12]: But All Games doesn't really do news.

472
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,232
[SPEAKER_12]: All Games is only shows.

473
00:27:35,252 --> 00:27:38,073
[SPEAKER_12]: I think if there were more to it, there might be more people going there.

474
00:27:38,113 --> 00:27:38,653
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe someday.

475
00:27:40,394 --> 00:27:42,695
[SPEAKER_10]: I trust that we're at the top of

476
00:27:43,465 --> 00:27:44,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Our favorite sites.

477
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:47,930
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's all it really gets.

478
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,572
[SPEAKER_10]: That's alright, we're just underground, yo.

479
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:51,074
[SPEAKER_12]: We're just underground.

480
00:27:51,114 --> 00:27:52,516
[SPEAKER_10]: We're way under the radar.

481
00:27:54,218 --> 00:27:55,759
[SPEAKER_10]: We're like... We're like underground.

482
00:27:56,981 --> 00:27:57,261
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

483
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:57,982
[SPEAKER_10]: In a bomb shelter.

484
00:27:58,483 --> 00:27:58,903
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

485
00:27:59,183 --> 00:28:00,385
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not in a bomb shelter.

486
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:02,127
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in the land of awesome.

487
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:17,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, speaking of something that could be awesome, but I sincerely doubt it, is that there is a rumor about a Mortal Kombat game that will feature characters from the DC Universe trying to do a versus type of thing.

488
00:28:18,525 --> 00:28:21,767
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, I don't know how I feel about that.

489
00:28:21,887 --> 00:28:23,807
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I feel that it's going to be kind of dumb.

490
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:25,228
[SPEAKER_10]: What is that?

491
00:28:25,388 --> 00:28:27,909
[SPEAKER_10]: A ramp I see there and a tank with sharks.

492
00:28:28,989 --> 00:28:30,129
[SPEAKER_10]: What's going to happen soon?

493
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:31,490
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder.

494
00:28:32,298 --> 00:28:33,199
[SPEAKER_07]: DC vs. Mortal Kombat DC vs. Mortal Kombat

495
00:28:51,326 --> 00:28:53,948
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, this reeks of fanboyism to me.

496
00:28:54,008 --> 00:28:54,609
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even think it's true.

497
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:57,591
[SPEAKER_07]: The difference between Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter is that Street Fighter is a good game.

498
00:28:58,352 --> 00:28:59,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Mortal Kombat's fun.

499
00:28:59,953 --> 00:29:02,355
[SPEAKER_10]: The next game that they're going to do is going to be a versus game.

500
00:29:02,935 --> 00:29:04,436
[SPEAKER_10]: They never said it was versus DC.

501
00:29:06,518 --> 00:29:07,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Although that would make sense.

502
00:29:07,439 --> 00:29:11,462
[SPEAKER_10]: To be honest, I think the Mortal Kombat series, DC, I don't think would go for it if you think about it.

503
00:29:11,622 --> 00:29:17,507
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, granted, I think DC versus Street Fighter makes sense because it's more comic book-y and stuff.

504
00:29:18,027 --> 00:29:19,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Mortal Kombat is just kind of violent.

505
00:29:20,646 --> 00:29:20,926
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

506
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:22,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, maybe they're going to change Mortal Kombat's image.

507
00:29:22,587 --> 00:29:31,750
[SPEAKER_10]: They should be like Mortal Kombat versus Monsters of Horror or something like that, where they have Freddy and Jason and shit like that.

508
00:29:32,431 --> 00:29:35,292
[SPEAKER_12]: You know why I like the Mortal Kombat games, especially the more recent one?

509
00:29:35,372 --> 00:29:41,254
[SPEAKER_12]: I like them because they have more than just the fighting game stuff in them, like the kart thing, the adventure modes.

510
00:29:41,494 --> 00:29:44,035
[SPEAKER_12]: The games have quite a bit of depth.

511
00:29:44,255 --> 00:29:44,556
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

512
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,217
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they're not like OMG, drop everything.

513
00:29:47,237 --> 00:29:49,658
[SPEAKER_12]: They're no Soul Calibur 2, that's for sure, but they're fun.

514
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:51,703
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

515
00:29:52,504 --> 00:29:54,224
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you guys are being too hard on Mortal Kombat.

516
00:29:54,345 --> 00:29:54,705
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fun.

517
00:29:55,105 --> 00:29:55,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

518
00:29:56,145 --> 00:29:57,126
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys are just tough to please.

519
00:29:57,846 --> 00:29:58,907
[SPEAKER_10]: I am tough to please.

520
00:29:59,447 --> 00:30:03,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, one game though that I do like is Saints Row.

521
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:07,371
[SPEAKER_10]: And Saints Row 2 has been confirmed for PlayStation 3 and the 360.

522
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:10,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the changes coming with the brand new version of the game.

523
00:30:11,373 --> 00:30:17,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, it's going to bring back Stillwater as well as including some improvements.

524
00:30:17,509 --> 00:30:28,257
[SPEAKER_10]: to the online game, both the online co-op now being added and multiplayer, open world multiplayer matches, so that's kind of cool.

525
00:30:28,698 --> 00:30:37,384
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, don't get me wrong, the multiplayer is okay, but I kind of wish that it was open world, like Grand Theft Auto on the PSP and stuff like that.

526
00:30:38,205 --> 00:30:45,050
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, after a while, those three maps that you have for deathmatch really get old, so...

527
00:30:47,332 --> 00:30:47,812
[SPEAKER_10]: DanceOnline.com

528
00:31:08,815 --> 00:31:14,778
[SPEAKER_12]: Dance Online is that dancing MMO that was created by David Perry, who also made Earthworm Jim.

529
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:18,240
[SPEAKER_12]: I played it a long time ago, and I wasn't that impressed with it.

530
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:30,467
[SPEAKER_12]: It didn't have a lot of songs that really grabbed me, but now I've got to go back and take a look because Dance Online has gotten some updates, and they have apparently made some type of agreement with Warner Brothers Records or Warner Music.

531
00:31:31,107 --> 00:31:32,268
[SPEAKER_12]: There are now songs from...

532
00:31:32,888 --> 00:31:40,372
[SPEAKER_12]: Ashley Tisdale, The Ramones, The Click 5, 30 Songs from Warner Music, also in the game now, Paris Hilton.

533
00:31:40,952 --> 00:31:41,652
[SPEAKER_12]: You know you wanna.

534
00:31:41,872 --> 00:31:42,252
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

535
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:43,213
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I don't.

536
00:31:43,633 --> 00:31:44,654
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

537
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:45,274
[SPEAKER_07]: You know you wanna.

538
00:31:45,434 --> 00:31:49,416
[SPEAKER_12]: Also added more items to the shop for more customization.

539
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,537
[SPEAKER_12]: Over 150 hairstyles.

540
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,078
[SPEAKER_12]: And apparently the game has also added

541
00:31:54,482 --> 00:31:55,702
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkTetsuya says, pass.

542
00:32:24,215 --> 00:32:26,379
[SPEAKER_12]: MrDeBucket says, David Perry for the lose.

543
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:27,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Ouch.

544
00:32:28,021 --> 00:32:30,746
[SPEAKER_12]: ShadowCharlie says, play Supernova 2 for Ashley Tisdale.

545
00:32:31,387 --> 00:32:34,291
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, a sad time or a sad sign that things are changing.

546
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:37,797
[SPEAKER_12]: You know how like our show started off like, you know, because we met all playing DDR.

547
00:32:37,817 --> 00:32:38,939
[SPEAKER_12]: We were all about the DDR.

548
00:32:39,377 --> 00:32:39,837
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

549
00:32:59,947 --> 00:33:06,892
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't want to buy... Well, first off, I'm not buying DDR Haas Party unless I get it for free.

550
00:33:07,332 --> 00:33:10,094
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Supernova 2, I listened to the music.

551
00:33:10,795 --> 00:33:12,876
[SPEAKER_10]: I was disappointed with the Trip Machine remix.

552
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:13,857
[SPEAKER_10]: It was crap.

553
00:33:14,498 --> 00:33:14,718
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

554
00:33:17,389 --> 00:33:19,650
[SPEAKER_10]: And then... Is that your official review?

555
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:22,311
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

556
00:33:22,431 --> 00:33:24,612
[SPEAKER_10]: I did like the Fascination Max remix, though.

557
00:33:24,972 --> 00:33:28,413
[SPEAKER_10]: It reminded me a lot of Healing Vision and then Healing Vision Angelic.

558
00:33:28,513 --> 00:33:31,074
[SPEAKER_10]: That kind of remix of it.

559
00:33:31,514 --> 00:33:36,596
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I didn't... Some of the songs, though, they didn't have ripped from it, though.

560
00:33:36,676 --> 00:33:38,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Like Volcano, I didn't get to hear.

561
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,017
[SPEAKER_10]: But some of the other ones were okay.

562
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:41,458
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, though...

563
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:43,388
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll have to try it.

564
00:33:43,848 --> 00:33:47,410
[SPEAKER_10]: I want an actual machine to be out here, though, instead of having to play it on the PlayStation 2.

565
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,890
[SPEAKER_10]: But hopefully I'll get to play it soon.

566
00:33:51,251 --> 00:33:54,852
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, well, one thing we're going to get to do very soon is open up the mailbag.

567
00:33:55,152 --> 00:34:01,114
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right, you guys email us every week at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and we read some of our favorites here on the program.

568
00:34:01,555 --> 00:34:05,716
[SPEAKER_12]: So, DarkSakura, jump in the mailbag, pull out some letters, let's see what we got.

569
00:34:09,037 --> 00:34:10,298
[SPEAKER_07]: First email.

570
00:34:10,598 --> 00:34:11,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Dun-dun-dun!

571
00:34:12,281 --> 00:34:17,804
[SPEAKER_07]: It comes from, uh... Well, you didn't give a nickname, so I'm just gonna say Aaron.

572
00:34:18,305 --> 00:34:20,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, first of all, I want to say I love the show.

573
00:34:20,086 --> 00:34:22,747
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the only podcast I listen to that doesn't ever bore me.

574
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,149
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny, entertaining, and informative.

575
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,990
[SPEAKER_07]: As for Rob's comments about Facebook, I totally agree.

576
00:34:28,391 --> 00:34:34,154
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so annoying to log in and have, like, five invitations for apps that you don't care about.

577
00:34:34,594 --> 00:34:38,056
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that it's as bad as MySpace, but I do think Facebook is headed in that direction.

578
00:34:38,537 --> 00:34:39,197
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not alone.

579
00:34:39,297 --> 00:34:40,678
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a Facebook, too, and I...

580
00:34:41,735 --> 00:34:42,215
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate it.

581
00:34:43,316 --> 00:34:48,080
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I do kind of like getting the notifications on my phone sometimes, but that shit gets old.

582
00:34:49,141 --> 00:34:50,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, to continue.

583
00:34:51,162 --> 00:34:52,744
[SPEAKER_07]: I also have a few comments on Halo 3.

584
00:34:53,104 --> 00:34:53,985
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the first game.

585
00:34:54,045 --> 00:34:55,326
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the reason I bought an Xbox.

586
00:34:55,806 --> 00:35:01,711
[SPEAKER_07]: I was disappointed in Halo 2, and not long after Halo 2, I stopped telling people that I played it because I didn't want them to think I was a stupid frat boy.

587
00:35:06,574 --> 00:35:07,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, that was gross.

588
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:12,274
[SPEAKER_07]: I eventually stopped playing Halo 2 with anyone I didn't know because of the ignorant people on Xbox Live.

589
00:35:12,894 --> 00:35:17,816
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm excited for Halo 3, but I won't be going to the midnight release because of the people that will be there.

590
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:28,918
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the Halo series started out well and the games are still solid, but the atmosphere surrounding the games has dissolved into one blatant commercialism and poor sportsmanship, for lack of a better word.

591
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:29,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Love this show, guys.

592
00:35:29,999 --> 00:35:30,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep it up.

593
00:35:30,539 --> 00:35:30,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Erin.

594
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:37,152
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I seem to remember we were talking about last week, you know, who's actually going to the midnight release.

595
00:35:37,532 --> 00:35:39,412
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we hear from anyone who actually went?

596
00:35:39,752 --> 00:35:41,073
[SPEAKER_12]: This guy said he wanted to go.

597
00:35:42,193 --> 00:35:43,734
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

598
00:35:46,214 --> 00:35:48,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, shall I move forward to the next one, Rob?

599
00:35:48,655 --> 00:35:50,816
[SPEAKER_07]: You may.

600
00:35:50,856 --> 00:35:51,576
[SPEAKER_07]: OLR Dudes and Chicks.

601
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm playing Worms 2 Open Warfare on my PSP-2000.

602
00:35:55,399 --> 00:35:55,940
[SPEAKER_07]: T-A-R-D is TARD

603
00:36:20,202 --> 00:36:23,983
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, TARD is slang for retard, which is a naughty word.

604
00:36:24,003 --> 00:36:28,764
[SPEAKER_10]: They also censored death, because I had a team death something.

605
00:36:28,784 --> 00:36:30,085
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you play this online?

606
00:36:30,945 --> 00:36:31,045
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

607
00:36:31,485 --> 00:36:33,606
[SPEAKER_12]: You can play it on Wi-Fi.

608
00:36:33,686 --> 00:36:35,306
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, then why bother censoring it?

609
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,767
[SPEAKER_12]: The person's got to be in the room with you.

610
00:36:37,867 --> 00:36:38,367
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't get it.

611
00:36:38,847 --> 00:36:39,708
[SPEAKER_12]: That's overdoing it.

612
00:36:39,748 --> 00:36:40,308
[SPEAKER_12]: That's from Dark Raven.

613
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,188
[SPEAKER_12]: That's overdoing it.

614
00:36:41,868 --> 00:36:47,510
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it's being censored because I guess TARD is a bad word, and so anything with that in it, you know...

615
00:36:48,226 --> 00:36:49,007
[SPEAKER_12]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

616
00:37:19,122 --> 00:37:22,704
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to say how great a birthday present it would be if it ended up happening.

617
00:37:49,819 --> 00:37:52,640
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's take a minute to talk about Galaxy Wars Cats.

618
00:37:55,402 --> 00:37:59,023
[SPEAKER_12]: Genius Marketing Campaign, those folks at Geometry Wars Galaxy.

619
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,623
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you seen the site, gwgcats.com?

620
00:38:02,303 --> 00:38:06,684
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody's taken the lolcats trend and made an advertising campaign out of it.

621
00:38:07,524 --> 00:38:12,865
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the advertising campaign for Geometry Wars Galaxies is brilliant because you can even watch the commercial.

622
00:38:12,905 --> 00:38:13,425
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, wait, hold on.

623
00:38:13,445 --> 00:38:14,206
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to go to the site.

624
00:38:14,746 --> 00:38:15,066
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

625
00:38:15,106 --> 00:38:17,646
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care if I sound like a consumer whore, but you know what?

626
00:38:17,846 --> 00:38:21,407
[SPEAKER_12]: I've seen so many lame video game commercials, and you might think this is lame.

627
00:38:22,489 --> 00:38:23,009
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't care.

628
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:23,609
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's funny.

629
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,110
[SPEAKER_12]: They have this in theaters.

630
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:26,890
[SPEAKER_12]: This is so great.

631
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:32,531
[SPEAKER_12]: There's Geometry Wars and they have all these things like, I'm in your solar system on top of your leaderboards.

632
00:38:32,991 --> 00:38:36,252
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm in your battle grids topping your highest score and just all this funny stuff.

633
00:38:36,592 --> 00:38:46,094
[SPEAKER_12]: But then if you actually go to the website for Geometry Wars Galaxies, the little trailer for the game has a remake of Particle Man, which is so awesome.

634
00:38:46,704 --> 00:38:49,406
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on, I gotta play a little clip of the song from the trailer.

635
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:52,168
[SPEAKER_12]: This is from geometrywarsgalaxies.com slash US.

636
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:56,731
[SPEAKER_12]: Particle man, particle man, doing the things a particle can.

637
00:38:57,132 --> 00:38:58,052
[SPEAKER_11]: What's he like?

638
00:38:58,192 --> 00:38:59,453
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not important.

639
00:38:59,674 --> 00:39:03,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Particle man, is he a dot or is he a speck?

640
00:39:03,376 --> 00:39:05,618
[SPEAKER_11]: When he's underwater, does he get wet?

641
00:39:05,978 --> 00:39:08,200
[SPEAKER_12]: Or does the water get him instead?

642
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:08,880
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause get it?

643
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,183
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause it's like triangle man and I don't know, it's funny.

644
00:39:13,024 --> 00:39:13,624
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

645
00:39:13,925 --> 00:39:14,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that They Might Be Giants?

646
00:39:15,305 --> 00:39:17,627
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it's like... Oh, unless they redid the song.

647
00:39:17,667 --> 00:39:18,768
[SPEAKER_12]: It's definitely not the original.

648
00:39:19,128 --> 00:39:22,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, I was going to say, because the voice was kind of... A little bit.

649
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:22,870
[SPEAKER_12]: Could have been.

650
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:23,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

651
00:39:24,711 --> 00:39:25,171
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

652
00:39:25,612 --> 00:39:25,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Love it.

653
00:39:26,692 --> 00:39:29,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then the next email, then, if you are ready...

654
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:38,175
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, real quickly, I just want to say, Black Wolf, of course, our old buddy Bobby B is in chat right now, and he does his own show, of course, on all games.

655
00:39:38,195 --> 00:39:43,278
[SPEAKER_12]: It also airs on Sunday nights, and sometimes when he's done with his show, he'll come listen to ours for a little bit because he's awesome.

656
00:39:43,778 --> 00:39:47,961
[SPEAKER_12]: And he says, oh, man, that email was a mass email to a lot of podcasts.

657
00:39:47,981 --> 00:39:51,002
[SPEAKER_12]: I think he said that about the last email, the one about the worms, too.

658
00:39:51,703 --> 00:39:54,724
[SPEAKER_12]: So somebody is, like, mass emailing podcasts with the same question.

659
00:39:55,205 --> 00:39:55,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Amazing.

660
00:39:56,505 --> 00:39:57,306
[SPEAKER_12]: We got spammed.

661
00:39:58,641 --> 00:40:02,724
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder if they're trying to see if the different podcasts give different answers, if it's some type of survey.

662
00:40:03,385 --> 00:40:08,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Well then, I wonder if they're spamming all the podcasts about whether their penis needs to be larger too.

663
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:16,475
[SPEAKER_12]: Or maybe they're trying to spam all the podcasts with a Worms 2 email so people will actually talk about Worms 2 on the podcast.

664
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:18,737
[SPEAKER_12]: We just bought it, hook, line, and sinker.

665
00:40:18,977 --> 00:40:22,800
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a bunch of people who think that I need a bigger penis too, apparently in my email.

666
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,562
[SPEAKER_07]: So we actually deleted my email address.

667
00:40:26,543 --> 00:40:27,904
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it'll work, but good luck.

668
00:40:28,277 --> 00:40:28,717
[SPEAKER_12]: You never know.

669
00:40:28,977 --> 00:40:34,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if they get them back, then they have auto-delete things or some shit.

670
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:36,260
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually thinking about changing it anyway.

671
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:36,640
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

672
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,180
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

673
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,641
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, next email now, please, please, please, please.

674
00:40:40,681 --> 00:40:41,241
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, yes, yes.

675
00:40:41,321 --> 00:40:42,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I has email, Rob?

676
00:40:42,762 --> 00:40:43,862
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, you can has email.

677
00:40:44,716 --> 00:40:47,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Last episode, Loki said, nothing is original anymore.

678
00:40:48,021 --> 00:40:49,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Originality is hard to find.

679
00:40:49,723 --> 00:40:55,671
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my favorite quotes is from one of my design teachers is, you are only as original as your sources are obscure.

680
00:40:56,232 --> 00:40:57,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Games are the same as design.

681
00:40:57,674 --> 00:40:58,515
[SPEAKER_07]: I do agree with that.

682
00:41:00,177 --> 00:41:01,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk about a reward for good gaming.

683
00:41:28,846 --> 00:41:31,467
[SPEAKER_07]: or the end for Final Fantasy 2 in the US.

684
00:41:31,507 --> 00:41:32,928
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Final Fantasy 4 overseas.

685
00:41:33,608 --> 00:41:35,709
[SPEAKER_07]: The page turning with the great music, it was incredible.

686
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:38,490
[SPEAKER_07]: I sat and smiled contentedly for a good half an hour.

687
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:43,491
[SPEAKER_07]: I can actually say the same thing about Final Fantasy 6, well 3 over here when it came out.

688
00:41:43,992 --> 00:41:50,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that I actually finally decided to wait and be patient and wait for Shadow to catch up with you so that he doesn't die.

689
00:41:51,174 --> 00:41:51,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Spoiler!

690
00:41:52,595 --> 00:41:54,275
[SPEAKER_07]: And got the ending with everybody alive.

691
00:41:54,295 --> 00:41:55,656
[SPEAKER_07]: And that made me happy.

692
00:41:56,966 --> 00:41:58,346
[SPEAKER_07]: and even retarded Gogo.

693
00:42:19,525 --> 00:42:20,285
[SPEAKER_07]: The Stupid Mimic

694
00:42:49,556 --> 00:42:50,276
[SPEAKER_12]: It was weird.

695
00:42:51,977 --> 00:42:54,398
[SPEAKER_07]: At any rate, now I look for these things.

696
00:42:54,518 --> 00:42:57,239
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to care about my characters on normal story-based games.

697
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:58,900
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not always easy to find.

698
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:09,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I get by these days with a good triple Windfury crit on any gnome anywhere, or seriously just killing anything alliance, but that kind of quick fix can't replace the more in-depth stuff.

699
00:43:10,124 --> 00:43:14,465
[SPEAKER_07]: What are some of the moments that got you guys all teary-eyed or made you jump like an idiot?

700
00:43:15,406 --> 00:43:16,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it for the gamers.

701
00:43:17,071 --> 00:43:21,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Spelled G-A-Y-M-E-R-S Apparently Seattle is the gamer mecca Really?

702
00:43:21,174 --> 00:43:44,371
[SPEAKER_12]: And that comes from No Soul Boy I knew there was a reason I liked Seattle No, uh Let's see, games that got me Well, okay, games that got me a jump would be Silent Hill Like any of them Games that got me all Well, I actually Cared when Eris died in Final Fantasy 7 I cheered You're a bitch I'm not a bitch, I hated her the entire fucking game

703
00:43:45,427 --> 00:43:48,750
[SPEAKER_07]: and oh my god, I hated her and I was so happy when she died.

704
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:49,911
[SPEAKER_12]: I got a little choked.

705
00:43:49,971 --> 00:43:51,812
[SPEAKER_12]: I got verklempt when that happened.

706
00:43:52,913 --> 00:43:55,475
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I got a little verklempt playing Eternal Sonata the other day.

707
00:43:55,495 --> 00:43:57,376
[SPEAKER_12]: That game is sad.

708
00:43:57,476 --> 00:43:59,678
[SPEAKER_12]: It's about all these dying kids and stuff.

709
00:43:59,758 --> 00:44:00,278
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of sad.

710
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:08,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I laughed my ass off during the bitch slap fight in Final Fantasy VII between Scarlet and Tifa and...

711
00:44:09,634 --> 00:44:12,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh God, there was a game, though, that made me completely freaking bawl.

712
00:44:14,059 --> 00:44:16,442
[SPEAKER_07]: And I couldn't remember what it was, because it was a few years ago.

713
00:44:18,204 --> 00:44:27,615
[SPEAKER_07]: I do know one game that completely cracked me up, and that was... Now, crap, I can't remember the name of it, but it had the girl with the red pigtails, and she used a...

714
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:34,295
[SPEAKER_07]: The Rings, The Chakram for her weapons, and you could play as either the girl or the boy.

715
00:44:34,835 --> 00:44:40,218
[SPEAKER_07]: And it had a really cool name in Japan, and then it came out with, like, Winds of Fate in the U.S.

716
00:44:41,238 --> 00:44:45,220
[SPEAKER_07]: But that game had lots of crack me up bunny moments, because she was just over the top.

717
00:44:47,201 --> 00:44:49,922
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember the game that made me freaking bawl like a baby, though.

718
00:44:51,623 --> 00:44:54,184
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, like, people dying in the game.

719
00:44:54,305 --> 00:44:55,145
[SPEAKER_12]: Mario is Missing.

720
00:44:56,051 --> 00:44:57,754
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe he's missing!

721
00:44:57,934 --> 00:44:59,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe I'm playing this game!

722
00:44:59,557 --> 00:45:00,599
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't find him!

723
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:01,119
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so mad!

724
00:45:09,908 --> 00:45:13,089
[SPEAKER_07]: People go to YouTube and look up Asshole Mario.

725
00:45:13,189 --> 00:45:14,489
[SPEAKER_12]: That's some talent.

726
00:45:14,529 --> 00:45:15,910
[SPEAKER_12]: I love Asshole Mario.

727
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:23,472
[SPEAKER_07]: It's people who what they did is took Super Mario Brothers and did ROM hacks with it to make these intensely hard levels.

728
00:45:23,812 --> 00:45:26,993
[SPEAKER_07]: And the thing about these hard levels is that they are not unplayable.

729
00:45:27,702 --> 00:45:29,083
[SPEAKER_07]: You can beat them.

730
00:45:29,303 --> 00:45:33,466
[SPEAKER_07]: But you have to have the mad skills to do it.

731
00:45:33,966 --> 00:45:36,048
[SPEAKER_07]: And time and patience and be willing to die.

732
00:45:36,248 --> 00:45:44,113
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing that's annoying about the Asshole Mario levels is that they keep showing people dying over and over and over again.

733
00:45:44,653 --> 00:45:49,116
[SPEAKER_07]: And what they should do is just show someone playing through the level and then show them dying.

734
00:45:50,017 --> 00:45:56,501
[SPEAKER_12]: My favorite was how they showed just the very start of the game and the very first level the guy goes into.

735
00:45:57,031 --> 00:45:58,612
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

736
00:46:26,866 --> 00:46:28,327
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like an invisible coin block.

737
00:46:29,127 --> 00:46:30,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, back to the email, shall I?

738
00:46:30,608 --> 00:46:30,828
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

739
00:46:31,608 --> 00:46:32,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

740
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:35,270
[SPEAKER_07]: This is addressed to me, and then you guys in parentheses.

741
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:38,132
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Rob with 2Bs, by the way.

742
00:46:38,252 --> 00:46:38,752
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's it from?

743
00:46:39,412 --> 00:46:40,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I just told you, Rob.

744
00:46:40,513 --> 00:46:41,553
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, hi, Rob and 2Bs.

745
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:47,136
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a little war of words going on between a site called GameTwat.

746
00:46:47,976 --> 00:46:48,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's great.

747
00:46:49,437 --> 00:46:51,958
[SPEAKER_07]: It just gets funnier each time you think slash say it.

748
00:46:52,579 --> 00:46:55,320
[SPEAKER_07]: And GamePolitics, as well as GP versus JackiePoo.

749
00:46:56,075 --> 00:46:58,197
[SPEAKER_07]: GameCock is a publisher, or a developer?

750
00:46:58,217 --> 00:46:58,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Developer.

751
00:46:58,457 --> 00:46:58,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Developer.

752
00:47:20,635 --> 00:47:26,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I think people need to lighten up and realize how we secretly enjoy the antics between Jackie Poo and GP Butting Heads.

753
00:47:26,578 --> 00:47:28,158
[SPEAKER_07]: GT is funny if you let it.

754
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:37,262
[SPEAKER_07]: I personally believe that porn court filing story on Jackie Poo was his attempt to show the judge was biased against him in the case versus the Florida Bar.

755
00:47:37,643 --> 00:47:40,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Mission accomplished, but now the legal system is against him.

756
00:47:40,984 --> 00:47:45,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry for the misquote, but if you strike Jackie Poo down, he'll become stronger than ever.

757
00:47:46,812 --> 00:47:51,397
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd rather we adopt a meh attitude and maybe he'll start eating crayons as recreational drugs.

758
00:47:52,097 --> 00:47:52,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Raw bubba.

759
00:47:53,098 --> 00:47:54,320
[SPEAKER_07]: And he wrote bubba afterwards.

760
00:48:00,225 --> 00:48:02,348
[SPEAKER_12]: This GameTwat site looks like Perez Hilton.

761
00:48:05,311 --> 00:48:07,833
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awfully pink and that joystick looks like a cock.

762
00:48:08,494 --> 00:48:08,594
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

763
00:48:10,586 --> 00:48:12,287
[SPEAKER_12]: BlackWolf in chat says something interesting.

764
00:48:12,327 --> 00:48:15,569
[SPEAKER_12]: He says, wow, GameTwat is getting really too much publicity over this.

765
00:48:15,909 --> 00:48:17,350
[SPEAKER_12]: So what's the debate?

766
00:48:18,091 --> 00:48:19,692
[SPEAKER_12]: What are they mad at each other about?

767
00:48:20,592 --> 00:48:21,072
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't get it.

768
00:48:24,475 --> 00:48:27,496
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on, I'm trying to figure this out, because GameTwat interviewed him.

769
00:48:27,717 --> 00:48:30,538
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't believe he would have interviewed with a site called GameTwat.

770
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:32,860
[SPEAKER_12]: What the hell?

771
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,501
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, we're with GameTwat, we want to interview you.

772
00:48:37,803 --> 00:48:39,704
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever, I don't want to get involved in the drama.

773
00:48:41,024 --> 00:48:42,605
[SPEAKER_12]: It's more publicity for both sites.

774
00:48:42,705 --> 00:48:43,926
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we just reported on it.

775
00:48:43,966 --> 00:48:45,287
[SPEAKER_12]: Congratulations to both sites.

776
00:48:45,848 --> 00:48:47,409
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to start a fight with somebody.

777
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:49,070
[SPEAKER_12]: Who can we start a fight with?

778
00:48:49,111 --> 00:48:49,891
[SPEAKER_12]: How about all games?

779
00:48:50,432 --> 00:48:52,133
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that's too obvious.

780
00:48:52,153 --> 00:48:52,914
[SPEAKER_07]: How about Bobby?

781
00:48:52,934 --> 00:48:53,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby, we're going to start a fight with you.

782
00:48:53,974 --> 00:48:54,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that okay?

783
00:48:54,275 --> 00:48:55,215
[SPEAKER_12]: That's too obvious.

784
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,837
[SPEAKER_10]: It's too obvious if we start a fight with somebody.

785
00:48:56,857 --> 00:48:59,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll start a fight with you when it makes sense.

786
00:48:59,659 --> 00:49:02,201
[SPEAKER_10]: What about the developer of the Eye of Judgment?

787
00:49:03,627 --> 00:49:07,569
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to make a correction to that rather formal review of Earth Defense Forces sent in last week.

788
00:49:07,609 --> 00:49:10,491
[SPEAKER_12]: There are more enemy types than just ants in the game but it turns out they're the best.

789
00:49:32,538 --> 00:49:38,762
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, having played Metal Slug Anthology this week, I agree with Loki that every Metal Slug game is exactly the same, even if they are really fun.

790
00:49:38,822 --> 00:49:41,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Enemies, weapons, and even goddamn mini-bosses are repeated.

791
00:49:43,124 --> 00:49:44,025
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, so.

792
00:49:44,665 --> 00:49:47,146
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get turned into undead in the later ones.

793
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:51,809
[SPEAKER_07]: To continue, last one.

794
00:49:52,309 --> 00:49:53,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Dun-dun-dun.

795
00:49:54,931 --> 00:49:57,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, OLR people, this is Maury again.

796
00:49:58,406 --> 00:50:15,788
[SPEAKER_07]: earlier this week I was able to get a Wii with money from various sources and so far I've been enjoying it immensely my house has been lacking in a home version of DDR for quite some time so I splurged and picked up the new DDR hottest party bundle that came out Tuesday I think anywho the game's in a nutshell excellent

797
00:50:16,635 --> 00:50:18,876
[SPEAKER_07]: It's easily the best DDR home version in a while.

798
00:50:19,236 --> 00:50:25,197
[SPEAKER_07]: The song list is a tad shorter than the average game by about 50 total, but most of those songs are actually fun to play.

799
00:50:25,257 --> 00:50:26,958
[SPEAKER_07]: About half of it consists of licenses.

800
00:50:27,038 --> 00:50:30,999
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all covers, but they range in quality from good to questionable.

801
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:34,480
[SPEAKER_07]: For some reason, the 80s ones tend to be the most fun.

802
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:37,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Blue Monday by New Order is the first one that comes to mind.

803
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,161
[SPEAKER_07]: The original songs in the game are pretty awesome, too.

804
00:50:41,001 --> 00:50:44,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Furthermore, whoever did the step charts for this game needs to stay around forever.

805
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,301
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a wide range of difficulty.

806
00:50:47,861 --> 00:50:52,702
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple of genuine 10-footers in the other charts are fun without being mind-numbingly boring.

807
00:50:53,382 --> 00:51:00,684
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wii remote motions are kind of hard to get the hang of, though, and the game doesn't give you any advice besides swinging the controller.

808
00:51:01,285 --> 00:51:06,086
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as I can tell, the best way to do it is to hold the remote and nunchuck in front of you vertically and swing them forward.

809
00:51:06,917 --> 00:51:09,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and the new Love Shine remix is rad.

810
00:51:10,042 --> 00:51:11,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally, a quick question.

811
00:51:11,324 --> 00:51:13,087
[SPEAKER_07]: What other Wii games are good at the moment?

812
00:51:13,147 --> 00:51:14,068
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm into quirky stuff.

813
00:51:14,168 --> 00:51:14,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheers, Mori.

814
00:51:17,453 --> 00:51:18,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I still love Trauma Center.

815
00:51:19,016 --> 00:51:21,660
[SPEAKER_10]: If you really want quirky, escape from Bug Island.

816
00:51:23,365 --> 00:51:24,446
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

817
00:51:53,615 --> 00:52:16,503
[SPEAKER_12]: The possible fight between OLR and Blackwolf He says, we tried to fight However, Loki refused to play Chromehounds So I won by default Dude, it was like me and some other person I think I already sold my copy back GS68 says also that we should be fighting with Bobby Blackwolf See, that doesn't work Mr. DeBucket suggests that we should have a fight with Tekken Games

818
00:52:17,751 --> 00:52:19,431
[SPEAKER_12]: BlackWolf suggested that we fight one up.

819
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:45,627
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm like, I'll fight him with a cricket bat.

820
00:52:45,647 --> 00:52:47,708
[SPEAKER_12]: That fight's so 2006.

821
00:52:48,389 --> 00:52:49,869
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm over my issues with 1UP.

822
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:51,610
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm over my issues.

823
00:52:54,311 --> 00:52:54,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

824
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:58,053
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess so we can't fight anybody, so we have to love everybody.

825
00:52:58,953 --> 00:53:00,294
[SPEAKER_12]: Hugs and kisses all around.

826
00:53:01,074 --> 00:53:01,954
[SPEAKER_12]: We love everyone.

827
00:53:03,695 --> 00:53:06,936
[SPEAKER_10]: The Nintendo Wii online development staff, how about that?

828
00:53:06,956 --> 00:53:08,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's fight them.

829
00:53:08,553 --> 00:53:13,136
[SPEAKER_12]: No, but we need a good fight, like a really good bang-up fight that people will report on.

830
00:53:13,196 --> 00:53:17,118
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's like, you know, OLR threatened to kill somebody's family or something.

831
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:17,939
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

832
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Can't threaten to kill families.

833
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,101
[SPEAKER_10]: That's illegal.

834
00:53:22,221 --> 00:53:23,742
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, it is illegal.

835
00:53:24,763 --> 00:53:25,403
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

836
00:53:26,584 --> 00:53:29,346
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to get some really good dirt on somebody and start a fight with them.

837
00:53:29,886 --> 00:53:30,827
[SPEAKER_12]: Be good for publicity.

838
00:53:31,447 --> 00:53:32,408
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you work on that, Loki?

839
00:53:32,448 --> 00:53:34,249
[SPEAKER_12]: You have ties in dark places.

840
00:53:34,389 --> 00:53:36,350
[SPEAKER_12]: Get some dirt on another cast.

841
00:53:38,407 --> 00:53:38,927
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, anyway.

842
00:53:39,227 --> 00:53:43,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, don't you know, I'm just like the fucking sleuth.

843
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:44,530
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, then get some news.

844
00:53:45,971 --> 00:53:46,411
[SPEAKER_10]: God.

845
00:53:46,671 --> 00:53:55,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, so, you know, when I'm not digging up dirt, apparently, we're going to be talking about Square Enix, and they're focusing on overseas.

846
00:53:57,497 --> 00:53:59,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's a surprise.

847
00:54:00,558 --> 00:54:03,480
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess, you know, of course, since they're only known, well...

848
00:54:04,096 --> 00:54:07,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Square Enix is mainly known for the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest series.

849
00:54:07,357 --> 00:54:10,958
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of other stuff that they used to do, unfortunately, never saw remixes.

850
00:54:11,618 --> 00:54:12,738
[SPEAKER_10]: I really want Einhander.

851
00:54:13,298 --> 00:54:24,501
[SPEAKER_10]: But now apparently they're going to be focusing on overseas markets that have increased more than three times the size of the Japanese market.

852
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:25,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank God!

853
00:54:26,101 --> 00:54:30,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe that means we'll actually get Final Fantasy XIII in a timely manner.

854
00:54:31,325 --> 00:54:34,887
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're having to wait for Japan to get it and then us getting it way afterwards.

855
00:54:35,608 --> 00:54:40,731
[SPEAKER_10]: So they had apparently two strategies planned to seize the opportunities.

856
00:54:41,091 --> 00:54:50,837
[SPEAKER_10]: First, they're of course going to increase their distribution channel ties throughout both the United States and I believe in Europe.

857
00:54:51,618 --> 00:55:00,424
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, the second is developing more titles overall.

858
00:55:00,744 --> 00:55:00,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

859
00:55:01,781 --> 00:55:02,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Gary's Mod

860
00:55:26,311 --> 00:55:35,154
[SPEAKER_12]: 59.99 on the 360, 49.99 on the PC, Half-Life 2, 1 and 2, Team Fortress 2, and as Loki said, Portal, all in the orange box.

861
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:41,037
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, maybe this is the perfect opportunity for me to check it out because I haven't really played Half-Life a whole lot.

862
00:55:41,397 --> 00:55:42,097
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, a little bit.

863
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:46,779
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't play a lot of these first-person shooters and stuff.

864
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:49,860
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're going to buy it, Loki, then I'll check it out when you get it.

865
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:50,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

866
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:56,801
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's gone gold, so those of you guys that are excited about it, I know there's a couple people on my Twitter that are really excited about the Orange Box.

867
00:55:57,561 --> 00:55:58,781
[SPEAKER_12]: It's on its way very soon.

868
00:55:59,722 --> 00:56:00,922
[SPEAKER_12]: So take a look for it.

869
00:56:02,302 --> 00:56:07,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I can't say that I'm too excited about this bit of news because honestly I don't give a crap about it.

870
00:56:09,204 --> 00:56:20,768
[SPEAKER_07]: But some people are happy about it, so for anyone who's interested in the Sam & Max series, Season 2 will be on GameTap starting November 8th for those who have subscribed for it.

871
00:56:21,705 --> 00:56:24,367
[SPEAKER_07]: and it has Ice Station Santa.

872
00:56:26,689 --> 00:56:31,193
[SPEAKER_12]: For the person who emailed earlier about the quirky games, here you go, Sam & Max.

873
00:56:31,693 --> 00:56:33,534
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this is a good little quirky game.

874
00:56:34,135 --> 00:56:34,515
[SPEAKER_12]: Fun to play.

875
00:56:34,595 --> 00:56:35,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy.

876
00:56:35,836 --> 00:56:36,857
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't like Sam & Max?

877
00:56:37,237 --> 00:56:38,138
[SPEAKER_07]: I never got into it.

878
00:56:38,999 --> 00:56:39,439
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fun.

879
00:56:39,739 --> 00:56:40,139
[SPEAKER_12]: It's cute.

880
00:56:42,721 --> 00:56:43,342
[SPEAKER_12]: And funny.

881
00:56:44,837 --> 00:56:53,184
[SPEAKER_12]: I like how it's the only episodic game I can think of that actually continued to put out episodes.

882
00:56:53,244 --> 00:56:56,306
[SPEAKER_12]: Most episodic games you hear about die after two episodes.

883
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:56,866
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I mean?

884
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:57,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Shenmue.

885
00:56:58,007 --> 00:56:59,028
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

886
00:56:59,588 --> 00:57:06,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Shenmue was supposed to be a series of... They were supposed to have a whole line of them giving episodes of What's-His-Face's quest.

887
00:57:06,414 --> 00:57:12,198
[SPEAKER_12]: But see, somebody just pooped and quit along the way, and this...

888
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:14,815
[SPEAKER_12]: I blame all the Dreamcast haters.

889
00:57:16,476 --> 00:57:18,896
[SPEAKER_12]: So hooray to it being a good episodic game.

890
00:57:22,837 --> 00:57:24,217
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not drop my microphone.

891
00:57:25,417 --> 00:57:25,617
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

892
00:57:26,558 --> 00:57:28,418
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, we're going to open the Skype line very soon.

893
00:57:28,458 --> 00:57:34,119
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

894
00:57:34,179 --> 00:57:36,019
[SPEAKER_12]: But one more story before we get to that.

895
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:38,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

896
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:38,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

897
00:57:39,286 --> 00:57:50,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, so it's a little bit disappointing because this was one of the big features of Unreal Tournament 3 for the PlayStation 3, but no cross-platform play.

898
00:57:51,694 --> 00:57:54,555
[SPEAKER_10]: It was apparently too hard to make, so they scrapped it.

899
00:57:55,196 --> 00:58:02,620
[SPEAKER_10]: So you'll only be able to play people on the PC if you have the PC version, and only be able to play people on the PlayStation 3 if you have the PlayStation 3 version.

900
00:58:05,322 --> 00:58:05,662
[SPEAKER_10]: So sad.

901
00:58:06,078 --> 00:58:09,160
[SPEAKER_12]: So people on PCs cannot play people on PlayStation 3s.

902
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:09,861
[SPEAKER_10]: That's correct.

903
00:58:10,501 --> 00:58:11,181
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is kind of sad.

904
00:58:11,582 --> 00:58:12,082
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a bummer.

905
00:58:13,183 --> 00:58:16,925
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, well, we are going to open up the Skype line over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

906
00:58:16,985 --> 00:58:23,149
[SPEAKER_12]: Our username, of course, is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype, or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

907
00:58:23,229 --> 00:58:26,692
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's open up the Skype line and see who can get on through.

908
00:58:28,093 --> 00:58:29,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

909
00:58:29,374 --> 00:58:29,774
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

910
00:58:31,155 --> 00:58:32,816
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the one and only Legend of Zaku.

911
00:58:33,036 --> 00:58:34,517
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, Legend of Zaku.

912
00:58:34,657 --> 00:58:35,878
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind, my friend?

913
00:58:37,175 --> 00:58:41,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Just dealing with the aftermath of Digital Life this weekend.

914
00:58:41,758 --> 00:58:45,660
[SPEAKER_12]: I was hoping some of the New Yorkers would call in and tell us all about Digital Life.

915
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,221
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't get a chance to go.

916
00:58:48,282 --> 00:58:49,862
[SPEAKER_12]: As you know, I wanted to go and I didn't get to go.

917
00:58:50,283 --> 00:58:55,926
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody on my Twitter said, well, not that I should be thankful I didn't go, but that it wasn't that good this year.

918
00:58:55,946 --> 00:58:57,227
[SPEAKER_13]: You should be glad that you didn't go.

919
00:58:57,247 --> 00:59:02,309
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's just say a lot of drama is... Oh shit, what happened?

920
00:59:02,369 --> 00:59:03,270
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, what happened, Zaku?

921
00:59:04,344 --> 00:59:07,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I just want to make this a short story.

922
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:12,371
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to get people entangled in our current, you know, in the current affairs of our community.

923
00:59:12,471 --> 00:59:14,713
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, Saku, wait, hold on.

924
00:59:15,274 --> 00:59:16,835
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember we were talking about that fight earlier?

925
00:59:18,016 --> 00:59:20,238
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we go, I bet we're about to start a fight right here.

926
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:21,619
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

927
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:22,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

928
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:29,827
[SPEAKER_13]: To sum it up, basically, the biggest complaints right now were regarding freestyle and the way the rest of the other tournaments were run.

929
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,288
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, the

930
00:59:32,381 --> 00:59:51,296
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, for starters, the way freestyle turned out, in other words, people accusing the judges of favoritism, and, you know, people pissing and moaning on why certain of their, you know, their favorite, you know, freestylers didn't place at all, and there was a lot of name-calling.

931
00:59:52,196 --> 01:00:04,700
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of, you know, it even got to the point where one of the players from Expert Tech actually cursed out one of the organizers right there.

932
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,781
[SPEAKER_13]: And he got DQ'd but then ended up staying after apologizing.

933
01:00:12,768 --> 01:00:13,749
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

934
01:00:32,768 --> 01:00:34,610
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

935
01:00:53,229 --> 01:01:00,472
[SPEAKER_13]: Just, you know, it's just a lot of immature bullshit that's just spanning four pages on the Freak right now.

936
01:01:00,953 --> 01:01:01,793
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to get into it.

937
01:01:01,853 --> 01:01:02,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, hold on.

938
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:03,694
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so fine.

939
01:01:03,754 --> 01:01:05,475
[SPEAKER_12]: Go to DDR Freak for your DDR drama.

940
01:01:05,535 --> 01:01:08,496
[SPEAKER_12]: However, did this ruin digital life single-handedly?

941
01:01:08,516 --> 01:01:09,797
[SPEAKER_12]: Did one little fight ruin the show?

942
01:01:09,877 --> 01:01:10,637
[SPEAKER_12]: How did that go?

943
01:01:10,797 --> 01:01:12,838
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it turned out pretty good.

944
01:01:12,858 --> 01:01:19,301
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a lot of people that really complimented and really praised the organizers for running it.

945
01:01:21,269 --> 01:01:27,616
[SPEAKER_13]: The Padmisses were another issue that certain people had sour grapes over.

946
01:01:27,776 --> 01:01:38,028
[SPEAKER_13]: The way it was set up was that the machines were on the stage, and since the stage itself is not as secure as something like the ground,

947
01:01:39,251 --> 01:01:41,033
[SPEAKER_13]: They have no choice but to put it up there.

948
01:01:41,714 --> 01:01:45,297
[SPEAKER_13]: They have no say in where the machines are actually placed.

949
01:01:45,317 --> 01:01:50,462
[SPEAKER_13]: The sponsors, the people running Digital Life, require them to put the machines up on the stage.

950
01:01:50,502 --> 01:01:51,343
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's not even that.

951
01:01:51,423 --> 01:01:51,983
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just...

952
01:02:02,924 --> 01:02:03,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's just put it this way.

953
01:02:04,025 --> 01:02:07,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Pad misses were just caused by the instability of the stage.

954
01:02:08,287 --> 01:02:12,289
[SPEAKER_13]: Just having all the machines and people up there.

955
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:17,271
[SPEAKER_13]: The censors just going off like that.

956
01:02:17,291 --> 01:02:20,373
[SPEAKER_13]: That was one of the biggest complaints by certain people.

957
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:29,257
[SPEAKER_13]: They agreed with the judgment calls because the people running and taking down the scores were very meticulous.

958
01:02:29,847 --> 01:02:36,910
[SPEAKER_13]: and making sure that whatever score was received was the fairest and most accurate score out there.

959
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:42,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Tell me one thing in digital life that was cool that has nothing to do with DDR.

960
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:44,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Guitar Hero 3.

961
01:02:45,354 --> 01:02:49,375
[SPEAKER_12]: It's alright though, but I mean... It's fine.

962
01:02:50,236 --> 01:02:52,076
[SPEAKER_12]: He was within the confines of the question.

963
01:02:52,336 --> 01:02:54,137
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, so Guitar Hero 3, how was it?

964
01:02:55,018 --> 01:02:55,898
[SPEAKER_13]: It was alright, I mean...

965
01:02:56,650 --> 01:03:00,014
[SPEAKER_13]: I only played it once, but so far it's just nice graphics.

966
01:03:00,094 --> 01:03:01,216
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all same gameplay.

967
01:03:01,716 --> 01:03:02,237
[SPEAKER_13]: New songs.

968
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:03,819
[SPEAKER_12]: New songs, same gameplay.

969
01:03:04,019 --> 01:03:06,743
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but I just can't get my mind off of, you know...

970
01:03:08,687 --> 01:03:12,490
[SPEAKER_13]: of the 800 pound gorilla in the room, which is the DDR tournament.

971
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:14,972
[SPEAKER_13]: That's still lingering right now.

972
01:03:15,993 --> 01:03:22,478
[SPEAKER_13]: I just hope next year we just fix what we had to that went wrong this time.

973
01:03:23,198 --> 01:03:24,680
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't take the DDR talk anymore.

974
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,320
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

975
01:03:26,021 --> 01:03:27,442
[SPEAKER_12]: I had to hit the red button to end it.

976
01:03:28,502 --> 01:03:30,064
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't deal with the DDR drama anymore.

977
01:03:30,084 --> 01:03:30,764
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, guys.

978
01:03:33,466 --> 01:03:34,968
[SPEAKER_12]: If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR

979
01:03:37,242 --> 01:03:38,463
[SPEAKER_12]: Username OrangeLoungeRadio.

980
01:03:38,563 --> 01:03:39,724
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

981
01:03:39,744 --> 01:03:40,165
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

982
01:03:41,045 --> 01:03:41,786
[SPEAKER_04]: It's GS68.

983
01:03:41,906 --> 01:03:42,927
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, GS68.

984
01:03:42,947 --> 01:03:45,069
[SPEAKER_12]: What DDR drama would you like to report on tonight?

985
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:49,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, not really DDR drama.

986
01:03:49,252 --> 01:03:51,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to say drama in general sucks ass.

987
01:03:52,115 --> 01:03:53,736
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, drama in general is kind of crappy.

988
01:03:54,016 --> 01:03:54,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, someone...

989
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:59,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Violated the card line thingy today when I was playing Maximum Tune 3

990
01:04:14,028 --> 01:04:14,669
[SPEAKER_12]: Now we get into it.

991
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:45,143
[SPEAKER_12]: Can't we all just get along?

992
01:04:45,283 --> 01:04:46,343
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, seriously, people?

993
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:49,265
[SPEAKER_12]: Y'all are fighting each other over... And here's the thing.

994
01:04:49,745 --> 01:04:52,786
[SPEAKER_12]: You're starting fights over Dance Dance Revolution.

995
01:04:53,967 --> 01:04:55,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Can't anyone see the comedy in this?

996
01:04:56,088 --> 01:05:03,531
[SPEAKER_12]: And then now you're calling people a fag because they beat you to playing Midnight Maximum Tune.

997
01:05:04,252 --> 01:05:06,853
[SPEAKER_12]: And this gives you the right to call other people gay?

998
01:05:07,934 --> 01:05:08,634
[SPEAKER_12]: Come on!

999
01:05:09,898 --> 01:05:13,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, making it to a machine first is a really different sexuality.

1000
01:05:13,521 --> 01:05:13,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, I know.

1001
01:05:13,901 --> 01:05:24,368
[SPEAKER_12]: His penis must be so large that I'd be like, you know... How would you deal with someone hogging the machine when your turn was next?

1002
01:05:24,969 --> 01:05:25,289
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway.

1003
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:27,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Drama sucks.

1004
01:05:27,271 --> 01:05:27,771
[SPEAKER_12]: Tell me something.

1005
01:05:27,791 --> 01:05:29,452
[SPEAKER_12]: I need to hear a happy story, GS68.

1006
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:31,113
[SPEAKER_12]: Something good happened this week, didn't it?

1007
01:05:31,213 --> 01:05:31,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything?

1008
01:05:31,634 --> 01:05:31,914
[SPEAKER_12]: Something?

1009
01:05:31,934 --> 01:05:36,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, since news sites don't cover arcade games, I'll cover the arcade games myself.

1010
01:05:37,138 --> 01:05:38,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally got to play Initial D for...

1011
01:05:39,767 --> 01:05:41,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I didn't even know Initial D4 came out.

1012
01:05:41,468 --> 01:05:41,889
[SPEAKER_04]: How was that?

1013
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:43,690
[SPEAKER_04]: It was alright.

1014
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:47,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the drifty physics because it felt more like drift racing.

1015
01:05:47,793 --> 01:05:49,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that something that's new over Initial D3?

1016
01:05:51,116 --> 01:06:03,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Initial D3, there was some drifting, but you couldn't see it unless you were in third-person view, which was useless because the camera wasn't right on your butt, so it's very hard to control your car.

1017
01:06:05,967 --> 01:06:08,309
[SPEAKER_12]: And does it still have all the fabulous Eurobeat in Initial D4?

1018
01:06:09,335 --> 01:06:13,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I heard you can't pick your own song and just randomly choose for you.

1019
01:06:13,697 --> 01:06:18,018
[SPEAKER_12]: That's so that the same person doesn't play Heartbeat over and over and over again because they don't know how to change the song.

1020
01:06:18,038 --> 01:06:19,739
[SPEAKER_12]: That's probably a good thing.

1021
01:06:19,759 --> 01:06:21,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now I'm hearing Speedcar over and over.

1022
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:28,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, the song goes, Speedcar, Speedcar, AE86 is coming.

1023
01:06:29,743 --> 01:06:32,364
[SPEAKER_12]: Now suddenly we've turned into a singing karaoke show.

1024
01:06:32,404 --> 01:06:32,944
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that's right.

1025
01:06:32,964 --> 01:06:35,965
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, all Eurobeat songs sound the same.

1026
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:38,166
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the strangest Skyblind segment ever.

1027
01:06:39,292 --> 01:06:43,375
[SPEAKER_12]: 877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio Give us a call, let's talk

1028
01:07:05,546 --> 01:07:06,667
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1029
01:07:06,727 --> 01:07:07,087
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

1030
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,948
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Brad from PodCulture.

1031
01:07:09,008 --> 01:07:10,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, Brad from PodCulture.

1032
01:07:10,509 --> 01:07:11,230
[SPEAKER_08]: So good to hear from you.

1033
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:11,790
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

1034
01:07:12,731 --> 01:07:17,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you said you wanted to hear from somebody who was crazy enough to be in a midnight launch of Halo 3.

1035
01:07:17,073 --> 01:07:19,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and let me guess.

1036
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:20,736
[SPEAKER_12]: It was you, wasn't it?

1037
01:07:21,316 --> 01:07:21,636
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.

1038
01:07:21,876 --> 01:07:22,197
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1039
01:07:22,237 --> 01:07:22,917
[SPEAKER_12]: So why?

1040
01:07:23,017 --> 01:07:25,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Why did you have to be there at midnight?

1041
01:07:25,639 --> 01:07:27,260
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you couldn't wait till the next day?

1042
01:07:28,372 --> 01:07:30,254
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more of a social thing than anything else.

1043
01:07:30,515 --> 01:07:31,536
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with that.

1044
01:07:31,796 --> 01:07:39,263
[SPEAKER_10]: He had to be there because someone cut in front of him for Midnight Maximum Tune 3 and the stage was unstable for DDR.

1045
01:07:39,944 --> 01:07:46,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, when I had pre-ordered my copy at Best Buy, they had said that they were going to be open until midnight.

1046
01:07:47,431 --> 01:07:48,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Ours here in Louisville weren't.

1047
01:07:50,174 --> 01:07:50,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1048
01:07:51,114 --> 01:07:51,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Louisville?

1049
01:07:52,324 --> 01:07:52,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Louisville.

1050
01:07:53,324 --> 01:07:54,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Louisville, Kentucky.

1051
01:07:54,565 --> 01:07:56,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, for a second I thought it was Lowellville.

1052
01:07:56,566 --> 01:07:58,907
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like Louisville.

1053
01:08:00,147 --> 01:08:02,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Only city can take a horse race and turn it into a three week party.

1054
01:08:05,729 --> 01:08:06,169
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1055
01:08:06,469 --> 01:08:06,730
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1056
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:12,772
[SPEAKER_07]: My uncle used to live there for a little while and that's exactly the same way he described it.

1057
01:08:13,632 --> 01:08:20,835
[SPEAKER_07]: He lived there for a little while with some woman that he was seeing and then he moved to right outside Nashville.

1058
01:08:22,222 --> 01:08:23,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is almost as bad.

1059
01:08:24,783 --> 01:08:26,923
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, so you were in the line in Louisville.

1060
01:08:28,223 --> 01:08:30,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I went to three different lines, actually.

1061
01:08:30,324 --> 01:08:32,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Dang, so you had to go all around.

1062
01:08:32,844 --> 01:08:40,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the Best Buy wasn't open, so our co-host, Glenn, had his pre-order at a GameStop over in Indiana.

1063
01:08:42,006 --> 01:08:43,766
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's about 15, 20 minutes away.

1064
01:08:43,806 --> 01:08:46,987
[SPEAKER_08]: So I drove over there to meet him, and they didn't have any more of the collector's edition.

1065
01:08:48,343 --> 01:08:48,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1066
01:08:49,163 --> 01:08:52,505
[SPEAKER_08]: So I drove over to meet a friend at another GameStop here in Louisville.

1067
01:08:52,745 --> 01:08:55,707
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't have any and wound up in line at Circuit City.

1068
01:08:56,547 --> 01:08:56,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1069
01:08:57,908 --> 01:08:59,488
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, okay, Circuit City.

1070
01:08:59,508 --> 01:09:02,310
[SPEAKER_12]: There's not a lot of people seem to shop at Circuit City anymore, so that makes sense.

1071
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:04,391
[SPEAKER_12]: No, there's only like 20 or 30 people in line.

1072
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:04,951
[SPEAKER_12]: See what I mean?

1073
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:19,393
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember when we went out, when the Nintendo Wii went on sale, we went around to all the different lines, which, by the way, yes, there is a difference between the Wii Midnight launch and this, is that you knew everybody was going to have Halo 3 coming out the ass the next day, but when the Wii came out, you had to be in line at midnight, or you weren't getting a Wii.

1074
01:09:20,074 --> 01:09:22,696
[SPEAKER_08]: I finally saw a Wii on the shelf the other day.

1075
01:09:22,816 --> 01:09:23,336
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

1076
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:25,458
[SPEAKER_12]: Big difference.

1077
01:09:25,538 --> 01:09:28,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, yeah, there was like, what, four people at Circuit City?

1078
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:31,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there was less than 20, 15, 20, 25 people, something like that.

1079
01:09:31,603 --> 01:09:32,264
[SPEAKER_08]: But so you got it.

1080
01:09:34,853 --> 01:09:38,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I got it, and the guy ahead of me spent like 800 bucks.

1081
01:09:38,996 --> 01:09:41,639
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right, you sent us a private message earlier, so he went all out.

1082
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:43,840
[SPEAKER_12]: Did he say why he was so crazy for Halo?

1083
01:09:45,522 --> 01:09:50,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if he hadn't actually had his girlfriend with him, I would have thought he hadn't moved out of his parents' basement yet.

1084
01:09:51,807 --> 01:09:52,948
[SPEAKER_08]: He was pretty geeky.

1085
01:09:53,248 --> 01:09:55,109
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe the girlfriend lives with him in the parents' basement.

1086
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:56,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that could be it, too.

1087
01:09:56,911 --> 01:10:00,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Some girlfriends will visit their boyfriends in their parents' basement.

1088
01:10:01,455 --> 01:10:01,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes.

1089
01:10:02,575 --> 01:10:04,337
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they'll realize that he's kind of, you know...

1090
01:10:06,002 --> 01:10:06,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Not desirable.

1091
01:10:06,943 --> 01:10:07,823
[SPEAKER_07]: But he loves me.

1092
01:10:07,843 --> 01:10:09,924
[SPEAKER_08]: 800 bucks for a game.

1093
01:10:09,944 --> 01:10:10,565
[SPEAKER_08]: That was crazy.

1094
01:10:10,985 --> 01:10:12,566
[SPEAKER_07]: He hits me because he loves me.

1095
01:10:14,027 --> 01:10:16,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, we are in Kentucky here.

1096
01:10:16,448 --> 01:10:20,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, hey, I'm not from too much farther away from there, so...

1097
01:10:23,021 --> 01:10:25,323
[SPEAKER_08]: It was actually a lot of fun hanging around talking to people.

1098
01:10:25,683 --> 01:10:30,686
[SPEAKER_12]: Now you sent me a private message about some of the voice acting in Halo 3 that you discovered during the credits.

1099
01:10:30,706 --> 01:10:32,406
[SPEAKER_12]: Some pretty popular sci-fi stars.

1100
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,407
[SPEAKER_12]: I know you love your sci-fi.

1101
01:10:33,967 --> 01:10:36,109
[SPEAKER_12]: Who can we find in Halo 3 in the voice acting?

1102
01:10:36,729 --> 01:10:40,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Nathan Fillion, Adam Baldwin, and Alan Tudyk from Firefly.

1103
01:10:41,171 --> 01:10:41,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

1104
01:10:41,832 --> 01:10:44,153
[SPEAKER_08]: And Katie Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica.

1105
01:10:44,433 --> 01:10:46,154
[SPEAKER_12]: She is awesome and Bionic Woman now.

1106
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:49,687
[SPEAKER_12]: of which I missed on Wednesday, but I have a T-vote.

1107
01:10:49,707 --> 01:10:50,968
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to watch it a little later.

1108
01:10:51,008 --> 01:10:52,409
[SPEAKER_08]: She's freaking nuts on that show.

1109
01:10:52,529 --> 01:10:54,590
[SPEAKER_12]: I hear she's the reason to watch that show.

1110
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:55,290
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1111
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:57,872
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm definitely going to want to check that out.

1112
01:10:58,492 --> 01:10:59,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Good times.

1113
01:11:00,553 --> 01:11:01,854
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe not A-list actors.

1114
01:11:01,914 --> 01:11:06,856
[SPEAKER_12]: In the sci-fi world, they're definitely on the A-list, but some pretty well-known actors there for the Halo 3.

1115
01:11:07,717 --> 01:11:11,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time I think of dude, I still cry over the end of Firefly.

1116
01:11:12,299 --> 01:11:13,540
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's not do spoilers.

1117
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,521
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying anything.

1118
01:11:15,681 --> 01:11:15,941
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1119
01:11:17,113 --> 01:11:17,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, come on.

1120
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:18,973
[SPEAKER_08]: The movie's been out two years.

1121
01:11:19,353 --> 01:11:19,713
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1122
01:11:19,753 --> 01:11:20,154
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine.

1123
01:11:20,734 --> 01:11:23,094
[SPEAKER_07]: That was just a sucky way to die, okay?

1124
01:11:23,174 --> 01:11:24,014
[SPEAKER_07]: That sucked.

1125
01:11:24,594 --> 01:11:25,614
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a leaf on the wind.

1126
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:27,315
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you're a leaf pinned to a chair.

1127
01:11:29,115 --> 01:11:29,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Splat.

1128
01:11:31,855 --> 01:11:32,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, man.

1129
01:11:33,416 --> 01:11:37,476
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to hunt Joss down and burn my Joss Whedon is my master now shirt.

1130
01:11:39,497 --> 01:11:40,277
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, nerds.

1131
01:11:40,437 --> 01:11:42,777
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got to wrap up this call and take some more nerdy calls.

1132
01:11:42,817 --> 01:11:46,558
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to watch the Sarah Jane Adventures, I promise, since the new episodes are out.

1139
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:43,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Digital Life Retro Arcade Area Big Problem Apparently on VIP Day on Thursday, they wanted Billy Mitchell to have a photo op with the Donkey Kong machine I was playing on the machine, they told me to get off the machine

1140
01:12:44,294 --> 01:12:45,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I refuse.

1141
01:12:45,095 --> 01:12:48,777
[SPEAKER_03]: They threatened to take my VIP pass and kick me off the premises.

1142
01:12:49,617 --> 01:12:52,299
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just let them have the machines.

1143
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,141
[SPEAKER_12]: Were you going for a high score or something?

1144
01:12:55,181 --> 01:12:58,763
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, like, were you about ready to be the new King of Kong?

1145
01:13:03,006 --> 01:13:03,486
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that?

1146
01:13:05,007 --> 01:13:06,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Just playing the machines.

1147
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:13,981
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, how does that feel that they had to just kick you off there because somebody more important was in town and needed a photo op?

1148
01:13:14,121 --> 01:13:15,221
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of got to suck.

1149
01:13:16,682 --> 01:13:21,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's all about power there, I guess.

1150
01:13:21,042 --> 01:13:28,064
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to have to actually get the world record on the machine and then you'll be able to get on any Donkey Kong machine you want in the world.

1151
01:13:29,664 --> 01:13:30,504
[SPEAKER_12]: There you have it.

1152
01:13:30,624 --> 01:13:36,225
[SPEAKER_12]: So were you so mad that you just kind of left or did you walk around and check out other stuff that was at Digital Life?

1153
01:13:38,194 --> 01:13:39,174
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I just left.

1154
01:13:39,194 --> 01:13:39,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I was mad.

1155
01:13:39,634 --> 01:13:42,175
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'll try again next year.

1156
01:13:42,195 --> 01:13:45,576

[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, take care.

1158
01:14:10,132 --> 01:14:10,752
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, take care.

1159
01:14:10,772 --> 01:14:14,253
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there was connection problems there or something.

1160
01:14:14,913 --> 01:14:18,334
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for sharing the injustices of Donkey Kong in this world.

1161
01:14:19,935 --> 01:14:20,475

01:14:26,316 --> 01:14:31,678
[SPEAKER_09]: So I heard that they were holding the bar and that wasn't cool.

1166
01:14:33,518 --> 01:14:35,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome to DDR Drama Chat.

1167
01:14:35,239 --> 01:14:36,039

[SPEAKER_12]: It's good to hear from you.

1173
01:14:41,357 --> 01:14:41,878
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind?

1174
01:14:43,158 --> 01:14:46,520
[SPEAKER_09]: You were asking about people that were in a Halo 3 midnight launch.

1175
01:14:48,141 --> 01:14:49,622
[SPEAKER_12]: How did I know you'd call about this?

1176
01:14:49,702 --> 01:14:50,503
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, what happened?

1177
01:14:50,543 --> 01:14:51,303
[SPEAKER_12]: What's your story?

1178
01:14:52,444 --> 01:14:59,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually, the full story I'm not going to go into, but I was actually up in Bellevue, Washington as a guest of Microsoft.

1179
01:14:59,488 --> 01:15:02,089
[SPEAKER_09]: So I attended one of the big midnight launches.

1180
01:15:02,109 --> 01:15:03,450
[SPEAKER_09]: I was not standing in line for it.

1181
01:15:04,506 --> 01:15:06,347
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was a huge party.

1182
01:15:06,647 --> 01:15:08,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it was actually fun being there.

1183
01:15:08,228 --> 01:15:09,989
[SPEAKER_09]: I had fun and I wasn't even getting the game.

1184
01:15:10,609 --> 01:15:12,910
[SPEAKER_09]: And Master Chief, he's skinnier in person.

1185
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:14,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Just wanted to throw that out there.

1186
01:15:14,871 --> 01:15:15,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1187
01:15:16,172 --> 01:15:17,552
[SPEAKER_12]: So what did you guys get to do?

1188
01:15:17,612 --> 01:15:20,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Didn't you guys get to go hand out goodies to people in line and stuff?

1189
01:15:21,494 --> 01:15:28,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I handed out some Halo 3 shirts and we had some Halo 3 lanyards and these little $5 Burger King credit card things.

1190
01:15:29,696 --> 01:15:43,460
[SPEAKER_09]: so we were giving out like it doesn't get you a Happy Meal or anything but it was at least $5 towards something and we were just giving those out to people in the line for doing stupid stuff or just throwing them out that sounds like fun were there tons of people there?

1191
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:52,022
[SPEAKER_09]: there were probably about 400 wow 400 to 500 people there all in line like stretched all the way down to the Home Depot that was across the parking lot dang

1192
01:15:52,529 --> 01:16:19,740
[SPEAKER_09]: and everything and like Mountain Dew was giving out like big game fuel and all their other stuff and Ball showed up with this big huge van and Fungi showed up in a big charter bus coming straight from their launch party so they were all boozed up and giving out calendars and swag and Bill Gates showed up he shook hands with the first like 50 people in line right after he rolled out of bed but it was a big party I think Warren Moon was there and everybody was like we love you and Tecmo Ball

1193
01:16:22,474 --> 01:16:28,457
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish we could have been there to hand out orange soda and cookies in our traditional fashion, but maybe for Halo 4.

1194
01:16:28,977 --> 01:16:32,658
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh wait, I guess there can't be a Halo 4, can there?

1195
01:16:32,698 --> 01:16:33,398
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll find a way.

1196
01:16:35,099 --> 01:16:36,680
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just the end of the story arc.

1197
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,520
[SPEAKER_09]: They never said it was the end of Halo.

1198
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:42,442
[SPEAKER_12]: But doesn't the box advertise the end of Halo?

1199
01:16:42,702 --> 01:16:43,222
[SPEAKER_12]: Halo Wars.

1200
01:16:43,242 --> 01:16:43,742
[SPEAKER_12]: There'll be more.

1201
01:16:44,142 --> 01:16:46,023
[SPEAKER_12]: There'll be another game to get excited about later.

1202
01:16:46,844 --> 01:16:50,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Now they did throw out these stress balls that were oranges.

1203
01:16:52,811 --> 01:16:54,572
[SPEAKER_09]: and they were actually throwing them at people.

1204
01:16:56,314 --> 01:16:57,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you save one for us, Bobby?

1205
01:16:58,535 --> 01:17:02,038
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't pelt them at me.

1206
01:17:02,058 --> 01:17:02,738
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so sorry.

1207
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:07,962
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll just put that on the list of reasons to start a fight with you, that's all.

1208
01:17:08,683 --> 01:17:09,163
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

1209
01:17:09,843 --> 01:17:17,369
[SPEAKER_09]: People were walking out of there with big Halo clicks, the big huge Spartan stuff because they were the WizKids stuff and

1210
01:17:17,845 --> 01:17:23,909
[SPEAKER_09]: and people were walking out of there with hundreds of dollars worth of stuff and I'm like, you guys realize this is just for a DVD?

1211
01:17:25,490 --> 01:17:29,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you see people dropping like $800 like the guy Brad said he saw that bought the Xbox?

1212
01:17:29,972 --> 01:17:31,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh.

1213
01:17:32,534 --> 01:17:37,917
[SPEAKER_09]: We did see somebody walk out with like the big huge Halo action clicks figuring it was a couple hundred and

1214
01:17:38,633 --> 01:17:43,295
[SPEAKER_09]: The Legendary Edition, and then I did see one Xbox 360 sold along with that stuff.

1215
01:17:43,335 --> 01:17:45,216
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, I can fully believe.

1216
01:17:45,596 --> 01:17:47,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that people just caught up in the moment, you think?

1217
01:17:47,797 --> 01:17:50,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Or do you think there's just people that are that hardcore for their Halo?

1218
01:17:52,079 --> 01:17:58,282
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it'd be people that are that hardcore, or to buy the 360, it might be somebody who never got a 360 until Halo came out.

1219
01:17:58,817 --> 01:18:01,779
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, like that would make sense because, you know, I got the Halo Xbox.

1220
01:18:02,339 --> 01:18:07,262
[SPEAKER_12]: The original Xbox is a Halo one because I didn't buy it until Halo was out.

1221
01:18:07,402 --> 01:18:11,084
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, it had been out a little while and they did those special green Xboxes.

1222
01:18:11,404 --> 01:18:12,825
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, oh, I have to get one of those.

1223
01:18:13,345 --> 01:18:16,307
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah, I guess that was it.

1224
01:18:16,327 --> 01:18:18,468
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't wait a no midnight line for it either, though.

1225
01:18:19,349 --> 01:18:25,312
[SPEAKER_09]: And you don't you didn't need to wait in the midnight line because, like, as I've been telling some people, the Fry's Electronics near me.

1226
01:18:25,902 --> 01:18:26,903
[SPEAKER_09]: We walked in yesterday.

1227
01:18:26,943 --> 01:18:28,845
[SPEAKER_09]: There are ten Legendary Editions sitting on the shelf.

1228
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:33,028
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I went to Fry's too, and they just had tons and tons of Halo 3.

1229
01:18:33,509 --> 01:18:36,011
[SPEAKER_12]: And I didn't even get the Limited Edition.

1230
01:18:36,051 --> 01:18:37,893
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not that into Halo.

1231
01:18:38,013 --> 01:18:38,974
[SPEAKER_12]: I just got the regular game.

1232
01:18:39,074 --> 01:18:46,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they only gave us the regular game, so I don't have any of the cutscene discs or anything else that came with it.

1233
01:18:47,501 --> 01:18:53,006
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Loki had the other one early, because he's sly like that.

1234
01:18:53,647 --> 01:18:54,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Good times.

1235
01:18:54,488 --> 01:18:58,131
[SPEAKER_12]: Which reminds me, I still need to load the bonus stuff that you have on your one disc, Loki.

1236
01:18:58,391 --> 01:18:59,212
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't let me forget.

1237
01:18:59,912 --> 01:19:00,192
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow.

1238
01:19:00,553 --> 01:19:02,314
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners, Bobby?

1239
01:19:02,394 --> 01:19:03,535
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm glad to hear you had a good time.

1240
01:19:04,436 --> 01:19:05,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, that's it.

1241
01:19:05,597 --> 01:19:16,225
[SPEAKER_09]: You just wanted to talk about the Halo 3 launch, but really, that guy, when he touched the bar and we just really all got pissed off at him and stuff, that just, they didn't kick him out.

1242
01:19:16,406 --> 01:19:19,168
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I had to hang up on Bobby because I didn't want to hear about DDR drama.

1243
01:19:22,182 --> 01:19:24,123
[SPEAKER_12]: and there is no bar raping in Halo, come on.

1244
01:19:24,783 --> 01:19:26,124
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1245
01:19:27,985 --> 01:19:29,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, it's SSJ100 Matt.

1246
01:19:29,966 --> 01:19:32,267
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, hello SSJ100 Matt, what's on your mind?

1247
01:19:33,468 --> 01:19:35,269
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm exhausted from digital life.

1248
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:41,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Dare I ask about... I don't know, there's no drama on this call.

1249
01:19:41,532 --> 01:19:44,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I judged... Praise you, you're a great man.

1250
01:19:45,174 --> 01:19:46,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though what?

1251
01:19:46,755 --> 01:19:51,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I was helping the judge on the elephant in the room.

1252
01:19:54,304 --> 01:20:01,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, well, tell us about Digital Life, like what else you saw there and some of the other stuff, because I have yet to hear what else there was at Digital Life besides DDR.

1253
01:20:02,846 --> 01:20:05,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for the most part, this is my first time going.

1254
01:20:06,426 --> 01:20:12,467
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I understand, it was a lot smaller than last year, but gaming-wise, I had a really good time.

1255
01:20:15,068 --> 01:20:18,068
[SPEAKER_02]: They've premiered a lot of games that haven't been out yet.

1256
01:20:19,769 --> 01:20:20,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly PC stuff.

1257
01:20:21,883 --> 01:20:29,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to play World of Conflict, World in Conflict I should say, which I thought was pretty good.

1258
01:20:30,285 --> 01:20:34,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to try to get on Hellgate London, but the line was too long for that.

1259
01:20:37,606 --> 01:20:44,228
[SPEAKER_02]: And the biggest surprise I would say, and Loki's going to hate me for this, was the Eye of Judgment.

1260
01:20:45,988 --> 01:20:46,368
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

1261
01:20:46,528 --> 01:20:49,589
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this a positive review of the Eye of Judgment?

1262
01:20:49,609 --> 01:20:50,289
[SPEAKER_12]: You thought it was cool?

1263
01:20:51,129 --> 01:20:56,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yeah, I don't have a PS3 yet, but you know, I would seriously consider it.

1264
01:20:57,031 --> 01:21:01,593
[SPEAKER_12]: This is not the first person that's called in to say the Eye of Judgment is better than you think.

1265
01:21:02,253 --> 01:21:06,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I was hearing some good reviews from the Game Crazy managers when they got back from conference.

1266
01:21:06,415 --> 01:21:07,935
[SPEAKER_12]: What the crap is going on?

1267
01:21:07,975 --> 01:21:13,398
[SPEAKER_07]: That you don't have to photocopy or buy any booster packs or anything, that it comes with all of the cards available for the game.

1268
01:21:13,618 --> 01:21:17,019
[SPEAKER_12]: But Jamie, seriously, you did see the same thing we saw at E3 last year, right?

1269
01:21:18,101 --> 01:21:19,062
[SPEAKER_12]: with the eye of judgment.

1270
01:21:19,182 --> 01:21:20,103
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't go to the game.

1271
01:21:20,183 --> 01:21:24,707
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't come with all the cards because that's why they sell booster packs and assorted decks.

1272
01:21:25,188 --> 01:21:29,551
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they were saying at the Game Crazy Managers Conference that's coming with them all intact.

1273
01:21:30,012 --> 01:21:30,813
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet you it's not.

1274
01:21:31,874 --> 01:21:32,654
[SPEAKER_07]: That's from the vendor.

1275
01:21:32,674 --> 01:21:33,255
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm misinformed.

1276
01:21:33,895 --> 01:21:34,656
[SPEAKER_07]: That's from the vendor.

1277
01:21:34,676 --> 01:21:34,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

1278
01:21:34,996 --> 01:21:35,577
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go back to the caller.

1279
01:21:35,597 --> 01:21:35,977
[SPEAKER_12]: What caller?

1280
01:21:37,339 --> 01:21:43,304
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I understand, from what I was told, actually Wizards of the Coast is handling the game packs, I believe.

1281
01:21:44,082 --> 01:21:48,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I actually should because they were the one hosting the event.

1282
01:21:48,224 --> 01:21:53,928
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, they're going to be giving out 150 cards when you buy the game.

1283
01:21:54,988 --> 01:21:56,529
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that's what they say.

1284
01:21:56,689 --> 01:21:57,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, maybe that was what it was.

1285
01:21:58,070 --> 01:22:00,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, because they figured out probably that everyone's going to pirate them anyway.

1286
01:22:02,813 --> 01:22:06,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, you know, I'm going to be sending you guys a couple gifts.

1287
01:22:06,835 --> 01:22:09,997
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the gifts is actually a couple cards from the game.

1288
01:22:10,497 --> 01:22:12,398
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys will get to check that out.

1289
01:22:12,799 --> 01:22:13,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome!

1290
01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:15,381
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually thinking about getting the game, honestly.

1291
01:22:17,223 --> 01:22:18,164
[SPEAKER_12]: Go right ahead.

1292
01:22:18,184 --> 01:22:19,605
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not going to sell millions.

1293
01:22:19,745 --> 01:22:23,689
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this turnaround is hilarious in my own mind.

1294
01:22:24,109 --> 01:22:30,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Just from what I was hearing from the feedback from the managers conference, I was like, well, I'll give it a try.

1295
01:22:31,135 --> 01:22:31,536
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe.

1296
01:22:32,596 --> 01:22:36,019
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

1297
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:38,502
[SPEAKER_12]: What else in digital life would you think was cool?

1298
01:22:39,723 --> 01:22:39,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1299
01:22:42,405 --> 01:22:46,128
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they touched on it before, but I really like Guitar Hero 3.

1300
01:22:46,768 --> 01:22:47,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1301
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:54,333
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of hard to hear any of the songs, because, you know, the whole convention itself was loud as hell.

1302
01:22:54,493 --> 01:23:02,539
[SPEAKER_02]: But it just reminds me, it just seems like a better version of 1 and 2.

1303
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:09,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone said it seems like modifiers, but there are involved, but I don't know how true that is.

1304
01:23:11,085 --> 01:23:11,325
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

1305
01:23:12,259 --> 01:23:14,480
[SPEAKER_12]: So it didn't just feel like Guitar Hero 2 with new songs?

1306
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:22,322
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it didn't seem like a copy-and-paste, like, 80s style or whatever, 80s mix.

1307
01:23:22,902 --> 01:23:26,503
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, which basically was a copy-and-paste job, but that's a whole other story.

1308
01:23:27,363 --> 01:23:31,444
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, so if you had to judge digital life on a scale of 1 to 10, what would you give it?

1309
01:23:33,765 --> 01:23:38,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, considering this was my first one, I'd have to give it, like, 7 out of 10.

1310
01:23:38,926 --> 01:23:40,587
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, that's not bad, not bad.

1311
01:23:41,588 --> 01:23:49,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll be sending you guys out a couple of stuff, including some viewers I got from the elephant in the closet.

1312
01:23:49,513 --> 01:23:52,735
[SPEAKER_12]: The game we can't speak of tonight.

1313
01:23:54,115 --> 01:23:57,337
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to give it the JT treatment, I guess.

1314
01:23:57,877 --> 01:23:58,378
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all right.

1315
01:23:58,458 --> 01:24:02,700
[SPEAKER_12]: No, we do love DDR, which is why it pains us so much to hear about all this drama.

1316
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:03,741
[SPEAKER_12]: Can't we all just get along?

1317
01:24:03,781 --> 01:24:05,102
[SPEAKER_12]: You people are playing a dancing game.

1318
01:24:05,122 --> 01:24:06,102
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't take it that seriously.

1319
01:24:06,983 --> 01:24:07,243
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1320
01:24:08,194 --> 01:24:15,457
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, SJ100, Matt, we gotta let you go, but thank you so much for calling in and giving us a drama-free report from Digital Life.

1321
01:24:15,477 --> 01:24:16,018
[SPEAKER_12]: We appreciate it.

1322
01:24:16,298 --> 01:24:16,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't mention it.

1323
01:24:16,998 --> 01:24:17,718
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, take care, buddy.

1324
01:24:18,519 --> 01:24:19,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, take care.

1325
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:21,220
[SPEAKER_12]: I love this.

1326
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:23,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Mystic Gohan in chat sums this up perfectly.

1327
01:24:23,721 --> 01:24:24,942
[SPEAKER_12]: After this, who knows?

1328
01:24:25,282 --> 01:24:27,063
[SPEAKER_12]: Africa could be Loki's favorite game ever.

1329
01:24:28,623 --> 01:24:30,184
[SPEAKER_12]: Only if I get to run over the animals.

1330
01:24:31,257 --> 01:24:32,018
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, I like beer.

1331
01:25:00,334 --> 01:25:07,040
[SPEAKER_12]: My final thought is I need like another air conditioning vent in here because it's getting too hot.

1332
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:07,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

1333
01:25:09,041 --> 01:25:13,065
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is Asshole Mario is hilarious.

1334
01:25:13,425 --> 01:25:13,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Hilarious.

1335
01:25:14,005 --> 01:25:15,647
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you can't stop watching it.

1336
01:25:16,167 --> 01:25:16,608
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't.

1337
01:25:16,968 --> 01:25:23,153
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see you back here next week, boys and girls, for Orange Lounge Radio episode number 250, if you can believe it.

1338
01:25:23,173 --> 01:25:29,158
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm telling you, you know, I know how G4 is desperate for television to play all these back to back.

1339
01:25:29,431 --> 01:25:29,871
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1340
01:25:29,891 --> 01:25:30,872
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a good hour block.

1341
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:31,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't it a three-day weekend?

1342
01:25:31,953 --> 01:25:32,193
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

1343
01:25:33,454 --> 01:25:34,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Next weekend.

1344
01:25:34,435 --> 01:25:35,556
[SPEAKER_12]: Is next weekend a three-day weekend?

1345
01:25:35,576 --> 01:25:36,096
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think so.

1346
01:25:36,476 --> 01:25:37,257
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1347
01:25:37,337 --> 01:25:38,538
[SPEAKER_12]: Unless you get Columbus Day off.

1348
01:25:38,598 --> 01:25:39,439
[SPEAKER_07]: I get Columbus Day.

1349
01:25:39,479 --> 01:25:39,859
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why.

1350
01:25:40,179 --> 01:25:42,301
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I work for... I think it's Columbus Day.

1351
01:25:42,321 --> 01:25:43,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I get banking holidays.

1352
01:25:43,602 --> 01:25:44,503
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, lucky you.

1353
01:25:45,183 --> 01:25:45,443
[SPEAKER_12]: Not me.

1354
01:25:45,523 --> 01:25:49,987
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to get... I'm going to bring some Metoxa and drink it on the show.

1355
01:25:50,267 --> 01:25:50,747
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1356
01:25:50,887 --> 01:25:52,328
[SPEAKER_12]: Stay tuned and see how that goes.

1357
01:25:52,389 --> 01:25:52,849
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll be back.

1358
01:25:53,467 --> 01:25:55,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1359
01:25:55,467 --> 01:25:56,028
