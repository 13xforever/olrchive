1
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:23,819
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, September 30th, 2007, Halo 3 breaks big records, Blue Dragon gets free download content, and could Katana someday do battle with Wonder Woman?

2
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:34,497
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Katana fighting Wonder Woman would be kind of awesome, actually.

3
00:00:34,757 --> 00:00:35,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, hi!

4
00:00:35,237 --> 00:00:36,158
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get to that later.

5
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:39,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, welcome everybody to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,401
[SPEAKER_01]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.

7
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:45,541
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Rob Roberts.

8
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:48,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:49,143 --> 00:00:49,803
[SPEAKER_04]: I has a beer.

10
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,604
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:14,596
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?

12
00:01:14,896 --> 00:01:21,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody's replaced the desk with a laundry basket, and that's not exactly an even trade, I think.

13
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,462
[SPEAKER_02]: But it holds the laptop just high enough so that it's easy to work on.

14
00:01:28,603 --> 00:01:30,243
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get you one of those little school desks.

15
00:01:30,664 --> 00:01:34,946
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a desk, it's a laundry basket turned upside down to become a desk.

16
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:37,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, our studio's kind of...

17
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:40,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Ghetto tonight because we moved the desk out of here.

18
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:44,800
[SPEAKER_01]: My roommate took his old desk and moved it into his room because he wants the computer stuff in there.

19
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Just put the candy bowl on the ground.

20
00:01:47,603 --> 00:01:49,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Well then take your beer and put it where the beer was.

21
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:52,273
[SPEAKER_01]: My beer is better.

22
00:01:52,453 --> 00:01:59,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Put the candy bowl on top of the pedestal, which I think is a trash can, and put the beer in the middle of the bowl.

23
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:01,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, you have chocolate and a holder for the beer.

24
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:05,944
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to remind you, you're not listening to the 1UP podcast.

25
00:02:05,964 --> 00:02:09,267
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not listening to Gaming Windows Magazine podcast.

26
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:12,449
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not listening to some podcast with a budget, okay?

27
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:14,231
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

28
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:19,315
[SPEAKER_01]: We like find change under the couch, and that's what we use to pay for this program, okay?

29
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:19,615
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

30
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,011
[SPEAKER_02]: There is some budgie going into the Halloween candy.

31
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:24,712
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like five bucks right there.

32
00:02:24,732 --> 00:02:25,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Priorities, okay?

33
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:26,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Priorities.

34
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know where the Tootsie Rolls are.

35
00:02:28,434 --> 00:02:29,354
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no Tootsie Rolls.

36
00:02:29,374 --> 00:02:30,395
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no Tootsie Rolls.

37
00:02:30,455 --> 00:02:31,175
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have brownies.

38
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:32,335
[SPEAKER_01]: You want brownies?

39
00:02:33,376 --> 00:02:33,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

40
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:34,597
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no joke there.

41
00:02:34,617 --> 00:02:36,477
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do have little yummy brownies.

42
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:39,839
[SPEAKER_05]: They are good, and they taste like coffee, too, like the Starbucks ones.

43
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:48,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, though, I'm hoping that if we can get all the computer issues worked out, we can go out into El Garage, I mean the studio...

44
00:02:50,168 --> 00:02:50,868
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

45
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:21,999
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't lived with my parents since I was 15.

46
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:22,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Ow.

47
00:03:29,696 --> 00:03:30,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Mommy, wow.

48
00:03:59,491 --> 00:04:03,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone asked special brownies, and once again, there is no budget for special brownies.

49
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:09,456
[SPEAKER_01]: No, like we could afford marijuana even if we wanted to eat it, which I'm not really into that, so sorry.

50
00:04:09,476 --> 00:04:11,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you want to eat marijuana?

51
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to disappoint.

52
00:04:12,057 --> 00:04:13,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, apparently it gets you high.

53
00:04:13,778 --> 00:04:15,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it tastes like ass, so.

54
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:18,520
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't stand the smell of marijuana.

55
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, kids, don't do drugs.

56
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:23,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't we do video games once in a while here on this show?

57
00:04:23,783 --> 00:04:28,825
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, please save us from turning into the hashcast and tell us about your gaming week.

58
00:04:29,827 --> 00:04:31,268
[SPEAKER_04]: I play a lot of Ragnarok online.

59
00:04:32,108 --> 00:04:32,488
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot.

60
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:35,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I played this game called Ragnarok.

61
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,811
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so cool.

62
00:04:37,831 --> 00:04:38,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Rob, shut up.

63
00:04:38,671 --> 00:04:38,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

64
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,713
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a level 91 assassin now.

65
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:45,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Been beating the shit out of ogres.

66
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:52,078
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've also got... People are going to yell at me because you're not supposed to do what I'm working on.

67
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:59,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was going to make an agility Spear Knight, and now I'm making an agility one-handed sword crusader.

68
00:05:01,053 --> 00:05:03,414
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, but I am going to do a Spear Knight next.

69
00:05:04,394 --> 00:05:05,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Spear Knights are cool.

70
00:05:05,814 --> 00:05:07,595
[SPEAKER_05]: They have long pulls and poke things with them.

71
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:09,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

72
00:05:09,995 --> 00:05:12,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds kind of... I've not played any World of Warcraft.

73
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:15,497
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I'm going to stop paying for it while my computer's down.

74
00:05:16,217 --> 00:05:18,577
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually did not play any Pinball this week.

75
00:05:19,257 --> 00:05:23,499
[SPEAKER_05]: But, excuse me, Halo 3 in my house.

76
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:29,180
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a bunch of people in our house doing multiplayer Halo campaigns.

77
00:05:31,324 --> 00:05:33,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan decided to get all of his buddies.

78
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:41,127
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Will in one of the rooms and then our friend Alex, who's a crazy psycho ex-Marine.

79
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:43,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that a LAN party?

80
00:05:44,187 --> 00:05:45,488
[SPEAKER_01]: A local area nerd party?

81
00:05:45,688 --> 00:05:47,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

82
00:05:47,368 --> 00:05:48,869
[SPEAKER_05]: But they unbeaten on Legendary.

83
00:05:50,869 --> 00:05:54,550
[SPEAKER_05]: According to Dan, the way to beat Halo 3 on Legendary is to be an uber-sniper.

84
00:05:58,026 --> 00:06:01,087
[SPEAKER_05]: I've compared Legendary to Nightmare on Doom.

85
00:06:16,163 --> 00:06:18,644
[SPEAKER_01]: I seriously, like, I play the game on normal.

86
00:06:19,064 --> 00:06:22,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I would play on easy, but you don't get achievements on easy, so I'd play on normal.

87
00:06:22,945 --> 00:06:24,826
[SPEAKER_01]: I seriously died ten times in the first level.

88
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:30,348
[SPEAKER_01]: I suck at Halo so bad, there should be, like, a charity for me or something.

89
00:06:30,748 --> 00:06:31,168
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sad.

90
00:06:31,388 --> 00:06:33,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

91
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,670
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I didn't.

92
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind.

93
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:37,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

94
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,250
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't this week.

95
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:38,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

96
00:06:39,011 --> 00:06:40,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, oh, oh, oh.

97
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:40,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes, I did.

98
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:42,172
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Flash game.

99
00:06:42,212 --> 00:06:43,152
[SPEAKER_05]: I found a Flash game.

100
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:43,532
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?

101
00:06:44,577 --> 00:06:45,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Dungeon Escape

[SPEAKER_05]: and um it can be found and I'm trying to get the address for people it's at okay studiohunty h-u-n-t-y dot com slash dungeon and I'm going to link it in the chat room it's hilarious it's not just hilarious it's hilarious hilarious yeah I'm going to link it in the chat room alright well while that's being linked if there's nothing else for your gaming week we'll move on over to Loki how was your gaming week?

103
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,561
[SPEAKER_01]: My gaming week was fine.

104
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:44,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

105
00:07:45,322 --> 00:07:49,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I started off playing Halo 3 on Legendary.

106
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:53,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Single player because no one wants to fucking join my games, so fuck you all.

107
00:07:53,726 --> 00:07:55,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll beat it myself, and I'm better than you.

108
00:07:55,947 --> 00:07:59,088
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll play with you, but I'll probably hold you back.

109
00:07:59,288 --> 00:07:59,988
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever.

110
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:02,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing it by myself.

111
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:04,691
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, I want to know where all this sand in your vagina is coming from.

112
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:06,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you sending out invites to people on your friends list?

113
00:08:06,851 --> 00:08:07,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sending out invites at all.

114
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Well then, if you don't invite people, then how do you expect people to join your party?

115
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:14,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm speaking like an internet celebrity or something that says people, you know.

116
00:08:14,722 --> 00:08:15,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Wake up, call!

117
00:08:16,703 --> 00:08:18,464
[SPEAKER_02]: No, really, I... You are not famous.

118
00:08:18,644 --> 00:08:20,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no patience to sit in the lobby for like... I am.

119
00:08:21,045 --> 00:08:23,406
[SPEAKER_02]: ...a long time, so I'm just playing by myself.

120
00:08:23,626 --> 00:08:24,547
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because I have boobies.

121
00:08:25,225 --> 00:08:26,987
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

122
00:08:40,523 --> 00:08:41,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I've seen him on Halo a couple times.

123
00:08:41,503 --> 00:08:43,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he wasn't on there when I was on there.

124
00:08:43,224 --> 00:08:45,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you should give him a call or something.

125
00:08:45,585 --> 00:08:46,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Say, hey, Bobby.

126
00:08:46,365 --> 00:08:52,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, let me just... My phone that has everyone's phone number in it.

127
00:08:52,207 --> 00:08:53,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there it is, Bobby's number.

128
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:58,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait, no, I don't have Bobby's number because that's a mystical phone that doesn't exist.

129
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:05,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now, really, yeah, I could send him a message saying, hey, you know, want to play some Halo 3?

130
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:09,374
[SPEAKER_02]: But to be honest, I don't know when I'm going to be online to play Halo 3, you know.

131
00:09:10,014 --> 00:09:14,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing all sorts of busy stuff like, you know, going to see Eastern Promises and crap.

132
00:09:14,635 --> 00:09:16,176
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

133
00:09:16,676 --> 00:09:28,319
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, so, other than playing Halo 3, um, I've actually, well, of course, more Saints Row multiplayer and people are starting to get pissed off because, um, it's kind of unfair for them.

134
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:37,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, like, been playing on other people's systems, you know, while they were gone or something and, yeah, my system is way better.

135
00:09:38,082 --> 00:09:38,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Like,

136
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:39,015
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

137
00:10:02,748 --> 00:10:04,630
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so... It's such a you game.

138
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:05,491
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

139
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:09,335
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really... I mean, it is not hard at all to play through the game at all.

140
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,058
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's fun.

141
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:13,479
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just stupid little things.

142
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:14,661
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great rental game.

143
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:22,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's also probably a good game to have friends over and just drink and play it and laugh.

144
00:10:23,214 --> 00:10:24,094
[SPEAKER_01]: On the PSP?

145
00:10:24,234 --> 00:10:25,615
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you play it with friends?

146
00:10:25,655 --> 00:10:27,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not on the PSP, but it's also on PlayStation 2.

147
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:31,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the PlayStation 2 version because my sister's still borrowing my PlayStation 2.

148
00:10:32,201 --> 00:10:33,682
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to call her up and say, Hey!

149
00:10:34,382 --> 00:10:34,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring it back!

150
00:10:35,183 --> 00:10:35,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I did say, Hey!

151
00:10:35,984 --> 00:10:36,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring it back!

152
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:38,826
[SPEAKER_02]: But she hasn't brought it back yet.

153
00:10:39,226 --> 00:10:40,047
[SPEAKER_02]: You send out the troops.

154
00:10:41,628 --> 00:10:45,611
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, let's see... Other than that, I tried Driver 76 for the PSP.

155
00:10:47,861 --> 00:10:48,401
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucked.

156
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:50,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Much like every other driver game known to man.

157
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to try the driver series anymore.

158
00:10:53,824 --> 00:10:55,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to stay away from it.

159
00:10:56,205 --> 00:10:59,487
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's pretty much it.

160
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:05,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I've updated my firmware on my PSP Slim to 3.71 CFW or whatever the new...

161
00:11:08,891 --> 00:11:09,211
[SPEAKER_02]: A cookie theme?

162
00:11:09,231 --> 00:11:09,732
[SPEAKER_02]: A cookie theme.

163
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:09,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Like?

164
00:11:29,386 --> 00:11:32,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Like peanut butter cookies and chocolate chip cookies.

165
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Cookie Monster.

166
00:11:33,671 --> 00:11:34,993
[SPEAKER_02]: It's chocolate chip cookies.

167
00:11:35,573 --> 00:11:36,895
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll show you.

168
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:38,236
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hilarious.

169
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:41,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Sony would like to remind you not to eat your PSP.

170
00:11:42,597 --> 00:11:44,759
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but it seriously is the cookie theme.

171
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,920
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the OLR theme?

172
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:47,741
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened to that?

173
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:49,442
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't made that yet.

174
00:11:49,963 --> 00:11:51,063
[SPEAKER_02]: I will get into that later.

175
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:56,027
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, I just had to pay to renew OLRPSP.com, our PSP site, this week.

176
00:11:56,828 --> 00:11:59,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it does look like someone ate your PSP.

177
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I see.

178
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:03,093
[SPEAKER_01]: It changes all the icons into cookies as well.

179
00:12:03,293 --> 00:12:04,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on, I'll put that on the Op11 cam in a minute.

180
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:05,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it?

181
00:12:06,036 --> 00:12:06,656
[SPEAKER_01]: It changed all that.

182
00:12:07,536 --> 00:12:08,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't eat the PSP, Jamie.

183
00:12:08,757 --> 00:12:09,357
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not healthy.

184
00:12:09,457 --> 00:12:18,960
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, there's actually one thing that I don't think is in the show roll tonight, but the Japan PlayStation site released the official tool to make themes.

185
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,321
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, we can make an OLR theme for the PSP.

186
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:25,641
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's pretty sweet.

187
00:12:26,281 --> 00:12:27,822
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's some other ones on there.

188
00:12:27,842 --> 00:12:31,823
[SPEAKER_02]: They have like Wipeout and some pretty pink one that

189
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:33,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Shadow Slayer says, Loki's PSP is delish.

190
00:12:52,323 --> 00:12:55,745
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkTexTV says, this is a PSP made of chocolate chips and cookie dough.

191
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:58,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you imagine if the PSP could just make cookies?

192
00:12:58,607 --> 00:12:59,328
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be awesome.

193
00:12:59,768 --> 00:13:02,490
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be totally worth the price.

194
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:08,293
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been growing fonder and fonder of the PSP this year and last year.

195
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:09,874
[SPEAKER_01]: More so than when the thing first came out.

196
00:13:10,115 --> 00:13:11,495
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been more fond of the PSP this year.

197
00:13:12,716 --> 00:13:14,257
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be even awesomer if it made cookies.

198
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:17,439
[SPEAKER_01]: I think more people would buy those than DSs if that happened.

199
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:18,440
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to have like...

200
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:19,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

201
00:13:19,638 --> 00:13:20,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

202
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,050
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

203
00:14:12,672 --> 00:14:21,037
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most people that do probably went out and got the game unless you hate first-person shooters for some reason, in which case I find it hard to believe you got Xbox 360 in the first place.

204
00:14:21,297 --> 00:14:24,800
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest, I was never a fan of Halo, and Halo 3 is pretty cool.

205
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,721
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the matchmaking is pretty good.

206
00:14:26,761 --> 00:14:36,467
[SPEAKER_01]: I do admit I don't think the graphics are as great as other Xbox 360 games I've played, and certainly there's been news about that this week, which we'll get into a little later.

207
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:37,447
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what?

208
00:14:37,487 --> 00:14:38,468
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not all about graphics.

209
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:41,570
[SPEAKER_01]: They are bright, though, and vibrant.

210
00:14:42,202 --> 00:14:46,644
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reason I've always loved Halo before was multiplayer, and multiplayer doesn't disappoint.

211
00:14:46,664 --> 00:14:52,766
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in regards, it is just Halo 2, but, you know, with more, and that's okay.

212
00:14:53,186 --> 00:14:58,007
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're not a fan of Halo at all, I don't know if this is going to do it for you.

213
00:14:58,248 --> 00:15:01,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Because especially the single-player mode, man, it just throws you right in.

214
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:02,969
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no backstory, no nothing.

215
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:08,711
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it hard to follow because I'm not good at single-player, therefore I don't really play the campaign modes of the other games.

216
00:15:10,472 --> 00:15:10,952
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway...

217
00:15:12,065 --> 00:15:12,485
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that.

218
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:18,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Halo 3, and then World of Warcraft, I finally went back to after about a three-week vacation.

219
00:15:18,688 --> 00:15:24,830
[SPEAKER_01]: I decided to go back to World of Warcraft this week, and I'm trying to think how that's been going.

220
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:32,073
[SPEAKER_01]: I just hit level 66, ran some instances with some friends over near Thralmar, I can't remember what that zone's called.

221
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:35,755
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, back into World of Warcraft, which I missed a little bit.

222
00:15:36,155 --> 00:15:40,997
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad I waited, because now I have a bunch of friends in the guild that are on the same level I am, so we're running instances together.

223
00:15:41,037 --> 00:15:41,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times.

224
00:15:42,518 --> 00:15:44,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, not a whole lot.

225
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,541
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no new arcade release this week.

226
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:47,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you notice that?

227
00:15:47,942 --> 00:15:48,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I the one that noticed that?

228
00:15:49,023 --> 00:15:54,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that they decided, you know, on Xbox Live Arcade that since Halo 3 came out, they didn't need an arcade release this week.

229
00:15:54,968 --> 00:15:57,249
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess they released like a Bomberman pack or something.

230
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:57,990
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nothing new.

231
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I the one that noticed that?

232
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:01,873
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking forward to something new on Wednesday.

233
00:16:01,893 --> 00:16:02,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there wasn't anything new.

234
00:16:02,654 --> 00:16:03,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I want Puzzle Quest or something.

235
00:16:04,495 --> 00:16:09,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, well, just like, you know, you said, you know, you almost didn't notice that.

236
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:12,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think probably a lot of people almost didn't notice.

237
00:16:13,044 --> 00:16:15,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think a lot of people probably didn't care because they were too busy.

238
00:16:15,624 --> 00:16:18,845
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been doing two a week, so that's pretty good.

239
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:22,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and our chatroom Henderson man says, I noticed I want Puzzle Quest.

240
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:23,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I kind of feel the same way.

241
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:25,487
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all this cool stuff coming out that I want.

242
00:16:25,707 --> 00:16:29,788
[SPEAKER_02]: But Puzzle Quest isn't probably coming out until November because that's when the console versions are coming out.

243
00:16:29,808 --> 00:16:34,630
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's Rez and there's... Rez ain't coming out this year, okay?

244
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you that much.

245
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:36,330
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a jerk.

246
00:16:36,866 --> 00:16:46,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Just other stuff would be cool Omega 5, maybe I don't think Rez is coming out this year How about Castle Crashers?

247
00:16:46,191 --> 00:16:47,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the fuck's Castle Crashers?

248
00:16:47,512 --> 00:16:48,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't that supposed to be out last year?

249
00:16:49,213 --> 00:17:04,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Let's see, going to the chat room Sometimes our chatters like to post about their gaming weeks And I think my favorite gaming week Goes to AJ Mix in our chat room Says, my gaming week Legend of the Mystical Ninja on Wii Virtual Console And Halo 3

250
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,824
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think he wins because Legend of the Mystical Ninja is awesome.

251
00:17:09,225 --> 00:17:09,866
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a pretty awesome game.

252
00:17:09,886 --> 00:17:10,607
[SPEAKER_01]: It is an awesome game.

253
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:14,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you gotten to the place where you can play Gradius in one of the arcades?

254
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Like little shops and games?

255
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,177
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty awesome.

256
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:18,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a look at that.

257
00:17:19,921 --> 00:17:20,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

258
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:25,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping for tonight, of which, again, we don't have a whole lot.

259
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:42,358
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not been a whole lot of news going on with our show recently, so of course we'll continue to plug the community, such as our LiveJournal community at Orange Lounge on LiveJournal, our username, our MySpace at MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, our Facebook, I think it's called the OL Army or the OLR listeners or something on Facebook, and...

260
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,668
[SPEAKER_01]: If you listened to the show a couple weeks ago, I don't really use Facebook that religiously.

261
00:17:47,229 --> 00:17:50,337
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, our website, www.orangeonstrade.com.

262
00:17:50,377 --> 00:17:51,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Next week is episode 250.

263
00:17:53,252 --> 00:18:21,680
[SPEAKER_01]: and although we're not planning a whole lot of big stuff for it because we already had our 5th anniversary show this year so we already kind of did fun stuff for that we're hoping to actually switch our location a little bit which for those of you that listen to us live and watch on the webcam might get a kick out of that and we're hoping to also bring some more interviews and just do some reshuffling of the shows if you have ideas, go post in our forums what kinds of things you'd like to see on Orange Launch Radio as we go into our next 50 episodes and 100 more after that and who knows how much longer we can get this show going

264
00:18:22,705 --> 00:18:24,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, let's get into some gaming news.

265
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:26,706
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start off with Loki tonight, some gaming news.

266
00:18:54,076 --> 00:18:54,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

267
00:18:54,957 --> 00:18:56,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm not surprised.

268
00:18:56,457 --> 00:19:02,801
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew it was going to sell like crazy, and yeah, it's going to continue to sell like crazy.

269
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:10,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Weren't they touting on Xbox.com or somewhere that it's like, biggest entertainment day ever?

270
00:19:10,185 --> 00:19:22,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're saying that their sales, you know, top that of like, I don't know, Spider-Man 3 or something like that, the box office gross, to which I say, Spider-Man 3 wasn't that great of a movie.

271
00:19:24,251 --> 00:19:29,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it costs $9.50, maybe $10.50 depending on where you live to go to the movies to see Spider-Man 3.

272
00:19:30,356 --> 00:19:32,438
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're cheap like me, you'll go to a matinee for $7.

273
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:37,342
[SPEAKER_01]: But Halo 3, $60 plus tax for Halo 3.

274
00:19:37,622 --> 00:19:40,264
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course it made a shitload of money, right?

275
00:19:40,505 --> 00:19:40,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.

276
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:42,546
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know.

277
00:19:43,207 --> 00:19:44,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Is my math that screwed up?

278
00:19:44,813 --> 00:19:47,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we can do the math and figure out exactly how much it made.

279
00:19:48,296 --> 00:19:49,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't care.

280
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:53,161
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we all knew Halo 3 was going to make shitloads of money.

281
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:55,423
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what the press release should have said.

282
00:19:55,503 --> 00:19:57,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Confirmed, Halo 3 makes shitload of money.

283
00:19:57,545 --> 00:19:58,726
[SPEAKER_02]: It made a lot of money.

284
00:19:59,027 --> 00:20:01,629
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, it's just going to help them out.

285
00:20:01,709 --> 00:20:03,351
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll sell consoles possibly.

286
00:20:03,851 --> 00:20:07,735
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, although some people from other companies have come out and said, no, it's not.

287
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,817
[SPEAKER_02]: People that already wanted, you know,

288
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo 3, even Burger King is advertising it.

289
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:13,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Money aside, I wonder why considering it's an M-rated game.

290
00:20:34,877 --> 00:20:39,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Good point, because usually Burger King advertises little child movies in Dora the Explorer, right?

291
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:45,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would say Burger King still advertises R-rated movies and that kind of stuff.

292
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they?

293
00:20:46,521 --> 00:20:47,141
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

294
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:49,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know.

295
00:20:50,022 --> 00:20:51,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you get little toys with your mirrors there?

296
00:20:52,142 --> 00:20:53,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can get different things.

297
00:20:54,223 --> 00:20:56,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no, Jurassic Park was PG-13.

298
00:20:58,084 --> 00:20:58,964
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing, though.

299
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:00,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and it kind of goes back to the whole...

300
00:21:02,699 --> 00:21:03,400
[SPEAKER_02]: ESRB ratings.

301
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:12,224
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no laws in place forbidding people from playing the game if they're under 18 or whatever.

302
00:21:13,144 --> 00:21:18,087
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really all just store policies and stuff like that.

303
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:23,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless, of course, you're in specific states, which makes it a felony to sell a game to a minor.

304
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:28,592
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still not a law.

305
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:34,650
[SPEAKER_01]: TigerClaw in our chatroom says, I wouldn't be surprised if the king suddenly ends up as an unlockable character in Halo 3.

306
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:37,531
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be awesome because then he could shoot it over and over again.

307
00:21:37,851 --> 00:21:40,453
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be the best ever because he's really freaking disturbing.

308
00:21:40,573 --> 00:21:40,973
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

309
00:21:40,993 --> 00:21:43,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I want Ronald McDonald in the Grimace.

310
00:21:43,574 --> 00:21:46,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I would rather not have him in there, to be honest.

311
00:21:46,236 --> 00:21:48,637
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it would be kind of jump in the shark.

312
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:50,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it would be.

313
00:21:50,618 --> 00:21:52,599
[SPEAKER_02]: They've already whored themselves out enough for Halo 3.

314
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:53,820
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe in Halo 4.

315
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,460
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was everywhere.

316
00:21:55,621 --> 00:21:58,342
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need it to be quite that everywhere.

317
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:05,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Brad from PodCulture is in our chatroom and says, The guy ahead of me in line for Halo 3 dropped $800.

318
00:22:05,674 --> 00:22:12,881
[SPEAKER_01]: He bought the Legendary Edition, the Halo version of the 360 console, the two Halo controllers, and some other crap.

319
00:22:12,901 --> 00:22:13,882
[SPEAKER_01]: $800 on Halo.

320
00:22:14,343 --> 00:22:15,544
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's a consumer whore.

321
00:22:16,025 --> 00:22:16,445
[SPEAKER_01]: And how.

322
00:22:17,526 --> 00:22:17,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it.

323
00:22:17,966 --> 00:22:18,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Beat you to it.

324
00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:22,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I see, oh my god.

325
00:22:22,861 --> 00:22:26,422
[SPEAKER_02]: 360 Halo 3 system, that thing is not selling as well as I think they thought it would.

326
00:22:26,802 --> 00:22:27,863
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's butt ugly.

327
00:22:28,163 --> 00:22:28,783
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stupid.

328
00:22:28,823 --> 00:22:31,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a paint job for 50 extra bucks.

329
00:22:31,064 --> 00:22:36,666
[SPEAKER_01]: I think because most people already bought the 360 that were anticipating Halo before they announced this.

330
00:22:36,906 --> 00:22:44,629
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a system that doesn't include Halo 3 that's for 50 extra dollars that's a weird color.

331
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,751
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's kind of stupid.

332
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:51,347
[SPEAKER_02]: At least you could do a throw in the game.

333
00:22:51,387 --> 00:22:52,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

334
00:22:52,468 --> 00:22:55,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Did anyone go out to the midnight sales or hear about them at all?

335
00:22:55,748 --> 00:22:55,968
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

336
00:22:56,368 --> 00:23:00,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, and I... God damn, I meant to get... My husband was out one because he sold.

337
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:02,010
[SPEAKER_01]: And what did he say?

338
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:02,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Did he say anything about it?

339
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:03,970
[SPEAKER_05]: He said they were butt ugly.

340
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:05,290
[SPEAKER_01]: The people?

341
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:05,910
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

342
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

343
00:23:08,311 --> 00:23:13,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, actually, our manager in Dallas, Texas, he dresses up like

344
00:23:14,515 --> 00:23:14,996
[SPEAKER_02]: A Spartan.

345
00:23:15,196 --> 00:23:16,757
[SPEAKER_02]: He has an actual Spartan costume.

346
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:17,678
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks cool, too.

347
00:23:19,459 --> 00:23:24,382
[SPEAKER_02]: He went out to some Dallas launches and stuff and walked around and did fun stuff like that.

348
00:23:24,543 --> 00:23:27,184
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't get it.

349
00:23:28,886 --> 00:23:30,687
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's cool.

350
00:23:31,007 --> 00:23:32,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't want to do every single midnight.

351
00:23:32,508 --> 00:23:35,971
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you've seen a midnight launch, then you've seen them all.

352
00:23:36,271 --> 00:23:38,833
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just someone else cosplaying as something else.

353
00:23:39,744 --> 00:23:43,145
[SPEAKER_02]: and long-ass line and people waiting and excited about something.

354
00:23:43,285 --> 00:23:44,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really, that's kind of what it is.

355
00:23:44,986 --> 00:23:48,907
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting because Halo 3 is pretty awesome, but it's not going to be the game of the year for me.

356
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:51,747
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think for a lot of people, it's not... I don't think it's going to be the game of the year.

357
00:23:51,767 --> 00:23:54,428
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people were going to... Oh, it's going to be worth the wait.

358
00:23:54,488 --> 00:23:55,729
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's good.

359
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:57,429
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, it's better than good.

360
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:57,889
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.

361
00:23:57,989 --> 00:24:00,070
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think it's going to be game of the year for me.

362
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:03,591
[SPEAKER_01]: I can already think of at least one game that's very similar to Halo that's better.

363
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:05,712
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't even have multiplayer mode.

364
00:24:06,352 --> 00:24:07,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean...

365
00:24:08,024 --> 00:24:14,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think a game really needs to have the best graphics or have the best whatever.

366
00:24:14,728 --> 00:24:17,229
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about the best gameplay.

367
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:19,050
[SPEAKER_02]: It has great gameplay.

368
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:26,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo 2, before Halo 3 came out, was still on the top 10 most played game on live.

369
00:24:27,555 --> 00:24:32,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Now Halo 3 will just take that spot and people will still buy it.

370
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:36,480
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes a good game, though, is...

371
00:24:37,264 --> 00:24:43,611
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that even throughout time, as new games come out, people are still interested in that game.

372
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:55,104
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like when Saints Row 2 comes out or whatever, people are going to be still playing Crackdown or the original Saints Row, or Grand Theft Auto 4.

373
00:24:55,144 --> 00:24:57,807
[SPEAKER_02]: When that comes out, everyone's going to forget about a lot of other games as well.

374
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:05,952
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's just me or the people on my friends list, but I notice a lot of my friends lists don't play.

375
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:08,153
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very much in the now.

376
00:25:08,313 --> 00:25:13,275
[SPEAKER_01]: I only ever see people playing the current games or the games that have come out within the past month.

377
00:25:13,475 --> 00:25:14,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously this week it's been Halo 3.

378
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,536
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure everybody's friends list was like that.

379
00:25:16,896 --> 00:25:18,636
[SPEAKER_01]: But before that it was all Bioshock.

380
00:25:18,676 --> 00:25:23,078
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't see anybody playing Ridge Racer 6 anymore.

381
00:25:23,858 --> 00:25:24,878
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very interesting.

382
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:26,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of people playing the old stuff.

383
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:28,808
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

384
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,492
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was interesting.

385
00:25:31,033 --> 00:25:38,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I think this is kind of interesting too, is that there's some Halo 3 errors, some disc errors that are pissing people off.

386
00:25:38,908 --> 00:25:46,273
[SPEAKER_01]: The Legendary, I'm sorry, not The Legendary, but the limited edition versions of the games apparently have some scratched disc copies of Halo 3.

387
00:25:46,513 --> 00:25:51,216
[SPEAKER_01]: It's causing some disc read errors, even on some consoles, the Red's Ring of Death.

388
00:25:51,957 --> 00:25:53,198
[SPEAKER_01]: That's bullshit.

389
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:56,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know about that, if one little disc skip can cause that.

390
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,023
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the things are all under warranty anyway, so it shouldn't be too big of a deal.

391
00:26:01,463 --> 00:26:07,084
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly people that wanted to get their Halo on launch night are pretty pissed off that the limited edition copies are scratched.

392
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:15,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Now naturally they have a replacement disc program in the works and all that stuff, but you can be sure that somebody's probably getting fired over this.

393
00:26:15,566 --> 00:26:21,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, all it was was the crappy packaging and caused the disc to fall off the hub because it was a piece of crap.

394
00:26:22,008 --> 00:26:27,189
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't understand why, because in other countries they had a piece of foam and they're holding the disc in place.

395
00:26:28,145 --> 00:26:34,070
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a replacement program in place right now for both the Essentials disc and the normal game disc.

396
00:26:34,751 --> 00:26:48,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, on top of all that, the whole Red Ring of Death thing, could it possibly be, and this is kind of a stretch for me, could it be possibly that you're playing it for so many hours straight that the console is overheating because of that?

397
00:26:48,543 --> 00:26:49,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's poorly ventilated.

398
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what the Red Ring of Death would be caused by.

399
00:26:53,451 --> 00:26:56,854
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I mean, it's because of a chip overheating.

400
00:26:56,955 --> 00:27:02,079
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not because of a discrete error is not going to cause your chip all of a sudden to explode.

401
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,063
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's Bill Gates' fault, obviously.

402
00:27:07,865 --> 00:27:08,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

403
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously.

404
00:27:09,386 --> 00:27:10,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he did it himself.

405
00:27:10,747 --> 00:27:11,108
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

406
00:27:11,128 --> 00:27:12,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he went out there with a knife.

407
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,371
[SPEAKER_01]: He took a pin and scratched it.

408
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:15,810
[SPEAKER_01]: An exacto knife.

409
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,411
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, scratch all those CDs.

410
00:27:17,531 --> 00:27:34,574
[SPEAKER_02]: To kind of draw a parallel here, I would say, for example, let's just say, this is about as ridiculous as saying, okay, if there was a certain car that had problems with their tires popping or something like that, and now there's a rumor going around saying that if you insert a certain CD into your CD player that your tire is going to explode.

411
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:37,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's about how ridiculous it is.

412
00:27:37,135 --> 00:27:38,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting comments from chat.

413
00:27:38,855 --> 00:27:41,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Weedoo says, not so in New Zealand, Loki.

414
00:27:41,496 --> 00:27:43,776
[SPEAKER_01]: My store's limited editions were all scratched.

415
00:27:44,738 --> 00:27:47,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Piccaruno says all Japanese editions had foam inserts.

416
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:50,239
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good idea.

417
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:51,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they package games better there.

418
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they do package the games a little better there.

419
00:27:53,820 --> 00:28:00,381
[SPEAKER_01]: They should also, you know what they should do is they should have like, you know, cases that have rose petals and daisies inside them.

420
00:28:00,401 --> 00:28:07,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was stupid that they had like these just little hubs on there that weren't, you know, the kind of locking ones that they'd have in normal DVD cases.

421
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:10,283
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, somewhat did fuck up and it's stupid.

422
00:28:10,964 --> 00:28:12,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily mine was not scratched, so.

423
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:14,920
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

424
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:19,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, good for you, Loki, not having a scratched Halo 3 game.

425
00:28:19,483 --> 00:28:20,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Ours wasn't scratched either.

426
00:28:21,984 --> 00:28:22,904
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought the regular one.

427
00:28:23,064 --> 00:28:26,186
[SPEAKER_01]: I walked in the day after the midnight sale.

428
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:27,347
[SPEAKER_01]: I walked in that next day.

429
00:28:27,527 --> 00:28:28,727
[SPEAKER_01]: I walked right into Fry's.

430
00:28:28,747 --> 00:28:34,410
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a humongous Halo 3 setup with just DVDs coming out Master Chief's ass.

431
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,751
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there were so many games.

432
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:36,912
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like, oh, pick one up.

433
00:28:37,232 --> 00:28:37,592
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it.

434
00:28:37,672 --> 00:28:39,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, speaking of Master Chief's ass...

435
00:28:40,506 --> 00:28:45,528
[SPEAKER_05]: You should check out this charity Halo 3 action figure of the Master Chief.

436
00:28:46,368 --> 00:28:50,009
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very chickly.

437
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:54,391
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an 11.5 inch figure right now going for $241.

438
00:28:54,511 --> 00:28:59,953
[SPEAKER_05]: It only has three bids on it at the time of this article.

439
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:04,935
[SPEAKER_05]: But they are donating 10% of the profits to the American Breast Cancer Foundation.

440
00:29:07,135 --> 00:29:08,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Master Chief is a very hot chick.

441
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Mistress Chief or, you know, Ms.

442
00:29:14,202 --> 00:29:15,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Chief if you're nasty.

443
00:29:15,983 --> 00:29:16,323
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

444
00:29:16,783 --> 00:29:19,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it looks stupid to me.

445
00:29:20,505 --> 00:29:25,927
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like someone took like a fucking figure for like Witchblade and stuck the Master Chief helmet on it.

446
00:29:26,427 --> 00:29:27,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's seriously what it looks like.

447
00:29:28,568 --> 00:29:30,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not really interested in the figure either.

448
00:29:30,689 --> 00:29:38,253
[SPEAKER_02]: And as the comments to the story, you know, even kind of, they're like, okay, seriously though, there's like no body armor in like the midriff there.

449
00:29:39,272 --> 00:29:42,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you could just shoot her in the boobs and she'd keel over.

450
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Does she have her ass cheeks?

451
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:48,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it have the assless suit on it?

452
00:29:49,757 --> 00:29:50,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

453
00:29:50,918 --> 00:29:51,818
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks kind of retarded.

454
00:29:51,838 --> 00:29:54,220
[SPEAKER_01]: The hell game have you people been playing?

455
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,521
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't you set your character as a female in Halo 3?

456
00:29:56,621 --> 00:29:58,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but she doesn't look like that.

457
00:29:58,582 --> 00:30:01,303
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it changes nothing in the main appearance.

458
00:30:02,024 --> 00:30:03,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, it's body armor.

459
00:30:03,724 --> 00:30:05,125
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unisex body armor.

460
00:30:05,365 --> 00:30:05,826
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

461
00:30:06,366 --> 00:30:06,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't need it.

462
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, do we remember Tex in Red vs. Blue?

463
00:30:09,954 --> 00:30:12,914
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really watch Red vs. Blue.

464
00:30:12,934 --> 00:30:13,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Red vs. Blue is great, Rob.

465
00:30:13,714 --> 00:30:16,835
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't watch it, because I don't get Halo jokes, because I'm not huge on Halo.

466
00:30:16,855 --> 00:30:17,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, it's great.

467
00:30:17,235 --> 00:30:18,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you watch everything that's great?

468
00:30:18,935 --> 00:30:19,555
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

469
00:30:19,675 --> 00:30:21,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't I be like everybody else?

470
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

471
00:30:23,036 --> 00:30:23,456
God.

472
00:30:24,076 --> 00:30:24,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways.

473
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't I be a robot instead of an alien?

474
00:30:27,557 --> 00:30:28,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Hero's joke, by the way.

475
00:30:28,957 --> 00:30:30,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you all saw it.

476
00:30:31,137 --> 00:30:31,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

477
00:30:31,437 --> 00:30:32,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone save this show, please.

478
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:34,158
[SPEAKER_02]: As good as the first episode.

479
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Forza 2 and Marvel Ultimate Alliance

480
00:30:56,547 --> 00:31:00,830
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be for both the premium system and for the elite system.

481
00:31:01,311 --> 00:31:06,174
[SPEAKER_02]: And both of those systems will be still the same prices that they are now, just you get two free games.

482
00:31:06,494 --> 00:31:06,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray.

483
00:31:08,716 --> 00:31:15,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, of course, the other new bit of info is that the core system is going to be discontinued.

484
00:31:16,162 --> 00:31:22,346
[SPEAKER_02]: And in its place is going to be the Xbox 360 Arcade SKU, which is going to have a 256 megabyte memory card, a

485
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:52,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Disc with 5 Xbox Live Arcade games including Boom Boom Rocket, Pac-Man Uno, Feeding Frenzy and Luxor 2 and it's going to have an HDMI out on it as well with a wireless controller all for $279.99 which I think is good that they're getting rid of the core because I know a big complaint I always hear is why would you get the core system you can't save your game

486
00:31:53,723 --> 00:31:54,383
[SPEAKER_02]: and now you can't.

487
00:31:54,403 --> 00:31:58,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you buy the core and then you buy a hard drive but then you might as well just buy a premium.

488
00:31:58,284 --> 00:31:59,284
[SPEAKER_02]: But at least this way you don't have to.

489
00:31:59,304 --> 00:32:01,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Right out of the box you can save your game.

490
00:32:01,765 --> 00:32:05,626
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think that because when I got my Xbox 360 that's what I had to do.

491
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:11,867
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought a core and then bought a hard drive because you couldn't get Xbox 360s like anywhere when they first came out.

492
00:32:11,907 --> 00:32:12,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that?

493
00:32:12,887 --> 00:32:15,488
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like Wii's a couple years ago you couldn't get them anywhere.

494
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:16,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.

495
00:32:17,128 --> 00:32:19,589
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course this is just a rumor right now.

496
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:24,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, but you know what we say about Microsoft rumors.

497
00:32:24,688 --> 00:32:25,308
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always true.

498
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:25,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

499
00:32:26,748 --> 00:32:29,709
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, pretty much all the time.

500
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:31,789
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, unless somebody completely pulls it out of their butt.

501
00:32:32,069 --> 00:32:32,810
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually, you know.

502
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:36,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually there's any sense of legitimacy to it whatsoever.

503
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:36,390
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true.

504
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:45,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go on a limb here and say back about a month ago when they showed that whole UK rumor, they actually had pictures to go along with it.

505
00:32:46,773 --> 00:32:51,274
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen pictures to go along with this stuff, so I'm going to take a wild guess and say that

506
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Pac-Man Fever Halo Fever

507
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:01,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Halo 3 Halo 3 Halo 3

508
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,056
[SPEAKER_01]: and then here he is on the TV.

509
00:33:33,176 --> 00:33:34,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, here I am.

510
00:33:35,537 --> 00:33:36,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody got caught.

511
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:42,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you wanted to also draw straws a little bit more, he probably wasn't over 18 either, or 17.

512
00:33:42,901 --> 00:33:43,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, not if he was nice.

513
00:33:43,862 --> 00:33:44,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, get this.

514
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:45,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's right.

515
00:33:45,963 --> 00:33:47,744
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't even get carded for the damn game.

516
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:53,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, because M is 17 or over, so he's probably okay.

517
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:55,640
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't say if he was a senior or what.

518
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,521
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll assume he's a senior.

519
00:33:56,861 --> 00:33:57,141
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

520
00:33:57,541 --> 00:34:05,366
[SPEAKER_01]: But he told the radio station KIRO that he was being feared that he would be put in detention or that other students would taunt him or whatever.

521
00:34:05,526 --> 00:34:10,490
[SPEAKER_01]: And he has no regrets about Halo Fever and says that meeting Bill Gates was the greatest moment of his life.

522
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:18,535
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find that kind of shocking that the school did not bust him and that the parents called him sick for him with this whole Halo thing.

523
00:34:18,775 --> 00:34:20,156
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, wasn't it?

524
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:21,212
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

525
00:34:21,572 --> 00:34:22,113
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

526
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:47,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, your BFF Bobby Blackwolf is in chat, Loki.

527
00:34:49,183 --> 00:34:52,065
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe Bobby was there from what I was reading in his LJ.

528
00:34:52,085 --> 00:34:53,666
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I have it all together.

529
00:34:53,726 --> 00:34:56,827
[SPEAKER_01]: But Blackwolf says he was not the first person in line.

530
00:34:56,867 --> 00:34:58,949
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the first person who was of age.

531
00:34:59,309 --> 00:35:01,810
[SPEAKER_01]: There were two people in front of him that were underage.

532
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,052
[SPEAKER_01]: They were skipped.

533
00:35:05,372 --> 00:35:06,413
[SPEAKER_01]: So then he was of age.

534
00:35:08,379 --> 00:35:09,540
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

535
00:35:35,312 --> 00:35:39,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I could tell you right now I'll probably be skipping work when Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out.

536
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:40,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Naughty Naughty!

537
00:35:41,658 --> 00:35:42,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

538
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:56,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamie, surely there must be a disciplinarian inside of you that thinks there's something wrong with this picture that he's not getting in trouble or his parents are not being mocked openly for basically lying for him for this Halo 3 thing.

539
00:35:57,053 --> 00:35:59,075
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that there was a necessity to lie.

540
00:35:59,813 --> 00:36:01,235
[SPEAKER_05]: So he stayed up past his bedtime.

541
00:36:16,733 --> 00:36:17,453
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn.

542
00:36:17,613 --> 00:36:18,654
[SPEAKER_02]: No dessert for a week.

543
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:36,521
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I had to go in to like band the next morning.

544
00:36:36,581 --> 00:36:37,682
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so tired.

545
00:36:38,422 --> 00:36:42,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I did take a week off of school to play Final Fantasy 3.

546
00:36:42,886 --> 00:36:46,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Was my mom going to call the school and say I was sick because I was playing video games too late?

547
00:36:46,569 --> 00:36:48,150
[SPEAKER_01]: She'd say, hell no.

548
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:48,971
[SPEAKER_01]: You did this.

549
00:36:49,151 --> 00:36:51,252
[SPEAKER_01]: You still got to go to school and you just suffer.

550
00:36:52,313 --> 00:36:52,553
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

551
00:36:53,954 --> 00:36:54,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on.

552
00:36:54,575 --> 00:36:55,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much time on this story.

553
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:56,456
[SPEAKER_01]: New story please.

554
00:36:58,798 --> 00:36:58,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

555
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:00,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

556
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Well.

557
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:01,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Well.

558
00:37:02,188 --> 00:37:29,740
[SPEAKER_05]: For anyone who was curious as to the details behind Bizarre and Activision, basically, it was actually quoted by their commercial director saying that they were trying to find a long-term partner association that they wanted to work on just making good games and not have to deal with the development side of everything.

559
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,981
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why they brought them in.

560
00:37:32,312 --> 00:37:33,673
[SPEAKER_02]: They made Hot Sweet Love.

561
00:37:34,274 --> 00:37:36,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they did, and hopefully we'll get a nice baby out of it.

562
00:37:38,578 --> 00:37:43,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Activision's been buying people up lately, because they took over Guitar Hero, too.

563
00:37:44,963 --> 00:37:45,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember?

564
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:46,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

565
00:37:46,585 --> 00:37:47,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Activision's got money.

566
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:49,307
[SPEAKER_02]: They bought Red Octane.

567
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:50,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Hurrah.

568
00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:51,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, sorta.

569
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, they bought them.

570
00:37:53,511 --> 00:37:54,072
[SPEAKER_01]: They acquired them.

571
00:37:54,812 --> 00:37:58,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, right now, though, as far as any upcoming releases, the only thing...

572
00:37:59,332 --> 00:38:00,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Project Gotham Racing 4

573
00:38:21,912 --> 00:38:27,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it will be probably put out by Activision or... Does that mean it's going to be multi-console?

574
00:38:27,937 --> 00:38:29,258
[SPEAKER_01]: PlayStation 3, Project Gotham 5?

575
00:38:30,038 --> 00:38:30,639
[SPEAKER_01]: How can this be?

576
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,240
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

577
00:38:33,241 --> 00:38:33,641
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

578
00:38:33,821 --> 00:38:37,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Project Gotham 5 will be developed by another studio.

579
00:38:38,825 --> 00:38:44,529
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, much like Guitar Hero now is being developed by someone else as well.

580
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:45,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways...

581
00:38:46,242 --> 00:38:58,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, something kinda cool, um, Tetris Splash is coming to Xbox Live Arcade, and, um, apparently, uh, it's gonna be Tetris all over again.

582
00:38:59,326 --> 00:39:11,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Hurrah, because if you didn't get your fill, was it Tetris, um, not Grandmaster, I don't know, the last Tetris game that came out, Evolution, whatever the fuck it was called, uh, well, you'll be able to play on live.

583
00:39:13,048 --> 00:39:25,005
[SPEAKER_02]: 4 players offline, 6 players over live, and lots of blocks in multi-colors and apparently a very creepy woman announcer

584
00:39:26,161 --> 00:39:27,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Hooray for creepy women announcers.

585
00:39:27,883 --> 00:39:35,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Boo for the fact I already bought Tetris on the Xbox 360 and probably paid way more for it than I should have, but I guess that's my own damn fault.

586
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:38,952
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that Tetris game called that was the disc version?

587
00:39:39,493 --> 00:39:40,434
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

588
00:39:40,614 --> 00:39:41,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously it wasn't memorable.

589
00:39:41,534 --> 00:39:44,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet another Tetris game now on 360, is that what it's called now?

590
00:39:44,897 --> 00:39:45,298
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.

591
00:39:45,658 --> 00:39:49,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean... Tetris and Pac-Man, seriously, stop...

592
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:51,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Making new games.

593
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just re-releasing your old games, I guess.

594
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:58,313
[SPEAKER_01]: So, like I said, they're moving it to another developer, much like Guitar Hero 3 moved to a different developer.

595
00:40:19,656 --> 00:40:21,419
[SPEAKER_01]: I said I got owned, not you got owned.

596
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:22,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

597
00:40:23,643 --> 00:40:24,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you did.

598
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Project Gotham Racing Project Gotham Racing Project Gotham Racing

599
00:40:50,803 --> 00:41:02,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the game because I played the original flat out over and over and over again, playing the ragdoll mode in it where you can just launch the driver through the windshield and do the high jump and stuff.

600
00:41:03,618 --> 00:41:09,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I just, I like breaking stuff and launching drivers through Windows and watching them get hurt.

601
00:41:09,883 --> 00:41:12,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Why, same reason I'm playing Jackass.

602
00:41:12,145 --> 00:41:13,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I noticed this theme here.

603
00:41:13,526 --> 00:41:16,788
[SPEAKER_01]: You enjoy Jackass the game, you enjoy launching people through Windows.

604
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:22,492
[SPEAKER_01]: I seem to remember there's that PlayStation Network game that's like a crazy guy that, you know, does, what was that called?

605
00:41:22,753 --> 00:41:23,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Best Pain or whatever?

606
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:24,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

607
00:41:24,094 --> 00:41:25,174
[SPEAKER_01]: That you were all giddy about.

608
00:41:25,194 --> 00:41:26,235
[SPEAKER_01]: See, you chuckle.

609
00:41:26,616 --> 00:41:29,798
[SPEAKER_01]: You chuckle like a little kid who's setting fire to things in the back of the class.

610
00:41:30,338 --> 00:41:31,519
[SPEAKER_02]: If only they had that game.

611
00:41:34,634 --> 00:41:41,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to the Classroom Pyro, the game coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

612
00:41:41,596 --> 00:41:45,578
[SPEAKER_01]: One game I enjoyed quite a bit more than the average person, and I'm not sure why.

613
00:41:45,658 --> 00:41:47,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just because I like Japanese role-playing games.

614
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:54,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe I have such a boner for Chrono Trigger that I was able to look past the fact that the game wasn't the greatest RPG of all time.

615
00:41:54,781 --> 00:41:56,262
[SPEAKER_01]: But it wasn't bad either.

616
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:57,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue Dragon.

617
00:41:58,297 --> 00:42:03,220
[SPEAKER_01]: and one thing that, you know, I was, one of the negatives I was seeing about Blue Dragon is that it's kind of easy.

618
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:11,043
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you just take the time to level up in the very beginning of the game, you're always two steps ahead of the enemies and only the boss fights really prove to be difficult.

619
00:42:11,084 --> 00:42:11,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, guess what?

620
00:42:12,944 --> 00:42:16,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue Dragon has come out and said, you don't think the game is hard enough?

621
00:42:16,606 --> 00:42:21,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's some free download content that will up the difficulty of the game.

622
00:42:21,569 --> 00:42:22,929
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't think the hard is game enough?

623
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:23,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.

624
00:42:25,077 --> 00:42:25,337
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

625
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:26,498
[SPEAKER_01]: We got covered you.

626
00:42:26,518 --> 00:42:28,579
[SPEAKER_02]: You were about to say that.

627
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:35,021
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just showing my translation skills from the Japanese text, original.

628
00:42:36,582 --> 00:42:39,983
[SPEAKER_01]: The Ultra Hard mod gives three new aspects to the game.

629
00:42:40,403 --> 00:42:44,705
[SPEAKER_01]: New Game Plus, or Game Plus, which is like, gee, they had this in Chrono Trigger.

630
00:42:45,165 --> 00:42:48,747
[SPEAKER_01]: You just start the game over again with all the stats that you had when you last ended.

631
00:42:49,047 --> 00:42:51,088
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also now Hard Mode, which is...

632
00:42:51,508 --> 00:42:52,729
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

633
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:20,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Clip or movie or something for beating it on one of these ultra hard modes.

634
00:43:20,542 --> 00:43:25,546
[SPEAKER_01]: But nope, you just get the satisfaction of knowing you're better than everybody else at a game no one seems to care about.

635
00:43:27,087 --> 00:43:28,228
[SPEAKER_01]: So congratulations to you.

636
00:43:28,929 --> 00:43:31,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't play a hard game, play Earth Defense Force 2017.

637
00:43:31,911 --> 00:43:37,736
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say though, I'm thankful that Microsoft is putting out, or I guess I shouldn't say Microsoft because the devs charge us.

638
00:43:37,756 --> 00:43:38,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft is putting out.

639
00:43:39,137 --> 00:43:40,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Microsoft is putting out quite well.

640
00:43:41,139 --> 00:43:45,042
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, the developers and Miss Walker and everybody is putting out the game

641
00:43:45,669 --> 00:43:47,771
[SPEAKER_01]: or the putting out the content for free.

642
00:43:47,831 --> 00:43:50,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I believe Microsoft did publish it themselves.

643
00:43:50,093 --> 00:43:51,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Mistwalker just developed it.

644
00:43:51,535 --> 00:43:54,017
[SPEAKER_01]: So they did decide to charge nothing for it.

645
00:43:54,337 --> 00:43:55,478
[SPEAKER_01]: So hooray for Microsoft.

646
00:43:55,538 --> 00:43:56,439
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for putting out.

647
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we like it when they put out.

648
00:43:59,742 --> 00:44:04,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of putting out, for the most recent...

649
00:44:05,721 --> 00:44:09,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Offering from Capcom in the Super Street Fighter 2 series.

650
00:44:10,164 --> 00:44:15,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Turbo Remix for MatchingService.com 4chan edition.

651
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:20,451
[SPEAKER_05]: They are having two characters confirmed.

652
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:25,674
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be Cammy and M. Bison, who in the Japanese version is Vega.

653
00:44:25,694 --> 00:44:28,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was supposed to be all the same people.

654
00:44:28,997 --> 00:44:30,918
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just making them all pretty.

655
00:44:32,702 --> 00:44:34,984
[SPEAKER_05]: They do look very high-def-y.

656
00:44:35,364 --> 00:44:36,365
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some pictures on here.

657
00:44:37,125 --> 00:44:38,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Not me with her humongous thighs.

658
00:44:39,207 --> 00:44:44,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, people are saying her humongous camel toe, but... Well, that's always been Cammy.

659
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:47,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Go Cammy!

660
00:44:50,456 --> 00:44:51,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that where she got her name from?

661
00:44:53,058 --> 00:44:53,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

662
00:44:54,758 --> 00:45:06,444
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you can't wait for Super Street Fighter 2 HD Remix, you can possibly find some other fun games at your local stores this week.

663
00:45:06,944 --> 00:45:12,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Including, if you happen to be a fan of basketball games, well, there's going to be plenty of them.

664
00:45:13,427 --> 00:45:22,411
[SPEAKER_02]: With both NBA Live 08, NBA 2K8, and NBA 08 coming out this week on the 2nd of October.

665
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:38,314
[SPEAKER_02]: and, of course, Live and 2K will both be on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, the 360, and then, of course, Live being on the Wii, making its first basketball game appearance, and, of course, on the PSP as well.

666
00:45:38,954 --> 00:45:40,315
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, let's see here.

667
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:49,723
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not a fan of basketball games, then maybe you're a fan of some of the other games from NVIDIA, including Crash of the Titans and...

668
00:45:51,100 --> 00:46:07,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Spiro, or Legend of Spiro, The Eternal Night and those are supposed to be coming out on PlayStation 2 for both and then of course on Crash PlayStation or Xbox 360 and the Wii DS and Game Boy Advance

669
00:46:08,564 --> 00:46:14,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Then on PSP, a kind of crappy rip-off of WarioWare.

670
00:46:14,926 --> 00:46:19,027
[SPEAKER_02]: HotPixel is coming to that system on the 2nd.

671
00:46:19,567 --> 00:46:28,649
[SPEAKER_02]: What's funny, though, is when they released it over here, they decided to spell out Pixel, P-I-X-E-L, instead of just the P-X-L, as it was in other regions.

672
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:34,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, most systems, Spider-Man Friend or Foe,

673
00:46:35,589 --> 00:46:36,770
[SPEAKER_02]: MLB Power Pros DS Jackass The Game

674
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:02,022
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, on PSP, Syphon Filter.

675
00:47:02,042 --> 00:47:04,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I want to know how you use the touch screen and jackass the game?

676
00:47:04,843 --> 00:47:05,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that sounds kind of scary.

677
00:47:06,203 --> 00:47:07,904
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but it'll be interesting.

678
00:47:07,924 --> 00:47:10,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, then some smaller games here.

679
00:47:10,524 --> 00:47:14,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, okay, well, maybe not a smaller game, but Legend of Zelda, The Phantom Hourglass is coming out this week.

680
00:47:15,486 --> 00:47:19,247
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually might already be out if, you know, you happen to be at the Nintendo World Store.

681
00:47:20,187 --> 00:47:25,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, other stuff coming out on the Wii this week, uh, Dave Mirra's BMX Challenge, which is crap.

682
00:47:26,649 --> 00:47:26,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

683
00:47:27,967 --> 00:47:50,889
[SPEAKER_02]: and then of course the DS also has Race Driver, Create and Race, Kurupoto, Cool Cool Stars, Crayola Treasure Adventures, Arctic Tail, all which sound kind of crappy, and let's see here, Backyard Football, 08, Master Jinjin's IQ Challenge, Paws and Claws, Dogs and Cats,

684
00:47:52,062 --> 00:48:03,806
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the PC, of course, all sorts of random stuff, including a brand new Tycoon game Because what would it be without a new Tycoon game almost every single week?

685
00:48:04,567 --> 00:48:13,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Rock Tour Tycoon Man, they're really drawing in straws now Scraping the bottom of the barrel Sounds like fun

686
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:18,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and flat-out Ultimate Carnage on Xbox 360, as I mentioned earlier.

687
00:48:19,132 --> 00:48:23,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo Maniac64 says, I want to see Jackass Wii, where you throw Wiimotes.

688
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:26,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, maybe it just puts a big target on your TV and you're encouraged to destroy it.

689
00:48:26,855 --> 00:48:29,256
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got some weird little games in that.

690
00:48:29,376 --> 00:48:37,440
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is the Elephant Poo Dive, where you're diving off of a skyscraper into a big bucket of elephant poo.

691
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know how to sell a game.

692
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,881
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they've got another one where you're rolling down a...

693
00:48:44,102 --> 00:48:47,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Ski Slope, kind of like Katamari and you're rolling over things.

694
00:48:48,485 --> 00:48:49,685
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got a bunch of fun stuff in there.

695
00:48:50,326 --> 00:48:51,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely worth a rental at least.

696
00:48:52,727 --> 00:48:53,208
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's cheap.

697
00:48:57,570 --> 00:49:01,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, moving on, going to the Japanese release date.

698
00:49:01,072 --> 00:49:09,497
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a huge week in Japan, but if you've been sitting around Japan, you've been going, God damn, I want a new Dragon Ball Z fighting game.

699
00:49:09,537 --> 00:49:10,298
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's just...

700
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:13,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Not enough Dragon Ball Z fighting games out there on the market.

701
00:49:13,863 --> 00:49:21,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, shit, you're in luck this week because on the Nintendo Wii, Dragon Ball Z Sparkling Meteor is coming out on the Nintendo Wii.

702
00:49:21,974 --> 00:49:23,676
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that's on the PlayStation 2 as well.

703
00:49:24,257 --> 00:49:25,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Sparkling Meteor.

704
00:49:25,518 --> 00:49:28,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God that those don't come over at the same subtitles.

705
00:49:29,161 --> 00:49:29,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

706
00:49:52,421 --> 00:49:53,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Famicom

707
00:50:15,307 --> 00:50:17,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Guitar Hero over there, and I don't think they're getting Rock Band.

708
00:50:18,088 --> 00:50:20,290
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what you get in Japan instead.

709
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:22,791
[SPEAKER_01]: You get Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.

710
00:50:23,691 --> 00:50:27,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Of which I have not played V3 or V4 in the arcades at all.

711
00:50:27,453 --> 00:50:31,035
[SPEAKER_01]: I played V2, which was pretty much the same game.

712
00:50:31,335 --> 00:50:35,518
[SPEAKER_02]: If you will, imagine V2, but instead of a 2, there's a 4 there.

713
00:50:36,198 --> 00:50:37,599
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll be pretty damn close.

714
00:50:37,699 --> 00:50:38,259
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, alright.

715
00:50:38,759 --> 00:50:39,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.

716
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:39,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Smartass.

717
00:50:40,498 --> 00:50:41,739
[SPEAKER_01]: What if there's good songs, though?

718
00:50:41,779 --> 00:50:44,602
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, those games are only as good as the songs or whatever.

719
00:50:45,103 --> 00:50:45,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it.

720
00:50:45,824 --> 00:50:46,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

721
00:50:46,825 --> 00:50:53,512
[SPEAKER_01]: A chibi little baseball game on the PlayStation 2 called Jikuyu Powerful Pro Major League 2 is coming out.

722
00:50:53,992 --> 00:50:57,997
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like if the cast of Worms starred in a baseball game, that's what you'd get.

723
00:50:58,157 --> 00:51:00,059
[SPEAKER_01]: That's MLB Power Pros over here.

724
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:01,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?

725
00:51:01,479 --> 00:51:02,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Koharu no DS Ushigohan Shokuji Balance Guide Suki

726
00:51:18,232 --> 00:51:20,094
[SPEAKER_01]: and this... What the hell do you do?

727
00:51:20,174 --> 00:51:23,276
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a game where you put in what you've been eating.

728
00:51:23,837 --> 00:51:25,058
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows you little pictures of food.

729
00:51:25,118 --> 00:51:25,738
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nutritional guide.

730
00:51:26,038 --> 00:51:31,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it shows you how many grams of fat and how many K-cals you're eating and all that good stuff.

731
00:51:32,063 --> 00:51:33,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing, real quick.

732
00:51:34,245 --> 00:51:37,307
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a smart idea to bring something like that out over here, actually.

733
00:51:37,787 --> 00:51:40,670
[SPEAKER_01]: There's enough people that own DSs that would be interested in that.

734
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:44,693
[SPEAKER_02]: That Crimson and Black DS ain't only coming out in Japan.

735
00:51:45,313 --> 00:51:45,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?

736
00:51:45,774 --> 00:51:46,034
[SPEAKER_02]: This week.

737
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,081
[SPEAKER_01]: On the PSP, Gundam Battle Chronicle On the PSP

738
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:17,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Mina no Golf Ba Volume 3, which I believe, isn't that just their hot shots over there?

739
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:24,875
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Shin Sangoku Mosu, Dynasty Warriors, goes into the best hits on the PSP.

740
00:52:25,295 --> 00:52:28,377
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're a fan of Dynasty Warriors, price cut, enjoy that.

741
00:52:28,497 --> 00:52:29,638
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your Japanese release dates.

742
00:52:30,339 --> 00:52:32,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Horribly butchered pronunciations, courtesy of me.

743
00:52:33,941 --> 00:52:34,482
[SPEAKER_01]: How about Europe?

744
00:52:35,543 --> 00:52:38,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there is some, well, a little fun.

745
00:52:39,269 --> 00:52:42,273
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Hour of Victory on PC, NBA 08.

746
00:52:42,734 --> 00:52:46,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Hour of Victory comes out on the first, NBA 08 comes out on the second.

747
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,021
[SPEAKER_05]: A bunch of stuff for the fifth.

748
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:52,488
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Blitzkrieg 2 Liberation, Cookie and Cream on DS.

749
00:52:53,038 --> 00:53:11,307
[SPEAKER_05]: CSI 3, Dimensions of Murder and then CSI Hard Evidence on PC and Xbox 360 Dead and Furious on DS Deadhead Fred on PSP Final Fantasy Tactics, The War of Lions on PSP, Glory Days 2 Brotherhood of Men NFL 08 and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 Hooray

750
00:53:16,189 --> 00:53:16,429
[SPEAKER_02]: PS3, PS4, PS5, PS6

751
00:53:27,139 --> 00:53:28,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Which will also probably come true.

752
00:53:29,279 --> 00:53:36,641
[SPEAKER_02]: One of which is going to be that the FCC has filed a... Or had a filing for a brand new PlayStation 3 model.

753
00:53:37,601 --> 00:53:40,462
[SPEAKER_02]: And no word on what it is yet.

754
00:53:40,602 --> 00:53:46,523
[SPEAKER_02]: But most likely it's going to be that 40 gig system that just... That rumor won't die.

755
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,363
[SPEAKER_02]: That one that's supposed to be coming out for $399 or $299.

756
00:53:48,803 --> 00:53:50,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on who you're talking to.

757
00:53:50,384 --> 00:53:50,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

758
00:53:53,897 --> 00:54:00,041
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently, the specifications for it so far, it will have Wi-Fi, obviously it's going to have Bluetooth, etc.

759
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:03,243
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're identical to the other PlayStation 3 models right now.

760
00:54:03,384 --> 00:54:09,688
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's not going to be like the 20-gig system where it doesn't have any, you know, Wi-Fi or stuff like that.

761
00:54:09,848 --> 00:54:13,631
[SPEAKER_02]: But, still though, it's coming.

762
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:19,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether Sony, you know, admits to it or not, it will be coming soon.

763
00:54:19,555 --> 00:54:23,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you that you're going to get an announcement probably any day.

764
00:54:26,624 --> 00:54:27,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times.

765
00:54:31,687 --> 00:54:44,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Coinciding with the same thing where they had one of those, it was the Blu-ray deals that they have going on right now for the PlayStation 3 where you buy the system and get five Blu-ray movies.

766
00:54:44,473 --> 00:54:48,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that also had the same new SKU number on there as well.

767
00:54:48,775 --> 00:54:51,356
[SPEAKER_02]: So that at least confirms that there will be a new SKU.

768
00:54:51,757 --> 00:54:59,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it be a 40-gig system or God knows what other size hard drive they're going to throw in with it, there is a new SKU coming.

769
00:55:00,161 --> 00:55:00,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

770
00:55:02,153 --> 00:55:02,493
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

771
00:55:03,534 --> 00:55:10,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Kaz Hirai has commented recently on the PlayStation 3, saying, The PlayStation original price was just right.

772
00:55:10,381 --> 00:55:11,001
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, nah, nah.

773
00:55:11,081 --> 00:55:16,186
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no regrets about releasing this for such a high cost, even if everybody seems to have a problem with it.

774
00:55:16,426 --> 00:55:19,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you have no regrets for nobody buying it.

775
00:55:19,269 --> 00:55:19,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, hold on.

776
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:21,792
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not exactly what he said.

777
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:22,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, here's a quote.

778
00:55:23,093 --> 00:55:25,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Quote, The PS3 has been on the market less than a year in the U.S.

779
00:55:25,575 --> 00:55:26,056
[SPEAKER_01]: and Japan.

780
00:55:26,096 --> 00:55:26,536
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is it?

781
00:55:26,596 --> 00:55:27,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Less than that in Europe?

782
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:29,933
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that because he doesn't even know.

783
00:55:30,413 --> 00:55:32,275
[SPEAKER_01]: It's difficult right now to say who's where.

784
00:55:32,815 --> 00:55:39,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly, we've never started from a position of strength, and we've always had to catch up with every generation of hardware that we've brought into the market.

785
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:44,384
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, interesting point that I think back to the PlayStation 1, and that is kind of true, what he's saying.

786
00:55:44,685 --> 00:55:49,929
[SPEAKER_01]: But I seem to recall with the PlayStation 2, they were kind of the big deal right out the gate.

787
00:55:50,049 --> 00:55:51,150
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they ever really...

788
00:55:51,770 --> 00:56:01,085
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know, maybe you'd know more about Dreamcast versus PlayStation 2, Jamie, but I seem to recall, you know, as much as we love Sega, I think Sony was always whooping their ass from the get-go, weren't they?

789
00:56:01,726 --> 00:56:02,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly.

790
00:56:02,407 --> 00:56:03,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so, you know...

791
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:12,879
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, we also, over here, we had to deal with the problems of coming back from the Saturn versus the PlayStation, as you'll recall.

792
00:56:13,399 --> 00:56:18,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Over here, the Saturn didn't have the proper support to make it the big machine like it was in Japan.

793
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:21,663
[SPEAKER_05]: In Japan, they had all of the 2D games.

794
00:56:21,883 --> 00:56:23,544
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the best stuff came out on Saturn.

795
00:56:23,564 --> 00:56:24,284
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't know.

796
00:56:24,304 --> 00:56:25,724
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is just excuses, though.

797
00:56:25,744 --> 00:56:32,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you think about it, their whole thing is, well, we haven't been out as long as the 360, so that's why we haven't sold as many units.

798
00:56:33,449 --> 00:56:36,712
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you still have not figured out why you haven't sold that many units yet.

799
00:56:36,892 --> 00:56:39,374
[SPEAKER_02]: And that fact right there is scary as it is.

800
00:56:39,554 --> 00:56:46,039
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't figure out why your system's not selling, I mean, dude, it's your fucking price.

801
00:56:46,299 --> 00:56:49,282
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's why the Panasonic 3DO didn't take off, because it was $700.

802
00:56:49,642 --> 00:56:52,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what Rob was asking.

803
00:56:53,205 --> 00:56:55,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, quick, name one game on the 3DO.

804
00:56:56,067 --> 00:56:56,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Five.

805
00:56:56,467 --> 00:56:56,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Road Rash.

806
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:57,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Four.

807
00:56:58,329 --> 00:57:00,210
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had You Don't Know Jack.

808
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:01,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember playing that game.

809
00:57:02,253 --> 00:57:03,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to what Rob asked.

810
00:57:03,034 --> 00:57:05,295
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet most people wouldn't have passed that challenge.

811
00:57:05,415 --> 00:57:05,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

812
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:14,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that part of the reason why the Dreamcast didn't take off so well over here was just coming off of the American failure of the Saturn.

813
00:57:15,161 --> 00:57:19,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Because overseas, it was the shit.

814
00:57:19,284 --> 00:57:21,105
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I imported all my games on Saturn.

815
00:57:23,307 --> 00:57:25,408
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Dreamcast, to me...

816
00:57:26,169 --> 00:57:27,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Saga's Place as far as systems go

817
00:57:40,103 --> 00:57:48,412
[SPEAKER_05]: and then they've just turned it right around because I honestly think that they're looking into the actual thing that gamers want instead of the thing they think gamers want.

818
00:57:48,612 --> 00:57:49,613
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

819
00:57:49,633 --> 00:58:02,547
[SPEAKER_02]: If they want to catch up, they need to put out the $3.99 SKU and then they need to start putting out some better games because I think with that price point being in place, people will be more likely to buy the system, developers will be more likely to make games for it, etc.

820
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:09,136
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting you bring that up, that whole Microsoft took Sega's place thing, because then you even put... I've thought the same thing, actually.

821
00:58:09,556 --> 00:58:16,502
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of interesting, because you even throw that Peter Moore thing, because he was with the Dreamcast, and then he did the... He's not with Microsoft anymore, but he was definitely a big part of 360.

822
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:20,106
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it even more eerie, that whole comparison.

823
00:58:21,307 --> 00:58:21,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

824
00:58:22,648 --> 00:58:24,128
[SPEAKER_01]: We can move on with the news now, sorry.

825
00:58:24,208 --> 00:58:25,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Just random sidebars.

826
00:58:25,909 --> 00:58:26,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, can I?

827
00:58:26,869 --> 00:58:27,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

828
00:58:27,289 --> 00:58:29,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, maybe I should go to the chat and see what's going on in chat.

829
00:58:31,771 --> 00:58:32,811
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry if I mispronounce this.

830
00:58:32,851 --> 00:58:33,991
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either Wet2 or We2.

831
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:34,431
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's We2.

832
00:58:34,471 --> 00:58:35,812
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no A in it, though.

833
00:58:35,832 --> 00:58:40,093
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Dreamcast sold really well in New Zealand, but PlayStation 2 killed it.

834
00:58:41,753 --> 00:58:44,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Misty said, I never got PlayStation 2 until DDR.

835
00:58:44,494 --> 00:58:50,696
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I recall correctly, I got my PlayStation 2 at the same mall GameStop that I got my little DS Lite bundle at.

836
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:54,081
[SPEAKER_01]: BlackWolf says, wasn't Tempest 2000 on the 3DO?

837
00:58:54,541 --> 00:58:55,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Jaguar.

838
00:58:55,482 --> 00:58:57,462
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the only game worth getting on the Jaguar.

839
00:58:58,223 --> 00:58:59,563
[SPEAKER_05]: There was another one on Jaguar.

840
00:58:59,583 --> 00:59:01,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, one other Jaguar game.

841
00:59:03,265 --> 00:59:07,486
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it was all about... And now you can get Tempest 2000 on damn near everything else.

842
00:59:07,826 --> 00:59:12,108
[SPEAKER_01]: MrDeBucket says, Peter Moore says, 9-9 of 99 is still the biggest day in media history.

843
00:59:12,168 --> 00:59:12,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck Halo 3.

844
00:59:14,069 --> 00:59:17,510
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, because the MTV Music Awards were on 9-9 of 99, weren't they?

845
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:19,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I was sitting in line for my Dreamcast.

846
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:20,850
[SPEAKER_01]: We can move on.

847
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:21,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, let's move on.

848
00:59:23,152 --> 00:59:27,415
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I was doing, except for when I ran over and bought a book and then came back and waited in line.

849
00:59:27,435 --> 00:59:31,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, BlackWolf says 3DO, Jaguar, same thing.

850
00:59:31,938 --> 00:59:34,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, compare the controllers sometime.

851
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,703
[SPEAKER_01]: The Jaguar came with a dictionary for a controller.

852
00:59:39,048 --> 00:59:40,690
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

853
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:04,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the Steel Battalion Controller is freaking awesomeness.

854
01:00:04,313 --> 01:00:07,035
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one eject button short of a Steel Battalion Controller.

855
01:00:07,135 --> 01:00:07,836
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it was.

856
01:00:07,936 --> 01:00:11,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I bought my husband a Steel Battalion Controller for his birthday.

857
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:11,479
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

858
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm the best wife ever.

859
01:00:13,961 --> 01:00:15,903
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, chat room, please stop derailing the show.

860
01:00:16,183 --> 01:00:16,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, please.

861
01:00:16,724 --> 01:00:17,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamie, let's move on with the news.

862
01:00:18,485 --> 01:00:19,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

863
01:00:20,307 --> 01:00:27,273
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a recent FCC filing for a 40 gigabyte PS3, and Sony isn't saying crap about it.

864
01:00:27,953 --> 01:00:28,574
[SPEAKER_05]: They are...

865
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Really not saying crap about it.

866
01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:33,102
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see any statements, no nothing.

867
01:00:35,344 --> 01:00:37,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're like, oh shit, not again.

868
01:00:38,826 --> 01:00:44,269
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no 40 gig system, just like there was no PSP Slim, or no rumbling controllers.

869
01:00:46,771 --> 01:00:49,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at any rate, it's there.

870
01:00:49,933 --> 01:00:51,654
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not saying anything, end of story.

871
01:00:54,376 --> 01:00:55,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Or no 80 gig system.

872
01:00:55,697 --> 01:00:56,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

873
01:00:56,857 --> 01:00:57,397
[SPEAKER_05]: I've taken it.

874
01:00:57,817 --> 01:00:58,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I already got mine.

875
01:00:59,318 --> 01:01:02,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does it seem like the hard drive is the only thing that freaking changes on that system?

876
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:03,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you don't get it.

877
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, people must not like it because it doesn't have a large enough hard drive.

878
01:01:06,422 --> 01:01:08,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, put something for me to put on the hard drive.

879
01:01:08,803 --> 01:01:09,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Bigger is better, Rob.

880
01:01:10,143 --> 01:01:10,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well.

881
01:01:10,464 --> 01:01:12,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Rob, you know you can convert your videos over.

882
01:01:13,005 --> 01:01:15,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait, but there isn't really an easy way to do that.

883
01:01:15,206 --> 01:01:16,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and they don't really tell you how to.

884
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Next story, I'm angry.

885
01:01:18,347 --> 01:01:18,868
Sorry.

886
01:01:19,868 --> 01:01:21,149
[SPEAKER_02]: I use it for putting videos on there.

887
01:01:21,249 --> 01:01:23,950
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a copy of Kung Pao on there.

888
01:01:25,191 --> 01:01:26,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoop-de-frickin-do.

889
01:01:26,472 --> 01:01:27,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Kung Kao's an awesome movie.

890
01:01:27,912 --> 01:01:28,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't talk bad about it.

891
01:01:29,473 --> 01:01:30,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve Odekirk needs to fucking make a sequel.

892
01:01:31,193 --> 01:01:31,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

893
01:01:32,654 --> 01:01:35,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody linked a picture of the Jaguar controller in chat.

894
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:38,776
[SPEAKER_01]: How is that thing supposed to... That's like an original Xbox controller, okay?

895
01:01:38,796 --> 01:01:41,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you have to have, like, gorilla hands to be able to hold that thing.

896
01:01:41,417 --> 01:01:42,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Gorilla hands.

897
01:01:43,135 --> 01:01:52,146
[SPEAKER_05]: See, with it being that big, it makes one sort of wonder about the Saturn Dual Analog Controller, but that one is one of the single most comfortable controllers ever.

898
01:01:52,386 --> 01:01:54,769
[SPEAKER_01]: And they wonder why the Xbox didn't sell in Japan.

899
01:01:55,658 --> 01:02:00,901
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you need like three Japanese hands to hold the Xbox.

900
01:02:00,961 --> 01:02:05,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I will point out to you that when they released the Xbox in Japan, it did have a smaller controller.

901
01:02:05,443 --> 01:02:06,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Which they released here.

902
01:02:07,084 --> 01:02:10,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I made Dan buy me because, I'm sorry, look at these short fingers.

903
01:02:10,386 --> 01:02:11,406
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not have gorilla hands.

904
01:02:11,486 --> 01:02:12,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at my fingers.

905
01:02:12,527 --> 01:02:13,988
[SPEAKER_01]: You have petite little girly hands.

906
01:02:15,108 --> 01:02:22,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyways, so it's been confirmed the price of Rock Band, and a date for Rock Band has been announced.

907
01:02:22,754 --> 01:02:27,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Rock Band will come out on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on Black Friday.

908
01:02:28,019 --> 01:02:36,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, EA, for $170, and of course that is the bundle, which is going to include both...

909
01:02:37,966 --> 01:02:42,329
[SPEAKER_02]: A guitar, a drum set, microphone, and the game.

910
01:02:42,409 --> 01:02:52,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the game by itself will also be available for $60 in case you just want to play the guitar version and own a guitar from Guitar Hero.

911
01:02:53,877 --> 01:02:58,740
[SPEAKER_02]: However, what is kind of new is they announced that there will be a PlayStation 2 version for the low, low price of $160.

912
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:59,060
[SPEAKER_02]: You save $10 and...

913
01:03:03,143 --> 01:03:05,084
[SPEAKER_02]: That is coming out on December 10th.

914
01:03:05,584 --> 01:03:07,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we'll feature these same things as well.

915
01:03:08,465 --> 01:03:11,306
[SPEAKER_02]: What I find interesting is that they came out with a PlayStation 2 version.

916
01:03:11,906 --> 01:03:15,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Something tells me it's because they like money.

917
01:03:15,808 --> 01:03:17,348
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to play Rock Band last week.

918
01:03:17,428 --> 01:03:17,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it worth it?

919
01:03:18,629 --> 01:03:19,429
[SPEAKER_02]: For that price?

920
01:03:19,569 --> 01:03:20,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think so.

921
01:03:20,149 --> 01:03:20,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to buy it for $200.

922
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:22,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

923
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:25,671
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll come over and play yours because I don't feel like dropping that kind of money on a video game.

924
01:03:26,751 --> 01:03:28,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hopefully you'll get a pretty decent discount.

925
01:03:29,099 --> 01:03:32,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish they would send me a copy for free I'll buy the game itself

926
01:03:34,507 --> 01:04:00,915
[SPEAKER_01]: for a game I'll play once and you know it I'm only going to play it like once probably because you know we don't have people over all the time I don't see my roommate being somebody where I'm going to be all like hey let's bust out Rock Band and get down it's a party game it's a total party game speaking of Guitar Hero 2 whatever fucking happened to their effector pedal or something that was going to be added later on I built one of those effector pedals and now it's for nothing

927
01:04:01,607 --> 01:04:02,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Haha.

928
01:04:02,407 --> 01:04:03,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Very disappointing.

929
01:04:03,248 --> 01:04:05,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that it cost me any money to do that, but, you know.

930
01:04:05,849 --> 01:04:06,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Still, very disappointing.

931
01:04:07,089 --> 01:04:07,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it works, too.

932
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:10,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Except it doesn't do anything.

933
01:04:11,111 --> 01:04:11,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

934
01:04:12,712 --> 01:04:14,692
[SPEAKER_02]: So, no, I think it's going to be worth it.

935
01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:20,015
[SPEAKER_02]: The big thing for me, I think, is going to be to see whether people are going to pay $170 for this game or not.

936
01:04:20,355 --> 01:04:20,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I will.

937
01:04:22,536 --> 01:04:23,236
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

938
01:04:23,476 --> 01:04:25,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's going to be big.

939
01:04:25,637 --> 01:04:27,058
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely going to sell very well.

940
01:04:27,078 --> 01:04:29,098
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, are people going to pay $170 for a game?

941
01:04:31,109 --> 01:04:34,691
[SPEAKER_02]: and if so, then we're going to see a bunch more.

942
01:04:34,811 --> 01:04:38,293
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is going to be a huge party game.

943
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:51,922
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally see this as the kind of thing that people who have big families or people that host parties regularly or it's going to become like the we're going to have this at a fundraiser or have rock band there because Guitar Hero is already like that.

944
01:04:52,382 --> 01:04:57,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, oh, we're going to have a fundraiser, you know, we're going to have a bake sale slash car wash.

945
01:04:57,384 --> 01:04:59,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Guitar Hero's going to be there, you know, like, I don't know.

946
01:04:59,324 --> 01:05:04,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I the only one that ever notices that Guitar Hero seems to turn up at these random charity events you see advertised?

947
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:05,947
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be Rock Band.

948
01:05:06,547 --> 01:05:08,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, it's cool, I guess.

949
01:05:09,168 --> 01:05:11,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I'm not knocking Rock Band.

950
01:05:11,409 --> 01:05:13,349
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a lot of money to drop on a game.

951
01:05:13,489 --> 01:05:16,550
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, and I don't know.

952
01:05:17,911 --> 01:05:19,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you have me waving on it now.

953
01:05:20,592 --> 01:05:20,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.

954
01:05:22,462 --> 01:05:24,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry EA, sorry Harmonix.

955
01:05:24,964 --> 01:05:28,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Well then let's go to the next story before Loki changes his mind completely.

956
01:05:28,385 --> 01:05:32,828
[SPEAKER_01]: The PlayStation.com shopping service is closing in Japan.

957
01:05:33,328 --> 01:05:38,311
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, in December it will be ending the site's e-commerce services.

958
01:05:38,551 --> 01:05:40,932
[SPEAKER_01]: And the service will be coming to a complete halt in February 2008.

959
01:05:41,933 --> 01:05:45,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Now while at first glance this might seem like doom and gloom for the PlayStation...

960
01:05:46,215 --> 01:05:51,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so, because PlayStation.com was for providing downloadable content for the PlayStation 2.

961
01:05:52,177 --> 01:05:56,018
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you guys all know, it's all about the PlayStation 3 now and the PlayStation Network.

962
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:57,899
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 2 had downloadable content?

963
01:05:58,039 --> 01:05:59,199
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess in Japan, yeah.

964
01:05:59,239 --> 01:06:01,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you get the PlayStation Points.

965
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:07,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, anyway, if you still have PlayStation Points, you can transfer those over to your PlayStation 3 wallet.

966
01:06:09,602 --> 01:06:10,883
[SPEAKER_01]: They always get better stuff in Japan.

967
01:06:10,923 --> 01:06:12,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello?

968
01:06:13,104 --> 01:06:13,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Where have you been?

969
01:06:14,184 --> 01:06:14,564
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

970
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:40,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for anyone who also has been keeping up with more of the downloadable content for PS3, especially for our European fans, well, I should say fans of the system, well, Sony is pulling their Gran Turismo HD concept from the Japanese store, and it's not probably coming out in Europe at all.

971
01:06:41,516 --> 01:06:45,978
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been no announcement, no nothing, they're just not getting it.

972
01:06:46,838 --> 01:06:47,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

973
01:06:47,856 --> 01:06:56,178
[SPEAKER_05]: But now there's a Gran Turismo 5 prologue that will be coming out, but there's no date for it in the UK yet.

974
01:06:57,058 --> 01:07:08,400
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of a bitch move, I think, that they're actually getting rid of the free version of Gran Turismo on there before the paid demo, I guess, comes out.

975
01:07:09,301 --> 01:07:13,582
[SPEAKER_02]: So, well, if you have a PS3 now, might as well download it, put it on your hard drive.

976
01:07:13,602 --> 01:07:15,582
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, honestly...

977
01:07:16,451 --> 01:07:18,172
[SPEAKER_02]: What else are you going to fill that hard drive with?

978
01:07:19,653 --> 01:07:20,613
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a bad game.

979
01:07:21,153 --> 01:07:22,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's good for a demo.

980
01:07:23,054 --> 01:07:24,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't see myself paying 50 bucks.

981
01:07:25,315 --> 01:07:29,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see myself paying 50 bucks for Gran Turismo 5 Prolog.

982
01:07:30,057 --> 01:07:32,459
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you, put porn on the PlayStation Network.

983
01:07:32,879 --> 01:07:35,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Sony will start outselling Microsoft consoles tomorrow.

984
01:07:36,861 --> 01:07:37,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark my words.

985
01:07:40,562 --> 01:07:41,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, don't mark my words.

986
01:07:41,603 --> 01:07:42,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Read another story.

987
01:07:43,063 --> 01:07:44,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark my words.

988
01:07:44,664 --> 01:07:45,925
[SPEAKER_02]: You will perish.

989
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:47,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

990
01:07:47,257 --> 01:07:48,157
[SPEAKER_02]: The fuck was that?

991
01:07:48,257 --> 01:07:48,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

992
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:49,478
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounded funny.

993
01:07:50,638 --> 01:07:51,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you need some fresh air, Loki?

994
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:52,518
[SPEAKER_01]: You feeling okay?

995
01:07:52,538 --> 01:07:53,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you had your meds?

996
01:07:53,078 --> 01:07:53,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm feeling fine.

997
01:07:53,478 --> 01:07:54,639
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to drive from Oakland.

998
01:07:54,679 --> 01:07:55,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm feeling tingle fresh.

999
01:07:59,360 --> 01:07:59,940
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, folks.

1000
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:00,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark my words!

1001
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:02,080
[SPEAKER_02]: You will pay for that!

1002
01:08:02,941 --> 01:08:03,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

1003
01:08:03,561 --> 01:08:05,661
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, kids, don't forget to buy the Eye of Judgment.

1004
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:06,681
[SPEAKER_01]: We only have to sell a million.

1005
01:08:09,382 --> 01:08:11,242
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know what I'm talking about, listen to last week's show.

1006
01:08:11,923 --> 01:08:12,863
[SPEAKER_02]: It will never happen.

1007
01:08:13,323 --> 01:08:13,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Never.

1008
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:15,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Story!

1009
01:08:15,961 --> 01:08:21,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so, in Europe, PlayStation 3 is getting yet another bundle.

1010
01:08:22,165 --> 01:08:25,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Not surprising, though, it's going to be bundled with Pro Evolution Soccer 2008.

1011
01:08:26,288 --> 01:08:29,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's coming in November.

1012
01:08:31,653 --> 01:08:32,813
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all there is to say.

1013
01:08:33,474 --> 01:08:37,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was confirmed by PlayStation France, and...

1014
01:08:39,059 --> 01:08:48,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, that's, I mean, that's logical, you know, sports bundles are nothing uncommon, and certainly in Europe, a soccer bundle's gonna sell some systems, so, you know, makes sense.

1015
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:49,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly!

1016
01:08:50,245 --> 01:08:54,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, remember that really crappy one that they did for, I think it was Pro Evo 2007?

1017
01:08:55,268 --> 01:08:55,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

1018
01:08:56,409 --> 01:08:57,870
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, like, with AstroTurf on the 360?

1019
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:58,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1020
01:09:00,711 --> 01:09:02,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, it came with AstroTurf?

1021
01:09:02,172 --> 01:09:02,412
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

1022
01:09:02,712 --> 01:09:06,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they did, like, it was a auction thing where they were selling it.

1023
01:09:06,334 --> 01:09:06,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

1024
01:09:06,414 --> 01:09:07,255
[SPEAKER_02]: They had AstroTurf.

1025
01:09:07,275 --> 01:09:07,355
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1026
01:09:07,942 --> 01:09:08,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1027
01:09:25,996 --> 01:09:30,857
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a brand new Kingdom Reborn update, which I think we reported on previously in the program.

1028
01:09:31,157 --> 01:09:34,738
[SPEAKER_01]: It's free to download for the previous subscribers through October 9th.

1029
01:09:35,578 --> 01:09:39,639
[SPEAKER_01]: But however, there's also now the Return to Britannia campaign that's going on.

1030
01:09:40,419 --> 01:09:50,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Electronic Arts is doing a monster hunt and prizes such as a new pendant necklace, a whole map of Britannia that you can win, a commemorative sculpture, armor set, all this stuff.

1031
01:09:50,941 --> 01:09:54,762
[SPEAKER_01]: The characters in game get fireworks and 10 decor tokens.

1032
01:09:55,902 --> 01:09:58,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I haven't played the game, so I can't tell you what those tokens do.

1033
01:09:58,843 --> 01:10:00,883
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe somebody can email us and let us know.

1034
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:02,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe buy more fireworks!

1035
01:10:02,903 --> 01:10:06,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually going to check this game out, because I think you can get a two-week free trial.

1036
01:10:06,784 --> 01:10:11,505
[SPEAKER_01]: And since I've been going back and forth on all these MMOs lately, why not check out the granddaddy of all the MMOs?

1037
01:10:11,725 --> 01:10:15,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when I played Ultima Online with my friend briefly.

1038
01:10:15,686 --> 01:10:17,406
[SPEAKER_02]: And God, I don't remember who it was.

1039
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:18,586
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so long ago.

1040
01:10:18,646 --> 01:10:22,627
[SPEAKER_02]: But we were complete asses on the game, and it was fun.

1041
01:10:22,887 --> 01:10:23,447
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't get banned?

1042
01:10:24,338 --> 01:10:32,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, we were just playing around at his house and just ran around as our character was completely naked, yelling sausage for sale.

1043
01:10:33,669 --> 01:10:34,891
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I remember.

1044
01:10:37,534 --> 01:10:39,637
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I remember.

1045
01:10:40,037 --> 01:10:43,802
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I saw that in the Barons the other day, so some things never change, you know?

1046
01:10:45,746 --> 01:10:46,826
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no.

1047
01:10:46,866 --> 01:10:53,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone was walking around in one of the towns in Ragnarok the other day going, I got a snake man, like the Adam Sandler thing.

1048
01:10:54,069 --> 01:10:58,090
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that now they've taken that and now it's just Slashdance.

1049
01:10:58,130 --> 01:10:59,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Does Ultima Online have Slashdance?

1050
01:10:59,430 --> 01:10:59,950
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe it.

1051
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:01,171
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have Slashdance in Ragnarok.

1052
01:11:01,191 --> 01:11:05,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I just remember it was weird because people would buy houses and they would store their horse in their house.

1053
01:11:05,492 --> 01:11:09,553
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, why would you put a – when we were walking past a house, do I hear a horse?

1054
01:11:10,414 --> 01:11:10,814
[SPEAKER_02]: It was weird.

1055
01:11:10,874 --> 01:11:12,274
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's because you can lock the houses.

1056
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:14,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise your stuff would get stolen, I guess, or something.

1057
01:11:15,174 --> 01:11:15,894
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a couple people who play.

1058
01:11:15,914 --> 01:11:16,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1059
01:11:16,054 --> 01:11:16,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

1060
01:11:39,188 --> 01:11:40,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

1061
01:11:40,291 --> 01:11:42,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask them if they're having fun with the event or whatever.

1062
01:11:42,696 --> 01:11:44,420
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to bring them on the show for an interview.

1063
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:45,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Interviewed this week.

1064
01:11:45,322 --> 01:11:46,725
[SPEAKER_01]: People that actually play Ultima Online.

1065
01:11:46,745 --> 01:11:48,168
[SPEAKER_05]: It's either Ultima Online or Diablo.

1066
01:11:48,309 --> 01:11:49,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, because they're so similar.

1067
01:11:50,586 --> 01:11:52,107
[SPEAKER_05]: They look very similar, actually.

1068
01:11:52,127 --> 01:11:54,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them I just sort of get mixed up on.

1069
01:11:54,189 --> 01:11:56,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, who plays EverQuest anymore?

1070
01:11:57,131 --> 01:12:10,199
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, when I went out to Pennsylvania last year, one of the workers at our office that we work with out there, without saying too much about what I do during the day, she knew that I was into video games.

1071
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,861
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, yeah, at the time I was playing Final Fantasy XI.

1072
01:12:12,901 --> 01:12:14,062
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, I played Final Fantasy XI.

1073
01:12:14,082 --> 01:12:17,064
[SPEAKER_01]: She's all, oh, I tried that once, but I just can't give up EverQuest.

1074
01:12:17,591 --> 01:12:18,131
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1075
01:12:46,067 --> 01:12:51,511
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, every week she likes to surf the internet up and down and all around and bring you her very favorite in websites.

1076
01:12:51,591 --> 01:12:56,675
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, folks, this is the very last edition of DarkSakura's website of the week.

1077
01:12:56,775 --> 01:13:09,865
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry to report DarkSakura is no longer going to be able to give you a website of the week because pretty much you can bet that if the site has something to do with pictures of cats, it's probably going to be her website of the week.

1078
01:13:12,068 --> 01:13:14,590
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week Classic Game of the Week

1079
01:13:40,372 --> 01:13:41,292
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so disappointed.

1080
01:13:41,532 --> 01:13:42,113
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's okay.

1081
01:13:42,213 --> 01:13:43,173
[SPEAKER_01]: That's too predictable.

1082
01:13:43,713 --> 01:13:45,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Guardian Legend we'll save for down the road.

1083
01:13:45,373 --> 01:13:48,554
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be something obscure like Rainbow Cotton.

1084
01:13:48,954 --> 01:13:50,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, don't give it away.

1085
01:13:51,775 --> 01:13:53,055
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't want to tune in next week.

1086
01:13:53,536 --> 01:13:55,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it a game you don't talk about a lot on the show.

1087
01:13:57,497 --> 01:14:01,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the very last website of the week.

1088
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:07,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Dark Sakura, you better be good.

1089
01:14:08,231 --> 01:14:16,533
[SPEAKER_05]: The website of the week is speaklolcat.com It's very easy, very simple.

1090
01:14:17,013 --> 01:14:20,314
[SPEAKER_05]: You type in something in English and it translates it into cat speak.

1091
01:14:20,614 --> 01:14:21,974
[SPEAKER_05]: What did I tell all of you?

1092
01:14:23,015 --> 01:14:24,855
[SPEAKER_01]: If it has to do with lolcat, it's your site of the week.

1093
01:14:24,875 --> 01:14:26,216
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I'm going to type in something right now.

1094
01:14:29,356 --> 01:14:30,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, okay.

1095
01:14:30,737 --> 01:14:31,197
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1096
01:14:31,397 --> 01:14:32,457
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking and I'm waiting.

1097
01:14:32,477 --> 01:14:33,257
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you putting in there?

1098
01:14:33,597 --> 01:14:34,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob is a big what?

1099
01:14:34,638 --> 01:14:34,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Tool?

1100
01:14:34,938 --> 01:14:35,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Tool?

1101
01:14:35,358 --> 01:14:35,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Tool?

1102
01:14:36,957 --> 01:14:38,698
[SPEAKER_05]: And it says Rob is hooge tool.

1103
01:14:42,079 --> 01:14:42,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely.

1104
01:14:42,579 --> 01:14:44,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to post that direct link into the chat room.

1105
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:54,044
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's speaklolcat.com And that, boys and girls, is the very last website of the week.

1106
01:14:54,904 --> 01:14:55,424
[SPEAKER_01]: End of line.

1107
01:14:56,444 --> 01:14:59,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so next week, DarkSakura's classic game of the week.

1108
01:15:01,667 --> 01:15:04,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you can actually link it with it saying Rob is a big tool.

1109
01:15:04,868 --> 01:15:05,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, that's why I did it.

1110
01:15:06,028 --> 01:15:07,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just check that out on my screen here.

1111
01:15:07,929 --> 01:15:08,449
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great.

1112
01:15:09,949 --> 01:15:11,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob is hooge tool.

1113
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:13,030
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a bitch.

1114
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:13,650
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1115
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:14,670
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you.

1116
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:16,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, actually, I want to see that.

1117
01:15:16,831 --> 01:15:17,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

1118
01:15:17,251 --> 01:15:18,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me go back to that site here.

1119
01:15:18,951 --> 01:15:22,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamie is a bitch.

1120
01:15:22,772 --> 01:15:24,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob's really good at typing with one hand.

1121
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:26,453
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do a lot of things with one hand.

1122
01:15:27,874 --> 01:15:29,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamie is bish.

1123
01:15:30,282 --> 01:15:31,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, where did that come from?

1124
01:15:36,664 --> 01:15:38,325
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this show is in need of a break.

1125
01:15:40,246 --> 01:15:44,447
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this show might actually be in need of cancellation, but we'll have to do it for a break for now.

1126
01:15:44,807 --> 01:15:47,488
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1127
01:15:48,148 --> 01:15:50,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo News, we haven't even touched Nintendo yet during the show.

1128
01:15:51,030 --> 01:15:53,390
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get to all the Nintendo News in Part B and plenty more to come.

1129
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:55,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry, we'll touch Nintendo plenty when we come back.

1130
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,692
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get out our Wii's when we come back.

1131
01:15:58,553 --> 01:16:03,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice a week.

1132
01:16:03,996 --> 01:16:08,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
