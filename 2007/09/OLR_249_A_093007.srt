Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
There's a host, Dark Sakura

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Sky and World of War

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight September 30th, 2007

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Halo 3 breaks big records

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Blue Dragon gets free download content

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Could Katana someday do battle with Wonder Woman?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Orange Lounge Radio

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Red Dragon gets free download content

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Red Dragon gets free download content

11
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Red Dragon gets free download content

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
priorities!

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I want to know where the Tootsie Rolls are

14
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
There are no Tootsie Rolls

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I do have brownies

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
There's no joke there

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I really do have little yummy brownies

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
They taste like coffee too

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Like the Starbucks ones

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm hoping that if we can get all the computer issues worked out

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We can go out into El Garage

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I mean the studio

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's not a converted garage door

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Remember change under the couch

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We can go out there for next week's program

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And I'm pretty excited about that

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So it'll be fun

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And no laundry baskets to be found out there

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But there is a washer and dryer that will be off during the program

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Anyhow

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let me also introduce the chatroom

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Aren't you glad you subscribed us?

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's going to be just like, MOM! I'm recording my show!

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Get out of here!

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Gosh damn

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Luckily I don't live with my parents

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's one good thing about the program

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't live with my parents

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We live with our parents

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Good job everybody

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You guys all have spouses though

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm the only unmarried one

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I haven't lived with my parents since I was 15

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Ow

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Mommy wow

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Anyway there's the chatroom

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
chat.orangelaungeradio.com

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
We too says put up pics

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Well we actually simulcast on operator11

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So if you head on over to operator11.com

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Of which I saw Frisbee put up the link in chat earlier

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Or for those of you guys listening on the archive

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And search for Orangelaungeradio

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And you can look at the simulcast of our webcam

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's all archived on there

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Because operator11 is cool and they let us eat up tons of disc space

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
With our big talking heads doing the podcast

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Someone asked special brownies

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Once again there is no budget

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
For special brownies

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Like we could afford marijuana even if we wanted to eat it

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Which I'm not really into that

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Why would you want to eat marijuana?

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Well apparently it gets you high

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah but it tastes like ass

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I can't still

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Stay on the smell of marijuana

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Remember kids don't do drugs

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Don't we do video games once in a while?

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Here on this show

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
DarkSakura please save us from turning into the hashcast

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And tell us about your gaming week

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I play a lot of Ragnarok online

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
A lot

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Dude I played this game called Ragnarok

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You're so cool

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Hey Rob shut up

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm a level 91 assassin now

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Been beating the shit out of ogres

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And I've also got

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
People are going to yell at me

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Because you're not supposed to do one

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But I'm working on

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Well I was going to make an agility spear knight

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And now I'm making an agility

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
One handed sword crusader

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But I am going to do a spear knight next

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Because spear knights are cool

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
They have long pulls and poke things with them

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Wow

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Sounds kind of

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Nevermind

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I've not played any World of Warcraft

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
In fact I'm going to stop paying for it

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
While my computer is down

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And I actually did not play any pinball this week

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Excuse me

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Halo 3 in my house

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
We had a bunch of people in our house

102
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Doing multiplayer Halo campaigns

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And then the other night

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Dan decided to get all of his buddies

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
We had Will in one of the rooms

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And then

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Our friend Alex

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Who is a crazy psycho ex-marine

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Was that a LAN party?

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
A local area nerd party?

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But they beat it on Legendary

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
According to Dan

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The way to beat Halo 3 on Legendary

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Is to be an uber sniper

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Good times

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I've compared Legendary

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
To Nightmare on Doom

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That's like old school Halo 1

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Because that's the only way you could network back in the day

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Was LANing it

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm glad to hear

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Actually I saw Dan online

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And I saw that he was playing campaign

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
On Legendary and co-op

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I was like wow

127
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I play the game on normal

128
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I would play on easy

129
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But you don't get achievements on easy

130
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I play on normal

131
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I seriously died 10 times in the first level

132
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I suck at Halo

133
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So bad

134
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
There should be a charity for me

135
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's sad

136
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Oh oh oh

137
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It was this week

138
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Oh oh oh

139
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's a flash game

140
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What's that?

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I think someone

142
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
IM'd it to me

143
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm trying to find

144
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Give me a second I don't get the name of it

145
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's basically like a stick figure

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Stick figure version

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Of Dragon's Lair

148
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's fucking fantastic

149
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Down to having

150
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Little music and death scenes

151
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And the cut scenes

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And all that fun

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's called Dungeon Escape

154
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And it can be found

155
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And I'm trying to get the

156
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Address for people

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's at

158
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Ok studiohunty

159
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
H-U-N-T-Y dot com

160
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Slash dungeon

161
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And I'm going to link it in the chat room

162
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's hilarious

163
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's not just hilarious it's HILARIOUS

164
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
HILARIOUS

165
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yeah I'm going to link it in the chat room

166
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Alright well while that's being linked

167
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
If there's nothing else for your gaming week

168
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We'll move on over to Loki, how was your gaming week?

169
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
My gaming week was fine

170
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Let's see

171
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I started off

172
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Playing Halo 3 on

173
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Legendary, single player

174
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Because no one wants to fucking enjoy my games

175
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Fuck you all, I'll beat it myself

176
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And I'm better than you

177
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'll play with you but I'll probably hold you back

178
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Whatever, I've been playing it

179
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
By myself

180
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Wait I want to know where all this sand in your vagina is coming from

181
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Are you sending out invites to people on your friends list?

182
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
No I don't send out invites at all

183
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Well then if you don't invite people

184
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Then how do you expect people to join your party?

185
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm supposed to be an internet celebrity or something that says people

186
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Wake up call

187
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You are not famous

188
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I have no patience to sit in the lobby for like

189
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
A long time

190
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's because I have boobies

191
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But no it's fine

192
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Actually it's funny because I'm getting stuck in the same spots

193
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I did in the normal game

194
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Wait what about Bobby?

195
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I thought Bobby Blackwolf was your only friend

196
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
On Playstation 3

197
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Isn't he your friend on Xbox Live?

198
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah but he's not on there

199
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
He plays the Halo

200
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I've seen him on Halo a couple times

201
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Well you should give him a call or something

202
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Say hey Bobby

203
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh yeah let me just

204
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
My phone that has everyone's phone number in it

205
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Oh there it is, Bobby's number

206
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Oh wait no I don't have Bobby's number

207
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I don't have a whole phone that doesn't exist

208
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Ok now

209
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Really I could sit here saying hey

210
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You know

211
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Want to play some Halo 3 but to be honest

212
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I don't know when I'm going to be online to play Halo 3

213
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You know

214
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm doing all sorts of busy stuff like

215
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Going to see Eastern Promises and crap

216
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So I don't know

217
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But um

218
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So other than playing Halo 3

219
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I've actually, well of course more scenes

220
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Row multiplayer and people are certainly pissed off

221
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Because

222
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's kind of unfair for them

223
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I've been playing on other people's systems

224
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You know while

225
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
They were gone or something and

226
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah my system is way

227
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Better

228
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Like if I get caught on fire

229
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I burn out a lot quicker

230
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
My rockets seem to have better accuracy

231
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I can kill them a lot easier

232
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I don't know why

233
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But that's just the way it is

234
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Anyways

235
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Other than all that stuff

236
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
On the PSP I've been playing

237
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Jackass the game

238
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And I love it

239
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's so stupid and simple

240
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's so

241
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's such a you game

242
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's really, I mean it is not hard at all

243
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
To play through the game at all

244
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And it's fun

245
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's just stupid little things

246
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's a great rental game

247
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And I think it's also probably a good game

248
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
To have friends over

249
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You can play it and laugh

250
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
On the PSP how do you play

251
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Well not on the PSP but like

252
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's also on Playstation 2

253
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I don't have the Playstation 2 version

254
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Because my sister is still borrowing my Playstation 2

255
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You need to call her up and say hey

256
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Bring it back

257
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I did say hey bring it back

258
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But she hasn't brought it back yet

259
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You send out the troops

260
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And then let's see

261
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Other than that I tried Driver 76

262
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
For the PSP

263
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Much like every other Driver game known to man

264
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm not going to try the Driver series anymore

265
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm going to stay away from it

266
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And I think that's pretty much it

267
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Oh I played with

268
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I've updated my firmware

269
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
On my PSP Slim

270
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
To the 3.71 CFW

271
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Or whatever the new

272
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
One that's done by Team M33

273
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Which ends up being Dark Alex anyways

274
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The guy that did all the other custom firmwares

275
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So now since I have

276
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
3.71 CFW I can put the official themes

277
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
On there and so I have

278
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
A cookie theme on my

279
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Because it comes with it

280
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
A cookie theme?

281
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Like

282
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Like peanut butter cookies

283
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Or Cookie Monster

284
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's chocolate chip cookies

285
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And I will show you

286
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's hilarious

287
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Sony would like to remind you

288
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Not to eat your PSP

289
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
No but it seriously is the cookie theme

290
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What about the OLR theme?

291
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What happened to that?

292
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I haven't made that yet

293
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And I will get into that later

294
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I was going to say I just had to pay to renew OLRPSP.com

295
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Our PSP site this week

296
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Oh it does look like someone ate your PSP

297
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Oh I see

298
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It changes all the icons into cookies as well

299
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Hold on I'll put that on the OP11 cam in a minute

300
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Get it?

301
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Don't eat the PSP Jamie

302
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's not healthy

303
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
There's actually one thing that

304
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I didn't make tonight

305
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The Japan Playstation site

306
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Released the official tool to make themes

307
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So yes

308
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
We can make an OLR theme

309
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
For the PSP

310
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And it's pretty sweet

311
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But there's some other ones on there

312
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
They have like wipeout

313
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And some pretty pink one

314
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That I'm not going to put on my system

315
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm sure Nellie would want that on hers

316
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I don't know

317
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So

318
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's neat I guess

319
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I don't know if I'd upgrade it

320
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
To just get that

321
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But it's neat

322
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
ShadowSlayer says

323
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Lowkey's PSP is delish

324
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Darktachidea says

325
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
This is a PSP made of chocolate chips and cookie dough

326
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Could you imagine if the PSP could just make cookies?

327
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It would be awesome

328
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It would be totally worth the price

329
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Even though the PSP

330
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I've been growing fonder and fonder

331
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
This year and last year

332
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
When the thing first came out

333
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I've been more fond of the PSP this year

334
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It would be even awesomer if it made cookies

335
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I think more people would buy those than DS's

336
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
If that happened

337
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It would be hilarious

338
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
If they had an

339
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Easy Bake Oven

340
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Attachment for the DS

341
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You know how they always put all these weird attachments

342
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
In the Game Boy Advance slot

343
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Something like that

344
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Where you actually program stuff in there

345
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And you can cook a cookie at a time

346
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's a DS

347
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That would be kind of neat

348
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't know

349
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Going on to my gaming week

350
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I haven't played a whole lot

351
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I did play some more Halo 3

352
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Which you know I'm not a big fan of first person shooters

353
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I do like Halo

354
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I love that they

355
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Just added all this crap into it

356
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I don't know what else to call it

357
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's all this crap in the game

358
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You can go back and watch your multiplayer matches

359
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And take pictures

360
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I don't know

361
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
There's not a lot I can say

362
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Really the only people this is benefiting

363
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Me talking about Halo 3

364
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Is people that don't already own an Xbox 360

365
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Because I think most people that do

366
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Probably went out and got the game

367
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Unless you hate first person shooters for some reason

368
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
In which case I find it hard to believe you got

369
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Xbox 360 in the first place

370
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
To be honest I was never a fan of Halo

371
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And Halo 3 is pretty cool

372
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I think the matchmaking is pretty good

373
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I do admit

374
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I've played and certainly there's been news about that

375
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
This week which we'll get into a little later

376
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But you know what it's not all about graphics

377
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And they are bright though

378
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And vibrant

379
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
The only reason I've always loved Halo before was multiplayer

380
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And multiplayer doesn't disappoint

381
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I mean in regards it is just

382
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Halo 2 but you know

383
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
With more and that's okay

384
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
But if you're not a fan of Halo

385
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
At all I don't know if this

386
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Is going to do it for you

387
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Especially the single player mode man

388
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
There's no back story no nothing

389
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I find it hard to follow because

390
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm not good at single player therefore I

391
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Don't really play the campaign modes of the other games

392
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So anyway

393
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That's that

394
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Halo 3 and then

395
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
World of Warcraft I finally went back to after

396
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
About a three week vacation

397
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I decided to go back to World of Warcraft this week

398
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And

399
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Trying to think how that's been going

400
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I just hit level 66

401
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Ran some instances with some friends

402
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Over in uh near Thrallmar

403
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I can't remember what that zone is called

404
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But yeah back into World of Warcraft

405
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Which I missed a little bit

406
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And I'm glad I waited because now I have a bunch of friends in the guild

407
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That are on the same level I am so we're running instances together

408
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Good times

409
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Other than that not a whole lot

410
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
There was no new arcade release this week

411
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Did you notice that?

412
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Am I the one that noticed that?

413
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Like that they decided you know on Xbox Live arcade

414
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That since Halo 3 came out they didn't need an arcade release this week

415
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I mean I guess they released like a Bomberman pack

416
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Or something there was nothing new

417
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Am I the one that noticed that?

418
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I was looking forward to something new on Wednesday

419
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Well there wasn't anything new

420
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I think just like you said

421
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You know you almost didn't notice

422
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Well I think probably a lot of people

423
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Almost didn't notice

424
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Yeah I think a lot of people probably didn't care

425
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
They've been doing two a week

426
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So I mean that's pretty good

427
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yeah in our chat room HendersonMan says

428
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I noticed I want Puzzle Quest

429
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah I kind of feel the same way like there's all this cool stuff

430
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That I want

431
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But Puzzle Quest isn't probably coming out until November

432
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Because that's when the console versions are coming out

433
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But then you know there's Res and there's

434
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Res ain't coming out this year okay

435
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I can tell you that much

436
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You're a jerk

437
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Just other stuff would be cool

438
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Omega 5 maybe

439
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I don't think Res is coming out this year

440
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
How about Castle Crashers?

441
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Where the fuck is Castle Crashers?

442
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
There you go wasn't that supposed to be out last year?

443
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yeah

444
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
In our chat room sometimes our chatters like to post

445
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
About their gaming weeks

446
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And I think my favorite gaming week goes to AJ Mix

447
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
In our chat room says

448
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
My gaming week, Legend of the Mystical Ninja

449
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
On Wii Virtual Console and Halo 3

450
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And I think he wins because

451
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Legend of the Mystical Ninja is awesome

452
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It is a pretty awesome game

453
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Have you gotten to the place where you can play

454
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Gradius in one of the arcades

455
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Like little shops in game

456
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's pretty awesome

457
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Take a look at that

458
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Anyhow

459
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Let's get into some housekeeping for tonight

460
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Of which again we don't have a whole lot

461
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
There's not been a whole lot of news going on with our show recently

462
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So of course we'll continue to plug the community

463
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Such as our LiveJournal community at Orange Lounge

464
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
On LiveJournal our username

465
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Our MySpace at MySpace.com

466
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Our Facebook

467
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I think it's called the OL Army

468
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Or the OLR listeners or something

469
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
On Facebook and

470
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
If you listened to our show a couple weeks ago

471
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I don't really use Facebook that religiously

472
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You can go to www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com

473
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Next week is episode 250

474
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And although we're not planning

475
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
A whole lot of big stuff for it

476
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Because we already had our 5th anniversary show this year

477
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So we already kind of did fun stuff for that

478
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
We're hoping to actually switch our location a little bit

479
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Which for those of you that listen to us live and watch on the webcam

480
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Might get a kick out of that

481
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And we're hoping to also bring some more interviews

482
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And just do some reshuffling of the show

483
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
If you have ideas go post on our forums

484
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What kinds of things you'd like to see on Orange Lounge Radio

485
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So we go into our next 50 episodes

486
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And 100 more after that

487
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And who knows how much longer we can get this show going

488
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Anyway

489
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Let's get into some gaming news

490
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
We'll start off with Loki tonight, some gaming news

491
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Anyways of course the big news this week

492
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Was Halo 3 came out

493
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And it sold a lot of copies

494
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
In fact

495
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Game Daily estimates that

496
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
They've sold

497
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
2.48 million units

498
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
On day 1

499
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And of course of that most of them

500
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Of course being standard editions

501
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And then of course it tears down from there

502
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Limited and legendary

503
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
But that's a whole lot of games

504
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I don't know

505
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I mean I'm not surprised

506
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
We knew it was going to sell like crazy

507
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And

508
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yeah it's going to continue to sell like crazy

509
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Weren't they touting on

510
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Xbox.com or somewhere

511
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That it's like biggest entertainment day ever

512
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Well they're saying that

513
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
There are sales

514
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Top that of like

515
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I don't know

516
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Spiderman 3 or something like that

517
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
The box office gross

518
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
To which I say Spiderman 3 wasn't that great of a movie

519
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Well also it costs

520
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You know what 9.50 maybe 10.50

521
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Depending on where you live to go to the movies

522
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
To see Spiderman 3

523
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And if you're cheap like me you'll go to like a matinee for 7 bucks

524
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But Halo 3

525
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
60 bucks plus tax

526
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
For Halo 3 so of course it made a shit load of money

527
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Right?

528
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I mean I don't know

529
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Is my math that screwed up

530
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I mean we can do the math and figure out exactly how much it made

531
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I just don't care

532
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It says

533
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
We all knew Halo 3 was going to make shit loads of money

534
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And that's really what the press release should have said

535
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Confirmed Halo 3 makes shit load of money

536
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It made a lot of money

537
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And I mean it's just going to

538
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It'll help them out it'll sell consoles possibly

539
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I mean although some people

540
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
From other companies have come out and said

541
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
No it's not people that already wanted

542
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You know

543
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Halo 3 have already bought a 360

544
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Or some shit like that

545
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But it will sell consoles

546
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Because there are people that were waiting for Halo 3

547
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Before they bought

548
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I don't know

549
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's good for Microsoft

550
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Misty in our chat room says

551
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
What? It's Halo 3

552
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Even Burger King is advertising it

553
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Money aside I wonder why

554
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Considering it's an M rated game

555
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Good point

556
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's like the child movies in Dora the Explorer

557
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Here's the reason

558
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Burger King still advertises R rated movies

559
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And that kind of stuff

560
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Do they?

561
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I think so

562
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I don't know

563
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Can you get little toys with your meals there?

564
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Well you can get different things

565
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Actually no Jurassic Burger is PG-13

566
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But here's the thing though

567
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And it kind of goes back to the whole

568
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
ESRB ratings

569
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
There are no laws in place

570
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Forbidding people from playing the game

571
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
If it's

572
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
If they're under 18

573
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Or whatever

574
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's really all just

575
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Store policies

576
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And stuff like that

577
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Unless of course you're in specific states

578
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Which makes it a felony to sell

579
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
The game to a minor

580
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
But

581
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's still

582
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's not a law

583
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
TigerKlon our chat room says

584
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
He ends up as an unlockable character in Halo 3

585
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That'd be awesome cause then he could shoot it over and over again

586
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
That would be the best ever

587
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Cause he's really freakin' disturbing

588
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Then I want Ronald McDonald in the Grimace

589
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I would rather not have him in there

590
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
To be honest

591
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
No it would be kind of jumping the shark

592
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah it would be

593
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
They've already hoarded themselves out enough for Halo 3

594
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Maybe in Halo 4

595
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It was everywhere

596
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
We don't need it to be quite that everywhere

597
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Brad from Pod Culture

598
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Is in our chat room and says

599
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
The guy ahead of me in line for Halo 3

600
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Dropped 800 bucks

601
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
He bought the legendary edition

602
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
The Halo version of the 360 console

603
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The two Halo controllers and some other crap

604
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
800 bucks on Halo

605
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And he's a consumer of horror

606
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And how?

607
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Well I see

608
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The 360

609
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Halo 3 system I think is not selling as well

610
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I think they thought it would

611
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I think it's butt ugly

612
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It's a paint job for 50 extra bucks

613
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I think cause most people already bought

614
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The 360 that were anticipating

615
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Halo before they announced this

616
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's a system that doesn't

617
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Include Halo 3

618
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That's for 50 extra dollars

619
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
That's a weird color

620
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I mean

621
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
That's kind of stupid

622
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Least you could do is throw in the game

623
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I mean come on

624
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Did anyone go out to the midnight sales or hear about them?

625
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
No

626
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
God damn I meant to get

627
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
My husband was that one cause he sold

628
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And what did he say? Did he say anything about it?

629
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
He said they were butt ugly

630
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The people? No

631
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I was gonna say

632
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Actually our manager

633
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
In Dallas Texas

634
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
He dresses up like a Spartan

635
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
He has an actual Spartan costume

636
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It looks cool too

637
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
He went out to some Dallas launches

638
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And stuff

639
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And walked around and did fun stuff like that

640
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I don't get it

641
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I mean

642
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's cool

643
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I just don't want to do every single midnight

644
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's like you've seen a midnight launch

645
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Then you've seen them all

646
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's just someone else cosplaying as something else

647
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And a long ass line

648
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And people waiting

649
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And excited about something

650
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's interesting cause Halo 3 is pretty awesome

651
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
But it's not gonna be the game of the year for me

652
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And I think for a lot of people

653
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I don't think it's gonna be the game of the year

654
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Oh it's gonna be worth the wait

655
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
It's good

656
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It's better than good, it's great

657
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
But I don't think it's gonna be game of the year

658
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I can already think of at least one game

659
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
That's very similar to Halo that's better

660
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It didn't even have multiplayer mode

661
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Well I mean

662
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I don't think a game really needs to be

663
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You know

664
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
To have the best graphics

665
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It's all about the best gameplay

666
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And has great gameplay

667
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Halo 2 before Halo 3 came out

668
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Was still on the top 10

669
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Most played

670
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Game on live

671
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And now Halo 3 will just take that spot

672
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And

673
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
People will still buy it

674
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
It's just what

675
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Makes a good game though

676
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Is the fact that even throughout time

677
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
As new games come out

678
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
People are still interested in that game

679
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
It's just like

680
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
When Saints Row

681
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
2 comes out

682
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Are people gonna be still playing

683
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Crackdown or

684
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
The original Saints Row

685
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Or Grand Theft Auto 4

686
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
When that comes out everyone's gonna forget about

687
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
A lot of other games as well

688
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I don't know if it's just me or the people on my friends list

689
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
But I notice a lot of my friends list

690
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Don't play

691
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
They're very much in the now

692
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I only ever see people playing the current games

693
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Or the games that have come out within the past month

694
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Obviously this week it's been Halo 3

695
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I'm sure everybody's friends list is like that

696
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
But before that it was all Bioshock

697
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And you don't see anybody playing

698
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
You know, Ridge Racer 6 anymore

699
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Or you know, it's just very interesting

700
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Not a lot of people playing the old stuff

701
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I don't know

702
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Thought it was interesting

703
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Anyway, I think this is kinda interesting too

704
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Is that there's some Halo 3

705
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Errors, some disc errors

706
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
That are pissing people off

707
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The legendary, I'm sorry not the legendary

708
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
But the limited edition versions of the games

709
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Apparently have some

710
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Disc copies of Halo 3

711
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It's causing some disc read errors

712
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Even on some consoles the red's ringing of death

713
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Well, that's bullshit

714
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Yeah, I don't know about that

715
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
If like one little disc skip can cause that

716
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
But you know, the things are all under warranty anyway

717
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So I mean it shouldn't be too big of a deal

718
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
But certainly people that wanted to get their Halo

719
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
On launch night are pretty pissed off

720
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
That the limited edition copies are scratched

721
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Now naturally they have a replacement disc program in the works

722
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And all that stuff

723
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm not sure that somebody's probably getting fired over this

724
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Well, all it was was the crappy packaging

725
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And the cause of the disc

726
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
To fall off the hub

727
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Because it was a piece of crap

728
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And I don't understand why

729
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Because in other countries they had a piece of foam

730
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And they're holding the disc in place

731
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
There is a replacement program in place right now

732
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
For both the essentials disc

733
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And the normal game disc

734
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And also on top of all that

735
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
The whole red ring of death thing

736
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Could it possibly be

737
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
This is kind of a stretch for me

738
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Could it be possibly that you're playing it for so many hours straight

739
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
That the console is overheating because of that

740
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Because it's poorly ventilated

741
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I think that's what the red ring of death would be caused by

742
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
In fact, I mean

743
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It's because of a chip overheating

744
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
It's not because of

745
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
A disc read error is not going to cause your chip all of a sudden to explode

746
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
No, it's

747
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
It's Bill Gates' fault, obviously

748
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Right?

749
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Obviously

750
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Because he did it himself

751
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
That's right

752
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Because he went out there with a

753
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
With a knife

754
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
An X-Acto knife

755
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
To kind of draw a parallel here

756
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I would say, for example

757
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Let's just say

758
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
This is about as ridiculous as saying

759
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Okay, if there was a certain car that had problems with their tires popping

760
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Or something like that

761
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Now there's a rumor going around

762
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Saying that if you insert a certain CD into your CD player

763
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
That your tire is going to explode

764
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I mean, that's about how ridiculous it is

765
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Interesting comments from chat

766
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Wiedu says

767
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Not so in New Zealand, Loki

768
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
My store's limited editions were all scratched

769
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Pika Uno says

770
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
All Japanese editions had foam inserts

771
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
That's a good idea

772
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Because they package games better there

773
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Yeah, they do package games a little better there

774
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
They should also

775
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You know what they should do?

776
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
They should have cases that have rose petals and daisies inside them

777
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Well, it was stupid

778
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
They had these little hubs on there

779
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Kind of locking ones

780
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
That they'd have in normal DVD cases

781
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So yeah, some did fuck up

782
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And it's stupid

783
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Luckily, mine was not scratched

784
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Alright

785
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Well, good for you Loki

786
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Not having a scratched Halo 3 game

787
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Ours wasn't scratched either

788
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I bought the regular one

789
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I walked in the day

790
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
After the midnight sale

791
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I walked in the next day

792
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I walked right into Fry's

793
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Looking out Master Chief's ass

794
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I mean, there were so many games

795
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I was just like, oh, pick one up

796
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
That was it

797
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Well, speaking of Master Chief's ass

798
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You should check out this charity

799
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Halo 3 action figure of the Master Chief

800
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It's very chickly

801
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
There is

802
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
It's an 11.5 inch figure

803
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Right now going for $241

804
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It only has

805
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
3 bids on it at the time of this article

806
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
But they are donating

807
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
10% of the profits to the

808
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
American Breast Cancer Foundation

809
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And it's

810
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Master Chief is a very hot chick

811
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Mistress Chief

812
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Mistress Chief

813
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
You know, Ms. Chief if you're nasty

814
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I don't know

815
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I don't know, it looks stupid to me

816
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It looks like someone took

817
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Like a fucking figure

818
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
For like Witchblade and stuck the Master Chief

819
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Helmet on it

820
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I mean, that's seriously what it looks like

821
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I'm not really interested to figure either

822
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And as the comments to the story

823
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Even kind of

824
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
They're like, okay, seriously though

825
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
There's no body armor

826
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I mean, you could just like

827
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Shoot her in the boobs and she'd keel over

828
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Does she have her ass cheeks?

829
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Does it have the assless

830
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Suit on it?

831
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Hmm

832
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
It looks kind of retarded

833
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
The hell game have you people been playing?

834
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Can't you set your character as a female

835
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Yeah, but she doesn't look like that

836
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Yeah, and it changes nothing

837
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Of course, it's body armor

838
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It's unisex body armor

839
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
That's right

840
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Hey, do we remember text

841
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
In Red vs. Blue?

842
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I don't really watch it

843
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I don't watch it

844
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I don't get Halo jokes

845
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Why don't you watch everything that's great?

846
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I know, why can't I be like everybody else?

847
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Seriously

848
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
God, anyways

849
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Why can't I be a robot instead of an alien?

850
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Hero's joke, by the way

851
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Hope you all saw it

852
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Someone save this show please

853
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
This is the first episode

854
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Of the new season

855
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Anyways, so

856
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
This is a complete shocker

857
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
There's going to be some new bundles

858
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Coming for the Xbox 360

859
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And of course this is kind of

860
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Very similar to the same thing that

861
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I believe was announced for the UK

862
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Where they were going to be getting a bundle

863
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Including Forza 2

864
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And Marvel Ultimate Alliance

865
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
This is going to be for both the premium system

866
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And for the elite system

867
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And both of those systems will be still

868
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
The same price as they are now

869
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Just to get two free games

870
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Hooray

871
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Then, of course

872
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
The other new bit of info

873
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Is that the core system is going to be discontinued

874
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And in its place

875
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Is going to be the Xbox 360

876
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Arcade SKU

877
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It's going to have a 256 megabyte memory card

878
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
A disk with five Xbox Live arcade games

879
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Including Boom Boom Rocket, Pac-Man

880
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Uno, Feeding Frenzy, and Luxor 2

881
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And it's going to have an HDMI out on it as well

882
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
With a wireless controller

883
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
All for $279.99

884
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Which I think is

885
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Good that they're getting rid of the core

886
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Because I know a big complaint

887
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I always hear is

888
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Why would you get the core system you can't save your game?

889
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
So now you can

890
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Because you buy the core and then you buy a hard drive

891
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
But at least this way you don't have to

892
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Right out of the box you can save your game

893
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I just think that because

894
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
When I got my Xbox 360

895
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
That's what I had to do

896
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I bought a core and then bought a hard drive

897
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Because you couldn't get Xbox 360s

898
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Like anywhere when they first came out

899
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Remember that? They were like Wii's

900
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
A couple years ago you couldn't get them anywhere

901
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And of course this is just a rumor right now

902
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Well yeah but you know what we say about Microsoft rumors

903
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
They're always true

904
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Pretty much

905
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
All the time unless somebody completely pulls it out of their butt

906
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
But usually you know

907
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Usually there's any sense of legitimacy to it whatsoever

908
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm going to go on a limb here and say back

909
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
About a month ago when they showed that whole

910
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
UK rumor

911
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
They actually had pictures to go along with it

912
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And I've seen pictures to go along with this stuff

913
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
So I'm going to take a wild guess

914
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And say that

915
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I think this is actually going to happen

916
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Alright well

917
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Back in the 80s we had Pac-Man fever

918
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
So this week we had Halo fever

919
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Because Halo is huge

920
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And a news story out of Seattle

921
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
There was a high school student who was on TV

922
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
He was on the TV going

923
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Look ma I got Halo 3

924
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And I'm standing here with Bill Gates

925
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
His name was Ritesh David

926
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Ritesh David

927
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And he was buying the very first copy of Halo 3

928
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
At a Bellevue Best Buy store

929
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And shaking hands with Bill Gates

930
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And this all went down of course early Tuesday morning

931
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Bill Gates autographed David's copy of the new game

932
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Pretty awesome

933
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
David's parents actually called the school

934
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And said he was ill that day

935
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And then here he is on the TV

936
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Hi here I am

937
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Somebody got caught

938
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Also if you wanted to also draw

939
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Straws a little bit more

940
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
He was either 18 or 17

941
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Well no not if he was nice

942
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Well get this

943
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Did he get carded for the damn game?

944
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Well no because M is 17

945
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
So he's probably okay

946
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
It didn't say if he was a senior

947
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Or what we'll assume he's a senior

948
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Alright but he told the radio station

949
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
KIRO that he was being

950
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Feared that he would be put in detention

951
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Or that other students would taunt him

952
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Or whatever and he has no regrets about

953
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Halo fever and says that meeting Bill Gates

954
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Was the greatest moment of his life

955
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And I find that kind of shocking

956
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
That the school did not bust him

957
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And that the parents called him sick

958
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
For him with this whole Halo 3

959
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I mean wasn't it kind of

960
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
You know what

961
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Is this kind of messed up

962
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
When I was in school all I had to do to get out

963
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Was like if it was a family function

964
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Or something important I had to go to

965
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
All the parents had to do was just say

966
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Um she could go to school today

967
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
So why did they have to lie?

968
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
He should be publicly spanked

969
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Naughty naughty naughty

970
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Caning

971
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
In Singapore

972
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Hey your BFF Bobby Blackwolf

973
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Is in chat Loki

974
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I believe Bobby was there

975
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
From when I was reading in his LJ

976
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I don't know if I have it all together

977
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Blackwolf says he was not the first person in line

978
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
He was the first person who was of age

979
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
There were two people in front of him

980
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
That were underage

981
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
They were skipped

982
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
So then he was of age

983
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Then what's the big deal

984
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Why is his parents calling for him

985
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
He's over 18

986
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I remember when I was in high school

987
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
You could check yourself out because you're of age

988
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Oh wait

989
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
He might be 17

990
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I think he should be disciplined

991
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
You should not be skipping school for a video game

992
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Not that I ever did that when Final Fantasy 7

993
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
First came out or anything

994
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
But I should have been spanked for doing that

995
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It was very naughty

996
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Sometimes

997
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I can tell you right now

998
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Probably skipping work when Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out

999
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Naughty naughty

1000
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Whatever

1001
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Jamie, surely there must be a

1002
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Disciplinarian inside of you that thinks

1003
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
There's something wrong with this picture

1004
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
That he's not getting in trouble

1005
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Or his parents are not being mocked openly

1006
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
For basically lying for him

1007
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
For this Halo 3

1008
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I don't think that there was a necessity to lie

1009
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
But at the same time

1010
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It's their choice in how they raise him

1011
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So

1012
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Anything that comes back on him

1013
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Is their fault

1014
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
That's how I see it

1015
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
It's the parents choice

1016
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
So he stayed up past his bedtime

1017
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
God damn

1018
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
No dessert for a week

1019
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
He needs to suck it up though and still go to school the next day

1020
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
So what if you're tired

1021
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Suck it up, come on

1022
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
That's right, I've done that

1023
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Now I've had those late night games

1024
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
When I first came out on the Super Nintendo

1025
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I must have stayed up until 2 AM in the morning

1026
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Playing that game

1027
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And then I had to go in to like band the next morning

1028
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I was so tired

1029
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I did take a week off the school to play Final Fantasy 3

1030
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Cause was my mom

1031
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Was my mom gonna call the school and say I was sick

1032
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Cause I was playing video games too late

1033
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
She'd say, hell no, you did this

1034
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
You still gotta go to school and you just suffer

1035
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Anyway

1036
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Moving on

1037
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Too much time on this story

1038
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Yep

1039
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Alright

1040
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Well

1041
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
For anyone who was curious as to the details behind

1042
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Bizarre

1043
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And Activision

1044
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Basically

1045
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
It was actually

1046
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
quoted by their

1047
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
commercial director saying that they were

1048
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
trying to find a long term

1049
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
partner association

1050
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
that they wanted to

1051
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
work on just making good games

1052
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
and not have to deal with

1053
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
the development side

1054
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
of everything so that's why they brought them in

1055
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
They made hot sweet

1056
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
love

1057
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Yes they did and hopefully we'll get a nice baby out of it

1058
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
What's that? Activision's

1059
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
been buying people up lately cause they did the whole

1060
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
They took over Guitar Hero

1061
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
too

1062
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Remember?

1063
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Activision's got money

1064
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
They bought Red Octane

1065
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Well sorta

1066
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
No they bought them, they acquired them

1067
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Well right now though as far as any

1068
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
upcoming releases the only thing

1069
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
really titled right now

1070
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
is that Bizarre has

1071
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Project Gotham Racing 4

1072
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
They also have the club coming

1073
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
out from Sega so that's gonna be

1074
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
the last game that Bizarre's doing

1075
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
If you count I guess

1076
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Geometry Wars Galaxies which is also being

1077
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
released by Sega as well

1078
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
So after all those

1079
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
What happens to Project Gotham 5?

1080
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Well it will be probably put out

1081
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
by Activision or

1082
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Does that mean it's gonna be multi console?

1083
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
PlayStation 3, Project Gotham 5

1084
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
How can this be?

1085
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I don't know

1086
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Or Project Gotham 5

1087
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
will be developed by another studio

1088
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You know

1089
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Much like Guitar Hero

1090
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
now is being developed by

1091
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
someone else as well

1092
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Anyways

1093
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Something kinda cool

1094
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Tetris Splash is coming to

1095
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Xbox Live Arcade

1096
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
and

1097
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Apparently

1098
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
It's gonna be Tetris all over again

1099
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Hurrah because if you didn't get your fill

1100
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
What was it? Tetris

1101
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Not Grandmaster

1102
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Well the last Tetris game that came out

1103
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Evolution, whatever the fuck it was called

1104
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Well it will play on

1105
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Live and it will feature

1106
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
4 players offline

1107
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
6 players over Live

1108
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
and lots of blocks

1109
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
in multicolors

1110
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
and apparently a very creepy

1111
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
woman announcer

1112
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Hurrah for creepy women

1113
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
announcers. Boo for the fact I already

1114
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
bought Tetris on the Xbox 360

1115
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
and probably paid way more

1116
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
for it than I should have but I guess that's my own damn

1117
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
fault. I bought that. What was that Tetris

1118
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
game called that was the disc version?

1119
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I don't know. Obviously it wasn't

1120
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
memorable. Yet another Tetris game now on

1121
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
360 is what it's called now

1122
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I mean

1123
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Tetris and Pac-Man

1124
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
seriously stop making

1125
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
new games or just re-releasing

1126
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
your old games I guess

1127
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Going to the chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com

1128
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Bobby to the rescue again

1129
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
with the answer about what happens to Project

1130
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Gotham 5. In fact you could say

1131
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
he just owned me. I don't know

1132
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Project Gotham Racing 5 is put out by Microsoft

1133
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Game Studios. It's a Microsoft

1134
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
property. They're moving it to another

1135
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
developer within Microsoft Game Studios

1136
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
So like I said they're moving it to

1137
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
another developer much like Guitar

1138
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Hero 3 moved to a different developer

1139
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I said I got owned not you got

1140
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
owned. Oh. Yeah

1141
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Yes you did. I did

1142
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
That's alright. I don't play Project Gotham Racing

1143
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
anyway. It's too too confusing

1144
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I like burnout. It's too sim-like

1145
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
No it's just that you know the

1146
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
racing games are a little different. The cars handled it

1147
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I crash into walls in Project Gotham Racing

1148
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
more than any other game I play. You need to pick up flat out

1149
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Ultimate Carnage next week. I don't think about it

1150
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I'm serious. It's awesome. Play the demos

1151
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
over and over and over again. Oh we'll see

1152
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Are you on their payroll?

1153
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
No it's awesome. I'm talking about GameTap

1154
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Seriously. I love

1155
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
the game because I played

1156
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
the original flat out over

1157
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
and over and over again. Playing

1158
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
the ragdoll mode in it where you can just

1159
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
launch the driver through the windshield

1160
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
and do the high jump and stuff

1161
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I don't know. I just I like

1162
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
breaking stuff and launching

1163
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
drivers through windows and watching

1164
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
them get hurt. Why? Same reason

1165
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I'm playing Jackass. Yeah I know it's this

1166
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
theme here. You enjoy Jackass the game

1167
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
you enjoy launching people through windows

1168
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I seem to remember there's that Playstation Network

1169
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
game that's like a crazy guy that

1170
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
does what was that called? Pain? Best

1171
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Pain or whatever? Yeah. That you were all giddy about

1172
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
so you chuckle. You chuckle

1173
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
like a little kid who's setting fire to things in the

1174
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
back of the class. If only they had

1175
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
that game

1176
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Back of the

1177
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Classroom Pyro the game coming to

1178
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Xbox Network game.

1179
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
One game I enjoyed quite

1180
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
a bit more than the average person and I'm not

1181
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
sure why maybe just because I like Japanese

1182
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
role playing games or maybe I have such

1183
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
a boner for Chrono Trigger that I was able to

1184
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
look past the fact that the game you know

1185
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
wasn't the greatest RPG of all time but

1186
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
it wasn't bad either. Blue Dragon

1187
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
and one thing

1188
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
that you know I was one of the negatives

1189
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I was saying about Blue Dragon is it's kind of easy

1190
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I mean if you just take the time to level

1191
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
up in the very beginning of the game you're always

1192
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
two steps ahead of the enemies and only

1193
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
the boss fights really proved to be difficult

1194
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
well guess what? Blue

1195
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Dragon has come out and said you don't think the game

1196
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
is hard enough? Here's some

1197
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
free download content

1198
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
that will up the difficulty of the game.

1199
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
You don't think the hard is game enough?

1200
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Don't worry.

1201
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
What? We got covered you.

1202
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
You're about to say that.

1203
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I was just

1204
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
showing my translation skills

1205
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
from the Japanese text original.

1206
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
The ultra

1207
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
hard mod gives three new

1208
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
aspects to the game. New game

1209
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
plus or game plus which is like

1210
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
gee they had this in Chrono Trigger.

1211
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
You just start the game over again with all the

1212
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
stats that you had when you last ended.

1213
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
But there's also now hard mode which is

1214
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
twice as challenging as the normal

1215
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
so I guess that means all the enemies do

1216
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
twice as much damage, have twice as much

1217
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
HP and impossible

1218
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
impossible mode is meant

1219
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
to be played with characters starting

1220
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
at level 50 or higher.

1221
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
So needless to say you don't want to start this

1222
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
with characters that are level 1.

1223
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
No word yet though if you get anything

1224
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
for beating it. I would think that you should get

1225
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
a special achievement or you know

1226
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
a little bonus

1227
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
clip or movie or something for beating

1228
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
it on one of these ultra hard modes. But nope

1229
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
you just get the satisfaction of

1230
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
knowing you're better than everybody else at a game no one

1231
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
seems to care about.

1232
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
So congratulations to you.

1233
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Don't play a hard game player at Defense Force 2017.

1234
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I will say though I'm thankful

1235
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
that Microsoft is putting out

1236
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
or I guess I should say Microsoft because

1237
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
the devs charge this. Microsoft is putting out.

1238
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Yeah Microsoft is putting out quite well

1239
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
but no the developers and Mistwalker

1240
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
and everybody is putting out the game

1241
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
or they're putting out the content for

1242
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
free. Actually I believe Microsoft

1243
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
did publish it themselves. Mistwalker just developed it.

1244
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
So they did decide to

1245
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
charge nothing for it. So hooray for

1246
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Microsoft. Thank you for putting out.

1247
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Yes we like it when they put out.

1248
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Speaking of putting out

1249
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
for the

1250
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
most recent

1251
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
offering from Capcom

1252
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
and the Super Street Fighter 2 series

1253
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
you know Turbo Remix

1254
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
for matching service dot com

1255
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
you know 4chan

1256
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
edition

1257
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
they are having

1258
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
two characters confirmed

1259
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
will be Cammy and M. Bison

1260
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
who in the Japanese version

1261
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
is Vega.

1262
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Well that's supposed to be all the same people

1263
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
they're just making them all pretty.

1264
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
They

1265
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
do look very high def-ey.

1266
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
There's some pictures on here.

1267
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Cammy with her humongous thighs.

1268
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Well people are saying her humongous

1269
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
camel toe but

1270
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
well that's always been Cammy.

1271
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
But yeah.

1272
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Go Cammy.

1273
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Is that where she got

1274
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
her name from?

1275
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I don't know.

1276
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
But if you can't wait for

1277
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Super Street Fighter 2 HD

1278
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Remix

1279
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
you can possibly find some

1280
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
other fun games at your

1281
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
local stores this week.

1282
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000

00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
of basketball games

1284
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
well there's going to be plenty of them

1285
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
with both

1286
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000

1289
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000

00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
being on the Wii

1295
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
making it the first basketball game appearance.

1296
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And of course

1297
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
on the PSP as well.

1298
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And then let's see here

1299
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
if you're not a fan of

1300
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
basketball games then maybe you're a fan of some of the

1301
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
other games from VIMVITY

1302
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
including Crash of the Titans

1303
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
and Spyro

1304
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
or Legend of Spyro

1305
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
The Eternal Night

1306
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
and those are supposed to be coming out on

1307
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Playstation 2 for both and then of course

1308
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
on Crash

1309
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Xbox 360

1310
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
and the Wii

1311
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
DS and

1312
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Game Boy Advance.

1313
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Then on PSP

1314
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
a kind of crappy rip-off

1315
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
of WarioWare

1316
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Hot Pixel is coming to

1317
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
that system on the 2nd.

1318
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
What's funny though is when they

1319
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
released it over here they decided to spell out

1320
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
pixel P-I-X-E-L

1321
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
instead of just the PXL

1322
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
as it was in other regions.

1323
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
On

1324
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
also most systems

1325
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Spiderman Friend or Foe

1326
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
is coming out. Looks a little bit better

1327
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
than Spiderman 3 and that's

1328
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
going to be on Playstation 2

1329
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Playstation 3, 360, Wii

1330
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
and some of the handhelds.

1331
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
And let's see here

1332
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
also MLB

1333
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Power Pros coming to

1334
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Playstation 2 on the Wii.

1335
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
That looks kind of neat.

1336
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Also on the DS, Jackass the Game

1337
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
should be coming out this week.

1338
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
And on PSP

1339
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Syphon Filter. Do I want to know how to use

1340
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
the touch screen in Jackass the Game

1341
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
because that sounds kind of scary. I don't know but

1342
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
it'll be interesting.

1343
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And then some smaller games here

1344
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
maybe not a smaller game but Legend of Zelda

1345
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Phantom Hourglass is coming out this week.

1346
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
And it actually might already be out

1347
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
if you happen to be at the Nintendo World Store.

1348
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Other

1349
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
stuff coming out on the Wii this week

1350
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Dave Mirra's BMX Challenge

1351
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
which is crap.

1352
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
And then of course the DS

1353
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
also has Race Driver, Create and Race.

1354
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Kuru,

1355
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Poto, Cool Cool

1356
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Stars.

1357
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Krale the Treasure Adventures.

1358
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Arctic Tale. All which sound

1359
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
kind of crappy.

1360
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Let's see here. Backyard Football

1361
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
08. Master

1362
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Jinjin's IQ Challenge. Paws

1363
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
and Claws. Dogs and Cats.

1364
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
And then on the PC

1365
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
of course all sorts of random

1366
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
stuff including a brand new

1367
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Tycoon game because

1368
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
what would it be without

1369
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
a new Tycoon game almost every single

1370
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
week? Rock Tour

1371
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Tycoon. Man

1372
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
they're really drawn in straws now.

1373
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Scraping

1374
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
the bottom of the barrel.

1375
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Sounds like fun.

1376
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Oh and flat out Ultimate Carnage on

1377
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Xbox 360 as I mentioned earlier.

1378
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Nintendo Maniac 64 says I want to see

1379
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Jackass Wii where you throw Wii

1380
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
motes. Like maybe it just puts a

1381
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
big target on your TV and you're encouraged to destroy it.

1382
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
They've got some weird little games

1383
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
in that. One of them is

1384
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
the Elephant Pooh

1385
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Dive where you're diving off of a

1386
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
skyscraper into a big bucket

1387
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
of Elephant Pooh and then

1388
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
they've got another one where

1389
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
you're rolling down a

1390
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
ski slope

1391
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
kind of like Katamari and you're rolling

1392
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
over things. They've got a bunch

1393
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
of fun stuff in there. Definitely worth

1394
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
a rental at least. And it's

1395
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
cheap.

1396
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Well

1397
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
moving on

1398
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
going to the Japanese release

1399
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
dates. Not a huge week in Japan

1400
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
but if you've been sitting around

1401
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
in Japan you've been going god damn

1402
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I want a new Dragon Ball Z

1403
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
fighting game. I mean there's just

1404
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
not enough Dragon Ball Z fighting games

1405
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
out there on the market. Well shit you're

1406
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
in luck this week because on the Nintendo Wii

1407
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Dragon Ball Z Sparkling

1408
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Meteor is coming out on the

1409
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Nintendo Wii. I believe that's on the PlayStation

1410
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
too as well.

1411
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Thank god that those don't come over

1412
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
at the same subtitles.

1413
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
You know actually I should say this though.

1414
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Back in the day there used to be this

1415
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
you know blockbuster type store but it was a

1416
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Ma and Pa store that rented video games. But they

1417
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
rented import video games with a little

1418
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
converter. The first Japanese video game

1419
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I ever rented was a Dragon Ball Z fighting

1420
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
game on the Super Nintendo.

1421
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
It was fun too because at the time we was like

1422
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
oh cool this is from Japan. I don't understand

1423
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
anything. You know if you're not part of the solution.

1424
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I still got the old Super Nintendo.

1425
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Oh the old Famicom? You got the Famicom?

1426
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Super Famicom. Really? Yeah. Rad. Anyhow

1427
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
sorry back to Japanese release dates. On the

1428
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
PlayStation 2, Bakumatsu Renka

1429
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Karyu Kenshiden is coming out.

1430
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
An action game

1431
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
that is probably based on an anime.

1432
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
For you Bamani fans

1433
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Guitar Freaks V3 and

1434
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Drummania V3 are out in

1435
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Japan. And see I don't think they have

1436
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Guitar Hero over there and I don't think they're

1437
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
getting Rock Band. So this is

1438
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
what you get in Japan instead. You get

1439
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Guitar Freaks and Drummania.

1440
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Of which I have not played

1441
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
V3 or V4 in the arcades

1442
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
at all. I played V2.

1443
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Which was pretty much the same game.

1444
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
If you will, imagine V2

1445
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
but instead of a 2 there's a 4

1446
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
there and you'll be pretty damn

1447
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
close. Alright, alright. Fair enough.

1448
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Smartass. What if there's good

1449
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
songs though? I mean you know those games

1450
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
are only as good as the songs or whatever.

1451
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Forget it. Yeah. A chibi

1452
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
little baseball game on the PlayStation 2

1453
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
called Jikoyu Powerful

1454
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Pro Major League 2 is coming

1455
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
out. It looks like if the cast of

1456
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
worms start in a baseball game

1457
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
that's what you get. That's MLB

1458
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Power Pros over here. Oh really?

1459
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Alright, well that shows you how much I follow

1460
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
baseball games. The Crimson and Black

1461
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
DS makes its way to Japan this week.

1462
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Take a look at that. Also on the Nintendo

1463
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
DS. It ain't Cookin' Mama

1464
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
but it's kind of close. Koharu

1465
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
no DS Ushigohan

1466
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Shokuji Balance Guide

1467
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Suki. And this

1468
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
what the hell do you do? It looks like a game

1469
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
where you put in what you've been eating

1470
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
like it shows you little pictures

1471
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
of food. Yeah and it shows you

1472
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
like how many grams of fat

1473
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
and how many Kcals you're eating

1474
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
and all that good stuff. Another thing

1475
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
real quick. I think that's the smart

1476
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
idea to bring something like that out over here.

1477
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
There's enough people

1478
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
that own DS's that would be interested in that.

1479
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
That Crimson and Black DS

1480
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
ain't only coming out in Japan.

1481
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Oh really?

1482
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Where else are they going to see it? Over here.

1483
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Well it's already out over here.

1484
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Well it's out over here in that bundle

1485
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
but it's going to be sold by itself.

1486
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Which I mean come on

1487
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
man it's just

1488
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
black and red I mean really

1489
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
DNA. But it's two colors! Oh my

1490
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
god! Well then they should be twice

1491
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
the price then obviously. Can I finish release

1492
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
dates please? Sure. Thank you.

1493
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
On the PSP Gundam Battle Chronicle

1494
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000

1495
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Mina no Golf Ba Vol. 3

1496
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
which I believe isn't that just their hotshots

1497
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
over there? Yeah. And then

1498
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Shin Sangoku Mosu

1499
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Dynasty Warriors goes into

1500
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
the best hits on the PSP.

1501
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
So if you're a fan of Dynasty Warriors

1502
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
price cut enjoy that. That's your Japanese

1503
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
release dates. Horribly butchered

1504
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
pronunciations courtesy of me.

1505
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
How about Europe?

1506
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Well there is some

1507
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
well a little fun.

1508
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
There's an hour of victory on

1509
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000

1510
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
hour of victory comes out on the first

1511
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
NBA 08 comes out on the second.

1512
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000

08

1525
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Great.

1526
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Alright.

1527
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Well let's see here we talked

1528
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
about some 360

1529
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
rumors that will probably come

1530
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
true. Let's talk about some

1531
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
PlayStation 3 rumors

1532
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
which will also probably come true.

1533
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
One of which is going to be that the

1534
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
FCC has filed a

1535
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
or had a filing for a brand

1536
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
new PlayStation 3 model

1537
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
and no word

1538
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
on what it is yet but

1539
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
most likely it's going to be that

1540
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
40 gig system that just

1541
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
that rumor won't die that one

1542
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
is supposed to be coming out for

1543
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
$399 or $299 depending on

1544
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
who you're talking to

1545
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
and apparently the

1546
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
specifications for it so far it will have

1547
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Wi-Fi obviously it's going to have Bluetooth

1548
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
etc. and they're identical

1549
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
to the other PlayStation 3 models right

1550
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
now so you know it's not going to

1551
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
be like 20 gig system where it doesn't have

1552
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
any Wi-Fi

1553
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
or stuff like that but

1554
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
still though

1555
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
it's coming whether

1556
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Sony you know

1557
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
admits to it or not it will be coming

1558
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
soon. I bet you that you're going to

1559
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
get an announcement probably any

1560
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
day.

1561
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Good times.

1562
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
In fact I was going to say there was

1563
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
some other story that was also

1564
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
kind of coinciding with the same thing

1565
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
where they had one of those

1566
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
it was the

1567
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Blu-ray deals

1568
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
that they have going on right now for the PlayStation 3

1569
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
where you buy the system

1570
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
and get five Blu-ray movies. Well that

1571
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
also had the same new

1572
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
SKU number on there as well. So

1573
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
that at least confirms that there will be a new

1574
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
SKU whether it be a 48

1575
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
system or God knows whether

1576
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
size hard drive they're going to throw in with it

1577
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
there is a new SKU coming.

1578
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Hmm

1579
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Alright.

1580
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Well, Kazurai has

1581
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
commented recently on the PlayStation 3

1582
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
saying the PlayStation original

1583
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
price was just right. Nah nah nah

1584
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I have no regrets about releasing

1585
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
this for such a high cost even if everybody

1586
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
seems to have a problem with it. Well then you have

1587
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
no regrets for nobody buying

1588
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
it. Okay hold on that's not exactly

1589
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
what he said. Okay here's a quote

1590
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
quote the PS3 has been on the market less than a year

1591
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
in the US and Japan and what is it less than that

1592
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
in Europe? I love

1593
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
that because it doesn't even know. It's difficult

1594
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
right now to say who's where. Clearly

1595
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
we've never started from a position of strength

1596
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
and we've always had to catch up with any generation

1597
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
of hardware that we've brought into the market.

1598
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
You know interesting point that I think back to

1599
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
the PlayStation 1 and that is kind of true

1600
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
what he's saying. But I seem to

1601
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
recall with the PlayStation 2 they were

1602
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
kind of the big deal right

1603
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
out the gate. I don't think they ever really

1604
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I mean I don't know maybe

1605
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
you'd know more about Dreamcast versus PlayStation

1606
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
2 Jamie but I seem to recall you know

1607
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
as much as we love Sega I think Sony

1608
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
was always whooping their ass from the get go weren't they?

1609
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Sadly. Yeah so

1610
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
you know. But I mean

1611
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
we also over here we had to

1612
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
deal with the problems of coming back

1613
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
from the Saturn

1614
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
versus the PlayStation as you'll recall.

1615
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Over here the Saturn didn't have the proper

1616
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
support to make it the

1617
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
big machine like it was in Japan.

1618
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
In Japan they had all of the

1619
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
2D games. All of the best stuff came out

1620
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
on Saturn. You know I don't know I think this is just

1621
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
excuses though. I mean if you think about it their

1622
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
whole thing is well we haven't been out as

1623
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
long as the 360 so that's why we haven't

1624
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
sold as many units.

1625
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
No you still have not figured out

1626
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
why you haven't sold that many units yet.

1627
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
And that fact right there is scary

1628
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
as it is if you can't figure out why your system

1629
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
is not selling. I mean

1630
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
dude it's your

1631
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
fucking price. I mean that's why the

1632
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Panasonic 3DO didn't take off because

1633
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
it was $700.

1634
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I mean that's what Rob was asking.

1635
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Wait quick name one game on the

1636
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
3DO. 5, 4

1637
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
And it had

1638
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
You Don't Know Jack. I remember playing that

1639
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
game. But back to what Rob asked.

1640
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I bet most people wouldn't have passed that

1641
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
challenge. Sorry. I think that

1642
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
the whole reason, part of the reason why the Dreamcast

1643
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
didn't take off so well over here

1644
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
was just coming off of the

1645
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
American failure of the Saturn.

1646
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Because overseas it was

1647
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
the shit. I mean

1648
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
that's why I imported all my games on Saturn.

1649
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
But

1650
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
and you know the Dreamcast

1651
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
to me had more fun

1652
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
games on it than the PS2 did

1653
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
but I think it was just coming off of

1654
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
that failure and then

1655
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
but now you know I always looked at

1656
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Microsoft has sort of taken Sega's

1657
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
place as far as systems go

1658
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
and then they've just turned it

1659
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
right around because I honestly think that

1660
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
they're looking into the

1661
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
actual thing that gamers want instead of the

1662
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
thing they think gamers want. You know what I mean?

1663
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
If they want to catch up

1664
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
they need to put out the $399 skew

1665
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
and then they need to start putting out some better

1666
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
games because I think with that price point being

1667
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
in place people will be more likely to buy the

1668
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
system, developers will be more likely

1669
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
to make games for it, etc.

1670
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
It's interesting you bring that up, that whole

1671
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Microsoft took Sega's place thing because then you

1672
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
even put, I've thought the same thing actually

1673
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
and it's kind of interesting because you even

1674
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
throw that Peter Moore thing you know because he was with

1675
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
the Dreamcast and then he did the, you know he's not with

1676
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Microsoft anymore but he was definitely a big part of 360

1677
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
it makes it even more eerie

1678
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
that whole comparison.

1679
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Anyway, we can move on

1680
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
with the news now, sorry just random

1681
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
sidebars. Really, can I?

1682
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Yes, actually maybe I should go to the chat and see

1683
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
what's going on in chat.

1684
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I'm sorry if I mispronounced this, either

1685
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Wettu or Weetu, I think it's Weetu?

1686
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
There's no A in it though. It says Dreamcast

1687
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
sold really well in New Zealand but

1688
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
PlayStation 2 killed it.

1689
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Misty said I never got PlayStation

1690
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
2 until DDR and if I recall

1691
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
correctly I got my PlayStation

1692
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
2 at the same mall GameStop that I got

1693
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
my little DS Lite bundle at.

1694
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
BlackWolf says wasn't Tempest 2000

1695
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
on the 3DO? Jaguar.

1696
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Jaguar. Was the only game worth getting on the Jaguar?

1697
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
There was another one on

1698
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Jaguar. Okay, one other Jaguar game.

1699
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
But

1700
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
yeah, it was all about, and now you

1701
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
can get Tempest 2000 on damn near

1702
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
everything else. Mr. DeBucket says Peter Moore

1703
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
says 9-9 of 99 is still the biggest

1704
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
day in media history? Fuck Halo 3.

1705
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
That's right, because the MTV

1706
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Music Awards were on 9-9 of 99

1707
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
weren't they? I was sitting in line for my Dreamcast.

1708
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
We can move on, please

1709
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
let's move on.

1710
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
That's what I was doing except for when I ran

1711
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
over and bought a book and then came back and

1712
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
waited in line. Wait, BlackWolf says

1713
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
3DO Jaguar, same thing.

1714
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
No. Compare the

1715
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
controller sometime. The Jaguar

1716
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
came with like a dictionary for

1717
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
a controller.

1718
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
You know what I still think was the most kind of

1719
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
but controller there was was the ColecoVision

1720
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
controller. Yeah, I was going to say it looked very

1721
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
similar to ColecoVision. ColecoVision

1722
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I mean it could have been like a cell phone of the 80's

1723
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
they had like a whole number pad on there.

1724
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
The only game that I played on the

1725
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
ColecoVision that used that number pad was

1726
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Mouse Trap. Seriously?

1727
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
The Jaguar controller

1728
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
reminds me of the Steel Battalion

1729
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
controller. Now the Steel Battalion

1730
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
controller is freaking awesome. It was one

1731
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
eject button short of a Steel Battalion controller

1732
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
that's what it was. Hey, I bought my husband

1733
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
a Steel Battalion controller for his birthday.

1734
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Alright. Because I'm the best

1735
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
wife ever. Okay, chat room please

1736
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
stop derailing the show. Yes please.

1737
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Let's move on with the news.

1738
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
There was a

1739
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
recent FCC filing

1740
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
for a 40GB PS3

1741
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
and Sony isn't saying crap about

1742
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
it. They are

1743
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
really not saying crap about it.

1744
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I don't see any statements, no nothing.

1745
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Because

1746
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
they're like, oh shit

1747
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
not again.

1748
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
There is no 40GB system just like

1749
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
there was no PSP Slim or

1750
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
no rumbling controllers.

1751
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Well

1752
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
at any rate

1753
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
it's there. They're not saying anything

1754
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
end of story.

1755
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Or no 80GB

1756
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
system.

1757
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Well I already got mine.

1758
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Why does it seem like the hard drive

1759
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
is the only thing that freaking changes on that system?

1760
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Because you don't get it. Well people must not like it

1761
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
because they don't have a large enough hard drive.

1762
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Well put something for me to put on the hard drive.

1763
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Bigger is better Rob. Oh well.

1764
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Well Rob, you know you can convert your videos over.

1765
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Oh wait, but there isn't really an easy way to do that.

1766
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Oh and they don't really tell you how to

1767
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Next story, I'm angry. Sorry.

1768
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I use it for putting videos on there.

1769
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
I have a copy of

1770
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Kung Pao on there.

1771
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Whoop-de-freaking-do. Hey, Kung Pao

1772
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
is an awesome movie. Don't talk bad about it.

1773
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Steve OdoKirk needs to fucking make a sequel.

1774
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Anyways. Somebody linked

1775
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
a picture of the Jaguar controller in chat.

1776
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
How is that thing supposed to, that's like an original

1777
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Xbox controller, okay.

1778
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Where you have to have like gorilla hands to be able to hold

1779
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
that thing.

1780
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
See, with it being that big, it makes

1781
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
one sort of wonder about the

1782
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Saturn dual analog controller, but that one

1783
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
is one of the single most

1784
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
comfortable controllers ever. And they wonder

1785
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
why the Xbox didn't sell in Japan.

1786
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I mean, you need like

1787
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
three Japanese hands to hold the Xbox.

1788
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
No, Rob, Rob, Rob.

1789
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I will point out to you that when they released the

1790
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Xbox in Japan, it did have a smaller controller.

1791
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Which they released here, and

1792
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Which I made Dan buy me because

1793
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I'm sorry, look at these short fingers.

1794
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
You do not have gorilla hands.

1795
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
You have petite little girly hands.

1796
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Alright. Anyways.

1797
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
So, it's been confirmed

1798
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
the price of Rock Band, and the date for Rock Band

1799
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
has been announced.

1800
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Rock Band will come out on the Xbox 360

1801
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
and Playstation 3 on

1802
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Black Friday. Thank you,

1803
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
EA, for

1804
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
$170.

1805
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
And of course, that is the bundle

1806
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
which is going to include both

1807
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
a guitar,

1808
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
a drum set,

1809
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
microphone, and the game. Of course, the game

1810
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
by itself will also be available

1811
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
for $60 in case you

1812
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
just want to play the guitar version and

1813
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,000
own a guitar from Guitar Hero.

1814
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
However, what is kind of new

1815
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
is they announced that there will be a Playstation 2

1816
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
version for the low, low price of

1817
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
$160. You save $10.

1818
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
And that is coming out on December 10th.

1819
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
And of course, we'll feature these same things

1820
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
as well. What I find interesting

1821
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
is that they came out with a Playstation 2

1822
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
version. Something tells me it's because

1823
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
they like money.

1824
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
You got to play Rock Band last week.

1825
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Is it worth it?

1826
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
For that price? Yeah, I think so. I was going to buy it for

1827
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
$200. Good. I'll come over and play yours

1828
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
because I don't feel like dropping that kind of money

1829
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
on a video game.

1830
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Well, hopefully you'll get a pretty decent discount.

1831
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I wish they would send me a copy for free.

1832
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I'll buy the game itself,

1833
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
but I'm not going to buy $100. For a game

1834
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I'll play once, and you know it.

1835
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I'm only going to play it once, probably.

1836
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Because we don't have people

1837
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
over all the time. I play

1838
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Guitar Hero 1. I don't see my roommate being somebody

1839
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
where I'm going to be all like, hey, let's bust out

1840
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Rock Band and get down.

1841
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
It's a party game. It's a total party game.

1842
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Speaking of Guitar Hero 2, whatever fucking happened to

1843
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
their Effector pedal or something that was going to be

1844
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
added later on, I

1845
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
built one of those Effector pedals

1846
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
and now it's for nothing.

1847
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Seriously, very disappointing.

1848
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Not that it cost me any money to do that, but

1849
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
you know, still very disappointing.

1850
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Because it works, too.

1851
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Except it doesn't do anything.

1852
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Anyways,

1853
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I think it's going to be worth it.

1854
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
The big thing for me, I think, is going to be to see

1855
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
whether people are going to pay $170

1856
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
for this game or not.

1857
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
I will.

1858
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I don't know.

1859
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
It's going to be big. It's definitely going to sell

1860
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
very well. It's just, are people going to pay

1861
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
$170 for a game?

1862
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
And if so,

1863
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
then we're going to see a bunch more.

1864
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I think it is going to be

1865
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
a huge party game. I totally see

1866
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
this is the kind of thing that people who have

1867
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
big families or

1868
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
people that host parties regularly

1869
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
or it's going to become like the

1870
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
we're going to have this at a fundraiser

1871
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
or have Rock Band there. Because Guitar Hero

1872
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
is already like that.

1873
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Oh, we're going to have a fundraiser.

1874
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
We're going to have a bake sale slash car

1875
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
wash. Guitar Hero is going to be there.

1876
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
I don't know. Am I the only one that ever

1877
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
notices that Guitar Hero seems to turn up at these

1878
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
random charity events that you see advertised?

1879
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
That's going to be Rock Band.

1880
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Well, it's cool, I guess.

1881
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I'm not knocking Rock Band.

1882
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
It's just a lot of money to drop on a game.

1883
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
It is.

1884
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
I don't know.

1885
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Now you have me

1886
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
waving on it now.

1887
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Oops. Sorry EA.

1888
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Sorry, Harmonics.

1889
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Well then let's go to the next story before

1890
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Loki changes his mind completely.

1891
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
The PlayStation.com shopping service

1892
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
is closing in Japan.

1893
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
That's right. In December

1894
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
it will be ending the site's

1895
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
e-commerce services and the service

1896
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
will be coming to a complete halt in February

1897
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
2008. Now while at first glance

1898
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
this might seem like, oh, doom and gloom

1899
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
for the PlayStation, not so.

1900
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Because PlayStation.com was for

1901
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
providing downloadable content for the

1902
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
PlayStation 2. But as you guys all know

1903
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
it's all about the PlayStation 3 now

1904
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
and the PlayStation Network.

1905
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
PlayStation 2 had downloadable content?

1906
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
I guess in Japan, yeah. Because you get the PlayStation

1907
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
points.

1908
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Well anyway, if you still have PlayStation

1909
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
points you can transfer those over to your

1910
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
PlayStation 3 wallet.

1911
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
They always get better stuff in Japan.

1912
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Hello? Where have you been?

1913
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Where have you been?

1914
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I don't know.

1915
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Well,

1916
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
for anyone who also

1917
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
has been keeping up with more

1918
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
of the downloadable content for PS3

1919
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
especially for our European fans.

1920
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Well, I should say fans of the system.

1921
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Well,

1922
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Sony is pulling

1923
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
their Gran Turismo HD concept

1924
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
from the Japanese store

1925
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
and it's not probably

1926
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
coming out in Europe at all.

1927
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
There's been no announcement.

1928
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
No nothing.

1929
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
They're just not getting it.

1930
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Sorry. But now

1931
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
there's a Gran Turismo 5 prologue

1932
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
that will be

1933
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
coming out but there's no date for it

1934
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
in the UK yet.

1935
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
So that's kind of a bitch move I think

1936
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
that they're actually getting rid of

1937
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
the free version

1938
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
of Gran Turismo on there

1939
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
before the paid

1940
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
demo I guess comes out.

1941
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Well, if you have a PS3 now

1942
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
might as well download it.

1943
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Put it on your hard drive.

1944
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Honestly, what else are you going to

1945
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
fill that hard drive with?

1946
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
It wasn't a bad game.

1947
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I mean it's good for a demo.

1948
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I just can't see myself paying 50 bucks

1949
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
I can't see myself paying 50 bucks

1950
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
for Gran Turismo 5

1951
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
prologue. I'm telling you

1952
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
put porn on the Playstation Network

1953
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Sony will start out selling Microsoft

1954
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
consoles tomorrow.

1955
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Mark my words.

1956
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Okay, don't

1957
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
mark my words. Read another story.

1958
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Mark my words.

1959
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Parrish.

1960
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
The fuck was that?

1961
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
That sounded funny.

1962
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Do you need some fresh air, Loki?

1963
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
I'm feeling fine. I have to drive from Oakland.

1964
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
I'm feeling tingle fresh.

1965
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Mark my words.

1966
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
You will pay for that.

1967
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
By the way, kids, don't forget to buy

1968
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
the Eye of Judgment. We only have to sell a million.

1969
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
If you don't know what I'm talking about, listen to last week's show.

1970
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
It will never happen.

1971
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Never.

1972
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Story.

1973
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
So, in Europe

1974
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Playstation 3 is getting another

1975
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
bundle. Not surprising

1976
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
though, it's going to be bundled with Pro

1977
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Evolution Soccer 2008.

1978
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
And it's coming in November.

1979
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
That's all there is to say.

1980
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Yeah, it was confirmed

1981
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
by Playstation France and

1982
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Well, that's logical.

1983
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
You know, sports bundles are nothing

1984
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
uncommon and certainly in Europe a soccer

1985
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
bundle is going to sell some systems.

1986
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
So, you know, makes sense.

1987
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Exactly. I mean,

1988
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
remember that really crappy one that they did

1989
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
for, I think it was Pro Evo

1990
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
2007. It was like with

1991
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
AstroTurf on the 360.

1992
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Wait, it came with AstroTurf? What?

1993
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
They did like, it was an auction

1994
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
thing where they were selling it.

1995
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
What?

1996
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Well, ten years

1997
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Funny! Not funny.

1998
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Ten years have passed since Ultima Online

1999
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
first rolled out. That's right, back in

2000
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
1997 was when Ultima Online was

2001
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
first unleashed upon the world.

2002
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
And now EA is celebrating with a ten

2003
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
years of Ultima Online celebration.

2004
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
There's a brand new

2005
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Kingdom Reborn update,

2006
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
which I think we reported on previously in the program.

2007
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
It's free to download for the previous

2008
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
subscribers through October 9th.

2009
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
But, however, there's also now

2010
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
the Return to Britannia campaign

2011
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
that's going on. Electronic Arts

2012
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
is doing a monster hunt and

2013
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
prizes such as a new pendant necklace,

2014
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
a whole map of Britannia that you can win,

2015
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
a commemorative sculpture,

2016
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
armor set, all this stuff.

2017
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
The characters in game get fireworks

2018
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
and ten decor tokens.

2019
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Unfortunately, I haven't played the game

2020
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
so I can't tell you what those tokens do,

2021
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
but maybe somebody can email us and let us know

2022
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
and mail back buy more fireworks!

2023
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
I was actually going to check this game out because I think

2024
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
you can get a two week free trial.

2025
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Since I've been going back and forth on all these MMOs lately,

2026
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
why not check out the granddaddy of all the

2027
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
MMOs? I remember when I played

2028
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Ultima Online with my friend briefly,

2029
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
and god, I remember who it was.

2030
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
It was still long ago, but

2031
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
we were complete

2032
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
asses on the game and it was fun.

2033
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Did you get banned? Oh no, we were just

2034
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
playing around at his

2035
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
house and just running around

2036
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
as our character was completely naked

2037
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
yelling sausage for sale.

2038
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
That's all I remember.

2039
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
That's all I remember.

2040
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
That's all I remember.

2041
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I think I saw that in the

2042
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
barons the other day, so some things never

2043
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
change, you know?

2044
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
No, no, no, no, no.

2045
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Someone was walking around in one of the

2046
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
towns in Ragnarok the other day going,

2047
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I got a snake mange!

2048
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Like the Adam Sandler thing.

2049
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Now they've taken that and now it's just slash dance.

2050
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Does Ultima Online have

2051
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
slash dance? We don't have slash dance

2052
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I just remember it was weird because people would buy

2053
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
houses and they would store their horse in

2054
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
their house and I was like, why would you put a

2055
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
why were we walking past a house

2056
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
where I hear a horse? It was weird.

2057
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
But it was because you can lock the houses, otherwise

2058
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
your stuff would get stolen, I guess, or something.

2059
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I think Misty sums up my thoughts

2060
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
on the Ultima Online bonus stuff.

2061
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
She says, Woot explosives.

2062
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
That's true, explosives are always

2063
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
good incentive to come back to an

2064
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
old abandoned MMO. I shouldn't say

2065
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
that, actually. I guess there's still quite a few

2066
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
people who play Ultima Online. I just

2067
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
don't know any of them.

2068
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Oh well, perhaps some will email us.

2069
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
I know a couple of people who play. Really?

2070
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Yeah.

2071
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Alright. Ask them if they're having

2072
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
fun with the event or whatever. We'll have to

2073
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
bring them on the show for an interview. Interview this

2074
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
week, people that actually play Ultima Online. It's either

2075
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Ultima Online or Diablo. Oh, because they're so similar.

2076
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
They look very similar, actually.

2077
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Some of them I just

2078
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
sort of get mixed up on. Like, who plays EverQuest

2079
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
anymore? We never...

2080
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
To be honest, when I went out to

2081
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Pennsylvania

2082
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
last year, one of the

2083
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
workers at our office

2084
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
that we work with out there, without saying too much about what I do

2085
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
during the day, she

2086
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
knew that I was into video games. I said, yeah,

2087
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
at the time I was playing Final Fantasy 11.

2088
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I'm like, yeah, I play Final Fantasy 11. She's all, oh, I

2089
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
tried that once, but I just can't give up EverQuest.

2090
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
She's like, me and my husband play EverQuest

2091
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
all the time. You haven't played EverQuest? I'm like, I watched

2092
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
it once and I was bored out of my mind.

2093
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
But, yeah, I've seen it.

2094
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
There are people out there that still play EverQuest.

2095
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
We just don't really hear much about it anymore.

2096
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
It's harder to find people that are playing

2097
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
EverQuest 2 because nobody wanted

2098
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
to abandon their EverQuest character. I think that was one of the

2099
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
biggest mistakes they made, is they should have made a way

2100
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
for you can at least get some type of bonuses

2101
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
for bringing your character over from EverQuest 1.

2102
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Maybe I'm just crazy, I don't know.

2103
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Anyhow,

2104
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
DarkSakura, every week

2105
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
she likes to surf the internet up and down and all

2106
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
around and bring you her very favorite in

2107
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
websites. By the way, folks,

2108
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
this is the very last edition of

2109
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
DarkSakura's website of the week.

2110
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Sorry to report, DarkSakura

2111
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
is no longer going to be able to give you a website of the week

2112
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
because pretty

2113
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
much you can bet that

2114
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
if the site has something to do with

2115
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
pictures of cats, it's probably going to be

2116
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
her website of the week. No.

2117
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I've done a bunch of cool

2118
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
sites, Rob. In all seriousness,

2119
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
DarkSakura's website of the week...

2120
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
One had two website of the week mentions.

2121
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
That's right. The Weebles.

2122
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
That's right. Well, anyway, or Doctor Who.

2123
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
No, there's multiple Doctor Who

2124
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
sites, but I've done Weebles twice. Anyway,

2125
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
DarkSakura's website of the week will be going away

2126
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
in favor of DarkSakura's

2127
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Classic Game of the Week.

2128
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Well, yeah. You better pick a good one for the very first

2129
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
week next week, the Classic Game of the Week. I already know what I'm

2130
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
going to pick. So here it is for the very last time. And it's not

2131
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
the Guardian Legend. I'm so disappointed.

2132
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
No, that's too predictable.

2133
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Guardian Legend will save for down

2134
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
the road, but we'll do the Classic Game of the Week. It'll be something obscure

2135
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
like rainbow cotton. Alright.

2136
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Anyhow, don't give it away.

2137
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
They won't want to tune in next week.

2138
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Make it a game you don't talk about a lot

2139
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
on the show.

2140
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Anyhow, here it is, ladies and gentlemen,

2141
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
the very last website of the week.

2142
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
DarkSakura, you better be good.

2143
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
The website

2144
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
of the week is

2145
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
speaklolcat.com

2146
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
It's very easy,

2147
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
very simple.

2148
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
You type in something in English and it translates

2149
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
it into catspeak.

2150
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
What did I tell all of you?

2151
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
If it has to do with lolcat, it's your

2152
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
side of the week. See, I'm going to type in something right now.

2153
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Um, okay.

2154
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
I don't know. I'm talking and I'm...

2155
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
What are you putting in there? Rob is a big what?

2156
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Tool. Tool?

2157
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
And it says Rob is huge tool.

2158
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Hahahaha

2159
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Lovely.

2160
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
I'm going to post that direct link into the chatroom.

2161
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,000
But, um, it's speaklolcat.com

2162
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
And that, boys and girls, is the very last

2163
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
website of the week.

2164
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
End of line.

2165
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Alright, so next week, DarkSakura's classic game

2166
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
of the week. Yay!

2167
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Oh, you can actually link it

2168
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
with it saying Rob is a big tool.

2169
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Yep, that's why I did it.

2170
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Let me just check that out on my screen here.

2171
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Rob is huge tool.

2172
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
You're a bitch.

2173
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Alright. I love you.

2174
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Wait, actually, I want to see that.

2175
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Let me go back to that site here.

2176
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Jamie is a bitch.

2177
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Rob's really good at typing with one hand.

2178
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I am. I can do a lot of things with one hand.

2179
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Jamie is bish.

2180
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Okay, where did that come from?

2181
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,000
I think this show is in need of a break.

2182
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I think this show might actually be in need of cancellation.

2183
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
But we'll have to do it for a break for now.

2184
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

2185
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Right after this, Nintendo News,

2186
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
in part, we haven't even touched Nintendo yet during the show.

2187
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
We'll get to all the Nintendo news in part B

2188
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
and plenty more to come.

2189
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Don't worry, we'll touch Nintendo plenty when we come back.

2190
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
We'll get out our wheeze when we come back.

2191
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights

2192
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
and is podcasted to the world twice a week.

2193
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Stay tuned to our podcast feed

2194
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:18,000
for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
