[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:20,530
[SPEAKER_10]: I am.

3
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,710
[SPEAKER_10]: You are.

4
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:46,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I am.

5
00:00:46,924 --> 00:00:47,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

6
00:00:47,844 --> 00:00:52,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so there was a game that we saw a couple years back when they were first showing off the Wii.

7
00:00:53,445 --> 00:00:54,486
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was kind of neat.

8
00:00:54,726 --> 00:00:58,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought the title was retarded, but whatever.

9
00:00:58,306 --> 00:01:00,727
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's this game, Project Hammer.

10
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:04,527
[SPEAKER_02]: And while people were speculating, is it on hold?

11
00:01:05,327 --> 00:01:05,887
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?

12
00:01:05,987 --> 00:01:07,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, according to me, it's been canceled.

13
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:11,248
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not coming back.

14
00:01:11,548 --> 00:01:14,889
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's too bad, because who doesn't like hitting people

15
00:01:15,498 --> 00:01:16,339
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

16
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:38,139
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't bad.

17
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,101
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better than DK Bongo Blast.

18
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,561
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder why they ended up canceling it.

19
00:01:42,581 --> 00:01:43,822
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder what we're going to get instead.

20
00:01:43,862 --> 00:01:49,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Because sometimes when these games get canceled, something else comes out instead that makes it, you know, kind of worth the wait.

21
00:01:49,425 --> 00:01:52,266
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have the Project Hammer guy in, like, Super Smash Bros.

22
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:52,966
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be hilarious.

23
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:59,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, didn't they say at Game Developers Conference this year or something like that that Pikmin was the result of something else?

24
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:05,352
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the result of, like, Mario's... Yeah, it was a Mario concept that ended up being the Pikmin game.

25
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:06,293
[SPEAKER_10]: So you never know what might happen.

26
00:02:07,737 --> 00:02:09,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Frisbee asked a good question in chat.

27
00:02:09,578 --> 00:02:11,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever happened to that game Sadness?

28
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,299
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still being worked on.

29
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:13,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it?

30
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,140
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as I'm aware.

31
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:15,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we'll see.

32
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:18,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Now this is pretty cool.

33
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:19,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Some new information about the Wii.

34
00:02:19,642 --> 00:02:22,643
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know this will make DarkSakura all kinds of excited.

35
00:02:23,263 --> 00:02:29,446
[SPEAKER_10]: It has been announced that TurboGrafx-16 CD games are on their way to Wii Virtual Console.

36
00:02:30,246 --> 00:02:33,067
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe some of the earlier titles were announced.

37
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,308
[SPEAKER_10]: I have not seen...

38
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:37,362
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember what was on the early list.

39
00:02:37,422 --> 00:02:40,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Sadly, the Dracula game you love, Jamie, wasn't on there.

40
00:02:40,624 --> 00:02:41,225
[SPEAKER_02]: I do remember.

41
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:42,866
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say Ys 1 and 2 was on it, though.

42
00:02:42,886 --> 00:02:43,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Ys 1 and 2 was on there.

43
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:44,847
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

44
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:46,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have that game, but it's still awesome.

45
00:02:47,128 --> 00:02:49,750
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm curious, and what we're all wondering about.

46
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I want the Valis games.

47
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how the hell are they going to fit all this on the virtual console?

48
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the Wii only has so much internal memory.

49
00:02:55,413 --> 00:03:02,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, first of all, the biggest things about the TurboGrafx-CD games were that most of the audio on them actually is all Redbook audio.

50
00:03:03,615 --> 00:03:05,812
[SPEAKER_04]: So all you'd have to do is compress it.

51
00:03:06,613 --> 00:03:08,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Or maybe they've removed the audio from the games?

52
00:03:08,634 --> 00:03:09,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think that maybe they've done that?

53
00:03:09,995 --> 00:03:10,856
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think it's compressed.

54
00:03:10,876 --> 00:03:11,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Just put it down to MP3.

55
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:12,697
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd probably be really small.

56
00:03:13,138 --> 00:03:15,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Or AugVorbis or whatever they want to use.

57
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:15,719
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

58
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,561
[SPEAKER_10]: But I imagine you won't be able to fit that many of those on the game.

59
00:03:18,621 --> 00:03:21,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Or they're going to start selling these memory cards or something.

60
00:03:21,343 --> 00:03:22,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Virtual console memory cards.

61
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,084
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

62
00:03:24,145 --> 00:03:25,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, any memory card will work.

63
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,467
[SPEAKER_10]: But you guys know what I mean.

64
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:28,888
[SPEAKER_10]: They might start pushing people to get more memory cards.

65
00:03:28,948 --> 00:03:33,011
[SPEAKER_04]: The games themselves, though, didn't take up a whole lot of space.

66
00:03:33,091 --> 00:03:34,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're just really...

67
00:03:34,612 --> 00:03:44,439
[SPEAKER_04]: The equivalent of, I think one of the biggest ones that I personally have is Sapphire, which has some rendered graphics in it.

68
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,182
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually it has some true polygons in it.

69
00:03:49,523 --> 00:03:55,908
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the CD arcade games, but if we're just getting out like, you know, just Ys and...

70
00:03:57,173 --> 00:04:01,959
[SPEAKER_04]: and all the other sprite-based ones, that wouldn't take any space at all.

71
00:04:02,179 --> 00:04:03,761
[SPEAKER_10]: The games are only going to be 800 points.

72
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:04,802
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a pretty good deal.

73
00:04:05,183 --> 00:04:06,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a really good deal.

74
00:04:06,484 --> 00:04:08,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's going to be a major thing at all.

75
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:13,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if they're doing the Bomberman CD that came as a pack-in with the duo.

76
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:14,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Or...

77
00:04:17,193 --> 00:04:18,675
[SPEAKER_10]: and Rondo of Blood, maybe.

78
00:04:18,796 --> 00:04:20,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Rondo of Blood could actually easily be done.

79
00:04:20,638 --> 00:04:26,087
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're getting Super Nintendo cartridges on there, it is not going to be hard at all for them to do Rondo of Blood.

80
00:04:26,107 --> 00:04:29,171
[SPEAKER_10]: How much of a fangasm will you have if Rondo of Blood comes out on Virtual Console?

81
00:04:29,191 --> 00:04:32,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be like, thank God I don't have to put my disc in the machine anymore.

82
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:40,664
[SPEAKER_04]: My actual Rondo of Blood CD is still in perfect condition, but I twitch every time.

83
00:04:40,744 --> 00:04:44,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't move the machine while I'm playing it because the disc costs $300.

84
00:04:45,206 --> 00:04:54,531
[SPEAKER_02]: It was saying that they were talking about there's going to be 10 games in 2007, 5 more slated for 2008.

85
00:04:54,751 --> 00:05:02,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Game downloads will be 800 points, and I guess they're saying Rondo of Blood and Snatcher are true possibilities.

86
00:05:02,515 --> 00:05:03,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

87
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:04,900
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

88
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:06,101
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be awesome.

89
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:41,364
[SPEAKER_10]: That's rad, though, that they actually released that on Virtual Console, because we have never in this country seen the original Lost Levels, except on ROMs.

90
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,566
[SPEAKER_10]: But if I seem to recall right, wasn't that a disc game?

91
00:05:44,826 --> 00:05:46,827
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I said, it was a Famicom disc game.

92
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:47,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

93
00:05:48,328 --> 00:05:50,689
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the price for it is going to be 600 points.

94
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:58,193
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that that's actually fair, because it is, you know, basically a game that...

95
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:00,389
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

96
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,681
[SPEAKER_10]: But maybe Doki Doki Panic will come out now that they're releasing Japanese games on the console.

97
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:29,683
[SPEAKER_10]: That opens huge doors now.

98
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:31,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's a little bit more.

99
00:06:31,804 --> 00:06:38,447
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Mario Super P-Cross coming out, which is 900 Wii Points.

100
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:43,569
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have Newtopia 2, which we were discussing earlier.

101
00:06:44,429 --> 00:06:46,111
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

102
00:07:09,592 --> 00:07:12,534
[SPEAKER_02]: In Europe and Australia.

103
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:15,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess this is week one is Mario week.

104
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:18,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week, they're going to be having Ninja week.

105
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:23,782
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to include Ninja Gaiden and Ninja Jaja Maru-kun.

106
00:07:24,682 --> 00:07:28,445
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I guess the third week is going to be Sci-Fi week.

107
00:07:28,465 --> 00:07:30,706
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to have Sin and Punishment and Gradius 3.

108
00:07:32,728 --> 00:07:33,408
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good game.

109
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:37,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, of the Gradius games, which one's your favorite?

110
00:07:39,774 --> 00:07:40,594
[SPEAKER_10]: I miss Salamander, Life Force

111
00:08:02,912 --> 00:08:31,734
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think Salamander was a slight bit cooler I'm really hoping now this is completely off topic here and I did like Life Force or Salamander I was going to say it'd be really awesome if they did they really need to do this in the US as well and I think they also need to do like the Nintendo World Championships cart and have that with an online leaderboard with scores that you can post on there if anyone remembers that the World Championship cart

112
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:32,750
Yeah.

113
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,210
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of curious.

114
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,731
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to ask the chat room what kinds of import games that we've been missing in the U.S.

115
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:39,411
[SPEAKER_10]: or the U.K.

116
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:42,792
[SPEAKER_10]: for a long time would you like to see come to Virtual Console?

117
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:48,293
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure somebody's going to say Doki Doki Panic, although in some extent... I'll take the first five ones on Pirate Message.

118
00:08:48,313 --> 00:08:48,633
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that?

119
00:08:48,793 --> 00:08:51,554
[SPEAKER_10]: We already have Doki Doki Panic.

120
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:52,734
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to take some private messages?

121
00:08:52,774 --> 00:08:53,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

122
00:08:53,214 --> 00:08:54,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Send me the first five private messages.

123
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me what import game you'd like to see come out.

124
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:56,535
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

125
00:08:56,615 --> 00:08:57,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we'll read those in a little bit.

126
00:08:57,655 --> 00:08:57,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

127
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Send DarkSakura a private message in our chat.

128
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,122
[SPEAKER_10]: But it has to be in our regular chat room, chat.orangelondradio.com.

129
00:09:04,142 --> 00:09:05,022
[SPEAKER_04]: And not 2DX.

130
00:09:05,702 --> 00:09:05,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

131
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:12,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, if you're watching us on Operator 11, we're not looking at the chat room over there because our computer that streams Op 11 is all the way on the other side of the room.

132
00:09:13,946 --> 00:09:15,667
[SPEAKER_10]: So, wow.

133
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:16,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Virtual console.

134
00:09:17,668 --> 00:09:19,869
[SPEAKER_02]: So other neat stuff, I guess.

135
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Oblivion's Gamebryo engine has been ported to the Wii now.

136
00:09:23,795 --> 00:09:24,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Age of Camelot

137
00:09:42,253 --> 00:09:43,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I mean, that's pretty cool.

138
00:09:43,474 --> 00:09:46,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll see an actual cool role-playing game or something.

139
00:09:46,196 --> 00:09:47,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe something scaled down.

140
00:09:47,177 --> 00:09:48,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, they could do Oblivion.

141
00:09:48,558 --> 00:09:50,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the PSP version that was supposed to be coming out a while ago?

142
00:09:50,979 --> 00:09:53,141
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell ever happened to the Wii?

143
00:09:53,741 --> 00:09:54,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's coming.

144
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:55,403
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it got cancelled.

145
00:09:55,823 --> 00:09:56,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

146
00:09:57,084 --> 00:10:01,467
[SPEAKER_02]: But, hey, who says they can't port that over to maybe the Wii or something?

147
00:10:01,947 --> 00:10:07,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Where they have a little bit more disk space to work with and, I don't know, real-time sword controls, maybe?

148
00:10:08,372 --> 00:10:08,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

149
00:10:09,313 --> 00:10:10,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Just speculation here.

150
00:10:10,974 --> 00:10:11,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh.

151
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:11,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

152
00:10:11,798 --> 00:10:12,258
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

153
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:20,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, certainly if these guys want to use this Oblivion engine to make new games for the Wii, it's not like there's a shortage of Wiis out there.

154
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:23,207
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, certainly these things are still selling pretty well.

155
00:10:23,487 --> 00:10:26,530
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure we've had plenty of sales stories on the Wii in previous shows.

156
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,612
[SPEAKER_10]: And, of course, this all leads up to Christmas.

157
00:10:28,632 --> 00:10:31,334
[SPEAKER_10]: You might remember last Christmas, finding a Wii was tough.

158
00:10:31,414 --> 00:10:34,877
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it was the Cabbage Patch Kids or the Furbies of last year.

159
00:10:35,357 --> 00:10:40,181
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, and actually, rare fact or rare dumb little tidbit, I actually own a Furby.

160
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:42,146
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

161
00:10:57,695 --> 00:10:58,215
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?

162
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:01,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you guys going to have enough supply this Christmas season?

163
00:11:01,357 --> 00:11:05,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Reggie Fils-Aimé says, quote, And that was a quote that Reggie Fils-Aimé said to the San Jose Mercury News.

164
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,821
[SPEAKER_10]: So, of course, if you really want one of these, though...

165
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Reggie Fils-Aimé still says you should regularly check to see if the system is available.

166
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:29,570
[SPEAKER_10]: So even though they're saying they're going to flow through the streets with Wii supplies, you probably still want to call the store and check.

167
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll believe it when I see it.

168
00:11:31,371 --> 00:11:32,131
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm saying.

169
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:33,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll believe that shit when I see it.

170
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:34,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

171
00:11:35,031 --> 00:11:35,511
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't believe it.

172
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:39,112
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, obviously I haven't tried to purchase a Wii in a long time.

173
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,252
[SPEAKER_10]: How is it out there?

174
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:42,433
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, are they still pretty hard to find?

175
00:11:43,213 --> 00:11:43,953
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been getting worse.

176
00:11:43,973 --> 00:11:44,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

177
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:44,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

178
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:47,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Promises, promises, and then no fucking delivery.

179
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:47,954
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it's been.

180
00:11:48,482 --> 00:11:49,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadface.

181
00:11:49,763 --> 00:11:53,025
[SPEAKER_10]: I just hope they have some games to move those systems this year.

182
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:54,706
[SPEAKER_10]: But I guess we get in Smash Bros.

183
00:11:54,766 --> 00:11:56,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Brawl, Mario Galaxy.

184
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:57,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Those will be two AAA titles.

185
00:11:57,688 --> 00:11:58,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't get me wrong.

186
00:11:58,349 --> 00:12:05,694
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have a pretty good first-party lineup for the rest of this year and even January, hopefully Mario Kart soon.

187
00:12:06,534 --> 00:12:06,774
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

188
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:10,016
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's all about systems.

189
00:12:10,156 --> 00:12:11,117
[SPEAKER_02]: You really need the systems.

190
00:12:11,157 --> 00:12:14,279
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really hope that he's not blowing smoke up my ass.

191
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope not.

192
00:12:16,741 --> 00:12:18,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't like smoke in my ass.

193
00:12:18,874 --> 00:12:19,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Much like meat.

194
00:12:21,135 --> 00:12:21,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

195
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we got our responses in.

196
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:25,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, okay.

197
00:12:25,898 --> 00:12:26,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's hear them.

198
00:12:27,118 --> 00:12:29,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Leo Christoph says, Kurukuru Kururin.

199
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,700
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know that game.

200
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,901
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Game Boy Advance game.

201
00:12:33,261 --> 00:12:35,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you can't have Game Boy.

202
00:12:35,642 --> 00:12:37,523
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't do Game Boy games on Virtual Console.

203
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:38,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Cheater.

204
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:40,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn dirty cheater.

205
00:12:40,245 --> 00:12:40,825
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm just kidding.

206
00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:42,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Foodie Monster says, Gauss Panic.

207
00:12:44,247 --> 00:12:44,927
[SPEAKER_10]: That would rock.

208
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:45,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, winner.

209
00:12:46,468 --> 00:12:48,509
[SPEAKER_04]: GS68 says, Gradius 2 NES version.

210
00:12:49,753 --> 00:12:50,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't we already have?

211
00:12:50,694 --> 00:12:51,274
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we don't.

212
00:12:52,295 --> 00:12:53,336
[SPEAKER_10]: In Japan, they got it.

213
00:12:53,536 --> 00:12:53,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

214
00:12:54,757 --> 00:12:56,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Hitson says Pulseman for the Mega Drive.

215
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:57,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

216
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:01,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what I would pick for Mega Drive?

217
00:13:01,784 --> 00:13:03,325
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd freaking be Panorama Cotton.

218
00:13:03,745 --> 00:13:04,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hell yeah.

219
00:13:04,426 --> 00:13:04,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Good luck.

220
00:13:05,206 --> 00:13:06,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know I have Rainbow Cotton.

221
00:13:08,702 --> 00:13:17,927
[SPEAKER_10]: This somehow comes up, because I seem to remember I asked, I made the mistake of asking in the early days of OLR, because Jamie has a very scary collection of video games in her house.

222
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:18,787
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you missing?

223
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,708
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the one thing you want that you're missing?

224
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:21,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Frickin' Panorama Cotton.

225
00:13:21,928 --> 00:13:23,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Frickin' Panorama Cotton.

226
00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:27,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Panorama Cotton, Sega made 600 copies of it.

227
00:13:28,431 --> 00:13:29,912
[SPEAKER_04]: I know somebody who owns one.

228
00:13:30,972 --> 00:13:31,833
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got to touch it.

229
00:13:32,653 --> 00:13:34,094
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a special day in my life.

230
00:13:35,943 --> 00:13:39,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you touch it with your fingers or did you rub it on your arm or your boobs?

231
00:13:39,924 --> 00:13:41,945
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually played a legit Panorama Cotton before.

232
00:13:42,045 --> 00:13:42,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you?

233
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,085
[SPEAKER_10]: It was really, really nice.

234
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:44,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I touch your hand?

235
00:13:45,706 --> 00:13:47,906
[SPEAKER_10]: I've touched the hand that touched a Panorama Cotton.

236
00:13:48,346 --> 00:13:48,706
[SPEAKER_04]: You should.

237
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:51,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll hook you up with playing Panorama Cotton.

238
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:52,227
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, all right.

239
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:56,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Rostelia T suggests Terranigma and Dragon Quest V and VI.

240
00:13:57,809 --> 00:13:57,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

241
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:03,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that might be cool, but obviously they might have to translate it, and I don't think these other ones were translated, so...

242
00:14:03,908 --> 00:14:07,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris B mentioned the Japanese Mario Bros.

243
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:10,250
[SPEAKER_04]: 2, not the All-Stars version, but that was the one they're getting in the UK on Virtual Console.

244
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,990
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's only really a matter of time.

245
00:14:12,511 --> 00:14:12,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

246
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:15,791
[SPEAKER_04]: And DarkTetia says Crisis Force.

247
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:17,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

248
00:14:17,772 --> 00:14:18,672
[SPEAKER_04]: So what would you pick, Rob?

249
00:14:20,573 --> 00:14:20,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

250
00:14:21,704 --> 00:14:24,565
[SPEAKER_10]: How about the version of Excitebike where you could actually save and load?

251
00:14:24,785 --> 00:14:25,946
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be the disc version.

252
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:29,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Why didn't they do that for the fucking virtual console version?

253
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,708
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a really good question.

254
00:14:30,768 --> 00:14:31,048
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

255
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:32,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, you know what I want?

256
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:32,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's what I want.

257
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:35,691
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to talk about fucking obscure only available in Japan only?

258
00:14:36,271 --> 00:14:40,613
[SPEAKER_10]: I want the Zelda 1 remake that was on the Nintendo Channel thing.

259
00:14:41,053 --> 00:14:42,074
[SPEAKER_10]: The whatever it was called.

260
00:14:42,134 --> 00:14:42,874
[SPEAKER_04]: The NPS Satellaview.

261
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:43,374
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

262
00:14:43,614 --> 00:14:44,295
[SPEAKER_10]: The Intelliview.

263
00:14:44,575 --> 00:14:45,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Satellaview.

264
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:47,016
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the remake about?

265
00:14:47,076 --> 00:14:48,237
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just different graphics?

266
00:14:48,377 --> 00:14:50,818
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Super Nintendo graphics, and I think it had shorter levels.

267
00:14:51,398 --> 00:15:01,588
[SPEAKER_04]: It was meant, um, this, this, uh, Teleview was, um, a, uh, pay service where you had a timer for how long you could play, but there are hacked ROMs out there now that you can play it without a timer.

268
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:02,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there really?

269
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:02,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Dan played through it.

270
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

271
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Played through it.

272
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:06,253
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know that there were ROMs in there.

273
00:15:13,357 --> 00:15:13,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's rad.

274
00:15:13,977 --> 00:15:15,138
[SPEAKER_04]: From the big competition.

275
00:15:15,178 --> 00:15:15,998
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be rad.

276
00:15:16,118 --> 00:15:18,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember the, that would be so cool on the Wii.

277
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,540
[SPEAKER_10]: If they would bring back that old, you know, like the World Championships.

278
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember the Nintendo World Championships?

279
00:15:23,941 --> 00:15:26,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said about five minutes ago.

280
00:15:26,261 --> 00:15:26,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

281
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:28,962
[SPEAKER_10]: The online leaderboards.

282
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,323
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what I said five minutes ago.

283
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you not paying attention?

284
00:15:32,483 --> 00:15:33,164
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess not.

285
00:15:33,484 --> 00:15:33,964
[SPEAKER_02]: God.

286
00:15:36,845 --> 00:15:38,265
[SPEAKER_10]: I was thinking about Panorama Cotton.

287
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:41,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they'd eventually finish Robotech Crystal Dreams.

288
00:15:43,206 --> 00:15:45,989
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a wireless classic controller for the GameCube.

289
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:12,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, oh no, it's for the Wii, but it's by Thrustmaster, which has the best name ever.

290
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:13,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Thrustmaster.

291
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:15,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the name of the controller?

292
00:16:15,153 --> 00:16:16,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Thrustmaster?

293
00:16:16,253 --> 00:16:18,534
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the company that's putting it out is Thrustmaster.

294
00:16:18,654 --> 00:16:23,176
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds like, you know, something Suzanne Summers would be selling with the Thighmaster, the Thrustmaster.

295
00:16:23,196 --> 00:16:28,799
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like a bad porn, you know, instead of like Beastmaster, you have, you know, Thrustmaster, Beastiality Master or something.

296
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:29,659
I don't know.

297
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Thrustmaster just sounds like bad porn.

298
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:34,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

299
00:16:35,421 --> 00:16:35,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Good times.

300
00:16:36,482 --> 00:16:36,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Any ways.

301
00:16:38,882 --> 00:16:44,444
[SPEAKER_02]: So, here's another thing I don't understand about that wireless virtual console controller.

302
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:49,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Why they don't have it where it can be also a GameCube controller as well.

303
00:16:49,866 --> 00:16:56,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't they release something like that for the Wii so that you can use one controller for virtual console and for GameCube games.

304
00:16:57,368 --> 00:16:58,349
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you need to do.

305
00:16:58,549 --> 00:16:59,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it happen, people.

306
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, one thing that certain parents don't want to happen is...

307
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:12,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Much like me, is the Wii Zapper attachment, which is the most retarded thing on the face of the earth, I swear to God.

308
00:17:12,987 --> 00:17:13,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Why the hate?

309
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:14,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Why the hate, Loki?

310
00:17:14,628 --> 00:17:15,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the hate?

311
00:17:15,128 --> 00:17:15,748
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stupid.

312
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:16,688
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a piece of plastic.

313
00:17:16,728 --> 00:17:17,508
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need it.

314
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,008
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does not enhance your games, and I will prove it to you.

315
00:17:20,028 --> 00:17:20,509
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

316
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:21,369
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes out.

317
00:17:21,389 --> 00:17:22,309
[SPEAKER_10]: You might owe me a date.

318
00:17:22,649 --> 00:17:24,269
[SPEAKER_02]: I will not owe you a date at all.

319
00:17:25,229 --> 00:17:26,550
[SPEAKER_10]: What was I supposed to give you if you win?

320
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,070
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember.

321
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,330
[SPEAKER_10]: You were supposed to... Oh, I have to take Nelly off your hands for a night.

322
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:30,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

323
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:31,270
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it was.

324
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,010
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

325
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:33,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywho, so it is...

326
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,791
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been announced officially that it is going to come out in November on the 19th, I believe.

327
00:17:40,331 --> 00:17:45,013
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to feature, hooray, Zelda's crossbow training.

328
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:54,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is going to be, I guess, exactly like the crossbow training that was in Twilight Princess.

329
00:17:54,395 --> 00:17:54,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray.

330
00:17:56,096 --> 00:17:57,556
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, for all over $20.

331
00:17:58,396 --> 00:18:01,157
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's some Jersey parents, though, that are...

332
00:18:01,952 --> 00:18:02,653
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

333
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:33,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

334
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:52,485
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

335
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:11,806
[SPEAKER_10]: and, uh, hello, the Super Scope.

336
00:19:11,826 --> 00:19:12,467
[SPEAKER_10]: The Enforcer?

337
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:16,209
[SPEAKER_08]: The Super Scope was a freakin' bazooka that you put on your shoulder.

338
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:19,391
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember the lethal Enforcer's guns that looked like six-shooters?

339
00:19:19,511 --> 00:19:25,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though they were red and, you know, pink and blue, you know, they were still in full-on gun shape.

340
00:19:25,735 --> 00:19:26,795
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the Super Scope.

341
00:19:26,815 --> 00:19:28,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Why the fuck didn't the Super Scope do better?

342
00:19:29,277 --> 00:19:32,318
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because there were no good freakin' games for it.

343
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:36,041
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I mean, it was a goddamn bazooka that you got to play with.

344
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:36,461
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

345
00:19:37,265 --> 00:19:38,025
[SPEAKER_08]: I love my SuperScope.

346
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:39,185
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you win up the competition.

347
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:40,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we have a gun.

348
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:41,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have a fucking bazooka.

349
00:19:41,906 --> 00:19:42,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Top that shit.

350
00:19:43,406 --> 00:19:45,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo's like, look, we'll whip it out.

351
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:45,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Ours is bigger.

352
00:19:45,427 --> 00:19:47,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Sega's like, well, we have a half bazooka.

353
00:19:47,847 --> 00:19:49,067
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it the Menacer.

354
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:52,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we also had the Activator, and we know how well that went.

355
00:19:52,548 --> 00:19:58,509
[SPEAKER_10]: So now parents are all getting pissed off at this Wii Zapper thing, which looks nothing like a gun.

356
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:00,710
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it looks kinder.

357
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,930
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a gun-shaped cookie cutter or something.

358
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how to explain it.

359
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:05,071
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was a gun, it would be a Tron prop.

360
00:20:05,091 --> 00:20:05,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

361
00:20:06,508 --> 00:20:09,411
[SPEAKER_02]: It's as much of a gun as a banana is a gun, okay?

362
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:12,053
[SPEAKER_02]: That's seriously the Wii Zapper.

363
00:20:12,153 --> 00:20:15,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, I like this comment from Ranma in chat, chat.orangehallstradio.com.

364
00:20:16,056 --> 00:20:26,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Ranma says this, It simply amuses me that about 20 years ago when Nintendo first introduced the Zapper, the same soccer moms and dads that are protesting against it were playing these light gun games on the original NES.

365
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:29,768
[SPEAKER_10]: If that's not the biggest form of hypocrisy, I don't know what is.

366
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:30,969
[SPEAKER_10]: But hey, that's just me.

367
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:32,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's something.

368
00:20:32,129 --> 00:20:34,030
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all these fucking parental guidance groups.

369
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:43,934
[SPEAKER_02]: They fucking see a little headline or get, like, tipped off on something, and then they go ballistic about it without actually using said item or even knowing anything about it.

370
00:20:43,954 --> 00:20:47,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're pissed off at Bully when they knew, oh, my God, it's a game with bullies in it.

371
00:20:48,035 --> 00:20:49,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hate, hate, hate.

372
00:20:49,956 --> 00:20:56,178
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, they didn't know what the hell the game was, and it was, like, kind of promoting against bullying people.

373
00:20:56,778 --> 00:20:58,819
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just...

374
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:05,052
[SPEAKER_02]: All you have to know is you don't need to listen to these people and nothing they ever do ever works anyway.

375
00:21:05,813 --> 00:21:07,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Their banning of games worked?

376
00:21:08,094 --> 00:21:08,194
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

377
00:21:09,781 --> 00:21:11,322
[SPEAKER_02]: It hurt anybody's sales?

378
00:21:11,422 --> 00:21:11,962
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

379
00:21:12,282 --> 00:21:13,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Has it helped sales?

380
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Has it given more publicity and stuff?

381
00:21:15,224 --> 00:21:15,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it has.

382
00:21:16,004 --> 00:21:19,646
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are actually helping the sale of this stuff, you morons.

383
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:21,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Escapist has a good question in chat, too.

384
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:25,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Why aren't they protesting Big Buck Hunter, those deer hunting games in the front of every Walmart?

385
00:21:25,749 --> 00:21:31,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Or how about why aren't they protesting Time Crisis 4, which looks more like a gun than this thing?

386
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:34,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's because the Wii, the Wii is a system for kids.

387
00:21:35,154 --> 00:21:36,435
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not, you morons.

388
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:37,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

389
00:21:38,102 --> 00:21:40,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank God these crazies are in the minority, at least I hope so.

390
00:21:41,584 --> 00:21:47,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Those of you listening might notice that the rant levels seem to have gone through the roof on this story, and y'all know what that means.

391
00:21:53,574 --> 00:21:56,136
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time for the FUs of the week.

392
00:21:57,057 --> 00:21:57,438
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.

393
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:57,658
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.

394
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:07,745
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week has to go, I wouldn't really say so much towards PlayNC, but it has to go toward my copy of Guild Wars.

395
00:22:08,366 --> 00:22:13,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've been playing on the demo for a little while and I finally decided to open my box and install it on my PC.

396
00:22:14,452 --> 00:22:18,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Since I don't have World of Warcraft, not on my PC, but on my laptop, since I don't have World of Warcraft installed on here.

397
00:22:19,396 --> 00:22:22,739
[SPEAKER_04]: And until I have my PC rebuilt, I'm just going to stop paying for my World of Warcraft account.

398
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,563
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, Guild Wars is free, I already have a character, I have a free box.

399
00:22:27,247 --> 00:22:34,110
[SPEAKER_04]: So I go to peel off the sticker so I can scratch off my ID, my access key, and the access key peels off with it.

400
00:22:35,151 --> 00:22:36,031
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of it did.

401
00:22:36,711 --> 00:22:38,652
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, well, shit.

402
00:22:39,573 --> 00:22:41,534
[SPEAKER_04]: And Heather, bless her, she helped me.

403
00:22:42,074 --> 00:22:44,015
[SPEAKER_04]: She got me my game for my birthday.

404
00:22:44,095 --> 00:22:46,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, and I'm finally installing it.

405
00:22:47,476 --> 00:22:54,840
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've gone through all of that time upgrading my Guild Wars and everything and downloading all the patches, which has so much better of a patch experience.

406
00:22:55,367 --> 00:23:04,272
[SPEAKER_04]: I sent in my request, I'd have to say around 7 o'clock on Thursday I had a response within an hour I had a second response 30 minutes after that

407
00:23:25,123 --> 00:23:29,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Friday, I got two more responses telling me that they were forwarding it to a different party.

408
00:23:29,347 --> 00:23:33,210
[SPEAKER_04]: They were keeping me informed at every step of the way, and that's really good customer service.

409
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:39,856
[SPEAKER_04]: So, F you to the disc, but a thank you goes to PlayNC, except for being closed on the weekend.

410
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:42,558
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the end.

411
00:23:42,618 --> 00:23:43,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

412
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:45,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, fuck you too.

413
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:47,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Stars in Vacaville.

414
00:23:47,562 --> 00:23:52,726
[SPEAKER_02]: My god, is that a whole bunch of ghetto wrapped into one ugly ass building.

415
00:23:53,147 --> 00:23:53,267
[SPEAKER_02]: And

416
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:58,226
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, QZAR has really gone downhill there, as well as everything else there.

417
00:23:58,266 --> 00:24:02,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Their employees don't give a shit, and I don't give a shit either, and I will not be coming back.

418
00:24:04,028 --> 00:24:07,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's saying a lot, because the next QZAR is fucking 45 minutes away from that.

419
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:10,889
[SPEAKER_10]: So, that depends on you.

420
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:12,810
[SPEAKER_10]: My turn?

421
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:13,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

422
00:24:14,189 --> 00:24:17,491
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll have to give an FU to the waffle place I ate breakfast at today.

423
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Now don't get me wrong, waffles are awesome.

424
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:21,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, waffles are God's food, okay?

425
00:24:21,853 --> 00:24:23,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Waffles are like the best thing ever.

426
00:24:23,373 --> 00:24:26,094
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, can anybody think of a better food than waffles?

427
00:24:26,615 --> 00:24:26,835
[SPEAKER_10]: No?

428
00:24:26,895 --> 00:24:27,615
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't think so.

429
00:24:27,975 --> 00:24:28,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Two waffles!

430
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:30,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, two waffles!

431
00:24:31,077 --> 00:24:31,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing, though.

432
00:24:33,078 --> 00:24:39,901
[SPEAKER_10]: I did have a pretty... The reason why I give the place an FU is because they didn't have a peanut butter waffle on their menu.

433
00:24:40,261 --> 00:24:43,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, the competing waffle shop crossed town.

434
00:24:43,956 --> 00:24:44,596
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

435
00:25:12,642 --> 00:25:13,162
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

436
00:25:43,257 --> 00:25:49,300
[SPEAKER_04]: and the best hash browns ever because you can get them smothered, covered, chunked, cheese, everything on it.

437
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,701
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, ah, sexy.

438
00:25:51,401 --> 00:25:58,584
[SPEAKER_04]: But I went to Waffle House and I came back with a hat and they wouldn't sell me a cup because I wanted a big coffee mug that said Waffle House on it.

439
00:26:00,866 --> 00:26:03,847
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to let people know, I'm going to Alabama in November.

440
00:26:04,487 --> 00:26:11,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be doing my usual Cyber Station in Mobile, Alabama run because I used to work at that freaking arcade and I hate it.

441
00:26:13,226 --> 00:26:14,647
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

442
00:26:41,844 --> 00:26:48,869
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing about me going to Cyber Station is that any new Namco arcade game that comes out, all the Namco arcades get it first.

443
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:55,174
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I was in such a big tizzy to get to that one when I went a few years ago so I could go play Tekken 5.

444
00:26:56,175 --> 00:26:59,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, they got it like a couple of months before Golf Land did.

445
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:03,280
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will not be going to New Orleans.

446
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, that's too much of a drive.

447
00:27:05,381 --> 00:27:06,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I may be in Biloxi.

448
00:27:07,936 --> 00:27:18,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be in Dothan, Alabama and I will probably stop at the Tilt for about 5 minutes and leave to also kick a machine of your choosing if the Tilt is closed, I don't know if it's still at the mall

449
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:19,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Beemaw, OnlyMaw.

450
00:27:19,906 --> 00:27:21,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully a listener will know and can email us.

451
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:27,489
[SPEAKER_10]: But I was going to say, someday when we're rock stars, that should be how we go out on tour to promote things.

452
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:33,531
[SPEAKER_10]: We should set up a time in an arcade for everybody to meet us there, and everybody can gather around a machine, and then we all walk in and kick it and leave.

453
00:27:33,832 --> 00:27:40,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I did go to a DDR tourney, and this is when we already had Max.

454
00:27:41,214 --> 00:27:44,395
[SPEAKER_04]: But their newest DDR machine that they had at this arcade in –

455
00:27:46,348 --> 00:27:48,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say it was at the Beau Ravage.

456
00:27:48,089 --> 00:27:49,770
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, of course, before Katrina hit.

457
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:52,412
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a fifth mix.

458
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:54,733
[SPEAKER_04]: And I went to meet up with people there.

459
00:27:55,014 --> 00:27:55,914
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a few years ago.

460
00:27:55,934 --> 00:27:58,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I made some cool friends, too.

461
00:27:59,837 --> 00:28:05,540
[SPEAKER_04]: But just also to let people know while I'm thinking about it, there's not going to be any more Pump Up the Volume until I get my computer replaced.

462
00:28:06,341 --> 00:28:07,742
[SPEAKER_04]: My computer died.

463
00:28:09,103 --> 00:28:09,443
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot.

464
00:28:10,764 --> 00:28:11,464
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'm done.

465
00:28:11,965 --> 00:28:12,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to hear it.

466
00:28:13,846 --> 00:28:14,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Well...

467
00:28:15,187 --> 00:28:18,350
[SPEAKER_10]: We got through our FUs of the week, minorly unscathed.

468
00:28:21,313 --> 00:28:24,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there any other traveling anybody's doing this year that should be noted?

469
00:28:25,217 --> 00:28:25,577
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

470
00:28:25,697 --> 00:28:26,939
[SPEAKER_02]: I know where I'm not going.

471
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:28,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Where are you not going?

472
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to E4ALL.

473
00:28:30,402 --> 00:28:30,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is that?

474
00:28:30,822 --> 00:28:32,284
[SPEAKER_10]: I still kind of want to go for E4ALL.

475
00:28:32,404 --> 00:28:34,546
[SPEAKER_10]: I have the week off work, but why is it that you don't want to go?

476
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:39,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's like everything, everybody's canceled and it's also in LA and also the wife probably wouldn't let me anyways.

477
00:28:41,494 --> 00:28:46,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, it really, it's, you know, a long ways away.

478
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:49,702
[SPEAKER_02]: If it were like in San Francisco or something like that, that'd be a little different.

479
00:28:49,762 --> 00:28:57,068
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, eight hours away for something that's, you know, progressively getting worse, I don't know.

480
00:28:57,389 --> 00:28:59,611
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not for me.

481
00:28:59,631 --> 00:28:59,951
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

482
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:04,075
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of want to go to Network, you know, and see who I can meet and what have you, but we'll see.

483
00:29:04,954 --> 00:29:08,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, there is a brand new version of Winamp coming out.

484
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,346
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of you guys left Winamp behind when you switched to iTunes to run with your iPod.

485
00:29:12,406 --> 00:29:14,209
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't touch that iTunes shit.

486
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I flipped off iTunes.

487
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:16,694
[SPEAKER_10]: In the Internet's...

488
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,154
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

489
00:29:45,876 --> 00:29:53,903
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure exactly how it works yet, but I'm sure we will see more when the release of this comes out, which I'm not sure exactly when it's supposed to.

490
00:29:53,923 --> 00:29:56,385
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't seen a date on it, but I imagine it's later this year.

491
00:29:57,445 --> 00:29:58,066
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

492
00:29:58,502 --> 00:30:03,866
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was going to remind the chat room because it's been a while since we talked about the whole Altercade thing.

493
00:30:03,906 --> 00:30:19,579
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why you're supposed to kick an Altercade machine is because at one time other than the fact that it sucks, at one time the company that owns Altercade tried to register a trademark for or copyright or something for MAME and that's why.

494
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though they didn't make any of that.

495
00:30:22,762 --> 00:30:25,604
[SPEAKER_04]: It was this big legal nightmare but Altercade sucks anyway.

496
00:30:27,465 --> 00:30:27,666
[SPEAKER_04]: So

497
00:30:28,832 --> 00:30:51,874
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, I guess, new news there, but old news for us, really, because we've had DDR in schools for a long time, is over in the UK they're using Dancing Stage, which is the version of Dance Dance Revolution over there, to combat childhood obesity.

498
00:30:53,031 --> 00:31:06,895
[SPEAKER_04]: There are trials that are done in Bedfordshire schools to see if people will play that, but they're targeting it towards girls who don't want to play sports, especially competitive sports.

499
00:31:06,955 --> 00:31:12,497
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's basically to help increase activities going on at school, and I think that's pretty cool.

500
00:31:14,218 --> 00:31:18,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I played DDR for a long time, and, you know, it's activity.

501
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:19,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Activity is activity.

502
00:31:20,239 --> 00:31:20,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.

503
00:31:22,725 --> 00:31:23,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

504
00:31:24,346 --> 00:31:41,676
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say there's a brand new, of course we played a little bit, if you were listening to us live during the break, brand new album coming out from OC Remix, and it's Livestream, a tribute album to Final Fantasy VII, or Voices of the Livestream, I should say.

505
00:31:42,737 --> 00:31:45,939
[SPEAKER_02]: It is four discs, huge, completely free.

506
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,440
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a 2.32 gigabyte torrent

507
00:31:49,525 --> 00:32:06,933
[SPEAKER_02]: for it available, and it's split up, I guess, into their four different universes, Crisis Core, Jersey Service, Advent Children, and Last Order, and features a bunch of awesome music, 45 tracks including, and features the work of 42 different remixers.

508
00:32:08,654 --> 00:32:11,175
[SPEAKER_02]: So, freaking awesome.

509
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:12,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Download it now.

510
00:32:12,236 --> 00:32:16,518
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll actually play a couple clips here, just some real quick clips here on the show, so you can hear what some of this

511
00:32:16,854 --> 00:32:18,135
[SPEAKER_10]: This is one we played during the break.

512
00:32:18,195 --> 00:32:22,097
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a Jenova remix called Jenova Celestial by Blind.

513
00:32:36,045 --> 00:32:36,445
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that.

514
00:32:36,485 --> 00:32:37,745
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all like techno-y and stuff.

515
00:32:37,846 --> 00:32:45,110
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a Chocobo remix called Que, Electric de Chocobo, which is by an artist named Durangan.

516
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:45,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's a little clip.

517
00:32:57,583 --> 00:32:58,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Full Frontal Assault Pretty rad.

518
00:33:23,908 --> 00:33:24,549
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkDragon

519
00:33:38,803 --> 00:33:45,266
[SPEAKER_10]: One game that you don't use custom soundtracks for, though, is Guitar Hero 3, and certainly it seems like every week we're hearing about some new songs in the game.

520
00:33:45,646 --> 00:33:55,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, get this, if a recent post on Score Hero that came up and then was taken down not even two minutes later is to be believed, the full song list for Guitar Hero 3 has leaked.

521
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:01,232
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole fact that it was up and then taken down right away certainly seems to make it look like that it was...

522
00:34:02,561 --> 00:34:02,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Removed.

523
00:34:03,021 --> 00:34:06,482
[SPEAKER_10]: And you'll have to forgive me because I don't remember exactly what has been announced and what's not.

524
00:34:06,762 --> 00:34:08,402
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do notice some interesting stuff here.

525
00:34:08,442 --> 00:34:10,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I remember that Tom Morello was announced as a boss.

526
00:34:11,603 --> 00:34:14,024
[SPEAKER_10]: But Rage Against the Machine has Bulls on Parade in there.

527
00:34:14,324 --> 00:34:15,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, that's a pretty awesome guitar song.

528
00:34:16,484 --> 00:34:18,005
[SPEAKER_10]: And let's see, what else caught my eye here?

529
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:21,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Tenacious D's in there, but I think they were announced for that before.

530
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Guns N' Roses, Welcome to the Jungle.

531
00:34:23,926 --> 00:34:25,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Aerosmith, same old song and dance.

532
00:34:25,906 --> 00:34:27,747
[SPEAKER_10]: So Aerosmith might actually be Guitar Hero 3.

533
00:34:28,127 --> 00:34:28,527
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we heard...

534
00:34:29,705 --> 00:34:31,807
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess, what was this one that says Boss Lou Guitar Battle?

535
00:34:31,827 --> 00:34:32,848
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

536
00:34:32,888 --> 00:34:33,608
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who Lou would be.

537
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:33,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

538
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:02,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Lou Reed, maybe?

539
00:35:02,837 --> 00:35:03,277
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

540
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:05,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Disturbed, stricken, that's kind of cool.

541
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:06,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Where does it say Lou?

542
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I don't know.

543
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's an in-game character.

544
00:35:09,322 --> 00:35:09,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

545
00:35:10,403 --> 00:35:10,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

546
00:35:12,484 --> 00:35:14,045
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know my guitar heroes, apparently.

547
00:35:14,065 --> 00:35:15,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to see if there's anything else.

548
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:17,588
[SPEAKER_10]: But now again, this is a rumored list, so we don't know for sure.

549
00:35:17,608 --> 00:35:19,909
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

550
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:22,171
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks pretty official to me.

551
00:35:22,231 --> 00:35:24,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it looks pretty convincing.

552
00:35:24,913 --> 00:35:25,293
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

553
00:35:25,534 --> 00:35:25,914
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

554
00:35:26,674 --> 00:35:27,455
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the game's out.

555
00:35:27,975 --> 00:35:28,155
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

556
00:35:28,476 --> 00:35:28,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Next month?

557
00:35:29,672 --> 00:35:31,154
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the end of next month, the 31st.

558
00:35:31,374 --> 00:35:33,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Halloween!

559
00:35:33,496 --> 00:35:34,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no, I take that back.

560
00:35:34,637 --> 00:35:36,198
[SPEAKER_02]: The 28th is when it's coming out.

561
00:35:36,278 --> 00:35:36,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunday.

562
00:35:37,659 --> 00:35:40,221
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, they're doing a weekend release because they can.

563
00:35:40,822 --> 00:35:41,102
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

564
00:35:41,623 --> 00:35:44,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, we're going to do the mailbag segment now because we can.

565
00:35:44,765 --> 00:35:45,586
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what we want to do.

566
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,308
[SPEAKER_10]: And every week you guys send us emails.

567
00:35:47,348 --> 00:35:53,333
[SPEAKER_10]: And DarkSakura picks a few of her favorites and reads them live on air and then makes fun of them as well when she feels like it.

568
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:56,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag at OrangeZonesRadio.com is the place to send those emails.

569
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,321
[SPEAKER_10]: So open up the mailbag.

570
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Dive in, DarkSakura.

571
00:36:00,982 --> 00:36:02,203
[SPEAKER_04]: What's in there?

572
00:36:03,084 --> 00:36:03,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, guys.

573
00:36:03,864 --> 00:36:04,305
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

574
00:36:04,525 --> 00:36:08,487
[SPEAKER_04]: This is FoodieMonster from Argentina, and this is probably my first email to you guys.

575
00:36:08,968 --> 00:36:14,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I won't make it long since I've been known to call into the show a few times, so I'm not scared of the sky plane to make any long-winded rants.

576
00:36:15,492 --> 00:36:20,155
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason to this email is to send you guys a picture of the game Drawn to Life for the DS.

577
00:36:21,152 --> 00:36:25,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe you guys don't know this game, which got released on September 11th, I believe, so it's new.

578
00:36:25,453 --> 00:36:30,755
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a cutesy game and would be well-defined as a weird hybrid between Zelda Adventure Island, Mario, and Sonic.

579
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I know, it all seems to be all over the place.

580
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:46,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, the point is that the gimmick of this game is that you basically draw everything, and not just lines, no, I mean full-blown things, from clouds you step on, to the sled you ride on on one of the levels, to the gun you wield, to the main character.

581
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,040
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I wanted to show you guys.

582
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:55,442
[SPEAKER_04]: In the pictures that I've attached, I made one of OLR's and Jamie's favorite, a playable character, a cute pyramid head.

583
00:36:56,462 --> 00:37:00,123
[SPEAKER_04]: The pictures do speak for themselves, and I wish there was a way you could show the listeners as well.

584
00:37:00,504 --> 00:37:04,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe point the Operator 11 camera at the computer screen or something.

585
00:37:04,485 --> 00:37:05,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Too late, Op 11 died.

586
00:37:05,805 --> 00:37:10,226
[SPEAKER_04]: But I thought it was pretty funny, especially when the townspeople said, Oh, Pyramid H, go to rescue little Miwa.

587
00:37:10,826 --> 00:37:15,848
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole time I pictured a pyramid head ripping said little girl to shreds with a giant meat cleaver, and that made me L.O.L.,

588
00:37:16,952 --> 00:37:19,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, I'll wrap this up and let you guys continue through the mailbag.

589
00:37:20,174 --> 00:37:21,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care and keep up the great work as usual.

590
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:23,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's cute.

591
00:37:23,416 --> 00:37:24,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the little pyramid head.

592
00:37:24,677 --> 00:37:27,978
[SPEAKER_10]: I peeked in the mailbag as well to pull out the pictures.

593
00:37:28,439 --> 00:37:29,099
[SPEAKER_10]: That is cute.

594
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,881
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is great radio, but maybe Footy.

595
00:37:31,901 --> 00:37:33,762
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Footy's in chat tonight, so maybe he can share.

596
00:37:33,802 --> 00:37:35,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, he just posted his photo bucket there.

597
00:37:35,223 --> 00:37:35,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Footy.

598
00:37:35,963 --> 00:37:36,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

599
00:37:36,603 --> 00:37:37,584
[SPEAKER_10]: That was awesome radio.

600
00:37:37,644 --> 00:37:38,965
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, pictures make for great radio.

601
00:37:38,985 --> 00:37:40,626
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the cutest thing ever.

602
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:42,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.

603
00:37:42,707 --> 00:37:43,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God, he's adorable.

604
00:37:43,888 --> 00:37:44,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I want one.

605
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I want my own Pyramid Heddy.

606
00:37:47,501 --> 00:37:47,921
[SPEAKER_04]: P-Hiddy.

607
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:48,421
[SPEAKER_10]: P-Hiddy.

608
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:48,941
[SPEAKER_04]: P-Hiddy.

609
00:37:49,062 --> 00:37:50,002
[SPEAKER_04]: We call him P-Hiddy.

610
00:37:51,643 --> 00:37:52,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to look at the other picture.

611
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, he's so cute!

612
00:37:55,104 --> 00:37:55,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

613
00:37:56,544 --> 00:37:58,605
[SPEAKER_04]: So moving on.

614
00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:08,629
[SPEAKER_04]: So from Gray Fox, we have an email.

615
00:38:09,517 --> 00:38:10,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, OLR gang.

616
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:14,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been listening to your podcast for a couple months now and would like to say that I love your show.

617
00:38:14,481 --> 00:38:20,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with many others who have commented that it is the hilarious interactions between all three of you that make this show unique.

618
00:38:21,227 --> 00:38:26,591
[SPEAKER_04]: I had about a four-year hiatus of gaming because of being enrolled in university and did not have much time for video games.

619
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:31,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I have graduated, I have more time to play, so I got myself a PS2 Slimline, and I'm loving it so far.

620
00:38:32,356 --> 00:38:39,001
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering if it were possible to have a section on the show dedicated to great last-gen games.

621
00:38:39,597 --> 00:38:48,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I find there are many people who cannot afford to get involved in the next gen gaming and there are still many great games, Metal Gear Solid series, God of War, Beautiful Joe, etc.

622
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:55,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now I rely on IGN for my game recommendations but I am afraid that some games might still be great but get a lower score.

623
00:38:55,782 --> 00:38:57,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Any help would be great, keep up the good work.

624
00:38:59,063 --> 00:39:05,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I would suggest for good PS2 games, definitely the Metal Gear series.

625
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:08,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but...

626
00:39:33,029 --> 00:39:38,033
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as the last gen game goes, they're still making some good stuff for PlayStation 2.

627
00:39:38,433 --> 00:39:43,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Final Fantasy XII came out amongst all the new consoles and kind of got lost, but it's a freaking great RPG.

628
00:39:44,157 --> 00:39:50,462
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know a lot of folks in chat have been yapping about Persona 3, which is also supposed to be a really good one.

629
00:39:50,482 --> 00:39:51,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I still need to play the demo.

630
00:39:51,783 --> 00:39:53,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been busy.

631
00:39:53,744 --> 00:39:54,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I know.

632
00:39:54,104 --> 00:39:57,727
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to play the full game at some point, but there's so many games out there to play right now.

633
00:39:58,514 --> 00:40:02,456
[SPEAKER_10]: So certainly PS2 still has a bunch of crack going out for it.

634
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:06,558
[SPEAKER_10]: And I even want to go way back to some of the games that were released earlier on.

635
00:40:06,718 --> 00:40:11,660
[SPEAKER_10]: I still want to catch up on the .hack series because I actually enjoyed the games, the little bits I played of them.

636
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,960
[SPEAKER_10]: There's just a lot to them.

637
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,222
[SPEAKER_10]: So ironically enough, we talked about in Part 8 tonight, Jamie's going to have a Classic Game of the Week segment.

638
00:40:18,242 --> 00:40:21,264
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe once in a while you can have a PS2 game or something in there.

639
00:40:21,304 --> 00:40:21,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know what?

640
00:40:21,984 --> 00:40:24,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Space Channel 5.

641
00:40:24,105 --> 00:40:24,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, good times.

642
00:40:24,545 --> 00:40:26,046
[SPEAKER_04]: They did a double release of 1 and 2.

643
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:27,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Amplitude, Frequency

644
00:40:52,275 --> 00:40:54,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Guitar Hero I am moving forward, prepare to fast forward

645
00:41:12,242 --> 00:41:15,083
[SPEAKER_04]: But the area I'm at, really awesome.

646
00:41:15,683 --> 00:41:17,423
[SPEAKER_04]: A few things I'd like to say if you don't mind.

647
00:41:17,503 --> 00:41:21,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, I know you're not a big fan of anime, but I've heard you go on about how awesome Blue Dragon is.

648
00:41:22,284 --> 00:41:24,765
[SPEAKER_04]: In case you haven't heard, there's an anime based on the game now.

649
00:41:24,825 --> 00:41:25,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my question.

650
00:41:25,945 --> 00:41:29,606
[SPEAKER_04]: If there was a game that you liked also had an anime to it, would you watch it as well?

651
00:41:29,766 --> 00:41:32,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and Jamie, I've seen the first episode, and it's pretty good.

652
00:41:32,487 --> 00:41:33,127
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a must-see.

653
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:34,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have to download that then.

654
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:42,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I will say this, so far, sorry, I know the email's not done, but just to get that part out of the way, I don't think Blue Dragon is, like, OMG awesome.

655
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:47,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Blue Dragon is better than a lot of people say it is, I think.

656
00:41:47,903 --> 00:41:51,404
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a Super Nintendo RPG with next-gen graphics.

657
00:41:51,444 --> 00:41:52,324
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what Blue Dragon is.

658
00:41:52,484 --> 00:41:53,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Take it or leave it.

659
00:41:54,564 --> 00:41:55,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Would I watch the anime?

660
00:41:55,565 --> 00:41:55,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

661
00:41:56,205 --> 00:41:57,005
[SPEAKER_10]: I've heard it's out there.

662
00:41:57,025 --> 00:41:58,525
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I've seen it on YouTube.

663
00:41:58,565 --> 00:41:59,745
[SPEAKER_10]: I just haven't sat down to watch it.

664
00:42:00,085 --> 00:42:03,746
[SPEAKER_10]: But I did watch an episode of Final Fantasy Unlimited just because I liked Final Fantasy.

665
00:42:03,846 --> 00:42:06,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy Unlimited was a very strange series.

666
00:42:06,567 --> 00:42:10,928
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't watch the whole thing, but I will if I'm into it enough.

667
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:12,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I still need to finish Death Note, okay?

668
00:42:13,605 --> 00:42:14,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, Rob, another question.

669
00:42:14,926 --> 00:42:16,087
[SPEAKER_04]: The New York chapter of the O.L.

670
00:42:16,127 --> 00:42:18,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Army wants to know if you're going to Digital Life.

671
00:42:18,749 --> 00:42:23,073
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you said you were thinking about it because you have a credit with JetBlue, but not much has been said.

672
00:42:23,113 --> 00:42:26,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Would love it if you came out to New York City again because we all love you.

673
00:42:26,615 --> 00:42:33,000
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought I'd clarified this on a previous show, but perhaps some folks were out or maybe I said it on an off-recorded break or something.

674
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:36,283
[SPEAKER_10]: But unfortunately, due to a conflict, I cannot make it out there for Digital Life.

675
00:42:36,343 --> 00:42:37,864
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very sorry to the New York folks.

676
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:39,032
[SPEAKER_10]: However, you're right.

677
00:42:39,092 --> 00:42:42,074
[SPEAKER_10]: I still have that credit from JetBlue, and I've got to use it before June or it goes away.

678
00:42:42,134 --> 00:42:44,476
[SPEAKER_10]: So you bet you're going to see me out there in the spring for something.

679
00:42:44,956 --> 00:42:45,317
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll see.

680
00:42:45,817 --> 00:42:46,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

681
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:48,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let me move forward.

682
00:42:48,219 --> 00:42:54,184
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, this email is from our Ron-chan in the chat room, who always makes me squee.

683
00:42:55,605 --> 00:42:59,988
[SPEAKER_04]: So moving forward, speaking of East Coast – oh, no, we've already done that one.

684
00:43:01,129 --> 00:43:01,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, have I done that?

685
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:02,250
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I haven't.

686
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:06,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of the East Coast, Rob, you've jokingly said that if we fly OLR out to a con, you would all go.

687
00:43:07,409 --> 00:43:13,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't do that, but I can try to get you, Jamie, and Matt to discount some flights if you three can come to anime next to local con in Jersey.

688
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:16,981
[SPEAKER_04]: He's offering us to stay.

689
00:43:17,001 --> 00:43:18,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think we could make something like that?

690
00:43:19,659 --> 00:43:20,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we'll consider.

691
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:24,822
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have a resource we can tap into to maybe make that happen.

692
00:43:25,462 --> 00:43:27,764
[SPEAKER_10]: It would just be also, though, our personal calendars.

693
00:43:28,744 --> 00:43:30,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't forget, Orange Entretien, we don't get paid for doing this.

694
00:43:30,805 --> 00:43:31,726
[SPEAKER_10]: This isn't our jobs.

695
00:43:31,906 --> 00:43:32,986
[SPEAKER_10]: So we all have jobs.

696
00:43:33,066 --> 00:43:34,247
[SPEAKER_10]: And Jamie goes to school.

697
00:43:34,707 --> 00:43:35,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki's married.

698
00:43:36,308 --> 00:43:40,210
[SPEAKER_10]: So sometimes our personal lives keep us at home, not just so much the fact that we're poor.

699
00:43:40,531 --> 00:43:43,372
[SPEAKER_10]: But we do have a money resource we can tap into, and we appreciate the offer.

700
00:43:44,353 --> 00:43:45,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing, though.

701
00:43:46,314 --> 00:43:48,495
[SPEAKER_10]: If we're going to go to a con and make that kind of trip for it,

702
00:43:48,925 --> 00:43:49,945
[SPEAKER_10]: I still love you, Ranma!

703
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, where was I?

704
00:44:11,657 --> 00:44:16,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, more good news, I've decided not to get a Wii now because my friends around me have one, including my own roommate.

705
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,422
[SPEAKER_04]: I've decided to get an Xbox 360 instead.

706
00:44:19,882 --> 00:44:28,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Despite the three-year warranty Microsoft has given them, opting for the two-year replacement plan because I'd rather spend the extra cash to have it replaced the same day at my local Best Buy.

707
00:44:28,648 --> 00:44:32,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm planning to purchase it February 08 when they should have the 65mm chips in it.

708
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:39,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that you all know I'm buying one, I'm really fickle about buying games.

709
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:41,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like each of you to recommend one game I should get.

710
00:44:41,936 --> 00:44:43,757
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't suggest Rumble Roses XX.

711
00:44:43,777 --> 00:44:46,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm already planning on buying that.

712
00:44:48,201 --> 00:44:49,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

713
00:44:51,824 --> 00:44:52,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody's getting a text message.

714
00:44:52,785 --> 00:44:54,046
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably sauce.

715
00:44:54,226 --> 00:44:55,667
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't text message break up.

716
00:44:55,687 --> 00:44:57,028
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably sauce.

717
00:44:57,929 --> 00:44:58,770
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, what was the question?

718
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:00,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Cheap Xbox 360 games?

719
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:02,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, just an Xbox 360 game that you would suggest buying.

720
00:45:03,395 --> 00:45:04,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Blue Dragon, Enchanted Arms,

721
00:45:10,134 --> 00:45:11,575
[SPEAKER_02]: because Enchanted Arms also wasn't bad.

722
00:45:11,595 --> 00:45:13,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Enchanted Arms is like dirt cheap now.

723
00:45:13,696 --> 00:45:18,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you have a PlayStation 3, it's really dirt cheap.

724
00:45:18,058 --> 00:45:19,759
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to try an RPG, opt for Enchanted Arms.

725
00:45:19,799 --> 00:45:21,239
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not as bad as people made it out to be.

726
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:28,583
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can get through the first couple hours, which are a little rough, especially if it really starts to get into it, I don't think it was a bad game.

727
00:45:28,863 --> 00:45:29,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, it wasn't a great game.

728
00:45:30,004 --> 00:45:36,447
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still waiting for the freaking great blow-your-hair-back RPG on the Xbox 360, which I'm hoping is Eternal Sonata.

729
00:45:37,566 --> 00:45:38,507
[SPEAKER_04]: But I shouldn't hold my breath.

730
00:45:38,747 --> 00:45:40,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Marvel Ultimate Alliance, that's all I have to say.

731
00:45:40,968 --> 00:45:42,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

732
00:45:45,711 --> 00:45:45,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Uno.

733
00:45:46,471 --> 00:45:46,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

734
00:45:47,872 --> 00:45:49,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, don't forget the arcade, actually.

735
00:45:49,193 --> 00:45:53,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, make sure that you get Castlevania.

736
00:45:53,696 --> 00:45:58,999
[SPEAKER_04]: That's also, it looks kind of, actually the double dragon is so funny because it's all high res.

737
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:01,180
[SPEAKER_04]: And to me, it just doesn't look the same.

738
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,301
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not as cool to me.

739
00:46:03,948 --> 00:46:04,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, next part.

740
00:46:05,049 --> 00:46:06,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Jamie, I had my housewarming last night.

741
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:08,331
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get any Guinness.

742
00:46:08,371 --> 00:46:08,852
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

743
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:09,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Tear.

744
00:46:09,572 --> 00:46:17,237
[SPEAKER_04]: But we did have other alcoholic beverages, and I did a 151 shot for you, which reminds me of how much I loved hanging out with you at Faname.

745
00:46:17,257 --> 00:46:17,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw.

746
00:46:17,938 --> 00:46:20,680
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I've said it several times already, but you truly made me feel at home.

747
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait to come back out there, not to calm, but to relax and have a good time.

748
00:46:23,982 --> 00:46:24,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's so sweet.

749
00:46:25,864 --> 00:46:27,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, definitely, you've got crashing space.

750
00:46:29,646 --> 00:46:30,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely have crashing space.

751
00:46:30,867 --> 00:46:31,447
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, what?

752
00:46:31,648 --> 00:46:33,109
[SPEAKER_04]: I want us to come back out and hang out.

753
00:46:33,349 --> 00:46:33,449
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

754
00:46:33,888 --> 00:46:34,448
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

755
00:46:34,568 --> 00:46:34,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

756
00:46:35,849 --> 00:46:38,150
[SPEAKER_04]: And, okay, I'm almost done with the email.

757
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:41,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of fun times, all of OLR me is on notice.

758
00:46:41,372 --> 00:46:46,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be back for Fonamay 2009 Prayer Commitments for 08, and it will be OLRCon.

759
00:46:46,575 --> 00:46:49,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Two suites full of OLR fans just going insane.

760
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:57,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and for the record, the fag, fancy articulate guy's comment from last week was made by my friend Patty, not by me, and she rocks hard.

761
00:46:59,221 --> 00:47:00,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember you commented on that, Rob?

762
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,482
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember there was the fancy.

763
00:47:03,702 --> 00:47:04,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Articulate guys.

764
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:05,784
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, whatever.

765
00:47:07,285 --> 00:47:07,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it is starting to get warm.

766
00:47:08,005 --> 00:47:09,186
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to have to open the door pretty soon.

767
00:47:09,206 --> 00:47:10,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that's it for now.

768
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:15,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I had more topics to comment on, but I forgot what I was going to say about them.

769
00:47:16,071 --> 00:47:18,133
[SPEAKER_04]: But keep up the good work and don't stop believing.

770
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:18,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Wink face.

771
00:47:19,814 --> 00:47:21,836
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, proud member of the LOL Army since 2003.

772
00:47:21,996 --> 00:47:23,637
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a long email.

773
00:47:24,558 --> 00:47:25,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Last email.

774
00:47:25,499 --> 00:47:25,739
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

775
00:47:26,075 --> 00:47:28,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, OLR, Nintendo Maniac 64 here.

776
00:47:28,316 --> 00:47:30,458
[SPEAKER_04]: For math class, I'm doing a survey-like thing.

777
00:47:30,818 --> 00:47:31,518
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very simple.

778
00:47:31,658 --> 00:47:37,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I need you to list your preference of which of the following game systems from one best to four worst.

779
00:47:37,582 --> 00:47:41,144
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii, the 360, PlayStation 3, and the PC.

780
00:47:41,665 --> 00:47:43,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Emulators and ROMs do not count.

781
00:47:44,747 --> 00:47:46,728
[SPEAKER_04]: And then... Oh, he just wants to send an email.

782
00:47:46,868 --> 00:47:47,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, never mind.

783
00:47:47,528 --> 00:47:48,669
[SPEAKER_04]: He's wanting us to do his poll.

784
00:47:49,069 --> 00:47:49,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm curious.

785
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:51,050
[SPEAKER_04]: What of the four do you think is best?

786
00:47:51,331 --> 00:47:51,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, lordy.

787
00:47:52,011 --> 00:47:54,413
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just setting myself up for fanboy backlash.

788
00:47:54,813 --> 00:47:54,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

789
00:47:57,481 --> 00:48:04,043
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go strictly in terms of based on what's available and what I play and where my time goes based on that.

790
00:48:04,083 --> 00:48:09,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Because our golden rule, we haven't said it a long time on this show, so let me reiterate the golden rule of gaming.

791
00:48:10,364 --> 00:48:13,985
[SPEAKER_10]: A console is only as good as the games that are on it.

792
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:17,506
[SPEAKER_10]: So that being said, I would say the Xbox 360 is number one.

793
00:48:18,086 --> 00:48:19,327
[SPEAKER_10]: PC is number two.

794
00:48:19,887 --> 00:48:20,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Wii is number three.

795
00:48:21,724 --> 00:48:22,884
[SPEAKER_10]: PlayStation 3 is number four.

796
00:48:23,205 --> 00:48:24,865
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with that.

797
00:48:25,005 --> 00:48:25,666
[SPEAKER_10]: But let me put this.

798
00:48:26,186 --> 00:48:35,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, based on the goal, again, based on the golden rule of gaming, like Xbox 360, PC, and Wii, well, I would say Xbox 360 and PC are really close to the top.

799
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:38,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Wii down a little bit, but still near the top.

800
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:39,171
[SPEAKER_04]: It's getting there.

801
00:48:39,351 --> 00:48:40,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Big gap.

802
00:48:41,512 --> 00:48:42,752
[SPEAKER_10]: And then PlayStation 3 at the bottom.

803
00:48:43,132 --> 00:48:47,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, being that I have a PS3 and have a bunch of games for it,

804
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:51,668
[SPEAKER_04]: The only game I played on that one regularly was Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

805
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:55,893
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that I have it on Xbox 360, I'm like, well, why?

806
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:56,934
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the point?

807
00:48:57,254 --> 00:49:03,902
[SPEAKER_04]: I can actually play it and not have to shake my controller around like an idiot and look like I'm having a seizure trying to do the underwater level.

808
00:49:04,322 --> 00:49:04,903
[SPEAKER_04]: So screw it.

809
00:49:06,519 --> 00:49:08,981
[SPEAKER_02]: You know you don't need to flail your arms around a lot.

810
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:10,282
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just do it with your wrist.

811
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,002
[SPEAKER_10]: She likes to flail.

812
00:49:11,022 --> 00:49:12,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but I hate it.

813
00:49:13,143 --> 00:49:14,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, what would be your list?

814
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:17,426
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about PC.

815
00:49:17,506 --> 00:49:19,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't play a lot of PC stuff.

816
00:49:19,408 --> 00:49:25,151
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say probably, well, 360 because there's just a lot of games on it.

817
00:49:27,033 --> 00:49:28,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Wii is hard.

818
00:49:28,093 --> 00:49:31,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a lot of games out there, but I don't play it a lot.

819
00:49:31,896 --> 00:49:33,637
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually, I would say probably...

820
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:38,038
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to put the PlayStation... I guess I'd say the same list as you, Rob.

821
00:49:38,258 --> 00:49:43,363
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing is, you know, I don't play a lot of PC games because my computer sucks.

822
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:43,744
[SPEAKER_02]: And then...

823
00:49:44,912 --> 00:49:47,675
[SPEAKER_02]: PC Gaming PC Gaming PC Gaming PC Gaming

824
00:50:08,233 --> 00:50:10,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Big time sink games for me.

825
00:50:10,955 --> 00:50:14,257
[SPEAKER_10]: When he added up, I actually probably do more gaming on the PC than anywhere else.

826
00:50:14,517 --> 00:50:19,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised, though, Mac wasn't number one on there because I would have thought that Mac would be on there.

827
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:20,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.

828
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,140
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't one of the options.

829
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:21,981
[SPEAKER_02]: My mistake.

830
00:50:22,241 --> 00:50:22,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shut up.

831
00:50:22,781 --> 00:50:23,201
[SPEAKER_10]: No games.

832
00:50:23,602 --> 00:50:24,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

833
00:50:24,282 --> 00:50:24,562
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

834
00:50:24,882 --> 00:50:26,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Any more to that email, DarkSakra?

835
00:50:26,743 --> 00:50:27,564
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it for the mailbag.

836
00:50:28,084 --> 00:50:28,304
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

837
00:50:28,364 --> 00:50:31,386
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

838
00:50:33,287 --> 00:50:34,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Until then, more news.

839
00:50:34,688 --> 00:50:35,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, Logie?

840
00:50:36,131 --> 00:50:38,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course I have tons of news for you.

841
00:50:38,753 --> 00:50:46,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so yeah, there's... I'm pulling up different stories now.

842
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:56,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, there's some interesting rumors going around about the Metal Gear Solid movie, one of which is that Christian Bale is up for the role for Solid Snake himself.

843
00:50:56,988 --> 00:50:58,749
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'd be pretty interesting.

844
00:50:58,769 --> 00:51:01,451
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's from...

845
00:51:03,087 --> 00:51:32,676
[SPEAKER_02]: UK magazine called Nuts which I'm not really sure if I would I don't know how that would really rate there but they say he's in the running to play Salt Snake for the 2009 movie Metal Gear Solid and of course I don't know that's a big fat rumor I think I don't know I don't know if he'd look good as Snake though can't see him as Snake

846
00:51:33,868 --> 00:51:36,510
[SPEAKER_04]: They need someone who's a lot more hardcore.

847
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if Tom Selleck were younger.

848
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,492
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no.

849
00:51:40,832 --> 00:51:42,653
[SPEAKER_04]: If Kurt Russell were younger.

850
00:51:42,673 --> 00:51:43,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Kurt Russell, yeah.

851
00:51:44,214 --> 00:51:45,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Kurt Russell.

852
00:51:45,115 --> 00:51:46,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Kurt Russell would be able to do it.

853
00:51:46,695 --> 00:51:47,516
[SPEAKER_02]: He could play Old Snake.

854
00:51:48,336 --> 00:51:49,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Or even Richard Dean Anderson.

855
00:51:50,698 --> 00:51:51,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

856
00:51:51,118 --> 00:51:58,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you saw him in... No, I'm thinking of two people who played the same character in Stargate.

857
00:51:59,963 --> 00:52:00,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

858
00:52:01,784 --> 00:52:02,104
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

859
00:52:02,945 --> 00:52:03,205
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

860
00:52:03,883 --> 00:52:04,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Stargate.

861
00:52:04,823 --> 00:52:05,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

862
00:52:31,094 --> 00:52:31,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Not really.

863
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:37,716
[SPEAKER_10]: But they'll just kind of be using the PlayStation branding to try and launch a possible... I'm sorry.

864
00:52:37,976 --> 00:52:39,376
[SPEAKER_10]: There is not a gaming phone.

865
00:52:39,416 --> 00:52:39,936
[SPEAKER_10]: I should say this.

866
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:42,497
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no PSP phone slash thing or whatever.

867
00:52:42,897 --> 00:52:52,139
[SPEAKER_10]: But since Ericsson and PlayStation are under the same corporate entity, Sony, why not explore the possibilities of what could happen?

868
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:53,939
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

869
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:56,920
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to just bring out the freaking Vodafones over here and leave it at that.

870
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:58,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

871
00:52:59,062 --> 00:53:00,043
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting a Blackberry.

872
00:53:00,063 --> 00:53:01,744
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's going to be revised so many times.

873
00:53:02,464 --> 00:53:03,305
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting a Blackberry.

874
00:53:03,325 --> 00:53:03,945
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting a Blackberry.

875
00:53:03,985 --> 00:53:04,106
[SPEAKER_10]: I am.

876
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:34,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, for anyone who is interested in interesting ways of announcing games or hinting at games or starting weirdo rumors anyway.

877
00:53:35,929 --> 00:53:46,378
[SPEAKER_04]: For the demo for Tony Hawk Proving Ground, there is a poster that shows a sequel for Gun Magruder's Ghost.

878
00:53:48,219 --> 00:53:49,140
[SPEAKER_04]: So, is it a rumor?

879
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:49,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a tease?

880
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it wishful thinking?

881
00:53:51,201 --> 00:53:53,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it someone just trying to make it funny?

882
00:53:54,042 --> 00:53:57,544
[SPEAKER_04]: and Madden and what not.

883
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:23,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, this is kind of a little 180 of normal news.

884
00:54:24,084 --> 00:54:29,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Conan, the game that was supposed to be coming out at the end of October, got bumped up into September.

885
00:54:29,389 --> 00:54:34,494
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, now it's coming out the week of September 28th to compete with Halo.

886
00:54:34,635 --> 00:54:35,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray!

887
00:54:35,215 --> 00:54:42,082
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the smartest move, but it's nice to see that the game's actually going to be coming out earlier than expected.

888
00:54:43,011 --> 00:54:47,133
[SPEAKER_02]: It is going to be kind of a hack and slash action game.

889
00:54:47,653 --> 00:54:48,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Similar to God of War.

890
00:54:48,773 --> 00:54:49,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of blood.

891
00:54:49,674 --> 00:54:51,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's full frontal nudity.

892
00:54:51,174 --> 00:54:53,295
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hey, that's got two things that I need.

893
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:56,376
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's probably going to guarantee a sale.

894
00:54:56,456 --> 00:54:56,796
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

895
00:54:57,737 --> 00:54:59,317
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't get enough games with nudity.

896
00:54:59,917 --> 00:55:01,198
[SPEAKER_10]: We need more games with nudity.

897
00:55:01,258 --> 00:55:02,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn straight.

898
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:04,699
[SPEAKER_10]: That aren't like niche nudity games.

899
00:55:05,279 --> 00:55:06,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Manhunt 2 is supposed to have lots.

900
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,221
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a whole S&M club, I guess.

901
00:55:08,981 --> 00:55:11,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Like Playboy Mansion or whatever.

902
00:55:11,122 --> 00:55:12,042
[SPEAKER_10]: That's niche nudity.

903
00:55:12,472 --> 00:55:15,325
[SPEAKER_10]: I want like, you know, hardcore nudity in mainstream games.

904
00:55:17,469 --> 00:55:19,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that too much to ask for?

905
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:22,032
[SPEAKER_02]: BMX XXX was great.

906
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:22,853
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an awesome game.

907
00:55:22,893 --> 00:55:23,933
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a bad game, though.

908
00:55:23,973 --> 00:55:25,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but it's... It was not a bad game.

909
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,395
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.

910
00:55:26,455 --> 00:55:34,200
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, like, Dave mirrored his BMX, and it just had, like, weird shit, like, you know, impress a dog so it gets horny and fucks another dog.

911
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:37,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just weird shit, but it was just excuses for you to do tricks and stuff.

912
00:55:37,403 --> 00:55:38,563
[SPEAKER_04]: And you had to pick up the hooker.

913
00:55:38,804 --> 00:55:39,444
[SPEAKER_02]: And pick up the hookers.

914
00:55:39,484 --> 00:55:40,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a fun game.

915
00:55:41,085 --> 00:55:42,186
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really weird...

916
00:55:42,926 --> 00:55:44,566
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a game that makes fun of itself.

917
00:55:44,586 --> 00:55:47,207
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what really weird game I want them to make a new one of?

918
00:55:47,227 --> 00:55:47,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Jumping Flash.

919
00:56:09,625 --> 00:56:14,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, now Leo Kristoff in chat says, why do you want to pay for CGI porn?

920
00:56:14,668 --> 00:56:17,509
[SPEAKER_10]: And RossTLUT says, Sky, fuck no, I don't want porn games really.

921
00:56:18,029 --> 00:56:19,550
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, I don't want porn games.

922
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:23,612
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want random nudity inserted into video games.

923
00:56:24,312 --> 00:56:29,815
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like when you watch a movie and then you're watching the movie and you're like, oh, I didn't know I'd get that ass shot.

924
00:56:30,876 --> 00:56:31,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Life of Brian.

925
00:56:32,156 --> 00:56:36,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Where he comes out fully naked and addresses the crowd.

926
00:56:36,739 --> 00:56:37,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Where is that?

927
00:56:40,736 --> 00:56:46,742
[SPEAKER_10]: It's tasteful, artistic purposes, because games are art, after all.

928
00:56:46,782 --> 00:56:48,784
[SPEAKER_04]: We need random occurrences of naked.

929
00:56:51,746 --> 00:56:53,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I hope you guys know I'm half kidding.

930
00:56:53,688 --> 00:56:54,929
[SPEAKER_04]: And no ferret bestiality.

931
00:56:55,029 --> 00:56:57,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, DT, what the hell are you on?

932
00:56:57,932 --> 00:56:59,393
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm half kidding, chat room.

933
00:56:59,914 --> 00:57:00,515
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you guys know.

934
00:57:01,226 --> 00:57:09,812
[SPEAKER_10]: But there is no kidding around that PC is getting a new game called Stranglehold, which of course is coming to all the consoles as well.

935
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:17,058
[SPEAKER_10]: But Stranglehold is coming out this week on the consoles, but if you want to check out a demo, it's up now.

936
00:57:17,758 --> 00:57:23,142
[SPEAKER_10]: The game ships on September 18th, but the PC demo is available to download right now.

937
00:57:24,103 --> 00:57:30,728
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you want to check that out, go to your favorite downloading site, such as, you know, I don't know,

938
00:57:31,411 --> 00:57:31,871
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

939
00:58:00,797 --> 00:58:03,638
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's just so funny the way they're advertising the game to me.

940
00:58:03,678 --> 00:58:07,258
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, more stuff to blow up than any game ever.

941
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:09,679
[SPEAKER_10]: It just, I don't know, it made me laugh.

942
00:58:11,019 --> 00:58:14,760
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, that would be the whole reason I would buy a game is explosions.

943
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:21,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, speaking of things that aren't exploding, however, you can probably get some neat pyrotechnics included.

944
00:58:22,661 --> 00:58:29,023
[SPEAKER_04]: More information about Guitar Hero 3 Legends of Rock will be coming out on the PC and the Mac.

945
00:58:29,323 --> 00:58:30,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Games on a Mac!

946
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:32,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Snakes on a Plane, but not really.

947
00:58:34,464 --> 00:58:54,014
[SPEAKER_04]: It will have the same gameplay, same content as the console versions, unlockable, multiplayer mode, boss battles, I do believe downloadable content, which would make sense, and it's Guitar Hero...

948
00:58:55,512 --> 00:59:00,496
[SPEAKER_10]: And it'll be cracked so wide open that it'll be freely available before you know it.

949
00:59:00,817 --> 00:59:05,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's not that, but I'm waiting for people to crack this game to insert their own shit into it.

950
00:59:05,741 --> 00:59:10,225
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been done on PlayStation 2 and stuff, so... It's only a matter of time upon this release.

951
00:59:10,245 --> 00:59:12,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen PlayStation 2 ones done with Metroid Metal music.

952
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:22,055
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just want to say, though, shortly after the release of this game is when America's going to realize that we're just oversaturated with Guitar Hero crap and...

953
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,586
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the series will start to decline.

954
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:25,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Just about.

955
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:26,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like DDR.

956
00:59:27,627 --> 00:59:28,087
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

957
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:28,507
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

958
00:59:29,528 --> 00:59:29,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

959
00:59:31,509 --> 00:59:34,950
[SPEAKER_02]: So... And then my... There we go.

960
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:39,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo made an x64 mention that there's already something like that on PC called Fretz on Fire.

961
00:59:40,332 --> 00:59:41,793
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe that's why they want to do this.

962
00:59:42,013 --> 00:59:44,574
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, because they realize there is a market for the PC guitars.

963
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:44,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

964
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:46,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's how we get, like, in the groove.

965
00:59:47,151 --> 00:59:47,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

966
00:59:48,712 --> 00:59:51,875
[SPEAKER_02]: So, GameStop, once again, we're talking about them.

967
00:59:52,035 --> 00:59:55,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're planning on catering to the casual gamer.

968
00:59:57,058 --> 00:59:57,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

969
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:03,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, they're going to be redesigning their stores or rearranging them, kind of as a test.

970
01:00:03,963 --> 01:00:09,567
[SPEAKER_02]: What they're going to do is they're going to have a couple new sections, including one dedicated to the children's and family games.

971
01:00:10,388 --> 01:00:14,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Another section is going to be dedicated to, I guess...

972
01:00:15,586 --> 01:00:17,728
[SPEAKER_02]: New reason to go to GameStop?

973
01:00:17,748 --> 01:00:18,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.

974
01:00:39,474 --> 01:00:46,719
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to go to Fry's today, an electronics store nearby that's pretty big, because none of the GameStops within a 111 mile radius had any PSP cables.

975
01:01:01,994 --> 01:01:02,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

976
01:01:02,334 --> 01:01:02,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Not cool.

977
01:01:03,815 --> 01:01:05,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can still go to GameCrazy and buy Genesis.

978
01:01:05,796 --> 01:01:07,077
[SPEAKER_02]: There are options, folks.

979
01:01:07,157 --> 01:01:09,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't need to necessarily go to GameStop.

980
01:01:09,398 --> 01:01:10,579
[SPEAKER_02]: And also think about this.

981
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:15,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, I bought the collector's edition of Bioshock so I can get the Big Daddy.

982
01:01:17,042 --> 01:01:20,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Would I really have missed it if I didn't buy the collector's edition?

983
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:21,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.

984
01:01:21,805 --> 01:01:27,688
[SPEAKER_02]: So, don't be fooled in buying this shit for crappy little trinkets that you probably don't need anyways.

985
01:01:27,948 --> 01:01:29,409
[SPEAKER_04]: GameCrazy needs your money.

986
01:01:30,369 --> 01:01:31,390
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm going to say.

987
01:01:32,541 --> 01:01:33,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they need a lot of money.

988
01:01:33,782 --> 01:01:35,103
[SPEAKER_04]: They need a whole lot of money.

989
01:01:36,404 --> 01:01:36,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

990
01:01:37,745 --> 01:01:38,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

991
01:01:38,645 --> 01:01:40,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, is that it for the news tonight?

992
01:01:40,507 --> 01:01:41,027
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it is.

993
01:01:41,047 --> 01:01:41,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

994
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:45,430
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is where we open up the Skype line and let you guys interact with our program.

995
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:47,511
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to give us a call, our phone number is 1-877-GAMEOLR.

996
01:01:50,109 --> 01:01:55,332
[SPEAKER_10]: or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio and Skype line is open and you guys can give us a call.

997
01:01:56,573 --> 01:01:57,513
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll wait for some calls.

998
01:01:57,553 --> 01:01:59,655
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, our listenership seems to be down a little bit tonight.

999
01:01:59,675 --> 01:02:03,917
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if that's the Emmys to thank for that or back to school or the fact that our show just sucks.

1000
01:02:04,077 --> 01:02:08,300
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what it is, but we don't have a lot of live listeners as much as usual tonight.

1001
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:13,703
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm hoping that we get some calls at some point, but the line is open.

1002
01:02:13,943 --> 01:02:15,244
[SPEAKER_10]: So go ahead and start calling.

1003
01:02:15,604 --> 01:02:17,245
[SPEAKER_10]: In the meantime, do we have any last minute stories?

1004
01:02:17,745 --> 01:02:19,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

1005
01:02:19,226 --> 01:02:19,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

1006
01:02:19,673 --> 01:02:22,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, let's start off here, of course, Colin McRae.

1007
01:02:23,316 --> 01:02:24,997
[SPEAKER_02]: He's died in a helicopter crash.

1008
01:02:25,537 --> 01:02:32,062
[SPEAKER_02]: You may remember him from such rally racing events that have happened, of course, in Europe.

1009
01:02:32,702 --> 01:02:40,648
[SPEAKER_02]: And also because he's had his name on various rally racing games, including Dirt, which is actually pretty awesome.

1010
01:02:40,748 --> 01:02:43,190
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately, he has passed away.

1011
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:45,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, also...

1012
01:02:47,403 --> 01:02:53,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna say that China, this is funny, China's gaming companies are trying to combat piracy.

1013
01:02:54,668 --> 01:02:57,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that gets you to laugh, I don't know what will, so.

1014
01:02:58,771 --> 01:02:59,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1015
01:02:59,712 --> 01:03:02,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, China is just...

1016
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:05,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Big on, you know, a ton of piracy stuff coming out there.

1017
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:07,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but that's, you know, that's a scene.

1018
01:03:07,256 --> 01:03:11,840
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't, you know, label everybody as, you know, participating in the piracy rings.

1019
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:12,481
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, fine.

1020
01:03:12,701 --> 01:03:12,961
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1021
01:03:13,762 --> 01:03:14,582
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got calls on Skype.

1022
01:03:14,602 --> 01:03:15,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to that.

1023
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,064
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get the rest of your stories in a minute.

1024
01:03:16,324 --> 01:03:17,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1025
01:03:17,485 --> 01:03:18,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Caller, are you there?

1026
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:21,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I am, and it's not Raven's Dolphin.

1027
01:03:21,788 --> 01:03:22,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, who is it then?

1028
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:28,874
[SPEAKER_10]: It's DJ Ranma S. Well, hello, DJ Ranma S. So somebody different got through first for once this week.

1029
01:03:28,934 --> 01:03:29,755
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, what's on your mind, buddy?

1030
01:03:30,734 --> 01:03:31,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much.

1031
01:03:31,755 --> 01:03:40,342
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make a comment about the whole GameStop thing about the manager who got basically suspended for only selling games to smart people.

1032
01:03:41,022 --> 01:03:51,771
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say I don't blame him for doing that because I used to work in a video store and the video store was like right by the schools and they would come in all the time and mess the place up.

1033
01:03:51,831 --> 01:03:54,673
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we started doing stuff like that.

1034
01:03:54,693 --> 01:04:00,017
[SPEAKER_01]: We started doing like a program where if you had good grades, you get free rentals and stuff.

1035
01:04:00,444 --> 01:04:07,070
[SPEAKER_01]: We were basically like a mom and pop store and we basically knew the families and stuff like that would come in all the time.

1036
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:13,815
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, you know, we basically knew if you weren't doing too well in school and stuff, you weren't renting games at all.

1037
01:04:13,855 --> 01:04:14,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Simple as that.

1038
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:18,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm sorry.

1039
01:04:18,419 --> 01:04:19,320
[SPEAKER_10]: I was typing in chat.

1040
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:19,660
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1041
01:04:21,541 --> 01:04:21,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1042
01:04:22,022 --> 01:04:22,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody's like, I'm sorry.

1043
01:04:22,802 --> 01:04:23,043
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1044
01:04:23,123 --> 01:04:24,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Restate your question real quick.

1045
01:04:25,365 --> 01:04:28,047
[SPEAKER_01]: What I said was I used to work at a mom and pop store.

1046
01:04:28,067 --> 01:04:29,328
[SPEAKER_01]: We basically did the same thing.

1047
01:04:29,388 --> 01:04:29,488
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

1048
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:30,671
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1049
01:04:51,246 --> 01:04:58,749
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew, the parents knew, basically knew they weren't doing their homework because they were too busy mulling around in our store checking out the games and stuff like that.

1050
01:04:58,789 --> 01:05:10,593
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to like kick them out from time to time and just like, you know, it's like 3, 3, 4 o'clock, you've been here over an hour, you should be at home doing your homework instead of drooling over the games that you want to buy or rent, simple as that.

1051
01:05:10,653 --> 01:05:10,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

1052
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:34,571
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't have a problem with people kicking out loiters, but, I mean, I don't think it's a great business practice to turn away business, especially when most of the mom-and-pop stores I talk to on a daily basis are having trouble selling games, let alone, you know, they're not, like, swimming in money, so I wouldn't, I would highly, you know, advise against it, despite how tempting it may be.

1053
01:05:36,072 --> 01:05:38,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Mystic Gohan says, what if my homework is to play a game?

1054
01:05:38,752 --> 01:05:40,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

1055
01:05:41,288 --> 01:05:42,028
[SPEAKER_10]: That was from our chat.

1056
01:05:42,649 --> 01:05:44,530
[SPEAKER_10]: So that went over okay?

1057
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:45,850
[SPEAKER_10]: There wasn't a lot of controversy there?

1058
01:05:47,131 --> 01:05:48,772
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not at all, you know.

1059
01:05:49,252 --> 01:05:54,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, we were supposed to, everybody knew each other, and it was pretty cool about it, you know.

1060
01:05:55,415 --> 01:06:03,639
[SPEAKER_01]: And, I mean, overall, I don't blame this manager for doing it, but it's not his job to be the parent of all these kids, you know.

1061
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:08,862
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these parents should be more responsible and stuff like that, you know.

1062
01:06:09,654 --> 01:06:10,575
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way I see it.

1063
01:06:11,275 --> 01:06:15,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall, I give them points for doing that, but not at the risk of your job, you know?

1064
01:06:17,277 --> 01:06:17,558
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1065
01:06:18,398 --> 01:06:22,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you for the insight, I guess, from having been working for a game store that used to kind of do this.

1066
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:24,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

1067
01:06:25,881 --> 01:06:27,842
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's just, I just want to throw my two cents about that.

1068
01:06:27,882 --> 01:06:28,462
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.

1069
01:06:28,582 --> 01:06:29,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I appreciate it.

1070
01:06:29,243 --> 01:06:30,243
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry I missed you the first time.

1071
01:06:30,263 --> 01:06:34,345
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought someone else was listening and I was trying to work on a question that got asked in chat.

1072
01:06:34,485 --> 01:06:36,626
[SPEAKER_10]: So I didn't want you to feel like I was ignoring you.

1073
01:06:36,686 --> 01:06:37,066
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

1074
01:06:37,406 --> 01:06:38,907
[SPEAKER_10]: We multitask while doing the show.

1075
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:40,661
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that feeling.

1076
01:06:41,141 --> 01:06:41,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care, buddy.

1077
01:06:42,862 --> 01:06:43,162
[SPEAKER_10]: You too.

1078
01:06:43,443 --> 01:06:43,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.

1079
01:07:02,805 --> 01:07:08,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny enough, if you purchase it through Best Buy, you get three hidden tracks.

1080
01:07:08,869 --> 01:07:11,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, anybody can get the hidden tracks.

1081
01:07:11,391 --> 01:07:15,133
[SPEAKER_02]: And funny enough, it's the Konami code which unlocks those hidden tracks.

1082
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:18,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Despite the fact that the game is actually being made by Ubisoft.

1083
01:07:18,615 --> 01:07:25,220
[SPEAKER_02]: So, to unlock Brad Paisley, I'm Gonna Miss Her, Jimi Hendrix, Wild Thing, and Tom Petty, Needles and Pins...

1084
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:31,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Simply push up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, during free mode, and it will give you those three songs.

1085
01:07:31,926 --> 01:07:32,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, and what game is this?

1086
01:07:33,168 --> 01:07:33,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Jam Sessions.

1087
01:07:34,629 --> 01:07:36,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't this a game that some of our listeners told you to stay away from?

1088
01:07:36,851 --> 01:07:37,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1089
01:07:37,352 --> 01:07:37,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

1090
01:07:37,732 --> 01:07:39,274
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, let's go to the phones.

1091
01:07:39,354 --> 01:07:40,355
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got another call coming in.

1092
01:07:40,395 --> 01:07:41,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1093
01:07:41,376 --> 01:07:41,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1094
01:07:43,158 --> 01:07:43,898
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Jason.

1095
01:07:44,098 --> 01:07:44,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Jason.

1096
01:07:44,839 --> 01:07:47,081
[SPEAKER_07]: We do need a new jumping flash now.

1097
01:07:47,442 --> 01:07:48,143
[SPEAKER_10]: A new jumping flash.

1098
01:07:48,163 --> 01:07:48,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Amen.

1099
01:07:49,908 --> 01:07:53,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh man, Jamie said that and I smiled so big.

1100
01:07:54,010 --> 01:08:15,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Jumping Flash was my first ever PlayStation game back when Blockbuster still rented out the systems and I paid the $150 deposit and I rented the system along with Jumping Flash and Revolution X. Revolution X was awful at home though.

1101
01:08:17,143 --> 01:08:20,046
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was when I actually owned it.

1102
01:08:45,498 --> 01:08:49,383
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a freshman in college and my roommate's boyfriend had a Playstation but my friend had imported a Saturn

1103
01:09:03,033 --> 01:09:04,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Hire CDs for whaling bonus

1104
01:09:29,003 --> 01:09:29,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Golden Axe The Duel

1105
01:09:57,844 --> 01:09:59,305
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even know they made that game on Saturn.

1106
01:09:59,506 --> 01:10:01,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, it was actually a good game.

1107
01:10:02,228 --> 01:10:05,891
[SPEAKER_07]: I only remember two or three things about the Saturn.

1108
01:10:06,612 --> 01:10:12,938
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them was a friend of mine with the extra memory chip or something like that.

1109
01:10:12,998 --> 01:10:15,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Something along those lines, some kind of an expansion chip.

1110
01:10:16,261 --> 01:10:19,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Knights and some weird mech game that I played at.

1111
01:10:20,473 --> 01:10:22,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I don't even remember where it was anymore.

1112
01:10:22,253 --> 01:10:28,075
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was at Hastings or something like that on one of their demo kiosks, but I next to no idea what it is anymore.

1113
01:10:28,675 --> 01:10:30,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Saturn was the machine you had if you were an importer, though.

1114
01:10:31,335 --> 01:10:36,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you had arcade-perfect copies of Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighters, X-Men vs. Street Fighter.

1115
01:10:38,617 --> 01:10:43,038
[SPEAKER_04]: You had all the King of Fighters games, even though the load time was just completely ridiculous.

1116
01:10:43,618 --> 01:10:44,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Virtual Lawn.

1117
01:10:46,078 --> 01:10:47,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Ready for the beginning, CD systems.

1118
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:48,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of.

1119
01:10:49,671 --> 01:10:52,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Sonic 3 didn't crash horribly.

1120
01:10:54,574 --> 01:10:59,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and RawSteelUT points out that all the Working Designs games came out for Saturn, like the Rayearth RPG.

1121
01:11:00,917 --> 01:11:05,779
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually did get games for the Sega CD.

1122
01:11:05,819 --> 01:11:09,001
[SPEAKER_04]: We had Popful Mail over here from Working Designs.

1123
01:11:10,329 --> 01:11:10,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, of course.

1124
01:11:10,930 --> 01:11:13,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to the people that did own the Saturn.

1125
01:11:13,351 --> 01:11:18,033
[SPEAKER_04]: The notion that that was the importer's console, yes, that was very true now that I think about it.

1126
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:34,713
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny, Dan and I used to hook up our Saturn and our PlayStation and have the same games in them.

1127
01:11:34,933 --> 01:11:37,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we actually had a few of the games that were the same on both systems.

1128
01:11:37,855 --> 01:11:39,396
[SPEAKER_04]: And we would compare what they looked like.

1129
01:11:39,936 --> 01:11:43,798
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Saturn was it for anything that was 2D or required a lot of memory.

1130
01:11:44,619 --> 01:11:47,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though the PlayStation was built for 3D.

1131
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:52,243
[SPEAKER_04]: We compared Symphony of the Night, because I have the Japanese one on the Saturn.

1132
01:11:53,157 --> 01:12:04,800
[SPEAKER_04]: and all the 3D effects looked a lot better on the PlayStation, of course, but all of the sprites and the music was better on the Saturn because I think the Saturn had a better sound processor.

1133
01:12:05,641 --> 01:12:09,762
[SPEAKER_07]: The music being better was really common to pretty much every game on the Saturn, wasn't it?

1134
01:12:10,422 --> 01:12:11,302
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

1135
01:12:11,742 --> 01:12:13,823
[SPEAKER_07]: I do remember hearing something along those lines.

1136
01:12:14,083 --> 01:12:21,905
[SPEAKER_04]: They did have a lot of games, too, that were Redbook and also other games that were pointed out were Guardian Heroes, Panzer Dragoon, Sonic Jam, Silhouette Mirage.

1137
01:12:22,563 --> 01:12:49,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Dragon Force Sonic Jam, yes, that one is a very big deal I remember my girlfriend really complaining about Sonic Jam's collection of the fact that they used the Sega CD version of Sonic Jam instead of the Saturn version because the Saturn version actually had the true epic music composed to not just a synthesized MIDI-ish sound

1138
01:12:49,788 --> 01:12:54,653
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, yes, the world of difference right there.

1139
01:12:56,395 --> 01:12:58,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, that's like a trip down memory lane here.

1140
01:12:58,637 --> 01:13:05,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, also, for me being an importer, I actually lucked into a copy of Grandia on Saturn.

1141
01:13:06,184 --> 01:13:09,447
[SPEAKER_04]: And comparing that to the PlayStation 1, oh my god.

1142
01:13:09,788 --> 01:13:11,189
[SPEAKER_04]: The PlayStation 1 was crap.

1143
01:13:11,289 --> 01:13:13,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the 3D was crap in it.

1144
01:13:13,883 --> 01:13:16,165
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was so much better on Saturn.

1145
01:13:16,545 --> 01:13:21,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Music, you actually had a bigger view field so you could see more stuff that was going on in the game.

1146
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:23,410
[SPEAKER_04]: The timing was better.

1147
01:13:23,871 --> 01:13:26,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything came out so much better on the Saturn version.

1148
01:13:27,193 --> 01:13:30,236
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Sega fanboys, we've got to wrap up and go to another call.

1149
01:13:30,296 --> 01:13:32,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Jason, any last thoughts quickly before we move on?

1150
01:13:34,659 --> 01:13:39,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Bust a Move Bash with the Wii controller is absolutely amazing.

1151
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,003
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes so much sense.

1152
01:13:42,144 --> 01:13:43,266
[SPEAKER_07]: It plays so well.

1153
01:13:43,366 --> 01:13:45,010
[SPEAKER_07]: It is very, very fun.

1154
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:45,611
[SPEAKER_08]: What game?

1155
01:13:46,995 --> 01:13:47,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Bust a Move Bash.

1156
01:13:48,017 --> 01:13:49,600
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a puzzle game where you can play up to...

1157
01:13:51,328 --> 01:13:52,529
[SPEAKER_02]: 8 players at one time.

1158
01:13:52,589 --> 01:13:56,791
[SPEAKER_10]: My mind went to the old dance game and I was like, there's a fucking new bus to move out?

1159
01:13:57,231 --> 01:13:58,552
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it would have.

1160
01:13:58,652 --> 01:14:02,233
[SPEAKER_07]: I should have said Puzzle Bobble Bash because it would make more sense to you pretty much immediately.

1161
01:14:02,333 --> 01:14:02,914
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's alright.

1162
01:14:02,934 --> 01:14:07,476
[SPEAKER_07]: But the move bash for the Wiimote control is so intuitive.

1163
01:14:07,596 --> 01:14:09,357
[SPEAKER_07]: It is so easy to pick up and play.

1164
01:14:09,377 --> 01:14:10,197
[SPEAKER_07]: It is so fun.

1165
01:14:10,477 --> 01:14:10,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

1166
01:14:11,017 --> 01:14:11,978
[SPEAKER_10]: I might have to check it out.

1167
01:14:12,038 --> 01:14:12,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1168
01:14:12,939 --> 01:14:16,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Rinse it, buy it, pretty cheap, give it a shot.

1169
01:14:16,281 --> 01:14:16,721
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun.

1170
01:14:16,901 --> 01:14:21,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though I've played this game like 50 times, this will be worth it, right?

1171
01:14:22,064 --> 01:14:23,325
[SPEAKER_07]: You might want to play it on mute.

1172
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:25,226
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll warn you that.

1173
01:14:25,626 --> 01:14:28,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, maybe I can use my custom soundtracks with the Winamp.

1174
01:14:28,267 --> 01:14:28,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully.

1175
01:14:28,788 --> 01:14:29,148
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

1176
01:14:30,168 --> 01:14:31,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, that's true, huh?

1177
01:14:31,389 --> 01:14:31,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

1178
01:14:31,929 --> 01:14:32,770
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't gotten up yet.

1179
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:33,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to.

1180
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:35,751
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Jason, we've got to let you go, but have a good one, okay, buddy?

1181
01:14:36,832 --> 01:14:37,132
[SPEAKER_10]: You too.

1182
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:38,053
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, bye-bye.

1183
01:14:38,653 --> 01:14:39,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Night.

1184
01:14:39,453 --> 01:14:42,195
[SPEAKER_10]: We always like hearing from Jason, our fearless webmaster.

1185
01:14:43,206 --> 01:14:44,346
[SPEAKER_10]: for OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

1186
01:14:44,366 --> 01:14:48,688
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll probably take one more call, then we're going to call it a night because we are running a little bit long tonight.

1187
01:14:48,708 --> 01:14:50,069
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what's going on with that.

1188
01:14:50,129 --> 01:14:52,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Another last-minute story real quick, Loki, if you have any more.

1189
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:53,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1190
01:14:53,810 --> 01:14:54,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any?

1191
01:14:55,111 --> 01:14:55,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a whole ton.

1192
01:14:56,531 --> 01:14:59,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, they were talking a little bit bizarre.

1193
01:14:59,472 --> 01:15:02,514
[SPEAKER_02]: They were talking about Project Gotham Racing 5 and what they want to do with that.

1194
01:15:03,434 --> 01:15:09,676
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that they're looking to do is possibly off-road stuff, including quad bikes and off-road tracks.

1195
01:15:10,557 --> 01:15:11,217
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of neat.

1196
01:15:12,077 --> 01:15:14,879
[SPEAKER_10]: GS68 Yeah, you know that thing about the New Jersey parents reacting to the Wii Zapper?

1197
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:16,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was particularly offended.

1198
01:15:16,521 --> 01:15:18,442
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, for fuck's sake, I grew up with light gun games.

1199
01:15:19,323 --> 01:15:19,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1200
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:38,520
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1201
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:48,329
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and I wonder, like, at the carnivals, like, even before the days of video games, I mean, they still have this at, like, the county fairs and the state fairs and the various carnivals around.

1202
01:15:48,589 --> 01:15:56,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't they have those BB gun shooting games where you shoot pellets, as many pellets as you can, through the little silhouette, and if you can, like, punch out the star completely, you get a prize?

1203
01:15:56,776 --> 01:15:58,117
[SPEAKER_04]: They have better than that now.

1204
01:15:58,517 --> 01:16:00,639
[SPEAKER_04]: They have shoot the paintballs at the man thing.

1205
01:16:01,019 --> 01:16:01,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

1206
01:16:01,399 --> 01:16:04,182
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a guy in riot gear, and you can shoot him with paintballs.

1207
01:16:04,622 --> 01:16:04,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1208
01:16:05,303 --> 01:16:11,106
[SPEAKER_10]: And don't they have, um, they also have, uh, shooting, like, you know, remember, like, that fucking thing they have at Scandia?

1209
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:17,210
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like that whole elaborate setup with, like, the Wild West, you can shoot, like... I think you have one of those at Tilt.

1210
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:22,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so, anyway, I mean, yeah, these types of games existed long before, uh, video games.

1211
01:16:22,754 --> 01:16:26,316
[SPEAKER_10]: So these are just a couple of dumbasses who somehow got their name in the media.

1212
01:16:26,336 --> 01:16:26,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1213
01:16:27,396 --> 01:16:29,076
[SPEAKER_09]: And don't get me started with Nerf guns.

1214
01:16:29,196 --> 01:16:32,057
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they're obviously for kids, and they shoot real projectiles.

1215
01:16:32,337 --> 01:16:33,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Super Soaker.

1216
01:16:33,377 --> 01:16:35,558
[SPEAKER_09]: I keep thinking of that one commercial that's all over YouTube.

1217
01:16:35,598 --> 01:16:39,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because it was a warrior that says not to shoot someone in the face with it.

1218
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:40,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

1219
01:16:40,519 --> 01:16:42,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I like getting Super Soakers and putting ink in them.

1220
01:16:43,299 --> 01:16:44,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would you do that?

1221
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:44,419
[SPEAKER_04]: That's mean.

1222
01:16:44,459 --> 01:16:46,780
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to when I was in middle school.

1223
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:47,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would you do that?

1224
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:48,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we were mean.

1225
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:50,661
[SPEAKER_10]: You were a bad child.

1226
01:16:51,301 --> 01:16:52,041
[SPEAKER_10]: I just take it back.

1227
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:52,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Ugh.

1228
01:16:53,891 --> 01:16:55,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, I agree with you, GS68.

1229
01:16:55,972 --> 01:16:57,633
[SPEAKER_10]: These people are dumbasses, but what can you do?

1230
01:16:58,013 --> 01:16:59,554
[SPEAKER_10]: In every village, there's an idiot, right?

1231
01:17:00,675 --> 01:17:00,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1232
01:17:02,476 --> 01:17:04,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1233
01:17:05,597 --> 01:17:06,778
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think so.

1234
01:17:07,298 --> 01:17:07,578
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1235
01:17:07,879 --> 01:17:08,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you for your rant.

1236
01:17:09,099 --> 01:17:11,160
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate it, and it fits in well with our program.

1237
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:12,421
[SPEAKER_10]: No problem.

1238
01:17:12,521 --> 01:17:12,801
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1239
01:17:13,141 --> 01:17:13,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye-bye, dude.

1240
01:17:14,642 --> 01:17:14,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1241
01:17:15,863 --> 01:17:16,163
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1242
01:17:16,581 --> 01:17:18,542
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

1243
01:17:18,822 --> 01:17:20,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you to those that got through.

1244
01:17:20,263 --> 01:17:21,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to those that didn't.

1245
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:35,209
[SPEAKER_10]: The new Skype is so weird because I can't, like, if five calls are coming in at once, I have to hang up on four to answer the one, and then the people that I hung up on will try to call right back.

1246
01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:36,330
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can never pick up a call.

1247
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:39,471
[SPEAKER_10]: So now I have to force the calls to go to voicemail if we're already in a call.

1248
01:17:39,772 --> 01:17:44,394
[SPEAKER_10]: But then, like, it's, you know, the people that keep, like, calling back in seem to get, like, right through.

1249
01:17:44,434 --> 01:17:44,974
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really weird.

1250
01:17:46,035 --> 01:17:46,496
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know.

1251
01:17:46,836 --> 01:17:47,236
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

1252
01:17:47,256 --> 01:17:48,336
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see what we can do with Skype.

1253
01:17:48,376 --> 01:17:50,597
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want the old version back.

1254
01:17:51,038 --> 01:17:51,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, last minute news.

1255
01:17:52,178 --> 01:17:58,961
[SPEAKER_02]: To go back to what we were talking about earlier, Eternal Sonata has definitely been confirmed for the PlayStation 3.

1256
01:17:59,202 --> 01:18:02,303
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it will be shown at Tokyo Game Show in video form only.

1257
01:18:02,723 --> 01:18:12,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's actually some updates on what the PlayStation 3 will have that the Xbox 360 one won't, including new playable characters and a new clothing system in the works.

1258
01:18:13,331 --> 01:18:14,052
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1259
01:18:36,890 --> 01:18:40,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Accompanying this is an increase in costume variations.

1260
01:18:40,672 --> 01:18:46,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, PlayStation 3 owners will have to wait until 2008 to get their hands on this RPG update.

1261
01:18:47,676 --> 01:18:48,877
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of funny.

1262
01:18:49,797 --> 01:18:52,379
[SPEAKER_02]: And some other things real quick.

1263
01:18:52,579 --> 01:18:56,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot Shots Golf Online is coming out on PSP.

1264
01:18:56,961 --> 01:19:00,043
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's another thing that's going to be shown at Tokyo Game Show.

1265
01:19:00,443 --> 01:19:05,586
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as there's going to be a free online RPG coming to the PlayStation 3 from Q Entertainment.

1266
01:19:06,343 --> 01:19:07,404
[SPEAKER_02]: That is interesting.

1267
01:19:08,104 --> 01:19:12,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's going to be... Oh, God, I hope that's not the actual... Oh, no.

1268
01:19:12,868 --> 01:19:15,530
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the one we were talking about before, Angel Love Online.

1269
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:20,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the one where you have to have sex with people and you get impregnated or something.

1270
01:19:20,093 --> 01:19:21,033
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1271
01:19:21,254 --> 01:19:21,874
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one, though.

1272
01:19:21,894 --> 01:19:22,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw it on Kotaku.

1273
01:19:22,454 --> 01:19:23,235
[SPEAKER_10]: From Q Entertainment?

1274
01:19:23,295 --> 01:19:23,535
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1275
01:19:23,915 --> 01:19:25,216
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's something else.

1276
01:19:25,336 --> 01:19:35,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Angel Love Online is what it's called, but I swear to God, I thought there was something that you had to impregnate women or something, and then you created new characters based off that or something.

1277
01:19:35,063 --> 01:19:35,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1278
01:19:36,608 --> 01:19:38,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Crisis Core is not the last Final Fantasy 7 game.

1279
01:19:54,172 --> 01:19:56,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I can only hope that Crisis Core is the last Final Fantasy 7 game.

1280
01:19:56,934 --> 01:19:58,475
[SPEAKER_10]: There's way too damn many.

1281
01:19:58,695 --> 01:20:03,739
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, a Kingdom Hearts 0 would make a lot of sense because the creators come out and said the next game is not Kingdom Hearts 3.

1282
01:20:04,279 --> 01:20:05,821
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be a cute little trick to play.

1283
01:20:06,321 --> 01:20:07,462
[SPEAKER_10]: That it's actually Kingdom Hearts 0.

1284
01:20:08,122 --> 01:20:08,923
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the thing.

1285
01:20:09,103 --> 01:20:14,627
[SPEAKER_10]: If it doesn't have the Disney tie-in this time, like if that's their way to not have Disney tie-ins this time, I'm not buying it.

1286
01:20:14,967 --> 01:20:16,889
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, but the Disney tie-ins make that game.

1287
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:17,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1288
01:20:18,529 --> 01:20:47,412
[SPEAKER_02]: and then the other thing this is kind of going to DDR Universe apparently if you were one of those people that downloaded the download content for Universe 1 it will not be compatible with Universe 2 unlike the Ultra Mix series where all your download content was transferable to each additional game so sucks if you downloaded that one thing that they had so that's interesting well

1289
01:20:47,933 --> 01:20:49,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is kind of cool.

1290
01:20:49,414 --> 01:20:51,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Something I wouldn't mind looking forward to.

1291
01:20:52,097 --> 01:21:00,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, the developer that brought us R-Type, Irem, they're bringing out SteamBot 2 on PS3 for anyone who's interested.

1292
01:21:00,744 --> 01:21:03,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Over in Japan, it's Bumpy Trot.

1293
01:21:03,766 --> 01:21:09,211
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a non-linear action-adventure game.

1294
01:21:09,991 --> 01:21:12,693
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a comparison made between GTA and Harvest Moon.

1295
01:21:13,914 --> 01:21:14,915
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that'd be pretty cool.

1296
01:21:15,636 --> 01:21:15,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1297
01:21:17,221 --> 01:21:18,722
[SPEAKER_10]: GTA meets Harvest Moon.

1298
01:21:18,742 --> 01:21:19,302
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.

1299
01:21:21,444 --> 01:21:24,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Milk my cow, now die!

1300
01:21:25,607 --> 01:21:26,988
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that good of a game.

1301
01:21:27,108 --> 01:21:27,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me.

1302
01:21:27,729 --> 01:21:28,489
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome.

1303
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:32,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Farmer.

1304
01:21:32,612 --> 01:21:34,754
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not quite.

1305
01:21:36,255 --> 01:21:37,756
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

1306
01:21:37,796 --> 01:21:41,599
[SPEAKER_10]: If that's it for the last minute stories, then that means it's time to wrap up this damn show.

1307
01:21:42,059 --> 01:21:43,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1308
01:21:45,001 --> 01:21:46,261
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll start off with Loki tonight.

1309
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:47,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, what's your final thought?

1310
01:21:47,442 --> 01:21:50,903
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is I don't want to see the next Resident Evil movie.

1311
01:21:52,263 --> 01:21:56,525
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is I am craving a Marie Callender's pie right now.

1312
01:21:56,545 --> 01:21:58,225
[SPEAKER_10]: I want pie so bad it hurts.

1313
01:21:58,865 --> 01:22:02,867
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to buy a pie for a potluck and then we left before we even got to dessert.

1314
01:22:03,167 --> 01:22:05,268
[SPEAKER_10]: So my poor pie, I had to leave.

1315
01:22:06,448 --> 01:22:07,208
[SPEAKER_10]: Poor baby.

1316
01:22:07,508 --> 01:22:08,148
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, poor me.

1317
01:22:09,229 --> 01:22:10,309
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, your final thought?

1318
01:22:10,989 --> 01:22:12,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to wake up at four in the morning.

1319
01:22:14,301 --> 01:22:19,644
[SPEAKER_04]: because I have to be at work at 6 so that I can leave at 10 and go to a dentist appointment.

1320
01:22:21,264 --> 01:22:24,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Fortunately for me, it's just a routine cleaning and I always fall asleep.

1321
01:22:25,446 --> 01:22:26,387
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I get to go home.

1322
01:22:26,587 --> 01:22:27,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Lucky you.

1323
01:22:27,748 --> 01:22:34,291
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because these very comfortable chairs at my dentist's office and they're cushy and they're completely ergonomic.

1324
01:22:34,771 --> 01:22:36,552
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you're laying in them, you're not like,

1325
01:22:37,102 --> 01:22:38,142
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1326
01:23:03,425 --> 01:23:04,726
[SPEAKER_10]: and letting us know you care.

1327
01:23:05,327 --> 01:23:09,531
[SPEAKER_10]: That keeps us going from week to week for almost 250 shows now, if you can believe it.

1328
01:23:11,512 --> 01:23:12,634
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's going to do it for this week.

1329
01:23:12,674 --> 01:23:18,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, if you like our show, all we ask, tell two people you know about the show, because if everybody tells two people, then slowly we take over the world.

1330
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:22,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Or if you have no friends, which would be sad, and I'm sorry for one.

1331
01:23:23,257 --> 01:23:24,618
[SPEAKER_10]: but if you have no friends you can tell about the show.

1332
01:23:24,638 --> 01:23:25,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell your imaginary friends.

1333
01:23:26,179 --> 01:23:29,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Leave us a review on iTunes, a positive review on iTunes or any other type of site.

1334
01:23:30,141 --> 01:23:34,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Your dig.coms, your Yahoo podcasts, your podcast alley, hell there's a million of them.

1335
01:23:35,485 --> 01:23:36,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Spread the love.

1336
01:23:37,286 --> 01:23:41,849
