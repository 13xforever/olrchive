Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:27,300
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Part B of our podcast for this September the 16th of 2007.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,300
And of course remember as always, Orange Lounge Radio is released in two parts.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,800
So if you haven't heard tonight's Part A, you're only here in half the show.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,300
So head on over to orangeloungeradio.com for more information on how to download our show

9
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,300
and catch up on everything that you've missed.

10
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,300
But for now, Loki's going to take us right back into the gaming news.

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,300
I am?

12
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,300
You are.

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,300
Okay, I am.

14
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,300
Just kidding.

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:53,300
Anyways, so there was a game that we saw a couple years back when they were first showing off the Wii.

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,300
And it was kind of neat.

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,300
I thought the title was retarded, but whatever.

18
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,300
So there's this game, Project Hammer.

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,300
And while people were speculating, is it on hold?

20
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,300
What's going on?

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,300
Well, according to Famitsu, it's been cancelled.

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,300
And it's not coming back.

23
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:17,300
So that's too bad because who doesn't like hitting people with a giant cybernetic hammer?

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,300
Yeah, I remember the game seemed alright at E3 in the demos.

25
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,300
It was there the first year the Wii was there, last year in 06.

26
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,300
It wasn't that long ago.

27
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,300
Yeah, I'm surprised.

28
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,300
The last big E3 or whatever you want to call it.

29
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,300
I'm surprised that it looked cool.

30
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,300
I don't know why they wouldn't put it out.

31
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,300
Or just some other company put it out.

32
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,300
Seriously.

33
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,300
It wasn't bad.

34
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,300
It's better than DK Bongo Blast.

35
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,300
I wonder why they ended up canceling it.

36
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,300
I wonder what we're going to get instead.

37
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:49,300
Because sometimes when these games get cancelled, something else comes out instead that makes it kind of worth the wait.

38
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,300
They should have the Project Hammer guy in Super Smash Brothers. That'd be hilarious.

39
00:01:53,300 --> 00:02:00,300
Didn't they say at game developers conferences this year that Peekman was the result of something else?

40
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,300
It was the result of Mario's...

41
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,300
Yeah, it was a Mario concept ended up being the Peekman game.

42
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,300
So you never know what might happen.

43
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,300
Frisbee asked a good question in chat.

44
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,300
Whatever happened to that game's sadness?

45
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,300
It's still being worked on.

46
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,300
Is it?

47
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,300
As far as I'm aware.

48
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,300
Alright, we'll see.

49
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,300
Now this is pretty cool. Some new information about the Wii.

50
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,300
And I know this will make Dark Sakura all kinds of excited.

51
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:29,300
It has been announced that TurboGrafx-16 CD games are on their way to Wii Virtual Console.

52
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,300
And I believe some of the earlier titles were announced.

53
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,300
I have not seen... I don't remember what was on the early list.

54
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,300
Sadly, the Dracula game you love, Jamie, wasn't on there.

55
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,300
I do remember.

56
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,300
I want to say Ys I and II was on it though.

57
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,300
Yeah, Ys I and II was on there.

58
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,300
That's great. I actually have that game, but it's still awesome.

59
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,300
But I'm curious how it now and what we're all wondering about...

60
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,300
I want the Volus games.

61
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,300
Well, how the hell are they going to fit all this on the Virtual Console?

62
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,300
Because the Wii only has so much internal memory.

63
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,300
Okay, first of all, the biggest things about the TurboGrafx-16 CD games

64
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,300
were that most of the audio on the Microsoft is all Redbook audio.

65
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,300
So all you'd have to do is compress it.

66
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,300
Or maybe they've removed the audio from the games.

67
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,300
Do you think that maybe they've done that?

68
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,300
No, I think it's compressed.

69
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:15,300
Just put it down to MP3. It'd probably be really small or Ogg Vorbis or whatever they want to use.

70
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,300
Oh, we'll see.

71
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,300
But I imagine you won't be able to fit that many of those on the game.

72
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,300
Or they're going to start selling these memory cards or something,

73
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,300
Virtual Console memory cards, or I don't know.

74
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,300
Obviously, any memory card will work, but you guys know what I mean.

75
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,300
They might start pushing people to get more memory cards.

76
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,300
The games themselves, though, didn't take up a whole lot of space.

77
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,300
I mean, they're just really the equivalent of...

78
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,300
I think one of the biggest ones that I personally have is Sapphire,

79
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,300
which has some rendered graphics in it.

80
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,300
No, actually, it has some true polygons in it.

81
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,300
And some of the CD arcade games,

82
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:59,300
but if we're just getting out East and all the other sprite-based ones,

83
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,300
that wouldn't take any space at all.

84
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,300
And the games are only going to be 800 points.

85
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,300
That's a pretty good deal.

86
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,300
Yeah, that's a really good deal.

87
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,300
I don't think it's going to be a major thing at all.

88
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:14,300
Especially if they're doing the Bomberman CD that came as a pack-in with the duo.

89
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,300
Or...

90
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,300
Rondo of Blood, maybe?

91
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,300
Rondo of Blood could actually easily be done.

92
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,300
If we're getting Super Nintendo cartridges on there,

93
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,300
it is not going to be hard at all for them to do Rondo of Blood.

94
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,300
How much of a fangasm will you have if Rondo of Blood comes out on Virtual Console?

95
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,300
I'd be like, thank God, I don't have to put my disc in the machine anymore.

96
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,300
My actual Rondo of Blood CD is still in perfect condition,

97
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,300
but I twitch every time.

98
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,300
I can't move the machine while I'm playing it because the disc costs $300.

99
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,300
It was saying that they were talking about,

100
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,300
it's going to be 10 games in 2007, 5 more slated for 2008.

101
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,300
Game downloads will be 800 points.

102
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,300
And I guess they are saying Rondo of Blood and Snatcher are true possibilities.

103
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,300
Huh. We'll see.

104
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,300
That'd be awesome.

105
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,300
That'd be really cool.

106
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,300
Well, speaking of our Virtual Console, let me go ahead and cover our UK Virtual Console.

107
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,300
For 600 points, we have Super Mario Bros. The Lost Levels,

108
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,300
which is a Famicom disc game,

109
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,300
and actually, according to this, it isn't the touched-up one

110
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,300
that was on the Super Mario All-Stars Super Nintendo cartridge.

111
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,300
Instead, this is the actual Super Mario Bros. 2 that came out in Japan,

112
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,300
which is freaking hard.

113
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,300
That's rad, though, that they actually released that on Virtual Console,

114
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,300
because we have never in this country seen the original Lost Levels,

115
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,300
except on ROMs, but if I seem to recall right, wasn't that a disc game?

116
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,300
That's what I said. It was a Famicom disc game.

117
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,300
Wow.

118
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,300
And so the price for it is going to be 600 points,

119
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,300
but I think that that's actually fair,

120
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,300
because it is basically a game that,

121
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,300
at least unless you owned a disc system,

122
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,300
you have never seen either remade or, you know,

123
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,300
it's the only unadulterated version of it that's going to be out.

124
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,300
Well, I mean, they have the one that was all touched up,

125
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,300
like they have the Super Nintendo, but that was different.

126
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,300
Yeah, but this is the actual one.

127
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,300
That's going to be pretty good.

128
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,300
And it's not Doki Doki Panic.

129
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,300
But maybe Doki Doki Panic will come out

130
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,300
now that they're releasing Japanese games on the console.

131
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,300
Yes, that opens huge doors now.

132
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,300
Well, here's a little bit more.

133
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,300
We have Mario Super P-Cross coming out,

134
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,300
which is 900 Wii points.

135
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,300
And then we have Neutopia 2, which we were discussing.

136
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,300
Right, so the UK finally got Neutopia 2 then.

137
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,300
So it looks like for these missing games,

138
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,300
they're charging 100 more points, is basically how it boils down to,

139
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,300
these never-before-seen.

140
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,300
Well, for anyone who doesn't know,

141
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,300
Neutopia 2 is going to be at 600 points.

142
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,300
Well, but that's one they've seen before.

143
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,300
So I'm curious, when does the US get this?

144
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,300
Because we've got to get it soon.

145
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,300
I don't know, but it's all part of this brand new,

146
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,300
I guess it's a thing that they're doing right now,

147
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,300
the Hanabi Festival in Europe and Australia.

148
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,300
And I guess this is week one is Mario Week.

149
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,300
Next week, they're going to be having Ninja Week.

150
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:24,300
And that's going to include Ninja Gaiden and Ninja Jaja Maru-kun.

151
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,300
And then I guess the third week is going to be Sci-Fi Week,

152
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,300
and that's going to have Sin and Punishment and Gradius 3.

153
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,300
That's a good game.

154
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,300
Actually, of the Gradius games, which one's your favorite?

155
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,300
Well, I've got to go to Salamander.

156
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,300
So I'm cheating.

157
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,300
I'm going to say Salamander.

158
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,300
I'm going to say Gradius 2 with the sun.

159
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,300
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

160
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,300
Yeah, with Burning Heat, the Burning Heat stage.

161
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,300
Well, I actually have that one on TurboGrafx.

162
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,300
Yeah, you know, I don't know.

163
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,300
But I do have the Gradius collection on PSP,

164
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,300
so I have a lot of those games.

165
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,300
But I miss Salamander or Life Force.

166
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,300
But I think Salamander was a slight bit cooler,

167
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,300
because they had better graphics in their case.

168
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,300
I'm really hoping, now this is completely off topic here,

169
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,300
and I did Life Force or Salamander.

170
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,300
I was going to say, it'd be really awesome if they did.

171
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,300
They really need to do this in the U.S. as well.

172
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:22,300
And I think they also need to do the Nintendo World Championships cart

173
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,300
and have that with an online leaderboard with score,

174
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,300
so you can post it on there if anyone remembers that.

175
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,300
The World Championship cart?

176
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,300
Yeah.

177
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,300
I'm kind of curious.

178
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,300
I'm going to ask the chat room what kinds of import games

179
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,300
that we've been missing in the U.S. or the U.K. for a long time.

180
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,300
Would you like to see come to Virtual Console?

181
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,300
I'm sure somebody's going to say Doki Doki Panic,

182
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,300
although in some extent we kind of...

183
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,300
I'll take the first five ones on Pirate Message. How's that?

184
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,300
We already have Doki Doki Panic.

185
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,300
You want to take some private messages?

186
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,300
Yeah. Send me the first five private messages.

187
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,300
Tell me what import game you'd like to see come out.

188
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,300
All right. Then we'll read those in a little bit.

189
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,300
Yeah.

190
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,300
Send Dark Sakura, private message in our chat.

191
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,300
But it has to be in our regular chat room,

192
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,300
chat.orangelandrater.com.

193
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,300
And not 2DX.

194
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,300
Okay. Remember, if you're watching us on Operator 11,

195
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,300
we're not looking at the chat room over there,

196
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,300
because our computer that streams Op 11

197
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,300
is all the way on the other side of the room.

198
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,300
So, wow. Virtual Console.

199
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,300
So, there's other neat stuff, I guess.

200
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,300
Oblivion's Gamebryo engine has been ported to the Wii now.

201
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,300
So, now that doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to see Oblivion on the Wii,

202
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,300
but it means maybe we'll see some better games coming to the Wii as well.

203
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,300
And, of course, the Gamebryo engine's been used from everything,

204
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,300
including Freedom 4, Civ 4, Dark Age of Camelot,

205
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,300
and, oh, I mean, that's pretty cool.

206
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,300
Maybe we'll see an actual cool role-playing game or something,

207
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,300
maybe something scaled down.

208
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,300
Hey, they could do Oblivion,

209
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,300
or the PSP version that was supposed to be coming out a while ago.

210
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,300
The hell ever happened to the Wii, or the PSP version?

211
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,300
I don't think it's coming. I think it got cancelled.

212
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,300
Really?

213
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,300
But, hey, who says they can't port that over to maybe the Wii or something,

214
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,300
where they have a little bit more disk space to work with,

215
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,300
and, I don't know, real-time sword controls, maybe?

216
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,300
I don't know. Just speculation here.

217
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,300
Huh. Interesting.

218
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,300
Well, certainly if these guys want to use this Oblivion engine

219
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,300
to make new games for the Wii,

220
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,300
it's not like there's a shortage of Wiis out there.

221
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,300
I mean, certainly these things are still selling pretty well.

222
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,300
I'm sure we've had plenty of sales stories on the Wii in previous shows.

223
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,300
And, of course, this all leads up to Christmas.

224
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,300
You might remember last Christmas, finding a Wii was tough.

225
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,300
I mean, it was the Cabbage Patch Kids, or the Furbies, of last year.

226
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,300
So, yeah, and actually, rare fact, or rare dumb little tidbit,

227
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,300
I actually own a Furby that I got that Christmas,

228
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,300
because I'm a consumer whore.

229
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,300
There was only one cool Furby, Rob.

230
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,300
What's that?

231
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,300
The Gizmo one.

232
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,300
For gremlins.

233
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,300
All right, but anyway, back to the Nintendo Wii.

234
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,300
So, folks in the media are starting to ask Reggie Fils-Aime,

235
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,300
the man over at Nintendo,

236
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,300
what's up?

237
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,300
Are you guys going to have enough supply this Christmas season?

238
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,300
Well, Reggie Fils-Aime says,

239
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,300
quote, Wii hardware that will be in North American stores will be unprecedented,

240
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,300
substantially more than the launch,

241
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,300
substantially more than has been seen to date.

242
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,300
And that was a quote that Reggie Fils-Aime said to the San Jose Mercury News.

243
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,300
So, of course, if you really want one of these, though,

244
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,300
Reggie Fils-Aime still says you should regularly check to see if the system is available.

245
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,300
So even though they're saying they're going to flow through the streets with Wii supplies,

246
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,300
you probably still want to call the store and check,

247
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,300
because they might still be selling out.

248
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,300
I'll believe it when I see it.

249
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,300
That's what I'm saying.

250
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,300
I'll believe that shit when I see it.

251
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,300
Really?

252
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,300
I don't believe.

253
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,300
I mean, obviously, I haven't tried to purchase a Wii in a long time.

254
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,300
How is it out there?

255
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,300
I mean, are they still pretty hard to find?

256
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,300
It's been getting worse.

257
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,300
Really?

258
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,300
Yeah.

259
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,300
Promises, promises, and then no fucking delivery.

260
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,300
That's what it's been.

261
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,300
Sad face.

262
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,300
I just hope they have some games to move those systems this year,

263
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,300
but I guess we get in Smash Brothers Brawl, Mario Galaxy.

264
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,300
Those will be two AAA titles.

265
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,300
Don't get me wrong.

266
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,300
They have a pretty good first-party lineup for the rest of this year,

267
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,300
and even January, hopefully Mario Kart soon.

268
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,300
True.

269
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,300
But it's all about systems.

270
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,300
You really need the systems,

271
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,300
and I really hope that he's not blowing smoke up my ass.

272
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:20,300
Let's hope not, because I don't like smoke in my ass, much like meat.

273
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
Anyways.

274
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,300
Well, we got our responses in.

275
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,300
Okay.

276
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,300
Let's hear them.

277
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,300
Mario Kristoff says, Kuru Kuru Kuru Rin.

278
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,300
I don't even know that game.

279
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,300
It's a Game Boy Advance game.

280
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,300
Oh, and you can't have Game Boy.

281
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,300
I know.

282
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,300
They don't do Game Boy games on Virtual Console.

283
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,300
Cheater.

284
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,300
It'd be good if they could.

285
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,300
A damn dirty cheater?

286
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,300
No, I'm just kidding.

287
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,300
Foodie Monster says, Gauss Panic.

288
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,300
Oh, yes.

289
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,300
That would rock.

290
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,300
Yes, winner.

291
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,300
GS68 says, Gradius II, NES version.

292
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,300
Don't we already have it?

293
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,300
No, we don't.

294
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,300
In Japan, they got it.

295
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,300
Yes.

296
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,300
Hit Sense says Pulseman for the Mega Drive.

297
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,300
Wow.

298
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,300
Well, you know what I would pick for Mega Drive?

299
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,300
It'd freaking be Panorama Cotton.

300
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,300
Oh, hell yeah.

301
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,300
Good luck.

302
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,300
Well, you know I have Rainbow Cotton.

303
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,300
I know.

304
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,300
This somehow comes up, because I seem to remember I asked.

305
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,300
I made the mistake of asking in the early days of OLR.

306
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,300
Because Jamie has a very scary collection of video games at her house.

307
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,300
What are you missing?

308
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,300
What's the one thing you want that you're missing?

309
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,300
And Jamie always goes, freaking Panorama Cotton.

310
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,300
Okay, Panorama Cotton.

311
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,300
Sega made 600 copies of it.

312
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,300
I know somebody who owns one.

313
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,300
And I got to touch it.

314
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,300
And it was a special day in my life.

315
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,300
Did you touch it with your fingers?

316
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,300
Did you rub it on your arm or your boots?

317
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,300
I have actually played a legit Panorama Cotton before.

318
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,300
Did you?

319
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,300
It was really, really nice.

320
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,300
Can I touch your hand?

321
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,300
Oh, I've touched the hand that touched a Panorama Cotton.

322
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,300
I'll hook you up with playing Panorama Cotton.

323
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,300
All right, all right.

324
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:57,300
RalstonUT suggests Terranigma and Dragon Quest 5 and 6.

325
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,300
Okay.

326
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,300
Well, that might be cool.

327
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,300
I mean, but obviously they might have to translate it.

328
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,300
And I don't think these other ones were translated, so.

329
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,300
Frisbee mentioned the Japanese Mario Brothers 2,

330
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,300
not the alternate version,

331
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,300
but that was the one they're getting in the UK on Virtual Console.

332
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,300
So it's only really a matter of time.

333
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,300
Cool.

334
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,300
And Darktatsuya says, Crisis Force.

335
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,300
Wow.

336
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,300
So what would you pick, Rob?

337
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:24,300
How about the version of Excitebike where you could actually save and load?

338
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,300
That would be the disc version.

339
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,300
Why didn't they do that for the fucking Virtual Console version?

340
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,300
That's a really good question.

341
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,300
I don't know.

342
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,300
Okay, you know what I want?

343
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,300
Here's what I want.

344
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,300
You want to talk about like fucking obscure only available in Japan only?

345
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,300
I want the Zelda 1 remake that was on the Nintendo Channel thing,

346
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,300
the whatever it was called.

347
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,300
The MBS Satellaview.

348
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,300
That's it.

349
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,300
The Satellaview.

350
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,300
Satellaview.

351
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,300
What was the slower you made about it?

352
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,300
Just different graphics?

353
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,300
It was Super Nintendo graphics and I think it had shorter levels.

354
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,300
Yeah.

355
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:58,300
The Satellaview was a pay service where you had a timer for how long you could play,

356
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,300
but there are hacked ROMs out there now that you can play it without a timer.

357
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,300
Are there really?

358
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,300
Yeah, Dan played through it.

359
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,300
Oh.

360
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,300
Played through it.

361
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,300
I didn't know that there were ROMs in there.

362
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,300
Do you know one of the ones, though, that Melody has?

363
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,300
Hmm.

364
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,300
She has the contest version of Star Fox.

365
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,300
Oh, that's rad.

366
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,300
From the big competition.

367
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,300
That would be rad.

368
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:22,300
That would be so cool on the Wii if they would bring back that old World Championship.

369
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,300
Remember the Nintendo World Championships?

370
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,300
Like I said about five minutes ago.

371
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,300
Sorry.

372
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,300
The online leaderboards.

373
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,300
That's exactly what I said five minutes ago.

374
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,300
Were you not paying attention?

375
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,300
I guess not.

376
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,300
God.

377
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,300
I was thinking about Panorama Cotton.

378
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,300
Maybe they'd eventually finish Robotech Crystal Dreams.

379
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,300
All right.

380
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,300
But yeah.

381
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,300
Well, what import game did you want?

382
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,980
I have one to piss off the fans, and I don't really care to see this over here, because

383
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,500
I don't get the point of it, but Mother 3.

384
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,500
There you go.

385
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,900
You ain't getting it ever.

386
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,300
Actually, you can get the UK one and play it translated.

387
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,700
But I had a story, too.

388
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,300
We have a wireless classic controller for the GameCube.

389
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,300
Okay.

390
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:12,300
Oh, no, it's for the Wii, but it's by Thrustmaster, which has the best name ever.

391
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,300
Thrustmaster.

392
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,300
Is that the name of the controller?

393
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,300
Thrustmaster?

394
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,300
No, the company that's putting it out is Thrustmaster.

395
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,300
That sounds like something Suzanne Somers would be selling with the Thighmaster, Thrustmaster.

396
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,300
That sounds like a bad porn.

397
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:29,300
Instead of Beastmaster, you have Thrustmaster, Beastialitymaster, or something.

398
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,300
I don't know.

399
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,300
Thrustmaster just sounds like bad porn.

400
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,300
Okay.

401
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,300
Good times.

402
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,300
Anyways.

403
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:44,300
So, here's another thing I don't understand about that wireless virtual console controller.

404
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:49,300
Why they don't have it where that it can be also a GameCube controller, as well.

405
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,300
Why don't they release something like that for the Wii, so that you can use one controller

406
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,300
for virtual console and for GameCube games?

407
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,300
That's what you need to do.

408
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,300
Make it happen, people.

409
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:07,300
Anyways, one thing that certain parents don't want to happen, much like me, is the Wii Zapper.

410
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:12,300
Which is the most retarded thing on the face of the earth, I swear to God.

411
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,300
Why the hate?

412
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,300
Why the hate?

413
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,300
It's stupid.

414
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,300
It's a piece of plastic.

415
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,300
You don't need it.

416
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,300
And it does not enhance your games, and I will prove it to you when it comes out.

417
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,300
That's right.

418
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,300
You might owe me a date.

419
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,300
I will not owe you a date at all.

420
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,300
What was I supposed to give you if you win?

421
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,300
I don't remember.

422
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,300
You were supposed to...

423
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,300
Oh, I have to take Nelly off your hands for a night.

424
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,300
Yeah.

425
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,300
That's what it was.

426
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:38,700
Anywho, so it has been announced officially that it is going to come out in November on

427
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:46,500
the 19th, I believe, and it's going to feature, hooray, Zelda's crossbow training, which is

428
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:56,160
going to be, I guess, exactly like the crossbow training that was in Twilight Princess, hooray.

429
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,580
So yeah, all for 20 bucks.

430
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:03,780
But there's some Jersey parents, though, that are kind of a little pissed off, describing

431
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:11,900
it as a gun-like remote, a wand in the shape of a weapon, and they don't want to happen.

432
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,900
Great.

433
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,900
This is what we need.

434
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,740
Children with guns learning how to aim and shoot.

435
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,380
Then we can sit back and wonder what is happening to our country with kids killing kids.

436
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,460
What's next?

437
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,220
First off, that doesn't look like a gun.

438
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,380
I don't know what kind of guns are out there in the market, but I'm pretty sure none of

439
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,660
them look like the Wii Zapper.

440
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:38,220
Second of all, there have been gun attachments for games for a long-ass time now.

441
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,140
And third, you don't have to buy it for your fucking kids, you moron.

442
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,940
Not that you can't play the no-shooter games without the attachment.

443
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:52,020
Here's my problem with this, is that these parental groups are about 20 years late.

444
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,420
Because remember the NES Zapper?

445
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,420
Hello?

446
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,100
That looked like a freaking gun.

447
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:03,500
I mean, not like a handgun, but that looked way more like a gun.

448
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
What was the one on Sega?

449
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,740
That was the Master System gun was based off the Zillion gun.

450
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,140
Okay, that thing looked like a real gun.

451
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,940
And hello, the Super Scope?

452
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,940
The Enforcer?

453
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,220
The Super Scope was a freaking bazooka that you put on your shoulder.

454
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,660
You remember the lethal enforcers guns that looked like six shooters?

455
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:25,380
Even though they were red and pink and blue, they were still in full-on gun shape.

456
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,660
I love the Super Scope.

457
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,340
Why the fuck didn't the Super Scope do better?

458
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,460
It's because there were no good freaking games for it.

459
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,140
But I mean, it was a goddamn bazooka that you got to play with.

460
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,140
I love my Super Scope.

461
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,140
That's how you win at the competition.

462
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,140
Oh, we have a gun.

463
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,140
Well, we have a fucking bazooka.

464
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,140
Top that shit.

465
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,300
Nintendo's like, look, we'll whip it out, ours is bigger.

466
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,300
And then Sega's like, well, we have a half bazooka.

467
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,740
They call it the Menacer.

468
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,580
So yeah, we also had the Activator and we know how well that went.

469
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:57,740
So now parents are all getting pissed off at this Wii Zapper thing, which looks nothing

470
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,740
like a gun.

471
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,620
I mean, seriously, I mean, it looks kind of like it's like a gun shaped cookie cutter

472
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,620
or something.

473
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,620
I don't know how to explain it.

474
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,580
If it was a gun, it would be a Tron prop.

475
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,660
It's as much of a gun as a banana is a gun, okay?

476
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,900
That's seriously the Wii Zapper.

477
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,940
Ooh, I like this comment from Rama in chat, chat.orangelsready.com.

478
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:21,100
Rama says this, it simply amuses me that about 20 years ago when Nintendo first introduced

479
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,900
the Zapper, the same soccer moms and dads that are protesting against it were playing

480
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,140
these light gun games on the original NES.

481
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,940
If that's not the biggest form of hypocrisy, I don't know what is, but hey, that's just

482
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,940
me.

483
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,980
Here's something, it's all these fucking parental guidance groups, they fucking see

484
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,300
a little headline or get like tipped off on something and then they go ballistic about

485
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,980
it without actually using no said item or even knowing anything about it.

486
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,380
I mean, they're pissed off at Bully when they knew, oh my God, it's a game with bullies

487
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,380
in it.

488
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,020
Oh, hate, hate, hate.

489
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,180
And then, you know, they didn't know what the hell the game was and it was like kind

490
00:20:54,180 --> 00:21:01,300
of promoting against bullying people and it's just, all you have to know is you don't need

491
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,340
to listen to these people and nothing they ever do ever works anyway.

492
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,220
Has their banning of, you know, games worked?

493
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,220
No.

494
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,380
Has, you know, it hurt anybody's sales?

495
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,380
No.

496
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,380
Is it given...

497
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,380
Has it helped sales?

498
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,380
Has it given more publicity and stuff?

499
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,380
Yes, it has.

500
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,740
So, they are actually helping the sale of this stuff, you morons.

501
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,620
Escapist has a good question in chat, too.

502
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,300
Why aren't they protesting Big Buck Hunter, those deer hunting games in the front of every

503
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,300
wall?

504
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,500
Or how about why aren't they protesting Time Crisis 4, which looks more like a gun than

505
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,500
this thing?

506
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,180
Oh, but it's because the Wii, the Wii is a system for kids.

507
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,060
No it's not, you morons, seriously.

508
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,740
Thank God these crazies are in the minority, at least I hope so.

509
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,180
Those of you listening might notice that the rant levels seem to have gone through the

510
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,980
roof on this story, and y'all know what that means.

511
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:57,220
It's time for the FUs of the Week.

512
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:01,060
Dark Sakura.

513
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,380
My FU of the Week has to go...

514
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,360
I wouldn't really say so much towards Play N' See, but has to go toward my copy of Guild

515
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,360
Wars.

516
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,400
Because I've been playing on the demo for a little while and I finally decided to open

517
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,460
my box and install it on my PC, since I don't have World of War... not on my PC, but on

518
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,420
my laptop, since I don't have World of Warcraft installed on here.

519
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,700
And until I have my PC rebuilt, I'm just gonna stop paying for my World of Warcraft account.

520
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,460
So I was like, Guild Wars is free, I already have a character, I have a free box.

521
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:33,220
So I go to peel off the sticker so I can scratch off my ID, my access key, and the access key

522
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,220
peels off with it.

523
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,220
Oh no.

524
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,780
A lot of it did.

525
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,380
And I was like, well shit.

526
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,900
So Heather, bless her, she helped me, she got me my ID from my birthday.

527
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,500
I know, and I'm finally installing it.

528
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,900
And I've gone through all of that time, upgrading my Guild Wars and everything and downloading

529
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:56,860
all the patches, which has so much better of a patch function than World of Warcraft

530
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,380
could ever imagine having.

531
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:05,060
It downloads them all at once, instead of download me, download me, download me, but

532
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,020
anyway that's another story.

533
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:14,260
So I do have to say though that to play MC's credit, they are very fast in the response.

534
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:20,820
I sent in my request, I'd have to say around 7 o'clock on Thursday, I had a response within

535
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,820
an hour.

536
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,820
I had a second response 30 minutes after that.

537
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,700
Friday I got two more responses telling me that they were forwarding it to a different

538
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,700
party.

539
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,740
They were keeping me informed at every step of the way, and that's really good customer

540
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,740
service.

541
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:39,380
So, at the end of the disc, but a thank you goes to play MC, except for being closed on

542
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,380
the weekend.

543
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,380
The end.

544
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,380
Alright.

545
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,580
Anyways, uh, fuck you to Stars in Vacaville.

546
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:54,380
My god is that a whole bunch of ghetto wrapped into one ugly ass building, and, you know,

547
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:58,700
Qsar has really gone downhill there, as well as everything else there, their employees

548
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,700
don't give a shit, and I don't give a shit either, and I will not be coming back.

549
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:12,380
And that's saying a lot because the next Qsar is fucking 45 minutes away from that, so.

550
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,380
My turn?

551
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,380
Yeah.

552
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,540
Um, I'll have to give an FU to the waffle place I ate breakfast at today.

553
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:22,180
Now don't get me wrong, waffles are awesome, like waffles are God's food, okay?

554
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,180
Waffles are like the best thing ever.

555
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:26,180
I mean, can anybody think of a better food than waffles?

556
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,180
No?

557
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,180
Didn't think so.

558
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,180
Two waffles!

559
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,180
Yes, two waffles!

560
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,180
Cornmeal pancakes.

561
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,980
Here's the thing though.

562
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:37,400
I did have a pretty odd, well here's the reason why I give the place an FU is because they

563
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,380
didn't have a peanut butter waffle on their menu.

564
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:46,300
Like the competing waffle shop across town has a peanut butter waffle that I'm very used

565
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,620
to and I love that, and they don't have any type of peanut butter related waffle on menus.

566
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,620
That's why they get an FU.

567
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,460
However, they do redeem themselves, you know why?

568
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,940
Because they do have a waffle that has bacon inside it.

569
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,180
It's a bacon waffle.

570
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,540
So the only thing better than a waffle, a bacon waffle?

571
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:07,900
No, I beg to differ, that's really gross because it makes me look greasy.

572
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,620
That sounds awesome.

573
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,700
It was awesome, Loki, I can't even describe.

574
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,700
So there you go.

575
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,700
Hey, guess what I get to do in a month.

576
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,700
What?

577
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,700
I get to go eat at a waffle house.

578
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,700
Well, actually two months.

579
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,600
Like a legitimate, you know I've never eaten at an actual waffle house, but I'm worried

580
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,300
that if I do, it will ruin my impression of waffle.

581
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,300
Waffles everywhere.

582
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:32,140
Well, the thing about Waffle House, and all of our East Coast and Southern listeners will

583
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,340
know this, is that Waffle House isn't just about the waffles, which really aren't that

584
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,580
fantastic.

585
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:43,320
It's just about being at a fucking waffle house, and they have the best coffee ever,

586
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,980
and the best hash browns ever, because you can get them smothered, covered, chunked,

587
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:53,300
cheese, everything on it, and I was like, ah, sexy, but I went to Waffle House and I

588
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:57,500
came back with a hat, and they wouldn't sell me a cup, because I wanted a big coffee mug

589
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,020
that said Waffle House on it.

590
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,340
And just to let people know, I'm going to Alabama in November.

591
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:09,300
I will be doing my usual cyber station in Mobile, Alabama run, because I used to work

592
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:14,380
at that freaking arcade, and I hate it, but I will be there.

593
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,420
So are you going to go, do they have an ultracade machine there?

594
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,420
I don't remember.

595
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,900
They had a busted up DDR last time I was there, but that was the first place I played Tekken

596
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,900
5.

597
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,260
So will you, if they have an ultracade machine, will you be doing your ceremonial trip to

598
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,700
the arcade to kick the ultracade machine?

599
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,740
Yes, I will be kicking an ultracade.

600
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,740
I will also be...

601
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,860
What if they don't have an ultracade, what will you kick?

602
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:37,980
I will be kicking the smoking token, because it used to fucking break all the time, and

603
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:44,220
that bump and jump game, I hate that one too, but the thing about me going to cyber station

604
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,500
is that any new Namco arcade game that comes out, all the Namco arcades get it first, so

605
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,140
that's why I was in such a big tizzy to get to that one when I went a few years ago, so

606
00:26:54,140 --> 00:27:01,220
I could go play Tekken 5, because they got it a couple of months before golf landed.

607
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:07,840
But I will not be going to New Orleans, sorry, that's too much of a drive, I may be in Biloxi.

608
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,900
I will be in Dothan, Alabama, and I will probably stop at the tilt for about five minutes and

609
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,860
leave, because that arcade...

610
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,140
To also kick a machine of your choosing.

611
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,100
If the tilt is closed, I don't know if it's still at the mall.

612
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,060
Hopefully a listener will know and can email us, but I was going to say, someday when we're

613
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:28,260
rock stars, that should be how we go out on tour to promote things, is we should set up

614
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,340
a time in an arcade for everybody to meet us there, and everybody can gather around

615
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,740
a machine, and then we all walk in and kick it and leave.

616
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:42,860
I did go to a DDR tourney, and this is when we already had Max, but their newest DDR machine

617
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:46,260
that they had at this arcade in...

618
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:51,140
I want to say it was at the Beaux-Rivage, this is of course before Katrina hit, was

619
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:55,060
a fifth mix, and I went to meet up with people there.

620
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,060
This is a few years ago.

621
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:02,500
Made some cool friends too, but just also to let people know while I'm thinking about

622
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,340
it, there's not going to be any more pump up the volume until I get my computer replaced.

623
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:12,100
My computer died a lot, so I'm done.

624
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,100
Ready to hear it.

625
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:21,380
Well, we got through our FUs of the Week, minorly unscathed.

626
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,140
Are there any other traveling anybody's doing this year that should be noted?

627
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,140
I don't know.

628
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,300
I know where I'm not going.

629
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,300
Where are you not going?

630
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,460
I'm not going to E for All.

631
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,460
Why is that?

632
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,460
I still kind of want to go for E for All.

633
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,340
I have the week off work, but why is it that you don't want to go?

634
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,300
Because, it's like everybody's canceled, and it's also in LA, and also the wife probably

635
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,300
wouldn't let me anyways.

636
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,020
The wife's not going to permit you to go?

637
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,340
Well, you know, it's a long ways away.

638
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,900
If it were in San Francisco or something like that, that would be a little different.

639
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:56,420
But eight hours away for something that's progressively getting worse?

640
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,420
I don't know.

641
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,420
Not for me.

642
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,420
We'll see.

643
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:05,460
I kind of want to go to network and see who I can meet and what have you, but we'll see.

644
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,700
Anyhow, there is a brand new version of Winamp coming out.

645
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,220
A lot of you guys left Winamp behind when you switched to iTunes to run with your iPod.

646
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,220
No, I don't touch that iTunes shit.

647
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,700
I've flipped off iTunes.

648
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,340
In the internet, a lot of folks did.

649
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:23,580
Now, we use Winamp to do this show and everything, but there is Winamp coming out.

650
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,900
A new version is coming out, and here's the cool thing about it, because they obviously

651
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,700
want people to go back to Winamp, folks that ditched them for iTunes.

652
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,700
Here's the thing.

653
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:39,540
A new version of Winamp will stream songs to your consoles, such as the Nintendo Wii.

654
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:43,300
So a new version of Winamp, it's the 10th anniversary edition, and it's going to stream

655
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,300
to your consoles.

656
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,820
Pretty rad.

657
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:50,580
I'm not sure exactly how it works yet, but I'm sure we will see more when the release

658
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,900
of this comes out, which I'm not sure exactly when it's supposed to.

659
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,540
I haven't seen a date on it, but I imagine it's later this year.

660
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,540
That's pretty cool.

661
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:02,660
And I was going to remind the chat room, because it's been a while since we talked about the

662
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,900
whole UltraCade thing.

663
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:08,460
The reason why you're supposed to kick an UltraCade machine is because at one time,

664
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:13,460
well, other than the fact that it sucks, at one time the company that owns UltraCade tried

665
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:20,460
to register a trademark for, or copyright or something, for MAME, and that's why, even

666
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,740
though they didn't make any of that.

667
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,500
It was this big legal nightmare, but UltraCade sucks anyway.

668
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:36,060
So this is, I guess, new news there, but old news for us, really, because we've had DDR

669
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:42,060
in schools for a long time, is over in the UK, they're using Dancing Stage, which is

670
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:53,100
the version of Dance Dance Revolution over there, to combat childhood obesity.

671
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:59,940
There are trials that are done in Bedfordshire schools to see if people will play that, but

672
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:06,820
they're targeting it towards girls who don't want to play sports, especially competitive

673
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,820
sports.

674
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:12,100
So it's basically to help increase activities going on at school, and I think that's pretty

675
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,100
cool.

676
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,700
I mean, I played DDR for a long time, and it's activity.

677
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,260
Activity is activity.

678
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,260
Definitely.

679
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:27,300
Let's see here, I was going to say, there's a brand new, of course we played a little

680
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:33,900
bit, if you were listening to us live during the break, a brand new album coming out from

681
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:41,260
OC Remix, and it's Lifestream, a tribute album to Final Fantasy VII, or Voices of the Lifestream,

682
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,260
I should say.

683
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:50,700
It is four discs, huge, completely free, there's a 2.32 gigabyte torrent for it available,

684
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,660
and it's split up, I guess, into their four different universes, Crisis Core, Jurge of

685
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:03,140
Service, Advent Children in Last Order, and features a bunch of awesome music, 45 tracks

686
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:08,740
including, and features the work of 42 different remixers.

687
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,020
So freaking awesome.

688
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,020
Download it now.

689
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:15,380
Yeah, we'll actually play a couple clips here, just some real quick clips here on the show,

690
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,780
so you can hear what some of this, this is one we played during the break, this is a

691
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:23,860
Jenova remix, called Jenova Celestial by Blind.

692
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:41,980
I like that, it's all like techno-y and stuff, and there's a Chocobo remix called Que, Electric

693
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:57,620
De Chocobo, which is by an artist named Durangin, here's a little clip.

694
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:02,180
And one more clip we'll play for you guys, this is a song that's a compilation from Norg

695
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,180
and Snappleman.

696
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:23,980
They came together to do this one called Full Frontal Assault, pretty rad.

697
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:30,240
So it's free on their site, so pretty cool.

698
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,500
Maybe I'll play something on the Xbox 360 and use that as a custom soundtrack, that

699
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,500
might be kind of fun.

700
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,180
Play like Blue Dragon and use that as a custom soundtrack, who knows.

701
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,900
Anyhow, one game that you don't use custom soundtracks for though is Guitar Hero 3, and

702
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,820
certainly it seems like every week we're hearing about some new songs in the game.

703
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:51,220
Well get this, if a recent post on Score Hero that came up and then was taken down not even

704
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:56,420
two minutes later is to be believed, the full song list for Guitar Hero 3 has leaked.

705
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,640
The whole fact that it was up and then taken down right away certainly seems to make it

706
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:05,100
look like it was removed, and you'll have to forgive me because I don't remember exactly

707
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,660
what has been announced and what's not, but I do notice some interesting stuff here.

708
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:12,860
I remember that Tom Morello was announced as a boss, but Rage Against the Machine has

709
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:16,620
Bulls On Parade in there, remember that's a pretty awesome guitar song.

710
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,780
And let's see what else caught my eye here, Tenacious D's in there, but I think they were

711
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,780
announced for that before.

712
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,580
Guns N' Roses, Welcome to the Jungle, Aerosmith, same old song and dance, so Aerosmith might

713
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,620
actually be Guitar Hero 3, I know we heard a story last week that they were going to

714
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,140
be a big part of Guitar Hero 4.

715
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:35,300
I was going to write how Chili Peppers Suck My Kiss.

716
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:41,660
Yeah, I'm trying to think what else here, oh the Encore Stage, the very last song, you

717
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:47,780
know how before it was Freebird, now it's going to be The Devil Went Down to Georgia.

718
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,820
Nice.

719
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,820
So that'll be pretty rad.

720
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:54,900
And I guess, what was this one, it says Boss Lou Guitar Battle?

721
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,900
I don't know.

722
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,220
I don't know who Lou would be.

723
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,900
Let's see here, they were saying...

724
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,900
Lou Reed maybe?

725
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,900
I don't know.

726
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,020
Disturbed, stricken, that's kind of cool before I forget.

727
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,020
Where does it say Lou?

728
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,020
Oh I don't know.

729
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,620
Maybe it's an in-game character, who knows.

730
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,620
Maybe.

731
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,940
I don't know my Guitar Heroes apparently.

732
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,220
I'm trying to see if there's anything else.

733
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:19,060
But now again, this is a rumored list, so we don't know for sure.

734
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:22,260
I don't know, it looks pretty official to me.

735
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,620
Yeah, it looks pretty convincing.

736
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,620
We'll see.

737
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,620
I mean, the game's out, what?

738
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,620
Next month?

739
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,620
It's the end of next month, the 31st.

740
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,620
Halloween!

741
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,620
Halloween!

742
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:37,260
I think they'll actually know it, I take that back, the 28th is when it's coming out, Sunday.

743
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,660
Oh, they're doing a weekend release because they can.

744
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,940
Anyhow, we're going to do the Mailbag segment now, because we can.

745
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,060
That's what we want to do, and every week you guys send us emails, and Dark Sakura picks

746
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:52,580
a few of her favorites and reads them live, on air, and then makes fun of them as well,

747
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,620
when she feels like it.

748
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,460
The mailbag at orangesonsrated.com is the place to send those emails.

749
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,460
So open up the mailbag!

750
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,460
Dive in, Dark Sakura, what's in there?

751
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,620
Hello guys, what's up?

752
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:08,700
This is Foodie Monster from Argentina, and this is probably my first email to you guys.

753
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,100
Anyway, I won't make it long since I've been known to call into the show a few times, so

754
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,540
I'm not scared of the Skypline to make any long-winded rants.

755
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,780
The reason to this email is to send you guys a picture of the game drawn to life for the

756
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,780
DS.

757
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:24,660
I believe you guys don't know this game, which got released on September 11th, I believe,

758
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,660
so it's new.

759
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:29,500
It's a cutesy game, and would be well-defined as a weird hybrid between Zelda Adventure

760
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,500
Island, Mario, and Sonic.

761
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,540
Yes, I know it all seems to be all over the place.

762
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,860
Anyway, the point is that the gimmick of this game is that you basically draw everything,

763
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:42,980
and not just lines, no, I mean full-blown things, from clouds you step on, to the slug

764
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,640
you ride on on one of the levels, to the gun you wield, to the main character.

765
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,980
And that's what I wanted to show you guys, in the pictures that I've attached, I made

766
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:56,500
one of OLR's, and Jamie's favorite, a playable character, a cute Pyramid Head.

767
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,700
The pictures do speak for themselves, and it shows the way you can show the listeners

768
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,700
as well.

769
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,540
Maybe point the Operator 11 camera at the computer screen or something.

770
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,540
Too late, Op11 died.

771
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,900
But I thought it was pretty funny, especially when the town's mayor says, oh, Pyramid H,

772
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,900
go to rescue little Miwa.

773
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,860
The whole time I pictured a Pyramid Head ripping said little girl to shreds with a giant meat

774
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,860
cleaver, and that made me LOL.

775
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:20,300
Anyways, I'll wrap this up and let you guys continue through the mailbag.

776
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,300
Take care and keep up the great work as usual.

777
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,540
Oh, that's cute.

778
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,540
Here's the little Pyramid Head.

779
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:28,540
I'm looking, I peeked in the mailbag as well to pull out the pictures.

780
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,540
That is cute.

781
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:33,260
And this is great radio, but maybe Footy, I think it's Footy's in chat tonight, so maybe

782
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,260
he can share.

783
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,260
Oh yeah, he just posted his photo bucket there.

784
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,260
Thank you, Footy.

785
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,260
Thank you.

786
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,260
That was awesome radio.

787
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,260
By the way, pictures make for great radio.

788
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,260
That is the cutest thing ever.

789
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,260
Look at that.

790
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,260
Oh my God, he's adorable.

791
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,260
I want one.

792
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,260
I want my Pyramid Headie.

793
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:49,100
Pea Headie, Pea Headie, Pea Headie.

794
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,100
We call him Pea Headie.

795
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,100
I'm going to look at the other picture.

796
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,260
Oh my God, he's so cute.

797
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:00,540
Okay, so moving on.

798
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:09,580
So from Gray Fox, we have an email.

799
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:13,100
Hello LLR gang, I've been listening to your podcast for a couple of months now and would

800
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,420
like to say that I love your show.

801
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,660
I agree with many others who have commented that it is hilarious interactions between

802
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,100
all three of you that make this show unique.

803
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:25,020
I had about a four year hiatus of gaming because of being enrolled in university and did not

804
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,100
have much time for video games.

805
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,940
Now that I have graduated, I have more time to play, so I got myself a PS2 slimline and

806
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,940
I'm loving it so far.

807
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:38,340
I was wondering if it were possible to have a section on the show dedicated to great last

808
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,340
gen games.

809
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,220
I find there are many people who cannot afford to get involved in the next gen gaming and

810
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:48,880
there are still many great games, Metal Gear Solid Series, God of War, Viewtiful Joe, etc.

811
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,800
Right now I rely on IGN for my game recommendations, but I am afraid that some games might still

812
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,860
be great but get a lower score.

813
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,860
Any help would be great.

814
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,900
Keep up the good work.

815
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:07,660
I would suggest for good PS2 games, definitely the Metal Gear series.

816
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:13,260
I was always a big fan of the Tekken games because I love my fighting games a whole lot.

817
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,780
I'm a big Namco nerd.

818
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:20,500
Klonoa 2 was a really, really, really good PS2 game.

819
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,340
It got really hard toward the end, but it was a really good game.

820
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:27,740
It kind of makes you think, if you're going to pick up a platformer, I suggest Klonoa

821
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,740
2.

822
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,740
Guys?

823
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:33,900
I don't know, but Klonoa 2, I mean it's a good, it's okay a game I guess.

824
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:38,100
As far as the last gen game goes, I mean they're still making some good stuff for PlayStation

825
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,100
2.

826
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,260
Like Final Fantasy XII came out amongst all the new consoles and kind of got lost, but

827
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,260
it's a freaking great RPG.

828
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:49,820
And I know a lot of folks in chat have been yapping about Persona 3, which is also supposed

829
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,820
to be a really good one.

830
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,820
I still need to play the demo.

831
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,820
I've been busy.

832
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,820
Yeah, I know.

833
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,980
I want to play the full game at some point, but just, you know, there's so many games

834
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,580
out there to play right now.

835
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:02,900
So certainly PS2 still has a bunch of crack going out for it.

836
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,980
And you know, I still, I even want to go way back to some of the games that were released

837
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,980
earlier on.

838
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,860
I still want to catch up on the.hack series, because I actually enjoy the games, the little

839
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,860
bits I played of them.

840
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,380
There's just, you know, a lot to them.

841
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:17,280
So ironically enough, we talked about in part 8 tonight, Jamie's going to have a classic

842
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,980
game of the week segment, so maybe once in a while he can have a PS2 game or something

843
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,980
in there.

844
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,980
Oh, you know what?

845
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,980
Space Channel 5.

846
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,980
Ooh, good times.

847
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,300
They did a double release of 1 and 2.

848
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,300
Why not get that?

849
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,300
That's fun.

850
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,300
Parappa 2?

851
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,740
Yeah, Parappa 2 is really fun.

852
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,140
Mojib Ribbon, if you're into the import.

853
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,140
If you can get it.

854
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,140
NCSX still sells it.

855
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:43,260
You know, you've got your 2DX, your DDR.

856
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,180
There's tons of good stuff on PS2.

857
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,180
Rez.

858
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,180
Rez.

859
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,180
Oh yes, Rez.

860
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,180
Good job.

861
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,180
Amplitude.

862
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,180
Frequency.

863
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,180
Guitar Hero.

864
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:57,500
Yeah, those prequels to, or you could say to what ended up being Guitar Hero.

865
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,500
Yeah.

866
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,500
Cool.

867
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,500
Yes.

868
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,500
I am moving forward.

869
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,500
Prepare to fast-forward.

870
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:07,980
Hey, Rob, Jamie, and Matt, it's been a while since I've communicated with you guys, so

871
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,980
I've missed you all.

872
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:15,260
I'm still unpacking from my move to Brooklyn Studios, but the area I'm at, really awesome.

873
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,500
A few things I'd like to say if you don't mind.

874
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,220
Rob, I know you're not a big fan of anime, but I've heard you go on about how awesome

875
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,220
Blue Dragon is.

876
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,900
In case you haven't heard, there's an anime based on the game now.

877
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,900
Here's my question.

878
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,660
If there was a game that you liked also had an anime to it, would you watch it as well?

879
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,580
Oh, and Jamie, I've seen the first episode, and it's pretty good.

880
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,580
It's a must-see.

881
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,940
I'm gonna have to download that then.

882
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,980
I will say this, so far, sorry, I know the email's not done, but just to get that part

883
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:45,440
out of the way, I don't think Blue Dragon is like, OMG awesome, but Blue Dragon is better

884
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,980
than a lot of people say it is, I think.

885
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:51,580
It's just, you know, it's a Super Nintendo RPG with next-gen graphics.

886
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,580
That's what Blue Dragon is.

887
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,660
Take it or leave it.

888
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,660
Would I watch the anime?

889
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,660
Sure.

890
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,660
I've heard it's out there.

891
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,660
I think I've seen it on YouTube.

892
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,340
I just haven't sat down to watch it.

893
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:03,900
But I did watch an episode of Final Fantasy Unlimited just because I liked Final Fantasy,

894
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,900
so yeah, I've done it.

895
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,180
Final Fantasy Unlimited was a very strange series.

896
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:10,500
Yeah, it wasn't, yeah, I didn't watch the whole thing, but you know, it's, I will, if

897
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,500
I'm into it enough.

898
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,180
I still need to finish Death Note, okay?

899
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,980
Anyway, Rob, another question.

900
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,180
The New York chapter of the O.L. Army wants to know if you're going to digital life.

901
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:21,820
I know you said you were thinking about it because you have a credit with JetBlue, but

902
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,220
not much has been said.

903
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:26,540
Would love it if you came out to New York City again because we all love you.

904
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:30,180
I thought I'd clarified this on a previous show, but perhaps some folks were out or maybe

905
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:35,100
I said it on a off-recorded break or something, but unfortunately, due to a conflict, I cannot

906
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,300
make it out there for digital life.

907
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,100
I'm very sorry to the New York folks.

908
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,180
However, you're right, I still have that credit from JetBlue and I've got to use it before

909
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:45,020
June or it goes away, so you bet you're going to see me out there in the spring for something.

910
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,020
So we'll see.

911
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,020
Okay.

912
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,260
Well, let me move forward.

913
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:53,660
And by the way, this email is from our Ron Chan in the chat room who always makes me

914
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,660
squee.

915
00:42:55,660 --> 00:43:00,540
So moving forward, speaking of East Coast, no, we've already done that one.

916
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,540
Wait.

917
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,540
Have I done that?

918
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,540
No, I haven't.

919
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,140
Speaking of the East Coast, Rob, you've jokingly said that if we fly at O.L.R. out to a con,

920
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,140
you would all go.

921
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:11,020
I can't do that, but I can try to get you, Jamie, and Matt to scounce on flights if you

922
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:15,860
three can come to anime next to local con in Jersey.

923
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,860
He's offering us to stay.

924
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,260
Do you think we could make something like that?

925
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,540
Well, we'll consider.

926
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:25,440
We do have something, a resource we can tap into to maybe make that happen.

927
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,860
It would just be also, though, our personal calendars.

928
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:30,860
We also, don't forget, Oren's on Friday, we don't get paid for doing this.

929
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:31,940
This isn't our jobs.

930
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:37,540
So we all have jobs and Jamie goes to school, Loki's married, so sometimes our personal

931
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,580
lives keep us at home, not just so much the fact that we're poor.

932
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:44,420
But we do have a money resource we can tap into and we appreciate the offer.

933
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,300
Here's the thing, though.

934
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:50,300
If we're going to go to a con and make that kind of trip for it, I just don't want some

935
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:54,740
like Sunday morning when everybody's packing, because that kind of, you know what I went

936
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,740
through, Rama.

937
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,740
And although I had a good time at the con, don't get me wrong, I was a little disappointed,

938
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:02,540
you know, that when you get scheduled for such a crap time, when you make that kind

939
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:06,180
of trip out somewhere, you know, that it's unfortunate.

940
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:09,220
So I still love you, Rama, mwah, mwah, mwah.

941
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,220
Okay, where was I?

942
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:15,340
Also, more good news, I've decided not to get a wee now because my friends around me

943
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,220
have one, including my own roommate.

944
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,940
I've decided to get an Xbox 360 instead.

945
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:23,540
Despite the three year warranty Microsoft has given, I'm opting for the two year replacement

946
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:27,660
plan because I'd rather spend the extra cash to have it replaced the same day at my local

947
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,660
Best Buy.

948
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:34,940
I'm planning to purchase it February 08, when they should have the 65nm chips in it.

949
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:39,060
Now that you all know I'm buying one, I'm really fickle about buying games.

950
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:43,180
I'd like each of you to recommend one game I should get, but don't suggest Rumble Roses

951
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:48,260
XX, I'm already planning on buying that.

952
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,260
Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

953
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:53,020
Somebody's getting a text message.

954
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,260
That's probably sauce.

955
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:55,820
You can't text message Breakup.

956
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,620
That's probably sauce.

957
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,300
I'm sorry, what was the question?

958
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,300
Cheap Xbox 360 games?

959
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,220
Well, just an Xbox 360 game that you would suggest buying.

960
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:08,420
Well I know you like RPGs, Rama, so I would say Blue Dragon, or I think, has Enchanted

961
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,900
Arms gotten a price cut yet?

962
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,660
Because Enchanted Arms also wasn't bad.

963
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:16,340
Enchanted Arms is dirt cheap now, especially if you have a Playstation 3, it's really dirt

964
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,340
cheap.

965
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,340
Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

966
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,980
If you want to try an RPG, opt for Enchanted Arms, it's not as bad as people made it out

967
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,280
to be.

968
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,980
If you can get through the first couple hours, which are a little rough especially, you really

969
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:26,980
start to get into it.

970
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,740
I don't think it was a bad game.

971
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,020
Again, it wasn't a great game.

972
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:35,020
I'm still waiting for the freaking great blow your hair back RPG on the Xbox 360, which

973
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:38,700
I'm hoping is Eternal Sonata, but I shouldn't hold my breath.

974
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,900
Marvel Ultimate Alliance, that's all I have to say.

975
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:46,460
Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Uno, anyway.

976
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:49,660
Yeah, don't forget the arcade actually.

977
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:56,780
Make sure that you get Castlevania, that's also, it looks kind of, actually the Double

978
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:01,660
Dragon is so funny because it's all high res, and to me, it just doesn't look the same.

979
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,660
It's not as cool to me.

980
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:08,380
Okay, next part, oh Jamie, I had my house warming last night, I didn't get any Guinness,

981
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:14,300
I'm sorry, Tear, but we did have other alcoholic beverages and I did a 151 shot for you, which

982
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:18,340
reminds me of how much I loved hanging out with you at Final Mate, aww, I know I've said

983
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:21,460
this several times already, but you truly made me feel at home, I can't wait to come

984
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:24,180
back out there, not to calm, but to relax and have a good time.

985
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:30,540
Oh, that's so sweet, well definitely, you've got crashing space, definitely have crashing

986
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,540
space.

987
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:32,540
I'm sorry, what?

988
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,540
Who wants to come back out and hang out?

989
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,540
Oh.

990
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,540
That's cool.

991
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:36,540
Cool.

992
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,620
Okay, I'm almost done with the email.

993
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:43,620
Speaking of fun times, all of OLR me is on notice, I will be back for Final Mate 2009

994
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:48,740
Prior Commitments for 08, and it will be OLR Con, two suites full of OLR fans just going

995
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:49,740
insane.

996
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:56,300
Oh, and for the record, the fancy Articulate Guys comment from last week was made by my

997
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,260
friend Patty, not by me, and she rocks hard.

998
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,220
Do you remember you commented on that, Rob?

999
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:04,900
I remember there was the fancy- Articulate Guys.

1000
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:08,740
Alright, whatever, yeah, I'm just starting to get warm, I'm going to have to open the

1001
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:09,740
door pretty soon.

1002
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:14,820
I believe that's it for now, I had more topics to comment on, but I forgot what I was going

1003
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:19,260
to say about them, but keep up the good work, and don't stop believing, wink face.

1004
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:22,300
DJ Rama asked, proud member of the OLR me since 2003.

1005
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,740
That was a long email.

1006
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:25,740
Last email.

1007
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,740
Alright.

1008
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:30,900
Hey, OLR Nintendo Maniac 64 here, for math class, I'm doing a survey-like thing, it's

1009
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:35,620
very simple, I need you to list your preference of which of the following gaming systems from

1010
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,620
one best to four worst.

1011
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:44,860
The Wii, the 360, Playstation 3, and PC emulators and ROMs do not count.

1012
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:48,740
And then, oh, he just wants to send an e, oh, never mind, he's wanting us to do his

1013
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,740
poll.

1014
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,220
Well, I'm curious, what of the four do you think is best?

1015
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:57,380
Oh, lordy, I'm just setting myself up for fanboy backlash.

1016
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:02,420
I'm gonna go strictly in terms of based of what's available, and what I play, and where

1017
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:06,580
my time goes based on that, because, you know, our golden rule, we haven't said it a long

1018
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:11,500
time on this show, so let me reiterate the golden rule of gaming, a console is only as

1019
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,380
good as the games that are on it.

1020
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,380
Yep.

1021
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,380
Alright.

1022
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:20,120
So, that being said, I would say the Xbox 360 is number one, PC is number two, Wii is

1023
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,100
number three, Playstation 3 is number four.

1024
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,100
I agree with that.

1025
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:31,700
But let me put this honestly, based on the golden rule of gaming, like Xbox 360, PC,

1026
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:36,820
and Wii, well, I would say Xbox 360 and PC are like really close to the top, Wii down

1027
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,580
a little bit, but still near the top.

1028
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:39,580
It's getting there.

1029
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,580
Big gap.

1030
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,460
And then Playstation 3 at the bottom.

1031
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:49,620
Well, being that I have a PS3 and have a bunch of games for it, the only game I played on

1032
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:54,500
that one regularly was Marvel Ultimate Alliance, and, you know, and now that I have it on Xbox

1033
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,500
360, I'm like, well, why?

1034
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,500
What's the point?

1035
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,700
I can actually play it and not have to shake my controller around like an idiot and look

1036
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:05,340
like I'm having a seizure trying to do the underwater level, so screw it.

1037
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:09,980
You know you don't need to flail your arms around a lot, you can just do it with your

1038
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:10,980
wrist.

1039
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:11,980
She likes to flail.

1040
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,380
I don't know, but I hate it.

1041
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:14,980
Loki, what would be your list?

1042
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:21,740
I don't know about PC, I mean, I don't play a lot of PC stuff, so I would say probably,

1043
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:27,220
well, 360 because there's just a lot of games on it.

1044
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:32,540
Wii is hard, I mean, there's a lot of games out there, but I don't play it a lot, so actually

1045
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:37,200
I would say probably, and I don't want to put the Playstation, I guess I'd say the same

1046
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:42,380
list as you, Rob, but the thing is, you know, I don't play a lot of PC games because my

1047
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:48,900
computer sucks, and then I don't play definitely a lot of Playstation 3 games because there's

1048
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:54,940
really nothing out for it, and the Wii, there's just nothing out that I really must have.

1049
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:59,540
Sometimes, and I have to keep this in mind about PC gaming, is that PC gaming can also

1050
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:03,320
be a lot of those homebrew and freeware things you play that you can't really get on any

1051
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,980
other system, and you know, certainly games like World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XI

1052
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:11,860
on the PC, big time sink games for me, you know, I probably, when you add it up, I actually

1053
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:14,420
probably do more gaming on the PC than anywhere else.

1054
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:18,180
I'm surprised, though, Mac wasn't number one on there, because I would have thought the

1055
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,180
Mac would be on there.

1056
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,240
Oh, that's right, it wasn't one of the options.

1057
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,240
My mistake.

1058
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,240
No games.

1059
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,240
No games.

1060
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,240
Sorry.

1061
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,240
Shut up.

1062
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,240
All right, any more to that email, DarkSakura?

1063
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,240
That's it for the mailbag.

1064
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:33,480
All right, if you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

1065
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,480
Until then.

1066
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,480
More news, right, Logie?

1067
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,480
Dot com.

1068
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,140
Yeah, of course, I have tons of news for you, anyways.

1069
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:47,900
So yeah, there's a, I'm pulling up different stories now, anyways, there's some interesting

1070
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:52,740
rumors going around about the Mel Your Solid movie, one of which is that Christian Bale

1071
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:58,780
is up for the role for Solid Snake himself, so that'd be pretty interesting.

1072
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:09,700
I guess it's from a UK magazine called Nuts, which I'm not really sure if I would add.

1073
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:15,980
I don't know how that would really rate there, but they say he's in the running to play Solid

1074
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:20,260
Snake for the 2009 movie Mel Your Solid.

1075
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:24,380
And of course, I don't know.

1076
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:28,660
That's a big fat rumor, I think.

1077
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,660
I don't know.

1078
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:32,020
I don't know if he'd look good as Snake, though.

1079
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,920
Can't see him as Snake.

1080
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,180
They need someone who's a lot more hardcore.

1081
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,700
Well, if Tom Selleck were younger.

1082
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,860
No, no, no, no, no.

1083
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,780
If Kurt Russell were younger.

1084
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:43,780
Kurt Russell, yeah.

1085
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,140
I like Kurt Russell.

1086
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,700
Kurt Russell would be able to do it.

1087
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:48,340
Or he could play Old Snake.

1088
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,820
Or even Richard Dean Anderson.

1089
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:50,820
Yeah.

1090
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:56,780
Do you saw him in the, no, I'm thinking of two people who play the same character in

1091
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,780
Stargate.

1092
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,780
Maybe.

1093
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,780
I don't know.

1094
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:00,780
Alright.

1095
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:01,780
I love Stargate.

1096
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,780
Anyway.

1097
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,780
Stargate's okay.

1098
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:08,980
You know what else is okay?

1099
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:09,980
What?

1100
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:10,980
Handsets.

1101
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:12,540
I don't know.

1102
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:15,700
I don't have a transition for this.

1103
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:21,220
But Sony Ericsson is possibly going to tap into the PlayStation brand for some of the

1104
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:26,820
new high-end, meaning expensive, mobile phones that they're going to be putting out.

1105
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:30,620
Could they be turning the PlayStation brand into what the N-Gage was?

1106
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:31,860
Not really.

1107
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:37,460
But they'll just kind of be using the PlayStation branding to try and launch a possible, I'm

1108
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:39,380
sorry, there is not a gaming phone.

1109
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:40,380
I should say this.

1110
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,140
I don't know PSP phone slash thing or whatever.

1111
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:50,700
But since Ericsson and PlayStation are under the same corporate entity, Sony, why not explore

1112
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,420
the possibilities of what could happen?

1113
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,100
So there you go.

1114
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:58,980
They need to just bring out the freaking Vodafone over here and leave it at that.

1115
00:52:58,980 --> 00:52:59,980
I mean, who's going to care?

1116
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:02,740
Because everybody's buying one of those iPhones now.

1117
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,580
Even I'm tempted to get a stinking iPhone.

1118
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:08,580
But I'm holding out because I'm convinced next year they'll have GPS in them.

1119
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:10,620
That's the one thing that's missing that I want.

1120
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,620
I'm getting a BlackBerry.

1121
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:14,100
I think it's going to be revised so many times.

1122
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,420
I'm getting a BlackBerry.

1123
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,420
I'm trying so hard to resist the iPhone temptation.

1124
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:18,420
Let me just put it that way.

1125
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,420
I'm getting a BlackBerry.

1126
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:20,420
Well, aren't you special?

1127
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,420
I am.

1128
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:32,580
Well, for anyone who is interested in interesting ways of announcing games or hinting at games

1129
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:35,940
or starting weirdo rumors anyway.

1130
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:44,060
For the demo for Tony Hawk Proving Ground, there is a poster that says, shows a sequel

1131
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:48,260
for Gun, Magruder's Ghost.

1132
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:49,260
So is it a rumor?

1133
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,260
Is it a tease?

1134
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,260
Is it wishful thinking?

1135
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:54,100
Is it someone just trying to make a funny?

1136
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,460
Who knows?

1137
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:58,460
Hopefully it's a real game.

1138
00:53:58,460 --> 00:53:59,460
Gun was okay.

1139
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,460
I know it wasn't.

1140
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:01,460
It didn't sell very well.

1141
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:02,460
I know it's good.

1142
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:03,460
Gun didn't do very well.

1143
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,460
Did it?

1144
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:05,460
So I was kind of.

1145
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:09,500
I mean, they can always fix that stuff for sequels.

1146
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,180
That's the whole point of doing a sequel, to fix the crap that didn't work in the first

1147
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,180
one.

1148
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,180
Exactly.

1149
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:19,340
That's why we're on so many NBA Live games and Madden and whatnot.

1150
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:24,220
Anyways, this is kind of a little 180 of normal news.

1151
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:28,780
Conan, the game that was supposed to be coming out at the end of October, got bumped up into

1152
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:29,780
September.

1153
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:34,700
In fact, now it's coming out the week of September 28th to compete with Halo.

1154
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:35,700
Hooray!

1155
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:40,300
That's not the smartest move, but it's nice to see that the game's actually going to be

1156
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:43,020
coming out earlier than expected.

1157
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:49,020
It is going to be kind of a hack and slash action game, similar to God of War.

1158
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,020
Lots of blood.

1159
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:54,300
I know there's full frontal nudity, so hey, that's got two things that I need and that's

1160
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,380
probably going to guarantee a sale.

1161
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:57,780
I don't know.

1162
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,960
We don't get enough games with nudity.

1163
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,700
We need more games with nudity.

1164
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:02,700
Damn straight.

1165
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,380
I want niche nudity games.

1166
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:06,880
Manhunt 2 is supposed to have lots.

1167
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,020
There's a whole S&M club, I guess.

1168
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:12,380
Playboy Mansion or whatever, that's niche nudity.

1169
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:16,020
I want hardcore nudity in mainstream games.

1170
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:20,260
Is that too much to ask for?

1171
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:22,180
BMX Triple X was great.

1172
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,900
That was a bad game, though.

1173
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:24,900
I know, but it's...

1174
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:25,900
It was not a bad game.

1175
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:26,900
It was fun.

1176
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:33,180
Dave mirrored BMX and it just had weird shit like, you know, impress a dog so he gets horny

1177
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:34,180
and fucks another dog.

1178
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:37,420
I mean, just weird shit, but it was just excuses for you to do tricks and stuff.

1179
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:38,820
You had to pick up the hooker.

1180
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:39,820
And pick up the hookers.

1181
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:41,180
I mean, it's a fun game.

1182
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:42,500
It's really weird, granted.

1183
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,020
I think it's a game that makes fun of itself.

1184
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,020
It is.

1185
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,020
It is.

1186
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,020
And it's another one of those games.

1187
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:52,740
I kind of have the benchmark where it's stuff that my sister actually plays.

1188
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:56,740
It's weird because they like these weird, nichey games like Driver 3 that's completely

1189
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:03,060
awful, but they find it fun, just like they find BMX Triple X fun, because it's really

1190
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,060
weird.

1191
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:07,700
You know what really weird game I want them to make a new one of?

1192
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,020
Jumping Flash.

1193
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:10,780
Okay, like, the whole chat...

1194
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:14,900
Okay, now like Leo Kristoff in chat says, why do you want to pay for CGI porn and Ross

1195
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,940
Steele UT says, guy, fuck no, I don't want porn games, really.

1196
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:18,940
I didn't...

1197
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:19,940
I said, I don't want porn games.

1198
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:23,540
I just want, like, you know, random nudity inserted into video games.

1199
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:27,620
Like, you know, it's like when you watch a movie, and then like, you know, like you're

1200
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:31,060
watching the movie and like, oh, I didn't know I'd get that ass shot, or, oh, tease.

1201
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,060
Life is Brian.

1202
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:33,060
You know?

1203
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,060
Yeah, or, you know, boop.

1204
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:36,900
Where he comes out fully naked and addresses the crowd.

1205
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:37,900
Where is that?

1206
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:38,900
We just need...

1207
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,820
It's gotta be porn.

1208
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:41,820
It's tasteful.

1209
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:42,820
We need random...

1210
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:46,780
Artistic purposes, because games are art, after all.

1211
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:49,500
We need random occurrences of naked.

1212
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:53,460
Of course, I hope you guys know what happens.

1213
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:57,860
No ferret bestiality, oh my God, DT, what the hell are you on?

1214
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:59,420
I'm half kidding, chat room.

1215
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,380
I hope you guys know.

1216
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:06,740
But there is no kidding around that PC is getting a new version, I'm sorry, is getting

1217
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:10,860
a new game called Stranglehold, which of course is coming to all the consoles as well.

1218
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:14,300
But Stranglehold is coming out this week on the consoles, but if you want to check out

1219
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:17,780
a demo, it's up now.

1220
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:24,140
The game ships on September 18th, but the PC demo is available to download right now.

1221
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:30,340
So if you want to check that out, go to your favorite downloading site, such as, you know,

1222
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:34,020
I don't know, what's a good site that doesn't make you pay to download stuff?

1223
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:37,220
Like, you know, because I hate those ones that are like, you know, oh, you get this

1224
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,220
many spots.

1225
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,220
Just find a torrent.

1226
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:40,220
Yeah, or just find a torrent.

1227
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:41,220
Game spots sometimes.

1228
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:42,780
That's a legal use of a torrent, so you can go for that.

1229
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:43,780
So Stranglehold.

1230
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:47,780
By the way, I did want to say this real quick, sorry, is that I thought it was interesting

1231
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:51,420
that I, because I want to use this story as an excuse to talk about MySpace and logging

1232
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:52,420
on to MySpace lately.

1233
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:54,980
I've noticed a lot of ads for Stranglehold on MySpace.

1234
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,620
I don't know if you guys have noticed this.

1235
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:00,860
I mean, usually ads are blocked, but for some reason these show up.

1236
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:05,500
And it's just so funny the way they're advertising the game to me is like, more stuff to blow

1237
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,420
up than any game ever.

1238
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:11,100
Just I don't know, it made me laugh.

1239
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:16,060
You know what, that would be the whole reason I would buy a game, is explosions.

1240
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:20,940
Well, speaking of things that aren't exploding, however, you can probably get some neat pyrotechnics

1241
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,740
included.

1242
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:27,660
More information about Guitar Hero 3 Legends of Rock is that it will be coming out on the

1243
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,700
PC and the Mac.

1244
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,460
Games on a Mac!

1245
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:34,500
Like snakes on a plane, but not really.

1246
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:41,620
It will have the same gameplay, same content as the console versions, unlockable, multiplayer

1247
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:49,580
mode, boss battles, I do believe downloadable content, which would make sense.

1248
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:53,900
And it's Guitar Hero.

1249
00:58:53,900 --> 00:59:00,740
And it'll be cracked so wide open that it'll be freely available before you know it.

1250
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:05,220
And it's not that, but I'm waiting for people to crack this game to insert their own shit

1251
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:06,220
into it.

1252
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:08,460
It's been done on Playstation 2 and stuff.

1253
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:09,820
It's only a matter of time.

1254
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:14,580
I've seen Playstation 2 ones done with Metroid Metal music.

1255
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:18,740
And I just want to say though, shortly after the release of this game is when America is

1256
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:23,400
going to realize that we're just oversaturated with Guitar Hero crap and I think the series

1257
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,940
will start to decline.

1258
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:27,740
Just about, just like DDR.

1259
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,740
We'll see, we'll see.

1260
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:30,740
Anyways.

1261
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:35,340
Ah, so, um, and then my, there we go.

1262
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:39,220
Nintendo Midnight 64 mentioned that there's already something like that on PC called Fretz

1263
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:40,380
on Fire.

1264
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:43,260
And maybe that's why they want to do this, you know, because they realize there is a

1265
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:44,980
market for the PC guitars, who knows.

1266
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:47,540
Yeah, that's how we get like in the groove.

1267
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:48,540
Yay.

1268
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:52,060
Um, so, GameStop, once again we're talking about them.

1269
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:56,740
Now they're planning on catering to the casual gamer.

1270
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:57,740
Yay.

1271
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:02,860
Um, apparently they're going to be redesigning their stores or rearranging them, um, kind

1272
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:03,860
of as a test.

1273
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:07,420
And what they're going to do is they're going to have a couple new sections, including one

1274
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:09,780
dedicated to children's and family games.

1275
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:17,020
Uh, another section is going to be dedicated to, um, I guess, uh, like music rhythm games.

1276
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:20,460
I mean, because there's quite a bit of stuff and I know they try to push a lot of those

1277
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,460
peripherals.

1278
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:27,860
Um, and then I guess they're going to have, uh, new sections for kiosks, I guess one that

1279
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:32,220
will also highlight music games and another one that will highlight family games.

1280
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:39,500
So new kiosks, new sections, new reason to go to GameStop, probably not.

1281
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:44,660
You know what I think GameStop's biggest failure has been lately, is, um, them, uh, not selling

1282
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:48,200
anything older than, um, PS2.

1283
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:54,460
I had to go to Fry's today, an electronics store nearby that's pretty big, because none

1284
01:00:54,460 --> 01:01:00,220
of the GameStops within a 111 mile radius had any PSP cables.

1285
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:01,220
Awesome.

1286
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:02,660
Not cool.

1287
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:05,880
Yeah, you can still go to GameCrazy and buy Genesis.

1288
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,380
There are options, folks.

1289
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:09,460
Don't need to necessarily go to GameStop.

1290
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:14,600
And also think about this, um, remember I bought the collector's edition of Bioshock

1291
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,140
so I can get the Big Daddy.

1292
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:20,860
Would I really have missed it if I didn't buy the collector's edition?

1293
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:21,860
Probably not.

1294
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:26,740
So don't be fooled in buying this shit for, like, crappy little trinkets that you probably

1295
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:27,740
don't need anyways.

1296
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:30,500
GameCrazy needs your money.

1297
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:31,500
That's all I'm going to say.

1298
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,820
Yeah, they need a lot of money.

1299
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:35,700
They need a whole lot of money.

1300
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:36,700
Anyway.

1301
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:37,700
Alright.

1302
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,460
Well, is that it for the news tonight?

1303
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:41,460
I think it is.

1304
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:42,460
I think so.

1305
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:45,260
So this is where we open up the Skype line and let you guys interact with our program.

1306
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:51,260
If you want to give us a call, our phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype

1307
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:56,620
is OrangeLoungeRadio and the Skype line is open and you guys can give us a call.

1308
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:57,620
So we'll wait for some calls.

1309
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:58,620
I don't know.

1310
01:01:58,620 --> 01:01:59,620
Our listenership seems to be down a little bit tonight.

1311
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:03,060
I don't know if that's the Emmys to thank for that or Back to School or the fact that

1312
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:04,060
our show just sucks.

1313
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:08,420
I don't know what it is, but we don't have a lot of live listeners as much as usual tonight.

1314
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:14,000
So I'm hoping that we get some calls at some point, but the line is open.

1315
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,620
So go ahead and start calling.

1316
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:17,820
In the meantime, do we have any last minute stories?

1317
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:19,820
Oh yeah.

1318
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:20,820
Let's see.

1319
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:21,820
Let's start off here.

1320
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:25,580
Of course, Colin McRae, he's died in an helicopter crash.

1321
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:32,140
You may remember him from such rally racing events that have happened, of course, in Europe

1322
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:39,540
and also because he's had his name on various rally racing games, including Dirt, which

1323
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:40,860
is actually pretty awesome.

1324
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:44,660
But unfortunately, he has passed away.

1325
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:45,660
Let's see.

1326
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:52,180
Also, I was going to say that China, this is funny, China's gaming companies are trying

1327
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:54,540
to combat piracy.

1328
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:55,540
I don't know.

1329
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:58,940
If that gets you to laugh, I don't know what will, so.

1330
01:02:58,940 --> 01:02:59,940
Okay.

1331
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:06,300
Well, I mean, China is just big on, you know, a ton of pirate stuff coming out of there.

1332
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:07,300
Yeah, but that's a scene.

1333
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:12,020
You can't, you know, label everybody as, you know, participating in the piracy rings.

1334
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:13,020
All right, fine.

1335
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:14,020
All right.

1336
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:15,020
We got calls on Skype.

1337
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:16,020
Let's go to that.

1338
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:17,020
We'll get the rest of your stories in a minute.

1339
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:18,020
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1340
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:19,020
Colin, are you there?

1341
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:20,020
Yes, I am.

1342
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:21,020
And it's not Raven's Dolphin.

1343
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:23,580
Oh, well, who is it then?

1344
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:28,580
It's DJ Rama S. Well, hello, DJ Rama S. So somebody different got through first for once

1345
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:29,580
this week.

1346
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:30,580
All right.

1347
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:31,580
What's on your mind, buddy?

1348
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:32,580
Not much.

1349
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:37,180
I want to make a comment about the whole GameStop thing about the man who got basically

1350
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:40,460
suspended for only selling games to smart people.

1351
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:45,580
I can't say I don't blame him for doing that because I used to work in a video store and

1352
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:51,100
the video store was like right by the schools and they would come in all the time and mess

1353
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:52,100
the place up.

1354
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:56,540
And then we started doing stuff like that, you know, we started doing like a program

1355
01:03:56,540 --> 01:04:00,180
where if you had good grades, you get free rentals and stuff.

1356
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:05,900
And we were basically like a mom and pop store and we basically knew the families and stuff

1357
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:07,980
and they were coming all the time.

1358
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:12,540
And we, you know, we basically knew if you weren't doing too well in school and stuff,

1359
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:15,740
you weren't renting games at all, as simple as that.

1360
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:19,660
Well, I'm sorry, I was typing in chat.

1361
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:20,660
What?

1362
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:21,660
Sorry.

1363
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:23,140
Everybody's like, I'm sorry.

1364
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:24,580
Restate your question real quick.

1365
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:28,940
No, what I said was I used to work at a mom and pop store and we basically did the same

1366
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:31,240
thing what this GameStop manager did.

1367
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:35,580
If you were, you know, if you were stupid, you know, like that, we wouldn't rent games

1368
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:36,580
to you.

1369
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:37,580
Simple as that.

1370
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:38,580
Wow.

1371
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:41,740
So how, how exactly would you do the whole report card thing, the grades thing?

1372
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:43,380
Yeah, that's what we did.

1373
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:44,380
Wow.

1374
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,820
And how did that go over?

1375
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:51,380
Basically the parents liked it because one thing was for sure was that, you know, we

1376
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:54,740
knew the parents knew, they knew they weren't doing their homework because they were too

1377
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:58,820
busy mulling around in our store, checking out the games and stuff like that.

1378
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:03,180
We had to like kick them out from time to time and just like, you know, it's like three,

1379
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:06,460
three, four o'clock, you've been here over an hour, you should be at home doing your

1380
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:10,300
homework instead of drooling over the games that you want to buy or rent.

1381
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:11,300
Simple as that.

1382
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:12,300
Wow.

1383
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:15,620
You know, I don't have a problem with people kicking out lawyers, but I mean, I don't think

1384
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:19,660
it's a great business practice to turn away business, especially when most of the mom

1385
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:25,180
and pop stores I talk to on a daily basis are having trouble selling games, let alone,

1386
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:27,140
you know, they're not like swimming in money.

1387
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:36,100
So I wouldn't, I would highly, you know, advise against it despite how tempting it may be.

1388
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:39,660
Mystic Gohan says, what if my homework is to play a game?

1389
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:42,700
That was from our chat.

1390
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,620
So that went over okay.

1391
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:46,540
There wasn't a lot of controversy there.

1392
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:48,420
No, not at all.

1393
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:53,740
You know, like I said, we were small, so everybody knew each other and it was pretty cool about

1394
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:55,580
it, you know?

1395
01:05:55,580 --> 01:06:01,940
And I mean, overall, I don't blame this manager for doing it, but it's not his job to be the

1396
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:05,280
parent of over these kids, you know?

1397
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:09,820
I mean, these parents should be more responsible and stuff like that, you know?

1398
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:10,820
That's the way I see it.

1399
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:15,380
You know, overall, I give him points for doing that, but not at the risk of your job, you

1400
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:16,380
know?

1401
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:17,380
All right.

1402
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:21,980
Well, thank you for the insight, I guess, from having been working for a game store

1403
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:23,540
that used to kind of do this.

1404
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:25,780
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

1405
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:27,980
No, that's just I just want to throw my two cents about there.

1406
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:28,980
That's all.

1407
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:29,980
Well, I appreciate it.

1408
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:30,980
I'm sorry I missed you the first time.

1409
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:33,620
I thought someone else was listening and I was trying to work on a question that got

1410
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:36,620
asked in chat, so I didn't want you to feel like I was ignoring you.

1411
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:37,620
I'm sorry.

1412
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:39,100
We multitask while doing the show.

1413
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:40,780
I know that feeling.

1414
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:41,780
All right.

1415
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:42,780
Take care, buddy.

1416
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:43,780
You too.

1417
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:44,780
All right.

1418
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:45,780
Bye-bye.

1419
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:46,780
All right.

1420
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:50,940
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is ORANGE LOUNGE

1421
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:54,220
RADIO on Skype.

1422
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:56,580
Loki give us another last minute story while we wait for another call because there's a

1423
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:57,580
bit of a delay.

1424
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:58,580
Okay.

1425
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:04,220
So Jam Sessions has come out last week, I guess, and funny enough, if you purchase it

1426
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:08,740
through Best Buy, you've got three hidden tracks.

1427
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:13,060
Well, actually anybody can get the hidden tracks, and funny enough, it's the Konami

1428
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:17,500
code which unlocks those hidden tracks, despite the fact that the game's actually being made

1429
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,660
by Ubisoft.

1430
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:24,200
So to unlock Brad Paisley, I'm going to miss her, Jimi Hendrix, Wild Thing, and Tom Petty

1431
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,240
Needles and Pins.

1432
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:31,060
Simply push up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, during free mode, and it will

1433
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:32,060
give you those three songs.

1434
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:33,060
Wait.

1435
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:34,060
And what game is this?

1436
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:35,060
Jam Sessions.

1437
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:36,900
Isn't this the game that some of our listeners told you to stay away from?

1438
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:37,900
Yeah.

1439
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:38,900
Oh, okay.

1440
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:39,900
All right.

1441
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:40,900
Well, let's go to the phones.

1442
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:41,900
We've got another call coming in.

1443
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:42,900
Hi.

1444
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:43,900
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

1445
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:44,900
Who's this?

1446
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:45,900
This is Jason.

1447
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:46,900
Hi, Jason.

1448
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:47,900
And we do need a new jumping flash now.

1449
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:48,900
Jumping flash.

1450
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:49,900
Amen.

1451
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:50,900
Oh, man.

1452
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:54,260
Jamie said that, and I smiled so big.

1453
01:07:54,260 --> 01:08:00,100
Jumping flash was my first ever PlayStation game, back when Blockbuster still rented out

1454
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:07,940
the systems, and I paid the, what, $150, well, my dad paid the $150 deposit, and I rented

1455
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:13,460
the system along with jumping flash and a Revolution X.

1456
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:14,460
Revolution X is awesome.

1457
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:16,820
Revolution X was awful at home, though.

1458
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:23,620
Yeah, it was, but I enjoyed it, and I laughed, and I played it regardless.

1459
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:25,740
The only system I ever rented was a Neo Geo.

1460
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:30,500
That's why I played Fatal Fury Special at home, which was all sorts of awesome.

1461
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:31,500
Let's see.

1462
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:32,500
What else was I going to ask about?

1463
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,300
I'm trying to remember what the first PlayStation game I ever played was.

1464
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:35,500
It might have been Final Fantasy VII.

1465
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:36,500
I don't think I...

1466
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:37,500
Oh, no, no.

1467
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,500
I remember.

1468
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:39,500
I bought my PlayStation with Crash Bandicoot 2.

1469
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,500
That was the first PlayStation game I ever played.

1470
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,500
So I got into the PlayStation game a little late.

1471
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,460
I think that was the one when I actually owned it.

1472
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:45,460
Huh?

1473
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:49,780
I think Crash Bandicoot was my first game when I actually owned a PlayStation as well.

1474
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:50,780
Wow.

1475
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:54,740
But as I said, I rented it well before that, and Jumping Flash was my first ever PlayStation

1476
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:55,740
game.

1477
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:56,740
Mm-hmm.

1478
01:08:56,740 --> 01:09:00,860
I was a freshman in college, and my roommate's boyfriend had a PlayStation, but my friend

1479
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:06,660
had imported a Saturn before, so I'd actually played an import Saturn before we got them

1480
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:07,660
over here.

1481
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:08,660
You know what would be hilarious?

1482
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:09,660
Oh, sorry.

1483
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:16,300
I was just thinking, you know how they were talking about Guitar Hero 4 as being, I guess,

1484
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,060
Aerosmith's going to be the big thing for that.

1485
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:22,580
Wouldn't it be hilarious if they had Revolution X as an unlockable in that?

1486
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:23,580
I didn't say...

1487
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,980
Fire CD is for whaling boner.

1488
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:32,220
Well, what I was saying about the PlayStation stuff, though, is that my first PlayStation

1489
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:36,180
game that I played was Toshinden and Jumping Flash.

1490
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:39,180
Those were my first two.

1491
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:42,340
And you said you were a freshman in college, and I don't even think I was in middle school

1492
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:43,340
at that point.

1493
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:44,340
I may have just been, but...

1494
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:45,620
Thank you for making me feel old.

1495
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:46,620
I'm sorry.

1496
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:47,620
I know.

1497
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:48,620
I'm sorry.

1498
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:54,380
But my first Saturn game that I played was that really crappy Gundam game, and Golden

1499
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:55,380
Axe the Duel.

1500
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:59,180
I didn't even know they made that game on Saturn.

1501
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:00,180
Oh, yeah.

1502
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:01,180
It was really...

1503
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:02,180
It was actually a good game.

1504
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:06,620
I only remember two or three things about the Saturn.

1505
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:13,060
One of them was a friend of mine with the extra memory chip or something like that,

1506
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:18,020
something along those lines, some kind of an expansion chip, Knights, and some weird

1507
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:19,940
mech game that I played at...

1508
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:22,060
Oh, I don't even remember where it was anymore.

1509
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:26,660
I think it was at Hastings or something like that on one of their demo kiosks, but I next

1510
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:28,940
had no idea what it is anymore.

1511
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:32,140
Saturn was the machine you had if you were an importer, though, because you had arcade

1512
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:38,660
perfect copies of Marvel Super Heroes versus Street Fighters, X-Men versus Street Fighter.

1513
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:43,980
You had all the King of Fighters games, even though the load time was just completely ridiculous.

1514
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:44,980
Virtual on...

1515
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:54,260
Ready for the beginning, CD systems, kind of, for mainstream, that didn't crash horribly.

1516
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:55,260
I still...

1517
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:56,260
Oh, yeah.

1518
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:58,800
And RalstillUT points out that all the working designs games came out for Saturn, like the

1519
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:06,620
Rayearth RPG, and I actually did games, though, for the Sega CD, like they did...

1520
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:09,340
We had Popful Mail over here from Working Designs.

1521
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:16,980
But yeah, Fighters Megamix, Sephiroth 1215s us, but the Saturn just completely kicked

1522
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:19,780
the PlayStation's ass, and I'm sorry that it did so badly over here.

1523
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:20,780
Oh, of course.

1524
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:21,780
Oh, and Puzzle Fighter.

1525
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:26,060
Thank you to the people that did own the Saturn, the notion that that was the importer's console.

1526
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:29,220
Yes, that was very true, now that I think about it.

1527
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:34,140
It's funny, Dan and I used to hook up our Saturn and our PlayStation and have the same

1528
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:37,900
games in them, because we actually had a few of the games that were the same on both systems,

1529
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:41,780
and we would compare what they looked like, and the Saturn was it for anything that was

1530
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:44,740
2D or required a lot of memory.

1531
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:50,460
Even though the PlayStation was built for 3D, we compared Symphony of the Night, because

1532
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:55,980
I have the Japanese one on the Saturn, and all the 3D effects looked a lot better on

1533
01:11:55,980 --> 01:12:02,580
the PlayStation, of course, but all of the sprites and the music was better on the Saturn,

1534
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:05,100
because I think the Saturn had a better sound processor.

1535
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:10,020
The music being better was really common to pretty much every game on the Saturn, wasn't

1536
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:11,020
it?

1537
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:12,020
I think so.

1538
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:13,020
Well, a lot of things...

1539
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:14,020
I remember hearing something along those lines.

1540
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:17,500
They did have a lot of games, too, that were Red Book, and also other games that were pointed

1541
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:25,140
out were Guardian Heroes, Panzer Dragoon, Sonic Jam, Silhouette Mirage, Dragon Force.

1542
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:28,860
Sonic Jam, yes, that one is a very big deal.

1543
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:34,780
I remember my girlfriend really complaining about Sonic Jam's collection and the fact

1544
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:41,740
that they used the Sega CD version of Sonic Jam instead of the Saturn version, because

1545
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:49,820
the Saturn version actually had the true epic music composed to synthesized, MIDI-ish track

1546
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:50,820
version.

1547
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:55,300
And that's, yes, the world of difference right there.

1548
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:58,900
Wow, it's like a trip down memory lane here.

1549
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:06,300
Well, also, for me being an importer, I actually lucked into a copy of Grandia on Saturn, and

1550
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:11,420
comparing that to the PlayStation 1, oh my God, the PlayStation 1 was crap.

1551
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:16,620
Even the 3D was crap in it, and it was so much better on Saturn.

1552
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:20,780
The music, you actually had a bigger view field, so you could see more stuff that was

1553
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:22,300
going on in the game.

1554
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:24,220
The timing was better.

1555
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:26,980
Everything came out so much better on the Saturn version.

1556
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:30,500
All right, Sega fanboys, we gotta wrap up and go to another call.

1557
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:34,860
Jason, any last thoughts quickly before we move on?

1558
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:42,740
Bust-A-Move Bash with the Wii controller is absolutely, it makes so much sense, it plays

1559
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:45,300
so well, it is very, very fun.

1560
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,180
What game?

1561
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:51,900
Bust-A-Move Bash, it's like a puzzle game where you can play up to eight players at

1562
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:52,900
one time.

1563
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:56,500
My mind went to the old dance game, and I was like, there's a fucking new Bust-A-Move

1564
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,500
out?

1565
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:01,140
I knew it would have, I should have said Puzzle Bobble Bash, because it would make more sense

1566
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:02,140
to you pretty much immediately.

1567
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:03,140
No, that's all right, okay.

1568
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:08,580
Bust-A-Move Bash for the Wii, the Wiimote control is so intuitive, it is so easy to

1569
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:10,420
pick up and play, it is so fun.

1570
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:11,420
Really?

1571
01:14:11,420 --> 01:14:12,420
Might have to check it out.

1572
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:13,420
Yes.

1573
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:14,420
All right.

1574
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:15,420
It's pretty cheap.

1575
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:16,420
Give it a shot.

1576
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:17,420
It's fun.

1577
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:22,140
Even though I've played this game like 50 times, this will be worth it, right?

1578
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:25,220
You might want to play it on mute, I'll warn you that.

1579
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:26,220
If you don't...

1580
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:28,900
Well, maybe I can use my custom soundtrack for the Winamp, hopefully.

1581
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:29,900
We'll see.

1582
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:30,900
Oh, yeah, that's true, huh?

1583
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:31,900
Who knows?

1584
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:32,900
I haven't gotten that yet.

1585
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:33,900
I need to.

1586
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:36,900
All right, Jason, we've got to let you go, but have a good one, okay, buddy?

1587
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:37,900
You too.

1588
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:38,900
All right, bye-bye.

1589
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:39,900
Goodnight.

1590
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:44,420
Thanks for hearing from Jason, our fearless webmaster, for OrangeLunchRadio.com.

1591
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:47,580
We'll probably take one more call, then we're going to call it a night, because we are running

1592
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:48,580
a little bit long tonight.

1593
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:50,300
I don't know what's going on with that.

1594
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:53,300
Another last-minute story real quick, Loki, if you have any more.

1595
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:54,300
Yeah.

1596
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:55,300
Do you have any?

1597
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:56,300
I have a whole ton.

1598
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:59,300
Anyways, they were talking a little bit bizarre.

1599
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:03,460
They were talking about Project Anthem Racing 5 and what they want to do with that.

1600
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:09,540
One thing that they're looking to do is possibly off-road stuff, including quad bikes and off-road

1601
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:10,540
tracks.

1602
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:11,540
So, that's kind of neat.

1603
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:13,220
All right, we've got another call real quick.

1604
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:14,620
Hi, you're on OrangeLunchRadio.

1605
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:15,620
Who's this?

1606
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:16,620
GS68.

1607
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:17,860
Well, hello, GS68.

1608
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:19,060
What's on your mind, buddy?

1609
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:24,780
Yeah, you know the thing about the New Jersey parents reacting to the Wii Zapper?

1610
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:27,340
I'm sorry, the parents that are getting mad about the Wii Zapper?

1611
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:28,340
Yeah, yeah.

1612
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:29,340
I was particularly offended.

1613
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:33,980
I mean, for fuck's sake, I grew up with light gun games.

1614
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:37,900
And are you thinking about going and shooting actual people?

1615
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,180
No.

1616
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:44,260
You know, and I wonder, at the carnivals, even before the days of video games, I mean,

1617
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:48,740
they still have the county fairs and the state fairs and the various carnivals around.

1618
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:52,420
Don't they have those BB gun shooting games where you shoot pellets, as many pellets as

1619
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:56,220
you can through the little silhouette, and if you can punch out the star completely,

1620
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:57,220
you get a prize?

1621
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,220
They have better than that now.

1622
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,220
That's true.

1623
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,700
They have to shoot the paintballs at the man thing.

1624
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:01,700
Cool.

1625
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:04,740
They have a guy in riot gear, and you can shoot him with paintballs.

1626
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:05,740
Wow.

1627
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:08,140
And don't they have, they also have a shooting range.

1628
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:12,540
You know, remember, like that fucking thing they have at Scandia, that's like that whole

1629
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:15,460
elaborate set up, like the Wild West, you can shoot like...

1630
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:17,460
I think they have one of those at Tilt.

1631
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:22,820
Okay, so anyway, I mean, yeah, these types of games existed long before video games,

1632
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:27,500
so these are just a couple of dumbasses who somehow got their name in the media.

1633
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,180
And don't you mean start it with Nerf guns?

1634
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:32,420
I mean, they're obviously for kids, and they shoot real projectiles.

1635
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:33,420
Or Super Soaker.

1636
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:34,800
I keep thinking of that one commercial.

1637
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,060
It's all over YouTube.

1638
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:39,820
It doesn't worry us, it says not to shoot someone in the face with it.

1639
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:40,820
Anyway.

1640
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:42,540
I like getting Super Soakers and putting ink in them.

1641
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:44,260
Why would you do that?

1642
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:45,260
That's mean.

1643
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:46,900
We used to when I was in middle school.

1644
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:48,100
Why would you do that?

1645
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:49,100
Because we were mean.

1646
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:50,780
You were a bad child.

1647
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:52,980
I should take it back.

1648
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:56,060
Well, yeah, I agree with you, GS68.

1649
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:57,060
These people are dumbasses.

1650
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:58,060
But what can you do?

1651
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:01,620
In every village, there's an idiot, right?

1652
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:02,620
Yeah.

1653
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:06,140
Well, any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1654
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:07,140
I don't think so.

1655
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:08,140
All right.

1656
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:09,140
Well, thank you for your rant.

1657
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:10,140
We appreciate it.

1658
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:11,140
And it fits in well with our program.

1659
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:12,140
No problem.

1660
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:13,140
All right.

1661
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:14,140
Bye-bye, dude.

1662
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:15,140
See ya.

1663
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:16,140
All right.

1664
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:18,980
That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

1665
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:20,140
Thank you to those that got through.

1666
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:21,720
Sorry to those that didn't.

1667
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:26,380
The new Skype is so weird because I can't, like...

1668
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:31,460
If five calls are coming in at once, I have to hang up on four to answer the one.

1669
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:35,420
And then the people that I hung up on will try to call right back.

1670
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:36,660
So I can never pick up a call.

1671
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:39,820
So now I have to force the calls to go to voicemail if we're already in a call.

1672
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:44,460
But then the people that keep calling back in seem to get right through.

1673
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:46,100
It's really weird.

1674
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,100
But I don't know.

1675
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:48,100
We'll see.

1676
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:49,100
We'll see what we can do with Skype.

1677
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:50,100
I just want the old version back.

1678
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:51,100
Okay.

1679
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:52,100
Sorry.

1680
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:53,100
Sorry.

1681
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,100
Last minute news.

1682
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:57,780
To go back to what we were talking about earlier, Eternal Sonata has definitely been confirmed

1683
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:59,180
for the PlayStation 3.

1684
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:02,820
In fact, it will be shown at Tokyo Game Show in video form only.

1685
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:07,220
And there's actually some updates on what the PlayStation 3 will have that the Xbox

1686
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:13,620
360 won't, including new playable characters and a new clothing system in the works.

1687
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:15,460
So that's kind of interesting.

1688
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:16,660
And I guess...

1689
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:20,220
That is interesting with the release of the game in the U.S. only days away.

1690
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:23,920
Now they're telling us, oh, wait, maybe you want to wait for the PlayStation 3 version.

1691
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:32,900
For those who love the game's characters will want to pay attention to Bandai Namco is also

1692
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:37,300
working on a costume system that will allow you to freely change your character's costumes.

1693
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:40,100
Accompanying this is an increase in costume variations.

1694
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:45,340
So unfortunately, PlayStation 3 owners will have to wait until 2008 to get their hands

1695
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:47,740
on this RPG update.

1696
01:18:47,740 --> 01:18:49,940
So that was kind of funny.

1697
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:57,460
And some other things, real quick, Hot Shots Golf Online is coming out on PSP.

1698
01:18:57,460 --> 01:19:00,460
That's another thing that's going to be shown at Tokyo Game Show.

1699
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:06,540
As well as there's going to be a free online RPG coming to the PlayStation 3 from Q Entertainment.

1700
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:07,740
That is interesting.

1701
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:09,060
I guess it's going to be...

1702
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:11,780
Oh, God, I hope that's not the actual...

1703
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:12,780
Oh, no.

1704
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:15,580
It's the one we were talking about before, Angel Love Online.

1705
01:19:15,580 --> 01:19:20,060
I think it's the one where you have to have sex with people and you get impregnated or

1706
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:21,060
something.

1707
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:22,060
What?

1708
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:23,060
What?

1709
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:24,060
There was one, though.

1710
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,060
I saw this on Kotaku.

1711
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:26,060
From Q Entertainment?

1712
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:27,060
No.

1713
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:28,060
No.

1714
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:29,060
There's something else.

1715
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:30,060
Angel Love Online is what it's called.

1716
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:31,860
But I swear to God, I thought there was something that you had to impregnate women or something

1717
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:36,940
and then you created new characters based off that or something.

1718
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:38,940
There was some weird thing about that.

1719
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:42,860
Anyways, other things to note real quick.

1720
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:47,380
There's another rumor coming from 1UP's podcast saying that Kingdom Hearts Zero is going to

1721
01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:53,500
be announced at Tokyo Game Show and that Crisis Core is not the last Final Fantasy VII game.

1722
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:57,060
I can only hope that Crisis Core is the last Final Fantasy VII game.

1723
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:58,780
There is way too damn many.

1724
01:19:58,780 --> 01:19:59,780
You know what?

1725
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:02,440
Kingdom Hearts Zero would make a lot of sense because the creators come out and said the

1726
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:04,380
next game is not Kingdom Hearts 3.

1727
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:06,660
That would be a cute little trick to play.

1728
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:08,300
It's actually Kingdom Hearts Zero.

1729
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:09,300
But here's the thing.

1730
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:12,820
If it doesn't have the Disney tie-in this time, like if that's their way to not have

1731
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:14,900
Disney tie-ins this time, I'm not buying it.

1732
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:18,620
I'm sorry, but the Disney tie-ins make that game.

1733
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:22,500
And then the other thing, this is kind of going to DDR Universe.

1734
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:28,820
Apparently, if you were one of those people that downloaded the download content for Universe

1735
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:34,620
1, it will not be compatible with Universe 2, unlike the UltraMix series where all your

1736
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:39,460
download content was transferable to each additional game.

1737
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:45,460
So sucks if you downloaded that one thing that they had.

1738
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:46,820
So that's interesting.

1739
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:52,260
Well, I think this is kind of cool, something I wouldn't mind looking forward to.

1740
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:59,020
Actually the developer that brought us R-Type, Irem, they're bringing out SteamBot 2 on PS3

1741
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,820
for anyone who's interested.

1742
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:10,100
Over in Japan, it's Bumpy Trot, but it's a non-linear action-adventure game.

1743
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:14,660
And there's a comparison made between GTA and Harvest Moon, so I think that'd be pretty

1744
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:15,660
cool.

1745
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:17,540
It'll be announced at Tokyo Game Show.

1746
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:21,220
GTA meets Harvest Moon, that's awesome.

1747
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:22,220
I would exactly...

1748
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:24,100
Milk my cow, now die!

1749
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:27,660
No, it is not that good of a game, trust me.

1750
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:30,300
That would be awesome.

1751
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,900
Grand Theft Farmer.

1752
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:34,460
Yeah, that's not quite...

1753
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:36,260
That's it.

1754
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:40,180
Alright, well then if that's it for the last minute stories, then that means it's time

1755
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:41,740
to wrap up this damn show.

1756
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:44,300
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1757
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:46,380
We'll start off with Loki tonight.

1758
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:47,380
Loki, what's your final thought?

1759
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:52,300
My final thought is I don't want to see the next Resident Evil movie.

1760
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:56,540
My final thought is I am craving a Marie Callender's pie right now.

1761
01:21:56,540 --> 01:21:58,820
I want pies so bad it hurts.

1762
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:03,260
I had to buy a pie for a potluck and then we left before we even got to dessert.

1763
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:06,140
So my poor pie, I had to leave.

1764
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:07,140
Now I crave a pie.

1765
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:08,140
Poor baby.

1766
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:09,140
I know, poor me.

1767
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:10,900
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

1768
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:17,540
I have to wake up at 4 in the morning because I have to be at work at 6 so that I can leave

1769
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:21,340
at 10 and go to a dentist appointment.

1770
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:25,540
Fortunately for me, it's just a routine cleaning and I always fall asleep.

1771
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:26,540
And then I get to go home.

1772
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:27,540
Lucky you.

1773
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:29,020
It's because I hate the dentist.

1774
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:33,660
These very comfortable chairs at my dentist's office and they're cushy and they're completely

1775
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:34,820
ergonomic.

1776
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:38,940
So when you're laying in them, you're not like, you know, sections propped up.

1777
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:42,780
It's completely curved to your body shape with like memory foam and shit.

1778
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:45,420
And I'm like, I'm going to pass out now.

1779
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:48,220
Do whatever you want to to my teeth.

1780
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:49,220
It's great.

1781
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:50,220
Lucky you.

1782
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:51,220
That's all I have to say.

1783
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:52,220
I love my dentist.

1784
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:53,220
All right.

1785
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:54,220
Well, that's going to do it for the show tonight.

1786
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:57,580
Boys and girls, thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting independent

1787
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:59,340
radio and independent podcasts.

1788
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:00,340
You guys are awesome.

1789
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:04,340
And of course, it's you guys downloading us and participating and letting us know you

1790
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:09,500
care that keeps us going from week to week for almost 250 shows now, if you can believe

1791
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,620
it.

1792
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:12,620
But that's going to do it for this week.

1793
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:16,280
Remember, if you like our show, all we ask, tell two people you know about the show because

1794
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:19,460
if everybody tells two people, then slowly we take over the world.

1795
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:23,580
Or if you have no friends, which would be sad and I'm sorry for one, but if you have

1796
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:24,580
no friends, you can tell about the show.

1797
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:25,580
Tell your imaginary friends.

1798
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:30,220
Leave us a review on iTunes, a positive review on iTunes or any other type of site.

1799
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:35,500
Your dig.coms, your Yahoo podcasts, your podcast alley, hell, there's a million of them.

1800
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,340
Spread the love.

1801
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:41,820
So thank you guys again and we'll see you next week with more Orange Lounge Radio.
