3
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:19,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,686 --> 00:00:22,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:22,327 --> 00:00:25,749
[SPEAKER_11]: We are live on this Sunday evening, September the 2nd of 2007.

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy Labor Day weekend to those of you guys that are in the States.

7
00:00:28,871 --> 00:00:33,554
[SPEAKER_11]: To those of you guys that aren't in the States, well, happy weekend and happy Monday and hope your week is pretty cool.

8
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow, we're going to get right back into the gaming news this week.

9
00:00:36,576 --> 00:00:38,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Sadly, DarkSakura is not here this week.

10
00:00:39,178 --> 00:00:40,779
[SPEAKER_11]: Labor Day weekend just happens to be her anniversary.

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,122
[SPEAKER_11]: I think she planned it that way so she could have a three-day weekend off every year, but oh well.

12
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:49,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Regardless, she's not here tonight, unfortunately, but we're still here going over the gaming news.

13
00:00:50,313 --> 00:00:54,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Shane is here filling in, although he's doing a terrible job because he's just sitting here all night playing PSP.

14
00:00:55,498 --> 00:00:57,700
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have a computer to look at everybody.

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, because your Mac is being used now for the Operator 11 thing.

16
00:01:01,563 --> 00:01:06,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the thing you can look forward to is that in 40 minutes, the Operator 11 thing cuts off, so then you can use that again.

17
00:01:06,848 --> 00:01:07,748
[SPEAKER_11]: So, there you go.

18
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:08,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Hooray.

19
00:01:08,949 --> 00:01:10,371
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's get back into the gaming news.

20
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:10,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

21
00:01:11,582 --> 00:01:14,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.

22
00:01:14,144 --> 00:01:15,325
[SPEAKER_07]: We know it's coming out this year.

23
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:16,406
[SPEAKER_07]: We know it looks pretty good.

24
00:01:17,547 --> 00:01:19,528
[SPEAKER_07]: What we didn't know is what exactly had in it.

25
00:01:19,628 --> 00:01:30,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, now they're promising that it's going to feature more than 40 cars, tracks with reverse and alternate routes, and Gran Turismo TV, an online video channel for the PlayStation Network.

26
00:01:31,598 --> 00:01:40,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, we found out that it's going to be available online for purchase, and it's also going to be available via Blu-ray, just like Warhawk.

27
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:49,630
[SPEAKER_07]: to which I say, why don't you just finish Gran Turismo 5 instead of releasing these half games and charging people money for them?

28
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, stop making demos for Gran Turismo 5 and work on the damn game.

29
00:01:54,976 --> 00:01:58,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Why aren't they trying to give people a reason to keep a lookout for the PlayStation 3?

30
00:01:59,972 --> 00:02:00,933
[SPEAKER_07]: GS68 says, Gran Turismo Forever

31
00:02:24,514 --> 00:02:26,155
[SPEAKER_11]: and DarkTetsuya says, I don't know, Loki.

32
00:02:26,475 --> 00:02:29,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Gran Turismo demos are usually more packed than most full-blown racing games.

33
00:02:29,857 --> 00:02:31,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but this one you have to pay for.

34
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Those comments are coming from our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

35
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,641
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a problem with Gran Turismo HD, which is free, but...

36
00:02:38,348 --> 00:02:38,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

37
00:02:38,548 --> 00:02:38,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

38
00:02:38,688 --> 00:02:38,988
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

39
00:03:03,956 --> 00:03:06,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I know Loki has no problem with this.

40
00:03:06,358 --> 00:03:11,202
[SPEAKER_11]: SingStar on the PlayStation 2, because Loki loves his karaoke PS2 games, right?

41
00:03:11,282 --> 00:03:11,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

42
00:03:12,003 --> 00:03:12,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

43
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Totally.

44
00:03:13,264 --> 00:03:15,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there's actually a SingStar pack.

45
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't tell the wife about this one, or she's going to want you to buy this.

46
00:03:17,307 --> 00:03:17,907
[SPEAKER_11]: She doesn't care.

47
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:18,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay, good.

48
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:19,949
[SPEAKER_11]: Why doesn't she care?

49
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:21,090
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought she loved karaoke games.

50
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I'm not going to buy them.

51
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:23,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

52
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:24,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you affirm that?

53
00:03:25,313 --> 00:03:26,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you tell the wife you didn't want to buy them?

54
00:03:26,675 --> 00:03:31,138
[SPEAKER_07]: I told her I wouldn't buy them, and I told her that there was this coming out, and she's like, so?

55
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:31,799
[SPEAKER_11]: So what?

56
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:34,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I will not touch the singing portion of Rock Band

57
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:53,104
[SPEAKER_11]: All we have to do is to, one night when you don't drive, we have to get you to drink a little bit and then you'll be good.

58
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:55,745
[SPEAKER_11]: You, okay, you were at my bachelor party.

59
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:57,826
[SPEAKER_11]: I was near, like, alcohol poisoning.

60
00:03:57,846 --> 00:03:59,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Which, by the way, is on YouTube.

61
00:03:59,347 --> 00:04:03,029
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to see Loki driving Mario Kart drunk, just search for Orange Lounge Radio.

62
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:03,389
[SPEAKER_07]: It's there.

63
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:08,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Too bad we didn't have the rest of the stuff on there, like me playing miniature golf, but I still have the videos.

64
00:04:08,371 --> 00:04:10,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I still have the videos for that.

65
00:04:10,512 --> 00:04:14,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, though, but yeah, I was, you know, pretty sick and frustrated

66
00:04:14,574 --> 00:04:15,415
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

67
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:41,706
[SPEAKER_11]: It's $150 US and it's coming out with SingStar.

68
00:04:41,746 --> 00:04:43,367
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to figure out which version of SingStar it is.

69
00:04:43,387 --> 00:04:52,513
[SPEAKER_11]: SingStar Pop is coming out in November and it's going to be a white PlayStation 2 to perfectly match your Wii if you are so inclined.

70
00:04:53,013 --> 00:04:54,855
[SPEAKER_11]: So enjoy that.

71
00:04:55,135 --> 00:04:56,296
[SPEAKER_11]: $150, not a bad deal for those two games.

72
00:04:56,636 --> 00:05:00,278
[SPEAKER_11]: It also, by the way, comes with a controller, a white controller, and two microphones.

73
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,900
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're all set for a karaoke party with this.

74
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:04,975
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're a SingStar fan.

75
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:09,418
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I know some people prefer Karaoke Revolution, but it really isn't at all the same game in the end.

76
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:12,079
[SPEAKER_11]: It's people making asses of themselves in front of their friends, right?

77
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:12,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

78
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:13,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

79
00:05:14,221 --> 00:05:32,392
[SPEAKER_07]: We touched on this a little bit in Part A with the whole Manhunt 2 being re-rated thing, but Cinder Yee, Leland Yee from California, is actually on the record saying that he favors the adults-only rating and wishes that they allowed those to be played on consoles.

80
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:33,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

81
00:05:33,795 --> 00:05:34,915
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

82
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:05,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

83
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:48,980
[SPEAKER_11]: It is kind of interesting that he supports, you know, the guy's been branded as this, you know, anti-video games guy, but I find it very interesting that he is, you know, actually supportive of, okay, the content can be out there, you know, I don't care if the AO content is out there, and in fact, we should have a place for it, but just not falling in children's laps or whatever.

84
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,402
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to police it so that it doesn't get in children's laps.

85
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:55,344
[SPEAKER_07]: He basically says, you know, it's the use of the ambiguous term mature that

86
00:06:55,612 --> 00:06:56,132
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

87
00:07:15,954 --> 00:07:24,323
[SPEAKER_11]: They say whoever's going to win the HD, DVD, and Blu-ray war is going to be whatever system gets the most porn, is going to be what decides that war.

88
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:35,074
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, we're not banning adult DVDs out there, and I would think that that's a lot easier for kids to get a hold of than adult games.

89
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:38,878
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, but they need to get past the point that games are not just...

90
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:41,066
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

91
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:04,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

92
00:08:17,273 --> 00:08:18,414
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

93
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:43,091
[SPEAKER_11]: All of the monsters.

94
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:43,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

95
00:09:03,817 --> 00:09:05,379
[SPEAKER_11]: The nurses are the nurses from the movie, like, full on.

96
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,232
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

97
00:09:45,529 --> 00:10:12,829
[SPEAKER_11]: That cried when she was fighting one of the boss monsters in Silent Hill 3 I can't wait to get her to play this game because I'm evil and vindictive And I think it's going to be hilarious when the monsters start kicking down doors to get to her Yeah, she'll throw the controller down and run into a different room and cry And hopefully we'll have it all up on one of these video streaming sites for you to enjoy What you guys don't get about our friend though is like I'll go and pretend I'm one of the monsters I won't be dressed up or anything, I'll just walk like they were And she hates it and freaks out

98
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,399
[SPEAKER_11]: So good.

99
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Picaruno agrees.

100
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:18,483
[SPEAKER_11]: I get so scared I can't even play Silent Hill.

101
00:10:18,723 --> 00:10:26,970
[SPEAKER_05]: The first Silent Hill, I'm sure I've mentioned this before, but when I tried to play it, I stopped it nine times at the very beginning because it was too scary.

102
00:10:27,551 --> 00:10:28,912
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just how great these games are.

103
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:29,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

104
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:31,134
[SPEAKER_11]: That's cool.

105
00:10:32,075 --> 00:10:34,977
[SPEAKER_11]: As Dartichia in our chatroom says, what a horrible night to have a curse.

106
00:10:35,477 --> 00:10:36,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Ha ha ha.

107
00:10:36,238 --> 00:10:36,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Funny.

108
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's a Castlevania reference.

109
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Never mind.

110
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:40,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even get it.

111
00:10:40,922 --> 00:10:41,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Forget it.

112
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:41,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Ugh.

113
00:10:43,134 --> 00:10:44,414
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I have to say on Silent Hill.

114
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:45,735
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm definitely looking forward to Silent Hill 5.

115
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:46,815
[SPEAKER_11]: I looked at the same article too.

116
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,355
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like it's going to be pretty sweet.

117
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:56,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, let me ask real quick, Shane, since you're such a big fan of the series from before, are you looking forward to this?

118
00:10:56,317 --> 00:11:03,059
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that you were a little nervous when you heard it was going to a different developer and it's being developed outside Japan, but seeing kind of what they've done with it, are you looking forward to it?

119
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you still a little nervous or what?

120
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:05,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still nervous.

121
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:11,421
[SPEAKER_05]: The screenshots are good looking, but that doesn't tell you how the game plays or if the story is really good or

122
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:22,019
[SPEAKER_05]: If they have the elements that make it Silent Hill in the game or not, it could just be like, I don't know, they could have made a really nice looking, what's that crappy game called?

123
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:28,543
[SPEAKER_05]: The one where you were all the teenagers in the school and all the plant monsters were obscure or something like that.

124
00:11:29,284 --> 00:11:30,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you shaking your head at me a lot?

125
00:11:30,805 --> 00:11:33,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing, I'm just... Oh, yeah, it could be like that.

126
00:11:33,788 --> 00:11:36,550
[SPEAKER_05]: That could look really pretty, but it could be a terrible game like that game was.

127
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:37,551
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

128
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:41,915
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope, but... Maybe the liquor is just starting to kick in, so I'm just nodding a little more than usual.

129
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:42,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

130
00:11:43,376 --> 00:11:43,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

131
00:11:44,077 --> 00:11:44,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

132
00:11:44,877 --> 00:11:45,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

133
00:11:45,398 --> 00:11:45,758
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

134
00:11:46,358 --> 00:11:46,879
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm done.

135
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:47,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Next story.

136
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:55,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Anywho, so one game I'm not too excited about, LocoRoco for the PS3.

137
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:57,148
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been dated for...

138
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Release in Japan on the PlayStation Network September 21st.

139
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:04,754
[SPEAKER_07]: And no price is announced yet.

140
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:14,201
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, um, looks like Odeo Loco Roco Boo Boo Coco Reco or something.

141
00:12:14,221 --> 00:12:14,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

142
00:12:15,122 --> 00:12:22,607
[SPEAKER_09]: All you need to know is that it's... Wait, Loco Roco Boo Goo Coco for Coco Puff Roco Boco is what it is.

143
00:12:23,038 --> 00:12:32,865
[SPEAKER_07]: What it probably means is, ha ha, they don't know that it's just an interactive screensaver, you fucktards, and you're going to pay money for this, thinking it's a real game, and ha ha, we screw you over again.

144
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,829
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's exactly... Roco, Roco, Cuckoo, Boco, fucktard.

145
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that it?

146
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, the game is an interactive screensaver.

147
00:12:42,232 --> 00:12:48,377
[SPEAKER_07]: You will be able to use the six axis to tilt the little crocos around, but that's about it.

148
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:50,786
[SPEAKER_07]: So, hooray!

149
00:12:51,186 --> 00:12:54,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for yet another awesome game, Sony.

150
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:55,328
[SPEAKER_11]: You rock.

151
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:57,629
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think LocoRoco just jumped the shark with this?

152
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:05,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's just, why even bother calling this a game or even have to purchase it if it's, you know...

153
00:13:07,082 --> 00:13:07,782
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

154
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:38,803
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a nice day, but enjoy the dirt demo.

155
00:13:38,863 --> 00:13:41,566
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a pretty looking game, but I couldn't control it at all.

156
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:43,307
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's just not my kind of racing game.

157
00:13:43,487 --> 00:13:44,868
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just me, I guess.

158
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:54,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, one other game that you probably won't see over in the UK also is being developed by Homeland Security in the US.

159
00:13:55,157 --> 00:14:03,804
[SPEAKER_07]: They are developing a game, of course, I guess, I don't know, something where you, of course, defending the United States from terrorists.

160
00:14:04,264 --> 00:14:05,125
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've spent...

161
00:14:05,972 --> 00:14:07,397
[SPEAKER_07]: $600,000 of funding Ground Truth

162
00:14:11,491 --> 00:14:17,133
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a game that would, I guess, cast players in the first responders to a terrorist attack or natural disasters.

163
00:14:17,693 --> 00:14:24,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Homeland Security, for spending our money on a game instead of protecting the homeland.

164
00:14:24,535 --> 00:14:27,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this a free download thing for PCs, or is this like a Flash game?

165
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,297
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell is this?

166
00:14:28,357 --> 00:14:29,617
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just something that's being developed.

167
00:14:29,657 --> 00:14:32,558
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not even done yet, so we don't know if it's going to be free or whatnot.

168
00:14:32,718 --> 00:14:33,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

169
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:35,679
[SPEAKER_11]: What do they hope to accomplish with a game like this, I wonder?

170
00:14:35,859 --> 00:14:38,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't it be funny if the terrorists played it instead?

171
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,121
[SPEAKER_07]: It would probably be to build on the...

172
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:47,914
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I don't know, build on the success that, say, America's Army had?

173
00:14:48,475 --> 00:14:52,998
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just thinking of America's Army, and even Jonathan F. in our chatroom says America's Army was free.

174
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:56,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Dark Tetsuya says Shane went there.

175
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,941
[SPEAKER_05]: How did I not go there, seriously?

176
00:14:58,961 --> 00:15:05,926
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess the game is being developed by Sandia National Labs with grad students from University of Southern California doing the graphics work.

177
00:15:07,627 --> 00:15:08,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

178
00:15:08,428 --> 00:15:08,728
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

179
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:13,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop spending government money on this crap, seriously.

180
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:14,972
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need a fucking game.

181
00:15:15,272 --> 00:15:18,133
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't see the Department of Transportation saying, we want a game.

182
00:15:18,813 --> 00:15:20,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, you know, God knows what else.

183
00:15:21,594 --> 00:15:24,735
[SPEAKER_07]: They should have like a Bush PR campaign game or something.

184
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:27,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting point from Escapist in our chatroom.

185
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:34,478
[SPEAKER_11]: That may seem like an expensive game to make, but keep in mind King's Quest cost $700,000 when it first came out all those years ago.

186
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:36,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm.

187
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:37,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, great.

188
00:15:37,248 --> 00:15:42,949
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're going to waste a lot of money building this game and it's going to suck.

189
00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:44,230
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

190
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:47,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, you're not trying to say King's Quest sucks, does it?

191
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Because King's Quest is one of the greatest games ever made.

192
00:15:48,971 --> 00:15:50,471
[SPEAKER_07]: King's Quest is fucking old.

193
00:15:50,611 --> 00:15:52,932
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's old, but it's great.

194
00:15:53,272 --> 00:15:57,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, back in the day, $700,000 was probably a lot of money.

195
00:15:57,413 --> 00:16:04,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Nowadays, production costs have gone up due to the wonderful systems and graphics that we have and have come to love.

196
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:04,374
[SPEAKER_07]: So,

197
00:16:05,413 --> 00:16:08,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Back in the day, it was EGA graphics.

198
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,026
[SPEAKER_07]: All fucking 16 colors of wonderful goodness.

199
00:16:13,748 --> 00:16:13,948
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

200
00:16:14,795 --> 00:16:17,076
[SPEAKER_11]: The Virginia Tech Massacre Review Panel has released their report.

201
00:16:39,586 --> 00:16:55,509
[SPEAKER_11]: and it does show that there is no link between video games and the murders that were committed by the culprit actually the only game that is even mentioned in the report is Sonic the Hedgehog now I would fail to see where Sonic the Hedgehog is going to provoke violent gaming

202
00:16:56,362 --> 00:17:04,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless he went and played the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 version of the game, which the controls were horrible and could drive someone to kill people.

203
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, there was in the report, quote, So this is a big screw you to all those people that were so quick to...

204
00:17:19,384 --> 00:17:21,026
[SPEAKER_11]: to blame video games when this happened.

205
00:17:21,426 --> 00:17:26,570
[SPEAKER_11]: So the Jack Voldemorts of the world and Dr. Phil's and so on.

206
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:30,473
[SPEAKER_11]: So to you folks, we dedicate a very special segment this week to you.

207
00:17:41,262 --> 00:17:42,483
[SPEAKER_11]: It's our FUs of the week.

208
00:17:43,444 --> 00:17:45,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, why don't you start us off with your FU of the week?

209
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:48,623
[SPEAKER_07]: My FU of the week goes to the Lifetime channel.

210
00:17:48,783 --> 00:17:52,245
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like you, and I don't see the point.

211
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:55,327
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it?

212
00:17:56,668 --> 00:18:02,152
[SPEAKER_07]: And to the director of that stupid movie that I had to watch today, learn how to light a fucking movie.

213
00:18:02,552 --> 00:18:06,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise you're going to be stuck making shit on Lifetime.

214
00:18:07,075 --> 00:18:11,959
[SPEAKER_11]: First off, I'd like to give an FU to Loki for not enjoying the greatness of his Lifetime movies, because I love Lifetime movies.

215
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:15,281
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd also like to give an FU to Getting Sick.

216
00:18:16,149 --> 00:18:23,334
[SPEAKER_11]: When I was traveling this week, the only thing worse than having to travel and be gone for four days is getting sick while you're gone and bringing that back with you.

217
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:24,535
[SPEAKER_11]: That really stinks.

218
00:18:26,536 --> 00:18:27,277
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I guess that's it.

219
00:18:27,297 --> 00:18:30,559
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't really think of anything else this week, so that's all my FUs.

220
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Shane, Miklatov, whatever your name is, any FUs?

221
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:33,841
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

222
00:18:35,122 --> 00:18:35,342
[SPEAKER_11]: No?

223
00:18:35,923 --> 00:18:37,144
[SPEAKER_11]: You're happy about everything?

224
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:39,665
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but I can't think of anything to give a FU to.

225
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:40,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything's perfect?

226
00:18:40,646 --> 00:18:41,747
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not angry at anything?

227
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:43,168
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

228
00:18:43,544 --> 00:18:45,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, F you to you being so darn mellow.

229
00:18:45,785 --> 00:18:46,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wait, wait, wait.

230
00:18:46,946 --> 00:18:49,488
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to Blue Dragon because it sucks.

231
00:18:50,228 --> 00:18:50,688
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.

232
00:18:51,149 --> 00:18:51,829
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to you.

233
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:54,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you even know why you hate Blue Dragon?

234
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:54,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

235
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:54,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

236
00:18:54,651 --> 00:18:56,212
[SPEAKER_05]: The combat is boring.

237
00:18:56,412 --> 00:18:57,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Combat is awesome.

238
00:18:57,132 --> 00:18:58,453
[SPEAKER_11]: The game is dull looking.

239
00:18:58,533 --> 00:18:59,053
[SPEAKER_05]: You're dull looking.

240
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:04,777
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like a generic RPG that could have been made by any company ever.

241
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:12,101
[SPEAKER_11]: That I actually, you know, unfortunately there's not a lot that sets this apart from another RPG except for the fact it's on the 360 and it's pretty.

242
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,191
[SPEAKER_11]: The character models even look pretty bland.

243
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:16,152
[SPEAKER_11]: The music's good.

244
00:19:16,852 --> 00:19:19,632
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because those boss fights have terrible, terrible songs.

245
00:19:19,652 --> 00:19:20,912
[SPEAKER_06]: The boss fight song's awesome.

246
00:19:21,092 --> 00:19:21,493
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

247
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:23,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Worst game.

248
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,313
[SPEAKER_11]: The boss fight song is a vocal rock song, which is pretty rad.

249
00:19:26,473 --> 00:19:28,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't listen to what Shane says.

250
00:19:28,314 --> 00:19:29,694
[SPEAKER_05]: No, listen to what I say.

251
00:19:29,914 --> 00:19:30,254
[SPEAKER_11]: No, don't.

252
00:19:30,514 --> 00:19:31,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, back to the news.

253
00:19:32,014 --> 00:19:40,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, Castlevania, the wonderful game that's going to become a movie, yay, is now being completely rewritten.

254
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:44,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they've thrown out the script and are going back to the drawing boards.

255
00:20:11,593 --> 00:20:13,815
[SPEAKER_07]: because that's super awesome and I know you wouldn't miss it.

256
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,278
[SPEAKER_07]: And so he's working on the script now.

257
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:31,049
[SPEAKER_07]: His take on it, I guess, and of course the new director, Sylvan White, says, I was attracted by the chance to make a dark, epic period movie that almost has an anime feel to it.

258
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:37,815
[SPEAKER_07]: So... Let's hope and pray that it doesn't suck.

259
00:20:38,255 --> 00:20:39,116
[SPEAKER_07]: And unfortunately...

260
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:48,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Passed track records of moving games have not been... My magic 8-ball says, signs do not look good.

261
00:20:49,577 --> 00:20:50,177
[SPEAKER_11]: Does not look good.

262
00:20:50,878 --> 00:20:52,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, comment from the chatroom here.

263
00:20:52,738 --> 00:20:54,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you like the band Deep Purple?

264
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:56,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you familiar with the band at all?

265
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:56,700
[SPEAKER_11]: Deep Purple?

266
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,601
[SPEAKER_11]: The one that did Smoke on the Water?

267
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:00,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no, actually, I gotta ask Shane this.

268
00:21:01,062 --> 00:21:02,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know the band Deep Purple?

269
00:21:03,223 --> 00:21:05,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, because Smoke on the Water.

270
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:09,225
[SPEAKER_11]: The lead singer of Deep Purple is the guy that sings the song in Blue Dragon.

271
00:21:09,345 --> 00:21:10,906
[SPEAKER_05]: No wonder it sounds bad.

272
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:12,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Press Start

273
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:36,827
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a documentary, however.

274
00:21:37,687 --> 00:21:40,888
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a quote from the little synopsis of the movie.

275
00:21:41,428 --> 00:21:47,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Zach Nimbus is a typical suburban youth and volunteer monster exterminator living peacefully in a video game world.

276
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:56,533
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a realm where people actually do cross rivers by jumping across alligators' heads or being chomped to death in the attempt, and where injuries can be cured by eating food laying around in old hallways.

277
00:21:56,993 --> 00:22:04,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Here, the pleasant days are ending due to world conquest by the unspeakably evil but insecure and telephone-addicted wizard Count Nefarious Vile.

278
00:22:05,427 --> 00:22:26,356
[SPEAKER_11]: Zaxxum finds himself recruited by battle-hardened space soldier Sam and enthusiastically bad-tempered ninja Lin Ku I'm thinking they're supposed to be like Samus, but they can't use the exact names to join a last desperate attempt to thwart Vile's imminent victory but not before lampooning every video game convention that comes in their way

279
00:22:26,796 --> 00:22:32,417
[SPEAKER_11]: So apparently this is going to be some type of little live action movie that parodies all these other video games.

280
00:22:32,657 --> 00:22:33,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing, though.

281
00:22:33,357 --> 00:22:38,878
[SPEAKER_11]: If you think this is like some huge production that's putting this out, this movie looks like it cost about $20 to make.

282
00:22:39,218 --> 00:22:41,059
[SPEAKER_11]: So don't be expecting a big budget production.

283
00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:43,799
[SPEAKER_11]: But, hey, you know, just because it has no budget doesn't mean it can't be good.

284
00:22:43,999 --> 00:22:47,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Coming to a senior project presentation near you.

285
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:47,860
[SPEAKER_11]: For real.

286
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Or it's like one of those Lionsgate little films direct to video or something.

287
00:22:53,811 --> 00:22:55,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Film Class Final near you.

288
00:22:55,612 --> 00:22:56,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Direct to VHS.

289
00:22:56,733 --> 00:22:57,713
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not even coming out on DVD.

290
00:22:57,733 --> 00:23:00,814
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to have to peddle this crap later on.

291
00:23:00,874 --> 00:23:01,274
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it.

292
00:23:01,474 --> 00:23:04,716
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a trailer available, by the way, which you can watch on YouTube.

293
00:23:04,736 --> 00:23:07,917
[SPEAKER_11]: If you just look for Press Start the Movie, there's actually a trailer.

294
00:23:08,077 --> 00:23:11,279
[SPEAKER_11]: We're actually looking at it in the studio right now if you want to kind of check this out here.

295
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:16,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you mind telling me what you were doing with these?

296
00:23:19,582 --> 00:23:21,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget what I did to you.

297
00:23:24,304 --> 00:23:25,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Your brother.

298
00:23:28,585 --> 00:23:34,687
[SPEAKER_02]: In a world ruled by an evil sorcerer, two rebels seek a hero.

299
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:36,328
[SPEAKER_08]: It's dangerous to go out alone.

300
00:23:36,668 --> 00:23:37,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Take this.

301
00:23:37,568 --> 00:23:40,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Foretold by an ancient prophecy.

302
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:42,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Whose ancient prophecy?

303
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,530
[SPEAKER_05]: An ancient prophet's.

304
00:23:47,811 --> 00:23:49,712
[SPEAKER_08]: This looks like that Cheerleader Ninjas movie.

305
00:23:49,912 --> 00:23:50,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, right.

306
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,486
[SPEAKER_08]: I love LARPing, let's make it into a movie!

307
00:23:53,526 --> 00:23:56,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Heads up, guys!

308
00:23:56,948 --> 00:23:57,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Why'd you let him hit you?

309
00:23:58,269 --> 00:23:58,949
[SPEAKER_02]: It was his turn.

310
00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:01,630
[SPEAKER_02]: On September 25th... Batten down the hatches!

311
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Rile up the mechanical dinosaurs!

312
00:24:03,911 --> 00:24:04,952
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't be a game.

313
00:24:05,692 --> 00:24:07,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations, you've just leveled up.

314
00:24:08,334 --> 00:24:09,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's a movie.

315
00:24:09,934 --> 00:24:14,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see the graphics on that tree thing there?

316
00:24:14,697 --> 00:24:15,817
[SPEAKER_05]: That was crazy.

317
00:24:16,457 --> 00:24:19,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Those fools have no idea what horrors await them!

318
00:24:21,454 --> 00:24:22,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

319
00:24:47,114 --> 00:24:48,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's working.

320
00:24:48,355 --> 00:24:51,577
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked about it on our program, and it was on a lot of major game blogs.

321
00:24:51,597 --> 00:24:56,201
[SPEAKER_05]: There was that funny part in the thing, though, about that it was his turn to attack.

322
00:24:56,221 --> 00:24:56,601
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.

323
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:57,522
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was like an RPG.

324
00:24:57,542 --> 00:24:58,362
[SPEAKER_11]: That was funny.

325
00:24:59,783 --> 00:25:03,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, if you could sit through that Cheerleader Ninjas, I'm sure you could make it through this movie, Loki.

326
00:25:03,186 --> 00:25:05,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheerleader Ninjas had nudity in it.

327
00:25:05,948 --> 00:25:06,408
[SPEAKER_05]: This might.

328
00:25:06,428 --> 00:25:07,009
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.

329
00:25:07,069 --> 00:25:08,229
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's true.

330
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:09,490
[SPEAKER_11]: There could be nudity in this movie.

331
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Direct-to-DVD.

332
00:25:10,491 --> 00:25:12,132
[SPEAKER_11]: For artistic purposes.

333
00:25:12,693 --> 00:25:14,434
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they don't have the budget for nudity.

334
00:25:15,865 --> 00:25:17,507
[SPEAKER_07]: And would you really want to see any of them naked?

335
00:25:17,687 --> 00:25:18,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

336
00:25:18,128 --> 00:25:18,588
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

337
00:25:19,189 --> 00:25:24,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow, what we're going to do is we're going to open up the Skype line because it's time to play Beat the Host.

338
00:25:31,524 --> 00:25:33,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I love that song.

339
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:34,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just listen to that.

340
00:25:57,732 --> 00:25:58,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

341
00:25:58,393 --> 00:26:01,235
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to take our first call on the Skype line.

342
00:26:01,255 --> 00:26:05,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, our username is Orange Launch Radio or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

343
00:26:05,218 --> 00:26:05,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

344
00:26:05,518 --> 00:26:06,018
[SPEAKER_11]: We got a call.

345
00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:08,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, who's this?

346
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,340
[SPEAKER_05]: That always gets through.

347
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:10,241
[SPEAKER_11]: GS68.

348
00:26:10,381 --> 00:26:11,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, GS68.

349
00:26:11,382 --> 00:26:12,523
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's not Raven's Dolphin tonight.

350
00:26:12,563 --> 00:26:13,003
[SPEAKER_11]: It's GS68.

351
00:26:13,043 --> 00:26:13,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, GS68.

352
00:26:13,603 --> 00:26:14,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray.

353
00:26:14,524 --> 00:26:15,505
[SPEAKER_11]: How you doing, GS68?

354
00:26:15,945 --> 00:26:16,305
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

355
00:26:16,906 --> 00:26:18,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you ready to play some Beat the Host tonight?

356
00:26:19,668 --> 00:26:19,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

357
00:26:20,168 --> 00:26:20,408
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

358
00:26:20,428 --> 00:26:20,888
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll give it a shot.

359
00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:25,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, how would you say your knowledge of old school or new school video game music is?

360
00:26:27,989 --> 00:26:28,349
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

361
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:32,552
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you sound very enthusiastic about your chances in tonight's Beat the Host.

362
00:26:33,452 --> 00:26:33,752
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

363
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight you can challenge to beat the host.

364
00:26:36,274 --> 00:26:40,197
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to let you play against Shane because he already kind of knows what's going on tonight.

365
00:26:41,137 --> 00:26:43,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but I never get to play.

366
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:44,620
[SPEAKER_05]: He's just going to pick Matt.

367
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody picks Matt anyway.

368
00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:47,862
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not even like they have to ask.

369
00:26:47,942 --> 00:26:49,923
[SPEAKER_11]: If I let you pick, you'd probably pick Matt, wouldn't you?

370
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:54,086
[SPEAKER_11]: What would be wrong with challenging you?

371
00:26:55,223 --> 00:26:56,940
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't challenge me because I wrote the questions.

372
00:26:57,492 --> 00:26:59,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Video Game Music Songs Being Played Backwards

373
00:27:25,407 --> 00:27:25,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay?

374
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:26,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, God.

375
00:27:26,908 --> 00:27:35,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, these could be songs anywhere from an 8-bit Atari era all the way through new school Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 games.

376
00:27:35,431 --> 00:27:35,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay?

377
00:27:36,211 --> 00:27:39,993
[SPEAKER_11]: If things drag on, I will give you guys hints to help you guess the game.

378
00:27:40,053 --> 00:27:41,354
[SPEAKER_11]: First one to get it gets the point.

379
00:27:41,654 --> 00:27:41,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright?

380
00:27:41,934 --> 00:27:42,694
[SPEAKER_11]: So you guys know how to play?

381
00:27:42,714 --> 00:27:43,915
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm ready.

382
00:27:44,135 --> 00:27:45,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so you guys are going to go at the same time.

383
00:27:45,935 --> 00:27:49,657
[SPEAKER_11]: GS68, make sure you yell out your answers nice and loud so I can hear you over the music, okay?

384
00:27:50,296 --> 00:27:51,517
[SPEAKER_11]: It has to leave the chat room, right?

385
00:27:51,657 --> 00:27:55,779
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you do need to leave the chat room, or else people are going to help you cheat, and we can't have that.

386
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:56,919
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

387
00:27:56,939 --> 00:27:57,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay?

388
00:27:57,859 --> 00:27:58,120
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

389
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:01,361
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

390
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:02,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Is he out of chat?

391
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:03,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, you left the chat room, GS68?

392
00:28:03,942 --> 00:28:04,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

393
00:28:05,063 --> 00:28:07,284
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, now remember, you don't have to send me a private message or anything.

394
00:28:07,324 --> 00:28:10,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Just yell it out when you know it, because you're up against Matt in real time, okay?

395
00:28:10,325 --> 00:28:11,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

396
00:28:11,205 --> 00:28:12,326
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to keep score here.

397
00:28:13,618 --> 00:28:14,578
[SPEAKER_11]: There should be buzzers.

398
00:28:15,018 --> 00:28:16,379
[SPEAKER_11]: There should be, but we don't have any.

399
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,339
[SPEAKER_11]: We're a low-budget production.

400
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:18,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, here we go.

401
00:28:19,219 --> 00:28:22,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's song number one, and the first one that gets it gets a point.

402
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,600
[SPEAKER_11]: And remember, these are being played backwards.

403
00:28:25,701 --> 00:28:25,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

404
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:37,663
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that, GS68?

405
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,904
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard this on the Olar stream, but I can't put my finger on it.

406
00:28:40,924 --> 00:28:41,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep going.

407
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:47,438
[SPEAKER_11]: This game was on the Dreamcast.

408
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,851
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, it sounded like a song from Lupin the Third.

409
00:29:14,151 --> 00:29:14,591
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

410
00:29:14,651 --> 00:29:16,112
[SPEAKER_11]: See, it's kind of along the same lines.

411
00:29:16,132 --> 00:29:16,532
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

412
00:29:16,552 --> 00:29:21,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Loki has a point, but GS68, there's ten songs tonight, so all is not lost.

413
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:22,035
[SPEAKER_11]: You ready for song number two?

414
00:29:22,735 --> 00:29:22,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

415
00:29:22,855 --> 00:29:23,236
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

416
00:29:23,256 --> 00:29:23,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.

417
00:29:28,858 --> 00:29:29,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Animal Crossing.

418
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:30,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh!

419
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki's on fire!

420
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,541
[SPEAKER_11]: GS68, did you even hear any of that?

421
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:37,500
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, couldn't recognize it.

422
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,662
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Animal Crossing, the little drum tap, little quiet stuff.

423
00:29:40,702 --> 00:29:41,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it was Animal Crossing.

424
00:29:41,683 --> 00:29:42,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job, Loki.

425
00:29:42,944 --> 00:29:43,784
[SPEAKER_11]: Played the game way too much.

426
00:29:43,804 --> 00:29:44,625
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, here we go.

427
00:29:44,665 --> 00:29:45,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's another one.

428
00:29:45,245 --> 00:29:47,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, these could be from any system, new school or old school.

429
00:29:48,227 --> 00:29:48,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

430
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:49,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's number three.

431
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:53,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Luminous.

432
00:29:55,812 --> 00:29:58,854
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, GS68 knew that one, too.

433
00:29:59,615 --> 00:29:59,935
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

434
00:29:59,955 --> 00:30:01,336
[SPEAKER_11]: That was Shinin' from Luminous.

435
00:30:01,897 --> 00:30:02,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn, Loki, you're on fire.

436
00:30:02,738 --> 00:30:04,319
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounded so evil backwards.

437
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,219
[SPEAKER_05]: It did sound like it.

438
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,181
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to hear a little more?

439
00:30:07,201 --> 00:30:12,844
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to hear a little more?

440
00:30:12,885 --> 00:30:13,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it backwards.

441
00:30:15,126 --> 00:30:16,927
[SPEAKER_05]: I want an MP3 of it backwards now.

442
00:30:17,288 --> 00:30:19,029
[SPEAKER_11]: I can send you an MP3 of it backwards if you want.

443
00:30:19,209 --> 00:30:19,869
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be cool.

444
00:30:19,989 --> 00:30:20,370
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

445
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,531
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, GS68, it's 3-0.

446
00:30:22,671 --> 00:30:24,532
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

447
00:30:24,592 --> 00:30:26,234
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to make some progress here, okay?

448
00:30:26,954 --> 00:30:27,194
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

449
00:30:27,935 --> 00:30:28,755
[SPEAKER_11]: We're pulling for you, though.

450
00:30:28,795 --> 00:30:29,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

451
00:30:29,956 --> 00:30:30,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's number four.

452
00:30:30,597 --> 00:30:30,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Ready?

453
00:30:30,937 --> 00:30:31,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Ready?

454
00:30:46,829 --> 00:30:47,930
[SPEAKER_11]: This game was on the NES.

455
00:30:49,671 --> 00:30:50,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Master Master?

456
00:30:50,872 --> 00:30:51,032
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

457
00:30:51,412 --> 00:30:52,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Super Contra?

458
00:30:52,373 --> 00:30:52,553
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

459
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:53,374
[SPEAKER_11]: Contra?

460
00:30:53,734 --> 00:30:53,894
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

461
00:30:54,535 --> 00:30:55,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they a legend?

462
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:56,856
[SPEAKER_11]: What'd you say?

463
00:30:56,876 --> 00:30:58,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they a legend?

464
00:30:58,437 --> 00:30:59,218
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's not got any legends.

465
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:05,967
[SPEAKER_11]: This game had a character named Ryu.

466
00:31:07,868 --> 00:31:08,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Ninja Gaiden.

467
00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:09,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh!

468
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,030
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki got it.

469
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:14,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Needed a couple clues to get it, but it was Ninja Gaiden.

470
00:31:14,913 --> 00:31:15,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Stage 1 music.

471
00:31:17,214 --> 00:31:18,615
[SPEAKER_11]: GS68's not looking good.

472
00:31:20,116 --> 00:31:22,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry to say, but try to get some points on the board, okay?

473
00:31:22,397 --> 00:31:23,518
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all pulling for you, alright?

474
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:25,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

475
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:28,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, I'll bust Loki's kneecaps so he has a challenge in some of these later ones.

476
00:31:28,861 --> 00:31:29,281
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, you ready?

477
00:31:29,301 --> 00:31:30,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, here we go.

478
00:31:30,962 --> 00:31:31,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Here comes song number 5.

479
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:32,804
[SPEAKER_11]: You ready, GS68?

480
00:31:32,844 --> 00:31:32,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

481
00:31:34,096 --> 00:31:34,556
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do it.

482
00:31:39,801 --> 00:31:40,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Act Freezer.

483
00:31:40,502 --> 00:31:40,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Sonic!

484
00:31:41,122 --> 00:31:41,343
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

485
00:31:41,503 --> 00:31:41,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes!

486
00:31:42,739 --> 00:31:43,840
[SPEAKER_11]: GS68 got one.

487
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

488
00:31:45,342 --> 00:31:46,323
[SPEAKER_11]: What was it?

489
00:31:46,563 --> 00:31:48,244
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the roof came off his house.

490
00:31:48,284 --> 00:31:48,905
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Sonic.

491
00:31:49,706 --> 00:31:50,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's right.

492
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,149
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought he yelled a bad word.

493
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,812
[SPEAKER_11]: That is what you said, right, GS68?

494
00:31:56,392 --> 00:31:56,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

495
00:31:57,413 --> 00:32:04,860
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I heard, but he did it in that old... I think it was an allusion to the old Sega commercials when he yelled it out.

496
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Or he just really wanted to win.

497
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,032
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the bonus stage in Sonic.

498
00:32:10,293 --> 00:32:11,133
[SPEAKER_11]: The bonus stage music.

499
00:32:11,253 --> 00:32:12,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I recognize it now.

500
00:32:12,394 --> 00:32:12,634
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

501
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:13,614
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

502
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:14,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Good.

503
00:32:14,295 --> 00:32:15,836
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so glad to see you get on the board, GS68.

504
00:32:15,876 --> 00:32:16,296
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

505
00:32:16,316 --> 00:32:17,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go into the next question.

506
00:32:17,617 --> 00:32:20,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Question number six, I believe this one is.

507
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:20,779
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

508
00:32:24,421 --> 00:32:27,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Parappa the Rapper.

509
00:32:27,382 --> 00:32:27,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

510
00:32:28,203 --> 00:32:30,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Mere seconds splitting it up.

511
00:32:30,404 --> 00:32:33,306
[SPEAKER_11]: I could hear GS68 start to say it as Loki got it out.

512
00:32:33,346 --> 00:32:34,446
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Parappa the Rapper.

513
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:35,747
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

514
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,988
[SPEAKER_11]: This next one's a little bit tougher.

515
00:32:37,574 --> 00:32:38,554
[SPEAKER_11]: GS68, you ready?

516
00:32:40,515 --> 00:32:41,536
[SPEAKER_11]: Ready for the next one, GS68?

517
00:32:42,256 --> 00:32:42,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

518
00:32:42,736 --> 00:32:43,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, here we go.

519
00:32:44,977 --> 00:32:45,798
This is on the 360.

520
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:45,998
Crap.

521
00:33:08,647 --> 00:33:09,327
[SPEAKER_11]: and the PC.

522
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:12,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Not that one yet.

523
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:20,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, I guess.

524
00:33:20,754 --> 00:33:20,954
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

525
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:23,495
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a role-playing game.

526
00:33:25,616 --> 00:33:26,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XI?

527
00:33:26,777 --> 00:33:27,757
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

528
00:33:27,857 --> 00:33:28,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Oblivion.

529
00:33:28,598 --> 00:33:29,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, finally.

530
00:33:30,038 --> 00:33:30,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Jesus.

531
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:31,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

532
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:32,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Took long enough.

533
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it was Oblivion.

534
00:33:34,501 --> 00:33:34,781
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

535
00:33:36,584 --> 00:33:43,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it looks like Loki has six, so there's no possible way you're going to be able to win GS68, but keep playing just for the fun of it, okay?

536
00:33:43,407 --> 00:33:43,647
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

537
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:44,828
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we're going to get through the rest of this.

538
00:33:44,848 --> 00:33:45,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

539
00:33:45,468 --> 00:33:46,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Here comes the next one.

540
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:50,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Contra.

541
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:51,271
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

542
00:33:51,351 --> 00:33:52,191
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's Castlevania.

543
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:54,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Castlevania IV.

544
00:33:55,753 --> 00:33:56,333
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

545
00:33:57,234 --> 00:33:57,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Symphony of the Night.

546
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:58,894
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

547
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:01,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Castlevania III.

548
00:34:01,936 --> 00:34:02,336
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

549
00:34:02,396 --> 00:34:03,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Dracula X. GS68.

550
00:34:03,937 --> 00:34:03,977
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

551
00:34:05,851 --> 00:34:06,712
[SPEAKER_07]: He just gave up.

552
00:34:07,272 --> 00:34:08,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Castlevania 2 Science Quest.

553
00:34:08,994 --> 00:34:10,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Finally, Jesus Christ.

554
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:11,356
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to go through all of them.

555
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:18,102
[SPEAKER_11]: GS68, you should have jumped in there when his weak point was exposed for massive damage.

556
00:34:18,142 --> 00:34:19,823
[SPEAKER_11]: You could have jumped in there with number two.

557
00:34:19,883 --> 00:34:20,884
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't know it.

558
00:34:21,205 --> 00:34:21,545
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

559
00:34:22,786 --> 00:34:23,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

560
00:34:24,227 --> 00:34:25,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Here comes number nine.

561
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:28,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I'm going to say I think this was the hardest one in the whole bunch.

562
00:34:28,731 --> 00:34:30,713
[SPEAKER_11]: If either one of you can get this, props to you.

563
00:34:31,614 --> 00:34:31,794
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

564
00:34:43,564 --> 00:34:46,626
[SPEAKER_11]: This game was also on the 360 and PC.

565
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantasy Star Universe?

566
00:34:53,351 --> 00:34:53,571
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

567
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:56,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy 11?

568
00:34:58,174 --> 00:34:58,634
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that?

569
00:34:59,355 --> 00:35:00,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy 11?

570
00:35:00,275 --> 00:35:00,455
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

571
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:09,982
[SPEAKER_11]: This game was the same composer who did the music to Oblivion.

572
00:35:10,582 --> 00:35:10,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Blair?

573
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:10,882
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

574
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:11,663
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

575
00:35:18,632 --> 00:35:21,274
[SPEAKER_11]: The story of this game has to do with alien abduction.

576
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:25,256
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that, GS68?

577
00:35:25,296 --> 00:35:28,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say Alien Syndrome, but I forgot that's not on the PC.

578
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:29,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, God.

579
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,641
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the game, but I just can't think of the name.

580
00:35:32,982 --> 00:35:36,884
[SPEAKER_11]: This game is notable for featuring a Native American lead character.

581
00:35:37,725 --> 00:35:38,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Prey.

582
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:40,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, GS68, finally.

583
00:35:40,747 --> 00:35:41,707
[SPEAKER_07]: It was on the tip of my tongue.

584
00:35:41,928 --> 00:35:42,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it's Prey.

585
00:35:43,629 --> 00:35:44,689
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, good job.

586
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:46,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job, GS68.

587
00:35:46,571 --> 00:35:48,032
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew the game, I just couldn't think of the name.

588
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:48,532
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

589
00:35:49,724 --> 00:35:50,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's move on.

590
00:35:51,645 --> 00:35:52,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Ready for the last one, you guys?

591
00:35:53,346 --> 00:35:53,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

592
00:35:53,726 --> 00:35:54,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Here it is.

593
00:35:57,829 --> 00:35:58,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Chance and Revolution?

594
00:35:59,370 --> 00:35:59,870
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

595
00:36:01,631 --> 00:36:02,352
[SPEAKER_11]: That was Butterfly.

596
00:36:04,193 --> 00:36:04,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Loki.

597
00:36:05,073 --> 00:36:05,594
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

598
00:36:07,055 --> 00:36:10,897
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, GS68, you got smoked tonight, I'm sorry to say.

599
00:36:11,818 --> 00:36:12,938
[SPEAKER_11]: The score is 8-2.

600
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:15,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you just say GG?

601
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:16,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

602
00:36:16,861 --> 00:36:18,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, GG, Loki, GG.

603
00:36:20,293 --> 00:36:20,613
[SPEAKER_11]: GG.

604
00:36:20,853 --> 00:36:24,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm sorry, GS68, you lost tonight, but it's our consolation prize.

605
00:36:25,255 --> 00:36:27,876
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll give you a second to plug anything you want to plug real quick.

606
00:36:29,237 --> 00:36:31,058
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have anything to plug.

607
00:36:31,878 --> 00:36:32,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm sorry to hear it.

608
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:33,779
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

609
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:35,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thanks for playing anyway, GS68.

610
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,440
[SPEAKER_11]: We appreciate it.

611
00:36:37,221 --> 00:36:37,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob.

612
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:38,061
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

613
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:38,581
[SPEAKER_11]: Later, dude.

614
00:36:40,222 --> 00:36:40,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job, Loki.

615
00:36:41,823 --> 00:36:44,744
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, isn't that game unfair to the listener?

616
00:36:45,124 --> 00:36:45,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is that?

617
00:36:45,744 --> 00:36:46,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's a time delay.

618
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:47,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

619
00:36:47,726 --> 00:36:51,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, no, because when they're on Skype, it's still instantaneous.

620
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:52,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

621
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:58,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's only the time delay if they're listening over live 365, but they shouldn't be doing that when they're playing that.

622
00:36:59,389 --> 00:36:59,849
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

623
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking at chat and seeing what's going on.

624
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Zappy says, that was a hard beat to host tonight.

625
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:06,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Goldbanjo thinks the last one was easy.

626
00:37:06,971 --> 00:37:09,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if you're a DDR nerd, then the last one was easy, so there you go.

627
00:37:10,953 --> 00:37:12,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's get back into some gaming news.

628
00:37:12,453 --> 00:37:13,373
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it for Beat the Host tonight.

629
00:37:13,393 --> 00:37:15,874
[SPEAKER_11]: If you guys like those games or other games like it, send us an email.

630
00:37:15,894 --> 00:37:19,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Mailbag at OrangeHouseRadio.com We're looking for ideas for new games, by the way.

631
00:37:20,315 --> 00:37:22,135
[SPEAKER_11]: So, just wanted to put that out there.

632
00:37:24,135 --> 00:37:25,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's get back into the gaming news.

633
00:37:26,396 --> 00:37:27,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, take it away.

634
00:37:27,676 --> 00:37:28,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

635
00:37:28,256 --> 00:37:32,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so yeah, there's some interesting stuff.

636
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:34,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, this is really interesting.

637
00:37:34,637 --> 00:37:37,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Nokia has unveiled the Engage gaming platform.

638
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:38,898
[SPEAKER_07]: You now remember that

639
00:37:39,286 --> 00:37:49,011
[SPEAKER_07]: They are not making any more gaming systems, but their new Nokia phones, of course, are going to be supporting the brand new gaming platform, which looks okay.

640
00:37:49,111 --> 00:37:57,775
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got a few people on board already, including Electronic Arts, Capcom, and Vividi, and they've got some other exclusive games as well.

641
00:37:58,604 --> 00:38:10,488
[SPEAKER_07]: and it will be compatible with the Nokia models N73, N81, N93 and N95 and with more S60 models to be compatible at a later date.

642
00:38:11,169 --> 00:38:26,254
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess the games right now, they're going to be free to demo but will cost between 6 and 10 euros to play or buy the full version and feature online play against friends or of course random people via the N-Gage Arena.

643
00:38:26,957 --> 00:38:29,218
[SPEAKER_07]: which I kept trying to get me to walk into during E3.

644
00:38:29,418 --> 00:38:37,020
[SPEAKER_05]: The Engage Arena at the last E3 that was a real E3 was pretty swanky.

645
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they actually had a really nice booth the last E3 I remember.

646
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:42,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Too bad it was a piece of crap product, but it was still a nice booth.

647
00:38:45,543 --> 00:38:46,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what do you think of this news?

648
00:38:46,683 --> 00:38:48,004
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I don't think this is so bad.

649
00:38:48,044 --> 00:38:49,524
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's kind of neat.

650
00:38:49,884 --> 00:38:52,425
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's much better than the Engage's actual system was.

651
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:53,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

652
00:38:53,646 --> 00:38:54,806
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

653
00:38:56,966 --> 00:39:02,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, let's move on to the next story, which is about a new PC demo.

654
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Other things you can do with your PC.

655
00:39:04,571 --> 00:39:05,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Crysis.

656
00:39:05,792 --> 00:39:09,394
[SPEAKER_11]: Crysis is getting a PC demo on September 25th, 2007.

657
00:39:10,535 --> 00:39:14,597
[SPEAKER_11]: But the one thing about that day you should also keep in mind, that's the same day that Halo 3 comes out.

658
00:39:15,258 --> 00:39:17,499
[SPEAKER_11]: So, something to keep in mind.

659
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:19,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, a lot of people are anticipating this game.

660
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,462
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a big first-person shooter for the PC.

661
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:26,205
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you want to take that PC versus console gaming to a whole new level, there you have it.

662
00:39:26,604 --> 00:39:28,705
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you to the folks behind Crysis for doing this.

663
00:39:29,085 --> 00:39:30,185
[SPEAKER_11]: So, funny.

664
00:39:31,346 --> 00:39:31,606
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

665
00:39:31,746 --> 00:39:32,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Go EA.

666
00:39:34,127 --> 00:39:34,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

667
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:39,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, there is a new game, or I should say an older game that is free now.

668
00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:44,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Command & Conquer, the Gold Edition, is free to download.

669
00:39:45,011 --> 00:39:50,753
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can download it actually off of, I believe, the official Command & Conquer website.

670
00:39:51,573 --> 00:39:52,714
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty awesome.

671
00:39:53,034 --> 00:39:55,715
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess it's going to be...

672
00:39:56,544 --> 00:40:00,729
[SPEAKER_07]: They're also featuring Command & Conquer Strategy for the month of September.

673
00:40:02,911 --> 00:40:03,872
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you mean by strategy?

674
00:40:03,912 --> 00:40:05,394
[SPEAKER_11]: Like free strategy guys or something?

675
00:40:05,474 --> 00:40:05,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

676
00:40:06,515 --> 00:40:07,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

677
00:40:08,037 --> 00:40:15,586
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it's an ISO image, so you'd have to burn it to a CD, but that's pretty awesome, though.

678
00:40:15,826 --> 00:40:16,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Command & Conquer is a cool game.

679
00:40:17,107 --> 00:40:17,588
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty cool.

680
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:25,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow, another PC game that is free and has been free for quite a while, MapleStory, is getting an update.

681
00:40:25,471 --> 00:40:27,732
[SPEAKER_11]: I know some of you guys out there like to play this game, MapleStory.

682
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:32,876
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a free MMO that's available out there, and there's some brand new stuff being added to the game.

683
00:40:33,177 --> 00:40:37,700
[SPEAKER_11]: The mountain village of Mulung is being added as well as... Mulan?

684
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,562
[SPEAKER_11]: No, Mulung, not Mulan.

685
00:40:40,242 --> 00:40:42,264
[SPEAKER_11]: And a new town called Herbtown.

686
00:40:42,804 --> 00:40:43,665
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the herbs.

687
00:40:43,885 --> 00:40:46,487
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, like, you know, let's go smoke a joint, man.

688
00:40:46,968 --> 00:40:47,528
[SPEAKER_11]: Or maybe not.

689
00:40:48,461 --> 00:40:51,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are being added to MapleStory this week, so check that out.

690
00:40:52,222 --> 00:40:57,043
[SPEAKER_11]: I should also say that Mulong features a salon where players can buy new hairstyles.

691
00:40:57,443 --> 00:40:59,184
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a feature coming to WoW pretty soon, right?

692
00:40:59,664 --> 00:41:00,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I can't wait.

693
00:41:00,984 --> 00:41:02,565
[SPEAKER_11]: You love to customize hair.

694
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,045
[SPEAKER_11]: You've been looking for a new MMO to play.

695
00:41:04,065 --> 00:41:05,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Why haven't you been playing MapleStory?

696
00:41:05,685 --> 00:41:07,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I've tried it before and I thought it was a piece of crap.

697
00:41:08,086 --> 00:41:09,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Why did you think it was a piece of crap?

698
00:41:09,306 --> 00:41:10,086
[SPEAKER_05]: It was boring.

699
00:41:10,126 --> 00:41:13,167
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't understand what I was doing and my character was ugly.

700
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:15,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't play ugly characters.

701
00:41:17,193 --> 00:41:24,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, Herbtown, by the way, includes new monsters to fight, but no word yet if you can actually score some herbs in Herbtown.

702
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:44,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, following Lost Planet and, I guess, Ghost Recon releasing some map packs for free, Gears of War, the map pack that's been available so far, the Hidden Fronts map pack is going to be available for free as well, starting in September.

703
00:41:44,853 --> 00:41:46,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, tomorrow at 2 a.m.

704
00:41:46,654 --> 00:41:48,656
[SPEAKER_07]: is going to be when it's going to be available, September 3rd.

705
00:41:49,436 --> 00:41:55,560
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can get four maps that are included with that, including Bullet Marsh, Garden, Process, and Subway.

706
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,181
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's not bad.

707
00:41:57,321 --> 00:41:58,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Free is always good.

708
00:42:00,663 --> 00:42:02,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray for free aids.

709
00:42:03,365 --> 00:42:06,467
[SPEAKER_11]: I notice there's a lot of people online that aren't playing Gears of War anymore.

710
00:42:06,487 --> 00:42:07,267
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder why that is.

711
00:42:07,808 --> 00:42:11,450
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it's just because there's all these other Xbox 360 games capturing people's attention now, but

712
00:42:11,909 --> 00:42:17,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Seems like Gears of War was a big thing not that long ago, and now I barely see people on my friends list playing that game anymore.

713
00:42:17,892 --> 00:42:20,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe these free maps will breathe some life back into it.

714
00:42:20,093 --> 00:42:20,513
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think?

715
00:42:21,814 --> 00:42:27,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I doubt it, because they've been available for a while now, so I figured if people wanted them, they would have already bought them.

716
00:42:28,962 --> 00:42:36,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now there's been a lot of stories going around about how the 60 gigabyte PlayStation 3 is officially no more, that they completely sold out.

717
00:42:37,604 --> 00:42:44,606
[SPEAKER_11]: But Sony would like you to know that they have replenished their PlayStation 3 supply of 60 gigabyte PlayStation 3s on SonyStyle.com.

718
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:50,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Just because they were on back order at one point, they are now back in stock.

719
00:42:50,928 --> 00:42:54,629
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's no official word if the 60 gigabytes are officially gone or not.

720
00:42:55,189 --> 00:43:00,952
[SPEAKER_11]: That actually makes sense to me because Sony-style store, whatever it's called, is not Sony Inc.

721
00:43:01,432 --> 00:43:02,013
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

722
00:43:02,053 --> 00:43:03,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, it's just another store.

723
00:43:03,894 --> 00:43:07,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Like any other GameStop or whatever, it just happens to be run by Sony.

724
00:43:08,176 --> 00:43:09,196
[SPEAKER_11]: So of course they're going to run out.

725
00:43:09,236 --> 00:43:10,577
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't mean the whole supply is gone.

726
00:43:11,057 --> 00:43:20,582
[SPEAKER_11]: So, it doesn't mean... I mean, this isn't really a whole lot of big news to me, but just to kind of stop the doom and gloom that was going around about, oh, the 60 gigs are gone, they're gone forever, and so on.

727
00:43:22,463 --> 00:43:23,663
[SPEAKER_11]: One of these days I'll buy a PlayStation 3.

728
00:43:24,204 --> 00:43:24,684
[SPEAKER_11]: One of these days.

729
00:43:25,649 --> 00:43:27,390
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, one of these days there'll be games for it.

730
00:43:29,071 --> 00:43:32,372
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, and I own a PS3 and I'm kind of disappointed.

731
00:43:32,712 --> 00:43:36,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Luckily, though, in October, though, I'm looking forward to Ratchet & Clank.

732
00:43:37,095 --> 00:43:41,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually going to skip out on buying Lair and skip on Heavenly Sword.

733
00:43:41,357 --> 00:43:43,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Lair's been getting some crap reviews, though.

734
00:43:43,638 --> 00:43:44,058
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of...

735
00:43:45,117 --> 00:43:49,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a last minute story too about Lair, so let me ask you.

736
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:14,021
[SPEAKER_11]: While we wait for those calls, I'll go to Loki real quick for any last-minute stories.

737
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:19,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Real quick, you can play Lair on your PSP via remote play.

738
00:44:19,603 --> 00:44:21,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, gimmicky.

739
00:44:22,725 --> 00:44:24,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, you can play the whole game on your PSP?

740
00:44:24,265 --> 00:44:29,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, most of it, because the PSP lacks, of course, a second R2 and L2 buttons.

741
00:44:30,008 --> 00:44:30,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

742
00:44:30,368 --> 00:44:31,229
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let's go to the phones.

743
00:44:31,249 --> 00:44:32,209
[SPEAKER_11]: We're getting some calls now.

744
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,070
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll come back to that in a minute.

745
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:35,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

746
00:44:35,271 --> 00:44:35,611
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

747
00:44:36,863 --> 00:44:38,924
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting a special phone call.

748
00:44:39,384 --> 00:44:40,944
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm getting a special phone call?

749
00:44:40,964 --> 00:44:41,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

750
00:44:41,924 --> 00:44:43,085
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting a special phone call.

751
00:44:43,145 --> 00:44:43,725
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Jason.

752
00:44:44,185 --> 00:44:44,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Jason.

753
00:44:44,905 --> 00:44:45,585
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew you were Jason.

754
00:44:45,665 --> 00:44:47,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Off again, listener whenever possible.

755
00:44:47,486 --> 00:44:50,847
[SPEAKER_11]: But our always constant webmaster, and we appreciate you for that.

756
00:44:52,027 --> 00:44:52,267
Always.

757
00:44:52,487 --> 00:44:52,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Always.

758
00:44:53,507 --> 00:44:57,889
[SPEAKER_11]: I just made you introduce yourself because not all the podcast people know folks by their voice.

759
00:44:57,929 --> 00:44:58,789
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind, Jason?

760
00:45:00,709 --> 00:45:02,910
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say that...

761
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:16,553
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody remembers, anybody here that actually listens to all games, they'll probably remember how much of a Wii proponent I was back in the day, the month or so, whenever it was coming up on the show, the month or so before it came out.

762
00:45:17,634 --> 00:45:25,840
[SPEAKER_01]: They might also remember that on the forums I mentioned something about me having a feeling that the Wiis might finally be generally available come springtime.

763
00:45:26,681 --> 00:45:27,582
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wrong on that one.

764
00:45:28,174 --> 00:45:28,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Watch!

765
00:45:28,494 --> 00:45:28,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Watch!

766
00:45:28,674 --> 00:45:28,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Watch!

767
00:45:54,378 --> 00:45:55,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Weebot1.

768
00:45:55,439 --> 00:45:57,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Hooray!

769
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:01,582
[SPEAKER_01]: I am now officially a member of the Wee60 camp, as it were.

770
00:46:01,942 --> 00:46:03,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Wee!

771
00:46:04,583 --> 00:46:06,604
[SPEAKER_01]: What games did you get with your Wii?

772
00:46:07,325 --> 00:46:09,245
[SPEAKER_01]: We got... I don't even remember.

773
00:46:09,286 --> 00:46:18,010
[SPEAKER_01]: We got WarioWare Smooth Moves, we got Trauma Center, we got Mario Party 8, we got Resident Evil 4 Wii, and I'm missing one...

774
00:46:19,927 --> 00:46:27,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's right, the bust-and-move for Wii version that the screenshots looked absolutely ridiculous, but it's probably going to be a load of fun.

775
00:46:28,169 --> 00:46:29,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, very cool.

776
00:46:29,169 --> 00:46:32,010
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing you're missing is Metroid Prime, because that game is pretty awesome.

777
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:46,674
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking at that, and I really did like the DS version, with the exception that I always played it when I was tired, so I played so little of it, and when it comes to escaping the planet, I'm way too tired to comprehend where I'm supposed to go, and

778
00:46:47,285 --> 00:46:50,886
[SPEAKER_01]: The 3D map isn't exactly intuitive when you're so dead tired.

779
00:46:51,967 --> 00:46:53,987
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm holding off on that for now.

780
00:46:54,047 --> 00:46:58,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to mention we picked up a points card, so I'm going to be grabbing a few virtual console things.

781
00:46:59,189 --> 00:47:06,191
[SPEAKER_01]: And given the 360, given that, given everything else, I'm going to have more than enough to suffice me for, well, maybe about a week.

782
00:47:06,271 --> 00:47:08,372
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I didn't want to buy too many things.

783
00:47:08,472 --> 00:47:11,433
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're adding me to your friends codes list very soon, aren't you?

784
00:47:12,586 --> 00:47:28,055
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, I'm going to go through the thread and get just about everybody probably everybody, I'm not biased and then I'll of course be throwing mine in there and we'll continue on from there very cool, well congratulations on finally getting a Wii so are you still as much of a proponent for the Wii as you were nine months ago?

785
00:47:29,396 --> 00:47:38,762
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never stopped, it's just a general availability thing coupled with money kind of thing and we get to thank the lovely Rai Chan for all that because she's actually the one that made this all possible

786
00:47:39,484 --> 00:47:41,885
[SPEAKER_01]: She's making faces at me saying, oh, me this, me that.

787
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:44,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're the one that did it.

788
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:48,467
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought I heard Rai in the background, so tell her hello from all of us here at OLR.

789
00:47:48,487 --> 00:47:51,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody at OLR says hello.

790
00:47:52,248 --> 00:47:53,448
[SPEAKER_01]: She says hello.

791
00:47:53,488 --> 00:47:55,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you kids have fun with your weave and not too much.

792
00:47:57,350 --> 00:48:02,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm on call tomorrow, but I'm generally off as long as nothing actually happens.

793
00:48:03,091 --> 00:48:04,772
[SPEAKER_01]: I have all day to myself to play.

794
00:48:05,217 --> 00:48:05,617
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

795
00:48:06,038 --> 00:48:09,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, try to stay off while you're playing with your Wii.

796
00:48:11,561 --> 00:48:12,462
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try my best.

797
00:48:12,542 --> 00:48:12,842
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

798
00:48:12,882 --> 00:48:13,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye, Jason.

799
00:48:14,283 --> 00:48:15,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye, guys.

800
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:15,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Take care.

801
00:48:16,744 --> 00:48:20,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, we love Jason because he not only hosts our website, but he's just a good kid.

802
00:48:21,227 --> 00:48:22,568
[SPEAKER_11]: So we really like hearing from Jason.

803
00:48:22,988 --> 00:48:29,192
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

804
00:48:29,252 --> 00:48:30,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go to the phones.

805
00:48:30,092 --> 00:48:30,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

806
00:48:31,013 --> 00:48:31,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

807
00:48:32,254 --> 00:48:33,134
[SPEAKER_11]: G68 again.

808
00:48:33,434 --> 00:48:34,015
[SPEAKER_11]: You again?

809
00:48:34,986 --> 00:48:35,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

810
00:48:35,786 --> 00:48:36,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Weren't you already on this show?

811
00:48:38,007 --> 00:48:40,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I got hacked by Loki.

812
00:48:40,548 --> 00:48:43,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well we've got to keep it real short to let some more people in.

813
00:48:43,949 --> 00:48:44,409
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind?

814
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:49,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I might get a new DS because my current DS is broken.

815
00:48:51,132 --> 00:48:56,634
[SPEAKER_04]: And Loki said some time ago that their websites were getting hybrid DS painted in custom colors.

816
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:59,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what are some specific websites?

817
00:49:01,977 --> 00:49:02,737
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the questions dropped.

818
00:49:02,797 --> 00:49:06,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you talking about DSs are coming in different colors?

819
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:10,060
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a website that has different colors for DSs and I can't remember.

820
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that like custom does them or whatever?

821
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,701
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I have to look.

822
00:49:12,801 --> 00:49:13,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on.

823
00:49:13,421 --> 00:49:24,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if he can't find it, I can tell you that... Now, I know you live nowhere near New York City, but I don't know if you can import these on eBay or what have you, but the official Nintendo World Store will do all these different types of colors that you can't get.

824
00:49:26,105 --> 00:49:27,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Gosh, you're pretty petty for them.

825
00:49:27,585 --> 00:49:29,806
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember being out there and there was a hot pink DS...

826
00:49:30,168 --> 00:49:33,510
[SPEAKER_11]: I swear to God, I came so close to buying it for like $250, though.

827
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:34,351
[SPEAKER_11]: It was expensive.

828
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:36,853
[SPEAKER_11]: I want a red DS myself.

829
00:49:38,634 --> 00:49:44,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, don't they have... I could have sworn I saw, not too long ago, they have the red and black thing now in stores with Brain Age 2, don't they?

830
00:49:44,918 --> 00:49:47,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but only the lid part is red.

831
00:49:48,621 --> 00:49:50,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you still find those Mario Kart DSes?

832
00:49:50,462 --> 00:49:51,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they aren't lights, huh?

833
00:49:52,083 --> 00:49:57,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I'm going to get a light soon if my regular DS goes to hell.

834
00:49:58,163 --> 00:50:00,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I still have my DS fat somewhere.

835
00:50:00,024 --> 00:50:02,745
[SPEAKER_11]: I should just give it away on the show or something because I'm never going to use it anymore.

836
00:50:03,305 --> 00:50:05,906
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's not a very exciting DS.

837
00:50:05,926 --> 00:50:07,266
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an old gray one.

838
00:50:07,767 --> 00:50:09,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I'll donate it to charity or something.

839
00:50:09,467 --> 00:50:09,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

840
00:50:10,228 --> 00:50:11,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I found the website.

841
00:50:11,528 --> 00:50:12,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

842
00:50:13,089 --> 00:50:15,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Although they are more expensive.

843
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:21,972
[SPEAKER_07]: It's colorwarepc.com, and they have everything from – I don't see –

844
00:50:22,975 --> 00:50:25,757
[SPEAKER_07]: They used to have PSPs and DSs, but they don't anymore.

845
00:50:26,077 --> 00:50:26,997
[SPEAKER_07]: They just have consoles.

846
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:29,999
[SPEAKER_07]: They have PlayStation 3s, Xbox 360, and the Wii.

847
00:50:30,299 --> 00:50:39,204
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually buy a red PlayStation 3 for an extra $100, or they have a gold one and some other crap.

848
00:50:40,325 --> 00:50:42,786
[SPEAKER_11]: The chat room is yelling at me for thinking about donating my DS.

849
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:43,667
[SPEAKER_11]: They want me to give it away.

850
00:50:44,087 --> 00:50:45,108
[SPEAKER_11]: You greedy bastards.

851
00:50:46,989 --> 00:50:51,872
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, GS6C, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but thanks so much for playing our game, and good luck on finding your red DS.

852
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,040
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, no problem.

853
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:54,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye-bye.

854
00:51:23,277 --> 00:51:30,741
[SPEAKER_11]: About, uh, it's been kind of a, uh, usual, uh, uh, or I mean, it's been kind of a slow news week, all things considered.

855
00:51:31,261 --> 00:51:33,662
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if that's, that's, uh, Labor Day or what the deal is.

856
00:51:33,943 --> 00:51:34,223
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

857
00:51:34,403 --> 00:51:39,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Then there's less people listening to the show tonight than usual, probably again because of Labor Day and all that stuff.

858
00:51:39,585 --> 00:51:41,927
[SPEAKER_11]: People are out vacationing and doing what have you.

859
00:51:42,627 --> 00:51:43,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Go figure.

860
00:51:43,588 --> 00:51:43,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

861
00:51:44,988 --> 00:51:47,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I guess that's all the folks that wanted to call in.

862
00:51:47,309 --> 00:51:48,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Their phone's not ringing anymore.

863
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:50,191
[SPEAKER_11]: People just being shy.

864
00:51:50,351 --> 00:51:52,192
[SPEAKER_11]: The usual suspects are on vacation.

865
00:51:52,802 --> 00:51:56,485
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and if there's no more last minute stories, that takes us to the end of the show.

866
00:51:57,145 --> 00:51:57,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Cry, cry.

867
00:51:58,967 --> 00:52:00,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Any final thoughts, folks?

868
00:52:00,308 --> 00:52:00,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go around.

869
00:52:01,308 --> 00:52:03,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Mikotov, thank you for being here, even if you didn't contribute much tonight.

870
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:05,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

871
00:52:05,251 --> 00:52:06,532
[SPEAKER_11]: But we appreciate your moral support.

872
00:52:07,293 --> 00:52:08,894
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm, you okay over there?

873
00:52:09,374 --> 00:52:13,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to, I'm doing cryptograms.

874
00:52:13,677 --> 00:52:15,639
[SPEAKER_11]: What is your new obsession with cryptograms here?

875
00:52:15,959 --> 00:52:16,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I love them.

876
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,840
[SPEAKER_05]: They're so much fun.

877
00:52:18,041 --> 00:52:19,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a website that you play all these things on?

878
00:52:19,582 --> 00:52:20,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Cryptograms.org.

879
00:52:21,983 --> 00:52:48,463
[SPEAKER_11]: is this because you're too busy now or i mean now i'm sorry now you're too bored because now that you won survivor there's nothing else to do i want to win another survivor game but i don't nothing's going on but you lost pirate master right yeah but that's because i hated people and i didn't want to talk to them at least that's what i'm going to say it is i don't know why else if uh hey those of you guys that listen to this show and think it would be fun to play one of these games online i'm going to talk in a future edition

880
00:52:49,157 --> 00:52:52,060
[SPEAKER_11]: A little more in depth about these online games because I think they're kind of interesting.

881
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:55,364
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not really video game related, but I think they're really kind of different.

882
00:52:55,744 --> 00:52:59,187
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to definitely talk a little more in depth about these games a little later on.

883
00:53:00,028 --> 00:53:05,714
[SPEAKER_11]: When a particular game I'm thinking of is going to be recruiting soon, I'm going to have some folks on to talk about those.

884
00:53:06,114 --> 00:53:07,075
[SPEAKER_11]: That should be interesting, right?

885
00:53:07,696 --> 00:53:07,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

886
00:53:09,578 --> 00:53:10,539
[SPEAKER_11]: And Loki.

887
00:53:11,283 --> 00:53:14,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for being here as always, even if you wouldn't drink with me.

888
00:53:14,526 --> 00:53:15,487
[SPEAKER_11]: We didn't really get drunk tonight.

889
00:53:15,507 --> 00:53:16,187
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of sad.

890
00:53:16,667 --> 00:53:17,448
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't drink enough.

891
00:53:18,509 --> 00:53:22,512
[SPEAKER_11]: I was nervous because of being on meds and all, and then Shane doesn't really drink ever, and you just drove.

892
00:53:23,313 --> 00:53:25,755
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry if we disappointed on the alcoholic content tonight.

893
00:53:26,055 --> 00:53:28,457
[SPEAKER_11]: I drank three of these Smirnoffs, but I'm not feeling anything.

894
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:30,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't know.

895
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:32,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, your final thought, Loki?

896
00:53:33,121 --> 00:53:37,304
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is, I don't know, I wish there was some more news.

897
00:53:38,225 --> 00:53:39,246
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this is a slow week.

898
00:53:39,781 --> 00:53:42,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm sure things will be definitely speeding up towards the end of the year, that's for sure.

899
00:53:43,704 --> 00:53:44,845
[SPEAKER_11]: As games are released and everything.

900
00:53:45,426 --> 00:53:49,629
[SPEAKER_11]: And my final thought is, this Arctic Berry is probably my favorite flavor of Smirnoff Ice yet.

901
00:53:49,689 --> 00:53:51,150
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what your problem is with this.

902
00:53:51,871 --> 00:53:52,852
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too berry.

903
00:53:53,312 --> 00:53:53,693
[SPEAKER_11]: It's good.

904
00:53:53,973 --> 00:53:55,574
[SPEAKER_11]: It's delicious berry is what it is.

905
00:53:56,715 --> 00:53:57,075
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

906
00:53:57,596 --> 00:53:59,998
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking at chat room to see some stuff here.

907
00:54:00,698 --> 00:54:04,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Son of Dad says, Final thought, Metroid Prime 3 will own my soul this week.

908
00:54:05,222 --> 00:54:06,043
[SPEAKER_05]: It really will.

909
00:54:06,203 --> 00:54:07,104
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so good.

910
00:54:08,565 --> 00:54:08,825
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

911
00:54:09,761 --> 00:54:10,461
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it, kids.

912
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:11,641
[SPEAKER_11]: We're out of here.
