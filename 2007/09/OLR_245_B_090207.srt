Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,360
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,600
We are live on this Sunday evening, September 2nd of 2007.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,360
Happy Labor Day weekend to those of you guys that are in the States, to those of you guys

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,320
that aren't in the States, well, happy weekend and happy Monday and hope your week is pretty

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,320
cool.

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,560
Anyhow, we're going to get right back into the gaming news this week.

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,160
Sadly, Dark Sakura is not here this week.

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,640
Labor Day weekend just happens to be our anniversary.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,680
I think she planned it that way so she could have a three-day weekend off every year, but

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,680
oh well.

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,680
Regardless, she's not here tonight, unfortunately, but we're still here going over the gaming

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,680
news.

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,160
Shane is here filling in, although he's doing a terrible job because he's just sitting here

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,360
all night playing PSP.

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,240
I don't have a computer to look at everybody because my computer is off.

21
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,920
Well the thing you can look forward to is that in 40 minutes, the operator 11 thing

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,880
cuts off, so then you can use that again.

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,880
So there you go.

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,880
Hooray.

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,920
All right, let's get back into the gaming news.

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,920
Loki.

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,180
Anyways, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.

28
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,400
We know it's coming out this year.

29
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,620
We know it looks pretty good.

30
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,640
What we didn't know is what exactly had in it.

31
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,940
Of course now they're promising that it's going to feature more than 40 cars, tracks

32
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:29,760
with reverse and alternate routes, and Gran Turismo TV, an online video channel for the

33
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,800
PlayStation Network.

34
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,800
Also we found out that it's going to be available online for purchase, and it's also going to

35
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,480
be available via Blu-ray, just like Warhawk.

36
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,800
To which I say, why don't you just finish Gran Turismo 5 instead of releasing these

37
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,920
half games and charging people money for them?

38
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,720
I mean seriously, stop making demos for Gran Turismo 5 and work on the damn game.

39
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,600
Well, aren't they trying to give people a reason to keep a look out for the PlayStation

40
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
3?

41
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Yeah.

42
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,400
The reason is, oh yeah, we promised you Gran Turismo 5 at launch.

43
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Oh, guess what?

44
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,660
It's not going to be done until next year.

45
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,280
So what we're going to do is we're going to use this as another exclusive title, despite

46
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,680
the fact that it's really kind of a demo, and we're going to throw it out there.

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,040
Oh, and by the way, you're going to purchase Gran Turismo 5 when it comes out as well,

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,040
despite the fact that it's going to have exactly the same content, plus more.

49
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,560
GS68 says, Gran Turismo Forever.

50
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,240
And Dark Tetsuya says, I don't know, Loki, Gran Turismo demos are usually more packed

51
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,800
than most full-blown racing games.

52
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,900
Yeah, but this one you have to pay for.

53
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,040
Those comments are coming from our chatroom, chat.orangelounge80.com.

54
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,100
I don't have a problem with Gran Turismo HD, which is free, but I do have a problem with

55
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,640
paying for Gran Turismo 5, which is only going to have 40 cars.

56
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,080
Here's the problem actually they're going to run into is, what if people don't really

57
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,160
want to buy the full Gran Turismo 5?

58
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:55,840
Now you have this Gran Turismo prologue that's just as good, you know, might get people through,

59
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,600
and now they're not selling tons of copies of their $60 retail game.

60
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Uh-oh.

61
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Uh-oh.

62
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
All right.

63
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,320
Well, I know Loki has no problem with this SingStar on the PlayStation 2, because Loki

64
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,400
loves his karaoke PS2 games, right?

65
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Oh, yeah.

66
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
Oh, yeah.

67
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
Totally.

68
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,920
So why does the SingStar pack, don't tell the wife about this one, or she's going to

69
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,920
want you to buy it?

70
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
She doesn't care.

71
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,920
Oh, okay.

72
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
Good.

73
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
Why doesn't she care?

74
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
I thought she loved karaoke games.

75
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
Because I'm not going to buy them.

76
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
Okay.

77
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
Did you affirm that?

78
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,920
Did you tell the wife about the karaoke games?

79
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,200
I told her I wouldn't buy them, and I told her that there was this coming out, and she's

80
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,480
like, so?

81
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,480
So what?

82
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,480
Yeah.

83
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,480
She wants to spend the money on herself.

84
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,480
I'll buy her SingStar PS3 if she wants, and she can record herself singing on like...

85
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,440
I want to come over and play that if you guys get it.

86
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,700
PlayStation Network and stuff.

87
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,000
I will not touch this game.

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes, you will.

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,360
As I will not touch the singing portion of Rock Band.

90
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Yes, you will.

91
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,760
All we have to do is to, one night when you don't drive, we have to get you to drink a

92
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,520
little bit, and then you'll be good.

93
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520
Okay.

94
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,840
You were at my bachelor party.

95
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,640
I was near alcohol, boys.

96
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,360
Which, by the way, is on YouTube.

97
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,120
If you want to see Loki driving Mario Kart drunk, just search for Orange Lawn Radio.

98
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
It's there.

99
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,680
Too bad we didn't have the rest of the stuff on there, like me playing miniature golf.

100
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,240
Oh, that was so freaking funny.

101
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,560
I still have the videos for that.

102
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,200
Anyways though, but yeah, I was pretty sick with tons of alcohol, and they tried to get

103
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,440
me to sing karaoke at a bar, and I would not do it.

104
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,760
So I will not sing karaoke no matter how much alcohol is in me.

105
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,280
All right, well, damn.

106
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,320
Well anyway, if I could get to the story, SingStar is coming out on the PlayStation

107
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
2.

108
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,300
Well, it's already there, but the thing is that now there is a bundle coming out.

109
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,920
It's $150 US, and it's coming out with SingStar, and I'm trying to figure out which version

110
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
of SingStar it is.

111
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,520
SingStar Pop is coming out in November, and it's going to be a white PlayStation 2 to

112
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,060
perfectly match your Wii if you are so inclined.

113
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,280
So enjoy that.

114
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,280
150 bucks.

115
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,640
Not a bad deal for those two games.

116
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,920
It also, by the way, comes with a controller, a white controller, and two microphones.

117
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,920
So you're all set for a karaoke party with this if you're a SingStar fan.

118
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,600
I mean, I know some people prefer Karaoke Revolution, but it really isn't at all the

119
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
same game in the end.

120
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,600
It's people making asses of themselves in front of their friends, right?

121
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Yeah.

122
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
All right.

123
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,120
We touched on this a little bit in part A with the whole Manhunt 2 being re-rated thing,

124
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:26,920
but Cinder Yee, Leland Yee from California, is actually on the record saying that he favors

125
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:33,240
the adults-only rating and wishes that they allowed those to be played on consoles.

126
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,320
Basically, you know, that there should be an adult-only rated game instead of having

127
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,200
the Censor games.

128
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,680
And I think he'd probably like to see a lot more of the mature-rated games being adult-only

129
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,160
because that is pretty self-explanatory.

130
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,440
It's for adults only.

131
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,320
It's not, you know, maybe some parent thinks, oh, my kid's mature enough to play this game,

132
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
you know.

133
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,280
Instead of that, it is pretty self-explanatory.

134
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,280
And I agree with him.

135
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,440
I think that they should have adult-only games on consoles.

136
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,000
I mean, consoles are for everyone.

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,600
It's not just for families.

138
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
And you know what?

139
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
So what?

140
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,560
If you rate it AO and, you know, Walmart and everybody does not decide to carry it, that's

141
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,800
the publisher's decision.

142
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,120
They know what they're getting into and what hurdles they're going to have to overcome

143
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,120
rating it AO or having a game being released rated AO.

144
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,400
But I think it also would give them a lot more freedom to put whatever the fuck they

145
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,580
want in it, which would be awesome.

146
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:35,040
It is kind of interesting that the guy's been branded as this anti-video games guy, but

147
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:41,000
I find it very interesting that he is actually supportive of, okay, the content can be out

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
there.

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,980
You know, I don't care if the AO content is out there, and in fact, we should have a place

150
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,060
for it, but just not falling in children's laps or whatever.

151
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,560
We need to police it so that it doesn't get in children's laps.

152
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,400
He basically says in the OA, the use of the ambiguous term mature, many parents are left

153
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,360
with a false sense of how violent an emirated game may be, and obviously, even with some

154
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:10,240
retailers as, of course, the Federal Trade Commission study suggested.

155
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,280
I just think, you know, I think they should do it.

156
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,360
I think somebody should try.

157
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,520
You know, it's just like they say whoever's going to win the HD DVD and Blu-ray war is

158
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,480
going to be whatever system gets the most porn, is going to be what decides that war.

159
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,880
I mean, seriously, we're not banning adult DVDs out there, and I would think that that's

160
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,200
a lot easier for kids to get a hold of than, you know, adult games.

161
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,280
But they need to get past the point that games are not just for kids.

162
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,760
It's an entertainment media.

163
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,760
It's for everybody.

164
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,840
It can be anything, all age ranges.

165
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,300
So get past that and start treating it like it is any other media.

166
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,200
You know, make it available to the consumers that it's appropriate for.

167
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Alright.

168
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:04,440
Well, one game I'd like to see an AO version of someday is Silent Hill, because the game

169
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,760
is very sick and twisted as it is in its mature format.

170
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,120
Imagine if they could step up the violence even more.

171
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,960
You're a big fan of Silent Hill, aren't you, Mipotas?

172
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,960
Yes.

173
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
Yes.

174
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,240
Would you like to see a version that's even more violent?

175
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,240
Yes.

176
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
No.

177
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
No?

178
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,240
No.

179
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,240
Does it scare you as it is already?

180
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,040
No, I don't think it's about violence in that game.

181
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,600
Disturbing imagery, yes.

182
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Violence, no.

183
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Alright.

184
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,800
Well, there will be plenty of disturbing imagery in Silent Hill 5.

185
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,560
The collective who's developing the game, as you know, it's kind of a controversial

186
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,440
decision that the collective is developing this, so it's being actually developed in

187
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,320
the US and not in Japan.

188
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,320
But the collective is developing this game and they are actually borrowing elements from

189
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,640
the Christoph Ganz version of Silent Hill, which would be the movie.

190
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,120
Apparently they were big fans of kind of the way that the characters moved around in the

191
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
movie.

192
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,480
So there will be some motion capture for the monsters in the Silent Hill 5 game.

193
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,920
All of the monsters.

194
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,040
And they are borrowing the whole night to day element that was in the movie.

195
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,700
Remember how in the movie it would switch from, you know, I guess you could say night

196
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,700
to day or good Silent Hill to bad Silent Hill, it would kind of switch?

197
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,360
That's going to happen in Silent Hill 5.

198
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,560
And now you were actually reading up a little more on Silent Hill 5.

199
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,720
Some article that was in a recent gaming magazine, right, Mipotas?

200
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,720
Yeah.

201
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,760
And what other details did it give about the game?

202
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,340
The nurses are the nurses from the movie, like, full on.

203
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,240
They're the ones that are attracted to light and they look exactly the same.

204
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,600
What was this whole thing about now the monsters will chase you?

205
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,520
Oh yeah, the monsters just won't, you can't just run by monsters anymore, like, apparently

206
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,760
they kick down doors to get to you, which is really cool.

207
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,480
And I don't know, I can't wait for it.

208
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,880
I can't wait to get some of my friends who get really scared by these games, like I'm

209
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,920
thinking of one in particular that cried when she was fighting one of the boss monsters

210
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,920
in Silent Hill 3.

211
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
Oh, that was the best thing ever.

212
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,080
I can't wait to get her to play this game because I'm evil and vindictive and I think

213
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,200
it's going to be hilarious when the monsters start kicking down doors to get to her.

214
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,040
Yeah, she'll throw the controller down and run into a different room and cry.

215
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,320
And hopefully we'll have it all up on one of these video streaming sites for you to

216
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
enjoy.

217
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,640
What you guys don't get about our friend, though, is, like, I'll go and pretend I'm

218
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,920
one of the monsters, I won't be dressed up or anything, I'll just walk like they were

219
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,440
and she hates it and freaks out.

220
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,840
So good.

221
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,800
pikaruno agrees, I get so scared I can't even play Silent Hill.

222
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,560
The first Silent Hill, I'm sure I've mentioned this before, but when I tried to play it,

223
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,720
I stopped it nine times at the very beginning because it was too scary.

224
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,600
That's just how great these games are.

225
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
Wow.

226
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,120
That's cool.

227
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,720
Asdartitsuyu in our chatroom says, what a horrible night to have a curse.

228
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,720
Funny.

229
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,620
Because it's a Castlevania reference, never mind.

230
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,280
I don't even get it.

231
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,300
Forget it.

232
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,440
That's all I have to say on Silent Hill.

233
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,760
I'm definitely looking forward to Silent Hill 5.

234
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,760
I looked at the same article, too.

235
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,640
It looks like it's going to be pretty sweet.

236
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,080
Actually, let me ask real quick, Shane, since you're such a big fan of the series from before,

237
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,280
are you looking forward to this?

238
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,000
I know that you were a little nervous when you heard it was going to a different developer

239
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,920
and it's being developed outside of Japan, but seeing kind of what they've done with

240
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,080
it, are you looking forward to it?

241
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,000
Are you still a little nervous or what?

242
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm still nervous.

243
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,120
The screenshots are good looking, but that doesn't tell you how the game plays or if

244
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,280
the story is really good or if they have the elements that make it Silent Hill in the game

245
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
or not.

246
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,160
It could just be like, I don't know, they could have made a really nice looking, what

247
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,960
was that crappy game called?

248
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,520
The one where you were all the teenagers in the school and all the plant monsters were

249
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,320
obscure or something like that.

250
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,040
Why are you shaking your head at me a lot?

251
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,040
Nothing.

252
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,040
I'm just...

253
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,040
Oh, yeah.

254
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,040
It could be like that.

255
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,880
That could look really pretty, but it could be a terrible game like that game was.

256
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,880
So I don't know.

257
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
I hope, but...

258
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,560
Maybe the liquor is just starting to kick in, so I'm just nodding a little more than

259
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,560
usual.

260
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,560
Okay.

261
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,560
Maybe.

262
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,560
Maybe.

263
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
Maybe.

264
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
All right.

265
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,560
I'm done.

266
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
Next story.

267
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,080
Anywho, so one game I'm not too excited about, Loco Roco for the PS3.

268
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:03,080
It's been dated for a release in Japan on the PlayStation Network September 21st, and

269
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,240
no price is announced yet.

270
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:15,180
It's looks like Odeo Loco Roco Boo Boo Coco Reco or something, I don't know.

271
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,080
All you need to know is that...

272
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
Wait.

273
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:23,120
Loco Roco Boo Goo Coco for Coco Puff Roco Boco is what it is.

274
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,560
What it probably means is, they don't know that it's just an interactive screen saver.

275
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,440
You fuck tards and you're going to pay money for this, thinking it's a real game, and ha,

276
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,640
ha, we screw you over again.

277
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
That's exactly...

278
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,640
Loco Roco Coo Coo Boco fuck tard, is that it?

279
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,240
Basically, the game is an interactive screen saver.

280
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:49,720
You will be able to use the six axis to tilt Loco Rocos around, but that's about it.

281
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,440
So hooray!

282
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,520
Thank you for yet another awesome game, Sony.

283
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,520
You rock.

284
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,520
Do you think Loco Roco just jumped the shark with this?

285
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:04,800
I think it's just, why even bother calling this a game, or even have to purchase it,

286
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,080
if it's, you know, not even really a game.

287
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,640
It's just a fucking screen saver.

288
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,640
Well, speaking of content available on the PlayStation Network, there's something brand

289
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,240
new available on the PlayStation Network for those of you guys in the UK.

290
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,800
It's the Dirt demo.

291
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,680
If you want to check out the brand new game Dirt, there's a demo for you guys on the UK

292
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,120
marketplace, which should be interesting to note.

293
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,480
The US also got this demo along with other stuff, but unfortunately those you guys overseas

294
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,320
get the shaft yet again in terms of content available in your PlayStation 3 marketplace.

295
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,920
Have a nice day, but enjoy the Dirt demo.

296
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,760
It's a pretty looking game, but I couldn't control it at all, but it's just not my kind

297
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,760
of racing game.

298
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,320
That's just me, I guess.

299
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,900
Anyways, one other game that you probably won't see over in the UK also is being developed

300
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,200
by Homeland Security in the US.

301
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:01,920
They are developing a game, of course, I guess, I don't know, something where you, of course,

302
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:10,400
defending the United States from terrorists, and they've spent $600,000 of funding Ground

303
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,560
Truth.

304
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,800
It's a game that would, I guess, cast players in the first responders to a terrorist attack

305
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,900
or natural disasters.

306
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,860
Thank you, Homeland Security, for spending our money on a game instead of protecting

307
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,560
the homeland.

308
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,680
Is this a free download thing for PCs, or is this like a Flash game?

309
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,680
What the hell is this?

310
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,680
It's just something that's being developed.

311
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,760
It's not even done yet, so we don't know if it's going to be free or whatnot.

312
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,760
Interesting.

313
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
What do they hope to accomplish with a game like this, I wonder?

314
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,920
Wouldn't it be funny if the terrorists played it instead?

315
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:47,880
It would probably be to build on the success that, say, America's Army had.

316
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,180
I was just thinking of America's Army, and even Jonathan F. in our chat room says, America's

317
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,720
Army was free.

318
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,440
Dark Tetsuya says, Shane went there.

319
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,600
When do I not go there, seriously?

320
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,940
I guess the game is being developed by Sandia National Labs with grad students from University

321
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,240
of Southern California doing the graphics work.

322
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,480
Interesting.

323
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,700
So stop spending government money on this crap, seriously.

324
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,320
You don't need a fucking game.

325
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,320
You don't see the Department of Transportation saying, we want a game, or you know, God knows

326
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,320
what else.

327
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,560
They should have like a Bush PR campaign game or something.

328
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,760
Interesting point from an escapist in our chat room.

329
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,840
That may seem like an expensive game to make, but keep in mind King's Quest cost $700,000

330
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,880
when it first came out all those years ago.

331
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
Hmm.

332
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,880
Oh, great.

333
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,540
Isn't all that marketing?

334
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:43,160
They're going to waste a lot of money building this game, and it's going to suck.

335
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
That's awesome.

336
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,960
Wait, you're not trying to say King's Quest sucks, does it, because King's Quest is like

337
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
one of the greatest games ever made.

338
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,440
King's Quest is fucking old.

339
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,720
So it's old, but it's great.

340
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,440
Well, back in the day, $700,000 is probably a lot of money.

341
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,280
Nowadays production costs have gone up due to the wonderful systems and graphics that

342
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,280
we have and have come to love.

343
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:13,400
So back in the day, it was EGA graphics, all fucking 16 colors of wonderful goodness.

344
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,880
All right.

345
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,800
Well, this is a topic that's never fun to talk about, and I hate it when it comes up

346
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,600
on the show, but I think we need to bring this up one more time to bring up the clarification

347
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,200
piece that came out this week, and that would have to do with the really horrible tragedy

348
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,240
that happened at Virginia Tech earlier this year.

349
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,820
Many months later now, the Virginia State report, the official final report has come

350
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,820
out.

351
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:40,440
The Virginia Tech Massacre Review Panel has released their report, and it does show that

352
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,760
there is no link between video games and the murders that were committed by the culprit.

353
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,240
Actually, the only game that is even mentioned in the report is Sonic the Hedgehog.

354
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,400
Now I would fail to see where Sonic the Hedgehog is going to provoke violent gaming.

355
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,860
Unless he went and played the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 version of the game, which the

356
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,840
controls were horrible and could drive someone to kill people.

357
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:09,320
Anyway, there was in the report, quote, none of the video games were war games or had violent

358
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
themes.

359
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,640
They liked basketball and had a collection of figurines and remote-controlled cars.

360
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,400
So this is a big screw you to all those people that were so quick to blame video games when

361
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,480
this happened.

362
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:27,120
So the Jack Voldemort's of the world and Dr. Phil's and so on.

363
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:41,360
So to you folks, we dedicate a very special segment this week to you.

364
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,600
It's our FUs of the Week.

365
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,200
Loki, why don't you start us off with your FUs of the Week.

366
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,680
My FUs of the Week goes to the Lifetime Channel.

367
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:55,100
I don't like you, and I don't see the point.

368
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,040
That's it?

369
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,360
And to the director of that stupid movie that I had to watch today, learn how to light a

370
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
fucking movie.

371
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,280
Otherwise, you're going to be stuck making shit on Lifetime.

372
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,520
First off, I'd like to give an FU to Loki for not enjoying the greatness of his Lifetime

373
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,600
movies, because I love Lifetime movies.

374
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,720
I'd also like to give an FU to getting sick when I was traveling this week.

375
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,080
The only thing worse than having to travel and be gone for four days is getting sick

376
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,560
while you're gone and bringing that back with you.

377
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,600
That really stinks.

378
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
And then I guess that's it.

379
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,840
I can't really think of anything else this week.

380
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,840
So that's all my FUs.

381
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,840
Shane, Miklotov, whatever your name is.

382
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,840
Any FUs?

383
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
No.

384
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,840
No?

385
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
You're happy about everything?

386
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,920
No, but I can't think of anything to give an FU to.

387
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,920
Everything's perfect?

388
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,920
You're not angry at anything?

389
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,920
No.

390
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,520
Well, FU to you being so darn mellow.

391
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,880
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

392
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,360
FU to Blue Dragon, because it sucks.

393
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
There we go.

394
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,360
FU to you?

395
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,360
You don't even...

396
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,360
Do you even know why you hate Blue Dragon?

397
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
Yes.

398
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,360
The combat is boring.

399
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,360
The combat is awesome.

400
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,360
The game is dull looking.

401
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
You're dull looking.

402
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:05,720
It looks like a generic RPG that could have been made by any company ever.

403
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,880
That I actually, you know, unfortunately there's not a lot that sets this apart from another

404
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,960
RPG except for the fact that it's on the 360 and it's pretty.

405
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
But...

406
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,480
The character models even look pretty bland.

407
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,640
The music's good.

408
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,240
No, because those boss fights have terrible, terrible songs.

409
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,720
The boss fight song's awesome.

410
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,720
No.

411
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
Worst game.

412
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,600
The boss fight song is a vocal rock song, which is pretty rad.

413
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,360
Don't listen to what Shane says.

414
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,360
No.

415
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,360
Listen to what I say.

416
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,360
No, don't.

417
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,360
All right.

418
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,360
Back to the news.

419
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:40,240
Anyways, Castlevania, the wonderful game that's gonna become a movie, yay, is now being completely

420
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,240
rewritten.

421
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,680
Yes, they've thrown out the script and are going back to the drawing boards.

422
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:51,800
Apparently, Paul W.S. Anderson, who was going to direct the movie, is not now, obviously,

423
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:57,160
and now they have a new person working on the script.

424
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:02,800
It's Ian Jeffers, who's done a screenplay for the wonderful Kevin Bacon action flick

425
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,440
that just got released here in the United States, Death Sentence.

426
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,920
Yes, you may not have seen it yet, but I'm sure that you will at some point because that's

427
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,000
super awesome and I know you wouldn't miss it.

428
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,160
So he's working on the script now.

429
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,600
His take on it, I guess, and of course the new director is Sylvain White, says, I was

430
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:30,500
attracted by the chance to make a dark, epic period movie that almost has an anime feel

431
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,720
to it.

432
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:43,920
So let's hope and pray that it doesn't suck, and unfortunately past track records of movie

433
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,160
games have not been...

434
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,160
My Magic A-Ball says, signs do not look good.

435
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:54,160
Loki, coming from the chat room here, did you like the band Deep Purple?

436
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,640
Do you remember the band at all, Deep Purple?

437
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,520
The one that did Smoke on the Water?

438
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,960
Yeah, no, actually I got to ask Shane this, do you know the band Deep Purple?

439
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,600
Yes, because Smoke on the Water.

440
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,360
The lead singer of Deep Purple is the guy that sings the song in Blue Dragon.

441
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,720
No wonder it sounds bad.

442
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,160
That little tidbit coming from Escapist, so there you go.

443
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,640
Let's talk about other movies.

444
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,200
Now of course there's been lots of movies this year.

445
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,280
You have King of Kong, which I still want to see, but I think the closest it's playing

446
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,280
here is San Francisco.

447
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,080
I'm not driving all the way out there just to see a movie, and Chasing Ghosts are some

448
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,280
big movies that are coming out this year, but there's another one that's coming out.

449
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,180
It's called Press Start.

450
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,680
It's not a documentary, however.

451
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,280
This is a quote from the little synopsis of the movie.

452
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,960
Zach Nimbus is a typical suburban youth and volunteer monster exterminator living peacefully

453
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,520
in a video game world.

454
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,320
It's a realm where people actually do cross rivers by jumping across alligators' heads

455
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,680
or being chomped to death in the attempt, and where injuries can be cured by eating

456
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,080
food laying around in old hallways.

457
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,500
Here the pleasant days are ending due to world conquest by the unspeakably evil but insecure

458
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,320
and telephone addicted wizard, Count Nefarious Vile.

459
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:11,180
Zach soon finds himself recruited by battle-hardened space soldier Sam, an enthusiastically bad

460
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:22,920
tempered ninja Lin Koo to join a last desperate attempt to thwart Vile's imminent victory,

461
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,840
but not before lampooning every video game convention that comes in their way.

462
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,220
So apparently this is going to be some type of little live action movie that parodies

463
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,760
all these other video games.

464
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,760
Here's the thing, though.

465
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,960
If you think this is some huge production that's putting this out, this movie looks

466
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,280
like it cost about $20 to make.

467
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,320
So don't be expecting a big budget production.

468
00:22:41,320 --> 00:23:01,600
But hey, just because it has no budget doesn't mean it can't be good.

469
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,060
There is a trailer available, by the way, which you can watch on YouTube if you just

470
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:09,200
look for Press Start, the movie, there's actually a trailer, or actually looking at it in the

471
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,680
studio right now if you want to kind of check this out here.

472
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:19,800
Would you mind telling me what you were doing with these, hmm?

473
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:25,600
Don't forget what I did to your brother.

474
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:39,640
In a world ruled by an evil sorcerer, two rebels seek a hero foretold by an ancient

475
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,640
prophecy.

476
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,360
Who is ancient prophecy?

477
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,920
An ancient prophet.

478
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,960
This looks like that cheerleader ninjas movie.

479
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,520
I love LARPing.

480
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,520
Let's make it into a movie.

481
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,320
Why'd you let him hit you?

482
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,320
It was his turn.

483
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,320
On September 25th.

484
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,320
Batten down the hatches.

485
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,320
Rile up the mechanical dinosaurs.

486
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,320
It won't be a game.

487
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,320
Congratulations.

488
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,320
You've just leveled up.

489
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,320
Because it's a movie.

490
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:14,600
Did you see the graphics on that tree thing there?

491
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,600
That was crazy.

492
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,640
Those fools have no idea what horrors await them.

493
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,080
Thank you for warning us that the movie will suck.

494
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,080
Awesome.

495
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,880
Oh, it's going straight to DVD.

496
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,680
Never would have guessed that.

497
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
You never know.

498
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,680
It might be decent.

499
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,680
No, it might.

500
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,560
We'll try and get some of the guys from the movie on the show or something.

501
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,560
Where would you buy that DVD?

502
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,560
Like at a garage sale or something?

503
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,560
I guess from the website.

504
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,560
There's a little website.

505
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,940
It's straight on the website.

506
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:46,160
They're relying on a buzzword called, you know, it's like a viral marketing.

507
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,560
In other words, people...

508
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,560
Well, it's working.

509
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,680
We talked about it on our program and it was on a lot of major game blogs.

510
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,000
There was that funny part in the thing, though, about that it was his turn to attack.

511
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I like that.

512
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So it was like an RPG.

513
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
That was funny.

514
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,520
Come on, if you can sit through that Cheerleader Ninjas, I'm sure you can make it through this

515
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,520
movie, Loki.

516
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,520
There might be something about it.

517
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,520
Cheerleader Ninjas had nudity in it.

518
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
This might.

519
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,520
You never know.

520
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
That's a point.

521
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,520
Yeah, that's true.

522
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,520
There could be nudity in this movie.

523
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,520
Direct to DVD.

524
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,520
For artistic purposes.

525
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,040
No, they don't have the budget for nudity.

526
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,560
Would you really want to see any of them naked?

527
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,560
I don't know.

528
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,560
I don't think so.

529
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,360
What we're going to do is we're going to open up the Skype line because it's time to play

530
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,360
Beat the Host.

531
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:33,160
I love that song.

532
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
Let's just listen to that.

533
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,160
Okay.

534
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,160
Great.

535
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,160
All right.

536
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,160
Tonight we're going to play Beat the Host.

537
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,240
We're going to take our first caller on the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio, our username

538
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,040
on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR to play Beat the Host.

539
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,600
I've got to warn you, if you want to play tonight, you need to have some type of working

540
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,680
knowledge about music and video games or else your chances are going to be a little bit

541
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,840
screwed in tonight's game.

542
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,840
Here we go.

543
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,160
We're going to take our first call on the Skype line.

544
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,300
Again, our username is Orange Lounge Radio or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

545
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,300
Here we go.

546
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,300
We've got to call.

547
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,300
Hello.

548
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,300
Who's this?

549
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,300
It always gets through.

550
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,300
GS68.

551
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,300
Hi, GS68.

552
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,300
No, it's not Ravens Dolphin tonight.

553
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,300
It's GS68.

554
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,300
Hey, GS68.

555
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,300
All right.

556
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,120
Are you ready to play some Beat the Host tonight?

557
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,120
Yeah.

558
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
I'll give it a shot.

559
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,120
All right.

560
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,760
Now, how would you say your knowledge of old school or new school video game music is?

561
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,760
Eh.

562
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,760
All right.

563
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,800
Well, you sound very enthusiastic about your chances in tonight's Beat the Host.

564
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,360
All right.

565
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,280
Tonight you can challenge to Beat the Host.

566
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,640
I'm not going to let you play against Shane because he already kind of knows what's going

567
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,640
on tonight.

568
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,920
I know, but I never get to play.

569
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,920
He's just going to pick Matt.

570
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,920
Probably picks Matt anyway.

571
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
All right.

572
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
It's not even like they have to ask.

573
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,000
If I let you pick, you'd probably pick Matt, wouldn't you?

574
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,400
What would be wrong with challenging you?

575
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,040
Oh, you can't challenge me because I wrote the questions.

576
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,040
Oh, I see.

577
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,040
Oh, I see.

578
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,040
All right.

579
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,040
So, by process of elimination.

580
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,040
All right.

581
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,040
I'll go with Loki.

582
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,040
All right.

583
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,080
Then, Loki's going to beat the host tonight in Beat the Host, and tonight's challenge

584
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,080
is...

585
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,400
It should be called Beat the Host Named Loki.

586
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,480
Tonight's challenge is Put My Thing Down, Flip It, and Reverse It, is the name of tonight's

587
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,160
challenge.

588
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:24,360
Tonight's challenge is about who can identify the most video game music songs being played

589
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,360
backwards.

590
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,360
Okay?

591
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,360
Oh, God.

592
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,760
Now, these could be songs anywhere from an 8-bit Atari era all the way through new school

593
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,640
Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 games.

594
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,640
Okay?

595
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,280
If things drag on, I will give you guys hints to help you guess the game.

596
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,480
Which one to get it gets the point.

597
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,480
All right?

598
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,480
So, you guys know how to play?

599
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,480
I'm ready.

600
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,480
All right.

601
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,480
So, you guys are going to go at the same time.

602
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,560
GS68, make sure you yell out your answers nice and loud so I can hear you over the music.

603
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,560
Okay?

604
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,560
And I have to leave the chat room, right?

605
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,560
Yes.

606
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,400
You do need to leave the chat room or else people are going to help you cheat, and we

607
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
can't have that.

608
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
All right.

609
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,400
Okay?

610
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
All right.

611
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
All right.

612
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,400
Is he out of chat?

613
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
Okay.

614
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,400
You left the chat room, GS68?

615
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,400
Yeah.

616
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
Okay.

617
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
Now, remember, you don't have to send me a private message or anything.

618
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Just yell it out when you know it, because you're up against Matt in real time, okay?

619
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
Okay.

620
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,720
So, I'm going to keep score here, and...

621
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,120
There should be buzzers.

622
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,520
There should be, but we don't have any.

623
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
Let's go D.

624
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,520
Buzz.

625
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,520
We're a low-budget production.

626
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,520
Okay.

627
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
Here we go.

628
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,720
Here's song number one, and the first one to get it gets a point.

629
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,400
And remember, these are being played backwards.

630
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,400
Okay.

631
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:38,440
What's that, GS68?

632
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,760
I've heard this on the OLAR stream, but I can't put my finger on it.

633
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,140
Keep going.

634
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,280
This game was on the Dreamcast.

635
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,320
Seriously, you guys?

636
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,320
Space Shell 5.

637
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,320
Thank you.

638
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,320
Yes.

639
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,320
Loki got a point, finally.

640
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,320
Sorry.

641
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,320
How did you get to that?

642
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,320
I was...

643
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Because it sounded to me...

644
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:07,160
It almost sounded like Tank from Cowboy Bebop, but I just started thinking about stuff that

645
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,160
have the same kind of pro music.

646
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
All right.

647
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,880
Well, again, remember, these songs are being played backwards.

648
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,160
To me, it sounded like a song from Loop on the Third.

649
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,160
Exactly.

650
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,160
See, it's kind of along the same lines.

651
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,160
All right.

652
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,160
All right.

653
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,080
Well, Loki has a point, but GS68, there's 10 songs tonight, so all is not lost.

654
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
You ready for song number two?

655
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,080
Yep.

656
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,080
All right.

657
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,080
Here we go.

658
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,040
Here we go.

659
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,040
Animal Crossing.

660
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
Ooh!

661
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,040
Loki's on fire!

662
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,040
GS68, did you even hear any of that?

663
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,040
Yeah.

664
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,040
Couldn't recognize it.

665
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,760
It was Animal Crossing, the little drum, tap, little quiet stuff.

666
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
Yes, it was Animal Crossing.

667
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,760
Good job, Loki.

668
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,760
You played the game way too much.

669
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
All right.

670
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,760
Here we go.

671
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,760
Here's another one.

672
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,320
Remember, these could be from any system, new school or old school.

673
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,320
Here we go.

674
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,320
Here's number three.

675
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,320
Luminous.

676
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:59,720
Oh, GS68 knew that one too.

677
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
That's right.

678
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,720
That was Shining from Luminous.

679
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,720
Damn, Loki, on fire.

680
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,440
That sounded so evil backwards.

681
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,440
It did sound like it.

682
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,440
You want to hear a little more?

683
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,440
Yeah, a little bit more.

684
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,440
Want to hear a little more?

685
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,440
Oh, now it's a little healthier.

686
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,440
I like it backwards.

687
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:17,200
I want an MP3 of it backwards now.

688
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,360
I can send you an MP3 of it backwards if you want.

689
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,360
That'd be cool.

690
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,360
All right.

691
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,360
GS68, it's three-nothing.

692
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,360
All right.

693
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,360
You got to make some progress here, okay?

694
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,360
All right.

695
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,840
We're pulling for you, though.

696
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,080
Here we go.

697
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,080
Here's number four.

698
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,080
Ready?

699
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,080
Yeah.

700
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:47,080
This

701
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,080
game was on the NES.

702
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,080
Master Master?

703
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,600
No.

704
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
Super Contra?

705
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
No.

706
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
Contra?

707
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
No.

708
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
Ready to legend?

709
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
What'd you say?

710
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
Ready to legend?

711
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:04,500
No, it's not ready to legend.

712
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,000
This game had a character named Ryu.

713
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Ninja Gaiden.

714
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Oh, Loki got it.

715
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,120
Needed a couple clues to get it, but it was Ninja Gaiden.

716
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,120
Stage one music.

717
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,160
GS68, it's not looking good.

718
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,480
I'm sorry to say, but try to get some points on the board, okay?

719
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,120
We're all pulling for you, all right?

720
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,120
Yeah.

721
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
All right.

722
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,240
I'll bust Loki's kneecaps so he has a challenge in some of these later ones.

723
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,240
Okay, you ready?

724
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,240
Okay, here we go.

725
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,240
Here comes song number five.

726
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,240
You ready, GS68?

727
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,240
Yeah.

728
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,240
You can do it.

729
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,240
Act Freezer.

730
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,240
Sonic!

731
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,240
No.

732
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,240
Yes.

733
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,240
GS68 got one.

734
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,240
Wow.

735
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,240
I think the room...

736
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,240
What was that?

737
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,520
GS68 got one.

738
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,280
I think the roof came off his house.

739
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,280
It was Sonic.

740
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,280
Oh.

741
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,280
Oh, that's right.

742
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
Yeah.

743
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,360
I thought he yelled a bad word.

744
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,360
That is what you said, right, GS68?

745
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,360
Yeah.

746
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,280
That's what I heard, but he did it in that old...

747
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,920
I think it was an allusion to the old Sega commercials when he yelled it out.

748
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,920
He yelled, Sonic!

749
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,920
Or he just really wanted to win.

750
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,320
That was the bonus stage in Sonic.

751
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,320
The bonus stage music.

752
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,320
Yeah.

753
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,320
All right.

754
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,320
All right.

755
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,320
Good.

756
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,320
I'm so glad to see you get on the board, GS68.

757
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,320
All right.

758
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,320
Here we go into the next question.

759
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,520
Question number six, I believe this one is.

760
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,520
Here we go.

761
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,520
Parappa the Rapper.

762
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,240
Ooh.

763
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,360
Mere seconds splitting it up.

764
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,320
I could hear GS68 start to say it as Loki got it out.

765
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,920
It was Parappa the Rapper.

766
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,920
All right.

767
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,280
This next one's a little bit tougher, GS68.

768
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,280
You ready?

769
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,880
Ready for the next one, GS68?

770
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,880
Yes.

771
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,880
Okay.

772
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,880
Here we go.

773
00:32:47,880 --> 00:33:08,760
This is on the 360.

774
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,480
And the PC.

775
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,480
Not that one yet.

776
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,720
I guess.

777
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,520
No.

778
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,880
This is a role playing game.

779
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,240
I don't think that's the 11th.

780
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,240
No.

781
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,240
Oblivion.

782
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,240
Yes.

783
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,240
Finally.

784
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,240
Jesus.

785
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,240
Sorry.

786
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,240
It took long enough.

787
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,240
Yes.

788
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,240
It was Oblivion.

789
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,240
All right.

790
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,680
Looks like Loki has six, so there's no possible way you're going to be able to win GS68, but

791
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,160
keep playing just for the fun of it, okay?

792
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,160
All right.

793
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,160
All right.

794
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
We're going to get through the rest of this.

795
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Here we go.

796
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
Here comes the next one.

797
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,160
Contra.

798
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,160
No.

799
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
No, it's Castlevania.

800
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,160
Castlevania IV.

801
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,160
No.

802
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
Symphony and Night.

803
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,160
No.

804
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,160
Castlevania III.

805
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,160
No.

806
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,160
Dracula X.

807
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160
GS68.

808
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:07,360
I think he just gave up.

809
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,200
Castlevania II Science Quest.

810
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,200
Finally.

811
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,200
Jesus Christ.

812
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
Yes.

813
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,200
I didn't go through all of them.

814
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,200
GS68.

815
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,160
You should have jumped in there when his weak point was exposed.

816
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,920
For massive damage, you could have jumped in there with number two.

817
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,920
You're going to know it.

818
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,920
All right.

819
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,280
Here we go.

820
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,280
Here comes number nine.

821
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,740
Now, I'm going to say I think this was the hardest one in the whole bunch.

822
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:37,400
If either one of you can get this, props to you.

823
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:43,640
All right.

824
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:52,440
This game was also on the 360 and PC.

825
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,440
Fantasy Star Universe?

826
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,440
No.

827
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,440
What was that?

828
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,400
Final Fantasy XI?

829
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,520
No.

830
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,560
This game was the same composer who did the music to Oblivion.

831
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,560
Blair?

832
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,760
No.

833
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:21,600
The story of this game has to do with alien abduction.

834
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Alien?

835
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,760
Can I guess?

836
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,760
What was that, GS68?

837
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,120
I was going to say Alien Syndrome, but I forgot that's not on the PC.

838
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,120
Oh, God.

839
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,080
I know the game, but I just can't think of the name.

840
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:37,200
This game is notable for featuring a Native American lead character.

841
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,200
Prey.

842
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,200
Yes.

843
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
GS68.

844
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,200
I was like, finally.

845
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
It was on the tip of my tongue.

846
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,200
Yes.

847
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,200
It's Prey.

848
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,200
All right.

849
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,200
Good job.

850
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,200
Good job, GS68.

851
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
I knew the game.

852
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,200
I just couldn't think of the name.

853
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,200
All right.

854
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,760
Let's move on.

855
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,320
Ready for the last one, you guys?

856
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,320
Yes.

857
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,320
Here it is.

858
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,320
That was Butterfly.

859
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,320
Yes, Loki.

860
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,320
All right.

861
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,320
That's an accident.

862
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,320
Wow.

863
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,320
GS68, you got smoked tonight, I'm sorry to say.

864
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,320
GG.

865
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,320
A score is 8 to 2.

866
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,320
Did you just say GG?

867
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,320
Yes.

868
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,320
Yes.

869
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,320
GG, Loki.

870
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,320
GG.

871
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,320
GG.

872
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:15,320
Well, I'm sorry, GS68, you lost tonight, but it's our consolation prize.

873
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:28,320
We'll give you a second to plug anything you want to plug real quick.

874
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,800
I don't have anything to plug.

875
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,320
I'm sorry to hear it.

876
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,320
All right.

877
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,840
Well, thanks for playing anyway, GS68.

878
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,840
We appreciate it.

879
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
No problem.

880
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,840
All right.

881
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,840
Later, dude.

882
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,880
Good job, Loki.

883
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,160
You know, isn't that game unfair to the listener?

884
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,160
Why is that?

885
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,720
Because there's a time delay?

886
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,960
No, because when they're on Skype, it's still instantaneous.

887
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,960
Oh.

888
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,960
Yeah.

889
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,360
There's only the time delay if they're listening over Live 365, but they shouldn't be doing

890
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,360
that when they're playing that.

891
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,360
All right.

892
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:04,600
Looking at a chat and seeing what's going on, Zappy says, that was a hard beat the host

893
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
tonight.

894
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,800
Go Banjo thinks the last one was easy.

895
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,400
Well, if you're a DDR nerd, then the last one was easy, so there you go.

896
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,400
All right.

897
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,560
Let's get back into some gaming news.

898
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,560
That's it for beat the host tonight.

899
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,520
If you guys like those games or other games like it, send us an email, mailbag at orangehousereader.com.

900
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,960
We're looking for ideas for new games, by the way, so just wanted to put that out there.

901
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,640
All right.

902
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,080
Let's get back into the gaming news.

903
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,680
Loki, take it away.

904
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,680
Sorry.

905
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,200
Anyways, so yeah, there's some interesting stuff.

906
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,720
This is really interesting.

907
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,300
Nokia has unveiled the N-Gage gaming platform.

908
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:42,880
Now remember that they are not making any more gaming systems, but their new Nokia phones,

909
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:49,200
of course, are going to be supporting the brand new gaming platform, which looks okay.

910
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:55,280
They've got a few people on board already, including Electronic Arts, Capcom, and Viviti,

911
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,760
and they've got some other exclusive games as well.

912
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:08,440
It will be compatible with the Nokia models N73, N81, N93, and N95, and with more S60

913
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,160
models to be compatible at a later date.

914
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,840
The games right now, they're going to be free to demo, but will cost between 6 and 10 euros

915
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:24,480
to buy the full version and feature online play against friends or, of course, random

916
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:31,440
people via the N-Gage arena, which it kept trying to get me to walk into during E3.

917
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,680
The N-Gage arena at the last E3 that was a real E3 was pretty swanky.

918
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,440
Yeah, they actually had a really nice booth at the last E3.

919
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,760
Too bad it was a piece of crap product, but it was still a nice booth.

920
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
What do you think of this news?

921
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,000
I mean, I don't think this is so bad.

922
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,640
I think it's kind of neat.

923
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:59,160
I think it's much better than the N-Gage's actual system was, so there you go.

924
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,360
Let's move on to the next story, which is about a new PC demo, other things you can

925
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,680
do with your PC.

926
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:11,720
Crysis is getting a PC demo on September 25, 2007, but the one thing about that day you

927
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:16,800
should also keep in mind, that's the same day the Halo 3 comes out, so something to

928
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,800
keep in mind.

929
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,440
Well, a lot of people are anticipating this game.

930
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,960
It's a big first-person shooter for the PC, so if you want to take that PC versus console

931
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,560
gaming to a whole new level, there you have it.

932
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,840
Thank you to the folks behind Crysis for doing this, so funny.

933
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:40,400
Also, there is a new game, or I should say an older game, that is free now.

934
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:46,760
Command & Conquer, the Gold Edition, is free to download, and you can download it actually

935
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:52,020
off of, I believe, the official Command & Conquer website.

936
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:59,400
That's pretty awesome, and I guess they're also featuring Command & Conquer Strategy

937
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,000
for the month of September.

938
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
What do you mean by strategy?

939
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,040
Like free strategy guys or something?

940
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,040
Yeah.

941
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,040
Huh.

942
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:15,480
I guess it's an ISO image, so you'd have to burn it to a CD, but that's pretty awesome

943
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,480
though.

944
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,480
Command & Conquer is a cool game.

945
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,480
That's pretty cool.

946
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,200
Anyhow, another PC game that is free and has been free for quite a while, MapleStory, is

947
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,200
getting an update.

948
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,320
I know some of you guys out there like to play this game, MapleStory.

949
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,400
It's a free MMO that's available out there, and there's some brand new stuff being added

950
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
to the game.

951
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:43,000
The Mountain Village of Mulung is being added, as well as a new town called Herb Town.

952
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Like the herbs?

953
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,960
Yeah, like, you know, let's go smoke a joint, man.

954
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,840
Or maybe not, but those are being added to MapleStory this week, so check that out.

955
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:57,560
I should also say that Mulung features a salon where players can buy new hairstyles.

956
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,400
That's a feature coming to WoW pretty soon, right?

957
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,040
Yes, I can't wait.

958
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,040
You love to customize hairstyles.

959
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,120
You know, you've been looking for a new MMO to play.

960
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,900
Why haven't you been playing MapleStory?

961
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,760
Because I've tried it before, and I thought it was a piece of crap.

962
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,280
Why did you think it was a piece of crap?

963
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,280
It was boring.

964
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,760
I didn't understand what I was doing, and my character was ugly.

965
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,720
I don't play ugly characters.

966
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:22,520
Herb Town, by the way, includes new monsters to fight, but no word yet if you can actually

967
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,800
score some herbs in Herb Town.

968
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:33,640
Well, following Lost Planet, and I guess Ghost Recon releasing some map packs for free, Gears

969
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:39,880
of War, the map pack that's been available so far, the Hidden Fronts map pack is going

970
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:44,160
to be available for free as well, starting in September.

971
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,720
Actually, tomorrow at 2am is going to be when it's going to be available, September 3rd.

972
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,920
You can get four maps that are included with that, including Bullet Marsh, Garden, Process,

973
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,240
and Subway.

974
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,480
So that's not bad.

975
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,320
Free is always good.

976
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:03,160
Hooray for free, AIDS.

977
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,480
I notice there's a lot of people online that aren't playing Gears of War anymore.

978
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,480
I wonder why that is.

979
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,040
I guess it's just because there's all these other Xbox 360 games capturing people's attention

980
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,320
now, but it seems like Gears of War was the big thing not that long ago, and now I barely

981
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,080
see people on my friends list playing that game anymore.

982
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,760
Maybe these free maps will breathe some life back into it, what do you think?

983
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,120
I doubt it, because they've been available for a while now, so I figured if people wanted

984
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,680
them they would have already bought them.

985
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:34,320
Well, now there's been a lot of stories going around about how the 60GB PlayStation 3 is

986
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:39,080
officially no more, that they completely sold out, but Sony would like you to know that

987
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:46,080
they have replenished their PlayStation 3 supply of 60GB PlayStation 3s on sonystyle.com.

988
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:51,560
That's because they were on backorder at one point, they are now back in stock, so there's

989
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,320
no official word if the 60GB are officially gone or not.

990
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:01,520
That actually makes sense to me, because sonystylestore, whatever it's called, is not Sony, Inc.

991
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,520
You know what I mean?

992
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:07,640
It's just another store, like any other GameStop or whatever, it just happens to be run by

993
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,640
Sony.

994
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,720
So of course they're going to run out, it doesn't mean the whole supply is gone.

995
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,160
This isn't really a whole lot of big news to me, but just to kind of stop the doom and

996
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,360
gloom that was going around about, oh the 60GBs are gone, they're gone forever, and

997
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,360
so on.

998
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,040
One of these days I'll buy a PlayStation 3.

999
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,040
One of these days.

1000
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:31,720
It's alright, one of these days there'll be games for it, and I own a PS3 and I'm kind

1001
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,720
of disappointed.

1002
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,040
Luckily though, in October though, I'm looking forward to Ratchet and Clank.

1003
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,360
I'm actually going to skip out on buying Lair and skip on Heavenly Sword.

1004
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:46,280
Lair's been getting some crap reviews though, I'm kind of feeling bad for those guys.

1005
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,240
I have a last minute story too about Lair, so let me ask you.

1006
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,240
Okay, well let's open up the Skype line and then we'll get into the last minute stories.

1007
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,280
Our Skype line is open if you want to give us a call.

1008
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:01,840
Our username is on skypeorangeloungeradio.com or our phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR, that's

1009
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:08,920
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username is on skypeorangeloungeradio.

1010
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,120
Go ahead and give us a call.

1011
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,920
While we wait for those calls, I'll go to Loki real quick for any last minute stories.

1012
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:19,520
Real quick, you can play Lair on your PSP via remote play.

1013
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,520
Whoo!

1014
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,520
Gimmicky!

1015
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,400
Wait, you can play the whole game on your PSP?

1016
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,800
Well, most of it, because the PSP lacks, of course, a second R2 and L2 button.

1017
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,800
Interesting.

1018
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,840
Well let's go to the phones, we're getting some calls now, I'll come back to that in

1019
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,840
a minute.

1020
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,840
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1021
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,320
You're getting a special phone call.

1022
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,480
I've been getting a special phone call, who's this?

1023
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,200
You're getting a special phone call, it's Jason.

1024
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,720
Hi Jason, I knew you were Jason.

1025
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,560
On again, off again, listen whenever possible.

1026
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,400
But our always constant webmaster, and we appreciate you for that.

1027
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,400
Always.

1028
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,400
Always.

1029
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,340
I just want to make you introduce yourself, because not all the podcast people know folks

1030
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,340
by their voice.

1031
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,040
What's on your mind, Jason?

1032
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:06,280
I was just going to say that if anybody remembers anybody here that actually listens to all

1033
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:11,680
games, they'll probably remember how much of a Wii proponent I was back in the day,

1034
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,280
the month or so, whenever it was coming up on the show, the month or so before it came

1035
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,280
out.

1036
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,280
Right.

1037
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,160
They might also remember that on the forums, I mentioned something about me having a feeling

1038
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,560
that the Wiis might finally be generally available come springtime.

1039
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,760
I was wrong on that one.

1040
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,740
Hey, I saw a whole bunch of them sitting on a rack at Fry's the other day, I was finally

1041
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:35,440
surprised to see, I mean there were like 20 of them in this cart, so I was surprised to

1042
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,000
see them pretty abundant now.

1043
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,240
Amazing that whenever I've been going to stores, whenever we drop by the electronics section

1044
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,640
at Walmart, Target, whenever we run by Best Buy, any other electronics related store,

1045
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,600
every time I've looked, I've never actually seen one available until today.

1046
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,320
And so you know what happened today?

1047
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,320
What?

1048
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,320
We bought one.

1049
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,320
Hooray!

1050
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:03,240
I am now officially a member of the Wii 60 camp, as it were.

1051
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,240
Wee!

1052
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,240
Yes.

1053
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:12,800
We got, I don't even remember, we got WarioWare Smooth Moves, we got Trauma Center, we got

1054
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:20,840
Mario Party 8, we got Resident Evil 4 Wii, and I'm missing one, yes, that's right, the

1055
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:26,360
Bust and Move 4 Wii version that the screenshots looked absolutely ridiculous, but it's probably

1056
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,000
going to be a load of fun.

1057
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,200
Wow, very cool.

1058
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,000
The only thing you're missing is Metroid Prime, because that game is pretty awesome.

1059
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,120
I was looking at that, and I really did like the DS version, with the exception that I've

1060
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:42,800
always played it when I was tired, so I played so little of it, and when it comes to escaping

1061
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,960
the planet, I'm way too tired to comprehend where I'm supposed to go, and the 3D map isn't

1062
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:54,200
exactly intuitive when you're so dead tired, but I'm holding off on that for now, not to

1063
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,480
mention we picked up a points card, so I'm going to be grabbing a few virtual console

1064
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:02,940
things, and given the 360, given that, given everything else, I'm going to have more than

1065
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:07,160
enough to suffice me for, well, maybe about a week, but, you know, I didn't want to buy

1066
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,160
too many things.

1067
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,880
And you're adding me to your friend's codes list very soon, aren't you?

1068
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:16,040
Well, of course, I'm going to go through the thread and get just about everybody, probably

1069
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:20,480
everybody, I'm not biased, and then I'll of course be throwing mine in there, and we'll

1070
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,800
continue on from there.

1071
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,800
Very cool.

1072
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,840
Well, congratulations, I'm finally getting a Wii, so do you still, are you still as much

1073
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,200
of a proponent for the Wii as you were nine months ago?

1074
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:34,640
I've never stopped, it's just a general availability thing, coupled with money kind of thing, and

1075
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,920
we get to thank the lovely Rai Chan for all that, because she's actually the one that

1076
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,920
made this all possible.

1077
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:44,560
She's making faces at me, saying, oh, me this, me that, yeah, you're the one that did it.

1078
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:49,840
I thought I heard Rai in the background, so tell her hello from all of us here at O.M.R.

1079
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,840
Everybody in O.M.R. says hello, and she says hello.

1080
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,840
Hello.

1081
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:57,440
Well, you kids have fun with your Wii, but not too much.

1082
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,680
No, I'm off, well, I'm on call tomorrow, but I'm generally off as long as nothing actually

1083
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,680
happens.

1084
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,520
I have all paid myself to play.

1085
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,520
All right.

1086
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,520
Well, try to stay off while you're playing with your Wii.

1087
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,960
I'll try my best.

1088
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:12,960
All right.

1089
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,960
Bye, Jason.

1090
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:14,960
Bye, guys.

1091
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,960
Take care.

1092
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,680
We love Jason, because he not only hosts our website, but he's just a good kid, so we really

1093
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,680
like hearing from Jason.

1094
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:28,600
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is ORANGE LOUNGE

1095
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,600
RADIO.

1096
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,600
Let's go to the phones.

1097
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,600
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1098
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,600
Who's this?

1099
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,600
GSX8 again.

1100
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,600
You again?

1101
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,600
Yes.

1102
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,600
Weren't you already on this show?

1103
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,600
Yeah, and I got hacked, sort of, by Loki.

1104
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,600
All right.

1105
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,600
That's the host.

1106
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,600
All right.

1107
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,600
Well, we've got to keep it real short to let some more people in.

1108
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,600
So what's on your mind?

1109
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,600
Oh.

1110
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,600
Oh.

1111
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,240
I might get a new DS in, because my current DS is broken.

1112
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:56,880
Logi said some time ago that their websites were getting hybrid DS being in custom colors.

1113
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,080
Logi, what are some specific websites?

1114
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,080
Some of the questions dropped.

1115
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,760
Are you talking about websites that their DSes are coming in different colors?

1116
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,920
There was a website that has different colors for DSes, and I can't remember.

1117
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,680
Oh, the, like, custom dozen or whatever?

1118
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:12,680
Yeah.

1119
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:13,680
Yeah, I have to look.

1120
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,680
Hold on.

1121
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,520
Well, if he can't find it, I can tell you that, now, I know you live nowhere near New

1122
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,200
York City, but I don't know if you can import these on eBay or what have you, but the official

1123
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,080
Nintendo World store will do all these different types of colors that you can't get.

1124
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,440
You know, gosh, you're a pretty penny for them.

1125
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,040
Like, I remember being out there, and there was, like, a hot pink DS.

1126
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,600
I swear to God, I came so close to buying it for, like, $250, though.

1127
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,600
It was expensive.

1128
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,240
I want a red DS myself.

1129
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,240
Hmm.

1130
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:42,240
Well, don't they have, I could have sworn I saw, not too long ago, they have the red

1131
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,240
and black thing now in stores with Brain Age 2, don't they?

1132
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,680
Yeah, but only the lid part is red.

1133
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,560
Can you still find those Mario Kart DSes in there?

1134
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,560
Those aren't lights, huh?

1135
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,560
Yeah.

1136
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,560
Those aren't lights.

1137
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:58,040
I'm going to get a light soon if my DS, my regular DS, goes to hell.

1138
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,040
Yeah, I still have my DS fat somewhere.

1139
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,160
I should just give it away on the show or something, because I'm never going to use

1140
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,160
it anymore.

1141
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,000
But it's not a very exciting DS.

1142
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,280
It's an old gray one.

1143
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,240
Maybe I'll donate it to charity or something.

1144
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,240
DS is a DS.

1145
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,240
Okay, I found the website.

1146
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,240
Yes.

1147
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,300
Although they are more expensive.

1148
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:24,320
It's colorwarepc.com, and they have everything from, I don't see, they used to have PSPs

1149
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,880
and DSes, but they don't anymore.

1150
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,120
They just have consoles.

1151
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,360
They have PlayStation 3s, Xbox 360, and the Wii.

1152
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:37,360
You can actually buy a red PlayStation 3 for an extra hundred bucks, or they have a gold

1153
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,320
one and some other crap.

1154
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,840
The chat room is yelling at me for thinking about donating my DS.

1155
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,120
They want me to give it away.

1156
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,440
You greedy bastards.

1157
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,640
All right, GSCC, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but thanks so much

1158
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,560
for playing our game, and good luck on finding your red DS.

1159
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,880
Thanks, no problem.

1160
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:54,880
Bye-bye.

1161
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,320
Well, you know what I just thought as well?

1162
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,440
He could check Play Asia, because you can import some different colors from Japan, but

1163
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,840
I don't think they have red DSes over there, do they?

1164
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,880
I can't remember.

1165
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,000
There's a lot more different colors over there, though, than there are over here.

1166
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,320
I know that.

1167
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:12,240
If there's any more calls, please call in right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or username on

1168
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,420
Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1169
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:16,000
Any other last-minute stories, Loki, while we wait?

1170
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Nope.

1171
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Just that one.

1172
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
No, that's it?

1173
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Just the one about Laird?

1174
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,880
Just the one about Laird, and that's pretty much all that I cared about.

1175
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:30,800
It's been kind of a slow news week, all things considered.

1176
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,960
I wonder if that's Labor Day or what the deal is.

1177
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:34,960
Maybe.

1178
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,680
Then there's less people listening to the show tonight than usual, probably again because

1179
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,760
of Labor Day and all that stuff.

1180
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,680
People are out vacationing and doing what have you.

1181
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:43,680
You'll figure.

1182
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,680
Yeah.

1183
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,240
Well, I guess that's all the folks that wanted to call in.

1184
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,360
Their phone's not ringing anymore.

1185
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,400
People are just being shy.

1186
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,360
The usual suspects are on vacation.

1187
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:57,200
So, and if there's no more last-minute stories, that takes us to the end of the show.

1188
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,020
Cry, cry.

1189
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,400
Any final thoughts, folks?

1190
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,400
Let's go around.

1191
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,360
Mikkel Tod, thank you for being here, even if you didn't contribute much tonight.

1192
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:09,240
We appreciate your moral support, and I'm... You okay over there?

1193
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,800
I'm trying to... I'm doing cryptograms.

1194
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,840
What is your late... What is your new obsession with cryptograms here?

1195
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,840
I love them.

1196
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,040
They're so much fun.

1197
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,240
Is there a website that you play all these things on?

1198
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,240
Cryptograms.org.

1199
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:25,420
Is this because you're too busy now, or, I mean, now, I'm sorry, now you're too bored

1200
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:28,000
because now that you won Survivor, there's nothing else to do.

1201
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,360
I want to win another Survivor game, but I don't... Nothing's going on with it.

1202
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,160
But you lost Pirate Master, right?

1203
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:39,360
Yeah, but that's because I hated people, and I didn't want to talk to them.

1204
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,080
At least that's what I'm going to say it is.

1205
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,080
I don't know why else.

1206
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:46,360
Hey, those of you guys that listen to this show and think it would be fun to play one

1207
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:50,040
of these games online, I'm going to talk in a future edition a little more in depth about

1208
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,160
these online games, because I think they're kind of interesting.

1209
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,800
It's not really video game related, but I think they're really kind of different.

1210
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,880
So I'm going to definitely talk a little more in depth about these games a little later

1211
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,400
on when a particular game I'm thinking of is going to be recruiting soon.

1212
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,800
I'm going to have some folks on to talk about those.

1213
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,800
That should be interesting, right?

1214
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:08,800
Yes.

1215
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,800
Right.

1216
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:14,560
And, Loki, thank you for being here as always, even if you wouldn't drink with me.

1217
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,560
We didn't really get drunk tonight.

1218
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,560
It's kind of sad.

1219
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,400
I didn't drink enough.

1220
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,500
I was nervous because of being on meds and all, and then Shane doesn't really drink ever

1221
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:25,520
and you just drove, so kind of... I'm sorry if we disappointed on the alcoholic content

1222
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,520
tonight.

1223
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,120
I drank three of these Smirnoffs, but I'm not feeling anything.

1224
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,040
Yeah, I don't know.

1225
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,100
Well, your final thought, Loki?

1226
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:37,400
My final thought is, I don't know, I wish there was some more news.

1227
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,920
Oh, this is a slow week.

1228
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,160
I'm sure things will be definitely speeding up towards the end of the year, that's for

1229
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,560
sure, as games are released and everything.

1230
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:49,520
My final thought is, this Arctic berry is probably my favorite flavor of Smirnoff Ice

1231
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,520
yet.

1232
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,960
I don't know what your problem is with this blueberry.

1233
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,400
It's too berry.

1234
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,400
It's good.

1235
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,960
It's delicious berry is what it is.

1236
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,960
All right.

1237
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,800
I'm looking at chat room to see some stuff here.

1238
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,240
Son of Dad says, final thought, Metroid Prime 3 will own my soul this week.

1239
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,280
It really will.

1240
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,680
It's so good.

1241
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,960
All right.

1242
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,180
That's it, kids.

1243
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:12,180
We're out of here.

1244
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,180
Thank you guys so much.

1245
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,180
I know it's a little short tonight, but that's all right.

1246
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:17,280
I mean, it was slow news week and Labor Day weekend and everything, but thank you guys

1247
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,560

00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,540
of mouth and for you guys telling folks about our show.

1251
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:34,960
Please go leave us a happy, happy five-star review on iTunes and recommend friends to

friends in other ways, whether it be on Digg podcast or Yahoo podcast or what have you.

1253
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,240
There's plenty of ways to get the word out.

1254
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:45,520
For myself, Dark Sakura, who will be back next week, and Loki, thank you guys so much
