Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.600 --> 00:24.900
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, September the 23rd of 2007.

00:24.900 --> 00:28.300
I know we don't talk about the weather a lot on this program because we're a video game podcast after all,

00:28.300 --> 00:31.900
but I have to say here locally, where we're based out of Sacramento, California,

00:31.900 --> 00:38.000
it's been nice to actually see some signs of fall recently as opposed to still the temperatures above 100 degrees.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.100
So it actually rained this weekend. Perfect day to stay indoors and play video games, which is what I did.

00:42.100 --> 00:43.800
I played Eternal Sonata like all day yesterday.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.400
I love the rain.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.800
Rain's nice, but you know...

00:46.800 --> 00:49.400
I opened all the windows in the house while I was home.

00:49.400 --> 00:52.600
Yeah, I don't necessarily want to go out and play in it, but I have the view.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.900
I can look in the backyard and watch the rain fall, so...

00:54.900 --> 00:56.200
Rain is great.

00:56.200 --> 00:59.000
Rain's okay. It's overrated sometimes.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.700
If I wanted to see rain all the time, I'd live in Seattle or something.

01:01.700 --> 01:03.300
Live in Alabama for a while.

01:03.300 --> 01:04.600
Do they get a lot of rain there too?

01:04.600 --> 01:05.400
Oh, hell yeah.

01:05.400 --> 01:06.000
All right.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.700
Second highest precipitation in the country.

01:08.700 --> 01:10.800
It's a subtropical climate.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.600
All right. Less weather, more games.

01:12.600 --> 01:22.400
Yes. One interesting thing to happen this week is that Intel has actually bought the physics engine Havok

01:22.400 --> 01:26.000
and is now going to be incorporating it into their product.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.200
Interesting enough, the Havok engine has been in quite a few games,

01:29.200 --> 01:35.600
including Bioshock, Stranglehold, Halo 2, Half-Life 2, Oblivion, and Crackdown,

01:35.600 --> 01:39.900
and they've bought the company for $21 million.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.600
So...

01:41.600 --> 01:42.200
It's pretty cool.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.800
I could sell them my cat for $21 million.

01:44.800 --> 01:49.400
So maybe we'll see some more Havok stuff built into the new Intel chips,

01:49.400 --> 01:51.900
which would be good because, you know, physics are awesome.

01:51.900 --> 01:54.300
That's the new wave now.

01:54.300 --> 01:55.200
Take it from Loki.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.300
Physics are awesome.

01:57.300 --> 01:57.800
In games.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.000
Wouldn't it be physics is?

01:59.000 --> 02:01.600
Real physics suck.

02:01.600 --> 02:05.000
Intelligence are awesome.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.700
Intelligence are awesome.

02:06.700 --> 02:08.600
That's right.

02:08.600 --> 02:12.000
Get this, and you have to be really intelligent to do something like this.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.500
A World of Warcraft character has been sold for 7,000 euros.

02:17.500 --> 02:21.200
That would be about $9,700 US.

02:21.200 --> 02:24.900
The reason why it sold for so damn much money,

02:24.900 --> 02:28.900
apparently it had four out of five pieces of a tier six armor set.

02:28.900 --> 02:31.000
Obviously the damn thing was level sevenary.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
It had legendary swords that were dropped by Illidan Stormrage.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.300
So basically it was about as high of a character as you can get.

02:39.300 --> 02:40.400
And there you have it.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.300
This character sold for $10,000.

02:42.300 --> 02:45.800
Granted, I don't know where this sold, but I'm assuming it was on eBay or something.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.800
It sold for...

02:47.800 --> 02:49.800
The price was in euros, so it had to be in Europe.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.800
Well, yeah, but was it like eBay Europe or what?

02:51.800 --> 02:52.400
I'm not sure.

02:52.400 --> 02:55.400
If I were rich, I would buy him and delete him.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.400
That would piss everyone off.

02:57.400 --> 03:00.900
Well, I thought it was funny they were mentioning in there that the person that bought it,

03:00.900 --> 03:02.400
his regular account was banned.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.400
Oh, so that's why they bought it.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.400
That makes sense.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.400
But apparently it had been banned for some time.

03:08.400 --> 03:11.400
Yeah, that totally makes sense to spend $10,000 on a character.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.400
Never mind.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.900
Well, okay, in somebody's mind though,

03:13.900 --> 03:15.900
dude, what if they had a lot of friends on there or something?

03:15.900 --> 03:17.400
Dude, if I had that much money,

03:17.400 --> 03:20.400
well, you know, I would do actually constructive things with it.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.400
Probably someone like Ashlee Simpson or something like that.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.400
I'm totally hardcore, yo!

03:24.400 --> 03:26.400
Look at all the stuff I earned!

03:26.400 --> 03:29.400
All the stuff. I'm super awesome.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.400
And of course, the chat, our chat room,

03:31.400 --> 03:33.400
chat, thatorangehonestradio.com is asking about

03:33.400 --> 03:35.400
four strength, four stamped leather belts.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.400
You know what? Shut up.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.400
I'm only going to tell you this once, chat. Shut up.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.400
It's an inside joke. Forget it.

03:42.400 --> 03:45.400
Yeah, but World of Warcraft doesn't have a goat helmet.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.400
Like, like, Ragnarok does.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.400
You know what else World of Warcraft

03:49.400 --> 03:51.400
doesn't have that Ragnarok does have that's pretty awesome?

03:51.400 --> 03:52.400
Awesome.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.400
The bow that you can wear in your hair.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.400
You know, the bow is great.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.400
You can get a giant bow, Rob.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.400
I used to have a SARS mask and a bow. It's awesome.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.400
I gave you your bow.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.400
Anyway.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.400
It used to be my cell phone.

04:03.400 --> 04:06.400
I will think about playing Ragnarok on your server,

04:06.400 --> 04:07.400
but after I beat Eternal Sonata.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.400
I could give you panties.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.400
Please don't ever tell me that again.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.400
No, in one of the dungeons,

04:14.400 --> 04:16.400
it's like because the drop rate is so high,

04:16.400 --> 04:18.400
you leave with like 500 pairs of panties.

04:18.400 --> 04:22.400
Only on this program.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.400
It's Ragnarok.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.400
Women throwing their panties at me.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.400
Anyway.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.400
Next story, please.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.400
Panty lover.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.400
Don't wanna. I quit.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.400
Do not want.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.400
No.

04:34.400 --> 04:37.400
New downloadable content for Guitar Hero 2

04:37.400 --> 04:42.400
will have some pretty, pretty cool stuff.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.400
Trivium's a detonation.

04:44.400 --> 04:49.400
Atreyu a right side of the bed and protest the heroes bury the hatchet.

04:49.400 --> 04:53.400
I just think it's rad there's a band called Atreyu.

04:53.400 --> 04:54.400
We did.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.400
That was the dude in Never Ending Story.

04:55.400 --> 04:56.400
I know.

04:56.400 --> 04:59.400
Their cover of You Give Love a Bad Name.

04:59.400 --> 05:03.400
It's like the verse parts are awful,

05:03.400 --> 05:05.400
because he's also just doing nothing but screaming,

05:05.400 --> 05:07.400
but like the chorus parts are great.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.400
So that's like the worst and best cover ever.

05:10.400 --> 05:14.400
The cover does in fact give love a bad name, actually.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.400
It gives everything a bad name.

05:15.400 --> 05:19.400
Phil Do in our chat room says Atreyu sucks.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.400
They suck.

05:21.400 --> 05:22.400
But they have a rad name.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.400
I mean they might totally suck, but they have a rad name.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.400
You can't deny that.

05:26.400 --> 05:30.400
Well it's even worse though if you have a crappy band with a cool name.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.400
It's like why didn't you pick a crappy name?

05:33.400 --> 05:36.400
Dammit, now like a cool band can't have your name.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.400
Loser.

05:37.400 --> 05:42.400
What was that quote in Wayne's World, one of my favorite movies of all time?

05:42.400 --> 05:43.400
Who else is playing tonight?

05:43.400 --> 05:44.400
The shitty Beatles.

05:44.400 --> 05:45.400
The shitty Beatles?

05:45.400 --> 05:46.400
Yeah, they suck.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.400
Oh, that's not just a clever name.

05:48.400 --> 05:51.400
Yeah, that was great.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.400
I'm sure I butchered that quote, but I could almost quote that entire movie.

05:54.400 --> 05:57.400
That's how much I love Wayne's World.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.400
Anyway.

05:58.400 --> 06:02.400
Back to games, please help save the show.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.400
Anyways.

06:04.400 --> 06:11.400
So, you know, if you're not into downloading songs off of Xbox Live, well maybe you just

06:11.400 --> 06:19.400
want to buy the soundtrack to Guitar Hero 3 and put that in your system and unlock some

06:19.400 --> 06:20.400
more songs that way.

06:20.400 --> 06:27.400
Apparently actually there will be a code to download some songs off of Xbox Live to be

06:27.400 --> 06:29.400
added into Guitar Hero 3.

06:29.400 --> 06:34.400
Okay, three tracks that you want to unlock include, let's see here.

06:34.400 --> 06:45.400
A track by AFI, Carcigen Crush looks like Tina by Flyleaf and a remix of Marilyn Manson's

06:45.400 --> 06:52.400
Putting Holes in Happiness by Nick Zinner of the Ya Ya Yas.

06:52.400 --> 06:56.400
So, how much you want to bet?

06:56.400 --> 07:02.400
Just, you know, how much you want to bet that these songs are already in the game and you're

07:02.400 --> 07:03.400
just having to buy the soundtrack?

07:03.400 --> 07:06.400
Well, you're just unlocking them on the disc already.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.400
And that pisses people off.

07:08.400 --> 07:12.400
I notice that pisses a lot of Xbox people off when they download these things and they

07:12.400 --> 07:15.400
find that they're just keys to unlock shit that was already on the disc.

07:15.400 --> 07:16.400
But here's the thing, though, about this.

07:16.400 --> 07:21.400
It wasn't really clear to me whether this is just for the 360 or what.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.400
I mean, this is coming from Billboard.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.400
They were saying that this is going to be a code or whatever, but they may misinterpret

07:26.400 --> 07:31.400
it to actually being a physical code that you punch into the game.

07:31.400 --> 07:36.400
Because obviously this game is coming out on almost all the platforms, so it wouldn't

07:36.400 --> 07:39.400
be surprising if it's just a little key code that you put in.

07:39.400 --> 07:43.400
Kind of like all that exclusive GameStop content you get.

07:43.400 --> 07:48.400
It's just a code that ends up leaking out on the internet later on anyways.

07:48.400 --> 07:52.400
Well this kind of news makes me angsty, but it's not time for that segment yet.

07:52.400 --> 07:56.400
Well instead I have to do some news that makes me happy.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.400
You know I love me some GameTap.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.400
I've talked about the service here and I think it's a great service.

08:00.400 --> 08:04.400
GameTap is getting a much beloved game here of the OLR staff.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.400
I totally need GameTap now.

08:05.400 --> 08:08.400
Typing of the Dead is coming to GameTap in October.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.400
That's awesome!

08:10.400 --> 08:14.400
October 11th they'll be getting a Typing of the Dead there on GameTap.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.400
And I'm assuming that must be the Dreamcast one.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.400
I have that on Dreamcast.

08:17.400 --> 08:20.400
Because GameTap emulates Dreamcast software.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.400
So I'm assuming that's what it is.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.400
That's awesome.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.400
I have that on Dreamcast.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.400
It's so much fun.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.400
Oh my god it's so much fun.

08:27.400 --> 08:31.400
When I used to hang out with Iguana Girl.

08:31.400 --> 08:37.400
We used to just go over and do nothing but play Typing of the Dead for hours.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.400
I'm not even joking.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.400
What was the version of it they had at Arcade Infinity for a while?

08:40.400 --> 08:41.400
It was the Japanese one.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.400
Yeah the Japanese one.

08:42.400 --> 08:45.400
But you couldn't beat one of the bosses because it asks you trivia questions.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.400
And you can't beat it.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.400
Because it's in Japanese.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.400
Yeah unless you can speak it.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.400
But man playing the Japanese one was hard.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.400
Because you wouldn't know the words.

08:53.400 --> 08:59.400
Well I think that it had like an English Typing mode.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.400
And then it had the Kana mode.

09:01.400 --> 09:05.400
And I used to actually have the Kana memorized.

09:05.400 --> 09:06.400
But it's been a long time.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.400
Oh no I played the one that was normal.

09:08.400 --> 09:09.400
Like Romaji letters.

09:09.400 --> 09:10.400
You know you just play.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.400
It's easy.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.400
But then when you got to the boss that asked you trivia questions.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.400
You couldn't beat him.

09:15.400 --> 09:16.400
Unless you spoke Japanese.

09:16.400 --> 09:17.400
Of which I don't.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.400
And if you've ever listened to me cover Japanese release dates.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.400
And you already know this.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.400
Anyhow let's open up the old mailbag.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.400
Every week you guys send us emails.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.400
Mailbag at Orangelandsradio.com.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.400
And we read them here live on air.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.400
Dark Sakura will answer your questions.

09:32.400 --> 09:36.400
Or she'll taunt you and make fun of your grammar and punctuation.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.400
Mailbag at Orangelandsradio.com is the place to do it.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.400
Dark Sakura open up the mailbag.

09:40.400 --> 09:41.400
Dive on in.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.400
What do we got?

09:42.400 --> 09:45.400
The first one comes from Spamouflage.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.400
That's a great name.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.400
Guys you make my Monday morning at work fun.

09:49.400 --> 09:51.400
Thanks for the podcast.

09:51.400 --> 09:54.400
Why is Uncharted referred to as Tomb Raider with a guy and unoriginal.

09:54.400 --> 09:59.400
Where as every single WW2 slash army type slash alien space type first person shooter.

09:59.400 --> 10:02.400
Isn't criticized for lack of originality.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.400
Lastly I've noticed a trend on your show.

10:04.400 --> 10:05.400
1.

10:05.400 --> 10:09.400
Loki makes an Xbox 360 announcement and follows it with a neutral or positive comment.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.400
2.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.400
Loki makes a PS3 announcement followed by a sarcastic or negative comment.

10:13.400 --> 10:14.400
Don't believe me?

10:14.400 --> 10:15.400
3.

10:15.400 --> 10:19.400
Loki asks the ever so lovely Dark Sakura to ring a bell every time you say something negative

10:19.400 --> 10:21.400
about the PS3 and see how many times you catch yourself.

10:21.400 --> 10:22.400
Enough.

10:22.400 --> 10:23.400
Why the hate?

10:23.400 --> 10:24.400
Come on.

10:24.400 --> 10:25.400
Thanks.

10:25.400 --> 10:26.400
4.

10:26.400 --> 10:27.400
P.S.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.400
No idea how to spell Loki so make fun of me.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.400
I deserve it.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.400
It's L.O.K.I.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.400
Not with two E's.

10:31.400 --> 10:32.400
That looks very girly.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.400
Loki!

10:33.400 --> 10:36.400
That's like a MySpace name.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.400
Seriously.

10:37.400 --> 10:41.400
Put a T in there you have lockette.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.400
Should we do that next week?

10:43.400 --> 10:44.400
A bell?

10:44.400 --> 10:45.400
Let's do it.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.400
Let's keep a little tally thing.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.400
A little tally?

10:48.400 --> 10:49.400
Alright.

10:49.400 --> 10:53.400
Next week we'll get Dark Sakura a bell and every time Loki makes a negative comment about

10:53.400 --> 10:54.400
the PS3 we'll ring it.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.400
Well maybe they should stop making it so damn easy.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.400
Seriously.

10:57.400 --> 10:58.400
I mean.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.400
Come on.

10:59.400 --> 11:01.400
I own both systems, okay?

11:01.400 --> 11:02.400
Alright.

11:02.400 --> 11:05.400
I can't help it if they keep disappointing me.

11:05.400 --> 11:06.400
Okay.

11:06.400 --> 11:09.400
Well the emailer raises a valid point.

11:09.400 --> 11:15.400
Why does this Uncharted get passed off as Tomb Raider with a guy whereas lots of other

11:15.400 --> 11:17.400
games are copies of each other?

11:17.400 --> 11:20.400
Well I'm not saying that all the games that come out are original anyways.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.400
I mean, shit.

11:21.400 --> 11:24.400
There's how many World War II first person shooter games out there?

11:24.400 --> 11:25.400
I mean, seriously.

11:25.400 --> 11:32.880
And if I were to compare Halo 3 to Resistance I mean it looks and kind of plays very similar

11:32.880 --> 11:33.880
so.

11:33.880 --> 11:34.880
Ah, so you did?

11:34.880 --> 11:35.880
Yeah, that's true.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.560
You did make an Xbox 360 comparison earlier in the show.

11:37.560 --> 11:42.200
I mean I'm not saying that all the 360 games that come out are original and that's definitely

11:42.200 --> 11:43.560
not the case.

11:43.560 --> 11:49.680
You know, but I don't know it's just unfortunately the problem with Uncharted and not that it's

11:49.680 --> 11:54.940
going to be a bad game or anything but unfortunately their track record so far is all these games

11:54.940 --> 12:00.680
seem to be pretty average and it looks just like a Tomb Raider game but with a male lead

12:00.680 --> 12:04.120
and they're expecting this to be this big holiday seller.

12:04.120 --> 12:05.440
I don't think it's going to happen.

12:05.440 --> 12:11.440
I mean, maybe Unreal Tournament 3 but then again, no, that's another first person shooter

12:11.440 --> 12:12.440
game.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.040
I mean, nothing's original nowadays.

12:15.040 --> 12:17.000
It's very hard to make an original game.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.160
Well we'll withhold that final judgment until the game is actually released and you get

12:20.160 --> 12:21.160
a chance to play it.

12:21.160 --> 12:22.160
That's fine.

12:22.160 --> 12:24.120
I'm not going to buy it but you know what?

12:24.120 --> 12:27.720
If you want to buy it and if you like those kind of action adventure games then maybe

12:27.720 --> 12:28.720
that's something for you.

12:28.720 --> 12:32.800
Maybe that's the game that you've been looking for for the Playstation 3.

12:32.800 --> 12:36.880
If you're waiting though for some of these other games that they keep promising us but

12:36.880 --> 12:41.680
you know, I'm very disappointed that we don't have Final Fantasy 13 yet or even a demo of

12:41.680 --> 12:46.680
it as they promised us before but all this stuff keeps getting pushed back.

12:46.680 --> 12:47.920
I love the bell idea though.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.080
It's because Sony and they can.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.080
Comments from chat.

12:51.080 --> 12:52.080
Chat.orangehonestradio.com.

12:52.080 --> 12:53.880
Rob D. would like to say, no it's not.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.760
It's very hard to get funding for an innovative game because it's a risk.

12:56.760 --> 12:59.760
There's a difference.

12:59.760 --> 13:00.760
So next email?

13:00.760 --> 13:01.760
Yes, please.

13:01.760 --> 13:02.760
That's the bell idea.

13:02.760 --> 13:03.760
We'll do that.

13:03.760 --> 13:04.760
Next email.

13:04.760 --> 13:05.760
This comes from Ospher.

13:05.760 --> 13:06.760
Dear Rob.

13:06.760 --> 13:10.920
Yeah, I said Rob but everyone else can chime in with their opinion if they wish to do so.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.840
You always talk about Final Fantasy 12 as such a great game.

13:13.840 --> 13:14.840
Why?

13:14.840 --> 13:17.980
What's so great about a game that has a boring political storyline?

13:17.980 --> 13:24.200
To me a great compelling story like Final Fantasy 7 and 10 are what make the games great.

13:24.200 --> 13:25.480
Also I don't like the battle system.

13:25.480 --> 13:26.720
It's way too much like World of Warcraft.

13:26.720 --> 13:30.240
I prefer the strategic system like in Final Fantasy 10.

13:30.240 --> 13:33.440
Speaking of which, Final Fantasy 10 needs more praise.

13:33.440 --> 13:37.680
For me it's the best game in the series and one of the few games I have ever pulled an

13:37.680 --> 13:38.800
all-nighter on.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.760
Why the story is freaking epic.

13:40.760 --> 13:42.560
It's compelled me to keep playing.

13:42.560 --> 13:45.720
I also love the battle system and don't really mind the random battles.

13:45.720 --> 13:47.960
Final Fantasy 10 too wasn't that bad either.

13:47.960 --> 13:52.960
People just need to quit complaining about Yuna singing which I think is really good.

13:52.960 --> 13:56.560
A Thousand Words is an amazing song.

13:56.560 --> 14:00.240
The only thing that made me sad is that Final Fantasy 10 too likes summons but oh well.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.240
Thanks for reading Ospher.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.240
I agree.

14:02.240 --> 14:07.960
It's 12 is actually one of the Final Fantasy games I have not played.

14:07.960 --> 14:13.040
I just have no, it doesn't, I don't know, it just doesn't.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.660
You know I don't know how else to say it.

14:14.660 --> 14:17.160
I enjoyed the story.

14:17.160 --> 14:20.700
Sometimes you watch a movie that one person doesn't like but another person likes.

14:20.700 --> 14:24.400
I would agree though that 10 is sometimes underrated by the community as a whole and

14:24.400 --> 14:26.120
gets a lot of shit that it doesn't deserve.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.120
I love 10.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.120
10 had a great story.

14:28.120 --> 14:31.680
But I don't think the battle system, I mean the battle system in 12 to me is what makes

14:31.680 --> 14:32.680
it so great.

14:32.680 --> 14:33.760
It's not the story that makes 12 great.

14:33.760 --> 14:35.240
I think the battle system is what makes it great.

14:35.240 --> 14:36.240
I hate the battle system.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.240
Really?

14:37.240 --> 14:38.480
It's not like WoW to me.

14:38.480 --> 14:41.920
It's more like Final Fantasy 11 but with people that you can control.

14:41.920 --> 14:46.120
What I've gone through with the story so far, I actually like political stories.

14:46.120 --> 14:48.760
I love things that make you think.

14:48.760 --> 14:52.920
You know and maybe, I don't know if that, I'm not trying to be rude or anything but

14:52.920 --> 14:58.320
sometimes people don't like stories that require a lot of, I would have to say, logical thought

14:58.320 --> 15:00.420
as opposed to emotional thought.

15:00.420 --> 15:01.420
You know what I mean?

15:01.420 --> 15:02.680
Well, a good game takes both.

15:02.680 --> 15:07.200
A good battle schematic and a play schematic and story.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.200
And here's the thing.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.200
I'm going to use 8 as an example.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.960
I can't fucking stand Final Fantasy 8 and it has nothing to do with the story because

15:12.960 --> 15:16.700
I think the story is awesome and I kind of wish they would have made the story what they

15:16.700 --> 15:19.120
ended up making the movie, Final Fantasy the movie.

15:19.120 --> 15:23.160
But my problem with Final Fantasy 8 is that the battles and the whole junctioning magic

15:23.160 --> 15:25.440
and all that shit ruined the game for me.

15:25.440 --> 15:27.880
Single-handedly ruined the game and could not stand the battle system at 8.

15:27.880 --> 15:28.880
Couldn't stand it.

15:28.880 --> 15:31.840
So I didn't want to play through it.

15:31.840 --> 15:32.840
See, 8.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.200
I kind of liked the junctioning.

15:34.200 --> 15:39.280
I mean, I really, really liked having to draw your spells.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.280
Drawing magic.

15:40.280 --> 15:41.280
It hits a nerve.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.280
I liked it.

15:42.280 --> 15:43.280
I couldn't stand it.

15:43.280 --> 15:44.280
I liked that part of it.

15:44.280 --> 15:47.160
But by the time I got to the third disc and was trying to put together my weapons and

15:47.160 --> 15:50.120
shit, I was like, BORED NOW!

15:50.120 --> 15:52.080
So I watched someone else beat it and didn't have to.

15:52.080 --> 15:55.200
I had already gotten all the other cool cutscenes anyway.

15:55.200 --> 15:58.320
That's why I said before I got to the end of the first disc, I'm like, ugh.

15:58.320 --> 16:00.000
The second disc had some cool crap in it.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.360
Had the Ultimatia battles and all that.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.720
I don't really like when the monster is level with you either.

16:05.720 --> 16:06.720
I don't know.

16:06.720 --> 16:07.720
Yeah, no, that was kind of...

16:07.720 --> 16:08.720
That kind of thing bugs me.

16:08.720 --> 16:09.720
I don't know why.

16:09.720 --> 16:14.400
I like being able to go to so and such area and knowing what to expect.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.400
You know.

16:15.400 --> 16:21.040
But then again, this next email, if we are ready.

16:21.040 --> 16:22.040
It's from RobWithTwoBees.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.040
Yes, ma'am.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.040
Oh, I haven't heard from him in a while.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.040
Hooray for RobWithTwoBees.

16:26.040 --> 16:28.040
Well, he sent us a few stories, but...

16:28.040 --> 16:32.000
And sometimes we try to work them into the show role, but, you know.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Oh, here we go.

16:33.000 --> 16:38.320
I haven't said this in a while, but the latest Xbox Live Arcade title, is it Genom or Genom?

16:38.320 --> 16:40.640
I guess it would be Genom if you were using proper pronunciation.

16:40.640 --> 16:42.680
Oh, that's the one I mentioned in part A.

16:42.680 --> 16:43.760
I think that was the name.

16:43.760 --> 16:46.000
Had everything right except for fun.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.400
It just isn't fun to me.

16:47.400 --> 16:51.320
I'm hoping I missed something, but the whole collection of dots is arbitrary and making

16:51.320 --> 16:55.680
them in... and then making it an arena game competitive dot eating.

16:55.680 --> 16:56.680
Rob?

16:56.680 --> 16:58.640
No, I kind of agree.

16:58.640 --> 17:02.360
I mean, the game... let's just say I did not jump up and want to spend 10 bucks on this

17:02.360 --> 17:03.360
game.

17:03.360 --> 17:04.960
I mean, I just... I don't know.

17:04.960 --> 17:05.960
You're right.

17:05.960 --> 17:10.480
It's just... it's like all the parts are there, but the whole they'd add up to.

17:10.480 --> 17:11.480
It's just...

17:11.480 --> 17:15.320
It's like when you look at $10, you know, spending on that game and you're saying, hmm,

17:15.320 --> 17:19.760
look, Res HD is coming out at some point and Ikaruga and all that stuff.

17:19.760 --> 17:20.760
It's like...

17:20.760 --> 17:21.760
Ikaruga?

17:21.760 --> 17:24.080
Yeah, I don't know if I want to spend $10 on this one.

17:24.080 --> 17:26.600
I can buy that for probably about $10 as well, so...

17:26.600 --> 17:29.840
That's a damn fine point.

17:29.840 --> 17:30.840
That's it.

17:30.840 --> 17:31.840
Ikaruga.

17:31.840 --> 17:34.880
Um, next email, shall I?

17:34.880 --> 17:35.880
You shall.

17:35.880 --> 17:40.800
Dear Our Lady of the Rosary, OLR, video game missionaries, howdy, I have two questions

17:40.800 --> 17:41.800
for you fine people.

17:41.800 --> 17:42.800
What?

17:42.800 --> 17:43.800
I don't know.

17:43.800 --> 17:44.800
Okay.

17:44.800 --> 17:45.800
Someone be creative.

17:45.800 --> 17:46.800
Huh.

17:46.800 --> 17:47.800
What?

17:47.800 --> 17:48.800
That is certainly creative.

17:48.800 --> 17:49.800
I beat the ferret in your honor.

17:49.800 --> 17:52.280
And the ferret liked it.

17:52.280 --> 17:57.880
One, I once had a PS2, the original bigger kind, but it was getting a little spotty on

17:57.880 --> 18:01.360
playing some games and I wanted a GameCube anyway, so a couple of years ago I traded

18:01.360 --> 18:02.360
it in.

18:02.360 --> 18:03.680
But now I miss the Silent Hill games.

18:03.680 --> 18:04.680
Never finished two.

18:04.680 --> 18:06.440
Why haven't you finished two?

18:06.440 --> 18:07.840
It's the shortest one.

18:07.840 --> 18:08.840
Anyway.

18:08.840 --> 18:12.320
But I've been getting all nostalgic when you guys talk about them.

18:12.320 --> 18:17.540
And I want to play Final Fantasy XII, so I'm going to buy one, buy a used one online with

18:17.540 --> 18:18.540
some birthday money.

18:18.540 --> 18:22.220
However, I'll be getting a slim PS2 and I remember reading something about the slims

18:22.220 --> 18:24.300
getting too hot and frying the unit.

18:24.300 --> 18:29.120
My question is, do I have to worry about this with used slash refurb PS2s or have all the

18:29.120 --> 18:32.760
units in question been recalled or fixed at the time of refurbishment?

18:32.760 --> 18:36.240
If I do have to worry about this, is there some way I can tell if the unit I get is one

18:36.240 --> 18:38.040
of the models prone to overheating?

18:38.040 --> 18:43.200
That I personally do not know because I actually have our first PS2 still and it works just

18:43.200 --> 18:44.580
fine.

18:44.580 --> 18:50.140
And on top of that, I have a first model Japanese PS2 that works just fine, which is an oddity.

18:50.140 --> 18:51.140
You know what?

18:51.140 --> 18:52.140
Here's the thing.

18:52.140 --> 18:56.120
Any system is going to have some faulty ones, but you can take steps in making sure that

18:56.120 --> 18:58.760
the system is not going to fry itself and that would be, you know, make sure...

18:58.760 --> 18:59.920
Not buying it on eBay.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.600
Don't put it in an oven.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.780
Make sure it's in a well-ventilated place.

19:03.780 --> 19:05.560
You know, don't put it in a box.

19:05.560 --> 19:07.400
Take care of it when you move it around, you know.

19:07.400 --> 19:15.040
A suggestion I do have that came back from the Dreamcast days is if you have carpet or

19:15.040 --> 19:19.960
anything, put a flat surface down like, you know, a cutting board or something and then

19:19.960 --> 19:21.960
set your system on top of that.

19:21.960 --> 19:27.880
And that way it'll be elevated so that the vents, if the vents are underneath it, can

19:27.880 --> 19:28.880
get some...

19:28.880 --> 19:31.440
You're like the Martha Stewart of gaming.

19:31.440 --> 19:35.400
Well, you know, the Dreamcast did have a problem with getting a little too hot.

19:35.400 --> 19:37.220
Without the jail time.

19:37.220 --> 19:39.600
And without the bad hair.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.440
And without the fruits of the garden.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.440
No, my Slim PS2 works just fine.

19:43.440 --> 19:44.440
I've been using...

19:44.440 --> 19:47.800
I did not buy an American PS2 until the Slims were out.

19:47.800 --> 19:51.560
I only had a Japanese PlayStation 2 for the longest time.

19:51.560 --> 19:54.840
And I finally bought a US one when the Slims came out.

19:54.840 --> 19:58.000
So it works just fine for me still.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.680
So for whatever it's worth, there you have it.

20:01.680 --> 20:02.680
Shall I move forward?

20:02.680 --> 20:03.680
You shall.

20:03.680 --> 20:04.680
Yay.

20:04.680 --> 20:06.720
Oh, the second question by this person.

20:06.720 --> 20:10.600
One of my favorite games ever is Pokemon Snap and I've been hoping for years to make a sequel,

20:10.600 --> 20:11.600
but to no avail.

20:11.600 --> 20:18.160
Are there any other good photography themed games out there that you would recommend?

20:18.160 --> 20:22.480
I know Metal Gear Solid 2 had a camera and some of the Zelda games had minigames, but

20:22.480 --> 20:27.040
other than that, I don't know anything, especially with photography figures and largely.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.040
Keep on rocking.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.040
Ciao, Atreyu.

20:29.040 --> 20:30.040
I highly recommend.

20:30.040 --> 20:31.040
What's with Atreyu tonight?

20:31.040 --> 20:32.040
That's just...

20:32.040 --> 20:33.040
Atreyu.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.040
Wow.

20:34.040 --> 20:35.040
Say my name.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.040
Bashur.

20:36.040 --> 20:37.040
Hey, Bastion.

20:37.040 --> 20:38.040
What?

20:38.040 --> 20:41.760
I highly recommend Bioshock because you have to take pictures of dead bodies.

20:41.760 --> 20:42.760
Dead Rising.

20:42.760 --> 20:43.760
Dead Rising.

20:43.760 --> 20:44.760
Dead Rising.

20:44.760 --> 20:45.760
Dead Rising.

20:45.760 --> 20:46.760
An awesome photography mode in there.

20:46.760 --> 20:47.760
Good point.

20:47.760 --> 20:48.760
Yes.

20:48.760 --> 20:49.760
Eternal Sonata actually has...

20:49.760 --> 20:51.600
Don't get the card capture soccer at a game on Dreamcast.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.460
Eternal Sonata actually has a photograph.

20:53.460 --> 20:58.080
One of the characters, their special move, they can take photos and you can control what's

20:58.080 --> 21:01.860
taken a picture of and you can sell the photos at shops and the better the picture, the more

21:01.860 --> 21:02.860
they sell for.

21:02.860 --> 21:03.860
Here's the thing.

21:03.860 --> 21:07.280
One of the things I should have said was one of my kind of complaints about the game.

21:07.280 --> 21:10.720
It totally throws the game off balance.

21:10.720 --> 21:15.000
Weapons and things and the part of the game I'm in are like 800 gold, 1,000 gold maybe.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.640
You can sell one picture for 14,000 gold.

21:19.640 --> 21:24.400
Gold is not a factor in this game if you just take 10 pictures and sell them all.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.280
They don't even have to be that good at pictures.

21:26.280 --> 21:30.000
That's one other little bitch I have about Eternal Sonata is that I think somebody threw

21:30.000 --> 21:34.080
the photo system way out of whack in testing.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.080
Next email?

21:36.080 --> 21:41.400
I'm not certain but I believe this is something else from Rob about the man who died after

21:41.400 --> 21:44.180
three days straight in the internet cafe in China.

21:44.180 --> 21:47.160
The game he played was Online Bridge.

21:47.160 --> 21:53.440
How unexciting but it shows that it's self neglect from obsession, not an MMO or other

21:53.440 --> 21:54.440
game.

21:54.440 --> 21:55.440
Good point.

21:55.440 --> 21:58.240
Because most of us automatically think, oh, he was playing Warcraft.

21:58.240 --> 22:00.520
No, he was playing Bridge.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.360
These people who do online poker or something.

22:02.360 --> 22:03.360
It's Final Fantasy XI.

22:03.360 --> 22:04.360
It was Evercrack.

22:04.360 --> 22:05.360
Evercrack takes another soul.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.120
Nope, it was Online Bridge.

22:07.120 --> 22:11.800
Hoyle is deadly.

22:11.800 --> 22:12.800
So shall I keep going?

22:12.800 --> 22:13.800
You shall.

22:13.800 --> 22:17.880
Dear OLR, I recently joined a game rental service and decided to rent out Earth Defense

22:17.880 --> 22:23.040
Force, although it was the PS2 version since I don't have a 360, to find out whether Loki's

22:23.040 --> 22:25.880
claims were accurate or not and they are sort of.

22:25.880 --> 22:26.880
The game is fun.

22:26.880 --> 22:31.200
It's really fun destroying armies of ants, sorry, gigant horse, is supremely satisfying

22:31.200 --> 22:35.720
and the way that you can mold the battlegrounds by destroying the infected city is genius.

22:35.720 --> 22:40.700
The variation in weapon types gives the game an element of strategy and all loads extremely

22:40.700 --> 22:43.920
quickly very useful on some difficulty levels.

22:43.920 --> 22:48.400
I forgot I played more of Earth Defense Force this week as well.

22:48.400 --> 22:51.880
Maybe you're just so used to it that it just blends in with the rest of your schedule.

22:51.880 --> 22:52.880
Yeah.

22:52.880 --> 22:57.320
The game's budget nature is very obvious from the horrible color scheme that makes some

22:57.320 --> 23:02.040
levels look like big piles of sludge to the plot, which is basic to say the least.

23:02.040 --> 23:06.720
It's common to find the alien invaders trapped in the scenery while the variations in enemy

23:06.720 --> 23:09.040
types are small and uninteresting visually.

23:09.040 --> 23:14.160
There are some that fly, some that shoot suspicious looking brown stuff from their bottoms, but

23:14.160 --> 23:16.120
in the end, they're all ants.

23:16.120 --> 23:19.360
Whether these problems are dealt with in the sequel, I don't know, but they don't detract

23:19.360 --> 23:20.480
from the game too much.

23:20.480 --> 23:24.000
Put simply, the game is a grown-up version of squashing armies of ants like I did when

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
I was a kid.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.780
The squashing ants never seems to get old.

23:26.780 --> 23:30.800
The Afro guy.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.440
I still have yet to play Earth Defense Force.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.600
I'm going to have to check it out.

23:33.600 --> 23:39.760
I'm telling you, they need, and there's another story we can get to later, they need to bring

23:39.760 --> 23:45.560
out the other PlayStation 2 games and convert them over to be able to be played on some

23:45.560 --> 23:50.460
of these systems over here because seriously, all the games have been almost exactly the

23:50.460 --> 23:55.320
same, just different locations and stuff, but I don't think they get old at all.

23:55.320 --> 23:59.480
It's still a very scary thought to me that our reviews and suggestions on games actually

23:59.480 --> 24:00.480
influence people.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.480
It's kind of scary.

24:02.480 --> 24:06.680
Well, speaking of someone wanting some influence, we got an email from the doctor.

24:06.680 --> 24:07.680
All right.

24:07.680 --> 24:08.680
Hooray.

24:08.680 --> 24:10.880
I love the doctor.

24:10.880 --> 24:11.880
So I'm going to read it.

24:11.880 --> 24:14.120
Hello, I've been somewhat busy.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.520
Do you guys remember Shadow of Destiny for the PS2?

24:16.520 --> 24:19.940
I can't find it in any GameStop or EB games and I really want to play it again.

24:19.940 --> 24:22.600
If you guys remember it, could you possibly give me your thoughts on the game?

24:22.600 --> 24:24.140
I didn't play it.

24:24.140 --> 24:26.920
And to DarkSakura, I got me a Sonic Screwdriver pen and I love it.

24:26.920 --> 24:29.960
I use it at work to write with him and pretend I'm the doctor.

24:29.960 --> 24:32.040
I have a Sonic Screwdriver too.

24:32.040 --> 24:36.520
One of our listeners sent it to me and I love our listener now forever.

24:36.520 --> 24:38.320
I saw the Dalek the other night too.

24:38.320 --> 24:44.040
Yes, I have the remote control Dalek that goes for like $100 on eBay and I got it for

24:44.040 --> 24:45.040
$40.

24:45.040 --> 24:46.040
Nice.

24:46.040 --> 24:47.840
Oh, we got another email at the end and it's from Warrior Bob.

24:47.840 --> 24:48.840
Wait, hold on.

24:48.840 --> 24:49.840
Shadow of Destiny?

24:49.840 --> 24:51.440
I didn't play it either.

24:51.440 --> 24:52.440
That's kind of weird.

24:52.440 --> 24:53.640
There's like this one game we totally like all missed.

24:53.640 --> 24:57.360
I was trying to look up screenshots but our net's running slow because of the webcam,

24:57.360 --> 24:58.760
so oh well.

24:58.760 --> 25:01.320
Well, I'm going to read.

25:01.320 --> 25:05.520
Since Warrior Bob got this email in right before, I'm going to read it too because Warrior

25:05.520 --> 25:07.560
Bob is like my hero.

25:07.560 --> 25:08.560
Shall I?

25:08.560 --> 25:09.560
Sure.

25:09.560 --> 25:13.800
Dear OLR, I got to play Rockman this week during the demo at Sac State.

25:13.800 --> 25:16.760
By now I'm sure you've heard plenty about the game and I won't bug you further but I

25:16.760 --> 25:20.480
discovered some things that I thought might be of interest to you, more veteran music

25:20.480 --> 25:21.480
game fans.

25:21.480 --> 25:25.360
This is a long email so feel free to edit as you choose if you read it out loud.

25:25.360 --> 25:30.120
First the game implements what used to be called guessing penalty.

25:30.120 --> 25:34.200
Any extra inputs you make beyond what is required of you are counted against you and reset your

25:34.200 --> 25:35.200
combo.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.200
Good.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.740
Fans of drum mania or keyboard mania will notice this first as those two games let you

25:38.740 --> 25:42.640
hit as many extra notes as you wanted to without penalizing you and therefore let you improvise

25:42.640 --> 25:43.640
a bit.

25:43.640 --> 25:47.960
It's a command you can't improvise until you're told to, except sometimes on vocals.

25:47.960 --> 25:53.600
Second, the drum pedal on the pre-release units works just like in arcade drum mania.

25:53.600 --> 25:57.280
It's big, has a long throw and relatively little resistance and it triggers somewhere

25:57.280 --> 26:00.080
near the end of its throw but not all the way at the end.

26:00.080 --> 26:02.160
No quick bass rolls with your toes here.

26:02.160 --> 26:08.400
Third, the drum pedals connect to the main unit by a 1-8 inch mono foam plugs, basically

26:08.400 --> 26:10.840
the mono headphone jack.

26:10.840 --> 26:14.120
These work electrically like I think they do, you should be able to wire two of them

26:14.120 --> 26:18.020
in parallel using a mono headphone splitter and make a double bass so that you can be

26:18.020 --> 26:20.120
the god of thunder.

26:20.120 --> 26:23.480
I asked a harmonics dev about this and he said he will try it at the office and get

26:23.480 --> 26:24.480
back to me.

26:24.480 --> 26:25.920
Fourth, biorite sucks.

26:25.920 --> 26:27.640
Yes, they do.

26:27.640 --> 26:30.800
Fifth, there is a crazy advanced slide compensation tool built in-

26:30.800 --> 26:33.600
Wait, he just threw that in the middle there?

26:33.600 --> 26:34.600
Yes, it's true.

26:34.600 --> 26:35.600
This is why you love Warrior Bob.

26:35.600 --> 26:36.600
It's damn true.

26:36.600 --> 26:38.480
Didn't they go out of business?

26:38.480 --> 26:39.480
I think so.

26:39.480 --> 26:40.480
Then stop hatin'.

26:40.480 --> 26:41.480
Stop hatin'.

26:41.480 --> 26:42.480
I still hate them, Rob.

26:42.480 --> 26:48.680
Fifth, there is a crazy advanced slide compensation tool built in case your TV internally de-syncs

26:48.680 --> 26:49.680
audio and video.

26:49.680 --> 26:50.680
I love harmonics.

26:50.680 --> 26:54.400
Lastly, the new guitar buttons and switches feel very solid and responsive.

26:54.400 --> 26:59.160
This drum bar is a bit longer now and does not use clicky micro switches but still seems

26:59.160 --> 27:00.160
to be pretty accurate.

27:00.160 --> 27:04.600
I have experimentally verified that it works well played behind your head and between your

27:04.600 --> 27:05.600
legs.

27:05.600 --> 27:08.360
Looking forward to your next show tonight, Warrior Bob.

27:08.360 --> 27:13.520
Yes, see, mine must have been busted from constant use or something.

27:13.520 --> 27:14.520
Someone must have broke it.

27:14.520 --> 27:20.560
Who knows what kind of, I don't know, drunk middle-aged people were playing it at the

27:20.560 --> 27:24.160
event that I went to, but it's fun.

27:24.160 --> 27:25.880
Sounds like fun.

27:25.880 --> 27:27.320
Is that it for email?

27:27.320 --> 27:28.720
That be all, sir.

27:28.720 --> 27:29.720
Goodbye, email bag.

27:29.720 --> 27:30.720
R.

27:30.720 --> 27:31.720
Send us more.

27:31.720 --> 27:32.720
Mailbag, orange.onstrator.com.

27:32.720 --> 27:33.720
You know what we have missed, though?

27:33.720 --> 27:34.720
What?

27:34.720 --> 27:35.720
Talk Like a Pirate Day?

27:35.720 --> 27:36.720
Talk Like a Pirate Day.

27:36.720 --> 27:37.720
I was just thinking because you said R. I was like, did you celebrate?

27:37.720 --> 27:42.760
I did by making a one-line comment in my live journal.

27:42.760 --> 27:43.760
It was Talk Like a Pirate Day.

27:43.760 --> 27:48.880
I was off that day, so I made a pirate and slept in my cabin.

27:48.880 --> 27:51.520
I was doing other pirate related things.

27:51.520 --> 27:53.880
I was pirating comic books.

27:53.880 --> 27:59.240
I sent an email to all my coworkers with something from I Can Ask Cheeseburger that I said you

27:59.240 --> 28:02.720
better have a good and productive work day today or else I'm going to send you to the

28:02.720 --> 28:07.080
captain because it was Talk Like a Pirate Day and it was a little kitty that had a little

28:07.080 --> 28:08.720
hook and a pirate hat on it.

28:08.720 --> 28:09.720
I know that picture.

28:09.720 --> 28:10.720
It said something like...

28:10.720 --> 28:11.720
I can have booty.

28:11.720 --> 28:14.400
No, it said something like, why you laughing?

28:14.400 --> 28:15.400
Walk plank.

28:15.400 --> 28:16.400
Or I said walk plank or something like that.

28:16.400 --> 28:18.440
It was really funny, so I sent that to my coworkers.

28:18.440 --> 28:19.440
That's how I celebrated.

28:19.440 --> 28:20.440
Yeah, I'm lame.

28:20.440 --> 28:21.440
Shut up.

28:21.440 --> 28:22.440
Let's see.

28:22.440 --> 28:23.440
I was going to chat.

28:23.440 --> 28:24.440
Oh, yeah.

28:24.440 --> 28:29.120
Chat's commenting on things that they're watching on the operator 11 feed and Phildo wants to

28:29.120 --> 28:33.160
know why doesn't Loki get a comfy chair because Loki gets one of the kitchen chairs to sit

28:33.160 --> 28:34.160
in here.

28:34.160 --> 28:35.160
They can't...

28:35.160 --> 28:36.160
It's a far sight more comfy than the one that was there.

28:36.160 --> 28:40.640
Yeah, the unfortunate one that was here is this crappy computer desk chair that was actually

28:40.640 --> 28:45.480
slanted forward and had even less padding than this piece of wood.

28:45.480 --> 28:49.120
Now I know I'm not supposed to show Jamie on the cam and I won't, but I can show that

28:49.120 --> 28:52.400
she gets a fancy little blue chair to sit on.

28:52.400 --> 28:55.800
So you can see I'm showing her feet on the footstool.

28:55.800 --> 28:59.920
You can see this fancy little chair that she gets to sit in and that's why Loki has to

28:59.920 --> 29:06.320
take the crappy chair because the woman took the nice chair, I guess, is how it goes.

29:06.320 --> 29:09.640
So there you have it.

29:09.640 --> 29:15.240
Anyhow, moving on to another story because I don't want this to turn into too much TV

29:15.240 --> 29:18.640
or else folks are going to go crazy.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.640
Loki, what's up next?

29:20.640 --> 29:28.040
Anywho, so of course pretty soon we're going to be getting a Project Gotham Racing 4 demo

29:28.040 --> 29:32.200
and it's going to have content, I guess, that's exclusive to the demo itself.

29:32.200 --> 29:37.600
In fact, I guess there's supposed to be some electric versus gas engine race that they're

29:37.600 --> 29:38.600
going to be doing.

29:38.600 --> 29:44.280
There's also going to be arcade mode, which is going to be exclusive to it, set in Makau,

29:44.280 --> 29:49.560
I guess, Makau, and it's going to feature exclusive challenges.

29:49.560 --> 29:53.840
So I guess that's kind of neat that it's going to have that.

29:53.840 --> 30:01.680
They're also going to feature a time trial for, it looks like a Nurburgring Snow and

30:01.680 --> 30:09.160
it's, yeah, it says it's due out, well the game I know is due out in what, two weeks?

30:09.160 --> 30:11.760
So the demo's got to be coming out here pretty soon I'd imagine.

30:11.760 --> 30:14.920
It's kind of weird that the demo would have something special.

30:14.920 --> 30:21.240
It would be kind of cool if whatever content was in the demo you could get in the game

30:21.240 --> 30:23.160
because you downloaded the demo.

30:23.160 --> 30:24.160
Like some type of unlock.

30:24.160 --> 30:25.160
I don't know.

30:25.160 --> 30:30.520
Well it's just like what they did with, what was it, Ninja Gaiden Sigma, where you earn

30:30.520 --> 30:37.480
money in the game and then you can transfer it over to your save on the full retail version.

30:37.480 --> 30:40.080
Interesting.

30:40.080 --> 30:46.480
Well, one thing on the Xbox 360 that some folks were doing on Talk Like a Pirate Day

30:46.480 --> 30:51.360
was doing some piracy of their own and it was leaking Halo 3 onto the internet.

30:51.360 --> 30:58.080
Yes, that's right, Halo 3 made its way to some where's sites, 6.14 gigabytes is how

30:58.080 --> 31:00.760
big the game clocks in as.

31:00.760 --> 31:06.540
And of course, you know, kind of sucks that people are doing this and taking away from

31:06.540 --> 31:10.520
the folks that have spent so much hard time and effort developing the game.

31:10.520 --> 31:15.680
But at the same time, kind of impressive that they did it that fast.

31:15.680 --> 31:19.320
But yeah, that's just a gift for releasing the game.

31:19.320 --> 31:22.640
Well also, you know it's only going to be a matter of time before Microsoft figures

31:22.640 --> 31:24.880
out how it's done and puts a little ban on it.

31:24.880 --> 31:28.720
Or did they finally figure out some way that Microsoft can't patch its way out of?

31:28.720 --> 31:32.000
Because I thought Microsoft liked to put down the ban hammer on this stuff and patch it.

31:32.000 --> 31:37.160
There's ways, I guess, because I don't pirate 360 games, so there's ways I've read that

31:37.160 --> 31:40.280
you can patch the game where it's undetectable.

31:40.280 --> 31:44.960
I think all of it's done, I mean it's going to be hard for them to do that because they

31:44.960 --> 31:49.280
have some sort of encryption on there, so if that's cracked, then the only other thing

31:49.280 --> 31:53.920
is there's a media detector or something like that that detects whether you're playing

31:53.920 --> 32:01.120
a CD-R, a DVD-R, a press CD, DVD, etc.

32:01.120 --> 32:06.060
And if you can change that, if you can get that to go over so that makes a DVD-R look

32:06.060 --> 32:11.820
like a press DVD, then really the system's going to have no way of telling whether that's

32:11.820 --> 32:19.840
a burned disc or an actual copy of Halo 3.

32:19.840 --> 32:25.200
At one point, it is going to be impossible to stop it unless they change up something

32:25.200 --> 32:27.240
else or that you can't crack them.

32:27.240 --> 32:31.480
Remember, for the longest time, PlayStation 2 games, with that bad blocks that they put

32:31.480 --> 32:35.800
on there so that you can't burn them, that stopped people for a while, but eventually

32:35.800 --> 32:40.000
they figured out how to get around that, so it's only a matter of time before that happens,

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
if it hasn't already.

32:41.000 --> 32:45.400
Yeah, but, I mean, when they try to take these things online, won't it kind of screw it

32:45.400 --> 32:46.400
up?

32:46.400 --> 32:50.900
No, I mean, the game, if they don't, if the system can't tell that it's not an official

32:50.900 --> 32:53.720
game, then no, there won't be any problems.

32:53.720 --> 33:00.520
It's if you run a special firmware or something that disables that checking, that's when

33:00.520 --> 33:05.680
you're going to run into problems, but if the system itself cannot tell that, you know,

33:05.680 --> 33:11.160
it's a burned copy and you haven't modified it in any way, then, yeah, you will be able

33:11.160 --> 33:12.720
to get away with it.

33:12.720 --> 33:13.720
Hmm.

33:13.720 --> 33:14.720
Interesting.

33:14.720 --> 33:20.320
All right, well, I imagine, though, it's just a small percentage, a very, very, very small

33:20.320 --> 33:23.600
percentage of people that are able to get away with this, and the game will still sell

33:23.600 --> 33:25.000
like hotcakes the day it was released.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.520
Yeah, they're going to make tons of money.

33:26.520 --> 33:27.760
That's not a problem.

33:27.760 --> 33:31.600
And besides, the people that are pirating it probably had no intention to buy it in

33:31.600 --> 33:32.600
the first place.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.200
And, Loki, you did not get banned for playing Halo 3 early, right?

33:35.200 --> 33:36.520
No, I did not.

33:36.520 --> 33:39.800
The only thing, here's the only thing that they did do is the matchmaking servers aren't

33:39.800 --> 33:42.360
up, so you can't play online.

33:42.360 --> 33:44.240
Oh, noes.

33:44.240 --> 33:45.240
Right now.

33:45.240 --> 33:47.240
Until they start them.

33:47.240 --> 33:54.360
Well, something that you can play online on Xbox Live is Viva Pinata Party, the demo is

33:54.360 --> 33:55.360
up.

33:55.360 --> 33:58.760
No, Viva Pinata Party Animals is up, I'm sorry.

33:58.760 --> 34:04.320
It's 971.17 megabytes.

34:04.320 --> 34:08.360
It's basically a big minigame compilation, and it's, of course, by Rare.

34:08.360 --> 34:13.600
So the official game is going to be out by Christmas with over 40 minigames, and you

34:13.600 --> 34:20.040
can burp boats down a stream and smash up gardens.

34:20.040 --> 34:21.720
Wow.

34:21.720 --> 34:24.120
Burping boats is just so much fun, you know.

34:24.120 --> 34:29.120
It's a, I think it's a racing game mixed with minigames.

34:29.120 --> 34:33.280
Escapist in our chatroom asks, will someone be proposing on that one as well?

34:33.280 --> 34:36.960
You know, funny story.

34:36.960 --> 34:40.700
Sometimes I forget that there's actually quite a few people who listen to this program, not

34:40.700 --> 34:44.240
to sound like you could do this or whatever, but when we first started the program, we

34:44.240 --> 34:47.340
were lucky to get like 15 people listening to our show.

34:47.340 --> 34:51.600
And since we've been doing the podcast, the numbers have climbed a little bit.

34:51.600 --> 34:55.560
And you remember last week we did that story about the guy who got engaged on Viva Pinata.

34:55.560 --> 34:56.560
Well, guess what?

34:56.560 --> 34:57.840
He sent us a message on MySpace.

34:57.840 --> 34:58.840
Did he?

34:58.840 --> 35:00.080
Yes, he did.

35:00.080 --> 35:04.760
He said, he actually wants to come on the show to, what did he say, correct some of

35:04.760 --> 35:09.760
the things that the bloggers who, you know, live with their parents and stay at home all

35:09.760 --> 35:11.000
day got wrong.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
And I'm like, great.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.520
I totally want to hear it from the horse's mouth.

35:13.520 --> 35:15.600
So I'm hoping we have him on next week or soon.

35:15.600 --> 35:20.480
I wanted to get him on this week, but he really wanted to do an interview on iChat, and unfortunately

35:20.480 --> 35:24.560
the way we're wired where we have the Mac laptop does our Operate 11 stuff and the PC

35:24.560 --> 35:28.120
does most of the audio here, it just wouldn't work for me to do iChat.

35:28.120 --> 35:31.060
But I'm hoping we can call him this week and get him on the show next week.

35:31.060 --> 35:36.440
So if you're listening, Mr. Pinata, let's make that interview happen this week so you

35:36.440 --> 35:37.440
can clear the air.

35:37.440 --> 35:41.040
I still think it's kind of retarded, but we'll go a little bit there.

35:41.040 --> 35:46.200
It's like there's people who propose, though, on the big screens, though, but that I sort

35:46.200 --> 35:49.120
of feel like you're pressuring someone into saying yes.

35:49.120 --> 35:50.120
Well it's just...

35:50.120 --> 35:52.460
It's in a public place like that?

35:52.460 --> 35:53.460
But I don't think it was.

35:53.460 --> 35:54.460
It was in their home.

35:54.460 --> 35:55.600
Well, if it's in their home, that's one thing.

35:55.600 --> 35:57.440
Well, we'll find out soon.

35:57.440 --> 36:00.880
We're going to ask all the questions.

36:00.880 --> 36:07.480
Part of me kind of goes, is this really big to be on all these different blogs?

36:07.480 --> 36:10.800
I mean, this is kind of a private matter in a way, but I don't know.

36:10.800 --> 36:11.800
We'll see.

36:11.800 --> 36:12.800
We'll see.

36:12.800 --> 36:13.800
We'll get our questions answered.

36:13.800 --> 36:15.440
I'm excited.

36:15.440 --> 36:18.360
Back to the gaming news, then.

36:18.360 --> 36:19.360
Yes.

36:19.360 --> 36:25.520
Anyways, one thing I'm excited about, as I hinted before, the Simple series is possibly

36:25.520 --> 36:29.160
coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

36:29.160 --> 36:36.600
According to some digging done during Tokyo Game Show, the Simple 2000 series, which of

36:36.600 --> 36:42.320
course brought us wonderful games, much like Earth Defense Force, they're talking about

36:42.320 --> 36:48.980
releasing some of them on, of course, the online service, and possibly also the Playstation

36:48.980 --> 36:50.480
network as well.

36:50.480 --> 36:55.680
And according to Kotaku's article here, it says they're asking about the possibility

36:55.680 --> 37:03.200
of the series turning up as downloadable titles, and they said that they had two cheap, easy

37:03.200 --> 37:09.960
games coming out on Xbox Live Arcade soon, so maybe we'll see some more stuff from that

37:09.960 --> 37:10.960
series come over.

37:10.960 --> 37:15.880
I hope they port some of that stuff, because there's some weird shit over there, like Zombies

37:15.880 --> 37:21.400
versus Abulances, and more shit like that.

37:21.400 --> 37:22.400
Awesome.

37:22.400 --> 37:23.400
Gotta love it.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.320
Well, you gotta love this, too.

37:25.320 --> 37:27.320
I know Loki loves this.

37:27.320 --> 37:28.520
Lesbians!

37:28.520 --> 37:30.200
I do love me some lesbians.

37:30.200 --> 37:31.200
Oh, lesbians.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.680
Then you'll definitely want to pick up Mass Effect.

37:32.680 --> 37:33.800
I was already going to pick it up.

37:33.800 --> 37:35.360
It's like the icing on the cake.

37:35.360 --> 37:39.880
Well, apparently, Mass Effect has been causing some waves in the gaming blogs and the gaming

37:39.880 --> 37:46.000
news sites this week, because apparently, if you play as a female character, there is

37:46.000 --> 37:49.960
a sex scene that you can initiate in the game, and you can initiate this scene between her

37:49.960 --> 37:54.200
and a male human or a female humanoid alien.

37:54.200 --> 37:57.960
So you get some female on female action.

37:57.960 --> 37:58.960
But here's the thing, though.

37:58.960 --> 38:04.020
You can also play as a male character, however, a male character can only initiate sex between

38:04.020 --> 38:10.000
him and a human woman or the humanoid female alien.

38:10.000 --> 38:14.360
So no man sex, but Lesbo's okay.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.360
But surprise, butt sex is great.

38:16.360 --> 38:19.400
Well, here's another thing, okay?

38:19.400 --> 38:20.400
Just a thought.

38:20.400 --> 38:24.040
Maybe the storyline, it's between these two women anyways.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.820
It's either pick one or the other, something like that.

38:26.820 --> 38:31.240
Maybe because your character, they didn't make a branching type of storyline or something

38:31.240 --> 38:32.280
for this one part.

38:32.280 --> 38:33.280
I see.

38:33.280 --> 38:37.360
So you're saying this lesbian sex is for artistic and story purposes?

38:37.360 --> 38:40.960
It's like the character in the game or something.

38:40.960 --> 38:45.760
For example, wasn't there something in Knights of the Old Republic or Jade Empire or something

38:45.760 --> 38:47.840
like that where they had something similar?

38:47.840 --> 38:53.080
I think it was Knights of the Old Republic II or maybe the first one, where if you played

38:53.080 --> 38:56.520
as a female character, then yeah, it would be a lesbian.

38:56.520 --> 38:59.820
Almost like your partner or something had some love interest with you, and so it's sort

38:59.820 --> 39:02.080
of lesbian since you're playing as a female character.

39:02.080 --> 39:05.840
But really what it was is that they didn't program any different responses between a

39:05.840 --> 39:08.200
male and female character.

39:08.200 --> 39:16.120
Well, even though I still really want this game, the lack of man sex makes this gay man

39:16.120 --> 39:17.200
a little bit angsty.

39:17.200 --> 39:18.200
So you know what that means.

39:18.200 --> 39:21.640
It's time to bring on the FUs of the week!

39:21.640 --> 39:33.080
Dr. Sakura, why don't you start us off?

39:33.080 --> 39:36.760
I know lack of gay sex makes you mad.

39:36.760 --> 39:45.720
Well, yeah, but FU to male drivers, especially stupid old men, and men who drive big trucks

39:45.720 --> 39:48.000
and SUVs.

39:48.000 --> 39:52.640
Every last bad driver I've encountered on the road has been male.

39:52.640 --> 39:57.100
First of all, when I was picking up Dan from the airport yesterday, there was a guy driving

39:57.100 --> 40:03.480
in Altima, and he was drifting into my lane, and I didn't know if he was just changing

40:03.480 --> 40:07.700
lanes without signaling or if he was just old and stupid.

40:07.700 --> 40:12.960
He seemed to me in about middle age, but he almost bumped me off the road until I banged

40:12.960 --> 40:15.360
on the horn, and his wife shook him awake.

40:15.360 --> 40:20.440
He couldn't have been more than 50, so he wasn't that old.

40:20.440 --> 40:24.840
But I was like, you stupid man!

40:24.840 --> 40:29.640
And then this guy driving a truck, cutting off everybody in front of him, just being

40:29.640 --> 40:35.440
an asshole driver, which I consider being an asshole driver is pretty much equivalent

40:35.440 --> 40:40.220
with being a bad driver, because you're supposed to maintain your cool and calm on the road.

40:40.220 --> 40:43.720
And if you do get angry, you're not supposed to let it affect how you drive.

40:43.720 --> 40:48.080
This guy was cutting off everybody left and right, he made one car swerve, and I did thankfully

40:48.080 --> 40:50.840
get to see him get pulled over.

40:50.840 --> 40:54.400
I saw an asshole driver get pulled over this week, and it was very satisfying.

40:54.400 --> 40:59.540
And then, you know, I saw so many people just changing lanes without signaling, and almost

40:59.540 --> 41:04.340
causing accidents, and you know, every last one of them happened to be male.

41:04.340 --> 41:09.120
So I would like to point out there that bad drivers are bad drivers regardless of gender,

41:09.120 --> 41:10.920
shut the fuck up.

41:10.920 --> 41:12.800
Next, please.

41:12.800 --> 41:18.240
Anyways, I didn't really have anything to make an FU for, but now I do!

41:18.240 --> 41:23.720
So um, yes, once again, women drivers, horrible, in fact, I bet that guy falling asleep is

41:23.720 --> 41:28.440
probably falling asleep from nagging from his wife, so you know, I blame her for that.

41:28.440 --> 41:33.880
But yeah, there are a lot of bad drivers, especially SUV drivers, cell phone drivers,

41:33.880 --> 41:36.520
and cell phone drivers are even worse than stupid men.

41:36.520 --> 41:42.320
And a combination of those as well, so, lucky the bad drivers, no matter which sex, may

41:42.320 --> 41:43.320
or may not.

41:43.320 --> 41:44.320
Mainly women drivers.

41:44.320 --> 41:46.920
Hey, cell phone drivers are the worst.

41:46.920 --> 41:47.920
Sorry, Rob.

41:47.920 --> 41:53.040
Uh, well that's alright, I don't, I have my Bluetooth now, so it doesn't matter.

41:53.040 --> 41:54.040
Yes.

41:54.040 --> 41:57.240
Although I never got in an accident while talking into phone and driving, it's an urban

41:57.240 --> 41:58.240
legend.

41:58.240 --> 42:02.680
Um, it's made up, just like how man actually went to the moon, it's all made up, those

42:02.680 --> 42:03.680
cell phones.

42:03.680 --> 42:09.760
Uh, what was I gonna say, I don't really have a whole lot of FUs, so I'll just say, um,

42:09.760 --> 42:17.040
I don't know, the FU to lack of angst this week, I'm actually in a pretty good mood,

42:17.040 --> 42:19.920
FU to the million and one projects I have at work.

42:19.920 --> 42:23.400
I have so many projects at work, I'm all project out.

42:23.400 --> 42:26.960
Projects are work of the devil, and I have too many of them.

42:26.960 --> 42:27.960
That's it.

42:27.960 --> 42:29.200
A rather tame FU this week.

42:29.200 --> 42:33.040
So there you have it, another successful FUs of the Week segment.

42:33.040 --> 42:35.440
I have one last thing I was just gonna add in there real quick.

42:35.440 --> 42:36.440
Oh lordy.

42:36.440 --> 42:40.760
FU to the Halo 3 launch because I fucking hate having to deal with customers asking

42:40.760 --> 42:42.400
about when they're gonna get Halo 3.

42:42.400 --> 42:43.400
Absolutely hate it.

42:43.400 --> 42:45.520
You'll get it when it's good and ready.

42:45.520 --> 42:46.520
Exactly.

42:46.520 --> 42:49.240
That's how you should respond to them too.

42:49.240 --> 42:52.160
Alright, back to some gaming news.

42:52.160 --> 43:02.160
Well, um, anyone who is interested in watching movies and things on Xbox Live will be happy,

43:02.160 --> 43:06.440
as an anime fan at least, will be happy to know that S.T.A.R.S. is bringing different

43:06.440 --> 43:07.440
shows.

43:07.440 --> 43:13.600
We are getting Ghost in the Shell, Stand Alone Complex, Both Seasons, Street Fighter 2V,

43:13.600 --> 43:18.320
Noian, Toko, Virus, and Astro Boy.

43:18.320 --> 43:21.380
There's actually a bunch more.

43:21.380 --> 43:31.000
Some of the other ones that were listed is, well, at least they have particular access

43:31.000 --> 43:36.840
to was like Blood the Last Vampire, A Different Loop in the Third, Appleseed, Blood the Last

43:36.840 --> 43:41.000
Vampire, Ninja Scroll, Perfect Blue, I love Perfect Blue.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.160
Just different series.

43:44.160 --> 43:47.080
I haven't seen a single one of those series you mentioned.

43:47.080 --> 43:50.080
Perfect Blue was like, oh my god, Head Trip.

43:50.080 --> 43:52.160
I've seen it twice in the theater.

43:52.160 --> 43:53.280
Perfect Blue was weird.

43:53.280 --> 43:55.080
Perfect Blue was awesome.

43:55.080 --> 44:00.920
Anyway, some people are not so happy about NHL 2K8 charging you $5 to unlock a feature

44:00.920 --> 44:02.920
that's already on the game.

44:02.920 --> 44:11.600
This feature, of course, is actually the 2K real maker add-on, and it will allow you to

44:11.600 --> 44:17.120
do a variety of video recording and playback options for the game, but the download was

44:17.120 --> 44:23.200
a puny 108K, which means that you're just paying for an unlock key for something that's

44:23.200 --> 44:25.640
already on the disc.

44:25.640 --> 44:30.240
That being said, at the same time, you don't have to buy it, and it was 400 Microsoft points

44:30.240 --> 44:35.440
or $5 in real money.

44:35.440 --> 44:36.740
That is kind of shitty.

44:36.740 --> 44:39.520
It is shitty, but here's the thing.

44:39.520 --> 44:40.520
Don't buy it.

44:40.520 --> 44:43.520
If people don't buy it, they will stop doing stuff like that.

44:43.520 --> 44:44.800
But people keep buying this shit.

44:44.800 --> 44:45.800
You know what's funny?

44:45.800 --> 44:47.120
Eternal Sonata has something like that, too.

44:47.120 --> 44:49.420
Eternal Sonata has a theme that you can just unlock.

44:49.420 --> 44:54.640
I think it's you get all the piano score pieces in the game, which you would unlock naturally

44:54.640 --> 44:58.640
just by playing it anyway, if you have the patience to play it the whole way through.

44:58.640 --> 45:03.240
But I'm thinking, in sports games is one thing, but a game like Eternal Sonata, if you don't

45:03.240 --> 45:07.840
have the patience to play it the whole way through, what the fuck did you buy it for?

45:07.840 --> 45:11.040
I mean, really.

45:11.040 --> 45:15.040
Sports games, you play over and over and over again in little bursts, but a game like Eternal

45:15.040 --> 45:17.240
Sonata is really meant to be played start to finish.

45:17.240 --> 45:18.240
So what good does this...

45:18.240 --> 45:20.640
I don't know, it doesn't make sense.

45:20.640 --> 45:25.160
They're just hoping for people to buy these things at a push of a button.

45:25.160 --> 45:30.280
What does make a little more sense is buying things that were not included with the original

45:30.280 --> 45:32.840
game, such as new outfits.

45:32.840 --> 45:36.760
This is pretty interesting, is that Bomberman Live is going to be getting a new download

45:36.760 --> 45:37.760
pack.

45:37.760 --> 45:39.900
Actually, I believe it's already up, this new download pack they have.

45:39.900 --> 45:45.200
One of the characters that's in the download pack is based off of the mascot from Destructoid.com,

45:45.200 --> 45:47.280
which of course is another gaming blog.

45:47.280 --> 45:51.440
We had some of those guys on our year-end show a while ago, we'll have to have them

45:51.440 --> 45:52.440
back sometime.

45:52.440 --> 45:57.520
But yeah, they've crossed over from gaming press blog site into video game character

45:57.520 --> 46:00.960
with their little mascot, that green little robot face thing that they...

46:00.960 --> 46:04.080
Actually, I thought it was silver in some of the pictures I've seen, but whatever.

46:04.080 --> 46:09.180
Color be damned, the little mascot has certainly made a name for itself now by crossing over

46:09.180 --> 46:14.200
into a OMG legitimate video game.

46:14.200 --> 46:18.800
So where's the giant Loki head for future expansions or something like that?

46:18.800 --> 46:22.360
People would argue there would have to be a Tingle head, because they're fascinated

46:22.360 --> 46:23.360
with the character Tingle.

46:23.360 --> 46:24.360
Oh, then that wouldn't work.

46:24.360 --> 46:25.720
I do not understand this, but whatever.

46:25.720 --> 46:29.200
Then that wouldn't work, because you're crossing over, you know, Nintendo, and then that's

46:29.200 --> 46:30.200
like mixing...

46:30.200 --> 46:33.680
Then they would say, oh, he should be in Super Smash Brothers Brawl, you know, as Tingle,

46:33.680 --> 46:34.680
dressed up as Tingle.

46:34.680 --> 46:35.680
Yeah, there you go.

46:35.680 --> 46:36.680
That's like mixing...

46:36.680 --> 46:37.680
That's an awesome idea.

46:37.680 --> 46:38.680
Why don't we make that happen?

46:38.680 --> 46:39.680
No, just kidding.

46:39.680 --> 46:40.680
No, it's not an awesome idea.

46:40.680 --> 46:42.200
That's like mixing the matter with antimatter.

46:42.200 --> 46:44.000
I don't know.

46:44.000 --> 46:48.320
Escapist in our chat room asks, if Destructoid can do it, why not Bomberman based on the

46:48.320 --> 46:49.320
OLR staff?

46:49.320 --> 46:51.120
Well, that's a very nice thought.

46:51.120 --> 46:54.800
I'm sure, A, Destructoid gets like a million more hits in a month than we do.

46:54.800 --> 46:58.840
You know, we're just a tiny little show in somebody's spare bedroom, whereas Destructoid

46:58.840 --> 47:00.960
is like, you know, they've come a long way.

47:00.960 --> 47:02.440
They've only been around, what, like a year and a half?

47:02.440 --> 47:04.400
They've come a long way.

47:04.400 --> 47:09.760
B, I seem to recall that a couple weeks ago, I don't know if it was their E3 coverage or

47:09.760 --> 47:15.960
they had some coverage of some expo that was sponsored by Bomberman and they had like ads

47:15.960 --> 47:16.960
all over their site.

47:16.960 --> 47:20.480
So they had some type of relationship going on with the folks that made Bomberman.

47:20.480 --> 47:23.160
So, you know, that's kind of cool though and I'm not going to...

47:23.160 --> 47:25.040
I think it's awesome what happened.

47:25.040 --> 47:31.720
And I love the fact that the Microsoft community as a whole is really seeming to embrace the

47:31.720 --> 47:33.600
community more and more.

47:33.600 --> 47:40.440
You know, some of our other buddy podcasts, such as the Gamerscore blog and Gamertag Radio,

47:40.440 --> 47:42.360
what are all those guys called together?

47:42.360 --> 47:43.360
Gamercast.

47:43.360 --> 47:45.480
They all have their own pictures up on the marketplace.

47:45.480 --> 47:46.480
That's pretty rad.

47:46.480 --> 47:49.200
Hopefully we'll see more of those very soon.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.320
Yes.

47:50.320 --> 47:54.640
Anyhow, back to the gaming news.

47:54.640 --> 48:02.400
Well, something that should interest a few people, especially that are mobile phone gamers,

48:02.400 --> 48:10.400
coming out will be Rockman Dash, which is one of the Mega Man Legends series.

48:10.400 --> 48:14.320
It's a new Rockman Dash game and those fuckers didn't put it on a damn console that I can

48:14.320 --> 48:15.320
play.

48:15.320 --> 48:16.320
I hate the...

48:16.320 --> 48:17.320
Cell phones do not need more games.

48:17.320 --> 48:20.200
I hate the Mega Man Legends games.

48:20.200 --> 48:28.440
There's also Resident Evil 4 mobile edition, Devil May Cry Dante vs. Virgil, Sengoku Basara,

48:28.440 --> 48:33.200
Tactical RPG, and Breath of Fire 4.

48:33.200 --> 48:38.000
I wouldn't mind having Breath of Fire 4 on my phone, but anyway, that's all Japanese

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
only right now.

48:39.000 --> 48:42.840
Yeah, but it's mobile phones, so who cares?

48:42.840 --> 48:43.840
I care.

48:43.840 --> 48:44.840
I play Lumines on my phone.

48:44.840 --> 48:45.840
Really?

48:45.840 --> 48:46.840
Yes.

48:46.840 --> 48:47.840
Really?

48:47.840 --> 48:48.840
Why?

48:48.840 --> 48:54.800
Because, first of all, I can sneak around outside at work and play it, and it's actually

48:54.800 --> 48:55.800
not too bad.

48:55.800 --> 48:57.360
Actually, I enjoyed Lumines on mobile phones, too.

48:57.360 --> 48:58.360
I have to be honest.

48:58.360 --> 49:00.000
I'm going to load it up right now.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
I'll play it during a show.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.480
Well, you have fun with that, Miss Thing.

49:02.480 --> 49:04.480
I will.

49:04.480 --> 49:12.080
Anyways, so, maybe you're looking to find that special someone to eventually proclaim

49:12.080 --> 49:14.960
your love over Viva Pinata 2.

49:14.960 --> 49:17.080
Well, fear not.

49:17.080 --> 49:22.940
We're here to help you, and thanks to the Sexy Video Game Land blog, they have compiled

49:22.940 --> 49:24.600
a list of what they think are...

49:24.600 --> 49:27.240
What a great blog name, by the way, might I add.

49:27.240 --> 49:35.720
The best video game pickup lines, and here are some to run by you guys, including, What

49:35.720 --> 49:40.080
do you say I take my flag to your base and score?

49:40.080 --> 49:42.760
So you ever been in a five-man raid?

49:42.760 --> 49:48.440
Hey, baby, I need a new hoe, and it ain't for gardening.

49:48.440 --> 49:50.080
How does that have anything to do with video games?

49:50.080 --> 49:51.080
It's Harvest Moon.

49:51.080 --> 49:52.080
Oh, God.

49:52.080 --> 49:53.760
That's so stupid.

49:53.760 --> 49:59.880
Let me call you Silent Hill, because things will really get freaky when I'm inside you.

49:59.880 --> 50:04.960
I know how Mario must feel, because I really want to clean your pipes.

50:04.960 --> 50:09.520
Call me Ash, because I choose you.

50:09.520 --> 50:12.520
There's a warp zone in my pants.

50:12.520 --> 50:13.520
I made that one up.

50:13.520 --> 50:14.520
Oh, let's see.

50:14.520 --> 50:15.880
You're just like an RPG.

50:15.880 --> 50:22.520
I can't wait to take you home, unwrap you, put it in, and then grind away until sun rises.

50:22.520 --> 50:26.800
Girl, you got me like WarioWare, I'm touched.

50:26.800 --> 50:27.880
That's stupid.

50:27.880 --> 50:32.360
You can't be Phoenix Wright, because I have no objection to you, baby.

50:32.360 --> 50:33.360
Okay.

50:33.360 --> 50:35.800
Those are awful.

50:35.800 --> 50:40.920
If you're a devil, you may cry by the time I'm finished with you.

50:40.920 --> 50:44.240
You remind me of a game of Tetris.

50:44.240 --> 50:46.440
You always want the long ones.

50:46.440 --> 50:47.440
What?

50:47.440 --> 50:50.360
That doesn't even make sense.

50:50.360 --> 50:51.360
That's stupid.

50:51.360 --> 50:58.120
Hey, baby, can I hide my solid snake in your box?

50:58.120 --> 51:00.200
That makes me want to throw up a little.

51:00.200 --> 51:02.320
I think I did just throw up in my mouth.

51:02.320 --> 51:04.960
Now, see, our chat room's joining in now.

51:04.960 --> 51:06.960
Did you throw up in your stomach, Rob?

51:06.960 --> 51:07.960
Huh?

51:07.960 --> 51:08.960
Did you throw up in your stomach?

51:08.960 --> 51:09.960
Shut up.

51:09.960 --> 51:12.920
DJ Dark Knight says, back me wool, baby.

51:12.920 --> 51:14.760
That's an old OLR joke.

51:14.760 --> 51:19.960
Rama says, hey, baby, how about I dance dance to your revolution and you beat my mania?

51:19.960 --> 51:21.440
Okay.

51:21.440 --> 51:25.640
GS68 says, you must play 2DX because you've got me on hard mode.

51:25.640 --> 51:29.720
I don't like that one, that one's funny.

51:29.720 --> 51:31.720
Warrior Bob says, you remind me of Tetris.

51:31.720 --> 51:33.080
I just want to make you disappear.

51:33.080 --> 51:36.720
I mean, wait, have sex with me.

51:36.720 --> 51:38.120
I like that one.

51:38.120 --> 51:42.800
My favorite pickup line was always, hi, I like peanut butter, want to fuck?

51:42.800 --> 51:48.680
Or how about this one, babe, you're hotter than my first edition 360s power supply.

51:48.680 --> 51:49.680
That's lame.

51:49.680 --> 51:50.680
Stupid.

51:50.680 --> 51:51.680
Wow.

51:51.680 --> 51:52.680
Lame.

51:52.680 --> 51:58.720
Baby, you could screw attack me all night long.

51:58.720 --> 52:04.480
Anyhow, Jiranami says, you must play Tetris because you're stacked.

52:04.480 --> 52:06.240
That one's actually kind of good.

52:06.240 --> 52:07.240
Not bad.

52:07.240 --> 52:08.720
Jiranami has a funny joke once in a while.

52:08.720 --> 52:09.720
All right, moving on, please.

52:09.720 --> 52:10.720
Add it to the toilet paper.

52:10.720 --> 52:13.200
For the love of God, a new story, please.

52:13.200 --> 52:16.280
From video game pickup lines from, what was that, Sexy Game Blog?

52:16.280 --> 52:17.280
What was it called?

52:17.280 --> 52:18.280
Sexy Game Land Blog.

52:18.280 --> 52:20.360
Sexy Game Land Blog, nice.

52:20.360 --> 52:26.640
Moving on to something completely different, political stuffs, and that would be Mitt Romney

52:26.640 --> 52:27.640
specifically.

52:27.640 --> 52:28.640
You might know him.

52:28.640 --> 52:31.840
He's a Mormon guy, right, running for president on a Republican ticket?

52:31.840 --> 52:34.120
I don't keep up with too many Republicans.

52:34.120 --> 52:36.520
Very staunch conservative fellow.

52:36.520 --> 52:43.440
Well, he has once called video games, quote, a cesspool of violence, sex, drugs, indolence,

52:43.440 --> 52:45.040
and perversions.

52:45.040 --> 52:50.880
So imagine the irony and hilarity when you notice the Mitt Romney ad campaign ad start

52:50.880 --> 52:54.280
showing up on gametrailers.com.

52:54.280 --> 53:00.800
That's right, a joystick snapped a picture of gametrailers.com site with, and it's not

53:00.800 --> 53:01.800
a Photoshop thing.

53:01.800 --> 53:02.800
It's the real deal.

53:02.800 --> 53:06.760
It's the game trailer's little logo there and the Mitt Romney ad right on top of the

53:06.760 --> 53:07.760
site.

53:07.760 --> 53:11.400
Hilarity that their campaign would be advertising on the site.

53:11.400 --> 53:18.240
Now let's see, I'm going to go for the obvious here and say that probably there are people

53:18.240 --> 53:23.760
or whatever bought into a package deal or some type of advertising company that distributes

53:23.760 --> 53:28.280
through all these different websites and game trailers just happens to be one of many.

53:28.280 --> 53:32.840
Because doesn't MTV own game trailers, I want to say, or there's some type of partnership

53:32.840 --> 53:33.840
there?

53:33.840 --> 53:34.840
I could be wrong.

53:34.840 --> 53:35.840
I don't remember.

53:35.840 --> 53:40.920
But yeah, there's probably some much bigger thing and just showed up on that site.

53:40.920 --> 53:41.920
That's kind of funny.

53:41.920 --> 53:44.040
That's karma for you.

53:44.040 --> 53:46.280
This is why we don't do banner ads on orangeontrader.com.

53:46.280 --> 53:49.720
This is also why we're poor, I'd just like to point out.

53:49.720 --> 53:52.500
But irony for the win in this case.

53:52.500 --> 53:54.960
So there you have it.

53:54.960 --> 53:59.440
Well, here is a little bit more for anyone who wants.

53:59.440 --> 54:02.960
Yakuza 2 is coming out in the US.

54:02.960 --> 54:08.760
Dinosaur King and Mystery Dungeon is also coming out thanks to Sega.

54:08.760 --> 54:16.440
So they are supposed to be coming out in 2008 and I think that's going to be very cool because

54:16.440 --> 54:19.880
I honestly want, I actually was looking into a little bit on Mystery Dungeon.

54:19.880 --> 54:22.680
It's Sheeran the Wanderer.

54:22.680 --> 54:25.800
Dinosaur King is a game where you collect 100 dinosaurs with different moves and you

54:25.800 --> 54:27.960
make them fight.

54:27.960 --> 54:34.840
And wow, I just won Yakuza 2 so I can go around beating people up.

54:34.840 --> 54:36.000
You just like violence.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
I do like violence.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.800
I like beating up people wearing nice suits.

54:39.800 --> 54:45.000
Alright, those games coming to you very soon from Sega.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.400
Also coming to you very soon, the Skype line.

54:47.400 --> 54:54.080
You can give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.

54:54.080 --> 54:55.880
We love to be interactive.

54:55.880 --> 54:57.920
But one more story for you real quick.

54:57.920 --> 55:00.920
Yeah, I like being interactive alright.

55:00.920 --> 55:04.320
Anyways, enough with the pick up line, seriously.

55:04.320 --> 55:07.960
Although I have to say this, SSJ100Matt sent me a message and says that there should be

55:07.960 --> 55:12.520
a voicemail challenge for people to leave pick up lines on the Skype line voicemail.

55:12.520 --> 55:14.080
Do you want some hot coffee?

55:14.080 --> 55:16.320
Yeah, so please, I love that idea.

55:16.320 --> 55:21.560
So please call, if you give our number a call either on Skype or the phone number when we're

55:21.560 --> 55:24.880
not live, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

55:24.880 --> 55:28.560
Leave us a message with your sexy video game pick up line and we'll play some of our favorites

55:28.560 --> 55:31.040
on next week's show but I bet you we don't get any.

55:31.040 --> 55:39.200
Anyways, in case you had hopes and dreams that that wonderful Halo 3 Legendary Edition

55:39.200 --> 55:44.720
game box was actually going to become a brand new helmet for your cat, unfortunately that

55:44.720 --> 55:53.040
will not be the case because the helmet itself, as IGN found out, is not hollowed and will

55:53.040 --> 55:56.560
not fit on your cat.

55:56.560 --> 55:57.560
That sucks.

55:57.560 --> 56:01.160
I can't put the helmet on my cat and watch my cat run into walls.

56:01.160 --> 56:04.040
But I mean, with some simple modding you probably could do that.

56:04.040 --> 56:05.960
Oh wait, I don't own a cat.

56:05.960 --> 56:07.960
I own a cat.

56:07.960 --> 56:12.360
There's no way a cat would put their head in that anyways.

56:12.360 --> 56:14.560
Could we put the helmet on the ferret?

56:14.560 --> 56:17.560
Yeah, that would look weird though.

56:17.560 --> 56:18.840
That we might be able to pull off.

56:18.840 --> 56:21.200
I bet Shermie's little head would fit in it.

56:21.200 --> 56:22.200
She's got a small brain.

56:22.200 --> 56:23.200
Are you kidding?

56:23.200 --> 56:25.120
Shermie's the fattest cat I've ever seen.

56:25.120 --> 56:27.320
But her brain is very small.

56:27.320 --> 56:30.960
Cats aren't dumb enough to put their head in there.

56:30.960 --> 56:33.960
Alright, our Skype line is open if you want to call.

56:33.960 --> 56:40.200
Give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.

56:40.200 --> 56:43.560
And while we wait for some calls, last minute stories.

56:43.560 --> 56:50.780
Yes, this is very interesting, well not for me, but for maybe Rob, apparently if you were

56:50.780 --> 56:56.280
looking for some man sex type game or whatever, there's Duel Love which is going to be coming

56:56.280 --> 57:03.240
to the DS and it includes a part of the game where you scrub down a naked man.

57:03.240 --> 57:07.840
Oh god, I saw a preview for that on some website.

57:07.840 --> 57:09.760
It looks stupid.

57:09.760 --> 57:10.760
Somebody sent me a link to it.

57:10.760 --> 57:11.760
It looks stupid.

57:11.760 --> 57:12.760
Anyway, we're getting some phone calls.

57:12.760 --> 57:14.200
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

57:14.200 --> 57:15.200
Who's this?

57:15.200 --> 57:16.200
Oh, this is Warrior Bob.

57:16.200 --> 57:17.200
How's it going?

57:17.200 --> 57:18.200
I'm Warrior Bob.

57:18.200 --> 57:19.200
It's good.

57:19.200 --> 57:20.200
How about you?

57:20.200 --> 57:21.200
Not too bad.

57:21.200 --> 57:22.200
Long time, no chat.

57:22.200 --> 57:23.320
Yeah, serious.

57:23.320 --> 57:25.200
So we read your email about the rock band.

57:25.200 --> 57:26.200
Good times.

57:26.200 --> 57:27.200
Yeah, thank you.

57:27.200 --> 57:29.600
Loki went down and played it, but I missed out.

57:29.600 --> 57:30.880
I totally forgot.

57:30.880 --> 57:33.080
Oh, when was he there?

57:33.080 --> 57:34.080
Today.

57:34.080 --> 57:35.680
Oh, that's why I didn't see you.

57:35.680 --> 57:37.960
Were you there like all day or something?

57:37.960 --> 57:41.660
I was there most of the day, Thursday and Friday because I had a group of friends going

57:41.660 --> 57:42.880
and I figured, eh, why not?

57:42.880 --> 57:45.400
But you went to the Sac State one, right?

57:45.400 --> 57:46.400
That's right.

57:46.400 --> 57:47.840
Loki went to the Ribs and what was it, Ribfest?

57:47.840 --> 57:49.440
The Rhythm and Ribs Fest.

57:49.440 --> 57:51.440
Rhythm and Ribs.

57:51.440 --> 57:52.440
I should have gone to that.

57:52.440 --> 57:53.440
I love Ribs.

57:53.440 --> 57:54.440
That's awesome.

57:54.440 --> 57:58.520
I went to the one on Friday where I had the work and unfortunately I only went until six.

57:58.520 --> 58:01.680
Unfortunately a rib festival doesn't work very well for someone who's trying to be more

58:01.680 --> 58:03.680
vegetarian but what have you.

58:03.680 --> 58:04.680
Anyway.

58:04.680 --> 58:05.960
I'm unemployed so Friday was a great day.

58:05.960 --> 58:06.960
Ah, gotcha.

58:06.960 --> 58:07.960
What would you call in about tonight?

58:07.960 --> 58:08.960
What's on your mind?

58:08.960 --> 58:12.280
Well, so, I figured it's the first time I've gotten to listen to your show live in a few

58:12.280 --> 58:17.240
years so I'd figure I'll take some of your advice.

58:17.240 --> 58:19.480
I've been playing the Guardian Legend while I'm listening.

58:19.480 --> 58:20.480
Yay!

58:20.480 --> 58:21.480
Awesome.

58:21.480 --> 58:22.480
What do you think?

58:22.480 --> 58:27.760
It's fun and I can't put my finger on it but what in God's name am I supposed to be doing?

58:27.760 --> 58:32.440
Wandering around, you fight things and collect the power-ups and then you go into the different

58:32.440 --> 58:39.700
levels and the levels are numbered by like one, twenty-one, two, you know, they back

58:39.700 --> 58:40.700
and forth.

58:40.700 --> 58:41.700
I think it's one, eleven.

58:41.700 --> 58:47.360
Yeah, one, eleven and your last two levels are ten and twenty and they are fucking hard.

58:47.360 --> 58:51.320
Here's the thing is that you walk around the Zelda-ish world looking for where the corridors

58:51.320 --> 58:57.600
are and the first few corridors are easy to open up but what happens is that later on

58:57.600 --> 58:59.100
the corridors get harder to open up.

58:59.100 --> 59:02.520
You have to figure out the tricks to open them up and you can either cheat and go to

59:02.520 --> 59:06.040
Game Facts or you can look around for those little blue happy face guys, what do they

59:06.040 --> 59:07.040
call them?

59:07.040 --> 59:08.040
The Lunars?

59:08.040 --> 59:09.040
What do they call them?

59:09.040 --> 59:10.040
Oh, they're like the Lolo guys.

59:10.040 --> 59:13.120
Yeah, they look like Lolo and they give you tips on how to open up the corridors.

59:13.120 --> 59:18.160
When you beat the corridors like one through ten, they give you a key like you'll get a

59:18.160 --> 59:22.520
little moon key or you'll get a little square key or a diamond key and that will allow you

59:22.520 --> 59:25.520
to progress to another section of the Zelda world where there are more corridors waiting

59:25.520 --> 59:26.520
for you.

59:26.520 --> 59:27.520
Well, that makes way more sense.

59:27.520 --> 59:31.080
I thought I was supposed to go to like level moon or level plus sign or something.

59:31.080 --> 59:35.800
No, no, you find those moons and plus signs in the corridors when you beat them.

59:35.800 --> 59:37.840
Yeah, they're different keys.

59:37.840 --> 59:41.440
And then the corridors eleven through twenty just give you weapon upgrades and stuff, right?

59:41.440 --> 59:42.440
I think so.

59:42.440 --> 59:43.440
Yeah.

59:43.440 --> 59:44.440
I don't think you get too much other stuff special.

59:44.440 --> 59:48.640
Well, you still have to beat every level to progress through it, but the weapons that

59:48.640 --> 59:52.880
you get, the one weapon that's going to be your best friend, especially in the last level,

59:52.880 --> 01:00:00.760
is the multidirectional ball because you can shoot it up, down, left, right, and diagonals

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:04.640
and the way you beat the last boss is so freaking easy, but everything else is really hard.

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.640
Drunami says...

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:06.640
This is way better than GameFAQs.

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:07.640
Thank you.

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:12.560
But TGL mode, you want to try TGL mode at least once.

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:16.240
You go into your password and just put in an all caps TGL.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.240
Okay.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.240
I'll give that a try.

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.320
It's just all the shooting stages back to back.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:23.520
And it gives you your power-ups, however, there are ways to get around and get earlier

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:29.720
power-ups and other things playing in RPG mode, but TGL mode is definitely for the win.

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:30.720
Crazy talk.

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.640
Drunami says they're called Blue Landers just for the record.

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.320
I like Lolo better.

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:36.920
Lolo was pretty awesome.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:40.200
Where it ever happened to Lolo, there was like three of those games on the NES and then

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:41.200
Lolo disappeared.

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.000
He showed up on Virtual Console.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Oh, that's right.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
He came out.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.280
You know, Lolo should be in Smash Brothers because didn't HAL make a... and HAL is like

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.680
a second party, right?

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.680
They're owned by Nintendo, kind of.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.500
They only make games for Nintendo.

01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:00.220
And they made Lolo and they're the ones that make Smash Brothers, right?

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:01.220
They are.

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:02.880
So where the hell is Lolo in these games?

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:08.280
He probably died because everything kills you in that game.

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.440
There was a button that killed you in that game.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:15.680
Escapist said Lolo moonlighted in the first Kirby game then disappeared.

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:16.680
That's true.

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:21.760
He probably hit the select button or whatever the seppuku button was in Lolo.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.040
Those were some tough games.

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.040
That's right.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.040
There was Lolo Lolo and La La La.

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.620
Remember his girlfriend, La La La?

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:30.520
She was the girl because she had a bow in her hair and she was pink.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.520
The quintessential girl.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:32.520
Well, there's the connection.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:33.520
Kirby had King Dedede.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:36.560
It's like you take a syllable and just repeat it a bunch of times.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:40.420
We need a new... yes, we need a new enemy in this next HAL game.

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:45.960
How about King Nanana or King Boo Boo Boo?

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:49.600
They let their babies name them, actually, is what they do.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:52.320
Learn your first Japanese character and just write it a bunch of times.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.320
That's right.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.760
All right, WarriorBob, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:59.680
No, I've got an NES plugged in now, so what should I play?

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:02.000
I've got a legend fund, but I'm looking for more ammo.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.200
More NES games to play.

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:07.760
Well, I said Cobra Triangle earlier in the show and I still stand by that one.

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:14.080
Here's one of my favorite NES games that nobody ever talks about, Snake, Rattle, and Roll.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.080
I've got that.

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.080
I'll put that in.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.080
That game is rad.

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:18.080
You've got to play that game.

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.080
DuckTales.

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:22.080
Yeah, DuckTales is awesome.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:24.080
Chat rooms can be used to suggest it's true.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.080
All right, thank you guys so much.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.080
Yeah, no problem.

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.080
Have a good one.

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.080
See you next time.

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.080
See you.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:30.240
I hope WarriorBob comes back to visit sometime.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:32.200
It was fun having him on the show.

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:33.760
And lots of folks in the chat room are chiming in.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:39.240
Tech Mobile, Ninja Gaiden, Clu Clu Land, Arkon.

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.240
That's a good suggestion.

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.240
Arkon.

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:42.240
Clu Clu Land.

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.720
Oh my God, I played so much of that stupid game.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:45.920
I did an Animal Crossing.

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:46.920
We have another call.

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:47.920
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:48.920
Who's this?

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:50.360
No, this is Mr. DeBucket.

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:51.760
Hello, Mr. DeBucket.

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:52.760
What's on your mind?

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:55.160
He's going to yell at me for kicking him over the Dreamcast.

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:57.760
No, I'm not going to yell at you for that.

01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:58.760
That's understandable.

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:02.160
I know how Dreamcast fans are really defensive.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.160
This is true.

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.160
What's on your mind then?

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.920
Oh, Metal Gear Solid 4, Metal Gear Solid Online.

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:13.120
I wanted to know what you guys thought of them making the game separate from the multiplayer.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.000
You know, I don't, here's the thing, I have to be honest.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.540
I don't follow the Metal Gear series too much, but I'm, I'm kind of welcoming the idea of

01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:21.600
an online version.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.300
I think that might be a lot of fun.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:29.120
Kind of like a, not so much like a first person shooter, but kind of like a different type

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:30.600
of direction for that.

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:31.600
But I don't know.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:35.240
Like, I'm not so excited about Metal Gear Solid 4 because I didn't play the first three

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:36.240
so much.

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:40.440
Like, I haven't really played a Metal Gear game since Snake's Revenge on the NES, I have

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:41.440
to be honest.

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.440
You played that?

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:43.440
Yeah, I did.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.440
I rented it one weekend.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:45.440
I played quite a bit of it.

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:46.440
How did you finish it?

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:47.440
Huh?

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:48.440
How did you finish it?

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:51.960
As far as I got was I found like a dude tied up by some, you know, in the middle of the

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:52.960
jungle.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:53.960
I untied him.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:54.960
He runs off.

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.760
I leave and then it's just all darkness and fireworks going off.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.600
I seriously don't remember.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.680
When I rented it, I was like 11.

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.560
Yeah, every time we went to a new screen, it was all dark, then fireworks went off and

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:09.600
everything was lit up for some reason and helicopters couldn't see you even though you're

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:10.720
standing right next to them.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:13.420
Well, how do you feel about it because you must have called this because you had an opinion

01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:14.420
on it.

01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:16.160
Oh yeah, I think it's an interesting idea.

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:19.540
I mean, if you don't like Metal Gear that much, if you really can't get into the single

01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:23.520
player, the multiplayer aspect, since it's the second game, I'm pretty sure you will

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.080
be able to buy it separate.

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:26.520
You could like that better.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:33.680
Also, they change the controls to make them more like Western games or things that a lot

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.640
of online gamers would get into.

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:40.760
Now use R1, the shooting stuff, kind of like most games do, using the right trigger, the

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:44.320
fire, and use L to aim.

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:49.080
The Sons of Patriot system, which is a new thing you can do because no multiplayer game,

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:52.720
you can always see your buddies and tell if they died or something like that.

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:56.800
You know, say like this person's name got shot, but you can actually see everything

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:57.800
that they're doing.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:03.400
Every time you begin a match, you all link up and you can see everybody's stats and

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:08.740
what weapon they have and what they're exactly doing so you can go help them out or something.

01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:12.100
It's a really cool system and it's a completely different game.

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:15.800
They're selling it different, but if you do buy Metal Gear Solid 4, you will get like

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:17.040
a starter pack or something.

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:18.640
Yeah, I heard about that.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:23.760
Yeah, apparently they're going to be making more downloadable content over the next years

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.200
if people still play it.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.200
That's cool.

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:29.220
You know, and I think what you said is kind of right where I feel, is that I'm not so

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:32.800
excited about Metal Gear Solid 4, but I hear about this online one and I'm like, oh really?

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.760
That looks like it could be fun.

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:38.560
You know, I don't really follow the story, but you know, just throwing me in the arena

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:40.560
and shoot them up so it looks like a lot of fun.

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:43.200
So I definitely will check it out if nothing else.

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.280
I may not get so into it, but we'll see.

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:46.280
Okay.

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:49.000
All right, well anything else you want to share with our listeners today?

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.840
No, I just think the show was good and I'll keep listening from that one.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:54.840
I appreciate it.

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:55.840
Thank you very much.

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:56.840
Have a good one, buddy.

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:57.840
Bye.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:58.840
Bye-bye.

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:01.200
Even if he did, even if he was hating on the Dreamcast, what do you say about the Dreamcast

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:03.080
that got him kicked?

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:08.080
Just it was in this pickup line thing saying the Dreamcast sucks dick or something.

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:15.040
Okay, Rob, do you remember, in fact, I think that we should play this though in the Afterbirth.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.040
What's that?

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.040
I'll try.

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.040
I'll try.

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.040
I'll try.

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.040
I'll try.

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:21.040
I'll try.

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:22.040
I'll try.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.040
I'll try.

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.040
I'll find it.

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.040
All right.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.040
I picked up a call.

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.040
Let's go to the phones.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.040
Hi, you're on Orange County.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.040
I'll show you.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.040
Who's this?

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.040
Legend of Zaku.

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.040
Hello, Legend of Zaku.

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.040
What's on your mind?

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:37.440
Nah, just chilling, just getting ready for digital life, which is at the end of the week.

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:38.440
I'm sorry.

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:39.440
I'm not coming.

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:40.440
I was looking forward to it.

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:41.440
Something else came up.

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:42.440
I've been knowing that.

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:43.440
It's all right though.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:53.680
Just the general stuff within the community, stuff like Middle Gear Solid 4.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:54.680
What the hell are you typing?

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:56.880
Hey, are you typing to somebody else?

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:57.880
It's our turn.

01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:58.880
You talk to us.

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:03.920
No, I mean Final Fantasy, all the Halo stuff, all the reviews.

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:10.840
Most of them are actually all the Halo 3 reviews coming back almost at 100 or something.

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:17.640
The general internet says stuff like OMG, they probably got paid off by Microsoft, but

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.320
yeah, that sort of thing.

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:22.840
I'm not really buying into that much hype.

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:28.200
Okay, Zaku, what are you most looking forward to about digital life?

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:30.400
Just the DDR tournament.

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.040
I'm competing in freestyle on Saturday.

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:35.440
Are you getting hints about your routine?

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.440
Not yet.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:47.480
When you see it up on YouTube, hopefully at that night after the tournament, then you'll

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.480
see something.

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:51.240
But yeah, I'm trying to keep it under wraps.

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:56.640
I will be looking for you on the YouTubage.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:59.560
Why else do people do DDR freestyle anymore?

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:04.520
It's all about being on YouTube and everybody being able to watch your routine.

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:09.840
It's kind of like a dying art right now because most tournaments don't even have that except

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.340
for a few exceptions.

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:15.240
If they have that whole SingStar thing on the PlayStation 3 where you're going to be

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:18.640
able to upload your videos like a karaoke thing, why don't they do that with DDR?

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:19.640
That's what I don't get.

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:24.120
Microsoft doesn't care or Konami doesn't care.

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:26.320
Most DDR makes us have some sort of camera support.

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:28.480
I know the PS2 ones have iToy.

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:29.480
Exactly.

01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:30.480
I don't know about 360.

01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:32.840
So how about just a website you can upload all that to?

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:33.840
Come on.

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:34.840
It's free.

01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:35.960
So Konami, I'm giving you free hints here.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:39.960
I don't think Konami is ready to drop that much bandwidth on that.

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:45.160
I mean, they're taking DDR that far, but that's about it.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.840
What else is on your mind tonight, buddy?

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:51.320
Just really go over the whole rumble.

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:57.480
Sony actually getting it supposedly taking their quote unquote last gen feature and just

01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:01.700
polishing it as if it were new.

01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:03.480
Basically polishing a turd.

01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:04.480
We all know better.

01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:05.480
All right.

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:08.440
Well, Zach, I got to let you go to get more calls, but have a good one.

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:11.840
Have fun in digital life and tell everybody we said hi.

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.280
Tell Don I said hi and I'm sorry I didn't make it.

01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:15.840
Yeah, I will.

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:16.840
All right.

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:17.840
All right.

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:18.840
Later, buddy.

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:21.520
See, I'm having people relay my personal messages now.

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.520
All right.

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.520
Rob.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.520
What?

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:25.520
I sent you that thing.

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.520
Yes.

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:27.520
Well, do you want me to play it now or do you want me to play it in the athlete?

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:28.520
Right before.

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:29.520
Right before.

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:30.520
Right now?

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:31.520
No, not now.

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:32.520
Oh, right before the very end.

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:33.520
You got it.

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:36.360
A little treat for our live listeners.

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.360
Are we going to get any more calls?

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:38.360
I don't know.

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:39.360
How about some more last minute stories?

01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:40.360
We'll wait for more calls.

01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:42.800
1-877-GAME-OLR or username orangeonsradio on Skype.

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:43.800
Okay.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:44.800
Anything else?

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:49.320
If you like Owen Dunn or Elite Beat Agents, you'll be happy to know that OSU, the sim

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:52.560
for those games has been released onto the PC.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:57.480
It is available to download and is actually pretty interesting.

01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:04.460
You can find it at osu.ppy.sh and it's in one of their forum posts there.

01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:07.600
It's just like playing Owen Dunn but just with your mouse.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:09.080
Which must be insanely difficult.

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.080
Hold on.

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:11.080
We'll talk about that in a minute.

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:12.080
We got another call.

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.080
Hi.

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.080
You're on orangeonsradio.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.080
Who's this?

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.080
This is Misty.

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.080
Hi, Misty.

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:18.080
Misty.

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.080
How are you, Misty?

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:20.080
Up for once.

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:21.080
Wow.

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:22.080
I know.

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.080
We never hear from you live on the show, but I'm so happy you were able to call in.

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:27.080
OMG, a girl, everybody.

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:33.800
Well, yeah, but you're always here.

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.800
DarkSakura is looking at her boobs to make sure they're still there.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:37.800
What was that?

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:38.800
OMG, a girl.

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:41.040
I'm like, yeah, what am I?

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:44.400
I wish you would let us put you on OP11 for the funny stuff like that sometimes.

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:45.400
No.

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:46.400
Alright.

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:47.400
Well, Misty, what's on your mind tonight?

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:50.120
You just wanted to say hi or what kind of games you've been playing lately?

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.720
Well, actually, I went to the mall.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:55.760
I caved and got the Crimson Black Deus White Combo.

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:59.480
I've been playing a little bit of Brain Age, got Cooking Mama.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.480
Awesome.

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:04.480
What do you think of Cooking Mama?

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.480
It is addictive.

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:06.880
This is very addictive.

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:09.560
What kind of foods have you been preparing in Cooking Mama lately?

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:15.240
Pretty much so far the stuff that has retained its Japanese names.

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.240
Okay.

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:17.240
Very cool.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:18.240
Very cool.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:23.000
Is there anything coming out soon on the DS that you're looking forward to?

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.440
Not really because I've only been half paying attention, but considering my birthday is

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:32.040
coming up, I'm going to start paying more attention at Target.

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.040
Okay.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:34.040
Let's see what else is coming out.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.040
I don't know.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:38.400
Actually, I don't know if there's a whole lot on DS coming out soon to get excited about

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.400
this year.

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:40.400
Zelda Phantom Hourglass.

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:41.400
Ah, thank you.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.400
I knew I was forgetting something.

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:43.400
It's the week after next.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:44.400
There you go.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.400
Zelda Phantom Hourglass.

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:48.960
Most of their big stuff for the holidays have already come out like Brain Age 2 and all

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.320
that, right?

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.160
There's Final Fantasy Tactics on the DS.

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:53.160
Final Fantasy IV.

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:54.160
Oh, Final Fantasy IV.

01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:55.160
A front mission.

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:56.160
Revenant Wings.

01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.160
All right.

01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:58.160
All right.

01:11:58.160 --> 01:11:59.160
So shoot me for not following the DS so much.

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.160
My bad.

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:02.440
Well, I don't think it's coming out this year, but...

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:06.000
Now as folks in the chat room are giving you some advice on DS games to pick up, the Rob

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.400
D says you need to get Clubhouse games.

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.140
Son of Dad says Planet Puzzle League.

01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:11.140
That's a good game.

01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:17.160
Yeah, those two look like ones that I've been considering.

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:23.160
And for Clubhouse, I have considered it last night, but I came and got Cookie Mommy because

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:28.800
I saw that it was only $20, and I was trying to watch my money a little bit, because when

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:29.800
I...

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:30.800
The DS was...

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.040
That game stuff was only my first step in the mall.

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:35.720
I still had a good portion of the mall to go.

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:36.720
Right.

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:39.240
So I see the good deals always went out when they're cheaper.

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:40.240
Always went out.

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:42.760
Well, Misty, anything else you want to share with our listeners today?

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:47.000
Not really that I can think of.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000
All right.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.920
Well, Misty, thanks so much for calling in, and I'm glad to hear you got through.

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:53.440
I know you've been listening to our show forever, and it's always good to listen to you live,

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:54.440
all right?

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:55.440
All righty.

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:57.440
All right, have a good one.

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.440
You too.

01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.440
Bye-bye.

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:00.960
Misty is all kinds of rad.

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:04.920
Misty makes OLR jewelry, which I think is the cutest thing ever.

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:05.920
It's so cute.

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:09.520
If you want to get in on that, go to the forums at our orangelawntrader.com.

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.520
Click on forums.

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.520
We're getting more calls.

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.520
More.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.160
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:15.160
Who's this?

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:19.000
Hey, no more less day.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Is this Extover?

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
This is.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.760
How's it going?

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:26.680
You're actually listening to the show tonight, Extover?

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:28.640
I went into the chat room.

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:38.560
I was playing my puzzle quest, and I went onto the website, and so I decided to call

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:39.560
in.

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:40.560
Well, there you have it.

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:41.560
I thought you guys were taking calls.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:45.440
Do you miss living where the show is recorded?

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.440
Because now you have to call in.

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.760
Yeah, I don't miss you, but I miss the show.

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:51.200
I miss everything about the show.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:53.120
You miss Jamie and Matt, but.

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:54.120
Yeah.

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.120
Yeah, I'm all right.

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:57.400
I miss Jamie and Matt.

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.400
Nothing about you, though.

01:13:58.400 --> 01:13:59.400
Yeah, I know.

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:00.400
I'm kind of.

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:01.480
I'm really horrible to live with.

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:05.120
You need to actually come with us to get Indian food when you can eat.

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:07.380
Yeah, I know.

01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:15.360
Really that place is very friendly to the South Beach diet is what I was reading.

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.200
It's all whole wheat or unbleached.

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.200
And it's great for vegetarians.

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.200
Except for the rice.

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:20.600
It's awesome for vegetarians, too.

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:22.640
I'm actually thinking about going vegetarian again.

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:24.200
I just did three days ago.

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:25.200
Did you?

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:26.200
Yes.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:27.200
Cool.

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.200
That's why I'm taking vitamins and stuff.

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.120
I didn't want to make too big a deal out of it, because last time I went vegetarian, I

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:32.120
was not able to do it for more than a week and a half.

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:33.120
Well, yeah, but you were.

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.400
So you're being a vegetarian, Rob?

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:36.400
What?

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.400
You're being a vegetarian?

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:38.400
Yeah.

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.600
I threw out everything I had that had meat in it, and I've replaced everything in my

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:41.600
fridge with products.

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:42.600
I'll tell you what.

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:43.600
I will.

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:44.600
Because I do have to have.

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:45.600
Oh, my God.

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:46.600
You're a loser.

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:47.600
I get an email really quickly.

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:48.600
Wait.

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:49.600
Why'd you call me a loser?

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:50.600
I don't know.

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:51.600
Just don't like it.

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:52.600
Go to hell.

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:53.600
I hate you.

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:54.600
What?

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:55.600
Okay.

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:59.160
I will go vegetarian with you, except I will need to eat fish.

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:03.160
No, I'm going to eat fish, too, because protein's so hard to get.

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:04.160
I get an email.

01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.160
Well, then you're not a true vegetarian.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:06.720
You're right, I'm not.

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:09.960
So it would be more appropriate to say I don't eat meat.

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:10.960
No red meat.

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:11.960
Yeah, you're a fish-itarian.

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:12.960
No red meat and no poultry.

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:13.960
Yeah, I'm a fish-itarian.

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:14.960
I can't give up sushi.

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:15.960
I just can't.

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:16.960
All right.

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:17.960
Well, anyway, enough about that.

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:18.960
Yeah.

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:19.960
Who the fuck cares about what I eat?

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:20.960
In other words, you're a pretty vegetarian.

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:21.960
Nobody cares about what I eat.

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:22.960
Extra fur.

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:24.440
What kind of games have you been playing this week?

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:27.320
I don't know if you remember, but we talk about video games on this show once in a while.

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:30.680
What kind of video games have you been playing?

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:36.920
I've been playing World of Warcraft and Puzzle Quest, big surprise.

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:40.720
How's World of Warcraft been treating you?

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:41.720
Pretty good.

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:49.720
I'm at the end of a grind in the game, and I don't know.

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:55.680
It's getting kind of boring, because I've gotten a lot of stuff, and so now I'm wondering

01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.480
what to do half the time when I get on.

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:05.480
What are you most looking forward to about Wrath of the Lich King?

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.120
I haven't decided yet.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:15.320
I think just to look in the new areas and stuff like that, explore in the new areas.

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:19.400
When I come back to World of Warcraft, which is probably going to happen, because, oh my

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:22.440
gosh, I can't believe we didn't talk about it during the news, but Final Fantasy XI,

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:27.780
okay, A, I kind of stopped playing a couple weeks ago, but B, they announced that for

01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:32.380
the new expansion is coming out, Wings of the Goddess is the new expansion coming out,

01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:36.840
they have announced one of the new job classes for Wings of the Goddess, Dancer.

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:37.840
So you can shake your booty.

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:38.840
Yeah, I know.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:39.840
Oh, I'm so excited.

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:43.400
By the way, Sauce says it's technically pescetarianism.

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.400
Is that what it is?

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:45.400
Pescetarian?

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.400
Yes.

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.840
Well, not eat the flesh of any animal other than types of seafood.

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.200
Yes, and I don't want to live off seafood, but I just want that to be available, because

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:56.800
I'm doing it for health reasons, not, you know, I'm not a member of PETA or anything.

01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:57.800
This is health reasons.

01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:58.800
People eating tasty animals.

01:16:58.800 --> 01:16:59.800
Well, hey.

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:00.800
What?

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:06.600
If you come back to WoW, then you can't, you're like a, you're a cooker, right, you cook food

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:07.600
in WoW, right?

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:08.600
Yes, yes.

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:10.520
Yeah, so you can't make any meat anymore.

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:11.520
But it's, it's a virtual.

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:13.960
I'll call you a liar.

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:16.440
It's a virtual game, it doesn't matter.

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:17.760
And again, I'm not doing.

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:18.760
It matters.

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:19.760
It matters to me.

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:20.760
Okay, if I was.

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:23.180
If you give me meat, I'm going to call you a liar.

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:27.200
If I was a card-carrying member of PETA, then maybe, but I'm doing it for health reasons,

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:30.720
not, because I'll tell you what, making yourself vegetarian really makes you stop and think

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:34.080
about everything you're eating, whereas usually, you don't.

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:36.240
You don't, like, if you're not on some type of thing, you don't.

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:37.640
But I don't want to talk about food anymore.

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:38.640
Jesus Christ.

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:39.640
All right.

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:40.640
Aw, okay.

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:41.640
See, now everybody in chat is yelling at me.

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:42.640
I should never call myself a vegetarian.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.440
I'm just on a lifestyle adjustment.

01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:45.440
Who cares?

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:46.440
All right.

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:47.440
Excellent meeting up on you.

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:48.440
You're ruining the show.

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:49.440
I had a mushroom Swiss burger today.

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:50.440
It was so good.

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:51.440
You had a what?

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:53.400
I had a mushroom Swiss burger today.

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:54.400
It was so good.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:55.400
I'm so glad to hear it.

01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:57.520
Filled with meat and protein and meat.

01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:58.520
All right.

01:17:58.520 --> 01:17:59.520
I'm hanging up.

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:00.520
Lots of meat.

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:01.520
Buy extra frozen.

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:03.840
But remember, you can only eat top cuts of meat.

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:09.200
It has to all be lean, less than 3%, no, less than 5% fat from meat if you're doing South

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.200
Beach.

01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:11.200
That's right, or you'll balloon up.

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:12.200
Yeah, I know.

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:15.360
You'll balloon up, and you'll look like all those contestants on Biggest Loser.

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.160
You look like Roseanne.

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:18.160
Well, good.

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:21.560
Then I can try out for Biggest Loser next year.

01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:22.560
All right.

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:23.560
I'm hanging up on you, Extrofer.

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:24.560
Okay.

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:25.560
Take care.

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:26.560
I love you all.

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:27.560
Bye.

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:28.560
Bye.

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:32.680
I'm surprised Extrofer didn't use the opportunity to tell us he was talking to us on his iPhone.

01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:36.960
Because usually he'll say, I'm on my iPhone.

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:40.520
Actually the funny thing about Extrofer, he has a whole YouTube series now.

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:42.760
His live journal posts have all been YouTube clips.

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:47.200
Extrofer, if you're still in chat, you can plug your YouTube channel there.

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:50.040
You have to spell his name really funny, so I can't even remember how to get there.

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.480
There you go.

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:55.120
And Extrofer will also be coming back to Orange Launch Radio just as soon as we can get coordinated

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.040
and get our Wednesday show off the ground again.

01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:00.520
But we're going to do something with video this time, because of Op 11 and all that fun

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:01.520
stuff.

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:02.520
I'm going to hide.

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:03.520
Well, it's the Wednesday show.

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:04.520
You're not on it.

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:05.920
I should come on the Wednesday show and bring pizza.

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:07.200
But then you have to be on cam.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.200
No.

01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:09.200
Fine.

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.200
Then you have to wear a paper bag over your head the whole time.

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:12.520
Like Faust from Guilty Gear.

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:14.360
All right.

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:15.840
That's it for the Skype line tonight, you guys.

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:18.080
Thanks so much for tuning in and participating.

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:19.080
Play it.

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:20.080
Appreciate it.

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.080
Play it.

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:22.080
Hold on.

01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:23.080
We're not there yet.

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.080
I'm not there yet.

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.080
Any more last minute stories?

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:26.080
Yes.

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.080
Thank you.

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:28.080
I've been finding more as we wait.

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:32.240
Anyways, some interesting stuff to kind of go back to last week's story, how we talked

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:41.080
about Sony releasing 3.71 firmware for the PSP and the PSP Slim to circumvent the independent

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:42.080
firmwares.

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:49.240
M33 has just released the custom firmware 3.71 to combat that.

01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:54.360
So now you have all the wonderful features of the most current firmware for the PSP and

01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:56.520
you can also run homebrew.

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:58.600
It will never work, Sony.

01:19:58.600 --> 01:19:59.600
Try as you may.

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:03.400
It will never, ever work.

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:07.100
Anyways, some other interesting stuff.

01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:14.760
There is a Chinese MMO company, Shonda Entertainment, who has a MMO called King of the World.

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:22.480
Apparently, they have banned men playing women characters.

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:24.000
You know I only play women characters.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.400
You will be required to prove your gender via webcam.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:31.040
What if it's a really pretty guy?

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:32.040
I know.

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:33.040
That won't be hard to fake.

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.040
What if you're Chris Crocker?

01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:36.280
Or just put your sister in front of the camera.

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:45.600
What if you have a woman who has very masculine features?

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:46.600
You mad.

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:51.000
What do they do with trannies?

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.280
No love for the transsexuals.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:55.960
I love trannies, Rob.

01:20:55.960 --> 01:21:00.840
Pretty soon, actually, their EB is going to be no more.

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:08.600
In fact, GameStop is finishing up converting over the remaining EB Games stores to become

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:10.600
GameStop.

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:18.440
Apparently, the official announcement has to be given, but people are noticing that

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:21.920
more and more EB Games are slowly becoming GameStop.

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:24.560
I wonder what's going to happen to the two that are in the mall.

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:27.080
So it's kind of speculation, isn't it?

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:34.640
Well, they said just this week that two stores in Rochester have already become GameStops.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:37.760
They've noticed more and more since then.

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:41.520
Samurai Shodown 2 is coming to Xbox Live Arcade and the Wii.

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:43.560
That was also the best one in the series.

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:48.280
It was shown at Tokyo Game Show, so people will be happy about that.

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:49.280
Best one ever.

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:54.320
It is coming to the Japanese Xbox Live Arcade, so no word if it's coming to the U.S.

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:57.960
It probably will be.

01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:08.400
Finally, there have been some tools released for modders of the Xbox 360 using a timing

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:13.280
attack with a mod chip that's out there right now.

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:20.520
You can drop your firmware down to one that can be exploited and it will allow you to

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:26.920
install Linux on your Xbox 360 and probably also run Homebrew and, God knows, probably

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:29.960
running backups of games.

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:32.440
Real quick, this is more for in-studio, unfortunately.

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:37.760
Check out this cool add-on for the Arkanoid DS game that's got the little paddle.

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:38.760
That's cool.

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:39.760
I saw that somewhere.

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:40.760
That looks awesome.

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:41.760
Yeah, that's pretty awesome.

01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:42.760
Let's see.

01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:46.840
I think, yep, that's all the stories I had.

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:47.840
Well it's about time.

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:52.480
All right, now DarkSakura, set up this YouTubage I'm going to look at here in studio and the

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:55.280
folks on the stream and podcast will get the audio.

01:22:55.280 --> 01:23:01.040
This was back in the day when there was the big debate between the Dreamcast and the PS2.

01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:07.640
People trying to decide what was better and this is basically a Dreamcast and a VMU talking

01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:09.480
to a PlayStation 2.

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:11.160
Was this an actual commercial on TV or what was it?

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:15.000
No, this is just a fan video and it was on some site a long time ago but a bunch of people

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:21.720
have re-uploaded it but the PS2 was the one with the really snooty voice and the Dreamcast

01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:27.040
is like the regular, you know, talking guy and the VMU is the one that goes, what a disappointment.

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:30.720
I'm hoping this isn't going to buffer like crazy because our net's running kind of slow.

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:31.720
I don't think it will.

01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:32.720
We'll see.

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:33.720
We'll see what happens.

01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:34.720
Hey, PS2.

01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:35.720
Yes?

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:38.200
Me and the VMU were watching you play Ridge Racer 5.

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:39.200
Oh, really?

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:41.400
Yeah, and we thought it looked really good.

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:42.960
Ah, thank you.

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:44.960
Yeah, it looks good.

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:46.960
For us to poop on.

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:54.600
Look me if you must but keep in mind that I am powered by the 128-bit emotion engine.

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:57.960
Yeah, the only emotion you're giving developers is frustration.

01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:01.680
They'd rather be programming on a Saturn.

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:02.680
What a disappointment.

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:07.880
Only top notch Japanese development studios can obtain optimum results from my hardware.

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:11.720
Yeah, then how come Dead or Alive 2 looks better running on me than on you?

01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:12.720
What a disappointment.

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:17.120
Oh, but surely you've witnessed the raw beauty that has Tekken tagged tournament.

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:20.800
Yeah, a game that looks like Tekken 3 running in enhanced mode.

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:21.800
What a disappointment.

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:22.800
Oh, I say.

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:27.040
Do you actually believe your crappy lineup can compete with Jet Set Radio, Grandia 2,

01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:31.920
Echo the Dolphin, Metropolis Street Racer, Furballs, NFL 2001, Eternal Arcadia, somebody

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:33.600
amigo on Sonic Adventure 2?

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:34.600
Oh, yeah?

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:38.600
Well, all that Namco thinks you can handle is Mr. Trio.
