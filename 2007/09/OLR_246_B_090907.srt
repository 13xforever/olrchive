Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,400
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. This is part B of our podcast, taped live on September 9th, 2007.

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,300
And a lot of you guys have been giving us some feedback in our forums lately on orangeloungeradio.com

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,100
on our forums that you guys want to see part B of the podcast a little bit sooner than you're seeing it today.

8
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,800
So you will get the part B of our podcast a little bit sooner.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,400
Very soon we're going to change the order in which, well not the order, but the speed first.

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,900
Yeah, you're not going to get part B first, but we'll change the speed in which we get the podcast out to you guys very soon.

11
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:56,100
And we're going to be making some changes with episode 250, which is coming up very soon if you can believe it.

12
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,100
Yikes. It's very, very soon.

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,000
Alright. So, let's get back into some gaming news, shall we?

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,100
Alright. We shall. So some interesting trademarks

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,900
were made from Nintendo, and of course some things people wondering what they are,

16
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,000
including a Wii body controller, which people are thinking is just the balance

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,300
board or whatever it was called before because it wasn't the final name.

18
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:28,300
Another one Wii handle, which could possibly be either a new controller or possibly something that has to do with, you know,

19
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,800
your online name or something like that.

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,900
Nintendo Magic, which unfortunately is going to be a DS game.

21
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,100
It's to teach you how to do magic.

22
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:45,100
And Mii Audition, which is supposed to be that everybody votes channel for, you know, your Miis.

23
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,600
And then, that's it.

24
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,900
So, also they renewed the Peekman trademark.

25
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,500
So, maybe we'll see a new Peekman game for the Wii.

26
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,500
And, yeah. So, that's it.

27
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,600
I thought Nintendo Magic is what it's going to take for them to do some more online gaming.

28
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,100
Some magic.

29
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,700
No, actually the game already came out in Japan and it's coming out over here in November.

30
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,900
So, it's like a teaching you magic game.

31
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,900
Alright. Very cool.

32
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,300
Well, there's actually a lot of third-party stuff going on with the Nintendo Wii.

33
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,700
And this, of course, is if you want to listen to what Satoru Iwata, the president of Nintendo, has to say.

34
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,100
Quote, I believe that third-party publishers kind of look at the software titles that are being sold on Nintendo.

35
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,600
They don't want Nintendo to have more than one-third.

36
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,200
Otherwise, Nintendo will be too strong.

37
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,300
They want to have two-thirds of what's being sold on the platform.

38
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,600
I believe that the job of first-party software is to drive hardware.

39
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,800
If you don't have a quick impact and a quick dissemination amongst the audience, you lose momentum.

40
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,200
If you don't have momentum, the third-parties don't want to jump on your platform.

41
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,000
So, that's not a good situation to be in.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,600
It's interesting because a lot of people have been paralleling what's going on with the Wii here to the Nintendo DS,

43
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,900
where there wasn't a lot of stuff available for the DS when it first came out.

44
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,900
It took a long time for the titles to really start coming in.

45
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,200
And even Satoru Iwata is aware of this.

46
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,100
Quote, the same thing that happened to the Wii, a lot of the same conversations took place when the DS was launched.

47
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:20,700
And that's because Nintendo was really the only one that was very focused on that user expansion goal we've talked about so often,

48
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,700
and because we are creating unique software that no one else is creating.

49
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,800
The phenomenon of Nintendo software selling was insane.

50
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,100
Hmm. Kind of interesting there.

51
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:35,300
Where do you think the future lies for Nintendo as far as the third-party softwares go, and what's in the future for us?

52
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:44,500
Well, hopefully people will exhaust the stupid ports that they're going to make, and we actually get some better games.

53
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,000
We really need new, innovative, original content.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,100
I guess I can agree with both of that.

55
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:57,200
And Nintendo, I think, needs to open up a bit more of those little things they like to sit on

56
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,200
and then announce later when their own stuff comes out,

57
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,900
need to make things more available to the other developers, I think.

58
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,100
I would certainly agree with that.

59
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,800
So they need to open up the online stuff a little faster, and the DS connectivity, you know,

60
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,100
even though I guess they kind of did that with PokÃ©mon, is, you know, more. Open that up a little more.

61
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,400
We need more, please.

62
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,300
Well, another very interesting development is that

63
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,300
Harvey Birdman, Attorney-at-Law, is coming to the Wii in November.

64
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,600
That looks hilarious.

65
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,500
But it's actually being put out by Capcom,

66
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,900
and it's going to be, and I quote, a fully animated interactive adventure game.

67
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,500
So, um, maybe it's going to be fun?

68
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,700
Think of Phoenix Wright, but just with the Cartoon Network humor, it's hilarious.

69
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,900
And there's, like, they showed one video of it where, like, I guess Guile is in the stands,

70
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,000
and some woman's, like, rubbing his nipples or something.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,800
It was really weird stuff.

72
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,500
But it's, like, it's hilarious.

73
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,100
It's Phoenix Wright, but just not taking itself seriously at all.

74
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,900
I would like to say I saw that at Comic-Con this year,

75
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,500
and what little I played of it was really crappy.

76
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,500
Well, then again, Phoenix Wright doesn't really take itself very seriously.

77
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,700
Did you see the pun that they put in the last Phoenix Wright game?

78
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,200
No, I don't play those games.

79
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,300
Oh, it was, they did this as Sparta.

80
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,300
It was, like, crazy.

81
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,300
Wow, this is not, this is totally original!

82
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,700
This is Sparta!

83
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,500
300, I get it.

84
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,700
Anyways, something that is totally original,

85
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:39,500
a game by Square Enix that's not featuring any Final Fantasy characters.

86
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Wait, how can this, is there any Dragon Quest characters in it?

87
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,300
Uh, I don't think so.

88
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:46,900
Star Ocean!

89
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,500
Is it Tales of Blank?

90
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,500
Blank of Mana?

91
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,100
What is it?

92
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,700
It is a puzzle game.

93
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,300
So, hooray!

94
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,900
Well, you know what, you joke about,

95
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:05,300
Ergeist II, please? No, it's not Ergeist II, that would be fucking awesome, though, seriously.

96
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,300
I would kill for another Ergeist, that would be great.

97
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,100
No, we need, if they have Einhander, they need Zweihander

98
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,100
as the sequel. Two-handed.

99
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,500
No, it's going to be a game called Josumen,

100
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:24,100
and it's a web puzzler in which you arrange blocks into squares

101
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,400
and rectangles and destroy them.

102
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,300
Wow, that sounds like every other puzzle game.

103
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,500
Ever.

104
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,500
No, but seriously, though, I mean, at least they're kind of making something a little different.

105
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,900
I remember, was it, um, there's going to be the, uh,

106
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:43,000
Puzzle Day Harvest Moon coming out in October, so it's like, ooh.

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,500
Um, Dark Tetsuya says,

108
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,800
What they don't tell you is that Cloud and Sephiroth are unlockable characters.

109
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,300
That comment coming from our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

110
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,000
Whatever, Sephiroth, Sephiroth, whatever, I don't care.

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,400
Who cares? Overplayed, that's his name. Overplayed.

112
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,200
Tomato, tomato.

113
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,700
Uh, and Druunami says,

114
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,500
Tales of blank is Namco Bandai.

115
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,700
You know, that's true, and yet I said it anyway, and I knew that.

116
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,500
It's weird.

117
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,900
Like I said, I'm broken tonight, remember?

118
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,600
It's because of all the cocaine you've been doing.

119
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,000
Apparently.

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,100
I don't do drugs, that's not cool.

121
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,900
All right, but what is cool is the Virtual Console,

122
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,300
and what's really, really super cool, Donkey Kong Jr. Math.

123
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,900
That made, you know I actually had a Donkey Kong Jr. Math cartridge, go figure.

124
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,900
Uh, but I, I saw it for like two bucks once, and I thought, ooh, this'll be a collector's item Sunday.

125
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,800
Yeah, I was wrong.

126
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,400
But anyway, Donkey Kong Jr. Math has made its way to the Virtual Console this week.

127
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,800
I guess you could say it was part of like a whole back to school type thing,

128
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,700
because it did come out, of course it's 500 points for Donkey Kong Jr. Math, which by the way,

129
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,900
way too much money for Donkey Kong Jr. Math.

130
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,900
Here, I have a suggestion for you guys.

131
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,400
Here's what you should do.

132
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,500
For, you know, 500 points or five bucks, you could buy Donkey Kong Jr. Math.

133
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah, that may sound like a good deal for you, but how about this?

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,100
Spend just a little bit more money, buy Animal Crossing for the GameCube,

135
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,200
and guess what, look, you've got a bunch of Virtual Console games right there.

136
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,500
By the way, Animal Crossing is one of those backwards compatible games as well, right?

137
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,700
Exactly, and um, it's probably around 20 bucks right now, if not cheaper.

138
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,000
Goddamn, I can't wait for Animal Crossing Wii.

139
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Even if the DS one was a little bit disappointing, because it was kind of the same thing,

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,500
like I really hope they kind of like change it up and make Animal Crossing Wii just awesome.

141
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:34,600
You know what, I was actually using the Japanese GameCube one as a training tool to help me read better,

142
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,800
because it doesn't use any kanji except for like really simple ones,

143
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,400
and they say, you know how they say every letter?

144
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,500
And so when they talk it sounds like...

145
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,400
It still sounds that way, but you can actually hear a little bit more of it like they're actually saying it.

146
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,000
Right.

147
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,900
And so I found it actually to be very educational,

148
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,200
and I kind of hope that they'd have like a language mode in the release that we get.

149
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,500
I think that'd be a good idea.

150
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,100
You never know, it might happen.

151
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,600
Be very cool.

152
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,300
Also, I want to point out what also came out on the Virtual Console,

153
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,400
Adventure Island, which was one of the very first NES games I ever owned.

154
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,300
Adventure Island is also out, and if you want to hop over to the Genesis,

155
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,800
Landstalker, The Treasures of King Knoll,

156
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,900
as well as Bonk 3, Bonk's Big Adventure on the TurboGrafx-16.

157
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,900
Just a note for those of you guys listening on the podcast,

158
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,600
this would be last week's releases by the time you guys hear this,

159
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,200
but for our live listeners on Sunday,

160
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,000
that's all the stuff that came out for you guys this week.

161
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,100
By the way, also, we have a very important message from SSJ100Matt in our chat room right now.

162
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,700
Apparently there's one of those character battles going on on gamefacts.com right now,

163
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,900
and it should be noted now.

164
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,800
Again, this only really will work for those of you guys on Sunday night,

165
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,200
but it should be noted that our beloved,

166
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,400
one of our favorite game characters of all time,

167
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,300
Pyramid Head is in the running right now in the character battle,

168
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,700
and Pyramid Head needs more votes.

169
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,700
He's up against Auron from Final Fantasy,

170
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,000
Chris Redfield from, I believe, Resident Evil, right?

171
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,900
And Shadow the Hedgehog from, of course, the Sonic series.

172
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,200
But Pyramid Head needs your help,

173
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
so please go vote for Pyramid Head,

174
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,000
or else we will send him to your house to rape you.

175
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,400
That's all.

176
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,800
I voted.

177
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,600
Did you vote for Pyramid Head?

178
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
I am very proud of you.

179
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,100
That's all I have to say on Virtual Console,

180
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,200
and go vote Pyramid Head.

181
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,800
I have things to say on Virtual Console.

182
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,900
Well, isn't that nice?

183
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,400
It's all Sega.

184
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
Sega, Sega, Sega, Sega, Sega,

185
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,600
or in this case for the UK, Mega.

186
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Mega Drive Games.

187
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,300
We have Sonic the Hedgehog 3, which is really good.

188
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,000
And then one of my personal favorites, Ghouls and Ghosts,

189
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
which is really still freaking hard even to this day,

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,700
because it's like, let's play Ghouls and Ghosts,

191
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,400
blah, blah, blah, beat Satan.

192
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,200
Oh, I have to play again.

193
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Shit.

194
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,400
So that's, by the way, Ghouls and Ghosts in a nutshell.

195
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,000
And then we have E-Swat, City Under Siege,

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,600
which actually is a game that Dan and I played a little bit of.

197
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,800
Could be like E-Swat for some reason.

198
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,600
And then we have Shining in the Darkness, which is an OK game.

199
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:13,800
And then there was Crackdown.

200
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
I don't remember that.

201
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
You know, I really need to go back and play some more Crackdown.

202
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,800
I remember the Crackdown that came out on 360 a little while ago.

203
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,800
This is two words, Crackdown.

204
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
Oh, that's an old-ass game.

205
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,400
And maybe it had a different name over here.

206
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't know.

207
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Why is it that the folks in the UK get completely different releases?

208
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,600
Why don't they just make it the same for everybody?

209
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,000
You have to save the world from evil cyborgs and then bomb them.

210
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,300
That's kind of cool.

211
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,600
But just to let our listeners overseas know,

212
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
they are 800 points apiece,

213
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,500
translated to 5 pounds 60 and 8 euros.

214
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,800
So there you go.

215
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
All right, check it out if you're in the UK

216
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,200
and need some more virtual console games.

217
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,300
Now to kind of switch gears to something a little different.

218
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,400
Square Enix was saying that PlayStation 3

219
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,200
needs their marketing to be straightened up.

220
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,400
And I think basically referring to,

221
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,800
this is kind of going back to the stories we were talking about in part A

222
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,400
where they were calling it a computer,

223
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,400
strictly a home media center or something like that.

224
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,000
Because basically according to Wada,

225
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,600
he says, Sony first unveiled the PlayStation 3

226
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,800
as a mighty home electronics product.

227
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,400
Then after some badgering from game companies,

228
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,800
it shifted the position of the console closer to a game machine.

229
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,600
The future of the PlayStation 3 would be tough

230
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,700
if its marketing strategy is not straightened up.

231
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,500
And to be honest, I can kind of agree with him a little bit.

232
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,700
If you've seen any of the marketing that they've done

233
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,800
in the UK, especially with this is living,

234
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,200
it makes no fucking sense whatsoever.

235
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,500
And even now, I remember the first commercials that came out for the PlayStation 3

236
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,600
with the crying baby doll and weird shit like that,

237
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,000
it made no fucking sense.

238
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,500
Luckily now though, they show gameplay during their commercials

239
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,900
and just kind of leave it at that.

240
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,400
That is what they need to be doing.

241
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,000
So it sounds like they're kind of smartening up a little bit,

242
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,800
but my god, do not fucking let the people that did the advertising campaign in the UK

243
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,200
get a hold of anything.

244
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,400
In fact, they should all be fired.

245
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,600
Or the people that did the All I Want for Xmas is at PSP.com?

246
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,900
Yeah.

247
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,200
Yeah, all fired. Good stuff.

248
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,800
They all should be sacked.

249
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,000
And then the people that sacked them will be sacked as well.

250
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,400
And then they'll do them again at great expense with llamas.

251
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,900
Alright, well, moving on to something.

252
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,600
And now for something completely different, so to speak.

253
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,800
This is how not to be seen.

254
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,600
There was of course big announcements in the nerd world this week from Apple.

255
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,200
And Apple is launching just in time for the holiday season.

256
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,400
They are launching all sorts of new crap.

257
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,000
Basically now they have an iPhone without the phone,

258
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
which they're calling the new iPod.

259
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,200
They are also releasing a classic iPod.

260
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,000
But what should be noted and what the hell this has to do with gaming

261
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,400
is a new iPod Nano that's coming out.

262
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,200
The new iPod Nano has a little bit more of a wider screen.

263
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,600
And what should also be noted is that not only does the Nano have this,

264
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,000
but the classics ship with this as well.

265
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,500
Some games.

266
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,300
Yes, some games will actually be included with these.

267
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,300
The games will be included Vortex, iQuiz, and Klondike.

268
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,700
iQuiz and Klondike I believe have been available on the store for a little while.

269
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,200
I think Vortex might have been as well.

270
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,400
Vortex is basically like a 3D version of Arkanoid or Breakout, if you will.

271
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,800
Where basically you move the paddle.

272
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,000
And I think that's a pretty creative use of the wheel.

273
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,200
Is that you actually move the little wheel around, which moves the paddle around.

274
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,800
And it's like Breakout.

275
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,800
You're breaking bricks towards the center of the screen.

276
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
So, kind of cool.

277
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,400
I played a whole crap ton of Arkanoid back in the day.

278
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,100
Yeah, back in the day.

279
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,400
So, this is kind of interesting and brings to note that,

280
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:00,000
especially with the release of the iPod without the phone or whatever you want to call it.

281
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,200
It's kind of interesting that Apple does seem to be getting their...

282
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,800
They're sticking their foot in there a little more and more with this whole gaming thing.

283
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,300
And I don't think it's time to say like,

284
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,200
OMG, Apple's going to release a gaming console because we all remember Pippin.

285
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,200
But I think that it's interesting to see, especially when it comes to...

286
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,200
You remember the Pippin?

287
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,200
I completely shoved that out of my head.

288
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,000
I think it would be interesting to see what kind of happens with the whole like,

289
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,200
you know, especially with like classic games.

290
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,400
I'll just tell you...

291
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,600
Sandwich smells.

292
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,200
Get it out of here.

293
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,600
Mmm, sandwich.

294
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,200
Sorry, Eddie.

295
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,400
You can come back when the sandwich is gone.

296
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Here's an old system name that will make you laugh, Rob.

297
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,200
What's that?

298
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,200
Game.com.

299
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Wow.

300
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,400
I have one.

301
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
Really?

302
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
Yes.

303
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,400
Then again, I also had an N-Gage and we gave it away.

304
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,400
You have a lot of like weird consoles.

305
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,400
So, you also have a lot of weird emails this week, I bet.

306
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
Oh, God.

307
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,400
And of course, we always invite our listeners to email us at our website.

308
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,400
Mailbag at orangelonserator.com.

309
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
I want one of these, Rob.

310
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
And send us some emails.

311
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
This is adorable.

312
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
What things?

313
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
I want one of these iPod things.

314
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
Which ones?

315
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
The little one with the square looking one.

316
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
The Nanos or the...

317
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,400
Is that the Nano?

318
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
I actually kind of want an iPhone.

319
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,400
Yeah, that's a Nano.

320
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,400
That's cute.

321
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
I actually kind of want an iPhone now that they dropped in price.

322
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
We'll say that another day.

323
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,400
Let's do the emails.

324
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,400
Okay.

325
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
Mailbag at orangelonserator.com.

326
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Dark Sakura will now open up the mailbag and read a few of her favorites.

327
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,400
At least I'll read a few of the ones that actually have substance to them.

328
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
And I'm sorry, Misty.

329
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,400
I did get both of yours.

330
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
I'm very sorry that you have to work.

331
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Really sorry.

332
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,400
This one's from our friend, Rob with two Bs.

333
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,400
I read in Nintendo Power the next version of William's classic pinball will include

334
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Gorgar, the first talkie, Black Knight, which inspired David's midnight magic, and Pinbot.

335
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
Hooray.

336
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,400
I'm hoping for Z and B to be the flippers for the nunchuck.

337
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,400
And my two bits on Space Giraffe.

338
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,400
Bit one.

339
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,400
I love the arcade's style play and similarity to Tempest 2000.

340
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
Bit two.

341
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,400
The blurry visuals are sort of low res and the game's LSD inspired visuals seem to be

342
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,400
there to make the game harder.

343
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
It's not as good as Tempest, I'm afraid.

344
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,400
I'd much rather have a crisp vector display than a trippy, blurry, inferior graphic.

345
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
At least it was $5 and not $10.

346
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,400
It should also carry an epileptic seizure warning.

347
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
I bought it, but I haven't really played it much.

348
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,400
Boredom get.

349
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
And one last topic.

350
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,400
PS3 pricing.

351
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,400
The original price was intended for the hardcore gamer.

352
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
Not many people wanted it.

353
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,400
It was priced too high for resale on eBay and it was readily available in mid-December.

354
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Did Sony effectively kill the third party market for initial PS3 games?

355
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,400
Did they actually get the money that the eBayers would have gotten?

356
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,400
It's an interesting thought because the answers to both seem to be yes.

357
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,400
They still didn't stop the stabbings and shootings, but I don't blame them for that.

358
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,400
See you later, Rob Bubba.

359
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
I like hearing from Rob.

360
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,400
It's been a little while, so.

361
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
I actually am really looking forward to this whole pinball game that's going to be on the

362
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
Wii that he talked about at the very beginning.

363
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Pinball.

364
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
Like, pin-bot and stuff.

365
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:14,400
I would like to see a reincarnation of the old school pin-bot on the NES as an optional

366
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,400
mode where you could actually have the little aliens come out on the table and try to eat

367
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,400
your ball and all the crazy shit they had on the NES version of the game.

368
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
You know what?

369
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
What?

370
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Right now our NES is hooked up with pin-bot in it.

371
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
That is rad.

372
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,400
Of course, also hooked up to the same receiver is our PS2 with Guitar Hero.

373
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Nice.

374
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
Yeah.

375
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
Anyway.

376
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Many greetings, Orange Orange Radio.

377
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,400
I'm a big fan of your show.

378
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,400
No, it's not that I like your show a lot.

379
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,400
It's just that a lifetime of Doritos has made me very big.

380
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
Wait, who is this?

381
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
I'm only joking.

382
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Mr. Patch.

383
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
Oh, okay.

384
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
I love your show, but for about three months I lost you.

385
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,400
Things really got hectic in my life and schedules got tight, so no time to tune into your show,

386
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
but it lasts.

387
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
About two months ago, I found you in my crazy life.

388
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,400
I found time for you in my crazy life, and damn, I have been enjoying it.

389
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,400
Anyway, I emailed you to ask you guys about Banjo 3E.

390
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,400
I've emailed before about the Banjo series being on 360 in some form, and from that email

391
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
I learned that you really didn't care for Banjo too much.

392
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
No, not really.

393
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,400
And I understand it's not the best game for some hardcore gamers, but for me, Banjo Kazooie

394
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,400
really turned me into the gamer I am today.

395
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Anyways, finally, my question.

396
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Do you think Microsoft will push Banjo 3E when its release date comes near, or will

397
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,400
it be a quiet release like some of the other Rare games?

398
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,400
Thanks for taking the time to read this email, and thanks even more if you answer my question

399
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,400
with curse words.

400
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Love, hey, Mr. Patch.

401
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,400
Well, fuck.

402
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,400
Well, listen here, you little fucker.

403
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
No.

404
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,400
With shit for brains?

405
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,400
No, I'm kidding.

406
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,400
Heart, heart, heart.

407
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
No, we appreciate the email.

408
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,400
Here it is.

409
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Yeah, I'm not the biggest fan of these games, but I think Microsoft will realize that there

410
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,400
is a fan base for the games.

411
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,400
Guys like you, you know?

412
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,400
And I think they will for that reason definitely try to get it out there that, hey, it's back.

413
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
Banjo Kazooie comes back.

414
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,400
And I think you will see a little bit of a marketing campaign like that.

415
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:13,400
I don't think it's going to be near the size that you would see for one of their AAA titles,

416
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,400
but I don't see any reason why I won't get some notability.

417
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,400
I don't think it'll be a quiet release by any means.

418
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
There you go.

419
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,400
I think of Banjo Kazooie, and for some reason I always think of Pandemonium.

420
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,400
Do you remember that game, Rob?

421
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,400
No.

422
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:33,400
Pandemonium was a side-scrolling, very bizarre game, but I actually have the Japanese version

423
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,400
of it, which was Magical Hoppers, and they re-pixeled it or whatever.

424
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,400
But I don't know why, but it's always one of those...

425
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,400
I always think of those very early PlayStation 1 games and the early Nintendo games, and

426
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,400
every game that's come out since then that's in that franchise, like Spyro, I always lump

427
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,400
them into that one category that I label, Why God?

428
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
Why?

429
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,400
SSJ100Matt in our chat room at chat.ornishonorsready.com says, Fuck Banjo.

430
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Give me a new fucking Killer Instincts.

431
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
Ooh.

432
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
Why so much love for Killer Instincts?

433
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,400
Because I've also seen people with a lot of hate for Killer Instinct.

434
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,400
Keep in mind, I played a shit ton of the first Killer Instinct when it...

435
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,400
How many pounds in a shit ton?

436
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,400
I'm going to give my homage to Don French right now.

437
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:34,400
I played croc shits of Killer Instinct when I was in college, and KI2 was very exciting

438
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,400
to me when it came out, except that I hated that they changed all of Orchid's moves.

439
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,400
But it was very, very cool for me, and even to the point where Dan had it on his Super

440
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,400
Nintendo when I lived in Alabama, to the point that he kept starting over and over until

441
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,400
it started off with Orchid's level so he could copy the music for me.

442
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,400
Isn't that romantic?

443
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
That's very sweet.

444
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
Anyway, next email.

445
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
Aw, barf.

446
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,400
Combo Breaker, next email please.

447
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

448
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,400
Oi Peeps, this is no Soul Boy.

449
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,400
Alcohol and Tylenol can kill you.

450
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Prime 3.

451
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
Oh yeah, you weren't here last week.

452
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,400
I was actually, you know what I did last week?

453
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
It was my anniversary.

454
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Weren't you seeing Weirdo?

455
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
I did more than that.

456
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:28,400
On Friday night, Dan and I hung out and did stuff on, well actually I hung out online

457
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,400
and talked to people, and then Dan and I did a couple of things.

458
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Saturday we went to Benihana, and I drank a lot.

459
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:43,400
And Sunday, I cracked open my bottle of Metaxa, which I was going to bring over, and you said

460
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
you were sick.

461
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,400
So I was like, I don't want to get sick, not on my anniversary, so I said I'm not going

462
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
to hang out with Bob.

463
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
It wasn't contagious, whatever it was.

464
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
It's gone, thank God.

465
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,400
Rob had the rocket pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu.

466
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,400
Here's the thing, and I do want to apologize if I came off like an idiot, but I did say

467
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,400
something about, I had been taking Tylenol because I was sick, and I was drinking because

468
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,400
I don't care, and I said something like, it's not going to kill me.

469
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Here's the thing, I am not, obviously if you drink a lot and you take a lot of Tylenol,

470
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
yes, that can kill you.

471
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,400
I'm not stupid, and you know, I've seen a lot of kids do a lot of stupid things, unfortunately

472
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
in my lifetime.

473
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,400
But here's the thing, a little tiny bit, it wasn't that much Tylenol, it really wasn't,

474
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
it wasn't that much liquor I drank last week either.

475
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,400
I think little bits, like a lot of things, moderation is okay, overdoing it, not okay.

476
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,400
So the more you know, NBC, there you go.

477
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
Can I finish my email now?

478
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
You may.

479
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Prime 3, you can die if you don't kill Meta Ridley in time.

480
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Yes, I suck, but give me a break.

481
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
Second Wii game I ever played.

482
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,400
I'm a Mac lover, but iPhones are for people with too much money and too much to do.

483
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,400
Finished Bioshock, that part that scared me was when the Spicers started playing Dead.

484
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Oh, and also the huge room with the water on the floor and the plaster covered ballet

485
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
dancers, very creepy.

486
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,400
I listened to your podcast and Game Theory.

487
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,400
As a designer, I'd really like to hear more about excellent game design as opposed to

488
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
graphics or effects.

489
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:11,400
For instance, on the DC Phantasy Star Online's UI and menu system, amazingly fluid and functional

490
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,400
during gameplay.

491
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,400
Hell yes!

492
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,400
That was, you know, one of the biggest things that I hated about Phantasy Star Universe

493
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,400
is that the menus in Phantasy Star Online were so much freaking better.

494
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,400
Okay, so I'm going to keep going.

495
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,400
Or for anyone who's ever played a squad game to compare it to the four player action in

496
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
Crystal Chronicles on GameCube.

497
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,400
People started working together in a way that is just genius and it's totally obvious that

498
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,400
it was the intent of the designers.

499
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
Or how about most of the games by Treasure?

500
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,400
A-freaking-men.

501
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,400
Talk about walking out on a limb and creating amazing experiences.

502
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,400
These games are perfect arguments for the game as art debate.

503
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
You know what?

504
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,400
Treasure is just, okay, Treasure gave us Ikaruga.

505
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,400
They gave us Bongio.

506
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,400
I love Bongio.

507
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,400
Oh my God.

508
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
The game is so cool.

509
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:07,400
They gave us Silhouette Mirage, which is just, it was, when it came out, it was like something

510
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,400
nobody had ever seen, you know, no one had ever seen anything like that before.

511
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,400
Even that dorky little chameleon twist game was cool.

512
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,400
I mean, Treasure is all about the innovation in gameplay.

513
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,400
You know, another game that you're talking about having people work together is Pac-Man

514
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:31,400
vs. where you have three people on individual game, it's GBAs actually, or a Game Boy SP

515
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,400
because of the connector that they use for it, but they control the ghost and you have

516
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,400
your person as Pac-Man.

517
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
You know, I got to hand it to the GameCube.

518
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Those games that had the connectivity between the DS and the GameCube were a heck of a

519
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,400
lot of fun.

520
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,400
Like the Four Swords Adventures, I had a lot of fun playing that game with some of my friends.

521
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:54,400
It's kind of a shame because you see that potential available on the PlayStation 3 and

522
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,400
the PSP and the whole Wii DS thing, you know, without needing everybody having to have a

523
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
cable.

524
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
Remember, that was the thing.

525
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,400
It's like, sure, a lot of people had Crystal Chronicles, but nobody could play it the right

526
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,400
way because you could never find enough of those damn cables to hook up your DS, or not

527
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,400
your DS, your Game Boy to the system and everything.

528
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:16,400
But, you know, a lot of people, a lot of people have a DS now these days, so it would be so

529
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,400
easy to do something with the whole Wii and the Wi-Fi and kind of bring back those types

530
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
of games.

531
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,400
It would be awesome.

532
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,400
Then you can do the touch and the motion and there's a lot of potential there that I'm

533
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,400
hoping is explored in the next couple of years.

534
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,400
Yes, Eddie's back.

535
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Hey, I'm back.

536
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,400
Yeah, no, I agree because what I was thinking is that on a lot of those games it would be

537
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,400
cool as if the DS was like a device in the game and like if it was like a spy sort of

538
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,400
espionage game, like you would get like secret messages on your DS or something like that

539
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,400
and it would, you know, light up or something like that.

540
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,400
I think that would be cool, like you're saying, make it more like reality, you know, just

541
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,400
make it really interactive with the game.

542
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,400
I think that would be awesome.

543
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,400
You know what else I thought was cool, kind of speaking of that, was that whole, you know,

544
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,400
in a Red Steel, like you could, you'd put the Wii mode up to your ear because it has

545
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,400
a speaker in there and it would tell you what your objective was, like, hey, you need to

546
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,400
kill player three or whatever it is.

547
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,400
That was lame.

548
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,400
It sounded cool, but it was lame.

549
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,400
I know.

550
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:14,400
Unfortunately, the game turned out to be kind of dumb, but I think the idea was good and

551
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,400
I can recognize that that was, you know, especially for a launch title, that was a pretty neat

552
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
usage of the stuff.

553
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,400
Because they could do that like if the phone's ringing in the game or something, like you

554
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,400
put the Wii mode up to your ear or something like that and press A and then it's like,

555
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
you know, they're talking on the phone.

556
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
That'd be cool.

557
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
Well, you can do that in WarioWare.

558
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
That's one of the mini games.

559
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,400
Yeah, you pick up the phone and then you hear it coming out the speaker and the Wii mode,

560
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,400
hello, hello.

561
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
It's really funny.

562
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
That kind of little shit goes a long way.

563
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
I love it.

564
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
So, there you have it.

565
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
All right.

566
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,400
Sorry, that's my response to the email.

567
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,400
I don't even know if that's what they were looking for, but there you have it.

568
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,400
Um, okay.

569
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,400
I'm adjusting.

570
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Wedgies?

571
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,400
No.

572
00:27:54,400 --> 00:28:00,400
This chair's like sitting on, it's like the princess and the pea, you know, where you've

573
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,400
got, hey.

574
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
What?

575
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,400
I'm asking where it would be in Tylenol.

576
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
It's in the bathroom.

577
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,400
Yeah, I believe I do.

578
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,400
Yes, I'll go show you where the Tylenol is.

579
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,400
Jamie reads more emails.

580
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,400
Look at the left side of the cabinet.

581
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,400
This chair's like the princess and the pea, you know, where you have all this cushion,

582
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,400
but you feel that one lump that's like, I can't sit in this chair.

583
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,400
That's it.

584
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Okay, princess.

585
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
Next email.

586
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Hi to you, other lady folks.

587
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
Wave.

588
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:33,400
Anyway, I went to Project Revolution Tour here in Chicago and me and my friend got there

589
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,400
around 1.30.

590
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,400
I found out the band I really wanted to see, Linkin Park, wasn't playing until 9.30.

591
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:45,400
So me and my friend hung out and walked around for a few hours and then we saw MSI, and that

592
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,400
was cool.

593
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:53,400
Now, upon walking around, I discovered a tent that had two long banners that just had three

594
00:28:53,400 --> 00:29:00,400
on them and believe, 9.25.07 at the bottom, you know, so I was like, do one and asked

595
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
the two guys standing there if I could go in.

596
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,400
They said that it was a private party.

597
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,400
After this, I just kind of listened hard as much as you can at a rock concert, and I heard

598
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,400
the distinctive noise of shields recharging.

599
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,400
I knew I had to get in.

600
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:18,400
That was before, as mindless self-indulgence, okay, I was like, hey, that's a band I like.

601
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:24,800
Now, fast forward to the end of the MSI show, I went back to find the tent open with quite

602
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,800
a few people inside.

603
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,680
I stood there with a few other people and knew I was going to get in somehow.

604
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,600
Unfortunately, one guy gave out three passes to three people around me.

605
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:46,280
I stuck around, though, and saw none other than Jay Wineland, the head sound designer

606
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,280
for Bungie.

607
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,960
I pointed to him and said, hey, you're Jay, right?

608
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,960
The sound guy.

609
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,960
He just nodded and smiled and said, wow, that was good, kind of creepy, but good, and disappeared

610
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,160
for a sec, and then he came back with a pass for me to get in.

611
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,640
I was all happy, got his autograph, and went and played.

612
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,520
Let me tell you, Narrows is going to be a classic map.

613
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,600
This is about Halo 3, by the way.

614
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,480
Seriously, the build he had wasn't final, but you could tell it almost was because the

615
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,960
fourth grenade was up there.

616
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,640
Unfortunately, all we had were the following maps, High Ground, Valhalla, Snowbound, Narrows,

617
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,800
Epitaph, Last Resort, and Sandtrap.

618
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,720
One thing I loved about the game overall, everything was colorful.

619
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,560
I don't mean bright colors everywhere, but it was just vibrant.

620
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:26,780
I couldn't see clearly 100% of the time, but unlike in Halo 2, where I have to turn the

621
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,960
brightness up a ton, it looked much better than Gears of War.

622
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,400
Anyway, I didn't see much new stuff.

623
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,680
I really did get to see a game of Infection slash Zombies, though, which I didn't quite

624
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,680
understand.

625
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,680
Weird shrug.

626
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:45,840
So, around 7.30 to 8 o'clock or so, Mike, Rob, and Joe from Linkin Park walk in and

627
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,680
just sit down and start playing.

628
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,600
Everyone in the room outside who didn't get in was all OMG for a while, and people just

629
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
sat down and played.

630
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
I played too.

631
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,080
I totally kicked their butts.

632
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,840
Mike and Joe, the rapper and DJ, were pretty good, and you could tell Rob the drummer doesn't

633
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,840
play much.

634
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,360
I hung around Rob, got his autograph as well, and Mike's later, but Rob was there.

635
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,340
As long as I don't get last place, I'm good, and he didn't.

636
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,340
He did pretty good.

637
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,160
Oh, and that was pretty much the highlight of my summer and definitely the best concert

638
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,160
I've ever been to.

639
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,920
Here's any pictures of the event.

640
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:20,760
So I will actually save this email so that we can put this up on the website.

641
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,760
How's that sound?

642
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
Rad.

643
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,960
Yeah, you should put the pictures up, because I was actually looking at that email earlier

644
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,960
this week.

645
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,240
And that's from Sycoon, by the way.

646
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,120
That's our buddy Sycoon.

647
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,440
Good job, Sycoon, with your field reporting.

648
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,440
More emails.

649
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
Hey.

650
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,440
Yes.

651
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,440
Hey, OLR crew.

652
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,000
There are quite a few new games coming out that are being reported as having short play

653
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
times.

654
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,960
Heavenly Sword, for example, is just six to ten hours.

655
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,760
Now, I don't have a problem with short games, but I do have a problem with paying 60 bucks

656
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,800
for them, so I decided to join Gamefly to rent those shorter games and play them through

657
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,200
without the heavy cost.

658
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,600
Am I not supporting the industry by joining Gamefly?

659
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:06,400
Without this option, I certainly would have bought Heavenly Sword Lair and the sword at

660
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,000
the full price and finished them in a week or two, thus putting more money directly into

661
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
the industry.

662
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,440
Do you think long-term renting options like Gamefly are bad for the industry?

663
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,120
And why is it that every time I pick my nose, it's full again after a few minutes?

664
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,600
Dark Raven.

665
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,480
Okay, wow.

666
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,480
You know what?

667
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,680
Blockbuster didn't kill the movie industry.

668
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:30,720
And Netflix certainly hasn't damaged it either, so why would Gamefly kill the games industry?

669
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,960
Because Gamefly still has to buy all those games from the publishers to get out to rent.

670
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,880
It all depends on how you see it.

671
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,560
I'm sure the publishers don't like Gamefly, but there's nothing really they can do about

672
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,560
it.

673
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,140
I mean, because, I don't know, one argument you could say, well, people are just going

674
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:49,040
to rent games and they're not going to buy them, so, you know, we want people buying

675
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,840
our games, not renting them.

676
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,800
But on the other hand, though, people rent the game, like it, and then maybe buy it.

677
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,800
Yeah, make a game worth buying and people will buy it, right?

678
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,640
Because how many times, seriously, that's what it boils down to.

679
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,240
How many people, I mean, I know I did this when I was a kid all the time, I would rent

680
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,880
a game and I would love it so much, I'd be like, Mommy, Mommy, buy it for me for Christmas,

681
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,880
and she would, because she loved me.

682
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,800
At least that's what she told me.

683
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
To my face.

684
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
So there you go.

685
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,200
Yeah, it's your face behind your back.

686
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
Anyway.

687
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,920
Hey, OLR, I know you guys have been looking for someone who doesn't like Bioshock, and

688
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30,240
even with my praises sung a few episodes ago, I have major complaint about the game after

689
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,840
getting the retail version.

690
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,800
It's far too dark and things that are shooting at you are impossible to see because they're

691
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,760
either too far away and have deadly aim or you can't see them because the whole place

692
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,600
is freaking dark.

693
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,200
Has anyone else had this problem?

694
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,280
I can't be the only one.

695
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,800
The story is going to keep me going through the game, though, it's very intriguing.

696
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:55,000
Cheers and keep up the podcasting AZHP.

697
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,120
I really want to hear, I mean, that was a good email, but I really want to hear from

698
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:02,920
people that, like, fucking hate Bioshock, but not just because I said so, like, I really

699
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,800
want to hear a really good counterpoint to the whole, you know, everybody loves Bioshock.

700
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,000
There's always somebody that doesn't, I mean, there's two sides to every story, so somewhere

701
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,840
on the internet there is somebody that hates Bioshock for a good reason.

702
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,920
I want to know why, and I want to know that reason.

703
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:23,440
I did see something like that on Kotaku, it was from The Consumerist, I want to say.

704
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,320
But was it somebody just trying to be funny?

705
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,320
I don't know if they're trying to be funny.

706
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,400
Because I think I saw something, it was just somebody trying to be funny, like, it wasn't

707
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,760
real, you know, I want to hear, like, some real, like, I hate Bioshock and this is why.

708
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,320
Please.

709
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:45,200
And the last email is actually, wow, kind of long.

710
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,640
It's mostly suggestions for games to do on the show, so I'm going to skip down to the

711
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,560
actual gaming part.

712
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:01,720
To make this email a little more video game related, I'm a Wii PS2 owner that just is

713
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,800
about ready to pounce on the Xbox 360, now the premium has HDMI and a price cut.

714
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,680
But since I've already waited this long, should I wait a little bit longer?

715
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:16,760
And until the Falcon 65nm chips come out?

716
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,760
Okay.

717
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,000
Or with the three year warranty, should I just finally pick one up?

718
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,400
A friend of mine just picked up an Xbox 360 Premium without the HDMI and it died within

719
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,240
a week, and not with the Red Rings of Death.

720
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,800
Any game played would instantly lock up after five minutes of turning the system on and

721
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,320
it wasn't in a cramped cabinet either.

722
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,640
Makes me a little tentative about getting one with the hotter 90nm chips, or if it does

723
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,280
have the extra heat sink.

724
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,040
Since it's not Red Rings of Death and not covered in the extended warranty, although

725
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:53,100
you're still able to take it back to the store, this got long still ended here, and it's by

726
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:57,180
hailstorm in our forums.

727
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,180
Very cool.

728
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,440
I didn't see this email earlier in the week, and I'm looking at the ideas.

729
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,440
It just came.

730
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,120
Yeah, I love some of these ideas that are in there.

731
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,120
That's great.

732
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,360
In fact, one of the games he suggests we do on here is Family Feud, and that's something

733
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,800
I've been trying to do, like put together, but I can't figure out a good way to do it.

734
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,800
So I like some of these suggestions.

735
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
I'm going to read through this in more detail later.

736
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,760
But anyway, the meat and potatoes of the interview here down there.

737
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,520
Should I get an Xbox 360 now or wait?

738
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,520
Here's the deal.

739
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,000
I honestly think it'll be, I mean, maybe they'll do a little tiny chip set switcheroo, but

740
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,480
I don't think it'll be that big a deal.

741
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,500
The games they're putting out now, I mean, any game they put out is going to be designed

742
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:35,460
to run flawlessly on the, well, if all the testing is done the way it should be, to run

743
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,360
as best as it can on the consoles that are out now.

744
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,160
So I wouldn't worry so much about waiting for a chip set, and here's the thing, if you're

745
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,960
waiting for price reduction, new package or whatever, ain't going to happen for a year

746
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,880
till next Christmas season, or at least well after Christmas.

747
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:53,340
So I would say, unless you're prepared to wait six months for some significant changing

748
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:58,680
in the structures, price, offerings of the 360, just go get one now.

749
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:04,720
Honestly, as long as you document, I think, whatever happens, we've actually only had

750
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,760
to return one system, but I think that we did it through the store itself, and we've

751
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,200
actually got the elite now, Dan and I do, and it's, we've never had a problem.

752
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,240
And if you're also worried about that whole, oh, I went out and got an iPhone, oh shit,

753
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,240
they just dropped the price by 200 bucks, I got screwed, don't worry, that won't happen.

754
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,240
Well, there's a rebate, too.

755
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,000
Yeah, well, I guess now they're doing the $100 rebate or whatever, but still, I know

756
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,040
some people who bought an iPhone that weren't happy when they heard that announcement.

757
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,040
I know a lot of people weren't.

758
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,000
I'm sure I know who you're referring to.

759
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Several people I know weren't happy, but yeah.

760
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,560
Well, um, oh, shoot, I was going to say something else about the Xbox 360, oh, yeah, I, though

761
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:51,160
have not seen what the HD movies look like on the Xbox 360, but I have seen an HD movie,

762
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,000
and I kind of like Blu-ray better, I hate to say it.

763
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,480
The quality is exactly the same.

764
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,600
Well, and, you know, and that's so, am I the only one that's not that intensely excited

765
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,400
about this next gen of video?

766
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,920
I mean, it's like, DVD, yeah, DVD was a huge, I mean, it was a huge contrast from VHS, but

767
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,480
I'm like, eh, the picture's a little better, I'm like, I don't know.

768
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,440
Actually, actually, actually, as a laserdisc player owner, I was very upset with a lot

769
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,320
of DVDs that came out, because, um, keep in mind that with laserdisc, you actually had

770
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,180
much less compression.

771
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:26,940
My laserdiscs of Tron, because I have the big, the nice special box set, are infinitely

772
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,880
better than the DVDs of Tron.

773
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,200
Here's the thing about the whole next gen thing, is that what's out there now is just

774
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,280
a bunch of bullshit, but you have to think about the finish line, because when all is

775
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,800
said and done, what else is going to move into the next generation of video?

776
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,800
Porn.

777
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:48,280
And, you know, when they start making HD, DVD, and Blu-ray porn, you are so there in

778
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,440
the next generation of video.

779
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,160
They already have that, and I'm not so there.

780
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,160
And they're rawr!

781
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,960
Rob, we still need to see Pirates.

782
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,520
Oh, don't they have Pirates on HD?

783
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,520
And Blu-ray.

784
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,520
Ooh!

785
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,520
I think I'm going to get the Blu-ray.

786
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,800
I used to work at a video store, and people would be like, you know, I want to return

787
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,960
this movie, because when I pause it, I couldn't see the picture, and it's like, okay.

788
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,960
Okay, listen.

789
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,240
I do have HD porn.

790
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,560
I stream it to my 360, because, thank you, media center extender.

791
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,680
But you know what, Black Boy, that's what Black Boy says in chat, is, Black Boy says,

792
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,640
who goes out and buys porn discs?

793
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,200
It's all download today.

794
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,600
Here's the thing, no, I'm not saying I'm going to go buy the porn discs.

795
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,800
I am someone who buys a lot of porn.

796
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,520
Here's the thing, though.

797
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,440
I'm waiting for the discs to come out, so someone can rip them and put them on the internet,

798
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,680
and then I can download them.

799
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,680
See?

800
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,440
Well, you really need to get out, I mean, seriously, this stuff's out there already.

801
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,440
For the record, the only reason I have a Blu-ray player is because we actually bought a PS3.

802
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,760
I'm not saying it's horrible, I'm just saying, I'm not saying it's horrible, I'm just like,

803
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,440
I'm not that, I was like, really, really wanting to get a DVD when they came out, a DVD player,

804
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,320
and I'm not, I'm like, eh, you know, I can wait until they battle it out between HD and

805
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,320
Blu-ray.

806
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,480
I'm sort of thinking about, if I did buy a new computer, I think the next one I get will

807
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,480
be a VIO because all the new VIOs come out with Blu-ray players, and they cost the same

808
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,880
that my old one did when I got it new.

809
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,880
Hmmm.

810
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,880
Mm-hmm.

811
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,880
Or meh.

812
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,880
Meh.

813
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,920
Is that it for emails?

814
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,520
Yes, Rob.

815
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,520
That's it.

816
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,520
Buy mailbag.

817
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,520
Alright.

818
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,520
Now what?

819
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,520
Back into some news.

820
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,960
Yes, news.

821
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:37,040
So anyways, this is not surprising, but it's actually pretty cool.

822
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:43,600
Manhunt 2 has leaked out online, and that would be the uncensored beta from European

823
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:49,160
regions because it is in PAL format, so of course everybody's been jumping on the bit

824
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,760
to actually play it.

825
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:58,080
No word if it's any, you know, if it plays well or not because it is beta, but I'm definitely

826
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,440
going to find out.

827
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,440
Ew, Mr. DeBucket in chat says Manhunt 2 has neck raping.

828
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,440
Is that true?

829
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,440
That's gross.

830
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,440
Ew.

831
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,000
I don't know, but I heard there's something about ripping off testicles in the game.

832
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Ahhh!

833
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
It sounds awesome.

834
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Eddie just covered his balls in the studio.

835
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
That game sounds great.

836
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,040
I cannot wait to play this on the Wii.

837
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,320
If you're a woman, and you don't have balls.

838
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,160
Oh my God.

839
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,760
How would you like it if some chick got her titties ripped off?

840
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,760
That's similar.

841
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,760
Hey, you know what?

842
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,720
It's going to be some crazy interactivity where you move out the Wiimote and then yank

843
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,840
it back to yank off the testicles.

844
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,840
Exactly.

845
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,880
It'd be like the harpoon in Zelda.

846
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,680
Oh my God.

847
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,480
Okay, the chatroom said apparently it's a running gag on All Games Interactive, one

848
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,480
of our buddy shows.

849
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,800
Neck raping is some type of joke.

850
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,960
Neck raping is not a joke.

851
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,240
That's not a fucking joke.

852
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,240
That's gross.

853
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,840
What if someone has a tracheotomy?

854
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:01,680
Ew, you want to fuck somebody's hole that you said a tracheotomy?

855
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,680
That's disgusting!

856
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,080
I was trying to think how would that work?

857
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,720
And I would think that it would have to either be someone with their head chopped off or

858
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,720
a tracheotomy.

859
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,920
That would be a two-part explicit episode this week.

860
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,920
Congratulations, crew.

861
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,920
You've done good.

862
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,080
They could talk to you while they're giving you a blow job.

863
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,080
They could.

864
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,360
I'm so glad you're not holding a microphone right now.

865
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:27,880
And that Op11 is down.

866
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:34,520
Oh my God.

867
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,520
That's wrong.

868
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,520
Now you just need a smoker.

869
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,520
Tracheotomy, man.

870
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:44,960
I started playing Manhunt 2 and I'll tell you it's not funny.

871
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,600
Wow.

872
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:53,520
Anyway, the guy who directed Doom is directing the new Street Fighter movie and it's probably

873
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,120
going to be just as shitty as the old one.

874
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,680
The end.

875
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,680
Yeah, I think that about says it.

876
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,440
I mean, gosh, there was an awful lot of internet articles about it, but I think Jamie summed

877
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,440
it up very well.

878
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,760
Here you go.

879
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,760
Yep.

880
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,760
I'm brilliant.

881
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,640
I really hope they don't destroy some guy's wonderful movie career and then that guy dies,

882
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:18,760
like kind of like Raul Julia, like his last movie role was M. Bison, you know, or at least

883
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,880
his last big screen movie role was M. Bison and Raul Julia was awesome.

884
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,360
Like who didn't love Gomez Adams, but anyway.

885
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:34,840
All I know is that when I hear about the shitty video game trends, shitty-os, shitty-os, new

886
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:42,600
shitty-os from the makers of Doom, the movie, it's brand new shitty-os.

887
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,600
You know what?

888
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,600
Forget the story.

889
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,960
When I can't talk for an entire night, I get angsty and that means it's F.U.'s of the week

890
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:58,600
time.

891
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,720
F.U.'s of the week time.

892
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,280
Start off with Dark Sakura.

893
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:08,960
F.U. goes to my sinuses for making F.U. goes to my toilet.

894
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:14,360
We have a, we've had this clog in our pipes that what happens is that it makes the toilet

895
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:25,120
back up or it backs up, it backs up, well, sewage into our tub and it sucks.

896
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:30,520
So our landlord came out and it was digging around the pipes trying to fix it, so I hope

897
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,600
it sticks by the time we get home.

898
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,560
Yes, you can say an F.U. to a video game company, Eddie.

899
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,400
F.U. to LucasArts for saying, we're considering making a game for the Wii.

900
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,400
I'm like, fuck you.

901
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,360
I mean, oh my god, this is like the best system ever and that like, LucasArts is awesome and

902
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,000
they need to like get out their ass and stop thinking about it and actually make a game

903
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
for the Wii.

904
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
So fuck you, LucasArts.

905
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,440
I should say Eddie is an unapologetic Nintendo fanboy, right?

906
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,440
Exactly, exactly.

907
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:01,320
Has a Sony or Microsoft product or Sega product, for that matter, ever been in your house?

908
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,320
Never.

909
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,320
Fanboy.

910
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,320
Alright, Logie.

911
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:10,200
Uh, fuck you to crappy pizza, especially at John's Incredible Pizza, because it was not

912
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,760
incredible, it was incredibly crappy.

913
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,760
Although, props to that-

914
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,440
It probably gave you incredible diarrhea, too.

915
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,920
No, it did not give me incredible diarrhea, but it was just like, it was like, wow, I

916
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,240
can tell you spent a lot of money on this, what, there's a whole like two pepperonis

917
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,240
on this pepperoni pizza they have?

918
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:32,080
I mean, seriously, it's just, it was pretty lame, but uh, whatever.

919
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:38,920
Uh, I want to give an F.U. first off to my voice, because apparently I can't talk at

920
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,280
all tonight, and it's really ruining the show for me.

921
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,560
Uh, and then I just want to give an F.U. to, um, people that start out like really nice,

922
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,120
like they want to be your best friend in the world, and like, you know, oh I love you and

923
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:55,040
da da da, and then they turn into like a total psycho-host beast.

924
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:01,320
I'm not talking about you, Jamie, although you've done that, too.

925
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,680
No, no, no, I'm talking about work-related situations.

926
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:08,760
I, I actually was actually thinking, you said that and I started thinking about, started

927
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,760
thinking about somebody.

928
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,760
What?

929
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,760
I'm not gonna say my name.

930
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,760
Oh.

931
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,760
I can probably think about it, yeah.

932
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know what you're talking about.

933
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,760
Alright.

934
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,760
Haha.

935
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:26,280
O.L.R. rumors you guys will never know about, so that's all I wanted to say, F.U. too.

936
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:34,060
Anyways, um, so, EverQuest, yeah, that wonderful game, EverQuest, um, EverQuest 1 and 2 have

937
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:41,680
added a brand new card game called Legends of Norrath, and, um, yeah, I guess it's gonna

938
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:51,480
be, um, Oath, the Oathbound series will feature 375 cards in a 55 card starter deck for $9.99

939
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:58,400
and 15 card booster packs for $2.99, and the game is playable from EverQuest 1 or 2, although

940
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:05,640
there will be a stand-alone client, um, due out for free in September, actually this week,

941
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,640
on Wednesday.

942
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:15,240
So, um, I don't know, just trying to cash in, I guess, on the collectible card games.

943
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:21,720
And EverQuest, it's such a, you know, uh, new product, I don't know.

944
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,760
These MMOs last forever, I mean, if you think about it, Final Fantasy XI is five years old,

945
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,440
if you can believe it, so these MMOs last forever.

946
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,880
They really do.

947
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,880
So.

948
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,880
Alright.

949
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,320
Uh, anyway, speaking of MMOs, I have a comment.

950
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,320
What?

951
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,320
Yes.

952
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,480
How old is Final Fantasy?

953
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,480
Five years.

954
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,120
Just old enough to be raped now.

955
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,680
What is wrong with you?

956
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,120
You missed our discussion on neck-raping earlier.

957
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,120
Really?

958
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,120
Ow!

959
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,080
That's what you get for watching, thank you for punching him, that's what you get for

960
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,880
watching Battlestar Galactica during the show.

961
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,480
Now stay quiet until the next, your segment, alright?

962
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,480
Alright.

963
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,480
Fine.

964
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,360
Uh, moving on, speaking of MMOs, there is a new Missed Online episode coming soon to

965
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,360
Missed Online, which of course is part of the GameTap service.

966
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:11,000
It actually just debuted this weekend, and it's called Deception.

967
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,640
There's a new guild system being built into the game.

968
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,360
It's going to have a guild, actually I think there's already a guild system, but now the

969
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,880
guilds are getting pubs, and so you can actually meet up in this pub, and some new storylines

970
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,880
are being added into the game.

971
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,800
And of course Missed Online is a part of GameTap, so if you're a GameTap subscriber, you get

972
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:26,800
access to Missed Online.

973
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,160
I played Missed Online for like three days, but I found it to be really, like I didn't

974
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,840
know what the hell I was doing.

975
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,720
Like there needs to be a little more, like even though I thought it was cool, they had

976
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,520
like live actors that actually did introductions and initiations, I just wish there had been

977
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,400
a little more like, what the fuck do I do with this game, like kind of like talk.

978
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,660
So that's all, but otherwise I thought Missed Online was actually a really good looking

979
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:53,880
game, and considering I like GameTap as it is already, and I swear I'm not on their payroll,

980
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:58,060
I think it's a nice addition, I mean you pay next to nothing for it with all the other

981
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,920
crap that's there, so it's pretty cool.

982
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:06,780
Well, how is this for happy and sad at the same time?

983
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:17,080
You know what, it's the Dreamcast's birthday, poor, poor Dreamcast, how we miss you, 8th

984
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,160
birthday of the Dreamcast.

985
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:25,440
8 years, wow, that's not very long, would you consider how long ago the Dreamcast was

986
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,440
now?

987
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:36,600
They brought us though, we had Power Stone, Bongio, Ikaruga, Choo Choo Rocket, Soul Edge,

988

well there is no crackdown sequel in development right now

1271
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:07,560
and the reason being is that microsoft was a little late uh... to ask

1272
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:12,440
uh... them to actually make a sequel so now they're working on a new m m o

1273
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,000
called all points

1274
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,080
bulletin

1275
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:19,440
which or a p it's going to be a uh... m m o

1277
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:26,600
so that sucks you know what i'm world's isn't making a sequel hold on is that

1278
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,320
really such a bad thing

1279
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,960
i mean think about for a minute i know you guys all of crack down i'm not

1280
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,520
going to strike out no no no hold on though

1281
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,020
i mean what is the number one bitch people have about the gaming industry

1282
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:40,120
long time has they're not original enough a lot of the things you see out

1283
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,080

1284
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:45,280
socially kind of support a company that says you know what

1285
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,960
we don't really want to make a sequel right now

1286
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,280
is there really such a bad thing what was it that they don't want to make a

1287
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,120
sequel they wanted to make a sequel is that they didn't approach him for a

1288
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:55,560
sequel

1289
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:59,560

01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:18,300
No.

1320
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,100
All right, what do you want, Ravensdolvin?

1321
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:23,200
I forgot to tell you that I fail at computers.

1322
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,900
Congratul- Yes you do, congratulations.

1323
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,900
All right, real quickly, you've had too much showtime.

1324
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:28,900
What's your question tonight for us?

1325
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:31,100
My Xbox died, that's it.

1326
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,300
That's not a fucking question.

1327
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:34,300
That's not a question.

1328
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,300
No, I just want to tell you that I'm sad.

1329
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,800
Oh, I'm sorry, here's the Kleenex.

1330
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:42,100
All right, if you want to call us, 1877-GAME-OLR,

1331
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:47,600
or our username is OrangeLaunchRadio on Skype.

1332
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,900
Meanwhile, I'm looking at chat comments.

1333
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:53,400
There has been a lot of chat comments tonight I've read, I apologize.

1334
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:56,700
Velurno, I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing your name, I'm not sure how to say that.

1335
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:59,200
Velurno says, I wanted a Crackdown sequel,

1336
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:02,600
and puts those dejected little three dots right after that comment there.

1337
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,900
So, sorry about that.

1338
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:07,400
All right, we got some more calls though, let's go to the calls.

1339
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,900
Hi, you're on OrangeLaunchRadio, who's this?

1340
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,200
Hey guys, this is FootyMonster.

1341
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,700
Hello, FootyMonster, how are you?

1342
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,500
I'm doing just fine, what about you guys?

1343
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:18,300
Good, hey, I don't know if I'm supposed to say this publicly,

1344
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:21,500
but I heard you guys got picked up by AllGames, the ultimate quest.

1345
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:24,300
That is correct, yeah, I think it's public knowledge by now.

1346
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:28,200
We were promised a long time ago, but it just comes to friction right now.

1347
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:32,700
So, about a week or two, we're going to be on AllGames on the stream and stuff like that.

1348
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:35,000
Congratulations, that's okay, because you know what?

1349
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Hey, ScottBlue, something that I thought was a secret,

1350
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,900
that I guess he said on the show,

1351
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:43,000
and I was trying to keep it a secret.

1352
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,900
Are we supposed to keep that a secret, or can we say it?

1353
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:46,800
No, I think we're supposed to keep that a secret.

1354
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,100
All right, then I won't say it.

1355
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,000
All right, oh, it's a secret.

1356
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Later, I will tell you later, like, I don't know,

1357
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,000
maybe during a certain upcoming expo, we can give you more information.

1358
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,300
Not that I know anything, or don't, but that's it.

1359
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:01,700
FootyMonster, what do you have for our listeners tonight?

1360
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:04,700
Well, basically, I just wanted to share with you guys,

1361
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,200
I don't know if it's a review or something,

1362
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:09,200
but Persona 3, which is this new game for the PS2,

1363
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:12,600
it's an RPG, and I just wanted to let everyone know,

1364
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,200
because it's probably underrated and under the radar.

1365
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,400
It's from the Shin Megami Tensei universe,

1366
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:21,800
if anyone ever played one of those games, like Nocturne or Digital Devil Saga.

1367
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:25,800
Nocturne was the game in which Dante from Devil May Cry made a cameo and stuff,

1368
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,000
so it was known back in the day in the PS2.

1369
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,400
And Persona 3 came out, and it was really, really, really good,

1370
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:34,400
and I've been playing it, I've put, like, 40 hours into it,

1371
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,000
I'm not even halfway done.

1372
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,600
It's deep as hell, and it's really good.

1373
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,200
I don't know if you guys have heard anything about it, or...

1374
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,700
You know what's funny?

1375
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:46,800
I'm holding here in my hand the Persona 3 trade demo we got sent from Atlus,

1376
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,100
and I have to admit, I have not played it still.

1377
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:50,000
Shame on you, Rogue.

1378
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,500
All right, I'll give it to Jamie to play.

1379
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:57,200
I swear I was going to play it, but then I went back to Final Fantasy XI.

1380
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,100
Have you played Overlord yet?

1381
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:01,500
No.

1382
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:04,600
But I will.

1383
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:08,600
What makes this game so great compared to the Final Fantasies of the world,

1384
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,600
where, you know, most people you say,

1385
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,100
what's the greatest role-playing game of all time?

1386
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:15,000
People will say Dragon Quest, or they'll say Final Fantasy VII.

1387
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Why is it so great?

1388
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,900
Well, this is the thing.

1389
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:22,800
It's not just an RPG. They try to break the mold a little bit.

1390
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,200
And as you know, RPGs are really...

1391
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,500
They're falling flat every day more and more.

1392
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,100
They're not that amazing anymore.

1393
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,600
They're never anything new in them,

1394
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,700
except for, you know, kind of cases like Bioware releasing Mass Effect and stuff like that,

1395
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:38,800
which is a massive world or anything, or something like that.

1396
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:42,000
This game, however, it's a single-player experience, but it's so huge.

1397
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,800
Like, you don't just fight.

1398
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:47,400
You also have to live the life of the character, as in you go to school.

1399
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:50,300
You, you know, you gotta make friends with people.

1400
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:53,000
You gotta develop your relationship with everyone else.

1401
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,400
And it's not just that it's tacked on.

1402
01:11:55,400 --> 01:12:00,700
Also, you use that as a means to get more powerful in the game on the fighting aspect of things.

1403
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:06,400
So, it's like they made this perfect balance between fighting and normal dungeon crawling,

1404
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:11,700
and all this other stuff that's just about story and developing characters.

1405
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:13,000
All right. Well, that sounds kind of cool.

1406
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,900
I mean, I definitely have to check it out at some point. I will. So many games.

1407
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:19,100
Tokimeki meets RPG.

1408
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:24,400
I would say so. It's kind of like a date scene, if you think about it that way.

1409
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:24,900
Yeah.

1410
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:31,000
But, you know, in the sense that, yeah, you need to raise your academic status to do better at school,

1411
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,900
and that in turn will unlock the chance of you to date a certain girl,

1412
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:38,900
which in turn will give you the chance to get this certain magic spell,

1413
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:41,900
which will make you more powerful in the fighting side of things.

1414
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,300
That's pretty cool.

1415
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:47,600
So, it's forcing you, but at the same time, if you don't want to do it, you don't want to do it.

1416
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,600
But, there's a lot of benefit from it.

1417
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:55,400
So, they actually motivate you into looking further into the game rather than just the fighting aspect of the game.

1418
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,400
All right. I'll give you that. It sounds kind of interesting.

1419
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,300
I definitely will have to check it out at some point.

1420
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:01,300
You win.

1421
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:05,600
I mean, on the show, a couple weeks ago, we did review the whole thing in length.

1422
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:09,100
I spent like 20 minutes talking about it because it's really, really that good.

1423
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:09,700
Very cool.

1424
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:14,700
Well, so, you can go ahead and plug your show real quick so they know where to go download that if they want.

1425
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:17,200
All right. So, it's UltimateQuest.net.

1426
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:21,200
It's a show that I did with Shadow Slayer, Jack Ransom, and Xenocore.

1427
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:24,200
And I believe that was episode 21, I want to say, or 22.

1428
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:27,500
I forgot right now because we're, you know, it was a couple of weeks ago.

1429
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,000
Oh, and I said I'd come on the show.

1430
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I sent a reply message back because I didn't see an email for like a week.

1431
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,700
But, any of us will, I'm sure if you can work in the time with any of us, we'll all come on at some point

1432
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:39,700
and talk nerdy role-playing.

1433
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:44,700
Yeah, I know that Xenocore talked with you about maybe you doing, we have this little thing called the Ultimate Side Quest,

1434
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:48,200
which is a show that we do on and off, sometimes like once a month.

1435
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:51,700
And it's like a discussion, it's not just about the news, but about like maybe a topic,

1436
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:57,200
like let's say tabletop RPG gaming and how it would make RPGs in the consoles better.

1437
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,700
That was the topic of the latest one.

1438
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:02,700
You'll have to get Jamie for that one because I don't do a lot of tabletop.

1439
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:05,700
I haven't been doing any in the past month.

1440
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:06,700
That's not that long.

1441
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:08,700
Yeah, I was playing D&D.

1442
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:09,700
Very cool.

1443
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:13,200
All right, well, Footy, thanks so much for the input and for the game suggestions.

1444
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:16,700
You've been full of game suggestions lately, from the Hannah Montana DS to this.

1445
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:20,200
I got to spread the Hannah Montana love. It's awesome.

1446
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:23,700
You better be calling back in a couple weeks and telling us about the next game we all need to be playing.

1447
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:26,700
Oh, that reminds me, Loki, do not buy Jam Sessions.

1448
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:30,700
I have the Japanese version. It's not good. It's not good.

1449
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,700
It's cheap though.

1450
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:34,200
It really is.

1451
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,700
Loki likes cheap.

1452
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:39,700
I'm not buying Hannah Montana. I can tell you that much.

1453
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:41,700
I will buy Hannah Montana.

1454
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:43,700
All right, you do that.

1455
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:45,700
All right, bye, Footy Monster. Thanks for the call.

1456
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:46,700
Talk to you later, guys.

1457
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:52,700
All right, if you want to give us a call or use the name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR,

1458
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:54,700
and let me take this opportunity to remind you guys.

1459
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:58,700
You've probably heard Raven on the show before and Footy Monster on the show before.

1460
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:00,700
That's because they're actually calling in.

1461
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:04,700
So if you want to call in and be on the show sometime, make sure you're actually listening to the program.

1462
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,700
Sunday nights at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1463
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:09,700
Let's go back to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1464
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:10,700
GS68.

1465
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:12,700
Hello, GS68. What's on your mind?

1466
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:17,700
Oh, someone sent an email complaining that Heavenly Sword was too short, right?

1467
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:18,700
Mm-hmm.

1468
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:25,700
Well, when I was younger, game took less than an hour to complete. It had no save points.

1469
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:30,700
So people are saying that Heavenly Sword is too short of a game.

1470
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,700
Yeah, 10 hours.

1471
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:38,700
10 hours isn't that short. 10 hours is about how long it took to beat Silent Hill 2, and that's a beautiful game.

1472
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:44,700
So, you know, I don't think it's such a bad thing that the games are necessarily short, as long as it's fun.

1473
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:48,700
You're right. Like, a lot of those old-school NES games, like, they were really good.

1474
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:53,700
Like, God, I could probably beat Super Mario Brothers in, like, 15 minutes, if that.

1475
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:58,700
Yeah, or Mario 2. I just got that on Virtual Console, and that's like a 15-minute game if you know all the power-ups and stuff.

1476
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:05,700
But it's part of the, is it fun to replay over and over again, because a game like Super Mario Brothers 2, hell yeah, it's fun to play over and over again, so.

1477
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:12,700
It's really short. I mean, you can beat it in under two hours, and there are people who play it over and over again.

1478
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:20,700
Yeah. So, hey, you know, a game is all about fun, you know, but considering how much they're charging for these games,

1479
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:26,700
if it is only a 10-hour game, it better be a really fun 10-hour game, like six bucks an hour good.

1480
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:31,700
But if you think about it, I mean, hell, they charge $10 for an hour and a half movie, so why not?

1481
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:33,700
Yeah.

1482
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:36,700
Now, are you buying Heavenly Sword, Loki?

1483
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:38,700
Maybe.

1484
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:40,700
Are you buying it, GS68?

1485
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:44,700
No, I don't really have much interest in games like those.

1486
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:48,700
I'll probably give it a rent, since I can rent for free.

1487
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:52,700
There you go. Here's one of those rent-before-you-buy things.

1488
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:55,700
Maybe you'll rent it and beat it, and then wonder, do I want to play this again?

1489
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:58,700
What money is it out of my pocket?

1490
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:00,700
All right.

1491
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,700
If it's free, I'll do almost anything.

1492
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,700
Tigerclaw has an interesting point.

1493
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:09,700
I hate games that force you to play on a hard difficulty just to see the better ending.

1494
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:11,700
Oh, no kidding.

1495
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:17,700
If it's normal, then I don't mind, because in my opinion, if it's easy difficulty, you're a pussy.

1496
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:22,700
But I don't really do hard mode a lot on games.

1497
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:28,700
There was a Star Wars game on N64 that you couldn't even see the ending unless you got to the ending and it's all,

1498
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:31,700
to see the ending played in hard mode, I was like, fuck you.

1499
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:34,700
Here's the thing, though.

1500
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:36,700
Oh, shoot.

1501
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:39,700
It was like the only Star Wars. No, it was other than Rogue Squadron.

1502
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:43,700
Yeah, the one that wasn't Rogue Squadron. It was the one where you play the guy.

1503
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,700
I have that game.

1504
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:48,700
Here's the thing, though. I think those subtle ending differences are pretty cool.

1505
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:52,700
I go back all the way to the original Metroid.

1506
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:57,700
When you played it the first time, it probably took you forever and a day to actually beat it, and so you got the crappy ending.

1507
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:06,700
But then somebody at school tells you, hey, if you play it really fast, then you get to see the chick take all her clothes off.

1508
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:08,700
Which is people stretching the truth a little bit.

1509
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:12,700
But who didn't run home and play through the game just as fast as they could to see if there was that other ending in it?

1510
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:14,700
I know I did.

1511
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:18,700
There you go, C.

1512
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:23,700
I tried to get under three hours in Super Metroid, not just for the accomplishment, but because of, you know.

1513
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:28,700
Or even the games with all the different multiple endings, if you did things a different way or did it the harder way, like Chrono Trigger.

1514
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:35,700
You start off, if you do save game plus and start off and just beat Lavos right away, you get the developer ending.

1515
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:37,700
That was pretty cool.

1516
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:42,700
Yeah, stuff like that's really cool.

1517
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:44,700
Those did Airspace, apparently.

1518
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,700
Sorry, I was reading stuff.

1519
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:49,700
Okay, so anything else you want to share with our listeners, DS68?

1520
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:53,700
Yeah, I finally got around to playing 2DX Distorted on PS2.

1521
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,700
And what'd you think?

1522
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:57,700
It's pretty good.

1523
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:11,700
I haven't played any, well, I don't have any 2DX between 9th and 13th styles, so there's a lot of features that are new to me, like all the score data from the arcade and such.

1524
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:15,700
Yeah, I haven't bought a 2DX game since 9th style either, but I did play a lot of Red.

1525
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,700
I don't know, we'll see.

1526
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:20,700
I'm kind of over a lot of those Konami music games, I have to admit.

1527
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:25,700
It's the same fucking thing for like five years now, so I'm ready for something new.

1528
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:28,700
So when Konami's ready to give me something new, I'll go back.

1529
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:31,700
Or, you know, I do still buy the new DDR games on consoles.

1530
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:42,700
Because, you know, Universe and the Xbox DERs have felt really new to me, and hell, I still think, what is it, UltraMix 2 is like the best DDR game they've put out in any country on a console.

1531
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:45,700
I got tired of playing DDR at home.

1532
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:48,700
Yeah, it's not the same. I'll give you that.

1533
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:51,700
All right, well, DS68, thanks so much for the call, we appreciate it, okay?

1534
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:53,700
All right, later buddy.

1535
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:56,700
All right, that's actually going to do it tonight for the Skype line.

1536
01:19:56,700 --> 01:20:03,700
We're actually running way over tonight, thanks to all the craziness, so we're actually going to wrap things up with some last minute stories.

1537
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:05,700
Does anybody have some quick last minute stories?

1538
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,700
I have some things I forgot to mention during the release dates.

1539
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:13,700
There's a game that apparently was coming out on PC called 30,000 Games.

1540
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:17,700
I don't know what it is, but I know there's 30,000 of them.

1541
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:21,700
And I say, for $19.99, that's a pretty damn good deal.

1542
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:27,700
Anyways, sorry, I wasn't ready for that yet. My bad.

1543
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:29,700
Okey-dokey.

1544
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:32,700
I've been having all sorts of sound boo-boos tonight.

1545
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:39,700
Anyways, one thing I was going to mention, South Park did win the Emmy for World of Warcraft episodes.

1546
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:42,700
This is actually Loki's new theme music.

1547
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:49,700
Okay, I have news.

1548
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:54,700
That, by the way, was Super Mario RPG in Mario Paint. That's what that was.

1549
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:58,700
Sega's game, The Club, will not be out for Christmas, by the way.

1550
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:03,700
It's going to be out early 2008 for PC, PS3, and Xbox 360.

1551
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:07,700
This is perfect for what we've been talking about.

1552
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:20,700
Anyways, apparently you can buy unicorns in Second Life. There's just one small little issue that they forgot to mention.

1553
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:28,700
In order to obtain a unicorn, you have to have sex with an adult unicorn in Second Life.

1554
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:36,700
What is that from?

1555
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:39,700
It's Super Mario RPG.

1556
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:43,700
Yeah, Rama sent me all these YouTubage things.

1557
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:49,700
The username is TomBobBlender has made all these YouTubes of all these songs in Mario Paint.

1558
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:51,700
It's good times.

1559
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:53,700
I remember the little kitty and doggy noises. That's great.

1560
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:56,700
Anyways, what it says basically, it says,

1561
01:21:56,700 --> 01:22:02,700
Someone on Second Life is offering tiny, adorable baby unicorns that you can hold and cuddle, but they come with a price.

1562
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:09,700
You can only get them by having sex with an adult unicorn located at the Belle Highland Sim.

1563
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:12,700
Deal or no deal.

1564
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:14,700
How can a unicorn get a baby?

1565
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:17,700
Apparently there's a website here that has not...

1566
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:20,700
Oh, yeah, that's interesting.

1567
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:23,700
Oh, God.

1568
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:27,700
That is special.

1569
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:30,700
Where's the baby unicorn?

1570
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:34,700
Does it really matter?

1571
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:38,700
I don't know. There's some weird shit on this website.

1572
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:42,700
I don't even know what that is, but it's some sort of insect having sex with somebody.

1573
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:45,700
God, Second Life is awesome.

1574
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:47,700
And by awesome you mean scary.

1575
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:50,700
Yes. Anything else for last minute stories tonight?

1576
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:53,700
Sell everything and get a Wii.

1577
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:56,700
Try First Life. It's great.

1578
01:22:56,700 --> 01:23:00,700
Okay, you done?

1579
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:06,700
There's some cool Office Depot, I guess, bundle for the Xbox 360 for $2.99.

1580
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:09,700
You get the premium system, so that might be worth it.

1581
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:12,700
I don't know.

1582
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:15,700
That's it.

1583
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:18,700
Well, that is going to do it tonight for Orange Launch Radio, you guys.

1584
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:21,700
I want to thank everybody for tuning into and listening to Orange Launch Radio tonight

1585
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,700
and supporting independent radio.

1586
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:25,700
We really appreciate it, you guys. You guys are awesome.

1587
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:29,700
And by the way, I want my voice back for next week.

1588
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:35,700
One, I also want to say a big thank you to all those of you guys who have left five-star reviews on iTunes recently

1589
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:38,700
on our podcast page on iTunes, because that's pretty awesome.

1590
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:41,700
There's been some pretty great reviews written.

1591
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:46,700
Of course, people like to use the little in-jokes from the show in their reviews, and we certainly appreciate that.

1592
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:48,700
But then sometimes people just write things that are generally pretty cool,

1593
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:52,700
and I want to give a moment to actually read one of these on the air, one of the more recent ones.

1594
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:58,700
And then hopefully that will encourage folks to maybe leave more, because we love five-star reviews and it inflates our egos.

1595
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,700
This Robert H.M. guy wrote,

1596
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:05,700
Named for popular Bamani artist Orange Lounge, this show, situated in San Francisco,

1597
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:11,700
does an outstanding job of being an intelligent, intricate look into what is reasonably current in video games.

1598
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:13,700
As one of the foremost independent video game podcasts,

1599
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:17,700
OLR, hosted by Sky Dark Soccer and Loki, continues to entertain with its rants,

1600
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:21,700
the always low-key but questionable input by frequent guest Shane,

1601
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:26,700
and more importantly, its attention to audience through the live chat during the show's Sunday night airing in the mailbag.

1602
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:29,700
The hosts are wonderfully funny without setting out to create comedy.

1603
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:33,700
Sometimes it just works best when the show breaks down in laughter.

1604
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:35,700
Hope you like tonight's show.

1605
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:41,700
Due to some bizarrely inappropriate comment, usually from Shane.

1606
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:42,700
Go figure.

1607
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,700
Highly recommended to video game fans of all ages.

1608
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:47,700
Okay, make that relatively mature audiences, but still.

1609
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:49,700
So thank you, Robert H.M., for that review.

1610
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:53,700
And all the people who've left happy, fun reviews on iTunes.

1611
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:55,700
Like MacMan, I see here.

1612
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:57,700
Mayo Nation, even though I hate mayonnaise.

1613
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:00,700
AJ Twist, Flaming, sure, your name got cut off.

1614
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:01,700
Read some of the bad reviews.

1615
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:02,700
And Blue Collar Murder.

1616
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:04,700
You want to hear a bad review?

1617
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,700
No, because that will encourage people to write bad reviews.

1618
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:08,700
I don't want to write bad reviews.

1619
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:13,700
No, if you wrote a bad review, then you don't get any attention on our program, sorry.

1620
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:15,700
All right.

1621
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:16,700
That's that.

1622
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:18,700
So thank you guys very much for that.

1623
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:21,700
And let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1624
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:24,700
Eddie, thank you for being here tonight and sticking with us through the whole show.

1625
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:27,700
And staying away from Gattle Star Ballactica during the program.

1626
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:29,700
Do you have any final thoughts?

1627
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:31,700
Nice and fancy.

1628
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:32,700
Indeed.

1629
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:36,700
Dark Sakura, do you have any final thoughts tonight?

1630
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:38,700
I actually have one other.

1631
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:39,700
What?

1632
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:41,700
Meh.

1633
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:47,700
My final thought will be reject false icons and give me a dollar.

1634
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:52,700
Tonight's final thought was just stolen from all of Jamie's past stuff.

1635
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:53,700
Loki, your final thought.

1636
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:57,700
My final thought, and I forgot to mention this during FAQs of the week.

1637
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:02,700
Comcast for some reason, I don't know if you've noticed this, Rob, or if it's even an issue with your TV.

1638
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:06,700
For some reason now, all the HD channels I get are not widescreen.

1639
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:10,700
They're all boxed, like really small.

1640
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:11,700
Mine are fine.

1641
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:13,700
It's weird, because it just started doing that now.

1642
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:16,700
Sounds like the user.

1643
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:20,700
I say beat them up.

1644
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:22,700
I say I'm switching to something else.

1645
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:23,700
All right, there you go.

1646
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:27,700
That's what more people need to do, because Comcast has been pissing me off a lot lately too.

1647
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:29,700
Not because of that, but just their general service in general.

1648
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:31,700
All right.

1649
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:35,700
But we do love Comcast, because that is the internet that gets us out to you guys.

1650
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:37,700
So thanks for that, Comcast.

1651
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:39,700
All right, anyhow, that's it for this week's show.

1652
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:42,700
Thank you once again for downloading and supporting independent radio.

1653
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:44,700
We couldn't do it without you guys.

1654
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:45,700
Hey, why don't we do it all again next week?

1655
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:47,700
Sound good?

1656
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:49,700
Yeah.

1657
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:54,700
All right, until then, have a meh week, and we'll see you next time.

1658
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:59,700
