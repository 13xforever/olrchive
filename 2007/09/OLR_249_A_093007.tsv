13965	23819	Tonight, September 30th, 2007, Halo 3 breaks big records, Blue Dragon gets free download content, and could Katana someday do battle with Wonder Woman?
31656	34497	I think Katana fighting Wonder Woman would be kind of awesome, actually.
34757	35217	Oh yeah, hi!
35237	36158	We'll get to that later.
36178	39179	Hi, welcome everybody to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
39239	44401	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.
44481	45541	My name is Rob Roberts.
45641	48923	Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
49143	49803	I has a beer.
50083	51604	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
74116	74596	What's up?
74896	81219	Somebody's replaced the desk with a laundry basket, and that's not exactly an even trade, I think.
82420	87462	But it holds the laptop just high enough so that it's easy to work on.
88603	90243	We'll get you one of those little school desks.
90664	94946	It's not a desk, it's a laundry basket turned upside down to become a desk.
95186	97407	Yes, our studio's kind of...
98334	100316	Ghetto tonight because we moved the desk out of here.
100356	104800	My roommate took his old desk and moved it into his room because he wants the computer stuff in there.
105020	106241	Just put the candy bowl on the ground.
107603	109825	Well then take your beer and put it where the beer was.
110772	112273	My beer is better.
112453	119419	Put the candy bowl on top of the pedestal, which I think is a trash can, and put the beer in the middle of the bowl.
119459	121921	Therefore, you have chocolate and a holder for the beer.
122381	125944	I would like to remind you, you're not listening to the 1UP podcast.
125964	129267	You're not listening to Gaming Windows Magazine podcast.
129287	132449	You're not listening to some podcast with a budget, okay?
132509	134231	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
134871	139315	We like find change under the couch, and that's what we use to pay for this program, okay?
139415	139615	So...
140590	143011	There is some budgie going into the Halloween candy.
143491	144712	It's like five bucks right there.
144732	145873	Priorities, okay?
145933	146593	Priorities.
147013	148254	I want to know where the Tootsie Rolls are.
148434	149354	There are no Tootsie Rolls.
149374	150395	There are no Tootsie Rolls.
150455	151175	I do have brownies.
151635	152335	You want brownies?
153376	153676	Maybe.
153736	154597	There's no joke there.
154617	156477	I really do have little yummy brownies.
157258	159839	They are good, and they taste like coffee, too, like the Starbucks ones.
160179	168523	Anyway, though, I'm hoping that if we can get all the computer issues worked out, we can go out into El Garage, I mean the studio...
170168	170868	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
200256	201999	I haven't lived with my parents since I was 15.
202039	202099	Ow.
209696	210576	Mommy, wow.
239491	243893	Someone asked special brownies, and once again, there is no budget for special brownies.
243913	249456	No, like we could afford marijuana even if we wanted to eat it, which I'm not really into that, so sorry.
249476	251217	Why would you want to eat marijuana?
251417	252037	Sorry to disappoint.
252057	253338	Well, apparently it gets you high.
253778	255379	Yeah, but it tastes like ass, so.
256039	258520	I can't stand the smell of marijuana.
258540	259941	Remember, kids, don't do drugs.
260941	263723	Don't we do video games once in a while here on this show?
263783	268825	DarkSakura, please save us from turning into the hashcast and tell us about your gaming week.
269827	271268	I play a lot of Ragnarok online.
272108	272488	A lot.
272769	275710	Dude, I played this game called Ragnarok.
276270	277811	It was so cool.
277831	278551	Okay, Rob, shut up.
278671	278952	Okay.
279412	281713	I'm a level 91 assassin now.
283594	285175	Been beating the shit out of ogres.
286155	292078	And I've also got... People are going to yell at me because you're not supposed to do what I'm working on.
292899	299262	Well, I was going to make an agility Spear Knight, and now I'm making an agility one-handed sword crusader.
301053	303414	So, um, but I am going to do a Spear Knight next.
304394	305774	Because Spear Knights are cool.
305814	307595	They have long pulls and poke things with them.
309135	309475	Wow.
309995	312836	Sounds kind of... I've not played any World of Warcraft.
313136	315497	In fact, I'm going to stop paying for it while my computer's down.
316217	318577	And I actually did not play any Pinball this week.
319257	323499	But, excuse me, Halo 3 in my house.
324439	329180	We had a bunch of people in our house doing multiplayer Halo campaigns.
331324	333225	Dan decided to get all of his buddies.
334285	341127	We had Will in one of the rooms and then our friend Alex, who's a crazy psycho ex-Marine.
342667	343687	Was that a LAN party?
344187	345488	A local area nerd party?
345688	347028	Yeah.
347368	348869	But they unbeaten on Legendary.
350869	354550	According to Dan, the way to beat Halo 3 on Legendary is to be an uber-sniper.
358026	361087	I've compared Legendary to Nightmare on Doom.
376163	378644	I seriously, like, I play the game on normal.
379064	382645	Okay, I would play on easy, but you don't get achievements on easy, so I'd play on normal.
382945	384826	I seriously died ten times in the first level.
384946	390348	I suck at Halo so bad, there should be, like, a charity for me or something.
390748	391168	It's sad.
391388	393309	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
396230	396670	No, I didn't.
396690	397050	Never mind.
397510	397610	Okay.
397630	398250	That wasn't this week.
398610	398991	Okay.
399011	400091	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
400111	400891	Oh, yes, I did.
400911	402172	It's a Flash game.
402212	403152	I found a Flash game.
403232	403532	What's that?
404577	405217	Dungeon Escape
431412	460665	and um it can be found and I'm trying to get the address for people it's at okay studiohunty h-u-n-t-y dot com slash dungeon and I'm going to link it in the chat room it's hilarious it's not just hilarious it's hilarious hilarious yeah I'm going to link it in the chat room alright well while that's being linked if there's nothing else for your gaming week we'll move on over to Loki how was your gaming week?
461440	462561	My gaming week was fine.
463921	464221	Let's see.
465322	469644	I started off playing Halo 3 on Legendary.
470084	473646	Single player because no one wants to fucking join my games, so fuck you all.
473726	475606	I'll beat it myself, and I'm better than you.
475947	479088	I'll play with you, but I'll probably hold you back.
479288	479988	So whatever.
480529	482129	I've been playing it by myself.
482409	484691	Wait, I want to know where all this sand in your vagina is coming from.
484731	486831	Are you sending out invites to people on your friends list?
486851	487772	I'm not sending out invites at all.
488399	492181	Well then, if you don't invite people, then how do you expect people to join your party?
492201	494702	I'm speaking like an internet celebrity or something that says people, you know.
494722	495863	Wake up, call!
496703	498464	No, really, I... You are not famous.
498644	500725	I have no patience to sit in the lobby for like... I am.
501045	503406	...a long time, so I'm just playing by myself.
503626	504547	That's because I have boobies.
505225	506987	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
520523	521463	Yes, I've seen him on Halo a couple times.
521503	523144	Well, he wasn't on there when I was on there.
523224	525545	Well, you should give him a call or something.
525585	526245	Say, hey, Bobby.
526365	532147	Oh, yeah, let me just... My phone that has everyone's phone number in it.
532207	533608	Oh, there it is, Bobby's number.
533768	538230	Oh, wait, no, I don't have Bobby's number because that's a mystical phone that doesn't exist.
538950	545833	Okay, now, really, yeah, I could send him a message saying, hey, you know, want to play some Halo 3?
546133	549374	But to be honest, I don't know when I'm going to be online to play Halo 3, you know.
550014	554435	I'm doing all sorts of busy stuff like, you know, going to see Eastern Promises and crap.
554635	556176	So, I don't know.
556676	568319	But, um, so, other than playing Halo 3, um, I've actually, well, of course, more Saints Row multiplayer and people are starting to get pissed off because, um, it's kind of unfair for them.
568359	577222	I've, like, been playing on other people's systems, you know, while they were gone or something and, yeah, my system is way better.
578082	578202	Like,
578715	579015	DarkSakura
602748	604630	It's so... It's such a you game.
605210	605491	It is.
605671	609335	It's really... I mean, it is not hard at all to play through the game at all.
611277	612058	And it's fun.
612158	613479	It's just stupid little things.
613579	614661	It's a great rental game.
617569	622233	I think it's also probably a good game to have friends over and just drink and play it and laugh.
623214	624094	On the PSP?
624234	625615	How do you play it with friends?
625655	627357	Well, not on the PSP, but it's also on PlayStation 2.
627917	631600	I don't have the PlayStation 2 version because my sister's still borrowing my PlayStation 2.
632201	633682	You need to call her up and say, Hey!
634382	634883	Bring it back!
635183	635883	I did say, Hey!
635984	636484	Bring it back!
636584	638826	But she hasn't brought it back yet.
639226	640047	You send out the troops.
641628	645611	And then, let's see... Other than that, I tried Driver 76 for the PSP.
647861	648401	That sucked.
648862	650863	Much like every other driver game known to man.
651443	653664	I'm not going to try the driver series anymore.
653824	655165	I'm going to stay away from it.
656205	659487	And I think that's pretty much it.
660268	665470	Oh, I've updated my firmware on my PSP Slim to 3.71 CFW or whatever the new...
668891	669211	A cookie theme?
669231	669732	A cookie theme.
669752	669952	Like?
689386	692390	Like peanut butter cookies and chocolate chip cookies.
692630	693611	Or Cookie Monster.
693671	694993	It's chocolate chip cookies.
695573	696895	And we'll show you.
697495	698236	It's hilarious.
699478	701881	Sony would like to remind you not to eat your PSP.
702597	704759	No, but it seriously is the cookie theme.
705579	706920	What about the OLR theme?
707141	707741	What happened to that?
708001	709442	I haven't made that yet.
709963	711063	I will get into that later.
711083	716027	I was going to say, I just had to pay to renew OLRPSP.com, our PSP site, this week.
716828	719250	Oh, it does look like someone ate your PSP.
719910	720451	Oh, I see.
721071	723093	It changes all the icons into cookies as well.
723293	724934	Hold on, I'll put that on the Op11 cam in a minute.
725816	725996	Get it?
726036	726656	It changed all that.
727536	728717	Don't eat the PSP, Jamie.
728757	729357	It's not healthy.
729457	738960	But no, there's actually one thing that I don't think is in the show roll tonight, but the Japan PlayStation site released the official tool to make themes.
739640	743321	So yes, we can make an OLR theme for the PSP.
744601	745641	And it's pretty sweet.
746281	747822	But there's some other ones on there.
747842	751823	They have like Wipeout and some pretty pink one that
752711	753791	Shadow Slayer says, Loki's PSP is delish.
772323	775745	DarkTexTV says, this is a PSP made of chocolate chips and cookie dough.
776126	778247	Could you imagine if the PSP could just make cookies?
778607	779328	It would be awesome.
779768	782490	It would be totally worth the price.
783510	788293	I've been growing fonder and fonder of the PSP this year and last year.
788434	789874	More so than when the thing first came out.
790115	791495	I've been more fond of the PSP this year.
792716	794257	It would be even awesomer if it made cookies.
794277	797439	I think more people would buy those than DSs if that happened.
797459	798440	They need to have like...
799178	799518	I don't know.
799638	800459	I don't know.
823789	825050	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
852672	861037	I think most people that do probably went out and got the game unless you hate first-person shooters for some reason, in which case I find it hard to believe you got Xbox 360 in the first place.
861297	864800	To be honest, I was never a fan of Halo, and Halo 3 is pretty cool.
865460	866721	I think the matchmaking is pretty good.
866761	876467	I do admit I don't think the graphics are as great as other Xbox 360 games I've played, and certainly there's been news about that this week, which we'll get into a little later.
877067	877447	But you know what?
877487	878468	It's not all about graphics.
880209	881570	They are bright, though, and vibrant.
882202	886644	The only reason I've always loved Halo before was multiplayer, and multiplayer doesn't disappoint.
886664	892766	I mean, in regards, it is just Halo 2, but, you know, with more, and that's okay.
893186	898007	But if you're not a fan of Halo at all, I don't know if this is going to do it for you.
898248	901249	Because especially the single-player mode, man, it just throws you right in.
901329	902969	There's no backstory, no nothing.
903349	908711	I find it hard to follow because I'm not good at single-player, therefore I don't really play the campaign modes of the other games.
910472	910952	So anyway...
912065	912485	That's that.
914146	918127	Halo 3, and then World of Warcraft, I finally went back to after about a three-week vacation.
918688	924830	I decided to go back to World of Warcraft this week, and I'm trying to think how that's been going.
924970	932073	I just hit level 66, ran some instances with some friends over near Thralmar, I can't remember what that zone's called.
932633	935755	But yeah, back into World of Warcraft, which I missed a little bit.
936155	940997	And I'm glad I waited, because now I have a bunch of friends in the guild that are on the same level I am, so we're running instances together.
941037	941557	Good times.
942518	944360	Other than that, not a whole lot.
944520	946541	There was no new arcade release this week.
946581	947302	Did you notice that?
947942	948943	Am I the one that noticed that?
949023	954407	Like that they decided, you know, on Xbox Live Arcade that since Halo 3 came out, they didn't need an arcade release this week.
954968	957249	I mean, I guess they released like a Bomberman pack or something.
957269	957990	There was nothing new.
958010	960032	Am I the one that noticed that?
960392	961873	I was looking forward to something new on Wednesday.
961893	962634	Well, there wasn't anything new.
962654	963714	Because I want Puzzle Quest or something.
964495	969499	I think, well, just like, you know, you said, you know, you almost didn't notice that.
970103	972404	Well, I think probably a lot of people almost didn't notice.
973044	975604	Yeah, I think a lot of people probably didn't care because they were too busy.
975624	978845	They've been doing two a week, so that's pretty good.
979245	982546	Yeah, and our chatroom Henderson man says, I noticed I want Puzzle Quest.
982566	983667	Yeah, I kind of feel the same way.
983687	985487	There's all this cool stuff coming out that I want.
985707	989788	But Puzzle Quest isn't probably coming out until November because that's when the console versions are coming out.
989808	994630	But there's Rez and there's... Rez ain't coming out this year, okay?
994670	995690	I can tell you that much.
995810	996330	You're a jerk.
996866	1006131	Just other stuff would be cool Omega 5, maybe I don't think Rez is coming out this year How about Castle Crashers?
1006191	1007492	Where the fuck's Castle Crashers?
1007512	1008773	Wasn't that supposed to be out last year?
1009213	1024142	Yeah Let's see, going to the chat room Sometimes our chatters like to post about their gaming weeks And I think my favorite gaming week Goes to AJ Mix in our chat room Says, my gaming week Legend of the Mystical Ninja on Wii Virtual Console And Halo 3
1025199	1028824	And I think he wins because Legend of the Mystical Ninja is awesome.
1029225	1029866	It is a pretty awesome game.
1029886	1030607	It is an awesome game.
1031088	1034773	Have you gotten to the place where you can play Gradius in one of the arcades?
1035034	1036496	Like little shops and games?
1036536	1037177	It's pretty awesome.
1038058	1038559	Take a look at that.
1039921	1040401	Alright.
1042099	1045943	Anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping for tonight, of which, again, we don't have a whole lot.
1045963	1062358	There's not been a whole lot of news going on with our show recently, so of course we'll continue to plug the community, such as our LiveJournal community at Orange Lounge on LiveJournal, our username, our MySpace at MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, our Facebook, I think it's called the OL Army or the OLR listeners or something on Facebook, and...
1063740	1066668	If you listened to the show a couple weeks ago, I don't really use Facebook that religiously.
1067229	1070337	And, of course, our website, www.orangeonstrade.com.
1070377	1071280	Next week is episode 250.
1073252	1101680	and although we're not planning a whole lot of big stuff for it because we already had our 5th anniversary show this year so we already kind of did fun stuff for that we're hoping to actually switch our location a little bit which for those of you that listen to us live and watch on the webcam might get a kick out of that and we're hoping to also bring some more interviews and just do some reshuffling of the shows if you have ideas, go post in our forums what kinds of things you'd like to see on Orange Launch Radio as we go into our next 50 episodes and 100 more after that and who knows how much longer we can get this show going
1102705	1104726	Anyway, let's get into some gaming news.
1105086	1106706	We'll start off with Loki tonight, some gaming news.
1134076	1134376	I don't know.
1134957	1136157	I mean, I'm not surprised.
1136457	1142801	We knew it was going to sell like crazy, and yeah, it's going to continue to sell like crazy.
1143041	1150105	Weren't they touting on Xbox.com or somewhere that it's like, biggest entertainment day ever?
1150185	1162832	Well, they're saying that their sales, you know, top that of like, I don't know, Spider-Man 3 or something like that, the box office gross, to which I say, Spider-Man 3 wasn't that great of a movie.
1164251	1169676	Also, it costs $9.50, maybe $10.50 depending on where you live to go to the movies to see Spider-Man 3.
1170356	1172438	And if you're cheap like me, you'll go to a matinee for $7.
1173559	1177342	But Halo 3, $60 plus tax for Halo 3.
1177622	1180264	So of course it made a shitload of money, right?
1180505	1180785	Oh yeah.
1181165	1182546	I mean, I don't know.
1183207	1184368	Is my math that screwed up?
1184813	1187476	I mean, we can do the math and figure out exactly how much it made.
1188296	1189097	I just don't care.
1189738	1193161	I mean, we all knew Halo 3 was going to make shitloads of money.
1193501	1195423	And that's really what the press release should have said.
1195503	1197285	Confirmed, Halo 3 makes shitload of money.
1197545	1198726	It made a lot of money.
1199027	1201629	And I mean, it's just going to help them out.
1201709	1203351	It'll sell consoles possibly.
1203851	1207735	I mean, although some people from other companies have come out and said, no, it's not.
1207875	1209817	People that already wanted, you know,
1210458	1211739	Halo 3, even Burger King is advertising it.
1211759	1213841	Money aside, I wonder why considering it's an M-rated game.
1234877	1239879	Good point, because usually Burger King advertises little child movies in Dora the Explorer, right?
1239939	1245860	I mean, I would say Burger King still advertises R-rated movies and that kind of stuff.
1246020	1246301	Do they?
1246521	1247141	I think so.
1247901	1249922	I mean, I don't know.
1250022	1251862	Can you get little toys with your mirrors there?
1252142	1253843	Well, you can get different things.
1254223	1256063	Actually, no, Jurassic Park was PG-13.
1258084	1258964	But here's the thing, though.
1259004	1260985	I mean, and it kind of goes back to the whole...
1262699	1263400	ESRB ratings.
1263480	1272224	There are no laws in place forbidding people from playing the game if they're under 18 or whatever.
1273144	1278087	It's really all just store policies and stuff like that.
1278167	1283109	Unless, of course, you're in specific states, which makes it a felony to sell a game to a minor.
1283730	1288592	But it's still not a law.
1289867	1294650	TigerClaw in our chatroom says, I wouldn't be surprised if the king suddenly ends up as an unlockable character in Halo 3.
1294690	1297531	That would be awesome because then he could shoot it over and over again.
1297851	1300453	That would be the best ever because he's really freaking disturbing.
1300573	1300973	I know.
1300993	1303094	Then I want Ronald McDonald in the Grimace.
1303574	1306076	I would rather not have him in there, to be honest.
1306236	1308637	No, it would be kind of jump in the shark.
1309417	1310298	Yeah, it would be.
1310618	1312599	They've already whored themselves out enough for Halo 3.
1312879	1313820	Maybe in Halo 4.
1314200	1315460	I mean, it was everywhere.
1315621	1318342	We don't need it to be quite that everywhere.
1319768	1325354	Brad from PodCulture is in our chatroom and says, The guy ahead of me in line for Halo 3 dropped $800.
1325674	1332881	He bought the Legendary Edition, the Halo version of the 360 console, the two Halo controllers, and some other crap.
1332901	1333882	$800 on Halo.
1334343	1335544	And he's a consumer whore.
1336025	1336445	And how.
1337526	1337886	Damn it.
1337966	1338467	Beat you to it.
1339139	1342841	Well, I see, oh my god.
1342861	1346422	360 Halo 3 system, that thing is not selling as well as I think they thought it would.
1346802	1347863	I think it's butt ugly.
1348163	1348783	It's stupid.
1348823	1351024	I mean, it's a paint job for 50 extra bucks.
1351064	1356666	I think because most people already bought the 360 that were anticipating Halo before they announced this.
1356906	1364629	It's a system that doesn't include Halo 3 that's for 50 extra dollars that's a weird color.
1366110	1368751	I mean, that's kind of stupid.
1369867	1371347	At least you could do a throw in the game.
1371387	1372268	I mean, come on.
1372468	1375348	Did anyone go out to the midnight sales or hear about them at all?
1375748	1375968	No.
1376368	1380889	Although, and I... God damn, I meant to get... My husband was out one because he sold.
1381549	1382010	And what did he say?
1382030	1382710	Did he say anything about it?
1383030	1383970	He said they were butt ugly.
1384890	1385290	The people?
1385770	1385910	No.
1386410	1387271	Oh.
1388311	1393592	I was going to say, actually, our manager in Dallas, Texas, he dresses up like
1394515	1394996	A Spartan.
1395196	1396757	He has an actual Spartan costume.
1396917	1397678	It looks cool, too.
1399459	1404382	He went out to some Dallas launches and stuff and walked around and did fun stuff like that.
1404543	1407184	But I don't get it.
1408886	1410687	I mean, it's cool.
1411007	1412368	I just don't want to do every single midnight.
1412508	1415971	It's like you've seen a midnight launch, then you've seen them all.
1416271	1418833	I mean, it's just someone else cosplaying as something else.
1419744	1423145	and long-ass line and people waiting and excited about something.
1423285	1424605	I mean, really, that's kind of what it is.
1424986	1428907	It's interesting because Halo 3 is pretty awesome, but it's not going to be the game of the year for me.
1429387	1431747	And I think for a lot of people, it's not... I don't think it's going to be the game of the year.
1431767	1434428	A lot of people were going to... Oh, it's going to be worth the wait.
1434488	1435729	I mean, it's good.
1436109	1437429	In fact, it's better than good.
1437469	1437889	It's great.
1437989	1440070	But I don't think it's going to be game of the year for me.
1440110	1443591	I can already think of at least one game that's very similar to Halo that's better.
1444371	1445712	It didn't even have multiplayer mode.
1446352	1447132	Well, I mean...
1448024	1454488	I don't think a game really needs to have the best graphics or have the best whatever.
1454728	1457229	It's all about the best gameplay.
1457249	1459050	It has great gameplay.
1459150	1466574	Halo 2, before Halo 3 came out, was still on the top 10 most played game on live.
1467555	1472938	Now Halo 3 will just take that spot and people will still buy it.
1474519	1476480	What makes a good game, though, is...
1477264	1483611	The fact that even throughout time, as new games come out, people are still interested in that game.
1484292	1495104	It's just like when Saints Row 2 comes out or whatever, people are going to be still playing Crackdown or the original Saints Row, or Grand Theft Auto 4.
1495144	1497807	When that comes out, everyone's going to forget about a lot of other games as well.
1500170	1505952	I don't know if it's just me or the people on my friends list, but I notice a lot of my friends lists don't play.
1506772	1508153	They're very much in the now.
1508313	1513275	I only ever see people playing the current games or the games that have come out within the past month.
1513475	1514815	Obviously this week it's been Halo 3.
1515015	1516536	I'm sure everybody's friends list was like that.
1516896	1518636	But before that it was all Bioshock.
1518676	1523078	And you don't see anybody playing Ridge Racer 6 anymore.
1523858	1524878	It's very interesting.
1525059	1526399	Not a lot of people playing the old stuff.
1528567	1528808	I don't know.
1529770	1530492	I thought it was interesting.
1531033	1538171	Anyway, I think this is kind of interesting too, is that there's some Halo 3 errors, some disc errors that are pissing people off.
1538908	1546273	The Legendary, I'm sorry, not The Legendary, but the limited edition versions of the games apparently have some scratched disc copies of Halo 3.
1546513	1551216	It's causing some disc read errors, even on some consoles, the Red's Ring of Death.
1551957	1553198	That's bullshit.
1553418	1556880	Yeah, I don't know about that, if one little disc skip can cause that.
1556960	1561023	But, you know, the things are all under warranty anyway, so it shouldn't be too big of a deal.
1561463	1567084	But certainly people that wanted to get their Halo on launch night are pretty pissed off that the limited edition copies are scratched.
1567524	1575126	Now naturally they have a replacement disc program in the works and all that stuff, but you can be sure that somebody's probably getting fired over this.
1575566	1581728	Well, all it was was the crappy packaging and caused the disc to fall off the hub because it was a piece of crap.
1582008	1587189	And I don't understand why, because in other countries they had a piece of foam and they're holding the disc in place.
1588145	1594070	There is a replacement program in place right now for both the Essentials disc and the normal game disc.
1594751	1608163	And also, on top of all that, the whole Red Ring of Death thing, could it possibly be, and this is kind of a stretch for me, could it be possibly that you're playing it for so many hours straight that the console is overheating because of that?
1608543	1609744	Because it's poorly ventilated.
1611109	1613091	I think that's what the Red Ring of Death would be caused by.
1613451	1616854	In fact, I mean, it's because of a chip overheating.
1616955	1622079	It's not because of a discrete error is not going to cause your chip all of a sudden to explode.
1622840	1626063	No, it's Bill Gates' fault, obviously.
1627865	1628225	Right?
1628585	1629146	Obviously.
1629386	1630687	Because he did it himself.
1630747	1631108	That's right.
1631128	1632769	Because he went out there with a knife.
1633090	1634371	He took a pin and scratched it.
1634930	1635810	An exacto knife.
1635910	1637411	I mean, scratch all those CDs.
1637531	1654574	To kind of draw a parallel here, I would say, for example, let's just say, this is about as ridiculous as saying, okay, if there was a certain car that had problems with their tires popping or something like that, and now there's a rumor going around saying that if you insert a certain CD into your CD player that your tire is going to explode.
1654654	1657075	I mean, that's about how ridiculous it is.
1657135	1658275	Interesting comments from chat.
1658855	1661095	Weedoo says, not so in New Zealand, Loki.
1661496	1663776	My store's limited editions were all scratched.
1664738	1667819	Piccaruno says all Japanese editions had foam inserts.
1669739	1670239	That's a good idea.
1670279	1671780	Because they package games better there.
1671920	1673780	Yeah, they do package the games a little better there.
1673820	1680381	They should also, you know what they should do is they should have like, you know, cases that have rose petals and daisies inside them.
1680401	1687523	Well, it was stupid that they had like these just little hubs on there that weren't, you know, the kind of locking ones that they'd have in normal DVD cases.
1687643	1690283	So yeah, somewhat did fuck up and it's stupid.
1690964	1692664	Luckily mine was not scratched, so.
1694560	1694920	All right.
1695380	1699423	Well, good for you, Loki, not having a scratched Halo 3 game.
1699483	1700703	Ours wasn't scratched either.
1701984	1702904	I bought the regular one.
1703064	1706186	I walked in the day after the midnight sale.
1706226	1707347	I walked in that next day.
1707527	1708727	I walked right into Fry's.
1708747	1714410	They had a humongous Halo 3 setup with just DVDs coming out Master Chief's ass.
1714570	1715751	I mean, there were so many games.
1715811	1716912	I was just like, oh, pick one up.
1717232	1717592	That was it.
1717672	1719533	Well, speaking of Master Chief's ass...
1720506	1725528	You should check out this charity Halo 3 action figure of the Master Chief.
1726368	1730009	It's very chickly.
1730309	1734391	It's an 11.5 inch figure right now going for $241.
1734511	1739953	It only has three bids on it at the time of this article.
1741233	1744935	But they are donating 10% of the profits to the American Breast Cancer Foundation.
1747135	1748836	Master Chief is a very hot chick.
1750780	1754102	Mistress Chief or, you know, Ms.
1754202	1755162	Chief if you're nasty.
1755983	1756323	I don't know.
1756783	1759684	I don't know, it looks stupid to me.
1760505	1765927	It looks like someone took like a fucking figure for like Witchblade and stuck the Master Chief helmet on it.
1766427	1767688	I mean, that's seriously what it looks like.
1768568	1770449	Yeah, I'm not really interested in the figure either.
1770689	1778253	And as the comments to the story, you know, even kind of, they're like, okay, seriously though, there's like no body armor in like the midriff there.
1779272	1782414	I mean, you could just shoot her in the boobs and she'd keel over.
1782514	1784074	Does she have her ass cheeks?
1784695	1788237	Does it have the assless suit on it?
1789757	1790258	Hmm.
1790918	1791818	It looks kind of retarded.
1791838	1794220	The hell game have you people been playing?
1794280	1796521	Can't you set your character as a female in Halo 3?
1796621	1798522	Yeah, but she doesn't look like that.
1798582	1801303	Yeah, and it changes nothing in the main appearance.
1802024	1803364	Of course, it's body armor.
1803724	1805125	It's unisex body armor.
1805365	1805826	That's right.
1806366	1806686	Don't need it.
1807473	1809934	Hey, do we remember Tex in Red vs. Blue?
1809954	1812914	I don't really watch Red vs. Blue.
1812934	1813694	Red vs. Blue is great, Rob.
1813714	1816835	I don't watch it, because I don't get Halo jokes, because I'm not huge on Halo.
1816855	1817155	Rob, it's great.
1817235	1818695	Why don't you watch everything that's great?
1818935	1819555	I know.
1819675	1821216	Why can't I be like everybody else?
1821696	1822316	Seriously.
1823036	1823456	God.
1824076	1824456	Anyways.
1824616	1826537	Why can't I be a robot instead of an alien?
1827557	1828897	Hero's joke, by the way.
1828957	1830277	Hope you all saw it.
1831137	1831417	Anyways.
1831437	1832718	Someone save this show, please.
1832798	1834158	As good as the first episode.
1835100	1837361	Forza 2 and Marvel Ultimate Alliance
1856547	1860830	This is going to be for both the premium system and for the elite system.
1861311	1866174	And both of those systems will be still the same prices that they are now, just you get two free games.
1866494	1866795	Hooray.
1868716	1875561	Then, of course, the other new bit of info is that the core system is going to be discontinued.
1876162	1882346	And in its place is going to be the Xbox 360 Arcade SKU, which is going to have a 256 megabyte memory card, a
1886750	1912824	Disc with 5 Xbox Live Arcade games including Boom Boom Rocket, Pac-Man Uno, Feeding Frenzy and Luxor 2 and it's going to have an HDMI out on it as well with a wireless controller all for $279.99 which I think is good that they're getting rid of the core because I know a big complaint I always hear is why would you get the core system you can't save your game
1913723	1914383	and now you can't.
1914403	1918264	Because you buy the core and then you buy a hard drive but then you might as well just buy a premium.
1918284	1919284	But at least this way you don't have to.
1919304	1921325	Right out of the box you can save your game.
1921765	1925626	I just think that because when I got my Xbox 360 that's what I had to do.
1925666	1931867	I bought a core and then bought a hard drive because you couldn't get Xbox 360s like anywhere when they first came out.
1931907	1932387	Remember that?
1932887	1935488	They were like Wii's a couple years ago you couldn't get them anywhere.
1936568	1936868	Crazy.
1937128	1939589	And of course this is just a rumor right now.
1942667	1944668	Well, yeah, but you know what we say about Microsoft rumors.
1944688	1945308	They're always true.
1945568	1945728	Yeah.
1946748	1949709	No, I mean, pretty much all the time.
1949769	1951789	I mean, unless somebody completely pulls it out of their butt.
1952069	1952810	But usually, you know.
1952830	1956070	Usually there's any sense of legitimacy to it whatsoever.
1956150	1956390	It's true.
1956430	1965913	I'm going to go on a limb here and say back about a month ago when they showed that whole UK rumor, they actually had pictures to go along with it.
1966773	1971274	And I've seen pictures to go along with this stuff, so I'm going to take a wild guess and say that
1972261	1973043	Pac-Man Fever Halo Fever
1980990	1981490	Halo 3 Halo 3 Halo 3
2011275	2013056	and then here he is on the TV.
2013176	2014177	Hi, here I am.
2015537	2016438	Somebody got caught.
2017719	2022421	Also, if you wanted to also draw straws a little bit more, he probably wasn't over 18 either, or 17.
2022901	2023842	Well, no, not if he was nice.
2023862	2024402	Well, get this.
2025022	2025863	Oh, that's right.
2025963	2027744	He didn't even get carded for the damn game.
2028925	2033347	Well, no, because M is 17 or over, so he's probably okay.
2034099	2035640	I didn't say if he was a senior or what.
2035660	2036521	We'll assume he's a senior.
2036861	2037141	All right.
2037541	2045366	But he told the radio station KIRO that he was being feared that he would be put in detention or that other students would taunt him or whatever.
2045526	2050490	And he has no regrets about Halo Fever and says that meeting Bill Gates was the greatest moment of his life.
2051650	2058535	And I find that kind of shocking that the school did not bust him and that the parents called him sick for him with this whole Halo thing.
2058775	2060156	I mean, wasn't it?
2060691	2061212	You know what?
2061572	2062113	You know what?
2083660	2087722	Hey, your BFF Bobby Blackwolf is in chat, Loki.
2089183	2092065	I believe Bobby was there from what I was reading in his LJ.
2092085	2093666	I don't know if I have it all together.
2093726	2096827	But Blackwolf says he was not the first person in line.
2096867	2098949	He was the first person who was of age.
2099309	2101810	There were two people in front of him that were underage.
2102050	2104052	They were skipped.
2105372	2106413	So then he was of age.
2108379	2109540	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2135312	2139236	I could tell you right now I'll probably be skipping work when Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out.
2139837	2140597	Naughty Naughty!
2141658	2142099	Whatever.
2143240	2156953	Jamie, surely there must be a disciplinarian inside of you that thinks there's something wrong with this picture that he's not getting in trouble or his parents are not being mocked openly for basically lying for him for this Halo 3 thing.
2157053	2159075	I don't think that there was a necessity to lie.
2159813	2161235	So he stayed up past his bedtime.
2176733	2177453	God damn.
2177613	2178654	No dessert for a week.
2194139	2196521	and then I had to go in to like band the next morning.
2196581	2197682	I was so tired.
2198422	2202806	I did take a week off of school to play Final Fantasy 3.
2202886	2206529	Was my mom going to call the school and say I was sick because I was playing video games too late?
2206569	2208150	She'd say, hell no.
2208290	2208971	You did this.
2209151	2211252	You still got to go to school and you just suffer.
2212313	2212553	Anyway.
2213954	2214415	Moving on.
2214575	2215596	Too much time on this story.
2215796	2216456	New story please.
2218798	2218978	Yep.
2220079	2220499	Alright.
2220940	2221220	Well.
2221240	2221320	Well.
2222188	2249740	For anyone who was curious as to the details behind Bizarre and Activision, basically, it was actually quoted by their commercial director saying that they were trying to find a long-term partner association that they wanted to work on just making good games and not have to deal with the development side of everything.
2249780	2250981	So that's why they brought them in.
2252312	2253673	They made Hot Sweet Love.
2254274	2256616	Yes, they did, and hopefully we'll get a nice baby out of it.
2258578	2263742	Activision's been buying people up lately, because they took over Guitar Hero, too.
2264963	2265304	Remember?
2265464	2266164	Yeah.
2266585	2267486	Activision's got money.
2267866	2269307	They bought Red Octane.
2269708	2270488	Hurrah.
2270609	2271709	Well, sorta.
2271850	2273491	Yeah, no, they bought them.
2273511	2274072	They acquired them.
2274812	2278776	Well, right now, though, as far as any upcoming releases, the only thing...
2279332	2280372	Project Gotham Racing 4
2301912	2307376	Well, it will be probably put out by Activision or... Does that mean it's going to be multi-console?
2307937	2309258	PlayStation 3, Project Gotham 5?
2310038	2310639	How can this be?
2311940	2312240	I don't know.
2313241	2313641	We'll see.
2313821	2317344	Or Project Gotham 5 will be developed by another studio.
2318825	2324529	You know, much like Guitar Hero now is being developed by someone else as well.
2324950	2325170	Anyways...
2326242	2338706	Um, so, something kinda cool, um, Tetris Splash is coming to Xbox Live Arcade, and, um, apparently, uh, it's gonna be Tetris all over again.
2339326	2351450	Hurrah, because if you didn't get your fill, was it Tetris, um, not Grandmaster, I don't know, the last Tetris game that came out, Evolution, whatever the fuck it was called, uh, well, you'll be able to play on live.
2353048	2365005	4 players offline, 6 players over live, and lots of blocks in multi-colors and apparently a very creepy woman announcer
2366161	2367742	Hooray for creepy women announcers.
2367883	2375289	Boo for the fact I already bought Tetris on the Xbox 360 and probably paid way more for it than I should have, but I guess that's my own damn fault.
2375749	2378952	What was that Tetris game called that was the disc version?
2379493	2380434	I don't know.
2380614	2381514	Obviously it wasn't memorable.
2381534	2384757	Yet another Tetris game now on 360, is that what it's called now?
2384897	2385298	I guess.
2385658	2389962	I mean... Tetris and Pac-Man, seriously, stop...
2390689	2391650	Making new games.
2392230	2394371	Or just re-releasing your old games, I guess.
2394391	2398313	So, like I said, they're moving it to another developer, much like Guitar Hero 3 moved to a different developer.
2419656	2421419	I said I got owned, not you got owned.
2422180	2422541	Yeah.
2423643	2424084	Yes, you did.
2424420	2427042	Project Gotham Racing Project Gotham Racing Project Gotham Racing
2450803	2462488	I love the game because I played the original flat out over and over and over again, playing the ragdoll mode in it where you can just launch the driver through the windshield and do the high jump and stuff.
2463618	2469543	I don't know, I just, I like breaking stuff and launching drivers through Windows and watching them get hurt.
2469883	2472084	Why, same reason I'm playing Jackass.
2472145	2473506	Yeah, I noticed this theme here.
2473526	2476788	You enjoy Jackass the game, you enjoy launching people through Windows.
2477108	2482492	I seem to remember there's that PlayStation Network game that's like a crazy guy that, you know, does, what was that called?
2482753	2483713	Best Pain or whatever?
2483833	2484074	Yeah.
2484094	2485174	That you were all giddy about.
2485194	2486235	See, you chuckle.
2486616	2489798	You chuckle like a little kid who's setting fire to things in the back of the class.
2490338	2491519	If only they had that game.
2494634	2501136	Back to the Classroom Pyro, the game coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
2501596	2505578	One game I enjoyed quite a bit more than the average person, and I'm not sure why.
2505658	2507699	Maybe just because I like Japanese role-playing games.
2508159	2514741	Or maybe I have such a boner for Chrono Trigger that I was able to look past the fact that the game wasn't the greatest RPG of all time.
2514781	2516262	But it wasn't bad either.
2516722	2517342	Blue Dragon.
2518297	2523220	and one thing that, you know, I was, one of the negatives I was seeing about Blue Dragon is that it's kind of easy.
2523620	2531043	I mean, if you just take the time to level up in the very beginning of the game, you're always two steps ahead of the enemies and only the boss fights really prove to be difficult.
2531084	2531744	Well, guess what?
2532944	2536346	Blue Dragon has come out and said, you don't think the game is hard enough?
2536606	2541289	Here's some free download content that will up the difficulty of the game.
2541569	2542929	You don't think the hard is game enough?
2543370	2543870	Don't worry.
2545077	2545337	What?
2545777	2546498	We got covered you.
2546518	2548579	You were about to say that.
2550299	2555021	I was just showing my translation skills from the Japanese text, original.
2556582	2559983	The Ultra Hard mod gives three new aspects to the game.
2560403	2564705	New Game Plus, or Game Plus, which is like, gee, they had this in Chrono Trigger.
2565165	2568747	You just start the game over again with all the stats that you had when you last ended.
2569047	2571088	But there's also now Hard Mode, which is...
2571508	2572729	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2597059	2600502	Clip or movie or something for beating it on one of these ultra hard modes.
2600542	2605546	But nope, you just get the satisfaction of knowing you're better than everybody else at a game no one seems to care about.
2607087	2608228	So congratulations to you.
2608929	2611571	Don't play a hard game, play Earth Defense Force 2017.
2611911	2617736	I will say though, I'm thankful that Microsoft is putting out, or I guess I shouldn't say Microsoft because the devs charge us.
2617756	2618777	Microsoft is putting out.
2619137	2620858	Yeah, Microsoft is putting out quite well.
2621139	2625042	But no, the developers and Miss Walker and everybody is putting out the game
2625669	2627771	or the putting out the content for free.
2627831	2630033	Actually, I believe Microsoft did publish it themselves.
2630093	2631495	Mistwalker just developed it.
2631535	2634017	So they did decide to charge nothing for it.
2634337	2635478	So hooray for Microsoft.
2635538	2636439	Thank you for putting out.
2637240	2639642	Yes, we like it when they put out.
2639742	2644166	Speaking of putting out, for the most recent...
2645721	2649304	Offering from Capcom in the Super Street Fighter 2 series.
2650164	2655648	Turbo Remix for MatchingService.com 4chan edition.
2657369	2660451	They are having two characters confirmed.
2660791	2665674	It will be Cammy and M. Bison, who in the Japanese version is Vega.
2665694	2668977	I thought it was supposed to be all the same people.
2668997	2670918	They're just making them all pretty.
2672702	2674984	They do look very high-def-y.
2675364	2676365	There's some pictures on here.
2677125	2678607	Not me with her humongous thighs.
2679207	2684651	Well, people are saying her humongous camel toe, but... Well, that's always been Cammy.
2686433	2687453	Go Cammy!
2690456	2691576	Is that where she got her name from?
2693058	2693378	I don't know.
2694758	2706444	But if you can't wait for Super Street Fighter 2 HD Remix, you can possibly find some other fun games at your local stores this week.
2706944	2712887	Including, if you happen to be a fan of basketball games, well, there's going to be plenty of them.
2713427	2722411	With both NBA Live 08, NBA 2K8, and NBA 08 coming out this week on the 2nd of October.
2723041	2738314	and, of course, Live and 2K will both be on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, the 360, and then, of course, Live being on the Wii, making its first basketball game appearance, and, of course, on the PSP as well.
2738954	2740315	And then, let's see here.
2741196	2749723	If you're not a fan of basketball games, then maybe you're a fan of some of the other games from NVIDIA, including Crash of the Titans and...
2751100	2767502	Spiro, or Legend of Spiro, The Eternal Night and those are supposed to be coming out on PlayStation 2 for both and then of course on Crash PlayStation or Xbox 360 and the Wii DS and Game Boy Advance
2768564	2774846	Then on PSP, a kind of crappy rip-off of WarioWare.
2774926	2779027	HotPixel is coming to that system on the 2nd.
2779567	2788649	What's funny, though, is when they released it over here, they decided to spell out Pixel, P-I-X-E-L, instead of just the P-X-L, as it was in other regions.
2791910	2794811	Also, most systems, Spider-Man Friend or Foe,
2795589	2796770	MLB Power Pros DS Jackass The Game
2819521	2822022	and, uh, on PSP, Syphon Filter.
2822042	2824823	Do I want to know how you use the touch screen and jackass the game?
2824843	2825923	Because that sounds kind of scary.
2826203	2827904	I don't know, but it'll be interesting.
2827924	2830084	Uh, then some smaller games here.
2830524	2834585	Um, okay, well, maybe not a smaller game, but Legend of Zelda, The Phantom Hourglass is coming out this week.
2835486	2839247	And it actually might already be out if, you know, you happen to be at the Nintendo World Store.
2840187	2845809	Um, other stuff coming out on the Wii this week, uh, Dave Mirra's BMX Challenge, which is crap.
2846649	2846769	Um,
2847967	2870889	and then of course the DS also has Race Driver, Create and Race, Kurupoto, Cool Cool Stars, Crayola Treasure Adventures, Arctic Tail, all which sound kind of crappy, and let's see here, Backyard Football, 08, Master Jinjin's IQ Challenge, Paws and Claws, Dogs and Cats,
2872062	2883806	And then on the PC, of course, all sorts of random stuff, including a brand new Tycoon game Because what would it be without a new Tycoon game almost every single week?
2884567	2893890	Rock Tour Tycoon Man, they're really drawing in straws now Scraping the bottom of the barrel Sounds like fun
2895130	2898672	Oh, and flat-out Ultimate Carnage on Xbox 360, as I mentioned earlier.
2899132	2903234	Nintendo Maniac64 says, I want to see Jackass Wii, where you throw Wiimotes.
2904234	2906835	Like, maybe it just puts a big target on your TV and you're encouraged to destroy it.
2906855	2909256	They've got some weird little games in that.
2909376	2917440	One of them is the Elephant Poo Dive, where you're diving off of a skyscraper into a big bucket of elephant poo.
2917480	2918720	Oh, you know how to sell a game.
2918820	2921881	And then they've got another one where you're rolling down a...
2924102	2927744	Ski Slope, kind of like Katamari and you're rolling over things.
2928485	2929685	They've got a bunch of fun stuff in there.
2930326	2931847	Definitely worth a rental at least.
2932727	2933208	And it's cheap.
2937570	2941052	Well, moving on, going to the Japanese release date.
2941072	2949497	It's not a huge week in Japan, but if you've been sitting around Japan, you've been going, God damn, I want a new Dragon Ball Z fighting game.
2949537	2950298	I mean, there's just...
2951079	2953823	Not enough Dragon Ball Z fighting games out there on the market.
2953863	2961673	Well, shit, you're in luck this week because on the Nintendo Wii, Dragon Ball Z Sparkling Meteor is coming out on the Nintendo Wii.
2961974	2963676	I believe that's on the PlayStation 2 as well.
2964257	2965458	Sparkling Meteor.
2965518	2968262	Thank God that those don't come over at the same subtitles.
2969161	2969741	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2992421	2993281	Super Famicom
3015307	3017788	Guitar Hero over there, and I don't think they're getting Rock Band.
3018088	3020290	So this is what you get in Japan instead.
3020570	3022791	You get Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.
3023691	3027413	Of which I have not played V3 or V4 in the arcades at all.
3027453	3031035	I played V2, which was pretty much the same game.
3031335	3035518	If you will, imagine V2, but instead of a 2, there's a 4 there.
3036198	3037599	And you'll be pretty damn close.
3037699	3038259	Alright, alright.
3038759	3039180	Fair enough.
3039560	3039880	Smartass.
3040498	3041739	What if there's good songs, though?
3041779	3044602	I mean, you know, those games are only as good as the songs or whatever.
3045103	3045403	Forget it.
3045824	3046124	Yeah.
3046825	3053512	A chibi little baseball game on the PlayStation 2 called Jikuyu Powerful Pro Major League 2 is coming out.
3053992	3057997	It looks like if the cast of Worms starred in a baseball game, that's what you'd get.
3058157	3060059	That's MLB Power Pros over here.
3060820	3061140	Oh, really?
3061479	3062960	Koharu no DS Ushigohan Shokuji Balance Guide Suki
3078232	3080094	and this... What the hell do you do?
3080174	3083276	It looks like a game where you put in what you've been eating.
3083837	3085058	It shows you little pictures of food.
3085118	3085738	It's a nutritional guide.
3086038	3091803	Yeah, and it shows you how many grams of fat and how many K-cals you're eating and all that good stuff.
3092063	3093424	Another thing, real quick.
3094245	3097307	I think that's a smart idea to bring something like that out over here, actually.
3097787	3100670	There's enough people that own DSs that would be interested in that.
3100690	3104693	That Crimson and Black DS ain't only coming out in Japan.
3105313	3105754	Oh, really?
3105774	3106034	This week.
3106980	3108081	On the PSP, Gundam Battle Chronicle On the PSP
3133166	3137870	Mina no Golf Ba Volume 3, which I believe, isn't that just their hot shots over there?
3138670	3144875	And then Shin Sangoku Mosu, Dynasty Warriors, goes into the best hits on the PSP.
3145295	3148377	So if you're a fan of Dynasty Warriors, price cut, enjoy that.
3148497	3149638	That's your Japanese release dates.
3150339	3152841	Horribly butchered pronunciations, courtesy of me.
3153941	3154482	How about Europe?
3155543	3158705	Well, there is some, well, a little fun.
3159269	3162273	There's Hour of Victory on PC, NBA 08.
3162734	3166279	Hour of Victory comes out on the first, NBA 08 comes out on the second.
3167020	3168021	A bunch of stuff for the fifth.
3168041	3172488	There's Blitzkrieg 2 Liberation, Cookie and Cream on DS.
3173038	3191307	CSI 3, Dimensions of Murder and then CSI Hard Evidence on PC and Xbox 360 Dead and Furious on DS Deadhead Fred on PSP Final Fantasy Tactics, The War of Lions on PSP, Glory Days 2 Brotherhood of Men NFL 08 and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 Hooray
3196189	3196429	PS3, PS4, PS5, PS6
3207139	3208439	Which will also probably come true.
3209279	3216641	One of which is going to be that the FCC has filed a... Or had a filing for a brand new PlayStation 3 model.
3217601	3220462	And no word on what it is yet.
3220602	3226523	But most likely it's going to be that 40 gig system that just... That rumor won't die.
3226623	3228363	That one that's supposed to be coming out for $399 or $299.
3228803	3230364	Depending on who you're talking to.
3230384	3230444	Um...
3233897	3240041	And apparently, the specifications for it so far, it will have Wi-Fi, obviously it's going to have Bluetooth, etc.
3240362	3243243	And they're identical to the other PlayStation 3 models right now.
3243384	3249688	So, you know, it's not going to be like the 20-gig system where it doesn't have any, you know, Wi-Fi or stuff like that.
3249848	3253631	But, still though, it's coming.
3254751	3259294	Whether Sony, you know, admits to it or not, it will be coming soon.
3259555	3263137	I bet you that you're going to get an announcement probably any day.
3266624	3267367	Good times.
3271687	3284113	Coinciding with the same thing where they had one of those, it was the Blu-ray deals that they have going on right now for the PlayStation 3 where you buy the system and get five Blu-ray movies.
3284473	3288375	Well, that also had the same new SKU number on there as well.
3288775	3291356	So that at least confirms that there will be a new SKU.
3291757	3299140	Whether it be a 40-gig system or God knows what other size hard drive they're going to throw in with it, there is a new SKU coming.
3300161	3300281	Hmm.
3302153	3302493	All right.
3303534	3310321	Well, Kaz Hirai has commented recently on the PlayStation 3, saying, The PlayStation original price was just right.
3310381	3311001	Nah, nah, nah.
3311081	3316186	I have no regrets about releasing this for such a high cost, even if everybody seems to have a problem with it.
3316426	3319209	Well, then you have no regrets for nobody buying it.
3319269	3319910	Okay, hold on.
3319930	3321792	That's not exactly what he said.
3321952	3322873	Okay, here's a quote.
3323093	3325535	Quote, The PS3 has been on the market less than a year in the U.S.
3325575	3326056	and Japan.
3326096	3326536	And what is it?
3326596	3327437	Less than that in Europe?
3328692	3329933	I love that because he doesn't even know.
3330413	3332275	It's difficult right now to say who's where.
3332815	3339421	Clearly, we've never started from a position of strength, and we've always had to catch up with every generation of hardware that we've brought into the market.
3339781	3344384	You know, interesting point that I think back to the PlayStation 1, and that is kind of true, what he's saying.
3344685	3349929	But I seem to recall with the PlayStation 2, they were kind of the big deal right out the gate.
3350049	3351150	I don't think they ever really...
3351770	3361085	I mean, I don't know, maybe you'd know more about Dreamcast versus PlayStation 2, Jamie, but I seem to recall, you know, as much as we love Sega, I think Sony was always whooping their ass from the get-go, weren't they?
3361726	3362147	Sadly.
3362407	3363589	Yeah, so, you know...
3364736	3372879	But I mean, we also, over here, we had to deal with the problems of coming back from the Saturn versus the PlayStation, as you'll recall.
3373399	3378702	Over here, the Saturn didn't have the proper support to make it the big machine like it was in Japan.
3378942	3381663	In Japan, they had all of the 2D games.
3381883	3383544	All of the best stuff came out on Saturn.
3383564	3384284	You know, I don't know.
3384304	3385724	I think this is just excuses, though.
3385744	3392007	I mean, if you think about it, their whole thing is, well, we haven't been out as long as the 360, so that's why we haven't sold as many units.
3393449	3396712	No, you still have not figured out why you haven't sold that many units yet.
3396892	3399374	And that fact right there is scary as it is.
3399554	3406039	If you can't figure out why your system's not selling, I mean, dude, it's your fucking price.
3406299	3409282	I mean, that's why the Panasonic 3DO didn't take off, because it was $700.
3409642	3412965	Well, that's what Rob was asking.
3413205	3415547	Wait, quick, name one game on the 3DO.
3416067	3416327	Five.
3416467	3416767	Road Rash.
3416788	3417028	Four.
3418329	3420210	And it had You Don't Know Jack.
3420410	3421231	I remember playing that game.
3422253	3423014	Back to what Rob asked.
3423034	3425295	I bet most people wouldn't have passed that challenge.
3425415	3425636	Sorry.
3426456	3434841	I think that part of the reason why the Dreamcast didn't take off so well over here was just coming off of the American failure of the Saturn.
3435161	3439164	Because overseas, it was the shit.
3439284	3441105	That's why I imported all my games on Saturn.
3443307	3445408	And the Dreamcast, to me...
3446169	3447491	Saga's Place as far as systems go
3460103	3468412	and then they've just turned it right around because I honestly think that they're looking into the actual thing that gamers want instead of the thing they think gamers want.
3468612	3469613	You know what I mean?
3469633	3482547	If they want to catch up, they need to put out the $3.99 SKU and then they need to start putting out some better games because I think with that price point being in place, people will be more likely to buy the system, developers will be more likely to make games for it, etc.
3483010	3489136	It's interesting you bring that up, that whole Microsoft took Sega's place thing, because then you even put... I've thought the same thing, actually.
3489556	3496502	And it's kind of interesting, because you even throw that Peter Moore thing, because he was with the Dreamcast, and then he did the... He's not with Microsoft anymore, but he was definitely a big part of 360.
3496743	3500106	It makes it even more eerie, that whole comparison.
3501307	3501527	Anyway.
3502648	3504128	We can move on with the news now, sorry.
3504208	3505749	Just random sidebars.
3505909	3506529	Really, can I?
3506869	3507089	Yes.
3507289	3509970	Actually, maybe I should go to the chat and see what's going on in chat.
3511771	3512811	I'm sorry if I mispronounce this.
3512851	3513991	It's either Wet2 or We2.
3514011	3514431	I think it's We2.
3514471	3515812	There's no A in it, though.
3515832	3520093	It says, Dreamcast sold really well in New Zealand, but PlayStation 2 killed it.
3521753	3524154	Misty said, I never got PlayStation 2 until DDR.
3524494	3530696	And if I recall correctly, I got my PlayStation 2 at the same mall GameStop that I got my little DS Lite bundle at.
3531320	3534081	BlackWolf says, wasn't Tempest 2000 on the 3DO?
3534541	3535222	Jaguar.
3535482	3537462	That was the only game worth getting on the Jaguar.
3538223	3539563	There was another one on Jaguar.
3539583	3541124	Okay, one other Jaguar game.
3543265	3547486	But yeah, it was all about... And now you can get Tempest 2000 on damn near everything else.
3547826	3552108	MrDeBucket says, Peter Moore says, 9-9 of 99 is still the biggest day in media history.
3552168	3552688	Fuck Halo 3.
3554069	3557510	That's right, because the MTV Music Awards were on 9-9 of 99, weren't they?
3557770	3559251	I was sitting in line for my Dreamcast.
3560410	3560850	We can move on.
3560870	3561571	Please, let's move on.
3563152	3567415	That's what I was doing, except for when I ran over and bought a book and then came back and waited in line.
3567435	3571038	Wait, BlackWolf says 3DO, Jaguar, same thing.
3571938	3574100	Dude, compare the controllers sometime.
3574160	3577703	The Jaguar came with a dictionary for a controller.
3579048	3580690	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3602391	3604293	Now, the Steel Battalion Controller is freaking awesomeness.
3604313	3607035	It was one eject button short of a Steel Battalion Controller.
3607135	3607836	That's what it was.
3607936	3611159	Hey, I bought my husband a Steel Battalion Controller for his birthday.
3611239	3611479	All right.
3611920	3613941	Because I'm the best wife ever.
3613961	3615903	All right, chat room, please stop derailing the show.
3616183	3616704	Yes, please.
3616724	3617805	Jamie, let's move on with the news.
3618485	3619606	Okay.
3620307	3627273	There was a recent FCC filing for a 40 gigabyte PS3, and Sony isn't saying crap about it.
3627953	3628574	They are...
3629500	3631001	Really not saying crap about it.
3631161	3633102	I don't see any statements, no nothing.
3635344	3637825	Because they're like, oh shit, not again.
3638826	3644269	There is no 40 gig system, just like there was no PSP Slim, or no rumbling controllers.
3646771	3649493	Well, at any rate, it's there.
3649933	3651654	They're not saying anything, end of story.
3654376	3655677	Or no 80 gig system.
3655697	3656097	Hmm.
3656857	3657397	I've taken it.
3657817	3658918	Well, I already got mine.
3659318	3662940	Why does it seem like the hard drive is the only thing that freaking changes on that system?
3662980	3663580	Because you don't get it.
3663800	3666402	Well, people must not like it because it doesn't have a large enough hard drive.
3666422	3668683	Well, put something for me to put on the hard drive.
3668803	3669823	Bigger is better, Rob.
3670143	3670444	Oh, well.
3670464	3672865	Well, Rob, you know you can convert your videos over.
3673005	3675046	Oh, wait, but there isn't really an easy way to do that.
3675206	3676887	Oh, and they don't really tell you how to.
3676927	3678027	Next story, I'm angry.
3678347	3678868	Sorry.
3679868	3681149	I use it for putting videos on there.
3681249	3683950	I have a copy of Kung Pao on there.
3685191	3686411	Whoop-de-frickin-do.
3686472	3687632	Hey, Kung Kao's an awesome movie.
3687912	3688712	Don't talk bad about it.
3689473	3690933	Steve Odekirk needs to fucking make a sequel.
3691193	3691433	Anyways.
3692654	3695014	Somebody linked a picture of the Jaguar controller in chat.
3695375	3698776	How is that thing supposed to... That's like an original Xbox controller, okay?
3698796	3701397	Where you have to have, like, gorilla hands to be able to hold that thing.
3701417	3702317	Gorilla hands.
3703135	3712146	See, with it being that big, it makes one sort of wonder about the Saturn Dual Analog Controller, but that one is one of the single most comfortable controllers ever.
3712386	3714769	And they wonder why the Xbox didn't sell in Japan.
3715658	3720901	I mean, you need like three Japanese hands to hold the Xbox.
3720961	3725043	I will point out to you that when they released the Xbox in Japan, it did have a smaller controller.
3725443	3726984	Which they released here.
3727084	3730366	Which I made Dan buy me because, I'm sorry, look at these short fingers.
3730386	3731406	You do not have gorilla hands.
3731486	3732287	Look at my fingers.
3732527	3733988	You have petite little girly hands.
3735108	3742694	Alright, anyways, so it's been confirmed the price of Rock Band, and a date for Rock Band has been announced.
3742754	3747898	Rock Band will come out on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on Black Friday.
3748019	3756745	Thank you, EA, for $170, and of course that is the bundle, which is going to include both...
3757966	3762329	A guitar, a drum set, microphone, and the game.
3762409	3772556	Of course, the game by itself will also be available for $60 in case you just want to play the guitar version and own a guitar from Guitar Hero.
3773877	3778740	However, what is kind of new is they announced that there will be a PlayStation 2 version for the low, low price of $160.
3778780	3779060	You save $10 and...
3783143	3785084	That is coming out on December 10th.
3785584	3787585	Of course, we'll feature these same things as well.
3788465	3791306	What I find interesting is that they came out with a PlayStation 2 version.
3791906	3795167	Something tells me it's because they like money.
3795808	3797348	You got to play Rock Band last week.
3797428	3797928	Is it worth it?
3798629	3799429	For that price?
3799569	3800089	Yeah, I think so.
3800149	3800809	I was going to buy it for $200.
3802010	3802190	Good.
3802230	3805671	I'll come over and play yours because I don't feel like dropping that kind of money on a video game.
3806751	3808612	Well, hopefully you'll get a pretty decent discount.
3809099	3812410	I wish they would send me a copy for free I'll buy the game itself
3814507	3840915	for a game I'll play once and you know it I'm only going to play it like once probably because you know we don't have people over all the time I don't see my roommate being somebody where I'm going to be all like hey let's bust out Rock Band and get down it's a party game it's a total party game speaking of Guitar Hero 2 whatever fucking happened to their effector pedal or something that was going to be added later on I built one of those effector pedals and now it's for nothing
3841607	3842147	Haha.
3842407	3843068	Very disappointing.
3843248	3845289	Not that it cost me any money to do that, but, you know.
3845849	3846809	Still, very disappointing.
3847089	3847970	Because it works, too.
3847990	3850571	Except it doesn't do anything.
3851111	3851391	Anyways.
3852712	3854692	So, no, I think it's going to be worth it.
3854833	3860015	The big thing for me, I think, is going to be to see whether people are going to pay $170 for this game or not.
3860355	3860675	I will.
3862536	3863236	I don't know.
3863476	3865157	I mean, it's going to be big.
3865637	3867058	It's definitely going to sell very well.
3867078	3869098	It's just, are people going to pay $170 for a game?
3871109	3874691	and if so, then we're going to see a bunch more.
3874811	3878293	I think it is going to be a huge party game.
3878374	3891922	I totally see this as the kind of thing that people who have big families or people that host parties regularly or it's going to become like the we're going to have this at a fundraiser or have rock band there because Guitar Hero is already like that.
3892382	3897284	Like, you know, oh, we're going to have a fundraiser, you know, we're going to have a bake sale slash car wash.
3897384	3899304	Guitar Hero's going to be there, you know, like, I don't know.
3899324	3904806	Am I the only one that ever notices that Guitar Hero seems to turn up at these random charity events you see advertised?
3905026	3905947	That's going to be Rock Band.
3906547	3908988	Yeah, well, it's cool, I guess.
3909168	3911129	Yeah, I mean, I'm not knocking Rock Band.
3911409	3913349	It's just a lot of money to drop on a game.
3913489	3916550	It is, and I don't know.
3917911	3919892	Now you have me waving on it now.
3920592	3920832	Oops.
3922462	3924003	Sorry EA, sorry Harmonix.
3924964	3928065	Well then let's go to the next story before Loki changes his mind completely.
3928385	3932828	The PlayStation.com shopping service is closing in Japan.
3933328	3938311	That's right, in December it will be ending the site's e-commerce services.
3938551	3940932	And the service will be coming to a complete halt in February 2008.
3941933	3945755	Now while at first glance this might seem like doom and gloom for the PlayStation...
3946215	3951417	Not so, because PlayStation.com was for providing downloadable content for the PlayStation 2.
3952177	3956018	But as you guys all know, it's all about the PlayStation 3 now and the PlayStation Network.
3956218	3957899	PlayStation 2 had downloadable content?
3958039	3959199	I guess in Japan, yeah.
3959239	3961040	Because you get the PlayStation Points.
3962700	3967962	Well, anyway, if you still have PlayStation Points, you can transfer those over to your PlayStation 3 wallet.
3969602	3970883	They always get better stuff in Japan.
3970923	3972263	Hello?
3973104	3973604	Where have you been?
3974184	3974564	I don't know.
3977950	4000196	Well, for anyone who also has been keeping up with more of the downloadable content for PS3, especially for our European fans, well, I should say fans of the system, well, Sony is pulling their Gran Turismo HD concept from the Japanese store, and it's not probably coming out in Europe at all.
4001516	4005978	There's been no announcement, no nothing, they're just not getting it.
4006838	4007158	Sorry.
4007856	4016178	But now there's a Gran Turismo 5 prologue that will be coming out, but there's no date for it in the UK yet.
4017058	4028400	So that's kind of a bitch move, I think, that they're actually getting rid of the free version of Gran Turismo on there before the paid demo, I guess, comes out.
4029301	4033582	So, well, if you have a PS3 now, might as well download it, put it on your hard drive.
4033602	4035582	I mean, honestly...
4036451	4038172	What else are you going to fill that hard drive with?
4039653	4040613	It wasn't a bad game.
4041153	4042234	I mean, it's good for a demo.
4043054	4044755	I just can't see myself paying 50 bucks.
4045315	4049497	I can't see myself paying 50 bucks for Gran Turismo 5 Prolog.
4050057	4052459	I'm telling you, put porn on the PlayStation Network.
4052879	4055900	Sony will start outselling Microsoft consoles tomorrow.
4056861	4057441	Mark my words.
4060562	4061543	Okay, don't mark my words.
4061603	4062323	Read another story.
4063063	4064084	Mark my words.
4064664	4065925	You will perish.
4066897	4067157	Anyways.
4067257	4068157	The fuck was that?
4068257	4068657	I don't know.
4068697	4069478	That sounded funny.
4070638	4071798	Do you need some fresh air, Loki?
4071818	4072518	You feeling okay?
4072538	4073058	Have you had your meds?
4073078	4073458	I'm feeling fine.
4073478	4074639	I had to drive from Oakland.
4074679	4075879	I'm feeling tingle fresh.
4079360	4079940	By the way, folks.
4080040	4080900	Mark my words!
4080980	4082080	You will pay for that!
4082941	4083241	Anyways.
4083561	4085661	By the way, kids, don't forget to buy the Eye of Judgment.
4085681	4086681	We only have to sell a million.
4089382	4091242	If you don't know what I'm talking about, listen to last week's show.
4091923	4092863	It will never happen.
4093323	4093563	Never.
4095100	4095500	Story!
4095961	4101485	Anyways, so, in Europe, PlayStation 3 is getting yet another bundle.
4102165	4105868	Not surprising, though, it's going to be bundled with Pro Evolution Soccer 2008.
4106288	4109051	And it's coming in November.
4111653	4112813	That's all there is to say.
4113474	4117417	Yeah, it was confirmed by PlayStation France, and...
4119059	4128744	Yeah, well, that's, I mean, that's logical, you know, sports bundles are nothing uncommon, and certainly in Europe, a soccer bundle's gonna sell some systems, so, you know, makes sense.
4129225	4129665	Exactly!
4130245	4134948	I mean, remember that really crappy one that they did for, I think it was Pro Evo 2007?
4135268	4135708	Mm-hmm.
4136409	4137870	It was, like, with AstroTurf on the 360?
4137910	4138590	Yeah.
4140711	4142092	Wait, it came with AstroTurf?
4142172	4142412	What?
4142712	4146174	Well, they did, like, it was a auction thing where they were selling it.
4146334	4146394	Oh.
4146414	4147255	They had AstroTurf.
4147275	4147355	What?
4147942	4148883	Thank you for watching!
4165996	4170857	There's a brand new Kingdom Reborn update, which I think we reported on previously in the program.
4171157	4174738	It's free to download for the previous subscribers through October 9th.
4175578	4179639	But however, there's also now the Return to Britannia campaign that's going on.
4180419	4190321	Electronic Arts is doing a monster hunt and prizes such as a new pendant necklace, a whole map of Britannia that you can win, a commemorative sculpture, armor set, all this stuff.
4190941	4194762	The characters in game get fireworks and 10 decor tokens.
4195902	4198523	Unfortunately, I haven't played the game, so I can't tell you what those tokens do.
4198843	4200883	But maybe somebody can email us and let us know.
4201063	4202603	Maybe buy more fireworks!
4202903	4206364	I was actually going to check this game out, because I think you can get a two-week free trial.
4206784	4211505	And since I've been going back and forth on all these MMOs lately, why not check out the granddaddy of all the MMOs?
4211725	4215286	I remember when I played Ultima Online with my friend briefly.
4215686	4217406	And God, I don't remember who it was.
4217746	4218586	It was so long ago.
4218646	4222627	But we were complete asses on the game, and it was fun.
4222887	4223447	You didn't get banned?
4224338	4232828	Oh no, we were just playing around at his house and just ran around as our character was completely naked, yelling sausage for sale.
4233669	4234891	That's all I remember.
4237534	4239637	That's all I remember.
4240037	4243802	I think I saw that in the Barons the other day, so some things never change, you know?
4245746	4246826	No, no, no, no, no.
4246866	4253949	Someone was walking around in one of the towns in Ragnarok the other day going, I got a snake man, like the Adam Sandler thing.
4254069	4258090	It's just that now they've taken that and now it's just Slashdance.
4258130	4259410	Does Ultima Online have Slashdance?
4259430	4259950	I don't believe it.
4259990	4261171	We don't have Slashdance in Ragnarok.
4261191	4265432	I just remember it was weird because people would buy houses and they would store their horse in their house.
4265492	4269553	And I was like, why would you put a – when we were walking past a house, do I hear a horse?
4270414	4270814	It was weird.
4270874	4272274	But it's because you can lock the houses.
4272534	4274735	Otherwise your stuff would get stolen, I guess, or something.
4275174	4275894	I know a couple people who play.
4275914	4276014	Yeah.
4276054	4276194	Hmm.
4299188	4300151	Alright.
4300291	4302416	Ask them if they're having fun with the event or whatever.
4302696	4304420	We'll have to bring them on the show for an interview.
4304540	4305282	Interviewed this week.
4305322	4306725	People that actually play Ultima Online.
4306745	4308168	It's either Ultima Online or Diablo.
4308309	4309251	Oh, because they're so similar.
4310586	4312107	They look very similar, actually.
4312127	4314169	Some of them I just sort of get mixed up on.
4314189	4316710	Like, who plays EverQuest anymore?
4317131	4330199	To be honest, when I went out to Pennsylvania last year, one of the workers at our office that we work with out there, without saying too much about what I do during the day, she knew that I was into video games.
4330239	4332861	I said, yeah, at the time I was playing Final Fantasy XI.
4332901	4334062	I'm like, yeah, I played Final Fantasy XI.
4334082	4337064	She's all, oh, I tried that once, but I just can't give up EverQuest.
4337591	4338131	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4366067	4371511	DarkSakura, every week she likes to surf the internet up and down and all around and bring you her very favorite in websites.
4371591	4376675	By the way, folks, this is the very last edition of DarkSakura's website of the week.
4376775	4389865	I'm sorry to report DarkSakura is no longer going to be able to give you a website of the week because pretty much you can bet that if the site has something to do with pictures of cats, it's probably going to be her website of the week.
4392068	4394590	DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week Classic Game of the Week
4420372	4421292	I'm so disappointed.
4421532	4422113	No, that's okay.
4422213	4423173	That's too predictable.
4423713	4425313	Guardian Legend we'll save for down the road.
4425373	4428554	It'll be something obscure like Rainbow Cotton.
4428954	4430375	Anyhow, don't give it away.
4431775	4433055	They won't want to tune in next week.
4433536	4435496	Make it a game you don't talk about a lot on the show.
4437497	4441338	Anyhow, here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the very last website of the week.
4445399	4447079	Dark Sakura, you better be good.
4448231	4456533	The website of the week is speaklolcat.com It's very easy, very simple.
4457013	4460314	You type in something in English and it translates it into cat speak.
4460614	4461974	What did I tell all of you?
4463015	4464855	If it has to do with lolcat, it's your site of the week.
4464875	4466216	See, I'm going to type in something right now.
4469356	4470197	Um, okay.
4470737	4471197	I don't know.
4471397	4472457	I'm talking and I'm waiting.
4472477	4473257	What are you putting in there?
4473597	4474458	Rob is a big what?
4474638	4474918	Tool?
4474938	4475318	Tool?
4475358	4475678	Tool?
4476957	4478698	And it says Rob is hooge tool.
4482079	4482479	Lovely.
4482579	4484740	I'm going to post that direct link into the chat room.
4485660	4494044	But it's speaklolcat.com And that, boys and girls, is the very last website of the week.
4494904	4495424	End of line.
4496444	4499446	Alright, so next week, DarkSakura's classic game of the week.
4501667	4504828	Oh, you can actually link it with it saying Rob is a big tool.
4504868	4505988	Yep, that's why I did it.
4506028	4507689	Let me just check that out on my screen here.
4507929	4508449	This is great.
4509949	4511229	Rob is hooge tool.
4512550	4513030	You're a bitch.
4513350	4513650	All right.
4514010	4514670	I love you.
4515210	4516391	Wait, actually, I want to see that.
4516831	4517211	Let's see.
4517251	4518211	Let me go back to that site here.
4518951	4522732	Jamie is a bitch.
4522772	4524473	Rob's really good at typing with one hand.
4525153	4526453	I can do a lot of things with one hand.
4527874	4529154	Jamie is bish.
4530282	4531683	Okay, where did that come from?
4536664	4538325	I think this show is in need of a break.
4540246	4544447	I think this show might actually be in need of cancellation, but we'll have to do it for a break for now.
4544807	4547488	We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
4548148	4550789	Nintendo News, we haven't even touched Nintendo yet during the show.
4551030	4553390	We'll get to all the Nintendo News in Part B and plenty more to come.
4553410	4555971	Don't worry, we'll touch Nintendo plenty when we come back.
4556031	4557692	We'll get out our Wii's when we come back.
4558553	4563536	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice a week.
4563996	4568318	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
