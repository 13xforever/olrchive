147000	149000	I want to know where the Tootsie Rolls are
149000	151000	There are no Tootsie Rolls
151000	153000	I do have brownies
153000	155000	There's no joke there
155000	157000	I really do have little yummy brownies
157000	159000	They taste like coffee too
159000	161000	Like the Starbucks ones
161000	165000	I'm hoping that if we can get all the computer issues worked out
165000	167000	We can go out into El Garage
167000	169000	I mean the studio
169000	171000	That's not a converted garage door
171000	173000	Remember change under the couch
173000	175000	We can go out there for next week's program
175000	177000	And I'm pretty excited about that
177000	179000	So it'll be fun
179000	181000	And no laundry baskets to be found out there
181000	183000	But there is a washer and dryer that will be off during the program
183000	185000	Anyhow
185000	187000	Let me also introduce the chatroom
187000	189000	Aren't you glad you subscribed us?
189000	191000	That's going to be just like, MOM! I'm recording my show!
191000	193000	Get out of here!
193000	195000	Gosh damn
195000	197000	Luckily I don't live with my parents
197000	199000	That's one good thing about the program
199000	201000	I don't live with my parents
201000	203000	We live with our parents
203000	205000	Good job everybody
205000	207000	You guys all have spouses though
207000	209000	I'm the only unmarried one
209000	211000	I haven't lived with my parents since I was 15
211000	213000	Ow
213000	215000	Mommy wow
215000	217000	Anyway there's the chatroom
217000	219000	chat.orangelaungeradio.com
219000	221000	We too says put up pics
221000	223000	Well we actually simulcast on operator11
223000	225000	So if you head on over to operator11.com
225000	227000	Of which I saw Frisbee put up the link in chat earlier
227000	229000	Or for those of you guys listening on the archive
229000	231000	And search for Orangelaungeradio
231000	233000	And you can look at the simulcast of our webcam
233000	235000	It's all archived on there
235000	237000	Because operator11 is cool and they let us eat up tons of disc space
237000	239000	With our big talking heads doing the podcast
239000	241000	Someone asked special brownies
241000	243000	Once again there is no budget
243000	245000	For special brownies
245000	247000	Like we could afford marijuana even if we wanted to eat it
247000	249000	Which I'm not really into that
249000	251000	Why would you want to eat marijuana?
251000	253000	Well apparently it gets you high
253000	255000	Yeah but it tastes like ass
255000	257000	I can't still
257000	259000	Stay on the smell of marijuana
259000	261000	Remember kids don't do drugs
261000	263000	Don't we do video games once in a while?
263000	265000	Here on this show
265000	267000	DarkSakura please save us from turning into the hashcast
267000	269000	And tell us about your gaming week
269000	271000	I play a lot of Ragnarok online
271000	273000	A lot
273000	275000	Dude I played this game called Ragnarok
275000	277000	You're so cool
277000	279000	Hey Rob shut up
279000	281000	I'm a level 91 assassin now
281000	283000	Been beating the shit out of ogres
283000	285000	And I've also got
285000	287000	People are going to yell at me
287000	289000	Because you're not supposed to do one
289000	291000	But I'm working on
291000	293000	Well I was going to make an agility spear knight
293000	295000	And now I'm making an agility
295000	297000	One handed sword crusader
297000	299000	So
299000	301000	But I am going to do a spear knight next
301000	303000	Because spear knights are cool
303000	305000	They have long pulls and poke things with them
305000	307000	Wow
307000	309000	Sounds kind of
309000	311000	Nevermind
311000	313000	I've not played any World of Warcraft
313000	315000	In fact I'm going to stop paying for it
315000	317000	While my computer is down
317000	319000	And I actually did not play any pinball this week
319000	321000	But
321000	323000	Excuse me
323000	325000	Halo 3 in my house
325000	327000	We had a bunch of people in our house
327000	329000	Doing multiplayer Halo campaigns
329000	331000	And then the other night
331000	333000	Dan decided to get all of his buddies
333000	335000	We had Will in one of the rooms
335000	337000	And then
337000	339000	Our friend Alex
339000	341000	Who is a crazy psycho ex-marine
341000	343000	Was that a LAN party?
343000	345000	A local area nerd party?
345000	347000	Yeah
347000	349000	But they beat it on Legendary
349000	351000	According to Dan
351000	353000	The way to beat Halo 3 on Legendary
353000	355000	Is to be an uber sniper
355000	357000	Good times
357000	359000	I've compared Legendary
359000	361000	To Nightmare on Doom
361000	363000	That's like old school Halo 1
363000	365000	Because that's the only way you could network back in the day
365000	367000	Was LANing it
367000	369000	I'm glad to hear
369000	371000	Actually I saw Dan online
371000	373000	And I saw that he was playing campaign
373000	375000	On Legendary and co-op
375000	377000	I was like wow
377000	379000	I play the game on normal
379000	381000	I would play on easy
381000	383000	But you don't get achievements on easy
383000	385000	I play on normal
385000	387000	I seriously died 10 times in the first level
387000	389000	I suck at Halo
389000	391000	So bad
391000	393000	There should be a charity for me
393000	395000	It's sad
395000	397000	Oh oh oh
397000	399000	It was this week
399000	401000	Oh oh oh
401000	403000	It's a flash game
403000	405000	What's that?
405000	407000	I think someone
407000	409000	IM'd it to me
409000	411000	I'm trying to find
411000	413000	Give me a second I don't get the name of it
413000	415000	It's basically like a stick figure
415000	417000	Stick figure version
417000	419000	Of Dragon's Lair
419000	421000	It's fucking fantastic
421000	423000	Down to having
423000	425000	Little music and death scenes
425000	427000	And the cut scenes
427000	429000	And all that fun
429000	431000	It's called Dungeon Escape
431000	433000	And it can be found
433000	435000	And I'm trying to get the
435000	437000	Address for people
437000	439000	It's at
439000	441000	Ok studiohunty
441000	443000	H-U-N-T-Y dot com
443000	445000	Slash dungeon
445000	447000	And I'm going to link it in the chat room
447000	449000	It's hilarious
449000	451000	It's not just hilarious it's HILARIOUS
451000	453000	HILARIOUS
453000	455000	Yeah I'm going to link it in the chat room
455000	457000	Alright well while that's being linked
457000	459000	If there's nothing else for your gaming week
459000	461000	We'll move on over to Loki, how was your gaming week?
461000	463000	My gaming week was fine
463000	465000	Let's see
465000	467000	I started off
467000	469000	Playing Halo 3 on
469000	471000	Legendary, single player
471000	473000	Because no one wants to fucking enjoy my games
473000	475000	Fuck you all, I'll beat it myself
475000	477000	And I'm better than you
477000	479000	I'll play with you but I'll probably hold you back
479000	481000	Whatever, I've been playing it
481000	483000	By myself
483000	485000	Wait I want to know where all this sand in your vagina is coming from
485000	487000	Are you sending out invites to people on your friends list?
487000	489000	No I don't send out invites at all
489000	491000	Well then if you don't invite people
491000	493000	Then how do you expect people to join your party?
493000	495000	I'm supposed to be an internet celebrity or something that says people
495000	497000	Wake up call
497000	499000	You are not famous
499000	501000	I have no patience to sit in the lobby for like
501000	503000	A long time
503000	505000	It's because I have boobies
505000	507000	But no it's fine
507000	509000	Actually it's funny because I'm getting stuck in the same spots
509000	511000	I did in the normal game
511000	513000	Wait what about Bobby?
513000	515000	I thought Bobby Blackwolf was your only friend
515000	517000	On Playstation 3
517000	519000	Isn't he your friend on Xbox Live?
519000	521000	Yeah but he's not on there
521000	523000	He plays the Halo
523000	525000	I've seen him on Halo a couple times
525000	527000	Well you should give him a call or something
527000	529000	Say hey Bobby
529000	531000	Oh yeah let me just
531000	533000	My phone that has everyone's phone number in it
533000	535000	Oh there it is, Bobby's number
535000	537000	Oh wait no I don't have Bobby's number
537000	539000	I don't have a whole phone that doesn't exist
539000	541000	Ok now
541000	543000	Really I could sit here saying hey
543000	545000	You know
545000	547000	Want to play some Halo 3 but to be honest
547000	549000	I don't know when I'm going to be online to play Halo 3
549000	551000	You know
551000	553000	I'm doing all sorts of busy stuff like
553000	555000	Going to see Eastern Promises and crap
555000	557000	So I don't know
557000	559000	But um
559000	561000	So other than playing Halo 3
561000	563000	I've actually, well of course more scenes
563000	565000	Row multiplayer and people are certainly pissed off
565000	567000	Because
567000	569000	It's kind of unfair for them
569000	571000	I've been playing on other people's systems
571000	573000	You know while
573000	575000	They were gone or something and
575000	577000	Yeah my system is way
577000	579000	Better
579000	581000	Like if I get caught on fire
581000	583000	I burn out a lot quicker
583000	585000	My rockets seem to have better accuracy
585000	587000	I can kill them a lot easier
587000	589000	I don't know why
589000	591000	But that's just the way it is
591000	593000	Anyways
593000	595000	Other than all that stuff
595000	597000	On the PSP I've been playing
597000	599000	Jackass the game
599000	601000	And I love it
601000	603000	It's so stupid and simple
603000	605000	It's so
605000	607000	It's such a you game
607000	609000	It's really, I mean it is not hard at all
609000	611000	To play through the game at all
611000	613000	And it's fun
613000	615000	It's just stupid little things
615000	617000	It's a great rental game
617000	619000	And I think it's also probably a good game
619000	621000	To have friends over
621000	623000	You can play it and laugh
623000	625000	On the PSP how do you play
625000	627000	Well not on the PSP but like
627000	629000	It's also on Playstation 2
629000	631000	I don't have the Playstation 2 version
631000	633000	Because my sister is still borrowing my Playstation 2
633000	635000	You need to call her up and say hey
635000	637000	Bring it back
637000	639000	I did say hey bring it back
639000	641000	But she hasn't brought it back yet
641000	643000	You send out the troops
643000	645000	And then let's see
645000	647000	Other than that I tried Driver 76
647000	649000	For the PSP
649000	651000	Much like every other Driver game known to man
651000	653000	I'm not going to try the Driver series anymore
653000	655000	I'm going to stay away from it
655000	659000	And I think that's pretty much it
659000	661000	Oh I played with
661000	663000	I've updated my firmware
663000	665000	On my PSP Slim
665000	667000	To the 3.71 CFW
667000	669000	Or whatever the new
669000	671000	One that's done by Team M33
671000	673000	Which ends up being Dark Alex anyways
673000	675000	The guy that did all the other custom firmwares
675000	677000	So now since I have
677000	679000	3.71 CFW I can put the official themes
679000	681000	On there and so I have
681000	683000	A cookie theme on my
683000	685000	Because it comes with it
685000	687000	A cookie theme?
687000	689000	Like
689000	691000	Like peanut butter cookies
691000	693000	Or Cookie Monster
693000	695000	It's chocolate chip cookies
695000	697000	And I will show you
697000	699000	It's hilarious
699000	701000	Sony would like to remind you
701000	703000	Not to eat your PSP
703000	705000	No but it seriously is the cookie theme
705000	707000	What about the OLR theme?
707000	709000	What happened to that?
709000	711000	I haven't made that yet
711000	713000	And I will get into that later
713000	715000	I was going to say I just had to pay to renew OLRPSP.com
715000	717000	Our PSP site this week
717000	719000	Oh it does look like someone ate your PSP
719000	721000	Oh I see
721000	723000	It changes all the icons into cookies as well
723000	725000	Hold on I'll put that on the OP11 cam in a minute
725000	727000	Get it?
727000	729000	Don't eat the PSP Jamie
729000	731000	It's not healthy
731000	733000	There's actually one thing that
733000	735000	I didn't make tonight
735000	737000	The Japan Playstation site
737000	739000	Released the official tool to make themes
739000	741000	So yes
741000	743000	We can make an OLR theme
743000	745000	For the PSP
745000	747000	And it's pretty sweet
747000	749000	But there's some other ones on there
749000	751000	They have like wipeout
751000	753000	And some pretty pink one
753000	755000	That I'm not going to put on my system
755000	757000	I'm sure Nellie would want that on hers
757000	759000	I don't know
759000	761000	So
761000	763000	It's neat I guess
763000	765000	I don't know if I'd upgrade it
765000	767000	To just get that
767000	769000	But it's neat
769000	771000	ShadowSlayer says
771000	773000	Lowkey's PSP is delish
773000	775000	Darktachidea says
775000	777000	This is a PSP made of chocolate chips and cookie dough
777000	779000	Could you imagine if the PSP could just make cookies?
779000	781000	It would be awesome
781000	783000	It would be totally worth the price
783000	785000	Even though the PSP
785000	787000	I've been growing fonder and fonder
787000	789000	This year and last year
789000	791000	When the thing first came out
791000	793000	I've been more fond of the PSP this year
793000	795000	It would be even awesomer if it made cookies
795000	797000	I think more people would buy those than DS's
797000	799000	If that happened
799000	801000	It would be hilarious
801000	803000	If they had an
803000	805000	Easy Bake Oven
805000	807000	Attachment for the DS
807000	809000	You know how they always put all these weird attachments
809000	811000	In the Game Boy Advance slot
811000	813000	Something like that
813000	815000	Where you actually program stuff in there
815000	817000	And you can cook a cookie at a time
817000	819000	It's a DS
819000	821000	That would be kind of neat
821000	823000	I don't know
823000	825000	Going on to my gaming week
825000	827000	I haven't played a whole lot
827000	829000	I did play some more Halo 3
829000	831000	Which you know I'm not a big fan of first person shooters
831000	833000	I do like Halo
833000	835000	I love that they
835000	837000	Just added all this crap into it
837000	839000	I don't know what else to call it
839000	841000	It's all this crap in the game
841000	843000	You can go back and watch your multiplayer matches
843000	845000	And take pictures
845000	847000	I don't know
847000	849000	There's not a lot I can say
849000	851000	Really the only people this is benefiting
851000	853000	Me talking about Halo 3
853000	855000	Is people that don't already own an Xbox 360
855000	857000	Because I think most people that do
857000	859000	Probably went out and got the game
859000	861000	Unless you hate first person shooters for some reason
861000	863000	In which case I find it hard to believe you got
863000	865000	Xbox 360 in the first place
865000	867000	To be honest I was never a fan of Halo
867000	869000	And Halo 3 is pretty cool
869000	871000	I think the matchmaking is pretty good
871000	873000	I do admit
873000	875000	I've played and certainly there's been news about that
875000	877000	This week which we'll get into a little later
877000	879000	But you know what it's not all about graphics
879000	881000	And they are bright though
881000	883000	And vibrant
883000	885000	The only reason I've always loved Halo before was multiplayer
885000	887000	And multiplayer doesn't disappoint
887000	889000	I mean in regards it is just
889000	891000	Halo 2 but you know
891000	893000	With more and that's okay
893000	895000	But if you're not a fan of Halo
895000	897000	At all I don't know if this
897000	899000	Is going to do it for you
899000	901000	Especially the single player mode man
901000	903000	There's no back story no nothing
903000	905000	I find it hard to follow because
905000	907000	I'm not good at single player therefore I
907000	909000	Don't really play the campaign modes of the other games
909000	911000	So anyway
911000	913000	That's that
913000	915000	Halo 3 and then
915000	917000	World of Warcraft I finally went back to after
917000	919000	About a three week vacation
919000	921000	I decided to go back to World of Warcraft this week
921000	923000	And
923000	925000	Trying to think how that's been going
925000	927000	I just hit level 66
927000	929000	Ran some instances with some friends
929000	931000	Over in uh near Thrallmar
931000	933000	I can't remember what that zone is called
933000	935000	But yeah back into World of Warcraft
935000	937000	Which I missed a little bit
937000	939000	And I'm glad I waited because now I have a bunch of friends in the guild
939000	941000	That are on the same level I am so we're running instances together
941000	943000	Good times
943000	945000	Other than that not a whole lot
945000	947000	There was no new arcade release this week
947000	949000	Did you notice that?
949000	951000	Am I the one that noticed that?
951000	953000	Like that they decided you know on Xbox Live arcade
953000	955000	That since Halo 3 came out they didn't need an arcade release this week
955000	957000	I mean I guess they released like a Bomberman pack
957000	959000	Or something there was nothing new
959000	961000	Am I the one that noticed that?
961000	963000	I was looking forward to something new on Wednesday
963000	965000	Well there wasn't anything new
965000	967000	I think just like you said
967000	969000	You know you almost didn't notice
969000	971000	Well I think probably a lot of people
971000	973000	Almost didn't notice
973000	975000	Yeah I think a lot of people probably didn't care
975000	977000	They've been doing two a week
977000	979000	So I mean that's pretty good
979000	981000	Yeah in our chat room HendersonMan says
981000	983000	I noticed I want Puzzle Quest
983000	985000	Yeah I kind of feel the same way like there's all this cool stuff
985000	987000	That I want
987000	989000	But Puzzle Quest isn't probably coming out until November
989000	991000	Because that's when the console versions are coming out
991000	993000	But then you know there's Res and there's
993000	995000	Res ain't coming out this year okay
995000	997000	I can tell you that much
997000	999000	You're a jerk
999000	1001000	Just other stuff would be cool
1001000	1003000	Omega 5 maybe
1003000	1005000	I don't think Res is coming out this year
1005000	1007000	How about Castle Crashers?
1007000	1009000	Where the fuck is Castle Crashers?
1009000	1011000	There you go wasn't that supposed to be out last year?
1011000	1013000	Yeah
1013000	1015000	In our chat room sometimes our chatters like to post
1015000	1017000	About their gaming weeks
1017000	1019000	And I think my favorite gaming week goes to AJ Mix
1019000	1021000	In our chat room says
1021000	1023000	My gaming week, Legend of the Mystical Ninja
1023000	1025000	On Wii Virtual Console and Halo 3
1025000	1027000	And I think he wins because
1027000	1029000	Legend of the Mystical Ninja is awesome
1029000	1031000	It is a pretty awesome game
1031000	1033000	Have you gotten to the place where you can play
1033000	1035000	Gradius in one of the arcades
1035000	1037000	Like little shops in game
1037000	1039000	It's pretty awesome
1039000	1041000	Take a look at that
1041000	1043000	Anyhow
1043000	1045000	Let's get into some housekeeping for tonight
1045000	1047000	Of which again we don't have a whole lot
1047000	1049000	There's not been a whole lot of news going on with our show recently
1049000	1051000	So of course we'll continue to plug the community
1051000	1053000	Such as our LiveJournal community at Orange Lounge
1053000	1055000	On LiveJournal our username
1055000	1057000	Our MySpace at MySpace.com
1057000	1059000	Our Facebook
1059000	1061000	I think it's called the OL Army
1061000	1063000	Or the OLR listeners or something
1063000	1065000	On Facebook and
1065000	1067000	If you listened to our show a couple weeks ago
1067000	1069000	I don't really use Facebook that religiously
1069000	1071000	You can go to www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com
1071000	1073000	Next week is episode 250
1073000	1075000	And although we're not planning
1075000	1077000	A whole lot of big stuff for it
1077000	1079000	Because we already had our 5th anniversary show this year
1079000	1081000	So we already kind of did fun stuff for that
1081000	1083000	We're hoping to actually switch our location a little bit
1083000	1085000	Which for those of you that listen to us live and watch on the webcam
1085000	1087000	Might get a kick out of that
1087000	1089000	And we're hoping to also bring some more interviews
1089000	1091000	And just do some reshuffling of the show
1091000	1093000	If you have ideas go post on our forums
1093000	1095000	What kinds of things you'd like to see on Orange Lounge Radio
1095000	1097000	So we go into our next 50 episodes
1097000	1099000	And 100 more after that
1099000	1101000	And who knows how much longer we can get this show going
1101000	1103000	Anyway
1103000	1105000	Let's get into some gaming news
1105000	1107000	We'll start off with Loki tonight, some gaming news
1107000	1109000	Anyways of course the big news this week
1109000	1111000	Was Halo 3 came out
1111000	1113000	And it sold a lot of copies
1113000	1115000	In fact
1115000	1117000	Game Daily estimates that
1117000	1119000	They've sold
1119000	1121000	2.48 million units
1121000	1123000	On day 1
1123000	1125000	And of course of that most of them
1125000	1127000	Of course being standard editions
1127000	1129000	And then of course it tears down from there
1129000	1131000	Limited and legendary
1131000	1133000	But that's a whole lot of games
1133000	1135000	I don't know
1135000	1137000	I mean I'm not surprised
1137000	1139000	We knew it was going to sell like crazy
1139000	1141000	And
1141000	1143000	Yeah it's going to continue to sell like crazy
1143000	1145000	Weren't they touting on
1145000	1147000	Xbox.com or somewhere
1147000	1149000	That it's like biggest entertainment day ever
1149000	1151000	Well they're saying that
1151000	1153000	There are sales
1153000	1155000	Top that of like
1155000	1157000	I don't know
1157000	1159000	Spiderman 3 or something like that
1159000	1161000	The box office gross
1161000	1163000	To which I say Spiderman 3 wasn't that great of a movie
1163000	1165000	Well also it costs
1165000	1167000	You know what 9.50 maybe 10.50
1167000	1169000	Depending on where you live to go to the movies
1169000	1171000	To see Spiderman 3
1171000	1173000	And if you're cheap like me you'll go to like a matinee for 7 bucks
1173000	1175000	But Halo 3
1175000	1177000	60 bucks plus tax
1177000	1179000	For Halo 3 so of course it made a shit load of money
1179000	1181000	Right?
1181000	1183000	I mean I don't know
1183000	1185000	Is my math that screwed up
1185000	1187000	I mean we can do the math and figure out exactly how much it made
1187000	1189000	I just don't care
1189000	1191000	It says
1191000	1193000	We all knew Halo 3 was going to make shit loads of money
1193000	1195000	And that's really what the press release should have said
1195000	1197000	Confirmed Halo 3 makes shit load of money
1197000	1199000	It made a lot of money
1199000	1201000	And I mean it's just going to
1201000	1203000	It'll help them out it'll sell consoles possibly
1203000	1205000	I mean although some people
1205000	1207000	From other companies have come out and said
1207000	1209000	No it's not people that already wanted
1209000	1211000	You know
1211000	1213000	Halo 3 have already bought a 360
1213000	1215000	Or some shit like that
1215000	1217000	But it will sell consoles
1217000	1219000	Because there are people that were waiting for Halo 3
1219000	1221000	Before they bought
1221000	1223000	I don't know
1223000	1225000	It's good for Microsoft
1225000	1227000	Misty in our chat room says
1227000	1229000	What? It's Halo 3
1229000	1231000	Even Burger King is advertising it
1231000	1233000	Money aside I wonder why
1233000	1235000	Considering it's an M rated game
1235000	1237000	Good point
1237000	1239000	It's like the child movies in Dora the Explorer
1239000	1241000	Here's the reason
1241000	1243000	Burger King still advertises R rated movies
1243000	1245000	And that kind of stuff
1245000	1247000	Do they?
1247000	1249000	I think so
1249000	1251000	I don't know
1251000	1253000	Can you get little toys with your meals there?
1253000	1255000	Well you can get different things
1255000	1257000	Actually no Jurassic Burger is PG-13
1257000	1259000	But here's the thing though
1259000	1261000	And it kind of goes back to the whole
1261000	1263000	ESRB ratings
1263000	1265000	There are no laws in place
1265000	1267000	Forbidding people from playing the game
1267000	1269000	If it's
1269000	1271000	If they're under 18
1271000	1273000	Or whatever
1273000	1275000	It's really all just
1275000	1277000	Store policies
1277000	1279000	And stuff like that
1279000	1281000	Unless of course you're in specific states
1281000	1283000	Which makes it a felony to sell
1283000	1285000	The game to a minor
1285000	1287000	But
1287000	1289000	It's still
1289000	1291000	It's not a law
1291000	1293000	TigerKlon our chat room says
1293000	1295000	He ends up as an unlockable character in Halo 3
1295000	1297000	That'd be awesome cause then he could shoot it over and over again
1297000	1299000	That would be the best ever
1299000	1301000	Cause he's really freakin' disturbing
1301000	1303000	Then I want Ronald McDonald in the Grimace
1303000	1305000	I would rather not have him in there
1305000	1307000	To be honest
1307000	1309000	No it would be kind of jumping the shark
1309000	1311000	Yeah it would be
1311000	1313000	They've already hoarded themselves out enough for Halo 3
1313000	1315000	Maybe in Halo 4
1315000	1317000	It was everywhere
1317000	1319000	We don't need it to be quite that everywhere
1319000	1321000	Brad from Pod Culture
1321000	1323000	Is in our chat room and says
1323000	1325000	The guy ahead of me in line for Halo 3
1325000	1327000	Dropped 800 bucks
1327000	1329000	He bought the legendary edition
1329000	1331000	The Halo version of the 360 console
1331000	1333000	The two Halo controllers and some other crap
1333000	1335000	800 bucks on Halo
1335000	1337000	And he's a consumer of horror
1337000	1339000	And how?
1339000	1341000	Well I see
1341000	1343000	The 360
1343000	1345000	Halo 3 system I think is not selling as well
1345000	1347000	I think they thought it would
1347000	1349000	I think it's butt ugly
1349000	1351000	It's a paint job for 50 extra bucks
1351000	1353000	I think cause most people already bought
1353000	1355000	The 360 that were anticipating
1355000	1357000	Halo before they announced this
1357000	1359000	It's a system that doesn't
1359000	1361000	Include Halo 3
1361000	1363000	That's for 50 extra dollars
1363000	1365000	That's a weird color
1365000	1367000	I mean
1367000	1369000	That's kind of stupid
1369000	1371000	Least you could do is throw in the game
1371000	1373000	I mean come on
1373000	1375000	Did anyone go out to the midnight sales or hear about them?
1375000	1377000	No
1377000	1379000	God damn I meant to get
1379000	1381000	My husband was that one cause he sold
1381000	1383000	And what did he say? Did he say anything about it?
1383000	1385000	He said they were butt ugly
1385000	1387000	The people? No
1387000	1389000	I was gonna say
1389000	1391000	Actually our manager
1391000	1393000	In Dallas Texas
1393000	1395000	He dresses up like a Spartan
1395000	1397000	He has an actual Spartan costume
1397000	1399000	It looks cool too
1399000	1401000	He went out to some Dallas launches
1401000	1403000	And stuff
1403000	1405000	And walked around and did fun stuff like that
1405000	1407000	I don't get it
1407000	1409000	I mean
1409000	1411000	It's cool
1411000	1413000	I just don't want to do every single midnight
1413000	1415000	It's like you've seen a midnight launch
1415000	1417000	Then you've seen them all
1417000	1419000	It's just someone else cosplaying as something else
1419000	1421000	And a long ass line
1421000	1423000	And people waiting
1423000	1425000	And excited about something
1425000	1427000	It's interesting cause Halo 3 is pretty awesome
1427000	1429000	But it's not gonna be the game of the year for me
1429000	1431000	And I think for a lot of people
1431000	1433000	I don't think it's gonna be the game of the year
1433000	1435000	Oh it's gonna be worth the wait
1435000	1437000	It's good
1437000	1439000	It's better than good, it's great
1439000	1441000	But I don't think it's gonna be game of the year
1441000	1443000	I can already think of at least one game
1443000	1445000	That's very similar to Halo that's better
1445000	1447000	It didn't even have multiplayer mode
1447000	1449000	Well I mean
1449000	1451000	I don't think a game really needs to be
1451000	1453000	You know
1453000	1455000	To have the best graphics
1455000	1457000	It's all about the best gameplay
1457000	1459000	And has great gameplay
1459000	1461000	Halo 2 before Halo 3 came out
1461000	1463000	Was still on the top 10
1463000	1465000	Most played
1465000	1467000	Game on live
1467000	1469000	And now Halo 3 will just take that spot
1469000	1471000	And
1471000	1473000	People will still buy it
1473000	1475000	It's just what
1475000	1477000	Makes a good game though
1477000	1479000	Is the fact that even throughout time
1479000	1481000	As new games come out
1481000	1483000	People are still interested in that game
1483000	1485000	It's just like
1485000	1487000	When Saints Row
1487000	1489000	2 comes out
1489000	1491000	Are people gonna be still playing
1491000	1493000	Crackdown or
1493000	1495000	The original Saints Row
1495000	1497000	Or Grand Theft Auto 4
1497000	1499000	When that comes out everyone's gonna forget about
1499000	1501000	A lot of other games as well
1501000	1503000	I don't know if it's just me or the people on my friends list
1503000	1505000	But I notice a lot of my friends list
1505000	1507000	Don't play
1507000	1509000	They're very much in the now
1509000	1511000	I only ever see people playing the current games
1511000	1513000	Or the games that have come out within the past month
1513000	1515000	Obviously this week it's been Halo 3
1515000	1517000	I'm sure everybody's friends list is like that
1517000	1519000	But before that it was all Bioshock
1519000	1521000	And you don't see anybody playing
1521000	1523000	You know, Ridge Racer 6 anymore
1523000	1525000	Or you know, it's just very interesting
1525000	1527000	Not a lot of people playing the old stuff
1527000	1529000	I don't know
1529000	1531000	Thought it was interesting
1531000	1533000	Anyway, I think this is kinda interesting too
1533000	1535000	Is that there's some Halo 3
1535000	1537000	Errors, some disc errors
1537000	1539000	That are pissing people off
1539000	1541000	The legendary, I'm sorry not the legendary
1541000	1543000	But the limited edition versions of the games
1543000	1545000	Apparently have some
1545000	1547000	Disc copies of Halo 3
1547000	1549000	It's causing some disc read errors
1549000	1551000	Even on some consoles the red's ringing of death
1551000	1553000	Well, that's bullshit
1553000	1555000	Yeah, I don't know about that
1555000	1557000	If like one little disc skip can cause that
1557000	1559000	But you know, the things are all under warranty anyway
1559000	1561000	So I mean it shouldn't be too big of a deal
1561000	1563000	But certainly people that wanted to get their Halo
1563000	1565000	On launch night are pretty pissed off
1565000	1567000	That the limited edition copies are scratched
1567000	1571000	Now naturally they have a replacement disc program in the works
1571000	1573000	And all that stuff
1573000	1575000	I'm not sure that somebody's probably getting fired over this
1575000	1577000	Well, all it was was the crappy packaging
1577000	1579000	And the cause of the disc
1579000	1581000	To fall off the hub
1581000	1583000	Because it was a piece of crap
1583000	1585000	And I don't understand why
1585000	1587000	Because in other countries they had a piece of foam
1587000	1589000	And they're holding the disc in place
1589000	1591000	There is a replacement program in place right now
1591000	1593000	For both the essentials disc
1593000	1595000	And the normal game disc
1595000	1597000	And also on top of all that
1597000	1599000	The whole red ring of death thing
1599000	1601000	Could it possibly be
1601000	1603000	This is kind of a stretch for me
1603000	1605000	Could it be possibly that you're playing it for so many hours straight
1605000	1607000	That the console is overheating because of that
1607000	1609000	Because it's poorly ventilated
1609000	1611000	I think that's what the red ring of death would be caused by
1611000	1613000	In fact, I mean
1613000	1615000	It's because of a chip overheating
1615000	1617000	It's not because of
1617000	1619000	A disc read error is not going to cause your chip all of a sudden to explode
1619000	1621000	No, it's
1621000	1623000	It's Bill Gates' fault, obviously
1623000	1625000	Right?
1625000	1627000	Obviously
1627000	1629000	Because he did it himself
1629000	1631000	That's right
1631000	1633000	Because he went out there with a
1633000	1635000	With a knife
1635000	1637000	An X-Acto knife
1637000	1639000	To kind of draw a parallel here
1639000	1641000	I would say, for example
1641000	1643000	Let's just say
1643000	1645000	This is about as ridiculous as saying
1645000	1647000	Okay, if there was a certain car that had problems with their tires popping
1647000	1649000	Or something like that
1649000	1651000	Now there's a rumor going around
1651000	1653000	Saying that if you insert a certain CD into your CD player
1653000	1655000	That your tire is going to explode
1655000	1657000	I mean, that's about how ridiculous it is
1657000	1659000	Interesting comments from chat
1659000	1661000	Wiedu says
1661000	1663000	Not so in New Zealand, Loki
1663000	1665000	My store's limited editions were all scratched
1665000	1667000	Pika Uno says
1667000	1669000	All Japanese editions had foam inserts
1669000	1671000	That's a good idea
1671000	1673000	Because they package games better there
1673000	1675000	Yeah, they do package games a little better there
1675000	1677000	They should also
1677000	1679000	You know what they should do?
1679000	1681000	They should have cases that have rose petals and daisies inside them
1681000	1683000	Well, it was stupid
1683000	1685000	They had these little hubs on there
1685000	1687000	Kind of locking ones
1687000	1689000	That they'd have in normal DVD cases
1689000	1691000	So yeah, some did fuck up
1691000	1693000	And it's stupid
1693000	1695000	Luckily, mine was not scratched
1695000	1697000	Alright
1697000	1699000	Well, good for you Loki
1699000	1701000	Not having a scratched Halo 3 game
1701000	1703000	Ours wasn't scratched either
1703000	1705000	I bought the regular one
1705000	1707000	I walked in the day
1707000	1709000	After the midnight sale
1709000	1711000	I walked in the next day
1711000	1713000	I walked right into Fry's
1713000	1715000	Looking out Master Chief's ass
1715000	1717000	I mean, there were so many games
1717000	1719000	I was just like, oh, pick one up
1719000	1721000	That was it
1721000	1723000	Well, speaking of Master Chief's ass
1723000	1725000	You should check out this charity
1725000	1727000	Halo 3 action figure of the Master Chief
1727000	1729000	It's very chickly
1729000	1731000	There is
1731000	1733000	It's an 11.5 inch figure
1733000	1735000	Right now going for $241
1735000	1737000	It only has
1737000	1739000	3 bids on it at the time of this article
1739000	1741000	But they are donating
1741000	1743000	10% of the profits to the
1743000	1745000	American Breast Cancer Foundation
1745000	1747000	And it's
1747000	1749000	Master Chief is a very hot chick
1749000	1751000	Mistress Chief
1751000	1753000	Mistress Chief
1753000	1755000	You know, Ms. Chief if you're nasty
1755000	1757000	I don't know
1757000	1759000	I don't know, it looks stupid to me
1759000	1761000	It looks like someone took
1761000	1763000	Like a fucking figure
1763000	1765000	For like Witchblade and stuck the Master Chief
1765000	1767000	Helmet on it
1767000	1769000	I mean, that's seriously what it looks like
1769000	1771000	I'm not really interested to figure either
1771000	1773000	And as the comments to the story
1773000	1775000	Even kind of
1775000	1777000	They're like, okay, seriously though
1777000	1779000	There's no body armor
1779000	1781000	I mean, you could just like
1781000	1783000	Shoot her in the boobs and she'd keel over
1783000	1785000	Does she have her ass cheeks?
1785000	1787000	Does it have the assless
1787000	1789000	Suit on it?
1789000	1791000	Hmm
1791000	1793000	It looks kind of retarded
1793000	1795000	The hell game have you people been playing?
1795000	1797000	Can't you set your character as a female
1797000	1799000	Yeah, but she doesn't look like that
1799000	1801000	Yeah, and it changes nothing
1801000	1803000	Of course, it's body armor
1803000	1805000	It's unisex body armor
1805000	1807000	That's right
1807000	1809000	Hey, do we remember text
1809000	1811000	In Red vs. Blue?
1811000	1813000	I don't really watch it
1813000	1815000	I don't watch it
1815000	1817000	I don't get Halo jokes
1817000	1819000	Why don't you watch everything that's great?
1819000	1821000	I know, why can't I be like everybody else?
1821000	1823000	Seriously
1823000	1825000	God, anyways
1825000	1827000	Why can't I be a robot instead of an alien?
1827000	1829000	Hero's joke, by the way
1829000	1831000	Hope you all saw it
1831000	1833000	Someone save this show please
1833000	1835000	This is the first episode
1835000	1837000	Of the new season
1837000	1839000	Anyways, so
1839000	1841000	This is a complete shocker
1841000	1843000	There's going to be some new bundles
1843000	1845000	Coming for the Xbox 360
1845000	1847000	And of course this is kind of
1847000	1849000	Very similar to the same thing that
1849000	1851000	I believe was announced for the UK
1851000	1853000	Where they were going to be getting a bundle
1853000	1855000	Including Forza 2
1855000	1857000	And Marvel Ultimate Alliance
1857000	1859000	This is going to be for both the premium system
1859000	1861000	And for the elite system
1861000	1863000	And both of those systems will be still
1863000	1865000	The same price as they are now
1865000	1867000	Just to get two free games
1867000	1869000	Hooray
1869000	1871000	Then, of course
1871000	1873000	The other new bit of info
1873000	1875000	Is that the core system is going to be discontinued
1875000	1877000	And in its place
1877000	1879000	Is going to be the Xbox 360
1879000	1881000	Arcade SKU
1881000	1885000	It's going to have a 256 megabyte memory card
1885000	1889000	A disk with five Xbox Live arcade games
1889000	1891000	Including Boom Boom Rocket, Pac-Man
1891000	1895000	Uno, Feeding Frenzy, and Luxor 2
1895000	1899000	And it's going to have an HDMI out on it as well
1899000	1901000	With a wireless controller
1901000	1903000	All for $279.99
1903000	1905000	Which I think is
1905000	1907000	Good that they're getting rid of the core
1907000	1909000	Because I know a big complaint
1909000	1911000	I always hear is
1911000	1913000	Why would you get the core system you can't save your game?
1913000	1915000	So now you can
1915000	1917000	Because you buy the core and then you buy a hard drive
1917000	1919000	But at least this way you don't have to
1919000	1921000	Right out of the box you can save your game
1921000	1923000	I just think that because
1923000	1925000	When I got my Xbox 360
1925000	1927000	That's what I had to do
1927000	1929000	I bought a core and then bought a hard drive
1929000	1931000	Because you couldn't get Xbox 360s
1931000	1933000	Like anywhere when they first came out
1933000	1935000	Remember that? They were like Wii's
1935000	1937000	A couple years ago you couldn't get them anywhere
1937000	1941000	And of course this is just a rumor right now
1941000	1945000	Well yeah but you know what we say about Microsoft rumors
1945000	1947000	They're always true
1947000	1949000	Pretty much
1949000	1951000	All the time unless somebody completely pulls it out of their butt
1951000	1953000	But usually you know
1953000	1957000	Usually there's any sense of legitimacy to it whatsoever
1957000	1959000	I'm going to go on a limb here and say back
1959000	1961000	About a month ago when they showed that whole
1961000	1963000	UK rumor
1963000	1965000	They actually had pictures to go along with it
1965000	1967000	And I've seen pictures to go along with this stuff
1967000	1969000	So I'm going to take a wild guess
1969000	1971000	And say that
1971000	1973000	I think this is actually going to happen
1973000	1975000	Alright well
1975000	1977000	Back in the 80s we had Pac-Man fever
1977000	1979000	So this week we had Halo fever
1979000	1981000	Because Halo is huge
1981000	1983000	And a news story out of Seattle
1983000	1985000	There was a high school student who was on TV
1985000	1987000	He was on the TV going
1987000	1989000	Look ma I got Halo 3
1989000	1991000	And I'm standing here with Bill Gates
1991000	1993000	His name was Ritesh David
1993000	1995000	Ritesh David
1995000	1997000	And he was buying the very first copy of Halo 3
1997000	1999000	At a Bellevue Best Buy store
1999000	2001000	And shaking hands with Bill Gates
2001000	2003000	And this all went down of course early Tuesday morning
2003000	2005000	Bill Gates autographed David's copy of the new game
2005000	2007000	Pretty awesome
2007000	2009000	David's parents actually called the school
2009000	2011000	And said he was ill that day
2011000	2013000	And then here he is on the TV
2013000	2015000	Hi here I am
2015000	2017000	Somebody got caught
2017000	2019000	Also if you wanted to also draw
2019000	2021000	Straws a little bit more
2021000	2023000	He was either 18 or 17
2023000	2025000	Well no not if he was nice
2025000	2027000	Well get this
2027000	2029000	Did he get carded for the damn game?
2029000	2031000	Well no because M is 17
2031000	2033000	So he's probably okay
2033000	2035000	It didn't say if he was a senior
2035000	2037000	Or what we'll assume he's a senior
2037000	2039000	Alright but he told the radio station
2039000	2041000	KIRO that he was being
2041000	2043000	Feared that he would be put in detention
2043000	2045000	Or that other students would taunt him
2045000	2047000	Or whatever and he has no regrets about
2047000	2049000	Halo fever and says that meeting Bill Gates
2049000	2051000	Was the greatest moment of his life
2051000	2053000	And I find that kind of shocking
2053000	2055000	That the school did not bust him
2055000	2057000	And that the parents called him sick
2057000	2059000	For him with this whole Halo 3
2059000	2061000	I mean wasn't it kind of
2061000	2063000	You know what
2063000	2065000	Is this kind of messed up
2065000	2067000	When I was in school all I had to do to get out
2067000	2069000	Was like if it was a family function
2069000	2071000	Or something important I had to go to
2071000	2073000	All the parents had to do was just say
2073000	2075000	Um she could go to school today
2075000	2077000	So why did they have to lie?
2077000	2079000	He should be publicly spanked
2079000	2081000	Naughty naughty naughty
2081000	2083000	Caning
2083000	2085000	In Singapore
2085000	2087000	Hey your BFF Bobby Blackwolf
2087000	2089000	Is in chat Loki
2089000	2091000	I believe Bobby was there
2091000	2093000	From when I was reading in his LJ
2093000	2095000	I don't know if I have it all together
2095000	2097000	Blackwolf says he was not the first person in line
2097000	2099000	He was the first person who was of age
2099000	2101000	There were two people in front of him
2101000	2103000	That were underage
2103000	2105000	They were skipped
2105000	2107000	So then he was of age
2107000	2109000	Then what's the big deal
2109000	2111000	Why is his parents calling for him
2111000	2113000	He's over 18
2113000	2115000	I remember when I was in high school
2115000	2117000	You could check yourself out because you're of age
2117000	2119000	Oh wait
2119000	2121000	He might be 17
2121000	2123000	I think he should be disciplined
2123000	2125000	You should not be skipping school for a video game
2125000	2127000	Not that I ever did that when Final Fantasy 7
2127000	2129000	First came out or anything
2129000	2131000	But I should have been spanked for doing that
2131000	2133000	It was very naughty
2133000	2135000	Sometimes
2135000	2137000	I can tell you right now
2137000	2139000	Probably skipping work when Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out
2139000	2141000	Naughty naughty
2141000	2143000	Whatever
2143000	2145000	Jamie, surely there must be a
2145000	2147000	Disciplinarian inside of you that thinks
2147000	2149000	There's something wrong with this picture
2149000	2151000	That he's not getting in trouble
2151000	2153000	Or his parents are not being mocked openly
2153000	2155000	For basically lying for him
2155000	2157000	For this Halo 3
2157000	2159000	I don't think that there was a necessity to lie
2159000	2161000	But at the same time
2161000	2163000	It's their choice in how they raise him
2163000	2165000	So
2165000	2167000	Anything that comes back on him
2167000	2169000	Is their fault
2169000	2171000	That's how I see it
2171000	2173000	It's the parents choice
2173000	2175000	So he stayed up past his bedtime
2175000	2177000	God damn
2177000	2179000	No dessert for a week
2179000	2181000	He needs to suck it up though and still go to school the next day
2181000	2183000	So what if you're tired
2183000	2185000	Suck it up, come on
2185000	2187000	That's right, I've done that
2187000	2189000	Now I've had those late night games
2189000	2191000	When I first came out on the Super Nintendo
2191000	2193000	I must have stayed up until 2 AM in the morning
2193000	2195000	Playing that game
2195000	2197000	And then I had to go in to like band the next morning
2197000	2199000	I was so tired
2199000	2201000	I did take a week off the school to play Final Fantasy 3
2201000	2203000	Cause was my mom
2203000	2205000	Was my mom gonna call the school and say I was sick
2205000	2207000	Cause I was playing video games too late
2207000	2209000	She'd say, hell no, you did this
2209000	2211000	You still gotta go to school and you just suffer
2211000	2213000	Anyway
2213000	2215000	Moving on
2215000	2217000	Too much time on this story
2217000	2219000	Yep
2219000	2221000	Alright
2221000	2223000	Well
2223000	2225000	For anyone who was curious as to the details behind
2225000	2227000	Bizarre
2227000	2229000	And Activision
2229000	2231000	Basically
2231000	2233000	It was actually
2233000	2235000	quoted by their
2235000	2237000	commercial director saying that they were
2237000	2239000	trying to find a long term
2239000	2241000	partner association
2241000	2243000	that they wanted to
2243000	2245000	work on just making good games
2245000	2247000	and not have to deal with
2247000	2249000	the development side
2249000	2251000	of everything so that's why they brought them in
2251000	2253000	They made hot sweet
2253000	2255000	love
2255000	2257000	Yes they did and hopefully we'll get a nice baby out of it
2257000	2259000	What's that? Activision's
2259000	2261000	been buying people up lately cause they did the whole
2261000	2263000	They took over Guitar Hero
2263000	2265000	too
2265000	2267000	Remember?
2267000	2269000	Activision's got money
2269000	2271000	They bought Red Octane
2271000	2273000	Well sorta
2273000	2275000	No they bought them, they acquired them
2275000	2277000	Well right now though as far as any
2277000	2279000	upcoming releases the only thing
2279000	2281000	really titled right now
2281000	2283000	is that Bizarre has
2283000	2285000	Project Gotham Racing 4
2285000	2287000	They also have the club coming
2287000	2289000	out from Sega so that's gonna be
2289000	2291000	the last game that Bizarre's doing
2291000	2293000	If you count I guess
2293000	2295000	Geometry Wars Galaxies which is also being
2295000	2297000	released by Sega as well
2297000	2299000	So after all those
2299000	2301000	What happens to Project Gotham 5?
2301000	2303000	Well it will be probably put out
2303000	2305000	by Activision or
2305000	2307000	Does that mean it's gonna be multi console?
2307000	2309000	PlayStation 3, Project Gotham 5
2309000	2311000	How can this be?
2311000	2313000	I don't know
2313000	2315000	Or Project Gotham 5
2315000	2317000	will be developed by another studio
2317000	2319000	You know
2319000	2321000	Much like Guitar Hero
2321000	2323000	now is being developed by
2323000	2325000	someone else as well
2325000	2327000	Anyways
2327000	2329000	Something kinda cool
2329000	2331000	Tetris Splash is coming to
2331000	2333000	Xbox Live Arcade
2333000	2335000	and
2335000	2337000	Apparently
2337000	2339000	It's gonna be Tetris all over again
2339000	2341000	Hurrah because if you didn't get your fill
2341000	2343000	What was it? Tetris
2343000	2345000	Not Grandmaster
2345000	2347000	Well the last Tetris game that came out
2347000	2349000	Evolution, whatever the fuck it was called
2349000	2351000	Well it will play on
2351000	2353000	Live and it will feature
2353000	2355000	4 players offline
2355000	2357000	6 players over Live
2357000	2359000	and lots of blocks
2359000	2361000	in multicolors
2361000	2363000	and apparently a very creepy
2363000	2365000	woman announcer
2365000	2367000	Hurrah for creepy women
2367000	2369000	announcers. Boo for the fact I already
2369000	2371000	bought Tetris on the Xbox 360
2371000	2373000	and probably paid way more
2373000	2375000	for it than I should have but I guess that's my own damn
2375000	2377000	fault. I bought that. What was that Tetris
2377000	2379000	game called that was the disc version?
2379000	2381000	I don't know. Obviously it wasn't
2381000	2383000	memorable. Yet another Tetris game now on
2383000	2385000	360 is what it's called now
2385000	2387000	I mean
2387000	2389000	Tetris and Pac-Man
2389000	2391000	seriously stop making
2391000	2393000	new games or just re-releasing
2393000	2395000	your old games I guess
2395000	2397000	Going to the chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com
2397000	2399000	Bobby to the rescue again
2399000	2401000	with the answer about what happens to Project
2401000	2403000	Gotham 5. In fact you could say
2403000	2405000	he just owned me. I don't know
2405000	2407000	Project Gotham Racing 5 is put out by Microsoft
2407000	2409000	Game Studios. It's a Microsoft
2409000	2411000	property. They're moving it to another
2411000	2413000	developer within Microsoft Game Studios
2413000	2415000	So like I said they're moving it to
2415000	2417000	another developer much like Guitar
2417000	2419000	Hero 3 moved to a different developer
2419000	2421000	I said I got owned not you got
2421000	2423000	owned. Oh. Yeah
2423000	2425000	Yes you did. I did
2425000	2427000	That's alright. I don't play Project Gotham Racing
2427000	2429000	anyway. It's too too confusing
2429000	2431000	I like burnout. It's too sim-like
2431000	2433000	No it's just that you know the
2433000	2435000	racing games are a little different. The cars handled it
2435000	2437000	I crash into walls in Project Gotham Racing
2437000	2439000	more than any other game I play. You need to pick up flat out
2439000	2441000	Ultimate Carnage next week. I don't think about it
2441000	2443000	I'm serious. It's awesome. Play the demos
2443000	2445000	over and over and over again. Oh we'll see
2445000	2447000	Are you on their payroll?
2447000	2449000	No it's awesome. I'm talking about GameTap
2449000	2451000	Seriously. I love
2451000	2453000	the game because I played
2453000	2455000	the original flat out over
2455000	2457000	and over and over again. Playing
2457000	2459000	the ragdoll mode in it where you can just
2459000	2461000	launch the driver through the windshield
2461000	2463000	and do the high jump and stuff
2463000	2465000	I don't know. I just I like
2465000	2467000	breaking stuff and launching
2467000	2469000	drivers through windows and watching
2469000	2471000	them get hurt. Why? Same reason
2471000	2473000	I'm playing Jackass. Yeah I know it's this
2473000	2475000	theme here. You enjoy Jackass the game
2475000	2477000	you enjoy launching people through windows
2477000	2479000	I seem to remember there's that Playstation Network
2479000	2481000	game that's like a crazy guy that
2481000	2483000	does what was that called? Pain? Best
2483000	2485000	Pain or whatever? Yeah. That you were all giddy about
2485000	2487000	so you chuckle. You chuckle
2487000	2489000	like a little kid who's setting fire to things in the
2489000	2491000	back of the class. If only they had
2491000	2493000	that game
2493000	2495000	Back of the
2495000	2497000	Classroom Pyro the game coming to
2497000	2499000	Xbox Network game.
2501000	2503000	One game I enjoyed quite
2503000	2505000	a bit more than the average person and I'm not
2505000	2507000	sure why maybe just because I like Japanese
2507000	2509000	role playing games or maybe I have such
2509000	2511000	a boner for Chrono Trigger that I was able to
2511000	2513000	look past the fact that the game you know
2513000	2515000	wasn't the greatest RPG of all time but
2515000	2517000	it wasn't bad either. Blue Dragon
2517000	2519000	and one thing
2519000	2521000	that you know I was one of the negatives
2521000	2523000	I was saying about Blue Dragon is it's kind of easy
2523000	2525000	I mean if you just take the time to level
2525000	2527000	up in the very beginning of the game you're always
2527000	2529000	two steps ahead of the enemies and only
2529000	2531000	the boss fights really proved to be difficult
2531000	2533000	well guess what? Blue
2533000	2535000	Dragon has come out and said you don't think the game
2535000	2537000	is hard enough? Here's some
2537000	2539000	free download content
2539000	2541000	that will up the difficulty of the game.
2541000	2543000	You don't think the hard is game enough?
2543000	2545000	Don't worry.
2545000	2547000	What? We got covered you.
2547000	2549000	You're about to say that.
2549000	2551000	I was just
2551000	2553000	showing my translation skills
2553000	2555000	from the Japanese text original.
2555000	2557000	The ultra
2557000	2559000	hard mod gives three new
2559000	2561000	aspects to the game. New game
2561000	2563000	plus or game plus which is like
2563000	2565000	gee they had this in Chrono Trigger.
2565000	2567000	You just start the game over again with all the
2567000	2569000	stats that you had when you last ended.
2569000	2571000	But there's also now hard mode which is
2571000	2573000	twice as challenging as the normal
2573000	2575000	so I guess that means all the enemies do
2575000	2577000	twice as much damage, have twice as much
2577000	2579000	HP and impossible
2579000	2581000	impossible mode is meant
2581000	2583000	to be played with characters starting
2583000	2585000	at level 50 or higher.
2585000	2587000	So needless to say you don't want to start this
2587000	2589000	with characters that are level 1.
2589000	2591000	No word yet though if you get anything
2591000	2593000	for beating it. I would think that you should get
2593000	2595000	a special achievement or you know
2595000	2597000	a little bonus
2597000	2599000	clip or movie or something for beating
2599000	2601000	it on one of these ultra hard modes. But nope
2601000	2603000	you just get the satisfaction of
2603000	2605000	knowing you're better than everybody else at a game no one
2605000	2607000	seems to care about.
2607000	2609000	So congratulations to you.
2609000	2611000	Don't play a hard game player at Defense Force 2017.
2611000	2613000	I will say though I'm thankful
2613000	2615000	that Microsoft is putting out
2615000	2617000	or I guess I should say Microsoft because
2617000	2619000	the devs charge this. Microsoft is putting out.
2619000	2621000	Yeah Microsoft is putting out quite well
2621000	2623000	but no the developers and Mistwalker
2623000	2625000	and everybody is putting out the game
2625000	2627000	or they're putting out the content for
2627000	2629000	free. Actually I believe Microsoft
2629000	2631000	did publish it themselves. Mistwalker just developed it.
2631000	2633000	So they did decide to
2633000	2635000	charge nothing for it. So hooray for
2635000	2637000	Microsoft. Thank you for putting out.
2637000	2639000	Yes we like it when they put out.
2639000	2641000	Speaking of putting out
2641000	2643000	for the
2643000	2645000	most recent
2645000	2647000	offering from Capcom
2647000	2649000	and the Super Street Fighter 2 series
2649000	2651000	you know Turbo Remix
2651000	2653000	for matching service dot com
2653000	2655000	you know 4chan
2655000	2657000	edition
2657000	2659000	they are having
2659000	2661000	two characters confirmed
2661000	2663000	will be Cammy and M. Bison
2663000	2665000	who in the Japanese version
2665000	2667000	is Vega.
2667000	2669000	Well that's supposed to be all the same people
2669000	2671000	they're just making them all pretty.
2671000	2673000	They
2673000	2675000	do look very high def-ey.
2675000	2677000	There's some pictures on here.
2677000	2679000	Cammy with her humongous thighs.
2679000	2681000	Well people are saying her humongous
2681000	2683000	camel toe but
2683000	2685000	well that's always been Cammy.
2685000	2687000	But yeah.
2687000	2689000	Go Cammy.
2689000	2691000	Is that where she got
2691000	2693000	her name from?
2693000	2695000	I don't know.
2695000	2697000	But if you can't wait for
2697000	2699000	Super Street Fighter 2 HD
2699000	2701000	Remix
2701000	2703000	you can possibly find some
2703000	2705000	other fun games at your
2705000	2707000	local stores this week.
2707000	2709000	Including if you happen to be a fan
2709000	2711000	of basketball games

2713000	2715000	with both

2719000	2721000	and NBA 08 coming out this week
2721000	2723000	on the 2nd of October.
2723000	2725000	And of course Live
2725000	2727000	and 2K will both be on
2727000	2729000	Playstation 2, Playstation 3
2729000	2731000	the 360 and then of course Live
2731000	2733000	being on the Wii
2733000	2735000	making it the first basketball game appearance.
2735000	2737000	And of course
2737000	2739000	on the PSP as well.
2739000	2741000	And then let's see here
2741000	2743000	if you're not a fan of
2743000	2745000	basketball games then maybe you're a fan of some of the
2745000	2747000	other games from VIMVITY
2747000	2749000	including Crash of the Titans
2749000	2751000	and Spyro
2751000	2753000	or Legend of Spyro
2753000	2755000	The Eternal Night
2755000	2757000	and those are supposed to be coming out on
2757000	2759000	Playstation 2 for both and then of course
2759000	2761000	on Crash
2761000	2763000	Xbox 360
2763000	2765000	and the Wii
2765000	2767000	DS and
2767000	2769000	Game Boy Advance.
2769000	2771000	Then on PSP
2771000	2773000	a kind of crappy rip-off
2773000	2775000	of WarioWare
2775000	2777000	Hot Pixel is coming to
2777000	2779000	that system on the 2nd.
2779000	2781000	What's funny though is when they
2781000	2783000	released it over here they decided to spell out
2783000	2785000	pixel P-I-X-E-L
2785000	2787000	instead of just the PXL
2787000	2789000	as it was in other regions.
2789000	2791000	On
2791000	2793000	also most systems
2793000	2795000	Spiderman Friend or Foe
2795000	2797000	is coming out. Looks a little bit better
2797000	2799000	than Spiderman 3 and that's
2799000	2801000	going to be on Playstation 2
2801000	2803000	Playstation 3, 360, Wii
2803000	2805000	and some of the handhelds.
2805000	2807000	And let's see here
2807000	2809000	also MLB
2809000	2811000	Power Pros coming to
2811000	2813000	Playstation 2 on the Wii.
2813000	2815000	That looks kind of neat.
2815000	2817000	Also on the DS, Jackass the Game
2817000	2819000	should be coming out this week.
2819000	2821000	And on PSP
2821000	2823000	Syphon Filter. Do I want to know how to use
2823000	2825000	the touch screen in Jackass the Game
2825000	2827000	because that sounds kind of scary. I don't know but
2827000	2829000	it'll be interesting.
2829000	2831000	And then some smaller games here
2831000	2833000	maybe not a smaller game but Legend of Zelda
2833000	2835000	Phantom Hourglass is coming out this week.
2835000	2837000	And it actually might already be out
2837000	2839000	if you happen to be at the Nintendo World Store.
2839000	2841000	Other
2841000	2843000	stuff coming out on the Wii this week
2843000	2845000	Dave Mirra's BMX Challenge
2845000	2847000	which is crap.
2847000	2849000	And then of course the DS
2849000	2851000	also has Race Driver, Create and Race.
2851000	2853000	Kuru,
2853000	2855000	Poto, Cool Cool
2855000	2857000	Stars.
2857000	2859000	Krale the Treasure Adventures.
2859000	2861000	Arctic Tale. All which sound
2861000	2863000	kind of crappy.
2863000	2865000	Let's see here. Backyard Football
2865000	2867000	08. Master
2867000	2869000	Jinjin's IQ Challenge. Paws
2869000	2871000	and Claws. Dogs and Cats.
2871000	2873000	And then on the PC
2873000	2875000	of course all sorts of random
2875000	2877000	stuff including a brand new
2877000	2879000	Tycoon game because
2879000	2881000	what would it be without
2881000	2883000	a new Tycoon game almost every single
2883000	2885000	week? Rock Tour
2885000	2887000	Tycoon. Man
2887000	2889000	they're really drawn in straws now.
2889000	2891000	Scraping
2891000	2893000	the bottom of the barrel.
2893000	2895000	Sounds like fun.
2895000	2897000	Oh and flat out Ultimate Carnage on
2897000	2899000	Xbox 360 as I mentioned earlier.
2899000	2901000	Nintendo Maniac 64 says I want to see
2901000	2903000	Jackass Wii where you throw Wii
2903000	2905000	motes. Like maybe it just puts a
2905000	2907000	big target on your TV and you're encouraged to destroy it.
2907000	2909000	They've got some weird little games
2909000	2911000	in that. One of them is
2911000	2913000	the Elephant Pooh
2913000	2915000	Dive where you're diving off of a
2915000	2917000	skyscraper into a big bucket
2917000	2919000	of Elephant Pooh and then
2919000	2921000	they've got another one where
2921000	2923000	you're rolling down a
2923000	2925000	ski slope
2925000	2927000	kind of like Katamari and you're rolling
2927000	2929000	over things. They've got a bunch
2929000	2931000	of fun stuff in there. Definitely worth
2931000	2933000	a rental at least. And it's
2933000	2935000	cheap.
2935000	2937000	Well
2937000	2939000	moving on
2939000	2941000	going to the Japanese release
2941000	2943000	dates. Not a huge week in Japan
2943000	2945000	but if you've been sitting around
2945000	2947000	in Japan you've been going god damn
2947000	2949000	I want a new Dragon Ball Z
2949000	2951000	fighting game. I mean there's just
2951000	2953000	not enough Dragon Ball Z fighting games
2953000	2955000	out there on the market. Well shit you're
2955000	2957000	in luck this week because on the Nintendo Wii
2957000	2959000	Dragon Ball Z Sparkling
2959000	2961000	Meteor is coming out on the
2961000	2963000	Nintendo Wii. I believe that's on the PlayStation
2963000	2965000	too as well.
2965000	2967000	Thank god that those don't come over
2967000	2969000	at the same subtitles.
2969000	2971000	You know actually I should say this though.
2971000	2973000	Back in the day there used to be this
2973000	2975000	you know blockbuster type store but it was a
2975000	2977000	Ma and Pa store that rented video games. But they
2977000	2979000	rented import video games with a little
2979000	2981000	converter. The first Japanese video game
2981000	2983000	I ever rented was a Dragon Ball Z fighting
2983000	2985000	game on the Super Nintendo.
2985000	2987000	It was fun too because at the time we was like
2987000	2989000	oh cool this is from Japan. I don't understand
2989000	2991000	anything. You know if you're not part of the solution.
2991000	2993000	I still got the old Super Nintendo.
2993000	2995000	Oh the old Famicom? You got the Famicom?
2995000	2997000	Super Famicom. Really? Yeah. Rad. Anyhow
2997000	2999000	sorry back to Japanese release dates. On the
2999000	3001000	PlayStation 2, Bakumatsu Renka
3001000	3003000	Karyu Kenshiden is coming out.
3003000	3005000	An action game
3005000	3007000	that is probably based on an anime.
3007000	3009000	For you Bamani fans
3009000	3011000	Guitar Freaks V3 and
3011000	3013000	Drummania V3 are out in
3013000	3015000	Japan. And see I don't think they have
3015000	3017000	Guitar Hero over there and I don't think they're
3017000	3019000	getting Rock Band. So this is
3019000	3021000	what you get in Japan instead. You get
3021000	3023000	Guitar Freaks and Drummania.
3023000	3025000	Of which I have not played
3025000	3027000	V3 or V4 in the arcades
3027000	3029000	at all. I played V2.
3029000	3031000	Which was pretty much the same game.
3031000	3033000	If you will, imagine V2
3033000	3035000	but instead of a 2 there's a 4
3035000	3037000	there and you'll be pretty damn
3037000	3039000	close. Alright, alright. Fair enough.
3039000	3041000	Smartass. What if there's good
3041000	3043000	songs though? I mean you know those games
3043000	3045000	are only as good as the songs or whatever.
3045000	3047000	Forget it. Yeah. A chibi
3047000	3049000	little baseball game on the PlayStation 2
3049000	3051000	called Jikoyu Powerful
3051000	3053000	Pro Major League 2 is coming
3053000	3055000	out. It looks like if the cast of
3055000	3057000	worms start in a baseball game
3057000	3059000	that's what you get. That's MLB
3059000	3061000	Power Pros over here. Oh really?
3061000	3063000	Alright, well that shows you how much I follow
3063000	3065000	baseball games. The Crimson and Black
3065000	3067000	DS makes its way to Japan this week.
3067000	3069000	Take a look at that. Also on the Nintendo
3069000	3071000	DS. It ain't Cookin' Mama
3071000	3073000	but it's kind of close. Koharu
3073000	3075000	no DS Ushigohan
3075000	3077000	Shokuji Balance Guide
3077000	3079000	Suki. And this
3079000	3081000	what the hell do you do? It looks like a game
3081000	3083000	where you put in what you've been eating
3083000	3085000	like it shows you little pictures
3085000	3087000	of food. Yeah and it shows you
3087000	3089000	like how many grams of fat
3089000	3091000	and how many Kcals you're eating
3091000	3093000	and all that good stuff. Another thing
3093000	3095000	real quick. I think that's the smart
3095000	3097000	idea to bring something like that out over here.
3097000	3099000	There's enough people
3099000	3101000	that own DS's that would be interested in that.
3101000	3103000	That Crimson and Black DS
3103000	3105000	ain't only coming out in Japan.
3105000	3107000	Oh really?
3107000	3109000	Where else are they going to see it? Over here.
3109000	3111000	Well it's already out over here.
3111000	3113000	Well it's out over here in that bundle
3113000	3115000	but it's going to be sold by itself.
3115000	3117000	Which I mean come on
3117000	3119000	man it's just
3119000	3121000	black and red I mean really
3121000	3123000	DNA. But it's two colors! Oh my
3123000	3125000	god! Well then they should be twice
3125000	3127000	the price then obviously. Can I finish release
3127000	3129000	dates please? Sure. Thank you.
3129000	3131000	On the PSP Gundam Battle Chronicle
3131000	3133000	on the PSP
3133000	3135000	Mina no Golf Ba Vol. 3
3135000	3137000	which I believe isn't that just their hotshots
3137000	3139000	over there? Yeah. And then
3139000	3141000	Shin Sangoku Mosu
3141000	3143000	Dynasty Warriors goes into
3143000	3145000	the best hits on the PSP.
3145000	3147000	So if you're a fan of Dynasty Warriors
3147000	3149000	price cut enjoy that. That's your Japanese
3149000	3151000	release dates. Horribly butchered
3151000	3153000	pronunciations courtesy of me.
3153000	3155000	How about Europe?
3155000	3157000	Well there is some
3157000	3159000	well a little fun.
3159000	3161000	There's an hour of victory on
3161000	3163000	PC NBA 08
3163000	3165000	hour of victory comes out on the first
3165000	3167000	NBA 08 comes out on the second.
3167000	3169000	A bunch of stuff for the fifth there's
3169000	3171000	Creed 2 Liberation, Cookie
3171000	3173000	and Cream on DS
3173000	3175000	CSI 3 Dimensions of Murder
3175000	3177000	and then CSI Hard Evidence
3177000	3179000	on PC and Xbox 360
3179000	3181000	Dead and Furious on DS
3181000	3183000	Deadhead Fred on PSP
3183000	3185000	Final Fantasy Tactics The War of Lions
3185000	3187000	on PSP, Glory Days 2
3187000	3189000	Brotherhood of Men
3189000	3191000	NFL 08 and Tiger Woods PGA Tour
3191000	3193000	08
3193000	3195000	Great.
3195000	3197000	Alright.
3197000	3199000	Well let's see here we talked
3199000	3201000	about some 360
3201000	3203000	rumors that will probably come
3203000	3205000	true. Let's talk about some
3205000	3207000	PlayStation 3 rumors
3207000	3209000	which will also probably come true.
3209000	3211000	One of which is going to be that the
3211000	3213000	FCC has filed a
3213000	3215000	or had a filing for a brand
3215000	3217000	new PlayStation 3 model
3217000	3219000	and no word
3219000	3221000	on what it is yet but
3221000	3223000	most likely it's going to be that
3223000	3225000	40 gig system that just
3225000	3227000	that rumor won't die that one
3227000	3229000	is supposed to be coming out for
3229000	3231000	$399 or $299 depending on
3231000	3233000	who you're talking to
3233000	3235000	and apparently the
3235000	3237000	specifications for it so far it will have
3237000	3239000	Wi-Fi obviously it's going to have Bluetooth
3239000	3241000	etc. and they're identical
3241000	3243000	to the other PlayStation 3 models right
3243000	3245000	now so you know it's not going to
3245000	3247000	be like 20 gig system where it doesn't have
3247000	3249000	any Wi-Fi
3249000	3251000	or stuff like that but
3251000	3253000	still though
3253000	3255000	it's coming whether
3255000	3257000	Sony you know
3257000	3259000	admits to it or not it will be coming
3259000	3261000	soon. I bet you that you're going to
3261000	3263000	get an announcement probably any
3263000	3265000	day.
3265000	3267000	Good times.
3267000	3269000	In fact I was going to say there was
3269000	3271000	some other story that was also
3271000	3273000	kind of coinciding with the same thing
3273000	3275000	where they had one of those
3275000	3277000	it was the
3277000	3279000	Blu-ray deals
3279000	3281000	that they have going on right now for the PlayStation 3
3281000	3283000	where you buy the system
3283000	3285000	and get five Blu-ray movies. Well that
3285000	3287000	also had the same new
3287000	3289000	SKU number on there as well. So
3289000	3291000	that at least confirms that there will be a new
3291000	3293000	SKU whether it be a 48
3293000	3295000	system or God knows whether
3295000	3297000	size hard drive they're going to throw in with it
3297000	3299000	there is a new SKU coming.
3299000	3301000	Hmm
3301000	3303000	Alright.
3303000	3305000	Well, Kazurai has
3305000	3307000	commented recently on the PlayStation 3
3307000	3309000	saying the PlayStation original
3309000	3311000	price was just right. Nah nah nah
3311000	3313000	I have no regrets about releasing
3313000	3315000	this for such a high cost even if everybody
3315000	3317000	seems to have a problem with it. Well then you have
3317000	3319000	no regrets for nobody buying
3319000	3321000	it. Okay hold on that's not exactly
3321000	3323000	what he said. Okay here's a quote
3323000	3325000	quote the PS3 has been on the market less than a year
3325000	3327000	in the US and Japan and what is it less than that
3327000	3329000	in Europe? I love
3329000	3331000	that because it doesn't even know. It's difficult
3331000	3333000	right now to say who's where. Clearly
3333000	3335000	we've never started from a position of strength
3335000	3337000	and we've always had to catch up with any generation
3337000	3339000	of hardware that we've brought into the market.
3339000	3341000	You know interesting point that I think back to
3341000	3343000	the PlayStation 1 and that is kind of true
3343000	3345000	what he's saying. But I seem to
3345000	3347000	recall with the PlayStation 2 they were
3347000	3349000	kind of the big deal right
3349000	3351000	out the gate. I don't think they ever really
3351000	3353000	I mean I don't know maybe
3353000	3355000	you'd know more about Dreamcast versus PlayStation
3355000	3357000	2 Jamie but I seem to recall you know
3357000	3359000	as much as we love Sega I think Sony
3359000	3361000	was always whooping their ass from the get go weren't they?
3361000	3363000	Sadly. Yeah so
3363000	3365000	you know. But I mean
3365000	3367000	we also over here we had to
3367000	3369000	deal with the problems of coming back
3369000	3371000	from the Saturn
3371000	3373000	versus the PlayStation as you'll recall.
3373000	3375000	Over here the Saturn didn't have the proper
3375000	3377000	support to make it the
3377000	3379000	big machine like it was in Japan.
3379000	3381000	In Japan they had all of the
3381000	3383000	2D games. All of the best stuff came out
3383000	3385000	on Saturn. You know I don't know I think this is just
3385000	3387000	excuses though. I mean if you think about it their
3387000	3389000	whole thing is well we haven't been out as
3389000	3391000	long as the 360 so that's why we haven't
3391000	3393000	sold as many units.
3393000	3395000	No you still have not figured out
3395000	3397000	why you haven't sold that many units yet.
3397000	3399000	And that fact right there is scary
3399000	3401000	as it is if you can't figure out why your system
3401000	3403000	is not selling. I mean
3403000	3405000	dude it's your
3405000	3407000	fucking price. I mean that's why the
3407000	3409000	Panasonic 3DO didn't take off because
3409000	3411000	it was $700.
3411000	3413000	I mean that's what Rob was asking.
3413000	3415000	Wait quick name one game on the
3415000	3417000	3DO. 5, 4
3417000	3419000	And it had
3419000	3421000	You Don't Know Jack. I remember playing that
3421000	3423000	game. But back to what Rob asked.
3423000	3425000	I bet most people wouldn't have passed that
3425000	3427000	challenge. Sorry. I think that
3427000	3429000	the whole reason, part of the reason why the Dreamcast
3429000	3431000	didn't take off so well over here
3431000	3433000	was just coming off of the
3433000	3435000	American failure of the Saturn.
3435000	3437000	Because overseas it was
3437000	3439000	the shit. I mean
3439000	3441000	that's why I imported all my games on Saturn.
3441000	3443000	But
3443000	3445000	and you know the Dreamcast
3445000	3447000	to me had more fun
3447000	3449000	games on it than the PS2 did
3449000	3451000	but I think it was just coming off of
3451000	3453000	that failure and then
3453000	3455000	but now you know I always looked at
3455000	3457000	Microsoft has sort of taken Sega's
3457000	3459000	place as far as systems go
3459000	3461000	and then they've just turned it
3461000	3463000	right around because I honestly think that
3463000	3465000	they're looking into the
3465000	3467000	actual thing that gamers want instead of the
3467000	3469000	thing they think gamers want. You know what I mean?
3469000	3471000	If they want to catch up
3471000	3473000	they need to put out the $399 skew
3473000	3475000	and then they need to start putting out some better
3475000	3477000	games because I think with that price point being
3477000	3479000	in place people will be more likely to buy the
3479000	3481000	system, developers will be more likely
3481000	3483000	to make games for it, etc.
3483000	3485000	It's interesting you bring that up, that whole
3485000	3487000	Microsoft took Sega's place thing because then you
3487000	3489000	even put, I've thought the same thing actually
3489000	3491000	and it's kind of interesting because you even
3491000	3493000	throw that Peter Moore thing you know because he was with
3493000	3495000	the Dreamcast and then he did the, you know he's not with
3495000	3497000	Microsoft anymore but he was definitely a big part of 360
3497000	3499000	it makes it even more eerie
3499000	3501000	that whole comparison.
3501000	3503000	Anyway, we can move on
3503000	3505000	with the news now, sorry just random
3505000	3507000	sidebars. Really, can I?
3507000	3509000	Yes, actually maybe I should go to the chat and see
3509000	3511000	what's going on in chat.
3511000	3513000	I'm sorry if I mispronounced this, either
3513000	3515000	Wettu or Weetu, I think it's Weetu?
3515000	3517000	There's no A in it though. It says Dreamcast
3517000	3519000	sold really well in New Zealand but
3519000	3521000	PlayStation 2 killed it.
3521000	3523000	Misty said I never got PlayStation
3523000	3525000	2 until DDR and if I recall
3525000	3527000	correctly I got my PlayStation
3527000	3529000	2 at the same mall GameStop that I got
3529000	3531000	my little DS Lite bundle at.
3531000	3533000	BlackWolf says wasn't Tempest 2000
3533000	3535000	on the 3DO? Jaguar.
3535000	3537000	Jaguar. Was the only game worth getting on the Jaguar?
3537000	3539000	There was another one on
3539000	3541000	Jaguar. Okay, one other Jaguar game.
3541000	3543000	But
3543000	3545000	yeah, it was all about, and now you
3545000	3547000	can get Tempest 2000 on damn near
3547000	3549000	everything else. Mr. DeBucket says Peter Moore
3549000	3551000	says 9-9 of 99 is still the biggest
3551000	3553000	day in media history? Fuck Halo 3.
3553000	3555000	That's right, because the MTV
3555000	3557000	Music Awards were on 9-9 of 99
3557000	3559000	weren't they? I was sitting in line for my Dreamcast.
3559000	3561000	We can move on, please
3561000	3563000	let's move on.
3563000	3565000	That's what I was doing except for when I ran
3565000	3567000	over and bought a book and then came back and
3567000	3569000	waited in line. Wait, BlackWolf says
3569000	3571000	3DO Jaguar, same thing.
3571000	3573000	No. Compare the
3573000	3575000	controller sometime. The Jaguar
3575000	3577000	came with like a dictionary for
3577000	3579000	a controller.
3579000	3581000	You know what I still think was the most kind of
3581000	3583000	but controller there was was the ColecoVision
3583000	3585000	controller. Yeah, I was going to say it looked very
3585000	3587000	similar to ColecoVision. ColecoVision
3587000	3589000	I mean it could have been like a cell phone of the 80's
3589000	3591000	they had like a whole number pad on there.
3591000	3593000	The only game that I played on the
3593000	3595000	ColecoVision that used that number pad was
3595000	3597000	Mouse Trap. Seriously?
3597000	3599000	The Jaguar controller
3599000	3601000	reminds me of the Steel Battalion
3601000	3603000	controller. Now the Steel Battalion
3603000	3605000	controller is freaking awesome. It was one
3605000	3607000	eject button short of a Steel Battalion controller
3607000	3609000	that's what it was. Hey, I bought my husband
3609000	3611000	a Steel Battalion controller for his birthday.
3611000	3613000	Alright. Because I'm the best
3613000	3615000	wife ever. Okay, chat room please
3615000	3617000	stop derailing the show. Yes please.
3617000	3619000	Let's move on with the news.
3619000	3621000	There was a
3621000	3623000	recent FCC filing
3623000	3625000	for a 40GB PS3
3625000	3627000	and Sony isn't saying crap about
3627000	3629000	it. They are
3629000	3631000	really not saying crap about it.
3631000	3633000	I don't see any statements, no nothing.
3633000	3635000	Because
3635000	3637000	they're like, oh shit
3637000	3639000	not again.
3639000	3641000	There is no 40GB system just like
3641000	3643000	there was no PSP Slim or
3643000	3645000	no rumbling controllers.
3645000	3647000	Well
3647000	3649000	at any rate
3649000	3651000	it's there. They're not saying anything
3651000	3653000	end of story.
3653000	3655000	Or no 80GB
3655000	3657000	system.
3657000	3659000	Well I already got mine.
3659000	3661000	Why does it seem like the hard drive
3661000	3663000	is the only thing that freaking changes on that system?
3663000	3665000	Because you don't get it. Well people must not like it
3665000	3667000	because they don't have a large enough hard drive.
3667000	3669000	Well put something for me to put on the hard drive.
3669000	3671000	Bigger is better Rob. Oh well.
3671000	3673000	Well Rob, you know you can convert your videos over.
3673000	3675000	Oh wait, but there isn't really an easy way to do that.
3675000	3677000	Oh and they don't really tell you how to
3677000	3679000	Next story, I'm angry. Sorry.
3679000	3681000	I use it for putting videos on there.
3681000	3683000	I have a copy of
3683000	3685000	Kung Pao on there.
3685000	3687000	Whoop-de-freaking-do. Hey, Kung Pao
3687000	3689000	is an awesome movie. Don't talk bad about it.
3689000	3691000	Steve OdoKirk needs to fucking make a sequel.
3691000	3693000	Anyways. Somebody linked
3693000	3695000	a picture of the Jaguar controller in chat.
3695000	3697000	How is that thing supposed to, that's like an original
3697000	3699000	Xbox controller, okay.
3699000	3701000	Where you have to have like gorilla hands to be able to hold
3701000	3703000	that thing.
3703000	3705000	See, with it being that big, it makes
3705000	3707000	one sort of wonder about the
3707000	3709000	Saturn dual analog controller, but that one
3709000	3711000	is one of the single most
3711000	3713000	comfortable controllers ever. And they wonder
3713000	3715000	why the Xbox didn't sell in Japan.
3715000	3717000	I mean, you need like
3717000	3719000	three Japanese hands to hold the Xbox.
3719000	3721000	No, Rob, Rob, Rob.
3721000	3723000	I will point out to you that when they released the
3723000	3725000	Xbox in Japan, it did have a smaller controller.
3725000	3727000	Which they released here, and
3727000	3729000	Which I made Dan buy me because
3729000	3731000	I'm sorry, look at these short fingers.
3731000	3733000	You do not have gorilla hands.
3733000	3735000	You have petite little girly hands.
3735000	3737000	Alright. Anyways.
3737000	3739000	So, it's been confirmed
3739000	3741000	the price of Rock Band, and the date for Rock Band
3741000	3743000	has been announced.
3743000	3745000	Rock Band will come out on the Xbox 360
3745000	3747000	and Playstation 3 on
3747000	3749000	Black Friday. Thank you,
3749000	3751000	EA, for
3751000	3753000	$170.
3753000	3755000	And of course, that is the bundle
3755000	3757000	which is going to include both
3757000	3759000	a guitar,
3759000	3761000	a drum set,
3761000	3763000	microphone, and the game. Of course, the game
3763000	3765000	by itself will also be available
3765000	3767000	for $60 in case you
3767000	3769000	just want to play the guitar version and
3769000	3773000	own a guitar from Guitar Hero.
3773000	3775000	However, what is kind of new
3775000	3777000	is they announced that there will be a Playstation 2
3777000	3779000	version for the low, low price of
3779000	3781000	$160. You save $10.
3781000	3785000	And that is coming out on December 10th.
3785000	3787000	And of course, we'll feature these same things
3787000	3789000	as well. What I find interesting
3789000	3791000	is that they came out with a Playstation 2
3791000	3793000	version. Something tells me it's because
3793000	3795000	they like money.
3795000	3797000	You got to play Rock Band last week.
3797000	3799000	Is it worth it?
3799000	3801000	For that price? Yeah, I think so. I was going to buy it for
3801000	3803000	$200. Good. I'll come over and play yours
3803000	3805000	because I don't feel like dropping that kind of money
3805000	3807000	on a video game.
3807000	3809000	Well, hopefully you'll get a pretty decent discount.
3809000	3811000	I wish they would send me a copy for free.
3811000	3813000	I'll buy the game itself,
3813000	3815000	but I'm not going to buy $100. For a game
3815000	3817000	I'll play once, and you know it.
3817000	3819000	I'm only going to play it once, probably.
3819000	3821000	Because we don't have people
3821000	3823000	over all the time. I play
3823000	3825000	Guitar Hero 1. I don't see my roommate being somebody
3825000	3827000	where I'm going to be all like, hey, let's bust out
3827000	3829000	Rock Band and get down.
3829000	3831000	It's a party game. It's a total party game.
3831000	3833000	Speaking of Guitar Hero 2, whatever fucking happened to
3833000	3835000	their Effector pedal or something that was going to be
3835000	3837000	added later on, I
3837000	3839000	built one of those Effector pedals
3839000	3841000	and now it's for nothing.
3841000	3843000	Seriously, very disappointing.
3843000	3845000	Not that it cost me any money to do that, but
3845000	3847000	you know, still very disappointing.
3847000	3849000	Because it works, too.
3849000	3851000	Except it doesn't do anything.
3851000	3853000	Anyways,
3853000	3855000	I think it's going to be worth it.
3855000	3857000	The big thing for me, I think, is going to be to see
3857000	3859000	whether people are going to pay $170
3859000	3861000	for this game or not.
3861000	3863000	I will.
3863000	3865000	I don't know.
3865000	3867000	It's going to be big. It's definitely going to sell
3867000	3869000	very well. It's just, are people going to pay
3869000	3871000	$170 for a game?
3871000	3873000	And if so,
3873000	3875000	then we're going to see a bunch more.
3875000	3877000	I think it is going to be
3877000	3879000	a huge party game. I totally see
3879000	3881000	this is the kind of thing that people who have
3881000	3883000	big families or
3883000	3885000	people that host parties regularly
3885000	3887000	or it's going to become like the
3887000	3889000	we're going to have this at a fundraiser
3889000	3891000	or have Rock Band there. Because Guitar Hero
3891000	3893000	is already like that.
3893000	3895000	Oh, we're going to have a fundraiser.
3895000	3897000	We're going to have a bake sale slash car
3897000	3899000	wash. Guitar Hero is going to be there.
3899000	3901000	I don't know. Am I the only one that ever
3901000	3903000	notices that Guitar Hero seems to turn up at these
3903000	3905000	random charity events that you see advertised?
3905000	3907000	That's going to be Rock Band.
3907000	3909000	Well, it's cool, I guess.
3909000	3911000	I'm not knocking Rock Band.
3911000	3913000	It's just a lot of money to drop on a game.
3913000	3915000	It is.
3915000	3917000	I don't know.
3917000	3919000	Now you have me
3919000	3921000	waving on it now.
3921000	3923000	Oops. Sorry EA.
3923000	3925000	Sorry, Harmonics.
3925000	3927000	Well then let's go to the next story before
3927000	3929000	Loki changes his mind completely.
3929000	3931000	The PlayStation.com shopping service
3931000	3933000	is closing in Japan.
3933000	3935000	That's right. In December
3935000	3937000	it will be ending the site's
3937000	3939000	e-commerce services and the service
3939000	3941000	will be coming to a complete halt in February
3941000	3943000	2008. Now while at first glance
3943000	3945000	this might seem like, oh, doom and gloom
3945000	3947000	for the PlayStation, not so.
3947000	3949000	Because PlayStation.com was for
3949000	3951000	providing downloadable content for the
3951000	3953000	PlayStation 2. But as you guys all know
3953000	3955000	it's all about the PlayStation 3 now
3955000	3957000	and the PlayStation Network.
3957000	3959000	PlayStation 2 had downloadable content?
3959000	3961000	I guess in Japan, yeah. Because you get the PlayStation
3961000	3963000	points.
3963000	3965000	Well anyway, if you still have PlayStation
3965000	3967000	points you can transfer those over to your
3967000	3969000	PlayStation 3 wallet.
3969000	3971000	They always get better stuff in Japan.
3971000	3973000	Hello? Where have you been?
3973000	3975000	Where have you been?
3975000	3977000	I don't know.
3977000	3979000	Well,
3979000	3981000	for anyone who also
3981000	3983000	has been keeping up with more
3983000	3985000	of the downloadable content for PS3
3985000	3987000	especially for our European fans.
3987000	3989000	Well, I should say fans of the system.
3989000	3991000	Well,
3991000	3993000	Sony is pulling
3993000	3995000	their Gran Turismo HD concept
3995000	3997000	from the Japanese store
3997000	3999000	and it's not probably
3999000	4001000	coming out in Europe at all.
4001000	4003000	There's been no announcement.
4003000	4005000	No nothing.
4005000	4007000	They're just not getting it.
4007000	4009000	Sorry. But now
4009000	4011000	there's a Gran Turismo 5 prologue
4011000	4013000	that will be
4013000	4015000	coming out but there's no date for it
4015000	4017000	in the UK yet.
4017000	4019000	So that's kind of a bitch move I think
4019000	4021000	that they're actually getting rid of
4021000	4023000	the free version
4023000	4025000	of Gran Turismo on there
4025000	4027000	before the paid
4027000	4029000	demo I guess comes out.
4029000	4031000	Well, if you have a PS3 now
4031000	4033000	might as well download it.
4033000	4035000	Put it on your hard drive.
4035000	4037000	Honestly, what else are you going to
4037000	4039000	fill that hard drive with?
4039000	4041000	It wasn't a bad game.
4041000	4043000	I mean it's good for a demo.
4043000	4045000	I just can't see myself paying 50 bucks
4045000	4047000	I can't see myself paying 50 bucks
4047000	4049000	for Gran Turismo 5
4049000	4051000	prologue. I'm telling you
4051000	4053000	put porn on the Playstation Network
4053000	4055000	Sony will start out selling Microsoft
4055000	4057000	consoles tomorrow.
4057000	4059000	Mark my words.
4059000	4061000	Okay, don't
4061000	4063000	mark my words. Read another story.
4063000	4065000	Mark my words.
4065000	4067000	Parrish.
4067000	4069000	The fuck was that?
4069000	4071000	That sounded funny.
4071000	4073000	Do you need some fresh air, Loki?
4073000	4075000	I'm feeling fine. I have to drive from Oakland.
4075000	4077000	I'm feeling tingle fresh.
4079000	4081000	Mark my words.
4081000	4083000	You will pay for that.
4083000	4085000	By the way, kids, don't forget to buy
4085000	4087000	the Eye of Judgment. We only have to sell a million.
4089000	4091000	If you don't know what I'm talking about, listen to last week's show.
4091000	4093000	It will never happen.
4093000	4095000	Never.
4095000	4097000	Story.
4097000	4099000	So, in Europe
4099000	4101000	Playstation 3 is getting another
4101000	4103000	bundle. Not surprising
4103000	4105000	though, it's going to be bundled with Pro
4105000	4107000	Evolution Soccer 2008.
4107000	4109000	And it's coming in November.
4111000	4113000	That's all there is to say.
4113000	4115000	Yeah, it was confirmed
4115000	4117000	by Playstation France and
4119000	4121000	Well, that's logical.
4121000	4123000	You know, sports bundles are nothing
4123000	4125000	uncommon and certainly in Europe a soccer
4125000	4127000	bundle is going to sell some systems.
4127000	4129000	So, you know, makes sense.
4129000	4131000	Exactly. I mean,
4131000	4133000	remember that really crappy one that they did
4133000	4135000	for, I think it was Pro Evo
4135000	4137000	2007. It was like with
4137000	4139000	AstroTurf on the 360.
4141000	4143000	Wait, it came with AstroTurf? What?
4143000	4145000	They did like, it was an auction
4145000	4147000	thing where they were selling it.
4147000	4149000	What?
4149000	4151000	Well, ten years
4151000	4153000	Funny! Not funny.
4153000	4155000	Ten years have passed since Ultima Online
4155000	4157000	first rolled out. That's right, back in
4157000	4159000	1997 was when Ultima Online was
4159000	4161000	first unleashed upon the world.
4161000	4163000	And now EA is celebrating with a ten
4163000	4165000	years of Ultima Online celebration.
4165000	4167000	There's a brand new
4167000	4169000	Kingdom Reborn update,
4169000	4171000	which I think we reported on previously in the program.
4171000	4173000	It's free to download for the previous
4173000	4175000	subscribers through October 9th.
4175000	4177000	But, however, there's also now
4177000	4179000	the Return to Britannia campaign
4179000	4181000	that's going on. Electronic Arts
4181000	4183000	is doing a monster hunt and
4183000	4185000	prizes such as a new pendant necklace,
4185000	4187000	a whole map of Britannia that you can win,
4187000	4189000	a commemorative sculpture,
4189000	4191000	armor set, all this stuff.
4191000	4193000	The characters in game get fireworks
4193000	4195000	and ten decor tokens.
4195000	4197000	Unfortunately, I haven't played the game
4197000	4199000	so I can't tell you what those tokens do,
4199000	4201000	but maybe somebody can email us and let us know
4201000	4203000	and mail back buy more fireworks!
4203000	4205000	I was actually going to check this game out because I think
4205000	4207000	you can get a two week free trial.
4207000	4209000	Since I've been going back and forth on all these MMOs lately,
4209000	4211000	why not check out the granddaddy of all the
4211000	4213000	MMOs? I remember when I played
4213000	4215000	Ultima Online with my friend briefly,
4215000	4217000	and god, I remember who it was.
4217000	4219000	It was still long ago, but
4219000	4221000	we were complete
4221000	4223000	asses on the game and it was fun.
4223000	4225000	Did you get banned? Oh no, we were just
4225000	4227000	playing around at his
4227000	4229000	house and just running around
4229000	4231000	as our character was completely naked
4231000	4233000	yelling sausage for sale.
4233000	4235000	That's all I remember.
4235000	4237000	That's all I remember.
4237000	4239000	That's all I remember.
4239000	4241000	I think I saw that in the
4241000	4243000	barons the other day, so some things never
4243000	4245000	change, you know?
4245000	4247000	No, no, no, no, no.
4247000	4249000	Someone was walking around in one of the
4249000	4251000	towns in Ragnarok the other day going,
4251000	4253000	I got a snake mange!
4253000	4255000	Like the Adam Sandler thing.
4255000	4257000	Now they've taken that and now it's just slash dance.
4257000	4259000	Does Ultima Online have
4259000	4261000	slash dance? We don't have slash dance
4261000	4263000	I just remember it was weird because people would buy
4263000	4265000	houses and they would store their horse in
4265000	4267000	their house and I was like, why would you put a
4267000	4269000	why were we walking past a house
4269000	4271000	where I hear a horse? It was weird.
4271000	4273000	But it was because you can lock the houses, otherwise
4273000	4275000	your stuff would get stolen, I guess, or something.
4275000	4277000	I think Misty sums up my thoughts
4277000	4279000	on the Ultima Online bonus stuff.
4279000	4281000	She says, Woot explosives.
4281000	4283000	That's true, explosives are always
4283000	4285000	good incentive to come back to an
4285000	4287000	old abandoned MMO. I shouldn't say
4287000	4289000	that, actually. I guess there's still quite a few
4289000	4291000	people who play Ultima Online. I just
4291000	4293000	don't know any of them.
4293000	4295000	Oh well, perhaps some will email us.
4295000	4297000	I know a couple of people who play. Really?
4297000	4299000	Yeah.
4299000	4301000	Alright. Ask them if they're having
4301000	4303000	fun with the event or whatever. We'll have to
4303000	4305000	bring them on the show for an interview. Interview this
4305000	4307000	week, people that actually play Ultima Online. It's either
4307000	4309000	Ultima Online or Diablo. Oh, because they're so similar.
4309000	4311000	They look very similar, actually.
4311000	4313000	Some of them I just
4313000	4315000	sort of get mixed up on. Like, who plays EverQuest
4315000	4317000	anymore? We never...
4317000	4319000	To be honest, when I went out to
4319000	4321000	Pennsylvania
4321000	4323000	last year, one of the
4323000	4325000	workers at our office
4325000	4327000	that we work with out there, without saying too much about what I do
4327000	4329000	during the day, she
4329000	4331000	knew that I was into video games. I said, yeah,
4331000	4333000	at the time I was playing Final Fantasy 11.
4333000	4335000	I'm like, yeah, I play Final Fantasy 11. She's all, oh, I
4335000	4337000	tried that once, but I just can't give up EverQuest.
4337000	4339000	She's like, me and my husband play EverQuest
4339000	4341000	all the time. You haven't played EverQuest? I'm like, I watched
4341000	4343000	it once and I was bored out of my mind.
4343000	4345000	But, yeah, I've seen it.
4345000	4347000	There are people out there that still play EverQuest.
4347000	4349000	We just don't really hear much about it anymore.
4349000	4351000	It's harder to find people that are playing
4351000	4353000	EverQuest 2 because nobody wanted
4353000	4355000	to abandon their EverQuest character. I think that was one of the
4355000	4357000	biggest mistakes they made, is they should have made a way
4357000	4359000	for you can at least get some type of bonuses
4359000	4361000	for bringing your character over from EverQuest 1.
4361000	4363000	Maybe I'm just crazy, I don't know.
4363000	4365000	Anyhow,
4365000	4367000	DarkSakura, every week
4367000	4369000	she likes to surf the internet up and down and all
4369000	4371000	around and bring you her very favorite in
4371000	4373000	websites. By the way, folks,
4373000	4375000	this is the very last edition of
4375000	4377000	DarkSakura's website of the week.
4377000	4379000	Sorry to report, DarkSakura
4379000	4381000	is no longer going to be able to give you a website of the week
4381000	4383000	because pretty
4383000	4385000	much you can bet that
4385000	4387000	if the site has something to do with
4387000	4389000	pictures of cats, it's probably going to be
4389000	4391000	her website of the week. No.
4391000	4393000	I've done a bunch of cool
4393000	4395000	sites, Rob. In all seriousness,
4395000	4397000	DarkSakura's website of the week...
4397000	4399000	One had two website of the week mentions.
4399000	4401000	That's right. The Weebles.
4401000	4403000	That's right. Well, anyway, or Doctor Who.
4403000	4405000	No, there's multiple Doctor Who
4405000	4407000	sites, but I've done Weebles twice. Anyway,
4407000	4409000	DarkSakura's website of the week will be going away
4409000	4411000	in favor of DarkSakura's
4411000	4413000	Classic Game of the Week.
4413000	4415000	Well, yeah. You better pick a good one for the very first
4415000	4417000	week next week, the Classic Game of the Week. I already know what I'm
4417000	4419000	going to pick. So here it is for the very last time. And it's not
4419000	4421000	the Guardian Legend. I'm so disappointed.
4421000	4423000	No, that's too predictable.
4423000	4425000	Guardian Legend will save for down
4425000	4427000	the road, but we'll do the Classic Game of the Week. It'll be something obscure
4427000	4429000	like rainbow cotton. Alright.
4429000	4431000	Anyhow, don't give it away.
4431000	4433000	They won't want to tune in next week.
4433000	4435000	Make it a game you don't talk about a lot
4435000	4437000	on the show.
4437000	4439000	Anyhow, here it is, ladies and gentlemen,
4439000	4441000	the very last website of the week.
4445000	4447000	DarkSakura, you better be good.
4447000	4449000	The website
4449000	4451000	of the week is
4451000	4453000	speaklolcat.com
4453000	4455000	It's very easy,
4455000	4457000	very simple.
4457000	4459000	You type in something in English and it translates
4459000	4461000	it into catspeak.
4461000	4463000	What did I tell all of you?
4463000	4465000	If it has to do with lolcat, it's your
4465000	4467000	side of the week. See, I'm going to type in something right now.
4469000	4471000	Um, okay.
4471000	4473000	I don't know. I'm talking and I'm...
4473000	4475000	What are you putting in there? Rob is a big what?
4475000	4477000	Tool. Tool?
4477000	4479000	And it says Rob is huge tool.
4479000	4481000	Hahahaha
4481000	4483000	Lovely.
4483000	4485000	I'm going to post that direct link into the chatroom.
4485000	4489000	But, um, it's speaklolcat.com
4491000	4493000	And that, boys and girls, is the very last
4493000	4495000	website of the week.
4495000	4497000	End of line.
4497000	4499000	Alright, so next week, DarkSakura's classic game
4499000	4501000	of the week. Yay!
4501000	4503000	Oh, you can actually link it
4503000	4505000	with it saying Rob is a big tool.
4505000	4507000	Yep, that's why I did it.
4507000	4509000	Let me just check that out on my screen here.
4509000	4511000	Rob is huge tool.
4511000	4513000	You're a bitch.
4513000	4515000	Alright. I love you.
4515000	4517000	Wait, actually, I want to see that.
4517000	4519000	Let me go back to that site here.
4519000	4523000	Jamie is a bitch.
4523000	4525000	Rob's really good at typing with one hand.
4525000	4527000	I am. I can do a lot of things with one hand.
4527000	4529000	Jamie is bish.
4529000	4531000	Okay, where did that come from?
4535000	4539000	I think this show is in need of a break.
4539000	4541000	I think this show might actually be in need of cancellation.
4541000	4543000	But we'll have to do it for a break for now.
4543000	4545000	We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4545000	4547000	Right after this, Nintendo News,
4547000	4549000	in part, we haven't even touched Nintendo yet during the show.
4549000	4551000	We'll get to all the Nintendo news in part B
4551000	4553000	and plenty more to come.
4553000	4555000	Don't worry, we'll touch Nintendo plenty when we come back.
4555000	4557000	We'll get out our wheeze when we come back.
4557000	4559000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights
