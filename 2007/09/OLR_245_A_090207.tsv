0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco.
14000	27000	Tonight, September 2nd, 2007, Xbox Live gets a Labor Day sale, PlayStation gets a SingStar bundle, and an old PC gaming classic is now free.
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
57000	60000	But joining us, as always, say hello to Loki.
60000	61000	Yes.
61000	62000	How are you doing, Loki?
62000	64000	I'm fine.
64000	67000	You're fine? That sounded a little bit forced.
67000	68000	I'm doing okay.
68000	72000	Oh, so now we've downgraded from find okay. What gives?
72000	78000	I'm running low of soda in this cup here, but luckily I brought two backups.
78000	80000	How much soda do you bring to this program?
80000	81000	Two cans.
81000	82000	Two cans.
82000	87000	All right, also joining us tonight, say hello to Miklatov, who's filling in in the big blue chair tonight.
87000	88000	Hello.
88000	89000	How are you doing, Miklatov?
89000	90000	I'm fine.
90000	91000	What are you playing there on your PSP?
91000	92000	It's not my PSP.
92000	93000	Whose PSP is it?
93000	94000	Matt's.
94000	95000	Matt's? What are you playing on Matt's PSP?
95000	98000	I am playing Katamari.
98000	100000	Can I show the webcam people what you're doing?
100000	103000	Fine, but I'm going to miss important text.
103000	105000	Important dialogue and what have you.
105000	109000	Dude, the king of all cosmos always says important funny things.
109000	111000	Well, you missed that one, I'm sorry to say.
111000	112000	All right.
112000	116000	Well, anyhow, yes, we do have webcam tonight for the folks that are listening live.
116000	118000	We're on operator11.com.
118000	124000	I do want to state, though, as we were kind of talking about last week, we're not planning on suddenly changing into a video show or a video podcast.
124000	129000	It's just that some of our live listeners wanted to see us while we were taping live, so here we are.
129000	130000	The webcam's on.
130000	137000	But operator11 has some funky rules, and it's supposedly going to shut off after 40 minutes, and so we won't be able to archive until part B again.
137000	143000	But the good news is that operator11 saves an archive of the file for a long time, so if you're listening to the podcast and you wonder to yourself,
143000	149000	I wonder what this looks like being taped live, you can go over to operator11.com and look for our feed on there and see it.
149000	152000	I want to see how fat all the hosts look on camera and then find out.
152000	154000	And then you can love us long time.
154000	155000	Yes, you can.
155000	158000	I just named my island in Katamari.
158000	161000	What is your island in Katamari?
161000	163000	It's Poop Island.
163000	164000	That's lovely.
164000	165000	Cracks me up.
165000	166000	Do you get to name those yourself?
166000	167000	I played the Katamari on the PSP.
167000	168000	I don't know.
168000	170000	It just asked me to name the island, so I named it Poop Island.
170000	173000	My island was named Slavery Island.
173000	174000	Why did you name it that?
174000	175000	I don't know.
175000	176000	All right.
176000	179000	Let's start off tonight's show, as we always do, talking about how is your gaming week.
179000	186000	Dark Sakura starts us off, but she's not here, so I'll go to Shane, also known as Miklotov, first, since obviously he's playing me and my Katamari.
186000	188000	So I'm playing me and my Katamari.
188000	190000	And how is it?
190000	192000	I hate the controls a lot.
192000	198000	It's really bad to control, but it's still funny, and that's what really counts in Katamari.
198000	199000	What else have you been playing this week?
199000	203000	Metroid Prime 3, which is the coolest.
203000	206000	What do you like about Metroid Prime 3?
206000	209000	It's fun.
209000	211000	What a very descriptive answer you're giving us here.
211000	214000	Well, that was a terrible question.
214000	215000	Sorry.
215000	218000	Why do you think Metroid Prime 3 is so fun?
218000	220000	What is it about the game that appeals to you?
220000	235000	Well, I like the fact that the controls are really cool, and I like the Metroid Prime series, and I like the fact that—spoilers are coming up—I got to fight Ridley, and it was really fun, and I had to shoot him in his mouth.
235000	239000	And I was falling down this big shaft the whole time, and it was really cool.
239000	241000	So you have to fight somebody while you're falling down?
241000	242000	Yes.
242000	243000	Is there a chance that you'll ever hit the ground?
243000	244000	Probably not.
244000	245000	Did you just keep falling forever?
245000	247000	I think you fall forever until you beat Ridley or Ridley kills you.
247000	248000	All right.
248000	251000	Also, is there anything else you're giving me?
251000	254000	I started playing Suikoden V again.
254000	259000	I've owned it since it came out, and I worked on it, but I never actually played it, really.
259000	260000	Can you say what you did on the game?
260000	261000	Yeah, I've said before.
261000	262000	I don't remember.
262000	263000	I did text.
263000	264000	I can't remember.
264000	267000	There's secrets you can say and things you can't say on air.
267000	270000	And yeah, I'm just now starting to play it.
270000	273000	See, if I asked you if there was a Suikoden VI, could you talk about that?
273000	275000	I could not talk about that.
275000	277000	You can neither confirm nor deny those reports?
277000	278000	Not.
278000	279000	All right.
279000	280000	Fine.
280000	281000	Fair enough.
281000	282000	Anything else?
282000	283000	No.
283000	284000	All right.
284000	285000	Let's go over to Loki.
285000	286000	And while Loki talks about his gaming week, I'm going to go grab another cookie.
286000	288000	Do you want a peanut butter cookie, Loki?
288000	289000	Yes.
289000	290000	Awesome.
290000	291000	I want a peanut butter cookie.
291000	292000	All right.
292000	293000	I'm going to go get that.
293000	294000	Stupid cookies.
294000	295000	Loki, tell us about your gaming week.
295000	296000	My gaming week was a lot of Xbox 360 stuff.
296000	301000	I played a lot of demos, including some stuff I've already played before, like beautiful
301000	302000	Katamari.
302000	303520	Ace Combat 6.
303520	308640	I think I tried a little bit of Juice 2 and didn't like that still.
308640	314460	Then, of course, I played Bioshock, which is still awesome and continues to get even
314460	316520	more awesome as I play it.
316520	319860	So definitely, ooh, cookie.
319860	321120	And let's see.
321120	325540	Other games I've played, Call of Duty 4, I actually got to try a little bit of the multiplayer
325540	326820	beta.
326820	330980	And I had no doubts going into it that the game's going to be awesome, and it's just
330980	331980	amazing.
331980	334200	It still plays like Call of Duty 2 and 3.
334200	338820	I do like how they've updated the radar a little bit so you can actually get a better
338820	342000	idea of where people are firing from, so that's pretty cool.
342000	346120	And also the replays of when you get killed, they're pretty cool.
346120	347600	So that's neat.
347600	354380	And then other stuff, I actually played more Settlers of Catan on Xbox Live Arcade.
354380	360480	And I thought about, oh, I played Street Trace New York.
360480	365120	It's that hoverboard racing combat game or something.
365120	366680	That game's really weird.
366680	373880	It kind of reminds me of like Crossing Sonic Riders with that crappy, was it that bumper
373880	376960	car game that came with Windows 98 or something.
376960	378960	I don't even remember what the hell that's called.
378960	381160	But something like that.
381160	382680	Not recommending that game, though.
382680	384240	It's quite boring.
384240	388600	But I tried the demo, and that was kind of fun.
388600	389600	Let's see.
389600	395600	Other stuff, on PSP, I was playing a lot of We Love Katamari, and I don't know why.
395600	402200	I absolutely hate the control in that game, but I'm stuck playing it and loving it.
402200	405720	The only thing I wish they would do is just port that to PlayStation 2, because I know
405720	408920	they like doing those ports from PSP to PlayStation 2.
408920	409920	Just do that.
409920	415240	I mean, I'll spend the $20 to actually buy the game, so I think that's what they need
415240	418400	to do to make at least the controls a little bit better.
418400	421720	And other than that, I believe that was my gaming week.
421720	423640	Oh, Saints Row Multiplayer.
423640	430080	We finally, and I wish I had pictures because I haven't finished setting it up yet, but
430080	432720	our game room set up at work is finally done.
432720	437340	We have five Xbox 360s land and have been playing Saints Row on it, and it's absolutely
437340	439160	fun multiplayer.
439160	444980	The only thing I really hate, though, is the system link multiplayer on it, you can't change
444980	447440	the way your character looks, so everybody looks the same.
447440	451960	You can change it on live, but you can't change it in system link, which doesn't make any
451960	453680	sense whatsoever.
453680	458800	But hopefully they'll fix that with a sequel, I don't know.
458800	463480	But hopefully I'll get some actual pictures of the setup.
463480	469800	I'm still putting the 360s in clear cases, which by the way, if I were to review the
469800	472200	clear cases I bought, they absolutely suck.
472200	475560	But they look pretty, so that was my gaming week.
475560	477680	That was a hell of a lot of gaming week.
477680	481160	There's a lot of comments going on in the chat room here at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
481160	484640	Again, our chat room location is chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
484640	487600	If you guys are in the Operator 11 chat, since we are doing the video tonight, I just want
487600	488640	to get out there.
488640	492040	We do not read the Op 11 chat because it's on a laptop that's on the other side of the
492040	494800	room and it's hard for us to read, so you have to be in a regular chat room.
494800	496560	I play Contra IV for the DS.
496560	497880	How did you do that?
497880	502400	Our Konami rep brought in a DS with a dev thing in it.
502400	504280	That's kind of important.
504280	505280	That's a big one.
505280	506280	What's Contra IV?
506280	507720	It's awesome.
507720	512200	It's exactly like you would imagine a sequel to Contra III being.
512200	521080	It's true 2D side-scrolling action, it's Contra, it's awesome, and not that sort of awesome
521080	526160	that was a neo-Contra and stuff like that.
526160	528600	That was pretty cool.
528600	534380	The other thing, I didn't play this game, but I dogged on it last week, Cruisin' for
534380	535380	the Wii.
535380	542520	I actually saw the game in motion in a trailer and it looked not as bad, let me put it that
542520	543520	way.
543520	548440	It looked very low poly count, it almost looked like a DS game ported to the Wii, but it was
548440	553400	running at 60 frames per second, so while it may not have been too pretty to look at,
553400	556800	it was really smooth and looked pretty fun.
556800	558480	If it's cheap enough, let me try it.
558480	561320	I want to go back to Contra IV for a minute because this is a game a lot of people are
561320	563460	very excited about.
563460	565280	How does it use the vertical?
565280	566280	How does it use the two screens?
566280	567560	Is it just a very vertical game?
567560	569080	It's a very vertical game.
569080	570840	It's very tall.
570840	576640	If you'll see stuff falling down and you basically get to shoot at stuff, there's a grappling
576640	580680	hook in it so you can grapple with stuff and crawl on bars and whatnot.
580680	584320	Does it use a touch screen at all or did they just say fuck it?
584320	588040	For the brief time that I had with the game, it did not use a touch screen.
588040	591080	You have no idea if they have the top-down modes like they had in the old Super Nintendo
591080	592080	Contra?
592080	595360	I don't think they do, but it would be cool if they did.
595360	596360	Very cool.
596360	597360	All right.
597360	598360	Wait.
598360	599360	Wait.
599360	600360	Wait.
600360	601360	What?
601360	602360	Let's tell everybody what my new island name is.
602360	603360	Yes.
603360	604360	On Miyamakatamari, what did you name it?
604360	606960	I named it Penn Island.
606960	609520	Penn Island.
609520	611360	Think about that one for a minute.
611360	612360	Penn Island.
612360	613360	P-E-N-I-S-L-A-M-D.
613360	614360	It's so good.
614360	615360	Hilarious.
615360	616360	That's comedy gold.
616360	625080	Anyhow, I was going to go to the chat room here and read some comments, but we got a
625080	626480	little bit sidetracked here.
626480	627480	Again, chat.orangessoundsradio.com.
627480	631360	Somebody was talking about Bioshock here earlier.
631360	634480	Drunami said, Bioshock is fucking scary.
634480	636000	Did you get scared by Bioshock?
636000	641400	There was one time, I didn't get scared, but it startled me a little bit, where you're
641400	649920	investigating this dentist's office and there's pipes breaking and it's freezing stuff.
649920	653680	All of a sudden, one of the pipes breaks and it gets a little foggy and you turn around
653680	656000	and there's a guy standing right there.
656000	657920	I thought he was dead at first.
657920	660760	The first time they played through it and then the second time I knew he was going to
660760	661760	be there.
661760	666000	I turned around and just stood there for a second and then he finally attacked me.
666000	667000	It was kind of freaky.
667000	670400	You turn around and all of a sudden, boom, there's someone there.
670400	673640	Picker Uno says, I got scared by the demo of Bioshock.
673640	674640	I did too a little bit.
674640	675640	I have to admit.
675640	677960	I got a little bit scared from just the demo alone because it's crazy.
677960	685720	The game gets so awesome and I can't imagine Andrew Ryan, the main guy who built this whole
685720	688880	city as Walt Disney.
688880	694320	I can replace Walt Disney in this and just like, I don't know.
694320	697440	You're going to make me not want to go back to Disneyland and that makes me sad because
697440	699440	I love Disneyland.
699440	704960	Andrew Ryan just reminds me of Walt Disney or like a really weird version of Walt Disney.
704960	707520	Maybe they based it off him, who knows.
707520	711240	I was hoping to get some emails from people who didn't like Bioshock, but I didn't see
711240	713120	anything in the mail bag when I last checked.
713120	714120	I don't know.
714120	716480	We'll open up the email bag a little later and let you know if we heard from any people
716480	718280	that didn't like Bioshock.
718280	722520	Anyhow, let's go ahead and go on to My Gaming Week.
722520	723520	I want to talk about My Gaming Week.
723520	726760	I've also been playing Metroid Prime 3, but not quite as much as Shane has.
726760	729600	I don't want to give this game a full review yet, but I can already tell you I like it
729600	731200	better than 1 and 2.
731200	735420	Because 1 and 2, I still had to get over that shock of, oh my god, Metroid is not 2D anymore.
735420	738960	What did they do to my game?
738960	742360	I don't want to label myself as somebody who just hates games automatically because they're
742360	745880	3D, but you have to remember Metroid is a series that's very near and dear to my heart
745880	750600	and it was very hard to kind of conceptualize Metroid in a 3D world.
750600	753160	I don't think the first two games are bad games by any means.
753160	756140	I couldn't get into them because they didn't feel like Metroid to me.
756140	760780	But this third game, I have to admit, the gimmicky controls are actually pretty awesome
760780	765440	and done pretty well considering the limited amount of buttons that a Wii controller has.
765440	766500	It's pretty fun.
766500	771400	And I also like the fact that Metroid Prime 3 kind of breaks the mold of when you start
771400	777320	in the world, you are missing all of your gear, like you only have your suit and a gun.
777320	782480	And when you start in Metroid Prime 3, you already have like a double jump move.
782480	787080	You already have, or you get the ability to shoot missiles rather quickly.
787080	789800	You can already turn into a ball and a lot of that stuff.
789800	791320	So I think that's kind of cool.
791320	795560	Escapist in the chat room asks, do you have to scan everything in Metroid Prime 3 to understand
795560	796960	what the heck is going on?
796960	797960	Yes.
797960	798960	No.
798960	799960	Yes.
799960	800960	No.
800960	801960	But it helps.
801960	802960	No.
802960	805040	The scanning in Metroid Prime 3 only, it's not to tell you what's going on, it's to tell
805040	808840	you now what you need to do to get through this room.
808840	813640	It's not like, oh, you know, there's lore stuff you can read, but...
813640	814640	It's not mandatory.
814640	815640	It's not mandatory.
815640	819820	I did notice it was a little easier to get into story-wise than one or two was, because
819820	824260	you could go up and you could talk to people and it kind of made the story a little better
824260	825440	for me.
825440	827680	It wasn't just scanning things and reading things.
827680	831600	Also, I will point out though, scanning things appears to be the way that you get most of
831600	832880	the tokens in the game.
832880	836700	I know there hasn't been a lot of talk about the tokens, which a couple weeks ago was labeled
836700	842280	by a lot of the big game blogs as, like, Metroid Prime's achievement system, but it's not really
842280	843280	achievements.
843280	847440	The tokens that you unlock by scanning things or doing certain things in the game, you can
847440	852320	use to unlock soundtrack things, graphics and art and all those types of things.
852320	856800	It's kind of like, basically, Mortal Kombat, how you got the tokens from beating things
856800	861640	and you could use them in the crypt or whatever it was called and unlock special stuff.
861640	868080	Also, it uses Wii Connect 24 because for every 100 enemies you kill, you get a green token
868080	873800	and you can send the green tokens to other people and they can use them.
873800	876740	Or, I guess, no, it's a black token and when you send it to someone else, it's green or
876740	881600	something like that, but you have to use friend codes to make that work.
881600	885520	And then you said, Shane, you are pretty sure you got an actual achievement in the game
885520	886520	or something.
886520	887520	Oh, yeah.
887520	888520	I was using my ice missile.
888520	891320	Hey, while I'm talking, smell this alcohol.
891320	893920	I'll talk about the alcohol in a minute, folks.
893920	898920	I was using the ice missile on just enemies randomly.
898920	900200	I want to drink it first.
900200	901200	Not yet.
901200	905800	No, I'm going to drink it first.
905800	912480	I used the ice missile on some lizard thing and once I did that, one of the little cards
912480	920840	you get for every 100 kills, I guess for certain random tasks you do, came up and was like
920840	925920	a chilled lizard or something like that, like a terrible achievement name.
925920	926920	And it was cool.
926920	927920	I like that.
927920	928920	It's achievements.
928920	930320	And you know what you can do with that?
930320	931320	Nothing.
931320	932320	Absolutely nothing.
932320	936840	Just like the Xbox 360 achievements.
936840	939700	By the way, the liquor talk is because it is a three-day weekend, so some of us have
939700	945040	chosen to do a little drinking tonight, which leads me to the responsibility spiel.
945040	948960	Of course, we are all over 21 and Matt's not drinking tonight because he didn't find a
948960	950080	designated driver.
950080	951600	I could have, but I figured that...
951600	952600	Loser?
952600	953600	He's not into it tonight.
953600	956800	You said you were sick and were possibly not going to be drinking, so that's why I didn't
956800	958000	want to be the only one.
958000	962800	Yes, I have been sick, but I figure it's only Tylenol that I'm taking, so I should be okay,
962800	963800	right?
963800	968760	Well, yeah, unless you die, in which case then we would have been terribly wrong.
968760	969760	All right.
969760	972080	Well, anyhow, what else?
972080	974800	But Shane's here and Shane's drinking, although he doesn't like his blue drink, even though
974800	975800	he likes the smell of it.
975800	976800	I like it.
976800	977800	I like the smell.
977800	980320	It's like an alcoholic blueberry muffin to me.
980320	981320	It's really weird.
981320	982320	You want to try this one?
982320	983320	This pomegranate thingy?
983320	984320	I haven't drank from it yet.
984320	985320	Yes.
985320	989440	I was going to say, we are all over 21 and we drink responsibly, blah, blah, blah, and
989440	992840	kids shouldn't drink, blah, blah, blah, and so on, so yeah.
992840	993840	Is that any good?
993840	998720	I don't know if it's the combination of the two, but that tastes like that gamer-fueled
998720	1001000	Mountain Dew to me, which is not a pleasant taste.
1001000	1002000	Really?
1002000	1003000	This is pomegranate fusion smearing off.
1003000	1005780	We're taking it easy tonight, so we'll see.
1005780	1006780	Let's see.
1006780	1007780	What else did I do in my gaming week?
1007780	1012840	I bought on the Xbox 360, which of course is a Japanese RPG made by a lot of the people
1012840	1014120	that were involved with Final Fantasy.
1014120	1019080	You have Sakaguchi, who made the first Final Fantasy, Nobui Matsu does the music again,
1019080	1022320	and then I believe, who is it, Akira Toriyama, is that his name?
1022320	1023320	Something like that.
1023320	1024320	Did the Dragon Ball Z characters?
1024320	1025680	Those are the characters in this game.
1025680	1028300	Blue Dragon is a good game.
1028300	1029760	Is it a great game?
1029760	1030760	No.
1030760	1031760	Is it a 10?
1031760	1032760	No.
1032760	1034600	Is it going to leave a lot of people disappointed because they were expecting...
1034600	1035600	Blue Dragon...
1035600	1036600	Hold on.
1036600	1038200	I'm going to have your opinion in a minute.
1038200	1042360	Is it going to leave a lot of people disappointed because you hear these big names attached
1042360	1047080	to it, and you are expecting greatness, or like a Final Fantasy XIII or something?
1047080	1048080	Yes.
1048080	1049240	It's going to leave a lot of people disappointed.
1049240	1053040	But it's not a bad game by any means, and certainly it's the type of game that the Xbox
1053040	1054920	360 is severely lacking.
1054920	1056560	But here's the problems I see with Blue Dragon.
1056560	1057560	It's not with the battle system.
1057560	1058980	I love the battle system.
1058980	1064560	It's a real throwback to an old Super Nintendo RPG, and it feels very similar to Final Fantasy
1064560	1067360	V with some elements in the act of time kind of thrown in.
1067360	1072560	You can charge attacks and drop them in certain places in the act of time, and depending on
1072560	1074680	how long you charge, it does more damage.
1074680	1079680	So I personally like the battle system as a throwback to old RPGs, but the story is
1079680	1081320	kind of meh.
1081320	1084880	And you would think with these names attached to it would be an awesome story, but the problem
1084880	1088480	with the story is that it just kind of comes out of nowhere, you know?
1088480	1091160	And you don't understand what the bad guy's motivations are.
1091160	1099640	I mean, literally, you go up into this big bubble in the sky.
1099640	1109480	Your town is being attacked by this land shark.
1109480	1113520	This shark is going around destroying buildings and things, and then you basically manage
1113520	1117400	to sort of catch the land shark, but it drags you into this place.
1117400	1119400	Would you say it's a street shark?
1119400	1120680	No, it's a land shark.
1120680	1121680	That's what they call it.
1121680	1123520	And it even has a fin that sticks out above the ground.
1123520	1127200	I thought it may have been a reference back to that really crappy cartoon series.
1127200	1132160	Eventually, the land shark takes them underground, and then the land shark blasts off into space,
1132160	1136360	and they're on it, or not, I shouldn't say into space, but into the sky.
1136360	1138160	And then they finally meet the bad guy.
1138160	1141240	You encounter the main bad guy within the first 30 minutes to an hour of the game, and
1141240	1142520	they're like, why are you doing this?
1142520	1146320	And he says, because I want to hear your screams.
1146320	1149080	I'm like, what kind of motivation is that?
1149080	1150080	Ooh, pedophile.
1150080	1154960	It's like, that kind of uber generic bad guy thing kind of worked back in the day when
1154960	1158440	there wasn't a whole lot of way to flesh out the story, but I don't know so much now.
1158440	1164080	So it's got a very awkward story, and I cannot stand the little cute character Maru Maru.
1164080	1166720	I cannot stand what they did with his voice.
1166720	1168160	It's awful.
1168160	1172400	Otherwise, those little bitches aside, I mean, it is a good game.
1172400	1175560	If you're a fan of role-playing games and you have a 360, it's worth your time to check
1175560	1179960	out, because importantly, it comes down to how is the game, and the game is fine.
1179960	1182120	The music's really good and all that stuff.
1182120	1187360	I'm sorry, but that gameplay is boring, and it has led me to call it Blue Dragon.
1187360	1192720	I'm noticing DJ Disentery in chat says, because you want to hear their screams, sounds like
1192720	1197440	Shane's reason for shaking babies, referring to an earlier episode of the program.
1197440	1200400	Or just in general.
1200400	1201880	Why did you not like Blue Dragon?
1201880	1204240	You're someone that liked old RPGs, right?
1204240	1210520	But we've come so far, and then to be thrown this battle system that's absolutely boring,
1210520	1215120	it's just like, I don't know, it doesn't sit right with me.
1215120	1220720	And the pacing seems slow, and granted, this is all, the only thing I've played is the
1220720	1222520	demo that was on Xbox Live.
1222520	1226120	See, I don't think that, I think the demo, now that I've played the actual game, the
1226120	1227120	demo fucking sucks.
1227120	1230880	The demo is not a good representation of the game, I think.
1230880	1237600	I just, it looks overly generic, and not interesting.
1237600	1244400	And yeah, that Maru Maru guy is, like, the reason we have mute buttons on TVs.
1244400	1249600	I'm looking in the chat room here, Pika Uno says, Blue Drag On?
1249600	1250600	Get it?
1250600	1251600	Because it drags on.
1251600	1252600	Get it?
1252600	1253600	Yes, I get it.
1253600	1256600	So maybe you could call it Boo Drag On, maybe, I don't know.
1256600	1259160	I'm just going to stick with Boo Dragon.
1259160	1261960	Mark Tetsuya says, Does Blue Dragon have the original voice?
1261960	1262960	Is this an option?
1262960	1263960	Yes, it does.
1263960	1268480	You can choose the English language, a Japanese language, all with English subtitles, or you
1268480	1270020	can have French language.
1270020	1274080	So if you want all your characters to speak French, you can have that as well, which I'm
1274080	1275080	sure is interesting.
1275080	1277520	That might make the game a little better playing it in French.
1277520	1278520	You think?
1278520	1279520	Yes.
1279520	1281000	But I think that one guy's voice is still going to be very annoying.
1281000	1284320	But it would be.
1284320	1285320	That's literally what he sounds like.
1285320	1286320	It's horrible.
1286320	1287320	It would be French annoying.
1287320	1289320	It might be cool.
1289320	1296960	Sounds like teen girl squad.
1296960	1303240	Escapist in chat room says, Well, now to wait for Eternal Sonata and Lost Odyssey.
1303240	1305520	Eternal Sonata is going to be awesome, but this will hold me over.
1305520	1309880	That was the best thing about Blue Dragon is inside the case was a card pimping out
1309880	1314320	Eternal Sonata, because that's a good game.
1314320	1317040	But again, you're basing your opinions on these games off a demo.
1317040	1318040	How dare you?
1318040	1319040	I'm watching you play it.
1319040	1321480	By Eternal Sonata, you haven't even played the real game yet.
1321480	1322480	You've only played a demo.
1322480	1325040	And it was the best demo ever.
1325040	1326040	I'm trying to think.
1326040	1328800	What were some good demos that were bad games?
1328800	1330120	Loki, help me out here.
1330120	1331760	Good demos that were bad games.
1331760	1334480	Can you think of anything?
1334480	1336320	I know there's got to be something.
1336320	1339840	I'm going to think about this one.
1339840	1341840	Chat room, I need your help.
1341840	1344400	Good demos, bad games.
1344400	1345800	Did Perfect Dark have a good demo?
1345800	1347280	I don't know.
1347280	1349640	Perfect Dark Zero, sorry.
1349640	1352440	Not to be confused with the original Perfect Dark, sorry.
1352440	1353440	Cameo maybe?
1353440	1354440	I've never played that.
1354440	1356240	Escapist says Final Fantasy 12.
1356240	1357760	I freaking love Final Fantasy 12.
1357760	1358760	What are you talking about?
1358760	1361440	Who that person from the chat room, because they're idiots.
1361440	1362920	Fireboma says Devil Dice.
1362920	1364840	I don't even know what that is.
1364840	1368280	Pika Uno says Cameo rules, shut the fuck up.
1368280	1369280	It's okay.
1369280	1370560	I wouldn't say it rules, but it's okay.
1370560	1371560	It rules.
1371560	1372560	It's sucking.
1372560	1374200	All right.
1374200	1377840	Let's get into tonight's gaming news, since we've talked about our gaming week for far
1377840	1378840	too long.
1378840	1380440	I was going to get into some housekeeping.
1380440	1383920	Pretty much the only thing I had to tell you guys was that we are doing a little bit of
1383920	1386720	drinking tonight, so if we sound a little off, that's why it's a three-day weekend.
1386720	1387720	Why not?
1387720	1389240	I'm just going to be off, period.
1389240	1392360	And that we are up on Operator 11, if you want to check us out there, or the archive
1392360	1393360	should be up there.
1393360	1394920	I don't know about this video quality, though.
1394920	1396160	It looks like it's running really slow.
1396160	1397240	We'll see, though.
1397240	1398240	I'm just moving really slow.
1398240	1400920	As long as it doesn't kill the screen.
1400920	1403680	We're not going to play to the camera, because we don't want to be a TV show.
1403680	1407480	We're still Orange Lounge Radio, but to answer the calls of our live listeners who wanted
1407480	1408960	us to get a webcam, we finally did.
1408960	1409960	So there you have it.
1409960	1410960	Wow.
1410960	1411960	Enjoy.
1411960	1412960	That's really...
1412960	1414220	I know.
1414220	1415220	That's really awesome.
1415220	1416220	Figure.
1416220	1417220	All right.
1417220	1418220	Anyhow.
1418220	1419220	Wow.
1419220	1420220	FootyMonster agrees with Final Fantasy XII.
1420220	1421560	I second Final Fantasy XII.
1421560	1422560	Demo was great.
1422560	1423720	Game sucked.
1423720	1424720	You guys are mean.
1424720	1425720	Yeah.
1425720	1426720	How about Final Fantasy VIII?
1426720	1427720	The game was awesome.
1427720	1428720	Yes.
1428720	1429720	How about Final Fantasy VIII?
1429720	1430720	I love Final Fantasy VIII.
1430720	1431720	Excellent example.
1431720	1432720	That is such a good game.
1432720	1433720	I don't even remember the demo.
1433720	1434720	Ruined by a battle system.
1434720	1435720	Where was the demo?
1435720	1436720	And the battle system was great.
1436720	1438720	The demo was with...
1438720	1439720	What did they put the Final Fantasy VIII?
1439720	1440720	Vagrant Story.
1440720	1441720	Was it really?
1441720	1442720	Yeah.
1442720	1443720	They put the Final Fantasy VIII demo with some other Square game.
1443720	1444720	I remember that.
1444720	1445720	All right.
1445720	1446720	Let's get into the gaming news.
1446720	1448840	I don't have any housekeeping otherwise.
1448840	1450800	Visit our website, OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1450800	1455500	Leave us five-star reviews on iTunes, pretty please, or elsewhere around the web.
1455500	1458220	Tell two people you know about our program, and so on and so on.
1458220	1459220	Live journal MySpace.
1459220	1460220	Add us there.
1460220	1461220	Blah, blah, blah.
1461220	1462220	Gaming news.
1462220	1463220	I don't know.
1463220	1464220	Can I?
1464220	1465220	You, Loki, or me?
1465220	1466220	You are.
1466220	1467220	I am.
1467220	1468220	Oh, crap.
1468220	1469220	Oh, because I have a follow-up to something we talked about last week.
1469220	1470800	Last week, we were talking about Mass Effect is getting delayed to December.
1470800	1471840	Well, guess what?
1471840	1476680	That turned out to not be true, because Mass Effect is now set to be released on November
1476680	1481320	20th, which is getting close to December, but not quite there yet.
1481320	1485680	So that should be out just in time for the big day after Thanksgiving holiday.
1485680	1488720	And of course, a lot of people definitely looking forward to this game.
1488720	1489720	They call it an RPG.
1489720	1492240	It's like sci-fi.
1492240	1496920	Looks to have a little bit of first-person shooter elements in it, though.
1496920	1500360	I don't want to call it a first-person shooter, but some elements is kind of mixed up.
1500360	1506560	I would say it's like what Phantasy Star Online should have been.
1506560	1507560	Sort of.
1507560	1508560	Except it's offline.
1508560	1509560	Well, we'll see.
1509560	1510560	You know, futuristic.
1510560	1511560	Wait, wait.
1511560	1513600	Phantasy Star Online or Phantasy Star Universe?
1513600	1514600	Either.
1514600	1516600	Phantasy Star Online was a great game.
1516600	1518720	Universe was a piece of crap.
1518720	1524060	I liked Universe's single-player story, and the fact that it was online was just a bonus.
1524060	1525960	But it was a little bit repetitive.
1525960	1526960	I'll give you that.
1526960	1527960	It was a little bit repetitive.
1527960	1528960	You didn't like online?
1528960	1529960	It was okay.
1529960	1532480	All you do is run around and hit things.
1532480	1533480	It was great.
1533480	1535280	It was fun to play with voice chat.
1535280	1536280	It was fun to play with other people.
1536280	1537280	It was a chatroom with swords.
1537280	1538280	It was a terrible game fight.
1538280	1539280	That's what it was.
1539280	1540280	It was a chatroom with swords.
1540280	1541280	Whatever.
1541280	1543280	At least they didn't move as funky as they did in the old Phantasy Star Online.
1543280	1545580	At least there's that much.
1545580	1549120	Anyways, something less exciting now.
1549120	1555840	Apparently there's some pictures that leaked out on Flickr of a new Xbox Live arcade game
1555840	1558360	featuring the Toyota Yaris.
1558360	1562720	Yes, those wonderful commercials featuring the car doing stupid things, yet not really
1562720	1564720	talking about the car.
1564720	1566120	Great.
1566120	1568760	It's going to be an adver game.
1568760	1569760	I don't know.
1569760	1572840	This was at, I think, some Toyota event.
1572840	1577920	I hope we don't pay for this because I sure as hell am not going to pay for this.
1577920	1580760	Now, is this a racing game?
1580760	1581760	What the hell would you do with it?
1581760	1582760	It looks like a racing game.
1582760	1583760	Is there screenshots?
1583760	1590880	Well, there are screenshots of a shot of people playing the game, but it doesn't really show
1590880	1591880	much.
1591880	1596600	It was at the Evolution FGC EVO West 2007 event.
1596600	1599840	Yeah, I don't know.
1599840	1606320	It doesn't really show me much and I could care less that this game is coming out.
1606320	1607640	Hey, you know what though?
1607640	1612720	If it's free and it's a decent racing game, I'm all about that.
1612720	1613720	Here it is for you.
1613720	1617600	If it's free and you can get achievement points from it, you'll totally play it until you
1617600	1618600	unlock everything.
1618600	1620840	Yeah, shut up.
1620840	1624060	You know what should be an unlockable feature in a Toyota racing game, though?
1624060	1627840	To be able to race Priuses, that would be awesome.
1627840	1629960	Don't you think, like Al Gore's Sun Mode?
1629960	1632400	Wouldn't that be fun?
1632400	1636440	I don't know how fun this is going to be, but they are making a brand new movie out
1636440	1641120	of another video game, because you know Hollywood loves to make movies out of video games.
1641120	1647760	CP Productions is a brand new Hollywood company and they have bought the rights to make Joust.
1647760	1653720	Yes, like Joust from 1983 or whenever that game came out.
1653720	1658120	Remember when you had the little lance and you tried to stab the pterodactyl in the mouth
1658120	1659960	and you hit the button to flap around?
1659960	1663800	It's actually a pretty fun game to play two player, and it's on Xbox Live.
1663800	1667080	That's right, they are going to make Joust the movie.
1667080	1670900	It's being made by producers Christine Peters and Michael Cerenzi.
1670900	1678600	They have worked on such notable films as Blackout and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.
1678600	1680680	Here's a quote from Cerenzi.
1680680	1685360	Joust is an arcade game that's as old as Pac-Man and has global awareness.
1685360	1690160	We took one element of the game and the brand itself and built a whole new world around
1690160	1691880	it for the film.
1691880	1694040	So you can guess what that element is going to be.
1694040	1697600	I hope it's the element of the hands coming up from the lava to pull people in the lava
1697600	1699600	because that was always cool.
1699600	1703440	And maybe they'll pull these producers in and make them not make this movie because
1703440	1705000	it's probably going to be bad.
1705000	1713380	I could see one of those, I don't know, just like a pseudo-futuristic jousting movie.
1713380	1715040	It's going to be boring is what it is.
1715040	1720480	I mean, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, fortunately I got dragged to that and that was a horrible
1720480	1721480	movie.
1721480	1723720	So, I don't know.
1723720	1725120	It's such a dumb idea.
1725120	1728120	Let's see, going to our chat room, chat.orensonshadeo.com.
1728120	1732040	Tiger Claw says, a movie about people riding on giant ostriches.
1732040	1738120	Articuya says, ostriches don't fly and Dark Knight says, fail in its future.
1738120	1740120	There you go.
1740120	1747000	Escapist says, Kate Hudson and her ostriches bicker for half the movie than Fall in Love.
1747000	1749000	Now that I'd pay to see.
1749000	1755760	Anyways, there's an interesting rumor going on regarding Guitar Hero 3.
1755760	1766080	Apparently another artist is in talks with Activision and Red Octane regarding, of course,
1766080	1771600	being in Guitar Hero 3 as one of the legends of rock to join up with the other people in
1771600	1772600	there.
1772600	1777920	That person is Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine, of course, obviously going to
1777920	1779080	be dueling against him.
1779080	1786200	I think right now it's still, they're in talks but hasn't fully committed yet.
1786200	1789200	But that'd be kind of neat.
1789200	1792960	They're getting down the line here so if they're going to put him in there, it's going to have
1792960	1793960	to be pretty soon.
1793960	1797240	Yeah, isn't that game coming out like next month or something?
1797240	1799760	Yeah, like around Halloween, seriously.
1799760	1802040	Are they just maybe holding on to some secrets?
1802040	1807760	Well, I mean, I can't imagine that there's too much development going into that game.
1807760	1812760	You don't really have to change that much other than putting songs in there and creating
1812760	1818640	the player models for these people that they're getting in there.
1818640	1823560	Coming soon to the Xbox Live Video Marketplace, Family Guy.
1823560	1827800	That's right, coming on September 2nd.
1827800	1829320	Is that today or tomorrow?
1829320	1830320	That's today.
1830320	1831320	That's today.
1831320	1832320	Well, holy crap.
1832320	1833320	It's coming out today on Xbox Live Marketplace.
1833320	1834640	That's freaking sweet.
1834640	1840640	Stewie Griffin, The Untold Story, and I believe episodes from, I don't know if it's, is it
1840640	1842880	every episode that's coming up on Xbox Live?
1842880	1843880	I think it is.
1843880	1845120	Let me just save you some time.
1845120	1848720	Do not download Stewie Griffin, The Untold Story, whatever that is.
1848720	1849720	Wasn't that bad?
1849720	1850720	It is horrible.
1850720	1854900	It's just three episodes strung together and it feels like three episodes.
1854900	1858920	It was not good, but Family Guy is good.
1858920	1864080	I like that they decided to put this on the Marketplace at the height of its popularity.
1864080	1868320	Being sarcastic because nobody should care about the show anymore.
1868320	1872760	Well, isn't it ironic, though, that the show is so damn popular and then it came out, it
1872760	1873760	got canceled or whatever.
1873760	1878200	It was more like a cult thing, then it got canceled, then it was popular again on DVD,
1878200	1881620	like insanely popular, like it was like, you know, have you seen this, and then Fox brings
1881620	1885800	it back and it's funny for a couple weeks and then it just kind of goes downhill.
1885800	1886800	It's so funny.
1886800	1887800	I love it.
1887800	1888800	Really?
1888800	1889800	But here's the thing, though.
1889800	1890800	I don't watch it on Fox.
1890800	1892680	I watch three runs on Cartoon Network and TBS.
1892680	1894960	So you're still watching the old episodes?
1894960	1897560	I'm watching, well, they're older episodes.
1897560	1900640	It's basically when I don't get to catch the new episodes when they come out on Fox, they
1900640	1902760	play them a few weeks later on Cartoon Network.
1902760	1907380	And I think if you watch Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, your standards for entertainment
1907380	1913360	are a lot lower than most people's, because god damn, I don't know how some of those shows
1913360	1916720	survive on their late-night stoners watching that.
1916720	1917840	Tom Goes to the Mayor or whatever?
1917840	1920200	No, there's stuff that's a lot weirder than that now.
1920200	1921200	Really?
1921200	1922760	They're just scraping at the bottom of the barrel.
1922760	1924960	Now, it's a lot worse.
1924960	1929960	They actually have some perfect hair, or like, woman with perfect hair, and it's like some
1929960	1935560	weird perverted guy, and some anime chick, or something, I don't know.
1935560	1942340	So speaking of weird Japanese stuff, there's that Dreamcast shoot-em-up game that was coming
1942340	1944280	out, I guess, next year.
1944280	1948400	It's also coming out on Xbox Live Arcade in Japan.
1948400	1955080	So, it's pretty interesting, I guess it's one of the games called Trigger Heart Alexia
1955080	1962520	is coming to Xbox Live Arcade, and I guess it's the team behind a Sega Saturn shooter
1962520	1970160	game called Shin-ru, I guess, I probably butchered that.
1970160	1976680	That's pretty awesome, and I will definitely be using my Japanese account to buy that game.
1976680	1980160	If you buy a game on the Japanese Xbox Live accounts, can you play it on the American
1980160	1981160	accounts?
1981160	1982520	Does it work that way?
1982520	1983860	Um, maybe.
1983860	1989920	What you can do is you can download the demo on the Japanese account, and then you register
1989920	1997380	it on the US account, because if you download a game and you purchase it on another account,
1997380	2003080	it's a demo on the other accounts, so what you can do is I download it on the Japanese
2003080	2006680	download the demo and then register it on the US one. That should work.
2006680	2012960	Interesting, I think. Alright. Also coming to Xbox Live Arcade very soon, it's in this
2012960	2017440	next week, Fatal Fury Special finally makes its way to Xbox Live Arcade, which
2017440	2020360	I'm actually pretty excited about because Fatal Fury Special is a game I
2020360	2023360	actually really enjoyed back in the day, so I'm excited to see this game finally
2023360	2029240	make its way to Xbox Live. Cyberball 2072. This was not a game I'm so fond of, but I
2029240	2031640	bet there's a lot of people out there that are into this game.
2031640	2035480	It's like that futuristic football game that Atari put out many
2035480	2039240	years ago. I think it runs on the same hardware as games like 720, and those
2039240	2043560	games did. So that game is coming out to Xbox Live Marketplace. What should be also
2043560	2046920	noted, though, is that there's a Labor Day sale going on on Xbox Live
2046920	2051400	Marketplace right now, and you can get certain games for half price. Small Arms
2051400	2056880	and Zuma are 400 Microsoft points apiece this weekend, and Gauntlet and Dig Dug
2056880	2062400	are 200 points a pop through Monday at 5 o'clock. So if you're listening to us
2062400	2066680	live or on the podcast, you might want to hurry up and grab those if you want them.
2066680	2072920	I don't know. I mean, even at 200 points, that's, what, 250? Eh, I don't know. Gauntlet and Dig Dug
2072920	2076160	are both decent games. I don't know. I think Gauntlet is fun, like it's a
2076160	2078980	nostalgia thing for, like, the first two times you play it, and then you're like,
2078980	2082840	I'm done with this now. Dig Dug is a classic, though. I don't know. I guess it
2082840	2088000	depends how strongly you feel about retro titles. Yeah. Anyways, there are some
2088000	2091800	pictures that leaked out, or I wouldn't really say leaked out, went out on the
2091800	2097060	internet showing that, yes, the elites can also crap out as well and get the
2097060	2102240	wonderful three rings of death. Although, I'm not too surprised, though, seeing that
2102240	2106960	they're showing, I guess, a kiosk. Now, I'm not sure what kind of ventilation those
2106960	2110700	kiosks have, but just looking at it, I mean, doesn't look like there's much
2110700	2114640	airflow in that at all, and depending on what they're running, no wonder that
2114640	2124360	thing overheated. So, I don't know. Xbox 360s die. They'll get replaced. Live. I guess as
2124360	2127320	long as they give the three-year warranty with those, right? Oh, yeah, they
2127320	2131700	still do the warranties on all of them, so, I mean, apparently they're stepping up
2131700	2135900	things to make sure that their turnaround time's a lot less, but... And aren't
2135900	2139360	they, like, giving away free Xbox Live or something with that, too? They are. They're
2139360	2144760	giving away, when you actually return the system, you'll get a free card for one
2144760	2150440	month of Xbox Live, valued at probably, like, five bucks. Now, is that something
2150440	2156080	that you can extend your current Xbox Live account with? I'm not sure if you
2156080	2160200	can extend your current one. I'd imagine you would, because it's just those
2160200	2171600	redeemable cards, the gold subscriptions. So, I'm not sure, but... Alright, well, one
2171600	2175080	thing I'm looking forward to playing on the 360 at some point is Tekken 6.
2175080	2178920	Hopefully it's coming to the 360, and they said, yep, I seem to remember they announced
2178920	2183720	it's coming to both systems. I don't know if it's coming to the 360 yet,
2183720	2187760	because I think that the arcade game's actually running off of PlayStation 3
2187760	2192680	hardware, so... Don't! No, we'll see. Well, anyway, Tekken 6 is still on its way. I guess...
2192680	2198000	I probably have a PS3 by then, anyway. Yeah, Dartusuius says, are you sure you're
2198000	2201240	not thinking of Virtua Fighter 5? Maybe I am. Yeah, Virtua Fighter 5's coming out in
2201240	2205880	October. Well, Tekken 6 is on its way, and there's a brand new fighter that's been
2205880	2211800	announced for Tekken 6, and that's Bob. Yes, he has the very unique name of Bob,
2211800	2216640	but the cool thing about Bob, he's a chubby. He's a chubster, and you don't see
2216640	2221120	a lot of fat guys in video games, especially in fighting games. Doesn't he
2221120	2225440	sort of resemble Mario with bleached hair? Kinda. Here's a picture of him right
2225440	2227880	here. He does kind of look like Mario with bleached hair. He's got the blue
2227880	2232280	jeans and a red shirt and suspenders, and then bleached hair. But, you know, the only
2232280	2235920	fat guys I can think of in video game history would be like, you know, Raiden
2235920	2239880	from... I think he was in one of the Neo Geo fighting games. I think he was in the
2239880	2245440	first Fatal Fury, I think. And there was... What other big fat guys were there?
2245440	2250240	T-Honda. T-Honda, but he wasn't fat. He was... He was a sumo wrestler. Yeah. There you go.
2250240	2255160	Karnov is what Jirnami says in chats. There you go. Yes, I guess he's a
2255160	2261400	stereotypical American, according to Nintendo Maniac 64. According to Japanese
2261400	2266760	Arcadia Magazine, who actually kind of broke the news on this, Bob used to be
2266760	2270460	into conventional beauty, but he got frustrated by how his size limited him,
2270460	2279340	so he got super fat. You go, boy. Awesome. Now what else is pretty neat? That Tekken
2279340	2286160	5 online is now online. And yes, it's kind of funny, but you can now download,
2286160	2294100	and not for free, but for $10, you can download and get survival mode, and then
2294100	2301360	I guess a practice mode, and of course the online mode. So, yay! They broke it and
2301360	2307560	then make you pay $10 to fix it. Hooray. Do you have Tekken on the PlayStation
2307560	2311600	Network? Fuck no. Because you know I don't even have a PlayStation 2. I'm not spending like 15 bucks for a
2311600	2317080	crippled game. I'm not really a Tekken fan. I mean, I don't play fighting games
2317080	2325200	that much, so much less do I play PlayStation 3 games much. All right, well,
2325200	2329440	one thing we like to do is we like to open up ye old mailbag once in a while
2329440	2333000	and read some of our favorite emails. Sadly, Dark Soccer is not here tonight, so
2333000	2338800	she's not here to read the emails for us, but I'm here, damn it. I'll read the emails.
2342800	2347040	Again, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangelaundry.com is the place to do
2347040	2355480	it. Our first email tonight comes from AZHP, and AZHP says, hey OLR, random
2355480	2359200	thought from last week's show that I forgot to say on the skype line. Saw the
2359200	2363560	live feed for about five seconds before live 365 got cut off and you killed the
2363560	2369680	operator. 11 feed. Rob is hot, call me later. Well, thank you.
2369680	2374080	That's awkward. Yeah, a little bit. P.S., just kidding. Keep up the great
2374080	2383560	podcasting. Less awkward. Funny. Let's go to another email. This email comes to us
2383560	2390160	from Ali. It could be Ali, actually. I think it's Ali. In episode 244, part A, you
2390160	2393760	got an email from someone who said your show is calming, and Rob exclaimed, I
2393760	2396360	don't understand. How is this show calming? This show makes me want to do
2396360	2400680	vehicular manslaughter to my cousins. I second that calming effect. I've been
2400680	2403960	doing the endurance races in Forza while listening to podcasts, and I must say,
2403960	2408400	it is when I listen to yours that I don't want to kill my Xbox. It cheats. Now
2408400	2412800	I need to say F you to my local EB Games. It is situated in a local burg separated
2412800	2417480	from the city, which is illegal to trade video games if you are under 18, and you
2417480	2421680	must have photo ID to trade video games. In other words, when I went to take my
2421680	2425680	stack of old Xbox games that have no replay value in to get Forza, I had to go
2425680	2430620	back home, drag my mom to EB, and make her show them her driver's license so I
2430620	2436640	could buy the E-rated Forza Motorsport 2, WTF. I would have called in to deliver
2436640	2440040	that rant, but I'm never home when you guys tape. Also, am I the only one who
2440040	2444180	finds the mouse acceleration and Bioshock unbelievably frustrating? I love
2444180	2448620	how in Battlefield 1942, Half-Life 2, and Counter-Strike, the mouse response is
2448620	2453000	snappy and rigid, but Bioshock has some weird acceleration built into it, or is
2453000	2456960	it because I'm playing in Vista? Oh, by the way, I'm playing Bioshock on my
2456960	2462560	dual-booting MacBook Pro. Suck it, Loki. Love the show, except the Mac hating, Ali.
2462560	2469320	There you go. Another fan mail for Loki. Well, maybe it's because he's doing that
2469320	2472440	whole dual-booting thing that his mouse is so screwed up. No, I have no idea. I
2472440	2476880	have not been able to play. Bioshock won't even run on my archaic PC, so I
2476880	2479920	couldn't tell you, but I'm curious, chat room, maybe is there somebody in chat
2479920	2482240	that's playing Bioshock on the PC that would care to enlighten us? Does the mouse
2482240	2485680	feel weird to you guys? What do you guys think about his other story where he
2485680	2489080	says that you cannot trade video games if you're under 18? You have to have
2489080	2492240	photo ID to trade games. You probably have a lot of theft of video games and
2492240	2495000	stuff, and people are just tired of dealing with it. So they're blaming the
2495000	2500640	damn kids. Yep, it's those damn kids. They make laws for reasons, so, you know,
2500640	2505400	obviously they've had reason to make such a law because, you know, they were
2505400	2510200	getting too much theft or people turn in stuff. I could understand needing a photo
2510200	2515160	ID. I don't understand the 18 thing, but... I think all of them require photo ID. Yeah,
2515160	2521080	they do now, so, I mean, 16 and up, I can see that. All right, well, let's go to the next
2521080	2526160	email. Goldbanjo14 in our chat room says, that law is bullshit. Let's go to the
2526160	2529200	next email in our mailbag. mailbagandorangelsrader.com. This one's not
2529200	2536920	signed, so I will attribute it to Nick C, and it's titled, I agree with Loki. Hi, my
2536920	2540880	name Nick, and I have been listening since I got a PSP when it first came and
2540880	2545560	found the OLR PSP website. I'm reading this as is, you guys. Wow, this is a
2545560	2550440	terrible email. I listen live once and a while and download the podcast all the
2550440	2553440	time. I'm thinking he typed it on his PSP, so I'm giving him a break.
2553440	2558160	So, listening to your podcast helped me out when buying a DDR game for my sister.
2558160	2564480	I agree with Loki on Apple. I hat every product made by Apple. People always get
2564480	2568720	made when I bash on Apple all the time, saying that Apple is good with their
2568720	2573640	crappy iPods and Macs that are overpriced. So, what do you think he meant
2573640	2579120	by hat? Was it hate or half? It's hate. I think it's half. It says, I hate
2579120	2582600	every product made by Apple. People always get mad, but I read it as is.
2582600	2586280	People always get mad when I bash on Apple all the time, saying that Apple is
2586280	2589520	good with their crappy iPods and Macs that are overpriced, and I hope they
2589520	2593560	unlock the iPhone so I can make fun of more people that bought an iPod that
2593560	2600120	makes calls. So, there you go, Loki. At least you have the bad grammar kids
2600120	2601120	agree with you.
2601120	2606800	Okay, you know, still though, you've got to admit, I mean, $600 for a phone?
2606800	2607800	Come on.
2607800	2613160	I mean, if it were a Microsoft phone, I would still be giving people crap for
2613160	2616360	it. I'm like, why the fuck are you spending $600 on a phone? That's what I
2616360	2617360	want to know.
2617360	2622360	Here's my thing. I'll tell you straight up right now. You know I love Macs and
2622360	2627160	all that stuff, so I'm not going to hate on it or whatever, but here's the
2627160	2630280	thing is that I did notice when I was at the airport this week, because I did
2630280	2634760	spend a lot of my week in L.A. this week, is that there are tons of assholes
2634760	2638040	out there with iPhones that don't even know how to use them. It's becoming
2638040	2643040	this trendy thing amongst men and businesswomen to use, and there's a lot
2643040	2645840	of assholes out there with iPhones, so go figure.
2645840	2646840	All right.
2646840	2651280	Because it's expensive and excessive, just like SUVs.
2651280	2655280	Hey, if you're an Apple fan boy, fan girl, and you bought one because you
2655280	2659960	want to support the great Apple in the sky, then go for it. It's all good.
2659960	2662880	No hate. No hate from here.
2662880	2669440	We'll do one more here. This is from Nate. Hi, Nate. Good day to you. I've
2669440	2672080	been listening to your podcast for a couple months now, starting with your
2672080	2675680	fifth anniversary show, and I find it very entertaining. I just want to let
2675680	2679600	you know that despite Sky's frequent admonishments of the show going off
2679600	2683280	subject, I find this very quality to be one of the most appealing aspects
2683280	2687400	of your podcast. I am but a poor commoner and don't have any of the next
2687400	2691640	gen systems, so I have to make do with the pre-DS and Wii Nintendo systems.
2691640	2696720	As such, a lot of the hot news regarding Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, etc., I
2696720	2699680	just don't have much interest in, although it is nice to keep up with
2699680	2702720	what's happening in the industry just for the sake of staying well informed.
2702720	2705560	Long story short, what keeps me coming back each week is the chemistry
2705560	2709260	between you guys, your weird but hilarious sense of humor, and yes, even
2709260	2714240	the bizarre rants and ostensibly off-subject forays into movies, comics,
2714240	2717960	social commentary, cat websites, etc. Oh, and of course, all that forbidden
2717960	2722200	sexual tension between Sky and Dark Sakura. Wow, that person obviously
2722200	2727080	doesn't listen to this show whatsoever. What? What? You may have missed a
2727080	2731720	small detail about me that would mean I would not think of Dark Sakura
2731720	2734640	like that, although I wish she was here to react to that. That would be
2734640	2736680	kind of funny. I'm going to leave that in the mail bag and see if she
2736680	2740000	reads it next week. And then he closes with, keep up the good work.
2740000	2746160	Thank you very much, even if that sexual tension is extremely misplaced.
2746160	2751240	Maybe I could do one more. One more? All right. One more from Nintendo
2751240	2756040	Maniac 64. Oh, boy. I've already said this twice in chat, but honestly,
2756040	2760080	this is important in my opinion. In the final area in Super Metroid,
2760080	2764640	below the four boss statues, make sure you only save in the first save
2764640	2768040	room. If you save in the second one, you've already gone past a certain
2768040	2772000	point where there's a room where its door is gray and deactivated,
2772000	2774800	resulting in you being trapped, except for being able to complete the
2774800	2778120	game. This would prevent you from going back and collecting any power
2778120	2782640	ups you may have missed. Note, I learned this the hard way. I even had
2782640	2787240	all the reserve tanks and energy tanks. So, boy, you got screwed,
2787240	2793480	didn't you? Sorry, buddy. Sorry to hear it. All right, that's it for
2793480	2795880	e-mail. Again, if you want to send us an e-mail, mailbag at
2795880	2802200	orangelaundry.com is the place to do it. Yes. Anyways, we touched on
2802200	2806680	this a little bit, I think, last week and a few weeks before. Neo Geo
2806680	2810800	titles are confirmed to be coming to the Virtual Console and as soon as
2810800	2815440	this month. In fact, September 11th, you'll be getting a few games,
2815440	2821880	including Fatal Fury, Magical Lord, and God, I can't remember the last
2821880	2827320	one. World Heroes. Those are each going to cost a whopping 900 Wii
2827320	2831920	points. No word on whether they're coming to the US. I imagine at some
2831920	2836720	point they will. Magical Lord is fucking awesome. I'm glad to see
2836720	2841040	that's, you know, in the initial allotment there, because I remember
2841040	2844680	playing that a lot. For some reason, you know, these grocery chains
2844680	2850080	around here had Neo Geo machines a while back, so while my parents were
2850080	2853640	checking out, I would be playing Magical Lord. I would think it's
2853640	2858440	inevitable that the game's going to come at some point. Yeah. State
2858440	2862840	side, I mean. But we'll see. We shall see. Alright, let's get on with
2862840	2866960	some release dates and things that you can check out long before these
2866960	2869960	Neo Geo games come state side. Although, we are going to start with the
2869960	2873440	Japanese release dates, so I guess we're doing things a little backwards.
2873440	2877080	Coming out on the Xbox 360, Fatal Inertia is coming out on September
2877080	2882080	6th, and that's, again, in Japan, if you want to check that game out.
2882080	2885920	Going over to some other systems, on the Nintendo Wii, there's this
2885920	2892160	game called Shin Chuka Taisen, Maikel to Meme no Boken, which is
2892160	2895800	coming out from Starfish, and this looks to be a game. I'm trying to
2895800	2898760	look at some of the screenshots. Looks like a little bit of a side
2898760	2903400	scroller, action-y type game, like a throwback to an old, you know,
2903400	2908120	like Mario type game. That's kind of cool. I wonder if they'll bring that state side.
2908120	2911440	Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii, nothing this week, but we can go
2911440	2915560	over to the PlayStation 3, and I can tell you that there is another
2915560	2921200	Pachinko game coming out. There's always something coming out.
2921200	2924200	And then, let's see, going to the PlayStation 2. Now, there's a lot of
2924200	2928500	stuff on the PlayStation 2, including Grand Theft Auto Liberty City
2928500	2931840	Stories finally making its way to the Japanese PlayStation 2 this week.
2931840	2936480	Also, Dear My Son, but that's S-U-N, Sun, is coming out this week, as
2936480	2942400	well as EA Sports Rugby 08, and Willow Wisp is coming out as well on
2942400	2948220	the PlayStation 2. Going over to the Nintendo DS, Theta is coming
2948220	2955380	out this week, and also a game from Bandai called, well, let's just
2955380	2957920	call it Mahjong, because that's what it is. It's a Mahjong game.
2957920	2966440	Let's just leave it at that. Really quickly, seeing if there's anything
2966440	2969680	on the PSP worth mentioning, Sony's putting out a game called
2969680	2974200	Rezel Cross. That might be kind of interesting. It's an RPG, and it's
2974200	2979080	from Sony themselves. The script is written by the folks who did
2979080	2982280	Ark the Lad 3 and 4, so if you like Ark the Lad, you might like this
2982280	2984480	game. There you have it, Japan releases.
2984480	2990600	In the US, on PlayStation 2, I hope you like Naruto, because Naruto
2990600	2994880	Uzumaki Chronicles 2 is the only PS2 game coming out this week.
2994880	2998020	On other systems, though, let's see, 360, we've got Medal of Honor
2998020	3003240	Airborne that's also coming out on PC. Stranglehold is also coming out
3003240	3007360	on Xbox 360, both the standard and collector's edition.
3007360	3012320	On PSP and DS, Worms Open Warfare 2, because the Worms games are
3012320	3016320	awesome. And, let's see here, on PlayStation 3, you
3016320	3022600	get a big fat nothing. And then, of course, on the Wii, Pool Party,
3022600	3026800	and no, that's not with water, that is billiards.
3026800	3031240	And, let's see, also on the DS, Garfield Nightmares, which I'm sure
3031240	3038320	is awesome, and PC games, two games that I have to love, I guess.
3038320	3043200	I Love Kittens and I Love Puppies. Hooray, I Love Kittens, that sounds
3043200	3048040	like fun. Let's see, other fun games, is there a Tycoon
3048040	3052480	game this week, because I'm going to be very disappointed if there is
3052480	3060600	not. And, no, no Tycoon game.
3060600	3064760	Nice, sorry to hear it. Well, going over to European release dates,
3064760	3067320	since Dark Sakura is not here, I still got a lot of love for you,
3067320	3070120	Europe. I'm going to go and look at your release dates real quick.
3070120	3073440	On the 7th, all these games on the 7th, Blazing Angels coming out on
3073440	3076140	Xbox 360 and the PC. This would be the secret missions from
3076140	3080060	Ubisoft. Crazy Taxi Fair Wars on the PSP.
3080060	3083640	Two Worlds makes its way to the PC and the Xbox 360.
3083640	3088600	And Valkyrie Profile 2 Slumera is coming out on the PlayStation 2.
3088600	3091520	God, that game came out over here like a year ago, didn't it?
3091520	3093760	Just about. God, it's about time you guys got it.
3093760	3097100	Sorry to hear it, folks. Alright, well, that's it for release dates.
3097100	3099760	Not that I think it's a real big disappointment that they haven't gotten
3099760	3101720	it yet. Well, there's some Valkyrie Profile fans
3101720	3107800	out there, I'm sure are sad. Anyways, there's an interesting game coming
3107800	3114200	out in Japan, of course, because, God forbid, you know, that something
3114200	3120120	like this come out over here. It's created by the team, Sega's Feel the
3120120	3124880	Magic team, and it uses voice recognition technology to decipher how
3124880	3133280	people really feel. It's called Koroko Scan, and apparently they
3133280	3139680	have a hilarious clip on YouTube that's talking, they're interviewing, I guess,
3139680	3145240	a girl and her boyfriend, and they were asking, I guess, how he feels
3145240	3151280	about living together and marriage and stuff like that, and I guess it came
3151280	3158000	up that he was cheating on her or something. Well, yes.
3158000	3159920	I want to play with that game. That'd be fun.
3159920	3165080	Any chances might come out over here? Nope, but, hey, thank goodness that those
3165080	3171360	games are region-free, so, awesome. Oh, that's right, you said you'd have to
3171360	3174120	be able to read Japanese to actually play them, so what the hell?
3174120	3177880	It doesn't matter. Alright, well, this might be a little more
3177880	3182720	mainstream, and this is coming out on the Nintendo DS, I don't know when,
3182720	3185400	I'm assuming, sometime within the next year or so.
3185400	3190060	The Legend of Kage, Part 2. Some folks, if you don't know how to pronounce
3190060	3193520	things right, might call this Legend of Kage, because this came out years
3193520	3199200	ago on NES, but The Legend of Kage is coming out on the DS, a new sequel
3199200	3204360	to it, and this was something that was spotted in Famitsu Magazine with
3204360	3208340	some screenshots and everything, so, pretty cool.
3208340	3211080	If you like The Legend of Kage. I know that's a NES game that a lot of
3211080	3214160	people liked, so. I think it's on Virtual Console now, right?
3214160	3216880	I think so. Possibly.
3216880	3220640	I thought I saw that it was coming back to Virtual Console, so there you go.
3220640	3225440	Well, if you are looking for a game that's not so mainstream and definitely
3225440	3230920	a lot cheaper, you may be interested in Rose Camellia DS.
3230920	3236120	Now if you're not familiar of Rose and Camellia, it's a women's slapping
3236120	3241600	game that's a Flash game right now, but it is being ported over to the DS
3241600	3246080	via the homebrew community, and actually it's funny, the guy that's doing
3246080	3251840	it happens to be French and needs help finishing the game, but still
3251840	3256520	though, if you want to check it out, you can definitely check out the
3256520	3264560	free Flash game site, and it is BeyondDS.free.fr.
3264560	3268000	For the record, that game is fucking rad. The slapping game, I love that game.
3268000	3271200	Slapping game, yeah. I love the slapping game. Have you ever played
3271200	3274360	the slapping game, the Flash game, Shane? I know you've been checked out
3274360	3278200	at the show. I think I tried to play it at work once and
3278200	3280520	it wouldn't work right. I'm sorry to hear it. It's a fun game.
3280520	3285680	It sounds funny, because you slap women. But you're a woman slapping
3285680	3288200	the women, so it's okay. It doesn't matter. As long as the woman is
3288200	3291160	getting slapped, all is right. Wow, you can send those cards and letters
3291160	3297840	too. What's your email? Miklatov? Anyhow. Also announced for a Nintendo
3297840	3304040	platform, not quite as huh, but it's pretty cool nonetheless.
3304040	3309040	Coming to the Wii, Worms, a space odyssey. It's another game in the
3309040	3312260	Worms series, and of course it will be taking advantage of the Wii's motion
3312260	3316720	control system, but what's really cool about this, online worldwide play,
3316720	3319520	which is not something you've been seeing a whole lot of Nintendo releases
3319520	3323640	lately, so that is certainly very promising. This was announced by an
3323640	3327160	official press release from THQ Inc. this week. Buying it.
3327160	3331040	You're that big a fan of Worms. I love me some Worms.
3331040	3335760	Just an FYI, there is still the Worms Open Warfare 2 being made for the DS
3335760	3338840	and PSP. Wow, they must still really have a fan base for these games,
3338840	3340960	because they crank them out left and right. Oh yeah.
3340960	3349760	Are you buying all of these games, Logie? No, I bought the very first one
3349760	3353500	that came out on the PC years ago, and that's the last one I bought.
3353500	3360680	I think the last game I bought was for the PC, and it was Worms Armageddon.
3360680	3363240	They do have one of the Worms games on GameTap, so that's one of the ones
3363240	3366580	I've played too. I've been meaning to buy the one on Xbox Live
3366580	3372720	Arcade, but I haven't got around to it yet. Alright.
3372720	3378080	One game I'm definitely going to be around to buying is Manhunt 2, and of
3378080	3382640	course people are still pissed off that the game got re-rated down to an M.
3382640	3385760	They want to know why they're demanding answers, and guess what?
3385760	3390080	The ESRB says, uh-uh, we ain't giving you no fucking answers.
3390080	3394920	So here's their statement basically. The FTC, the National PTA, the Kaiser
3394920	3400740	Family Foundation, and the Peter Hart Research team have all found that
3400740	3405440	parents are overwhelmingly satisfied with the ESRB rating system, rather
3405440	3412620	than publicly second-guessing what is unmistakably a strong warning to
3412620	3417600	parents about the suitability of particular games for children, which
3417600	3424360	presumably neither Senator Yee or the CCFC have personally reviewed.
3424360	3429600	We feel that a more productive tact would be joining us in encouraging
3429600	3433380	parents to take their ratings seriously when buying games for their
3433380	3437000	children. You show them.
3437000	3439320	So in other words, no, yeah, they re-rate it.
3439320	3441840	What do they change to re-rate it? Well, fuck off.
3441840	3447040	You don't get to find out. Actually, they can find out if they buy
3447040	3450120	certain versions of the game in other countries and check it against
3450120	3454360	them. Or maybe they didn't change much at all. Maybe they appealed or
3454360	3457800	something and got it. It's freakin' okay. 17 and 18-year-olds, come
3457800	3461520	on. We've discussed this before. There's not much maturity difference
3461520	3467500	between a 17 and 18-year-old, okay? It's just one gets more held
3467500	3473080	accountable to certain things. But other than that, really, and the whole
3473080	3478400	ESRB rating system is all fucked up anyway, so big deal. It's mature now.
3478400	3480880	What the fuck do you want? They just want it banned because they're
3480880	3485000	fuckin' hypocrites. We want to ban everything. Keep our children
3485000	3489280	safe. Oh my God. I'm more impressed that they did it this quick.
3489280	3492080	I mean, we all thought the game was just not going to come out for like
3492080	3495300	a year now because of this, and it seems like not even a month later,
3495300	3499240	it's all fixed. So it makes me think whatever they change wasn't that
3499240	3502040	much. It wasn't that much. It was probably stupid things. Remember
3502040	3506000	when we talked about Lair last week and how they had to change stuff
3506000	3508820	to get a teen rating, they couldn't show blood, but they could show
3508820	3512920	people being burned alive. I mean, like there's a big difference there
3512920	3517360	or something. So it's just, it's really stupid the requirements that
3517360	3522000	they have. It's just like the, you know, MPA, it's all fucked up. But
3522000	3524680	I don't know. I like how these people that haven't played the game at
3524680	3528600	all can criticize, you know, the rating system or anything like that.
3528600	3532960	They have no clue on what's going on, yet they're just like, oh, we want
3532960	3535480	the game banned. It's horrible. They're going to be selling it to
3535480	3541760	children, you know, despite the fact that it's, you know, over 17. Who
3541760	3545200	cares? If it's being sold to children and you're a parent, you're going
3545200	3549360	to just be like, oh my God, he bought it. I can't do nothing. It's too
3549360	3553560	late. Jimmy's going to go kill people now. What they need to do is just
3553560	3556920	say, hey, where'd you get that game? I'm taking this back. Or break the
3556920	3559720	disc in half or something. I don't know. You have control over your
3559720	3563760	damn kids. Do something. It's like they act like their parents are
3563760	3567200	powerless. It's like, oh no, he's got it in his hands now. I can't take
3567200	3573880	it away from him. We're doomed. Lots of comments from chat here. Fire
3573880	3579520	Bulma says, won't somebody think of the children? Let's see. Escapist
3579520	3582960	says, maybe they just had to excise some extreme cut scenes to Manhunt
3582960	3587360	2 down to an M. Son of Dad speculates, Manhunt wasn't changed. It was a
3587360	3593480	publicity stunt. Interesting. GS 191 says, I'm 19. I don't feel any
3593480	3596880	more different than when I was 17. Sure, I learned a lot of things, but
3596880	3599600	these people forget that there's a lot of kids that know the difference
3599600	3602920	between real and fake. Yeah, but isn't it fair to say, unfortunately,
3602920	3605400	there's some that don't, and there's even some 20-year-olds that don't?
3605400	3609040	Shouldn't you be more worried about your kids going and having underage
3609040	3614360	sex and doing drugs and all sorts of things like that, rather than
3614360	3617640	playing violent video games? I would think that you would be more
3617640	3621960	encouraging of kids playing games that require them not to leave the
3621960	3626840	house to do malicious things. I don't know about you, but I think,
3626840	3633520	given the two choices, I'll take my kids playing violent video games.
3633520	3636480	Fire Bulma in chat has a funny comment that says, my precious, unique
3636480	3641400	snowflake would never do drugs. Or play these violent video games, I'm
3641400	3646160	sure. I mean, seriously, how dumb are people? Really?
3646160	3648600	Who doesn't enjoy a little bit of violence once in a while? Do you like
3648600	3653960	violence, Shane? Yes. You do? Okay, that's good. No, only sometimes.
3653960	3657240	Only sometimes? What types of violence do you like?
3657240	3660800	The stuff that doesn't look too real. I can't stand the real stuff.
3660800	3664840	Okay. All right. Just wanted to give you some... Violence against women.
3664840	3669080	I just... Again, those cards and letters. You want to hear a funny story?
3669080	3672480	Sorry. Sure, why not? This refers to last week when we were talking
3672480	3676560	about Imagine Babies. I actually talked to the company that's making
3676560	3679960	Imagine Babies. I think Ubisoft's putting it up. And I mentioned to them
3679960	3683920	about the baby shaking. They did not know that.
3683920	3688000	They didn't? I'm like, you can rock the baby with one part.
3688000	3690200	I'm like, and if you shake it really fast, you're actually shaking babies.
3690200	3694520	So it was fascinating. I don't want them to change that.
3694520	3696280	They're not going to change that. Okay, good.
3696280	3699800	Good job, Loki, ruining Imagine Babies. I know.
3699800	3706600	Good job, ass. Wow, this show has gone to all sorts of places.
3706600	3709040	I didn't think it would go tonight. It's because Jamie's not here to keep us
3709040	3715720	in check and make pouty faces. And flip me off.
3715720	3719640	A lot of controversy going around about E for All, specifically when it comes to Electronic
3719640	3721680	Arts. Here's what's interesting is that there was
3721680	3725880	word going around that Electronic Arts had dropped out of the show this week because
3725880	3729560	I guess they suddenly didn't show up in some advertising material for the show, which
3729560	3734840	started to make people go, well, gee, who's left besides Nintendo and Konami and a couple
3734840	3737920	others? But Electronic Arts was contacted a little
3737920	3743920	later in the week, and EA has reaffirmed that, yes, they are going to E for All.
3743920	3748100	So if you want a chance to play Rock Band early, you still have a chance, because obviously
3748100	3751400	if EA is going, they're bringing that game with them, because they've trucked it everywhere
3751400	3756560	the past couple months. As long as the show is still on and my badge
3756560	3760000	forwards to my new address, like it should, I am planning to go to E for All.
3760000	3762640	I've already registered and all that crap and got the time off work, so...
3762640	3766320	I haven't registered yet, but I don't know if the wife would let me.
3766320	3770600	I should just register and just not go. Well, do whatever you want, but I'm going
3770600	3775120	to try and go, and if All Games is doing anything down there, I'm sure I'll hang with them.
3775120	3778960	Because otherwise I don't want to have to go by myself. It's going to be sad.
3778960	3783220	Shane, I might have to drag you with me if you can. Go. I don't know. Depending on what's
3783220	3787720	going on. Alright, well anything else in this Part A?
3787720	3790560	We're kind of running a short show tonight. I don't know what's up with that.
3790560	3793000	Oh, that's just Part A. That's just Part A. That's right. There's
3793000	3796040	plenty more to come. Tonight in Part B, we're going to be playing
3796040	3799240	a little bit of Beat the Host. So you might want to get your phones nearby
3799240	3803720	or your Skype line ready, because we'll be taking the first caller to play Beat the Host.
3803720	3805860	Not now, but when we come back and we tell you to call in.
3805860	3808560	And if you haven't heard Beat the Host, it's a lot of fun.
3808560	3812020	Stay tuned for tonight's Beat the Host. We'll be right back in a little bit with
3812020	3814020	more of Orange Lounge Radio.
