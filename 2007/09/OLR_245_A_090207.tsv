14037	23915	Tonight, September 2nd, 2007, Xbox Live gets a Labor Day sale, PlayStation gets a SingStar bundle, and an old PC gaming classic is now free.
31576	36078	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36118	41160	We are that video game podcast dedicated to gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.
41200	45562	We are independently made and produced out of lovely Sacramento, California.
46002	53346	Joining you guys as always, my name is Rob Roberts and not joining us tonight sadly, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
53366	56987	She's not here tonight, she's celebrating her anniversary with her man Dan.
57408	60229	But joining us as always, say hello to Loki.
60929	61229	Yes.
61249	62169	How you doing, Loki?
62929	63710	I'm fine.
64470	65690	You're fine?
65850	67090	That sounded a little bit forced.
67951	68491	I'm doing okay.
68531	69251	All right, you do?
69391	69551	Oh.
69931	71931	So now we've downgraded from fine to okay.
71971	72391	What gives?
73712	76312	I'm running low of soda in this cup here.
76552	78233	But luckily, I brought two backups.
78973	80553	How much soda do you bring to this program?
80813	81293	Two cans.
81473	81853	Two cans.
82253	86494	All right, also joining us tonight, say hello to Miklatov, who is filling in in the big blue chair tonight.
86614	87094	Hello.
87194	87875	How you doing, Miklatov?
88035	88535	I'm fine.
88555	89555	What are you playing there on your PSP?
90128	91329	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
108789	110370	Well, you missed that one, I'm sorry to say.
129884	136627	But Operator 11 has some funky rules and it's supposedly going to shut off after 40 minutes and so we won't be able to archive until Part B again.
136947	140728	But the good news is that Operator 11 saves an archive of the file for a long time.
140768	148931	So if you're listening to the podcast and you wondered to yourself, I wonder what this looks like being taped live, you can go over to Operator11.com and look for our feed on there and see it.
149391	151732	I want to see how fat all the hosts look on camera.
151872	153513	And then you can love us long time.
154333	159958	Yes, you can I just named my island in Katamari What is your island in Katamari?
160871	161732	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
186041	187823	So I'm playing me and my Katamari.
188543	189504	And how is it?
189804	191766	I hate the controls a lot.
191926	197551	It's really bad to control, but it's still funny, and that's what really counts in Katamari.
197951	199052	And what else have you been playing this week?
199092	203036	Metroid Prime 3, which is the coolest.
203536	204957	Yeah, and what do you like about Metroid Prime 3?
206398	207519	It's fun.
208981	211182	What a very descriptive answer you're giving us here.
211203	212724	Well, that was a terrible question.
214107	217949	Sorry, why do you think Metroid Prime 3 is so fun?
218009	219991	What is it about the game that appeals to you?
220031	237983	Well, I like the fact that the controls are really cool and I like the Metroid Prime series and I like the fact that, spoilers are coming up, I got to fight Ridley and it was really fun and I had to shoot him in his mouth and I was falling down this big shaft the whole time and it was really cool.
239578	241199	So you have to fight somebody while you're falling down?
241259	241479	Yes.
241639	243059	Is there a chance that you'll ever hit the ground?
243299	244380	Probably not.
244420	247060	I think you fall forever until you beat Ridley or Ridley kills you.
247280	247560	All right.
248721	250541	Also, is there anything else you're giving me?
250861	253102	I started playing Suikoden V again.
254402	259004	I've owned it since it came out, and I worked on it, but I never actually played it really.
259024	260144	Can you say what you did on the game?
260324	261284	Yeah, I've said before.
261985	262785	I don't remember.
263105	263885	I can't remember.
263925	265986	There's secrets you can say and things you can't say on air.
266006	266106	Okay.
267661	269964	and yeah, I'm just now starting to play it.
270405	273349	See, if I asked you if there was a Suikoden VI, could you talk about that?
273409	275071	I could not talk about that.
275211	276853	You can neither confirm nor deny those reports?
276873	277314	I cannot.
277534	278815	Alright, fine, fair enough.
279456	279857	Anything else?
281018	281178	No.
281699	283241	Alright, let's go over to Loki.
283641	286285	And while Loki talks about his gaming week, I'm going to go grab another cookie.
286837	287897	Do you want a peanut butter cookie, Loki?
287937	289357	Yes, I want a peanut butter cookie.
289377	290358	All right, I'm going to go get that.
290378	290998	Stupid cookies.
291318	292998	Loki, tell us about your gaming week.
293298	295919	My gaming week was a lot of Xbox 360 stuff.
296379	301500	I played a lot of demos, including some stuff I've already played before, like beautiful Katamari.
302080	308361	Ace Combat 6, I think I tried a little bit of Juice 2 and didn't like that still.
309301	315682	Then, of course, I played Bioshock, which is still awesome and continues to get even more awesome as I play it.
316440	319201	So definitely, ooh, cookie.
319722	323424	And let's see, other games I've played, Call of Duty 4.
323684	325785	I actually got to try a little bit of the multiplayer beta.
326765	329647	And I had no doubts going into it that the game's going to be awesome.
329907	331568	And it's just amazing.
332088	333649	It still plays like Call of Duty 2 and 3.
334269	340813	I do like how they've kind of updated the radar a little bit so you can actually kind of get a better idea where people are firing from.
341253	341973	So that was pretty cool.
341993	345315	And also the replays of when you get killed, they were pretty cool.
346053	347314	So that's neat.
347514	349336	And then other stuff.
349356	353379	I actually played more Settlers of Catan on Xbox Live Arcade.
354260	359704	And I thought about... Oh, I played Street Trace New York.
360384	365008	It's that hoverboard racing combat game or something.
365388	366649	That game's really weird.
367070	372254	Kind of reminds me of crossing Sonic Riders with that crappy...
373098	376880	Was it that bumper car game that came with Windows 98 or something?
376900	378401	I don't even remember what the hell that's called.
378841	379882	But something like that.
381043	382523	Not recommending that game, though.
382583	383764	It's quite boring.
384104	386846	But I tried the demo, and that was kind of fun.
388447	389047	Let's see.
389207	393249	Other stuff on PSP, I was playing a lot of We Love Katamari.
393730	395551	And I don't know why.
395571	401334	I absolutely hate the control in that game, but I'm stuck playing it and loving it.
402177	405040	The only thing I wish they would do is just port that to PlayStation 2.
405340	408503	Because I know they like doing those ports from PSP to PlayStation 2.
408783	409384	Just do that.
409844	413167	I mean, I'll spend the 20 bucks to actually buy the game.
413268	417091	So, I think that's what they need to do to make at least the controls a little bit better.
418232	421615	And other than that, I believe that was my gaming week.
421715	423097	Oh, Saints Row Multiplayer.
423577	426620	We finally, and I wish I had pictures because I haven't, you know...
427711	429052	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
454707	457708	Hopefully, they'll fix that with a sequel.
458168	458488	I don't know.
458648	463210	But hopefully, I'll get some actual pictures of the setup.
463630	472913	I'm still putting the 360s in clear cases, which, by the way, if I were to review the clear cases I bought, they absolutely suck, but they look pretty.
474793	475574	That was my gaming week.
475594	476854	That was a hell of a lot of gaming week.
477554	481415	There's a lot of comments going on in the chat room here at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
481455	484255	Again, our chat room location is chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
484595	488216	If you guys are in the Operator 11 chat, since we are doing the video tonight, I just want to get out there.
488576	493177	We do not read the Op 11 chat because it's on a laptop that's on the other side of the room and it's hard for us to read.
493197	493537	I forgot one.
493557	494557	You have to be in our regular chat room.
494617	494757	Yes.
494857	496397	I play Contra 4 for the DS.
496517	497157	How did you do that?
497917	502238	Our Konami rep brought in a DS with a dev thing in it.
502278	503238	That's kind of important.
504179	504739	That's a big one.
504999	505699	How is Contra 4?
506219	506879	It's awesome.
507609	511452	It's exactly like you would imagine a sequel to Contra 3 being.
511792	516236	I mean, it's true 2D side-scrolling action.
516256	517757	It's Contra.
517817	518457	It's awesome.
518998	525483	And not like that sort of awesome that was Neo-Contra and stuff like that.
526010	528533	But yeah, so that was pretty cool.
528594	534822	The other thing, I didn't play this game, but I dogged on it last week, Cruisin' for the Wii.
535142	539328	I actually saw the game in motion in a trailer, and it looked...
540729	542652	Not as bad, let me put it that way.
542712	544654	It looked very low poly count.
545135	549922	It almost looked like a DS game ported to the Wii, but it was running at 60 frames per second.
550062	555509	So while it may not have been too pretty to look at, it was really smooth and looked pretty fun.
555870	558393	So if it's cheap enough, I may try it.
558945	562228	I want to go back to Contra 4 for a minute because this is a game a lot of people are very excited about.
563429	564690	How does it use the vertical?
565230	566231	How does it use the two screens?
566291	567532	Is it just a very vertical game?
567552	568513	It's a very vertical game.
569013	570674	It's very tall.
570694	580702	If you'll see stuff falling down and you basically get to shoot at stuff, there's a grappling hook in it so you can grapple with stuff and crawl along bars and whatnot.
580722	582724	Does it use a touchscreen at all or did they just say fuck it?
583827	587849	Um, for the brief time that I had with the game, it did not use a touchscreen.
587889	591490	So you have no idea if they have the top-down modes like they had in the old Super Nintendo Contra?
591850	594371	I don't think they do, but it would be cool if they did.
594691	594991	Oh, okay.
595312	595672	Very cool.
596452	598633	Alright, well, um... Wait, wait, wait.
598673	598873	What?
599093	601654	Let's tell everybody what my new island name is.
602174	604195	Yes, on me and my Katamari, what did you name it?
604215	605755	I named it Pen Island.
606976	607956	Pen Island.
609397	610397	Think about that one for a minute.
610417	611338	Pen Island.
611378	612278	Pen Island.
612762	616646	P-E-N-I-S-L-A-N-D P-E-N-I-S-L-A-N-D
634409	635651	Did you get scared by BioShock?
656070	669291	I thought he was dead at first, you know, the first time they played through it, and then the second time I knew he was going to be there, so I turned around and just stood there for a second, and then he finally attacked me, but, you know, it was kind of freaky, you know, you turn around and all of a sudden, boom, there's someone there.
670343	673385	Piker Uno says, I got scared by the demo of Bioshock.
673705	675186	I did too a little bit, I have to admit.
675266	677927	I got a little bit scared from just the demo alone, because it's crazy.
677947	687311	The game gets so awesome, and I can't help but think Andrew Ryan, or can't imagine Andrew Ryan, the main guy who built this whole city, as Walt Disney.
688412	692394	It's like, I can replace Walt Disney in this, and just like...
693755	694195	I don't know.
694836	698258	You're going to make me not want to go back to Disneyland, and that makes me sad, because I love Disneyland.
698278	701420	It just reminds me, Andrew Ryan just reminds me of Walt Disney.
702821	704823	Or like a really weird version of Walt Disney.
704843	706204	Maybe they based it off him, who knows?
707304	712928	You know, I was hoping to get some emails from people who didn't like Bioshock, but I didn't see anything in the mailbag when I last checked.
713088	713569	So, I don't know.
713589	717651	We'll open up the email bag a little later and let you know if we heard from any people that didn't like Bioshock.
718472	718692	All right.
719723	722387	Anyhow, let's go ahead and go on to my gaming week.
722547	723468	I want to talk about my gaming week.
739059	740021	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
755962	760429	But this third game, I have to admit, the gimmicky controls are actually pretty awesome.
761191	764816	And done pretty well considering the limited amount of buttons that a Wii controller has.
765397	766018	It's pretty fun.
766439	769945	And I also like the fact that Metroid Prime 3 kind of breaks the mold of...
770498	771498	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
800746	808732	The scanning in Metroid Prime 3, it's not to tell you what's going on, it's to tell you now what you need to do to get through this room.
808772	814276	It's not like, oh, you know, there's lore stuff you can read, but... It's not mandatory.
814296	814977	It's not mandatory.
814997	824664	I did notice it was a little easier to get into story-wise than 1 or 2 was, because you could go up and you could talk to people, and it kind of made the story a little better for me.
825465	827186	It wasn't just scanning things and reading things.
828130	843972	also I will point out though scanning things appears to be the way that you get most of the tokens in the game I know there hasn't been a lot of talk about the tokens which a couple weeks ago was labeled by a lot of the big game blogs as like Metroid Prime's achievement system but it's not really achievements the tokens that you unlock
844352	845293	Thanks for watching!
862047	873531	Also, it uses WeConnect24 because for every 100 enemies you kill, you get a green token, and you can send the green tokens to other people, and they can use them.
873971	877152	Or I guess, no, it's a black token when you send it to someone else's green, or something like that.
877392	878853	But you have to use friend codes to make that work.
881475	886018	And then you said, Shane, you are pretty sure you got an actual achievement in the game or something.
886118	886599	Oh, yeah.
886759	888220	I was using my ice missile.
888260	890141	Hey, while I'm talking, smell this alcohol.
891322	892703	I'll talk about the alcohol in a minute, folks.
893964	897346	I was using the ice missile on just enemies randomly.
898907	899988	I want to drink it first.
900068	900588	Not yet.
900688	902469	No, I'm going to drink it first.
903030	903330	Okay.
905103	932725	and like I used the ice missile on some lizard thing and once I did that like a little one of the little cards you get for every hundred kills and I guess for certain random tasks you do came up and was like chilled lizard or something like that like you know a terrible achievement name and it was cool and that's I like that it's achievements and you know what you can do with that nothing absolutely nothing just like the Xbox 360 achievements
934269	935409	So, anyway.
936770	941291	By the way, the liquor talk is because it is a three-day weekend, so some of us have chosen to do a little drinking tonight.
941991	944952	Which leads me to the responsibility spiel.
944992	949913	Of course, we are all over 21, and Matt's not drinking tonight because he didn't find a designated driver.
950113	951613	I could have, but I figured that... Loser?
952033	952813	He's not into it tonight.
952833	957855	You said you were sick and were possibly not going to be drinking, so that's why I didn't want to be the only one.
958095	962696	Yes, I have been sick, but I figure it's only Tylenol that I'm taking, so I should be okay, right?
963036	963296	Well...
963991	968393	Yeah, unless you die, in which case then we would have been terribly wrong.
968814	970014	All right.
970074	970895	Well, anyhow, what else?
971935	975377	But Shane's here and Shane's drinking, although he doesn't like his blue drink, even though he likes the smell of it.
975397	975717	I like it.
975817	976558	I like the smell.
976598	980080	It's just like drinking an alcoholic blueberry muffin to me.
980640	981501	It's really weird.
981521	983121	You want to try this one, this pomegranate thingy?
983262	984162	I haven't drank from it yet.
984802	991566	I was going to say, we are all over 21 and we drink responsibly, blah, blah, blah, and kids shouldn't drink, blah, blah, blah, and so on.
991646	992286	So, yeah.
992847	993327	Is that any good?
994662	999613	I don't know if it's the combination of the two, but that tastes like that gamer fuel Mountain Dew to me.
999833	1000134	Really?
1000154	1002720	This is Pomegranate Fusion Smirnoff.
1002740	1004564	We're taking it easy tonight, so we'll see.
1005342	1005762	Blue Dragon
1027017	1027858	is a good game.
1028258	1029159	Is it a great game?
1029739	1029959	No.
1030500	1030780	Is it a 10?
1031380	1031621	No.
1031741	1035504	Is it going to leave a lot of people disappointed because they were expecting... Boo, Dragon.
1036044	1037505	Hold on, you can have your opinion in a minute.
1038166	1046892	Is it going to leave a lot of people disappointed because you hear these big names attached to it and you were expecting greatness or like a Final Fantasy XIII or something?
1047192	1048954	Yes, it's going to leave a lot of people disappointed.
1049074	1054478	But it's not a bad game by any means and certainly it's the type of game that the Xbox 360 is severely lacking.
1054858	1055719	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1078607	1079488	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1105567	1106128	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1124582	1125282	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1147421	1148141	Thank you for watching!
1168422	1171464	Otherwise, those little bitches aside, I mean, it is a good game.
1171784	1178648	It's certainly, if you're a fan of role-playing games and you have a 360, it's worth your time to check out because importantly it comes down to, you know, how is the game?
1178668	1179748	And the game is fine.
1179849	1181970	And the music's really good and all that stuff.
1182170	1187293	I'm sorry, but that gameplay is boring and it has led me to call it Boo Dragon.
1187653	1196438	I'm noticing DJ Dysentery in chat says, because you want to hear their screams, sounds like Shane's reason for shaking babies, referring to an earlier episode of the program.
1197432	1198853	or, you know, just in general.
1199873	1201775	Now, why did you not like Blue Dragon?
1201795	1203736	You're someone that liked old RPGs, right?
1204016	1209819	But we've come so far and then to be thrown this battle system that's absolutely boring.
1210439	1211100	It's just like...
1212384	1214685	I don't know, it doesn't sit right with me.
1214985	1217425	And the pacing seems slow.
1218126	1222467	And granted, this is all, the only thing I've played is the demo that was on Xbox Live.
1222527	1227008	See, now, I don't think that, I think the demo, now that I've played the actual game, the demo fucking sucks.
1227088	1230189	The demo is not a good representation of the game, I think.
1231189	1236591	I just, it looks overly generic and not interesting.
1237551	1240872	And yeah, that Maru Maru guy is like,
1241823	1242564	Blue Drag On Boo Drag On
1256696	1258217	I'm just going to stick with Blue Dragon.
1258978	1261900	DarkTetsuya says, does Blue Dragon have the original voice?
1261940	1262660	Is this an option?
1262700	1263201	Yes, it does.
1263561	1269585	You can choose the English language, a Japanese language, all with English subtitles, or you can have French language.
1269965	1274749	So if you want all your characters to speak French, you can have that as well, which I'm sure is interesting.
1274769	1277170	That might make the game a little better, playing it in French.
1277491	1277851	You think?
1277951	1278151	Yes.
1278271	1280853	But I think that one guy's voice is still going to be very annoying.
1281313	1282534	But it would be...
1284196	1285337	That's literally what he sounds like.
1285357	1287998	It would be French annoying, which might be cool.
1292560	1294721	Sounds like Teen Girl Squad.
1297002	1301665	Escapist in chatroom says, well, now to wait for Eternal Sonata and Lost Odyssey.
1302205	1305306	Yeah, Eternal Sonata is going to be awesome, but this will hold me over.
1305466	1312650	That was the best thing about Blue Dragon is inside the case was a card pimping out Eternal Sonata because that's a good game.
1314261	1315001	Good demos, bad games.
1344332	1345973	Did Perfect Dark have a good demo?
1346453	1346793	I don't know.
1347994	1348954	Perfect Dark Zero, sorry.
1349514	1351995	Not to be confused with the original Perfect Dark, sorry.
1352015	1352876	Cameo, maybe?
1353476	1354517	I've never played that.
1354557	1356257	Escapist says Final Fantasy XII.
1356297	1357438	I freaking love Final Fantasy XII.
1357478	1358198	What are you talking about?
1358218	1360599	Move that person from the chatroom, because they're idiots.
1361380	1362940	Fireboma says Devil Dice.
1363461	1364441	I don't even know what that is.
1364741	1366382	Piker Uno says Cameo rules.
1366482	1367102	Shut the fuck up.
1368183	1368663	It's okay.
1368703	1370324	I wouldn't say it rules, but it's okay.
1370524	1371244	It rules.
1371384	1372225	It's sucking.
1372485	1373025	Alright, uh...
1374002	1378423	Let's get into tonight's gaming news since we've talked about our gaming week for far too long.
1378803	1380203	I was going to get into some housekeeping.
1380283	1384284	Pretty much the only thing I had to tell you guys was that we are doing a little bit of drinking tonight.
1384304	1386645	So if we sound a little off, that's why it's a three-day weekend.
1386665	1387005	Why not?
1387265	1388805	I'm just going to be off, period.
1389126	1393006	And that we are up on Operator 11 if you want to check us out there or the archive should be up there.
1393387	1394847	I don't know about this video quality though.
1394887	1396047	It looks like it's running really slow.
1396527	1397007	We'll see though.
1397327	1398228	I'm just moving really slow.
1398248	1399328	As long as it doesn't kill the screen.
1400402	1403584	But we're not going to play to the camera because we don't want to be a TV show.
1403604	1404805	We're still Orange Lounge Radio.
1404865	1408868	But to answer the calls of our live listeners who wanted us to get a webcam, we finally did.
1408888	1409468	So there you have it.
1409869	1410229	Wow.
1410369	1410669	Enjoy.
1410909	1412510	That's really... I know.
1414092	1414932	That's really awesome.
1414972	1415252	Figure.
1415693	1415973	All right.
1415993	1416293	Anyhow.
1417454	1417754	Wow.
1417834	1419795	FootyMonster agrees with Final Fantasy XII.
1419976	1421397	I second Final Fantasy XII.
1421417	1422097	Demo was great.
1422137	1422697	Game sucked.
1423678	1424439	You guys are mean.
1424999	1425700	How about Final Fantasy VIII?
1425720	1426180	Game was awesome.
1426716	1428097	Yes, how about Final Fantasy VIII?
1428117	1428798	I love Final Fantasy VIII.
1428818	1429678	Excellent example.
1429698	1430379	That is such a good game.
1430399	1432600	Great demo, horrible game.
1432620	1433381	I don't even remember the demo.
1433401	1434782	Ruined by a battle system.
1434802	1435683	Where was the demo?
1435703	1439525	The demo was with... What did they put the Final Fantasy in?
1439545	1440106	Vagrant Story.
1440146	1440586	Was it really?
1440846	1441567	Yeah.
1441587	1443548	They put the Final Fantasy VIII demo with some other Square game.
1443929	1444389	I remember that.
1444789	1445810	Alright, let's get into the gaming news.
1446365	1447606	I don't have any housekeeping otherwise.
1448566	1450327	Visit our website, orangelaunchradio.com.
1450667	1455029	Leave us five-star reviews on iTunes, pretty please, or elsewhere around the web.
1455369	1458030	Tell two people you know about our program and so on and so on.
1458050	1459471	Live journal, MySpace, add us there.
1459831	1460371	Blah, blah, blah.
1460771	1461292	Gaming news.
1461472	1462352	Who's starting us off tonight?
1462412	1463133	You, Loki, or me?
1463193	1463693	You are.
1463833	1464173	I am?
1464333	1464793	Oh, crap.
1465093	1466094	Oh, because I have a follow-up.
1466594	1467315	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1482944	1485264	for the big day after Thanksgiving holiday.
1485625	1488085	And, of course, a lot of people definitely looking forward to this game.
1488685	1490005	They call it an RPG.
1490085	1491306	It's like sci-fi.
1492006	1496687	It looks to have a little bit of first-person shooter elements in it, though.
1496967	1498867	I don't want to call it a first-person shooter, but some elements.
1499507	1504908	It's like, I would say, it's like what Phantasy Star Online should have been.
1506389	1506709	Sort of.
1507029	1507889	Except it's offline.
1508029	1508589	Well, we'll see.
1509540	1513104	Wait, wait, Fantasy Star Online or Fantasy Star Universe?
1513844	1514165	Either.
1514725	1516467	Fantasy Star Online was a great game.
1516607	1519169	Universe was a piece of crap.
1519790	1523814	I liked Universe's single player story and the fact that it was online was just a bonus.
1524414	1526176	It was a little bit repetitive.
1526196	1527737	I'll give you that, it was a little bit repetitive.
1527757	1528758	You didn't like online?
1529559	1531061	It was okay.
1531101	1532642	All you do is run around and hit things.
1532842	1534544	It was fun to play with voice chat.
1535265	1536206	It was fun to play with other people.
1536226	1537606	It was a chat room with swords.
1537626	1538327	That's what it was.
1538427	1539487	It was a chat room with swords.
1539527	1540248	Whatever.
1540488	1543429	At least they didn't move as funky as they did in the old Phantasy Star Online.
1543469	1544250	At least there's that much.
1545770	1548992	Anyways, something less exciting now.
1549112	1558077	Apparently there's some pictures that leaked out on Flickr of a new Xbox Live arcade game featuring the Toyota Yaris.
1558737	1563679	Yes, those wonderful commercials featuring the car doing stupid things yet not really talking about the car.
1564680	1564760	Um,
1565339	1567901	Great, it's going to be an adver game.
1568861	1571223	I don't know, this was at, I think, some Toyota event.
1573164	1576927	I hope we don't pay for this, because I sure as hell am not going to pay for this.
1578528	1581590	Now, is this a racing game, or what the hell would you do?
1581630	1582751	It looks like a racing game.
1582771	1583491	Is there screenshots?
1583911	1585913	Well, there's screenshots of...
1587409	1591252	A shot of people playing the game, but it doesn't really show much.
1591332	1595134	It was at the Evolution FGC EVO West 2007 event.
1595875	1599237	Yeah, I don't know.
1600457	1605981	It doesn't really show me much, and I could care less that this game's coming out.
1606417	1607358	Hey, you know what though?
1607598	1609120	If it's free, it's free.
1609200	1612343	If it's free and it's a decent racing game, I'm all about that.
1612463	1613364	No, here it is for you.
1613404	1618228	If it's free and you can get achievement points from it, you'll totally play it until you unlock everything.
1618388	1620450	Yeah, shut up.
1620771	1623693	You know what should be an unlockable feature in a Toyota racing game though?
1624034	1625475	To be able to race Priuses.
1625535	1626276	That would be awesome.
1627737	1628198	Don't you think?
1628258	1629739	Like Al Gore's Sun Mode?
1629939	1630560	Wouldn't that be fun?
1632435	1633376	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1648627	1653071	Yes, like Joust from 1983 or whenever that game came out.
1653431	1659577	Remember when you had the little lance and you tried to stab the pterodactyl in the mouth and you hit the button to flap around?
1659897	1661778	It's actually a pretty fun game to play two-player.
1662079	1663140	And it's on Xbox Live.
1663660	1666743	That's right, they are going to make Joust the movie.
1667063	1670526	It's being made by producers Christine Peters and Michael Cerenzi.
1670866	1675070	They have worked on such notable films as Blackout and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.
1675751	1675951	So...
1677628	1677988	Interesting.
1678549	1680050	Here's a quote from Sirinzi.
1680790	1684733	Joust is an arcade game that's as old as Pac-Man and has global awareness.
1685294	1690878	We took one element of the game and the brand itself and built a whole new world around it for the film.
1691818	1693840	So you can guess what that element's going to be.
1694180	1698543	I hope it's the element of the hands coming up from the lava to pull people in the lava because that was always cool.
1699544	1704428	And maybe they'll pull these producers in and make them not make this movie because it's probably going to be bad.
1705057	1712942	I could see one of those, I don't know, just like a pseudo-futuristic jousting movie.
1713283	1715004	It's going to be boring is what it is.
1715064	1716605	I mean, how to lose a guy in 10 days?
1717085	1722349	Fortunately, I got dragged to that, and that was a horrible movie, so I don't know.
1723648	1724828	It's such a dumb idea.
1725249	1725649	Let's see.
1725889	1728049	Going to our chat room, chat.orange.radio.com.
1728089	1731590	Tiger Claw says, a movie about people riding on giant ostriches.
1731950	1733971	Dark Tetsuya says, ostriches don't fly.
1734591	1737112	And Dark Knight says, fail in its future.
1738032	1738472	There you go.
1740133	1744434	Escapist says, Kate Hudson and her ostrich bicker for half the movie than fall in love.
1746980	1747960	Now that I'd pay to see.
1749241	1754883	Anyways, there's an interesting rumor going on regarding Guitar Hero 3.
1755743	1769027	Apparently, another artist is in talks with Activision and Red Octane regarding being in Guitar Hero 3 as one of the Legends of Rock artists.
1769498	1771680	to join up with the other people in there.
1772421	1775243	That person is Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine.
1775984	1778987	Of course, obviously going to be dueling against him.
1779187	1784772	I think right now it's still, they're in talks, but hasn't fully committed yet.
1786173	1789096	But that's kind of neat.
1789116	1793640	They're getting down the line here, so if they're going to put him in there, it's going to have to be pretty soon.
1795373	1797174	Yeah, isn't that game coming out like next month or something?
1797194	1798174	Yeah, like around Halloween.
1798495	1798895	Seriously.
1799755	1801796	Are they just maybe holding on to some secrets?
1802496	1806398	Well, I mean, I can't imagine that there's too much development going into that game.
1806458	1816043	I mean, you don't really have to change that much other than putting songs in there and creating the player models for these people that they're getting in there.
1817359	1817700	All right.
1818080	1823005	Well, coming soon to the Xbox Live Video Marketplace, Family Guy.
1823386	1823927	That's right.
1824247	1826329	Coming on September 2nd.
1826750	1827010	Today?
1827030	1828732	Is that today or tomorrow?
1828752	1829172	That's today.
1829192	1829753	That's today.
1829773	1830514	Well, holy crap.
1831167	1833029	It's coming out today on Xbox Live Marketplace.
1833069	1833910	That's freaking sweet.
1834550	1842898	Stewie Griffin, The Untold Story, and I believe episodes from, I don't know if it's, is it every episode that's coming up on Xbox Live?
1842918	1843398	I think it is.
1843698	1844880	Let me just save you some time.
1845080	1848663	Do not download Stewie Griffin, The Untold Story, whatever that is.
1848683	1849123	Isn't that bad?
1849524	1850184	It is horrible.
1850244	1854849	It's just three episodes strung together, and it feels like three episodes.
1854909	1855629	It was not good.
1857111	1857451	But, um.
1858977	1864256	I like that they decided to put this on the marketplace at the height of its popularity.
1865475	1866115	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1893587	1894968	So you're still watching the old episodes?
1894988	1897429	I'm watching, well, their older episodes.
1897509	1900391	It's basically when I don't get to catch the new episodes when they come out on Fox.
1900411	1902172	They play them a few weeks later on Cartoon Network.
1902692	1910317	And I think if you watch Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, your standards for entertainment are a lot lower than most people.
1911097	1916580	Because, god damn, I don't know how some of those shows survive on their late-night stoners watching that.
1916620	1917721	Tom Goes to the Mayor?
1917781	1920062	No, there's stuff that's a lot weirder than that now.
1920082	1922444	I remember when that was scraping at the bottom of the barrel.
1922504	1922844	Now it's
1923797	1924837	A lot worse.
1924857	1933200	They actually have some, what, there's like some, like, perfect hair, or like, woman with perfect hair, and it's like some weird perverted guy, and some anime chick, or some, I don't know.
1933780	1943382	Anyways, um, so, speaking of, uh, weird Japanese stuff, there's that Dreamcast shoot-em-up game that was, um, coming out, I guess, next year.
1944163	1949024	It's also coming out on Xbox Live Arcade in Japan, and so, um,
1950260	1951001	Pretty interesting.
1951021	1954524	I guess it's one of the games called Trigger Heart Alexia.
1955365	1957747	It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
1958347	1965353	I guess it's the team behind a Sega Saturn shooter game called Shinru.
1965393	1968937	I probably butchered that.
1970058	1971699	That's pretty awesome.
1972259	1975102	I will definitely be using my Japanese account to buy that game.
1976636	1980177	If you buy a game on the Japanese Xbox Live accounts, can you play it on the American accounts?
1980598	1981338	Does it work that way?
1982698	1983359	Maybe.
1983759	1990921	What you can do is you can download the demo on the Japanese account, and then you register it on the U.S.
1990982	1991282	account.
1992302	1998925	Because, you know, if you download a game and you purchase it on another account, it's a demo on the other accounts.
1999125	2004887	So what you can do is just register it on... I downloaded it on the Japanese account, downloaded the demo, and then registered it on the U.S.
2004987	2005067	one.
2005635	2006275	That should work.
2006715	2007096	Interesting.
2007216	2007496	I think.
2008316	2008696	All right.
2010057	2012318	Also coming to Xbox Live Arcade very soon.
2012378	2013638	It's in this next week.
2013978	2021861	Fatal Fury Special finally makes its way to Xbox Live Arcade, which I'm actually pretty excited about because Fatal Fury Special is a game I actually really enjoyed back in the day.
2021901	2024983	So I'm excited to see this game finally make its way to Xbox Live.
2025323	2026343	Cyberball 2072.
2026763	2031245	This was not a game I'm so fond of, but I bet there's a lot of people out there that are into this game.
2032371	2035953	It's that futuristic football game that Atari put out many years ago.
2035993	2039736	I think it runs on the same hardware as games like 720, and those games did.
2040137	2042238	So that game is coming out to Xbox Live Marketplace.
2042819	2050325	What should be also noted, though, is that there's a Labor Day sale going on on Xbox Live Marketplace right now, and you can get certain games for half price.
2050725	2058311	Small Arms and Zuma are 400 Microsoft points apiece this weekend, and Gauntlet and Dig Dug are 200 points a pop.
2059653	2061254	Dig Dug is a classic, though.
2061274	2061655	I don't know.
2061675	2064116	I guess it depends how strongly you feel about retro titles.
2064137	2064217	Yeah.
2086272	2098479	Anyways, there are some pictures that leaked out, or I wouldn't really say leaked out, went out on the internet, showing that, yes, the elites can also crap out as well and get the wonderful three rings of death.
2099840	2104783	Although, I'm not too surprised, though, seeing that they're showing, I guess, a kiosk.
2105364	2111828	Now, I'm not sure what kind of ventilation those kiosks have, but just looking at it, I mean, it doesn't look like there's much airflow in that at all.
2112228	2115410	And depending on what they're running, no wonder that thing overheated, so...
2117091	2118912	I don't know.
2118932	2120973	Xbox 360s die, they'll get replaced.
2121854	2122094	Live.
2123915	2126857	I guess as long as they give the three-year warranty with those, right?
2126897	2128738	Oh yeah, they still do the warranties on all of them.
2128798	2134641	So, I mean, apparently they're stepping up things to make sure that their turnaround time's a lot less, but...
2135595	2138517	And aren't they like giving away free Xbox Live or something with that too?
2138937	2139157	They are.
2139197	2146201	They're giving away when you actually return the system, you'll get a free card for one month of Xbox Live.
2146982	2148803	Valued at probably like five bucks.
2149703	2153605	Now, is that something that you can extend your current Xbox Live account with?
2155366	2157448	I'm not sure if you can extend your current one.
2157648	2163271	I would imagine you would because it's just those redeemable cards, the gold subscriptions.
2164372	2164592	So...
2165558	2167859	I'm not sure.
2170319	2171059	Awesome.
2171539	2174940	One thing I'm looking forward to playing on the 360 at some point is Tekken 6.
2175800	2177081	Hopefully it's coming to the 360.
2177181	2177701	They said, yep.
2177841	2179861	I seem to remember they announced it's coming to both systems.
2181382	2183082	I don't know if it's coming to the 360 yet.
2183102	2183662	No.
2184462	2188623	Because I think that the arcade game is actually running off of PlayStation 3 hardware.
2189924	2190284	We'll see.
2190624	2192404	Well, anyway, Tekken 6 is still on its way.
2192464	2195085	I probably have a PS3 by then anyway.
2196896	2199017	Dark Tatooine says, are you sure you're not thinking of Virtua Fighter 5?
2199338	2199778	Maybe I am.
2199918	2201939	Yeah, Virtua Fighter 5 is coming out in October.
2202259	2207843	Well, Tekken 6 is on its way and there's a brand new fighter that's been announced for Tekken 6 and that's Bob.
2208424	2212026	Yes, he has the very unique name of Bob.
2212346	2214788	But the cool thing about Bob, he's a chubby.
2215308	2220612	He's a chubster, and you don't see a lot of fat guys in video games, especially in fighting games.
2220752	2223694	Doesn't he sort of resemble Mario with bleached hair?
2223974	2224494	Kinda.
2224574	2225695	Here's a picture of him right here.
2225775	2227456	He does kind of look like Mario with bleached hair.
2227476	2230518	He's got the blue jeans and the red shirt and suspenders, and then bleached hair.
2231419	2239304	But, you know, the only fat guys I can think of in video game history would be like, you know, Raiden from, I think he was in one of the Neo Geo fighting games.
2239344	2241406	I think he was in the first Fatal Fury, I think.
2242546	2244968	And there was, what other big fat guys were there?
2245422	2274544	E-Honda E-Honda, but he wasn't fat, he was He was just a sumo wrestler Yeah There you go Karnov is what Drew Nami says in chats, there you go Yes, I guess he's a stereotypical American, according to Nintendo Maniac 64 According to Japanese Arcadia Magazine, who actually kind of broke the news on this Bob used to be into conventional beauty, but he got frustrated by how his size limited him, so he got super fat You go, boy
2275476	2275856	Awesome.
2276896	2278057	Now what else is pretty neat?
2278737	2282318	That Tekken 5 Online is now online.
2282898	2297061	And yes, it's kind of funny, but you can now download, and not for free, but for $10, you can download and get survival mode, and then I guess a practice mode, and of course the online mode.
2297301	2299642	So, yay!
2299762	2300022	They've
2300692	2304016	Broke it and then make you pay $10 to fix it.
2304036	2305237	Hooray.
2305538	2307920	Do you have Tekken on the PlayStation Network?
2307940	2308441	Fuck no.
2308461	2310343	Because you know I don't even have a PlayStation 2.
2310403	2312445	I'm not spending like $15 for a crippled game.
2314147	2315689	I'm not really a Tekken fan.
2315929	2317551	I mean, I don't play fighting games that much.
2319473	2322076	Much less do I play PlayStation 3 games much.
2324355	2331116	Alright, well, one thing we like to do is we like to open up ye olde mailbag once in a while and read some of our favorite emails.
2331176	2334457	Sadly, DarkSakura's not here tonight, so she's not here to read the emails for us.
2334997	2335937	But I'm here, dammit.
2336157	2336897	I'll read the emails.
2343639	2347219	Again, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangelongerator.com is the place to do it.
2348339	2351260	Our first email tonight comes from AZHP.
2353217	2358179	and AZHP says, Hey, OLR, random thought from last week's show that I forgot to say on the Skype line.
2358860	2364042	Saw the live feed for about five seconds before Live 365 got cut off and you killed the operator.
2364062	2364703	11 feed.
2365123	2365743	Rob is hot.
2365803	2366403	Call me later.
2367444	2369545	Well, thank you.
2370065	2370766	That's awkward.
2370926	2371726	Yeah, a little bit.
2372206	2372647	P.S.
2372747	2373467	Just kidding.
2373507	2374688	Keep up the great podcasting.
2374708	2375708	Less awkward.
2376889	2377109	Funny.
2378109	2379510	Let's go to another email.
2382554	2384675	This email comes to us from Ali.
2385195	2386156	It could be Ali, actually.
2386396	2386936	I think it's Ali.
2388557	2392459	In episode 244, part A, you got an email from someone who said your show is calming.
2392819	2394400	And Rob exclaimed, I don't understand.
2394440	2395401	How is this show calming?
2395441	2398082	This show makes me want to do vehicular manslaughter to my cousins.
2398922	2400083	I second that calming effect.
2400443	2403405	I've been doing the endurance races in Forza while listening to podcasts.
2403445	2407127	And I must say, it is when I listen to yours that I don't want to kill my Xbox.
2407287	2407627	It cheats.
2408354	2410355	Now I need to say F you to my local EB Games.
2410735	2419780	It is situated in a local burg separated from the city, in which it is illegal to trade video games if you are under 18, and you must have photo ID to trade video games.
2420280	2433426	In other words, when I went to take my stack of old Xbox games that have no replay value in to get Forza, I had to go back home, drag my mom to EB, and make her show them her driver's license so I could buy the E-rated Forza Motorsport 2, WTF.
2435620	2438222	I would have called in to deliver that rant, but I'm never home when you guys tape.
2438923	2443426	Also, am I the only one who finds the mouse acceleration in Bioshock unbelievably frustrating?
2443927	2452313	I love how in Battlefield 1942, Half-Life 2, and Counter-Strike, the mouse response is snappy and rigid, but Bioshock has some weird acceleration built into it.
2452813	2454335	Or is it because I'm playing in Vista?
2454975	2458478	Oh, by the way, I'm playing Bioshock on my dual-booting MacBook Pro.
2458878	2459679	Suck it, Loki.
2460099	2462441	Love the show, except the Mac hating, Ollie.
2463462	2463782	There you go.
2465188	2467350	Another fan mail for Loki.
2468050	2471373	Well, maybe it's because he's doing that whole doobling thing that his mouse is so screwed up.
2471433	2472274	No, I have no idea.
2472634	2473554	I have not been able to play.
2473595	2477518	Bioshock won't even run on my archaic PC, so I couldn't tell you.
2477578	2481841	But I'm curious, chat room, maybe is there somebody in chat that's playing Bioshock on the PC that would care to enlighten us?
2481881	2483102	Does the mouse feel weird to you guys?
2483959	2484921	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2496385	2496585	Yep.
2496845	2497645	It's those damn kids.
2497665	2498426	As they probably should.
2498466	2499826	Hey, they make laws for reasons.
2499966	2507888	So, you know, obviously they've had reason to make such a law because, you know, they were getting too much theft or people turn in stuff.
2508829	2510709	I could understand needing a photo ID.
2510969	2515070	I don't understand the 18 thing, but... I think all of them require photo IDs.
2515090	2515750	Yeah, they do now.
2515850	2519472	So, I mean, 16 and up, I could see that.
2519612	2519932	All right.
2520312	2521532	Well, let's go to the next email.
2521832	2524613	Goldbanjo14 in our chatroom says, That law is bullshit.
2525697	2527497	Let's go to the next email in our mailbag.
2527577	2528738	Mailbag at OrangeSoundsRadio.com.
2528778	2535299	This one's not signed, so I will attribute it to Nick C. And it's titled, I agree with Loki.
2536539	2542760	Hi, my name, Nick, and I have been listening since I got a PSP when it first came and found the OLR PSP website.
2543000	2544140	I'm reading this as is, you guys.
2544480	2546521	Wow, this is a terrible email.
2546681	2550682	I listen live once and a while and download the podcast all the time.
2550762	2553242	I'm thinking he typed it on his PSP, so I'm giving him a break.
2554798	2558200	Listening to your podcast helped me out when buying a DDR game for my sister.
2558581	2560182	I agree with Loki on Apple.
2560582	2562864	I hat every product made by Apple.
2563624	2572370	People always get made when I bash on Apple all the time, saying that Apple is good with their crappy iPods and Macs that are overpriced.
2572571	2574152	So what do you think he meant by hat?
2574192	2574792	Was it hate?
2574932	2575813	Yeah, it's hate.
2576372	2577773	I think it's Hath.
2578033	2580595	No, it says, I hate every product made by Apple.
2580655	2582396	People always get mad, but I read it as is.
2583396	2594222	People always get mad when I bash on Apple all the time, saying that Apple is good with their crappy iPods and Macs that are overpriced, and I hope they unlock the iPhone so I can make fun of more people that bought an iPod that makes calls.
2596083	2596924	So there you go, Loki.
2596964	2600526	At least you have the bad grammar kids agreeing with you.
2600546	2603748	Okay, you know, still though, you've got to admit, I mean...
2606197	2606757	$600 for a phone?
2606817	2607478	Come on!
2607878	2613223	I mean, if it were a Microsoft phone, I would still be giving people crap for it.
2613243	2615805	I'm like, why the fuck are you spending $600 on a phone?
2615825	2617306	That's what I want to know.
2617426	2617947	Here's my thing.
2617967	2619668	I'll tell you straight up right now.
2619748	2632559	You know I love Macs and all that stuff, so I'm not going to hate on it or whatever, but here's the thing is that I did notice when I was at the airport this week, because I did spend a lot of my week in LA this week, is that
2633177	2637158	There are tons of assholes out there with iPhones that don't even know how to use them.
2637459	2641460	Like, it's becoming this trendy thing amongst businessmen and businesswomen to use.
2642540	2645801	And there's a lot of assholes out there with iPhones, so go figure.
2647802	2648122	Alright.
2649203	2652004	Because it's expensive and excessive, just like SUVs.
2652244	2657726	Hey, if you're an Apple fanboy, fangirl, and you bought one because you want to support the great Apple in the sky, then go for it.
2658586	2659126	It's all good.
2659926	2660287	No hate.
2661027	2661567	No hate from here.
2662778	2664419	We'll do one more here.
2664999	2665720	This is from Nate.
2684549	2691251	I am but a poor commoner and don't have any of the next gen systems, so I have to make do with the pre-DS and Wii Nintendo systems.
2691771	2696332	As such, a lot of the hot news regarding Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, etc.
2696652	2702334	I just don't have much interest in, although it is nice to keep up with what's happening in the industry just for the sake of staying well informed.
2702634	2704376	Wow, that person obviously doesn't listen to the show whatsoever.
2726195	2727475	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2754116	2757278	I've already said this twice in chat, but honestly, this is important in my opinion.
2757719	2764684	In the final area in Super Metroid, below the four boss statues, make sure you only save in the first save room.
2765044	2774791	If you save in the second one, you've already gone past a certain point where there's a room where its door is gray and deactivated, resulting in you being trapped except for being able to complete the game.
2775436	2779178	This would prevent you from going back and collecting any power-ups you may have missed.
2779719	2781740	Note, I learned this the hard way.
2782060	2784402	I even had all the reserve tanks and energy tanks.
2785342	2787644	So, boy, you got screwed, didn't you?
2788604	2789085	Sorry, buddy.
2790265	2790786	Sorry to hear it.
2792767	2793908	All right, that's it for email.
2794048	2798130	Again, if you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelaundrater.com is the place to do it.
2798951	2799191	Yes.
2801252	2811497	Neo Geo titles are confirmed to be coming to the Virtual Console as soon as this month.
2811897	2822783	In fact, September 11th, you'll be getting a few games, including Fatal Fury, Magical Lord, and World of Heroes.
2824363	2826725	Those are each going to cost a whopping 900 Wii Points.
2828248	2830970	No word on whether they're coming to the US.
2831230	2832710	I imagine at some point they will.
2833611	2835252	Magical Lord is fucking awesome.
2835792	2840254	I'm glad to see that's in the initial allotment there.
2840435	2841575	Because I remember playing that a lot.
2842536	2848499	For some reason, these grocery chains around here had Neo Geo machines a while back.
2848959	2852241	So while my parents were checking out, I would be playing Magical Lord.
2853121	2856283	I would think it's inevitable that the game's going to come at some point.
2857261	2858402	XBOX 360 Fatal Inertia
2880009	2881110	If you want to check that game out.
2881910	2883392	Going over to some other systems.
2883872	2888175	On the Nintendo Wii, there's this game called Shinchuka Taisen.
2889617	2893460	Michael to Meme no Boken, which is coming out from Starfish.
2894140	2896842	And this looks to be a game, I'm trying to look at some of the screenshots.
2897643	2904508	Looks like a little bit of a side-scroller action-y type game, like a throwback to an old, you know, like Mario type game.
2904528	2905209	That's kind of cool.
2905389	2906590	I wonder if they'll bring that stateside.
2907916	2917090	Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii, nothing this week, but we can go over to the PlayStation 3 and I can tell you that there is another Pachinko game coming out.
2917110	2919353	Isn't there always?
2919373	2920515	There's always something coming out.
2920970	2924813	PlayStation 2 Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories Dear My Son EA Sports Rugby 08 Will-O-Wisp PlayStation 2 Theta
2949441	2956905	and also a game from Bandai called... Well, let's just call it Mahjong, because that's what it is.
2956965	2957745	It's a Mahjong game.
2957865	2959326	It's with a really complicated title.
2959346	2960126	Mahjong, the game!
2960226	2961487	Another Mahjong game on the PS.
2961507	2963328	The only Mahjong game you need.
2963668	2964828	Let's just leave it at that.
2965268	2967629	Really quickly, seeing if there's anything on the PSP worth mentioning.
2968430	2970691	Sony's putting out a game called Rezel Cross.
2971972	2972892	That might be kind of interesting.
2972912	2973512	It's an RPG.
2973972	2974973	It's from Sony themselves.
2975632	2980235	and it's from, the script is written by the folks who did Ark of the Lad 3 and 4.
2980895	2982556	So if you like Ark of the Lad, you might like this game.
2983117	2984938	There you have it, Japan releases.
2985458	2985738	Nice.
2986058	2994423	In the US, on PlayStation 2, I hope you like Naruto, because Naruto Uzumaki Chronicles 2 is the only PS2 game coming out this week.
2994864	2999927	On other systems though, let's see, 360, we've got Medal of Honor Airborne, that's also coming out on PC.
3001636	3006499	Stranglehold is also coming out on Xbox 360, both the standard and collector's edition.
3007319	3012802	On PSP and DS, Worms Open Warfare 2, because the Worms games are awesome.
3013743	3018005	And let's see here, on PlayStation 3, you get a big fat nothing.
3018785	3022287	And then, of course, on the Wii, Pool Party.
3022748	3025469	And no, that's not with water, that is billiards.
3026651	3031992	And let's see, also on the DS, Garfield Nightmares, which I'm sure is awesome.
3032633	3038174	And PC games, two games that I have to love, I guess.
3038474	3040395	I Love Kittens and I Love Puppies.
3041175	3041695	Hooray!
3041875	3042775	I Love Kittens!
3042855	3043656	That sounds like fun.
3044396	3045956	Let's see, other fun games.
3046316	3048777	Is there a tycoon game this week?
3048837	3049257	Because...
3049895	3052797	I'm going to be very disappointed if there is not.
3054118	3058621	And... No.
3059501	3061283	No Tycoon game.
3061343	3061863	Sorry to hear it.
3062523	3067705	Well, going over to European release dates, since DarkSakura is not here, I still got a lot of love for you, Europe.
3067725	3069486	I'm going to go and look at your release dates real quick.
3070106	3074808	On the 7th, all these games on the 7th, Blazing Angels coming out on Xbox 360 and the PC.
3074828	3076649	This will be the Secret Missions from Ubisoft.
3077049	3079450	Crazy Taxi Fair Wars on the PSP.
3079970	3082391	Two Worlds makes its way to the PC and the Xbox 360.
3083531	3088193	And Valkyrie Profile 2 Slumera is coming out on the PlayStation 2.
3088573	3090754	God, that game came out over here like a year ago, didn't it?
3091323	3091904	Just about.
3092044	3093565	God, it's about time you guys got it.
3093605	3094486	Sorry to hear it, folks.
3095327	3096568	All right, well, that's it for release dates.
3096988	3100091	Not that I think it's a real big disappointment that they haven't gotten it yet.
3100231	3102413	Well, there's some Valkyrie Profile fans out there, I'm sure.
3102493	3102753	Sad.
3103574	3115205	Anyways, there's an interesting game coming out in Japan, of course, because, God forbid, you know, that something like this come out over here.
3115785	3117106	It's created by the team...
3119218	3126067	Sega's Field of Magic team, and it uses voice recognition technology to decipher how people really feel.
3126888	3136160	It's called CorocoScan, and apparently they have a hilarious clip on YouTube.
3136875	3142479	That's talking, they're interviewing, I guess, a girl and her boyfriend.
3143179	3148143	And they were asking, I guess, how he feels about living together and marriage and stuff like that.
3148943	3153787	And I guess it came up that he was cheating on her or something.
3155888	3156429	Wow.
3156589	3156909	Yes.
3158070	3159270	I want to play with that game.
3159391	3159851	That'd be fun.
3159871	3161312	Any chances it might come out over here?
3161852	3163954	Nope, but hey, thank goodness that...
3164861	3169102	Those games are region-free, so awesome.
3170283	3170823	Oh, that's right.
3170843	3173784	Except you have to be able to read Japanese to actually play them, so what the hell.
3174164	3174724	Eh, it doesn't matter.
3175725	3175985	All right.
3176305	3182167	Well, this might be a little more mainstream, and this is coming out on the Nintendo DS, I don't know when.
3182787	3185008	I'm assuming sometime within the next year or so.
3185468	3187849	The Legend of Kage Part 2.
3187989	3191870	Some folks, if you don't know how to pronounce things right, might call this The Legend of Cage Part 2.
3192478	3194819	Because this came out years ago on the NES.
3195180	3199642	But The Legend of Kage is coming out on the DS, a new sequel to it.
3200202	3205745	And this was something that was spotted in Famitsu Magazine with some screenshots and everything.
3205905	3206886	So pretty cool.
3208307	3209427	If you like The Legend of Kage.
3209447	3211689	I know that's an S game that a lot of people liked.
3212829	3214230	I think it's on Virtual Console now, right?
3214250	3215991	I think so.
3216431	3216891	Possibly.
3216912	3218973	I thought I saw that it was coming back to Virtual Console.
3218993	3219433	So there you go.
3220470	3230356	Well, if you are looking for a game that's not so mainstream and definitely a lot cheaper, you may be interested in Rose Camellia DS.
3230897	3242884	Now, if you're not familiar of Rose and Camellia, it's a women's slapping game that's a flash game right now, but it is being ported over to the DS via the homebrew community.
3243625	3248708	And, uh, actually, it's funny, the guy that's doing it happens to be French, and, um,
3249466	3264277	Needs help finishing the game, but still though, if you want to check it out, you can definitely check out the free Flash game site, and it is beyondds.free.fr.
3264538	3266379	For the record, that game is fucking rad.
3266559	3268000	The slapping game, I love that game.
3268020	3269021	The slapping game, yeah.
3269693	3270593	I love the slapping game.
3270813	3272914	Have you ever played the slapping game, the flash game, Shane?
3273474	3274794	I know you've been checked out of the show.
3275655	3279136	I think I tried to play it at work once and it wouldn't work right.
3279556	3280116	I'm sorry to hear it.
3280176	3280616	It's a fun game.
3280636	3282437	It sounds funny because you slap women.
3284417	3286558	But you're a woman slapping the women, so it's okay.
3286578	3287318	It doesn't matter.
3287358	3289799	As long as a woman is getting slapped, all is right in the world.
3289819	3291259	Wow, you can send those cards and letters too.
3291279	3292299	What's your email, Miklatov?
3294180	3294400	Anyhow.
3296352	3300381	Also announced for a Nintendo platform, not quite as...
3301662	3303983	Huh, but it's pretty cool nonetheless.
3304063	3307704	Coming to the Wii, Worms, A Space Odyssey.
3308384	3322349	It's another game in the Word series, and of course it will be taking advantage of the Wii's motion control system, but what's really cool about this, online worldwide play, which is not something you've been seeing a whole lot in Nintendo releases lately, so that is certainly very promising.
3322729	3325350	This was announced by an official press release from THQ Inc.
3325570	3326251	this week.
3326651	3327171	Buyin' it!
3328071	3329392	You're that big a fan of Worms, huh?
3329412	3330892	I love me some Worms.
3331092	3336354	Just an FYI, there is still the Worms Open Warfare 2 being made for the DS and PSP.
3336734	3340275	Wow, they must still really have a fanbase for these games, because they crank them out left and right.
3340975	3342436	Are you buying all of these games, Loki?
3343956	3344576	No.
3344596	3346237	Will I be playing them?
3346417	3346997	Maybe.
3347237	3353059	I bought the very first one that came out on the PC years ago, and that's the last one I bought.
3353684	3356566	I think the last game I bought was for the PC.
3356747	3360229	It was Worms Armageddon.
3360650	3363932	They do have one of the Worms games on GameTap, so that's one of the ones I've played too.
3364032	3370017	I've been meaning to buy the one on Xbox Live Arcade, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.
3372699	3377343	One game I'm definitely going to be around to buying is Manhunt 2.
3378084	3382127	Of course, people are still pissed off that the game got re-rated down to an M.
3382605	3385686	They want to know why they're demanding answers, and guess what?
3385726	3389488	The ESRB says, uh-uh, we ain't giving you no fucking answers.
3390028	3391729	So here's their statement, basically.
3391989	3407276	The FTC, the National PTA, the Kaiser Family Foundation, and the Peter Hart Research Team have all found that parents are overwhelmingly satisfied with the ESRB rating system, rather than publicly saying
3409251	3424301	What is unmistakably a strong warning to parents about the suitability of particular games for children, which presumably neither Senator Yee or the CCFC have personally reviewed.
3424361	3433927	We feel that a more productive tact would be joining us in encouraging parents to take their ratings seriously when buying games for their children.
3435800	3436741	You show them.
3437101	3439022	So in other words, yeah, they re-rate it.
3439483	3439723	What?
3439963	3441064	What did they change to re-rate it?
3441104	3441905	Well, fuck off.
3441945	3443005	You don't get to find out.
3444106	3450351	Actually, they can find out if they buy certain versions of the game in other countries and check it.
3451452	3453533	Or maybe they didn't change much at all.
3453593	3454734	Maybe they appealed or something.
3454794	3458177	It's freaking... Okay, 17 and 18 year olds, come on.
3458417	3459618	We've discussed this before.
3459698	3463000	There's not much maturity difference between a 17 and 18 year old, okay?
3465407	3465988	Thanks for watching!
3487219	3489180	I'm more impressed that they did it this quick.
3489420	3496342	I mean, we all thought the game was just not going to come out for like a year now because of this, and it seems like not even a month later, it's all fixed.
3496722	3499583	So it makes me think whatever they changed wasn't that much.
3499843	3500544	It wasn't that much.
3500804	3501764	It was probably stupid things.
3501784	3506966	Remember when we talked about Laird last week and how they had to change stuff to get a teen rating?
3507206	3510667	They couldn't show blood, but they could show people being burned alive.
3511107	3513489	I mean, like, there's a big difference there or something.
3513990	3517713	So, it's just, it's really stupid, the requirements that they have.
3517733	3520475	It's just like the, you know, MPA, it's all fucked up.
3520956	3522477	But, I don't know.
3522657	3528603	I like how these people, though, that haven't played the game at all can criticize, you know, the rating system or anything like that.
3528643	3534488	They have no clue on what's going on, yet they're just like, oh, we want the game banned, it's horrible.
3534588	3538171	They're going to be selling it to children, you know, despite the fact that it's,
3538697	3539718	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3562327	3564329	It's like they act like their parents are powerless.
3564349	3566290	It's like, oh no, he's got it in his hands now.
3566630	3567911	I can't take it away from him.
3568091	3572414	We're doomed.
3572454	3573675	Lots of comments from chat here.
3573735	3577078	Fireboma says, won't somebody think of the children?
3578499	3578879	Let's see.
3578999	3587145	Escapist says, maybe they just had to excise some extreme cutscenes to Manhunt 2 down to an M. Son of Dad speculates Manhunt wasn't changed.
3587185	3588386	It was a publicity stunt.
3589787	3590168	Interesting.
3590448	3591951	GS191 says, I'm 19.
3592933	3594637	I don't feel any more different than when I was 17.
3595578	3600949	Sure, I learned a lot of things, but these people forget that there's a lot of kids that know the difference between real and fake.
3601451	3605153	Yeah, but isn't it fair to say, unfortunately, there's some that don't, and there's even some, like, 20-year-olds that don't.
3605173	3616077	Shouldn't you be more worried about your kids going and having underage sex and doing drugs and, you know, all sorts of things like that rather than playing violent video games?
3616437	3623720	I would think that you would be more encouraging of, you know, kids playing games that require them not to leave the house to do malicious things.
3624481	3630363	I don't know about you, but, you know, I think given the two choices, I'll take my kids playing violent video games.
3633513	3638275	Fireboma in chat has a funny comment, says, My precious unique snowflake would never do drugs.
3639856	3641677	Or play these violent video games, I'm sure.
3641837	3643678	I mean, seriously, how dumb are people?
3644218	3644538	Really?
3646119	3648300	Who doesn't enjoy a little bit of violence once in a while?
3648320	3649280	Do you like violence, Shane?
3650661	3650921	Yes.
3651301	3651581	You do?
3651701	3652241	Okay, that's good.
3652381	3653762	No, only sometimes.
3654022	3654622	Only sometimes?
3654903	3655943	What types of violence do you like?
3657204	3658624	The stuff that doesn't look too real.
3659225	3660625	I can't stand the real stuff.
3660845	3661185	Okay.
3661986	3662266	All right.
3663132	3664653	and Violence Against Women.
3666514	3667755	Again, those cards and letters.
3667915	3668976	You want to hear a funny story?
3670156	3670737	Sure, why not?
3670857	3673358	This refers to last week when we were talking about Imagine Babies.
3673819	3677701	I actually talked to the company that's making Imagine Babies.
3677781	3678922	I think Ubisoft's putting it out.
3679222	3680963	And I mentioned to them about the baby shaking.
3682304	3683144	They did not know that.
3683164	3685486	They didn't?
3685946	3687967	I'm like, you can rock the baby with one part.
3687987	3690109	And if you shake it really fast, you're actually shaking babies.
3690169	3690309	Yeah.
3692029	3693650	I don't want them to change that.
3694470	3696190	They're not going to change that.
3696210	3698591	Good job, Loki, ruining Imagine Babies.
3699371	3699691	I know.
3699731	3701372	Good job, ass.
3704353	3706614	Wow, this show has gone to all sorts of places.
3706654	3707594	I didn't think it would go tonight.
3707794	3711335	It's because Jamie's not here to keep us in check and make pouty faces.
3713976	3714556	And flip me off.
3715765	3716185	DarkSakura.com
3735793	3752283	but Electronic Arts was contacted a little later in the week and EA has reaffirmed that yes, they are going to E for All so if you want a chance to play Rock Band early you still have a chance because obviously if EA is going they're bringing that game with them because they've trucked it everywhere the past couple months
3752722	3753782	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3779065	3781688	Shane, I might have to drag you with me if you can go.
3781968	3783590	I don't know, depending on what's going on.
3784411	3784692	All right.
3785392	3786854	Well, anything else in this Part A?
3787755	3789177	We're kind of running a short show tonight.
3789797	3790538	I don't know what's up with that.
3790598	3792921	Well, that's just Part A. That's just Part A. That's right.
3792941	3793762	There's plenty more to come.
3794525	3797386	Tonight in Part B, we're going to be playing a little bit of Beat the Host.
3797847	3803189	So you might want to get your phones nearby or your Skype line ready because we'll be taking the first caller to play Beat the Host.
3803609	3805930	Not now, but when we come back and we tell you to call in.
3805970	3808232	And if you haven't heard Beat the Host, it's a lot of fun.
3808492	3810032	Stay tuned for tonight's Beat the Host.
3810333	3813434	We'll be right back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
3813934	3818917	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
3819357	3823679	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
