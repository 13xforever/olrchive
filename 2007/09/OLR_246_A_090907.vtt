00:14.007 --> 00:19.331
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, September 9th, 2007, Laird's Hot Coffee Mode is found, but it's not what you think.

00:19.851 --> 00:25.596
[SPEAKER_00]: HD DVD gets a price cut in Europe, and a third-party company has something to say about PlayStation's marketing.

00:32.267 --> 00:36.309
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.349 --> 00:45.252
[SPEAKER_08]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer lifestyle and gamer culture.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.793
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll teach me to say so damn much during the introduction.

00:48.133 --> 00:52.175
[SPEAKER_08]: That voice you hear taunting behind me is the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:52.475 --> 00:52.775
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

00:53.255 --> 00:56.957
[SPEAKER_08]: And my name is Rob Roberts and joining me as well, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

00:57.157 --> 00:57.677
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

00:57.997 --> 00:58.918
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing, Jamie?

00:58.938 --> 00:59.578
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing tonight?

01:00.492 --> 01:01.252
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a soda.

01:01.513 --> 01:02.273
[SPEAKER_08]: You has a soda?

01:02.293 --> 01:03.434
[SPEAKER_10]: I has a soda.

01:03.534 --> 01:04.134
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it delicious?

01:04.815 --> 01:05.255
[SPEAKER_10]: Not really.

01:05.575 --> 01:05.935
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really?

01:06.195 --> 01:07.296
[SPEAKER_08]: You're very quiet tonight.

01:07.316 --> 01:08.557
[SPEAKER_08]: You seem kind of timid.

01:09.057 --> 01:09.697
[SPEAKER_08]: Is everything okay?

01:10.818 --> 01:11.899
[SPEAKER_08]: I just ate.

01:12.279 --> 01:12.739
[SPEAKER_08]: You just ate?

01:12.759 --> 01:14.080
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're very well satiated?

01:14.100 --> 01:19.123
[SPEAKER_11]: I was getting into uber bitch mode because I didn't eat and then I ate and I ate too much.

01:19.870 --> 01:27.754
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I should say something before we get to the rest of the show is that we are taking new pictures tonight, which I'm hoping you guys will see the results of in our album.

01:28.334 --> 01:29.155
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't talk tonight.

01:29.195 --> 01:29.915
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell's wrong with me?

01:30.195 --> 01:35.198
[SPEAKER_08]: In our album artwork that you'll be seeing for episode 250, at least a little later on.

01:36.879 --> 01:38.079
[SPEAKER_08]: And Jamie got to eat.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.260
[SPEAKER_08]: Weren't you eating a Pikachu?

01:40.520 --> 01:40.901
[SPEAKER_08]: Or was that?

01:41.121 --> 01:43.062
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you were squishing a Pikachu, pretending to eat a Pikachu.

01:43.142 --> 01:44.603
[SPEAKER_02]: I ate my cell phone.

01:44.983 --> 01:45.843
[SPEAKER_08]: You ate your cell phone.

01:45.963 --> 01:46.583
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it delicious?

01:46.944 --> 01:47.384
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

01:47.444 --> 01:48.665
[SPEAKER_02]: It tasted like Samsung.

01:49.065 --> 01:49.505
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:50.140 --> 01:50.480
[SPEAKER_08]: Wonderful.

01:51.021 --> 01:51.261
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:51.822 --> 01:54.304
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, also joining us tonight, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

01:55.224 --> 01:56.566
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already said hello, but yes.

01:56.726 --> 01:57.066
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.

01:57.266 --> 01:57.486
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

01:57.927 --> 01:58.487
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hi again.

01:58.567 --> 01:58.928
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?

01:59.328 --> 01:59.868
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing fine.

02:00.249 --> 02:00.529
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

02:00.989 --> 02:01.189
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:01.270 --> 02:06.114
[SPEAKER_08]: And also say hello to our chat room, which is available at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

02:06.674 --> 02:11.218
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can also say hello to Gay Eddie, who's here tonight joining us on the show.

02:11.959 --> 02:13.120
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that'd be Casper the Gay.

02:13.140 --> 02:13.700
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.542
[SPEAKER_04]: You just always call me Gay Eddie because you're a douche.

02:16.698 --> 02:18.259
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what else to call you, I'm sorry.

02:18.339 --> 02:26.904
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're going to start off with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week, and we'll come back to you and fill in a little more for the folks that may not know you, because you haven't been on the show in a long time.

02:27.825 --> 02:29.306
[SPEAKER_08]: Has it really been six months?

02:29.326 --> 02:31.647
[SPEAKER_08]: You could have had a baby since the last time.

02:31.867 --> 02:34.349
[SPEAKER_08]: See, maybe you had a baby, and we'll find that out.

02:34.689 --> 02:36.030
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we'll start with Dark Sakura.

02:36.070 --> 02:36.910
[SPEAKER_08]: How was your gaming week?

02:36.950 --> 02:37.711
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about video games.

02:38.271 --> 02:39.232
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of pinball.

02:39.472 --> 02:41.553
[SPEAKER_02]: We sold the whodunit, finally.

02:42.253 --> 02:43.094
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I liked whodunit.

02:43.840 --> 02:46.423
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but we can get a much better one than the one that we had.

02:46.903 --> 02:48.264
[SPEAKER_02]: We're babysitting some machines.

02:48.284 --> 02:55.672
[SPEAKER_02]: We're babysitting a Back to the Future, which Back to the Future sucks because Michael J. Fox wouldn't let his likeness be used in the game.

02:56.512 --> 02:58.434
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has somebody who completely doesn't look like him.

02:58.995 --> 02:59.275
[SPEAKER_00]: What a bastard.

02:59.295 --> 03:00.116
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the sound files.

03:01.137 --> 03:03.940
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it's either him or his agent or something.

03:04.560 --> 03:08.344
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we got a Time Machine, which is one of my favorite older pens.

03:09.130 --> 03:09.970
[SPEAKER_02]: Project Gotham Racing 3 Land 5 360s

03:38.624 --> 03:40.924
[SPEAKER_07]: But one of them does not want to land.

03:41.405 --> 03:42.065
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why.

03:42.365 --> 03:45.545
[SPEAKER_07]: It will land other games, but it just doesn't like Project Gotham Racing 3.

03:46.866 --> 03:47.166
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

03:48.166 --> 03:49.506
[SPEAKER_07]: So we played four players with that.

03:49.886 --> 03:53.227
[SPEAKER_07]: Luckily that day there was someone missing, so it worked out.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.528
[SPEAKER_07]: Then Saints Row multiplayer, also via System Link.

03:56.688 --> 04:00.248
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear, you know, there's just not enough support for System Link.

04:00.588 --> 04:01.049
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sad.

04:01.769 --> 04:05.910
[SPEAKER_07]: But hopefully we'll get live soon at work and then be able to play anything.

04:07.130 --> 04:08.130
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, other things I played...

04:09.125 --> 04:35.761
[SPEAKER_07]: Bioshock, more of that I'm actually a little bit more into it now I forget where the hell I'm at but it's still been very good so definitely looking forward to playing more of that game and then let's see I tried a little bit more stuff on 360 I actually downloaded the full version of Worms and well it's Worms so can't really say too much on that and let's see what else did I try out um

04:37.603 --> 04:47.910
[SPEAKER_07]: Also on the PSP, I found a... Someone had dumped a version of Sega Rally on there that's not out yet, but it's actually very awesome.

04:48.350 --> 04:51.532
[SPEAKER_07]: Sega Rally Revo, I know it's going to be on most other systems.

04:52.113 --> 04:57.096
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're just dropping the Revo part for the PSP version, though, but it's cool.

04:57.296 --> 05:00.438
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very awesome if you've played Sega Rally in the arcades exactly like that.

05:00.936 --> 05:02.198
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it looks good, too.

05:02.318 --> 05:03.901
[SPEAKER_07]: So, really recommend that one.

05:04.962 --> 05:05.743
[SPEAKER_07]: And... Oh!

05:06.064 --> 05:06.765
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost forgot!

05:07.125 --> 05:09.489
[SPEAKER_07]: On 360, play FlatOut Ultimate Carnage.

05:10.230 --> 05:11.252
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking love this game.

05:11.312 --> 05:14.256
[SPEAKER_07]: This game right now, I think, best racing game of the year.

05:14.977 --> 05:15.458
[SPEAKER_07]: Hands down.

05:16.130 --> 05:17.231
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a pretty hefty title.

05:17.411 --> 05:19.132
[SPEAKER_07]: It is, and it's fucking fun.

05:20.113 --> 05:23.656
[SPEAKER_07]: Flat out, I used to love the game, first off, because you can crash into things.

05:24.116 --> 05:32.262
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the first game really pissed me off, because when you'd crash into objects on the track, you would kind of get stuck on them, and that kind of sucked.

05:32.682 --> 05:42.770
[SPEAKER_07]: But, they went back, fixed all that shit, now there's like 6,000 things on the track to crash into, and you see all of them all strewn about on the track.

05:43.257 --> 05:45.759
[SPEAKER_07]: Ultimate Carnage, Destruction Derby, Ragdoll Olympics

06:12.145 --> 06:14.987
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely check out FlatOut Ultimate Carnage.

06:30.603 --> 06:33.864
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically, but FlatOut is a completely different game.

06:34.284 --> 06:38.825
[SPEAKER_07]: Their thing is the fact that you can crash into a bunch of different objects on the course.

06:39.466 --> 06:40.646
[SPEAKER_07]: Burnout doesn't really have that.

06:40.666 --> 06:44.007
[SPEAKER_07]: It's mainly just crashing into the cars and exploding and stuff like that.

06:45.147 --> 06:48.388
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a different type of game, but I really recommend checking it out.

06:49.288 --> 06:49.909
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty awesome.

06:49.929 --> 06:53.690
[SPEAKER_07]: I played the demo for a good half an hour at least, and probably will play it a little bit more until it comes out.

06:55.512 --> 06:55.993
[SPEAKER_07]: Worms 2 Open Warfare

07:20.571 --> 07:24.372
[SPEAKER_08]: Only on this show would saying you're a whore for worms actually make sense.

07:24.512 --> 07:27.153
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you imagine if I walked up to just a random person on a street?

07:27.173 --> 07:28.673
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a whore for worms!

07:28.693 --> 07:30.514
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a worm whore!

07:30.974 --> 07:32.394
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless they liked worms.

07:32.814 --> 07:33.895
[SPEAKER_08]: Or were fishermen.

07:34.015 --> 07:36.015
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think there are such things like worm fetish?

07:36.055 --> 07:36.775
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really gross.

07:37.135 --> 07:37.776
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.116
[SPEAKER_08]: There's sick people in the world.

07:39.136 --> 07:40.256
[SPEAKER_07]: There's fetishes for everything.

07:40.716 --> 07:41.577
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what they say.

07:41.657 --> 07:42.257
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously?

07:42.277 --> 07:44.237
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have anybody in the chatroom with worm fetish?

07:44.957 --> 07:47.058
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody in the chatroom is talking about their gaming weeks.

07:47.078 --> 07:47.278
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't...

07:47.799 --> 07:48.700
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

08:04.230 --> 08:05.170
[SPEAKER_07]: Eh, that's pretty old.

08:05.551 --> 08:06.711
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, 1942 and Lode Runner.

08:06.891 --> 08:10.853
[SPEAKER_07]: But, and Kaboom, on this Activision's hit remix, which sucks.

08:10.873 --> 08:11.693
[SPEAKER_07]: Kaboom is awesome.

08:11.733 --> 08:13.974
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about Kunio games earlier.

08:14.094 --> 08:17.576
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I just didn't like the Activision hits remixed on the PSP.

08:17.956 --> 08:18.276
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just...

08:19.073 --> 08:19.453
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

08:19.634 --> 08:22.296
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, but isn't that the only system they put it out on is the remixed ones?

08:22.416 --> 08:23.637
[SPEAKER_08]: Like all the souped up titles?

08:23.977 --> 08:25.238
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they weren't really souped up.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.699
[SPEAKER_07]: These were just the standard games.

08:27.420 --> 08:28.300
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

08:28.821 --> 08:34.225
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the Atari Classics one that's going to be redone with the ones that they had on Xbox Live Arcade.

08:34.545 --> 08:35.566
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just the old one.

08:35.626 --> 08:41.630
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a collection of 70-some Activision titles like Kaboom, Pitfall, Pitfall 2, etc.

08:42.491 --> 08:43.212
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is okay.

08:43.512 --> 08:46.674
[SPEAKER_07]: If you really want a collection of those old games, then great.

08:46.774 --> 08:47.295
[SPEAKER_07]: Pick that up.

08:47.335 --> 08:48.836
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it's dirt cheap by now.

08:50.741 --> 08:51.021
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

08:51.161 --> 08:51.941
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not for me.

08:52.101 --> 08:54.942
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not... I don't want to play it on that console.

08:55.523 --> 08:58.204
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100Mad is applauding you, Loki, in our chatroom.

08:58.264 --> 08:59.484
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki is really branching out.

08:59.564 --> 09:01.125
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought he was just an achievement point whore.

09:02.119 --> 09:02.980
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I still am.

09:03.140 --> 09:07.243
[SPEAKER_07]: I was playing Worms and I was getting achievements on that.

09:07.403 --> 09:07.983
[SPEAKER_07]: What was I playing?

09:08.003 --> 09:08.784
[SPEAKER_07]: There was something else I was playing.

09:09.004 --> 09:10.585
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I played Mutant Storm Reloaded.

09:11.746 --> 09:15.089
[SPEAKER_07]: I played that and I was getting some more achievements on that as well.

09:15.529 --> 09:16.070
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, actually, no.

09:16.090 --> 09:17.310
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking through my arcade games.

09:17.350 --> 09:22.354
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I own like 40 arcade games and I don't have the high scores on any of them among my friends.

09:22.394 --> 09:24.676
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, which one can I possibly get the high score on?

09:25.677 --> 09:30.000
[SPEAKER_07]: And I tried on Mutant Storm Reloaded and I just didn't have enough time to dedicate to it.

09:30.888 --> 09:32.849
[SPEAKER_07]: How many games am I whooping your ass on?

09:33.269 --> 09:33.529
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

09:33.549 --> 09:36.229
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't play live arcade games that much, so probably a lot.

09:36.249 --> 09:36.850
[SPEAKER_07]: Just curious.

09:37.650 --> 09:37.910
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

09:38.690 --> 09:39.130
[SPEAKER_08]: All finished?

09:39.530 --> 09:40.070
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm all finished.

09:40.510 --> 09:40.791
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

09:41.511 --> 09:44.011
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Call of Duty 4 multiplayer, the beta.

09:44.271 --> 09:44.391
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

09:44.652 --> 09:45.272
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty awesome.

09:45.292 --> 09:46.152
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you in it legally?

09:46.652 --> 09:47.612
[SPEAKER_07]: I am in it legally.

09:47.832 --> 09:48.733
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, congratulations.

09:49.433 --> 09:53.394
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there's a way people were getting on there illegally, but no, they actually put me in the first wave.

09:53.434 --> 09:54.274
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you allowed to talk about it?

09:55.092 --> 09:55.653
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck if I know.

09:56.333 --> 09:57.054
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, let me put it this way.

09:57.254 --> 09:57.995
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Call of Duty.

09:58.035 --> 10:00.757
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, shit, they haven't really changed much since, you know, 2.

10:02.399 --> 10:04.420
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's no modern day stuff.

10:04.580 --> 10:05.301
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks awesome.

10:05.701 --> 10:06.082
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

10:06.202 --> 10:12.728
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you want me to describe it for you, go play Call of Duty 3, but just imagine it's futuristic or modern day.

10:12.828 --> 10:14.489
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's basically the same damn thing.

10:15.130 --> 10:15.590
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good.

10:16.291 --> 10:17.772
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, people are, like, loving this game.

10:17.832 --> 10:18.373
[SPEAKER_07]: It is good.

10:18.633 --> 10:18.753
[SPEAKER_07]: It's...

10:19.673 --> 10:20.454
[SPEAKER_07]: CasperTheGay

10:40.100 --> 10:41.181
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got Newtopia and Newtopia 2.

11:08.024 --> 11:08.905
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, do you have Nootopia 2?

11:09.065 --> 11:10.566
[SPEAKER_02]: I have TurboGrafx.

11:10.806 --> 11:11.407
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, okay.

11:11.707 --> 11:14.269
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the thing about it is, it's a Zelda clone.

11:14.289 --> 11:17.031
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like Zelda games, you'll like it for that old-school gameplay.

11:17.371 --> 11:19.853
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's some reasons why Zelda was way more popular.

11:19.973 --> 11:27.338
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like, for instance, if you bomb a cave or you bomb a wall in a dungeon, you have to re-bomb it the next time you go back in, which is a real pain in the ass.

11:27.478 --> 11:28.859
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they get for being HuCard games.

11:28.959 --> 11:29.899
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's horrible.

11:29.959 --> 11:33.660
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you go into the cave or something, you automatically have to start talking to the person.

11:33.680 --> 11:34.960
[SPEAKER_04]: You have no choice.

11:35.241 --> 11:39.301
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if somebody's in a dungeon in a room, every time you pass through that room, you start talking to them again.

11:39.362 --> 11:40.142
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, ugh.

11:40.562 --> 11:41.222
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's still fun.

11:41.322 --> 11:41.822
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good stuff.

11:42.542 --> 11:43.763
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, Hugh Card game.

11:45.123 --> 11:45.883
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's good times, though.

11:45.903 --> 11:46.723
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty much it.

11:46.783 --> 11:51.825
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played any new stuff, so I want to play Metroid, the new one, so that looks pretty awesome.

11:53.565 --> 11:56.446
[SPEAKER_08]: Kick them off the TV watching Battlestar reruns and go play Metroid.

11:56.466 --> 11:56.906
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.

11:57.726 --> 11:57.966
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

11:58.783 --> 11:59.023
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

11:59.404 --> 12:04.313
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I got to talk about my gaming week and... Oh, hell.

12:04.453 --> 12:06.677
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I really want to say anything about my gaming week.

12:07.018 --> 12:08.180
[SPEAKER_08]: I better brace myself.

12:10.384 --> 12:11.225
[SPEAKER_08]: This week, I...

12:13.783 --> 12:17.566
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI

12:42.076 --> 12:43.077
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a camera on me.

12:44.739 --> 12:50.005
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I wanted to play something and I had codes that would make it so I could play for a month for free.

12:50.045 --> 12:50.986
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was like, I'm going to do that.

12:51.487 --> 12:55.291
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you got a free month on WoW and you're like, okay, I'll come play Final Fantasy XI.

12:55.932 --> 12:57.774
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we got two of our friends to play too.

12:58.775 --> 13:00.517
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're all just going back.

13:00.617 --> 13:01.518
[SPEAKER_09]: We're migrating back.

13:03.140 --> 13:08.583
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing about it is that they've changed a lot since I've been gone, and I was kind of curious what all has changed.

13:08.623 --> 13:14.586
[SPEAKER_08]: And it does seem like they have fixed a lot of things that were pissing me off before, such as they got rid of a lot of the gold sellers.

13:14.606 --> 13:16.868
[SPEAKER_08]: The economy seems to be a lot better than it was before.

13:16.888 --> 13:18.368
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like it's stabilized.

13:18.388 --> 13:19.709
[SPEAKER_08]: The economy changes.

13:19.749 --> 13:21.110
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, seriously, the economy changes.

13:21.130 --> 13:22.531
[SPEAKER_08]: It happens in a lot of MMOs.

13:22.851 --> 13:28.574
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's the most hilarious part, and old-school OLR listeners will really get a kick out of this.

13:28.854 --> 13:30.195
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what server we're playing on?

13:31.296 --> 13:31.696
[SPEAKER_08]: Faerie.

13:32.642 --> 13:33.723
[SPEAKER_08]: The Fairy Server!

13:33.743 --> 13:36.005
[SPEAKER_08]: We're playing on the Fairy Server!

13:36.425 --> 13:37.826
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're pretending we're noobs.

13:38.006 --> 13:41.869
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to go back to like episode 80 to get these jokes when I was first getting into Final Fantasy XI.

13:41.909 --> 13:43.931
[SPEAKER_08]: But yes, we're playing on the Fairy Server.

13:43.951 --> 13:45.732
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember why we were pissed off at that chick.

13:45.752 --> 13:47.013
[SPEAKER_07]: What was it?

13:47.334 --> 13:47.694
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember.

13:47.714 --> 13:49.936
[SPEAKER_08]: It was something to do with live journal drama or something.

13:50.656 --> 13:51.297
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to go back.

13:51.517 --> 13:52.758
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really fun though in...

13:53.510 --> 13:55.632
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually having a really good time.

13:55.652 --> 13:58.014
[SPEAKER_09]: So am I. I keep leveling everything I can.

13:58.094 --> 14:03.598
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm wondering if it's one of those things where when I have to start partying in the dunes, if it's going to wear off real quick.

14:03.618 --> 14:04.619
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know what the dunes are.

14:04.679 --> 14:06.260
[SPEAKER_09]: Give me my drink, Eddie.

14:07.401 --> 14:08.161
[SPEAKER_08]: This is great radio.

14:08.221 --> 14:08.422
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

14:08.642 --> 14:09.823
[SPEAKER_09]: He's trying to steal my drink.

14:10.583 --> 14:11.904
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know what the dunes are yet.

14:12.164 --> 14:14.326
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, we're just low levels.

14:15.027 --> 14:15.447
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be there.

14:15.487 --> 14:18.109
[SPEAKER_08]: We've never played before.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.131
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking in the chat room to see what people are saying.

14:20.731 --> 14:23.173
[SPEAKER_08]: Ghost Guy says Final Fantasy XI equals not so good.

14:24.567 --> 14:27.390
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that person's name that you just read equals not so good.

14:28.031 --> 14:31.834
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100Matt says, why isn't Jamie on top of Rob about this?

14:32.315 --> 14:33.636
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Shane took her mic for one.

14:33.656 --> 14:34.917
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I needed to talk to him to some point.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.999
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be curious what Jamie's thoughts are on all of this.

14:37.019 --> 14:37.640
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go watch what else.

14:37.660 --> 14:39.281
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, bye.

14:39.301 --> 14:39.922
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care.

14:40.703 --> 14:43.225
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I thought you were going to call me an addict or yell at me or something.

14:43.485 --> 14:43.806
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

14:44.686 --> 14:44.907
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.108
[SPEAKER_02]: What you play is up to you.

14:46.542 --> 14:47.143
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I like this.

14:47.163 --> 14:49.945
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the kinder, gentler Jamie than we had a few episodes ago.

14:49.965 --> 14:52.228
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is the indifferent, apathetic Jamie.

14:52.328 --> 14:52.848
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see.

14:52.908 --> 14:54.069
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the meh Jamie.

14:54.430 --> 14:54.770
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

14:54.890 --> 14:55.191
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

14:56.392 --> 14:56.832
[SPEAKER_08]: The meh.

14:57.473 --> 14:58.594
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think about that, Jamie?

14:58.834 --> 14:59.034
[SPEAKER_08]: Meh.

15:00.450 --> 15:05.214
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't just play Final Fantasy XI, though, because I swear I'm going to limit my time on it this time around.

15:05.354 --> 15:07.095
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll let you guys know how long I actually stick with it.

15:07.396 --> 15:10.418
[SPEAKER_08]: But I also was playing some more Blue Dragon and made some more progress on that.

15:10.438 --> 15:11.799
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm enjoying Blue Dragon.

15:12.039 --> 15:17.824
[SPEAKER_08]: I realize the critics didn't exactly give it the best scores in the world, but I'm having a good time with it.

15:18.745 --> 15:20.266
[SPEAKER_08]: And then some stuff on Xbox Live Arcade.

15:20.306 --> 15:21.527
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, Fatal Fury Special.

15:21.867 --> 15:22.748
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to give that a go.

15:23.288 --> 15:26.351
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's the same game, basically, from the Neo Geo.

15:26.371 --> 15:28.753
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't really change anything, but that's okay, because Fatal Fury...

15:29.193 --> 15:29.793
[SPEAKER_08]: Street Fighter is $10?

15:29.854 --> 15:31.294
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, I thought that virtual console games were expensive.

15:31.314 --> 15:31.875
[SPEAKER_08]: Not even Super Mario Bros.

15:55.411 --> 15:56.212
[SPEAKER_08]: or $5 for Metroid.

15:56.252 --> 15:57.472
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that stuff's expensive.

15:57.492 --> 15:59.773
[SPEAKER_07]: You should see the PlayStation Network game prices.

16:01.114 --> 16:05.476
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, granted, they're more full games, but we're talking like $40, $20.

16:10.138 --> 16:21.903
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say one other thing I've noticed about Final Fantasy XI is that it seems like there's a lot less OMG, WTF-type kids on there now, and I'm noticing there's a lot of older people that are getting into Final Fantasy XI.

16:22.403 --> 16:24.024
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of stay-at-home moms...

16:24.835 --> 16:25.615
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

16:54.099 --> 16:55.480
[SPEAKER_08]: Run faster!

16:55.520 --> 16:56.741
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where my discs are either.

16:56.841 --> 16:58.962
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie's thinking about coming back to Final Fantasy.

17:02.265 --> 17:03.465
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay, I only got to level 15.

17:05.814 --> 17:06.654
[SPEAKER_08]: She's thinking about it.

17:07.035 --> 17:08.055
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this is exciting news.

17:08.075 --> 17:09.796
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably actually going to quit World of Warcraft 2.

17:10.616 --> 17:11.637
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to quit MMOs.

17:11.677 --> 17:12.797
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't quit World of Warcraft.

17:12.837 --> 17:13.377
[SPEAKER_08]: I should say that.

17:13.437 --> 17:18.179
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just that I have a free month because I got somebody else to play through the rewards program.

17:18.459 --> 17:21.941
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is my month where I'm going to decide which one I'm going to stick with, if any.

17:22.241 --> 17:24.982
[SPEAKER_08]: Because honestly, when I play MMOs... You should totally play World of Warcraft.

17:25.102 --> 17:25.482
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye!

17:25.743 --> 17:27.783
[SPEAKER_08]: It cuts into my console times.

17:28.544 --> 17:29.004
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll see.

17:29.244 --> 17:30.685
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try to play through Super Metroid.

17:31.085 --> 17:32.826
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Super Metroid.

17:33.066 --> 17:33.486
[SPEAKER_08]: Good stuff.

17:34.384 --> 17:42.747
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been looking for a video capture card for the Mac so we can do Operator 11 stuff with the Super Metroid.

17:42.767 --> 17:45.268
[SPEAKER_08]: We can do our live playthrough and have the video feed actually on it.

17:45.288 --> 17:46.548
[SPEAKER_08]: You actually have to do it this week.

17:47.148 --> 17:47.448
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

17:47.528 --> 17:48.189
[SPEAKER_08]: We totally will.

17:48.209 --> 17:49.009
[SPEAKER_08]: I just need to get the card.

17:49.429 --> 17:52.691
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been doing my show on Tuesday so we should do that instead of my show.

18:18.582 --> 18:21.864
[SPEAKER_08]: So keep an eye out on our page on Operator11.com.

18:21.924 --> 18:25.646
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure exactly how to get to our profile, but I can tell you our username is Orange Laundry.

18:25.666 --> 18:26.827
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a really bad plug, huh?

18:27.187 --> 18:28.608
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really know how you get there.

18:28.628 --> 18:30.129
[SPEAKER_02]: Best plug ever.

18:30.149 --> 18:30.989
[SPEAKER_08]: But just find it.

18:31.490 --> 18:32.250
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so there you go.

18:34.411 --> 18:35.232
[SPEAKER_08]: And let's see.

18:35.272 --> 18:37.073
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really have a whole lot of other housekeeping.

18:37.093 --> 18:39.014
[SPEAKER_08]: I already talked about that we have new pictures coming.

18:39.074 --> 18:40.015
[SPEAKER_02]: I ate too much pizza.

18:40.335 --> 18:41.115
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry to hear that.

18:41.576 --> 18:42.356
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually hungry.

18:42.516 --> 18:43.797
[SPEAKER_08]: Eddie, you want to make another run to talk about?

18:44.097 --> 18:45.258
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want my breadsticks?

18:46.070 --> 18:47.070
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, can I have some breadsticks?

18:47.110 --> 18:47.331
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

18:47.451 --> 18:48.511
[SPEAKER_08]: I would heart you forever.

18:49.071 --> 18:49.351
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooray.

18:49.491 --> 18:52.733
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to eat breadsticks, and we're going to get into tonight's gaming news.

18:52.773 --> 18:53.733
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully, I'm not first.

18:54.573 --> 18:55.994
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Rob's first.

18:56.454 --> 18:56.734
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways.

18:56.754 --> 18:58.215
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm kidding.

18:58.935 --> 18:59.175
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

18:59.715 --> 19:05.898
[SPEAKER_07]: So, to start things off, let's talk about pathetic stuff, including how pathetic Lair was.

19:06.718 --> 19:13.261
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, personally, I haven't played it, so I don't know if it's pathetic, but based on people's reviews of it, you know, for example, IGN gave it a 4.9.

19:15.379 --> 19:20.182
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say it's pretty pathetic, and I guess, you know, there are some control issues and stuff like that.

19:20.682 --> 19:30.688
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, to, I guess, help save face, Sony has figured, you know what, the reason why our game is getting bad scores is because reviewers just don't know how to review our game.

19:32.189 --> 19:33.470
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's never a good argument.

19:33.610 --> 19:35.491
[SPEAKER_07]: So, what they did was they sent out...

19:36.403 --> 19:38.384
[SPEAKER_07]: Reviewers Guides for Lair.

19:38.884 --> 19:45.526
[SPEAKER_07]: They basically sent IGN a guide of how to review their game because they figure, oh, you're stupid and you don't know how to play our game.

19:47.147 --> 19:49.408
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that really makes you look cool.

19:50.868 --> 20:01.052
[SPEAKER_07]: So, apparently six of the 21 pages of the guide are devoted to the game's controls and I guess it has, you know, like a fact or something in it.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.533
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so retarded.

20:06.227 --> 20:08.510
[SPEAKER_08]: Ghost Guy in our chatroom says Lair is lame.

20:12.074 --> 20:12.374
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

20:12.975 --> 20:14.857
[SPEAKER_08]: I will withhold judgment until I have a chance to play it.

20:14.977 --> 20:15.838
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked good, though.

20:15.878 --> 20:22.185
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked like the game that could save the PlayStation 3 from all this, you know, that people are saying at it.

20:22.686 --> 20:24.107
[SPEAKER_08]: So what went wrong, Loki?

20:25.269 --> 20:25.369
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

20:26.132 --> 20:27.393
[SPEAKER_07]: It just kind of sucked.

20:28.054 --> 20:28.414
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

20:28.774 --> 20:32.517
[SPEAKER_07]: I think one of the things was, first off, you had to use the motion controls.

20:32.958 --> 20:35.860
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't just you can turn them off or it's optional.

20:35.920 --> 20:36.941
[SPEAKER_07]: You had to use them.

20:37.601 --> 20:38.762
[SPEAKER_07]: They were kind of floaty.

20:40.964 --> 20:43.306
[SPEAKER_07]: There was, I guess, some lag between certain things.

20:44.467 --> 20:44.787
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

20:44.827 --> 20:46.869
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a lot harder than people thought.

20:49.511 --> 20:55.736
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. DeBucket in our chat room at chat.orangesoundsradio.com says, Lair is better on PSP via remote play.

20:58.487 --> 21:00.388
[SPEAKER_07]: You know... Gimmick.

21:00.768 --> 21:01.568
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I'm saying.

21:02.028 --> 21:07.810
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, it's interesting that that gets brought up because it makes me think about the whole, like, DS Wii thing.

21:07.830 --> 21:09.510
[SPEAKER_08]: Shouldn't we have seen something with that by now?

21:09.790 --> 21:11.090
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I guess we have the Pokemon game, huh?

21:11.110 --> 21:14.251
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess we do have a little bit of connectivity, but nothing to this extent.

21:14.451 --> 21:15.992
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool, but here's the thing, though.

21:16.112 --> 21:26.134
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't want to get into other stories or anything, but I'm just saying, you know, the remote play isn't like... It's not like the DS thing with the Wii, where

21:26.690 --> 21:32.473
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's actually being used as a controller, and it actually has an earface on there and menus and stuff.

21:32.593 --> 21:34.414
[SPEAKER_07]: It's different than what's on the screen.

21:34.494 --> 21:37.395
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually, you know, kind of an accessory to the game.

21:37.756 --> 21:43.739
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas remote play is, look, I can play this from, you know, Starbucks down the street.

21:43.799 --> 21:46.120
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm playing my PlayStation 3 on my PSP.

21:46.640 --> 21:49.021
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it doesn't work completely.

21:49.922 --> 21:51.122
[SPEAKER_07]: Even that's kind of broken.

21:51.142 --> 21:54.424
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, sure, you can do it, but, you know, it's just like...

21:55.302 --> 21:55.963
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

22:17.600 --> 22:18.960
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

22:42.466 --> 22:45.988
[SPEAKER_07]: So is this possibly just the beginning of more to come for the console?

22:46.308 --> 22:53.330
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember when they were shown off the console and they had the Formula 1 racing game and they were like, look, you can use your PSP as a rearview mirror.

22:55.311 --> 22:55.731
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

22:56.451 --> 22:57.852
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would you do that?

22:58.892 --> 23:03.274
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just going to set it on a stand next to you or something.

23:03.514 --> 23:07.736
[SPEAKER_07]: They have rearview mirrors on your car model in the game.

23:08.076 --> 23:10.177
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would you need to have it on a separate screen?

23:10.297 --> 23:11.157
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a gimmick.

23:11.624 --> 23:12.505
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

23:33.410 --> 23:47.558
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some other... When they were doing it at the GameCube, too, there was some cooler, like, connectivity with the Game Boy Advance because, like, when you were playing, I think it was one of the Metal Gear games, something like that, it was, like, your sonar, and it was, like, having your own cool, like, device, but in the game.

23:47.618 --> 23:48.058
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

23:48.098 --> 23:53.601
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a gimmick, but it was, like, practical, too, so... Oh, I... No, here's the thing.

23:53.762 --> 23:56.183
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason why they did that is so that you can make...

23:56.821 --> 23:58.583
[SPEAKER_08]: The Racing Game More Like Real Life.

23:59.183 --> 24:03.367
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, Mr. DeBucket in chat wants to point out, it was a tech demo, you dumbass.

24:03.447 --> 24:04.668
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't even in the game.

24:04.848 --> 24:05.829
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, that's what I'm saying.

24:05.909 --> 24:06.790
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the tech demo.

24:06.810 --> 24:08.831
[SPEAKER_08]: It was when they were first showing the PlayStation 3 on.

24:08.892 --> 24:13.796
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes it more like real life because what you do is you get a woman to sit next to you while you drive.

24:14.036 --> 24:15.517
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's something I can throw at Rob right now?

24:15.557 --> 24:16.378
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not even finished.

24:16.738 --> 24:22.003
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have the PSP and the woman's watching and she's nagging about everything you're doing wrong.

24:22.083 --> 24:23.264
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's something I can throw at Rob?

24:23.863 --> 24:24.884
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me one of your Pikachus.

24:24.924 --> 24:26.206
[SPEAKER_08]: Throw one of these breadsticks.

24:26.586 --> 24:27.708
[SPEAKER_08]: These things will knock me out.

24:27.748 --> 24:28.629
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like rock solid.

24:28.649 --> 24:29.950
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, they're nasty.

24:29.970 --> 24:34.335
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the Operator 11 people heard me banging it against the wall earlier.

24:34.375 --> 24:35.156
[SPEAKER_08]: These things are tough.

24:35.697 --> 24:37.439
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, anyway, that's all I have to say.

24:37.639 --> 24:39.141
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay, because Rob drives like Grand Moff.

24:39.862 --> 24:40.162
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

24:40.182 --> 24:41.223
[SPEAKER_02]: See?

24:41.464 --> 24:42.705
[SPEAKER_07]: You're criticizing my driving!

24:59.538 --> 25:04.699
[SPEAKER_07]: Then why even put some half-assed control system in there that you can play this thing remotely?

25:04.779 --> 25:05.719
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stupid.

25:06.179 --> 25:11.320
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like those people that use their media center extender to view the internet on their 360.

25:12.220 --> 25:13.141
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stupid.

25:13.341 --> 25:14.181
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gimmicky.

25:14.221 --> 25:15.501
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need to do that.

25:16.361 --> 25:19.702
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if you'd like to comment on Loki's rants, we always welcome your emails.

25:19.802 --> 25:25.443
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com No, that's Loki at... Send them directly to Loki.

25:25.483 --> 25:26.243
[SPEAKER_02]: Send them to him.

25:27.293 --> 25:27.894
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need them.

25:28.374 --> 25:33.118
[SPEAKER_08]: And while you're at it, sign him up for lots of Nigerian bank lotteries.

25:33.198 --> 25:34.419
[SPEAKER_08]: I already get enough spam.

25:37.882 --> 25:41.404
[SPEAKER_08]: And Loki's definitely interested in anything you have on Viagra or Cialis.

25:41.845 --> 25:45.308
[SPEAKER_08]: I will forward all my email to you, Rob.

25:46.328 --> 25:47.750
[SPEAKER_02]: He also wants bigger breasts.

25:50.552 --> 25:51.613
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I'm done.

25:51.633 --> 25:53.114
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I wanted to say about the connectivity.

25:53.587 --> 26:05.337
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know our favorite crayon eater was going around in his days at Sony saying that the PS3 was a computer and a multimedia whatever.

26:06.238 --> 26:08.480
[SPEAKER_02]: Kaz Hirai, who is now the man again.

26:09.651 --> 26:15.836
[SPEAKER_02]: said, and I'm going to quote, I'd like to clearly say the PS3 is a game machine.

26:16.416 --> 26:17.537
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing more than that.

26:17.637 --> 26:18.317
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it is not.

26:18.438 --> 26:22.320
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, all their commercials say computer entertainment system.

26:22.380 --> 26:23.541
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fucking computer.

26:24.542 --> 26:25.283
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it is not.

26:25.383 --> 26:26.664
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Sony PlayStation.

26:26.884 --> 26:27.084
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

26:28.550 --> 26:29.611
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a fucking computer.

26:29.651 --> 26:30.652
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been saying computer.

26:30.732 --> 26:37.117
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because your fucking computer does not sell does not mean that you have to start calling it a game machine now.

26:37.757 --> 26:38.698
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fucking computer.

26:38.778 --> 26:39.418
[SPEAKER_07]: Stick with it.

26:39.558 --> 26:41.000
[SPEAKER_07]: Who turned Loki to 11 tonight?

26:41.100 --> 26:42.220
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I want to know.

26:43.762 --> 26:45.343
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you just make 10 louder?

26:46.055 --> 26:46.876
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

27:07.410 --> 27:07.970
[SPEAKER_08]: and many more.

27:30.215 --> 27:36.440
[SPEAKER_08]: What makes the PlayStation 3 a little bit appealing as well?

27:36.480 --> 27:40.003
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the one thing that has people more excited than anything about PlayStation 3?

27:40.703 --> 27:41.023
[SPEAKER_08]: Home.

27:41.584 --> 27:42.604
[SPEAKER_08]: Is home a game?

27:43.305 --> 27:45.406
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's kind of something outside the box.

27:45.827 --> 27:50.070
[SPEAKER_08]: So for them to go out and say a quote like this is a little bit like, huh?

27:51.098 --> 27:53.640
[SPEAKER_08]: But you're like the worst at being a game machine.

27:53.660 --> 27:55.101
[SPEAKER_08]: You do everything else really good.

27:55.241 --> 27:55.601
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

27:55.781 --> 27:56.141
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what?

27:56.221 --> 27:58.323
[SPEAKER_07]: People didn't care that you can load Linux on it.

27:58.363 --> 28:02.085
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why it's now a game system and not a fucking computer.

28:03.045 --> 28:05.027
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, okay, fine then.

28:05.327 --> 28:06.928
[SPEAKER_07]: $600 is too much for a game system.

28:08.789 --> 28:11.891
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, $600 was cheap for a computer, too much for a game system.

28:12.071 --> 28:13.552
[SPEAKER_07]: So now it's too much for a game system.

28:15.413 --> 28:15.913
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's see.

28:16.213 --> 28:20.955
[SPEAKER_08]: SonOfDad says, PlayStation 3 right now is a cheap Blu-ray player, no more, no less.

28:21.696 --> 28:24.097
[SPEAKER_08]: There might be some Sony fans that disagree, but I don't know.

28:24.137 --> 28:28.539
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I still have yet to buy a PlayStation 3 because, I have to admit, I feel kind of similar.

28:28.639 --> 28:30.639
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing out there to play.

28:31.040 --> 28:31.680
[SPEAKER_07]: Even, I mean...

28:33.135 --> 28:34.396
[SPEAKER_07]: Ratchet and Clank Future.

28:34.616 --> 28:35.577
[SPEAKER_08]: That looks pretty good.

28:35.797 --> 28:36.959
[SPEAKER_08]: And Resistance was good.

28:37.239 --> 28:41.042
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure when Final Fantasy XIII comes out, I'll be like, Hail Sony!

28:41.142 --> 28:42.163
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome into my house!

28:42.223 --> 28:43.084
[SPEAKER_08]: Hail PlayStation 3!

28:43.364 --> 28:43.865
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you!

28:44.005 --> 28:47.528
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then you'll have a lot of time to save up money when it comes out Spring 2009.

28:49.339 --> 28:50.679
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the current release?

28:50.860 --> 29:00.502
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just guessing, because, you know, this shit... I mean, because it'll come out in Japan, you know, probably Christmas next year or something, and then we'll see it maybe spring or summer of 2009.

29:01.443 --> 29:02.083
[SPEAKER_07]: But don't worry!

29:02.283 --> 29:02.723
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't worry!

29:02.823 --> 29:05.624
[SPEAKER_07]: Good games are coming to the PlayStation 3 someday.

29:06.624 --> 29:07.044
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

29:08.505 --> 29:09.765
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Jamie, for the quote.

29:09.805 --> 29:12.666
[SPEAKER_08]: It certainly livened up our show a little bit tonight.

29:13.086 --> 29:13.426
[SPEAKER_07]: Meh.

29:15.386 --> 29:16.147
[SPEAKER_08]: Except for you.

29:16.627 --> 29:17.047
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways...

29:20.709 --> 29:23.230
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so guess what?

29:23.570 --> 29:26.950
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't talk about PSP Homebrew on the official Sony forums.

29:29.891 --> 29:32.612
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, surprise.

29:32.632 --> 29:36.252
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't talk about cracking their system on their own forums.

29:37.613 --> 29:38.833
[SPEAKER_07]: How dare they do that?

29:39.133 --> 29:43.574
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm more concerned with the fact that it took them this long to ban that chat.

29:44.054 --> 29:44.274
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

29:45.438 --> 29:49.221
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, the PSP is only a game system.

29:49.481 --> 29:50.562
[SPEAKER_07]: You shouldn't be doing other things on there.

29:50.602 --> 29:51.783
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up and read the story.

29:52.603 --> 30:02.231
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, if you talk about homebrew, you will be banned from Sony's official chatroom or forum.

30:02.931 --> 30:03.492
[SPEAKER_07]: And guess what?

30:04.132 --> 30:05.713
[SPEAKER_07]: We ban you!

30:06.154 --> 30:14.420
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we're on the topic of homebrew, it should not be a surprise that with the PlayStation Slim coming out,

30:15.368 --> 30:16.329
[SPEAKER_07]: The PlayStation Portable Slim

30:37.955 --> 30:43.880
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I know I can say this, and it won't go anywhere, so nobody tell him, but I think I know what I'm going to get William for.

30:44.200 --> 30:44.981
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm totally serious here.

30:45.001 --> 30:46.462
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I know what I'm going to get William for his birthday.

30:46.482 --> 30:47.723
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to get him a PSP Slim.

30:48.203 --> 30:51.426
[SPEAKER_08]: Because funny enough, William is a huge Sony fanboy.

30:52.167 --> 30:53.107
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know what it is.

30:53.368 --> 31:00.713
[SPEAKER_08]: He doesn't even play a whole lot of video games, but every time we go into Best Buy, we'll be looking at MotorStorm or whatever, and he's always like, don't you want a PlayStation 3?

31:01.034 --> 31:01.374
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at it.

31:01.414 --> 31:02.034
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so beautiful.

31:02.075 --> 31:03.316
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you have a PlayStation 3 in your house?

31:03.336 --> 31:04.236
[SPEAKER_08]: You have another game system.

31:04.256 --> 31:05.017
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you get a PlayStation 3?

31:05.077 --> 31:06.358
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, are you going to buy me one?

31:06.798 --> 31:07.299
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, no.

31:08.459 --> 31:35.915
[SPEAKER_08]: but I think he really wants a PSP so I'm going to get him one because he thinks they're cool but I'm going to get him the Slim because they're new and then I can go look it's a new toy too and I think he'll get a kick out of that so Sony fanboys who are pissed off at the show right now because we're knocking Sony I just thought I'd let you know they are still getting some of our money because I do think the PSP is pretty awesome now it was a slow start but then again the DS had a slow start too so what can you say well

31:36.863 --> 31:44.067
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, one thing, of course, that you can play on those PSPs is Lair, which goes back and forth, you know, with a little remote connectivity.

31:44.387 --> 31:46.728
[SPEAKER_08]: But yes, we have one more Lair story for you guys.

31:47.528 --> 31:51.671
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a brand new hot coffee mode that's been discovered inside Lair.

31:51.711 --> 31:55.813
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, there's a hot coffee mode, except it's not really what you think.

31:56.673 --> 32:00.335
[SPEAKER_08]: If you actually watch the video of the hot coffee mode...

32:00.891 --> 32:09.815
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually just something you unlock where somebody brews a pot of hot coffee.

32:10.515 --> 32:17.879
[SPEAKER_08]: All you have to do is enter in this big long string at the cheat menu and you'll be welcomed with this video of somebody making hot coffee.

32:18.839 --> 32:20.520
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best joke ever.

32:21.741 --> 32:24.482
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of stupid, but it's stupid funny.

32:25.262 --> 32:27.183
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a Jim Carrey movie, it's stupid funny.

32:28.184 --> 32:29.004
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

32:29.471 --> 32:38.553
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, that code that you can enter in, 686-F7-420-636-F66666565.

32:39.154 --> 32:42.734
[SPEAKER_08]: If you missed any part of this show and need a transcription, get out a pen next time.

32:42.774 --> 32:43.215
[SPEAKER_07]: And guess what?

32:43.235 --> 32:48.816
[SPEAKER_07]: Those also happen to be the reviews that this game got as well.

32:50.016 --> 32:51.137
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job, Loki.

32:52.597 --> 32:56.478
[SPEAKER_07]: Just as I was reminded in the chat room, though, the

32:57.028 --> 33:11.037
[SPEAKER_07]: PSP is, I guess, they've already cracked the firmware and they're going to be releasing a, I guess, Team M33 is going to be releasing a CFW 3.6 firmware for it.

33:14.139 --> 33:16.340
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one of the better jokes we've had in a while on this program.

33:16.360 --> 33:17.000
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job, Loki.

33:17.781 --> 33:20.462
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, chatroom, now you two get to beat that one into the ground.

33:21.443 --> 33:23.444

[SPEAKER_08]: Hitstun asks, do they get Virtua Fighter 5 360 before we do?

33:59.928 --> 34:01.529
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure.

34:02.989 --> 34:03.930
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably about the same week, right?

34:03.950 --> 34:05.410
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting the last week of October.

34:06.611 --> 34:06.931

[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's go to some release dates and travel the world and see what's coming out right now in all different places, not just from Sega.

34:14.914 --> 34:16.114
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.

34:16.274 --> 34:17.835
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, this week's actually pretty good.

34:17.855 --> 34:23.717
[SPEAKER_07]: We're starting to get into some of the better stuff, you know, fourth quarter stuff for all systems.

34:24.187 --> 34:34.114
[SPEAKER_07]: and I know next week, well, I'm not a huge fan of it, but NHL 08 and NHL 2K8 are both coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and 360.

[SPEAKER_07]: Then we have EA's competition for Tony Hawk's Skate that's also going to be coming out next week.

34:44.121 --> 34:44.982
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

35:39.197 --> 35:45.678
[SPEAKER_07]: On 360, you will be getting the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Game of the Year Edition.

35:45.758 --> 35:50.599
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be including both the expansion, I believe, and some of the download content for that.

35:50.819 --> 35:56.600
[SPEAKER_08]: In other words, this is the release that fucks you all over who bought the game originally at full price and then all the expansions at full price.

35:56.620 --> 35:58.441
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want the PlayStation 3 one, guess what?

35:58.481 --> 35:59.201
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not coming out.

35:59.261 --> 35:59.901
[SPEAKER_07]: It got delayed.

36:00.481 --> 36:06.302
[SPEAKER_07]: Fatal Inertia is also coming out on 360 next week, as well as Kengo, Legend of the Nine.

36:36.027 --> 36:36.888
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that'd be cool.

36:37.048 --> 36:39.811
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, if you're a music game fan, Jam Sessions.

36:39.931 --> 36:45.097
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually thinking about picking this up just because I need some guitar stuff in the mixes I do.

36:45.257 --> 36:46.919
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Jam Sessions.

36:48.427 --> 36:49.467
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

37:09.192 --> 37:13.717
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo Wii, SSX Blur PlayStation 3, Megazone 23, Ali Garland Old School Anime

37:26.681 --> 37:27.042
[SPEAKER_02]: Happiness Deluxe

37:40.541 --> 37:43.362
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's even better, it's made by Marvelous Entertainment.

37:43.402 --> 37:43.903
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.

37:44.243 --> 37:45.263
[SPEAKER_11]: It's marvelously happy.

37:45.644 --> 37:48.425
[SPEAKER_08]: And Sega's putting out yet another Pachinko game.

37:48.925 --> 37:49.265
[SPEAKER_08]: No!

37:49.285 --> 37:54.988
[SPEAKER_08]: Tyson Pachinko, he's... Sakura Tyson is coming out.

37:55.008 --> 37:55.729
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I want to see?

37:55.809 --> 37:58.010
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, dude, they're doing a Sakura Tyson Pachinko?

37:58.130 --> 38:00.871
[SPEAKER_07]: They should have a Pachinko Xbox Live Arcade game.

38:01.591 --> 38:02.112
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be funny.

38:02.392 --> 38:03.452
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be actually pretty rad.

38:03.472 --> 38:04.553
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be pretty great.

38:05.160 --> 38:06.220
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

38:31.923 --> 38:32.744
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Dolphin!

38:32.924 --> 38:34.165
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming to the Nintendo DS.

38:34.565 --> 38:35.246
[SPEAKER_08]: Dolphin safe.

38:35.346 --> 38:36.968
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know they make a vibrator for the Dolphin?

38:37.028 --> 38:40.691
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, some Pokemon games and SimCity DS, you know, blah blah blah.

38:41.111 --> 38:42.232
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I can't forget the PSP.

38:42.272 --> 38:43.994
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see if there's anything on the PSP worth mentioning.

38:44.214 --> 38:44.654
[SPEAKER_08]: Crap!

38:44.814 --> 38:45.675
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Crisis Core!

38:46.236 --> 38:47.997
[SPEAKER_08]: Shit, I think there's a lot of people really excited about that.

38:48.037 --> 38:51.941
[SPEAKER_08]: Crisis Core also out on September 13th, as well as Fate Tiger Coliseum.

38:52.661 --> 38:52.961
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh.

38:53.762 --> 38:54.122
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

38:54.983 --> 38:56.104
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are your release dates for Japan.

38:56.384 --> 38:57.926
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how about for our friends in the UK?

38:59.986 --> 39:17.320
[SPEAKER_02]: Blazing Angels Secret Missions of World War 2 CSI Three Dimensions of Murder Dungeons and Dragons Tactics for PSP Fatal Inertia on Xbox 360 Freshly Picked Tingles Rosy Rupeeland Hooray!

39:18.781 --> 39:20.943
[SPEAKER_02]: Freshly Picked Tingles, I love those!

39:22.264 --> 39:23.185
[SPEAKER_02]: That's on the DS.

39:23.605 --> 39:25.707
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope it never comes over here.

39:25.747 --> 39:26.607
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to import it.

39:27.748 --> 39:28.429
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be in English.

39:28.857 --> 39:32.079
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Heavenly... English, English.

39:33.360 --> 39:34.840
[SPEAKER_02]: That means there'll be extra vowels.

39:36.781 --> 39:38.042
[SPEAKER_02]: Extra vowels make everything better.

39:38.843 --> 39:51.109
[SPEAKER_02]: Heavenly Sword on PlayStation 3, Heroes of Mana, which we already have over here, MotoGP07, Sonic Rush Adventure on the 14th, Stranglehold, Super Paper Mario on Wii.

39:53.311 --> 39:53.651
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

39:53.671 --> 39:53.731
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

39:54.873 --> 40:04.037
[SPEAKER_08]: Something you guys were talking about reminded me of one other thing that I really missed in Final Fantasy XI, and that was boss monsters with no vowels in their name.

40:04.677 --> 40:08.619
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, Xrrr, is the name of a dragon.

40:08.659 --> 40:11.460
[SPEAKER_08]: Or no, I think there's a dragon you have to fight called Vrth.

40:15.735 --> 40:17.837
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times!

40:18.477 --> 40:23.522
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, as with most games, they've been getting updates and patches every now and then.

40:23.902 --> 40:31.489
[SPEAKER_07]: And one in particular that happened this last week was Bioshock got a title update to fix a few things.

40:32.150 --> 40:33.491
[SPEAKER_07]: Just some minor stuff, I guess.

40:34.232 --> 40:39.897
[SPEAKER_07]: Updates improve stability when loading autosaves, and overall game stability corrects audio during

40:40.878 --> 40:45.220
[SPEAKER_07]: and addresses AI behaviors regarding health stations.

40:46.601 --> 40:48.842
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of interesting.

40:48.942 --> 41:06.170
[SPEAKER_07]: Another interesting thing though is of course people picking apart the PC version found a couple of notations for Plasmid Pack 1 which is believed to be a download that's going to happen later on including some brand new plasmids that you'll be able to buy from the machines and whatnot.

41:06.691 --> 41:09.232
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully we'll see some download content a little bit later on

41:10.480 --> 41:12.361
[SPEAKER_07]: But of course, nothing official yet.

41:15.663 --> 41:16.064
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

41:17.684 --> 41:18.345
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm choking on breath.

41:18.365 --> 41:21.166
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I just sounded like a murloc just then.

41:22.427 --> 41:23.208
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, keep talking.

41:23.248 --> 41:24.548
[SPEAKER_08]: It's rude of me to talk with my mouth full.

41:25.849 --> 41:27.150
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be awesome.

41:27.210 --> 41:28.951
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking forward to some new plasmids.

41:31.012 --> 41:32.033
[SPEAKER_02]: You like new plasma?

41:32.993 --> 41:33.774
[SPEAKER_07]: New plasmids.

41:33.974 --> 41:35.014
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought you said plasma.

41:35.034 --> 41:37.516
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, there's people who recycle their plasma.

41:38.129 --> 41:39.590
[SPEAKER_07]: No, new plasmids for the game.

41:40.090 --> 41:40.810
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this show.

41:41.370 --> 41:44.091
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you know what you should check out if you dig that Drawn to Life?

41:44.332 --> 41:53.115
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a game that nobody knows about for GameCube called Monster Island, where you could basically create your own monsters, draw them out on a screen, and then play them in various competitions.

41:53.155 --> 41:53.795
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very cool.

41:53.835 --> 41:54.916
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't that like Magic Penjel?

41:54.936 --> 41:58.197
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they had Magic Penjel, and they had Graffiti Kingdom that were also the same type of thing.

41:58.217 --> 41:59.057
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was cool, though.

41:59.097 --> 42:00.618
[SPEAKER_04]: It was good times, if you like that kind of thing.

42:00.758 --> 42:07.821
[SPEAKER_07]: Magic Penjel, I had a 2DX system that was fighting, and we also had poppin' music, and

42:08.430 --> 42:11.211
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I think people drew a penis monster as well.

42:12.251 --> 42:13.551
[SPEAKER_02]: Penis monster was great.

42:13.951 --> 42:15.872
[SPEAKER_02]: I really have to say the penis monster was good.

42:16.372 --> 42:21.193
[SPEAKER_02]: My character... That's, you know, some people don't like that.

42:21.213 --> 42:22.913
[SPEAKER_07]: The game is easy to exploit, though.

42:22.953 --> 42:30.715
[SPEAKER_07]: My character was just like a teddy bear, and I'd draw this big square that would be attached to it, and it'd be all blue, which would give you more magic attack or something.

42:30.735 --> 42:33.176
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the attack of the penis monster?

42:33.836 --> 42:34.916
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd poke it.

42:38.351 --> 42:41.753
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it have a similar attack as to a squid?

42:42.153 --> 42:44.114
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what happened when you poked it?

42:44.234 --> 42:45.915
[SPEAKER_02]: It would just sit and hunch over.

42:47.376 --> 42:49.657
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because you weren't doing it right.

42:49.937 --> 43:01.024
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoever drew the penis monster, it thought that the hair that someone drew on the testicles was actually legs.

43:01.104 --> 43:03.325
[SPEAKER_07]: So it would walk around on legs of this giant thing.

43:04.546 --> 43:07.047
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the worst Pokemon type game ever.

43:09.158 --> 43:12.241
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that is something we need for fucking Operator 11.

43:13.562 --> 43:18.127
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, too bad the cam just shut off on Op 11 like five minutes ago because we got booted out from time feeds.

43:18.147 --> 43:20.249
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we can only do 40 minute shows on there, but whatever.

43:20.269 --> 43:22.772
[SPEAKER_08]: What was I going to say?

43:23.272 --> 43:28.698
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, Jason, Webmaster Jason, remind me to mark this episode explicit, please, a little later.

43:29.598 --> 43:30.019
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

43:32.611 --> 43:40.475
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously though, if you can find Magic Pendulum or even better, Graffiti Kingdom, that game is really fun, especially... For five minutes.

43:40.835 --> 43:42.076
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's not fun for five minutes.

43:42.836 --> 43:49.399
[SPEAKER_07]: You get your friends over and you're like, you can draw your own characters and give them just time and eventually something perverted is going to come out of it.

43:49.419 --> 43:52.541
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we tried to draw a vagina monster so they could fight, but we ran out of ink.

43:57.323 --> 43:59.064
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we got the... Never mind.

43:59.104 --> 44:02.226
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to get into female anatomy, but probably I shouldn't do that.

44:03.326 --> 44:04.406
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, what was I going to say?

44:05.927 --> 44:07.929
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. DeBucket says Wangzilla for the win.

44:08.549 --> 44:10.310
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, oh, I like this quote from Mr. DeBucket.

44:10.430 --> 44:13.472
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't every GameCube game a game for GameCube that no one knows about?

44:14.593 --> 44:14.793
Aww.

44:16.414 --> 44:16.935
[SPEAKER_08]: Touche.

44:17.055 --> 44:20.037
[SPEAKER_08]: Drew Nami says, I think I still have a save file with the penis monster.

44:21.298 --> 44:24.760
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right, because that was the day that we had Paper Plate Battle Royale.

44:26.201 --> 44:31.945
[SPEAKER_08]: Son of Dad is thinking that the movie Superbad, the end credits, is suddenly reminding him of our discussion right now.

44:32.864 --> 44:38.308
[SPEAKER_08]: so go figure anyhow moving from Penis Monster back to Bioshock

44:41.815 --> 44:43.136
[SPEAKER_08]: God, what can I say about this?

44:43.176 --> 44:51.064
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, somebody posted on the 2K forums about that basically his brother and him were trying to play the game Bioshock together.

44:51.465 --> 44:57.471
[SPEAKER_08]: But the game wouldn't let him because, as you may know, Bioshock on the PC only limits you to activate your account so many times.

44:57.771 --> 45:00.314
[SPEAKER_08]: You only get like five activations for the game and then that's it.

45:00.354 --> 45:00.874
[SPEAKER_08]: You're cut off.

45:00.934 --> 45:01.275
[SPEAKER_08]: No more.

45:01.655 --> 45:04.077
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's been a very controversial maneuver.

45:04.117 --> 45:05.359
[SPEAKER_08]: But what happened, okay...

45:05.979 --> 45:14.473
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy named 2KTechJT responded, There's no other way to view this, is one user has purchased the game, not the whole family.

45:14.853 --> 45:16.876
[SPEAKER_08]: So why should your brother play for free?

45:17.778 --> 45:19.480
[SPEAKER_08]: To which everybody goes, um...

45:20.143 --> 45:22.124
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, hasn't it always been that way?

45:22.224 --> 45:31.687
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if you bring a traditional CD, let's say Xbox 360 or PlayStation 2 game home, and, you know, everybody gets to use that game, right?

45:32.047 --> 45:33.387
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, this is nothing normal.

45:33.407 --> 45:41.570
[SPEAKER_07]: If you buy a CD, everybody in the house... Or how about they, if he wants his brother to play, how about you just log into your brother's account on Windows and fucking play the game?

45:41.730 --> 45:45.591
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of being a little whiny bitch about, I don't want to install it on mine!

45:45.771 --> 45:48.072
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a certain amount of, you know...

45:49.893 --> 45:52.934
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say that I don't let anybody else use my computer.

45:54.254 --> 45:57.095
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, stop being so fucking lazy and just do what you need to do.

46:18.672 --> 46:20.332
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

46:38.075 --> 46:42.359
[SPEAKER_08]: Please note that the forum moderator has been incorrectly quoted as a 2K employee.

46:42.739 --> 46:48.744
[SPEAKER_08]: The individual JT Tech 2K works for an outside tech support group and is not an employee of 2K.

46:49.184 --> 46:51.606
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, 2K is investigating the validity of the post.

46:56.311 --> 46:57.532
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

47:23.168 --> 47:25.189
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki from Orange Lounge Radio reminding you to think of the children.

47:25.209 --> 47:25.590
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I'm done.

47:52.008 --> 47:53.308
[SPEAKER_02]: Think of how tasty they are.

48:12.580 --> 48:31.495
[SPEAKER_02]: So for some news regarding, again, more information in the UK, it says that the sales for the Xbox 360 are up, actually have increased, and the PSP is having their worst week since launch.

48:33.077 --> 48:34.698
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor Sony, baby.

48:37.168 --> 49:05.431
[SPEAKER_02]: but at any rate what they're claiming is responsible for the increase in Xbox 360 sales would be the Elite model and the other price reductions for the Premium and Core systems which are I guess making people really crazy about wanting them however with the upcoming launches for the Slim PSP on September 14th overseas people just still don't care

49:06.072 --> 49:10.175
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I was going to say, without sounding like an ass, I mean, this isn't like a fanboy or whatever.

49:11.616 --> 49:16.400
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this news is only temporary because the Slims are coming out and because Christmas Hello is right around the corner.

49:16.420 --> 49:17.221
[SPEAKER_08]: I still think people don't care.

49:17.241 --> 49:18.301
[SPEAKER_08]: Sales for everything are going to pick up.

49:19.282 --> 49:19.843
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we'll see.

49:21.464 --> 49:21.924
[SPEAKER_08]: We will see.

49:24.026 --> 49:25.487
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways.

49:26.508 --> 49:29.410
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the Xbox HD DVD...

49:30.356 --> 49:31.418
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

49:45.572 --> 49:47.453
[SPEAKER_07]: Get a little bit of a discount.

49:47.593 --> 49:56.138
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if it's going on over there as well, but I know over here, once you buy it, you do get a rebate for five free HD DVD movies.

49:56.238 --> 49:56.678
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuckers.

49:57.039 --> 49:58.940
[SPEAKER_08]: Not when I bought my HD DVD player.

49:59.040 --> 49:59.920
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I got?

50:00.220 --> 50:01.061
[SPEAKER_07]: King Kong.

50:01.581 --> 50:02.962
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still in the wrapping.

50:03.522 --> 50:04.383
[SPEAKER_07]: I just would like to point out.

50:05.223 --> 50:06.664
[SPEAKER_07]: You can also get Blu-ray players, too.

50:06.684 --> 50:07.705
[SPEAKER_07]: They're kind of doing the same thing.

50:08.665 --> 50:13.088
[SPEAKER_07]: They are desperate for people to adopt the next-gen video formats, but...

50:14.417 --> 50:15.758
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think they're feeling a little heat?

50:15.799 --> 50:22.608
[SPEAKER_08]: Because whether you want to say it's thanks to the PlayStation 3 or whatever, Blu-ray does seem to be pushing a little more of the market share.

50:25.117 --> 50:31.739
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but really, I mean, they're counting them as players, Blu-ray players, but really how many people are actually using them for Blu-ray?

50:31.779 --> 50:33.979
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the thing, is there is no way of showing that.

50:33.999 --> 50:34.739
[SPEAKER_05]: If I had one, I would be.

50:35.019 --> 50:37.000
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, but there's no way of showing it.

50:37.020 --> 50:45.542
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because, yeah, okay, I use mine for Blu-ray movies sometimes, but I can count on one hand how many times I've watched a Blu-ray movie on there.

50:45.562 --> 50:47.422
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's not a lot.

50:47.482 --> 50:49.163
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't use the system at all.

50:50.523 --> 50:54.684
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I bought an HD DVD player, I don't think I would use it any more than I'm using...

50:55.303 --> 50:57.684
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

50:57.964 --> 51:07.468
[SPEAKER_07]: Personally, I would not buy an add-on for the 360 for any sort of next-gen video format because at least with the PlayStation 3, if Blu-ray doesn't win out, big deal.

51:07.528 --> 51:08.708
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fucking game machine.

51:09.888 --> 51:11.029
[SPEAKER_07]: Computer, my mistake.

51:12.349 --> 51:19.912
[SPEAKER_07]: And if, you know, say, HDTV doesn't win out, then you're stuck with this fucking external drive for, you know, you can't do anything with.

51:20.732 --> 51:22.133
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know.

51:24.045 --> 51:33.093
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, now one period of time when you're going to have to watch these movies on the HD DVD is a four-hour period between 2 a.m.

51:33.173 --> 51:36.376
[SPEAKER_08]: tonight and 9 in the, or I'm sorry, it actually starts at 2 a.m.

51:36.416 --> 51:38.057
[SPEAKER_08]: tonight and runs to 6 a.m.

51:38.818 --> 51:40.620
[SPEAKER_08]: That's because Xbox Live is going to be down.

51:41.080 --> 51:51.009
[SPEAKER_08]: So sorry, kids, you're going to have to hold off on yelling the N-word and the F-A-G-word at each other for four hours while the system is down because that's all people really do on Xbox Live.

51:53.430 --> 51:58.093
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, by the way, I... So they call each other nice and fancy?

52:01.656 --> 52:04.358
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they call each other nice and fancy.

52:07.100 --> 52:09.241
[SPEAKER_05]: See, you're not helping your hole.

52:09.421 --> 52:12.844
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to call me Casper instead of Big Gay Eddie.

52:15.806 --> 52:16.486
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever, Rob.

52:16.506 --> 52:17.547
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just the big silly.

52:18.988 --> 52:21.410
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, guys, you just fragged me.

52:21.750 --> 52:22.931
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't that fancy?

52:22.951 --> 52:23.051
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

52:25.794 --> 52:29.537
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, look at me, I'm on the ground now, all helpless and laid down.

52:29.557 --> 52:33.079
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be awful if someone violated me.

52:36.261 --> 52:40.424
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I see you're squatting over and over again above my pelvis.

52:40.844 --> 52:41.945
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that nice?

52:42.045 --> 52:43.346
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that fancy?

52:43.366 --> 52:46.868
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell is wrong with you, Eddie?

52:47.749 --> 52:50.891
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because you've been watching what I do on Saturday nights by myself.

52:51.791 --> 52:52.712
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't make fun of me.

52:58.338 --> 53:05.378
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderdog Harold says in our chatroom Snagglepuss is on Xbox Live

53:14.779 --> 53:16.100
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox Live is going to be down.

53:16.140 --> 53:16.641
[SPEAKER_05]: Get over it.

53:16.701 --> 53:20.144
[SPEAKER_05]: By the time most of you downloaded the podcast, it's already done anyway.

53:20.484 --> 53:23.086
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've spent far too long on this useless story.

53:23.647 --> 53:25.168
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, please save the show.

53:25.348 --> 53:29.812
[SPEAKER_07]: I like how Ranma says, fag, fancy, articulate guys.

53:30.253 --> 53:34.036
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, who said that?

53:34.897 --> 53:35.277
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma.

53:35.377 --> 53:36.438
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma, you're the best.

53:36.478 --> 53:36.819
[SPEAKER_04]: You're awesome.

53:36.839 --> 53:38.280
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you talking about a cigarette?

53:39.861 --> 53:41.643
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a fancy, articulate guy.

53:42.350 --> 53:48.734
[SPEAKER_02]: So according to Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry... Man, they're old.

53:50.675 --> 53:51.436
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sorry.

53:51.816 --> 53:53.897
[SPEAKER_02]: Aerosmith is really awesome, don't get me wrong.

53:54.818 --> 54:00.381
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, I see really good pictures of all of them, and then I see really old pictures of all of them.

54:00.661 --> 54:02.282
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I look at Keith Richards and feel better.

54:02.923 --> 54:09.807
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, since they're working hand-in-hand with the folks behind Guitar Hero 4...

54:10.965 --> 54:18.189
[SPEAKER_02]: and they are going to be the the game is pretty much going to be Aerosmith Edition Guitar Hero.

54:18.449 --> 54:22.431
[SPEAKER_07]: So they told Aerosmith, yeah, it's all going to be about you.

54:22.912 --> 54:24.353
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally about you.

54:24.633 --> 54:25.273
[SPEAKER_07]: Please be in our game.

54:26.854 --> 54:32.717
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there will be other stuff, of course, but the hope is that the master tracks are Aerosmith, so that'd be cool.

54:34.178 --> 54:36.179
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I have a bad joke for you guys.

54:38.020 --> 54:39.661
[SPEAKER_08]: What did Steven Tyler say about

54:39.946 --> 54:42.647
[SPEAKER_08]: when Activision asked him to be in the next Guitar Hero game.

54:44.068 --> 54:44.969
[SPEAKER_08]: What did he say?

54:49.811 --> 54:51.752
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that was... That's fancy talk.

54:54.593 --> 54:56.434
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty accurate as being crappy.

54:58.755 --> 55:01.937
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways... I think something was in the breadsticks at this point.

55:03.138 --> 55:05.859
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even eat the breadsticks, Rob, and I'm turning gay.

55:06.059 --> 55:06.800
[SPEAKER_04]: You smelled them.

55:09.541 --> 55:09.601
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

55:10.399 --> 55:11.620
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

55:33.023 --> 55:40.829
[SPEAKER_07]: I was confirming with our boss that we need to do a road trip if they happen to be down here pretty soon.

55:40.909 --> 55:44.952
[SPEAKER_07]: So it looks like actually in the next couple weeks, the 23rd or 23rd, they're going to be in Sacramento.

55:44.992 --> 55:46.112
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll have to go check it out.

55:46.253 --> 55:48.935
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, are we going to go to the rock band show and have some fun?

55:49.155 --> 55:50.696
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm going to go see They Might Be Giants.

55:51.829 --> 55:53.350
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be here for three days.

55:53.550 --> 55:55.412
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to see They Might Be Giants for three days?

55:55.492 --> 55:58.414
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm going to see them for one day, and that's about as much concert as I can stand.

55:58.734 --> 55:59.735
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a concert.

55:59.875 --> 56:00.636
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a play the game.

56:00.676 --> 56:01.817
[SPEAKER_08]: You make your own concert.

56:01.837 --> 56:02.597
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, play the game.

56:02.678 --> 56:03.258
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

56:03.738 --> 56:04.319
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then no.

56:04.459 --> 56:05.960
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's what we do here on the show, Jamie.

56:05.980 --> 56:07.641
[SPEAKER_08]: We talk about playing games, remember?

56:07.862 --> 56:08.162
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no.

56:11.297 --> 56:13.498
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, Loki, will you go to the Rock Band tour with me?

56:14.298 --> 56:14.938
[SPEAKER_07]: I will definitely go.

56:14.958 --> 56:18.099
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if it's going to be with you, though, but I will try to make it out there.

56:18.119 --> 56:18.739
[SPEAKER_07]: Gee, thanks.

56:18.919 --> 56:22.080
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, sorry, I don't know if I'm going to... Yeah, I'm definitely going to go.

56:22.100 --> 56:23.020
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably won't go with you.

56:23.540 --> 56:27.901
[SPEAKER_07]: I will make a trip out there with you, but I will also make a trip out there maybe with my work.

56:28.601 --> 56:33.202
[SPEAKER_07]: I will not, on either of those trips, be singing in the game.

56:33.543 --> 56:34.523
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck that shit.

56:34.963 --> 56:39.044
[SPEAKER_07]: If it comes down, well, all we got left is karaoke for you, I'll be like, fuck you, I'm leaving.

56:39.950 --> 56:44.173
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I thought I heard somebody say that we're doing some type of concert for the thing.

56:44.213 --> 56:45.214
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.

56:45.735 --> 56:46.475
[SPEAKER_07]: You're the concert.

56:46.495 --> 56:53.600
[SPEAKER_07]: They basically have this giant semi-truck and there's a stage that they have set up and you play a game.

56:54.381 --> 56:54.761
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

56:54.801 --> 56:55.822
[SPEAKER_08]: Screw you, Loki.

56:55.942 --> 56:57.023
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take Gay Eddie with me.

56:57.543 --> 56:58.424
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go do it.

56:58.604 --> 56:59.685
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go play the game.

56:59.705 --> 57:00.085
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

57:00.245 --> 57:00.666
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fine.

57:00.766 --> 57:01.086
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go.

57:01.206 --> 57:04.148
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, Rob, when you sing, it's nice and fancy.

57:05.469 --> 57:06.530
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be the fancy band.

57:08.100 --> 57:10.962
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, we'll be the fancy band boys, oh my god.

57:12.944 --> 57:13.944
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's what you should be.

57:14.485 --> 57:17.487
[SPEAKER_07]: We are the fancy articulate guys.

57:19.068 --> 57:20.869
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you're so silly, I love you so much.

57:23.071 --> 57:26.313
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, Sal, we're going to get hate mail.

57:26.333 --> 57:29.456
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I really am gay, so I don't hate gay people.

57:29.516 --> 57:31.877
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you really talk like that, that's cool, I don't care.

57:32.658 --> 57:33.118
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just funny.

57:34.459 --> 57:35.520
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can film it.

57:38.729 --> 57:44.211
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, speaking of Rock Band, there's some new songs.

57:44.291 --> 57:44.992
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

57:45.212 --> 57:48.793
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one of the most horrible pictures I have ever seen on this computer.

57:48.813 --> 57:49.693
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that Courtney Love?

57:49.753 --> 57:50.994
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that Courtney Love?

57:52.475 --> 57:53.055
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it is.

57:53.535 --> 57:54.315
[SPEAKER_10]: That is Courtney Love.

57:54.335 --> 57:57.597
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, by the way, she'll be making an appearance in Rock Band, you should know.

57:57.897 --> 58:04.459
[SPEAKER_08]: Celebrity Skin by Hole will be in Rock Band, as well as the Yeah Yeah Yeah's Maps and the Pixies' Wave of Mutilation.

58:04.759 --> 58:05.980
[SPEAKER_08]: But very exciting to me.

58:06.200 --> 58:08.281
[SPEAKER_08]: I love this song, Garbages, I Think I'm Paranoid.

58:08.701 --> 58:09.361
[SPEAKER_08]: The Pixies, that's cool.

58:34.267 --> 58:38.949
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, come on, who does not remember the video to Black Hole Sun back from the days when MTV was cool?

58:39.750 --> 58:45.813
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, by the way, thank you to our live listeners tonight for choosing us over to those skanky awards shows that are going on in MTV right now.

58:45.833 --> 58:46.573
[SPEAKER_11]: Back in the day?

58:46.613 --> 58:47.374
[SPEAKER_08]: Back in the day, yes.

58:48.314 --> 58:50.275
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my freshman year of college.

58:50.315 --> 58:51.175
[SPEAKER_08]: Back in the day.

58:52.096 --> 58:53.997
[SPEAKER_02]: How old are you?

58:54.017 --> 58:53.997
31.

58:56.538 --> 58:56.938
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

58:57.639 --> 59:00.840
[SPEAKER_08]: She's just a fabulously accessorized girl.

59:01.281 --> 59:02.101
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all she is.

59:03.653 --> 59:04.373
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.

59:04.973 --> 59:10.835
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, that's all I have to say on... Well, speaking of things from back in Rob's day, no, I'm kidding.

59:11.955 --> 59:18.076
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Band is also saying there will be 18 master recordings from the Grateful Dead as downloadable content.

59:19.216 --> 59:19.796
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that cool?

59:20.497 --> 59:22.677
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, gosh, I hope it has Keep On Truckin' in it.

59:22.937 --> 59:27.678
[SPEAKER_02]: Truckin' is one, Uncle John's Band, Touch of Grey, Sugar Magnolia, and Casey Jones.

59:28.018 --> 59:32.499
[SPEAKER_07]: And my best, or my favorite part about the whole thing is they still haven't announced what the price point's gonna be.

59:33.744 --> 59:36.426
[SPEAKER_07]: GhostGuyInOurTerms says Jamie is old?

59:36.466 --> 59:37.186
[SPEAKER_07]: She doesn't sound old.

59:50.851 --> 59:53.073
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you have to consider this guy's probably 15 or 16 or 18.

59:53.253 --> 59:55.835
[SPEAKER_08]: Bite my butt.

59:56.876 --> 59:57.977
[SPEAKER_08]: But you're young at heart.

59:58.117 --> 59:58.918
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all that matters.

01:00:00.139 --> 01:00:03.782
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, the older I get, I realize 30 is not as old as you think.

01:00:04.503 --> 01:00:05.884
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember when I was 18.

01:00:05.964 --> 01:00:09.046
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to think that 30 was old because my mom had me really young.

01:00:09.787 --> 01:00:14.251
[SPEAKER_02]: So my mom was 30 when I was in high school.

01:00:14.871 --> 01:00:18.314
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my mom was 30 when I was in high school, and I thought 30 was old.

01:00:18.454 --> 01:00:18.675
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

01:00:19.744 --> 01:00:21.205
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I saw my friend's parents.

01:00:21.725 --> 01:00:23.767
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, is that your grandmother?

01:00:24.467 --> 01:00:29.030
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was in high school, my parents were like 60, so... I always thought that was so bizarre.

01:00:30.371 --> 01:00:31.712
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, my mom had me when she was 38.

01:00:32.673 --> 01:00:34.594
[SPEAKER_08]: So, like, my mom... My mom had me at 17.

01:00:34.754 --> 01:00:35.094
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

01:00:35.294 --> 01:00:36.875
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, wow, wow.

01:00:37.656 --> 01:00:40.538
[SPEAKER_08]: GhostGuy responded, I'm not gonna bite anyone's butt.

01:00:40.558 --> 01:00:44.240
[SPEAKER_08]: I love, I love our chat.

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:45.261
[SPEAKER_08]: That was GhostGuy.

01:00:47.822 --> 01:00:47.923
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

01:00:47.983 --> 01:00:48.363
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway...

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:53.362
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie's trying to figure out the whole bathroom situation.

01:00:53.382 --> 01:00:53.842
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, guys.

01:00:54.183 --> 01:00:56.444
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we're listening to Jamie try to get in the bathroom.

01:00:56.464 --> 01:00:57.105
[SPEAKER_08]: She's yelling at it.

01:00:58.186 --> 01:01:00.167
[SPEAKER_04]: She came, she went out there and she's like, oh, somebody's in there.

01:01:00.187 --> 01:01:02.028
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm thinking, nobody's in there, but I wasn't going to tell her.

01:01:07.152 --> 01:01:07.733
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways.

01:01:07.753 --> 01:01:08.453
[SPEAKER_07]: Just be outside.

01:01:08.913 --> 01:01:17.840
[SPEAKER_07]: So, surprise, Guitar Hero 3 on the Wii is not going to have download content initially, but at least it will have online play.

01:01:18.541 --> 01:01:18.901
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently,

01:01:20.032 --> 01:01:21.033
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:01:41.411 --> 01:01:42.091
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

01:02:10.774 --> 01:02:11.494
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stupid.

01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:12.174
[SPEAKER_07]: It really is.

01:02:12.355 --> 01:02:17.636
[SPEAKER_07]: Or just supporting... Or just supporting, you know, maybe additional storage or something.

01:02:17.976 --> 01:02:18.516
[SPEAKER_07]: Benstead?

01:02:18.616 --> 01:02:18.776
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

01:02:19.837 --> 01:02:21.437
[SPEAKER_07]: You can add memory cards to it.

01:02:21.497 --> 01:02:24.818
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for saving your save games, but not for anything else.

01:02:25.218 --> 01:02:25.659
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

01:02:25.819 --> 01:02:28.639
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just for save games and maybe virtual console titles and that.

01:02:28.679 --> 01:02:33.801
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I mean, they can't, like, design it so that when you download content that it would go into the memory card?

01:02:33.821 --> 01:02:34.261
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

01:02:34.281 --> 01:02:36.462
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't seem like it'd be that hard for them to design it that way.

01:02:36.482 --> 01:02:40.283
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they have to add a patch or something because right now it doesn't support that, so...

01:02:40.945 --> 01:02:43.567
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, why did you walk in here and then tell me to die in a boat fire?

01:02:43.647 --> 01:02:44.328
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you should.

01:02:45.028 --> 01:02:45.248
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

01:02:45.529 --> 01:02:46.309
[SPEAKER_08]: That's mean!

01:02:46.449 --> 01:02:47.410
[SPEAKER_08]: See, you're mean!

01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:53.094
[SPEAKER_08]: You were making fun of me while I was going to the... Especially if you die... That's what we do here.

01:02:53.194 --> 01:02:55.036
[SPEAKER_08]: We make fun of you when you're not here.

01:02:55.176 --> 01:02:57.397
[SPEAKER_08]: If you die in a boat fire, that's pretty pathetic.

01:02:57.898 --> 01:02:58.298
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kidding.

01:02:58.758 --> 01:03:01.961
[SPEAKER_02]: If you die in a boat fire, that would be really awesome and stupid.

01:03:02.661 --> 01:03:03.622
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to die in a boat fire.

01:03:03.642 --> 01:03:04.643
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to go on a boat now.

01:03:06.184 --> 01:03:07.545
[SPEAKER_11]: Well... Is it my turn yet?

01:03:08.099 --> 01:03:08.780
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not your turn.

01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:09.301
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my turn.

01:03:09.421 --> 01:03:16.047
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm taking my turn to tell you guys that Video Games Live is having a CD release on October 15th.

01:03:16.107 --> 01:03:18.229
[SPEAKER_08]: It's their Greatest Hits Volume 1.

01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:22.013
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, it's actually not a live show.

01:03:22.073 --> 01:03:24.976
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't go around all these venues and actually tape the songs being played live.

01:03:25.797 --> 01:03:28.019
[SPEAKER_08]: But they've actually taken some of these artists in the studio.

01:03:28.059 --> 01:03:31.703
[SPEAKER_08]: For instance, Martin Lung, who's like the piano player who plays all the songs.

01:03:31.943 --> 01:03:38.407
[SPEAKER_08]: They got him to record some of these songs, and they're going to have the CD come out for World of Warcraft, Super Mario, Halo.

01:03:38.927 --> 01:03:39.868
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be pretty awesome.

01:03:40.668 --> 01:03:41.449
[SPEAKER_08]: That is, if you're a nerd.

01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:47.613
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a rumor, but I believe that each copy is going to come with a lock of Tommy Tallarico's hair.

01:03:49.254 --> 01:03:50.134
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't confirm that.

01:03:51.475 --> 01:03:52.796
[SPEAKER_08]: From his head or his pubes.

01:03:53.816 --> 01:03:54.817
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't say.

01:03:57.218 --> 01:04:00.020
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the limited edition comes from a different place.

01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:01.621
[SPEAKER_08]: That's disgusting.

01:04:02.434 --> 01:04:05.896
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, wow, I think I made myself throw up in my stomach.

01:04:06.436 --> 01:04:07.957
[SPEAKER_02]: You threw up in your stomach?

01:04:09.418 --> 01:04:09.858
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

01:04:11.159 --> 01:04:12.900
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, how does your body even work?

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:15.121
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what happens when I'm gone for a week.

01:04:15.281 --> 01:04:17.042
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything just goes to hell.

01:04:17.983 --> 01:04:20.844
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rob throws up in his stomach.

01:04:20.884 --> 01:04:22.945
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is totally counterproductive.

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:24.746
[SPEAKER_08]: I meant to say my mouth.

01:04:25.827 --> 01:04:27.348
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't I tell you guys, like...

01:04:28.032 --> 01:04:30.334
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be like regurgitative eating.

01:04:30.814 --> 01:04:31.715
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be like a mother bird.

01:04:31.735 --> 01:04:32.176
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that eating?

01:04:32.216 --> 01:04:32.756
[SPEAKER_08]: When you eat.

01:04:33.056 --> 01:04:34.177
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, Rob, shut up.

01:04:34.217 --> 01:04:35.338
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be like a mother bird.

01:04:35.438 --> 01:04:39.061
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you never heard the expression, you just made me throw up in my mouth a little bit?

01:04:39.302 --> 01:04:39.742
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

01:04:39.782 --> 01:04:40.963
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I was going for.

01:04:41.083 --> 01:04:42.024
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's not what you said.

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:43.485
[SPEAKER_08]: For some reason I said stomach.

01:04:43.625 --> 01:04:44.366
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why.

01:04:44.486 --> 01:04:47.248
[SPEAKER_08]: I told you guys at the top of the show, I'm broken tonight.

01:04:48.129 --> 01:04:49.290
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, poor baby.

01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:51.152
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get Rob some duct tape.

01:04:51.172 --> 01:04:52.533
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't even had anything to drink.

01:04:53.133 --> 01:04:53.714
[SPEAKER_08]: What's wrong with me?

01:04:54.196 --> 01:05:00.880
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to come last week and bring you my really expensive booze from Greece and it didn't happen.

01:05:01.721 --> 01:05:05.423
[SPEAKER_08]: We definitely need to take a break pretty soon because the show is already broken as it is.

01:05:05.523 --> 01:05:17.730
[SPEAKER_08]: But we've got one more thing for you guys before we go to a break and that is the one and only website of the week as presented by DarkSakura who surfs the internet up and down and all around every week to find a website she likes to share with all of you.

01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:22.633
[SPEAKER_08]: Miss DarkSakura, where should the kids be pointing their web browsers to this week?

01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:26.050
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere else.

01:05:27.511 --> 01:05:30.993
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the website of the week is BBC Radio 1 homepage, actually.

01:05:31.973 --> 01:05:36.115
[SPEAKER_02]: I, a lot of times, really hate the crap that's on the radio over here.

01:05:36.596 --> 01:05:42.719
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will go, you know, turn on the BBC Radio 1 and listen to it.

01:05:42.779 --> 01:05:43.159
[SPEAKER_02]: I also...

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:49.523
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times we'll record the interviews that go off of there and some of the music specials.

01:05:50.163 --> 01:05:54.265
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually get a lot of good information off there too.

01:05:54.325 --> 01:05:55.786
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other interviews posted.

01:05:55.886 --> 01:05:57.226
[SPEAKER_02]: There's your singles charts.

01:05:58.287 --> 01:06:01.548
[SPEAKER_02]: You even get in some of the indie stuff that comes through.

01:06:01.568 --> 01:06:02.429
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's pretty cool.

01:06:02.629 --> 01:06:07.011
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of different variety of music than what we're used to over here.

01:06:07.451 --> 01:06:08.252
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it's the same.

01:06:08.272 --> 01:06:08.732
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got your

01:06:09.557 --> 01:06:11.038
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiger Claw says BBC Radio 1 is awesome.

01:06:11.058 --> 01:06:12.179
[SPEAKER_02]: The essential mix is the best show.

01:06:35.484 --> 01:06:41.428
[SPEAKER_02]: I like listening to... I can't think of her name, but she's one of the DJs on there.

01:06:41.568 --> 01:06:43.650
[SPEAKER_02]: She really does some good interviews.

01:06:43.730 --> 01:06:44.890
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

01:06:46.191 --> 01:06:46.492
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.

01:06:46.872 --> 01:06:48.953
[SPEAKER_08]: Do they still play the Spice Girls on BBC Radio 1?

01:06:49.073 --> 01:06:49.814
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:06:50.174 --> 01:06:51.595
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I just block that out.

01:06:53.156 --> 01:06:54.077
[SPEAKER_08]: I miss the Spice Girls.

01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:55.918
[SPEAKER_02]: The Shice Girls?

01:06:56.058 --> 01:06:58.840
[SPEAKER_08]: Eddie, you want to go see the reunion tour with me in San Jose?

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.241
[SPEAKER_08]: I so want to go, like so bad.

01:07:00.781 --> 01:07:01.162
[SPEAKER_08]: Me too.

01:07:01.182 --> 01:07:03.803
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember?

01:07:04.224 --> 01:07:04.564
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember?

01:07:04.978 --> 01:07:05.699
[SPEAKER_04]: Why am I out here?

01:07:07.159 --> 01:07:14.044
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no wait, the short, no, the very short version is that Irene and I, it was like 3 in the morning, we're playing Spice World, I don't know if you guys remember that game from PS1.

01:07:14.384 --> 01:07:15.324
[SPEAKER_04]: That game was awful!

01:07:15.344 --> 01:07:17.746
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was awesome, awful, awful, awesome.

01:07:18.106 --> 01:07:23.609
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, we were laughing so hard, and it's like 3 in the morning, so of course Rob comes out wagging his finger, why am I out here?

01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:26.291
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we were being bad and Rob was going to spank us, I don't know.

01:07:28.382 --> 01:07:29.483
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, never mind.

01:07:29.503 --> 01:07:33.825
[SPEAKER_08]: There's another part to this story, but I can't say it, even though the show's already got an explicit tag.

01:07:34.245 --> 01:07:39.769
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just say they were interrupting something from all their laughing.

01:07:42.130 --> 01:07:42.810
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was very upset.

01:07:46.893 --> 01:07:51.996
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we need to take a break on the show now, because I don't actually know how much video game content was in tonight's program.

01:07:52.396 --> 01:07:57.599
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will go, and the people responsible for screwing up tonight's program will be sacked.

01:07:58.457 --> 01:08:02.359
[SPEAKER_02]: And those responsible for the sacking would like it to be known that they too have just been sacked.

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:05.400
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so everybody will be sacked during our break.

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:09.781
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to come back with a stupendous Part B. It'll be fancy and nice.

01:08:09.801 --> 01:08:12.202
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing it in a completely different manner and at great expense.

01:08:13.142 --> 01:08:17.344
[SPEAKER_08]: Because honestly, guys, there's only one way we could probably fuck up this show even more.

01:08:17.784 --> 01:08:19.025
[SPEAKER_02]: That's by letting Rob keep talking.

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:20.765
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that would be one.

01:08:21.145 --> 01:08:23.846
[SPEAKER_08]: But the other would be is that tonight, and by the way, fuck you.

01:08:25.507 --> 01:08:27.968
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight's Part B. Do not want.

01:08:30.703 --> 01:08:31.724
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:08:48.543 --> 01:08:49.984
[SPEAKER_02]: That means I have to sound really apathetic.

01:08:50.004 --> 01:08:51.645
[SPEAKER_08]: May we go to break time now?

01:08:52.325 --> 01:08:57.307
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice a week.
