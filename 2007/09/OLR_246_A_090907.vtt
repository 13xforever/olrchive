Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
We're your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loco here

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, September 9th, 2007, Layers Hot Coffee Mode is found, but it's not what you think.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
HD DVD gets a price cut in Europe, and a third-party company has something to say about PlayStation's marketing.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer lifestyle, and gamer culture.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
That'll teach me to say so damn much during the introduction.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
That voice you hear taunting behind me is the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Hi. And my name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as well, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Hello. How you doing, Jamie? How you doing tonight?

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I have a soda. You has a soda?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
I has a soda. Is it delicious?

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Not really. Not really? You're very quiet tonight. You seem kind of timid. Is everything okay?

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
I just ate. You just ate, so you're very well satiated?

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
I was getting into Uber bitch mode because I didn't eat, and then I ate, and I ate too much.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Now I should say something before we get to the rest of the show is that we are taking new pictures tonight,

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
which I'm hoping you guys will see the results of in our album.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I can't talk tonight. What the hell's wrong with me?

01:31.000 --> 01:38.000
In our album artwork that you'll be seeing for episode 250 at least a little later on, and Jamie got to eat.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
Weren't you eating a Pikachu? Or was that? No, you were squishing a Pikachu, pretending to eat a Pikachu.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
I ate my cell phone.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
You ate your cell phone. Was it delicious?

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Not really. It tasted like Samsung.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
Wonderful. Anyhow, also joining us tonight, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
I've already said hello, but yes. Hello.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Hi again. How are you?

02:00.000 --> 02:00.000
I'm doing fine.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
Awesome. Also say hello to our chat room, which is available at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
You can also say hello to Gay Eddie, who's here tonight, joining us on the show.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah, that'd be Casper the Gay, thank you very much. You just always call me Gay Eddie, because you're a douche.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
I don't know what else to call you. I'm sorry.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
We're going to start off with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week?

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
We'll come back to you and get you filled in a little more for the folks that may not know you,

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
because you haven't been on the show in a long time.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Has it really been six months? You could have had a baby since the last time.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Maybe you had a baby, and we'll find that out.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
We'll start with Dark Sakura. How was your gaming week? Let's talk about video games.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
Lots of pinball. We sold the Whodunnit, finally.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Oh, I liked Whodunnit.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Yeah, but we can get a much better one than the one that we had.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
We're babysitting some machines. We're babysitting Back to the Future, which, Back to the Future sucks,

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
because Michael J. Fox wouldn't let his likeness be used in the game,

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
so it has somebody who completely doesn't look like him.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
What a bastard.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Or it's either him or his agent or something.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
And then we got a time machine, which is one of my favorite older pins,

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
and I played a whole crap ton of World Cup Soccer 94, which is my favorite pinball ever,

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
and some Final Fantasy VI Advance.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Good times.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
And no World of Warcraft.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Aw, sadness. That's all right. I haven't been playing World of Warcraft either,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
and I'll tell you why in a little bit. Let's go over to the one and only Loki.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Hello.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
I played this week Project Gotham Racing 3 Land,

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
which is weird, though, because we have five 360s,

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
but one of them does not want to land.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
I don't know why. It will land other games, but it just doesn't like Project Gotham Racing 3.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
I don't know.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
So we played four players with that.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
Luckily, that day there was someone missing, so it worked out.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Then Saints Row multiplayer, also via System Link.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
I swear, you know, there's just not enough support for System Link.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
It's sad.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
But hopefully we'll get live soon at work and then be able to play anything.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Let's see, other things I played.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Bioshock, more of that.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
I'm actually a little bit more into it now.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
I forget where the hell I'm at, but it's still been very good,

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
so definitely looking forward to playing more of that game.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
And then, let's see, I tried a little bit more stuff on the 360.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
I actually downloaded the full version of Worms, and well, it's Worms,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
so I can't really say too much on that.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Let's see, what else did I try out?

04:37.000 --> 04:45.000
Also on the PSP, I found someone had dumped a version of Sega Rally on there that's not out yet,

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
but it's actually very awesome.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Sega Rally Revo, I know it's going to be on most other systems.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
I think they just drop in the Revo part for the PSP version though,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
but it's cool. It's very awesome.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
If you've played Sega Rally in the arcades, it's exactly like that.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
I mean, it looks good too, so I really recommend that one.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
And, oh! I almost forgot.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
On 360, play Flatout Ultimate Carnage.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Fucking love this game.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
This game right now, I think, best racing game of the year.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Hands down.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
That's a pretty hefty title.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
It's fucking fun. It's got, you know, Flatout used to love the game first off,

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
because you can crash into things.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Now, the first game really pissed me off,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
because when you'd crash into objects on the track,

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
you would kind of get stuck on them, and that kind of sucked.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
But, they went back, fixed all that shit.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Now there's like 6,000 things on the track to crash into,

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
and you see all of them, you know, all strewn about on the track.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Then they have like this Ultimate Carnage mode,

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
which is basically like the takedown mode in Burnout,

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
and it's really fun.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
And then they've also got Destruction Derby,

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
and of course the Ragdoll Olympics.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Highly recommend this game when it comes out in October.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
I'm definitely picking it up.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
As far as arcade racers, it's definitely the best one this year.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
I'm not sure if people would agree as far as sim racers.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
I'm sure Project Gotham Racing 4 will take that.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
But as far as arcade racers go,

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
if you want something that's pretty fun,

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
definitely check out Burnout, not Burnout, Flatout, Ultimate Carnage.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
I was going to say, isn't this the game that I seem to recall reading

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
on one of the big blogs out there,

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
and I'm sorry, I forget which one,

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
but they have like a side-by-side comparison of the box art

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
from Flatout to Burnout, and it's like the same fucking box,

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
but just with a different title?

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Basically, but, you know, Flatout is a completely different game.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
I mean, their thing is, you know,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
the fact that you can crash into a bunch of different objects on the course.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
You know, Burnout doesn't really have that.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
It's mainly just crashing into the cars and exploding and stuff like that.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
So it's a different type of game,

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
but I really recommend checking it out.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
It's pretty awesome.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
I played the demo for a good half an hour at least,

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
and probably will play it a little bit more until it comes out.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
Then, of course, I also tried out Worms 2,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Open Warfare on the PSP.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Once again, that's also Worms,

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
and, you know, I don't know why the hell I'm playing these Worms games.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
It's probably because I can get them for free.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Because you're a whore for worms.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Yeah, it's a fun game.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
It's just, you know, it's a fun game to play with other people.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
It's kind of like a board game, almost.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
You need other people to make it fun,

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
because the computer sucks.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Only on this show would saying,

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
you're a whore for worms actually make sense.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Like, could you imagine if I walked up to,

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
like, just a random person on the street,

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
you're a whore for worms!

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
You're a worm whore!

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Unless they liked worms.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Or were a fisherman.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Do you think there is such a thing as, like, worm fetish?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
That's really gross.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Probably. There's sick people in the world.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
There's fish fetish for everything.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
That's what they say.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Seriously?

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Do we have anybody in the chatroom with a worm fetish?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Everybody in the chatroom is talking about their gaming weeks.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
I don't care what you play in your gaming weeks.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
We haven't asked any of you.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
I know.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Oh, no, dude.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
I'm trying to see if there's any other stuff that catches my eye in chat.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
I like DJ Jenai, because he's got, like, old school stuff in his gaming week,

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
like Mighty Bomb Jack and Mappy.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
That's pretty old, right?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Hey, 1942 in Lode Runner.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
But in Kaboom, on this, uh, the Activision's hit Remix, which sucks.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Kaboom is awesome.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Wait, you didn't like the Remix?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
We were talking about Kunio games earlier.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
No, I just didn't like the, Activision hits Remix on the PSP.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
It's just, I don't know.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Wait, but isn't that the only system they put it out on, is the Remix ones?

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Like, all the souped up titles?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Well, they weren't really souped up.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
These were just the standard games.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Oh.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
This is the classic one that's going to be redone, you know, with the ones that they had in, like, Xbox Live Arcade.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
This is just the old one.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
It was a collection of, like, 70-some Activision titles, you know, like Kaboom, Pitfall, Pitfall 2, etc.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Oh, okay.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Which is okay.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
If you really want a collection of those old games, then great.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Pick that up.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
I'm sure it's dirt cheap by now.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
I don't know.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
It's just not for me.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
I'm not, I don't want to play it on that console.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Hey, I was playing Worms, and I was getting achievements on that.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
What was I playing?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
There was something else I was playing.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Oh, I played Mutant Storm Reloaded.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
I played that, and I was getting some more achievements on that as well.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Oh, actually, no.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
I was looking through my arcade games.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
I'm like, I own, like, 40 arcade games, and I don't have the high scores on any of them among my friends.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
I'm like, which one can I possibly get the high score on?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
And I was like, okay.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
I don't know.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
I don't know.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
I don't have the high score on.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
And I tried on Mutant Storm Reloaded, and I just didn't have enough time to dedicate to it.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
How many games am I whipping your ass on?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
I don't know.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
I don't play live arcade games that much, so probably a lot.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Just curious.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
All finished?

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
I'm all finished.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Oh, Call of Duty 4 multiplayer, the beta.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Oh.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
It's pretty awesome.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Are you in it legally?

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
I am in it legally.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Call of Duty actually put me in the first wave.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Are you allowed to talk about it?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Fuck if I know.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Okay, let me put it this way.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
It's Call of Duty.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
I mean, shit, they haven't really changed much since, you know, 2.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
And it's no modern day stuff.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
It looks awesome.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
That's it.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
I mean, if you want me to describe it for you, go play Call of Duty 3, but just imagine it's futuristic.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Or modern day.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
I mean, it's basically the same damn thing.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
It's good.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
People are loving this game.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
You know, it ran really smooth.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Didn't have any lag issues.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Just, it looks awesome, and I kind of figured it would.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
So, you know, I will definitely be picking it up when it comes out, but just so you know, it looks good.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
All right.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
Well, we're going to go over to Casper, the gay, and find out about his gaming week and what kind of stuff he's been playing.

10:39.000 --> 10:46.000
I've just been doing the virtual console thing, just playing the heck out of Super Metroid, which is still one of the best games ever.

10:46.000 --> 10:53.000
So, I'm not very far, because it's actually the first time I've ever played this game, because I think it was in a coma in the 90s when it came out.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
So, I'm like, oh my God, this is like my first time playing, and it's awesome.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
So, you know, I've got all the cool power-ups, and it's awesome.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
And then Neotopia, or whatever it's called, which is that Zelda clone for TurboGrafx.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Neotopia is great.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
I've got Neotopia and Neotopia 2.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Oh, do you have Neotopia 2?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
I have TurboGrafx.

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
Okay, okay. The thing about it is, it's a Zelda clone. If you like Zelda games, you'll like it for that old-school gameplay.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
But there's some reasons why Zelda was way more popular.

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
For instance, if you bomb a cave or you bomb a wall in a dungeon, you have to re-bomb it the next time you go back in, which is a real pain in the ass.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
That's what they get for being HuCard games.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
Yeah, it's horrible. And then if you go into the cave or something, you automatically have to start talking to the person.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
You have no choice. Or if somebody's in a dungeon in a room, every time you pass through that room, you start talking to them again.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
I'm like, ugh! But it's still fun. It's good stuff.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Again, HuCard games.

11:44.000 --> 11:51.000
It's good times, though. I haven't played any new stuff, so I want to play Metroid, the new one, so that looks pretty awesome.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
Kick them off the TV watching Battlestar reruns and go play Metroid. It's awesome.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
Alright. Well, I've got to talk about my gaming week.

12:01.000 --> 12:08.000
Oh, hell. I don't know if I really want to say anything about my gaming week. I'd better brace myself.

12:09.000 --> 12:16.000
This week, I played Final Fantasy XI of a lot this week.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Oh, hi, Shane. How are you?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Hello. I'm good.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
I've been playing Final Fantasy XI. I went back.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
What's the old saying, Shane? Final Fantasy XI is like an abusive husband?

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
Yeah. You just keep going back to them, despite the fact that they abuse you and beat you up.

12:34.000 --> 12:41.000
Yeah, I went back. But why, Shane, did we end up going back to Final Fantasy XI, out of curiosity?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
There's a camera on me.

12:44.000 --> 12:51.000
Because I wanted to play something, and I had codes that would make it so I could play for a month for free, so I was like, I'm going to do that.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
And then you got a free month on WoW, and you're like, okay, I'll come play Final Fantasy XI.

12:55.000 --> 13:01.000
And then we got two of our friends to play, too. So we're all just going back. We're migrating back.

13:02.000 --> 13:08.000
The thing about it is that they've changed a lot since I've been gone, and I was kind of curious what all has changed.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
And it does seem like they have fixed a lot of things that were pissing me off before, such as they got rid of a lot of the gold sellers.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
The economy seems to be a lot better than it was before. Seems like it's stabilized.

13:19.000 --> 13:19.000
The economy changed?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Yeah, seriously, the economy changes. It happens in a lot of MMOs.

13:22.000 --> 13:28.000
But here's the most hilarious part, and old-school OLR listeners will really get a kick out of this.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
You know what server we're playing on?

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Faerie.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
The Faerie server!

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
We're playing on the Faerie server!

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
And we're pretending we're noobs.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
You have to go back to Episode 80 to get these jokes when I was first getting into Final Fantasy XI.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
But yes, we're playing on the Faerie server.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
For what reason?

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
What was it?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
I don't remember. It was something to do with live journal trauma or something.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
You have to go back.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
It's really fun, though.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I'm actually having a really good time playing this time.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
So am I. I keep leveling everything I can.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
But I'm wondering if it's one of those things where when I have to start partying in the dunes, if it's going to wear off real quick.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
We don't know what the dunes are. Give me my drink, Eddie!

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
This is great radio. What?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
He's trying to steal my drink.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
We don't know what the dunes are yet. Remember, we're just low levels.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
We'll be there soon.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
We've never played before.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
I'm looking in the chat room to see what people are saying.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Ghostguy says Final Fantasy XI equals not so good.

14:24.000 --> 14:24.000
Cry.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Well, that person's name that you just read equals not so good.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
SSJ100Matt says, why isn't Jamie on top of Rob about this?

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Well, Shane took her mic, for one.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Well, I needed talking to something.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
I would be curious what Jamie's thoughts are on all of this.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
I'm going to go ask her. I'll start by.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
I don't care.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Oh, I thought you were going to call me an addict or yell at me or something.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
No.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
The play is up to you.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Oh, I like this. This is the kinder, gentler Jamie than we had a few episodes ago.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
No, this is the indifferent, apathetic Jamie.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Oh, I see. This is the meh Jamie.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Yeah.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
The meh. What do you think about that, Jamie?

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Meh.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
I didn't just play Final Fantasy XI, though.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Because I swear I'm going to limit my time on it this time around.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
I'll let you guys know how long I actually stick with it.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
But I also was playing some more Blue Dragon and made some more progress on that.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
I'm enjoying Blue Dragon.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
I realize the critics didn't exactly give it the best scores in the world,

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
but I'm actually having a good time with it.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
And then some stuff on Xbox Live Arcade. Hello, Fatal Fury Special.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
I had to give that a go.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
It's the same game, basically, from the Neo Geo.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
They didn't really change anything, but that's okay,

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
because Fatal Fury is an awesome game.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
But they did add Xbox Live support and achievements.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
For five bucks, I actually think it's one of the better fighting game deals on Xbox Live right now.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
I think it's a better value than the $10 Street Fighter II that's up there now,

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
although I am still looking forward to the Street Fighter II HD remix.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Street Fighter is $10?

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Street Fighter is $10, believe it or not.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
I thought that Virtual Console games were expensive.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Well, Virtual Console games are expensive.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
I mean, like $5 for Mario Brothers.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Excuse me, not even Super Mario Brothers.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Or $5 for Metroid. Hello.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
You should see the PlayStation Network game prices.

16:00.000 --> 16:07.000
Granted, they're more full games, but we're talking like $40, $20.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
I want to say one other thing I've noticed about Final Fantasy XI

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
is that it seems like there's a lot less OMGWTF-type kids on there now,

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
and I'm noticing there's a lot of older people that are getting into Final Fantasy XI.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
A lot of stay-at-home moms seem to be playing the game. It's interesting.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
So what do you think I should see about getting back in?

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Are you a stay-at-home mom?

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Shut the heck up. Are you actually thinking about coming back?

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
Well, I'd play it about as much as I'd play World of Warcraft.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Shane, you gotta hear this!

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Somebody go, Shane!

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
Well, this is like news-breaking stories here. I'm sure the chat room is like OMG.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
I have to find my controller again, though.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Shane! I'm running!

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
But I haven't installed all that square crap off my computer.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Run faster!

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
I don't know where my discs are either.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
If you want, you have to play like you've never played before, though.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
That's okay. I only got to, what, level 15?

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
There you go. You'll forget everything.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
She's thinking about it. Oh, this is exciting news.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
I'm probably actually going to quit World of Warcraft, too.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
I'm just going to quit MMOs.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
I haven't quit World of Warcraft. I should say that.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
It's just that I have a free month because I got somebody else to play through the rewards room,

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
so this is my month where I'm going to decide which one I'm going to stick with, if any,

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
because honestly, when I play MMOs...

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
You should totally play World of Warcraft. Bye!

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
It cuts into my console times, so we'll see.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I'm going to try to play through Super Metroid.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Oh, Super Metroid. Good stuff.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
You know, I've been looking for a video capture card for the Mac,

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
so we can do Operator 11 stuff with the Super Metroid.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
We can do our live playthrough and have the video feed actually on it.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
You actually have to do it this week.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
I know. We totally will. I just need to get the card.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
I haven't been doing my show on Tuesday, so we should do that instead of my show.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
We'll figure something out.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Speaking of Operator 11, let's go into housekeeping tonight.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Yeah.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
I want to remind everybody out there, we do have our video feeds now on Operator 11.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
I don't think it's the most interesting thing in the world to just kind of sit here and watch us do the show,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
but I'm hoping as time goes on, we'll think of more ways to integrate the video,

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
but what I do want to point you guys to is that we're looking at putting other videos on Operator 11,

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
like us playing new games as they come out.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Like Jamie said, we're going to play through Super Metroid and a bunch of other stuff,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
so keep an eye out on our page on operator11.com.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
I'm not sure exactly how to get to our profile,

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
but I can tell you our username is orangelanerator. That was a really bad plug, huh?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
I don't really know how you get there.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Best. Plug. Ever.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Just find it.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
All right, so there you go.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Let's see, I don't really have a whole lot of other housekeeping.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
I already talked about that we have new pictures coming.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
I ate too much pizza.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm actually hungry.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Eddie, you want to make another round to talk about?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Do you want my breadsticks?

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Seriously, can I have some breadsticks?

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Sure.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
And we're going to get into tonight's gaming news.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Hopefully I'm not first.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Hey, Rob's first!

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
No, I'm kidding.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
So, to start things off, let's talk about pathetic stuff,

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
including how pathetic Lair was.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Well, personally, I haven't played it,

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
so I don't know if it's pathetic, but based on people's reviews of it,

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
for example, IGN gave it a 4.9,

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
I would say it's pretty pathetic,

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
and I guess, you know, there are some control issues and stuff like that.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Well, to, I guess, help save face,

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Sony has figured, you know what,

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
the reason why our game is getting bad scores

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
is because reviewers just don't know how to review our game.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Yeah, it's never a good argument.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
So, what they did was they sent out reviewers guides for Lair.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
They basically sent IGN a guide of how to review their game,

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
because they figure, oh, you're stupid and you don't know how to play our game.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
Yeah, that really makes you look cool.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
So, apparently, six of the 21 pages of the guide

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
are devoted to the game's controls,

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
and I guess it has, you know, like a fact or something in it.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
That's so retarded.

20:04.000 --> 20:11.000
Ghostguy in our chat room says Lair is lame.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I don't know, I will withhold judgment until I have a chance to play it.

20:15.000 --> 20:15.000
It looked good, though.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
It looked like the game that could save the PlayStation 3

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
from all this, you know, that people are saying at it.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
So, what went wrong, Loki?

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
It just kind of sucked.

20:28.000 --> 20:28.000
I don't know.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
I think one of the things was, first off,

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
you had to use the motion controls.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
It wasn't just, you know, you can turn them off or it's optional.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
You had to use them.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
They were kind of floaty.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
There was, I guess, some lag between certain things,

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
and I don't know, it's just a lot harder than people thought.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
So...

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
Mr. DeBucket in our chat room at chat.orangestonesradio.com says

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
Lair is better on PSP via remote play.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
You know, gimmick. That's all I'm saying.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Well, you know, it's interesting that that gets brought up

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
because it makes me think about the whole DS Wii thing.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Should we have seen something with that by now?

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Oh, I guess we have the Pokemon game, huh?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I guess we do have a little bit of connectivity, but nothing to this extent.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
That's cool, but here's the thing, though.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
I mean, I don't want to get into other stories or anything,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
but I'm just saying, you know, the remote play isn't like,

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
it's not like the DS thing with the Wii,

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
where, you know, that's actually being used as a controller,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
and it actually has an interface on there and menus and stuff.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
It's different than what's on the screen.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
It's actually, you know, kind of an accessory to the game.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
Whereas remote play is, look, I can play this from, you know,

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Starbucks down the street.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I'm playing my PlayStation 3 on my PSP.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
I mean, it doesn't work completely.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Even that's kind of broken.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
I mean, sure, you can do it, but, you know,

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
it's just like, sure, you can emulate PlayStation 1 games on there,

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
but not perfectly, so I don't know.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
It is a gimmick.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
I can understand watching the movies, you know,

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
maybe streaming that stuff when you're on the go,

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
you know, waiting in the airport and you have free Wi-Fi

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
or something like that, but playing Lair on the go,

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
I mean, if you really want to play Lair on your PSP,

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
make a version of Lair for your PSP.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Alright, let me go ahead and say this,

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
because, you know, I know Loki's dying for me to get to this,

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
so he can go off even more than he already is,

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
but of course, you know, as you guys know,

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Lair has that connectivity between the PSP and the PlayStation 3,

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
and a Sony technical insider has been spotted saying,

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
quote, it's a nice start.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Over time, I'm sure we'll have more advanced features.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
So is this possibly just the beginning of more to come for the console?

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Well, remember when they were shown off the console

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
and they had the Formula One racing game

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
and they were like, look, you can use your PSP as a rear view mirror.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Why? Why would you do that?

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Where are you going to put it?

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
You're just going to set it, stand next to you or something.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Just put it in your damn, you know,

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
they have rear view mirrors on your car model in the game.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Why would you need to have it on a separate screen?

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
It's just a gimmick. Fucking gimmick is what it is.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
You know, and granted, the DS connectivity with the Wii,

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
you know, very brief, you know, all one game of it,

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
is very gimmicky as well because you don't really need it to play.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
But, you know, at least it is something in additional to the game.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
It's not like, oh look, you can sort of control the game with this.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
There were some other, when they were doing the GameCube too,

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
there was some cooler like connectivity with the Game Boy Advance

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
because like when you were playing, I think it was one of the Metal Gear games,

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
something like that, it was like your sonar

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
and it was like having your own cool like device but in the game.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
So it was a gimmick but it was like practical too, so.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Oh, no, here's the thing, the reason why they did that

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
is so that you can make the racing game more like real life.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
And by the way, Mr. DeBucket in chat wants to point out,

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
it was a tech demo, you dumbass, it wasn't even in the game.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
I know, that's what I'm saying, it was the tech demos

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
when they were first showing the PlayStation 3 on.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
It makes it more like real life because what you do

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
is you get a woman to sit next to you while you drive.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Where's something I can throw at Rob right now?

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
I'm not even finished, and you have the PSP

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
and the woman's watching and she's nagging about everything you're doing wrong.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Where's something I can throw at Rob? Give me one of your Pikachus.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Throw one of these breadsticks, these things will knock me out.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
They're like rock solid.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
I think the Operator 11 people heard me banging it against the wall earlier.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
These things are tough.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Alright, anyway, that's all I have to say.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
It's okay because Rob drives like Grandma.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
See? You're criticizing my driving.

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
Now, Rob, the game they even admitted when they were showing off the connectivity,

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
yeah, you can use it to control your dragon.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Oh, by the way, you can't land your dragon or anything

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
because there's no additional L2 buttons or R2 and stuff like that,

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
so some of the controls are broken.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
Then why even put some half-assed control system in there

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
that you can play this thing remotely? It's stupid.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
It's just like those people that use their media center extender

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
to view the internet on their 360.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
It's stupid. It's gimmicky.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
You don't need to do that.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Well, if you'd like to comment on Loki's rants,

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
we always welcome your emails.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and of course our chat room.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Send them directly to Loki.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Send them to him. I don't need them.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
And while you're at it, sign him up for lots of Nigerian bank lotteries.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
I already get enough spam.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
And Loki's definitely interested in anything you have on Viagra or Syalis.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
I will forward all my email to you, Rob.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
He also wants bigger breasts.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
All right, I'm done. That's all I wanted to say about the connectivity.

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
Well, you know our favorite crayon eater was going around in his days at Sony

25:59.000 --> 26:05.000
saying that the PS3 was a computer and a multimedia whatever.

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
Kazurai, who is now the man again, said, and I'm going to quote,

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
I'd like to clearly say the PS3 is a game machine.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
It's nothing more than that.

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
No, it is not. In fact, all their commercials say computer entertainment system.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
It's a fucking computer.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
No, it is not. It's the Sony PlayStation.

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
I mean, it is a fucking computer. You've been saying computer.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Just because your fucking computer does not sell,

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
does not mean that you have to start calling it a game machine now.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
It's a fucking computer. Stick with it.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Who turned Loki to 11 tonight? That's what I want to know.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Why don't you just make 10 louder?

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
No, he's too loud. Here's my thing.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
This is why I think this is a newsworthy quote.

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
Because of the fact that I remember them selling the PlayStation 3 as a computer.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
And to some extent, I think this is where Sony excels best.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
Like, what makes the PSP better than a DS to some people?

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Now again, you can argue all you want until you're blue in the face about the games,

27:08.000 --> 27:13.000
but some people prefer the PSP because you can surf the internet on it as built in.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
You can listen to MP3s, help people download our show.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
A lot of people download this podcast and listen to it on it.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
You can carry the pictures with you anywhere you go,

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
and pretty soon they're going to have the video out and you can watch the movies.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
Sony actually does this pretty well at being more than just a game system.

27:29.000 --> 27:35.000
And that's kind of what makes the PlayStation 3 a little bit appealing as well.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
What's the one thing that has people more excited than anything about PlayStation 3?

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
Home. Is home a game? No, it's kind of something outside the box.

27:45.000 --> 27:50.000
So for them to go out and say a quote like this is a little bit like, huh?

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
But you're like the worst at being a game machine.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
You do everything else really good. I don't know.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Guess what? People didn't care that you can load Linux on it.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
That's why it's now a game system and not a fucking computer.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
Well, okay, fine then. $600 is too much for a game system.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
$600 was cheap for a computer, too much for a game system.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
So now it's too much for a game system.

28:13.000 --> 28:20.000
All right, let's see. Son of Dad says PlayStation 3 right now is a cheap Blu-ray player, no more, no less.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
There might be some Sony fans that disagree, but I don't know.

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
I mean, I still have yet to buy a PlayStation 3 because I have to admit I feel kind of similar. Sorry.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
There's nothing out there to play.

28:31.000 --> 28:36.000
Even, I mean, Ratchet and Clank Future, that looks pretty good and Resistance was good.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
I'm sure when Final Fantasy 13 comes out, I'll be like,

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
Hail, Sony! Welcome into my house! Hello, PlayStation 3! I love you!

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
Well, then you'll have a lot of time to save up money, you know, when it comes out spring 2009.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Is that the current release they're saying?

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
No, I'm just guessing because, you know, that's shit.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
I mean, because it'll come out in Japan, you know, probably Christmas next year or something,

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
and then we'll see it maybe spring or summer of 2009.

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
But don't worry, don't worry. Good games are coming to the PlayStation 3 someday.

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
All right. Thank you, Jamie, for the quote.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
It certainly livened up our show a little bit tonight.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
Nah.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Except for you.

29:17.000 --> 29:27.000
Anyway, so guess what? You can't talk about PSP Homebrew on the official Sony forums.

29:27.000 --> 29:36.000
Wow! Surprise! You know, you can't talk about cracking their system on their own forums.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
How dare they do that?

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
I'm more concerned with the fact that it took them this long to ban that chat.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
What?

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
Well, you know, the PSP is only a game system. You shouldn't be doing everything.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
Shut up and read the story!

29:52.000 --> 30:01.000
So, yeah, if you talk about Homebrew, you will be banned from Sony's official chat room or forum.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
And guess what?

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
We ban you!

30:06.000 --> 30:14.000
Since we're on the topic of Homebrew, it should not be a surprise that with the PlayStation Slim coming out,

30:14.000 --> 30:24.000
the PlayStation Portable Slim, that they've already cracked, or not really cracked, but dumped the 3.6 firmware that is included with it.

30:25.000 --> 30:30.000
So you know what that means. First they dump it, then they crack it, and then you run your Homebrew.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
So it's only a matter of time before I will be picking up a PSP Slim.

30:35.000 --> 30:43.000
You know, I know I can say this, and it won't go anywhere, so nobody tell him, but I think I know what I'm going to get William for.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
I'm totally serious here. I think I know what I'm going to get William for his birthday. I'm going to get him a PSP Slim.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
Because funny enough, William is a huge Sony fanboy.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
And I don't know what it is. He doesn't even play a whole lot of video games, but every time we go into Best Buy,

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
we'll be looking at Motorstorm or whatever, and he's always like,

30:59.000 --> 31:04.000
don't you want a PlayStation 3? Look at it. It's so beautiful. Why don't you have a PlayStation 3 in your house? You ever heard of the game system?

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Why don't you get a PlayStation 3? I'm like, are you going to buy me one? And he's like, no.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
But I think he really wants a PSP, so I'm going to get him one, because he thinks they're cool.

31:13.000 --> 31:18.000
I know, but I'm going to get him the Slim, because they're new, and then I can go, look, it's a new toy too, and I think he'll get a kick out of that.

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
So Sony fanboys who are pissed off at the show right now because we're, you know, knocking Sony,

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
I just thought I'd let you know they are still getting some of our money.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Because, you know, I do think the PSP is pretty awesome now.

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
It was a slow start, but then again, the DS had a slow start too, so what can you say?

31:35.000 --> 31:43.000
Well, anyhow, one thing, of course, that you can play on those PSPs is Lair, which goes back and forth, you know, with a little remote connectivity.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
But yes, we have one more Lair story for you guys.

31:47.000 --> 31:55.000
There's a brand new hot coffee mode that's been discovered inside Lair. Yes, there's a hot coffee mode, except it's not really what you think.

31:55.000 --> 32:06.000
If you actually watch the video of the hot coffee mode, it's actually just something you unlock where somebody brews, we're watching it here in the studio, so you can hear it on the TV.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Somebody just brews a pot of hot coffee.

32:10.000 --> 32:17.000
All you have to do is enter in this big, long string at the cheat menu, and you'll be welcomed with this video of somebody making hot coffee.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
That's the best joke ever.

32:20.000 --> 32:26.000
It's kind of stupid, but like it's stupid funny. Like a Jim Carrey movie, it's stupid funny.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
That's great.

32:29.000 --> 32:37.000
By the way, that code that you can enter in, 686-F7-420-636-F66666565.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
If you missed any part of this show and need a transcription, get out a pen next time.

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
And guess what, those also happen to be the reviews that this game got as well.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
Good job, Loki.

32:51.000 --> 33:03.000
As I was reminded in the chat room, though, the PSP has already cracked the firmware, and they're going to be releasing a...

33:04.000 --> 33:10.000
I guess Team M33 is going to be releasing a CFW 3.6 firmware for it.

33:10.000 --> 33:16.000
That's one of the better jokes we've had in a while on this program. Good job, Loki.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
Yes, chat room, now you two get to beat that one into the ground.

33:21.000 --> 33:26.000
So, some news for our UK listeners. Sega's got some dates out for some of their stuff.

33:26.000 --> 33:46.000
Virtua Fighter V, who gives a crap on Xbox 360, will be 26th October, Universe at War for PC and Ghost Squad on Wii is 2nd November, Sonic Rush Adventure for the DS will be next week, Crazy Taxi, Fair Wars also will be later this month on PSP.

33:46.000 --> 33:55.000
Sonic Rivals 2 will be on November 2nd, and The Golden Compass will be on November 30th. There you go.

33:56.000 --> 34:00.000
Hitstun asks, do they get Virtua Fighter V 360 before we do?

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
I'm not sure.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Probably about the same week, right?

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
We're getting the last week of October.

34:07.000 --> 34:14.000
Interesting. Well, let's go to some release dates and travel the world and see what's coming out right now in all different places, not just from Sega.

34:14.000 --> 34:23.000
Oh, yes. In fact, this week's actually pretty good. We're starting to get into some of the better stuff, you know, fourth quarter stuff for all systems.

34:24.000 --> 34:34.000
And I know next week, well, I'm not a huge fan of it, but NHL 08 and NHL 2K8 are both coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and 360.

34:35.000 --> 34:42.000
Then we have EA's competition for Tony Hawk's Skate that's also going to be coming out next week.

34:42.000 --> 34:58.000
Let's see here. What? Anyways, Heavenly Sword will be making its way out next week, and hopefully that's another game that we will not be seeing a reviewer's guide going out for as well.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
I have high hopes for Heavenly Sword. It looks really good.

35:02.000 --> 35:02.000
It looks okay.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
It could be what Laird, unfortunately, was not.

35:04.000 --> 35:17.000
I am waiting a little bit to get it just because, you know, I don't know, the demo, it was short and I didn't enjoy myself too much with it, so we'll see.

35:18.000 --> 35:23.000
Also next week, Dirt on PlayStation 3, finally getting that game.

35:24.000 --> 35:29.000
On PlayStation 2,.hack//G.U. Volume 3, the last game in that trilogy.

35:29.000 --> 35:35.000
Guilty Gear XX Accent Core on PlayStation 2, that should make a lot of import fans happy.

35:36.000 --> 35:45.000
Let's see, then also on 360, you will be getting the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Game of the Year Edition.

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
That's going to be including both the expansion, I believe, and some of the download content for that.

35:51.000 --> 35:56.000
In other words, this is the release that fucks you all over who bought the game originally at full price and then all the expansions at full price.

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
If you want the PlayStation 3 one, guess what, it's not coming out. It got delayed.

36:01.000 --> 36:06.000
Fatal Inertia is also coming out in 360 next week, as well as Kengo, Legend of the Nine.

36:07.000 --> 36:12.000
And let's see, then also on the Wii, Big Fat Nothing.

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
On PC, of course, Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, the Game of the Year Edition.

36:18.000 --> 36:24.000
Democracy, apparently we're getting Democracy on September 11th, how appropriate.

36:24.000 --> 36:29.000
And some crappy Sherlock Holmes game, that's interesting.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
And then, of course, my favorite for the DS, Drawn to Life is coming out next week.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
That looks really awesome, so that would be cool.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
And then, of course, if you're a music game fan, Jam Sessions.

36:40.000 --> 36:47.000
I'm actually thinking about picking this up just because I need some guitar stuff in the mixes I do, so Jam Sessions.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
That's pretty much it.

36:49.000 --> 36:57.000
Good times. Lots of stuff coming out on the Japan release calendar for September 13th, 2007.

36:58.000 --> 37:04.000
On the Xbox 360, Musou Orochi is coming out. It's an action game. It'll be available on the Xbox 360.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
It doesn't look like a game they're bringing over here, but it looks like it could be a little bit of fun.

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, SSX Blur finally comes out in Japan for you guys over there.

37:14.000 --> 37:20.000
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Mega Zone 23, Ali Garland is coming out.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
That's like old school anime, too.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
Yet another old school anime having a game made out of it. Who would have thought?

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Like we don't have 20 million Lupin games.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Yeah, I know. But you get those games.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Also, on the PlayStation 2, I like this title.

37:34.000 --> 37:39.000
I think this is just getting a price reduction because it's going into Best Collection, but it's a game called Happiness Deluxe.

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
And it's even better. It's made by Marvelous Entertainment. So there you go.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
It's marvelously happy.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
And Sega's putting out yet another Pachinko game.

37:49.000 --> 37:49.000
No!

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Taisen Pachinko. He's shou... He's shou...

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Sakura Taisen is coming out.

37:55.000 --> 37:55.000
You know what I want to see?

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Oh, dude, they're doing a Sakura Taisen Pachinko?

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
They should have a Pachinko Xbox Live Arcade game. That'd be funny.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
That would be actually pretty rad.

38:04.000 --> 38:04.000
I think that would be pretty great.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
You know, then maybe we can find out what we're missing out on over here.

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
Also coming out on the Nintendo DS.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
I love this. This is my favorite title of the week.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Coming out on the Nintendo DS.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
I Love Dolphin is coming out in Japan.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
Oh, I bet you do.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
I would make a comment about that. Knowing certain things about certain people.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
Here's the best part. It's made by Starfish Entertainment.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
I Love Dolphin coming to the Nintendo DS.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Dolphin safe.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Do you know they make a viper called the Dolphin?

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
I don't know. Some Pokemon games and SimCity DS.

38:40.000 --> 38:40.000
You know, blah, blah, blah.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Oh, I can't forget the PSP. Let me see if there's anything on the PSP worth mentioning.

38:44.000 --> 38:44.000
Crap!

38:45.000 --> 38:45.000
Oh, Crisis Core!

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
Shit, I think there's a lot of people really excited about that.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Crisis Core also out on September 13th.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
As well as Fate Tiger Coliseum.

38:52.000 --> 38:52.000
Ooh.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
There you go.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
Those are your release dates for Japan.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
Well, how about for our friends in the UK?

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
On the 14th is Blazing Angels Secret Missions of World War II.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
CSI Three Dimensions of Murder.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
Yay.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Dungeons and Dragons Tactics for PSP.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Fatal Inertia on Xbox 360.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Freshly Picked Tingles Rosy Ruby Land.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Hooray!

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Freshly Picked Tingles. I love those!

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
That's on the DS.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
I hope it never comes over here.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
I'm going to import it.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
It will be in English.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
We have Heavenly...

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
English, English!

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
That means there will be extra vowels.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Extra vowels make everything better.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Heavenly Sword on PlayStation 3.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Heroes of Mana, which we already have over here.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
MotoGP07 Sonic Rush Adventure on the 14th.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Stranglehold Super Paper Mario on Wii.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
Yay!

39:53.000 --> 39:59.000
Something you guys were talking about reminded me of one other thing that I really missed in Final Fantasy XI.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
And that was boss monsters with no vowels in their name.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
Like...

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Is the name of a dragon.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Or no, I think there's a dragon you have to fight called...

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Good times.

40:16.000 --> 40:23.000
Good times. Anyways, as with most games, they've been getting updates and patches every now and then.

40:24.000 --> 40:31.000
And one in particular that happened this last week was BioShock got a title update to fix a few things.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Just some minor stuff I guess.

40:33.000 --> 40:45.000
Updates improve stability when loading autosaves and overall game stability corrects audio during title menu loading and addresses AI behaviors regarding health stations.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
So, that's kind of interesting.

40:49.000 --> 40:56.000
Another interesting thing though is of course people picking apart the PC version found a couple of notations for Plasmid Pack 1.

40:57.000 --> 41:01.000
Which is believed to be a download that's going to happen later on.

41:01.000 --> 41:06.000
Including some brand new Plasmids that you'll be able to buy from the machines and whatnot.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
So hopefully we'll see some download content a little bit later on.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
But of course, nothing official yet.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
I'm choking on breath. Yes, I just sounded like a Murloc just then.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Loki, keep talking. It's rude of me to talk with my mouth full.

41:24.000 --> 41:30.000
That's going to be awesome. I'm looking forward to some new Plasmids.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
You like new plasma?

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
New Plasmids.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Oh, I thought you said plasma. There's people who recycle their plasma.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
No, new Plasmids for the game. I love this show.

41:41.000 --> 41:47.000
Loki, you know what you should check out if you dig that Drawn to Life is there's a game that nobody knows about for GameCube called Monster Island.

41:47.000 --> 41:53.000
Where you could basically create your own monsters, draw them out on a screen and then play them in various competitions. It was very cool.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
Wasn't that like Magic Penjil?

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Yeah, they had Magic Penjil and they had Graffiti Kingdom that were also the same type of things.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
Yeah, it was cool though. It was good times if you liked that kind of thing.

42:01.000 --> 42:07.000
Magic Penjil, I had a 2DX system that was fighting and we also had popin' music.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
Yes, I think people drew a penis monster as well.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
The penis monster was great. I really have to say the penis monster was good.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
My character...

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
Not that that's, you know, some people don't like that.

42:21.000 --> 42:30.000
See, the game is easy to exploit though. My character was just like a teddy bear and I'd draw this big like square that would be attached to it and it would be all blue which would give you like more magic attack or something.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
What was the attack of the penis monster?

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
It was like, poke it.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
And swing around.

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
Did it have a similar attack as to a squid? Is that what happened when you poked it?

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
It was just, it would just sit and hunch over.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
Apparently...

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
That's because you weren't doing it right.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Whoever drew the penis monster...

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
Excuse me, what the fuck were you doing?

42:55.000 --> 43:07.000
It thought that the hair that someone drew on the testicles was actually like legs so it would walk around on legs of this giant thing and it was the worst Pokemon type game ever.

43:07.000 --> 43:12.000
Oh my god. Now that is something we need for the fucking Operator 11.

43:13.000 --> 43:20.000
Yeah, too bad the cam just shut off on Op 11 like 5 minutes ago because we got booted out from time feeds because we can only do 40 minute shows on there but whatever.

43:21.000 --> 43:30.000
What was I going to say? Oh yeah, Jason, Webmaster Jason, remind me to mark this episode explicit please a little later. Thank you.

43:30.000 --> 43:40.000
Seriously though, if you can find Magic Penjal or even better, Graffiti Kingdom, that game is really fun especially for 5 minutes.

43:41.000 --> 43:49.000
Oh, it's not fun for 5 minutes. Just, you get your friends over and you're like, you can draw your own characters and give them just time and eventually something perverted is going to come out of...

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Yeah, we tried to draw a vagina monster so they could fight but we ran out of ink.

43:52.000 --> 44:02.000
I think we got the...never mind. I was going to get into female anatomy but probably I shouldn't do that.

44:03.000 --> 44:13.000
Let's see, what was I going to say? Mr. DeBucket says, Wangzilla for the win. Also, oh I like this quote from Mr. DeBucket, isn't every GameCube game a game for GameCube that no one knows about?

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
Aww.

44:16.000 --> 44:16.000
Touche.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
Drunami says, I think I still have a save file with a penis monster.

44:20.000 --> 44:24.000
Oh, that's right because that was the day that we had Paper Plate Battle Royale.

44:25.000 --> 44:33.000
Son of Dad is thinking that the movie Superbad, the end credits, is suddenly reminding him of our discussion right now. So, go figure.

44:34.000 --> 44:38.000
Anyhow, moving from penis monster back to Bioshock.

44:38.000 --> 44:50.000
God, what can I say about this? Okay, somebody posted on the 2K forums about that basically his brother and him were trying to play the game Bioshock together.

44:51.000 --> 44:57.000
But the game wouldn't let him because as you may know, Bioshock on the PC only limits you to activate your account so many times.

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
You only get like five activations for the game and then that's it, you're cut off, no more.

45:01.000 --> 45:08.000
And it's been a very controversial maneuver. But what happened, okay, this guy named 2kTechJT responded,

45:09.000 --> 45:14.000
there's no other way to view this as one user has purchased the game, not the whole family.

45:15.000 --> 45:22.000
So why should your brother play for free? To which everybody goes, hello, hasn't it always been that way?

45:22.000 --> 45:31.000
I mean, if you bring a traditional CD, let's say Xbox 360 or Playstation 2 game home, and everybody gets to use that game, right?

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
Hello, this is nothing normal. If you buy a CD, everybody in the house...

45:36.000 --> 45:41.000
How about if he wants his brother to play, how about you just log into your brother's account on Windows and fucking play the game?

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
Instead of being a little whiny bitch about it, I want to install it on mine!

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
There's a certain amount of usage that goes along with it.

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
I have to say that I don't let anybody else use my computer.

45:54.000 --> 45:59.000
Yeah, but that's just because you're mean. How about you buy a 360 and play it on there? How about that, huh?

46:00.000 --> 46:04.000
How about that? Why are people whining so fucking much about this shit?

46:05.000 --> 46:12.000
If you know you're not supposed to be copying it for your brother and stuff like that, just have him log into your damn account and do it.

46:13.000 --> 46:17.000
Seriously, stop being so fucking lazy and just do what you need to do.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
What you need to do? Rob...

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
What? What? What? What?

46:23.000 --> 46:30.000
Anyway, this is a very important update I need to go here. 2K actually reached out to some of the gaming blogs and said,

46:31.000 --> 46:37.000
Just so you know, this 2K Tech JT guy, he's actually not an employee of 2K. He's an outside contractor.

46:38.000 --> 46:42.000
Please note that the forum moderator has been incorrectly quoted as a 2K employee.

46:42.000 --> 46:48.000
The individual JT Tech 2K works for an outside tech support group and is not an employee of 2K.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Additionally, 2K is investigating the validity of the post.

46:52.000 --> 46:59.000
I will say this, for all the BS people have been posting all around the internet about Bioshock on the PC,

47:00.000 --> 47:05.000
2K has done pretty good on their damage control because there's been a lot of companies out there that would have just kept their mouths shut and just said,

47:05.000 --> 47:13.000
Suck it. We don't care. You're buying the game anyway. But hats off to 2K for kind of doing something about all the noise around the internet.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
So, very cool.

47:16.000 --> 47:22.000
Rama would like to say, but Loki, if my account is password locked, I'm not telling it to my brother.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Tough. Your brother doesn't get to play Bioshock now, does he?

47:26.000 --> 47:31.000
I don't really have a little brother or anything that would find, but I would not want them to find my massive porn collection on my computer.

47:31.000 --> 47:38.000
And how old is his little brother anyways? I mean, because maybe he's not of age to be able to play the game.

47:39.000 --> 47:44.000
Hmm? Where are the parents? Think of the children?

47:45.000 --> 47:50.000
Yes. Loki from Orange Lounge Radio reminding you to think of the children. Alright, I'm done.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Think of how tasty they are.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
Oh my.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
Barbecued.

47:59.000 --> 48:03.000
With, like, asparagus. Asparagus is good.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
Hello, gaming story.

48:06.000 --> 48:11.000
Oh yeah, sorry, I was hungry again. You're eating on my breadsticks. That's okay, because they're bread bricks.

48:12.000 --> 48:17.000
So, for some news regarding, again, more information in the UK,

48:17.000 --> 48:31.000
it says that the sales for the Xbox 360 actually have increased, and the PSP is having their worst week since launch.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
Poor Sony baby.

48:35.000 --> 48:47.000
But at any rate, what they're claiming is responsible for the increase in Xbox 360 sales would be the Elite model, and the other price reductions for the Premium and Core systems,

48:48.000 --> 48:54.000
which are, I guess, making people really, you know, crazy about wanting them.

48:54.000 --> 49:05.000
However, with the upcoming launches for the Slim PSP on September 14th overseas, people just still don't care.

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
Well, I was going to say, without sounding like an ass, I mean, this isn't like, or a fanboy or whatever,

49:11.000 --> 49:16.000
I think this news is only temporary because the Slims are coming out, and because Christmas Hello is right around the corner,

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
sales for everything are going to pick up.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
Well, we'll see.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
We will see.

49:22.000 --> 49:33.000
Anyways, so, the Xbox HD DVD add-on, I guess, has gotten a price drop in Europe,

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
which is good, because everyone wants cheap add-ons.

49:38.000 --> 49:42.000
It will drop, looks like from 200 euros to 180 euros.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
So, great.

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
You get a little bit of a discount, and I do, I'm not sure if it's going on over there as well,

49:49.000 --> 49:55.000
but I know over here, once you buy it, you do get a rebate for five free HD DVD movies.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Fuckers. Not when I bought my HD DVD player.

49:59.000 --> 50:04.000
You know what I got? King Kong. It's still in the wrapping, I just would like to point out.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
You can also get Blu-ray players, too. They're kind of doing the same thing.

50:08.000 --> 50:14.000
They are desperate for people to adopt the next-gen video formats, but you should be fine.

50:14.000 --> 50:19.000
Do you think they're feeling a little heat, because whether you want to say it's thanks to the PlayStation 3 or whatever,

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
Blu-ray does seem to be pushing a little more of the market share.

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
Yeah, but really, they're counting them as players, Blu-ray players,

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
but really how many people are actually using them for Blu-ray. That's the thing.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
There is no way of showing that.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Well, yeah, but there is no way of showing it.

50:37.000 --> 50:43.000
I mean, because, yeah, okay, I use mine for Blu-ray movies sometimes, but I can count on one hand

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
how many times I've watched a Blu-ray movie on there. I mean, it's not a lot.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
I just don't use the system at all.

50:50.000 --> 50:56.000
And if I bought an HD DVD player, I don't think I would use it any more than I'm using the Blu-ray player.

50:57.000 --> 51:03.000
I don't know. Personally, I would not buy an add-on for the 360 for any sort of next-gen video format,

51:03.000 --> 51:08.000
because at least with the PlayStation 3, if Blu-ray doesn't win out, big deal. It's a fucking game machine.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
Computer. My mistake.

51:11.000 --> 51:16.000
And if, you know, say, HD DVD doesn't win out, then you're stuck with this fucking external drive

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
for, you know, you can't do anything with.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
So, I don't know.

51:23.000 --> 51:29.000
Alright, well, now, one period of time when you're going to have to watch these movies on the HD DVD

51:29.000 --> 51:36.000
is a four-hour period between 2 a.m. tonight and 9 in the, or I'm sorry, it actually starts at 2 a.m. tonight

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
and runs to 6 a.m.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
That's because Xbox Live is going to be down.

51:41.000 --> 51:46.000
So, sorry, kids, you're going to have to hold off on yelling the N word and the F-A-G word at each other

51:47.000 --> 51:51.000
for four hours while the system is down, because that's all people really do on Xbox Live.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
Which, by the way, I...

51:54.000 --> 51:58.000
So, they call each other nice and fancy?

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
Yes, they call each other nice and fancy.

52:06.000 --> 52:13.000
See, you're not helping your hole. You need to call me Casper instead of Big Gay Eddie.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Whatever, Rob, you're just a big silly.

52:17.000 --> 52:23.000
Well, guys, you just fragged me. Wasn't that fancy?

52:24.000 --> 52:29.000
Oh, look at me. I'm on the ground now, all helpless and laid down.

52:30.000 --> 52:33.000
It would be awful if someone violated me.

52:35.000 --> 52:43.000
Oh, I see you're squatting over and over again above my pelvis. Isn't that nice? Isn't that fancy?

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
What the hell is wrong with you, Eddie?

52:47.000 --> 52:52.000
Just because you've been watching what I do on Saturday nights by myself. Don't make fun of me.

52:57.000 --> 53:05.000
Wonder Dog Harold sits in our chat room. Snagglepuss is on Xbox Live.

53:05.000 --> 53:09.000
I can't even talk.

53:10.000 --> 53:18.000
Xbox Live is going to be down. Get over it. By the time most of you downloaded the podcast, it's already done anyway.

53:19.000 --> 53:23.000
So, we've spent far too long on this useless story. Jamie, please save the show.

53:24.000 --> 53:28.000
I like how Ranma says, Fag, fancy, articulate guys.

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
Who said that?

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Ranma, you're the best. You're awesome.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Why are you talking about a cigarette?

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
I am a fancy, articulate guy.

53:42.000 --> 53:48.000
So, according to Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry, man, they're old.

53:49.000 --> 53:53.000
I mean, I'm sorry. Aerosmith is really awesome, don't get me wrong.

53:54.000 --> 54:00.000
But it's like, I see really good pictures of all of them and then I see really old pictures of all of them.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
And then I look at Keith Richards and feel better.

54:03.000 --> 54:18.000
So, anyway, since they're working hand in hand with the folks behind Guitar Hero 4, and they are going to be, the game is pretty much going to be Aerosmith edition Guitar Hero.

54:19.000 --> 54:25.000
So, they told Aerosmith, yeah, it's all going to be about you. Totally about you. Please be in our game.

54:25.000 --> 54:32.000
Well, there will be other stuff, of course, but the hope is that the master tracks are Aerosmith, so that'd be cool.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
Okay, I have a bad joke for you guys.

54:37.000 --> 54:42.000
What did Steven Tyler say when Activision asked him to be in the next Guitar Hero game?

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
What did he say?

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH!

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
Yes, that was it.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
That's fancy talk.

54:52.000 --> 54:56.000
That's pretty accurate as being crappy.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
Anyways...

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
I think something was in the breadsticks at this point.

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
I didn't even eat the breadsticks, Rob, and I'm turning gay.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
You smelled them.

55:07.000 --> 55:27.000
So, anyways, if you're interested in checking out Rock Band and you happen to be living in the United States, guess what? They're going to be doing a road tour. In fact, it's going to be touring from Las Vegas and pretty much most of the country, including stopping in California a few times.

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
I heard they're going to be in Sacramento.

55:29.000 --> 55:40.000
Yes, they are going to be in Sacramento. In fact, I was confirming with our boss that we need to do a road trip if they happen to be down here pretty soon.

55:41.000 --> 55:45.000
Looks like actually in the next couple weeks, the 23rd or 23rd they're going to be in Sacramento, so we'll have to go check it out.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Jamie, are we going to go to the Rock Band show and have some fun?

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
No, I'm going to go see They Might Be Giants.

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
Okay, but it's going to be here for three days. Are you going to see They Might Be Giants for three days?

55:54.000 --> 55:58.000
No, I'm going to see them for one day, and that's about as much a concert as I can stand.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
It's not a concert, it's a play the game. You make your own concert.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Oh, play the game, I see. Well then, no.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Yes, it's what we do here on this show, Jamie. We talk about playing games, remember?

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
Well, no.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Well, Loki, will you go to the Rock Band tour with me?

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
I will definitely go. I'm not sure if it's going to be with you, though, but I will try to make it happen.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
Oh, gee, thanks.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
Well, sorry, I don't know if I'm going to.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
I will definitely go. I probably won't go with you.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
I will make a trip out there with you, but I will also make a trip out there maybe with my work.

56:28.000 --> 56:34.000
I will not, on either of those trips, be singing in the game. Fuck that shit.

56:35.000 --> 56:39.000
If it comes down, well, all we've got left is karaoke for you, Bell. Fuck you, I'm leaving.

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
I'm sorry, I thought I heard somebody say that they were doing some type of concert for the thing.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
Oh, no. You're the concert.

56:46.000 --> 56:53.000
No, they basically have this giant semi-truck and there's a stage that they have set up and you play a game.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
You know what? Screw you, Loki. I'll take Gay Eddie with me.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
I'll go do it. I'll go play the game.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
Rob, I'll go.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Because, Rob, when you sing, it's nice. And fancy.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
We'll be the fancy band.

57:07.000 --> 57:11.000
Oh, my God. We'll be the fancy band boys. Oh, my God.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
No, that's what you should be.

57:13.000 --> 57:16.000
We are the fancy, articulate guys.

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
Loki, you're so silly. I love you so much.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
You know what, Sal? We're going to get hate mail.

57:24.000 --> 57:32.000
No, because I really am gay, so I don't hate gay people. I mean, if you really talk like that, that's cool. I don't care. It's just funny.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
And then you can film it.

57:35.000 --> 57:41.000
Okay, speaking of Rock Band, there's some new song.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
Oh, my God.

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
This is one of the most horrible picture-ups I have ever seen on this computer. Is that Courtney Love?

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
Is that Courtney Love?

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
Yes, it is.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
That is Courtney Love.

57:54.000 --> 58:04.000
Which, by the way, she'll be making an appearance in Rock Band, you should know. Celebrity Skin by Hole will be in Rock Band, as well as the Yaya Yas maps and the Pixies Wave of Mutilation.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
Dude, cool.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
I love this song. Garbages, I think I'm paranoid because I love garbage.

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
No, the Pixies. That's cool.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
That is pretty rad. I like the Pixies, too.

58:14.000 --> 58:21.000
Now, there's some unconfirmed songs in the game, and these are forum members that are saying this from the Score Hero and Something Awful forums.

58:21.000 --> 58:31.000
So take this with a little bit of a grain of salt, but these would be very cool additions to the game. Red Hot Chili Peppers Danny California is rumored for the game, as well as Soundgarden's Black Hole Sun.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
That sucks.

58:34.000 --> 58:38.000
I mean, come on, who does not remember the video to Black Hole Sun back from the days when MTV was cool?

58:39.000 --> 58:40.000
Rob.

58:41.000 --> 58:45.000
Which, by the way, thank you to our live listeners tonight for choosing us over to those Skanky Awards shows that are going on on MTV right now.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
Back in the day?

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
Back in the day, yes. That was my freshman year of college.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
Back in the day. How old are you?

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
Thirty-one.

58:55.000 --> 59:02.000
That's right. She's just a fabulously accessorized girl. That's all she is.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
Yeah, right.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
Anyway, that's all I have to say.

59:06.000 --> 59:19.000
Well, speaking of things, from back in Rob's day, no, I'm kidding. Rock Band is also saying there will be 18 master recordings from The Grateful Dead as downloadable content. Isn't that cool?

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Oh, gosh, I hope it has Keep On Truckin' in it.

59:23.000 --> 59:27.000
Truckin' is one, Uncle John's Band, Touch of Gray, Sugar Magnolia, and Casey Jones.

59:28.000 --> 59:32.000
And my favorite part about the whole thing is they still haven't announced what the price point is going to be.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
Didn't they?

59:34.000 --> 59:41.000
No, they have never announced price points for download content for Rock Band yet, so people are kind of afraid.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
Wimpy people.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
What?

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
The ghost guy in our chat room says Jamie is old? She doesn't sound old?

59:50.000 --> 59:54.000
Well, you have to consider this guy's probably 15 or 16 or 18.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
Bite my butt.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
But you're young at heart. That's all that matters.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Seriously, the older I get, I realize 30 is not as old as you think. I remember when I was 18.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:14.000
I used to think that 30 was old because my mom had me really young, so my mom was 30 when I was in high school.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Yeah, my mom was 30 when I was in high school, and I thought 30 was old.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.000
And then I saw my friend's parents. I was like, is that your grandfather?

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
When I was in high school, my parents were like 60.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
I always thought that was so bizarre.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
My mom had me when she was 38.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
My mom had me at 17.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Wow. Ghost guy responded, I'm not going to bite anyone's butt.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
I love our chat. That was ghost guy.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Jamie is trying to figure out the whole bathroom situation.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Sorry, guys. We're listening to Jamie try to get in the bathroom. She's yelling at it.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
She went out there and she's like, oh, somebody's in there, and I'm thinking nobody's in there, but I wasn't going to tell her.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Anyways, so, surprise! Guitar Hero 3 on the Wii is not going to have download content initially, but at least it will have online play.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I don't know. They haven't really figured out how to implement download content yet, I guess, on the Wii.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
I know. I was going to say, how would they have download content on the Wii? The Wii is not exactly set up very friendly.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
I guess there's the Wii Shop channel.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:41.000
And also, where would they store it? There's no storage on the Wii, so they're going to be very challenged to try and figure out how to even do that.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
They just didn't really think when they designed the Wii, did they?

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
They're just like, oh, if no one knows the story, who's going to store it?

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
No, it's not that, because remember, they were trying to release the Wii for cheap. Remember, they wanted to do it at, what, $99 at first?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
They wanted to make it a very, very cheap system, so they purposely left all that crap out.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:09.000
But honestly, though, how much are flash drives? They're not that expensive. I mean, you can easily put a two or four gig drive in there and it wouldn't cost you anything.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I mean, it's stupid. It really is. Or just support additional storage or something. Ben said, no.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
You can add memory cards to it.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Yeah, for saving your save games, but not for anything else. That's it. It's just for save games and maybe virtual console titles and that shit.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Yeah, but they can't design it so that when you download content that it would go into the memory card?

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
That doesn't seem like it would be that hard for them to design it that way.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Well, they have to add a patch or something, because right now it doesn't support that.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Jamie, why did you walk in here and then tell me to die in a boat fire?

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Because you should.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
That's mean! See, you're mean!

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
You were making fun of me while I was going to the...

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Especially if you die...

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
That's what we do here. We make fun of you when you're not here.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
If you die in a boat fire, that's pretty pathetic.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Just kidding.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
If you die in a boat fire, that would be really awesome and stupid.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I don't want to die in a boat fire. I'm not going to go on a boat now.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Is it my turn yet?

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
No, it's not your turn. It's my turn.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I'm taking my turn to tell you guys that Video Games Live is having a CD release on October 15th.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
It's their Greatest Hits Volume 1.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Now, it's actually not a live show.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
They didn't go around to all these venues and actually tape the songs being played live.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
But they've actually taken some of these artists into the studio.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
For instance, Martin Lung, who's the piano player who plays all the songs.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
They got him to record some of these songs.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
And they're going to have the CD come out from World of Warcraft, Super Mario, Halo.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
It's going to be pretty awesome.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
That is, if you're a nerd.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000
And it's a rumor, but I believe that each copy is going to come with a lock of Tommy Tallarico's hair.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Can't confirm that.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
From his head or his pubes?

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
It doesn't say.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Maybe the limited edition comes from a different place.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
That's disgusting.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Wow, I think I made myself throw up in my stomach.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Rob, how does your body even work?

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
This is what happens when I'm gone for a week.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Everything just goes to hell.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
And Rob throws up in his stomach.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Which is totally counterproductive.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
I meant to say my mouth.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Didn't I tell you guys when the show started?

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
That would be like regurgitated feeding.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Isn't that eating?

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Yeah, no Rob, shut up.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Have you never heard the expression, you just made me throw up in my mouth a little bit?

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
There you go, that's what I was going for.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
But for some reason I said stomach.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
I don't know why, I told you guys at the top of the show, I'm broken tonight.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Aw, poor baby.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Let's get Rob some duct tape.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
I haven't even had anything to drink.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
What's wrong with me?

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I was going to come last week and bring you my really expensive booze from Grease.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
And it didn't happen.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
We definitely need to take a break pretty soon because the show is already broken as it is.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
But we've got one more thing for you guys before we go to a break.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
And that is the one and only Website of the Week.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.000
As presented by Dark Sakura who surfs the internet up and down and all around every week to find a website she likes to share with all of you.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Miss Dark Sakura, where should the kids be pointing their web browsers to this week?

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Somewhere else.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
No, the Website of the Week is BBC Radio 1 homepage actually.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000
I a lot of times really hate the crap that's on the radio over here.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:42.000
So I will go, you know, turn on the BBC Radio 1 and listen to it.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:49.000
I also a lot of times will record the, you know, interviews that go off of there and some of the music specials.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
You can actually get a lot of good information off there too.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Just like, you know, if there's other interviews posted, there's your singles charts.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
You know, you even get in some of the indie stuff that comes through.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
So I think that's pretty cool.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
A lot, I think, a different variety of music than what we're used to over here.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I mean, a lot of it's the same. You know, you got your mainstays, but I think it's pretty cool.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
I like that it's all free streaming radio.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
And the other good thing about it is that there's a schedule up.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000
So if there's something in particular that you want to listen to, a lot of times it will be up there.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
You can rewind it too and get back.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
I've actually recorded a number of guerrillas and interviews off of there back in the day.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Pretty cool.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Tiger Claw would like to back you up. Tiger Claw says BBC Radio 1 is awesome.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
The essential mix is the best show.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I like listening to, I can't think of her name, but she's one of the DJs on there.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
She really does some good interviews.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Anyway, very good stuff.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Do they still play the Spice Girls on BBC Radio 1?

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
I don't know. Usually I just block that out.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I miss the Spice Girls.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
The sheist girls.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Eddie, you want to go see the reunion tour with me in San Jose?

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
I so want to go, like, so bad.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Me too!

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Remember, why am I out here?

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.000
The very short version is that Irene and I, it was like 3 in the morning, were playing Spice World.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
I don't know if you guys remember that game from PS1.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
That game was awful!

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Awful, awful, awful, awesome.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
We were laughing so hard and it was like 3 in the morning, so of course Rob comes out wagging his finger.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Why am I out here?

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Because we were being bad and Rob was going to spank us, I don't know.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Well, never mind. There's another part to this story, but I can't say it, even though the show's already got an explicit tag.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Let's just say, let's just say they were interrupting something from all their laughing.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
I was very upset.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:51.000
I think we need to take a break on the show now, because I don't actually know how much video game content was in tonight's program.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:57.000
So we will go, and the people responsible for screwing up tonight's program will be sacked.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000
And those responsible for the sacking would like it to be known that they too have just been sacked.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Alright, so everybody will be sacked during our break, and we're going to come back with a stupendous Part B.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
It'll be fancy and nice.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Doing it in a completely different manner and at great expense.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Because, honestly guys, there's only one way we could probably fuck up this show even more.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
That's by letting Rob keep talking.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Well, that would be one. But the other would be is that tonight, and by the way, fuck you.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
In tonight's Part B...

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Do not want.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
No, but you do want this. Part B tonight will have the match game.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000
That's right. Nerd match game in Part B tonight. Can't wait for that.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
So Eddie will be here.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
That's too much metal for one man.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Shane will be here, and one more guest. We haven't even...

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Did you point at me when you said Shane would be here?

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
No! No, that means I have to sound really apathetic.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
May we go to break time now?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.000
