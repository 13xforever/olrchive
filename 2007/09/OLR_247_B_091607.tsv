487	19082	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
20430	20530	I am.
20550	20710	You are.
45504	46264	Okay, I am.
46924	47344	Just kidding.
47844	52745	Anyways, so there was a game that we saw a couple years back when they were first showing off the Wii.
53445	54486	And it was kind of neat.
54726	58146	I thought the title was retarded, but whatever.
58306	60727	So there's this game, Project Hammer.
61327	64527	And while people were speculating, is it on hold?
65327	65887	What's going on?
65987	67788	Well, according to me, it's been canceled.
68708	71248	And it's not coming back.
71548	74889	So that's too bad, because who doesn't like hitting people
75498	76339	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
97679	98139	It wasn't bad.
98840	101101	It's better than DK Bongo Blast.
101301	102561	I wonder why they ended up canceling it.
102581	103822	I wonder what we're going to get instead.
103862	109405	Because sometimes when these games get canceled, something else comes out instead that makes it, you know, kind of worth the wait.
109425	112266	They should have the Project Hammer guy in, like, Super Smash Bros.
112286	112966	That'd be hilarious.
113046	119089	Like, didn't they say at Game Developers Conference this year or something like that that Pikmin was the result of something else?
120430	125352	It was the result of, like, Mario's... Yeah, it was a Mario concept that ended up being the Pikmin game.
125372	126293	So you never know what might happen.
127737	129278	Frisbee asked a good question in chat.
129578	131178	Whatever happened to that game Sadness?
132159	133299	It's still being worked on.
133599	133840	Is it?
134380	135140	As far as I'm aware.
135400	135960	Alright, we'll see.
137161	138101	Now this is pretty cool.
138141	139602	Some new information about the Wii.
139642	142643	And I know this will make DarkSakura all kinds of excited.
143263	149446	It has been announced that TurboGrafx-16 CD games are on their way to Wii Virtual Console.
150246	153067	And I believe some of the earlier titles were announced.
153528	154308	I have not seen...
155821	157362	I don't remember what was on the early list.
157422	160504	Sadly, the Dracula game you love, Jamie, wasn't on there.
160624	161225	I do remember.
161245	162866	I want to say Ys 1 and 2 was on it, though.
162886	163906	Yeah, Ys 1 and 2 was on there.
164266	164847	That's great.
164947	166688	I actually have that game, but it's still awesome.
167128	169750	But I'm curious, and what we're all wondering about.
169770	170630	I want the Valis games.
170670	173132	Well, how the hell are they going to fit all this on the virtual console?
173172	175393	Because the Wii only has so much internal memory.
175413	182838	Okay, first of all, the biggest things about the TurboGrafx-CD games were that most of the audio on them actually is all Redbook audio.
183615	185812	So all you'd have to do is compress it.
186613	188594	Or maybe they've removed the audio from the games?
188634	189675	Do you think that maybe they've done that?
189995	190856	No, I think it's compressed.
190876	191556	Just put it down to MP3.
191576	192697	It'd probably be really small.
193138	195339	Or AugVorbis or whatever they want to use.
195359	195719	We'll see.
196040	198561	But I imagine you won't be able to fit that many of those on the game.
198621	201303	Or they're going to start selling these memory cards or something.
201343	202524	Virtual console memory cards.
202744	203084	I don't know.
204145	205646	Obviously, any memory card will work.
205666	206467	But you guys know what I mean.
206927	208888	They might start pushing people to get more memory cards.
208948	213011	The games themselves, though, didn't take up a whole lot of space.
213091	214092	I mean, they're just really...
214612	224439	The equivalent of, I think one of the biggest ones that I personally have is Sapphire, which has some rendered graphics in it.
225280	228182	No, actually it has some true polygons in it.
229523	235908	And some of the CD arcade games, but if we're just getting out like, you know, just Ys and...
237173	241959	and all the other sprite-based ones, that wouldn't take any space at all.
242179	243761	The games are only going to be 800 points.
244041	244802	That's a pretty good deal.
245183	246384	Yeah, that's a really good deal.
246484	248567	I don't think it's going to be a major thing at all.
248867	253993	Especially if they're doing the Bomberman CD that came as a pack-in with the duo.
254754	254814	Or...
257193	258675	and Rondo of Blood, maybe.
258796	260558	Rondo of Blood could actually easily be done.
260638	266087	If we're getting Super Nintendo cartridges on there, it is not going to be hard at all for them to do Rondo of Blood.
266107	269171	How much of a fangasm will you have if Rondo of Blood comes out on Virtual Console?
269191	272877	I'd be like, thank God I don't have to put my disc in the machine anymore.
275141	280664	My actual Rondo of Blood CD is still in perfect condition, but I twitch every time.
280744	284886	I can't move the machine while I'm playing it because the disc costs $300.
285206	294531	It was saying that they were talking about there's going to be 10 games in 2007, 5 more slated for 2008.
294751	302495	Game downloads will be 800 points, and I guess they're saying Rondo of Blood and Snatcher are true possibilities.
302515	303396	Yeah.
304520	304900	We'll see.
305581	306101	That'd be awesome.
333300	341364	That's rad, though, that they actually released that on Virtual Console, because we have never in this country seen the original Lost Levels, except on ROMs.
341424	344566	But if I seem to recall right, wasn't that a disc game?
344826	346827	That's what I said, it was a Famicom disc game.
347247	347627	Wow.
348328	350689	And so the price for it is going to be 600 points.
351269	358193	But I think that that's actually fair, because it is, you know, basically a game that...
358948	360389	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
382479	386681	But maybe Doki Doki Panic will come out now that they're releasing Japanese games on the console.
387021	389683	That opens huge doors now.
390263	391403	Well, here's a little bit more.
391804	398447	We have Mario Super P-Cross coming out, which is 900 Wii Points.
399487	403569	And then we have Newtopia 2, which we were discussing earlier.
404429	406111	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
429592	432534	In Europe and Australia.
433075	435236	And I guess this is week one is Mario week.
435636	438658	Next week, they're going to be having Ninja week.
439559	443782	And that's going to include Ninja Gaiden and Ninja Jaja Maru-kun.
444682	448445	And then I guess the third week is going to be Sci-Fi week.
448465	450706	And that's going to have Sin and Punishment and Gradius 3.
452728	453408	That's a good game.
454709	457511	Actually, of the Gradius games, which one's your favorite?
459774	460594	I miss Salamander, Life Force
482912	511734	but I think Salamander was a slight bit cooler I'm really hoping now this is completely off topic here and I did like Life Force or Salamander I was going to say it'd be really awesome if they did they really need to do this in the US as well and I think they also need to do like the Nintendo World Championships cart and have that with an online leaderboard with scores that you can post on there if anyone remembers that the World Championship cart
512250	512750	Yeah.
513330	514210	I'm kind of curious.
514250	518731	I'm going to ask the chat room what kinds of import games that we've been missing in the U.S.
518811	519411	or the U.K.
519491	522792	for a long time would you like to see come to Virtual Console?
523072	528293	I'm sure somebody's going to say Doki Doki Panic, although in some extent... I'll take the first five ones on Pirate Message.
528313	528633	How's that?
528793	531554	We already have Doki Doki Panic.
531574	532734	You want to take some private messages?
532774	533014	Yeah.
533214	534514	Send me the first five private messages.
534534	536135	Tell me what import game you'd like to see come out.
536275	536535	All right.
536615	537535	Then we'll read those in a little bit.
537655	537755	Yep.
539139	540900	Send DarkSakura a private message in our chat.
541080	544122	But it has to be in our regular chat room, chat.orangelondradio.com.
544142	545022	And not 2DX.
545702	545962	Okay.
546303	552826	Remember, if you're watching us on Operator 11, we're not looking at the chat room over there because our computer that streams Op 11 is all the way on the other side of the room.
553946	555667	So, wow.
556108	556748	Virtual console.
557668	559869	So other neat stuff, I guess.
560310	563031	Oblivion's Gamebryo engine has been ported to the Wii now.
563795	564996	Dark Age of Camelot
582253	583454	Oh, I mean, that's pretty cool.
583474	586156	Maybe we'll see an actual cool role-playing game or something.
586196	587137	Maybe something scaled down.
587177	588277	Hey, they could do Oblivion.
588558	590959	Remember the PSP version that was supposed to be coming out a while ago?
590979	593141	What the hell ever happened to the Wii?
593741	594482	I don't think it's coming.
594602	595403	I think it got cancelled.
595823	596163	Really?
597084	601467	But, hey, who says they can't port that over to maybe the Wii or something?
601947	607972	Where they have a little bit more disk space to work with and, I don't know, real-time sword controls, maybe?
608372	608752	I don't know.
609313	610313	Just speculation here.
610974	611214	Huh.
611234	611314	Yeah.
611798	612258	Interesting.
612739	620965	Well, certainly if these guys want to use this Oblivion engine to make new games for the Wii, it's not like there's a shortage of Wiis out there.
621025	623207	I mean, certainly these things are still selling pretty well.
623487	626530	I'm sure we've had plenty of sales stories on the Wii in previous shows.
627110	628612	And, of course, this all leads up to Christmas.
628632	631334	You might remember last Christmas, finding a Wii was tough.
631414	634877	I mean, it was the Cabbage Patch Kids or the Furbies of last year.
635357	640181	So, yeah, and actually, rare fact or rare dumb little tidbit, I actually own a Furby.
641325	642146	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
657695	658215	What's up?
658316	661037	Are you guys going to have enough supply this Christmas season?
661357	665320	Well, Reggie Fils-Aimé says, quote, And that was a quote that Reggie Fils-Aimé said to the San Jose Mercury News.
665400	667821	So, of course, if you really want one of these, though...
678928	682789	Reggie Fils-Aimé still says you should regularly check to see if the system is available.
683069	689570	So even though they're saying they're going to flow through the streets with Wii supplies, you probably still want to call the store and check.
689830	691071	I'll believe it when I see it.
691371	692131	That's what I'm saying.
692251	693811	I'll believe that shit when I see it.
694091	694351	Really?
695031	695511	I don't believe it.
696312	699112	I mean, obviously I haven't tried to purchase a Wii in a long time.
699432	700252	How is it out there?
700292	702433	I mean, are they still pretty hard to find?
703213	703953	It's been getting worse.
703973	704193	Really?
704453	704593	Yeah.
704613	707074	Promises, promises, and then no fucking delivery.
707174	707954	That's what it's been.
708482	709042	Sadface.
709763	713025	I just hope they have some games to move those systems this year.
713105	714706	But I guess we get in Smash Bros.
714766	716607	Brawl, Mario Galaxy.
716667	717668	Those will be two AAA titles.
717688	718329	Don't get me wrong.
718349	725694	They're going to have a pretty good first-party lineup for the rest of this year and even January, hopefully Mario Kart soon.
726534	726774	True.
727034	730016	But it's all about systems.
730156	731117	You really need the systems.
731157	734279	And I really hope that he's not blowing smoke up my ass.
735040	735680	Let's hope not.
736741	738202	Because I don't like smoke in my ass.
738874	739514	Much like meat.
741135	741575	Anyways.
742976	744697	Well, we got our responses in.
745077	745537	Ah, okay.
745898	746338	Let's hear them.
747118	749259	Leo Christoph says, Kurukuru Kururin.
750720	751700	I don't even know that game.
751720	752901	It's a Game Boy Advance game.
753261	755622	Oh, you can't have Game Boy.
755642	757523	They don't do Game Boy games on Virtual Console.
757583	758064	Cheater.
759324	760225	Damn dirty cheater.
760245	760825	No, I'm just kidding.
761285	762846	Foodie Monster says, Gauss Panic.
764247	764927	That would rock.
765247	765968	Yes, winner.
766468	768509	GS68 says, Gradius 2 NES version.
769753	770494	Don't we already have?
770694	771274	No, we don't.
772295	773336	In Japan, they got it.
773536	773737	Yes.
774757	776479	Hitson says Pulseman for the Mega Drive.
777520	777880	Wow.
778461	781323	Well, you know what I would pick for Mega Drive?
781784	783325	It'd freaking be Panorama Cotton.
783745	784366	Oh, hell yeah.
784426	784926	Good luck.
785206	786808	Well, you know I have Rainbow Cotton.
788702	797927	This somehow comes up, because I seem to remember I asked, I made the mistake of asking in the early days of OLR, because Jamie has a very scary collection of video games in her house.
798067	798787	What are you missing?
799007	800708	What's the one thing you want that you're missing?
800768	801908	Frickin' Panorama Cotton.
801928	803209	Frickin' Panorama Cotton.
803849	807631	Okay, Panorama Cotton, Sega made 600 copies of it.
808431	809912	I know somebody who owns one.
810972	811833	And I got to touch it.
812653	814094	And it was a special day in my life.
815943	819904	Did you touch it with your fingers or did you rub it on your arm or your boobs?
819924	821945	I've actually played a legit Panorama Cotton before.
822045	822405	Did you?
822905	824085	It was really, really nice.
824125	824885	Can I touch your hand?
825706	827906	I've touched the hand that touched a Panorama Cotton.
828346	828706	You should.
829867	831707	I'll hook you up with playing Panorama Cotton.
831727	832227	All right, all right.
832567	836848	Rostelia T suggests Terranigma and Dragon Quest V and VI.
837809	837989	Okay.
838089	843250	Well, that might be cool, but obviously they might have to translate it, and I don't think these other ones were translated, so...
843908	847169	Chris B mentioned the Japanese Mario Bros.
847189	850250	2, not the All-Stars version, but that was the one they're getting in the UK on Virtual Console.
850790	851990	So it's only really a matter of time.
852511	852771	Cool.
853991	855791	And DarkTetia says Crisis Force.
857292	857532	Wow.
857772	858672	So what would you pick, Rob?
860573	860633	Um...
861704	864565	How about the version of Excitebike where you could actually save and load?
864785	865946	That would be the disc version.
866466	869248	Why didn't they do that for the fucking virtual console version?
869368	870708	That's a really good question.
870768	871048	I don't know.
871289	872229	Okay, you know what I want?
872329	872909	Here's what I want.
872989	875691	You want to talk about fucking obscure only available in Japan only?
876271	880613	I want the Zelda 1 remake that was on the Nintendo Channel thing.
881053	882074	The whatever it was called.
882134	882874	The NPS Satellaview.
883014	883374	That's it.
883614	884295	The Intelliview.
884575	885435	Satellaview.
885675	887016	What was the remake about?
887076	888237	It was just different graphics?
888377	890818	It was Super Nintendo graphics, and I think it had shorter levels.
891398	901588	It was meant, um, this, this, uh, Teleview was, um, a, uh, pay service where you had a timer for how long you could play, but there are hacked ROMs out there now that you can play it without a timer.
901608	902109	Are there really?
902129	902789	Yeah, Dan played through it.
903430	903530	Oh.
903650	904251	Played through it.
904911	906253	I didn't know that there were ROMs in there.
913357	913757	Oh, that's rad.
913977	915138	From the big competition.
915178	915998	That would be rad.
916118	918839	Remember the, that would be so cool on the Wii.
919279	922540	If they would bring back that old, you know, like the World Championships.
922560	923901	Remember the Nintendo World Championships?
923941	926001	Like I said about five minutes ago.
926261	926581	Sorry.
927762	928962	The online leaderboards.
929362	931323	That's exactly what I said five minutes ago.
931363	932423	Were you not paying attention?
932483	933164	I guess not.
933484	933964	God.
936845	938265	I was thinking about Panorama Cotton.
938305	941246	Maybe they'd eventually finish Robotech Crystal Dreams.
943206	945989	We have a wireless classic controller for the GameCube.
968450	972112	Okay, oh no, it's for the Wii, but it's by Thrustmaster, which has the best name ever.
972192	973152	Thrustmaster.
974072	975133	Is that the name of the controller?
975153	976233	Thrustmaster?
976253	978534	No, the company that's putting it out is Thrustmaster.
978654	983176	That sounds like, you know, something Suzanne Summers would be selling with the Thighmaster, the Thrustmaster.
983196	988799	That sounds like a bad porn, you know, instead of like Beastmaster, you have, you know, Thrustmaster, Beastiality Master or something.
988819	989659	I don't know.
991780	993260	Thrustmaster just sounds like bad porn.
994521	994741	Okay.
995421	995882	Good times.
996482	996942	Any ways.
998882	1004444	So, here's another thing I don't understand about that wireless virtual console controller.
1004904	1009586	Why they don't have it where it can be also a GameCube controller as well.
1009866	1016728	Why don't they release something like that for the Wii so that you can use one controller for virtual console and for GameCube games.
1017368	1018349	That's what you need to do.
1018549	1019489	Make it happen, people.
1021430	1024791	Anyways, one thing that certain parents don't want to happen is...
1025626	1032927	Much like me, is the Wii Zapper attachment, which is the most retarded thing on the face of the earth, I swear to God.
1032987	1033467	Why the hate?
1033907	1034608	Why the hate, Loki?
1034628	1035048	Why the hate?
1035128	1035748	It's stupid.
1035768	1036688	It's a piece of plastic.
1036728	1037508	You don't need it.
1037708	1040008	And it does not enhance your games, and I will prove it to you.
1040028	1040509	That's right.
1040689	1041369	When it comes out.
1041389	1042309	You might owe me a date.
1042649	1044269	I will not owe you a date at all.
1045229	1046550	What was I supposed to give you if you win?
1046570	1047070	I don't remember.
1047350	1050330	You were supposed to... Oh, I have to take Nelly off your hands for a night.
1050490	1050710	Yeah.
1050730	1051270	That's what it was.
1051290	1052010	All right.
1052111	1053671	Anywho, so it is...
1055250	1059791	It has been announced officially that it is going to come out in November on the 19th, I believe.
1060331	1065013	And it's going to feature, hooray, Zelda's crossbow training.
1066273	1074275	Which is going to be, I guess, exactly like the crossbow training that was in Twilight Princess.
1074395	1074675	Hooray.
1076096	1077556	So, yeah, for all over $20.
1078396	1081157	But there's some Jersey parents, though, that are...
1081952	1082653	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1111719	1113480	Thank you for watching!
1131764	1132485	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1149965	1151806	and, uh, hello, the Super Scope.
1151826	1152467	The Enforcer?
1152847	1156209	The Super Scope was a freakin' bazooka that you put on your shoulder.
1156229	1159391	You remember the lethal Enforcer's guns that looked like six-shooters?
1159511	1165454	Even though they were red and, you know, pink and blue, you know, they were still in full-on gun shape.
1165735	1166795	I love the Super Scope.
1166815	1168896	Why the fuck didn't the Super Scope do better?
1169277	1172318	It's because there were no good freakin' games for it.
1172438	1176041	But, I mean, it was a goddamn bazooka that you got to play with.
1176141	1176461	I mean...
1177265	1178025	I love my SuperScope.
1178045	1179185	That's how you win up the competition.
1179265	1180006	Oh, we have a gun.
1180046	1181366	Well, we have a fucking bazooka.
1181906	1182766	Top that shit.
1183406	1185007	Nintendo's like, look, we'll whip it out.
1185047	1185387	Ours is bigger.
1185427	1187547	And then Sega's like, well, we have a half bazooka.
1187847	1189067	They call it the Menacer.
1190028	1192408	Yeah, we also had the Activator, and we know how well that went.
1192548	1198509	So now parents are all getting pissed off at this Wii Zapper thing, which looks nothing like a gun.
1198569	1200710	I mean, it looks kinder.
1200890	1202930	It's like a gun-shaped cookie cutter or something.
1202950	1203551	I don't know how to explain it.
1203571	1205071	If it was a gun, it would be a Tron prop.
1205091	1205711	Yeah.
1206508	1209411	It's as much of a gun as a banana is a gun, okay?
1209451	1212053	That's seriously the Wii Zapper.
1212153	1215736	Ooh, I like this comment from Ranma in chat, chat.orangehallstradio.com.
1216056	1226765	Ranma says this, It simply amuses me that about 20 years ago when Nintendo first introduced the Zapper, the same soccer moms and dads that are protesting against it were playing these light gun games on the original NES.
1227126	1229768	If that's not the biggest form of hypocrisy, I don't know what is.
1229828	1230969	But hey, that's just me.
1231309	1232089	Here's something.
1232129	1234030	It's all these fucking parental guidance groups.
1234070	1243934	They fucking see a little headline or get, like, tipped off on something, and then they go ballistic about it without actually using said item or even knowing anything about it.
1243954	1247755	I mean, they're pissed off at Bully when they knew, oh, my God, it's a game with bullies in it.
1248035	1249356	Oh, hate, hate, hate.
1249956	1256178	And then, you know, they didn't know what the hell the game was, and it was, like, kind of promoting against bullying people.
1256778	1258819	And it's just...
1260009	1265052	All you have to know is you don't need to listen to these people and nothing they ever do ever works anyway.
1265813	1267974	Their banning of games worked?
1268094	1268194	No.
1269781	1271322	It hurt anybody's sales?
1271422	1271962	No.
1272282	1273503	Has it helped sales?
1273563	1275164	Has it given more publicity and stuff?
1275224	1275904	Yes, it has.
1276004	1279646	So they are actually helping the sale of this stuff, you morons.
1279746	1281507	Escapist has a good question in chat, too.
1281567	1285729	Why aren't they protesting Big Buck Hunter, those deer hunting games in the front of every Walmart?
1285749	1291052	Or how about why aren't they protesting Time Crisis 4, which looks more like a gun than this thing?
1292433	1294854	Oh, it's because the Wii, the Wii is a system for kids.
1295154	1296435	No, it's not, you morons.
1297461	1297941	Seriously.
1298102	1300544	Thank God these crazies are in the minority, at least I hope so.
1301584	1307730	Those of you listening might notice that the rant levels seem to have gone through the roof on this story, and y'all know what that means.
1313574	1316136	It's time for the FUs of the week.
1317057	1317438	DarkSakura.
1317458	1317658	DarkSakura.
1321019	1327745	My FU of the week has to go, I wouldn't really say so much towards PlayNC, but it has to go toward my copy of Guild Wars.
1328366	1333991	Because I've been playing on the demo for a little while and I finally decided to open my box and install it on my PC.
1334452	1338876	Since I don't have World of Warcraft, not on my PC, but on my laptop, since I don't have World of Warcraft installed on here.
1339396	1342739	And until I have my PC rebuilt, I'm just going to stop paying for my World of Warcraft account.
1343220	1346563	So it's like, Guild Wars is free, I already have a character, I have a free box.
1347247	1354110	So I go to peel off the sticker so I can scratch off my ID, my access key, and the access key peels off with it.
1355151	1356031	A lot of it did.
1356711	1358652	And I was like, well, shit.
1359573	1361534	And Heather, bless her, she helped me.
1362074	1364015	She got me my game for my birthday.
1364095	1366816	I know, and I'm finally installing it.
1367476	1374840	And I've gone through all of that time upgrading my Guild Wars and everything and downloading all the patches, which has so much better of a patch experience.
1375367	1384272	I sent in my request, I'd have to say around 7 o'clock on Thursday I had a response within an hour I had a second response 30 minutes after that
1405123	1409006	Friday, I got two more responses telling me that they were forwarding it to a different party.
1409347	1413210	They were keeping me informed at every step of the way, and that's really good customer service.
1413850	1419856	So, F you to the disc, but a thank you goes to PlayNC, except for being closed on the weekend.
1421837	1422558	There's the end.
1422618	1423198	Alright.
1423639	1425901	Anyways, fuck you too.
1426101	1427462	Stars in Vacaville.
1427562	1432726	My god, is that a whole bunch of ghetto wrapped into one ugly ass building.
1433147	1433267	And
1433965	1438226	You know, QZAR has really gone downhill there, as well as everything else there.
1438266	1442287	Their employees don't give a shit, and I don't give a shit either, and I will not be coming back.
1444028	1447809	And that's saying a lot, because the next QZAR is fucking 45 minutes away from that.
1448389	1450889	So, that depends on you.
1452350	1452810	My turn?
1453310	1453470	Yeah.
1454189	1457491	I'll have to give an FU to the waffle place I ate breakfast at today.
1457791	1459952	Now don't get me wrong, waffles are awesome.
1459992	1461813	Like, waffles are God's food, okay?
1461853	1463293	Waffles are like the best thing ever.
1463373	1466094	I mean, can anybody think of a better food than waffles?
1466615	1466835	No?
1466895	1467615	Didn't think so.
1467975	1468896	Two waffles!
1468916	1470897	Yes, two waffles!
1471077	1471857	Here's the thing, though.
1473078	1479901	I did have a pretty... The reason why I give the place an FU is because they didn't have a peanut butter waffle on their menu.
1480261	1483162	Like, the competing waffle shop crossed town.
1483956	1484596	DarkSakura.com
1512642	1513162	So there you go.
1543257	1549300	and the best hash browns ever because you can get them smothered, covered, chunked, cheese, everything on it.
1549340	1550701	And I was like, ah, sexy.
1551401	1558584	But I went to Waffle House and I came back with a hat and they wouldn't sell me a cup because I wanted a big coffee mug that said Waffle House on it.
1560866	1563847	And just to let people know, I'm going to Alabama in November.
1564487	1571771	I will be doing my usual Cyber Station in Mobile, Alabama run because I used to work at that freaking arcade and I hate it.
1573226	1574647	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1601844	1608869	But the thing about me going to Cyber Station is that any new Namco arcade game that comes out, all the Namco arcades get it first.
1609430	1615174	So that's why I was in such a big tizzy to get to that one when I went a few years ago so I could go play Tekken 5.
1616175	1619237	Because, you know, they got it like a couple of months before Golf Land did.
1621078	1623280	But I will not be going to New Orleans.
1623560	1624881	Sorry, that's too much of a drive.
1625381	1626362	I may be in Biloxi.
1627936	1638654	I will be in Dothan, Alabama and I will probably stop at the Tilt for about 5 minutes and leave to also kick a machine of your choosing if the Tilt is closed, I don't know if it's still at the mall
1639306	1639846	Beemaw, OnlyMaw.
1639906	1641547	Hopefully a listener will know and can email us.
1641767	1647489	But I was going to say, someday when we're rock stars, that should be how we go out on tour to promote things.
1647529	1653531	We should set up a time in an arcade for everybody to meet us there, and everybody can gather around a machine, and then we all walk in and kick it and leave.
1653832	1660674	I did go to a DDR tourney, and this is when we already had Max.
1661214	1664395	But their newest DDR machine that they had at this arcade in –
1666348	1668049	I want to say it was at the Beau Ravage.
1668089	1669770	This is, of course, before Katrina hit.
1670451	1672412	It was a fifth mix.
1673333	1674733	And I went to meet up with people there.
1675014	1675914	This was a few years ago.
1675934	1678056	I made some cool friends, too.
1679837	1685540	But just also to let people know while I'm thinking about it, there's not going to be any more Pump Up the Volume until I get my computer replaced.
1686341	1687742	My computer died.
1689103	1689443	A lot.
1690764	1691464	So, I'm done.
1691965	1692445	Sorry to hear it.
1693846	1694066	Well...
1695187	1698350	We got through our FUs of the week, minorly unscathed.
1701313	1704056	Are there any other traveling anybody's doing this year that should be noted?
1705217	1705577	I don't know.
1705697	1706939	I know where I'm not going.
1707159	1708220	Where are you not going?
1708400	1710182	I'm not going to E4ALL.
1710402	1710742	Why is that?
1710822	1712284	I still kind of want to go for E4ALL.
1712404	1714546	I have the week off work, but why is it that you don't want to go?
1715006	1719911	Because it's like everything, everybody's canceled and it's also in LA and also the wife probably wouldn't let me anyways.
1721494	1726218	Well, you know, it really, it's, you know, a long ways away.
1726299	1729702	If it were like in San Francisco or something like that, that'd be a little different.
1729762	1737068	But, you know, eight hours away for something that's, you know, progressively getting worse, I don't know.
1737389	1739611	I mean, not for me.
1739631	1739951	We'll see.
1740031	1744075	I kind of want to go to Network, you know, and see who I can meet and what have you, but we'll see.
1744954	1748720	Anyhow, there is a brand new version of Winamp coming out.
1748760	1752346	A lot of you guys left Winamp behind when you switched to iTunes to run with your iPod.
1752406	1754209	No, I don't touch that iTunes shit.
1754370	1755612	I flipped off iTunes.
1755712	1756694	In the Internet's...
1757213	1758154	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1785876	1793903	I'm not sure exactly how it works yet, but I'm sure we will see more when the release of this comes out, which I'm not sure exactly when it's supposed to.
1793923	1796385	I haven't seen a date on it, but I imagine it's later this year.
1797445	1798066	That's pretty cool.
1798502	1803866	and I was going to remind the chat room because it's been a while since we talked about the whole Altercade thing.
1803906	1819579	The reason why you're supposed to kick an Altercade machine is because at one time other than the fact that it sucks, at one time the company that owns Altercade tried to register a trademark for or copyright or something for MAME and that's why.
1820400	1822001	Even though they didn't make any of that.
1822762	1825604	It was this big legal nightmare but Altercade sucks anyway.
1827465	1827666	So
1828832	1851874	This is, I guess, new news there, but old news for us, really, because we've had DDR in schools for a long time, is over in the UK they're using Dancing Stage, which is the version of Dance Dance Revolution over there, to combat childhood obesity.
1853031	1866895	There are trials that are done in Bedfordshire schools to see if people will play that, but they're targeting it towards girls who don't want to play sports, especially competitive sports.
1866955	1872497	So it's basically to help increase activities going on at school, and I think that's pretty cool.
1874218	1878359	I mean, I played DDR for a long time, and, you know, it's activity.
1878419	1879379	Activity is activity.
1880239	1880660	Definitely.
1882725	1883546	Let's see here.
1884346	1901676	I was going to say there's a brand new, of course we played a little bit, if you were listening to us live during the break, brand new album coming out from OC Remix, and it's Livestream, a tribute album to Final Fantasy VII, or Voices of the Livestream, I should say.
1902737	1905939	It is four discs, huge, completely free.
1906079	1907440	There's a 2.32 gigabyte torrent
1909525	1926933	for it available, and it's split up, I guess, into their four different universes, Crisis Core, Jersey Service, Advent Children, and Last Order, and features a bunch of awesome music, 45 tracks including, and features the work of 42 different remixers.
1928654	1931175	So, freaking awesome.
1931396	1932156	Download it now.
1932236	1936518	We'll actually play a couple clips here, just some real quick clips here on the show, so you can hear what some of this
1936854	1938135	This is one we played during the break.
1938195	1942097	This is a Jenova remix called Jenova Celestial by Blind.
1956045	1956445	I like that.
1956485	1957745	It's all like techno-y and stuff.
1957846	1965110	And there's a Chocobo remix called Que, Electric de Chocobo, which is by an artist named Durangan.
1965290	1965810	Here's a little clip.
1977583	1978643	Full Frontal Assault Pretty rad.
2003908	2004549	DarkSakura, DarkDragon
2018803	2025266	One game that you don't use custom soundtracks for, though, is Guitar Hero 3, and certainly it seems like every week we're hearing about some new songs in the game.
2025646	2035870	Well, get this, if a recent post on Score Hero that came up and then was taken down not even two minutes later is to be believed, the full song list for Guitar Hero 3 has leaked.
2036390	2041232	The whole fact that it was up and then taken down right away certainly seems to make it look like that it was...
2042561	2042981	Removed.
2043021	2046482	And you'll have to forgive me because I don't remember exactly what has been announced and what's not.
2046762	2048402	But I do notice some interesting stuff here.
2048442	2050883	Like, I remember that Tom Morello was announced as a boss.
2051603	2054024	But Rage Against the Machine has Bulls on Parade in there.
2054324	2055964	Remember, that's a pretty awesome guitar song.
2056484	2058005	And let's see, what else caught my eye here?
2059325	2061585	Tenacious D's in there, but I think they were announced for that before.
2061685	2063226	Guns N' Roses, Welcome to the Jungle.
2063926	2065846	Aerosmith, same old song and dance.
2065906	2067747	So Aerosmith might actually be Guitar Hero 3.
2068127	2068527	I know we heard...
2069705	2071807	I guess, what was this one that says Boss Lou Guitar Battle?
2071827	2072848	I don't know.
2072888	2073608	I don't know who Lou would be.
2073628	2073969	Let's see here.
2101916	2102737	Lou Reed, maybe?
2102837	2103277	I don't know.
2103618	2105259	Disturbed, stricken, that's kind of cool.
2105419	2106720	Where does it say Lou?
2106800	2107340	Oh, I don't know.
2107981	2109282	Maybe it's an in-game character.
2109322	2109662	Who knows?
2110403	2110663	Maybe.
2112484	2114045	I don't know my guitar heroes, apparently.
2114065	2115206	I'm trying to see if there's anything else.
2115226	2117588	But now again, this is a rumored list, so we don't know for sure.
2117608	2119909	I don't know.
2119930	2122171	It looks pretty official to me.
2122231	2124573	Yeah, it looks pretty convincing.
2124913	2125293	I don't know.
2125534	2125914	We'll see.
2126674	2127455	I mean, the game's out.
2127975	2128155	What?
2128476	2128856	Next month?
2129672	2131154	It's the end of next month, the 31st.
2131374	2133295	Halloween!
2133496	2134456	Actually, no, I take that back.
2134637	2136198	The 28th is when it's coming out.
2136278	2136758	Sunday.
2137659	2140221	Oh, they're doing a weekend release because they can.
2140822	2141102	All right.
2141623	2144445	Anyhow, we're going to do the mailbag segment now because we can.
2144765	2145586	And that's what we want to do.
2145686	2147308	And every week you guys send us emails.
2147348	2153333	And DarkSakura picks a few of her favorites and reads them live on air and then makes fun of them as well when she feels like it.
2154278	2156860	Mailbag at OrangeZonesRadio.com is the place to send those emails.
2157420	2158321	So open up the mailbag.
2158781	2160842	Dive in, DarkSakura.
2160982	2162203	What's in there?
2163084	2163804	Hello, guys.
2163864	2164305	What's up?
2164525	2168487	This is FoodieMonster from Argentina, and this is probably my first email to you guys.
2168968	2174891	Anyway, I won't make it long since I've been known to call into the show a few times, so I'm not scared of the sky plane to make any long-winded rants.
2175492	2180155	The reason to this email is to send you guys a picture of the game Drawn to Life for the DS.
2181152	2185113	I believe you guys don't know this game, which got released on September 11th, I believe, so it's new.
2185453	2190755	It's a cutesy game and would be well-defined as a weird hybrid between Zelda Adventure Island, Mario, and Sonic.
2191355	2193076	Yes, I know, it all seems to be all over the place.
2193776	2206200	Anyway, the point is that the gimmick of this game is that you basically draw everything, and not just lines, no, I mean full-blown things, from clouds you step on, to the sled you ride on on one of the levels, to the gun you wield, to the main character.
2207560	2209040	And that's what I wanted to show you guys.
2209060	2215442	In the pictures that I've attached, I made one of OLR's and Jamie's favorite, a playable character, a cute pyramid head.
2216462	2220123	The pictures do speak for themselves, and I wish there was a way you could show the listeners as well.
2220504	2224305	Maybe point the Operator 11 camera at the computer screen or something.
2224485	2225605	Too late, Op 11 died.
2225805	2230226	But I thought it was pretty funny, especially when the townspeople said, Oh, Pyramid H, go to rescue little Miwa.
2230826	2235848	The whole time I pictured a pyramid head ripping said little girl to shreds with a giant meat cleaver, and that made me L.O.L.,
2236952	2239974	Anyways, I'll wrap this up and let you guys continue through the mailbag.
2240174	2241975	Take care and keep up the great work as usual.
2242575	2243336	Oh, that's cute.
2243416	2244536	Here's the little pyramid head.
2244677	2247978	I peeked in the mailbag as well to pull out the pictures.
2248439	2249099	That is cute.
2249820	2251881	And this is great radio, but maybe Footy.
2251901	2253762	I think Footy's in chat tonight, so maybe he can share.
2253802	2255203	Oh, yeah, he just posted his photo bucket there.
2255223	2255663	Thank you, Footy.
2255963	2256303	Thank you.
2256603	2257584	That was awesome radio.
2257644	2258965	By the way, pictures make for great radio.
2258985	2260626	That is the cutest thing ever.
2261426	2262027	Look at that.
2262707	2263808	Oh, my God, he's adorable.
2263888	2264308	I want one.
2265140	2266401	I want my own Pyramid Heddy.
2267501	2267921	P-Hiddy.
2268001	2268421	P-Hiddy.
2268541	2268941	P-Hiddy.
2269062	2270002	We call him P-Hiddy.
2271643	2272603	I'm going to look at the other picture.
2272703	2274284	Oh my god, he's so cute!
2275104	2275384	Okay.
2276544	2278605	So moving on.
2280446	2288629	So from Gray Fox, we have an email.
2289517	2290338	Hello, OLR gang.
2290358	2294401	I've been listening to your podcast for a couple months now and would like to say that I love your show.
2294481	2300446	I agree with many others who have commented that it is the hilarious interactions between all three of you that make this show unique.
2301227	2306591	I had about a four-year hiatus of gaming because of being enrolled in university and did not have much time for video games.
2307071	2311895	Now that I have graduated, I have more time to play, so I got myself a PS2 Slimline, and I'm loving it so far.
2312356	2319001	I was wondering if it were possible to have a section on the show dedicated to great last-gen games.
2319597	2328140	I find there are many people who cannot afford to get involved in the next gen gaming and there are still many great games, Metal Gear Solid series, God of War, Beautiful Joe, etc.
2328780	2335622	Right now I rely on IGN for my game recommendations but I am afraid that some games might still be great but get a lower score.
2335782	2337582	Any help would be great, keep up the good work.
2339063	2345245	I would suggest for good PS2 games, definitely the Metal Gear series.
2347791	2348292	I don't know, but...
2373029	2378033	As far as the last gen game goes, they're still making some good stuff for PlayStation 2.
2378433	2383737	Final Fantasy XII came out amongst all the new consoles and kind of got lost, but it's a freaking great RPG.
2384157	2390462	And I know a lot of folks in chat have been yapping about Persona 3, which is also supposed to be a really good one.
2390482	2391683	I still need to play the demo.
2391783	2393504	I've been busy.
2393744	2394064	Yeah, I know.
2394104	2397727	I want to play the full game at some point, but there's so many games out there to play right now.
2398514	2402456	So certainly PS2 still has a bunch of crack going out for it.
2402776	2406558	And I even want to go way back to some of the games that were released earlier on.
2406718	2411660	I still want to catch up on the .hack series because I actually enjoyed the games, the little bits I played of them.
2411700	2412960	There's just a lot to them.
2413320	2418222	So ironically enough, we talked about in Part 8 tonight, Jamie's going to have a Classic Game of the Week segment.
2418242	2421264	So maybe once in a while you can have a PS2 game or something in there.
2421304	2421964	Oh, you know what?
2421984	2424065	Space Channel 5.
2424105	2424525	Ooh, good times.
2424545	2426046	They did a double release of 1 and 2.
2427239	2427759	Amplitude, Frequency
2452275	2454897	Guitar Hero I am moving forward, prepare to fast forward
2472242	2475083	But the area I'm at, really awesome.
2475683	2477423	A few things I'd like to say if you don't mind.
2477503	2481964	Rob, I know you're not a big fan of anime, but I've heard you go on about how awesome Blue Dragon is.
2482284	2484765	In case you haven't heard, there's an anime based on the game now.
2484825	2485565	Here's my question.
2485945	2489606	If there was a game that you liked also had an anime to it, would you watch it as well?
2489766	2492427	Oh, and Jamie, I've seen the first episode, and it's pretty good.
2492487	2493127	It's a must-see.
2493367	2494567	I might have to download that then.
2495667	2502479	Um, I will say this, so far, sorry, I know the email's not done, but just to get that part out of the way, I don't think Blue Dragon is, like, OMG awesome.
2503602	2507683	Blue Dragon is better than a lot of people say it is, I think.
2507903	2511404	It's a Super Nintendo RPG with next-gen graphics.
2511444	2512324	That's what Blue Dragon is.
2512484	2513044	Take it or leave it.
2514564	2515544	Would I watch the anime?
2515565	2515865	Sure.
2516205	2517005	I've heard it's out there.
2517025	2518525	I think I've seen it on YouTube.
2518565	2519745	I just haven't sat down to watch it.
2520085	2523746	But I did watch an episode of Final Fantasy Unlimited just because I liked Final Fantasy.
2523846	2526127	Final Fantasy Unlimited was a very strange series.
2526567	2530928	I didn't watch the whole thing, but I will if I'm into it enough.
2530948	2532588	I still need to finish Death Note, okay?
2533605	2534866	Anyway, Rob, another question.
2534926	2536087	The New York chapter of the O.L.
2536127	2538129	Army wants to know if you're going to Digital Life.
2538749	2543073	I know you said you were thinking about it because you have a credit with JetBlue, but not much has been said.
2543113	2546035	Would love it if you came out to New York City again because we all love you.
2546615	2553000	I thought I'd clarified this on a previous show, but perhaps some folks were out or maybe I said it on an off-recorded break or something.
2553020	2556283	But unfortunately, due to a conflict, I cannot make it out there for Digital Life.
2556343	2557864	I'm very sorry to the New York folks.
2558291	2559032	However, you're right.
2559092	2562074	I still have that credit from JetBlue, and I've got to use it before June or it goes away.
2562134	2564476	So you bet you're going to see me out there in the spring for something.
2564956	2565317	So we'll see.
2565817	2566297	Okay.
2566798	2568159	Well, let me move forward.
2568219	2574184	And by the way, this email is from our Ron-chan in the chat room, who always makes me squee.
2575605	2579988	So moving forward, speaking of East Coast – oh, no, we've already done that one.
2581129	2581890	Wait, have I done that?
2581910	2582250	No, I haven't.
2582530	2586774	Speaking of the East Coast, Rob, you've jokingly said that if we fly OLR out to a con, you would all go.
2587409	2593517	I can't do that, but I can try to get you, Jamie, and Matt to discount some flights if you three can come to anime next to local con in Jersey.
2595820	2596981	He's offering us to stay.
2597001	2598503	Do you think we could make something like that?
2599659	2600439	Well, we'll consider.
2600520	2604822	We do have a resource we can tap into to maybe make that happen.
2605462	2607764	It would just be also, though, our personal calendars.
2608744	2610785	Don't forget, Orange Entretien, we don't get paid for doing this.
2610805	2611726	This isn't our jobs.
2611906	2612986	So we all have jobs.
2613066	2614247	And Jamie goes to school.
2614707	2615608	Loki's married.
2616308	2620210	So sometimes our personal lives keep us at home, not just so much the fact that we're poor.
2620531	2623372	But we do have a money resource we can tap into, and we appreciate the offer.
2624353	2625153	Here's the thing, though.
2626314	2628495	If we're going to go to a con and make that kind of trip for it,
2628925	2629945	I still love you, Ranma!
2649355	2650035	Okay, where was I?
2651657	2656940	Also, more good news, I've decided not to get a Wii now because my friends around me have one, including my own roommate.
2657360	2659422	I've decided to get an Xbox 360 instead.
2659882	2668227	Despite the three-year warranty Microsoft has given them, opting for the two-year replacement plan because I'd rather spend the extra cash to have it replaced the same day at my local Best Buy.
2668648	2672650	I'm planning to purchase it February 08 when they should have the 65mm chips in it.
2674910	2679034	Now that you all know I'm buying one, I'm really fickle about buying games.
2679134	2681536	I'd like each of you to recommend one game I should get.
2681936	2683757	But don't suggest Rumble Roses XX.
2683777	2686960	I'm already planning on buying that.
2688201	2689142	Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
2691824	2692765	Somebody's getting a text message.
2692785	2694046	That's probably sauce.
2694226	2695667	You can't text message break up.
2695687	2697028	That's probably sauce.
2697929	2698770	I'm sorry, what was the question?
2699170	2700231	Cheap Xbox 360 games?
2700331	2702553	Well, just an Xbox 360 game that you would suggest buying.
2703395	2704438	Blue Dragon, Enchanted Arms,
2710134	2711575	because Enchanted Arms also wasn't bad.
2711595	2713276	Enchanted Arms is like dirt cheap now.
2713696	2718018	Especially if you have a PlayStation 3, it's really dirt cheap.
2718058	2719759	If you want to try an RPG, opt for Enchanted Arms.
2719799	2721239	It's not as bad as people made it out to be.
2722240	2728583	If you can get through the first couple hours, which are a little rough, especially if it really starts to get into it, I don't think it was a bad game.
2728863	2729964	Again, it wasn't a great game.
2730004	2736447	I'm still waiting for the freaking great blow-your-hair-back RPG on the Xbox 360, which I'm hoping is Eternal Sonata.
2737566	2738507	But I shouldn't hold my breath.
2738747	2740708	Marvel Ultimate Alliance, that's all I have to say.
2740968	2742289	Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
2745711	2745951	Uno.
2746471	2746752	Anyway.
2747872	2749153	Yeah, don't forget the arcade, actually.
2749193	2753416	Dude, make sure that you get Castlevania.
2753696	2758999	That's also, it looks kind of, actually the double dragon is so funny because it's all high res.
2759319	2761180	And to me, it just doesn't look the same.
2761540	2762301	It's not as cool to me.
2763948	2764949	Okay, next part.
2765049	2766930	Oh, Jamie, I had my housewarming last night.
2767290	2768331	I didn't get any Guinness.
2768371	2768852	I'm sorry.
2768932	2769232	Tear.
2769572	2777237	But we did have other alcoholic beverages, and I did a 151 shot for you, which reminds me of how much I loved hanging out with you at Faname.
2777257	2777297	Aw.
2777938	2780680	I know I've said it several times already, but you truly made me feel at home.
2780800	2783962	I can't wait to come back out there, not to calm, but to relax and have a good time.
2783982	2784983	Oh, that's so sweet.
2785864	2787985	Well, definitely, you've got crashing space.
2789646	2790807	Definitely have crashing space.
2790867	2791447	I'm sorry, what?
2791648	2793109	I want us to come back out and hang out.
2793349	2793449	Oh.
2793888	2794448	That's cool.
2794568	2794829	Cool.
2795849	2798150	And, okay, I'm almost done with the email.
2798590	2801232	Speaking of fun times, all of OLR me is on notice.
2801372	2806455	I will be back for Fonamay 2009 Prayer Commitments for 08, and it will be OLRCon.
2806575	2809096	Two suites full of OLR fans just going insane.
2810016	2817921	Oh, and for the record, the fag, fancy articulate guy's comment from last week was made by my friend Patty, not by me, and she rocks hard.
2819221	2820682	Do you remember you commented on that, Rob?
2821640	2823482	I remember there was the fancy.
2823702	2824763	Articulate guys.
2825083	2825784	All right, whatever.
2827285	2827985	Yeah, it is starting to get warm.
2828005	2829186	I'm going to have to open the door pretty soon.
2829206	2830347	I believe that's it for now.
2831528	2835631	I had more topics to comment on, but I forgot what I was going to say about them.
2836071	2838133	But keep up the good work and don't stop believing.
2838253	2838974	Wink face.
2839814	2841836	DJ Ranma S, proud member of the LOL Army since 2003.
2841996	2843637	That was a long email.
2844558	2845219	Last email.
2845499	2845739	All right.
2846075	2848196	Hey, OLR, Nintendo Maniac 64 here.
2848316	2850458	For math class, I'm doing a survey-like thing.
2850818	2851518	It's very simple.
2851658	2857002	I need you to list your preference of which of the following game systems from one best to four worst.
2857582	2861144	The Wii, the 360, PlayStation 3, and the PC.
2861665	2863146	Emulators and ROMs do not count.
2864747	2866728	And then... Oh, he just wants to send an email.
2866868	2867488	Oh, never mind.
2867528	2868669	He's wanting us to do his poll.
2869069	2869770	Well, I'm curious.
2869830	2871050	What of the four do you think is best?
2871331	2871911	Oh, lordy.
2872011	2874413	I'm just setting myself up for fanboy backlash.
2874813	2874913	Um...
2877481	2884043	I'm going to go strictly in terms of based on what's available and what I play and where my time goes based on that.
2884083	2889444	Because our golden rule, we haven't said it a long time on this show, so let me reiterate the golden rule of gaming.
2890364	2893985	A console is only as good as the games that are on it.
2894325	2897506	So that being said, I would say the Xbox 360 is number one.
2898086	2899327	PC is number two.
2899887	2900807	Wii is number three.
2901724	2902884	PlayStation 3 is number four.
2903205	2904865	I agree with that.
2905005	2905666	But let me put this.
2906186	2915929	Honestly, based on the goal, again, based on the golden rule of gaming, like Xbox 360, PC, and Wii, well, I would say Xbox 360 and PC are really close to the top.
2916310	2918510	Wii down a little bit, but still near the top.
2918530	2919171	It's getting there.
2919351	2920331	Big gap.
2921512	2922752	And then PlayStation 3 at the bottom.
2923132	2927454	Well, being that I have a PS3 and have a bunch of games for it,
2928625	2931668	The only game I played on that one regularly was Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
2931928	2935893	And now that I have it on Xbox 360, I'm like, well, why?
2936433	2936934	What's the point?
2937254	2943902	I can actually play it and not have to shake my controller around like an idiot and look like I'm having a seizure trying to do the underwater level.
2944322	2944903	So screw it.
2946519	2948981	You know you don't need to flail your arms around a lot.
2949041	2950282	You can just do it with your wrist.
2950322	2951002	She likes to flail.
2951022	2952903	I don't know, but I hate it.
2953143	2954644	Loki, what would be your list?
2956386	2957426	I don't know about PC.
2957506	2959347	I mean, I don't play a lot of PC stuff.
2959408	2965151	So I would say probably, well, 360 because there's just a lot of games on it.
2967033	2968033	Wii is hard.
2968093	2971776	I mean, there's a lot of games out there, but I don't play it a lot.
2971896	2973637	So actually, I would say probably...
2974875	2978038	And I don't want to put the PlayStation... I guess I'd say the same list as you, Rob.
2978258	2983363	But the thing is, you know, I don't play a lot of PC games because my computer sucks.
2983483	2983744	And then...
2984912	2987675	PC Gaming PC Gaming PC Gaming PC Gaming
3008233	3010474	Big time sink games for me.
3010955	3014257	When he added up, I actually probably do more gaming on the PC than anywhere else.
3014517	3019079	I'm surprised, though, Mac wasn't number one on there because I would have thought that Mac would be on there.
3019660	3020060	Oh, that's right.
3020080	3021140	It wasn't one of the options.
3021220	3021981	My mistake.
3022241	3022761	Oh, shut up.
3022781	3023201	No games.
3023602	3024142	Shut up.
3024282	3024562	All right.
3024882	3026623	Any more to that email, DarkSakra?
3026743	3027564	That's it for the mailbag.
3028084	3028304	All right.
3028364	3031386	If you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
3033287	3034468	Until then, more news.
3034688	3035068	Right, Logie?
3036131	3038333	Yeah, of course I have tons of news for you.
3038753	3046019	Anyways, so yeah, there's... I'm pulling up different stories now.
3046700	3056247	Anyways, there's some interesting rumors going around about the Metal Gear Solid movie, one of which is that Christian Bale is up for the role for Solid Snake himself.
3056988	3058749	So that'd be pretty interesting.
3058769	3061451	I guess it's from...
3063087	3092676	UK magazine called Nuts which I'm not really sure if I would I don't know how that would really rate there but they say he's in the running to play Salt Snake for the 2009 movie Metal Gear Solid and of course I don't know that's a big fat rumor I think I don't know I don't know if he'd look good as Snake though can't see him as Snake
3093868	3096510	They need someone who's a lot more hardcore.
3096750	3098191	Well, if Tom Selleck were younger.
3099391	3100492	No, no, no, no, no.
3100832	3102653	If Kurt Russell were younger.
3102673	3103654	Kurt Russell, yeah.
3104214	3105054	I like Kurt Russell.
3105115	3106335	Kurt Russell would be able to do it.
3106695	3107516	He could play Old Snake.
3108336	3109437	Or even Richard Dean Anderson.
3110698	3111018	Yeah.
3111118	3118082	Do you saw him in... No, I'm thinking of two people who played the same character in Stargate.
3119963	3120263	Maybe.
3121784	3122104	I don't know.
3122945	3123205	All right.
3123883	3124563	I love Stargate.
3124823	3125124	Anyway.
3151094	3151474	Not really.
3151774	3157716	But they'll just kind of be using the PlayStation branding to try and launch a possible... I'm sorry.
3157976	3159376	There is not a gaming phone.
3159416	3159936	I should say this.
3159956	3162497	There's no PSP phone slash thing or whatever.
3162897	3172139	But since Ericsson and PlayStation are under the same corporate entity, Sony, why not explore the possibilities of what could happen?
3173519	3173939	So there you go.
3174039	3176920	They need to just bring out the freaking Vodafones over here and leave it at that.
3178380	3178580	Well...
3179062	3180043	I'm getting a Blackberry.
3180063	3181744	I think it's going to be revised so many times.
3182464	3183305	I'm getting a Blackberry.
3183325	3183945	I'm getting a Blackberry.
3183985	3184106	I am.
3203519	3214608	Well, for anyone who is interested in interesting ways of announcing games or hinting at games or starting weirdo rumors anyway.
3215929	3226378	For the demo for Tony Hawk Proving Ground, there is a poster that shows a sequel for Gun Magruder's Ghost.
3228219	3229140	So, is it a rumor?
3229240	3229840	Is it a tease?
3229880	3230921	Is it wishful thinking?
3231201	3233043	Is it someone just trying to make it funny?
3234042	3237544	and Madden and what not.
3259620	3263664	Anyways, this is kind of a little 180 of normal news.
3264084	3269269	Conan, the game that was supposed to be coming out at the end of October, got bumped up into September.
3269389	3274494	In fact, now it's coming out the week of September 28th to compete with Halo.
3274635	3275155	Hooray!
3275215	3282082	That's not the smartest move, but it's nice to see that the game's actually going to be coming out earlier than expected.
3283011	3287133	It is going to be kind of a hack and slash action game.
3287653	3288713	Similar to God of War.
3288773	3289634	Lots of blood.
3289674	3291114	I know there's full frontal nudity.
3291174	3293295	So, hey, that's got two things that I need.
3293415	3296376	And that's probably going to guarantee a sale.
3296456	3296796	I don't know.
3297737	3299317	We don't get enough games with nudity.
3299917	3301198	We need more games with nudity.
3301258	3302158	Damn straight.
3302318	3304699	That aren't like niche nudity games.
3305279	3306540	Manhunt 2 is supposed to have lots.
3306760	3308221	There's a whole S&M club, I guess.
3308981	3311102	Like Playboy Mansion or whatever.
3311122	3312042	That's niche nudity.
3312472	3315325	I want like, you know, hardcore nudity in mainstream games.
3317469	3319530	Is that too much to ask for?
3320191	3322032	BMX XXX was great.
3322152	3322853	It was an awesome game.
3322893	3323933	That was a bad game, though.
3323973	3325535	I know, but it's... It was not a bad game.
3325655	3326395	It was fun.
3326455	3334200	It was, like, Dave mirrored his BMX, and it just had, like, weird shit, like, you know, impress a dog so it gets horny and fucks another dog.
3334541	3337363	I mean, just weird shit, but it was just excuses for you to do tricks and stuff.
3337403	3338563	And you had to pick up the hooker.
3338804	3339444	And pick up the hookers.
3339484	3340905	I mean, it's a fun game.
3341085	3342186	It's really weird...
3342926	3344566	It's like a game that makes fun of itself.
3344586	3347207	You know what really weird game I want them to make a new one of?
3347227	3347567	Jumping Flash.
3369625	3374648	Okay, now Leo Kristoff in chat says, why do you want to pay for CGI porn?
3374668	3377509	And RossTLUT says, Sky, fuck no, I don't want porn games really.
3378029	3379550	I said, I don't want porn games.
3379590	3383612	I just want random nudity inserted into video games.
3384312	3389815	It's like when you watch a movie and then you're watching the movie and you're like, oh, I didn't know I'd get that ass shot.
3390876	3391716	Life of Brian.
3392156	3396619	Where he comes out fully naked and addresses the crowd.
3396739	3397399	Where is that?
3400736	3406742	It's tasteful, artistic purposes, because games are art, after all.
3406782	3408784	We need random occurrences of naked.
3411746	3413668	Of course, I hope you guys know I'm half kidding.
3413688	3414929	And no ferret bestiality.
3415029	3417652	Oh my god, DT, what the hell are you on?
3417932	3419393	I'm half kidding, chat room.
3419914	3420515	I hope you guys know.
3421226	3429812	But there is no kidding around that PC is getting a new game called Stranglehold, which of course is coming to all the consoles as well.
3430693	3437058	But Stranglehold is coming out this week on the consoles, but if you want to check out a demo, it's up now.
3437758	3443142	The game ships on September 18th, but the PC demo is available to download right now.
3444103	3450728	So if you want to check that out, go to your favorite downloading site, such as, you know, I don't know,
3451411	3451871	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3480797	3483638	and it's just so funny the way they're advertising the game to me.
3483678	3487258	It's like, more stuff to blow up than any game ever.
3488239	3489679	It just, I don't know, it made me laugh.
3491019	3494760	You know what, that would be the whole reason I would buy a game is explosions.
3495920	3501301	Well, speaking of things that aren't exploding, however, you can probably get some neat pyrotechnics included.
3502661	3509023	More information about Guitar Hero 3 Legends of Rock will be coming out on the PC and the Mac.
3509323	3510403	Games on a Mac!
3511383	3512764	Like Snakes on a Plane, but not really.
3514464	3534014	It will have the same gameplay, same content as the console versions, unlockable, multiplayer mode, boss battles, I do believe downloadable content, which would make sense, and it's Guitar Hero...
3535512	3540496	And it'll be cracked so wide open that it'll be freely available before you know it.
3540817	3545561	Well, it's not that, but I'm waiting for people to crack this game to insert their own shit into it.
3545741	3550225	It's been done on PlayStation 2 and stuff, so... It's only a matter of time upon this release.
3550245	3552727	I've seen PlayStation 2 ones done with Metroid Metal music.
3554468	3562055	And I just want to say, though, shortly after the release of this game is when America's going to realize that we're just oversaturated with Guitar Hero crap and...
3562725	3564586	I think the series will start to decline.
3564686	3565286	Just about.
3565646	3566406	Just like DDR.
3567627	3568087	We'll see.
3568147	3568507	We'll see.
3569528	3569888	Anyways.
3571509	3574950	So... And then my... There we go.
3574970	3579732	Nintendo made an x64 mention that there's already something like that on PC called Fretz on Fire.
3580332	3581793	And maybe that's why they want to do this.
3582013	3584574	You know, because they realize there is a market for the PC guitars.
3584614	3584894	Who knows?
3585310	3586791	Yeah, that's how we get, like, in the groove.
3587151	3587412	Yay.
3588712	3591875	So, GameStop, once again, we're talking about them.
3592035	3595877	Now they're planning on catering to the casual gamer.
3597058	3597459	Yay.
3598159	3603683	Apparently, they're going to be redesigning their stores or rearranging them, kind of as a test.
3603963	3609567	What they're going to do is they're going to have a couple new sections, including one dedicated to the children's and family games.
3610388	3614471	Another section is going to be dedicated to, I guess...
3615586	3617728	New reason to go to GameStop?
3617748	3618029	Probably not.
3639474	3646719	I had to go to Fry's today, an electronics store nearby that's pretty big, because none of the GameStops within a 111 mile radius had any PSP cables.
3661994	3662314	Awesome.
3662334	3662714	Not cool.
3663815	3665756	Yeah, you can still go to GameCrazy and buy Genesis.
3665796	3667077	There are options, folks.
3667157	3669298	Don't need to necessarily go to GameStop.
3669398	3670579	And also think about this.
3671599	3675721	Remember, I bought the collector's edition of Bioshock so I can get the Big Daddy.
3677042	3680124	Would I really have missed it if I didn't buy the collector's edition?
3680344	3681264	Probably not.
3681805	3687688	So, don't be fooled in buying this shit for crappy little trinkets that you probably don't need anyways.
3687948	3689409	GameCrazy needs your money.
3690369	3691390	That's all I'm going to say.
3692541	3693682	Yeah, they need a lot of money.
3693782	3695103	They need a whole lot of money.
3696404	3696744	Anyway.
3697745	3698065	Alright.
3698645	3700427	Well, is that it for the news tonight?
3700507	3701027	I think it is.
3701047	3701788	I think so.
3701948	3705430	So this is where we open up the Skype line and let you guys interact with our program.
3705450	3707511	If you want to give us a call, our phone number is 1-877-GAMEOLR.
3710109	3715332	or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio and Skype line is open and you guys can give us a call.
3716573	3717513	So we'll wait for some calls.
3717553	3719655	I don't know, our listenership seems to be down a little bit tonight.
3719675	3723917	I don't know if that's the Emmys to thank for that or back to school or the fact that our show just sucks.
3724077	3728300	I don't know what it is, but we don't have a lot of live listeners as much as usual tonight.
3728360	3733703	So I'm hoping that we get some calls at some point, but the line is open.
3733943	3735244	So go ahead and start calling.
3735604	3737245	In the meantime, do we have any last minute stories?
3737745	3739206	Oh yeah.
3739226	3739266	Um,
3739673	3742795	Let's see, let's start off here, of course, Colin McRae.
3743316	3744997	He's died in a helicopter crash.
3745537	3752062	You may remember him from such rally racing events that have happened, of course, in Europe.
3752702	3760648	And also because he's had his name on various rally racing games, including Dirt, which is actually pretty awesome.
3760748	3763190	But unfortunately, he has passed away.
3764530	3765771	Let's see, also...
3767403	3773447	I was gonna say that China, this is funny, China's gaming companies are trying to combat piracy.
3774668	3777791	I don't know if that gets you to laugh, I don't know what will, so.
3778771	3779252	Okay.
3779712	3782354	Well, I mean, China is just...
3783513	3785695	Big on, you know, a ton of piracy stuff coming out there.
3785715	3787216	Yeah, but that's, you know, that's a scene.
3787256	3791840	You can't, you know, label everybody as, you know, participating in the piracy rings.
3791880	3792481	All right, fine.
3792701	3792961	All right.
3793762	3794582	We've got calls on Skype.
3794602	3795043	Let's go to that.
3795083	3796064	We'll get the rest of your stories in a minute.
3796324	3797445	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3797485	3798045	Caller, are you there?
3799086	3801408	Yes, I am, and it's not Raven's Dolphin.
3801788	3802529	Well, who is it then?
3803530	3808874	It's DJ Ranma S. Well, hello, DJ Ranma S. So somebody different got through first for once this week.
3808934	3809755	All right, what's on your mind, buddy?
3810734	3811274	Not much.
3811755	3820342	I want to make a comment about the whole GameStop thing about the manager who got basically suspended for only selling games to smart people.
3821022	3831771	I can't say I don't blame him for doing that because I used to work in a video store and the video store was like right by the schools and they would come in all the time and mess the place up.
3831831	3834673	And then we started doing stuff like that.
3834693	3840017	We started doing like a program where if you had good grades, you get free rentals and stuff.
3840444	3847070	We were basically like a mom and pop store and we basically knew the families and stuff like that would come in all the time.
3847850	3853815	And we, you know, we basically knew if you weren't doing too well in school and stuff, you weren't renting games at all.
3853855	3854476	Simple as that.
3857358	3858399	Well, I'm sorry.
3858419	3859320	I was typing in chat.
3859460	3859660	What?
3861541	3861762	Sorry.
3862022	3862782	Everybody's like, I'm sorry.
3862802	3863043	What?
3863123	3864084	Restate your question real quick.
3865365	3868047	What I said was I used to work at a mom and pop store.
3868067	3869328	We basically did the same thing.
3869388	3869488	What?
3869790	3870671	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3891246	3898749	We knew, the parents knew, basically knew they weren't doing their homework because they were too busy mulling around in our store checking out the games and stuff like that.
3898789	3910593	We had to like kick them out from time to time and just like, you know, it's like 3, 3, 4 o'clock, you've been here over an hour, you should be at home doing your homework instead of drooling over the games that you want to buy or rent, simple as that.
3910653	3910753	Wow.
3911325	3934571	You know, I don't have a problem with people kicking out loiters, but, I mean, I don't think it's a great business practice to turn away business, especially when most of the mom-and-pop stores I talk to on a daily basis are having trouble selling games, let alone, you know, they're not, like, swimming in money, so I wouldn't, I would highly, you know, advise against it, despite how tempting it may be.
3936072	3938732	Mystic Gohan says, what if my homework is to play a game?
3938752	3940813	Hmm.
3941288	3942028	That was from our chat.
3942649	3944530	So that went over okay?
3944570	3945850	There wasn't a lot of controversy there?
3947131	3948772	No, not at all, you know.
3949252	3954295	Like I said, we were supposed to, everybody knew each other, and it was pretty cool about it, you know.
3955415	3963639	And, I mean, overall, I don't blame this manager for doing it, but it's not his job to be the parent of all these kids, you know.
3965340	3968862	I mean, these parents should be more responsible and stuff like that, you know.
3969654	3970575	That's the way I see it.
3971275	3975597	Overall, I give them points for doing that, but not at the risk of your job, you know?
3977277	3977558	All right.
3978398	3982960	Well, thank you for the insight, I guess, from having been working for a game store that used to kind of do this.
3983340	3984721	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
3985881	3987842	No, that's just, I just want to throw my two cents about that.
3987882	3988462	That's all.
3988582	3989223	Well, I appreciate it.
3989243	3990243	I'm sorry I missed you the first time.
3990263	3994345	I thought someone else was listening and I was trying to work on a question that got asked in chat.
3994485	3996626	So I didn't want you to feel like I was ignoring you.
3996686	3997066	I'm sorry.
3997406	3998907	We multitask while doing the show.
4000080	4000661	I know that feeling.
4001141	4001961	Take care, buddy.
4002862	4003162	You too.
4003443	4003623	Bye-bye.
4022805	4028409	Funny enough, if you purchase it through Best Buy, you get three hidden tracks.
4028869	4031271	Well, actually, anybody can get the hidden tracks.
4031391	4035133	And funny enough, it's the Konami code which unlocks those hidden tracks.
4035573	4038555	Despite the fact that the game is actually being made by Ubisoft.
4038615	4045220	So, to unlock Brad Paisley, I'm Gonna Miss Her, Jimi Hendrix, Wild Thing, and Tom Petty, Needles and Pins...
4045960	4051906	Simply push up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, during free mode, and it will give you those three songs.
4051926	4052687	Wait, and what game is this?
4053168	4053928	Jam Sessions.
4054629	4056671	Isn't this a game that some of our listeners told you to stay away from?
4056851	4057092	Yeah.
4057352	4057712	Oh, okay.
4057732	4059274	All right, well, let's go to the phones.
4059354	4060355	We've got another call coming in.
4060395	4061356	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4061376	4061736	Who's this?
4063158	4063898	This is Jason.
4064098	4064819	Hi, Jason.
4064839	4067081	We do need a new jumping flash now.
4067442	4068143	A new jumping flash.
4068163	4068463	Amen.
4069908	4073630	Oh man, Jamie said that and I smiled so big.
4074010	4095761	Jumping Flash was my first ever PlayStation game back when Blockbuster still rented out the systems and I paid the $150 deposit and I rented the system along with Jumping Flash and Revolution X. Revolution X was awful at home though.
4097143	4100046	I think that was when I actually owned it.
4125498	4129383	I was a freshman in college and my roommate's boyfriend had a Playstation but my friend had imported a Saturn
4143033	4144074	Hire CDs for whaling bonus
4169003	4169804	Golden Axe The Duel
4197844	4199305	I didn't even know they made that game on Saturn.
4199506	4201127	Oh yeah, it was actually a good game.
4202228	4205891	I only remember two or three things about the Saturn.
4206612	4212938	One of them was a friend of mine with the extra memory chip or something like that.
4212998	4215320	Something along those lines, some kind of an expansion chip.
4216261	4219544	Knights and some weird mech game that I played at.
4220473	4222233	Oh, I don't even remember where it was anymore.
4222253	4228075	I think it was at Hastings or something like that on one of their demo kiosks, but I next to no idea what it is anymore.
4228675	4230955	Saturn was the machine you had if you were an importer, though.
4231335	4236796	Because you had arcade-perfect copies of Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighters, X-Men vs. Street Fighter.
4238617	4243038	You had all the King of Fighters games, even though the load time was just completely ridiculous.
4243618	4244498	Virtual Lawn.
4246078	4247879	Ready for the beginning, CD systems.
4248479	4248759	Kind of.
4249671	4252112	Sonic 3 didn't crash horribly.
4254574	4259876	Yeah, and RawSteelUT points out that all the Working Designs games came out for Saturn, like the Rayearth RPG.
4260917	4265779	They actually did get games for the Sega CD.
4265819	4269001	We had Popful Mail over here from Working Designs.
4270329	4270869	Oh, of course.
4270930	4273331	Thank you to the people that did own the Saturn.
4273351	4278033	The notion that that was the importer's console, yes, that was very true now that I think about it.
4289150	4294713	It's funny, Dan and I used to hook up our Saturn and our PlayStation and have the same games in them.
4294933	4297515	Because we actually had a few of the games that were the same on both systems.
4297855	4299396	And we would compare what they looked like.
4299936	4303798	And the Saturn was it for anything that was 2D or required a lot of memory.
4304619	4307480	Even though the PlayStation was built for 3D.
4307540	4312243	We compared Symphony of the Night, because I have the Japanese one on the Saturn.
4313157	4324800	and all the 3D effects looked a lot better on the PlayStation, of course, but all of the sprites and the music was better on the Saturn because I think the Saturn had a better sound processor.
4325641	4329762	The music being better was really common to pretty much every game on the Saturn, wasn't it?
4330422	4331302	I think so.
4331742	4333823	I do remember hearing something along those lines.
4334083	4341905	They did have a lot of games, too, that were Redbook and also other games that were pointed out were Guardian Heroes, Panzer Dragoon, Sonic Jam, Silhouette Mirage.
4342563	4369078	Dragon Force Sonic Jam, yes, that one is a very big deal I remember my girlfriend really complaining about Sonic Jam's collection of the fact that they used the Sega CD version of Sonic Jam instead of the Saturn version because the Saturn version actually had the true epic music composed to not just a synthesized MIDI-ish sound
4369788	4374653	And that's, yes, the world of difference right there.
4376395	4378617	Wow, that's like a trip down memory lane here.
4378637	4385123	Well, also, for me being an importer, I actually lucked into a copy of Grandia on Saturn.
4386184	4389447	And comparing that to the PlayStation 1, oh my god.
4389788	4391189	The PlayStation 1 was crap.
4391289	4393011	Even the 3D was crap in it.
4393883	4396165	and it was so much better on Saturn.
4396545	4401689	Music, you actually had a bigger view field so you could see more stuff that was going on in the game.
4402230	4403410	The timing was better.
4403871	4406913	Everything came out so much better on the Saturn version.
4407193	4410236	All right, Sega fanboys, we've got to wrap up and go to another call.
4410296	4412938	Jason, any last thoughts quickly before we move on?
4414659	4419903	Bust a Move Bash with the Wii controller is absolutely amazing.
4420640	4422003	It makes so much sense.
4422144	4423266	It plays so well.
4423366	4425010	It is very, very fun.
4425170	4425611	What game?
4426995	4427917	Bust a Move Bash.
4428017	4429600	It's like a puzzle game where you can play up to...
4431328	4432529	8 players at one time.
4432589	4436791	My mind went to the old dance game and I was like, there's a fucking new bus to move out?
4437231	4438552	I know it would have.
4438652	4442233	I should have said Puzzle Bobble Bash because it would make more sense to you pretty much immediately.
4442333	4442914	No, that's alright.
4442934	4447476	But the move bash for the Wiimote control is so intuitive.
4447596	4449357	It is so easy to pick up and play.
4449377	4450197	It is so fun.
4450477	4450797	Really?
4451017	4451978	I might have to check it out.
4452038	4452218	Yes.
4452939	4456141	Rinse it, buy it, pretty cheap, give it a shot.
4456281	4456721	It's fun.
4456901	4461064	Even though I've played this game like 50 times, this will be worth it, right?
4462064	4463325	You might want to play it on mute.
4463525	4465226	I'll warn you that.
4465626	4468147	Well, maybe I can use my custom soundtracks with the Winamp.
4468267	4468688	Hopefully.
4468788	4469148	We'll see.
4470168	4471209	Oh, yeah, that's true, huh?
4471389	4471709	Who knows?
4471929	4472770	I haven't gotten up yet.
4472830	4473250	I need to.
4473770	4475751	All right, Jason, we've got to let you go, but have a good one, okay, buddy?
4476832	4477132	You too.
4477372	4478053	All right, bye-bye.
4478653	4479433	Night.
4479453	4482195	We always like hearing from Jason, our fearless webmaster.
4483206	4484346	for OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
4484366	4488688	We'll probably take one more call, then we're going to call it a night because we are running a little bit long tonight.
4488708	4490069	I don't know what's going on with that.
4490129	4492910	Another last-minute story real quick, Loki, if you have any more.
4493490	4493690	Yeah.
4493810	4494230	Do you have any?
4495111	4495911	I have a whole ton.
4496531	4499452	Anyways, they were talking a little bit bizarre.
4499472	4502514	They were talking about Project Gotham Racing 5 and what they want to do with that.
4503434	4509676	One thing that they're looking to do is possibly off-road stuff, including quad bikes and off-road tracks.
4510557	4511217	So that's kind of neat.
4512077	4514879	GS68 Yeah, you know that thing about the New Jersey parents reacting to the Wii Zapper?
4515580	4516321	Yeah, I was particularly offended.
4516521	4518442	I mean, for fuck's sake, I grew up with light gun games.
4519323	4519483	Yeah.
4538280	4538520	No.
4539101	4548329	You know, and I wonder, like, at the carnivals, like, even before the days of video games, I mean, they still have this at, like, the county fairs and the state fairs and the various carnivals around.
4548589	4556756	Don't they have those BB gun shooting games where you shoot pellets, as many pellets as you can, through the little silhouette, and if you can, like, punch out the star completely, you get a prize?
4556776	4558117	They have better than that now.
4558517	4560639	They have shoot the paintballs at the man thing.
4561019	4561359	Cool.
4561399	4564182	They have a guy in riot gear, and you can shoot him with paintballs.
4564622	4564922	Wow.
4565303	4571106	And don't they have, um, they also have, uh, shooting, like, you know, remember, like, that fucking thing they have at Scandia?
4571366	4577210	That's like that whole elaborate setup with, like, the Wild West, you can shoot, like... I think you have one of those at Tilt.
4577610	4582333	Okay, so, anyway, I mean, yeah, these types of games existed long before, uh, video games.
4582754	4586316	So these are just a couple of dumbasses who somehow got their name in the media.
4586336	4586436	Yeah.
4587396	4589076	And don't get me started with Nerf guns.
4589196	4592057	I mean, they're obviously for kids, and they shoot real projectiles.
4592337	4593357	Or Super Soaker.
4593377	4595558	I keep thinking of that one commercial that's all over YouTube.
4595598	4599418	Yeah, because it was a warrior that says not to shoot someone in the face with it.
4600159	4600399	Anyway.
4600519	4602339	I like getting Super Soakers and putting ink in them.
4603299	4604059	Why would you do that?
4604099	4604419	That's mean.
4604459	4606780	We used to when I was in middle school.
4606840	4607720	Why would you do that?
4607880	4608880	Because we were mean.
4609640	4610661	You were a bad child.
4611301	4612041	I just take it back.
4612641	4612721	Ugh.
4613891	4615952	Well, yeah, I agree with you, GS68.
4615972	4617633	These people are dumbasses, but what can you do?
4618013	4619554	In every village, there's an idiot, right?
4620675	4620875	Yeah.
4622476	4624297	Well, any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?
4625597	4626778	I don't think so.
4627298	4627578	All right.
4627879	4628799	Well, thank you for your rant.
4629099	4631160	We appreciate it, and it fits in well with our program.
4631961	4632421	No problem.
4632521	4632801	All right.
4633141	4633762	Bye-bye, dude.
4634642	4634802	Yeah.
4635863	4636163	All right.
4636581	4638542	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
4638822	4640143	Thank you to those that got through.
4640263	4641123	Sorry to those that didn't.
4641703	4655209	The new Skype is so weird because I can't, like, if five calls are coming in at once, I have to hang up on four to answer the one, and then the people that I hung up on will try to call right back.
4655370	4656330	So I can never pick up a call.
4656610	4659471	So now I have to force the calls to go to voicemail if we're already in a call.
4659772	4664394	But then, like, it's, you know, the people that keep, like, calling back in seem to get, like, right through.
4664434	4664974	It's really weird.
4666035	4666496	But I don't know.
4666836	4667236	We'll see.
4667256	4668336	We'll see what we can do with Skype.
4668376	4670597	I just want the old version back.
4671038	4671818	Sorry, last minute news.
4672178	4678961	To go back to what we were talking about earlier, Eternal Sonata has definitely been confirmed for the PlayStation 3.
4679202	4682303	In fact, it will be shown at Tokyo Game Show in video form only.
4682723	4692568	And there's actually some updates on what the PlayStation 3 will have that the Xbox 360 one won't, including new playable characters and a new clothing system in the works.
4693331	4694052	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4716890	4720632	Accompanying this is an increase in costume variations.
4720672	4726616	Unfortunately, PlayStation 3 owners will have to wait until 2008 to get their hands on this RPG update.
4727676	4728877	So that was kind of funny.
4729797	4732379	And some other things real quick.
4732579	4736021	Hot Shots Golf Online is coming out on PSP.
4736961	4740043	And that's another thing that's going to be shown at Tokyo Game Show.
4740443	4745586	As well as there's going to be a free online RPG coming to the PlayStation 3 from Q Entertainment.
4746343	4747404	That is interesting.
4748104	4752487	I guess it's going to be... Oh, God, I hope that's not the actual... Oh, no.
4752868	4755530	It's the one we were talking about before, Angel Love Online.
4755570	4760073	I think it's the one where you have to have sex with people and you get impregnated or something.
4760093	4761033	What?
4761254	4761874	There was one, though.
4761894	4762434	I saw it on Kotaku.
4762454	4763235	From Q Entertainment?
4763295	4763535	No.
4763915	4765216	No, there's something else.
4765336	4775043	Angel Love Online is what it's called, but I swear to God, I thought there was something that you had to impregnate women or something, and then you created new characters based off that or something.
4775063	4775924	Yeah.
4776608	4778050	Crisis Core is not the last Final Fantasy 7 game.
4794172	4796914	I can only hope that Crisis Core is the last Final Fantasy 7 game.
4796934	4798475	There's way too damn many.
4798695	4803739	You know, a Kingdom Hearts 0 would make a lot of sense because the creators come out and said the next game is not Kingdom Hearts 3.
4804279	4805821	That would be a cute little trick to play.
4806321	4807462	That it's actually Kingdom Hearts 0.
4808122	4808923	But here's the thing.
4809103	4814627	If it doesn't have the Disney tie-in this time, like if that's their way to not have Disney tie-ins this time, I'm not buying it.
4814967	4816889	I'm sorry, but the Disney tie-ins make that game.
4817229	4817389	Yeah.
4818529	4847412	and then the other thing this is kind of going to DDR Universe apparently if you were one of those people that downloaded the download content for Universe 1 it will not be compatible with Universe 2 unlike the Ultra Mix series where all your download content was transferable to each additional game so sucks if you downloaded that one thing that they had so that's interesting well
4847933	4849394	I think this is kind of cool.
4849414	4851216	Something I wouldn't mind looking forward to.
4852097	4860403	Actually, the developer that brought us R-Type, Irem, they're bringing out SteamBot 2 on PS3 for anyone who's interested.
4860744	4863426	Over in Japan, it's Bumpy Trot.
4863766	4869211	But it's a non-linear action-adventure game.
4869991	4872693	And there's a comparison made between GTA and Harvest Moon.
4873914	4874915	So I think that'd be pretty cool.
4875636	4875756	Yeah.
4877221	4878722	GTA meets Harvest Moon.
4878742	4879302	That's awesome.
4881444	4884306	Milk my cow, now die!
4885607	4886988	It's not that good of a game.
4887108	4887568	Trust me.
4887729	4888489	That would be awesome.
4890210	4892552	Grand Theft Farmer.
4892612	4894754	That's not quite.
4896255	4897756	That's it.
4897796	4901599	If that's it for the last minute stories, then that means it's time to wrap up this damn show.
4902059	4903981	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
4905001	4906261	I'll start off with Loki tonight.
4906301	4907242	Loki, what's your final thought?
4907442	4910903	My final thought is I don't want to see the next Resident Evil movie.
4912263	4916525	My final thought is I am craving a Marie Callender's pie right now.
4916545	4918225	I want pie so bad it hurts.
4918865	4922867	I had to buy a pie for a potluck and then we left before we even got to dessert.
4923167	4925268	So my poor pie, I had to leave.
4926448	4927208	Poor baby.
4927508	4928148	I know, poor me.
4929229	4930309	DarkSakura, your final thought?
4930989	4932730	I have to wake up at four in the morning.
4934301	4939644	because I have to be at work at 6 so that I can leave at 10 and go to a dentist appointment.
4941264	4944206	Fortunately for me, it's just a routine cleaning and I always fall asleep.
4945446	4946387	And then I get to go home.
4946587	4947087	Lucky you.
4947748	4954291	It's because these very comfortable chairs at my dentist's office and they're cushy and they're completely ergonomic.
4954771	4956552	So when you're laying in them, you're not like,
4957102	4958142	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4983425	4984726	and letting us know you care.
4985327	4989531	That keeps us going from week to week for almost 250 shows now, if you can believe it.
4991512	4992634	But that's going to do it for this week.
4992674	4998839	Remember, if you like our show, all we ask, tell two people you know about the show, because if everybody tells two people, then slowly we take over the world.
4999400	5002963	Or if you have no friends, which would be sad, and I'm sorry for one.
5003257	5004618	but if you have no friends you can tell about the show.
5004638	5005779	Tell your imaginary friends.
5006179	5009861	Leave us a review on iTunes, a positive review on iTunes or any other type of site.
