0	5800	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5800	11800	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com
11800	15300	for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15300	20300	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20300	27300	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Part B of our podcast for this September the 16th of 2007.
27300	30300	And of course remember as always, Orange Lounge Radio is released in two parts.
30300	33800	So if you haven't heard tonight's Part A, you're only here in half the show.
33800	38300	So head on over to orangeloungeradio.com for more information on how to download our show
38300	40300	and catch up on everything that you've missed.
40300	43300	But for now, Loki's going to take us right back into the gaming news.
43300	44300	I am?
44300	45300	You are.
45300	46300	Okay, I am.
46300	47300	Just kidding.
47300	53300	Anyways, so there was a game that we saw a couple years back when they were first showing off the Wii.
53300	54300	And it was kind of neat.
54300	58300	I thought the title was retarded, but whatever.
58300	61300	So there's this game, Project Hammer.
61300	65300	And while people were speculating, is it on hold?
65300	66300	What's going on?
66300	68300	Well, according to Famitsu, it's been cancelled.
68300	71300	And it's not coming back.
71300	77300	So that's too bad because who doesn't like hitting people with a giant cybernetic hammer?
77300	81300	Yeah, I remember the game seemed alright at E3 in the demos.
81300	85300	It was there the first year the Wii was there, last year in 06.
85300	86300	It wasn't that long ago.
86300	87300	Yeah, I'm surprised.
87300	89300	The last big E3 or whatever you want to call it.
89300	92300	I'm surprised that it looked cool.
92300	94300	I don't know why they wouldn't put it out.
94300	96300	Or just some other company put it out.
96300	97300	Seriously.
97300	98300	It wasn't bad.
98300	101300	It's better than DK Bongo Blast.
101300	102300	I wonder why they ended up canceling it.
102300	103300	I wonder what we're going to get instead.
103300	109300	Because sometimes when these games get cancelled, something else comes out instead that makes it kind of worth the wait.
109300	113300	They should have the Project Hammer guy in Super Smash Brothers. That'd be hilarious.
113300	120300	Didn't they say at game developers conferences this year that Peekman was the result of something else?
120300	122300	It was the result of Mario's...
122300	125300	Yeah, it was a Mario concept ended up being the Peekman game.
125300	127300	So you never know what might happen.
127300	129300	Frisbee asked a good question in chat.
129300	132300	Whatever happened to that game's sadness?
132300	133300	It's still being worked on.
133300	134300	Is it?
134300	135300	As far as I'm aware.
135300	136300	Alright, we'll see.
136300	139300	Now this is pretty cool. Some new information about the Wii.
139300	142300	And I know this will make Dark Sakura all kinds of excited.
142300	149300	It has been announced that TurboGrafx-16 CD games are on their way to Wii Virtual Console.
149300	153300	And I believe some of the earlier titles were announced.
153300	157300	I have not seen... I don't remember what was on the early list.
157300	160300	Sadly, the Dracula game you love, Jamie, wasn't on there.
160300	161300	I do remember.
161300	163300	I want to say Ys I and II was on it though.
163300	164300	Yeah, Ys I and II was on there.
164300	167300	That's great. I actually have that game, but it's still awesome.
167300	169300	But I'm curious how it now and what we're all wondering about...
169300	170300	I want the Volus games.
170300	173300	Well, how the hell are they going to fit all this on the Virtual Console?
173300	175300	Because the Wii only has so much internal memory.
175300	178300	Okay, first of all, the biggest things about the TurboGrafx-16 CD games
178300	183300	were that most of the audio on the Microsoft is all Redbook audio.
183300	186300	So all you'd have to do is compress it.
186300	188300	Or maybe they've removed the audio from the games.
188300	189300	Do you think that maybe they've done that?
189300	190300	No, I think it's compressed.
190300	195300	Just put it down to MP3. It'd probably be really small or Ogg Vorbis or whatever they want to use.
195300	196300	Oh, we'll see.
196300	198300	But I imagine you won't be able to fit that many of those on the game.
198300	201300	Or they're going to start selling these memory cards or something,
201300	203300	Virtual Console memory cards, or I don't know.
203300	206300	Obviously, any memory card will work, but you guys know what I mean.
206300	209300	They might start pushing people to get more memory cards.
209300	213300	The games themselves, though, didn't take up a whole lot of space.
213300	216300	I mean, they're just really the equivalent of...
216300	219300	I think one of the biggest ones that I personally have is Sapphire,
219300	224300	which has some rendered graphics in it.
224300	227300	No, actually, it has some true polygons in it.
227300	231300	And some of the CD arcade games,
231300	239300	but if we're just getting out East and all the other sprite-based ones,
239300	242300	that wouldn't take any space at all.
242300	244300	And the games are only going to be 800 points.
244300	245300	That's a pretty good deal.
245300	246300	Yeah, that's a really good deal.
246300	248300	I don't think it's going to be a major thing at all.
248300	254300	Especially if they're doing the Bomberman CD that came as a pack-in with the duo.
254300	256300	Or...
256300	258300	Rondo of Blood, maybe?
258300	260300	Rondo of Blood could actually easily be done.
260300	263300	If we're getting Super Nintendo cartridges on there,
263300	266300	it is not going to be hard at all for them to do Rondo of Blood.
266300	269300	How much of a fangasm will you have if Rondo of Blood comes out on Virtual Console?
269300	273300	I'd be like, thank God, I don't have to put my disc in the machine anymore.
273300	278300	My actual Rondo of Blood CD is still in perfect condition,
278300	281300	but I twitch every time.
281300	286300	I can't move the machine while I'm playing it because the disc costs $300.
286300	290300	It was saying that they were talking about,
290300	295300	it's going to be 10 games in 2007, 5 more slated for 2008.
295300	298300	Game downloads will be 800 points.
298300	302300	And I guess they are saying Rondo of Blood and Snatcher are true possibilities.
302300	305300	Huh. We'll see.
305300	306300	That'd be awesome.
306300	307300	That'd be really cool.
307300	313300	Well, speaking of our Virtual Console, let me go ahead and cover our UK Virtual Console.
313300	317300	For 600 points, we have Super Mario Bros. The Lost Levels,
317300	319300	which is a Famicom disc game,
319300	322300	and actually, according to this, it isn't the touched-up one
322300	327300	that was on the Super Mario All-Stars Super Nintendo cartridge.
327300	331300	Instead, this is the actual Super Mario Bros. 2 that came out in Japan,
331300	333300	which is freaking hard.
333300	336300	That's rad, though, that they actually released that on Virtual Console,
336300	340300	because we have never in this country seen the original Lost Levels,
340300	344300	except on ROMs, but if I seem to recall right, wasn't that a disc game?
344300	347300	That's what I said. It was a Famicom disc game.
347300	348300	Wow.
348300	351300	And so the price for it is going to be 600 points,
351300	354300	but I think that that's actually fair,
354300	358300	because it is basically a game that,
358300	361300	at least unless you owned a disc system,
361300	365300	you have never seen either remade or, you know,
365300	368300	it's the only unadulterated version of it that's going to be out.
368300	371300	Well, I mean, they have the one that was all touched up,
371300	374300	like they have the Super Nintendo, but that was different.
374300	377300	Yeah, but this is the actual one.
377300	379300	That's going to be pretty good.
379300	382300	And it's not Doki Doki Panic.
382300	384300	But maybe Doki Doki Panic will come out
384300	387300	now that they're releasing Japanese games on the console.
387300	390300	Yes, that opens huge doors now.
390300	392300	Well, here's a little bit more.
392300	396300	We have Mario Super P-Cross coming out,
396300	399300	which is 900 Wii points.
399300	404300	And then we have Neutopia 2, which we were discussing.
404300	407300	Right, so the UK finally got Neutopia 2 then.
407300	409300	So it looks like for these missing games,
409300	412300	they're charging 100 more points, is basically how it boils down to,
412300	414300	these never-before-seen.
414300	415300	Well, for anyone who doesn't know,
415300	417300	Neutopia 2 is going to be at 600 points.
417300	419300	Well, but that's one they've seen before.
419300	421300	So I'm curious, when does the US get this?
421300	423300	Because we've got to get it soon.
423300	426300	I don't know, but it's all part of this brand new,
426300	428300	I guess it's a thing that they're doing right now,
428300	433300	the Hanabi Festival in Europe and Australia.
433300	435300	And I guess this is week one is Mario Week.
435300	439300	Next week, they're going to be having Ninja Week.
439300	444300	And that's going to include Ninja Gaiden and Ninja Jaja Maru-kun.
444300	448300	And then I guess the third week is going to be Sci-Fi Week,
448300	452300	and that's going to have Sin and Punishment and Gradius 3.
452300	454300	That's a good game.
454300	459300	Actually, of the Gradius games, which one's your favorite?
459300	462300	Well, I've got to go to Salamander.
462300	463300	So I'm cheating.
463300	465300	I'm going to say Salamander.
465300	468300	I'm going to say Gradius 2 with the sun.
468300	470300	Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
470300	472300	Yeah, with Burning Heat, the Burning Heat stage.
472300	475300	Well, I actually have that one on TurboGrafx.
475300	476300	Yeah, you know, I don't know.
476300	478300	But I do have the Gradius collection on PSP,
478300	479300	so I have a lot of those games.
479300	482300	But I miss Salamander or Life Force.
482300	484300	But I think Salamander was a slight bit cooler,
484300	486300	because they had better graphics in their case.
486300	489300	I'm really hoping, now this is completely off topic here,
489300	491300	and I did Life Force or Salamander.
491300	494300	I was going to say, it'd be really awesome if they did.
494300	496300	They really need to do this in the U.S. as well.
496300	502300	And I think they also need to do the Nintendo World Championships cart
502300	506300	and have that with an online leaderboard with score,
506300	510300	so you can post it on there if anyone remembers that.
510300	512300	The World Championship cart?
512300	513300	Yeah.
513300	514300	I'm kind of curious.
514300	516300	I'm going to ask the chat room what kinds of import games
516300	520300	that we've been missing in the U.S. or the U.K. for a long time.
520300	522300	Would you like to see come to Virtual Console?
522300	524300	I'm sure somebody's going to say Doki Doki Panic,
524300	526300	although in some extent we kind of...
526300	528300	I'll take the first five ones on Pirate Message. How's that?
528300	530300	We already have Doki Doki Panic.
530300	532300	You want to take some private messages?
532300	534300	Yeah. Send me the first five private messages.
534300	536300	Tell me what import game you'd like to see come out.
536300	537300	All right. Then we'll read those in a little bit.
537300	538300	Yeah.
538300	540300	Send Dark Sakura, private message in our chat.
540300	542300	But it has to be in our regular chat room,
542300	543300	chat.orangelandrater.com.
543300	545300	And not 2DX.
545300	547300	Okay. Remember, if you're watching us on Operator 11,
547300	549300	we're not looking at the chat room over there,
549300	551300	because our computer that streams Op 11
551300	553300	is all the way on the other side of the room.
553300	557300	So, wow. Virtual Console.
557300	560300	So, there's other neat stuff, I guess.
560300	563300	Oblivion's Gamebryo engine has been ported to the Wii now.
563300	568300	So, now that doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to see Oblivion on the Wii,
568300	572300	but it means maybe we'll see some better games coming to the Wii as well.
572300	575300	And, of course, the Gamebryo engine's been used from everything,
575300	580300	including Freedom 4, Civ 4, Dark Age of Camelot,
580300	583300	and, oh, I mean, that's pretty cool.
583300	586300	Maybe we'll see an actual cool role-playing game or something,
586300	587300	maybe something scaled down.
587300	588300	Hey, they could do Oblivion,
588300	591300	or the PSP version that was supposed to be coming out a while ago.
591300	593300	The hell ever happened to the Wii, or the PSP version?
593300	595300	I don't think it's coming. I think it got cancelled.
595300	596300	Really?
596300	601300	But, hey, who says they can't port that over to maybe the Wii or something,
601300	603300	where they have a little bit more disk space to work with,
603300	608300	and, I don't know, real-time sword controls, maybe?
608300	610300	I don't know. Just speculation here.
610300	612300	Huh. Interesting.
612300	616300	Well, certainly if these guys want to use this Oblivion engine
616300	618300	to make new games for the Wii,
618300	620300	it's not like there's a shortage of Wiis out there.
620300	623300	I mean, certainly these things are still selling pretty well.
623300	626300	I'm sure we've had plenty of sales stories on the Wii in previous shows.
626300	628300	And, of course, this all leads up to Christmas.
628300	631300	You might remember last Christmas, finding a Wii was tough.
631300	635300	I mean, it was the Cabbage Patch Kids, or the Furbies, of last year.
635300	638300	So, yeah, and actually, rare fact, or rare dumb little tidbit,
638300	642300	I actually own a Furby that I got that Christmas,
642300	644300	because I'm a consumer whore.
644300	646300	There was only one cool Furby, Rob.
646300	647300	What's that?
647300	648300	The Gizmo one.
648300	649300	For gremlins.
649300	652300	All right, but anyway, back to the Nintendo Wii.
652300	655300	So, folks in the media are starting to ask Reggie Fils-Aime,
655300	657300	the man over at Nintendo,
657300	658300	what's up?
658300	661300	Are you guys going to have enough supply this Christmas season?
661300	662300	Well, Reggie Fils-Aime says,
662300	666300	quote, Wii hardware that will be in North American stores will be unprecedented,
666300	668300	substantially more than the launch,
668300	671300	substantially more than has been seen to date.
671300	675300	And that was a quote that Reggie Fils-Aime said to the San Jose Mercury News.
675300	678300	So, of course, if you really want one of these, though,
678300	683300	Reggie Fils-Aime still says you should regularly check to see if the system is available.
683300	687300	So even though they're saying they're going to flow through the streets with Wii supplies,
687300	689300	you probably still want to call the store and check,
689300	690300	because they might still be selling out.
690300	691300	I'll believe it when I see it.
691300	692300	That's what I'm saying.
692300	694300	I'll believe that shit when I see it.
694300	695300	Really?
695300	696300	I don't believe.
696300	699300	I mean, obviously, I haven't tried to purchase a Wii in a long time.
699300	700300	How is it out there?
700300	702300	I mean, are they still pretty hard to find?
702300	703300	It's been getting worse.
703300	704300	Really?
704300	705300	Yeah.
705300	707300	Promises, promises, and then no fucking delivery.
707300	708300	That's what it's been.
708300	709300	Sad face.
709300	713300	I just hope they have some games to move those systems this year,
713300	716300	but I guess we get in Smash Brothers Brawl, Mario Galaxy.
716300	718300	Those will be two AAA titles.
718300	719300	Don't get me wrong.
719300	722300	They have a pretty good first-party lineup for the rest of this year,
722300	726300	and even January, hopefully Mario Kart soon.
726300	727300	True.
727300	730300	But it's all about systems.
730300	731300	You really need the systems,
731300	734300	and I really hope that he's not blowing smoke up my ass.
734300	740300	Let's hope not, because I don't like smoke in my ass, much like meat.
740300	742300	Anyways.
742300	745300	Well, we got our responses in.
745300	746300	Okay.
746300	747300	Let's hear them.
747300	750300	Mario Kristoff says, Kuru Kuru Kuru Rin.
750300	751300	I don't even know that game.
751300	753300	It's a Game Boy Advance game.
753300	755300	Oh, and you can't have Game Boy.
755300	756300	I know.
756300	757300	They don't do Game Boy games on Virtual Console.
757300	758300	Cheater.
758300	759300	It'd be good if they could.
759300	760300	A damn dirty cheater?
760300	761300	No, I'm just kidding.
761300	763300	Foodie Monster says, Gauss Panic.
763300	764300	Oh, yes.
764300	765300	That would rock.
765300	766300	Yes, winner.
766300	769300	GS68 says, Gradius II, NES version.
769300	770300	Don't we already have it?
770300	772300	No, we don't.
772300	773300	In Japan, they got it.
773300	774300	Yes.
774300	777300	Hit Sense says Pulseman for the Mega Drive.
777300	778300	Wow.
778300	781300	Well, you know what I would pick for Mega Drive?
781300	783300	It'd freaking be Panorama Cotton.
783300	784300	Oh, hell yeah.
784300	785300	Good luck.
785300	787300	Well, you know I have Rainbow Cotton.
787300	788300	I know.
788300	791300	This somehow comes up, because I seem to remember I asked.
791300	794300	I made the mistake of asking in the early days of OLR.
794300	797300	Because Jamie has a very scary collection of video games at her house.
797300	798300	What are you missing?
798300	800300	What's the one thing you want that you're missing?
800300	803300	And Jamie always goes, freaking Panorama Cotton.
803300	805300	Okay, Panorama Cotton.
805300	808300	Sega made 600 copies of it.
808300	810300	I know somebody who owns one.
810300	812300	And I got to touch it.
812300	815300	And it was a special day in my life.
815300	817300	Did you touch it with your fingers?
817300	819300	Did you rub it on your arm or your boots?
819300	822300	I have actually played a legit Panorama Cotton before.
822300	823300	Did you?
823300	824300	It was really, really nice.
824300	825300	Can I touch your hand?
825300	828300	Oh, I've touched the hand that touched a Panorama Cotton.
828300	831300	I'll hook you up with playing Panorama Cotton.
831300	832300	All right, all right.
832300	837300	RalstonUT suggests Terranigma and Dragon Quest 5 and 6.
837300	838300	Okay.
838300	839300	Well, that might be cool.
839300	841300	I mean, but obviously they might have to translate it.
841300	843300	And I don't think these other ones were translated, so.
843300	847300	Frisbee mentioned the Japanese Mario Brothers 2,
847300	848300	not the alternate version,
848300	850300	but that was the one they're getting in the UK on Virtual Console.
850300	852300	So it's only really a matter of time.
852300	853300	Cool.
853300	856300	And Darktatsuya says, Crisis Force.
856300	857300	Wow.
857300	859300	So what would you pick, Rob?
859300	864300	How about the version of Excitebike where you could actually save and load?
864300	866300	That would be the disc version.
866300	869300	Why didn't they do that for the fucking Virtual Console version?
869300	870300	That's a really good question.
870300	871300	I don't know.
871300	872300	Okay, you know what I want?
872300	873300	Here's what I want.
873300	875300	You want to talk about like fucking obscure only available in Japan only?
875300	880300	I want the Zelda 1 remake that was on the Nintendo Channel thing,
880300	881300	the whatever it was called.
881300	882300	The MBS Satellaview.
882300	883300	That's it.
883300	884300	The Satellaview.
884300	885300	Satellaview.
885300	887300	What was the slower you made about it?
887300	888300	Just different graphics?
888300	891300	It was Super Nintendo graphics and I think it had shorter levels.
891300	892300	Yeah.
892300	898300	The Satellaview was a pay service where you had a timer for how long you could play,
898300	901300	but there are hacked ROMs out there now that you can play it without a timer.
901300	902300	Are there really?
902300	903300	Yeah, Dan played through it.
903300	904300	Oh.
904300	905300	Played through it.
905300	906300	I didn't know that there were ROMs in there.
906300	908300	Do you know one of the ones, though, that Melody has?
908300	909300	Hmm.
909300	912300	She has the contest version of Star Fox.
912300	913300	Oh, that's rad.
913300	915300	From the big competition.
915300	916300	That would be rad.
916300	922300	That would be so cool on the Wii if they would bring back that old World Championship.
922300	923300	Remember the Nintendo World Championships?
923300	926300	Like I said about five minutes ago.
926300	927300	Sorry.
927300	928300	The online leaderboards.
928300	931300	That's exactly what I said five minutes ago.
931300	932300	Were you not paying attention?
932300	933300	I guess not.
933300	934300	God.
934300	938300	I was thinking about Panorama Cotton.
938300	941300	Maybe they'd eventually finish Robotech Crystal Dreams.
941300	942300	All right.
942300	943300	But yeah.
943300	946300	Well, what import game did you want?
946300	949980	I have one to piss off the fans, and I don't really care to see this over here, because
949980	953500	I don't get the point of it, but Mother 3.
953500	954500	There you go.
954500	955900	You ain't getting it ever.
955900	958300	Actually, you can get the UK one and play it translated.
958300	962700	But I had a story, too.
962700	966300	We have a wireless classic controller for the GameCube.
966300	967300	Okay.
967300	972300	Oh, no, it's for the Wii, but it's by Thrustmaster, which has the best name ever.
972300	973300	Thrustmaster.
973300	975300	Is that the name of the controller?
975300	976300	Thrustmaster?
976300	978300	No, the company that's putting it out is Thrustmaster.
978300	982300	That sounds like something Suzanne Somers would be selling with the Thighmaster, Thrustmaster.
982300	984300	That sounds like a bad porn.
984300	989300	Instead of Beastmaster, you have Thrustmaster, Beastialitymaster, or something.
989300	991300	I don't know.
991300	994300	Thrustmaster just sounds like bad porn.
994300	995300	Okay.
995300	997300	Good times.
997300	998300	Anyways.
998300	1004300	So, here's another thing I don't understand about that wireless virtual console controller.
1004300	1009300	Why they don't have it where that it can be also a GameCube controller, as well.
1009300	1013300	Why don't they release something like that for the Wii, so that you can use one controller
1013300	1016300	for virtual console and for GameCube games?
1016300	1018300	That's what you need to do.
1018300	1020300	Make it happen, people.
1020300	1027300	Anyways, one thing that certain parents don't want to happen, much like me, is the Wii Zapper.
1027300	1032300	Which is the most retarded thing on the face of the earth, I swear to God.
1032300	1034300	Why the hate?
1034300	1035300	Why the hate?
1035300	1036300	It's stupid.
1036300	1037300	It's a piece of plastic.
1037300	1038300	You don't need it.
1038300	1040300	And it does not enhance your games, and I will prove it to you when it comes out.
1040300	1041300	That's right.
1041300	1042300	You might owe me a date.
1042300	1044300	I will not owe you a date at all.
1044300	1046300	What was I supposed to give you if you win?
1046300	1047300	I don't remember.
1047300	1048300	You were supposed to...
1048300	1050300	Oh, I have to take Nelly off your hands for a night.
1050300	1051300	Yeah.
1051300	1052300	That's what it was.
1052300	1058700	Anywho, so it has been announced officially that it is going to come out in November on
1058700	1066500	the 19th, I believe, and it's going to feature, hooray, Zelda's crossbow training, which is
1066500	1076160	going to be, I guess, exactly like the crossbow training that was in Twilight Princess, hooray.
1076160	1078580	So yeah, all for 20 bucks.
1078580	1083780	But there's some Jersey parents, though, that are kind of a little pissed off, describing
1083780	1091900	it as a gun-like remote, a wand in the shape of a weapon, and they don't want to happen.
1091900	1092900	Great.
1092900	1093900	This is what we need.
1093900	1097740	Children with guns learning how to aim and shoot.
1097740	1102380	Then we can sit back and wonder what is happening to our country with kids killing kids.
1102380	1104460	What's next?
1104460	1106220	First off, that doesn't look like a gun.
1106220	1109380	I don't know what kind of guns are out there in the market, but I'm pretty sure none of
1109380	1111660	them look like the Wii Zapper.
1111660	1118220	Second of all, there have been gun attachments for games for a long-ass time now.
1118220	1123140	And third, you don't have to buy it for your fucking kids, you moron.
1123140	1126940	Not that you can't play the no-shooter games without the attachment.
1126940	1132020	Here's my problem with this, is that these parental groups are about 20 years late.
1132020	1134420	Because remember the NES Zapper?
1134420	1135420	Hello?
1135420	1137100	That looked like a freaking gun.
1137100	1143500	I mean, not like a handgun, but that looked way more like a gun.
1143500	1144500	What was the one on Sega?
1144500	1147740	That was the Master System gun was based off the Zillion gun.
1147740	1150140	Okay, that thing looked like a real gun.
1150140	1151940	And hello, the Super Scope?
1151940	1152940	The Enforcer?
1152940	1156220	The Super Scope was a freaking bazooka that you put on your shoulder.
1156220	1159660	You remember the lethal enforcers guns that looked like six shooters?
1159660	1165380	Even though they were red and pink and blue, they were still in full-on gun shape.
1165380	1166660	I love the Super Scope.
1166660	1169340	Why the fuck didn't the Super Scope do better?
1169340	1172460	It's because there were no good freaking games for it.
1172460	1177140	But I mean, it was a goddamn bazooka that you got to play with.
1177140	1178140	I love my Super Scope.
1178140	1179140	That's how you win at the competition.
1179140	1180140	Oh, we have a gun.
1180140	1181140	Well, we have a fucking bazooka.
1181140	1182140	Top that shit.
1182140	1185300	Nintendo's like, look, we'll whip it out, ours is bigger.
1185300	1187300	And then Sega's like, well, we have a half bazooka.
1187300	1189740	They call it the Menacer.
1189740	1192580	So yeah, we also had the Activator and we know how well that went.
1192580	1197740	So now parents are all getting pissed off at this Wii Zapper thing, which looks nothing
1197740	1198740	like a gun.
1198740	1202620	I mean, seriously, I mean, it looks kind of like it's like a gun shaped cookie cutter
1202620	1203620	or something.
1203620	1204620	I don't know how to explain it.
1204620	1206580	If it was a gun, it would be a Tron prop.
1206580	1209660	It's as much of a gun as a banana is a gun, okay?
1209660	1211900	That's seriously the Wii Zapper.
1211900	1215940	Ooh, I like this comment from Rama in chat, chat.orangelsready.com.
1215940	1221100	Rama says this, it simply amuses me that about 20 years ago when Nintendo first introduced
1221100	1224900	the Zapper, the same soccer moms and dads that are protesting against it were playing
1224900	1227140	these light gun games on the original NES.
1227140	1230940	If that's not the biggest form of hypocrisy, I don't know what is, but hey, that's just
1230940	1231940	me.
1231940	1234980	Here's something, it's all these fucking parental guidance groups, they fucking see
1234980	1239300	a little headline or get like tipped off on something and then they go ballistic about
1239300	1243980	it without actually using no said item or even knowing anything about it.
1243980	1247380	I mean, they're pissed off at Bully when they knew, oh my God, it's a game with bullies
1247380	1248380	in it.
1248380	1250020	Oh, hate, hate, hate.
1250020	1254180	And then, you know, they didn't know what the hell the game was and it was like kind
1254180	1261300	of promoting against bullying people and it's just, all you have to know is you don't need
1261300	1265340	to listen to these people and nothing they ever do ever works anyway.
1265340	1268220	Has their banning of, you know, games worked?
1268220	1269220	No.
1269220	1271380	Has, you know, it hurt anybody's sales?
1271380	1272380	No.
1272380	1273380	Is it given...
1273380	1274380	Has it helped sales?
1274380	1275380	Has it given more publicity and stuff?
1275380	1276380	Yes, it has.
1276380	1279740	So, they are actually helping the sale of this stuff, you morons.
1279740	1281620	Escapist has a good question in chat, too.
1281620	1285300	Why aren't they protesting Big Buck Hunter, those deer hunting games in the front of every
1285300	1286300	wall?
1286300	1290500	Or how about why aren't they protesting Time Crisis 4, which looks more like a gun than
1290500	1291500	this thing?
1291500	1295180	Oh, but it's because the Wii, the Wii is a system for kids.
1295180	1298060	No it's not, you morons, seriously.
1298060	1301740	Thank God these crazies are in the minority, at least I hope so.
1301740	1305180	Those of you listening might notice that the rant levels seem to have gone through the
1305180	1309980	roof on this story, and y'all know what that means.
1309980	1317220	It's time for the FUs of the Week.
1317220	1321060	Dark Sakura.
1321060	1323380	My FU of the Week has to go...
1323380	1327360	I wouldn't really say so much towards Play N' See, but has to go toward my copy of Guild
1327360	1328360	Wars.
1328360	1332400	Because I've been playing on the demo for a little while and I finally decided to open
1332400	1336460	my box and install it on my PC, since I don't have World of War... not on my PC, but on
1336460	1339420	my laptop, since I don't have World of Warcraft installed on here.
1339420	1342700	And until I have my PC rebuilt, I'm just gonna stop paying for my World of Warcraft account.
1342700	1346460	So I was like, Guild Wars is free, I already have a character, I have a free box.
1346460	1353220	So I go to peel off the sticker so I can scratch off my ID, my access key, and the access key
1353220	1354220	peels off with it.
1354220	1355220	Oh no.
1355220	1356780	A lot of it did.
1356780	1358380	And I was like, well shit.
1358380	1363900	So Heather, bless her, she helped me, she got me my ID from my birthday.
1363900	1367500	I know, and I'm finally installing it.
1367500	1370900	And I've gone through all of that time, upgrading my Guild Wars and everything and downloading
1370900	1376860	all the patches, which has so much better of a patch function than World of Warcraft
1376860	1379380	could ever imagine having.
1379380	1385060	It downloads them all at once, instead of download me, download me, download me, but
1385060	1387020	anyway that's another story.
1387020	1394260	So I do have to say though that to play MC's credit, they are very fast in the response.
1394260	1400820	I sent in my request, I'd have to say around 7 o'clock on Thursday, I had a response within
1400820	1401820	an hour.
1401820	1404820	I had a second response 30 minutes after that.
1404820	1408700	Friday I got two more responses telling me that they were forwarding it to a different
1408700	1409700	party.
1409700	1412740	They were keeping me informed at every step of the way, and that's really good customer
1412740	1413740	service.
1413740	1419380	So, at the end of the disc, but a thank you goes to play MC, except for being closed on
1419380	1420380	the weekend.
1420380	1421380	The end.
1421380	1422380	Alright.
1422380	1427580	Anyways, uh, fuck you to Stars in Vacaville.
1427580	1434380	My god is that a whole bunch of ghetto wrapped into one ugly ass building, and, you know,
1434380	1438700	Qsar has really gone downhill there, as well as everything else there, their employees
1438700	1443700	don't give a shit, and I don't give a shit either, and I will not be coming back.
1443700	1452380	And that's saying a lot because the next Qsar is fucking 45 minutes away from that, so.
1452380	1453380	My turn?
1453380	1454380	Yeah.
1454380	1457540	Um, I'll have to give an FU to the waffle place I ate breakfast at today.
1457540	1462180	Now don't get me wrong, waffles are awesome, like waffles are God's food, okay?
1462180	1463180	Waffles are like the best thing ever.
1463180	1466180	I mean, can anybody think of a better food than waffles?
1466180	1467180	No?
1467180	1468180	Didn't think so.
1468180	1469180	Two waffles!
1469180	1470180	Yes, two waffles!
1470180	1471180	Cornmeal pancakes.
1471180	1472980	Here's the thing though.
1472980	1477400	I did have a pretty odd, well here's the reason why I give the place an FU is because they
1477400	1480380	didn't have a peanut butter waffle on their menu.
1480380	1486300	Like the competing waffle shop across town has a peanut butter waffle that I'm very used
1486300	1490620	to and I love that, and they don't have any type of peanut butter related waffle on menus.
1490620	1491620	That's why they get an FU.
1491620	1494460	However, they do redeem themselves, you know why?
1494460	1497940	Because they do have a waffle that has bacon inside it.
1497940	1500180	It's a bacon waffle.
1500180	1503540	So the only thing better than a waffle, a bacon waffle?
1503540	1507900	No, I beg to differ, that's really gross because it makes me look greasy.
1507900	1509620	That sounds awesome.
1509620	1512700	It was awesome, Loki, I can't even describe.
1512700	1513700	So there you go.
1513700	1515700	Hey, guess what I get to do in a month.
1515700	1516700	What?
1516700	1517700	I get to go eat at a waffle house.
1517700	1518700	Well, actually two months.
1518700	1522600	Like a legitimate, you know I've never eaten at an actual waffle house, but I'm worried
1522600	1526300	that if I do, it will ruin my impression of waffle.
1526300	1527300	Waffles everywhere.
1527300	1532140	Well, the thing about Waffle House, and all of our East Coast and Southern listeners will
1532140	1536340	know this, is that Waffle House isn't just about the waffles, which really aren't that
1536340	1538580	fantastic.
1538580	1543320	It's just about being at a fucking waffle house, and they have the best coffee ever,
1543320	1547980	and the best hash browns ever, because you can get them smothered, covered, chunked,
1547980	1553300	cheese, everything on it, and I was like, ah, sexy, but I went to Waffle House and I
1553300	1557500	came back with a hat, and they wouldn't sell me a cup, because I wanted a big coffee mug
1557500	1561020	that said Waffle House on it.
1561020	1564340	And just to let people know, I'm going to Alabama in November.
1564340	1569300	I will be doing my usual cyber station in Mobile, Alabama run, because I used to work
1569300	1574380	at that freaking arcade, and I hate it, but I will be there.
1574380	1577420	So are you going to go, do they have an ultracade machine there?
1577420	1578420	I don't remember.
1578420	1581900	They had a busted up DDR last time I was there, but that was the first place I played Tekken
1581900	1582900	5.
1582900	1586260	So will you, if they have an ultracade machine, will you be doing your ceremonial trip to
1586260	1587700	the arcade to kick the ultracade machine?
1587700	1589740	Yes, I will be kicking an ultracade.
1589740	1590740	I will also be...
1590740	1592860	What if they don't have an ultracade, what will you kick?
1592860	1597980	I will be kicking the smoking token, because it used to fucking break all the time, and
1597980	1604220	that bump and jump game, I hate that one too, but the thing about me going to cyber station
1604220	1609500	is that any new Namco arcade game that comes out, all the Namco arcades get it first, so
1609500	1614140	that's why I was in such a big tizzy to get to that one when I went a few years ago, so
1614140	1621220	I could go play Tekken 5, because they got it a couple of months before golf landed.
1621220	1627840	But I will not be going to New Orleans, sorry, that's too much of a drive, I may be in Biloxi.
1627840	1631900	I will be in Dothan, Alabama, and I will probably stop at the tilt for about five minutes and
1631900	1633860	leave, because that arcade...
1633860	1636140	To also kick a machine of your choosing.
1636140	1640100	If the tilt is closed, I don't know if it's still at the mall.
1640100	1643060	Hopefully a listener will know and can email us, but I was going to say, someday when we're
1643060	1648260	rock stars, that should be how we go out on tour to promote things, is we should set up
1648260	1651340	a time in an arcade for everybody to meet us there, and everybody can gather around
1651340	1653740	a machine, and then we all walk in and kick it and leave.
1653740	1662860	I did go to a DDR tourney, and this is when we already had Max, but their newest DDR machine
1662860	1666260	that they had at this arcade in...
1666260	1671140	I want to say it was at the Beaux-Rivage, this is of course before Katrina hit, was
1671140	1675060	a fifth mix, and I went to meet up with people there.
1675060	1677060	This is a few years ago.
1677060	1682500	Made some cool friends too, but just also to let people know while I'm thinking about
1682500	1686340	it, there's not going to be any more pump up the volume until I get my computer replaced.
1686340	1692100	My computer died a lot, so I'm done.
1692100	1694100	Ready to hear it.
1694100	1701380	Well, we got through our FUs of the Week, minorly unscathed.
1701380	1705140	Are there any other traveling anybody's doing this year that should be noted?
1705140	1706140	I don't know.
1706140	1707300	I know where I'm not going.
1707300	1708300	Where are you not going?
1708300	1710460	I'm not going to E for All.
1710460	1711460	Why is that?
1711460	1712460	I still kind of want to go for E for All.
1712460	1715340	I have the week off work, but why is it that you don't want to go?
1715340	1719300	Because, it's like everybody's canceled, and it's also in LA, and also the wife probably
1719300	1720300	wouldn't let me anyways.
1720300	1723020	The wife's not going to permit you to go?
1723020	1726340	Well, you know, it's a long ways away.
1726340	1729900	If it were in San Francisco or something like that, that would be a little different.
1729900	1736420	But eight hours away for something that's progressively getting worse?
1736420	1737420	I don't know.
1737420	1738420	Not for me.
1738420	1739420	We'll see.
1739420	1745460	I kind of want to go to network and see who I can meet and what have you, but we'll see.
1745460	1748700	Anyhow, there is a brand new version of Winamp coming out.
1748700	1752220	A lot of you guys left Winamp behind when you switched to iTunes to run with your iPod.
1752220	1754220	No, I don't touch that iTunes shit.
1754220	1755700	I've flipped off iTunes.
1755700	1758340	In the internet, a lot of folks did.
1758340	1763580	Now, we use Winamp to do this show and everything, but there is Winamp coming out.
1763580	1767900	A new version is coming out, and here's the cool thing about it, because they obviously
1767900	1771700	want people to go back to Winamp, folks that ditched them for iTunes.
1771700	1772700	Here's the thing.
1772700	1779540	A new version of Winamp will stream songs to your consoles, such as the Nintendo Wii.
1779540	1783300	So a new version of Winamp, it's the 10th anniversary edition, and it's going to stream
1783300	1784300	to your consoles.
1784300	1785820	Pretty rad.
1785820	1790580	I'm not sure exactly how it works yet, but I'm sure we will see more when the release
1790580	1793900	of this comes out, which I'm not sure exactly when it's supposed to.
1793900	1797540	I haven't seen a date on it, but I imagine it's later this year.
1797540	1798540	That's pretty cool.
1798540	1802660	And I was going to remind the chat room, because it's been a while since we talked about the
1802660	1803900	whole UltraCade thing.
1803900	1808460	The reason why you're supposed to kick an UltraCade machine is because at one time,
1808460	1813460	well, other than the fact that it sucks, at one time the company that owns UltraCade tried
1813460	1820460	to register a trademark for, or copyright or something, for MAME, and that's why, even
1820460	1822740	though they didn't make any of that.
1822740	1827500	It was this big legal nightmare, but UltraCade sucks anyway.
1827500	1836060	So this is, I guess, new news there, but old news for us, really, because we've had DDR
1836060	1842060	in schools for a long time, is over in the UK, they're using Dancing Stage, which is
1842060	1853100	the version of Dance Dance Revolution over there, to combat childhood obesity.
1853100	1859940	There are trials that are done in Bedfordshire schools to see if people will play that, but
1859940	1866820	they're targeting it towards girls who don't want to play sports, especially competitive
1866820	1867820	sports.
1867820	1872100	So it's basically to help increase activities going on at school, and I think that's pretty
1872100	1874100	cool.
1874100	1878700	I mean, I played DDR for a long time, and it's activity.
1878700	1880260	Activity is activity.
1880260	1881260	Definitely.
1881260	1887300	Let's see here, I was going to say, there's a brand new, of course we played a little
1887300	1893900	bit, if you were listening to us live during the break, a brand new album coming out from
1893900	1901260	OC Remix, and it's Lifestream, a tribute album to Final Fantasy VII, or Voices of the Lifestream,
1901260	1902260	I should say.
1902260	1910700	It is four discs, huge, completely free, there's a 2.32 gigabyte torrent for it available,
1910700	1915660	and it's split up, I guess, into their four different universes, Crisis Core, Jurge of
1915660	1923140	Service, Advent Children in Last Order, and features a bunch of awesome music, 45 tracks
1923140	1928740	including, and features the work of 42 different remixers.
1928740	1931020	So freaking awesome.
1931020	1932020	Download it now.
1932020	1935380	Yeah, we'll actually play a couple clips here, just some real quick clips here on the show,
1935380	1938780	so you can hear what some of this, this is one we played during the break, this is a
1938780	1943860	Jenova remix, called Jenova Celestial by Blind.
1943860	1961980	I like that, it's all like techno-y and stuff, and there's a Chocobo remix called Que, Electric
1961980	1977620	De Chocobo, which is by an artist named Durangin, here's a little clip.
1977620	1982180	And one more clip we'll play for you guys, this is a song that's a compilation from Norg
1982180	1983180	and Snappleman.
1983180	2003980	They came together to do this one called Full Frontal Assault, pretty rad.
2003980	2010240	So it's free on their site, so pretty cool.
2010240	2013500	Maybe I'll play something on the Xbox 360 and use that as a custom soundtrack, that
2013500	2014500	might be kind of fun.
2014500	2018180	Play like Blue Dragon and use that as a custom soundtrack, who knows.
2018180	2021900	Anyhow, one game that you don't use custom soundtracks for though is Guitar Hero 3, and
2021900	2025820	certainly it seems like every week we're hearing about some new songs in the game.
2025820	2031220	Well get this, if a recent post on Score Hero that came up and then was taken down not even
2031220	2036420	two minutes later is to be believed, the full song list for Guitar Hero 3 has leaked.
2036420	2039640	The whole fact that it was up and then taken down right away certainly seems to make it
2039640	2045100	look like it was removed, and you'll have to forgive me because I don't remember exactly
2045100	2048660	what has been announced and what's not, but I do notice some interesting stuff here.
2048660	2052860	I remember that Tom Morello was announced as a boss, but Rage Against the Machine has
2052860	2056620	Bulls On Parade in there, remember that's a pretty awesome guitar song.
2056620	2060780	And let's see what else caught my eye here, Tenacious D's in there, but I think they were
2060780	2061780	announced for that before.
2061780	2066580	Guns N' Roses, Welcome to the Jungle, Aerosmith, same old song and dance, so Aerosmith might
2066580	2070620	actually be Guitar Hero 3, I know we heard a story last week that they were going to
2070620	2072140	be a big part of Guitar Hero 4.
2072140	2075300	I was going to write how Chili Peppers Suck My Kiss.
2075300	2081660	Yeah, I'm trying to think what else here, oh the Encore Stage, the very last song, you
2081660	2087780	know how before it was Freebird, now it's going to be The Devil Went Down to Georgia.
2087780	2088820	Nice.
2088820	2089820	So that'll be pretty rad.
2089820	2094900	And I guess, what was this one, it says Boss Lou Guitar Battle?
2094900	2095900	I don't know.
2095900	2098220	I don't know who Lou would be.
2098220	2101900	Let's see here, they were saying...
2101900	2102900	Lou Reed maybe?
2102900	2103900	I don't know.
2103900	2106020	Disturbed, stricken, that's kind of cool before I forget.
2106020	2107020	Where does it say Lou?
2107020	2108020	Oh I don't know.
2108020	2110620	Maybe it's an in-game character, who knows.
2110620	2111620	Maybe.
2111620	2113940	I don't know my Guitar Heroes apparently.
2113940	2115220	I'm trying to see if there's anything else.
2115220	2119060	But now again, this is a rumored list, so we don't know for sure.
2119060	2122260	I don't know, it looks pretty official to me.
2122260	2125620	Yeah, it looks pretty convincing.
2125620	2126620	We'll see.
2126620	2128620	I mean, the game's out, what?
2128620	2129620	Next month?
2129620	2131620	It's the end of next month, the 31st.
2131620	2132620	Halloween!
2132620	2133620	Halloween!
2133620	2137260	I think they'll actually know it, I take that back, the 28th is when it's coming out, Sunday.
2137260	2140660	Oh, they're doing a weekend release because they can.
2140660	2144940	Anyhow, we're going to do the Mailbag segment now, because we can.
2144940	2148060	That's what we want to do, and every week you guys send us emails, and Dark Sakura picks
2148060	2152580	a few of her favorites and reads them live, on air, and then makes fun of them as well,
2152580	2154620	when she feels like it.
2154620	2157460	The mailbag at orangesonsrated.com is the place to send those emails.
2157460	2158460	So open up the mailbag!
2158460	2161460	Dive in, Dark Sakura, what's in there?
2161460	2164620	Hello guys, what's up?
2164620	2168700	This is Foodie Monster from Argentina, and this is probably my first email to you guys.
2168700	2172100	Anyway, I won't make it long since I've been known to call into the show a few times, so
2172100	2175540	I'm not scared of the Skypline to make any long-winded rants.
2175540	2179780	The reason to this email is to send you guys a picture of the game drawn to life for the
2179780	2180780	DS.
2180780	2184660	I believe you guys don't know this game, which got released on September 11th, I believe,
2184660	2185660	so it's new.
2185660	2189500	It's a cutesy game, and would be well-defined as a weird hybrid between Zelda Adventure
2189500	2190500	Island, Mario, and Sonic.
2190500	2193540	Yes, I know it all seems to be all over the place.
2193540	2197860	Anyway, the point is that the gimmick of this game is that you basically draw everything,
2197860	2202980	and not just lines, no, I mean full-blown things, from clouds you step on, to the slug
2202980	2207640	you ride on on one of the levels, to the gun you wield, to the main character.
2207640	2210980	And that's what I wanted to show you guys, in the pictures that I've attached, I made
2210980	2216500	one of OLR's, and Jamie's favorite, a playable character, a cute Pyramid Head.
2216500	2219700	The pictures do speak for themselves, and it shows the way you can show the listeners
2219700	2220700	as well.
2220700	2224540	Maybe point the Operator 11 camera at the computer screen or something.
2224540	2225540	Too late, Op11 died.
2225540	2228900	But I thought it was pretty funny, especially when the town's mayor says, oh, Pyramid H,
2228900	2230900	go to rescue little Miwa.
2230900	2234860	The whole time I pictured a Pyramid Head ripping said little girl to shreds with a giant meat
2234860	2236860	cleaver, and that made me LOL.
2236860	2240300	Anyways, I'll wrap this up and let you guys continue through the mailbag.
2240300	2242300	Take care and keep up the great work as usual.
2242300	2243540	Oh, that's cute.
2243540	2244540	Here's the little Pyramid Head.
2244540	2248540	I'm looking, I peeked in the mailbag as well to pull out the pictures.
2248540	2249540	That is cute.
2249540	2253260	And this is great radio, but maybe Footy, I think it's Footy's in chat tonight, so maybe
2253260	2254260	he can share.
2254260	2255260	Oh yeah, he just posted his photo bucket there.
2255260	2256260	Thank you, Footy.
2256260	2257260	Thank you.
2257260	2258260	That was awesome radio.
2258260	2259260	By the way, pictures make for great radio.
2259260	2260260	That is the cutest thing ever.
2260260	2261260	Look at that.
2261260	2262260	Oh my God, he's adorable.
2262260	2263260	I want one.
2263260	2264260	I want my Pyramid Headie.
2264260	2269100	Pea Headie, Pea Headie, Pea Headie.
2269100	2270100	We call him Pea Headie.
2270100	2272100	I'm going to look at the other picture.
2272100	2275260	Oh my God, he's so cute.
2275260	2280540	Okay, so moving on.
2280540	2289580	So from Gray Fox, we have an email.
2289580	2293100	Hello LLR gang, I've been listening to your podcast for a couple of months now and would
2293100	2294420	like to say that I love your show.
2294420	2298660	I agree with many others who have commented that it is hilarious interactions between
2298660	2301100	all three of you that make this show unique.
2301100	2305020	I had about a four year hiatus of gaming because of being enrolled in university and did not
2305020	2307100	have much time for video games.
2307100	2310940	Now that I have graduated, I have more time to play, so I got myself a PS2 slimline and
2310940	2311940	I'm loving it so far.
2311940	2318340	I was wondering if it were possible to have a section on the show dedicated to great last
2318340	2319340	gen games.
2319340	2323220	I find there are many people who cannot afford to get involved in the next gen gaming and
2323220	2328880	there are still many great games, Metal Gear Solid Series, God of War, Viewtiful Joe, etc.
2328880	2333800	Right now I rely on IGN for my game recommendations, but I am afraid that some games might still
2333800	2335860	be great but get a lower score.
2335860	2336860	Any help would be great.
2336860	2338900	Keep up the good work.
2338900	2347660	I would suggest for good PS2 games, definitely the Metal Gear series.
2347660	2353260	I was always a big fan of the Tekken games because I love my fighting games a whole lot.
2353260	2355780	I'm a big Namco nerd.
2355780	2360500	Klonoa 2 was a really, really, really good PS2 game.
2360500	2364340	It got really hard toward the end, but it was a really good game.
2364340	2367740	It kind of makes you think, if you're going to pick up a platformer, I suggest Klonoa
2367740	2368740	2.
2368740	2369740	Guys?
2369740	2373900	I don't know, but Klonoa 2, I mean it's a good, it's okay a game I guess.
2373900	2378100	As far as the last gen game goes, I mean they're still making some good stuff for PlayStation
2378100	2379100	2.
2379100	2382260	Like Final Fantasy XII came out amongst all the new consoles and kind of got lost, but
2382260	2384260	it's a freaking great RPG.
2384260	2389820	And I know a lot of folks in chat have been yapping about Persona 3, which is also supposed
2389820	2390820	to be a really good one.
2390820	2391820	I still need to play the demo.
2391820	2392820	I've been busy.
2392820	2393820	Yeah, I know.
2393820	2396980	I want to play the full game at some point, but just, you know, there's so many games
2396980	2398580	out there to play right now.
2398580	2402900	So certainly PS2 still has a bunch of crack going out for it.
2402900	2405980	And you know, I still, I even want to go way back to some of the games that were released
2405980	2406980	earlier on.
2406980	2410860	I still want to catch up on the.hack series, because I actually enjoy the games, the little
2410860	2411860	bits I played of them.
2411860	2413380	There's just, you know, a lot to them.
2413380	2417280	So ironically enough, we talked about in part 8 tonight, Jamie's going to have a classic
2417280	2420980	game of the week segment, so maybe once in a while he can have a PS2 game or something
2420980	2421980	in there.
2421980	2422980	Oh, you know what?
2422980	2423980	Space Channel 5.
2423980	2424980	Ooh, good times.
2424980	2427300	They did a double release of 1 and 2.
2427300	2428300	Why not get that?
2428300	2429300	That's fun.
2429300	2430300	Parappa 2?
2430300	2433740	Yeah, Parappa 2 is really fun.
2433740	2436140	Mojib Ribbon, if you're into the import.
2436140	2437140	If you can get it.
2437140	2439140	NCSX still sells it.
2439140	2443260	You know, you've got your 2DX, your DDR.
2443260	2445180	There's tons of good stuff on PS2.
2445180	2446180	Rez.
2446180	2447180	Rez.
2447180	2448180	Oh yes, Rez.
2448180	2449180	Good job.
2449180	2450180	Amplitude.
2450180	2451180	Frequency.
2451180	2452180	Guitar Hero.
2452180	2457500	Yeah, those prequels to, or you could say to what ended up being Guitar Hero.
2457500	2458500	Yeah.
2458500	2459500	Cool.
2459500	2460500	Yes.
2460500	2461500	I am moving forward.
2461500	2462500	Prepare to fast-forward.
2462500	2467980	Hey, Rob, Jamie, and Matt, it's been a while since I've communicated with you guys, so
2467980	2468980	I've missed you all.
2468980	2475260	I'm still unpacking from my move to Brooklyn Studios, but the area I'm at, really awesome.
2475260	2477500	A few things I'd like to say if you don't mind.
2477500	2481220	Rob, I know you're not a big fan of anime, but I've heard you go on about how awesome
2481220	2482220	Blue Dragon is.
2482220	2484900	In case you haven't heard, there's an anime based on the game now.
2484900	2485900	Here's my question.
2485900	2489660	If there was a game that you liked also had an anime to it, would you watch it as well?
2489660	2492580	Oh, and Jamie, I've seen the first episode, and it's pretty good.
2492580	2493580	It's a must-see.
2493580	2495940	I'm gonna have to download that then.
2495940	2498980	I will say this, so far, sorry, I know the email's not done, but just to get that part
2498980	2505440	out of the way, I don't think Blue Dragon is like, OMG awesome, but Blue Dragon is better
2505440	2507980	than a lot of people say it is, I think.
2507980	2511580	It's just, you know, it's a Super Nintendo RPG with next-gen graphics.
2511580	2512580	That's what Blue Dragon is.
2512580	2514660	Take it or leave it.
2514660	2515660	Would I watch the anime?
2515660	2516660	Sure.
2516660	2517660	I've heard it's out there.
2517660	2518660	I think I've seen it on YouTube.
2518660	2520340	I just haven't sat down to watch it.
2520340	2523900	But I did watch an episode of Final Fantasy Unlimited just because I liked Final Fantasy,
2523900	2524900	so yeah, I've done it.
2524900	2526180	Final Fantasy Unlimited was a very strange series.
2526180	2530500	Yeah, it wasn't, yeah, I didn't watch the whole thing, but you know, it's, I will, if
2530500	2531500	I'm into it enough.
2531500	2533180	I still need to finish Death Note, okay?
2533180	2534980	Anyway, Rob, another question.
2534980	2538180	The New York chapter of the O.L. Army wants to know if you're going to digital life.
2538180	2541820	I know you said you were thinking about it because you have a credit with JetBlue, but
2541820	2543220	not much has been said.
2543220	2546540	Would love it if you came out to New York City again because we all love you.
2546540	2550180	I thought I'd clarified this on a previous show, but perhaps some folks were out or maybe
2550180	2555100	I said it on a off-recorded break or something, but unfortunately, due to a conflict, I cannot
2555100	2556300	make it out there for digital life.
2556300	2558100	I'm very sorry to the New York folks.
2558100	2561180	However, you're right, I still have that credit from JetBlue and I've got to use it before
2561180	2565020	June or it goes away, so you bet you're going to see me out there in the spring for something.
2565020	2566020	So we'll see.
2566020	2567020	Okay.
2567020	2568260	Well, let me move forward.
2568260	2573660	And by the way, this email is from our Ron Chan in the chat room who always makes me
2573660	2575660	squee.
2575660	2580540	So moving forward, speaking of East Coast, no, we've already done that one.
2580540	2581540	Wait.
2581540	2582540	Have I done that?
2582540	2583540	No, I haven't.
2583540	2586140	Speaking of the East Coast, Rob, you've jokingly said that if we fly at O.L.R. out to a con,
2586140	2587140	you would all go.
2587140	2591020	I can't do that, but I can try to get you, Jamie, and Matt to scounce on flights if you
2591020	2595860	three can come to anime next to local con in Jersey.
2595860	2596860	He's offering us to stay.
2596860	2599260	Do you think we could make something like that?
2599260	2600540	Well, we'll consider.
2600540	2605440	We do have something, a resource we can tap into to maybe make that happen.
2605440	2607860	It would just be also, though, our personal calendars.
2607860	2610860	We also, don't forget, Oren's on Friday, we don't get paid for doing this.
2610860	2611940	This isn't our jobs.
2611940	2617540	So we all have jobs and Jamie goes to school, Loki's married, so sometimes our personal
2617540	2620580	lives keep us at home, not just so much the fact that we're poor.
2620580	2624420	But we do have a money resource we can tap into and we appreciate the offer.
2624420	2626300	Here's the thing, though.
2626300	2630300	If we're going to go to a con and make that kind of trip for it, I just don't want some
2630300	2634740	like Sunday morning when everybody's packing, because that kind of, you know what I went
2634740	2635740	through, Rama.
2635740	2638740	And although I had a good time at the con, don't get me wrong, I was a little disappointed,
2638740	2642540	you know, that when you get scheduled for such a crap time, when you make that kind
2642540	2646180	of trip out somewhere, you know, that it's unfortunate.
2646180	2649220	So I still love you, Rama, mwah, mwah, mwah.
2649220	2651220	Okay, where was I?
2651220	2655340	Also, more good news, I've decided not to get a wee now because my friends around me
2655340	2657220	have one, including my own roommate.
2657220	2659940	I've decided to get an Xbox 360 instead.
2659940	2663540	Despite the three year warranty Microsoft has given, I'm opting for the two year replacement
2663540	2667660	plan because I'd rather spend the extra cash to have it replaced the same day at my local
2667660	2668660	Best Buy.
2668660	2674940	I'm planning to purchase it February 08, when they should have the 65nm chips in it.
2674940	2679060	Now that you all know I'm buying one, I'm really fickle about buying games.
2679060	2683180	I'd like each of you to recommend one game I should get, but don't suggest Rumble Roses
2683180	2688260	XX, I'm already planning on buying that.
2688260	2690260	Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
2690260	2693020	Somebody's getting a text message.
2693020	2694260	That's probably sauce.
2694260	2695820	You can't text message Breakup.
2695820	2697620	That's probably sauce.
2697620	2699300	I'm sorry, what was the question?
2699300	2700300	Cheap Xbox 360 games?
2700300	2704220	Well, just an Xbox 360 game that you would suggest buying.
2704220	2708420	Well I know you like RPGs, Rama, so I would say Blue Dragon, or I think, has Enchanted
2708420	2709900	Arms gotten a price cut yet?
2709900	2711660	Because Enchanted Arms also wasn't bad.
2711660	2716340	Enchanted Arms is dirt cheap now, especially if you have a Playstation 3, it's really dirt
2716340	2717340	cheap.
2717340	2718340	Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
2718340	2720980	If you want to try an RPG, opt for Enchanted Arms, it's not as bad as people made it out
2720980	2722280	to be.
2722280	2725980	If you can get through the first couple hours, which are a little rough especially, you really
2725980	2726980	start to get into it.
2726980	2728740	I don't think it was a bad game.
2728740	2730020	Again, it wasn't a great game.
2730020	2735020	I'm still waiting for the freaking great blow your hair back RPG on the Xbox 360, which
2735020	2738700	I'm hoping is Eternal Sonata, but I shouldn't hold my breath.
2738700	2740900	Marvel Ultimate Alliance, that's all I have to say.
2740900	2746460	Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Uno, anyway.
2746460	2749660	Yeah, don't forget the arcade actually.
2749660	2756780	Make sure that you get Castlevania, that's also, it looks kind of, actually the Double
2756780	2761660	Dragon is so funny because it's all high res, and to me, it just doesn't look the same.
2761660	2763660	It's not as cool to me.
2763660	2768380	Okay, next part, oh Jamie, I had my house warming last night, I didn't get any Guinness,
2768380	2774300	I'm sorry, Tear, but we did have other alcoholic beverages and I did a 151 shot for you, which
2774300	2778340	reminds me of how much I loved hanging out with you at Final Mate, aww, I know I've said
2778340	2781460	this several times already, but you truly made me feel at home, I can't wait to come
2781460	2784180	back out there, not to calm, but to relax and have a good time.
2784180	2790540	Oh, that's so sweet, well definitely, you've got crashing space, definitely have crashing
2790540	2791540	space.
2791540	2792540	I'm sorry, what?
2792540	2793540	Who wants to come back out and hang out?
2793540	2794540	Oh.
2794540	2795540	That's cool.
2795540	2796540	Cool.
2796540	2798620	Okay, I'm almost done with the email.
2798620	2803620	Speaking of fun times, all of OLR me is on notice, I will be back for Final Mate 2009
2803620	2808740	Prior Commitments for 08, and it will be OLR Con, two suites full of OLR fans just going
2808740	2809740	insane.
2809740	2816300	Oh, and for the record, the fancy Articulate Guys comment from last week was made by my
2816300	2819260	friend Patty, not by me, and she rocks hard.
2819260	2821220	Do you remember you commented on that, Rob?
2821220	2824900	I remember there was the fancy- Articulate Guys.
2824900	2828740	Alright, whatever, yeah, I'm just starting to get warm, I'm going to have to open the
2828740	2829740	door pretty soon.
2829740	2834820	I believe that's it for now, I had more topics to comment on, but I forgot what I was going
2834820	2839260	to say about them, but keep up the good work, and don't stop believing, wink face.
2839260	2842300	DJ Rama asked, proud member of the OLR me since 2003.
2842300	2844740	That was a long email.
2844740	2845740	Last email.
2845740	2846740	Alright.
2846740	2850900	Hey, OLR Nintendo Maniac 64 here, for math class, I'm doing a survey-like thing, it's
2850900	2855620	very simple, I need you to list your preference of which of the following gaming systems from
2855620	2857620	one best to four worst.
2857620	2864860	The Wii, the 360, Playstation 3, and PC emulators and ROMs do not count.
2864860	2868740	And then, oh, he just wants to send an e, oh, never mind, he's wanting us to do his
2868740	2869740	poll.
2869740	2871220	Well, I'm curious, what of the four do you think is best?
2871220	2877380	Oh, lordy, I'm just setting myself up for fanboy backlash.
2877380	2882420	I'm gonna go strictly in terms of based of what's available, and what I play, and where
2882420	2886580	my time goes based on that, because, you know, our golden rule, we haven't said it a long
2886580	2891500	time on this show, so let me reiterate the golden rule of gaming, a console is only as
2891500	2893380	good as the games that are on it.
2893380	2894380	Yep.
2894380	2895380	Alright.
2895380	2900120	So, that being said, I would say the Xbox 360 is number one, PC is number two, Wii is
2900120	2903100	number three, Playstation 3 is number four.
2903100	2905100	I agree with that.
2905100	2911700	But let me put this honestly, based on the golden rule of gaming, like Xbox 360, PC,
2911700	2916820	and Wii, well, I would say Xbox 360 and PC are like really close to the top, Wii down
2916820	2918580	a little bit, but still near the top.
2918580	2919580	It's getting there.
2919580	2921580	Big gap.
2921580	2923460	And then Playstation 3 at the bottom.
2923460	2929620	Well, being that I have a PS3 and have a bunch of games for it, the only game I played on
2929620	2934500	that one regularly was Marvel Ultimate Alliance, and, you know, and now that I have it on Xbox
2934500	2936500	360, I'm like, well, why?
2936500	2937500	What's the point?
2937500	2940700	I can actually play it and not have to shake my controller around like an idiot and look
2940700	2945340	like I'm having a seizure trying to do the underwater level, so screw it.
2945340	2949980	You know you don't need to flail your arms around a lot, you can just do it with your
2949980	2950980	wrist.
2950980	2951980	She likes to flail.
2951980	2953380	I don't know, but I hate it.
2953380	2954980	Loki, what would be your list?
2954980	2961740	I don't know about PC, I mean, I don't play a lot of PC stuff, so I would say probably,
2961740	2967220	well, 360 because there's just a lot of games on it.
2967220	2972540	Wii is hard, I mean, there's a lot of games out there, but I don't play it a lot, so actually
2972540	2977200	I would say probably, and I don't want to put the Playstation, I guess I'd say the same
2977200	2982380	list as you, Rob, but the thing is, you know, I don't play a lot of PC games because my
2982380	2988900	computer sucks, and then I don't play definitely a lot of Playstation 3 games because there's
2988900	2994940	really nothing out for it, and the Wii, there's just nothing out that I really must have.
2994940	2999540	Sometimes, and I have to keep this in mind about PC gaming, is that PC gaming can also
2999540	3003320	be a lot of those homebrew and freeware things you play that you can't really get on any
3003320	3006980	other system, and you know, certainly games like World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XI
3006980	3011860	on the PC, big time sink games for me, you know, I probably, when you add it up, I actually
3011860	3014420	probably do more gaming on the PC than anywhere else.
3014420	3018180	I'm surprised, though, Mac wasn't number one on there, because I would have thought the
3018180	3019180	Mac would be on there.
3019180	3021240	Oh, that's right, it wasn't one of the options.
3021240	3022240	My mistake.
3022240	3023240	No games.
3023240	3024240	No games.
3024240	3025240	Sorry.
3025240	3026240	Shut up.
3026240	3027240	All right, any more to that email, DarkSakura?
3027240	3028240	That's it for the mailbag.
3028240	3033480	All right, if you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
3033480	3034480	Until then.
3034480	3035480	More news, right, Logie?
3035480	3036480	Dot com.
3036480	3041140	Yeah, of course, I have tons of news for you, anyways.
3041140	3047900	So yeah, there's a, I'm pulling up different stories now, anyways, there's some interesting
3047900	3052740	rumors going around about the Mel Your Solid movie, one of which is that Christian Bale
3052740	3058780	is up for the role for Solid Snake himself, so that'd be pretty interesting.
3058780	3069700	I guess it's from a UK magazine called Nuts, which I'm not really sure if I would add.
3069700	3075980	I don't know how that would really rate there, but they say he's in the running to play Solid
3075980	3080260	Snake for the 2009 movie Mel Your Solid.
3080260	3084380	And of course, I don't know.
3084380	3088660	That's a big fat rumor, I think.
3088660	3089660	I don't know.
3089660	3092020	I don't know if he'd look good as Snake, though.
3092020	3093920	Can't see him as Snake.
3093920	3096180	They need someone who's a lot more hardcore.
3096180	3098700	Well, if Tom Selleck were younger.
3098700	3100860	No, no, no, no, no.
3100860	3102780	If Kurt Russell were younger.
3102780	3103780	Kurt Russell, yeah.
3103780	3105140	I like Kurt Russell.
3105140	3106700	Kurt Russell would be able to do it.
3106700	3108340	Or he could play Old Snake.
3108340	3109820	Or even Richard Dean Anderson.
3109820	3110820	Yeah.
3110820	3116780	Do you saw him in the, no, I'm thinking of two people who play the same character in
3116780	3117780	Stargate.
3117780	3118780	Maybe.
3118780	3119780	I don't know.
3119780	3120780	Alright.
3120780	3121780	I love Stargate.
3121780	3122780	Anyway.
3122780	3123780	Stargate's okay.
3123780	3128980	You know what else is okay?
3128980	3129980	What?
3129980	3130980	Handsets.
3130980	3132540	I don't know.
3132540	3135700	I don't have a transition for this.
3135700	3141220	But Sony Ericsson is possibly going to tap into the PlayStation brand for some of the
3141220	3146820	new high-end, meaning expensive, mobile phones that they're going to be putting out.
3146820	3150620	Could they be turning the PlayStation brand into what the N-Gage was?
3150620	3151860	Not really.
3151860	3157460	But they'll just kind of be using the PlayStation branding to try and launch a possible, I'm
3157460	3159380	sorry, there is not a gaming phone.
3159380	3160380	I should say this.
3160380	3163140	I don't know PSP phone slash thing or whatever.
3163140	3170700	But since Ericsson and PlayStation are under the same corporate entity, Sony, why not explore
3170700	3172420	the possibilities of what could happen?
3172420	3174100	So there you go.
3174100	3178980	They need to just bring out the freaking Vodafone over here and leave it at that.
3178980	3179980	I mean, who's going to care?
3179980	3182740	Because everybody's buying one of those iPhones now.
3182740	3184580	Even I'm tempted to get a stinking iPhone.
3184580	3188580	But I'm holding out because I'm convinced next year they'll have GPS in them.
3188580	3190620	That's the one thing that's missing that I want.
3190620	3191620	I'm getting a BlackBerry.
3191620	3194100	I think it's going to be revised so many times.
3194100	3195420	I'm getting a BlackBerry.
3195420	3197420	I'm trying so hard to resist the iPhone temptation.
3197420	3198420	Let me just put it that way.
3198420	3199420	I'm getting a BlackBerry.
3199420	3200420	Well, aren't you special?
3200420	3202420	I am.
3202420	3212580	Well, for anyone who is interested in interesting ways of announcing games or hinting at games
3212580	3215940	or starting weirdo rumors anyway.
3215940	3224060	For the demo for Tony Hawk Proving Ground, there is a poster that says, shows a sequel
3224060	3228260	for Gun, Magruder's Ghost.
3228260	3229260	So is it a rumor?
3229260	3230260	Is it a tease?
3230260	3231260	Is it wishful thinking?
3231260	3234100	Is it someone just trying to make a funny?
3234100	3237460	Who knows?
3237460	3238460	Hopefully it's a real game.
3238460	3239460	Gun was okay.
3239460	3240460	I know it wasn't.
3240460	3241460	It didn't sell very well.
3241460	3242460	I know it's good.
3242460	3243460	Gun didn't do very well.
3243460	3244460	Did it?
3244460	3245460	So I was kind of.
3245460	3249500	I mean, they can always fix that stuff for sequels.
3249500	3252180	That's the whole point of doing a sequel, to fix the crap that didn't work in the first
3252180	3253180	one.
3253180	3254180	Exactly.
3254180	3259340	That's why we're on so many NBA Live games and Madden and whatnot.
3259340	3264220	Anyways, this is kind of a little 180 of normal news.
3264220	3268780	Conan, the game that was supposed to be coming out at the end of October, got bumped up into
3268780	3269780	September.
3269780	3274700	In fact, now it's coming out the week of September 28th to compete with Halo.
3274700	3275700	Hooray!
3275700	3280300	That's not the smartest move, but it's nice to see that the game's actually going to be
3280300	3283020	coming out earlier than expected.
3283020	3289020	It is going to be kind of a hack and slash action game, similar to God of War.
3289020	3290020	Lots of blood.
3290020	3294300	I know there's full frontal nudity, so hey, that's got two things that I need and that's
3294300	3296380	probably going to guarantee a sale.
3296380	3297780	I don't know.
3297780	3299960	We don't get enough games with nudity.
3299960	3301700	We need more games with nudity.
3301700	3302700	Damn straight.
3302700	3305380	I want niche nudity games.
3305380	3306880	Manhunt 2 is supposed to have lots.
3306880	3310020	There's a whole S&M club, I guess.
3310020	3312380	Playboy Mansion or whatever, that's niche nudity.
3312380	3316020	I want hardcore nudity in mainstream games.
3316020	3320260	Is that too much to ask for?
3320260	3322180	BMX Triple X was great.
3322180	3323900	That was a bad game, though.
3323900	3324900	I know, but it's...
3324900	3325900	It was not a bad game.
3325900	3326900	It was fun.
3326900	3333180	Dave mirrored BMX and it just had weird shit like, you know, impress a dog so he gets horny
3333180	3334180	and fucks another dog.
3334180	3337420	I mean, just weird shit, but it was just excuses for you to do tricks and stuff.
3337420	3338820	You had to pick up the hooker.
3338820	3339820	And pick up the hookers.
3339820	3341180	I mean, it's a fun game.
3341180	3342500	It's really weird, granted.
3342500	3345020	I think it's a game that makes fun of itself.
3345020	3346020	It is.
3346020	3347020	It is.
3347020	3348020	And it's another one of those games.
3348020	3352740	I kind of have the benchmark where it's stuff that my sister actually plays.
3352740	3356740	It's weird because they like these weird, nichey games like Driver 3 that's completely
3356740	3363060	awful, but they find it fun, just like they find BMX Triple X fun, because it's really
3363060	3364060	weird.
3364060	3367700	You know what really weird game I want them to make a new one of?
3367700	3369020	Jumping Flash.
3369020	3370780	Okay, like, the whole chat...
3370780	3374900	Okay, now like Leo Kristoff in chat says, why do you want to pay for CGI porn and Ross
3374900	3377940	Steele UT says, guy, fuck no, I don't want porn games, really.
3377940	3378940	I didn't...
3378940	3379940	I said, I don't want porn games.
3379940	3383540	I just want, like, you know, random nudity inserted into video games.
3383540	3387620	Like, you know, it's like when you watch a movie, and then like, you know, like you're
3387620	3391060	watching the movie and like, oh, I didn't know I'd get that ass shot, or, oh, tease.
3391060	3392060	Life is Brian.
3392060	3393060	You know?
3393060	3394060	Yeah, or, you know, boop.
3394060	3396900	Where he comes out fully naked and addresses the crowd.
3396900	3397900	Where is that?
3397900	3398900	We just need...
3398900	3400820	It's gotta be porn.
3400820	3401820	It's tasteful.
3401820	3402820	We need random...
3402820	3406780	Artistic purposes, because games are art, after all.
3406780	3409500	We need random occurrences of naked.
3409500	3413460	Of course, I hope you guys know what happens.
3413460	3417860	No ferret bestiality, oh my God, DT, what the hell are you on?
3417860	3419420	I'm half kidding, chat room.
3419420	3421380	I hope you guys know.
3421380	3426740	But there is no kidding around that PC is getting a new version, I'm sorry, is getting
3426740	3430860	a new game called Stranglehold, which of course is coming to all the consoles as well.
3430860	3434300	But Stranglehold is coming out this week on the consoles, but if you want to check out
3434300	3437780	a demo, it's up now.
3437780	3444140	The game ships on September 18th, but the PC demo is available to download right now.
3444140	3450340	So if you want to check that out, go to your favorite downloading site, such as, you know,
3450340	3454020	I don't know, what's a good site that doesn't make you pay to download stuff?
3454020	3457220	Like, you know, because I hate those ones that are like, you know, oh, you get this
3457220	3458220	many spots.
3458220	3459220	Just find a torrent.
3459220	3460220	Yeah, or just find a torrent.
3460220	3461220	Game spots sometimes.
3461220	3462780	That's a legal use of a torrent, so you can go for that.
3462780	3463780	So Stranglehold.
3463780	3467780	By the way, I did want to say this real quick, sorry, is that I thought it was interesting
3467780	3471420	that I, because I want to use this story as an excuse to talk about MySpace and logging
3471420	3472420	on to MySpace lately.
3472420	3474980	I've noticed a lot of ads for Stranglehold on MySpace.
3474980	3476620	I don't know if you guys have noticed this.
3476620	3480860	I mean, usually ads are blocked, but for some reason these show up.
3480860	3485500	And it's just so funny the way they're advertising the game to me is like, more stuff to blow
3485500	3488420	up than any game ever.
3488420	3491100	Just I don't know, it made me laugh.
3491100	3496060	You know what, that would be the whole reason I would buy a game, is explosions.
3496060	3500940	Well, speaking of things that aren't exploding, however, you can probably get some neat pyrotechnics
3500940	3502740	included.
3502740	3507660	More information about Guitar Hero 3 Legends of Rock is that it will be coming out on the
3507660	3509700	PC and the Mac.
3509700	3511460	Games on a Mac!
3511460	3514500	Like snakes on a plane, but not really.
3514500	3521620	It will have the same gameplay, same content as the console versions, unlockable, multiplayer
3521620	3529580	mode, boss battles, I do believe downloadable content, which would make sense.
3529580	3533900	And it's Guitar Hero.
3533900	3540740	And it'll be cracked so wide open that it'll be freely available before you know it.
3540740	3545220	And it's not that, but I'm waiting for people to crack this game to insert their own shit
3545220	3546220	into it.
3546220	3548460	It's been done on Playstation 2 and stuff.
3548460	3549820	It's only a matter of time.
3549820	3554580	I've seen Playstation 2 ones done with Metroid Metal music.
3554580	3558740	And I just want to say though, shortly after the release of this game is when America is
3558740	3563400	going to realize that we're just oversaturated with Guitar Hero crap and I think the series
3563400	3564940	will start to decline.
3564940	3567740	Just about, just like DDR.
3567740	3569740	We'll see, we'll see.
3569740	3570740	Anyways.
3570740	3575340	Ah, so, um, and then my, there we go.
3575340	3579220	Nintendo Midnight 64 mentioned that there's already something like that on PC called Fretz
3579220	3580380	on Fire.
3580380	3583260	And maybe that's why they want to do this, you know, because they realize there is a
3583260	3584980	market for the PC guitars, who knows.
3584980	3587540	Yeah, that's how we get like in the groove.
3587540	3588540	Yay.
3588540	3592060	Um, so, GameStop, once again we're talking about them.
3592060	3596740	Now they're planning on catering to the casual gamer.
3596740	3597740	Yay.
3597740	3602860	Um, apparently they're going to be redesigning their stores or rearranging them, um, kind
3602860	3603860	of as a test.
3603860	3607420	And what they're going to do is they're going to have a couple new sections, including one
3607420	3609780	dedicated to children's and family games.
3609780	3617020	Uh, another section is going to be dedicated to, um, I guess, uh, like music rhythm games.
3617020	3620460	I mean, because there's quite a bit of stuff and I know they try to push a lot of those
3620460	3621460	peripherals.
3621460	3627860	Um, and then I guess they're going to have, uh, new sections for kiosks, I guess one that
3627860	3632220	will also highlight music games and another one that will highlight family games.
3632220	3639500	So new kiosks, new sections, new reason to go to GameStop, probably not.
3639500	3644660	You know what I think GameStop's biggest failure has been lately, is, um, them, uh, not selling
3644660	3648200	anything older than, um, PS2.
3648200	3654460	I had to go to Fry's today, an electronics store nearby that's pretty big, because none
3654460	3660220	of the GameStops within a 111 mile radius had any PSP cables.
3660220	3661220	Awesome.
3661220	3662660	Not cool.
3662660	3665880	Yeah, you can still go to GameCrazy and buy Genesis.
3665880	3667380	There are options, folks.
3667380	3669460	Don't need to necessarily go to GameStop.
3669460	3674600	And also think about this, um, remember I bought the collector's edition of Bioshock
3674600	3677140	so I can get the Big Daddy.
3677140	3680860	Would I really have missed it if I didn't buy the collector's edition?
3680860	3681860	Probably not.
3681860	3686740	So don't be fooled in buying this shit for, like, crappy little trinkets that you probably
3686740	3687740	don't need anyways.
3687740	3690500	GameCrazy needs your money.
3690500	3691500	That's all I'm going to say.
3691500	3693820	Yeah, they need a lot of money.
3693820	3695700	They need a whole lot of money.
3695700	3696700	Anyway.
3696700	3697700	Alright.
3697700	3700460	Well, is that it for the news tonight?
3700460	3701460	I think it is.
3701460	3702460	I think so.
3702460	3705260	So this is where we open up the Skype line and let you guys interact with our program.
3705260	3711260	If you want to give us a call, our phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype
3711260	3716620	is OrangeLoungeRadio and the Skype line is open and you guys can give us a call.
3716620	3717620	So we'll wait for some calls.
3717620	3718620	I don't know.
3718620	3719620	Our listenership seems to be down a little bit tonight.
3719620	3723060	I don't know if that's the Emmys to thank for that or Back to School or the fact that
3723060	3724060	our show just sucks.
3724060	3728420	I don't know what it is, but we don't have a lot of live listeners as much as usual tonight.
3728420	3734000	So I'm hoping that we get some calls at some point, but the line is open.
3734000	3735620	So go ahead and start calling.
3735620	3737820	In the meantime, do we have any last minute stories?
3737820	3739820	Oh yeah.
3739820	3740820	Let's see.
3740820	3741820	Let's start off here.
3741820	3745580	Of course, Colin McRae, he's died in an helicopter crash.
3745580	3752140	You may remember him from such rally racing events that have happened, of course, in Europe
3752140	3759540	and also because he's had his name on various rally racing games, including Dirt, which
3759540	3760860	is actually pretty awesome.
3760860	3764660	But unfortunately, he has passed away.
3764660	3765660	Let's see.
3765660	3772180	Also, I was going to say that China, this is funny, China's gaming companies are trying
3772180	3774540	to combat piracy.
3774540	3775540	I don't know.
3775540	3778940	If that gets you to laugh, I don't know what will, so.
3778940	3779940	Okay.
3779940	3786300	Well, I mean, China is just big on, you know, a ton of pirate stuff coming out of there.
3786300	3787300	Yeah, but that's a scene.
3787300	3792020	You can't, you know, label everybody as, you know, participating in the piracy rings.
3792020	3793020	All right, fine.
3793020	3794020	All right.
3794020	3795020	We got calls on Skype.
3795020	3796020	Let's go to that.
3796020	3797020	We'll get the rest of your stories in a minute.
3797020	3798020	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3798020	3799020	Colin, are you there?
3799020	3800020	Yes, I am.
3800020	3801020	And it's not Raven's Dolphin.
3801020	3803580	Oh, well, who is it then?
3803580	3808580	It's DJ Rama S. Well, hello, DJ Rama S. So somebody different got through first for once
3808580	3809580	this week.
3809580	3810580	All right.
3810580	3811580	What's on your mind, buddy?
3811580	3812580	Not much.
3812580	3817180	I want to make a comment about the whole GameStop thing about the man who got basically
3817180	3820460	suspended for only selling games to smart people.
3820460	3825580	I can't say I don't blame him for doing that because I used to work in a video store and
3825580	3831100	the video store was like right by the schools and they would come in all the time and mess
3831100	3832100	the place up.
3832100	3836540	And then we started doing stuff like that, you know, we started doing like a program
3836540	3840180	where if you had good grades, you get free rentals and stuff.
3840180	3845900	And we were basically like a mom and pop store and we basically knew the families and stuff
3845900	3847980	and they were coming all the time.
3847980	3852540	And we, you know, we basically knew if you weren't doing too well in school and stuff,
3852540	3855740	you weren't renting games at all, as simple as that.
3855740	3859660	Well, I'm sorry, I was typing in chat.
3859660	3860660	What?
3860660	3861660	Sorry.
3861660	3863140	Everybody's like, I'm sorry.
3863140	3864580	Restate your question real quick.
3864580	3868940	No, what I said was I used to work at a mom and pop store and we basically did the same
3868940	3871240	thing what this GameStop manager did.
3871240	3875580	If you were, you know, if you were stupid, you know, like that, we wouldn't rent games
3875580	3876580	to you.
3876580	3877580	Simple as that.
3877580	3878580	Wow.
3878580	3881740	So how, how exactly would you do the whole report card thing, the grades thing?
3881740	3883380	Yeah, that's what we did.
3883380	3884380	Wow.
3884380	3886820	And how did that go over?
3886820	3891380	Basically the parents liked it because one thing was for sure was that, you know, we
3891380	3894740	knew the parents knew, they knew they weren't doing their homework because they were too
3894740	3898820	busy mulling around in our store, checking out the games and stuff like that.
3898820	3903180	We had to like kick them out from time to time and just like, you know, it's like three,
3903180	3906460	three, four o'clock, you've been here over an hour, you should be at home doing your
3906460	3910300	homework instead of drooling over the games that you want to buy or rent.
3910300	3911300	Simple as that.
3911300	3912300	Wow.
3912300	3915620	You know, I don't have a problem with people kicking out lawyers, but I mean, I don't think
3915620	3919660	it's a great business practice to turn away business, especially when most of the mom
3919660	3925180	and pop stores I talk to on a daily basis are having trouble selling games, let alone,
3925180	3927140	you know, they're not like swimming in money.
3927140	3936100	So I wouldn't, I would highly, you know, advise against it despite how tempting it may be.
3936100	3939660	Mystic Gohan says, what if my homework is to play a game?
3939660	3942700	That was from our chat.
3942700	3944620	So that went over okay.
3944620	3946540	There wasn't a lot of controversy there.
3946540	3948420	No, not at all.
3948420	3953740	You know, like I said, we were small, so everybody knew each other and it was pretty cool about
3953740	3955580	it, you know?
3955580	3961940	And I mean, overall, I don't blame this manager for doing it, but it's not his job to be the
3961940	3965280	parent of over these kids, you know?
3965280	3969820	I mean, these parents should be more responsible and stuff like that, you know?
3969820	3970820	That's the way I see it.
3970820	3975380	You know, overall, I give him points for doing that, but not at the risk of your job, you
3975380	3976380	know?
3976380	3977380	All right.
3977380	3981980	Well, thank you for the insight, I guess, from having been working for a game store
3981980	3983540	that used to kind of do this.
3983540	3985780	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
3985780	3987980	No, that's just I just want to throw my two cents about there.
3987980	3988980	That's all.
3988980	3989980	Well, I appreciate it.
3989980	3990980	I'm sorry I missed you the first time.
3990980	3993620	I thought someone else was listening and I was trying to work on a question that got
3993620	3996620	asked in chat, so I didn't want you to feel like I was ignoring you.
3996620	3997620	I'm sorry.
3997620	3999100	We multitask while doing the show.
3999100	4000780	I know that feeling.
4000780	4001780	All right.
4001780	4002780	Take care, buddy.
4002780	4003780	You too.
4003780	4004780	All right.
4004780	4005780	Bye-bye.
4005780	4006780	All right.
4006780	4010940	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is ORANGE LOUNGE
4010940	4014220	RADIO on Skype.
4014220	4016580	Loki give us another last minute story while we wait for another call because there's a
4016580	4017580	bit of a delay.
4017580	4018580	Okay.
4018580	4024220	So Jam Sessions has come out last week, I guess, and funny enough, if you purchase it
4024220	4028740	through Best Buy, you've got three hidden tracks.
4028740	4033060	Well, actually anybody can get the hidden tracks, and funny enough, it's the Konami
4033060	4037500	code which unlocks those hidden tracks, despite the fact that the game's actually being made
4037500	4038660	by Ubisoft.
4038660	4044200	So to unlock Brad Paisley, I'm going to miss her, Jimi Hendrix, Wild Thing, and Tom Petty
4044200	4046240	Needles and Pins.
4046240	4051060	Simply push up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, during free mode, and it will
4051060	4052060	give you those three songs.
4052060	4053060	Wait.
4053060	4054060	And what game is this?
4054060	4055060	Jam Sessions.
4055060	4056900	Isn't this the game that some of our listeners told you to stay away from?
4056900	4057900	Yeah.
4057900	4058900	Oh, okay.
4058900	4059900	All right.
4059900	4060900	Well, let's go to the phones.
4060900	4061900	We've got another call coming in.
4061900	4062900	Hi.
4062900	4063900	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
4063900	4064900	Who's this?
4064900	4065900	This is Jason.
4065900	4066900	Hi, Jason.
4066900	4067900	And we do need a new jumping flash now.
4067900	4068900	Jumping flash.
4068900	4069900	Amen.
4069900	4070900	Oh, man.
4070900	4074260	Jamie said that, and I smiled so big.
4074260	4080100	Jumping flash was my first ever PlayStation game, back when Blockbuster still rented out
4080100	4087940	the systems, and I paid the, what, $150, well, my dad paid the $150 deposit, and I rented
4087940	4093460	the system along with jumping flash and a Revolution X.
4093460	4094460	Revolution X is awesome.
4094460	4096820	Revolution X was awful at home, though.
4096820	4103620	Yeah, it was, but I enjoyed it, and I laughed, and I played it regardless.
4103620	4105740	The only system I ever rented was a Neo Geo.
4105740	4110500	That's why I played Fatal Fury Special at home, which was all sorts of awesome.
4110500	4111500	Let's see.
4111500	4112500	What else was I going to ask about?
4112500	4114300	I'm trying to remember what the first PlayStation game I ever played was.
4114300	4115500	It might have been Final Fantasy VII.
4115500	4116500	I don't think I...
4116500	4117500	Oh, no, no.
4117500	4118500	I remember.
4118500	4119500	I bought my PlayStation with Crash Bandicoot 2.
4119500	4121500	That was the first PlayStation game I ever played.
4121500	4122500	So I got into the PlayStation game a little late.
4122500	4124460	I think that was the one when I actually owned it.
4124460	4125460	Huh?
4125460	4129780	I think Crash Bandicoot was my first game when I actually owned a PlayStation as well.
4129780	4130780	Wow.
4130780	4134740	But as I said, I rented it well before that, and Jumping Flash was my first ever PlayStation
4134740	4135740	game.
4135740	4136740	Mm-hmm.
4136740	4140860	I was a freshman in college, and my roommate's boyfriend had a PlayStation, but my friend
4140860	4146660	had imported a Saturn before, so I'd actually played an import Saturn before we got them
4146660	4147660	over here.
4147660	4148660	You know what would be hilarious?
4148660	4149660	Oh, sorry.
4149660	4156300	I was just thinking, you know how they were talking about Guitar Hero 4 as being, I guess,
4156300	4158060	Aerosmith's going to be the big thing for that.
4158060	4162580	Wouldn't it be hilarious if they had Revolution X as an unlockable in that?
4162580	4163580	I didn't say...
4163580	4165980	Fire CD is for whaling boner.
4165980	4172220	Well, what I was saying about the PlayStation stuff, though, is that my first PlayStation
4172220	4176180	game that I played was Toshinden and Jumping Flash.
4176180	4179180	Those were my first two.
4179180	4182340	And you said you were a freshman in college, and I don't even think I was in middle school
4182340	4183340	at that point.
4183340	4184340	I may have just been, but...
4184340	4185620	Thank you for making me feel old.
4185620	4186620	I'm sorry.
4186620	4187620	I know.
4187620	4188620	I'm sorry.
4188620	4194380	But my first Saturn game that I played was that really crappy Gundam game, and Golden
4194380	4195380	Axe the Duel.
4195380	4199180	I didn't even know they made that game on Saturn.
4199180	4200180	Oh, yeah.
4200180	4201180	It was really...
4201180	4202180	It was actually a good game.
4202180	4206620	I only remember two or three things about the Saturn.
4206620	4213060	One of them was a friend of mine with the extra memory chip or something like that,
4213060	4218020	something along those lines, some kind of an expansion chip, Knights, and some weird
4218020	4219940	mech game that I played at...
4219940	4222060	Oh, I don't even remember where it was anymore.
4222060	4226660	I think it was at Hastings or something like that on one of their demo kiosks, but I next
4226660	4228940	had no idea what it is anymore.
4228940	4232140	Saturn was the machine you had if you were an importer, though, because you had arcade
4232140	4238660	perfect copies of Marvel Super Heroes versus Street Fighters, X-Men versus Street Fighter.
4238660	4243980	You had all the King of Fighters games, even though the load time was just completely ridiculous.
4243980	4244980	Virtual on...
4244980	4254260	Ready for the beginning, CD systems, kind of, for mainstream, that didn't crash horribly.
4254260	4255260	I still...
4255260	4256260	Oh, yeah.
4256260	4258800	And RalstillUT points out that all the working designs games came out for Saturn, like the
4258800	4266620	Rayearth RPG, and I actually did games, though, for the Sega CD, like they did...
4266620	4269340	We had Popful Mail over here from Working Designs.
4269340	4276980	But yeah, Fighters Megamix, Sephiroth 1215s us, but the Saturn just completely kicked
4276980	4279780	the PlayStation's ass, and I'm sorry that it did so badly over here.
4279780	4280780	Oh, of course.
4280780	4281780	Oh, and Puzzle Fighter.
4281780	4286060	Thank you to the people that did own the Saturn, the notion that that was the importer's console.
4286060	4289220	Yes, that was very true, now that I think about it.
4289220	4294140	It's funny, Dan and I used to hook up our Saturn and our PlayStation and have the same
4294140	4297900	games in them, because we actually had a few of the games that were the same on both systems,
4297900	4301780	and we would compare what they looked like, and the Saturn was it for anything that was
4301780	4304740	2D or required a lot of memory.
4304740	4310460	Even though the PlayStation was built for 3D, we compared Symphony of the Night, because
4310460	4315980	I have the Japanese one on the Saturn, and all the 3D effects looked a lot better on
4315980	4322580	the PlayStation, of course, but all of the sprites and the music was better on the Saturn,
4322580	4325100	because I think the Saturn had a better sound processor.
4325100	4330020	The music being better was really common to pretty much every game on the Saturn, wasn't
4330020	4331020	it?
4331020	4332020	I think so.
4332020	4333020	Well, a lot of things...
4333020	4334020	I remember hearing something along those lines.
4334020	4337500	They did have a lot of games, too, that were Red Book, and also other games that were pointed
4337500	4345140	out were Guardian Heroes, Panzer Dragoon, Sonic Jam, Silhouette Mirage, Dragon Force.
4345140	4348860	Sonic Jam, yes, that one is a very big deal.
4348860	4354780	I remember my girlfriend really complaining about Sonic Jam's collection and the fact
4354780	4361740	that they used the Sega CD version of Sonic Jam instead of the Saturn version, because
4361740	4369820	the Saturn version actually had the true epic music composed to synthesized, MIDI-ish track
4369820	4370820	version.
4370820	4375300	And that's, yes, the world of difference right there.
4375300	4378900	Wow, it's like a trip down memory lane here.
4378900	4386300	Well, also, for me being an importer, I actually lucked into a copy of Grandia on Saturn, and
4386300	4391420	comparing that to the PlayStation 1, oh my God, the PlayStation 1 was crap.
4391420	4396620	Even the 3D was crap in it, and it was so much better on Saturn.
4396620	4400780	The music, you actually had a bigger view field, so you could see more stuff that was
4400780	4402300	going on in the game.
4402300	4404220	The timing was better.
4404220	4406980	Everything came out so much better on the Saturn version.
4406980	4410500	All right, Sega fanboys, we gotta wrap up and go to another call.
4410500	4414860	Jason, any last thoughts quickly before we move on?
4414860	4422740	Bust-A-Move Bash with the Wii controller is absolutely, it makes so much sense, it plays
4422740	4425300	so well, it is very, very fun.
4425300	4427180	What game?
4427180	4431900	Bust-A-Move Bash, it's like a puzzle game where you can play up to eight players at
4431900	4432900	one time.
4432900	4436500	My mind went to the old dance game, and I was like, there's a fucking new Bust-A-Move
4436500	4437500	out?
4437500	4441140	I knew it would have, I should have said Puzzle Bobble Bash, because it would make more sense
4441140	4442140	to you pretty much immediately.
4442140	4443140	No, that's all right, okay.
4443140	4448580	Bust-A-Move Bash for the Wii, the Wiimote control is so intuitive, it is so easy to
4448580	4450420	pick up and play, it is so fun.
4450420	4451420	Really?
4451420	4452420	Might have to check it out.
4452420	4453420	Yes.
4453420	4454420	All right.
4454420	4455420	It's pretty cheap.
4455420	4456420	Give it a shot.
4456420	4457420	It's fun.
4457420	4462140	Even though I've played this game like 50 times, this will be worth it, right?
4462140	4465220	You might want to play it on mute, I'll warn you that.
4465220	4466220	If you don't...
4466220	4468900	Well, maybe I can use my custom soundtrack for the Winamp, hopefully.
4468900	4469900	We'll see.
4469900	4470900	Oh, yeah, that's true, huh?
4470900	4471900	Who knows?
4471900	4472900	I haven't gotten that yet.
4472900	4473900	I need to.
4473900	4476900	All right, Jason, we've got to let you go, but have a good one, okay, buddy?
4476900	4477900	You too.
4477900	4478900	All right, bye-bye.
4478900	4479900	Goodnight.
4479900	4484420	Thanks for hearing from Jason, our fearless webmaster, for OrangeLunchRadio.com.
4484420	4487580	We'll probably take one more call, then we're going to call it a night, because we are running
4487580	4488580	a little bit long tonight.
4488580	4490300	I don't know what's going on with that.
4490300	4493300	Another last-minute story real quick, Loki, if you have any more.
4493300	4494300	Yeah.
4494300	4495300	Do you have any?
4495300	4496300	I have a whole ton.
4496300	4499300	Anyways, they were talking a little bit bizarre.
4499300	4503460	They were talking about Project Anthem Racing 5 and what they want to do with that.
4503460	4509540	One thing that they're looking to do is possibly off-road stuff, including quad bikes and off-road
4509540	4510540	tracks.
4510540	4511540	So, that's kind of neat.
4511540	4513220	All right, we've got another call real quick.
4513220	4514620	Hi, you're on OrangeLunchRadio.
4514620	4515620	Who's this?
4515620	4516620	GS68.
4516620	4517860	Well, hello, GS68.
4517860	4519060	What's on your mind, buddy?
4519060	4524780	Yeah, you know the thing about the New Jersey parents reacting to the Wii Zapper?
4524780	4527340	I'm sorry, the parents that are getting mad about the Wii Zapper?
4527340	4528340	Yeah, yeah.
4528340	4529340	I was particularly offended.
4529340	4533980	I mean, for fuck's sake, I grew up with light gun games.
4533980	4537900	And are you thinking about going and shooting actual people?
4537900	4539180	No.
4539180	4544260	You know, and I wonder, at the carnivals, even before the days of video games, I mean,
4544260	4548740	they still have the county fairs and the state fairs and the various carnivals around.
4548740	4552420	Don't they have those BB gun shooting games where you shoot pellets, as many pellets as
4552420	4556220	you can through the little silhouette, and if you can punch out the star completely,
4556220	4557220	you get a prize?
4557220	4558220	They have better than that now.
4558220	4559220	That's true.
4559220	4560700	They have to shoot the paintballs at the man thing.
4560700	4561700	Cool.
4561700	4564740	They have a guy in riot gear, and you can shoot him with paintballs.
4564740	4565740	Wow.
4565740	4568140	And don't they have, they also have a shooting range.
4568140	4572540	You know, remember, like that fucking thing they have at Scandia, that's like that whole
4572540	4575460	elaborate set up, like the Wild West, you can shoot like...
4575460	4577460	I think they have one of those at Tilt.
4577460	4582820	Okay, so anyway, I mean, yeah, these types of games existed long before video games,
4582820	4587500	so these are just a couple of dumbasses who somehow got their name in the media.
4587500	4589180	And don't you mean start it with Nerf guns?
4589180	4592420	I mean, they're obviously for kids, and they shoot real projectiles.
4592420	4593420	Or Super Soaker.
4593420	4594800	I keep thinking of that one commercial.
4594800	4596060	It's all over YouTube.
4596060	4599820	It doesn't worry us, it says not to shoot someone in the face with it.
4599820	4600820	Anyway.
4600820	4602540	I like getting Super Soakers and putting ink in them.
4602540	4604260	Why would you do that?
4604260	4605260	That's mean.
4605260	4606900	We used to when I was in middle school.
4606900	4608100	Why would you do that?
4608100	4609100	Because we were mean.
4609100	4610780	You were a bad child.
4610780	4612980	I should take it back.
4612980	4616060	Well, yeah, I agree with you, GS68.
4616060	4617060	These people are dumbasses.
4617060	4618060	But what can you do?
4618060	4621620	In every village, there's an idiot, right?
4621620	4622620	Yeah.
4622620	4626140	Well, any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?
4626140	4627140	I don't think so.
4627140	4628140	All right.
4628140	4629140	Well, thank you for your rant.
4629140	4630140	We appreciate it.
4630140	4631140	And it fits in well with our program.
4631140	4632140	No problem.
4632140	4633140	All right.
4633140	4634140	Bye-bye, dude.
4634140	4635140	See ya.
4635140	4636140	All right.
4636140	4638980	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
4638980	4640140	Thank you to those that got through.
4640140	4641720	Sorry to those that didn't.
4641720	4646380	The new Skype is so weird because I can't, like...
4646380	4651460	If five calls are coming in at once, I have to hang up on four to answer the one.
4651460	4655420	And then the people that I hung up on will try to call right back.
4655420	4656660	So I can never pick up a call.
4656660	4659820	So now I have to force the calls to go to voicemail if we're already in a call.
4659820	4664460	But then the people that keep calling back in seem to get right through.
4664460	4666100	It's really weird.
4666100	4667100	But I don't know.
4667100	4668100	We'll see.
4668100	4669100	We'll see what we can do with Skype.
4669100	4670100	I just want the old version back.
4670100	4671100	Okay.
4671100	4672100	Sorry.
4672100	4673100	Sorry.
4673100	4674100	Last minute news.
4674100	4677780	To go back to what we were talking about earlier, Eternal Sonata has definitely been confirmed
4677780	4679180	for the PlayStation 3.
4679180	4682820	In fact, it will be shown at Tokyo Game Show in video form only.
4682820	4687220	And there's actually some updates on what the PlayStation 3 will have that the Xbox
4687220	4693620	360 won't, including new playable characters and a new clothing system in the works.
4693620	4695460	So that's kind of interesting.
4695460	4696660	And I guess...
4696660	4700220	That is interesting with the release of the game in the U.S. only days away.
4700220	4703920	Now they're telling us, oh, wait, maybe you want to wait for the PlayStation 3 version.
4703920	4712900	For those who love the game's characters will want to pay attention to Bandai Namco is also
4712900	4717300	working on a costume system that will allow you to freely change your character's costumes.
4717300	4720100	Accompanying this is an increase in costume variations.
4720100	4725340	So unfortunately, PlayStation 3 owners will have to wait until 2008 to get their hands
4725340	4727740	on this RPG update.
4727740	4729940	So that was kind of funny.
4729940	4737460	And some other things, real quick, Hot Shots Golf Online is coming out on PSP.
4737460	4740460	That's another thing that's going to be shown at Tokyo Game Show.
4740460	4746540	As well as there's going to be a free online RPG coming to the PlayStation 3 from Q Entertainment.
4746540	4747740	That is interesting.
4747740	4749060	I guess it's going to be...
4749060	4751780	Oh, God, I hope that's not the actual...
4751780	4752780	Oh, no.
4752780	4755580	It's the one we were talking about before, Angel Love Online.
4755580	4760060	I think it's the one where you have to have sex with people and you get impregnated or
4760060	4761060	something.
4761060	4762060	What?
4762060	4763060	What?
4763060	4764060	There was one, though.
4764060	4765060	I saw this on Kotaku.
4765060	4766060	From Q Entertainment?
4766060	4767060	No.
4767060	4768060	No.
4768060	4769060	There's something else.
4769060	4770060	Angel Love Online is what it's called.
4770060	4771860	But I swear to God, I thought there was something that you had to impregnate women or something
4771860	4776940	and then you created new characters based off that or something.
4776940	4778940	There was some weird thing about that.
4778940	4782860	Anyways, other things to note real quick.
4782860	4787380	There's another rumor coming from 1UP's podcast saying that Kingdom Hearts Zero is going to
4787380	4793500	be announced at Tokyo Game Show and that Crisis Core is not the last Final Fantasy VII game.
4793500	4797060	I can only hope that Crisis Core is the last Final Fantasy VII game.
4797060	4798780	There is way too damn many.
4798780	4799780	You know what?
4799780	4802440	Kingdom Hearts Zero would make a lot of sense because the creators come out and said the
4802440	4804380	next game is not Kingdom Hearts 3.
4804380	4806660	That would be a cute little trick to play.
4806660	4808300	It's actually Kingdom Hearts Zero.
4808300	4809300	But here's the thing.
4809300	4812820	If it doesn't have the Disney tie-in this time, like if that's their way to not have
4812820	4814900	Disney tie-ins this time, I'm not buying it.
4814900	4818620	I'm sorry, but the Disney tie-ins make that game.
4818620	4822500	And then the other thing, this is kind of going to DDR Universe.
4822500	4828820	Apparently, if you were one of those people that downloaded the download content for Universe
4828820	4834620	1, it will not be compatible with Universe 2, unlike the UltraMix series where all your
4834620	4839460	download content was transferable to each additional game.
4839460	4845460	So sucks if you downloaded that one thing that they had.
4845460	4846820	So that's interesting.
4846820	4852260	Well, I think this is kind of cool, something I wouldn't mind looking forward to.
4852260	4859020	Actually the developer that brought us R-Type, Irem, they're bringing out SteamBot 2 on PS3
4859020	4860820	for anyone who's interested.
4860820	4870100	Over in Japan, it's Bumpy Trot, but it's a non-linear action-adventure game.
4870100	4874660	And there's a comparison made between GTA and Harvest Moon, so I think that'd be pretty
4874660	4875660	cool.
4875660	4877540	It'll be announced at Tokyo Game Show.
4877540	4881220	GTA meets Harvest Moon, that's awesome.
4881220	4882220	I would exactly...
4882220	4884100	Milk my cow, now die!
4884100	4887660	No, it is not that good of a game, trust me.
4887660	4890300	That would be awesome.
4890300	4891900	Grand Theft Farmer.
4891900	4894460	Yeah, that's not quite...
4894460	4896260	That's it.
4896260	4900180	Alright, well then if that's it for the last minute stories, then that means it's time
4900180	4901740	to wrap up this damn show.
4901740	4904300	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
4904300	4906380	We'll start off with Loki tonight.
4906380	4907380	Loki, what's your final thought?
4907380	4912300	My final thought is I don't want to see the next Resident Evil movie.
4912300	4916540	My final thought is I am craving a Marie Callender's pie right now.
4916540	4918820	I want pies so bad it hurts.
4918820	4923260	I had to buy a pie for a potluck and then we left before we even got to dessert.
4923260	4926140	So my poor pie, I had to leave.
4926140	4927140	Now I crave a pie.
4927140	4928140	Poor baby.
4928140	4929140	I know, poor me.
4929140	4930900	Dark Soccer, your final thought?
4930900	4937540	I have to wake up at 4 in the morning because I have to be at work at 6 so that I can leave
4937540	4941340	at 10 and go to a dentist appointment.
4941340	4945540	Fortunately for me, it's just a routine cleaning and I always fall asleep.
4945540	4946540	And then I get to go home.
4946540	4947540	Lucky you.
4947540	4949020	It's because I hate the dentist.
4949020	4953660	These very comfortable chairs at my dentist's office and they're cushy and they're completely
4953660	4954820	ergonomic.
4954820	4958940	So when you're laying in them, you're not like, you know, sections propped up.
4958940	4962780	It's completely curved to your body shape with like memory foam and shit.
4962780	4965420	And I'm like, I'm going to pass out now.
4965420	4968220	Do whatever you want to to my teeth.
4968220	4969220	It's great.
4969220	4970220	Lucky you.
4970220	4971220	That's all I have to say.
4971220	4972220	I love my dentist.
4972220	4973220	All right.
4973220	4974220	Well, that's going to do it for the show tonight.
