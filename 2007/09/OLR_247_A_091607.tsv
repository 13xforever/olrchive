14002	20372	Tonight, September 16th, 2007, some cult games from the last generation are coming to Xbox 360.
20493	24319	A retro CD-based system is coming soon to Wii's Virtual Console.
24399	26763	And do M-rated games sell better than other games?
32526	36650	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36690	42354	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42675	43615	My name is Rob Roberts.
43715	44796	You might know me as Sky.
45137	49180	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
49460	50021	What?
50521	51562	How are you, DarkSakura?
52783	55245	I'm sorry to inconvenience you with our little program tonight.
55305	55946	I was busy.
56526	57947	Busy doing what, might I ask?
57987	58828	Petting my ferret.
58968	59689	Petting your ferret?
60354	62536	Is that a euphemism for something?
63176	63917	Maybe I shouldn't ask.
63977	65598	Say hello to the Tech Master, Loki!
66059	66299	Hello.
66639	67320	How are you doing, Loki?
68040	69161	I'm doing fine.
69562	70062	I'm glad to hear it.
70082	70582	Just fine?
71183	83693	Well, I'm trying to get... I have a custom firmware on my PSP Slim, and I'm trying to get it to run ISOs, but I think that there's been some changes versus what I was running before, so... Gotcha.
84113	86075	Well, happy birthday.
86155	87076	A little late, by the way.
87576	87836	Thank you.
87856	88057	Mr. Loki.
88117	88497	Mr. Loki.
89205	90766	and I hope you had a good one.
90786	95369	But I'm sure you'll tell us all about your little birthday gathering last night in a minute during How Was Your Gaming Week.
96269	98050	But yeah, we're going to start off with How Was Your Gaming Week.
98070	99411	I want to introduce the chat room though.
99551	100992	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
101012	104094	If you're listening to us live here on this Sunday evening, you can join our chat room.
104694	105474	Just head on over there.
105735	108476	And of course, if you aren't listening live, just join us sometime.
108496	111558	We tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
112023	118026	on our live 365 feed, and now we have a webcam on Operator11.com, although I don't know, the webcam feed's not that exciting.
118046	122428	You just kind of like see my face looking at the camera and Loki's back because of the way the room's set up.
122688	127310	But I'm hoping when we finally move the show out into the bigger room, we'll have more stuff to look at.
127410	128951	So this is all warm-up.
129711	132072	This is all the pre.
132132	132912	This is the foreplay.
133693	134253	That's exactly right.
134273	135734	This is the foreplay with the camera.
135774	136054	Thank you.
137049	138370	DarkSakura, always the witty one.
138410	139470	Alright, how was your gaming week?
139630	145712	Since we don't have guests here tonight to introduce, after last week's cluster fuck of people, it's an empty house tonight.
146232	147533	We're just feeling the love, the three of us.
147573	148113	DarkSakura.
148473	149373	I didn't play anything.
150074	150554	Nothing?
150854	151974	Except World Cup Soccer.
152534	162738	Oh, and we had Uno going on in my house, because Dan's buddy Will has decided that he loves Uno now, and has been doing what he calls ultimate dickery games.
164949	166730	What Pray Tell is an ultimate dickery game.
166750	168191	Well, actually I've been calling it that.
168211	169611	He's just calling it being an asshole.
170592	176875	As in doing all the make you draw until you get the card and doing extra draws for challenges and things like that.
177115	178636	And then he's doing challenges all the time.
179296	181897	So he's just being a complete asshole and he's doing it on purpose.
182458	186019	So like setting it to like the maximum cards you can possibly draw and all that stuff?
186099	186520	Yeah.
186680	186980	I see.
187560	191022	And I think, I don't know if he's doing it under Dan's gamertag though.
191322	192522	I think he's doing it under his own.
192943	193423	Or yours.
193443	193603	Yeah.
193715	196396	DarkSakura again, you love that World Cup Soccer Because it's the best pinball machine ever
222322	223123	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
249657	250377	Uh-oh.
250978	254199	Dear PlayNC, please work on the weekends, not love me.
255899	256279	P.S.
257080	257500	Crap.
258620	260001	All right, well, then we'll go to Loki.
260041	261041	Loki, how was your gaming week?
261781	262261	It was good.
262341	265162	I took two days off this week to play games.
265703	268564	Unfortunately, during those two days, I really only played Bioshock.
268764	270624	I did finish it, though, so that's good.
271565	274506	And unfortunately, I forgot to do a few things.
276004	276825	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
299412	303517	It's a pretty cool twist and you don't realize it throughout most of the game.
304118	306501	I guess you kind of pick up on it a little bit as you go through.
306541	313431	But it's also good to note that those audio diaries kind of tell more of the backstory.
313451	315494	They're not just there for achievements and stuff.
316964	318805	Definitely check those out while you're playing the game.
319606	324308	And then other things, like I mentioned, I bought a PSP Slim.
324428	332613	It is very light, and of course the first thing I do to it, I hacked it and tried to put a custom firmware on it.
332873	335655	Now I have three PSPs for some reason.
337984	341826	and I just bought the cables for a video out today so I haven't tried that yet.
342006	351770	What is going to be pretty cool though is when I do get the homebrew on there because I'll be able to hook it up to my TV and play around with that and play Nintendo games on my TV I guess.
352310	354491	Though I can do that with like five other systems.
355872	357092	I don't know.
357513	365136	And then I've been trying to get my PS2 back from my sister so I can play the beta that got leaked out for Manhunt 2 because that's supposed to be good.
366316	373901	Other things I played during the week, more Call of Duty 4 beta, I still suck at it, but it's going to be great, can't wait for the game to come out.
375122	383747	Of course, more Saints Row multiplayer at work, and they're kind of getting frustrated with me because I keep winning a lot, and buy a lot.
384408	387770	So, sorry, it just... And you're so humble too.
387930	394374	Well, I don't play it that much, I only play it at work, and so everyone thinks I'm practicing or something, I really don't, and...
395179	396780	It's not like I'm that good or anything.
396840	397200	I don't know.
399641	401362	And then I'm trying to think what else.
401922	403823	I played some Xbox Live Arcade games.
404643	408865	I played a little bit more Worms, and that's just kind of, I don't know.
409425	415047	I don't even know if I want to play that to get achievement points, but yeah, I think that's pretty much it.
415067	416568	Yeah, Worms was better like 10 years ago.
416808	417348	Exactly.
417448	419209	I love Worms Armageddon.
419429	424351	That was like the ultimate for me, and then it just kind of, they haven't done anything with it since.
424912	428055	Worms Armageddon other than make it worse.
429977	431558	So that's about it so far.
432419	436503	I got the Ratchet and Clank demo but I didn't get to play it yet for PS3.
436563	437524	You will be playing that soon.
437684	437865	Yes.
439639	450265	Well, my gaming week, I've of course been playing more Final Fantasy XI, and it's pretty awesome because Shane, before he left town, he actually got me a clock for Final Fantasy XI, which is actually pretty hilarious.
450645	452446	It's a little Vanadil clock.
452486	459010	It actually shows you what time it is in Vanadil along with the Earth time, and it sets these little alarms that you can set on it.
459070	459671	It's so funny.
459951	461352	This is like for the totally hardcore gamer.
461552	463133	But when the timers run out, this is the best part.
463193	465574	It plays like little music box music.
466094	467155	Hold on, let me see if I can get one to play.
473783	474564	Final Fantasy XI in a Window
499205	505748	So instead of sitting there looking for a party doing absolutely nothing, I can actually sit there and surf the internet while I wait and look for a party.
505788	506568	It's the best thing ever.
507269	510990	Now, Windoward does have some cheats built in, but I don't use them because that's how people get caught.
511250	512071	And I don't want to cheat.
512151	513852	I think cheating in MMOs is screwed up.
514172	517493	But I don't see too much of the harm between flipping between different windows.
517533	520054	I mean, I used to have my laptop over here and doing that.
520094	521255	World of Warcraft, you can.
521315	521895	Guild Wars, you can.
521915	524076	Yeah, so I don't think it's a big deal about that.
524476	526977	So there you have it.
528058	528358	Let's see.
529625	529925	Uh-oh.
531166	532107	Is our feed dropping?
532548	532728	No?
533028	533929	It said it was lagging.
534029	534890	It said it was lagging?
534990	536831	All right, our chatroom's saying the feed's screwing up.
537252	539574	If the feed keeps screwing up too bad, I guess we'll have to kill Operator 11.
539814	540975	I hope we don't have to do that.
541355	541696	We'll see.
541976	543117	But I'm looking in the chatroom here.
543895	545377	And I'm looking at what the chat was saying.
545397	546478	They played their gaming week.
546618	549101	We have a lot of, like, threes in the gaming week.
549141	551644	Like, I see a lot of Metroid Prime 3s people have been playing.
552705	554467	Nintendo Maniac 64 says Metroid Prime 3.
554927	556289	HitStun says Quake 3.
556809	558150	RawSteelUT says Persona 3.
559091	561374	And then SonOfDad has been watching The Office Season 3.
562075	562515	There you go.
563136	563296	Huh.
563649	578748	and then also I've been playing on the DS Planet Puzzle League because Planet Puzzle League is all kinds of awesome and trying to get more people on my friends list though so I'll be posting my code in our little thread we have there on the forums over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com trying to get more friends for Planet Puzzle League that I can play against.
578888	580130	I bought that
580791	582592	A pink DS Lite for Nelly.
583072	587935	So now she has her own gaming system to play with.
588455	589495	Without having to bling it out?
590416	591116	Yeah.
591436	592397	And I just got her today.
592437	594238	I got her a pink case to go with it.
596006	596907	She's all pinked out.
597327	602769	So before we get into housekeeping and gaming news tonight, let's talk about your birthday gathering, Loki.
602789	605290	You didn't mention anything about our little trip this week.
605431	607872	Oh yeah, we went to... The real life game we played this week.
608012	615735	Yeah, we went to Stars in Vacaville, which is this bowling alley slash entertainment center.
616195	621578	It's got Cusar laser tag in there, which I think is the best laser tag game ever.
622267	624468	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
652857	662926	They claim that their computer system is broken so that they can't change the game settings, which is bullshit because they said the same thing last time and I yelled at them and they finally did it.
664368	667571	And then also the people that work there are complete morons.
667631	670113	In fact, they didn't really give a shit about anything.
670233	675558	I mean, the second game, for example, we beat the other team by 800 points.
676258	677419	That game was awesome.
677439	679061	It was just the worst game.
679660	682082	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
700382	705006	He had a pack that said that he only fired five shots and hit 59 people.
706027	706868	His hit ratio is 100%.
706948	709610	That's like ultimate bounce.
709871	713474	And he never got hit, which is complete bullshit.
714275	715836	He fired a lot more than five shots.
716256	720000	It's just the game was so fucked up and they really don't care.
720220	721421	So why don't you open your own?
722242	724104	Because it costs a lot of money to do that.
724964	725605	Can you get a loan?
726783	730565	Not that kind of a loan right now, because I don't have property or any sort of collateral to go with it.
730605	737309	I mean, a car, but it's going to cost at least half a million dollars to open one of those places.
737529	740852	I'd love to do it, because it's not that fucking hard.
740872	749397	I mean, shit, if they can run a laser tag place there, and it may be poorly run, but they have just two people doing it, it can be done.
750166	779132	Not to mention, other than Lasertag, we were just getting, like, drinks in between games and stuff, and the fucker, and they have this, like, little cafe or something that you can buy food at, and they had one person working there, pretty much, at the counter, and I guess running food also, so it took us ten minutes to get a fucking soda, because you kept, you know, helping other people, and, you know, people, I guess you fucked up orders and stuff like that, so it was just really horrible, and none of the equipment at the Lasertag place was even, you know,
779639	781702	Looked like it had been repaired in years.
781923	784006	It's just really fallen apart.
784447	786150	So, fuck them.
786470	787372	We will not be coming back.
789069	793171	I want to point out, last night was the first time I've seen a DDR machine in a long time, too.
793431	797873	But the thing I thought was interesting is I kind of assumed that DDR was kind of dead.
798213	800374	And I know this might piss a lot of people off.
800434	804755	Obviously, our show started a long time ago about DDR.
804795	807737	We all met playing Dance Dance Revolution and everything, so I know it's kind of funny I'm saying this now.
808017	811958	But I kind of thought most people played Dance Dance Revolution at home now, because that's where all the new stuff comes out, is home.
811978	813759	And there's been some pretty decent mixes we've gotten.
814059	814680	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
825522	826723	Some kid was doing Max 300.
827764	830266	It's like you're not cool unless you can do Max 300 these days.
830286	831246	Well, he worked there, too.
831306	833568	He was the one that marshaled their second game.
833588	834068	Oh, wow.
834348	835709	I wouldn't even call it marshalling.
836330	840012	For example, I was arguing with him because he's like, yeah, those two packs in the back work.
840052	842374	I'm like, no, we played those packs last game.
842414	843355	They're fucking broken.
843615	844035	Oh, Lord.
844115	845556	And the laser doesn't shoot straight.
846077	847938	He's like, well, you mean the laser?
848258	850139	I'm like, no, the emitter does not shoot straight.
850339	851841	Oh, well, they're still working.
851901	853762	I'm like, no, they're not, you fucking retard.
855134	856794	I just hate talking to them.
856834	858535	Especially when they're saying that their system's working.
858555	860855	I'm like, do I need to come back there and set up my own damn game?
860875	861775	Because I know how to do it.
863556	864076	Interesting.
865516	868717	I just thought it was interesting that there's still that whole little community for DDR.
868737	869257	But that's cool.
869357	870357	I'm really glad.
871117	872798	Even though I kind of thought it was dead.
872918	874798	Just because there hasn't been a whole lot of new stuff.
875518	878799	I mean, Supernova didn't bring a whole lot of new stuff to the table besides new songs.
878859	879859	So I was just kind of surprised.
880179	880459	That's all.
881639	882720	So call me a cynic, whatever.
882740	883780	We need Supernova too.
884760	885000	Shut up.
885543	885823	All right.
887205	889126	Anyhow, let's see.
889227	892029	Let's get into some housekeeping for tonight, of which we don't really have much.
892770	893831	There's not a whole lot to say.
895974	899917	I will plug our MySpace and LiveJournal communities and ways you can interact with us online.
899937	904580	Of course, there's our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com, or we have a MySpace as well.
904600	906742	You should add us, and we'll be your friend on MySpace.
907142	913447	Sometimes we post little things up there, a little special, especially like bonus shows and weird things we tape other places.
913967	917590	For instance, we taped a show at an anime con earlier this year that you could only get in our communities.
917890	919692	So it's MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
919712	921613	You can add us there, or you can add us on LiveJournal.
922134	924816	Our community on LiveJournal is also Orange Lounge Radio.
925356	925836	So there you go.
926056	928038	Actually, no, I think we're Orange Lounge on LiveJournal.
928298	928818	I can't remember.
929298	932120	I think that I don't remember.
932140	933080	I think I don't remember.
934661	935321	I don't remember either.
935341	936742	I think we're just Orange Lounge on LiveJournal.
936882	937783	I'm trying to look right now.
939183	940344	This is great radio, I know.
940464	942265	This is the best radio ever, Rob.
942285	943746	I'm really excited to be a part of this.
945267	946708	It's just completely amazing.
946788	950770	Next time before I... Yeah, we're just Orange Lounge on LiveJournal.
950850	952711	There you go.
952791	953131	Let's see.
955301	957963	Ryoma says Wii Online laser tag.
958083	958464	Dude.
959384	960165	Would that be awesome?
960285	962767	An online laser tag with a Wii?
962987	963668	I don't know.
964669	967791	You know what would have been awesome is Metroid Prime 3 online, but that's just me.
969753	971214	Yeah, that'd be awesome.
972055	975157	There was some actual online content with the Wii.
975437	979581	Let's get into some gaming news since we've given the communities ample plugging.
980181	980441	Yes.
981582	982423	Big news coming up.
982879	997067	Just before Tokyo Game Show here, including some big announcements, including the inclusion of Rez Ikaruga Exit and more on Xbox Live Arcade, which is really awesome.
998187	999608	This news makes me so happy.
1000168	1000629	Rez.
1000769	1001269	Rez.
1001469	1001929	Rez.
1001969	1003090	Rez.
1003450	1007252	They need to do a new trans-vibrator thing.
1008173	1008573	I doubt it.
1008653	1008813	No.
1010383	1014405	Microsoft had their pre-show conference.
1015305	1019748	Tetsuya Mizuguchi, of course, they're confirming that both...
1020700	1026342	and his, I guess, remake of Rez, Rez HD, which is pretty much just Rez in high definition, yay.
1027582	1039807	And then, of course, Ikaruga, Exit, which has appeared on the PSP, and, of course, some that have already been announced already, Every Extend, Extra Extreme, and, of course, Omega 5.
1039987	1041567	Also known as E!
1042528	1044728	Sorry, I'm going to my happy place right now.
1044888	1046669	And Trigger Heart, Alexia.
1047504	1048165	You know what, though?
1048185	1049446	Have I mentioned I love titsy music?
1049466	1051207	You know what would make me happier with all of that?
1051788	1054970	If they're giving us Ikaruga, why can't they give us another release of Radiant Silvergun?
1055010	1055751	Wrong twice now.
1057112	1062436	Anyways, lots of awesome games coming to Xbox Live Arcade, so... Yay!
1062556	1063176	I'm excited.
1063497	1064677	I'll definitely be buying Rez.
1066079	1069001	Jamie, explain for our listeners what makes Rez so awesome.
1070322	1071563	Thump, thump, thump.
1072975	1076919	I can't explain what makes Rez so great, but it's totally just one of those trippy things.
1077339	1078580	It's like playing Vib Ribbon.
1079001	1084486	It reminds me of those old trance music videos that you used to see on MTV's Amp, like really late at night.
1084506	1086868	You remember that show Amp, back when MTV actually played videos?
1087148	1088849	It would come on like 12 or 1 in the morning.
1089270	1091612	It reminded me of that show, except you were playing it.
1092293	1098295	And the cool thing about Rez is that, like, as you're, you know, flying around shooting things, the little, like, lasers and stuff are all in time with the music.
1098355	1101976	I can't explain it, but it's just, it's like seriously one of those games you just zone out to.
1102236	1102656	Vibramin.
1102736	1104516	I can't think of any better way to explain it.
1105057	1107137	Vibramin's kind of like that, but not to the extent that Rez is.
1107157	1112719	You don't zone out on it, but Vibramin is definitely trippy enough that you have to blink again when you move your eyes away from the screen.
1113199	1114439	There you go.
1114499	1120501	TigerClaw in our chat room at chat.orangelearnsradio.com says, I guess Rez is the kind of game you play if you want to create your own personal rave.
1121201	1121481	Sort of.
1122233	1122494	Sort of.
1122514	1123696	There you go.
1123716	1125019	Fucking awesome at a rave, I think.
1125841	1127444	Can you imagine playing that just at a rave?
1128326	1130250	Huge, you know, giant screen.
1130270	1131352	That might be a way to kind of do it.
1131372	1132554	People tripping out and stuff.
1132635	1133196	That'd be awesome.
1133396	1133717	All right.
1134269	1136490	So I'm very, very happy about this news.
1136650	1138210	It definitely takes me to my happy place.
1139090	1142971	Exit, I haven't really checked out before, so I'm kind of interested in it.
1143212	1147293	Well, I never played it, but a lot of people love it, so it's one of those kind of niche things.
1147333	1149953	But just like Ikaruga was one of those niche games.
1150174	1152174	By chance, did they say when this... Ikaruga was awesome.
1152214	1153995	Did they say when this all was coming out?
1154135	1158536	I know some of that list, like the Omega 5 was supposed to be due out in November, so...
1159296	1165880	and soon, I know, was Every Extend Extra Extreme is supposed to be coming out this year as well, I think.
1166721	1167081	Nice.
1167501	1169903	I actually, I liked Every Extend Extra on the PSP.
1169923	1171484	That's another one of those just like totally chill out games.
1171504	1172305	I need to borrow that from you.
1172925	1173245	You want to?
1173285	1173786	I'll go get it.
1173886	1174126	Okay.
1174186	1175827	This is an awesome game for PSP, so.
1176522	1181563	Elite Beat Agents Elite Beat Agents Elite Beat Agents Elite Beat Agents Elite Beat Agents
1205387	1208029	Now, that doesn't mean it's Elite Beat Agents 360.
1208149	1210791	Like, you know, that would be really hard, because there's no touchscreen on the 360.
1211171	1215053	But it's just kind of cool that the development team is developing something for another system.
1215634	1220177	They're not just going to keep games on the DS, so they are making something on the Xbox 360.
1220217	1226021	It should be said that some of the other games that this company has made, Guitaruman was another game that they made.
1226081	1227642	So, maybe Guitaruman 360?
1227682	1230524	That'd be kind of rad.
1231284	1234046	Well, it was really just more like a Guitaruman remix on PSP.
1235260	1237022	Unjamalami 360 Guitar Hero Controller
1256178	1256478	V for 5 Hours
1281887	1283088	Like playing V for five hours?
1283128	1287731	Well, that's just, you know, going to the arcade when DDR Extreme first came out, but that's a whole other story.
1288271	1288891	So, anyway.
1289572	1291633	Well, I'm excited to see what the team comes up with for the 360.
1291693	1293854	Well, this puts me in my happy place.
1294755	1308984	I love Ninja Gaiden, and we're getting a Ninja Gaiden 2, and you can kill a lot of people as Ryu, who's, like, majorly cool and awesome with... Except the only thing is that he doesn't have the cool-looking scarf, but otherwise.
1309484	1310865	But Itadaki is...
1312791	1316613	basically saying, here we go, Ninja Gaiden 2 on Xbox 360, so that makes me happy.
1317333	1318413	And it's uber violent.
1318693	1320294	Lots of blood flying everywhere.
1320654	1321935	Yeah, I love violence and blood.
1321975	1336961	Like, I like this picture of him totally cutting off this guy's head, and it's like, it's not just blood, it's like this glorious fountain of crimson floating toward the air and covering everything in, you know, its glory.
1337521	1338302	I think that's beautiful.
1338782	1340522	It's gonna be pretty awesome.
1341163	1341663	Something that's
1342539	1343540	Sort of awesome, I guess.
1343920	1344720	Viva Pinata.
1345361	1346361	It's a game, of course.
1346621	1347842	It came out last year.
1348502	1349303	Some people liked it.
1349483	1349823	I didn't.
1350944	1358868	But someone decided that they love Viva Pinata so much that they proposed to their spouse on it.
1359388	1364271	And so, yes, it's, I don't know, cheesy.
1364671	1365751	Very, very cheesy.
1365871	1367232	I'd have to say no.
1367953	1370754	But, I mean, why would you use Viva Pinata, like,
1371752	1374434	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1400040	1401841	Do not do it over a game.
1401901	1403941	It's really cheesy and stupid.
1404922	1405442	Why not?
1405582	1407243	Jamie got proposed to over UHF.
1408123	1413905	Well, it was not necessarily as much of a proposal as much of a... We should just get married, okay?
1413985	1414325	When?
1414646	1415186	Sometime?
1416106	1417527	And, you know, seven years later.
1418567	1419988	It's just, it is pretty cheesy, though.
1420088	1426430	I mean... It's no cheesier than the people who go to a basketball game and have it go out over the big screen.
1427169	1427970	That's pretty cheesy, too.
1428030	1431052	I'd be like, don't embarrass me into marrying you shit.
1432913	1437435	I'm kind of curious what other type of video game-related proposals have happened.
1437455	1438696	I'm kind of looking in our chat room.
1438716	1439977	I'm not seeing a whole lot of stuff there.
1440297	1448862	But what I thought was very interesting about this story is that a lot of sites really ran this, although this is really someone's personal business, but some guy just got kind of creative.
1449543	1452324	I'm surprised that we never saw an Animal Crossing wedding proposal.
1452384	1453825	Maybe there was, and I just forgot about it.
1454446	1454946	But, you know.
1455347	1456147	Final Fantasy XI Ceremony
1476502	1478924	Like Ragnarok weddings, remember Ragnarok?
1478984	1481566	Oh, another nerdy, my god.
1481686	1484188	It was actually in the game too, so hey.
1484689	1486791	Need to unplug, seriously.
1487471	1499001	And of course, especially with Final Fantasy XI, of course you can do it, and then they'll just milk you for any sort of in-game money for it.
1499560	1500460	Comments from chat.
1500520	1501841	Lots of comments from chat here.
1502621	1505261	Chat.OrangeLunchRadio.com if you want to comment live on this Sunday night.
1505722	1508222	Escapist says, on one hand, it's sort of touching.
1508402	1510023	On the other, dot, dot, dot.
1511283	1515864	NoChillyNoPity says, I'm going to propose using an automated Super Mario World level.
1517765	1519145	Oh my God, those are great.
1520407	1521308	Jamie, I made this in your honor.
1521328	1521888	Will you marry me?
1521908	1521968	No.
1522008	1522809	That's a little interesting.
1546738	1549400	Well, you're gonna be like 65 feet away.
1549520	1550160	Come on.
1550661	1554483	The least you could do is actually go up to them and say, will you marry me?
1554543	1557805	Instead of just like, look, I drew it into a picture.
1557825	1558806	It says, will you marry me?
1559226	1560107	Oh, how cute.
1560207	1562288	No, just do it.
1563829	1565250	It's like, okay, you know.
1566840	1571003	I hate to even quote, like, Kelly, but you don't text message break up, okay?
1571344	1576968	You don't text, you don't, you don't fucking PictoChat, you know, engage.
1577888	1579409	Oh my god, Loki, you're such a betch.
1580730	1582432	I'm gonna betch slap you, deckhead.
1584873	1587535	I can't believe Loki quoted Kelly.
1587796	1590197	It's just, it's stupid, it really is.
1590417	1591438	If you think it's cute...
1593465	1604088	Okay, great, it's cute, but you know, anyone that doesn't play the game, like your parents, relatives, they're going to be going, what?
1604188	1613571	What if you sent a text message over PictoChat that said something like, you know, open the book on the table, and then the book has a ring in it, and then you're on one knee, would that be cute?
1613771	1618152	That would be cute, but okay, just doing it in Animal Crossing is kind of lame.
1618632	1620232	GS68 said the best thing ever.
1620693	1620933	What?
1620973	1621633	Will you be my 2P?
1622847	1623247	What's that?
1623287	1623487	Where?
1623668	1624188	Second player.
1624448	1625789	Will you be my 2P?
1625889	1626249	I get it.
1626509	1627190	That's cute.
1627230	1629011	There's some great comments in chat tonight.
1629031	1629591	You guys are funny.
1629872	1632573	Escapist says, better Picto chat than Ping Pals.
1633394	1635215	If I got proposed to in Ping Pals, I'd say no.
1636036	1637416	I'd say you couldn't find something better?
1637617	1637777	No.
1638837	1639138	Get out.
1639178	1640098	In fact, get out of my house.
1641199	1641679	Let's see.
1642680	1644101	I like FootyMonster's comment too.
1644441	1647363	If I ever proposed to my girl on a game, she'd never see it.
1650465	1650625	Wow.
1650645	1650705	Wow.
1651267	1653189	That's kind of like Loki in proposing to Nelly.
1653209	1654230	How did you propose to Nelly?
1654290	1654870	I can't remember.
1655711	1657212	It wasn't over PictoChat.
1657292	1659334	That's for sure.
1659894	1661896	It sure as hell wasn't over Viva Pinata.
1661996	1662697	Is it private?
1663457	1663918	Or what?
1664258	1664698	Can you share?
1664718	1672905	No, we were talking about getting married for a while, so we didn't really have a proposal or anything, but I sure as hell didn't do it over Viva Pinata or anything.
1672925	1674206	Did you get on one knee and everything?
1675302	1676003	Actually, no, I didn't.
1676904	1677925	Oh my god, you bastard.
1678626	1679206	It doesn't matter.
1679226	1681228	We were going to do it anyways.
1681489	1681909	No, it's fine.
1682390	1683891	The wedding was really nice, if nothing else.
1684532	1685833	Even if you have no good proposal story.
1685853	1688136	Even if you took my camera in the bathroom.
1689477	1691598	Do we have to get into those discussions?
1692018	1694979	You know, that was a very M-rated experience.
1694999	1696739	And you know what they say about M-rated games?
1697099	1698020	Let's buy them!
1698320	1698800	That's right.
1698940	1699660	Let's get them.
1700080	1701021	This M-rated game is $300.
1701261	1706282	M-rated games have higher scores and better sales.
1707223	1714205	That is to be if a recent study by the Electronic Entertainment Design and Research Firm is to be believed.
1715025	1719506	They actually were evaluating some games that were rated mature by the ESRB.
1720446	1734509	Even though mature-rated games are only about 10% of what's out there on what the ESRB rates, apparently these titles, quote, have both the highest average Metacritic scores and the highest average gross sales in the United States.
1735089	1741571	So apparently having a mature-rated game is actually a ticket to better sales.
1742011	1742411	Who knows?
1742981	1743641	What do you guys think?
1743721	1744722	Is this story surprising?
1746563	1748124	I actually think this is a little surprising.
1748904	1751946	I don't think it has anything to do with the fact that it's rated M or anything.
1751966	1761332	I just think a lot of the games that come out that are really good, that are your big blockbuster games, are rated M. I mean, let's look at the last few things that have come out.
1761692	1768236	Bioshock was rated M. Stranglehold was rated M. Heavenly Sword, no, that's Teen...
1769724	1771725	Halo's rated M might make it a little bit better but not much
1796883	1826006	so anyway if you want to visit the Electronic Entertainment Design and Research it's EEDAR.com and they have a whole little press release about it on their site so check it out and hopefully this will bode well for the upcoming release of Manhunt 2 but we'll see so that's all I have to say on the M-rated games I'm actually looking to see if there's anything in chat here Ryoma seems to agree because mature rated games include Metal Gear Solid, Halo, and GTA
1826953	1844146	um let's see uh no chili no pity says that's weird comedy films potentially make a lot more rated as pg-13 versus r kind of an interesting uh comparison there but ross deal ut says well that's in theaters what about dvd hmm interesting
1845677	1854206	Well, in other news, speaking of news since you brought up movies, Activision has a demo out for Spider-Man Friend or Foe on Xbox Live.
1855648	1867801	It's 432 megabytes, and what you do is you either play as Spider-Man or you are in a co-op mode with either the Green Goblin or Venom, and you can
1868484	1871785	In the demo, you fight Dr. Octopus, which is kind of cool.
1873505	1877806	It's going to be on PS2, 360, and Wii, put out by Next Level Games.
1877986	1880047	They also gave us Mario Strikers.
1881347	1882608	Mario Strikers Charged, I'm sorry.
1883968	1885889	And there's a PC version, I think, too.
1885909	1890350	I was also going to say, there's some other stuff that's come out on live.
1890370	1890990	They had...
1892068	1893789	Tony Hawk's Proving Grounds Tony Hawk's Proving Grounds
1920638	1922139	Usually Tony Hawk games are pretty fun.
1923200	1925941	Definitely play Flat Out Ultimate Carnage.
1926121	1927702	I cannot stress that enough.
1927742	1929783	That game is so awesome.
1931404	1932765	Time Shift might be okay.
1932985	1933325	I don't know.
1933365	1935227	I played, like, an old-ass demo for it.
1935607	1937668	I mean, back when it was owned by Atari.
1938308	1940209	And it was okay then.
1940370	1943271	I don't know if I'd buy that game, though, or not.
1944752	1947093	I would say... Let's see.
1947113	1949035	On PlayStation 3, I know Ratchet & Clank's...
1950794	1951474	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1973196	1977360	SSJ100Matt says, I hear the new FlatOut is getting closer and closer to a Burnout clone.
1977380	1979121	I think we talked about this a little bit last week.
1979441	1982223	The box art certainly is, but the game itself, Loki?
1983044	1991651	Burnout's going in a completely different direction, so I guess you can compare it to some of the older Burnouts, but the new Burnout game's nothing like it.
1991831	1994513	Isn't the new Burnout game more like Test Drive, where it's like an open world?
1994933	1996414	Sort of.
1996554	2000397	It's just really open... I don't even know how to really describe it.
2000437	2002399	It's just kind of like an open world where you're driving around...
2003120	2004521	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2028287	2040455	As I mentioned, there's a demo out for Juice 2 Hot Import Nights coming out on PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 this week, as well as PlayStation 3 is coming out the week after, because you know all those PlayStation 3 delays.
2041295	2048600	And then on PlayStation 2, if you happen to love karaoke, well, there's quite a bit of it this week.
2049000	2055264	SingStar 80s is coming out both the game by itself and a game bundled with microphones, as well as SingStar Amped.
2056225	2056865	And both
2059238	2060099	And let's see.
2060819	2072368	Also on PlayStation 2 and 360, we have Warriors Orochi, which is a very unique game by Koei that combines Samurai Warriors with Dynasty Warriors.
2072448	2075991	So if you love the Dynasty Warriors games, it's yet another one.
2077692	2083176	On PSP, Coated Arms Contagion, finally coming out, as well as Yu-Gi-Oh!
2083236	2083436	GX.
2083456	2084777	I thought that game got canceled.
2085638	2086839	No, that was the PlayStation 3 one.
2087019	2087099	Oh.
2087925	2088405	Yu-Gi-Oh!
2088465	2092106	GX, Tag Force 2, also coming out on PSP.
2092866	2099407	Let's see, on 360, or I'm sorry, PS3 this week, Stuntman Ignition, finally coming out.
2100147	2104768	And then also on 360, Eternal Sonata, which is going to be pretty big.
2104788	2105168	Sold.
2105368	2106368	I'm so getting that game.
2107888	2110929	What were you telling me about Eternal Sonata before the show started tonight, Jamie?
2110949	2116430	Well, I know that Chopin killed himself by drinking cholera-infested water because of his lifestyle.
2117378	2118778	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2145905	2149488	Let's see, on the Wii, My Sims, also coming out on the DS as well.
2150569	2154572	Cosmic Family, if you have really little kids that like to learn, there you go.
2155213	2163660	Fishing Master, which is that Hudson-based fishing game, which I didn't think we really saw too much of it, but if you like fishing, it might be cool.
2164380	2170966	Mercury Meltdown Revolution, it's a cool puzzle game, only $20 for the Wii, so check it out.
2171286	2174809	Anubis 2, budget game, so maybe.
2175396	2179479	and then Dewey's Adventure is also coming out on the Wii.
2180080	2182762	Let's see, DS, my god, there's like way too much stuff this week.
2183602	2191588	DS, Digimon World Dawn and Dusk, as well as I believe Digimon World is also coming out on Data Squad on PS2.
2192689	2201376	We've also got, let's see here, Frisbee Disc Bundle, which is Frisbee Disc Golf and Ultimate Frisbee, woohoo!
2202585	2204826	Nancy Drew is going to be getting a game.
2205127	2205647	Yay!
2205827	2206727	Namco Museum.
2207048	2209089	Actually, I hear the Nancy Drew games are pretty awesome.
2209269	2211870	I shouldn't just pass it off because it's a Nancy Drew game.
2211890	2213331	I've actually heard they're pretty awesome.
2213811	2219554	Namco Museum DS is coming out, and that's kind of interesting, I guess.
2220194	2222896	On PC, World in Conflict is coming out.
2222936	2223976	I know that's going to be pretty big.
2224456	2226337	Then some of these weird games here.
2226397	2228038	Big Buck Hunter, 30,000 Games.
2230174	2230834	I love kittens.
2231175	2231915	I love puppies.
2233836	2234997	I love puppies too, Loki.
2235197	2237238	Stranglehold, I guess, is coming out as well.
2240560	2243742	I think there might be a couple other things on PS2 here.
2243862	2246264	Let me take a look.
2246344	2247384	Growlancer 5.
2247545	2248785	That one's actually supposed to be pretty big.
2250907	2254489	Some crappy Honda SBK07 Superbike game.
2255589	2257170	And Syphon Filter Dark Mirror.
2258931	2259672	And that's it.
2260743	2261063	Wow.
2262083	2265204	Lots and lots of stuff coming out this week in the U.S.
2265604	2270345	And you know, the Japanese launch calendar looks pretty full as well.
2270405	2273826	Not quite as much as we've got over here, but certainly there's quite a bit of stuff coming out over there.
2274586	2284128	The Madden 08 Japanese version makes its way to the Xbox 360 this week on September 20, 2007, and it does look like it's localized there for Japan with the text and all that stuff.
2284628	2287289	But I'm imagining it's still the same teams, because it's still the NFL, so...
2288247	2288707	There you have it.
2289528	2296452	Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Sengoku Musou Katana, which I'm imagining is a little bit of a sword fighting game.
2296492	2300894	I'm trying to look at some of the screenshots, and it kind of reminds me... What's that old Sega arcade game?
2300914	2301895	They have it like Dave and Buster's.
2301935	2302976	You can swing the sword around.
2303356	2304136	What the hell is that game?
2304156	2304997	I can't remember the name of it.
2305437	2306998	Oh, I know what you're talking about, too.
2307378	2309239	It looks like it might be this kind of game.
2309279	2309599	I don't know.
2310260	2311060	So, we'll go.
2312101	2312481	Go with that.
2313241	2317784	Anyhow, Burnout Dominator is coming out on the PlayStation 2 in Japan, so check that out.
2318254	2324116	and coming out as well on the PlayStation 2, Kinero no Korda 2 Anchor is coming out.
2324616	2325456	It's an RPG.
2326656	2328457	Also coming out on the PlayStation 2.
2328897	2330337	By the way, I have to correct myself.
2330697	2330837	Yes?
2330857	2334018	Because once I thought about it, I realized it wasn't Chopin, it was Tarkovsky.
2335078	2335218	Oh.
2335798	2339859	Oh, is it because people did their research on Wikipedia or something?
2339999	2341520	No, I knew that.
2341600	2344080	And once I had said it, I was like, no, that wasn't who it was.
2344100	2345061	I'm sorry, I'm correcting myself.
2345481	2346001	It's all good.
2347465	2350847	I'm still looking forward to the game, because it is based on hallucinations, one way or the other.
2350867	2352008	I like hallucinating.
2352248	2353729	It's based on the 70s!
2355690	2359313	It's basically the musical hair in video game form, but not really.
2359793	2361595	Anyway, back to Japanese releases.
2361675	2367739	Saint Beast, Rasen no Shou is coming out on the PlayStation 2 as well, an action-based game.
2368279	2368980	Saint Beast.
2369640	2372803	Coming out on the Nintendo DS, Del Toro Quest...
2373383	2375905	Seven Tsun no Hoseki is coming out.
2375945	2378006	It's another RPG game on the DS.
2378467	2382369	As well as Elemental Monster, which looks to be a card-based action game.
2382830	2385091	Not sure what that is, if that's based on anime or what that is.
2385431	2387152	That's coming out on the DS over there in Japan.
2387693	2390655	PSP is getting Burnout Dominator on the 20th over in Japan.
2391115	2393257	And R-Type Tactics comes out.
2393297	2394217	R-Type!
2394297	2398380	It's a strategy tactical game based on R-Type on the PSP.
2398860	2399381	Pretty awesome.
2399401	2399661	Never mind.
2401027	2401948	It's not really our type then.
2402528	2403289	It is our type.
2403309	2405150	It's our type-ish, I don't know.
2405270	2405510	No.
2405550	2406210	But there you have it.
2406250	2409452	That's what's coming out on the Japanese calendar for September the 20th.
2409492	2411333	It's only our type if you fly around and shoot stuff.
2411373	2411794	You do.
2412634	2414735	In a turn-based strategy fashion.
2414755	2415576	That's not fun.
2416737	2418578	So how about some European release dates?
2418638	2419158	How about it?
2419794	2428140	For our buddies in the UK, on the 20th, LocoRoco Cocorecho comes out on PlayStation 3.
2428340	2431062	21st, Drawn to Life and My Sims.
2431663	2434224	Also, My Sims is coming out on the Wii.
2434445	2436646	And why is there two listings for My Sims on the Wii?
2437006	2437246	Anyway.
2438507	2442170	It also, oh, there's two listings for it on Wii and DS.
2443131	2445032	And one of them has a space and one doesn't.
2445192	2446193	I guess that makes it special.
2447372	2453334	SingStar Rock Ballads on PlayStation 2, Stranglehold on PC, and World in Conflict on PC.
2454494	2455735	Oh, yeah, and Halo 3 on the 26.
2456335	2456695	Who cares?
2456955	2461557	And just in case if anyone's actually thinking about buying my Sims, just so you know, it's not multiplayer.
2461577	2462557	It's only one player.
2463957	2464838	Totally lame.
2466298	2466798	It's poo.
2467919	2468179	Yeah.
2469759	2470199	Anywho.
2470479	2472200	Alright.
2472700	2474521	One thing that's not quite as lame...
2476574	2485999	But you can actually get Ratchet & Clank the demo which will be coming out October the 4th and looks pretty awesome.
2486039	2490121	That will be on PlayStation 3, actually a good PlayStation 3 game coming out for once.
2491002	2499186	And if you can't wait until October 4th like I did, you can also pre-order your game at GameStop and they have a demo disc for you.
2501345	2502625	DarkSakura, look at her butt.
2502725	2503346	It is so big.
2530999	2531359	Wow.
2532440	2535282	And now, why are they talking about... Gosh, our chat room is random tonight.
2536303	2539505	Jvmon says, I want Silent Hill, the Hannah Montana edition.
2541027	2545810	To which Hippolytus responds, Silent Hill, Hannah Montana would never be as awesome as Silent Hill, Britney Spears.
2546671	2547151	Go figure.
2549173	2553996	Although I do think in the next Silent Hill game, Pyramid Head should come out and go, It's Pyramid Head, bitch.
2554857	2555758	Like the new Britney song?
2556138	2556438	Forget it.
2557219	2557499	Anyhow.
2558703	2560645	More games on the way to the PlayStation 3.
2561205	2568231	I don't know a whole lot about this game, so hopefully, because I haven't been following PS3 like I should be, like a good amateur game journalist.
2569212	2574257	But on November 20th on the PlayStation 3, Uncharted, Drake's Fortune, is coming out.
2574597	2578160	So, Loki, what is so amazing about this game that I should be paying attention to it for?
2578320	2579802	Well, it's sort of amazing.
2579822	2581223	It's basically Tomb Raider with a guy.
2584065	2585086	I've done Tomb Raider.
2585106	2586247	Is he scantily clad?
2586347	2587327	He's not scantily clad.
2587347	2590370	They're comparing it to Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones.
2590390	2595073	There's a chick in it and he shoots things and it's in a jungle.
2595194	2596515	Woo!
2597195	2601478	Go Naughty Dog for original content for the PS3.
2601519	2602019	That's funny.
2603496	2604397	Eternal Sonata is coming out on PS3.
2604417	2604897	It has been confirmed.
2631525	2633247	and we've already talked about it.
2633888	2635950	Well, what hasn't been confirmed?
2636871	2637331	Wait a minute.
2637612	2640194	We did talk about Eternal Sonata, but we were talking about it on the 360.
2640835	2643097	So now we're hearing that the game is actually coming out on the PlayStation 3?
2643858	2644118	Yeah.
2644319	2644699	As well?
2644719	2645480	Echo says no.
2646421	2646581	What?
2648310	2664961	As I seem to recall, there's been a lot of drama that's played out on the internet this week where, you know, oh yeah, for one, we're not supposed to talk about Namco's release calendar on this show, but they seem to consistently do this, where they put these things out there, whether it be on the ESRB, right?
2665162	2666963	Wasn't Internal Sonata listed on the ESRB?
2667223	2668224	Then it was pulled.
2668484	2671626	Then they put it on their own freaking website, then it was pulled.
2672066	2674688	It was also put back onto the ESRB list.
2675309	2676990	And now it's on the ESRB list again.
2677808	2679289	and it was on their website.
2679690	2684413	It's almost like Namco's doing this on purpose to keep getting the story bumped up to the top of blogs.
2684493	2687295	I mean, Eternal Sonata is coming out this week after all.
2687635	2688296	Hmm.
2688716	2689977	How about, who cares?
2689997	2691498	Let me put it this way, it's...
2693906	2696508	Obviously, it's going to still come out on PS3.
2696808	2699510	That is, I mean, if you believe it's not, you're an idiot.
2700371	2705874	And I believe also beautiful Katamari is listed on there for PlayStation 3 and the Wii as well, to be determined.
2705914	2711158	Which, you know, we didn't tell you that six months ago when the story first hit the internet.
2711338	2712599	I bet you anything.
2712799	2714280	We never changed our stance.
2714340	2715141	Everybody else did.
2715161	2718443	I bet you anything it's still coming out next spring.
2718463	2719263	I agree.
2719844	2721025	It's confirmed in my head.
2721185	2723046	Not that we, you know, would, you know.
2724140	2725521	I don't know.
2726422	2729045	I could see it coming out in spring with like a...
2739434	2742136	Timed, Exclusive, whatever.
2742316	2744077	Because it's Katamari, come on.
2744117	2746058	Of course they're going to put it on the Wii.
2746118	2747059	It's got tilty shit.
2747339	2747960	It's gimmicky.
2748020	2749080	People love gimmicky.
2749240	2753023	So, you know, it's just like the Wii and PS3.
2753623	2757326	I'm just curious why Namco's having all these like, Oh, it's coming out.
2757386	2758026	Oh, no, it's not.
2758106	2758787	Oh, it's an exclusive.
2758867	2759587	Oh, no, it's not.
2760088	2763530	Maybe they should start... And this goes for all game companies.
2763630	2766492	If you don't want information put out there, you need to really...
2766992	2771816	Be coordinating with every single department of your company to make sure this information doesn't get out.
2772077	2778643	Coordinate your marketing people with the web people, with the, I don't know, ratings people.
2779103	2785929	I mean, seriously, if it's on your website, people are going to go, oh, I think it's actually coming out now because it's actually listed on your website.
2786490	2788271	And don't say, oh, someone made a mistake.
2788592	2790033	They weren't supposed to put that up there yet.
2791437	2794118	and don't talk about it in gag order and everybody better shut up.
2794178	2796038	We'll sue, we'll sue, we'll sue.
2796078	2803360	Hey, how much you want to bet that there may be, and this is just pure guessing, Tokyo Game Show is right around the corner.
2803500	2806021	How much you want to bet there's an announcement of some sorts?
2807401	2813922	Just like how right before E3 happened a certain no-name website said something and somebody wasn't happy about it?
2814783	2815263	Possibly.
2815723	2815983	Maybe.
2816703	2820264	Anyhow, thank you for that story on Eternal Sonata, Jamie.
2821388	2824529	In my mind, my head says yes.
2825630	2826550	It's never wrong.
2827170	2841695	Anyways, as we alluded to last week, that it was only a matter of time before the impenetrable 3.6 firmware of the PSP was cracked, and guess what?
2841856	2842376	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
2842416	2843756	I want to know why DarkSakura's laughing.
2843796	2845937	Are you laughing because of Loki's big vocabulary?
2848178	2848478	Nothing.
2850725	2853148	Team M33 has cracked it.
2853208	2858432	There is now a custom version of the firmware out there that allows you to run some homebrew.
2858592	2865458	The problem is right now they can't get support for the 1.5 kernel, which before was able to run all the homebrew stuff.
2865478	2868621	So now people are kind of having to go back, retool things.
2868681	2870483	So some things work, some things don't.
2870743	2875207	Eventually, though, as things progress and more firmwares come out,
2876034	2876775	Thanks for watching!
2905259	2907941	Which is interesting in itself.
2908641	2913444	And what you do with that is you, I guess they call it extending the Pandora's battery.
2913464	2918126	You basically put some parts of different firmwares on there and then it works.
2918987	2922949	So once you've done the Pandora's battery, it's pretty easy.
2922969	2926951	And they actually have programs out there to make it walk you through step by step what to do.
2927051	2928452	So it's pretty simple.
2929032	2931074	But definitely worth checking out.
2931114	2933555	I'm sure that we're going to see some more stuff coming from that.
2934141	2945006	Of course, Sony, hearing that, released 3.7 on the PSP, the firmware to break what other people have done on 3.6.
2946226	2953109	And now they have custom theme support, which I will remind everybody has been available in the homebrew scene for quite a while now.
2953810	2958912	But you can download official themes, which also, by the way, can be cracked apart and put on custom.
2958952	2959452	Wait, wait, wait.
2959552	2961413	I thought there's been themes on the PSP forever.
2962142	2964043	Well, this is actually like customizing themes.
2964084	2967906	You can put like a wallpaper in the background and stuff like that.
2968146	2971009	This is actually changing all the icons, text, etc.
2971169	2972330	Oh, that's interesting.
2972410	2972730	Okay, cool.
2972810	2978374	But you can do this on custom firmwares right now, and it's been available for a long time.
2978814	2982397	But people have already found ways to crack those theme files apart and
2983905	2985346	Yeah, just nothing to save.
2986086	2995312	Other things have been supported, I guess, more where you can assign buttons in remote play, so maybe that gets to allow you to play Lair a little bit easier on the PSP.
2995952	3006678	I guess sequential playback is now supported under video and simultaneous playback under, I guess, music and photos, so you can play music while viewing your photos.
3008467	3013229	Other interesting stuff, right after this came out, I guess they had dumped that firmware, and now there's 3.71.
3013589	3016430	So, it will never end.
3017071	3017691	Never, ever.
3019111	3027115	Well, you know, I guess, like, homebrew and, you know, changing little things around is one thing, but when folks can play, you know, pirated games on there, Sony's got to do what they got to do.
3027815	3028935	Yeah, they got to do what they got to do.
3028955	3030716	Put the Swift Panhammer down.
3030896	3032557	They got to do it not very well, either.
3034656	3035216	Thank you for watching!
3051386	3052587	Thank you for watching.
3052607	3053107	See you next time.
3068873	3086928	and one of their reporters is actually reporting that yes there have been some changes for instance you might remember an early report where the killer could use a pair of pliers to literally rip the balls off of a hunter well that scene has been taken out
3087528	3089909	Not on my version.
3090089	3091189	I was looking forward to that.
3091309	3091929	Well, that's okay.
3092670	3093390	Here's the thing, though.
3093590	3100772	One of the biggest changes that they've done is that Rockstar has made a blur effect to some of the major death blows in the game.
3101112	3113075	So in the M-rated version, there's like this blur effect that goes on, or the graphics get darkened a little bit, so it's really hard to tell what's going on because it becomes like this kind of like motion blur type thing that doesn't make it so clear.
3113175	3115896	Well, that's why they made the killing the...
3117196	3120537	and Crazy88 seen in Kill Bill Black and White in the US.
3120737	3121177	That's true.
3121237	3123018	I mean, these types of little censorship things happen.
3123038	3124318	So, yeah, that's kind of interesting.
3124338	3127699	But what changing it to black and white made it that much different?
3127819	3130300	Not seeing the blood as red or something.
3130400	3131501	I've seen it without it.
3131741	3131961	Wow.
3132001	3133761	It's ridiculous is all it is.
3133901	3135982	That's just like the... It's people who aren't getting laid.
3136702	3139583	That's just like when they change the blood to sweat.
3140063	3143864	That will forever be my favorite rating thing that was done.
3143884	3145505	Look at how much sweat comes out.
3146525	3147105	Damn.
3149706	3150546	So there you have it.
3151107	3154028	Those are some of the big changes that are in the Manhunt 2.
3154128	3162590	So, you know, I would still say, though, I think this game's going to come out, and I think the adults-only version will still come out on the PC later on.
3162650	3165211	Okay, but here's some other interesting things, though.
3165351	3167132	Apparently they're talking about different cutscenes.
3167192	3175935	In one cutscene, a masked killer uses a power saw to slice a man's bulging belly as the victim lies helpless strapped to a table.
3176355	3184717	That's okay for M, but oh my god, you know, if they rip off fake balls on a goddamn 3D model of somebody.
3187798	3194340	Well, I mean, that does kind of make everybody go, you know, that has them collectively go, oh, hey, oh, crush your legs.
3194440	3196320	The ESRB is so hilarious.
3197321	3198841	So, well, I don't know.
3199141	3205383	I have to admit, my interest on this game is kind of, you know, at first it was kind of like, yeah, this might be kind of fun, but now I'm just like, eh.
3206477	3213101	I don't like those movies like Saw and stuff, so I probably won't like this game.
3213481	3214482	So I don't think I'm going to buy it.
3216283	3220025	Unless it gets incredible reviews and there's something about the game I just have to see.
3220625	3224487	I'm not really in it for the... I'm kind of interested in the Wii murdering of people.
3225488	3228190	That is interesting, but not... I don't know.
3228470	3229810	I'll just go to your house and play it, man.
3229850	3230731	To be very honest,
3232005	3236589	There's a lot of little Wii games out there that I want to buy right now, and unfortunately that's the next one in line.
3236629	3243635	It's not necessarily that I want to go around murdering people with the Wii remotes, even though I do find humor in that, but I don't know.
3244316	3248840	Now, Ross Deal UT in our chatroom says, Manhunt 2, a trash game selling on Controversy Alone.
3248920	3249841	Sad, sad thing.
3250221	3255285	And I sort of agree, except I don't want to pass the game off as trash without having actually gotten to play it.
3255706	3258688	But, you know, I will definitely kind of want to look at the reviews and things.
3258728	3258909	All right.
3259849	3265071	This game certainly doesn't stay in the news for its incredible innovations that it's bringing to the gaming scene.
3265751	3268052	I'll give you that, but look at Hostel.
3268312	3269312	There's a perfect example.
3269672	3273194	There's another movie that's probably trash that's selling on Controversy alone.
3273474	3275134	I won't say that the game won't sell.
3275294	3276375	I'm just saying I don't care.
3278695	3280696	I didn't watch Hostel either.
3281372	3282533	I have an interest in those.
3282773	3283333	I know, I know.
3283713	3285515	Like, no, like, it's just weird.
3285535	3292258	Like, sometimes I will watch the very gory movies, like The Descent was pretty gory, and I loved it, but it was like... There's more suspense, though, isn't there?
3292298	3296321	Yeah, it was way, like, more, just the way it was directed and everything, it was, oh, it was scary.
3296341	3298882	That was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, The Descent.
3299443	3299703	Anyway.
3300763	3310289	Well, um, for other news, though, regarding Manhunt 2, people were interviewed to see whether or not they would be interested in buying it, and, um...
3311912	3319636	There were only 18% of the people polled who said they were going to buy it when it launches on Halloween.
3319656	3322978	52% said no, and 30% said, uh, what?
3324839	3327300	That many people clicked a button that said, uh, what?
3327460	3327961	And decided.
3328401	3328821	Oh, okay.
3331563	3339507	That's, well, so, so apparently only 18% of the, that's still, I don't know, I mean, 18% to me kind of seems like a large...
3340652	3342333	chunk of the gaming community.
3342393	3348058	I mean, if you can sell out of one to every five people that own a Wii this game, that's still quite a lot of copies moved.
3348438	3350560	So I don't think it's as bad as they're saying.
3350780	3359727	But I think a good, a better question would be were you planning to buy the adult-only one and now you're not going to anymore?
3359908	3362129	I'd be kind of curious to see what the result is of that one.
3362209	3365732	At the end of the day, though, it doesn't really matter to any of the console makers.
3365812	3369035	It really just fucks over Take-Two again and Rockstar, so...
3370717	3371037	Oh well.
3371858	3373179	Stop making such violent games.
3374020	3374200	No.
3374801	3375341	But, oh well.
3375522	3376062	I guess we'll see.
3376142	3378825	I mean, again, it all really depends on the reviews for me.
3378845	3380466	Release it on PC, Unrated.
3380486	3381007	There you go.
3382048	3382388	We'll see.
3384110	3384590	We will see.
3384950	3385371	Anyways.
3385671	3387773	Oops, it knocked the ferret on the floor.
3387793	3389195	That's fine.
3389235	3390095	Good, I hope it died.
3390356	3390636	No.
3390656	3390696	No.
3392300	3403326	If you happen to be a stupid kid trying to buy games at GameStop, well, there might be one particular GameStop in South Dallas that won't be selling you games.
3403686	3411350	In fact, he's breaking corporate policy and he refuses to sell games to school kids who can't prove that they're doing well in school.
3411950	3415352	And apparently the manager is Brandon Scott and he's...
3416871	3422936	Make sure that an adult can verify that the child is getting good grades, otherwise he won't sell them a game.
3423757	3424818	Any game, ever.
3427300	3433546	He says, I'm probably going to get in trouble for this, but to me it's worth it because the kids understand that somebody cares.
3433906	3434907	You know who doesn't care?
3435288	3437670	Probably GameStop Corporate and you're going to get fired.
3438413	3439293	Congratulations.
3439613	3454217	You know, I'm very tempted, like, there's a, you know, the part of me that is very like, you know, aha, people get what they deserve, aha, wants to kind of applaud what this guy is doing, but when I really kind of sit there and think about it, I go like, you know, this is kind of screwed up.
3454777	3455357	It is screwed up.
3455517	3459918	I mean, I think it should be up to the parents what the kids get, period.
3460178	3467340	Now, I don't have a problem with him deciding to do that, if he owned his own game store, but he doesn't, and so he's
3468956	3471857	I think it's a great idea that you shouldn't sell games to kids that are stupid.
3471937	3475620	But there's a lot of reasons not to sell games to certain kids.
3475980	3486086	Hell, I was at a playing trade this week and I was looking at they were doing their grand opening and there was a kid no parents watching him.
3486146	3491069	Kid couldn't have been like 10, 11 years old playing Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
3491530	3494191	Just sitting there playing and he's like, I just killed a hooker!
3494792	3495392	You know, it's like
3496218	3497419	Come on, people!
3497439	3501564	And then you're bitching about, oh, I didn't know Billy was playing such a violent game!
3503766	3504427	Parents are stupid.
3504507	3507831	Don't let a GameStop-type store babysit your children, then.
3507851	3512015	What you need to do, though, I mean, I applaud him for making that decision.
3512255	3518242	I mean, granted, it's probably going to be great for the store, but, you know, wants that off his conscience, great.
3518769	3520370	Good grades does not equal good behavior.
3533723	3538784	You know, there are a lot of kids there who weren't necessarily motivated.
3538824	3541384	They might be good kids, they're just not motivated to get good grades.
3541424	3543185	This started to happen to me in my senior year of high school.
3543225	3550006	I remember when I was in school and stuff, and if I would get good grades, my parents would reward me by buying me something, you know?
3550026	3553807	That was kind of my thing, too, is that my parents did what this guy did.
3553907	3556047	If I got good grades, I got stuff.
3556167	3560408	If I didn't get good grades, I got, you know, locked in a cellar.
3561748	3561948	So...
3562560	3565041	And silly Bob, you don't have a cellar.
3565081	3566902	I had to live in the closet under the stairs.
3566922	3568043	Like Harry Potter.
3568103	3574246	And really, I mean, the kids, if they can't buy their games from GameStop or whatever, they'll just go somewhere else.
3574806	3578448	You're not the only fucking game store on the planet, you moron.
3578488	3580389	I mean, people go to Walmart.
3580429	3582610	Ranma wants to say, Loki, he was suspended.
3583755	3584436	Way to go!
3584496	3585736	That's what you get for doing good things.
3585756	3588538	DarkTetsuya says, well, the adults should be there to buy the game anyway.
3588778	3589298	Exactly.
3589478	3597122	And Frisbee, in their best Maury Povich impression, says, you are not the father.
3598342	3598623	Get it?
3599223	3600403	Because the guy is not the father.
3601144	3601664	GameStop.
3601724	3604005	I don't even know if that was supposed to be in a Maury Povich impression.
3604045	3605006	I just felt like saying it in one.
3605026	3607507	GameStop, you are not the father.
3608587	3615170	You are not the father.
3615230	3619472	Escape, it says, I've had eight-year-olds in my stores talking about how awesome Grand Theft Auto was, too.
3619792	3621693	But I wonder if a lot of that is hype.
3622093	3624655	Like, you gotta wonder how many of those kids actually played the game.
3624735	3628977	Like, sometimes, I mean, obviously there's some screwed up kids, like, you know, the one Loki was talking about earlier playing the game.
3629257	3631978	But you gotta wonder, like, sometimes eight-year-olds are just full of talk.
3632679	3633179	You know what I mean?
3634179	3637781	Like, none of them have probably played the game, but they hear their brother talking about it or something like that.
3638264	3638546	I don't know.
3641305	3641745	That's poop-tastic.
3671408	3671949	I don't know.
3671969	3672269	Who isn't?
3672309	3673450	I'm doing a Halo 3 presale.
3673490	3676372	I unfortunately was over at GameStop quite a bit this week, just for different reasons.
3676392	3676793	Buying systems.
3676813	3676933	But...
3691772	3698657	I guess they had a sign on their door that said that the line starts at 9pm the night before for Halo.
3698857	3699898	What day does Halo come out?
3699938	3700798	I forget.
3700918	3701119	25th.
3701199	3702199	Oh, so it's next Tuesday.
3703180	3705782	So I cannot wait for it to be over.
3706182	3707242	I really cannot.
3708283	3715668	Well, unfortunately what is not clear at this time, don't know if it's going to be, you know, like they're going to turn the whole store into games like GameStop EB, probably not.
3716569	3719832	I can see that they'll probably have a little corner of the store dedicated to video games.
3720152	3720753	I mean, why not?
3720773	3723495	Because they sell a lot of the accessories and things anyway.
3723896	3725477	And they sell other types of gaming things.
3727725	3728646	Radio Shack Sells
3749935	3751077	Those are all kinds of cool.
3751497	3753339	I got one at a garage sale years ago and I loved it.
3753359	3753900	I hate RadioShack.
3754180	3758065	They're so damn expensive when it comes to anything component-wise.
3758326	3760648	You're buying video cables, audio cables.
3762090	3763532	You're better off somewhere else.
3763913	3764413	Seriously.
3764613	3767357	I go to RadioShack to buy lithium batteries and that's about it.
3768250	3769291	There's cables.
3769631	3770912	I have a lot of AV cable needs.
3770932	3772553	And I bought a microphone there before.
3772573	3773214	Yeah, microphone.
3773234	3774255	I think our microphones.
3774535	3775536	Our old microphones were.
3775856	3776776	No, yeah, the old ones were.
3776796	3778478	These are the newer ones from the guitar place, right?
3778498	3782761	The one I used at my what-to-do pump-up-the-volume-for-the-longest-time was from RadioShack.
3782821	3783321	Put it this way.
3783381	3791287	I was going to go to GameStop to buy some stuff for our setup at work for the LAN stuff, like some headsets and...
3792117	3792778	Audio Cables.
3792958	3795119	It was going to cost me $80 to buy it there.
3795139	3800022	I ended up shopping this place that my coworkers recommended, CableWholesale.com.
3801363	3803424	I would say it was $15 instead of $80.
3804325	3808387	So just so you know, don't shop there.
3808763	3809683	So here's my question.
3809764	3810904	Remember when the Wii launched?
3810944	3813805	We went out and we gave orange soda to people and cookies and stuff.
3813825	3815246	What should we do for the Halo 3 launch?
3815286	3818468	Should we go out on Monday night and do something for the kids in life?
3818488	3819108	Give them crack.
3819228	3821229	I don't want to go out on a Monday night.
3821269	3822690	Loki's like, I'm tired.
3822990	3823590	Let me sleep.
3823650	3824270	Fuck this.
3824330	3825051	It's Halo.
3825131	3825431	I mean...
3826071	3828053	I guess you could bring him the game fuel shit.
3828213	3830054	I really don't want to talk to Halo fans.
3830094	3831715	What about the journalist in you, Loki?
3831956	3834017	Doesn't the journalist in you want to go out there and talk to the people?
3834037	3834437	No, I don't care.
3834678	3836579	I despise Halo 3 right now.
3836659	3838380	Just, I don't know, retail standpoint.
3838400	3839641	That's your personal vendetta.
3839781	3841102	That is my personal vendetta.
3841122	3843604	I don't see the point.
3845165	3845806	All right, well, we'll see.
3845826	3848168	Yeah, I like the idea of going out and giving them game fuel.
3848828	3849909	Maybe we'll see about that.
3850936	3852137	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3879600	3880401	DarkSakura.com
3907145	3907405	DarkSakura.com
3930498	3934225	I mean, we just had here last week having a conversation about Newtopia.
3934565	3936268	Yeah.
3936489	3941097	So coming soon, DarkSakura's website of the week will be replaced with DarkSakura's classic game of the week.
3941437	3942059	That'll be fun.
3942139	3943501	It'll be ObscureShit.com.
3945432	3949055	RossDLUT says, Loki only hates Halo 3 because it's popular.
3949235	3951377	No, I don't hate Halo 3 because it's popular.
3951697	3955220	I hate it because all my customers are complaining, when am I going to get Halo 3?
3955360	3960085	And you really need it on 3D because it's going to suck if we don't have it.
3960145	3961886	When's it coming in?
3962687	3969313	I hated even when the Wii came out because it was a pain in the ass and we knew we couldn't get them on time and all that stuff.
3969993	3970314	Halo 3
3971224	3981410	Everybody wants this damn thing and they're all coming out of the woodwork and all complaining that they need it like five days early and stuff and you're like, yeah, you're not going to be selling it early or anything.
3983231	3986733	I just, I hate games that are going to be just that popular.
3986873	3989935	Grand Theft Auto 4, when it comes out, I'm going to hate that too.
3990655	3995198	Except I love Grand Theft Auto 4, but I am still going to hate the whole selling of Grand Theft Auto 4.
3996724	4009372	DarkTetsuya in our chatroom thinks that for the next couple weeks, well, before we transition in episode 250 to, you know, changing some things up, thinks that your website of the week should be like Google.com or Yahoo.com.
4010853	4015276	Actually, if you type in Goggle.com, because I typoed it once, it takes you to porn.
4019539	4022281	I used to use HotBot as my search engine back in the day.
4023181	4025323	And you could, you know, totally typo that to HotBot.
4026007	4026167	Blackle
4039266	4039866	DarkSakura.com
4069643	4075525	Escapist says Halo 3 will end with Bob Newhart waking up in bed discovering the whole war was a dream.
4076305	4078526	JV Mon's jumping up and down saying you win the internet.
4079226	4080226	That was a pretty great ending.
4080446	4083327	Okay, I actually have a website.
4083867	4091770	And I have to blame... I have to blame... Hold on for the mute.
4094150	4097411	I have to blame JV Mon for this one because it's awful.
4098032	4099092	It made my heart cry.
4100185	4102766	This is my website of the week not to go to.
4103166	4103426	Ever.
4104526	4104846	Ever.
4105046	4108127	It's insulting and horrible and you don't want to go there ever.
4108347	4108787	This is fun.
4108827	4110068	The anti-website of the week.
4110088	4111128	The anti-website of the week.
4111868	4119770	It's captain-jack.de slash 2008 slash cj.html A new Captain Jack.
4120530	4121631	And it makes my heart hurt.
4121651	4122611	I want to see a new Captain Jack.
4122751	4126692	And his girl that's with him is vacant.
4127048	4128309	Hey, I like the new Captain Jack.
4128509	4129310	I can deal with this.
4129610	4131472	Wait, hold on.
4131512	4133334	I thought this was another Doctor Who thing.
4133474	4134395	No, this sucks.
4134435	4137118	Like, THE Captain Jack.
4137278	4138018	That Captain Jack.
4138339	4139440	They replaced him?
4139780	4140521	How dare they?
4140961	4141342	I know!
4141562	4143904	Unless that's his son.
4144004	4145325	If it's his son, I forgive them.
4145445	4147187	If it's not, I don't forgive them.
4147948	4148568	How dare they?
4149049	4149750	No, check this out.
4150170	4150831	This is awful.
4150851	4152032	Let me turn up my volume.
4153756	4156439	Wait, can you give me the website one more time because I'll play it on here so the listeners can hear.
4156459	4163445	It's captain-jack.de slash 2008 slash cj.html Wait.
4167709	4174855	captain-jack.de slash captain-jack.de slash 2008, this is great radio, slash cj.html Yes.
4176117	4176997	Okay, I think I got it.
4177338	4178138	It hurts my heart.
4178499	4179139	Alright, here we go.
4179259	4179880	Site is loading.
4181224	4184848	Alright, we welcome, we proudly present the one and only Captain Jack.
4184888	4185549	Screw you!
4187371	4188752	There will only be one Captain Jack.
4190574	4191896	Oh lord, this sounds horrible already.
4210510	4211430	This is bad.
4211450	4212171	I've got to stop it.
4212231	4213151	Besides, we don't want to play more.
4213171	4214671	Captain Jack, you are not.
4216252	4216632	Wow.
4219233	4222153	JV Mon says his son came out as Captain Jack Jr.
4223134	4223834	Interesting.
4224534	4226015	Is that like James Bond Jr.?
4226655	4227095	Interesting.
4227755	4228035	All right.
4228135	4231756	I like how in his glasses on the website you can totally see the film crew.
4231836	4233137	Way to go, people.
4233477	4233837	All right.
4233877	4237158	I'd like to cordially thank JV Mon for ruining tonight's program.
4237198	4237778	Thank you, JV Mon.
4238732	4239713	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4261587	4262708	Should be pretty sweet, actually.
4262808	4268792	It's more of like a traditional, crazy, tons of bullets, all over the place, shooter game.
4268893	4272475	So, hopefully it'll be as cool as I think it is.
4274537	4275938	Hopefully it's cool as you make it out to be.
4276859	4280822	Well, unfortunately, the link that I had on here was the wrong story, so... Uh-oh.
4280842	4282903	That's based off memory, so... My bad.
4284044	4285365	Oh, we linked the wrong story in the show.
4285425	4286146	Ha-ha, Rob!
4286386	4286686	My bad.
4287952	4289433	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4312526	4313086	Based on the movie.
4313767	4320975	Wii is showing off Knights Journey into Dreams, Ghost Squad, another version of the Golden Compass, Sega Rally on the Xbox 360.
4321055	4321496	That's it.
4321856	4326882	But remember, this is, you know, Tokyo Game Show and unfortunately the Xbox 360 is not doing as well over there.
4327362	4330224	I think that's all they had over on the 360 from Sega.
4330724	4332466	Other than Golden Compass, I would imagine.
4332946	4336849	They are showing an expansion for Phantasy Star Universe on the PlayStation 2, though, which makes me wonder.
4336869	4339731	It must not be coming out on 360, but did the game come out on 360?
4339791	4344114	It is coming out over here, but I think the expansion will probably be a download, just like...
4344534	4345555	PICTO IMAGE DS
4364808	4367729	Another version of the Golden Compass, which by the way will also be on PSP.
4368089	4369150	And a game that I like.
4369170	4371391	This is called Dream Cat Smile DS.
4372371	4373451	Rad.
4373511	4375512	PSU expansion pack also coming to the PC.
4376733	4376993	Rad.
4377773	4380674	And Escapist in chat says, no new Jet Set Radio yet?
4380714	4381535	My heart is breaking.
4381635	4381995	I agree.
4383175	4383475	I agree.
4383915	4384436	Seaman 2.
4385456	4385896	Seaman 2?
4385956	4386216	Yeah.
4387957	4389057	I don't know so much about that.
4389818	4390318	You know what?
4390774	4397920	I wouldn't mind having a Seaman 2 because I thought it was great that the whole thing was narrated by Leonard Nimoy.
4398621	4403005	So if I can get this right here, DarkSakura, you're saying you want Seaman 2.
4408329	4409270	I got a ferret thrown at me.
4409410	4410371	Thank God the webcam's off.
4411071	4412152	Yeah, this is horrible radio.
4412413	4412833	Ferret!
4412953	4413193	No.
4413674	4415135	When you read the story, I'll give back the ferret.
4415535	4416736	EA, give me it.
4417337	4417417	Okay.
4417437	4417597	Okay.
4419696	4426258	Anyway, EA is finally entering the world of survival horror by giving us a game called Dead Space.
4427358	4430339	You get zombies hidden in fun places.
4430799	4433220	We won't say where they are, but they are somewhere.
4434380	4439581	And it's supposed to be some zombie game set in outer space, from what I understand.
4439601	4441382	It's like Event Horizon, I think they said.
4441742	4445223	Oh, and you have tentacles in it, so that's okay.
4445663	4446823	Yay, tentacles!
4447043	4448324	Kids love tentacles!
4448384	4448984	Tentacle porn?
4450342	4452964	I need to put that on top of my Netflix queue.
4453004	4454565	Just download it like everybody else.
4454725	4455386	Then I'm done.
4455406	4455766	All right.
4476454	4479416	Well, that's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio.
