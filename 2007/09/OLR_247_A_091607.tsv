0	19560	Today, September 16th, 2007, some cult games from the last generation are coming to Xbox
19560	25080	360, a retro CD-based system is coming soon to Wii's Virtual Console, and do M-rated
25080	34040	games so better than other games? Orange Lounge Radio. Hello everybody out there on the internet
34040	38960	and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. We are that podcast dedicated to video
38960	43760	games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. My name is Rob Roberts, you
43760	48520	might know me as Sky. Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura,
48520	54320	Jamie Summers. What? How are you, Dark Sakura? Meh. I'm sorry to inconvenience you with our
54320	59160	little program tonight. I was busy. Busy doing what, might I ask? Petting my ferret. Petting
59160	64040	your ferret? Having fun? Is that a euphemism for something? Maybe I shouldn't ask. Say
64040	69840	hello to the tech master, Loki. Hello. How are you doing, Loki? I'm doing fine. I'm glad
69840	76440	to hear. Just fine? Well, I'm trying to get, I have a custom firmware on my PSP Slim, and
76440	81640	I'm trying to get it to run ISOs, but I think that there's been some changes versus what
81640	87720	I was running before, so. Gotcha. Well, happy birthday. A little late, by the way. Thank
87720	91720	you. Mr. Loki. And hope, you hope you had a good one, but I'm sure you'll tell us all
91720	94860	about your little birthday gathering last night in a minute. Yeah. During How Was Your
94860	98600	Gaming Week. But yeah, we're gonna start off with How Was Your Gaming Week. I want to introduce
98600	102200	the chat room, though. Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com. If you're listening to us live here on this
102200	106480	Sunday evening, you can join our chat room. Just head on over there. And of course, if
106480	110560	you aren't listening live, just join us sometime. We tape live Sunday nights at six o'clock
110560	116240	Pacific Standard Time on our live 365 feed, and now we have a webcam on Operator11.com,
116240	119020	although I don't know, the webcam feed's not that exciting. You just kind of like see my
119020	122760	face looking at the camera and Loki's back, because of the way the room's set up. But
122760	126760	I'm hoping when we finally move the show out into the bigger room, we'll have more stuff
126760	133040	to look at. So this is, this is all warm up. This is all the, the pre. This is the foreplay.
133040	137160	This is the, yeah, that's exactly right. This is the foreplay with the camera. Thank you.
137160	140040	Dark Soccer, always the witty one. All right, How Was Your Gaming Week. Since we don't have
140040	144840	guests here tonight to introduce, after last week's like clusterfuck of people, it's an
144840	148680	empty house tonight. We're just feeling the love, the three of us. Dark Soccer. I didn't
148680	155360	play anything. Nothing? Except World Cup Soccer. Oh, and we had Uno going on in my house, because
155360	161920	Dan's buddy Will has decided that he loves Uno now and has been doing what he calls Ultimate
161920	167880	Dickery Games. What, pray tell, is an Ultimate Dickery Game? Well, actually I've been calling
167880	172480	it that. He's just calling it being an asshole. As in doing all the make you draw until you
172480	177520	get the card and doing extra draws for challenges and things like that. And then he's doing
177520	182480	challenges all the time. So he's just being a complete asshole and he's doing it on purpose.
182480	186400	So like setting it to like the maximum cards you can possibly draw and all that stuff?
186400	191080	Yeah. I see. And I think, I don't know if he's doing it under Dan's gamertag, though.
191080	196120	I think he's doing it under his own. Or yours. No, he's not doing it under mine or I'll beat
196120	203120	the crap out of him with a ferret. That would be funny if he did, though. I'd laugh. I haven't
203480	209200	even touched Final Fantasy, though. Wow. Sorry to hear it. It's alright. I've been playing
209200	215320	World Cup Soccer, though. Like a fiend. UndeadZerg in our chat room actually says, DarkSakura
215320	221320	again? You love that World Cup Soccer. It's because it's the best pinball machine ever.
221320	226720	Well now, and unfortunately, I don't know if you were going to get into this later,
226720	231360	so I'm sorry for spoiling it, but I guess your desktop had a little crap out this week,
231360	234720	so that takes out your PC gaming. Well no, actually I have something else, but it sort
234720	240520	of goes into my FUs, sort of. I tried to get back into Guild Wars, and then we'll get into
240520	246560	the FUs later. Oh dear, alright. So you played more games than you thought. Well no, I updated
246560	253560	Guild Wars, and that's as far as I got. Uh oh. Dear PlayNC, please work on the weekends,
253600	260600	not love me. P.S. Crap. Alright, well then we'll go to Loki. Loki, how was your gaming
260880	266360	week? It was good. I took two days off this week to play games. Unfortunately, during
266360	271880	those two days, I really only played Bioshock. I did finish it, though, so that's good. And
271880	278320	unfortunately, I forgot to do a few things while playing through it, so I wasn't able
278320	282840	to get all the possible achievements I could, so I have to go back to some of the earlier
282840	288720	saves and maybe replay through it again, but I'm like 820 out of 1000, so that's pretty
288720	294920	good. Not bad for an achievement horse. Not bad, yeah. So I'll go back and do that stuff.
294920	301840	It's a good game, interesting twists. I mean, it's a pretty cool twist, and you don't realize
301840	306040	it throughout most of the game. I guess you kind of pick up on it a little bit as you
306040	313040	go through, but it's also good to note that those audio diaries kind of tell more of the
313080	318200	back story. They're not just there for achievements and stuff, so definitely check those out while
318200	324400	you're playing the game. And then other things, like I mentioned, I bought a PSP Slim. It
324400	331400	is very light, and of course the first thing I do to it, I hacked it and tried to put a
331400	338400	custom firmware on it, and now I have 3 PSVs for some reason. And I just bought the cables
338780	343180	for a video out today, so I haven't tried that yet. What is going to be pretty cool
343180	346460	though is when I do get the homebrew on there, because I'll be able to hook it up to my TV
346460	353060	and play around with that, and play Nintendo games on my TV I guess, though I can do that
353060	359420	with like 5 other systems. I don't know. And then I've been trying to get my PS2 back from
359420	364860	my sister so I can play the beta that got leaked out for Manhunt 2, because that's supposed
364860	370100	to be good. Other things I played during the week, more Call of Duty 4 beta. I still suck
370100	375900	at it, but it's going to be great. I can't wait for the game to come out. Of course,
375900	380980	more Saints Row multiplayer at work, and they're kind of getting frustrated with me because
380980	385980	I keep winning a lot, and buy a lot. So, sorry, it just...
385980	389580	And you're so humble too. Well, I don't play it that much, I only play
389580	395420	it at work, and so everyone thinks I'm practicing or something. I really don't, and it's not
395420	401620	like I'm that good or anything, I don't know. And then, I'm trying to think, what else?
401620	407220	I played some Xbox Live Arcade games. I played a little bit more Worms, and that's just kind
407220	411840	of... I don't know. I don't even know if I want to play that to get achievement points,
411840	416900	but yeah, I think that's pretty much it. Yeah, Worms was better like ten years ago.
416900	421940	Exactly. I love Worms Armageddon. That was like the ultimate for me, and then it just
421940	427500	kind of... they haven't done anything with it since Worms Armageddon, other than make
427500	432340	it worse. So, that's about it so far, yeah. Alright.
432340	436600	I got the Ratchet & Clank demo, but I didn't get to play it yet, so... for PS3.
436600	438980	You will be playing that soon. Yes, yes.
438980	444220	Alright. Well, my gaming week, I've of course been playing more Final Fantasy XI, and it's
444220	448460	pretty awesome because Shane, before he left town, he actually got me a clock for Final
448460	452800	Fantasy XI, which is actually pretty hilarious. It's a little Vanadiel clock. It actually
452800	457580	shows you what time it is in Vanadiel, along with the Earth time, and it sets these little
457580	461380	alarms that you can set on it. It's so funny. This is like for the totally hardcore gamer.
461380	465460	But when the timers run out, this is the best part. It plays like little music box music.
465460	477940	Hold on, let me see if I can get one to play. Isn't that the cutest thing you've ever seen?
477940	481100	And by cute, I mean you have to be like a real addict to appreciate something like that.
481100	485420	I feel sick to my stomach now. I will tell you what's made Final Fantasy
485420	492220	XI a little more tolerable this time around is the Windower. It's this third-party application
492220	495500	I'm really not supposed to be using, and I could probably get banned for saying that
495500	499940	I use it, but the Windower allows you to play Final Fantasy XI in a window. So instead of
499940	504100	sitting there looking for party, doing absolutely nothing, I can actually sit there and surf
504100	507340	the internet while I wait and look for a party. It's the best thing ever.
507340	510560	Now Windower does have some cheats built in, but I don't use them because that's how people
510560	514800	get caught, and I don't want to cheat. I think cheating in MMOs is screwed up, but I don't
514800	518060	see too much of the harm between flipping between different windows. I mean, I used
518060	521780	to have my laptop over here and doing that. World of Warcraft, you can. Guild Wars, you
521780	524060	can. Yeah, so I don't think it's a big deal about
524060	533060	that. So there you have it. Let's see. Uh-oh. Is our feed dropping? No?
533060	535780	It said it was lagging. It said it was lagging? All right, our chat
535780	538900	room's saying the feed's screwed up. If the feed keeps screwing up too bad, I guess we'll
538900	542060	have to kill Operator 11. I hope I don't have to do that. We'll see.
542060	545700	But I'm looking in the chat room here, and I'm looking at what the chat was saying. They
545700	549740	played their gaming week. We have a lot of threes in the gaming week. I see a lot of
549740	555020	Metroid Prime 3s people have been playing. Nintendo Maniac 64 says Metroid Prime 3.
555020	560620	Hitstun says Quake 3. Raw Steel UT says Persona 3. And then Son of Dad has been watching The
560620	565740	Office Season 3. There you go. And then also I've been playing on the DS Planet Puzzle
565740	570200	League, because Planet Puzzle League is all kinds of awesome. And trying to get more people
570200	574140	on my friends list, though, so I'll be posting my code in our little thread we have there
574140	577640	on the forums over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, trying to get more friends for Planet Puzzle
577640	583500	League that I can play against. I bought a pink DS Lite for Nellie, so now
583500	590180	she has her own gaming system to play with. Without having to bling it out?
590180	596660	Yeah, and I just got her today. I got her a pink case to go with it, so she's all pinked
596660	599820	out. So, before we get into housekeeping and gaming
599820	603660	news tonight, let's talk about your birthday gathering, Loki. You didn't mention anything
603660	607980	about our little trip this week. The real life game we played this week.
607980	614420	Yeah, we went to Stars in Vacaville, which is this bowling alley slash entertainment
614420	622220	center. It's got Qsar laser tag in there, which I think is the best laser tag game ever.
622220	627500	Of course, if you played at Stars, it is not the best laser tag game ever. It is pretty
627500	631620	bad actually nowadays, and this is probably the last time we'll be going back there.
631620	640580	The packs were horrible. I mean, just broken in every which way you can imagine. In fact,
640580	645580	I think the very first game I had, my pack had no speaker on it, so I couldn't tell whether
645580	650100	I was hitting people when I was out of lives, anything like that. Plus, it didn't shoot
650100	655620	straight, which didn't help either. They claimed that their computer system is
655620	660180	broken so that they can't change the game settings, which is bullshit because they said
660180	665660	the same thing last time and I yelled at them and they finally did it. Also, the people
665660	671820	that work there are complete morons. In fact, they didn't really give a shit about anything.
671820	676420	The second game, for example, we beat the other team by 800 points.
676420	683740	That game was awesome. It was the worst pummeling I've ever seen.
683740	687540	In the first game, the pack I had, I was like invincible. You could only kill me by shooting
687540	691340	my gun because my front and back was out. There were so many things wrong with that.
691340	697580	Eric went with us on Punk Night. I don't know anyone that might know him on Final Fantasy
697580	703620	11 or World of Warcraft, but he had a pack that said that he only fired five shots and
703620	710060	hit 59 people. His hit ratio is 100%. That's like ultimate bounce.
710060	715780	He never got hit, which is complete bullshit. He didn't fire. He fired a lot more than five
715780	720220	shots. The game was so fucked up and they really don't care.
720220	722380	So why don't you open your own?
722380	725020	Because it costs a lot of money to do that.
725020	726880	Can you get a loan?
726880	729980	Not that kind of a loan right now because I don't have property or any sort of collateral
729980	730980	to go with it.
730980	731980	Don't.
731980	737580	Car, but it's going to cost at least half a million dollars to open one of those places.
737580	743220	I'd love to do it because it's not that fucking hard. Shit, if they can run a laser tag place
743220	748900	there, and it may be poorly run, but they have just like two people doing it, it can
748900	750260	be done.
750260	755260	Not to mention, other than laser tag, we were just getting drinks in between games and stuff
755260	760100	and the fucker, and they have this little cafe or something that you can buy food at,
760100	764140	and they have one person working there pretty much at the counter and I guess running food
764140	765140	also.
765140	769220	So it took us 10 minutes to get a fucking soda because she kept helping other people
769220	774020	and I guess you fucked up orders and stuff like that.
774020	779900	It was just really horrible and none of the equipment at the laser tag place looked like
779900	784540	it had been repaired in years, it's just really fallen apart.
784540	788860	So fuck them, we will not be coming back.
788860	792420	You know, I want to point out last night was the first time I've seen a DDR machine in
792420	797180	a long time too, but the thing I thought was interesting is I kind of assumed that DDR
797180	801500	was kind of dead, and I know this might piss a lot of people off that obviously our show
801500	806500	started a long time ago about DDR, we all met playing Dance Dance Revolution and everything,
806500	808980	so I know it's kind of funny I'm saying this now, but I kind of thought most people play
808980	811620	Dance Dance Revolution at home now, because that's where all the new stuff comes out is
811620	815980	home and there's been some pretty decent mixes we've gotten on the home versions, but I was
815980	819060	kind of surprised, there was a little crowd of kids all around the supernova machine that
819060	822780	only appeared to be half working, like the monitor was screwed up on that thing, but
822780	828700	I kind of walked by and was just like, hmm, some kid was doing max 300, it's like you're
828700	830380	not cool unless you can do max 300 these days.
830380	834720	Well he worked there too, he was the one that marshaled their second game, I wouldn't even
834720	839040	call it marshaling, or for example I was arguing with him because he's like, yeah those two
839040	844220	packs in the back work, I'm like no, we played those packs last game, they're fucking broken,
844220	848140	and the laser doesn't shoot straight, and he's like, well you mean the laser?
848140	852220	I'm like no, the emitter does not shoot straight, oh, well they're still working, I'm like no
852220	857620	they're not, you fucking retard, I just hate talking to them, especially when they're saying
857620	860440	that their system's broken, I'm like, do I need to come back there and set up my own
860440	863980	damn game, because I know how to do it.
863980	867980	Interesting, I just thought it was interesting that there's still that whole little community
867980	873020	for DDR, but that's cool, I'm really glad, even though I kind of thought it was dead,
873020	876500	just because there hasn't been a whole lot of new stuff, I mean supernova didn't bring
876500	880260	a whole lot of new stuff to the table besides new songs, so I was just kind of surprised,
880260	881700	that's all.
881700	882700	So call me a cynic, whatever.
882700	883700	We need supernova too.
883700	884700	Hi cynic!
884700	885700	Shut up.
885700	891060	Alright, anyhow, let's see, let's get into some housekeeping for tonight, of which we
891060	897140	don't really have much, there's not a whole lot to say, so I will plug our MySpace and
897140	900260	LiveJournal communities, and ways that you can interact with us online, of course there's
900260	905560	our website, www.orangelandtrady.com, or we have a MySpace as well, you should add us,
905560	910020	and we'll be your friend on MySpace, and sometimes we post little things up there, especially
910020	914740	like bonus shows, and weird things we tape other places, for instance we taped a show
914740	918780	at AnatomyCon earlier this year that you could only get in our communities, so it's MySpace.com
918780	922500	slash OrangeLoungeRadio, you can add us there, or you can add us on LiveJournal, our community
922500	926700	on LiveJournal is also OrangeLoungeRadio, so there you go, actually no, I think we're
926700	929220	OrangeLounge on LiveJournal, I can't remember.
929220	936220	I think that I don't remember, I don't remember either, I think we're just OrangeLounge on
936220	941300	LiveJournal, I'm trying to look right now, this is great radio I know, this is the best
941300	946980	radio ever, I'm really excited to be a part of this, it's just completely amazing, next
946980	952860	time before I, yeah there it is, we're just OrangeLounge on LiveJournal, there you go,
952860	959580	let's see, I don't look at our MySpace anymore, Rioma says Wii online laser tag, dude, would
959580	965020	that be awesome, an online laser tag with a Wii, no, I don't know, you know what would
965020	971220	have been awesome is Metroid Prime 3 online, but that's just me, yeah that'd be awesome,
971220	977060	there was some actual online content, alright, with a Wii, let's get into some gaming news
977060	983620	then since we've given the community's ample plugging, yes, big news coming just before
983620	993900	Tokyo Game Show here, including some big announcements, including the inclusion of Rez Ikaruga Exit
993900	1000900	and more on Xbox Live Arcade, which is really awesome, this news makes me so happy, Rez,
1000900	1010420	Rez, Rez, they need to do like a new trans vibrator thing, I doubt it, anyways, yeah,
1010420	1018700	Microsoft had their pre-show conference and Tetsuya Mizuguchi, of course, they're confirming
1018700	1025380	that both his, I guess remake of Rez, Rez HD, which is pretty much just Rez in high
1025380	1032700	definition, yay, and then of course Ikaruga Exit, which has appeared on the PSP, and of
1032700	1038380	course some that have already been announced already, Every Extend, Extra Extreme, and
1038380	1045500	of course Omega 5, also known as E, sorry, I'm going to my happy place right now, and
1045500	1050100	Trigger Heart Alexia, if I mentioned I love Tetsuya Mizuguchi, you know what would make
1050100	1053820	me happier with all of that, if they're giving us Ikaruga, why can't they give us another
1053820	1058660	release of Radiant Silver Gun, wrong twice now, alright, anyways, lots of awesome games
1058660	1066700	coming to Xbox Live Arcade, so, yay, I'm excited, I'll definitely be buying Rez, Jamie, explain
1066700	1073860	for our listeners what makes Rez so awesome, thump, thump, thump, I can't explain what
1073860	1079020	makes Rez so great, but it's totally one of those trippy things, it's like playing Vibribbin,
1079020	1083900	it reminds me of those old trance music videos that you used to see on MTV's AMP, like really
1083900	1087380	late at night, remember that show AMP, back when MTV actually played videos, it would
1087380	1090940	come on like 12 or 1 in the morning, like it reminded me of that show, except you were
1090940	1095860	playing it, and the cool thing about Rez is that as you're flying around shooting things,
1095860	1099780	the little lasers and stuff are all in time with the music, I can't explain it, but it's
1099780	1103940	like seriously one of those games you just zone out to, I can't think of any better way
1103940	1107300	to explain it, Vibribbin's kind of like that, but not to the extent that Rez is, you don't
1107300	1111480	zone out on it, but Vibribbin is definitely trippy enough that you have to blink again
1111480	1115500	when you move your eyes away from the screen, there you go, uh, Tigerclaw in our chatroom
1115500	1119160	at chat.orangelandtrader.com says, I guess Rez is the kind of game you play if you want
1119160	1124520	to create your own personal rave, sorta, sorta, there you go, fucking awesome at a rave I
1124520	1130340	think. Can you imagine playing that just at a rave? Huge, you know, giant screens. That
1130340	1134320	might be a way to kinda do it. People trippin' out and stuff, that'd be awesome. Alright,
1134320	1139180	so I'm very very happy about this news, it definitely takes me to my happy place, um,
1139180	1144300	Exit I haven't really checked out before, so I'm kind of interested in it. Well, I never
1144300	1147460	played it, but a lot of people love it, so it's one of those kind of niche things, but
1147460	1151580	just like Ikaruga was one of those niche games. By chance did they say when this- Ikaruga
1151580	1155740	was awesome. Did they say when this all was coming out? Uh, I know some of that list,
1155740	1161900	like the Omega 5 was supposed to be due out in November, so, soon? I know, um, was Every
1161900	1167400	Extend Extra Extreme is supposed to be coming out this year as well, I think, so. Nice.
1167400	1170820	I actually, I liked Every Extend Extra on the PSP, that's another one of those just
1170820	1173860	like totally chill out games. I need to borrow that from you. You want to? I'll go get it.
1173860	1178140	Okay. This is an awesome game for PSP, so. I will go find it, but first I'm gonna read
1178140	1184000	a story for you all about another awesome game, and of course, since we have a lot of
1184000	1187580	music game fans that listen to our program, you guys all know this game, Elite Beat Agents.
1187580	1191580	Hell, even the non-music game fans know this game, Elite Beat Agents. Oh my god. Good time.
1191580	1194680	Our Owen Don, for those of you guys who like to import the game. Well, what's cool about
1194680	1201440	this is that INIS, who actually developed Elite Beat Agents, they are currently working
1201440	1208420	on an unnamed Xbox 360 title. Now, that doesn't mean it's Elite Beat Agents 360, like, you
1208420	1211640	know, that would be really hard, because there's no touchscreen on the 360, but it's just kind
1211640	1215860	of cool that the development team is developing something for another system. They're not
1215860	1220400	just going to keep games on the DS, so they are making something on the Xbox 360. It should
1220400	1224940	be said that some of the other games that this company has made, Guitar Man, was another
1224940	1229500	game that they made. So, maybe Guitar Man 360? That'd be kind of rad. Well, they, you
1229500	1235240	know, did Guitar Man, well it was really just more like a Guitar Man remix on PSP, where
1235240	1240260	you could play as What's-Your-Face. Yeah, that's kind of like the Parappa thing on PSP.
1240260	1244260	It's missable. It's not the end of the world if you don't get it, right? Kick, punch. It's
1244260	1251260	all in the mind. Hey, my guitar is in my mind. Unjama Lamy 360. Oh, wait, that's not a Unjama
1252260	1257960	Lamy. That uses the Guitar Hero controller. That would be kind of cool for a live title
1257960	1261660	that uses that controller, but then again, it wouldn't be accessible to everybody. But
1261660	1265400	I think it would be cool to have like another music game on Xbox Live Marketplace, because,
1265400	1269460	you know, we have Boom Boom Rocket, but Boom Boom Rocket kind of died off. Like, they didn't
1269460	1272440	really expand on it at all. I was thinking there was going to be download packs that
1272440	1276740	maybe had some better songs, because the default songs are just all like classical song remixes
1276740	1282340	that aren't that great. So, there's kind of a lack of music game stuff. Like playing V
1282340	1286420	for five hours? Well, that's just, you know, going to the arcade when DDR Extreme first
1286420	1290660	came out, but that's a whole other story. So, anyway. Well, I'm excited to see what
1290660	1295340	the team comes up with for the 360. Well, this puts me in my happy place. I love Ninja
1295340	1300860	Gaiden, and we're getting a Ninja Gaiden 2, and you can kill a lot of people as Ryu, who's
1300860	1307100	like majorly cool and awesome with, oh, the only thing is that he doesn't have the cool
1307100	1314100	looking scarf, but otherwise. But Itadaki is basically saying, here we go, Ninja Gaiden
1314100	1320300	2 on Xbox 360, so that makes me happy. Man, it's uber violent. Lots of blood flying everywhere.
1320300	1324060	Yeah, I love violence and blood. Like, I like this picture of him totally cutting off this
1324060	1331060	guy's head, and it's like, it's not just blood, it's like this glorious fountain of crimson
1332340	1338340	floating toward the air and covering everything in, you know, it's glory. I think that's beautiful.
1338340	1345340	It's going to be pretty awesome. Something that's sort of awesome, I guess, Viva Pinata.
1345460	1352060	It's a game, of course. It came out last year. Some people liked it. I didn't. But, someone
1352060	1359060	decided that they love Viva Pinata so much that they proposed to their spouse on it.
1359460	1366460	And so, yes, it's, I don't know, cheesy. Very, very cheesy. I guess cute.
1366460	1370700	Just say no. But, I mean, why would you use Viva Pinata,
1370700	1377140	like, send a message over? I mean, that's just kind of cheesy.
1377140	1381020	As I understand it, wasn't it the case that, like, she actually didn't believe the guy
1381020	1385500	at first when she got the message or she laughed it off? It's like, ah ha ha, that's cute.
1385500	1388460	But then, like, the guy actually got down on one knee and proposed or something like
1388460	1392700	that? So. Yeah, so it. Okay, if you're thinking about
1392700	1396940	proposing to your spouse, don't do it over a game. I mean, seriously, I don't care how
1396940	1403940	much you two love the game. Do not do it over a game. It's really cheesy and stupid.
1404980	1410580	Why not? Jamie got proposed to over UHF. Well, it's not necessarily as much of a proposal
1410580	1417040	as much of a, we should just get married. Okay? When? Sometime. And, you know, seven
1417040	1421980	years later. It's just, it is pretty cheesy though. I mean.
1421980	1425700	It's no cheesier than the people who go to a basketball game and have it go out over
1425700	1428060	the big screen. You know, that's pretty cheesy too.
1428060	1432820	I'd be like, don't embarrass me into marrying you shit.
1432820	1437500	I'm kind of curious what other type of video game related proposals have happened. I'm
1437500	1440500	kind of looking at our chat room. I'm not seeing a whole lot of stuff there. But what
1440500	1444700	I thought was very interesting about this story is that a lot of sites really ran this,
1444700	1448260	although this is really someone's, you know, personal business. But some guy just got kind
1448260	1452520	of creative. I'm surprised that we never saw an Animal Crossing wedding proposal. Maybe
1452520	1455140	there was and I just forgot about it. But, you know.
1455140	1462100	Yeah, I mean, that's something I guess. I don't know. I was going to say, I know they've
1462100	1466940	done World of Warcraft, that's for sure. And Final Fantasy XI, I'm sure Second Life
1466940	1471620	has done it. You know, pretty much named the MMO and I'm sure that someone's tried to
1471620	1477300	get married over it. Or actually performed a ceremony in-game, which is a whole...
1477300	1481700	Like Ragnarok Weddings, remember Ragnarok? A whole other nerdy, oh my god.
1481700	1488340	It was actually in the game too, so hey. Need to unplug, seriously. And of course, you
1488340	1493060	know, especially with Final Fantasy XI, of course they're going to, you know, you can
1493060	1499940	do it and then they'll just milk you for any sort of in-game money for it.
1499940	1503940	Comments from chat, lots of comments from chat here. Chat.orangesonshadeo.com if you
1503940	1508420	want to comment live on this Sunday night. Escapist says, on one hand it's sort of touching,
1508420	1514900	on the other... Nochillynopitty says, I'm going to propose using an automated Super
1514900	1517660	Mario World level.
1517660	1521340	Oh my god, those are great. No, have you seen the automated?
1521340	1524660	Yeah, I've seen some YouTubage of those automated levels. Those are pretty awesome.
1524660	1528700	Those are amazing. I was watching them for like two hours on Friday night.
1528700	1532020	Jamie, I made this in your honor. Will you marry me?
1532020	1533020	No.
1533020	1538420	Let's see. RasteelUT says, well, there was that one couple in Japan that got married
1538420	1541420	in Phantasy Star Online. Wow.
1541420	1545900	Ryoma says, propose over PictoChat. That's a little interesting.
1545900	1552180	Well, you're going to be like 65 feet away. Come on. The least you could do is actually
1552180	1557420	go up to them and say, will you marry me? Instead of just like, look, I drew a little
1557420	1563920	picture that says, will you marry me? Aww, how cute. No. Just do it.
1563920	1570040	It's like, okay, you know, I hate to even quote like Kelly, but you don't text message
1570040	1577040	break up, okay? You don't text, you don't fucking PictoChat, you know, engage.
1577040	1585540	Oh my god, Loki, you're such a bitch. I'm going to bet slap you, deckhead. I can't believe
1585540	1587860	Loki quoted Kelly.
1587860	1595120	It's just, it's stupid. It really is. If you think it's cute, okay, great, it's cute, but
1595120	1601140	you know, anyone that doesn't play the game, like your parents, relatives, they're going
1601140	1603900	to be going, what?
1603900	1608660	What if like you sent a text message over PictoChat that said something like, you know,
1608660	1612660	open the book on the table and then the book has a ring in it and then like you're on one
1612660	1613660	knee. Would that be cute?
1613660	1618460	That would be cute, but okay, just doing it in Animal Crossing is kind of lame.
1618460	1620580	GS68 said the best thing ever.
1620580	1621580	What?
1621580	1622780	Will you be my 2P?
1622780	1623780	What's that? Where?
1623780	1624780	Second player.
1624780	1626460	Will you be my 2P? I get it.
1626460	1627460	That's cute.
1627460	1631100	There's some great comments in chat tonight. You guys are funny. Escapist says, better
1631100	1636680	PictoChat than Ping Pals. If I got proposed to in Ping Pals, I'd say no. I'd say you couldn't
1636680	1643100	find something better. No. Get out. In fact, get out of my house. Let's see. I like footy
1643100	1651420	monsters comment too. If I ever proposed to my girl on a game, she'd never see it. Wow.
1651420	1654500	That's kind of like Loki and proposing to Nellie. How did you propose to Nellie? I can't
1654500	1655500	remember.
1655500	1661900	It wasn't over PictoChat. That's for sure. It sure as hell wasn't over Viva Pinata.
1661900	1664700	Is it private or what? Can you share it?
1664700	1669020	No. We were talking about getting married for a while, so we didn't really have a proposal
1669020	1672940	or anything, but I sure as hell didn't do it over like Viva Pinata or anything.
1672940	1674260	Did you get on one knee and everything?
1674260	1679860	Actually, no, I didn't. Oh my God, you bastard. It doesn't matter. We were going to do it
1679860	1680860	anyways.
1680860	1685220	No, it's fine. The wedding was really nice, if nothing else. Even if you have no good
1685220	1686220	proposal story.
1686220	1687980	Even if you took my camera in the bathroom.
1687980	1694940	Do we have to get into those discussions? You know, that was a very M-rated experience,
1694940	1696700	and you know what they say about M-rated games?
1696700	1698480	Let's buy them.
1698480	1704420	That's right. Let's get them. This M-rated game is $300. M-rated games have higher scores
1704420	1711540	and better sales. That is to be if a recent study by the electronic entertainment design
1711540	1717820	and research firm is to be believed. They actually were evaluating some games that were
1717820	1724000	rated mature by the ESRB, even though mature rated games are only about 10% of what's out
1724000	1729580	there on what the ESRB rates. Apparently, these titles, quote, have both the highest
1729580	1735140	average metacritic scores and the highest average gross sales in the United States.
1735140	1742060	So apparently, having a mature rated game is actually a ticket to better sales. Who
1742060	1747580	knows? What do you guys think? Is this story surprising? I actually think this is a little
1747580	1748580	surprising.
1748580	1752300	I don't think it has anything to do with the fact that it's rated M or anything. I just
1752300	1756100	think a lot of the games that come out that are really good, they're your big blockbuster
1756100	1762220	games, are rated M. I mean, let's look at the last few things that have come out. Bioshock
1762220	1770780	was rated M. Stranglehold was rated M. Heavenly Sword, no, that's Teen. I think Halo's rated
1770780	1771780	M.
1771780	1777440	Okay, and that's fine for the hardcore gamers like us, but sometimes us hardcore gamers
1777440	1781960	keep discounting the casual gamers. You know, it wasn't like the top-selling game last year
1781960	1783860	based on some movie, you know?
1783860	1784860	Cars?
1784860	1785860	Yeah, Cars.
1785860	1786860	That was a horrible game.
1786860	1791020	But, you know, Cars is an E-rated game, I'm sure. It would be kind of cool if there was
1791020	1792460	an M-rated Cars edition.
1792460	1796940	It might make it a little bit better, but not much.
1796940	1803740	So anyway, if you want to visit the Electronic Entertainment Design and Research, it's EEDAR.com,
1803740	1808460	and they have a whole little press release about it on their site. So check it out.
1808460	1815460	And hopefully this will bode well for the upcoming release of Manhunt 2, but we'll see.
1815460	1818800	So that's all I have to say on the M-rated games. I'm actually looking to see if there's
1818800	1821040	anything in chat here.
1821040	1825260	Ryoma seems to agree, because mature-rated games include Metal Gear Solid, Halo, and
1825260	1827260	GTA.
1827260	1829140	Let's see.
1829140	1834120	No Chilly No Pity says, that's weird. Comedy films potentially make a lot more rated as
1834120	1839100	PG-13 versus R. Kind of an interesting comparison there.
1839100	1842260	But Ross Deal UT says, well, that's in theaters. What about DVD?
1842260	1843260	Hmm.
1843260	1844260	Interesting.
1844260	1851160	Well, in other news, speaking of news since you brought up movies, Activision has a demo
1851160	1859660	out for Spider-Man Friend or Foe on Xbox Live. It's 432 megabytes, and what you do is you
1859660	1865900	either play as Spider-Man or you are in a co-op mode with either the Green Goblin or
1865900	1872380	Venom. And you can, in the demo, you fight Dr. Octopus, which is kind of cool.
1872380	1879260	So it's going to be on PS2, 360, and Wii put out by Next Level Games. They also gave us
1879260	1884020	Mario Strikers. Mario Strikers Charged, I'm sorry.
1884020	1887140	And there's a PC version, I think, too.
1887140	1892100	I was also going to say, there's some other stuff that's come out on Live. They had the
1892100	1896820	demo for, well, it's actually another demo, I guess, for Juice 2. It's a multiplayer demo
1896820	1904360	now, so you can check that out as well. I want to say Tony Hawk's Proving Grounds also
1904360	1909660	up there now. There's another one, too.
1909660	1912500	Have you played all the demos, Loki? Are you pretty good at staying on top of those?
1912500	1915220	I try to. I haven't gone around to a lot of them yet.
1915220	1917420	So what are the ones we need to be playing?
1917420	1921580	I would say Tony Hawk's going to be pretty good. I mean, usually Tony Hawk games are
1921580	1927820	pretty fun. Definitely play Flat-Out Ultimate Carnage. I cannot stress that enough. That
1927820	1931580	game is so awesome.
1931580	1936920	Timeshift might be okay. I don't know, I played an old-ass demo for it back when it was owned
1936920	1944660	by Atari, and it was okay then. I don't know if I'd buy that game, though, or not.
1944660	1951460	I would say, let's see, on PlayStation 3, I know Ratchet and Clank's, if you pre-order
1951460	1957700	it, you can get the demo with that. And then I was going to say they have Pixel Junk Racers,
1957700	1964580	but that's not really a demo, I guess. I don't know. There's still a lot of stuff. I'm sure
1964580	1967260	more demos are going to be coming out soon, especially the Tokyo Game Show and how they
1967260	1969140	do that bringing it home stuff.
1969140	1971300	True. Hoping for some really good shit.
1971300	1977300	SSJ100Matt says, I hear the new Flat-Out is getting closer and closer to a Burnout clone.
1977300	1981300	I think we talked about this a little bit last week. The box art certainly is, but the
1981300	1983420	game itself, Logi, from what you see?
1983420	1986660	Burnout's going in a completely different direction, so I guess you can compare it to
1986660	1991740	some of the older Burnouts, but the new Burnout game's nothing like it.
1991740	1994540	Isn't the new Burnout game more like Test Drive, where it's like an open world?
1994540	2000740	Sort of. It's just really open. I don't even know how to really describe it. It's just
2000740	2004940	kind of like an open world where you're driving around doing stunts, crashing. I guess it's
2004940	2008740	sort of like Test Drive, but a lot more interesting.
2008740	2014980	All right. Very cool. All right. Well, let's get into some release dates and talk about
2014980	2018420	not just the things you can download on Xbox Live, but what you can go run out and pick
2018420	2021420	up at stores this week around the globe.
2021420	2026900	Lots of big stuff. This week, of course, starting to really get into the fourth quarter stuff,
2026900	2031500	including, as I mentioned, there's a demo out for Just Two Hot Import Nights coming
2031500	2037660	out on PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 this week, as well as, well, PlayStation 3's coming out
2037660	2041660	the week after, because you know all those PlayStation 3 delays.
2041660	2047860	And then, on PlayStation 2, if you happen to love Karaoke, well, there's quite a bit
2047860	2052860	of it this week. Sing Star 80s is coming out both the game by itself and a game bundled
2052860	2059380	with microphones, as well as, Sing Star Amped in both versions there.
2059380	2067540	And let's see, also on PlayStation 2 and 360, we have Warriors Orochi, which is a very unique
2067540	2073180	game by Koei that combines Samurai Warriors with Dynasty Warriors. So, if you love the
2073180	2077700	Dynasty Warriors games, it's yet another one.
2077700	2083420	On PSP, Coded Arms Contagion, finally coming out, as well as Yu-Gi-Oh! GX...
2083420	2085420	I thought that game got cancelled.
2085420	2086940	No, that was the PlayStation 3 one.
2086940	2087940	Oh.
2087940	2097340	Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 2, also coming out on PSP. Let's see, on PS3 this week, Stuntman
2097340	2104220	Ignition, finally coming out. And then, also on 360, Eternal Sonata, which is going to
2104220	2105220	be pretty big.
2105220	2106300	Sold. I'm so getting that game.
2106300	2110900	What were you telling me about Eternal Sonata before the show started tonight, Jamie?
2110900	2115540	Well, I'd know that Chopin killed himself by drinking cholera and vested water because
2115540	2116540	of his lifestyle.
2116540	2120020	Yes, he was a gay guy or something, right?
2120020	2121020	Yes.
2121020	2122020	Where'd you read this, Wikipedia?
2122020	2123540	No, actually I learned it in music theory in high school.
2123540	2128180	Wow. That's interesting. But, like, you know, I totally read that the game is based on the
2128180	2133700	hallucinations he had before he died. That's, like, all kinds of rad, in my opinion, but
2133700	2135980	we'll talk more about it later, I guess.
2135980	2141220	I'm also coming out, Blades and Angels 2, Secret Missions of World War II. The first
2141220	2146020	game is kind of eh, but, you know, hey, you might like it.
2146020	2151020	Let's see, on the Wii, My Sims, also coming out on the DS as well.
2151020	2155500	Cosmic Family, if you have really little kids that like to learn, there you go.
2155500	2160980	Fishing Master, which is that Hudson-based fishing game, which I didn't think we really
2160980	2164380	saw too much of it, but eh, if you like fishing, it might be cool.
2164380	2171340	Mercury Meltdown Revolution, it's a cool puzzle game, only $20 for the Wii, so check it out.
2171340	2175460	Anubis 2, eh, budget game, so, eh, maybe.
2175460	2180180	And then, Dewey's Adventure is also coming out on the Wii.
2180180	2183300	Let's see, DS, my god, there's, like, way too much stuff this week.
2183300	2189540	DS, Digimon World Dawn and Dusk, as well as, I believe, Digimon World is also coming out
2189540	2192760	on Data Squad on PS2.
2192760	2200380	We've also got, let's see here, Frisbee Disc Bundle, which is Frisbee Disc Golf and Ultimate
2200380	2202580	Frisbee, woo hoo.
2202580	2208060	Nancy Drew is going to be getting the game, Namco Museum, actually, I hear the Nancy Drew
2208060	2212020	games are pretty awesome, I shouldn't just pass it off because it's a Nancy Drew game,
2212020	2213820	I've actually heard they're pretty awesome.
2213820	2220220	Namco Museum DS is coming out, and that's kind of interesting, I guess.
2220220	2224580	On PC, World in Conflict is coming out, I know that's going to be pretty big.
2224580	2231380	Then some of these weird games here, Big Buck Hunter, 30,000 games, I Love Kittens, I Love
2231380	2240060	Puppies, and, I Love Puppies 2, Loki, Stranglehold, I guess, is coming out as well, woo.
2240060	2246500	And I think there might be a couple other things on PS2 here, let me take a look, and
2246500	2253820	Pro Lancer 5, that one's actually supposed to be pretty big, some crappy Honda SBK07
2253820	2260780	Superbike game, and Safe and Filter Dark Mirror, and that's it.
2260780	2268180	Wow, lots and lots of stuff coming out this week in the US, and you know, the Japanese
2268180	2272020	launch calendar looks pretty full as well, not quite as much as we've got over here,
2272020	2274660	but certainly there's quite a bit of stuff coming out over there.
2274660	2280380	The Madden 08 Japanese version makes its way to the Xbox 360 this week on September 20,
2280380	2283980	2007, and it does look like it's localized there for Japan with the text and all that
2283980	2288740	stuff, but I imagine it's still the same teams, because it's still the NFL, so there you have
2288740	2289740	it.
2289740	2295340	Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Sengoku Musou Katana, which I'm imagining is a little
2295340	2298060	bit of a sword fighting game, I'm trying to look at some of the screenshots, and it kind
2298060	2301980	of reminds me, what's that old Sega arcade game, they have it like Dave and Buster's,
2301980	2304180	you can swing the sword around, what the hell is that game?
2304180	2305180	I can't remember the name of it.
2305180	2307420	Oh, I know what you're talking about, too.
2307420	2312180	It looks like it might be this kind of game, I don't know, so we'll go.
2312180	2313180	Go with that.
2313180	2318400	Anyhow, Burnout Dominator is coming out on the Playstation 2 in Japan, so check that out,
2318400	2324700	and coming out as well on the Playstation 2, Keniro no Korda 2 Anchor is coming out,
2324700	2328940	it's an RPG, also coming out on the Playstation 2, huh?
2328940	2332740	By the way, I have to correct myself, because once I thought about it, I realized it wasn't
2332740	2334300	upon it, it was Tchaikovsky.
2334300	2335300	Oh.
2335300	2340180	Oh, is it because, uh, people did their research on Wikipedia or something?
2340180	2344620	No, I knew that, and once I said it, I was like, no, that wasn't who it was, I'm sorry,
2344620	2345620	I'm correcting myself.
2345620	2347420	It's all good.
2347420	2350620	I'm still looking forward to the game, because it is based on hallucinations, one way or
2350620	2351620	the other.
2351620	2352620	I like hallucinations.
2352620	2355800	It's based on the 70s!
2355800	2359660	It's basically the musical hair in video game form, but not really.
2359660	2365340	Anyway, back to Japanese releases, Saint Beast, Rasen no Shu is coming out on the Playstation
2365340	2369780	2 as well, an action-based game, Saint Beast.
2369780	2376340	Coming out on the Nintendo DS, Deltora Quest, Sevensu no Hoseki is coming out, it's another
2376340	2382900	RPG game on the DS, as well as Elemental Monster, which looks to be a card-based action game.
2382900	2385820	Not sure what that is, if that's based on anime or what that is, but that's coming out
2385820	2387540	on the DS over there in Japan.
2387540	2393820	PSP is getting Burnout Dominator on the 20th over in Japan, and R-Type Tactics comes out
2393820	2400540	on, it's a strategy tactical game based on R-Type on the PSP, pretty awesome.
2400540	2401540	So there you have it.
2401540	2402540	It's not really R-Type then.
2402540	2403540	It is R-Type.
2403540	2408300	It's R-Type-ish, I don't know, but there you have it, that's what's coming out on the Japanese
2408300	2409300	calendar for September 20th.
2409300	2411400	It's only R-Type if you fly around and shoot stuff.
2411400	2414900	You do, in a turn-based strategy fashion.
2414900	2416780	That's not fun.
2416780	2418660	So how about some European release dates?
2418660	2419660	How about it?
2419660	2427060	Well, for our buddies in the UK, on the 20th, Loco Roco Cocorecho comes out on PlayStation
2427060	2434900	3, 21st Drawn to Life and My Sims, also My Sims is coming out on the Wii, and why is
2434900	2437100	there two listings for My Sims on the Wii?
2437100	2438100	Anyway.
2438100	2444340	It also, oh, there's two listings for it on Wii and DS, and one of them has a space and
2444340	2447420	one doesn't, I guess that makes it special.
2447420	2453420	SingStar Rock Ballads on PlayStation 2, Stranglehold on PC, and World in Conflict on PC.
2453420	2457020	Oh yeah, and Halo 3 on the 26, who cares.
2457020	2460580	And just in case if anyone's actually thinking about buying My Sims, just so you know, it's
2460580	2464300	not multiplayer, it's only one player.
2464300	2465300	Totally lame.
2465300	2467300	It's poo.
2467300	2468300	Yeah.
2468300	2469300	Anywho.
2469300	2470300	Alright.
2470300	2480580	One thing that's not quite as lame, but you can actually get Ratchet & Clank, the demo,
2480580	2486460	which will be coming out October the 4th, and looks pretty awesome, and that'll be on
2486460	2491140	PlayStation 3, actually a good PlayStation 3 game coming out for once.
2491140	2496220	And if you can't wait until October 4th like I did, you can also pre-order your game at
2496220	2501300	GameStop, and they have a demo disc for you.
2501300	2505100	I'm just snickering in chat because Escapist just said, oh I thought you guys were talking
2505100	2508740	about a game called My Sins for a second.
2508740	2510540	My god, these people need to only hear it.
2510540	2514860	Someone thought I said, when I said Big Butt Hunter, they thought, Big Butt Hunter?
2514860	2518020	I gotta get that game on PC, that's gonna be awesome.
2518020	2519980	That would be like Boonga Boonga.
2519980	2520980	Hosted by Sir Mix-a-Lot.
2520980	2521980	Big Butt Hunter.
2521980	2523100	That would be like Boonga Boonga.
2523100	2524740	Oh my god.
2524740	2526340	Mark Sakura, look at her butt.
2526340	2528340	It is so big.
2528340	2529340	Wow.
2529340	2535580	And now, why are they talking about, gosh, our chat room is random tonight.
2535580	2541060	JV Monn says, I want Silent Hill, the Hannah Montana edition.
2541060	2544580	To which Hippolytus responds, Silent Hill, Hannah Montana would never be as awesome as
2544580	2546740	Silent Hill, Britney Spears.
2546740	2549180	Go figure.
2549180	2553020	Although I do think in the next Silent Hill game, Pyramid Head should come out and go,
2553020	2554900	it's Pyramid Head, bitch.
2554900	2556140	Like the new Britney song?
2556140	2557580	Forget it.
2557580	2561020	Anyhow, more games on the way to the Playstation 3.
2561020	2564580	I don't know a whole lot about this game, so hopefully, you know, I haven't been following
2564580	2569420	PS3 like I should be, like a good amateur game journalist.
2569420	2574620	But on November 20th on the Playstation 3, Uncharted, Drake's Fortune is coming out.
2574620	2578500	So Loki, what is so amazing about this game that I should be paying attention to it for?
2578500	2582900	Well it's sort of amazing, it's basically Tomb Raider with a guy.
2582900	2585620	I've done Tomb Raider, you know what I mean?
2585620	2586620	Is he scantily clad?
2586620	2587620	He's not scantily clad.
2587620	2591420	They're companions kind of like Tomb Raider and he'd be like, Jones, there's a chick in
2591420	2597260	it, and you know, he shoots things and it's in a jungle, woo!
2597260	2600660	Go Naughty Dog for original content for the PS3.
2600660	2601660	That's funny.
2601660	2606460	Well there you have it, you can check it out for yourself on November 20th when Uncharted,
2606460	2607780	Drake's Fortune comes to the PS3.
2607780	2610640	Let me put it this way, you know what, if it's fun, I don't care if it's like Tomb Raider
2610640	2611640	with a guy.
2611640	2613140	Just wait, there's nothing else.
2613140	2614140	So enjoy.
2614140	2617580	Well there you have it.
2617580	2622780	I know I'll be first in line, but not really to get Uncharted.
2622780	2629380	Well we did discuss this a little bit earlier, but Eternal Sonata is coming out on PS3.
2629380	2633780	It has been confirmed, and we've already talked about it.
2633780	2634780	Shh!
2634780	2636980	What hasn't been confirmed?
2636980	2640900	Wait a minute, we did talk about Eternal Sonata, but we were talking about it on the 360, so
2640900	2644340	now we're hearing that the game is actually coming out on the PlayStation 3?
2644340	2645340	As well?
2645340	2646340	Namco says no.
2646340	2647340	What?
2647340	2648340	Yeah.
2648340	2651380	As I seem to recall, there's been a lot of drama that's played out on the internet this
2651380	2655740	week where, you know, oh yeah, for one, we're not supposed to talk about Namco's release
2655740	2663620	calendar on this show, but they seem to consistently do this, where they put these things out there,
2663620	2665240	whether it be on the ESRB, right?
2665240	2667300	Wasn't Eternal Sonata listed on the ESRB?
2667300	2668300	That it was pulled.
2668300	2669300	Twice.
2669300	2672060	It was on their own freaking website, then it was pulled.
2672060	2675340	It was also put back onto the ESRB list.
2675340	2677900	And now it's on the ESRB list again.
2677900	2679780	And it was on their website.
2679780	2683740	It's almost like Namco's doing this on purpose to keep getting the story bumped up to the
2683740	2684740	top of blogs.
2684740	2688780	I mean, Eternal Sonata is coming out this week after all, hmm.
2688780	2689780	How about Who Cares?
2689780	2696960	Let me put it this way, it's, obviously it's gonna still come out on PS3.
2696960	2700500	That is, I mean, if you believe that it's not, you're an idiot.
2700500	2704660	And I believe also Beautiful Katamari is listed on there for PlayStation 3 and the Wii as
2704660	2705900	well to be determined.
2705900	2711180	Which, you know, we didn't tell you that six months ago when the story first hit the internet.
2711180	2712820	I bet you anything.
2712820	2714580	We never changed our stance.
2714580	2715580	Everybody else did.
2715580	2718900	I bet you anything, it's still coming out next spring.
2718900	2719900	I agree.
2719900	2721300	It's confirmed in my head.
2721300	2727820	Not that Wii would, you know, say that, you know, but, you know.
2727820	2733740	Well I mean, Katamari on the PSP came out in March last, well was it 2005 or something?
2733740	2736860	I mean, I don't know.
2736860	2743740	I could see it coming out in spring with like a timed, exclusive, whatever, cause it's Katamari,
2743740	2744740	come on.
2744740	2747420	I mean, of course they're gonna put it on the Wii, it's got TILTI shit.
2747420	2748420	It's gimmicky.
2748420	2749420	People love gimmicky.
2749420	2752580	So, you know, it's just like the Wii and PS3.
2752580	2757180	I'm just, I'm just curious why like Namco is having like all these like, oh it's coming
2757180	2759940	out, oh no it's not, oh it's an exclusive, oh no it's not.
2759940	2760940	I mean.
2760940	2763640	Maybe they should start, you know, and this goes for all game companies.
2763640	2768180	If you don't want information put out there, you need to really be coordinating with every
2768180	2771940	single department of your company to make sure this information doesn't get out.
2771940	2772940	The right information.
2772940	2777860	Coordinate your marketing people with, you know, the web people, with the, I don't know,
2777860	2778860	ratings people.
2778860	2783020	I mean seriously, if it's on your website, people are gonna go, oh I think it's actually
2783020	2786540	coming out now because it's actually listed on your website.
2786540	2789780	And don't say, oh someone made a mistake, they weren't supposed to put that up there
2789780	2790780	yet.
2790780	2791780	Oops.
2791780	2795780	And don't talk about it in gag order and everybody better show them, we'll sue, we'll sue, we'll
2795780	2796780	sue.
2796780	2801100	Hey, how much you wanna bet that there may be, and this is just pure guessing, Tokyo
2801100	2805180	Game Show is, you know, right around the corner, how much you wanna bet there's an announcement
2805180	2807560	of some sorts.
2807560	2812700	Just like how right before E3 happened, a certain no-name website said something and,
2812700	2814700	you know, somebody wasn't happy about it.
2814700	2815700	Possibly.
2815700	2816700	Maybe.
2816700	2821380	Anyhow, thank you for that story on Eternal Sonata, Jamie.
2821380	2825740	In my mind, my head says yes.
2825740	2827420	It's never wrong.
2827420	2835140	Anyways, as we alluded to last week, that it was only a matter of time before the impenetrable
2835140	2841780	3.6 firmware of the PSP was cracked, and guess what?
2841780	2844980	Wait, wait, wait, wait, I wanna know why Darkstalker's laughing, are you laughing because of Loki's
2844980	2846980	big vocabulary?
2846980	2848500	Nothing.
2848500	2856180	Anyways, so Team M33 has cracked it, there is now a custom version of the firmware out
2856180	2858620	there that allows you to run some homebrew.
2858620	2863540	The problem is right now they can't get support for the 1.5 kernel, which, you know, before
2863540	2867940	it was able to run all the homebrew stuff, so now people are kinda having to go back,
2867940	2873860	retool things, so some things work, some things don't, eventually though, as things progress
2873860	2879820	and more firmwares come out, that they will be able to support more things.
2879820	2883500	There's a small list of stuff I think that they support some of the emulators, I don't
2883500	2887040	think the ISOs work yet, and then some other stuff.
2887040	2892340	But hopefully that means I can put homebrew onto my TV, because I did happen to go through
2892340	2899100	the process of loading it onto my PSP Slim, and let me tell you, it's not that easy, but
2899100	2903620	once you've done it, it's pretty simple, it basically involves building the Pandora's
2903620	2911280	battery, which is interesting in itself, and what you do with that is you, I guess they
2911280	2916980	call it extending the Pandora's battery, you basically put some parts of different firmwares
2916980	2920900	on there and then it works.
2920900	2924020	Once you've done the Pandora's battery, it's pretty easy, and they actually have programs
2924020	2929140	out there to make it walk you through step by step what to do, so it's pretty simple,
2929140	2933080	but definitely worth checking out, I'm sure that we're gonna see some more stuff coming
2933080	2934080	from that.
2934080	2943820	Of course, Sony hearing that released 3.7 on the PSP, the firmware to break what other
2943820	2949700	people have done on 3.6, and now they have custom theme support, which I will remind
2949700	2954840	everybody has been available in the homebrew scene for quite a while now, but you can download
2954840	2958740	official themes, which also, by the way, can be cracked apart and put on custom.
2958740	2962420	Wait, wait, wait, I thought there's been themes on the PSP forever.
2962420	2966440	This is actually like customizing themes, you can adjust, you can put like a wallpaper
2966440	2970780	in the background and stuff like that, this is actually changing all the icons, etc.
2970780	2973420	Oh, that's interesting, okay, cool.
2973420	2978960	You can do this on custom firmwares right now, and it's been available for a long time,
2978960	2985140	but people have already found ways to crack those theme files apart, and yeah, just nothing
2985140	2986180	to save.
2986180	2989460	Other things have been supported, I guess, more, where you can assign buttons in remote
2989460	2995900	play, so maybe that will allow you to play lair a little bit easier on the PSP.
2995900	3001780	I guess sequential playback is now supported under video, and simultaneous playback under,
3001780	3008560	I guess, music in photos, so you can play music while viewing your photos.
3008560	3012180	Other interesting stuff, right after this came out, I guess they had dumped that firmware,
3012180	3018260	and now there's 3.71, so it will never end, never ever.
3018260	3023980	Well, you know, I guess like Homebrew and changing little things around is one thing,
3023980	3027220	but when folks can play pirated games on there, Sony's got to do what they got to do.
3027220	3031860	Yeah, they got to do what they got to do, and they got to do it, they got to do it not
3031860	3032860	very well either.
3032860	3036420	They have to be mediocre.
3036420	3037420	Well that's fine.
3037420	3038420	I think you're going to be mediocre because that's it.
3038420	3042460	I applaud their mediocrity because, you know what, that allows me to have a lot more fun
3042460	3043460	with my PSP.
3043460	3045460	Oh my gosh, alright.
3045460	3050100	Moving on, I want to talk about Manhunt 2, because god damn, this game just cannot stay
3050100	3055300	out of the news in anticipation for its Halloween release date, I suppose.
3055300	3060380	Well people have been asking a whole lot about how did the game come down from an AO rating
3060380	3061620	to an M rating?
3061620	3063820	What exactly was taken out of the game?
3063820	3069020	Well IGN got to take a look at what was going on with the game and what exactly was changed,
3069020	3073860	and one of their reporters is actually reporting that yes, there have been some changes.
3073860	3078220	For instance, you might remember an earlier report where the killer could use a, guys
3078220	3082660	cross your legs, the killer could use a pair of pliers to literally rip the balls off of
3082660	3085900	a hunter.
3085900	3087380	Well that scene has been taken out.
3087380	3088380	So damn.
3088380	3091380	I was looking forward to that.
3091380	3092780	Well that's okay.
3092780	3095740	Here's the thing though, one of the biggest changes that they've done is that Rockstar
3095740	3101180	has made a blur effect to some of the major death blows in the game.
3101180	3105580	So in the M rated version there's like this blur effect that goes on or the graphics get
3105580	3108980	darkened a little bit, so it's really hard to tell what's going on because it becomes
3108980	3113260	like this kind of like motion blur type thing that doesn't make it so clear.
3113260	3120220	Well that's why they made the killing the crazy 88 scene in Kill Bill black and white
3120220	3121220	in the US.
3121220	3122220	That's true.
3122220	3123220	That's how censorship things happen.
3123220	3126900	So yeah, that's kind of interesting, but what, changing it to black and white made it that
3126900	3127900	much different?
3127900	3130340	I'm not seeing the blood as red or something.
3130340	3131700	I've seen it without it.
3131700	3132700	Wow.
3132700	3134020	It's ridiculous is all it is.
3134020	3135020	That's just like the...
3135020	3136860	It's people who aren't getting laid.
3136860	3140140	That's just like when they change the blood to sweat.
3140140	3142980	That will forever be my favorite rating thing that was done.
3142980	3146780	Let's pet someone's neck and look at how much sweat comes out.
3146780	3149740	Damn.
3149740	3151220	So there you have it.
3151220	3155340	Those are some of the big changes that are in the Manhunt 2.
3155340	3160020	I would still say though, I think this game is going to come out and I think the adults
3160020	3162660	only version will still come out on the PC later on.
3162660	3165300	Okay, but here's some other interesting things though.
3165300	3167180	Apparently they're talking about different cut scenes.
3167180	3173240	In one cut scene, a masked killer uses a power saw to slice a man's bulging belly as the
3173240	3176580	victim lies helpless strapped to a table.
3176580	3179900	That's okay for M, but oh my God.
3179900	3184780	If they rip off fake balls on a goddamn 3D model of somebody...
3184780	3191740	Well, I mean, that does kind of make everybody go, you know, that has them collectively go
3191740	3194460	oh, hey, oh, crush your legs.
3194460	3195460	Ow.
3195460	3196460	The ESRB is so hilarious.
3196460	3199060	So, well, I don't know.
3199060	3202660	I have to admit my interest on this game is kind of, you know, at first it was kind of
3202660	3206220	like, yeah, this might be kind of fun, but now I'm just like, eh.
3206220	3209660	I mean, it just sounds like Uber violence the game and I'm just, I'm not, you know,
3209660	3213860	I don't like those movies like Saw and stuff, so I probably won't like this game, so I don't
3213860	3214860	think I'm going to buy it.
3214860	3219220	Unless, I mean, unless it gets incredible reviews and there's something about the game
3219220	3222020	I just have to see, I'm not really in it for the, you know...
3222020	3225580	I'm kind of interested in the Wii murdering of people.
3225580	3229780	That is interesting, but not, I don't know, I'll just go to your house and play it, man.
3229780	3234380	To be very honest, there's not a lot of Wii games out there that I want to buy right now
3234380	3236700	and unfortunately that's the next one in line.
3236700	3240740	It's not necessarily that I want to go around murdering people with the Wii remotes, even
3240740	3244340	though I do find humor in that, but I don't know.
3244340	3248980	Now RossdielUT in our chatroom says, Manhunt 2, a trash game selling on controversy alone.
3248980	3250280	Sad, sad thing.
3250280	3254540	And I sort of agree, except I don't want to pass the game off as trash without having
3254540	3258220	actually gotten to play it, but, you know, I will definitely kind of want to look at
3258220	3259580	reviews and things.
3259580	3263580	You know, this game certainly doesn't stay in the news for its incredible innovations
3263580	3265720	that it's bringing to the gaming scene.
3265720	3268440	I'll give you that, but look at Hostel.
3268440	3269840	There's a perfect example.
3269840	3273300	There's another movie that's probably trash that's selling on controversy alone.
3273300	3278100	I won't say that the game won't sell, I'm just saying I don't care.
3278100	3281940	So I didn't watch Hostel either, because I heard it was...
3281940	3282940	I have no interest in those.
3282940	3283940	I know, I know.
3283940	3287980	Like, no, it's just weird, like sometimes I will watch the very gory movies, like The
3287980	3291100	Descent was pretty gory and I loved it, but it was like...
3291100	3292100	That's more suspense though, isn't it?
3292100	3295980	Yeah, it was way, like, more, just the way it was directed over the years, it was scary.
3295980	3299700	That's one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, The Descent.
3299700	3300700	Anyway.
3300700	3307580	Well, for other news though, regarding Manhunt 2, people were interviewed to see whether
3307580	3314980	or not they would be interested in buying it and there were only 18% of the people polled
3314980	3318660	who said they were going to buy it when it launches on Halloween.
3318660	3325020	52% said, no, and 30% said, uh, what?
3325020	3327540	That many people clicked a button that said, uh, what?
3327540	3328540	And decided.
3328540	3330540	Oh, okay.
3330540	3337660	That's, well, so, so apparently only 18% of the, that's still, I don't know, I mean, 18%
3337660	3343820	to me kind of seems like a large chunk of the gaming community, I mean, if you can sell
3343820	3347300	out of one to every five people that own a Wii this game, that's still quite a lot of
3347300	3352180	copies moved, so I don't think it's as bad as they're saying, but I think a good, a better
3352180	3359100	question would be, were you planning to buy the adult only one and now you're not going
3359100	3360100	to anymore?
3360100	3361100	Exactly.
3361100	3362100	I'm kind of curious to see what the result is of that one.
3362100	3365820	At the end of the day though, it doesn't really matter to, like, any of the console makers,
3365820	3373060	it really just fucks over Take-Two again and Rockstar, so, oh well, stop making such violent
3373060	3374060	games.
3374060	3378460	Yeah, but, oh well, I guess we'll see, I mean, again, it all really depends on the reviews
3378460	3379460	for me.
3379460	3382100	Release it on PC, un-rated, there you go.
3382100	3384180	We'll see.
3384180	3385180	You will see.
3385180	3392340	Anyways, um, oops, I knocked the ferret on the floor, um, good, I hope it died.
3392340	3398380	If you happen to be a stupid kid trying to buy games at GameStop, well, there might be
3398380	3403700	one particular GameStop in South Dallas that won't be selling you games.
3403700	3409360	In fact, he's breaking corporate policy and he refuses to sell games to school kids who
3409360	3414460	can't prove that they're doing well in school and apparently the manager is Brandon Scott
3414460	3421780	and he makes sure that an adult can verify that the child is getting good grades, otherwise
3421780	3423820	he won't sell them a game.
3423820	3424820	Any game.
3424820	3425820	Ever.
3425820	3430620	So, um, he says, I'm probably going to get in the trouble for this, but to me it's worth
3430620	3433940	it because the kids understand that somebody cares.
3433940	3435540	You know who doesn't care?
3435540	3438460	Probably GameStop corporate and you're going to get fired.
3438460	3439660	Congratulations.
3439660	3444780	You know, I'm very tempted, like, there's a, you know, the part of me that is very like,
3444780	3448500	you know, aha, people get what they deserve, aha, wants to kind of applaud what this guy
3448500	3453220	is doing, but when I really kind of sit there and think about it, I go like, you know, this
3453220	3454780	is kind of screwed up.
3454780	3455780	It is screwed up.
3455780	3459740	I mean, I think it should be up to the parents what the kids get, period.
3459740	3461060	Now, now, period.
3461060	3465900	I don't have a problem with him deciding to do that, if he owned his own game store, but
3465900	3470500	he doesn't and so he's, you know, I think it's a great idea that you shouldn't sell
3470500	3474780	games to kids that are stupid, but, you know, there's a lot of reasons not to sell games,
3474780	3475780	you know, to certain kids.
3475780	3481180	Hell, I was at a, a playing trade this week and I was looking at, they were doing their
3481180	3487540	grand opening and there was a kid, no parents watching him, kid, couldn't have been like
3487540	3491660	10, 11 years old playing Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
3491660	3492660	Just sitting there playing.
3492660	3497760	He's like, I just killed a hooker, you know, it's like, come on people and then you're
3497760	3502380	bitching about, oh, I didn't know Billy was playing such a violent game.
3502380	3504380	You may, you need the one, parents are stupid.
3504380	3507940	Don't let a GameStop type store babysit your children then.
3507940	3511860	What you need to do though, I mean, I applaud him for making that decision.
3511860	3517020	I mean, granted, it's probably going to be great for the store, but, you know, once that
3517020	3518860	off his conscience, great.
3518860	3520180	He's not going to be able to do it though.
3520180	3524500	I think at a GameStop and I'm afraid that, you know, once this news gets back to them
3524500	3525740	that these can probably be fired.
3525740	3528580	Let's go to the chat because the chat has some follow up here.
3528580	3533760	I've got a GS68 in our chat room that says good grades does not equal good behavior.
3533760	3538860	You know, that's, you know, there are a lot of kids there who weren't necessarily motivated.
3538860	3541660	They might be good kids, they're just not motivated to get good grades.
3541660	3543940	Whatever happened to me my senior year of high school.
3543940	3548820	I was in school and stuff and if I would get good grades, my parents would reward me by
3548820	3550060	buying me something, you know.
3550060	3553940	That was kind of my thing too is that my parents did what this guy did.
3553940	3556200	If I got good grades, I got stuff.
3556200	3561860	If I didn't get good grades, I got, you know, locked in a cellar.
3561860	3562860	So but...
3562860	3565020	And silly Bob, you don't have a cellar.
3565020	3568940	I had to live in the closet under the stairs like Harry Potter.
3568940	3573780	The kids, if they can't buy their games from GameStop or whatever, they'll just go somewhere
3573780	3574780	else.
3574780	3578460	You don't, you're not the only fucking game store on the planet, you moron.
3578460	3579460	I mean people...
3579460	3582620	Well, Rama wants to say Loki, he was suspended.
3582620	3584620	Way to go!
3584620	3585620	That's what you get for doing good things.
3585620	3588900	Dark Tetsuya says, well the adult should be there to buy the game anyway.
3588900	3589900	Exactly.
3589900	3598460	And Frisbee in their best Maury Povich impression says, you are not the father.
3598460	3599460	Get it?
3599460	3600460	Because the guy is not the father?
3600460	3601460	GameStop.
3601460	3604300	I don't even know if that was supposed to be an Maury Povich impression, I just felt
3604300	3605300	like saying it.
3605300	3608620	GameStop, you are not the father.
3608620	3610740	You are not the father.
3610740	3612900	Not the mama.
3612900	3614940	Yes, old school.
3614940	3618540	Escapist says, I've had eight year olds in my stores talking about how awesome Grand
3618540	3619860	Theft Auto was too.
3619860	3622140	But I wonder if a lot of that is hype.
3622140	3624780	Like you gotta wonder how many of those kids actually played the game.
3624780	3627700	Like sometimes, I mean, obviously there's some screwed up kids like, you know, the one
3627700	3629340	Loki was talking about earlier playing the game.
3629340	3632700	But you gotta wonder, like sometimes eight year olds are just full of talk.
3632700	3633700	You know what I mean?
3633700	3636700	Like none of them have probably played the game, but they hear their brother talking
3636700	3638140	about it or something like that.
3638140	3640140	I don't know.
3640140	3644260	It's a whole little tangent we'll say for another day.
3644260	3645540	That's poop-tastic.
3645540	3648900	But for today, I will get to another story.
3648900	3652740	If you don't want to buy your games at GameStop anymore in this, what was it, South Dallas
3652740	3653740	you said?
3653740	3654740	South Dallas.
3654740	3657100	So, well maybe you can go to Radio Shack now.
3657100	3661420	Because even though some Radio Shack stores have been carrying games for a while, apparently
3661420	3666660	Radio Shack as a corporation will now start actually carrying more video games in a couple
3666660	3668660	weeks.
3668660	3671700	Weren't they doing a Halo 3 pre-sale there, I think?
3671700	3672700	Probably a lot of stores were.
3672700	3673700	I don't know.
3673700	3674700	Who isn't?
3674700	3676620	I'm doing a Halo 3 pre-sale.
3676620	3679300	You know Walmarts are staying open until midnight and everything.
3679300	3680300	I don't know.
3680300	3681300	It's a little bit exciting.
3681300	3682300	Isn't that it?
3682300	3683300	And the Halo 3's release is what?
3683300	3684300	Isn't it like next Friday?
3684300	3688620	I unfortunately was over at GameStop quite a bit this week, just for different reasons,
3688620	3690620	buying systems.
3690620	3696300	But they had a sign in their door that said that the line starts at 9pm the night before
3696300	3697300	for Halo.
3697300	3698300	Geez.
3698300	3699300	Hooray!
3699300	3700300	What day does Halo come out?
3700300	3701300	I forget.
3701300	3702300	25th.
3702300	3703300	25th?
3703300	3704300	Oh, so it's next Tuesday.
3704300	3706060	So, I cannot wait for it to be over.
3706060	3707700	I really cannot.
3707700	3711660	Well, unfortunately what is not clear at this time, don't know if it's going to be, you
3711660	3715260	know, like they're going to turn the whole store into games like GameStop EV.
3715260	3716420	Probably not.
3716420	3719740	But I can see that they'll probably have a little corner of the store dedicated to video
3719740	3720740	games.
3720740	3721740	I mean, why not?
3721740	3723620	Because they sell a lot of the, you know, accessories and things anyway.
3723620	3727300	So, and they sell other types of gaming things, you know.
3727300	3730740	But you know what Radio Shack sells that's awesome that I used to have when I was a kid?
3730740	3731740	Total tangent.
3731740	3732740	RC cars.
3732740	3736940	That and you know those little things that were like, build 300 electronic devices in
3736940	3737940	one.
3737940	3740260	And it had like the little springs and you could attach the wires to the springs and
3740260	3743180	build all these little devices, like they're different types of transits.
3743180	3747580	Like you could build a little amateur radio or you could build a little light switch.
3747580	3748580	Like all these dumb little things.
3748580	3749580	I was learning about electronics.
3749580	3750580	Yeah.
3750580	3751580	It was all kinds of cool.
3751580	3753580	I got one at a garage sale years ago and I loved it.
3753580	3754580	I hate Radio Shack.
3754580	3758140	They're so damn expensive when it comes to anything like component wise.
3758140	3764500	You're buying video cables, audio cables, you're better off somewhere else, seriously.
3764500	3768420	I go to Radio Shack to buy lithium batteries and that's about it.
3768420	3769500	There's cables.
3769500	3771340	I have a lot of AV cable needs.
3771340	3772340	And I bought a microphone there before.
3772340	3773340	Yeah, a microphone.
3773340	3774340	Oh, I think our microphones.
3774340	3775340	Our old microphones were.
3775340	3776860	No, yeah, the old ones were.
3776860	3778860	These are the newer ones from the guitar place, right?
3778860	3783260	The one I used at my what to do pump up the volume for the longest time was Radio Shack.
3783260	3789260	I was going to go to GameStop to buy some stuff for our setup at work for the LAN stuff,
3789260	3792940	like some headsets and audio cables.
3792940	3795140	It was going to cost me $80 to buy it there.
3795140	3801180	I ended up shopping this place that my co-workers recommended, cablewholesale.com.
3801180	3804380	I would say it was $15 instead of $80.
3804380	3808820	So just so you know, don't shop there.
3808820	3809820	So here's my question.
3809820	3813360	Remember when the Wii launched, we went out and we gave orange soda to people and cookies
3813360	3814360	and stuff?
3814360	3815360	What should we do for the Halo 3 launch?
3815360	3817580	Should we go out on Monday night and do something for the kids in line?
3817580	3818580	Give them crack.
3818580	3819580	There's some difference.
3819580	3820580	I don't want to go out on a Monday night.
3820580	3821580	Loki's like, I'm tired.
3821580	3822580	I am all.
3822580	3823580	Let me sleep.
3823580	3824580	Fuck this.
3824580	3825580	I don't want to talk to Halo.
3825580	3828100	I mean, I guess you could bring him the Game Fuel shit.
3828100	3830160	I really don't want to talk to Halo fans.
3830160	3832140	What about the journalist in you, Loki?
3832140	3834500	Doesn't the journalist in you want to go out there and talk to the people?
3834500	3836860	I despise Halo 3 right now.
3836860	3838500	Just, I don't know, retail sampling.
3838500	3839500	That's your personal vendetta.
3839500	3842540	That is my personal vendetta.
3842540	3843860	I don't see the point.
3843860	3845860	All right, well, we'll see.
3845860	3849020	I like the idea of going out and giving him Game Fuel.
3849020	3850500	Maybe we'll see about that.
3850500	3851860	Ah, Game Fuel.
3851860	3852860	All right.
3852860	3855060	Ah, here's a little fuel for you guys.
3855060	3858940	It's a new website that you should be pointing your browsers to this week because, of course,
3858940	3862740	the one and only DarkSakura surfs the internet up and down and all around every week and
3862740	3866460	finds one website worthy of sharing with you all.
3866460	3870820	It's DarkSakura's website of the week, and she's going to tell you what it is right now.
3870820	3871820	Do it.
3871820	3872820	Right now.
3872820	3873820	No.
3873820	3874820	Yes.
3874820	3875820	I refuse.
3875820	3881580	Okay, my website of the week is actually DeviantArt again because, um, I'm going to plug a bunch
3881580	3886860	of people's DeviantArt sites like mine.
3886860	3891300	So deviantart.com, and for those that maybe haven't heard this before, what is DeviantArt?
3891300	3895500	You go and put your art and whore yourself out for comments and page views.
3895500	3898380	Why am I doing DeviantArt?
3898380	3899380	You know what?
3899380	3900380	I'm not going to do DeviantArt.
3900380	3905500	I'm going to do darksakura.com, the site I haven't updated in five years.
3905500	3909860	You know, I'm thinking maybe when we would do the transitions, we should give you a new
3909860	3912580	thing instead of the website of the week because you're running out of sites.
3912580	3916260	I am, oh my god, because I'm going to the same ones every week now.
3916260	3918100	Well here, I have an idea for you.
3918100	3919100	What?
3919100	3921740	Is that maybe starting episode 250, if you can find just like a couple more sites, take
3921740	3925100	us over 250, we'll have DarkSakura's classic game of the week.
3925100	3926780	I would totally love to do that.
3926780	3928660	Because you know some obscure fucking shit.
3928660	3929660	I do.
3929660	3930660	Alright.
3930660	3934500	I mean, we just had here last week having a conversation about Neutopia.
3934500	3935500	Yeah.
3935500	3939460	So, we're going to have, so coming soon, DarkSakura's website of the week will be replaced with
3939460	3941220	DarkSakura's classic game of the week.
3941220	3942220	That'll be fun.
3942220	3943220	It'll be obscureshit.com.
3943220	3945420	I wonder if that's a site.
3945420	3949260	RossDielUT says, Loki only hates Halo 3 because it's popular.
3949260	3951620	No, I don't hate Halo 3 because it's popular.
3951620	3955660	I hate it because all my customers are complaining, when am I going to get Halo 3, and you really
3955660	3959360	need it on a street date because it's going to, you know, really, it's going to suck if
3959360	3960360	we don't have it.
3960360	3961360	When's it coming in?
3961360	3962580	When's it coming in?
3962580	3967460	I hate, I hated when even the Wii came out because it was a pain in the ass and we knew
3967460	3970180	we couldn't get them on time and all that stuff.
3970180	3974140	Halo 3, everybody wants this damn thing and they're all coming out of the woodwork and
3974140	3978740	all complaining that they're, they need it like five days early and stuff and you're
3978740	3983140	like, yeah, you're not going to be selling it early or anything.
3983140	3986980	I just, I hate games that are going to be just that popular.
3986980	3990700	Grand Theft Auto 4, when it comes out, I'm going to hate that too.
3990700	3994700	Except I love Grand Theft Auto 4, but I am still going to hate the whole selling of Grand
3994700	3996740	Theft Auto 4.
3996740	4000100	Dark Tetsuya in our chat room thinks that for the next couple weeks, well before we
4000100	4005580	transition in episode 250 to, you know, changing some things up, thinks that your website of
4005580	4011060	the week should be like Google.com or Yahoo.com.
4011060	4019460	Actually if you type in Goggle.com because I typoed it once, it takes you to porn.
4019460	4024300	I used to use Hotbot as my search engine back in the day and you could, you know, totally
4024300	4026140	typo that to Hotbot.
4026140	4028520	There's a website, speaking of Google, I read about.
4028520	4029520	Here we go again, tangents.
4029520	4031820	Somebody said in chat I was the king of tangents.
4031820	4032820	Here we go.
4032820	4036860	I was listening to the real radio of all things, driving to work one morning and I heard somebody
4036860	4039380	talking about Blackle.
4039380	4044740	It's a black version of Google where it's just, it's black instead of white.
4044740	4046060	There's a goth one too.
4046060	4051860	But the, well the reason behind it is because they say that if more people used websites
4051860	4056760	that had black backgrounds, then that will actually save on energy.
4056760	4059940	So it's this whole like, you know, hippie thing, you know.
4059940	4061900	Stupid tree huggers need to go away.
4061900	4067020	Leave the internet alone and go hug a tree.
4067020	4069620	Okay.
4069620	4074760	Escapist says Halo 3 will end with Bob Newhart waking up in bed discovering the whole war
4074760	4075760	was a dream.
4075760	4078700	And JVMon's jumping up and down saying you win the internet.
4078700	4081020	That was a pretty great ending to our show.
4081020	4083940	I have a, okay I actually have a website.
4083940	4096020	And I have to blame, I have to blame, hold on a second let me get, I have to blame JVMon
4096020	4098060	for this one because it's awful.
4098060	4100300	It made my heart cry.
4100300	4105140	This is my website of the week not to go to ever, ever.
4105140	4108420	It's insulting and horrible and you don't want to go there ever.
4108420	4109420	This is fun.
4109420	4110420	The anti website of the week.
4110420	4121260	It's captain-jack.de slash 2008 slash cj.html, a new Captain Jack and it makes my heart
4121260	4122260	hurt.
4122260	4123260	Oh, I want to see a new Captain Jack.
4123260	4126380	And his, his girl that's with him is vacant.
4126380	4128420	Hey, I like the new Captain Jack.
4128420	4129420	I can deal with this.
4129420	4133420	Wait, like, oh, I thought, wait, hold on, I thought this was another Doctor Who thing.
4133420	4134540	No, this sucks.
4134540	4139380	Like the Captain Jack, the go, let go, let go, let go, that Captain Jack, they replaced
4139380	4140380	him?
4140380	4141380	No way.
4141380	4142380	I know.
4142380	4143380	Unless it's, unless that's his son.
4143380	4145380	If it's his son, I forgive them.
4145380	4146380	Give me a, no it's not.
4146380	4147980	If it's not, I don't forgive them.
4147980	4148980	How dare they?
4148980	4149980	No, check this out.
4149980	4150980	This is awful.
4150980	4153540	Let me turn up my volume.
4153540	4155620	Can you, wait, can you give me the website one more time because I'll play it on here
4155620	4156620	so the listeners can hear.
4156620	4168060	It's captain-jack.de slash 2008 slash cj.html.
4168060	4174180	Captain-jack.de slash 2008, this is great radio, slash cj.html.
4174180	4175180	Yes.
4175180	4177180	Okay, I think I got it.
4177180	4178180	Hurts my heart.
4178180	4179180	All right, here we go.
4179180	4180180	The site is loading.
4180180	4187460	All right, we welcome, we proudly present the one and only Captain Jack, screw you.
4187460	4189260	There will only be one Captain Jack.
4189260	4194060	Oh, Lord, this sounds horrible already.
4194060	4213500	This is bad, I've got to stop it, besides we don't want to play one.
4213500	4215380	Captain Jack, you are not.
4215380	4216380	Wow.
4216380	4222300	Oh, JV Mon says his son came out as Captain Jack Jr.
4222300	4224540	Interesting.
4224540	4226620	Is that like James Bond Jr.?
4226620	4227620	Interesting.
4227620	4228620	All right.
4228620	4231880	I like how his glasses on the website, you can totally see the film crew.
4231880	4232880	Way to go, people.
4232880	4237300	All right, and I'd like to cordially thank JV Mon for ruining tonight's program.
4237300	4238300	Thank you, JV Mon.
4238300	4239980	Let's get back to some gaming news.
4239980	4242380	Please try to save what little dignity we have left on the show.
4242380	4244900	What dignity do we have?
4244900	4251780	Anywho, so as I mentioned a little bit earlier, that there is going to be some pretty cool
4251780	4259100	stuff coming out for Xbox Live Arcade, including which is Omega 5, a shooter that's going to
4259100	4260100	be coming out.
4260100	4262900	It should be pretty sweet, actually.
4262900	4268940	It's more of like a traditional, crazy, tons of bullets, all over the place shooter game,
4268940	4274720	so hopefully it'll be as cool as I think it is.
4274720	4276460	Hopefully it's cool as you make it out to be.
4276460	4281340	Well, unfortunately, the link that I had on here was the wrong story, so that's based
4281340	4282340	off memory.
4282340	4283340	My bad.
4283340	4286380	Oh, we linked the wrong story in the show, though.
4286380	4287380	My bad.
4287380	4289980	No, but anyways, it is going to be pretty cool.
4289980	4293420	I think it's Mizuguchi anyways, if I remember correctly.
4293420	4297060	Well, then I'll read the story that Loki got linked to instead.
4297060	4302300	It's about Sega, as shown what they're going to be showing off at Tokyo Game Show next
4302300	4303300	week.
4303300	4307220	They got a whole lot of stuff they're showing off on the PlayStation 3, titles such as Sega
4307220	4311460	Rally, Valkyrie of the Battlefield, and a game based off the Golden Compass, which I
4311460	4313820	imagine is based on the movie.
4313820	4318780	Wii is showing off Night's Journey into Dreams, Ghost Squad, another version of the Golden
4318780	4319780	Compass.
4319780	4324980	Sega Rally on the Xbox 360, that's it, but remember this is a Tokyo Game Show, and unfortunately
4324980	4327340	the Xbox 360 is not doing as well over there.
4327340	4332500	I think that's all they had over on the 360 from Sega, other than Golden Compass, I'd
4332500	4333500	imagine.
4333500	4336340	They are showing an expansion for Phantasy Star Universe on the PlayStation 2, though,
4336340	4339420	which makes me wonder, it must not be coming out on the 360, but did the game come out
4339420	4340420	on the Xbox?
4340420	4344060	It is coming out over here, but I think the expansion will probably be a download, just
4344060	4345060	like, you know.
4345060	4346260	Oh, maybe that's what it is.
4346260	4349620	Okay, well they are showing Phantasy Star Universe Ambition of the Illuminous on PlayStation
4349620	4351020	2, at least.
4351020	4355820	I'm sure our resident PSU guy, Dark Knight, knows more about this.
4355820	4359660	Nintendo DS is getting some other games, though, lots of stuff showing on the DS.
4359660	4365900	Sonic Rush Adventure, Bleach the Third Phantom, Picto Image DS, another version of the Golden
4365900	4369740	Compass, which, by the way, will also be on PSP, and a game that I like, this is called
4369740	4377900	Dream Cat Smile DS, rad, that PSU expansion pack also coming to the PC, rad.
4377900	4380720	And Escapists in Chat says, no new Jet Set Radio yet?
4380720	4381720	My heart is breaking.
4381720	4382720	I agree.
4382720	4383720	I agree.
4383720	4384720	C-Man 2.
4384720	4385720	C-Man 2?
4385720	4386720	Yeah.
4386720	4389860	I don't know so much about that.
4389860	4390860	You know what?
4390860	4394100	I wouldn't mind having a C-Man 2, because I thought it was great that the whole thing
4394100	4398660	was narrated by Leonard Nimoy.
4398660	4403060	So let me, if I can get this right, here, Dark Sakura, you're saying you want C-Man
4403060	4404060	2.
4404060	4410780	I got a ferret thrown at me, thank god the webcam's off.
4410780	4412460	Yeah, this is horrible radio.
4412460	4413460	Ferret!
4413460	4414460	No.
4414460	4415460	When you read the story, I'll get back the ferret.
4415460	4418260	EA could be it.
4418260	4419260	Okay.
4419260	4425460	Anyway, EA is finally entering the world of survival horror by giving us a game called
4425460	4427420	Dead Space.
4427420	4430820	You get zombies hidden in fun places.
4430820	4434540	We won't say where they are, but they are somewhere.
4434540	4438860	And it's like, supposed to be like some, I guess, zombie game set in outer space, from
4438860	4439860	what I understand.
4439860	4441900	It's like Event Horizon, I think they said.
4441900	4445620	Oh, and you have tentacles in it, so that's okay.
4445620	4447020	Yay, tentacles!
4447020	4448660	Kids love tentacles!
4448660	4450480	Tentacle porn?
4450480	4451480	Had to be said, kids.
4451480	4456100	Hey, well, I was at Fry's last night and there was a copy of the live-action Love Blue Girls
4456100	4457260	just sitting out.
4457260	4459340	That is the worst movie I've ever seen.
4459340	4460340	It is!
4460340	4461340	That's the most awful, funny thing ever.
4461340	4464380	Vacuum cleaner tubes do not make tentacles.
4464380	4469020	I need to put that on top of my Netflix queue.
4469020	4471740	Just download it like everybody else.
4471740	4475020	Then I'm done.
4475020	4479740	Alright, well, that's going to do it for this Part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but we'll be
