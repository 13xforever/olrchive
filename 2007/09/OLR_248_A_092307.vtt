00:00.000 --> 00:20.720
Tonight, September 23rd, 2007, a highly anticipated Wii game is going online, Sony goes back to

00:20.720 --> 00:31.680
good vibrations, and have we finally figured out what the game Africa is all about?

00:31.680 --> 00:35.440
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:35.440 --> 00:41.040
Radio. We are that video game program dedicated to video games, gaming, gamer culture, the

00:41.040 --> 00:46.480
gamer lifestyle, and boobs, right Dark Sakura? Yes, I have some. Alright, congratulations.

00:46.480 --> 00:50.600
Thank you, I'll tell my mom. Alright, yes please tell her about the show you do on the

00:50.600 --> 00:53.880
internet where we talked about your boobs tonight. I'm sure she'll really appreciate

00:53.880 --> 00:59.400
that. You've called her. I know, that was an old OLR stunt, that was old news. That

00:59.400 --> 01:03.920
was yesterday's news. Let's not call my mom today, okay? Alright, probably not. Also joining

01:03.920 --> 01:09.360
us, the man with no boobs, and that's a good thing, Loki. Hello. How you doing, Loki? Fine.

01:09.360 --> 01:13.240
Awesome. And it's just the three of us here in studio tonight, just feeling the love between

01:13.240 --> 01:17.360
the three of us since there's no guests to speak of tonight. Miklotov sadly moved back

01:17.360 --> 01:20.560
to Kansas so he's not going to be on the show for a long time. He might be back in December

01:20.560 --> 01:25.040
for a little bit but we won't have him on for a while. Trying to get our friend Casper

01:25.040 --> 01:28.960
the Gay back on a future episode but, you know, we have to be careful because you have

01:28.960 --> 01:33.480
too much of him on the show at once. The show might just combust. So, sometimes it's good

01:33.480 --> 01:39.160
to just have the three of us and you guys in the chat room over at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:39.160 --> 01:42.840
Folks in the chat room there. I see some new faces in chat tonight. Welcome everybody in

01:42.840 --> 01:46.280
the chat room. Really appreciate you guys tuning in live here on this Sunday night.

01:46.280 --> 01:49.960
Alright, let's start off the show. Enough chit chat. How was your gaming week? Dark

01:49.960 --> 01:55.280
Sakura, how was your gaming week? Um, I started playing a game again. One that I played for

01:55.280 --> 01:59.200
a very, very, very, very, very long time. Ooh, did you get into Final Fantasy XI again

01:59.200 --> 02:06.080
too? Fuck no. I'm playing Ragnarok Online again. Heal please. Oh, what are you playing?

02:06.080 --> 02:09.040
Because you were a white mage in Final Fantasy XI. So, what are you playing as in Ragnarok

02:09.040 --> 02:15.080
now? Well, I started off with a ninja and they kind of suck. So, I went back to my old

02:15.080 --> 02:26.920
standby of Assassin and, um, right now I am at level 79-47 I think. Uh huh. 79 base, 47

02:26.920 --> 02:32.380
job. Sheesh. Assassin. Well, it's a 50-50-50 server. I haven't played Ragnarok in a long

02:32.380 --> 02:36.640
time so I kind of forget what that means, but it just sounds like borderline addict.

02:36.640 --> 02:42.140
Well, um, the whole thing about it is that it's very, um, it's pretty quick leveling

02:42.140 --> 02:47.760
the way that they've got the ratio set up with lots and lots of loot. Wait a minute.

02:47.760 --> 02:51.480
You said you're playing on a server that's 50-50-50? Yeah. Gravity's going to come in

02:51.480 --> 02:56.920
and say, we ban you! Fuck Gravity. They can't. They're playing on a 50-50 server. They can't

02:56.920 --> 03:01.040
do anything. And besides that, I can go back to IRO anytime I want to because I was in

03:01.040 --> 03:06.080
the beta and they don't delete the beta characters. Oh, that's good. So, my characters are still

03:06.080 --> 03:15.040
sitting there. And to tell DJ Dark Knight, the Ninja class I haven't quite figured out

03:15.040 --> 03:21.520
just because I haven't found any good FAQs in English. And Dark Knight's comment for

03:21.520 --> 03:27.040
the record was, Ninjas don't suck, Jamie. It's 50-50-50, by the way. And what does 50-50-50

03:27.040 --> 03:33.520
mean? Meaning that it's a higher ratio for leveling. You get more experience, more loot.

03:33.520 --> 03:40.480
It's more, okay, it's more experience for base level, for job level, and for your loot.

03:40.480 --> 03:46.640
It's drop rate. So, um, it means you get a whole bunch of crap. And like, I was already

03:46.640 --> 03:54.440
over 400,000 zenny for money, like, in two days. So, and the thing is that I just don't

03:54.440 --> 03:58.660
like play and play and play and play. I play and then sit and do other stuff while I'm

03:58.660 --> 04:02.480
talking to people and then go, oh, I'm still logged into Ragnarok and play some more. And

04:02.480 --> 04:07.320
then go, okay, I'm bored, sit, and then go do other stuff. So, because it's windowed

04:07.320 --> 04:12.080
and really easy, I can just leave it running. And the server's really nice. I'm playing

04:12.080 --> 04:18.520
on Deliverance Online, if anyone. Windowed MMOs for the win. Windows, yes. I am going

04:18.520 --> 04:23.120
to be quitting World of Warcraft until such a day that I have a PC that works that will

04:23.120 --> 04:29.840
run it. I'm going to be playing Guild Wars instead, because thanks to Plan C, I only

04:29.840 --> 04:36.240
took them like, I'd have to say four business days, I think, that they got me my, um, my

04:36.240 --> 04:41.160
key restored. So nice. And they, they email it right to you. Everything's cool. So I'm

04:41.160 --> 04:47.160
gonna go, uh, it's really cool. Instead of just being all like, oh, fuck you, your key's

04:47.160 --> 04:52.520
broken. You lose. They will actually, if you, if you send them a high quality enough image,

04:52.520 --> 04:59.080
they will, um, decipher what your key is. Wow. And, um, give, give you whatever your

04:59.080 --> 05:03.120
key was. They'll base it off of the one that you were given. Dang. So their customer service

05:03.120 --> 05:06.240
is really good then, huh? Oh yeah. I wouldn't think that they, I would think most companies

05:06.240 --> 05:12.600
would tell you too bad, so sad. They're really on the ball. Wow. Really on the ball. And

05:12.600 --> 05:19.720
I also, um, we got stuff. Dan came back from the Game Crazy Manager Conference. So I'm

05:19.720 --> 05:24.600
getting a free Halo 3. I'm getting a free Heavenly Sword, which I want to play. I'm

05:24.600 --> 05:27.760
looking forward to it. We got a copy of Jean Dark already, which I'm going to be playing

05:27.760 --> 05:33.760
through. Um, he got some other games. We're supposed to be getting Mass Effect. He said

05:33.760 --> 05:38.760
that it looked really, really, really sweet. Yeah, I'm, I'm looking forward to that too.

05:38.760 --> 05:44.240
And then, um, he got to play, uh, uh, Dracula X Collection and he thought it was really

05:44.240 --> 05:48.440
cool. Um, I actually watched a bunch of videos from Tokyo Game Show. Um, not from Tokyo Game

05:48.440 --> 05:53.040
Show, but, um, well, from Tokyo Game Show, I watched the, the Knights demo, but I was

05:53.040 --> 05:59.000
watching the, um, the footage from, uh, uh, Rondo of Blood and it looked really, really,

05:59.000 --> 06:03.400
really good. I think I'm going to be very impressed with it. And, um, we got a whole

06:03.400 --> 06:09.120
bunch of t-shirts that we don't want and we're getting a, uh, Wii Zapper and we already,

06:09.120 --> 06:13.520
he came home with a Wii Sword. So rub it in with all this free shit you're getting. I'm,

06:13.520 --> 06:18.920
uh, looking in chat, some folks, uh, dissing Heavenly Sword in chat. Fildos. I don't care.

06:18.920 --> 06:22.640
I'm playing it anyway. I like that name, by the way. Fildos says, I beat Heavenly Sword

06:22.640 --> 06:27.440
in five minutes and Mikosense says Heavenly Sword in all that great. I don't care. It's

06:27.440 --> 06:32.060
free and I'm playing it. It does look pretty. Pretty things are good. Like I said, it's

06:32.060 --> 06:36.240
free and I'm playing it. There you go. All right. Uh, let's go over to Loki. Loki, how

06:36.240 --> 06:41.920
was your gaming week? Uh, my week was a little busy. Um, let's see. Of course at work I've

06:41.920 --> 06:45.880
been playing more Saints Row multiplayer. Now we're doing all Rocket matches, which

06:45.880 --> 06:52.320
are pretty fun. Um, then of course, you know, the big one, um, I got Halo 3 early and you're

06:52.320 --> 06:58.680
breaking stuff. Sorry. Um, so I actually have already finished the game. Um, it's kind of

06:58.680 --> 07:05.480
short. Reminds me, see now I never really played, I mean I played Halo once or twice

07:05.480 --> 07:10.680
and I've played Halo 2 maybe once or twice, but never through the entire story mode. So

07:10.680 --> 07:16.620
I think most of the story and the ending stuff is pretty lost to me as far as, uh, the impact

07:16.620 --> 07:23.360
I guess. But, um, I don't know. It was good. It reminds me a lot of Resistance. I mean

07:23.360 --> 07:30.360
there's a lot of parallels between this game and that one. So, I don't know. How so? Well,

07:30.360 --> 07:34.640
I don't want to give away too much. I mean, I don't know, I mean if anyone's actually

07:34.640 --> 07:38.720
heard anything about the game, you know, there's a race called the Flood and they remind me

07:38.720 --> 07:46.360
a lot of the race of creatures that you fight in Resistance. Um, I don't know. The game

07:46.360 --> 07:51.680
itself is pretty good. I liked it. Um, the multiplayer is pretty fun. I can't wait to

07:51.680 --> 07:57.680
play more of that. And then co-op I really want to give a try to some of that. Overall

07:57.680 --> 08:03.120
it's pretty good. Definitely not the best game this year. Definitely not the best looking

08:03.120 --> 08:08.400
game this year, but I don't think you really need to have the best graphics to make great

08:08.400 --> 08:12.800
games. So, it should be good. And I know that Bungie supports their games pretty well, so

08:12.800 --> 08:18.720
I can't wait to see what they do with the rest of it. Um, then the last game, well actually

08:18.720 --> 08:23.880
there's a few others. I played Brain Age 2. I bought that for Nelly and I don't like that

08:23.880 --> 08:30.320
game. I don't like that game because, why? The text recognition and the voice recognition

08:30.320 --> 08:34.560
are horrible. They're absolutely horrible. Like there's a part where you're having to

08:34.560 --> 08:38.040
yell out, you know, rock, paper, scissor and you're playing that and you either have to

08:38.040 --> 08:46.400
win or lose. And it did not understand scissor. I had to like go, scissor, scissor, scissor.

08:46.400 --> 08:50.920
And it finally is like, oh, okay you got it. Or it'll just say you got it wrong. And then

08:50.920 --> 08:56.400
there's another one, it was addition, where you had to like insert the, um, the operative

08:56.400 --> 09:00.600
for a math problem. So, you know, I'd draw a plus or something and it would think it's

09:00.600 --> 09:04.520
a multiplication, like an X or something. I'm like, that does not look like an X at

09:04.520 --> 09:09.520
all. Or there's another one that wanted me to spell out stuff, um, to like create a word

09:09.520 --> 09:14.520
and I was trying to draw a B. And I mean, it looks like a B and it thinks I'm drawing

09:14.520 --> 09:19.640
like a D or like something else. It can't recognize my handwriting. You know, so it

09:19.640 --> 09:24.860
gives me a really crappy, you know, time on it because it's stupid. So, I don't know.

09:24.860 --> 09:30.440
It's really frustrating. Luckily, I didn't buy it for me, so that's all good. Um, then

09:30.440 --> 09:36.760
the last game I played was Rock Band. I actually went out to, um, Sacramento today to check

09:36.760 --> 09:39.080
out the Rock Band. They're doing that mobile tour thing.

09:39.080 --> 09:45.740
I knew I forgot to do something this weekend. And, um, so it was interesting. Um, there's

09:45.740 --> 09:51.200
actually hardly anyone there. I mean, they had enough stations for about, I would say

09:51.200 --> 09:55.440
twenty people to play at once. They had like five different setups, so it was pretty easy

09:55.440 --> 10:01.200
to get in there. Um, the problem I had, and hopefully this is not reflecting the final

10:01.200 --> 10:06.560
product is, that guitar, man, there was some issues with that strum bar. It just was not

10:06.560 --> 10:12.880
working at all. I mean, I failed two songs on easy. And I mean, I'm not great. You know,

10:12.880 --> 10:18.000
I can do the three keys fine, but this thing was not hitting right at all. And they were

10:18.000 --> 10:22.480
like, well, I don't know if it's the humidity or what. And it wasn't very humid out. But

10:22.480 --> 10:26.080
I'm like, there's like barely any humidity in California, people.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.920
The humidity or whatever, but pushing down the strum bar doesn't work. You gotta pull

10:28.920 --> 10:35.920
up sometimes, because the down will stop working. I'm like, okay. So, you know, pulling up worked

10:35.920 --> 10:40.800
fine, and we ended up playing Tom Sawyer, and that was okay. Um, the game itself looks

10:40.800 --> 10:46.360
exactly like Guitar Hero. I mean, if you've seen Guitar Hero and you've seen Kariok Hero

10:46.360 --> 10:51.120
Evolution, it's just those two games combined. It's not a big surprise. The drums look kind

10:51.120 --> 10:56.360
of neat. The way they had them set up, though, they were very low to the ground. But it worked

10:56.360 --> 10:59.480
for whoever was playing drums. I ended up playing the bass guitar, because that was

10:59.480 --> 11:05.720
all that was left. And I do like the buttons on it. They have buttons towards the top and

11:05.720 --> 11:10.040
of course towards the bottom for like, I guess, solo stuff. I never really figured out, because

11:10.040 --> 11:14.740
you can use the bottom buttons the entire game. And I guess you use them also when you're

11:14.740 --> 11:21.740
doing the finale part. Other than that, there's a little effector thing there. You can switch

11:21.960 --> 11:26.680
between like five different effects, including like chorus, echo, and they have like some

11:26.680 --> 11:33.680
wah-wah and other stuff that you can do. So, it was okay. But, I don't know. The guitar

11:35.920 --> 11:40.320
thing, also they were a little bit thinner, and probably about as light as a normal Guitar

11:40.320 --> 11:45.080
Hero guitar. So, the guitars look good. I don't know. I mean, I'm sure that the guitar

11:45.080 --> 11:50.940
has been through all sorts of abuse if it's on this tour. So, I'm attributing to that,

11:50.940 --> 11:54.560
but I hope that there isn't an issue with the guitars when it comes out, because that

11:54.560 --> 12:00.320
game is quite expensive. So, we'll have to see. But otherwise, it was fun. Definitely

12:00.320 --> 12:05.480
fun. I like the whole team kind of aspect to it, because my guitar was giving me shit.

12:05.480 --> 12:11.440
And so, I failed the first song, and my other teammates kind of got me back into the game.

12:11.440 --> 12:15.520
And the same thing happened in reverse the last time. The drummer failed, and I got him

12:15.520 --> 12:20.920
back in there with the bass guitar. So, that's kind of cool. I don't know. It was a good

12:20.920 --> 12:27.360
game though. But, if you expect anything really different from Guitar Hero, you're going to

12:27.360 --> 12:33.360
be disappointed. But, it'll look good. All right. So, do you think that Rock Band

12:33.360 --> 12:38.840
got lots of awards at E3 2007? Do you think that it's worthy of all the praise it's been

12:38.840 --> 12:42.200
getting? I think so. I think, well, Guitar Hero 3, I don't really think they're doing

12:42.200 --> 12:44.800
too much different, other than the fact that they're going to be catering to more of a

12:44.800 --> 12:51.120
hardcore crowd. It's kind of like the In The Groove. If In The Groove were created by Konami,

12:51.120 --> 12:56.600
this would be kind of like that. Where it's a game catered towards people that really

12:56.600 --> 13:02.640
want insane charts to play. Whereas, Rock Band's going to be a little bit different,

13:02.640 --> 13:07.600
because they're going to try to appeal to everybody. The place that they had it showing

13:07.600 --> 13:14.120
today was this Rhythm and Ribs Festival. It was a bunch of middle-aged people listening

13:14.120 --> 13:22.400
to blues music and stuff, eating ribs. I just happened to go just to play this game. But,

13:22.400 --> 13:27.600
I think it'll be good. The problem is, they're going to have a tough time selling it for

13:27.600 --> 13:33.160
200 bucks. From what I hear, and I don't know if this is going to be exactly the case, they're

13:33.160 --> 13:38.720
only going to be selling the game by itself, and also that special edition, which is going

13:38.720 --> 13:42.520
to have the guitar, drums, and microphone. Those are the only two ways that they're going

13:42.520 --> 13:48.440
to have them. But, I guess in 2008, in January, they're going to start selling the drums and

13:48.440 --> 13:56.840
the guitars separately. So, I don't know. Alright. Well, my gaming week, I also got

13:56.840 --> 14:01.360
to play Halo 3 for about 15 minutes, because Loki brought it over here, and I wanted to

14:01.360 --> 14:05.120
see it. So, I got part of the way through the jungle.

14:05.120 --> 14:11.040
One last thing I forgot to mention. Since I did get the collector's edition, there's

14:11.040 --> 14:17.960
another game that's actually on the disc, on the add-on disc. It's almost like a flash

14:17.960 --> 14:25.680
game where you have to put grenades underneath a warthog to fling it into the air to destroy

14:25.680 --> 14:27.720
aliens. Let me show the game to the OP11 people again

14:27.720 --> 14:31.280
so you can see the box, because this is different than the box art I've been seeing online,

14:31.280 --> 14:35.520
because most of the reviewers got the regular copy of Halo 3, but you somehow managed one

14:35.520 --> 14:39.760
of these little special edition things, so it's pretty neat there.

14:39.760 --> 14:43.400
So again, if you want to look at webcam feed of our show archived, it's operate11.com.

14:43.400 --> 14:47.640
Sometimes we hold up random things in front of the camera just to show what's going on.

14:47.640 --> 14:53.660
So I played Halo 3, which was pretty cool. Again, I certainly haven't played enough to

14:53.660 --> 14:57.720
give an opinion of it. It certainly looked nice, I'll say that.

14:57.720 --> 15:01.840
And I like the customization. I love the customization in games like that.

15:01.840 --> 15:06.360
And all I have to say is I was able to make my emblem a unicorn, and it was awesome, because

15:06.360 --> 15:10.040
unicorns are rad. So there you go.

15:10.040 --> 15:15.160
More on Halo 3 next week. I have been spending my entire freaking week

15:15.160 --> 15:18.800
playing Eternal Sonata. I ran out and bought this game the day it came out, because I really

15:18.800 --> 15:21.880
enjoyed the demo, and I have been loving the game.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.960
And I've been reading some of the reviews online of the game, and I honestly think most

15:25.960 --> 15:27.680
of the critics have been pretty harsh on this game.

15:27.680 --> 15:31.880
I think critics across the board just don't really care for Japanese role-playing games,

15:31.880 --> 15:36.760
especially 360 reviewers. Because on the 360, you don't get a lot of

15:36.760 --> 15:42.900
games like this, but this is kind of a throwback to some really rad PlayStation 2 games I can

15:42.900 --> 15:45.880
think of in the past. So I don't know, I would say if you're a fan

15:45.880 --> 15:48.840
of these types of Japanese role-playing games, don't listen to the reviews.

15:48.840 --> 15:52.880
Is the game perfect? No. Some of my issues with the game is that the

15:52.880 --> 15:56.160
game tends to repeat the monsters over and over again.

15:56.160 --> 16:00.120
Like you go into a dungeon, and there's basically only two types of monsters you can fight.

16:00.120 --> 16:04.240
There's scorpions, there's other things, flying bugs or something, I don't know.

16:04.240 --> 16:10.920
So the monsters get a little stale, and the game does feel a little bit easy on the easy

16:10.920 --> 16:12.920
side. But that's probably just the way that I play

16:12.920 --> 16:17.940
RPGs usually, is I grind hella much in the beginning so that I'm one step ahead on the

16:17.940 --> 16:20.080
EXP. But otherwise, I think the game is awesome.

16:20.080 --> 16:24.160
I love the battle system in the game, because with the battle system, basically the play

16:24.160 --> 16:29.640
field is live. You run around the field, you have five seconds,

16:29.640 --> 16:33.920
depending on what level your party's at, you have five seconds, then like four seconds,

16:33.920 --> 16:37.640
you have a certain amount of time to run around the battlefield to where the monster is, and

16:37.640 --> 16:41.880
then attack or what have you. So it's like a tactical mixed with a Final

16:41.880 --> 16:44.240
Fantasy type battle system. It's really cool.

16:44.240 --> 16:47.360
And then there's light spots and dark spots, and the special attacks you do in the light

16:47.360 --> 16:52.280
spots are one thing, and the dark spots are completely a different thing.

16:52.280 --> 16:57.100
And of course, every character has their own stuff, and later on, as you advance, the one

16:57.100 --> 16:59.720
cool thing is that the battle system builds and builds.

16:59.720 --> 17:03.920
In the beginning, your five seconds only counts down when you're actually doing something.

17:03.920 --> 17:07.540
But then later on, you have four seconds that counts down no matter what.

17:07.540 --> 17:10.720
But you get perks from that. You get this echo meter that you build up.

17:10.720 --> 17:14.800
So the more attacks you do, the more damage your special attacks do.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.560
It's pretty neat, intricate, the way the game works.

17:17.560 --> 17:23.040
And the game is beautiful, very colorful, lots of greens, blues, reds, you know, just

17:23.040 --> 17:28.320
all these different types of areas, snow areas, fire areas, you know, just really shows off

17:28.320 --> 17:33.600
the graphical capabilities of the 360. And I, for one, think the story is pretty

17:33.600 --> 17:36.240
awesome. I mean, it's certainly one of the most original

17:36.240 --> 17:40.100
stories you'll see out there. I mean, it's based around Chopin, and how

17:40.100 --> 17:45.720
in the last days of Chopin's life, he was kind of dreaming up this fantasy world, and

17:45.720 --> 17:48.120
this whole story takes place in a fantasy world.

17:48.120 --> 17:51.820
But it's really deep, and it's really weird. Like, one thing I hadn't heard about until

17:51.820 --> 17:56.580
I really started playing the game was that at random occurrences, the game will actually

17:56.580 --> 18:01.420
cut away to these, like, educational pieces about Chopin's life.

18:01.420 --> 18:02.920
It's so weird. Boo, education!

18:02.920 --> 18:04.820
No, no, no, no. It's not like that.

18:04.820 --> 18:09.760
It tells stories about Chopin's life, and while it's doing that, it shows, like, pictures.

18:09.760 --> 18:14.340
It shows, like, really beautiful high-definition pictures from, you know, Poland and France

18:14.340 --> 18:18.460
and all these places that he lived, and it tells you these things about Chopin's life.

18:18.460 --> 18:22.800
But the pieces, and they're playing the scores on piano.

18:22.800 --> 18:28.440
And by the way, for you DDR fans, the song Kakumei from DDR Max 2, you remember that

18:28.440 --> 18:32.680
song? That's based on a Chopin piece, Revolution,

18:32.680 --> 18:35.740
and Revolution is the whole second stage in the game.

18:35.740 --> 18:40.220
So you actually hear the original piano piece, and it's showing you all these pictures, kind

18:40.220 --> 18:42.760
of telling you about Chopin's life, and what it is is kind of mirroring what's going on

18:42.760 --> 18:46.980
in the game. And it's just really interesting.

18:46.980 --> 18:52.660
Some really long monologues and stuff. It's a good story. Certainly worth checking

18:52.660 --> 18:56.580
out. Some of the voice acting is actually really

18:56.580 --> 18:58.780
good. Some of it is a little bit irritating, like,

18:58.780 --> 19:05.060
I don't care for the little child beat or polka, but some of the other voice acting

19:05.060 --> 19:07.860
is really, really good in the game. So I definitely recommend it.

19:07.860 --> 19:14.300
If you own a 360 and you are into role-playing games of the Japanese style at all, you totally

19:14.300 --> 19:17.200
should check this one out. I think it's better than a lot of critics

19:17.200 --> 19:19.900
are making it out to be. Not that critics are giving it bad scores,

19:19.900 --> 19:23.980
but like 7s and 8s, but I would definitely say this game is at least an 8.5, if not a

19:23.980 --> 19:27.140
9. It probably will be one of my favorite games

19:27.140 --> 19:29.860
of the year. Going to chat room, looking at some comments

19:29.860 --> 19:32.460
there. Chat.orangelandradio.com if you guys want

19:32.460 --> 19:36.820
to participate. Ghost says, anyway, Eternal Sonata looks beautiful.

19:36.820 --> 19:43.140
GS68 says, fuck corporate reviewers. WTF, I can only move in two dimensions.

19:43.140 --> 19:47.380
There's no save points, I keep dying, and the game can be beaten in under one hour?

19:47.380 --> 19:52.420
Negative 264 out of 10. You know, I think the thing about reviews

19:52.420 --> 19:56.540
is that everybody's different. Everybody's different and likes different

19:56.540 --> 19:59.700
stuff, including the reviewers out there like different stuff.

19:59.700 --> 20:03.700
So, you just have to kind of find that reviewer that matches your taste, and maybe that's

20:03.700 --> 20:06.860
me here on this show, or maybe it is somebody that writes for one of the corporate sites.

20:06.860 --> 20:10.300
And I also think people are influenced by hype and stuff, like for example, if I wanted

20:10.300 --> 20:16.020
to rate Halo like a 7 or 8 or something like that, people would be jumping all over me.

20:16.020 --> 20:19.220
They'd be like, what the hell, this is the game of the year, blah blah blah blah blah.

20:19.220 --> 20:21.980
I mean, hype does go a long way, that's for sure.

20:21.980 --> 20:26.100
And also, did you notice that those commercials for Halo 3 that they have right now, like

20:26.100 --> 20:29.840
the final set of commercials and teasers and stuff, completely suck.

20:29.840 --> 20:34.860
It's like that they have a marketing person from Sony come over and create commercials

20:34.860 --> 20:38.420
for them, like with that stupid digital museum shit.

20:38.420 --> 20:42.860
It just shows fucking gameplay. That's all you got to show.

20:42.860 --> 20:46.860
You don't need to show some fucking old guy talking about a plasma rifle or some shit

20:46.860 --> 20:50.900
like that. No one knows nor cares what it's for.

20:50.900 --> 20:52.460
I don't know, it's stupid.

20:52.460 --> 20:56.640
By the way, the story in Eternal Sonata is kind of a real downer.

20:56.640 --> 21:01.260
Like, you don't really see these types of stories in games, but I'm not going to real

21:01.260 --> 21:04.860
spoil anything, because the very first thing you see is one of the characters jumping off

21:04.860 --> 21:09.740
a cliff, apparently committing suicide, talking about letting herself go or whatever.

21:09.740 --> 21:13.500
And then of course, you know, Chopin is dying, and he's actually a character in the game.

21:13.500 --> 21:14.580
He's talking about dying.

21:14.580 --> 21:18.140
Meanwhile, there's another character who's 14 years old who realizes that because she

21:18.140 --> 21:20.940
can use magic, she has an incurable illness.

21:20.940 --> 21:25.300
So it's like all these people are dying, and then there was one death scene at the end

21:25.300 --> 21:30.260
of one of the chapters I just beat, and this character died, and she realized all the wrong

21:30.260 --> 21:35.460
that she had done in the world, and gives this five-minute monologue before she dies

21:35.460 --> 21:39.100
and lets this dove go free as her last dying wish.

21:39.100 --> 21:42.660
I mean, it sounds hokey the way I'm describing it, but actually, the way it was done was

21:42.660 --> 21:43.660
really cool.

21:43.660 --> 21:45.980
It's got good news and bad news for you.

21:45.980 --> 21:47.420
Good news, you can do magic.

21:47.420 --> 21:49.040
What's the bad news?

21:49.040 --> 21:50.040
You have brain cancer.

21:50.040 --> 21:54.300
Essentially, that's what it is, but here's the interesting thing is they try to make

21:54.300 --> 22:01.660
parallels between that character and Chopin's sister who died as a teenager of tuberculosis.

22:01.660 --> 22:05.900
See there's all these really interesting parallels in it that I think make the story certainly

22:05.900 --> 22:07.300
really creative.

22:07.300 --> 22:12.860
You know, you may have those cliche RPG moments in it, but it's certainly never seen anything

22:12.860 --> 22:13.860
like this before.

22:13.860 --> 22:20.020
You know, if TB gave you magical powers, maybe people wouldn't be so sad over it, you know?

22:20.020 --> 22:21.820
I mean, you are so wrong.

22:21.820 --> 22:23.620
I don't even know what to tell you.

22:23.620 --> 22:26.140
There are some magicians out there which would get TB.

22:26.140 --> 22:29.140
I'm looking at you, David Copperfield.

22:29.140 --> 22:33.300
Alright, anyhow, that's really all I've been playing.

22:33.300 --> 22:36.200
I checked out that one game that came out on Xbox Live this week.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.200
What is it?

22:37.200 --> 22:38.200
Geos or whatever?

22:38.200 --> 22:39.200
I don't know.

22:39.200 --> 22:40.200
It looks stupid.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.200
Was it Geos, the system on the Commodore 64?

22:41.200 --> 22:42.200
It's like Geon Emotions or something.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.200
Isn't that like an English school in Japan?

22:43.200 --> 22:44.200
I don't know.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.200
Geon Emotions.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.200
Oh, is it Geon?

22:46.200 --> 22:47.200
I don't know.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.200
Maybe I was thinking of the Commodore 64 thing.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.200
It's Geon, I'm not going to buy it.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.900
That's what it's called.

22:50.900 --> 22:51.900
It was okay.

22:51.900 --> 22:55.980
I played it for like 15 minutes and then I was like, I need to go back to Eternal Sonata

22:55.980 --> 22:59.660
because I'm not progressing enough in the story.

22:59.660 --> 23:03.000
I don't know where the hell these reviewers are saying this game is too short.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.740
I've been playing for about 16 hours now and I think I'm maybe at the halfway point.

23:07.740 --> 23:09.120
It may be a little past.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.620
Like 30 hours is short for an RPG.

23:11.620 --> 23:13.900
How long did it take you to beat Halo 3, Loki?

23:13.900 --> 23:18.300
Well, I got the game on Wednesday and I finished it today.

23:18.300 --> 23:19.300
And I didn't play that long.

23:19.300 --> 23:24.080
I mean, maybe, I'd say maybe 10 hours at the most.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.080
There you go.

23:25.080 --> 23:26.080
And let me put it this way.

23:26.080 --> 23:30.020
I mean, I guess, granted, Halo 3 has a shitload of replayability value thanks to the multiplayer

23:30.020 --> 23:31.020
mode.

23:31.020 --> 23:34.080
Well, there's a lot of stuff you can go back and, like, I played it on Normal difficulty,

23:34.080 --> 23:38.080
which I hear is super easy, but, you know, I just wanted to start at Normal.

23:38.080 --> 23:42.300
Had I realized that you can actually go through, like, Legendary or something like that and

23:42.300 --> 23:45.660
then you'll get the achievements for all the other difficulties, I would have saved myself

23:45.660 --> 23:48.540
some time and just played on the hardest difficulty.

23:48.540 --> 23:55.380
But I was going to say, if one bit of advice, so whenever you get into a sequence where

23:55.380 --> 23:59.760
someone's piloting a vehicle, I highly recommend you kick them out of the driver's seat and

23:59.760 --> 24:04.920
you pilot the vehicle because the AI sucks at piloting vehicles.

24:04.920 --> 24:06.860
Completely awful.

24:06.860 --> 24:08.580
Especially if a woman's driving the car, correct?

24:08.580 --> 24:12.780
Oh my God, there was someone driving, there was a woman driving the fucking, like, one

24:12.780 --> 24:17.660
of the mongooses in the game and fucking just said, I'm going to jump this cliff and then,

24:17.660 --> 24:21.100
like, boom, straight down the cliff or, like, slam it into the wall and stuff.

24:21.100 --> 24:23.580
I'm like, okay, woman out, I'll drive this.

24:23.580 --> 24:27.980
I'm just like, you know, I drove by like typical.

24:27.980 --> 24:29.820
That was hilarious.

24:29.820 --> 24:34.380
DarkSakura, will you be playing Halo 3?

24:34.380 --> 24:37.540
If first person shooters didn't make me puke, then maybe.

24:37.540 --> 24:42.660
No, actually, even if first person shooters made me puke, no.

24:42.660 --> 24:44.020
Because you're too busy with Ragnarok.

24:44.020 --> 24:46.540
No, because I'm too busy playing good games.

24:46.540 --> 24:48.340
Oh, snap.

24:48.340 --> 24:53.460
Alright, let's, uh, I guess that's it, that's really all I have to say for my gaming week.

24:53.460 --> 24:58.300
I've talked far too much about those games I've been playing this week, so let's get

24:58.300 --> 25:03.000
into some housekeeping, of which there's not a lot tonight, no really big changes coming

25:03.000 --> 25:08.060
up with the show, except that we do have episode 250 is only two weeks away, although we're

25:08.060 --> 25:10.860
not planning a whole lot of special stuff for that because we already had, like, a fifth

25:10.860 --> 25:15.180
year anniversary show this year, we do just want to point that out, that maybe something

25:15.180 --> 25:19.060
special will happen, something little will happen in a couple weeks, we'll see.

25:19.060 --> 25:24.100
In the meantime, our show is still simulcast on Operator 11, which you can visit operator11.com

25:24.100 --> 25:29.220
and look at the old video of our feeds, or you can always join our communities on Live

25:29.220 --> 25:34.060
Journal and Myspace and Facebook, I forgot to say the Facebook people last week, but

25:34.060 --> 25:38.380
the reason why I neglected to mention Facebook last week is because Facebook has been fucking

25:38.380 --> 25:42.820
bugging me lately, like, oh, I'm going to take a lot of shit for this, I seriously think

25:42.820 --> 25:45.900
Facebook is getting worse than Myspace, and you know why?

25:45.900 --> 25:50.300
It's because of all those little add-ins that they have on the pages now, like, I get all

25:50.300 --> 25:56.460
these invites to play Pirates vs Ninjas, to have a movie list, to have a, it's just turned

25:56.460 --> 26:02.340
into a bunch of crap, I mean, at least on Myspace, if my page sucks, that's my fault,

26:02.340 --> 26:06.620
but I don't know, I don't want to start a social networking war, but I apologize to

26:06.620 --> 26:11.980
the Facebook fans, twice, for my behavior this week.

26:11.980 --> 26:16.860
So that's that, let's get into some gaming news, and we'll talk about that.

26:16.860 --> 26:21.920
Well, this week we had a lot of big announcements, of course, because Tokyo Game Show was going

26:21.920 --> 26:23.700
on.

26:23.700 --> 26:28.160
One interesting thing though, and will probably be a sigh of relief for a lot of people, Super

26:28.160 --> 26:34.480
Smash Bros. Brawl has revealed their online plans, yes, there will be friends codes, at

26:34.480 --> 26:39.980
least it will be online, so that's good, thank god, there will be options to play against

26:39.980 --> 26:46.700
friends or to play against anybody, so, I don't know, kind of, I guess, typical for

26:46.700 --> 26:54.020
your normal Nintendo online game, so yeah, pretty awesome.

26:54.020 --> 26:58.820
And on the dojo this week, they put up all these snake things, like they finally, you

26:58.820 --> 27:03.260
know, I guess, what do you want to say, officially unveiled Snake as a character on the dojo,

27:03.260 --> 27:07.940
although thanks to E3 last year, we already knew it was coming, but they actually officially,

27:07.940 --> 27:10.940
you know, rolled out his profile and everything on the site, and there's a pretty awesome

27:10.940 --> 27:16.100
picture of him, it's kind of a homoerotic pose, with him and Ike coming up behind him

27:16.100 --> 27:19.820
and doing the whole, like, I'm going to snap your neck type thing, or who knows what.

27:19.820 --> 27:24.500
You know, I remember that one game that I had, and I cannot remember the name for the

27:24.500 --> 27:29.340
life of me, that had a bunch of Hudson characters, and like Hasbro characters in it and stuff,

27:29.340 --> 27:31.660
remember Snake was in there.

27:31.660 --> 27:33.660
Wasn't that the one where you could be, like, Optimus Prime?

27:33.660 --> 27:37.620
Yeah, you could do Optimus Prime vs. Barbie, I mean, how awesome is that?

27:37.620 --> 27:39.020
That was on the DS, right?

27:39.020 --> 27:43.260
Yeah, it was like, you could play as Bomberman, or no, it wasn't DS, it was on the Playstation

27:43.260 --> 27:49.060
2, it was, they had Bomberman, Snake, they actually had Simon Belmont, you could play

27:49.060 --> 27:54.060
as Barbie, there was Optimus Prime...

27:54.060 --> 27:57.820
Dark Tetsuya and Rob D are yelling, Dream Mix TV World Fighters!

27:57.820 --> 28:00.200
Yes, that's it, yeah, that's awesome.

28:00.200 --> 28:03.940
So, you know, really, they could have just ripped that out of, or ripped Snake from there,

28:03.940 --> 28:08.140
and just used all of his moves, because from what I've seen on Super Smash Brothers already,

28:08.140 --> 28:12.340
it's kind of similar anyways, so, I don't know.

28:12.340 --> 28:13.340
Interesting.

28:13.340 --> 28:15.020
Optimus Prime vs. Barbie, awesome.

28:15.020 --> 28:18.340
It made me think of a completely different game, even though it's not the same.

28:18.340 --> 28:23.100
The, what was it, Super Konami World, where you could, you played original characters

28:23.100 --> 28:26.900
that went into different Konami games, it was very interesting.

28:26.900 --> 28:27.900
Very cool.

28:27.900 --> 28:32.340
And that's the one, you could be like, Miss Cool Ninja, what is this, going on, you could

28:32.340 --> 28:33.340
be like...

28:33.340 --> 28:34.340
You could go into that world.

28:34.340 --> 28:35.340
Yeah, that's cool.

28:35.340 --> 28:36.340
I think I played that once.

28:36.340 --> 28:39.260
And I think there was like a Yayar Kung Fu level or something.

28:39.260 --> 28:40.260
That's random.

28:40.260 --> 28:45.420
Alright, anyhow, I also wanted to say about this though, what do you think about the whole

28:45.420 --> 28:50.640
fact that when you play online against strangers, you don't get to see their names, you don't

28:50.640 --> 28:55.980
get to have the little chat bubbles, nothing, it's just a straight up, it's almost like

28:55.980 --> 28:59.340
playing against the computer, except the computer is actually being controlled by someone real

28:59.340 --> 29:00.340
you don't know.

29:00.340 --> 29:02.420
It doesn't save stats, it doesn't do anything.

29:02.420 --> 29:06.540
I mean, in my mind, I'm kind of like, well, then why do they even bother?

29:06.540 --> 29:11.660
Because you can't track who you're playing, you can't, if you liked playing with them,

29:11.660 --> 29:14.660
you can't play with them again later, I mean, there's like none of that.

29:14.660 --> 29:18.140
But I suppose this is just more bitching about Nintendo's online mode.

29:18.140 --> 29:21.420
All I gotta say is their online needs a major overhaul.

29:21.420 --> 29:28.100
I mean, I heard rumors that there's supposed to be some major update coming this month,

29:28.100 --> 29:34.180
and with next week being the last week of the month, I don't think that's gonna happen.

29:34.180 --> 29:38.100
You know, I do like what they're doing with the friend stuff, like if you have a friend

29:38.100 --> 29:42.300
added, you know, how you can do, in lieu of voice chat, I mean, since they don't have

29:42.300 --> 29:45.780
that, you can do the little speech bubbles and things, I mean, that's kind of neat,

29:45.780 --> 29:46.780
I guess.

29:46.780 --> 29:51.780
I don't know, part of the reason the DS online thing works is, I don't know how you guys

29:51.780 --> 29:55.900
do it, but the way I play DS online is that I'll be chatting with someone on AOL, and

29:55.900 --> 29:57.380
they'll be like, hey, you wanna play something on DS?

29:57.380 --> 30:00.900
I'm like, okay, and so then I'll play the game, and then as soon as the game overs,

30:00.900 --> 30:04.580
I can go right over and chat with them, like, haha, I kicked your ass, or, boy, you own

30:04.580 --> 30:05.580
me, or whatever.

30:05.580 --> 30:07.360
Yeah, but even- But you can't do that on the Wii now, unless

30:07.360 --> 30:08.360
I have a laptop.

30:08.360 --> 30:14.580
But even the DS has more features in their online games than the Wii has, I mean, shit,

30:14.580 --> 30:18.580
it's like they've got voice chat, they have lobbies and stuff like that, the Wii doesn't

30:18.580 --> 30:19.580
have that.

30:19.580 --> 30:22.900
I mean, come on, there's more technology in the Wii than there is in the DS, why can't

30:22.900 --> 30:25.340
they implement the stuff that's already implemented in other things?

30:25.340 --> 30:30.340
And if the DS can handle voice chat, why can't the fucking Wii handle it?

30:30.340 --> 30:34.820
The Rob D. in our chat says, honestly, Sky, Wii fighter fans get so few bones thrown to

30:34.820 --> 30:38.200
us in terms of online play that I, for one, don't even care.

30:38.200 --> 30:41.780
Online play on a fighter is enough for me right now.

30:41.780 --> 30:46.180
And Rob D. says, when I play on DS, we chat on Skype, too, that'll work.

30:46.180 --> 30:50.340
And I guess, in a way, you have a point, it's better than nothing.

30:50.340 --> 30:54.000
And I think that's a lot of the reaction people are having to this news, at least that's kind

30:54.000 --> 30:57.840
of what I said, I said, okay, at least it's a step in the right direction, and it's better

30:57.840 --> 31:02.260
than not being online at all, like Metroid Prime 3.

31:02.260 --> 31:07.680
But still, you look at the mainframe and everything that Xbox Live has to offer, and you kind

31:07.680 --> 31:12.460
of go, jeez, Nintendo really feels like a little bit behind in these realms of online

31:12.460 --> 31:13.460
play.

31:13.460 --> 31:17.500
But I suppose with their whole, you know, we're not making games for the hardcore gamers

31:17.500 --> 31:22.060
all the time type thing, maybe they can get away with that, and they probably can.

31:22.060 --> 31:24.060
So what have you?

31:24.060 --> 31:27.600
Well, if you have some further comments on this, you can always send us an email, mailbag

31:27.600 --> 31:30.980
at orangelandrater.com is the place to go.

31:30.980 --> 31:37.700
Meanwhile, I have some news for you guys, and it has to do with Star Wars The Force

31:37.700 --> 31:38.900
Unleashed.

31:38.900 --> 31:44.060
It's a new game coming out on the Nintendo Wii, and you know, a lot of folks are very

31:44.060 --> 31:48.300
excited that they're finally getting a Star Wars game, because of course, you know, Star

31:48.300 --> 31:53.340
Wars game equals, ooh, we're gonna have big lightsaber battles finally on the Wii, yes,

31:53.340 --> 31:54.700
what the Wii was made for.

31:54.700 --> 31:59.120
Well, according to a recent episode of the 1UP Podcast, thanks to my Twitter friends

31:59.120 --> 32:02.580
for pointing this out to me, it may not be so.

32:02.580 --> 32:07.300
It looks like the game may actually not feature that kind of support for...

32:07.300 --> 32:11.660
I would say, because I thought this was coming out on like 360 and Playstation 3 as well.

32:11.660 --> 32:12.660
Yeah, it's probably one.

32:12.660 --> 32:16.740
And it's just gonna be kind of like, you know, Knights of the Old Republic or something like

32:16.740 --> 32:22.780
that, you know, but a little bit more physics and stuff like, you know, it's gonna look

32:22.780 --> 32:23.780
pretty.

32:23.780 --> 32:27.980
But it's not like a true, you know, like playing the Star Wars arcade game, you know, the new

32:27.980 --> 32:32.740
arcade game where they had, you know, the actual lightsaber and stuff that you can play

32:32.740 --> 32:33.740
around with.

32:33.740 --> 32:37.020
I suppose there will be more to come on this, however, I'll leave you with this official

32:37.020 --> 32:41.580
quote from the president of LucasArts, Jim Ward, quote, Wii is a great platform for the

32:41.580 --> 32:46.180
Force Unleashed because the console's motion-oriented controllers really bring the game to life.

32:46.180 --> 32:50.260
We've worked hard to make the Wii version of the game unique in order to truly let you

32:50.260 --> 32:51.820
unleash the Force.

32:51.820 --> 32:56.300
Hmm, but if you, I mean, I don't know, I don't know to what validity the other podcast information

32:56.300 --> 32:58.940
is, but if it's not that way, that's gonna be a bummer.

32:58.940 --> 33:03.140
It'll probably have, like, limited stuff where you'll swing it around to, like, do different

33:03.140 --> 33:06.940
things, but it'll also be, like, if you're gonna be using the Force, like, if you push

33:06.940 --> 33:11.980
the remote and uncheck out, it'll be, like, doing the Force push or, you know, stuff like

33:11.980 --> 33:12.980
that.

33:12.980 --> 33:13.980
It's very limited.

33:13.980 --> 33:20.640
All right, well, I'll still, you know, check it out, and hopefully you do get to do some

33:20.640 --> 33:25.660
Wii lightsaber, but, you know, just because it doesn't have the lightsaber doesn't necessarily

33:25.660 --> 33:26.660
mean it'll be a bad game.

33:26.660 --> 33:29.900
I mean, a lot of people seem to enjoy the Lego Star Wars thing, which had really nothing

33:29.900 --> 33:33.980
to do with motion controls, so you can still have, there's still a lot of good games to

33:33.980 --> 33:38.220
be cranked out of the Star Wars franchise, and I'm sure they'll try for years and years

33:38.220 --> 33:39.700
and years to come.

33:39.700 --> 33:45.220
Well, I've made a mention of this earlier that I'm going to be getting one myself, but

33:45.220 --> 33:49.420
there you've confirmed that the Wii Zapper's gonna be out in Europe this year, though there's

33:49.420 --> 33:55.220
not a date on it yet, and the US will be out on the 19th of November, but the games that

33:55.220 --> 33:59.900
we'll work with so far is Link's Crossbow Training that's coming out, sort of like a

33:59.900 --> 34:03.540
shooting gallery type of game.

34:03.540 --> 34:07.100
There's Medal of Honor Heroes 2, Ghost Squad.

34:07.100 --> 34:10.900
I'm so excited about Ghost Squad coming out, by the way, because it's one of my favorite

34:10.900 --> 34:16.020
arcade games, and Resident Evil the Umbrella Chronicles, so it'll use the Zapper.

34:16.020 --> 34:20.740
Dan was saying at their conference that they weren't calling it a light gun.

34:20.740 --> 34:25.700
They were calling it a pointing system, a pointer system.

34:25.700 --> 34:27.620
I thought that was funny.

34:27.620 --> 34:28.620
Interesting.

34:28.620 --> 34:34.620
Also sort of related, too, is that he did see the new gun con that looks like the gun

34:34.620 --> 34:37.340
con 2 and has a trigger switch.

34:37.340 --> 34:38.340
Over time crisis?

34:38.340 --> 34:39.340
Yeah.

34:39.340 --> 34:40.340
Yeah.

34:40.340 --> 34:42.900
And has a trigger switch on the side for a directional button.

34:42.900 --> 34:47.940
Mr. DeBucket in chat says, it's not a gun, it's a blaster or a pointer.

34:47.940 --> 34:48.940
You know, but it ain't a bazooka.

34:48.940 --> 34:52.260
That thing is still as awesome as the Saturn Enforcer.

34:52.260 --> 34:53.780
Or the Super Scope 6, honestly.

34:53.780 --> 34:54.980
I mean, it was a fucking bazooka.

34:54.980 --> 34:56.300
You can't get any cooler than that.

34:56.300 --> 34:57.300
You really can't.

34:57.300 --> 34:59.180
I'm telling you, man, that thing is so useless.

34:59.180 --> 35:00.300
The miniser, Rob.

35:00.300 --> 35:01.300
The miniser.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.300
Or the activator.

35:02.300 --> 35:03.300
No.

35:03.300 --> 35:04.300
I have an activator.

35:04.300 --> 35:05.300
I'm sorry.

35:05.300 --> 35:06.460
I got it for nine bucks.

35:06.460 --> 35:08.220
I remember when Loki bought an activator.

35:08.220 --> 35:10.160
Why the hell did you buy an activator?

35:10.160 --> 35:12.140
You bought an activator on eBay for something.

35:12.140 --> 35:13.140
It was for your cabinet.

35:13.140 --> 35:14.140
It was for the cabinet.

35:14.140 --> 35:15.140
You poured money.

35:15.140 --> 35:16.420
You were going to do the Para Para thing.

35:16.420 --> 35:18.700
I was going to build a Para Para setup for the cabinet.

35:18.700 --> 35:23.820
This is back when I was going to build one control panel for every single Bomani game.

35:23.820 --> 35:26.980
And back when Para Para was cool.

35:26.980 --> 35:35.220
I ended up throwing the activator stuff away because I got it for like ten bucks.

35:35.220 --> 35:41.140
I did, however, and I still have them, I have the dream Para Para controller, which does

35:41.140 --> 35:45.140
hook up to the PC via a converter.

35:45.140 --> 35:47.380
So if I really want to.

35:47.380 --> 35:50.540
And I remember we played the dream Para Para on the Dreamcast.

35:50.540 --> 35:55.700
It's exactly the same as Para Para, except it has really crappy songs.

35:55.700 --> 35:56.980
Son of Dad asks a good question.

35:56.980 --> 35:59.780
Can Silent Hill Arcade be ported to the Wii with the Zapper?

35:59.780 --> 36:00.780
Probably.

36:00.780 --> 36:01.780
I hope so.

36:01.780 --> 36:02.780
It'll be fun.

36:02.780 --> 36:03.780
Don't you want to shoot Pyramid Head?

36:03.780 --> 36:04.780
Yes.

36:04.780 --> 36:05.780
With hearts?

36:05.780 --> 36:09.060
I'd like to shoot him with death.

36:09.060 --> 36:10.500
With death.

36:10.500 --> 36:11.820
Cake or death?

36:11.820 --> 36:13.180
Cake, please.

36:13.180 --> 36:14.180
Death.

36:14.180 --> 36:15.180
No, wait!

36:15.180 --> 36:17.700
Ha ha, you said death first.

36:17.700 --> 36:20.980
Actually since Dark Sakura brought up Resident Evil real fast, I wanted to say this because

36:20.980 --> 36:24.760
I know it's not in the show world tonight, but did you guys know that a new Resident

36:24.760 --> 36:26.300
Evil movie came out this week?

36:26.300 --> 36:28.060
Yeah, I saw it.

36:28.060 --> 36:30.860
Rice Princess called me last night wanting to know if I wanted to go see it and I was

36:30.860 --> 36:32.780
like, no, I don't.

36:32.780 --> 36:34.900
I never saw the second movie because I knew it would suck.

36:34.900 --> 36:35.900
I liked the second one.

36:35.900 --> 36:36.900
Did you?

36:36.900 --> 36:37.900
Yes, I did.

36:37.900 --> 36:38.900
Apparently the third one isn't bad.

36:38.900 --> 36:40.140
It's better than the second one is what people are saying.

36:40.140 --> 36:42.580
The second one had all the crap I wanted to see.

36:42.580 --> 36:43.580
Really?

36:43.580 --> 36:44.580
Being stuck in a city full of zombies.

36:44.580 --> 36:46.820
I mean, hey, that was fantastic.

36:46.820 --> 36:49.060
But the movie was number one at the box office this weekend.

36:49.060 --> 36:50.700
It beat the Dane Cook movie.

36:50.700 --> 36:51.700
And Jessica Alba.

36:51.700 --> 36:52.700
Was it the Dane Cook movie?

36:52.700 --> 36:53.700
Yes.

36:53.700 --> 36:54.700
Yeah, but Dane Cook sucks, so.

36:54.700 --> 36:59.940
And I think the movie has a 3% on Rotten Tomatoes and Resident Evil at least has like 10% I want

36:59.940 --> 37:00.940
to say.

37:00.940 --> 37:02.820
Okay, let's go see it this weekend, Rob.

37:02.820 --> 37:04.260
I don't know if I want to.

37:04.260 --> 37:05.260
Come on.

37:05.260 --> 37:06.260
I'll pay.

37:06.260 --> 37:07.260
There's serious...

37:07.260 --> 37:08.260
Okay.

37:08.260 --> 37:09.260
You can get dinner.

37:09.260 --> 37:10.260
Here, if you'll pay.

37:10.260 --> 37:13.700
If you want to do something better, Transformers just came into the IMAX.

37:13.700 --> 37:14.700
Ooh.

37:14.700 --> 37:18.660
I haven't seen 10 to 20 minutes of extra footage in there.

37:18.660 --> 37:20.140
Let's go, Rob.

37:20.140 --> 37:21.140
That I might have to go see.

37:21.140 --> 37:22.140
I haven't seen that yet.

37:22.140 --> 37:23.140
But I'm not paying for IMAX.

37:23.140 --> 37:25.140
Okay, I'll pay for IMAX though.

37:25.140 --> 37:27.780
That'll be fun.

37:27.780 --> 37:32.180
One thing I was going to say, once again, commenting on the Wii Zapper, completely useless

37:32.180 --> 37:33.180
piece of shit.

37:33.180 --> 37:36.300
And you guys will all buy it because it has Zelda crossbow training.

37:36.300 --> 37:39.380
You fucking sheep.

37:39.380 --> 37:41.380
And we will prove on this show.

37:41.380 --> 37:42.380
I'll buy it.

37:42.380 --> 37:43.380
Yeah, you will buy it.

37:43.380 --> 37:47.500
We will prove on this damn show that that piece of shit actually hinders your playing

37:47.500 --> 37:52.300
versus helping you and that it is a complete useless pile of junk.

37:52.300 --> 37:55.940
In fact, I think we should use Zelda's crossbow training as the game.

37:55.940 --> 37:56.940
As the game.

37:56.940 --> 37:57.940
All right.

37:57.940 --> 37:59.140
So, yes, for those that forget, Loki and I made a bet.

37:59.140 --> 38:00.140
What was it?

38:00.140 --> 38:01.380
About 10 weeks ago on the show?

38:01.380 --> 38:06.540
We made a bet when the Wii Zapper was first announced, Loki said the Zapper will not be

38:06.540 --> 38:08.180
better than using the Wiimote.

38:08.180 --> 38:12.460
So we made a bet that we're going to play a game and whoever can get the higher score

38:12.460 --> 38:16.840
in the game, Loki will not use the Zapper, I will use the Zapper in a game that was intended

38:16.840 --> 38:20.420
for the Zapper to be used, like Zelda crossbow training.

38:20.420 --> 38:25.040
If Loki can get a higher score than me, then I will have to take his wife out for an evening

38:25.040 --> 38:28.700
so that he can have the place to himself to play all the games that he wants.

38:28.700 --> 38:33.540
However, if I win, then Loki has to go out on a date with me and it'll be videotaped

38:33.540 --> 38:38.220
and chronicled for our listeners.

38:38.220 --> 38:41.700
I'm really just doing it to get a free dinner.

38:41.700 --> 38:44.140
There's nothing involved with that.

38:44.140 --> 38:47.000
I'm not making him put out at the end of the date or anything.

38:47.000 --> 38:51.900
That's taking it a little far, but it will be fun and it will be a free dinner.

38:51.900 --> 38:55.040
Darktitsia says, YouTuber, it didn't happen.

38:55.040 --> 38:58.540
Mikosynth says, I want Skye to win just because that would be freaking hilarious.

38:58.540 --> 39:00.660
I think so, it'd be a good time.

39:00.660 --> 39:01.660
Good times.

39:01.660 --> 39:02.660
Absolutely.

39:02.660 --> 39:05.500
All right, let's travel the globe and look at some release dates, things that are coming

39:05.500 --> 39:06.500
out very soon.

39:06.500 --> 39:08.900
Yes, starting in the US.

39:08.900 --> 39:13.300
This is a big week, of course, with Halo 3 coming out in the 360.

39:13.300 --> 39:16.380
All three versions on Tuesday.

39:16.380 --> 39:20.140
Better start lining up on Monday because everybody else is going to...

39:20.140 --> 39:21.700
You know what?

39:21.700 --> 39:22.700
Seriously?

39:22.700 --> 39:23.700
Why?

39:23.700 --> 39:24.700
Why do you need to line up?

39:24.700 --> 39:26.700
Can't you just go after work or school on Tuesday?

39:26.700 --> 39:29.340
So you can be the first people in the world to play it.

39:29.340 --> 39:30.340
Guess what?

39:30.340 --> 39:31.340
You're not.

39:31.340 --> 39:34.060
Three people on my friends list have already been playing it and we had it.

39:34.060 --> 39:35.060
You know what?

39:35.060 --> 39:37.980
You're not the first in the world, so just wait for Tuesday.

39:37.980 --> 39:40.660
Do you really have to get it at midnight?

39:40.660 --> 39:41.660
That's what I want.

39:41.660 --> 39:44.740
I want to know how many people in our chat room are planning to run out at midnight tomorrow

39:44.740 --> 39:47.220
and buy the game, and if so, why?

39:47.220 --> 39:49.220
That's what I want to know.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.220
Yeah.

39:50.220 --> 39:51.220
Sorry.

39:51.220 --> 39:54.180
Anyways, other games coming out this week, actually some that I'm looking forward to.

39:54.180 --> 39:58.260
Jackass the Game on PlayStation 2 and PSP.

39:58.260 --> 39:59.500
I've got to buy this game.

39:59.500 --> 40:01.120
It just looks...

40:01.120 --> 40:02.280
It's too much fun.

40:02.280 --> 40:03.280
I would...

40:03.280 --> 40:04.620
Well, you don't got to buy the game.

40:04.620 --> 40:05.620
I have to buy the...

40:05.620 --> 40:08.180
Well, yeah, I don't have to buy the game.

40:08.180 --> 40:11.100
Anyways, other games coming out.

40:11.100 --> 40:15.820
Also we have CSI Hard Evidence on Xbox 360.

40:15.820 --> 40:21.740
Hot Wheels Beat That, which I'm sure is going to be an awesome game, on Xbox 360, PlayStation

40:21.740 --> 40:25.300
2, and the Wii.

40:25.300 --> 40:32.100
A small old game called Dance Dance Revolution Supernova 2 is going to be coming out on PlayStation

40:32.100 --> 40:33.100
2.

40:33.100 --> 40:34.100
Yes it is.

40:34.100 --> 40:35.100
Where did that come from?

40:35.100 --> 40:36.100
Yeah.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.100
It's coming out next week.

40:37.100 --> 40:38.100
Yeah.

40:38.100 --> 40:39.100
Funny enough, they haven't...

40:39.100 --> 40:40.100
Oh, battle things.

40:40.100 --> 40:41.100
Yeah, I know.

40:41.100 --> 40:42.100
I was like, oh, yeah, DDR.

40:42.100 --> 40:43.100
I remember when I played that every day.

40:43.100 --> 40:46.460
CSI Three Mentions of Murder on PlayStation 2.

40:46.460 --> 40:52.900
My favorite title, or just name of a title, this week is Soul Nomad and the World Eaters

40:52.900 --> 40:54.060
on PlayStation 2.

40:54.060 --> 40:56.540
I saw the website for that.

40:56.540 --> 41:01.520
It's by the people who did, crap, now I can't think of it.

41:01.520 --> 41:03.180
It's a tactics game, though.

41:03.180 --> 41:04.180
Nice.

41:04.180 --> 41:08.340
I think they did Grimm and Gremor, if I remember correctly.

41:08.340 --> 41:17.060
Or, let's see here, World Series of Poker 2008, and then, of course, on PlayStation

41:17.060 --> 41:23.420
2, PlayStation 3, and the PSP NBA 08.

41:23.420 --> 41:30.620
Let's see, Skates coming out on PlayStation 3, and let's see, on the Wii, you have Bratz

41:30.620 --> 41:34.420
the movie, Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party.

41:34.420 --> 41:37.060
Loki, why do you even bother reading that title, Bratz?

41:37.060 --> 41:42.140
I mean, can you think of a single person who listens to this show who might purchase Bratz?

41:42.140 --> 41:43.140
I don't know.

41:43.140 --> 41:45.140
There's people that buy Hannah Montana games, so I have to mention everything.

41:45.140 --> 41:46.140
Okay, you know what?

41:46.140 --> 41:47.140
No.

41:47.140 --> 41:48.140
I'm going to pose that question to our listeners.

41:48.140 --> 41:52.380
I want to know if any of our listeners actually go out and purchase Bratz on the Wii.

41:52.380 --> 41:57.500
If so, you have to send a picture, because emailing us just isn't good enough for something

41:57.500 --> 41:58.500
of that caliber.

41:58.500 --> 41:59.500
I actually want to see a picture.

41:59.500 --> 42:00.500
Anyways...

42:00.500 --> 42:02.980
I'm going to let Loki read those dates in the future.

42:02.980 --> 42:07.260
Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party for the Wii is coming out this week as well.

42:07.260 --> 42:08.260
Really?

42:08.260 --> 42:09.260
Yes.

42:09.260 --> 42:10.260
The bundle.

42:10.260 --> 42:16.740
Let's see here, and then on the DS, we've got Math Play, which I'm sure is fun, and

42:16.740 --> 42:23.180
it has to do with math, Race Driver Create and Race, Crayola Treasure Adventures...

42:23.180 --> 42:24.820
Yay!

42:24.820 --> 42:32.380
It's basically a bunch of crap, and I guess there are some spelling challenges and shit

42:32.380 --> 42:38.140
game coming out on the DS and PSP.

42:38.140 --> 42:42.260
I'm going to read some comments in chat real fast before we get to the next set of dates

42:42.260 --> 42:45.780
here, because there's comments about the 360 midnight launch.

42:45.780 --> 42:47.540
Remember I mentioned that a little bit ago?

42:47.540 --> 42:51.700
SSJ100Matt says, ask the people who lined up for the new Harry Potter book.

42:51.700 --> 42:54.900
Everyplace Imaginables sold it, why line up?

42:54.900 --> 42:57.820
Because there were people that seriously took off work the next day to read the book all

42:57.820 --> 42:59.820
damn day.

42:59.820 --> 43:03.420
Like a lot of my friends.

43:03.420 --> 43:07.300
Rama asks, so how many people are going to call out sick to play Halo 3?

43:07.300 --> 43:11.940
Rob D says, I'd go if the crowds weren't all frat boys and racist 12 year olds.

43:11.940 --> 43:19.360
I love what an employee of an unnamed store told a friend of mine and Dan's.

43:19.360 --> 43:23.140
We have to call you and tell you that your reservation for Halo 3 is here, but you don't

43:23.140 --> 43:25.380
have to come at midnight if you don't want to.

43:25.380 --> 43:32.320
It'll be there the next day.

43:32.320 --> 43:38.220
If you want to comment, chat.orangelaungeradio.com and you can say such things like DJ Morpheus

43:38.220 --> 43:40.820
says, Rob is the Chris Crocker of internet radio.

43:40.820 --> 43:41.820
You know what?

43:41.820 --> 43:42.820
Fuck that guy.

43:42.820 --> 43:43.820
Seriously.

43:43.820 --> 43:46.360
That guy sucks.

43:46.360 --> 43:51.220
I cannot believe he's famous for that stupid, all right, forget it.

43:51.220 --> 43:52.220
Release dates.

43:52.220 --> 43:53.220
Oh, is it my turn?

43:53.220 --> 43:54.220
Yes.

43:54.220 --> 43:55.220
Oh, whatever.

43:55.220 --> 43:57.660
Oh yeah, Halo 3 on the 26.

43:57.660 --> 43:58.660
Big whoop.

43:58.660 --> 43:59.660
Ha, you get it.

43:59.660 --> 44:00.660
Day later.

44:00.660 --> 44:01.660
Oh yeah.

44:01.660 --> 44:06.540
Yeah, but technically their day later is, no, it is later, isn't it?

44:06.540 --> 44:07.540
Anyway.

44:07.540 --> 44:08.540
They're always a day later.

44:08.540 --> 44:11.700
Moving forward to the 28th.

44:11.700 --> 44:17.500
We have a whole bunch of shit coming out.

44:17.500 --> 44:22.500
Armed assault, Queen's Gambit on PC, Blazing Angels, Secret Missions of World War II on

44:22.500 --> 44:29.020
PC, Company of Heroes, Opposing Fronts, Conan on some stuff, Crazy Taxi, Fair Wars, PSP,

44:29.020 --> 44:35.260
Enemy Territory, Quake Wars, FIFA 08 on damn near everything, Grim Grimoire, Jam Sessions,

44:35.260 --> 44:41.980
Juice 2, Hot Import Nights, King of Clubs, MotoGP 07, Ratatouille on damn near everything,

44:41.980 --> 44:44.420
Sega Rally also on damn near everything.

44:44.420 --> 44:47.020
Is that an official console, damn near everything?

44:47.020 --> 44:48.020
Yes.

44:48.020 --> 44:50.860
Stranglehold, it's like the GameX, Rob.

44:50.860 --> 44:51.860
Stuntman Ignition.

44:51.860 --> 44:54.540
Oh yeah, we got that, I think.

44:54.540 --> 45:02.100
Test Drive Unlimited, Xbox 360 Classics, and The Settlers Rise of an Empire.

45:02.100 --> 45:03.100
Good times.

45:03.100 --> 45:04.100
Yeah.

45:04.100 --> 45:06.420
Moving over to Japan, checking out the release dates in Japan.

45:06.420 --> 45:09.700
On the Wii, Bass Fishing Wii is coming out.

45:09.700 --> 45:13.620
Now usually you go, you know, oh hooray, a fishing title on the Wii.

45:13.620 --> 45:19.180
But I think the box art to this game is hilarious because they have like this random sexy girl

45:19.180 --> 45:22.780
wearing a little camouflage vest going, hey, I just caught a fish.

45:22.780 --> 45:24.940
I posted the link in chat so they can see.

45:24.940 --> 45:30.200
But the little cover art for the game cracked me up, so Bass Fishing on the Wii is coming

45:30.200 --> 45:31.200
out.

45:31.200 --> 45:33.840
I don't think if it comes to America it'll have that box art.

45:33.840 --> 45:36.980
My Sims is coming out on the Wii in Japan, the Japanese version.

45:36.980 --> 45:41.180
Boku no, sorry, Boku to Sim Nomachi is what it's called over there.

45:41.180 --> 45:46.300
On the PlayStation 3, The Elder Scrolls Oblivion finally comes out to the PlayStation 3 on

45:46.300 --> 45:51.620
September 27th, along with Agarest Senki is coming out.

45:51.620 --> 45:55.460
It's a compile game from them, and that's coming out on the PlayStation 3.

45:55.460 --> 45:58.420
Looks to be a little strategy-based game.

45:58.420 --> 46:01.620
Kind of looks like it has some RPG elements to me.

46:01.620 --> 46:04.820
Actually, that battle kind of looks like an Eternal Sonata battle.

46:04.820 --> 46:08.300
Hmm, a little tactical there in nature.

46:08.300 --> 46:12.900
Fantasy Star Universe Ambition of the Illuminus comes out on the PlayStation 2, and when I

46:12.900 --> 46:16.460
first read this I thought it said Fantasy Star Universe Abortion of the Illuminus, and

46:16.460 --> 46:21.020
I was like, well, that's going to be a controversial game, but it's Ambition, Ambition.

46:21.020 --> 46:23.160
We may be calling that once it comes out.

46:23.160 --> 46:29.020
Some people called Fantasy Star Universe an abortion of a game, but it's not that bad.

46:29.020 --> 46:31.580
I didn't think it was that bad.

46:31.580 --> 46:37.140
PlayStation 2, Bleach Blade Battle 2nd, coming out on the PlayStation 2, because, you know,

46:37.140 --> 46:38.740
you can't have enough Bleach.

46:38.740 --> 46:41.660
A game is coming out on the DS, and this could be useful.

46:41.660 --> 46:43.780
It's Bartender DS.

46:43.780 --> 46:46.740
This is a game that teaches you how to mix drinks.

46:46.740 --> 46:47.740
Fuck yeah!

46:47.740 --> 46:49.620
That could actually be pretty handy.

46:49.620 --> 46:52.420
Now that is making usefulness out of the DS.

46:52.420 --> 46:53.420
Good job.

46:53.420 --> 46:54.420
Props to those guys.

46:54.420 --> 46:59.220
Namco Bandai is putting out another Tamagotchi game in Japan on the 27th for the DS.

46:59.220 --> 47:04.980
Tamagotchi no Pucci Pucci Omiseki Mina San Q is coming out.

47:04.980 --> 47:06.720
It's a strategy Tamagotchi game.

47:06.720 --> 47:09.660
And then on the PSP, Yu-Gi-Oh!

47:09.660 --> 47:15.780
Dual Monsters GX Tag Force 2, because you just can't get enough Yu-Gi-Oh!

47:15.780 --> 47:16.780
Can you, Jamie?

47:16.780 --> 47:18.500
Don't you love Yu-Gi-Oh?

47:18.500 --> 47:21.500
Not in English.

47:21.500 --> 47:24.740
But it looks like I'm trying to see, oh, it looks like another card battle game.

47:24.740 --> 47:25.740
Surprise, surprise.

47:25.740 --> 47:26.740
Yeah.

47:26.740 --> 47:28.740
All right, that's it for release dates in Japan.

47:28.740 --> 47:37.380
Anyways, so, Tokyo Game Show came out and, yeah, there's a whole bunch of news that I'm

47:37.380 --> 47:41.540
totally, it was really shocking.

47:41.540 --> 47:46.500
Of course, this can't be true because, you know, Sony's come out numerous times saying

47:46.500 --> 47:52.780
that they have no plans on making the 6-axis rumble, but, oh, looky there, look, it's the

47:52.780 --> 47:53.780
DualShock 3.

47:53.780 --> 47:56.380
Oh my God, that's so surprising.

47:56.380 --> 47:58.100
Didn't know that was going to happen.

47:58.100 --> 48:03.300
Okay, let me put it this way, if there's ever a Sony rumor about, you know, them releasing

48:03.300 --> 48:09.340
a new SKU, new features coming, et cetera, it's probably true, and that also goes for

48:09.340 --> 48:10.340
Microsoft.

48:10.340 --> 48:11.980
It's probably true.

48:11.980 --> 48:16.420
So with that being said, the DualShock 3 is official.

48:16.420 --> 48:21.580
It will feature the same wonderful technology that was in the DualShock 2, as well as now

48:21.580 --> 48:24.380
you get, you know, the tilt stuff.

48:24.380 --> 48:29.980
It's coming out in Japan in November, the rest of the world in spring of 2008.

48:29.980 --> 48:34.620
There will be some interesting features for it, including, I believe, they're going to

48:34.620 --> 48:38.940
be, you know, some of the newer games are going to be supporting it.

48:38.940 --> 48:43.760
Also some of the older games that have already come out will be able to support rumble as

48:43.760 --> 48:49.700
well through a patch system that they're going to implement, so, you know, Resistance, and

48:49.700 --> 48:53.860
I think Ratchet and Clank is going to support it, stuff like that, so.

48:53.860 --> 49:00.300
That's cool, you know, with them saying that, you know, rumble is last gen stuff, that you

49:00.300 --> 49:01.300
don't need it.

49:01.300 --> 49:03.200
Boy, they sure know how to backpedal.

49:03.200 --> 49:08.540
Of course, the entire chat room is bursting out in unison, GS68 says, STFU, Sony rumble

49:08.540 --> 49:14.540
is so last gen, and Darktetsuya says, but rumble is so last gen, eye roll.

49:14.540 --> 49:18.620
So what do you think finally caused them to release this controller that we all knew was

49:18.620 --> 49:20.380
coming six months ago?

49:20.380 --> 49:22.660
The whole immersion thing is what it is.

49:22.660 --> 49:24.420
It's because they finally settled with them.

49:24.420 --> 49:28.620
They're saying, oh no, we planned on doing stuff like this, you guys wanted it so we

49:28.620 --> 49:29.620
made it happen.

49:29.620 --> 49:34.120
You know, it's just spin, all it is is that they were going to have it originally, I mean,

49:34.120 --> 49:38.660
why else would the controller shells have room for, I don't know, rumble motors?

49:38.660 --> 49:42.820
Hmm, that's kind of odd seeing as they never planned on having them there in the first

49:42.820 --> 49:43.820
place.

49:43.820 --> 49:47.780
Oh wait, yes they did, but then they found out a company got pissed at them for stealing

49:47.780 --> 49:51.820
their technology, so.

49:51.820 --> 49:52.820
It's all a bunch of bullshit.

49:52.820 --> 49:57.620
Now if I'm understanding this correctly, when the rumble comes out, is the six axis motion

49:57.620 --> 49:58.620
thing going away?

49:58.620 --> 50:00.620
No, it's going to still be there.

50:00.620 --> 50:01.620
It's both.

50:01.620 --> 50:02.620
It's both now.

50:02.620 --> 50:03.620
Okay.

50:03.620 --> 50:04.620
So the two can work together.

50:04.620 --> 50:10.980
Oh yeah, there's special algorithms, they said, that they have, that can detect, can

50:10.980 --> 50:15.320
detect that, you know, the controller shaking is not actually you tilting it in a different

50:15.320 --> 50:16.320
direction or something.

50:16.320 --> 50:20.500
What we've done is we've actually taken a race of little gnome people and put them inside

50:20.500 --> 50:25.880
the controller, and they're speedily calculating all these different algorithms, making the

50:25.880 --> 50:30.020
six axis and rumble technology work together in perfect harmony.

50:30.020 --> 50:33.620
Wow, that's so amazing, because no other systems have been able to do that yet.

50:33.620 --> 50:38.020
Oh wait, no, I take that back, the Wii has one that works just like that.

50:38.020 --> 50:43.180
So the Wii is also powered by little gnome people, that's why they're so hard to get.

50:43.180 --> 50:46.320
I mean, the gnome women are having to crank out babies left and right to make this.

50:46.320 --> 50:48.940
The gnome people are going to go on strike.

50:48.940 --> 50:51.860
No, hell no, we won't rumble.

50:51.860 --> 50:58.020
Please, please, Nintendo and Sony, think of David the gnome, think of David the gnome.

50:58.020 --> 51:01.700
Nintendo Media 64 says in our chatroom, Loki, so that means that Metal Gear Solid 4 and

51:01.700 --> 51:04.900
Final Fantasy 13 will actually be on the 360, they are rumors.

51:04.900 --> 51:09.660
No, I've no Final Fantasy 13, I don't think I'm taking a future story, sorry if I am,

51:09.660 --> 51:15.860
but Final Fantasy 13, they definitively said at the end of the trailer, PlayStation 3 only,

51:15.860 --> 51:17.820
when they showed it at Tokyo Game Show this week, so.

51:17.820 --> 51:24.700
Yeah, what they did show on there is 2020, you can come play at my house, Rob.

51:24.700 --> 51:31.540
Final Fantasy 13 in 2013, that's the whole, yeah, and it'll come out on 1.13 or something,

51:31.540 --> 51:33.700
I don't know, forget it.

51:33.700 --> 51:34.700
Anyhow.

51:34.700 --> 51:35.700
Okay, forget what?

51:35.700 --> 51:36.700
Yeah, exactly.

51:36.700 --> 51:42.220
One other thing that is pretty cool about the PlayStation 3, I mean, hey, heckle Sony

51:42.220 --> 51:45.420
all you want over some of the decisions they've made, but you've got to admit, this is pretty

51:45.420 --> 51:49.860
cool, is the whole fact that you can have the PlayStation portable functionality with

51:49.860 --> 51:53.980
the PlayStation 3, even though we've given it shit on the show before for the rear view

51:53.980 --> 51:58.740
mirror and stuff, you know, things like they've done in Lair and some of their future enhancements

51:58.740 --> 51:59.900
look pretty cool.

51:59.900 --> 52:05.220
They actually, Kazurai was talking about it at the keynote that happened at Tokyo Game

52:05.220 --> 52:11.220
Show, and they were using this game, Manichi Demo, and it introduces some new functionality,

52:11.220 --> 52:16.220
it allows you to turn on and off your PlayStation 3 via remote play, okay, I mean, that doesn't

52:16.220 --> 52:20.340
seem like a real big deal to me, but multiple PSP systems in the future will be able to

52:20.340 --> 52:27.780
connect as a hub, and they're wanting to continue this and use this more often, so pretty cool.

52:27.780 --> 52:31.420
I like this idea, except for the fact that, you know, you have to have a lot of friends

52:31.420 --> 52:33.220
with PSPs for it to work, but they're coming out at a price.

52:33.220 --> 52:36.100
In case you want to have three rear view mirrors.

52:36.100 --> 52:38.620
Well, you need side mirrors.

52:38.620 --> 52:44.100
Well, awesome, that must be a reason why they're buying their system, you know, rear view mirror.

52:44.100 --> 52:45.100
Absolutely.

52:45.100 --> 52:46.100
Awesome.

52:46.100 --> 52:50.500
So, now all my friends have to go out and get a PSP so we can play these games.

52:50.500 --> 52:51.500
I have a PSP.

52:51.500 --> 52:52.500
Alright, cool.

52:52.500 --> 52:53.500
You'll have to play.

52:53.500 --> 52:55.540
Oh wait, I need a PlayStation 3 first.

52:55.540 --> 52:56.540
I have a PS3.

52:56.540 --> 52:59.540
Hey, I'm all set when it comes to rear view mirrors, Kaz.

52:59.540 --> 53:02.140
You already have three PSPs, don't you?

53:02.140 --> 53:03.140
Exactly.

53:03.140 --> 53:05.260
I can see behind me perfectly.

53:05.260 --> 53:08.420
Don't you have to have a certain firmware for that to work?

53:08.420 --> 53:09.420
What are we talking about?

53:09.420 --> 53:10.420
I could be running 3.7.

53:10.420 --> 53:13.020
Hey, I want to do a story of you up, can I, can I, huh, huh, huh?

53:13.020 --> 53:14.020
You may.

53:14.020 --> 53:20.380
Well, recent reports thanks to Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII shows that the PSP sales

53:20.380 --> 53:22.420
have surged in Japan.

53:22.420 --> 53:31.340
In fact, it's gone up by six times on the previous week, and just to give a list of

53:31.340 --> 53:37.580
how performance has been, and that's, again, for the last week.

53:37.580 --> 53:51.220
PSP, 95,487 units, DS, 79,974, Wii, 26,181, PS2, 13,128, PS3, 13,121, the PS2's outselling

53:51.220 --> 53:52.220
the PS3.

53:52.220 --> 53:53.220
That's funny.

53:53.220 --> 54:01.740
Xbox 360, 1,243, Game Boy Advance, 836, and they're still selling Gamecubes at 97 units.

54:01.740 --> 54:05.240
You know, it's pretty surprising, well, it's not surprising that they've sold so well,

54:05.240 --> 54:09.260
because Crisis Core would only run on the PSP Slim, so if you wanted to play it, you

54:09.260 --> 54:10.620
had to buy one.

54:10.620 --> 54:11.620
Thank you, Sony.

54:11.620 --> 54:12.620
Awesome.

54:12.620 --> 54:14.060
Whoa, it won't run on an old PSP?

54:14.060 --> 54:15.060
No, it won't.

54:15.060 --> 54:16.060
Why?

54:16.060 --> 54:17.060
Actually-

54:17.060 --> 54:18.060
Because it's using the full clock.

54:18.060 --> 54:19.060
It's-

54:19.060 --> 54:20.060
Crisis Core?

54:20.060 --> 54:21.060
Yeah.

54:21.060 --> 54:22.060
It will.

54:22.060 --> 54:23.060
I've seen side-by-side comparisons of the game.

54:23.060 --> 54:24.060
Aha!

54:24.060 --> 54:27.060
There's a video file out showing how Crisis Core runs on an old PSP and a new one.

54:27.060 --> 54:28.060
That's right, I've seen that.

54:28.060 --> 54:29.060
That's right, I've seen that.

54:29.060 --> 54:30.060
I thought they said that it wouldn't.

54:30.060 --> 54:35.000
It has a higher loading time, and although I thought it was funny that when they showed

54:35.000 --> 54:39.620
the demo battles, both battles finished at the same time, even though the PSP one loaded

54:39.620 --> 54:40.620
later.

54:40.620 --> 54:43.620
Well, I thought that it supported- I thought they needed the, um, 3.6.

54:43.620 --> 54:45.340
Well, you thought wrong!

54:45.340 --> 54:48.100
Well, this is what I read, okay?

54:48.100 --> 54:49.100
Whatever.

54:49.100 --> 54:53.580
Well, side-by-side comparisons showed- but the thing that was good about that comparison

54:53.580 --> 55:00.500
is that it did show the, uh, better processing power in the, um, in the, uh, new PSPs, but

55:00.500 --> 55:06.220
also just another comparison for, uh, software releases in relation to those hardware releases

55:06.220 --> 55:13.020
is that, um, Crisis Core, um, of course, was the top seller, followed by, um, Pokemon Fushigi

55:13.020 --> 55:21.020
no Dungeon, Tokino, uh, uh, Tonkentai, and also the, uh, Yami no Tonkentai, um, followed

55:21.020 --> 55:27.660
by that Fate Tiger Coliseum, Another Centuries Episode 3, the final, Taeko no Satsujin DS,

55:27.660 --> 55:33.380
Mario Party 8, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, Ring of Fates, Sengoku Musou 2, Mushoden,

55:33.380 --> 55:36.980
and my housekeeping diary, so.

55:36.980 --> 55:37.980
That was number 10.

55:37.980 --> 55:38.980
Well, the women had to buy something.

55:38.980 --> 55:39.980
For sales.

55:39.980 --> 55:42.500
No, they were buying Pokemon.

55:42.500 --> 55:43.700
I want Crisis Core, though.

55:43.700 --> 55:46.180
I apologize to all our female listeners this week after today's episode.

55:46.180 --> 55:47.180
You need to apologize to me, Rob.

55:47.180 --> 55:48.180
I'm, you know-

55:48.180 --> 55:51.780
You need to beg my forgiveness.

55:51.780 --> 55:57.220
Dear Dark Sakura the Great and Terrible, I beg upon ye for forgiveness.

55:57.220 --> 56:03.060
Buying Crisis Core, you know, would only encourage them to make games like Dirge of Service,

56:03.060 --> 56:04.060
so.

56:04.060 --> 56:05.060
I like Dirge of Cerberus.

56:05.060 --> 56:07.620
Besides, I can't really play Crisis Core right now, it's all in Japanese.

56:07.620 --> 56:08.620
Vincent Maycry.

56:08.620 --> 56:09.620
Vincent's awesome.

56:09.620 --> 56:11.140
But when it comes out in the US, we'll see.

56:11.140 --> 56:14.060
I don't mind playing it in Japanese.

56:14.060 --> 56:16.220
Next story, please.

56:16.220 --> 56:23.380
Anyways, um, so, there's another game that's also gonna be coming out pretty soon in Japan,

56:23.380 --> 56:29.020
if you know that game that we thought was free before, oh, but never fear, Sony's here

56:29.020 --> 56:31.940
to take a shit on you.

56:31.940 --> 56:41.060
Gran Turismo 5 Prologue has been priced in Japan for 4980 yen, and also it will be coming

56:41.060 --> 56:48.700
out on Blu-ray as well for a total savings of about five bucks for 4500 yen.

56:48.700 --> 56:54.460
I'm sorry, 4980 was the Blu-ray version, 4500 was the download.

56:54.460 --> 57:00.620
So yeah, you save five dollars downloading it straight to your PS3.

57:00.620 --> 57:05.660
Now I know it's supposed to come with, I think, about 40 cars, and looks pretty nice, but

57:05.660 --> 57:11.940
I mean, after all, you are buying pretty much a partial game, I guess, because it's technically

57:11.940 --> 57:13.880
kind of like a demo.

57:13.880 --> 57:20.040
So 40 bucks for a partially finished game, when you can wait probably a year and play

57:20.040 --> 57:23.500
the full game for 60 bucks?

57:23.500 --> 57:26.620
I don't know, do people like Gran Turismo 5 that much?

57:26.620 --> 57:31.580
But if you're interested, it's coming out December 13th, in Japan, or if you have a

57:31.580 --> 57:35.540
Japanese account, you can probably download it over here.

57:35.540 --> 57:37.100
But not that you do that, because that's wrong.

57:37.100 --> 57:42.820
Fuck no, I'm not gonna pay that, I'm not gonna pay like, what is the equivalent of like $43.10

57:42.820 --> 57:44.460
for Gran Turismo 5?

57:44.460 --> 57:46.820
I want the full game if I'm gonna be paying that kind of money.

57:46.820 --> 57:51.020
Well, Loki, would you pay $69.99 for the Eye of Judgment?

57:51.020 --> 57:55.620
Because the Eye of Judgment comes out soon, on October 23rd.

57:55.620 --> 57:56.620
It looks funny.

57:56.620 --> 57:57.620
For $69.99.

57:57.620 --> 58:02.740
Now the good news is, that is the price of the game and the PlayStation Eye, which is

58:02.740 --> 58:03.740
the peripheral.

58:03.740 --> 58:07.740
Or as we call it here on the program, the Brown Eye of Judgment, that will come with

58:07.740 --> 58:08.860
the PlayStation Brown Eye.

58:08.860 --> 58:12.760
So if you want to get a Brown Eye for your PlayStation, you can get one on October 23rd

58:12.760 --> 58:14.820
for $69.99.

58:14.820 --> 58:19.840
You also get a little camera stand with it, but it's called, this is my favorite part,

58:19.840 --> 58:22.540
the camera stand is called the Judgment Stand.

58:22.540 --> 58:30.820
I'm sorry, I just think of like Judge Judy or something when I see the Judgment Stand.

58:30.820 --> 58:31.820
Here come the Judge.

58:31.820 --> 58:38.620
Booster, now here's the other thing, okay, there's battle maps that come with it, a starter

58:38.620 --> 58:42.060
deck of cards comes with it, and an eight card booster pack.

58:42.060 --> 58:43.620
Here's where things get interesting.

58:43.620 --> 58:48.400
If you want more booster packs, they'll cost you $3.75 each.

58:48.400 --> 58:53.780
You can also get one of five pre-constructed theme packs for $14.99.

58:53.780 --> 58:56.920
Now of course, Loki was wondering, well what the hell is going to stop me from making my

58:56.920 --> 58:59.060
own cards and using them to play online?

58:59.060 --> 59:00.060
Aha!

59:00.060 --> 59:03.020
Well, what's going to happen is that you're going to have to pre-register your decks with

59:03.020 --> 59:09.360
the game and you put in your serial numbers, I suppose, and then the software will randomly

59:09.360 --> 59:13.580
select what cards get drawn next, that way you can't stack the deck.

59:13.580 --> 59:14.580
That's stupid.

59:14.580 --> 59:17.700
Yeah, I can't, it's stupid.

59:17.700 --> 59:22.820
I'm sorry, you know, whereas, okay, maybe the PlayStation Brown Eye can have some future,

59:22.820 --> 59:28.860
you know, nobody's really done a decent camera, I mean how long did that Xbox 360 vision thing

59:28.860 --> 59:29.940
last?

59:29.940 --> 59:33.740
Like it didn't, like it fizzled the moment it hit, because it had, what did it have going

59:33.740 --> 59:34.740
for it?

59:34.740 --> 59:35.740
Totem Ball.

59:35.740 --> 59:36.740
And the fact that you can make your own gamer picks.

59:36.740 --> 59:38.860
Let me put it this way, it was as popular as the eye toy.

59:38.860 --> 59:39.860
Yeah.

59:39.860 --> 59:46.220
Seriously, cameras for systems, I think people just, they're like, ooh, that's kind of cool,

59:46.220 --> 59:48.580
and then, ehhh.

59:48.580 --> 59:56.700
Eye Toy squeezed out a little more life out of it, the Eye Toy squeezed a little more

59:56.700 --> 01:00:02.020
life out of it, but just because it had DDR probably in, you know, some of the Harry Potter

01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:03.860
games and things that kids were into.

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:08.300
But the Brown Eye's going to need a lot more than the Brown Eye of Judgment to do well,

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.300
I think.

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:16.060
And that's just plain online and stuff, it says via cheating, pre-registering your decks.

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:18.220
I mean, people are going to crack that so fast.

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:20.100
Well cheat in person all you want.

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:23.060
People are going to crack that shit so fast, it's not even funny.

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:24.060
Why?

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:28.140
Is this on, I ask the cracking and hacking community of the world out there, is this

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:29.900
worth hacking?

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:30.900
I mean.

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:34.700
If you're going to spend $69 on the game, you're of course not going to, I bet you anything

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:40.420
those booster packs and theme packs do not sell well, they're hoping that it takes over

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:47.140
like Pokemon or Yugioh or Magic or anything like that, and just people are going crazy

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:50.760
over the Eye of Judgment and sells tons of systems.

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:54.560
They live in this dream world that does not exist, is what the problem is.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:59.600
I agree, however, when I hear about things like that whole SingStar thing will have the

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:04.780
camera and you can upload your videos to like a YouTube type service, that sounds interesting.

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:08.180
Yeah, it does sound interesting, and here's the other thing, the PlayStation 3 does support

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:12.640
other cameras other than the PlayStation Eye, so if you have your own webcam that's USB,

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:16.100
why the fuck are you spending money on the PlayStation Eye if you're just going to be

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:23.560
using the video camera to upload, why, I don't know why, but uploading yourself singing badly

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:26.840
to karaoke to put on this YouTube type thing.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:30.340
If you really need that much attention, you could probably set up your own webcam and

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:35.480
put it on the real YouTube, and guess what, that will be free, and more people will probably

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.480
see it.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.680
And you can be angsty about Britney Spears or something, and millions of people will

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:40.680
view it.

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:43.640
I just, I don't see the point.

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:48.520
I mean, the PlayStation Eye of Judgment is as bad as I thought it was, so.

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:52.120
Alright, well if you plan on purchasing the Eye of Judgment, we'd love to hear from you,

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:53.120
mailbagorangeonstrader.com.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.220
I want to know why.

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:58.520
If you're going to camp out at midnight to buy it, we especially want to hear from you.

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.100
Why?

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:01.360
That's just what I want to know why.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:05.240
I hope I get one for free, but I know I won't.

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:08.240
Even if you get one for free, I think you should destroy it live on our program.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:11.320
They did show off the Eye of Judgment at their conference.

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:14.560
Loki, Loki, Loki, if you get a brown Eye of Judgment for free, can we destroy it on the

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:15.560
program?

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:16.560
Sure.

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:17.560
Hooray!

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:18.560
Destroy destruction!

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.560
Oh, I want the camera.

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.560
We'll set something up outside.

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:26.760
I want to play the game and then, like, in the middle of the game, set the thing on fire.

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:30.720
Like, if you're playing someone online and then you're, like, dealing another card, they'll

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.440
go, fuck this shit.

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:33.440
Whoosh.

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.440
We're totally going to do that.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:36.440
That'll be hilarious.

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:37.440
We will totally do that.

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:41.360
We'll set something up where we can start a small fire and it'll be safe, and we will

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.840
set the PlayStation Eye on fire live during a match on the PlayStation Online store.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.200
I love this idea.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.340
I love it.

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:50.320
I like anything that involves fire, Rob.

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:51.320
All right.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.320
Awesome.

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.320
Well, how about something that doesn't suck?

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:54.320
All right.

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.320
How about it?

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:58.560
Metal Gear Solid 4, which is full of happy and joy.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:09.280
Kojima was saying that the Metal Gear Online experience is going to include a starter pack.

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.640
Trying to look through this to see exactly what this starter pack is.

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.480
It's like an online starter pack.

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:19.200
I'm not seeing anything too specific, but maybe it's...

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:21.640
This is like a glorious demo of the game.

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:22.640
Yeah.

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.640
Can I say this real quick while you're...

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:25.640
Yeah.

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:29.840
Oh, you can roll over enemies in a barrel.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:33.960
Somebody in chat sent me a message, this is hilarious, SSJ100Matt says, if the Eye of

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:41.000
Judgment becomes a success, Loki must promise to dress up as Tingle.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.880
I will take that bet because I know...

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:43.880
Whoa!

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:44.880
He took the bet!

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.280
Ladies and gentlemen, everybody must go out.

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:53.520
You record, time stamp this, record it, put it in the archive, the bet has been taken.

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:57.200
Okay, now we have to wait, hold on now, we need to set the parameters here now.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.600
You said a success.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:03.160
What do you mean exactly by a success because that's very general and very broad.

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:06.440
It needs to sell like say a million units, how about that?

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.440
Is that a success?

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.440
Yes.

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:11.760
If the Eye of Judgment sells a million units, Loki will dress up as Tingle.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.760
I will dress up as Tingle.

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:19.040
I guarantee you, if that thing sells a million copies, which it will not.

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.040
Wait, worldwide or domestic?

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:23.660
You gotta be specific because the damn thing could take off in Japan.

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:24.660
You never know.

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.040
I will even, I'll go as far as saying worldwide.

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:28.040
Holy shit!

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:29.040
Holy shit!

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.040
I don't think it will do anything.

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.440
I don't know how many billion people in the world.

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:36.160
That's like saying one in four people buys this thing that owns a Playstation 3 and there's

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.220
no way that's going to happen.

01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:41.360
Suddenly everybody in chat has just preordered the Eye of Judgment.

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:42.360
Go right ahead.

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.520
Worldwide, I bet you anything that will not sell a million copies.

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:49.800
Wait, we have to set a deadline here because a million copies could happen like eight years

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:50.800
from now or something.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:51.800
Okay, six months after release.

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:52.800
Six months, okay.

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.800
That's six months after release.

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:54.800
If it sells a million units...

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.800
One million copies worldwide within six months.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:00.440
Alright, you got it.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:01.440
Don't forget chat room.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.740
Don't let him forget this.

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:07.040
You are all witnesses and I will take many, many videos.

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:08.040
Oh, goddamn.

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:11.300
I'm even going to go out and buy the Eye of Judgment now just to destroy it and get us

01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:12.300
one step closer.

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:13.300
You're dressing up as Tingle on YouTube.

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:15.480
To Loki dressing up as YouTube.

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:18.040
Dressing up as Tingle on the whole thing being put on YouTube.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.040
Here's the best part.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:25.960
If it sells a million units, Loki will be dressed up as Tingle burning on fire and no

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:27.360
one will get it.

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:30.160
Can you imagine our poor opponent?

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:35.320
Okay, cosplayers who listen to the show will be sending you measurements.

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:36.500
Here's the thing.

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:39.920
We have to be playing Bobby Black Wolf when it happens and nobody tell them what's going

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:45.240
to happen because Bobby was your first friend on the PlayStation 3, so nobody tell Black

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.800
Wolf what we're up to.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:47.800
Is he going to buy that?

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:48.800
But he'll be the one.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:49.800
I don't know.

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:52.040
We'll send him a copy just to make this happen, okay?

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:54.520
How about to go back to Metal Gear Solid 4?

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.520
I'm sorry, yes.

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:56.520
I'm still cracking up.

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:59.200
They're basically saying that some of the gameplay that's going to be involved in that

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:03.960
little demo was like it was saying rolling over enemies with a barrel and then shooting

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.680
people into the air with a cannon.

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:07.680
That's fun.

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:08.680
Yeah.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:11.160
Is he going to do those moves like he does in Super Smash Brothers where he comes up

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:15.600
behind somebody and looks like he's about to, you know, ass rape them?

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:16.600
He does that in all the other games.

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:17.600
Why not?

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:18.600
Alright.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:19.600
Sounds like fun.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:20.600
Anyways.

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:21.600
Sorry.

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.200
I had too good of a laugh.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:29.320
In case you don't get enough of browsing the PlayStation 3 store because, you know, there's

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:35.540
a whole lot to look at on there, you will now also have the ability to browse the store

01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:37.800
on the PC soon.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:48.440
So, you'll be able to purchase PSP content without using the PS3 and also, I think that's

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:54.440
all it's being used for right now is basically PSP content because I guess a lot of people,

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:59.560
you know, don't have a PS3 so if they want to download those, really, a lot of people

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:00.560
don't have a PlayStation 3.

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:01.560
Yeah.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:02.560
I know.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.560
It's surprising.

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.640
If they want to download those, you know, PS1 games, now they can do that.

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:06.640
So, hooray!

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:12.200
Well, the thing that got everybody excited about a PlayStation 3 earlier this year was

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:16.960
PlayStation Home and if you were hoping to play PlayStation Home this year, you better

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:20.960
hope you're in the beta because otherwise, you're not playing it until spring of 2008.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:23.240
Oh, something delayed on the PlayStation 3.

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:24.240
I know.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.240
Who would have thunk it?

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:26.240
Really?

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:28.960
This bombshell was announced by Kazurai during the Tokyo Game Show press conference.

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.200
You want to know something else that was delayed?

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.960
Seriously, everything that comes out on the PlayStation 3 has been delayed lately.

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:40.280
I mean, like, Skate came out a couple weeks later, was it Stunt Magnition came out almost

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:44.580
a month later, Stranglehold's been delayed again to the end of October now.

01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:48.280
Which just goes to show the PlayStation 3 should have waited before it released.

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:50.080
But anyway, that's old news now.

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:51.960
It should have released this year.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:56.120
But for guys of twos coming out, it'll go a month later?

01:07:56.120 --> 01:08:00.680
You know, here's the thing though, despite all the shit I'm talking about it, if it's

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:03.320
that awesome, maybe it'll be worth the wait.

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:09.360
You know, I'd rather they do release it bug-free or with as few bugs as possible and just really

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:13.940
awesome and the killer app to have for the PlayStation rather than them rush it to make

01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:14.940
it for this year.

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:15.940
Right?

01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:20.280
They'll eventually decide to charge for it once, you know, it's been so long.

01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:21.740
It might be worth it.

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:23.320
That's a big might.

01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:24.320
Big might.

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:25.320
But it might be worth it.

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:26.320
It has potential.

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:27.640
But we'll see.

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:32.120
Meanwhile, I still have no reason to get a PlayStation 3 until Final Fantasy 13 comes

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.260
out.

01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:36.580
So that's all I have to say on PlayStation Home.

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:37.580
Being delayed.

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:43.180
Well, for those who are keeping up with some of the news out of Togo Game Show, there is

01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:49.280
a new Kingdom Hearts, well, more I would say addition to the Kingdom Hearts franchise to

01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:53.900
be out on DS, PSP, and mobile phones.

01:08:53.900 --> 01:09:00.240
There is going to be Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep for the PSP.

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:04.720
It's a single player RPG like the PS2 one.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:13.640
Kingdom Hearts 3, 58 slash 2 days for the DS, which is a 3D game with Roxas.

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:17.000
And it also will have a four-way multiplayer mode.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:22.160
And the last one is Kingdom Hearts Coded that is on mobile phones.

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.560
Coded sounds actually pretty cool.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:27.880
It's like the original Kingdom Hearts game, but you can almost like edit the worlds or

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:29.240
something as you're playing through it.

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:32.640
It's like the Matrix and Kingdom Hearts together.

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.920
That actually though, after playing Kingdom Hearts 2, at least from the beginning of it

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:40.440
makes perfect sense if it's like set in, you know, I don't want to spoil it for anyone,

01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:42.360
but if it's set like in dude's computer.

01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.360
Hmm.

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:45.640
Remember with Roxas and all that.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.120
I never beat Kingdom Hearts 2.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.120
But you did play it from the beginning, right?

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:49.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.120
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.120
So you know what I'm talking about.

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.120
Yeah, I do.

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.120
I do.

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.120
I'm looking forward to the games.

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:55.120
I'll check them out.

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.120
I mean, hopefully they're better than Chain of Memories.

01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:00.560
But as long as the Disney stuff stays intact, because that's the one thing that always worries

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:01.560
me.

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:04.280
It worried me about that Final Mix trailer or whatever it was at the end of Kingdom Hearts

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.280
2.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.380
Like it was very, very not Disney related.

01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:10.000
And to me, that's a big charm of the series.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.040
You know, come on, Tron World was like the awesomest part of Kingdom Hearts 2.

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:21.940
So as long as the games aren't totally deviating from the Disney stuff, I think it'll be okay.

01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:25.080
It's very interesting that everything's going handheld, especially with Squeenix between

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:26.560
this and Dragon Quest IX.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:31.080
I'd be surprised if Final Fantasy XIV wasn't for the DS.

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:32.080
We'll see.

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:36.280
Well, one good thing we can say about the PlayStation 3 is that it has really helped

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.720
the Folding at Home project.

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:45.200
In fact, they have made the milestone achievement of reaching one petroflop.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:50.040
That's one quadrillion floating point operations per second.

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:57.200
And basically, it would take everyone in the world 75,000 calculations in a second to achieve

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:59.640
a similar result.

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:03.460
So that's pretty awesome.

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:05.360
But have they found the cure for cancer yet?

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.360
No.

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.360
So what good is a petroflop?

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:08.360
If the program has...

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:09.360
No, I'm just kidding.

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:10.360
I think it's a fun little project.

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:12.560
I like those distributed things.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:15.480
You know, there's actually an OL Army for Folding at Home, and I tried running it on

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:19.920
my computer for a while, but it conflicts with World of Warcraft.

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.800
Like you can't run them both at the same time.

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:22.800
Priorities, Rob.

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:26.760
World of Warcraft is clearly more important than cancer.

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.760
Absolutely.

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:33.000
Going to comments from chat, they're a little bit delayed, so sometimes we report on the

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000
last story.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.520
TheRobD says, Skye, none of the Kingdom Hearts 2 stuff had Disney stuff in there either,

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:40.600
so Kingdom Hearts will have Disney.

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:43.960
And WonderDocHerald says, singing along with the Little Mermaid was the best part of Kingdom

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:44.960
Hearts 2.

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:46.820
Not Tron, but the Little Mermaid.

01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:51.820
This part sucks because the songs were awful, but, the original songs, but they were even

01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:55.080
worse in Japanese.

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.240
But the Little Mermaid has awesome music.

01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:00.100
Well, the songs that were from the Little Mermaid were good, but the ones that they

01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:02.240
made up for the game sucked ass.

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.120
The Japanese ones were pretty.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:08.720
Yeah, but the songs were actually worse in Japanese, including the originals.

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:12.120
And TheRobD just wanted to clarify, he meant the trailers.

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:16.040
Well yeah, I got that, but hopefully the listeners did too.

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:20.600
And Ghost in our chat room says, World of Warcraft causes cancer.

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:26.040
If you're smoking and playing WoW at the same time, which I've seen people do, it just might.

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:27.360
And drinking.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:30.840
Then you're going to have all sorts of problems.

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:37.000
Well, the MotorStorm developers are not going to have a problem making money anymore, because

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.120
they just got bought from Sony.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:44.180
Sony bought Evolution Studios, and it's a subsidiary of BigBig Studios.

01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:49.000
They made Pursuit Force, but of course Evolution Studios were the makers of MotorStorm, and

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.880
lots of Sony fans are very happy with the game MotorStorm, and Sony's very happy with

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.000
it too.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.400
Evolution has also unveiled that since they've been purchased, they've also been given the

01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:00.120
go-ahead to make MotorStorm 2.

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:05.680
Which, as a side note, Nintendo, make Excite Truck 2.

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:06.680
You want them to make it?

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:07.680
My wife demands it.

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:08.680
Excite Truck 2?

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:10.140
Excite Truck 2.

01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:11.140
Or Excite something else.

01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:14.680
So it could be like Excite Boat, I don't know.

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:15.680
No.

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:16.760
That won't work.

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:19.800
We do not need another Hydro Thunder.

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:24.840
Well, when I think of what a cool...how about Cobra Triangle on the Wii?

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:25.840
That game was awesome.

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:26.840
I played that game.

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:27.840
Cobra Triangle was so awful.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:28.840
It was so awful.

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:29.840
Rad.

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:30.840
Shut up!

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:33.920
Cobra Triangle was like RC Pro-Am mixed with Gradius in boats.

01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:35.560
How is that a bad thing, I ask you?

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:36.560
I don't know.

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.600
This is pretty bad.

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:42.880
By the way, Big Big Studios is already making Pursuit Force Extreme Justice.

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:43.880
That should be fun.

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:44.880
That should be fun.

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:45.880
That should be fun.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:46.880
Next week or two.

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:47.880
Yeah.

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:48.880
Very cool.

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:52.120
Well, congrats, Sony, on your marriage with these new companies.

01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:53.120
Congrats to Dark Sakura.

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:54.600
Let the humping start.

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:59.240
Congrats to Dark Sakura for finding yet another website to share with our listeners tonight.

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:03.240
And this is the next to the last website of the week segment.

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:04.240
Can you believe it?

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:05.240
I know.

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:11.120
I should say next week will be Dark Sakura's final website of the week because in the next

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:14.520
series of episodes, starting with 250, she's going to be doing the classic game of the

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:15.520
week.

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.520
Yep.

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:17.520
Which will be fun.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:20.520
So until then, though, she surfs the internet up and down, finding her last few websites

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:21.600
to share with you.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:23.120
She's got one for you this week.

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:26.720
Take it away, Miss Dark Sakura.

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:31.020
The website of the week is actually one given to me by Sauce.

01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:32.020
It's retrojunk.com.

01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:33.020
R-E-T-R-O-J-U-N-E.

01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:34.020
Retrojunk.com.

01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:40.400
And this site is the best ever, ever.

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:45.640
You have everything from old TV show intros to commercials, including video game commercials.

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:51.720
Oh my God, Rob, I found out that a game that I love that was a PC game was actually on

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:55.640
the Turbo Duo and now I have to find it even though it's 30 bucks on eBay.

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:56.640
Dang.

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:57.640
What game was that?

01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:58.640
Loom.

01:14:58.640 --> 01:14:59.640
Loom is rad.

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:00.640
I love Loom.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:01.640
Good choice.

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:06.840
But there's, in fact, on their main page, I actually have an article about the Sega

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:10.560
Master System, which I don't know if anyone knows, the Sega Master System was actually

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:15.440
still going pretty strong in Brazil for a very long time with a lot of games that came

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:22.280
out on 16-bit and later coming out over there on this 8-bit system.

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:23.280
Lots of really cool stuff.

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:30.480
I mean, just some of the TV intros listed on the main page is Danger Mouse and Voltron

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:33.280
Hunter, Robocop.

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:38.320
The commercials listed are old Nickelodeon commercials from 1982.

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:39.320
That's awesome.

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:40.320
Private Benjamin.

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:43.960
And I'm sure YouTube just makes this shit even better now because everything's on YouTube

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:44.960
now.

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:48.600
Actually, all of this stuff, from what I understand, I don't think these are links out of YouTube

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:50.120
but hosted on their own thing and all the...

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.120
Oh, cool.

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:53.880
As much of the stuff on there is actually pretty damn good quality.

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:54.880
Nice.

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:58.620
One thing that I was actually watching the Voltron went, oh my God, there's an article

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:02.200
on here that's 80s movies you hate to love and it's got a picture of Shona from The Last

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.200
Dragon.

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:04.200
Shona.

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:06.200
Who's the master?

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:07.200
Shona.

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:08.200
Yep.

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:12.640
And some of the trailers on here is like The Brave Little Toaster and King Kong versus

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:13.640
Godzilla.

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:14.640
Wow.

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:21.040
This is pretty cool and it has stuff dating back to the 60s, 70s, 80s, I think 60s but

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:27.680
definitely the 70s, 80s, and 90s and lots of just really awesome retro stuff.

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:28.680
Pretty fun.

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:34.680
What I was trying to mention is that I went back to watch the Voltron one and it actually

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:38.040
had the Go Lion intro and outro on it.

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:39.240
A lot of the chat room seems...

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:40.840
And David the Gnome, Logie.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:44.520
A lot of the chat room gives your website of the week their seal of approval.

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.160
I'll be linking this in the chat room.

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:50.400
Also, if anyone is curious, there also is a forum on here.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:54.120
It looks like they are talking about, oh, do you remember this?

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:56.040
Do you want to see this?

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:58.400
I'm trying to remember the name of this show.

01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:59.400
That type of thing.

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:00.400
And there is one on here.

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.480
This is which video game songs made you tear up.

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:03.480
Aww.

01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:06.240
I had one that made me cry.

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:07.240
What's that?

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:08.240
It was Eyes On Me.

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:09.240
Aww.

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:10.240
Final Fantasy VIII.

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:11.240
Whimp.

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:12.240
Just kidding.

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:13.240
I'm a girl.

01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:14.240
I'm allowed.

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:15.240
No, I was getting...

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:16.240
To bite my ass, Rob.

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.440
I was getting a little choked up at Eternal Sonata.

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.200
I didn't cry but I was getting a little choked up.

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:20.200
I was getting va-clempt.

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:21.200
Eternal Sonata...

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:22.200
Talk amongst yourselves.

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:25.360
Eternal Sonata made me a little va-clempt.

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:26.360
Eternal Sonata.

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:29.160
Neither Eternal nor Sonata.

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:30.160
Disgust.

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:31.160
555-4444.

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:32.160
Anyhow.

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:33.160
Yeah.

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:38.600
Loki, please save this program.

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:40.200
What is Africa?

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:46.560
Sure, we know it's a continent in the world, but really, what is Africa the game?

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:52.960
Well, it is a Pokemon Snap type of Jungle Safari game where you drive around and you

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:54.280
take pictures of wildlife.

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:55.280
That's awesome!

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:56.280
Africa.

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:58.560
No, I totally want to play that.

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.280
So it's Africa Snap?

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:01.280
Apparently, yeah.

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.280
Rad!

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:03.280
No, I totally...

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:07.920
The only, only way I will play this game, and goddamn it, this better be possible, and

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:12.760
I know it's won't be because they're going to pussy out, is if I can't drive my Jeep

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:19.560
all over the savanna, destroying wildlife as it rolls underneath my tires.

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:24.080
That is the only way I will play this game.

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.960
They're going to put the fucking things on a track.

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:26.960
You know it.

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:27.960
Just like in Pokemon Snap.

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:30.960
Because you would have tried to run over all the Pokemon, too.

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:31.960
Yes.

01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:35.560
I'm totally going to play this game.

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:38.800
I fished out money for the Cardcaptor Sakura game just because I thought it was like Pokemon

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:39.800
Snap.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:41.440
That, and I wanted a clock and a plate.

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:42.700
Pokemon Snap is fucking rad.

01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:44.400
It's like one of the most underrated games in my opinion.

01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:46.360
The Cardcaptor Sakura game, however, is not.

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:50.120
But it comes with a clock and a plate, a knife, a fork, spoon, and...

01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:51.920
Does it have a little wand you can wave?

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:53.920
No, and a pillowcase.

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:57.200
It was on Dreamcast.

01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:03.160
Rama says the game should be like Jumbo Safari, and I agree, because Jumbo Safari is awesome.

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:04.880
Let's see.

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:09.040
Tiger Claw says, I'm more curious how the AI in the game is like.

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:11.600
Like if you see a pride of lion, will it show them getting it on?

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:12.600
Of course, mine doesn't...

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.320
Well, it shows them eating something.

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:17.000
I want to see blood in this game.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Eating smaller animals.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.480
I want M-rated Africa.

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:26.560
We want monkeys flinging poo, lions doing it, and lots of carnivorous death.

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:31.160
The Rob D. says, is Debbie Downer today saying, I don't think Africa is going to be a sandbox

01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:32.160
GTA game.

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:36.400
I don't know why they're like making this out to be like a big game for the Playstation

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:37.400
3.

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:40.200
It's just like, it's going to be yet another disappointment.

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:44.280
Yet another average game where it's like, look, it's the most realistic African safari

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:45.280
ever!

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:47.020
And then people will be like, so?

01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:48.520
We need people to actually get shot though.

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:52.160
I'm not buying your fucking $600 system for an African safari.

01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:53.160
Fuck you.

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:56.320
Mr. DeBucket says, Africa is a former Hot Shots Golf 5 minigame.

01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:58.440
You used to shoot gold balls at the animal.

01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:00.400
That must be weird.

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:06.080
Someone, uh, GS68 was bringing up, uh, Let's Go Jungle, a rail shooter where you shoot

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:07.080
the wildlife.

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:12.240
If you want to join in the fun, chat.orangelandrager.com where we do take live on Sunday nights.

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.280
I did not want to kill the animals.

01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:17.200
I wanted to see the animals killing other animals.

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:18.200
That's right.

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:21.320
Like I said, carnivorous death.

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:25.760
They need, the monkeys need to be out, you know, picking each other's fleas and eating

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:26.920
them.

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:32.760
And the, all the animals need to be out doing it and giving birth and eating other animals.

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:33.760
While I plan on...

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:34.920
And they need evil giraffes.

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.880
Here's the perfect way to derail the show.

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:38.440
Screw Africa.

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:43.520
It's all about laser cats to the game for Playstation 3.

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:45.880
Where is my laser cats next gen game?

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:51.480
I, I, can you, I mean, this lolcats thing on the internet, you know, the I can ass cheeseburgers

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:54.680
of the world and all that stuff, the lolcats, has really become this little phenomenon.

01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:57.240
How come the video game industry is not cashing in on the lolcats?

01:20:57.240 --> 01:20:58.240
Oh, don't worry.

01:20:58.240 --> 01:20:59.240
They're a little bit behind.

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:02.400
I mean, after all, they're making them with that stupid crazy frog racer thing.

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:07.160
Well, I feel like Space Giraffe was the closest thing I got to a lolcats game because some

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:09.120
of the comments it would make was like lolcats.

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:12.240
I want a lolcats game.

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:14.560
Mr. DeBucket says we need a ceiling cat game.

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:15.560
Winner!

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:16.560
It's a ceiling cat game.

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:22.560
But, but, if you've been on cat macros on LiveJournal lately, it's all nothing but fucking

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:24.880
ceiling cat lately.

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:32.360
Everyone is picking any word that ends in eight and making a ceiling cat macro to it.

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:36.360
Like ceiling cat is watching you masticate or fornicate or abbreviate.

01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:41.040
But my favorite one, someone, two people did this, they did one with Daleks and it says

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:43.720
ceiling cat is watching you exterminate.

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:47.000
That was great.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.500
There's one with Bill O'Reilly, ceiling cat is watching you bloviate.

01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:54.580
Um, let's see where's, there was one that was like, there were some of the older ones,

01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:56.760
one of these was like a marathon post.

01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:57.760
Yeah.

01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:59.260
It had like everything.

01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:03.720
And one of them is ceiling cat is watching you look for words that end in eight.

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:08.200
Ceiling cat is watching you cogigate, ceiling cat is watching you regurgitate.

01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:11.880
Ceiling cat is watching you vegetate, ceiling cat is watching you spin a plate.

01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:14.280
Sealing Cat is watching you precipitate.

01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:17.160
Sealing Cat is watching you perm- permutate.

01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:18.720
Sealing Cat is watching you oblivious.

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:22.320
With Harry Potter reference there, Sealing Cat is watching you percolate at a Starbucks

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:23.320
there.

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:25.720
Sealing Cat is watching you animate with The Simpsons.

01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:28.440
This is my favorite, the little truck.

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:30.640
Sealing Cat is watching you compensate.

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:35.080
Anyway, I'll link that in chat, because I'm sure the podcast answers are like.

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:36.440
I like Sealing Cat is doing a figure eight.

01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:38.280
Dude, what the hell did I sign up for?

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:40.300
Yeah, and Wunderdog Harold is right on.

01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:46.380
says it's like green eggs and ham for a new generation can you imagine that is

01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:51.940
untapped profit right there what the sues series no to make like children's

01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:57.500
books like with like internet with Lord yeah you know like ceiling cat you know

01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:00.580
the book for children you know could have like a whole thing to go along with

01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:10.380
it ceiling cat is watching this show suck no I didn't end at eight sorry well

01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:14.620
what can always what can save a show from going downhill is a good old story

01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:21.580
that relates to porn or in this sense erotic miss in World of Warcraft that's

01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:27.380
right an erotic role-playing guild that was spanned across two realms has been

01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:32.980
disabled by blizzard blizzard forcibly disbanded the guild but of course they

01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:37.460
just went and made it under a new name the guild abhorrent taboo is a horrid

01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:43.300
side RP guild on Ravenholtz a Ravenholt which is almost the name of the server I

01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:49.660
play on Ravencrest it had an alliance chapter on Blackwater Raiders here was

01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:54.380
their welcome message on their forums quote role-playing is legal even if you

01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:57.140
are role-playing something that wouldn't be considered deplorable and highly

01:23:57.140 --> 01:24:00.580
illegal in real life it's still just role-playing it isn't subject to any

01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:04.460
form of disciplinary action negative publicity is still publicity make a dig

01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:07.700
or website about how sick we are reporters to perverted justice all it

01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:11.700
does is bring in more members in fact the dig guy on Ravenholt made us made

01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:15.460
about us was so effective several people signed up for a while just to be in our

01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:18.420
guild the bottom line is we're allowed to do what we want on any server we

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:22.860
please and no one can do anything about it and those types of things by the way

01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:29.780
would be extreme sexual situations meaning sometimes with folks that are

01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:34.980
under 18 blah blah blah cetera cetera use your imagination here yeah but it's

01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:40.620
all in game it's all fake anyways so are you saying it's okay it's all in game

01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:43.820
they're not going out and actually having sex with like children or

01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:48.100
something like that unless if they are then that's you know wrong but it's all

01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:54.740
in game I mean let let them end up on an episode of like you know was it a date

01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:59.180
line or something like that yeah you know I'm kind of torn on this is that

01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:03.660
you know I do believe censorship is wrong at the same time there's probably

01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:06.860
some pretty I mean there might be some normal people that are trying to you

01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:09.180
know this gives a bad name to role players everywhere is what it really

01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:13.620
does but you know on the same time blizzard has the right to do whatever

01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:18.820
they want with their servers all they need to do is go second life I mean come

01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:24.740
on I mean way back away worse than what we're doing to which mr. de bucket says

01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:28.700
pedo bear is watching you play World of Warcraft I guess that's a play on

01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:34.420
ceiling cat I have no idea huh no pet a bear you don't get it and yeah yeah I

01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:38.820
get it I guess it's been going on for a while is that I you know I never noticed

01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:42.460
these guys in game but folks have been petitioning customer service and posting

01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:46.500
in the suggestion forms wanting people to do stuff about this extreme role play

01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:51.980
and finally this guild was forcibly disbanded and we'll see if there's a

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:56.100
comment from blizzard here oh yes quote this matter is not one blizzard takes

01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:59.820
likely in air lightly in any way shape or form we do not wish to have this

01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:03.460
topic continue circulation let it finally be said that we appreciate those

01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:06.460
of you who brought this particular issue to our attention and it will continue to

01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:09.340
follow up with this matter in the future to ensure the safety of all parties is

01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:13.820
concerned by the way the guild is reformed their new name is vile and a

01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:20.140
FEMA anathema anathema I mean what does that even mean I don't know and it means

01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:28.860

Zaku says Loki I'm sorry but speaking in a sexually suggestive manner to a minor

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:51.060
is not protected speech by the way what dictionary definition a thing that is

01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:57.180
detested or loathed cursed or consigned to damnation or destruction at least they

01:26:57.180 --> 01:27:02.500
have a sense of humor about it interesting well you know what I only

01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:05.500
blame the parents because they should be watching them what their kids are doing

01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:09.740
amen to that hmm good point all right I don't want to talk about this while

01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:15.420
guild anymore I'm done are you spent yes I'm spent well this is the best thing I

01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:19.900
think to ever be control to be controlled to be invented is the ps2

01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:26.660
nerf wireless controller I some I think it's actually dark test yeah I think

01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:30.640
posted a link in live journal about this and I want one so I can throw my

01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:33.860
controller at the screen and not break my spleen in my TV you know lots of

01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:39.460
people do that throw their controllers everywhere so art I mean seriously the

01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:44.840
to read the description on gamestop.com the nerf wireless controller from

01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:49.500
pelican allows gamers to play like a pro baller on their PlayStation 2 the

01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:52.700
controllers are made from soft pliable nerf material on the outside but feature

01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:57.340
legendary pelican performance on the inside legendary mass they are tough

01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:01.380
enough to withstand hardcore squeezing throwing twisting spiking and feel like

01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:06.100
no other controller on the market and there's retail for $24.99 I thought

01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:10.900
those came out like a long time ago I don't know if they did but I want one

01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:15.420
maybe it's a new version or something who knows they're kind of ugly but

01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:24.420
adorable mm-hmm like an ugly baby all right and on that note I think we'll

01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:27.460
bring part a to a close we've gone long tonight on part a I guess we have a lot

01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:31.160
