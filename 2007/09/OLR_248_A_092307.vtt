00:14.087 --> 00:25.147
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, September 23rd, 2007, a highly anticipated Wii game is going online, Sony goes back to good vibrations, and have we finally figured out what the game Africa is all about?

00:31.502 --> 00:35.984
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.024 --> 00:42.747
[SPEAKER_02]: We are that video game program dedicated to video games, gaming, gamer culture, the gamer lifestyle, and boobs.

00:43.067 --> 00:43.787
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, DarkSakura?

00:44.047 --> 00:44.747
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I have some.

00:44.968 --> 00:46.108
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, congratulations.

00:46.268 --> 00:46.688
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

00:46.868 --> 00:47.529
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell my mom.

00:47.749 --> 00:48.029
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

00:48.849 --> 00:52.113
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please tell her about the show you do on the internet where we talked about your boobs tonight.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.916
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure she'll really appreciate that.

00:53.976 --> 00:54.837
[SPEAKER_05]: You've called her.

00:55.317 --> 00:55.638
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

00:55.718 --> 00:58.341
[SPEAKER_02]: That was an old OLR stunt.

00:58.361 --> 00:59.162
[SPEAKER_02]: That was old news.

00:59.322 --> 01:00.103
[SPEAKER_02]: That was yesterday's news.

01:00.123 --> 01:01.525
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's not call my mom today, okay?

01:01.545 --> 01:02.386
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, probably not.

01:03.444 --> 01:06.606
[SPEAKER_02]: Also joining us, the man with no boobs, and that's a good thing, Loki.

01:06.866 --> 01:07.266
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

01:07.626 --> 01:08.206
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, Loki?

01:08.526 --> 01:08.766
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.

01:09.387 --> 01:09.707
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

01:10.127 --> 01:15.729
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just the three of us here in studio tonight, just, you know, feeling the love between the three of us, since there's no guests to speak of tonight.

01:16.269 --> 01:19.671
[SPEAKER_02]: Miklatov sadly moved back to Kansas, so he's not going to be on the show for a long time.

01:19.711 --> 01:22.212
[SPEAKER_02]: He might be back in December for a little bit, but we won't have him on for a while.

01:22.805 --> 01:24.907
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

01:52.358 --> 01:53.659
[SPEAKER_05]: I started playing a game again.

01:54.579 --> 01:57.699
[SPEAKER_05]: One that I played for a very, very, very, very, very long time.

01:57.779 --> 01:59.380
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, did you get into Final Fantasy XI again, too?

01:59.940 --> 02:00.500
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck no!

02:01.600 --> 02:03.441
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm playing Ragnarok Online again.

02:03.561 --> 02:04.041
[SPEAKER_02]: Heal, please.

02:04.621 --> 02:09.222
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what are you... Because you were a white mage in Final Fantasy XI, so... What are you playing as in Ragnarok now?

02:09.922 --> 02:13.403
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I started off with a ninja, and they kind of suck.

02:14.143 --> 02:16.384
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went back to my old standby of Assassin.

02:18.132 --> 02:23.795
[SPEAKER_05]: and right now I am at level 7947, I think.

02:24.956 --> 02:25.736
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-huh.

02:25.977 --> 02:27.297
[SPEAKER_05]: 79 base, 47 job.

02:27.457 --> 02:27.858
[SPEAKER_02]: Sheesh.

02:27.978 --> 02:28.498
[SPEAKER_05]: Assassin.

02:28.818 --> 02:30.339
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's a 50-50-50 server.

02:30.759 --> 02:35.982
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't played Ragnarok in a long time, so I kind of forget what that means, but it just sounds like borderline addict.

02:36.983 --> 02:46.248
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the whole thing about it is that it's very, it's pretty quick leveling, the way that they've got the ratio set up, with lots and lots of loot.

02:47.079 --> 02:47.559
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.

02:47.719 --> 02:49.520
[SPEAKER_02]: You said you're playing on a server that's 50-50-50?

02:49.780 --> 02:50.140
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

02:50.601 --> 02:53.262
[SPEAKER_02]: Gravity's going to come in and say, We ban you!

02:53.582 --> 02:54.242
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck Gravity.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.123
[SPEAKER_02]: You're playing on a 50-50 server.

02:56.584 --> 02:57.524
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't do anything.

02:57.784 --> 03:02.806
[SPEAKER_05]: And besides that, I can go back to IRO anytime I want to because I was in the beta and they don't delete the beta characters.

03:02.826 --> 03:03.387
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's good.

03:03.987 --> 03:06.508
[SPEAKER_05]: So my characters are still sitting there.

03:07.088 --> 03:09.289
[SPEAKER_05]: And to tell DJ Dark Knight, the...

03:11.940 --> 03:19.263
[SPEAKER_05]: The ninja class I haven't quite figured out just because I haven't found any good FAQs in English.

03:19.863 --> 03:23.445
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dark Knight's comment for the record was, ninjas don't suck, Jamie.

03:23.725 --> 03:25.105
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 50-50-50, by the way.

03:25.866 --> 03:27.426
[SPEAKER_02]: And what does 50-50-50 mean?

03:27.506 --> 03:30.528
[SPEAKER_05]: Meaning that it's a higher ratio for leveling.

03:30.608 --> 03:34.049
[SPEAKER_05]: You get more experience, more loot.

03:35.150 --> 03:39.992
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more experience for base level, for job level, and for your loot.

03:40.412 --> 03:40.992
[SPEAKER_05]: It's drop rate.

03:42.367 --> 03:44.968
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, it means you get a whole bunch of crap.

03:45.928 --> 03:51.110
[SPEAKER_05]: And, like, I was already over 400,000 zeny for money, like, in two days.

03:52.730 --> 03:55.871
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and the thing is that I just don't, like, play and play and play and play.

03:56.251 --> 04:01.613
[SPEAKER_05]: I play and then sit and do other stuff while I'm talking to people and then go, oh, I'm still logged into Ragnarok and play some more.

04:02.353 --> 04:04.794
[SPEAKER_05]: And then go, okay, I'm bored, sit, and then go do other stuff.

04:05.695 --> 04:10.196
[SPEAKER_05]: So, because it's windowed and really easy, I can just leave it running.

04:10.649 --> 04:11.590
[SPEAKER_05]: And the server's really nice.

04:11.610 --> 04:15.794
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm playing on Deliverance Online, if anyone... Windowed MMOs for the win.

04:16.154 --> 04:17.255
[SPEAKER_05]: Windows, yes.

04:18.156 --> 04:23.461
[SPEAKER_05]: I am going to be quitting World of Warcraft until such a day that I have a PC that works that will run it.

04:24.342 --> 04:33.671
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be playing Guild Wars instead, because thanks to Plan C, it only took them, like, I'd have to say four business days, I think.

04:34.580 --> 04:36.961
[SPEAKER_05]: They got me my key restored.

04:37.721 --> 04:37.921
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

04:38.441 --> 04:40.041
[SPEAKER_05]: And they email it right to you.

04:40.081 --> 04:40.861
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's cool.

04:40.941 --> 04:44.782
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to go... It's really cool.

04:44.822 --> 04:46.623
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of just being all like, oh, fuck you.

04:46.723 --> 04:47.783
[SPEAKER_05]: Your key's broken.

04:47.903 --> 04:48.343
[SPEAKER_05]: You lose.

04:48.863 --> 04:54.704
[SPEAKER_05]: They will actually... If you send them a high quality enough image, they will decipher what your key is.

04:55.245 --> 04:55.605
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

04:56.405 --> 04:56.545
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

04:58.052 --> 04:59.433
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll give you whatever your key was.

04:59.453 --> 05:01.594
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll base it off of the one that you were given.

05:01.694 --> 05:02.114
[SPEAKER_02]: Dang.

05:02.474 --> 05:03.815
[SPEAKER_02]: So their customer service is really good then, huh?

05:03.835 --> 05:04.055
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

05:04.175 --> 05:07.577
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't think that they... I would think most companies would tell you too bad, so sad on the key.

05:07.597 --> 05:08.877
[SPEAKER_05]: They're really on the ball.

05:09.017 --> 05:09.357
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

05:09.438 --> 05:10.178
[SPEAKER_05]: Really on the ball.

05:11.078 --> 05:16.281
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also... We got stuff.

05:16.581 --> 05:18.782
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan came back from the Game Crazy Manager Conference.

05:19.422 --> 05:20.903
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm getting a free Halo 3.

05:21.683 --> 05:24.325
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting a free Heavenly Sword, which I want to play.

05:24.425 --> 05:25.105
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to it.

05:25.469 --> 05:28.010
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a copy of Jeanne d'Arc already, which I'm going to be playing through.

05:29.771 --> 05:31.411
[SPEAKER_05]: He got some other games.

05:31.431 --> 05:32.752
[SPEAKER_05]: We're supposed to be getting Mass Effect.

05:33.532 --> 05:35.493
[SPEAKER_05]: He said that it looked really, really, really sweet.

05:35.773 --> 05:37.054
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm looking forward to that too.

05:38.634 --> 05:44.577
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he got to play Dracula X Collection, and he thought it was really cool.

05:45.317 --> 05:47.478
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually watched a bunch of videos from Tokyo Game Show.

05:47.918 --> 05:51.700
[SPEAKER_05]: Not from Tokyo Game Show, but from Tokyo Game Show I watched the Knights demo.

05:52.640 --> 05:59.524
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was watching the footage from Rondo of Blood and it looked really, really, really good.

05:59.804 --> 06:01.265
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm going to be very impressed with it.

06:02.266 --> 06:04.727
[SPEAKER_05]: And we got a whole bunch of t-shirts that we don't want.

06:05.748 --> 06:07.509
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're getting a Wii Zapper.

06:08.509 --> 06:10.230
[SPEAKER_05]: And he came home with a Wii Sword.

06:10.991 --> 06:12.792
[SPEAKER_02]: So rub it in with all this free shit you're getting.

06:14.278 --> 06:17.260
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking in chat, some folks dissing Heavenly Sword in chat.

06:17.581 --> 06:19.722
[SPEAKER_02]: Fildo... I don't care, I'm playing it anyway.

06:19.883 --> 06:20.743
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that name, by the way.

06:20.783 --> 06:23.245
[SPEAKER_02]: Fildo says, I beat Heavenly Sword in five minutes.

06:23.926 --> 06:25.927
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mycosynth says, Heavenly Sword isn't all that great.

06:26.908 --> 06:28.409
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care, it's free and I'm playing it.

06:29.130 --> 06:29.850
[SPEAKER_02]: It does look pretty.

06:30.631 --> 06:31.271
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty things are good.

06:31.311 --> 06:33.193
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, it's free and I'm playing it.

06:33.213 --> 06:33.593
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

06:34.014 --> 06:34.294
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

06:35.155 --> 06:35.875
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go over to Loki.

06:35.975 --> 06:36.836
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

06:37.576 --> 06:39.138
[SPEAKER_01]: My week was a little busy.

06:40.499 --> 06:40.739
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

06:41.326 --> 06:44.108
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course at work I've been playing more Saints Row multiplayer.

06:44.168 --> 06:46.570
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're doing all Rocket matches, which are pretty fun.

06:48.311 --> 06:53.194
[SPEAKER_01]: Then of course, you know, the big one, I got Halo 3 early, and you're breaking stuff.

06:53.374 --> 06:54.235
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

06:54.775 --> 06:56.677
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually have already finished the game.

06:57.617 --> 06:58.298
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of short.

06:59.058 --> 07:09.766
[SPEAKER_01]: Reminds me of, see now, I never really played, I mean, I played Halo once or twice, and I played Halo 2 maybe once or twice, but never through the entire story mode, so...

07:10.802 --> 07:17.027
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most of the story and the ending and stuff is pretty lost to me as far as the impact, I guess.

07:17.647 --> 07:19.989
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I don't know.

07:20.129 --> 07:20.570
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good.

07:20.870 --> 07:22.872
[SPEAKER_01]: It reminds me a lot of Resistance.

07:23.072 --> 07:25.494
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of parallels between this game and that one.

07:26.134 --> 07:27.575
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't know.

07:28.336 --> 07:28.776
[SPEAKER_01]: How so?

07:30.177 --> 07:31.638
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't want to give away too much.

07:31.718 --> 07:32.699
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know.

07:33.320 --> 07:37.383
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if anyone's actually heard anything about the game, there's a race called The Flood.

07:38.075 --> 07:42.718
[SPEAKER_01]: And they remind me a lot of the race of creatures that you fight in Resistance.

07:45.620 --> 07:46.000
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

07:46.100 --> 07:47.601
[SPEAKER_01]: The game itself is pretty good.

07:47.841 --> 07:48.342
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked it.

07:49.743 --> 07:50.783
[SPEAKER_01]: The multiplayer is pretty fun.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.384
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to play more of that.

07:52.804 --> 07:56.087
[SPEAKER_01]: And then co-op, I really want to give a try to some of that.

07:57.367 --> 07:58.268
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall, it's pretty good.

07:59.008 --> 08:00.389
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely not the best game this year.

08:02.182 --> 08:10.128
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely not the best looking game this year, but I don't think you really need to have the best graphics to make great games, so it should be good.

08:10.228 --> 08:14.451
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that Bungie supports their games pretty well, so I can't wait to see what they do with the rest of it.

08:16.592 --> 08:19.395
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the last game, well actually there's a few others.

08:19.555 --> 08:24.178
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Brain Age 2, I bought that for Nelly, and I don't like that game.

08:24.912 --> 08:26.512
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like that game because... Why?

08:27.453 --> 08:31.073
[SPEAKER_01]: The text recognition and the voice recognition are horrible.

08:31.433 --> 08:32.534
[SPEAKER_01]: They're absolutely horrible.

08:32.614 --> 08:38.635
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, there's a part where you're having to yell out, you know, rock, paper, scissor, and you're playing that, and you either have to win or lose.

08:38.775 --> 08:40.495
[SPEAKER_01]: And it did not understand scissor.

08:40.875 --> 08:46.056
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to, like, go, scissor, scissor, scissor.

08:46.296 --> 08:48.697
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally it's like, oh, okay, you got it.

08:48.857 --> 08:50.197
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it'll just say you got it wrong.

08:50.217 --> 08:51.477
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's another one.

08:51.577 --> 08:54.138
[SPEAKER_01]: It was addition, where you had to, like, insert the...

08:55.805 --> 08:57.506
[SPEAKER_01]: The operative for a math problem.

08:57.606 --> 09:03.109
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I'd draw a plus or something, and it would think it's a multiplication, like an X or something.

09:03.149 --> 09:04.710
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, that does not look like an X at all.

09:05.170 --> 09:17.076
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, there's another one that wanted me to spell out stuff, to like create a word, and I was trying to draw a B. And I mean, it looks like a B, and it thinks I'm drawing like a D or like something else.

09:17.136 --> 09:18.737
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't recognize my handwriting.

09:19.361 --> 09:19.861
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

09:43.360 --> 09:45.141
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it was interesting.

09:45.581 --> 09:47.422
[SPEAKER_01]: There was actually hardly anyone there.

09:47.502 --> 09:52.605
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they had enough stations for about, I would say, 20 people to play at once.

09:53.286 --> 09:56.087
[SPEAKER_01]: They had like five different setups, so it was pretty easy to get in there.

09:57.148 --> 10:03.371
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem I had, and hopefully this is not reflecting the final product, is that guitar, man.

10:03.811 --> 10:05.832
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some issues with that strum bar.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.894
[SPEAKER_01]: It just was not working at all.

10:07.934 --> 10:10.315
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I failed two songs on easy, and I mean...

10:11.488 --> 10:17.550
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not great, you know, I can do the three keys fine, but this thing was not hitting right at all.

10:17.570 --> 10:21.731
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like, well, I don't know if it's the humidity or what, and it wasn't very humid out.

10:22.291 --> 10:25.072
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, there's like barely any humidity in California, people.

10:25.092 --> 10:28.433
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what's the humidity or whatever, but pushing down the strum bar doesn't work.

10:28.453 --> 10:31.434
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta pull up sometimes, because the down will stop working.

10:31.454 --> 10:33.114
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, okay.

10:34.134 --> 10:38.736
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, pulling up worked fine, and we ended up playing Tom Sawyer, and that was okay.

10:39.436 --> 10:39.516
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

10:40.114 --> 10:41.994
[SPEAKER_01]: The game itself looks exactly like Guitar Hero.

10:42.074 --> 10:48.476
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you've seen Guitar Hero and you've seen Karaoke Revolution, it's just those two games combined.

10:49.236 --> 10:50.416
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a big surprise.

10:50.456 --> 10:51.437
[SPEAKER_01]: The drums look kind of neat.

10:51.717 --> 10:57.678
[SPEAKER_01]: The way they had them set up, though, they were very low to the ground, but it worked for whoever was playing drums.

10:57.718 --> 10:59.978
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up playing the bass guitar because that was all that was left.

11:00.919 --> 11:02.659
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do like

11:03.379 --> 11:08.140
[SPEAKER_01]: The buttons on it, they have buttons towards the top and, of course, towards the bottom for, like, I guess, solo stuff.

11:08.240 --> 11:17.282
[SPEAKER_01]: I never really figured out, because you can use the bottom buttons the entire game, and I guess you use them also when you're doing, like, kind of the finale part.

11:19.223 --> 11:21.343
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, there's a little effector thing there.

11:21.363 --> 11:31.746
[SPEAKER_01]: You can switch between, like, five different effects, including, like, chorus, echo, and they have, like, some wah-wah and other stuff that you can do, so it was okay.

11:32.286 --> 11:32.846
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um...

11:33.684 --> 11:34.324
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

11:57.819 --> 11:58.319
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to see.

11:58.459 --> 11:59.500
[SPEAKER_01]: But otherwise, it was fun.

12:00.040 --> 12:00.560
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely fun.

12:00.600 --> 12:11.204
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the whole team kind of aspect to it, because my guitar was giving me shit, and so I failed the first song, and my other teammates kind of got me back into the game.

12:11.304 --> 12:13.444
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same thing happened in reverse the last time.

12:13.464 --> 12:17.066
[SPEAKER_01]: The drummer failed, and then I got him back in there with the bass guitar.

12:17.186 --> 12:18.346
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of cool.

12:19.146 --> 12:20.367
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

12:20.527 --> 12:21.367
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good game, though.

12:21.527 --> 12:23.288
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you expect anything...

12:24.816 --> 12:26.297
[SPEAKER_01]: Really different from Guitar Hero.

12:26.978 --> 12:29.439
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be disappointed, but it'll look good.

12:31.461 --> 12:31.781
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

12:32.021 --> 12:36.364
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you think that Rock Band, now Rock Band got lots of awards at E3 2007.

12:36.404 --> 12:38.966
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that it's worthy of all the praise it's been getting?

12:39.106 --> 12:39.486
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.

12:39.526 --> 12:46.391
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, well, Guitar Hero 3, I don't really think they're doing too much different other than the fact they're going to be catering to more of a hardcore crowds and they're going to

12:47.202 --> 12:47.502
[SPEAKER_01]: Hardcore!

13:13.855 --> 13:21.612
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen to, like, blues music and stuff, eating ribs, and I just happened to go just to play this game, but...

13:22.552 --> 13:23.352
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'll be good.

13:24.613 --> 13:40.518
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is they're going to have a tough time selling it for 200 bucks because from what I hear, and I don't know if this is going to be exactly the case, they're only going to be selling the game by itself and also that special edition which is going to have the guitar, drums, and microphone.

13:40.999 --> 13:43.159
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the only two ways that they're going to have them.

13:44.260 --> 13:49.782
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess in 2008, in January, they're going to start selling the drums and the guitars separately.

13:50.422 --> 13:50.602
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

13:52.213 --> 13:54.935
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

14:14.372 --> 14:26.204
[SPEAKER_01]: on the add-on disc, and it's this little, almost like a flash game, where you have to put grenades underneath a warthog to fling it into the air to destroy aliens.

14:26.224 --> 14:38.276
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me show the game to the Op-11 people again, so you can see what the box, because this is different than the box art I've been seeing online, because most of the reviewers got the regular copy of Halo 3, but you somehow managed one of these little special edition things, so it's pretty neat there.

14:40.103 --> 14:42.167
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to look at webcam feed of our show archived.

14:42.227 --> 14:43.309
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Operate11.com.

14:43.349 --> 14:46.756
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we hold up random things in front of the camera just to show what's going on.

14:47.598 --> 14:47.698
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

14:49.264 --> 14:51.485
[SPEAKER_02]: So I played Halo 3, which was pretty cool.

14:51.525 --> 14:54.507
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I certainly haven't played enough to give an opinion of it.

14:55.127 --> 14:55.948
[SPEAKER_02]: It certainly looked nice.

14:56.688 --> 14:57.188
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say that.

14:57.569 --> 14:58.969
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like the customization.

14:59.290 --> 15:01.271
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the customization in games like that.

15:01.731 --> 15:07.614
[SPEAKER_02]: And all I have to say is I was able to make my emblem a unicorn, and that was awesome, because unicorns are rad.

15:08.054 --> 15:08.675
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

15:11.508 --> 15:12.649
[SPEAKER_02]: More on Halo 3 next week.

15:13.249 --> 15:16.531
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been spending my entire freaking week playing Eternal Sonata.

15:16.631 --> 15:21.813
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran out and bought this game the day it came out because I really enjoyed the demo and I have been loving the game.

15:22.334 --> 15:27.416
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I've been reading some of the reviews online of the game and I honestly think most of the critics have been pretty harsh on this game.

15:27.816 --> 15:34.120
[SPEAKER_02]: I think critics across the board just don't really care for Japanese role-playing games, especially 360, you know, reviewers.

15:34.140 --> 15:37.622
[SPEAKER_02]: Because on the 360, you don't get a lot of games like this.

15:37.762 --> 15:40.263
[SPEAKER_02]: But this, you know, is kind of a throwback to some really...

15:41.349 --> 15:43.610
[SPEAKER_02]: RAD, PlayStation 2 games I can think of in the past.

15:43.990 --> 15:44.570
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

15:44.850 --> 15:48.311
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say if you're a fan of these types of Japanese role-playing games, don't listen to the reviews.

15:48.932 --> 15:49.812
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the game perfect?

15:50.252 --> 15:50.452
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

15:51.132 --> 15:56.174
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of my issues with the game is that the game tends to repeat the monsters over and over again.

15:56.214 --> 15:59.815
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you go into a dungeon, and there's basically only two types of monsters you can fight.

16:00.136 --> 16:02.036
[SPEAKER_02]: There's scorpions, there's other things.

16:02.056 --> 16:03.097
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, flying bugs or something.

16:03.117 --> 16:03.417
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

16:03.817 --> 16:06.338
[SPEAKER_02]: But, so the monsters get a little stale.

16:06.578 --> 16:06.998
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um...

16:07.970 --> 16:09.151
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

16:28.320 --> 16:29.240
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

16:52.213 --> 16:54.674
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, every character has their own stuff.

16:55.035 --> 16:59.317
[SPEAKER_02]: And later on, as you advance, the one cool thing is that the battle system builds and builds.

16:59.697 --> 17:03.559
[SPEAKER_02]: In the beginning, your five seconds only counts down when you're actually doing something.

17:03.859 --> 17:07.101
[SPEAKER_02]: But then later on, you have four seconds that counts down no matter what.

17:07.481 --> 17:08.582
[SPEAKER_02]: But you get perks from that.

17:08.622 --> 17:10.623
[SPEAKER_02]: You get like this echo meter that you build up.

17:10.683 --> 17:13.845
[SPEAKER_02]: So the more attacks you do, the more damage your special attacks do.

17:14.705 --> 17:17.426
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty neat, intricate the way the game works.

17:17.486 --> 17:26.791
[SPEAKER_02]: And the game is beautiful, very colorful, lots of greens, blues, reds, just all these different types of areas, snow areas, fire areas.

17:26.891 --> 17:29.932
[SPEAKER_02]: It just really shows off the graphical capabilities of 360.

17:29.972 --> 17:34.034
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, for one, think the story is pretty awesome.

17:34.334 --> 17:35.895
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's certainly one of the most original games.

17:36.255 --> 17:36.635
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

18:02.428 --> 18:03.389
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

18:22.757 --> 18:28.498
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, for you DDR fans, the song Kakume from DDR Max 2, you remember that song?

18:30.059 --> 18:31.979
[SPEAKER_02]: That's based on a Chopin piece, Revolution.

18:32.539 --> 18:35.300
[SPEAKER_02]: And Revolution is the whole second stage in the game.

18:35.700 --> 18:43.262
[SPEAKER_02]: So you actually hear the original piano piece, and it's showing you all these pictures, kind of telling you about Chopin's life, and what it is is kind of mirroring what's going on in the game.

18:43.682 --> 18:46.682
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just really interesting.

18:46.882 --> 18:49.023
[SPEAKER_02]: Some really long monologues and stuff.

18:49.063 --> 18:49.163
[SPEAKER_02]: It's...

18:51.087 --> 18:52.829
[SPEAKER_02]: A good story, certainly worth checking out.

19:10.643 --> 19:13.044
[SPEAKER_02]: Ghost says, anyway, Eternal Sonata looks beautiful

19:38.393 --> 19:52.963
[SPEAKER_02]: GS68 says fuck corporate reviewers WTF I can only move in two dimensions there's no save points I keep dying and the game can be beaten in under one hour negative 264 out of 10 you know I think the thing about reviews is that

19:53.656 --> 19:54.657
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's different.

19:55.097 --> 19:59.280
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's different and likes different stuff, including the reviewers out there like different stuff.

19:59.841 --> 20:02.883
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just have to kind of find that reviewer that matches your taste.

20:03.003 --> 20:06.806
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe that's me here on the show, or maybe it is somebody that writes for one of the corporate sites.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.208
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also think people are influenced by hype and stuff.

20:09.228 --> 20:16.053
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for example, if I wanted to rate Halo like a 7 or 8 or something like that, people would be jumping all over me.

20:16.073 --> 20:17.034
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be like, what the hell?

20:17.074 --> 20:19.176
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the game of the year, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

20:19.256 --> 20:19.496
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean...

20:20.450 --> 20:21.971
[SPEAKER_02]: Hike does go a long way, that's for sure.

20:42.141 --> 20:43.001
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all you gotta show.

20:43.021 --> 20:47.183
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to show some fucking old guy talking about a plasma rifle or some shit like that.

20:47.624 --> 20:49.925
[SPEAKER_01]: No one knows nor cares what it's for.

20:49.945 --> 20:51.726
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, it's stupid.

20:52.688 --> 20:56.350
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, the story in Eternal Sonata is kind of a real downer.

20:56.710 --> 21:09.395
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you don't really see these types of stories in games, but like, the game, I'm not gonna real spoil anything, because the very first thing you see is one of the characters jumping off a cliff, apparently committing suicide, talking about letting herself, you know, go or whatever.

21:09.835 --> 21:13.277
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, you know, Chopin is dying, and he's actually a character in the game.

21:13.557 --> 21:14.397
[SPEAKER_02]: He's talking about dying.

21:14.677 --> 21:20.280
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, there's another character who's 14 years old who realizes that because she can use magic, she has an incurable illness.

21:20.933 --> 21:21.594
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

21:46.033 --> 21:47.474
[SPEAKER_01]: Good news, you can do magic.

21:47.735 --> 21:48.655
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the bad news?

21:48.976 --> 21:50.177
[SPEAKER_01]: You have brain cancer.

21:51.318 --> 21:52.379
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, that's what it is.

21:52.679 --> 21:56.162
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the interesting thing is they try to make parallels between that character.

21:56.924 --> 22:01.226
[SPEAKER_02]: and Chopin's sister who died as a teenager of tuberculosis.

22:01.586 --> 22:06.929
[SPEAKER_02]: See, there's all these really interesting parallels in it that I think make the story certainly really creative.

22:07.789 --> 22:13.412
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have those cliche RPG moments in it, but it's certainly never seen anything like this before.

22:13.692 --> 22:19.335
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if TB gave you magical powers, maybe people wouldn't be so sad over it, you know?

22:20.915 --> 22:21.876
[SPEAKER_01]: You are so wrong.

22:22.776 --> 22:23.537
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what to tell you.

22:23.557 --> 22:24.938
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some magicians out there.

22:24.958 --> 22:25.939
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish we'd get TV.

22:27.020 --> 22:28.661
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at you, David Copperfield.

22:29.762 --> 22:30.122
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

22:30.222 --> 22:33.305
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, that's really all I've been playing.

22:33.365 --> 22:36.107
[SPEAKER_02]: I checked out that one game that came out on Xbox Live this week.

22:36.147 --> 22:36.407
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?

22:36.447 --> 22:37.228
[SPEAKER_02]: Geass or whatever?

22:37.468 --> 22:37.829
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

22:37.849 --> 22:38.689
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks stupid.

22:38.709 --> 22:40.271
[SPEAKER_02]: What's a Geass system on the Commodore 64?

22:40.331 --> 22:41.472
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Geon Emotions or something.

22:41.532 --> 22:43.133
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that like an English school in Japan?

22:43.393 --> 22:43.734
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

22:44.174 --> 22:45.155
[SPEAKER_01]: Genon Emotions.

22:45.195 --> 22:45.895
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's Genon?

22:46.496 --> 22:47.577
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I was thinking of the Commodore 64.

22:47.617 --> 22:48.037
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Geon.

22:48.097 --> 22:48.998
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to buy it.

22:49.098 --> 22:49.879
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it's called.

22:50.894 --> 22:51.616
[SPEAKER_02]: It was okay.

22:52.017 --> 22:56.507
[SPEAKER_02]: I played it for like 15 minutes and then I was like, I need to go back to Eternal Sonata because I'm...

22:57.358 --> 22:59.459
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not progressing enough in the story.

22:59.840 --> 23:02.601
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where the hell these reviewers are saying this game is too short.

23:03.121 --> 23:07.564
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing for about 16 hours now, and I think I'm maybe at the halfway point.

23:07.704 --> 23:08.645
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be a little past.

23:09.045 --> 23:11.186
[SPEAKER_02]: Like 30 hours is short for an RPG.

23:11.586 --> 23:13.327
[SPEAKER_01]: How long did it take you to beat Halo 3, Loki?

23:14.208 --> 23:17.530
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I got the game on Wednesday, and I finished it today.

23:18.250 --> 23:19.331
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't play that long.

23:19.371 --> 23:22.693
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, maybe I'd say maybe 10 hours at the most.

23:24.014 --> 23:24.354
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

23:24.844 --> 23:30.347
[SPEAKER_02]: And let me put it this way... I mean, I guess, granted, Halo 3 has a shitload of replayability value thanks to the multiplayer mode.

23:30.487 --> 23:37.431
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a lot of stuff you can go back and... Like, I played it on normal difficulty, which I hear is super easy, but, you know, I just wanted to start at normal.

23:37.891 --> 23:47.717
[SPEAKER_01]: Had I realized that you can actually go through, like, Legendary or something like that, and then you'll get the achievements for all the other difficulties, I would have saved myself some time and just played it on the hardest difficulty.

23:48.357 --> 23:49.038
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um...

23:49.730 --> 23:51.311
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what was I going to say?

23:52.092 --> 23:53.192
[SPEAKER_01]: One bit of advice, though.

23:53.532 --> 24:03.579
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you get into a sequence where someone's piloting a vehicle, I highly recommend you kick them out of the driver's seat and you pilot the vehicle because the AI sucks at piloting vehicles.

24:04.479 --> 24:05.440
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely awful.

24:06.360 --> 24:07.500
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, will you be playing Halo 3?

24:34.361 --> 24:36.843
[SPEAKER_05]: If first-person shooters didn't make me puke, then maybe.

24:38.004 --> 24:40.547
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually, even if first-person shooters made me puke, no.

24:42.508 --> 24:43.910
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're too busy with Ragnarok.

24:44.450 --> 24:45.912
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because I'm too busy playing good games.

24:46.672 --> 24:47.413
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, snap.

24:48.434 --> 24:48.774
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

24:50.696 --> 24:51.256
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's it.

24:51.316 --> 24:53.038
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really all I have to say for my gaming week.

24:53.518 --> 24:57.842
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked far too much about those games I've been playing this week.

24:57.882 --> 24:59.504
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get into some housekeeping.

25:00.208 --> 25:01.389
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

25:20.356 --> 25:21.637
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

25:42.918 --> 25:44.539
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook is getting worse than MySpace

26:12.129 --> 26:12.670
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that.

26:12.951 --> 26:15.334
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into some gaming news.

26:15.434 --> 26:16.195
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that.

26:16.796 --> 26:22.144
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this week we had a lot of big announcements, of course, because Tokyo Game Show was going on.

26:23.174 --> 26:49.667
[SPEAKER_01]: um one interesting thing though and will probably be a sigh of relief for a lot of people Super Smash Brothers Brawl has revealed their online plans uh yes there will be friends codes at least it will be online so that's good thank god um there will be options to play against friends or to play against anybody um so I don't know it kind of I guess typical for your normal Nintendo online game um

26:51.724 --> 26:52.805
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, pretty awesome.

26:53.826 --> 26:57.789
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the dojo this week, they put up all these Snake things.

26:57.849 --> 27:03.194
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they finally, you know, I guess, what do you want to say, officially unveiled Snake as a character on the dojo.

27:03.254 --> 27:06.197
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, thanks to E3 last year, we already knew it was coming.

27:06.617 --> 27:09.840
[SPEAKER_02]: But they actually officially, you know, rolled out his profile and everything on the site.

27:10.060 --> 27:12.142
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a pretty awesome picture of him.

27:13.022 --> 27:18.087
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a homoerotic pose with him and Ike coming up behind him and doing the whole, like, I'm going to snap your neck type thing.

27:18.587 --> 27:19.408
[SPEAKER_02]: Or who knows what.

27:21.322 --> 27:29.006
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that one game that I had, and I cannot remember the name for the life of me, that had a bunch of Hudson characters and Hasbro characters in it and stuff?

27:29.166 --> 27:31.568
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember Snake was in there.

27:32.108 --> 27:33.849
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't that the one where you could be Optimus Prime?

27:33.889 --> 27:36.010
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you could do Optimus Prime versus Barbie.

27:36.050 --> 27:37.611
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how awesome is that?

27:37.631 --> 27:39.232
[SPEAKER_02]: That was on the DS, right?

27:39.272 --> 27:41.093
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you could play as Bomberman.

27:41.333 --> 27:41.954
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it wasn't DS.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.194
[SPEAKER_01]: It was on the PlayStation 2.

27:43.234 --> 27:45.736
[SPEAKER_01]: They had Bomberman, Snake...

27:46.364 --> 27:47.825
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually had Simon Belmont.

27:48.685 --> 27:51.086
[SPEAKER_01]: You could play as Barbie.

27:51.586 --> 27:53.947
[SPEAKER_01]: There was Optimus Prime.

27:54.087 --> 27:57.688
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Tetsuya and Rob D are yelling, Dream Mix, TV World Fighters.

27:57.708 --> 27:58.388
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's it.

27:58.488 --> 27:59.829
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's awesome.

28:00.129 --> 28:04.891
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, really they could have just ripped Snake from there and just used all of his moves.

28:04.911 --> 28:07.732
[SPEAKER_01]: Because from what I've seen on Super Smash Bros.

28:07.792 --> 28:09.532
[SPEAKER_01]: already, it's kind of similar anyway.

28:09.712 --> 28:11.553
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't know.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.020
[SPEAKER_01]: Optimus Prime vs. Barbie

28:40.410 --> 28:59.880
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyhow, I also wanted to say about this though, what do you think about the whole fact that when you play online against strangers, you don't get to see their names, you don't get to have the little chat bubbles, nothing, it's just a straight up, it's almost like playing against the computer, except the computer is actually being controlled by someone real you don't know.

29:00.640 --> 29:02.201
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't save stats, it doesn't do anything.

29:02.521 --> 29:05.643
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in my mind, I'm kind of like, well, then why do they even bother?

29:06.343 --> 29:09.265
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can't track who you're playing, you can't,

29:09.950 --> 29:13.271
[SPEAKER_02]: If you liked playing with them, you can't play with them again later.

29:13.391 --> 29:14.372
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's, like, none of that.

29:15.412 --> 29:18.053
[SPEAKER_02]: But I suppose this is just more bitching about Nintendo's online mode.

29:18.093 --> 29:21.274
[SPEAKER_01]: All I gotta say is their online needs a major overhaul.

29:21.494 --> 29:27.336
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean... I heard rumors that there's supposed to be some major update coming this month.

29:27.956 --> 29:32.778
[SPEAKER_01]: And with, you know, next week being the last week of the month, I don't think that's gonna happen, so...

29:34.827 --> 29:36.948
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like what they're doing with the friend stuff.

29:36.988 --> 29:44.573
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a friend added, how you can do, in lieu of voice chat, since they don't have that, you can do the little speech bubbles and things.

29:44.813 --> 29:46.214
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of neat, I guess.

29:47.655 --> 29:50.297
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the reason the DS Online thing works...

29:51.017 --> 29:57.361
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how you guys do it, but the way I play DS online is that I'll be chatting with someone on AOL, and they'll be like, hey, want to play something on DS?

29:57.401 --> 29:57.922
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, okay.

29:58.242 --> 30:05.547
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then I'll play the game, and then as soon as the game opens, I can go right over and chat with them, like, haha, I kicked your ass, or boy, you own me, or whatever.

30:05.567 --> 30:07.888
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't do that on the Wii now, unless I have a laptop.

30:07.908 --> 30:12.351
[SPEAKER_01]: But even the DS has more features in their online games than...

30:14.504 --> 30:19.046
[SPEAKER_01]: The Wii doesn't have that.

30:19.466 --> 30:22.427
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, there's more technology in the Wii than there is in the DS.

30:22.527 --> 30:25.209
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't they implement the stuff that's already implemented in other things?

30:25.529 --> 30:29.191
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the DS can handle voice chat, why can't the fucking Wii handle it?

30:30.331 --> 30:37.434
[SPEAKER_02]: TheRobD in our chat says, Honestly, Sky, Wii Fighter fans get so few bones thrown to us in terms of online play that I, for one, don't even care.

30:37.955 --> 30:40.696
[SPEAKER_02]: Online play on a fighter is enough for me right now.

30:41.856 --> 30:44.179
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob D says, when I play on DS, we chat on Skype, too.

30:44.439 --> 30:44.839
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll work.

30:45.580 --> 30:48.323
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I guess, in a way, you have a point.

30:49.043 --> 30:53.428
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better than nothing, and I think that's a lot of the reaction people are having to this news.

30:53.448 --> 30:54.589
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that's kind of what I said.

30:54.629 --> 30:59.834
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, okay, at least it's a step in the right direction, and it's better than not being online at all, like Metroid Prime 3.

30:59.874 --> 30:59.994
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

31:02.188 --> 31:12.793
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, you look at the mainframe and everything the Xbox Live has to offer, and you kind of go, geez, Nintendo really feels like a little bit behind in these realms of online play.

31:13.193 --> 31:20.096
[SPEAKER_02]: But I suppose with their whole, you know, we're not making games for the hardcore gamers all the time type thing, maybe they can get away with that.

31:20.476 --> 31:21.196
[SPEAKER_02]: And they probably can.

31:22.037 --> 31:23.898
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what have you?

31:24.258 --> 31:27.119
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you have some further comments on this, you can always send us an email.

31:27.239 --> 31:29.840
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to go.

31:30.881 --> 31:31.401
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile...

31:32.546 --> 31:38.308
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some news for you guys, and it has to do with Star Wars The Force Unleashed.

31:38.809 --> 31:52.614
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a new game coming out on the Nintendo Wii, and a lot of folks are very excited that they're finally getting a Star Wars game because, of course, Star Wars game equals, ooh, we're going to have big lightsaber battles finally on the Wii.

31:52.654 --> 31:54.275
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, what the Wii was made for.

31:54.835 --> 32:01.378
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, according to a recent episode of the 1UP podcast, thanks to my Twitter friends for pointing this out to me, may not be so.

32:02.561 --> 32:11.525
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like the game may actually not feature that kind of support for... I would say, because I thought this was coming out on, like, 360 and PlayStation 3 as well.

32:11.605 --> 32:12.465
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's probably on.

32:13.046 --> 32:21.609
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just going to be kind of like, you know, Knights of the Old Republic or something like that, you know, but a little bit more physics and stuff.

32:21.850 --> 32:23.010
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's going to look pretty.

32:23.790 --> 32:31.774
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not like a true, you know, like playing the Star Wars arcade game, you know, the new arcade game where they had, you know, the actual lightsaber and stuff that you can...

32:33.392 --> 32:35.333
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose there will be more to come on this.

32:35.433 --> 32:39.477
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I'll leave you with this official quote from the president of LucasArts, Jim Ward.

32:52.068 --> 32:58.754
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm, but if you, I mean, I don't know, I don't know to what validity the other podcast information is, but if it's not that way, that's gonna be a bummer.

32:58.814 --> 33:11.985
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll probably have, like, limited stuff where you'll swing it around to, like, do different things, but it'll also be, like, if you're gonna be using the Force, like, if you push the remote and uncheck out, it'll be, like, doing the Force push or, you know, stuff like that.

33:12.125 --> 33:14.247
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very limited.

33:16.008 --> 33:16.649
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well...

33:17.802 --> 33:21.643
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll still check it out, and hopefully you do get to do some Wii lightsaber.

33:21.663 --> 33:26.805
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, just because it doesn't have the lightsaber doesn't necessarily mean it'll be a bad game.

33:26.845 --> 33:30.866
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a lot of people seem to enjoy the LEGO Star Wars thing, which had really nothing to do with motion controls.

33:32.047 --> 33:39.089
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still a lot of good games to be cranked out of the Star Wars franchise, and I'm sure they'll try for years and years and years to come.

33:39.489 --> 33:39.709
[SPEAKER_05]: Well...

33:41.030 --> 33:45.120
[SPEAKER_05]: I've made a mention of this earlier that I'm going to be getting with myself.

33:45.240 --> 33:48.688
[SPEAKER_05]: They've confirmed that the Wii Zapper is going to be out in Europe this year.

33:49.192 --> 33:49.432
[SPEAKER_05]: Ghost Squad

34:12.605 --> 34:14.365
[SPEAKER_05]: and Resident Evil The Umbrella Chronicles.

34:14.846 --> 34:15.826
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll use the zapper.

34:16.206 --> 34:19.867
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan was saying at their conference that they weren't calling it a light gun.

34:20.707 --> 34:24.027
[SPEAKER_05]: They were calling it a pointing system.

34:24.788 --> 34:25.608
[SPEAKER_05]: A pointer system.

34:25.788 --> 34:26.588
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was funny.

34:27.228 --> 34:27.668
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

34:28.288 --> 34:37.030
[SPEAKER_05]: Also sort of related too is that he did see the new GunCon that looks like the GunCon 2 and has a trigger switch.

34:37.250 --> 34:37.990
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for Time Crisis?

34:38.090 --> 34:38.290
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

34:38.690 --> 34:41.191
[SPEAKER_05]: And has a trigger switch on the side for a directional button.

34:42.842 --> 34:45.607
[SPEAKER_02]: MrDebucket in chat says, it's not a gun, it's a blaster.

34:46.489 --> 34:46.970
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a pointer.

34:47.879 --> 34:49.320
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but it ain't a bazooka.

34:49.800 --> 34:52.042
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing is still as awesome as the Saturn Enforcer.

34:52.262 --> 34:53.763
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the Super Scope 6, honestly.

34:53.803 --> 34:54.904
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was a fucking bazooka.

34:54.944 --> 34:56.005
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't get any cooler than that.

34:56.285 --> 34:56.765
[SPEAKER_02]: You really can't.

34:56.885 --> 34:59.067
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you, man, that thing is so useless.

34:59.167 --> 35:00.247
[SPEAKER_05]: The Menacer, Rob.

35:00.268 --> 35:00.828
[SPEAKER_05]: The Menacer.

35:01.128 --> 35:01.989
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the Activator.

35:02.109 --> 35:02.229
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

35:02.449 --> 35:03.710
[SPEAKER_05]: I have an Activator.

35:03.850 --> 35:04.290
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

35:05.291 --> 35:06.492
[SPEAKER_05]: I got it for nine bucks.

35:06.532 --> 35:08.413
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when Loki bought an Activator.

35:08.713 --> 35:10.114
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the hell did you buy an Activator?

35:10.134 --> 35:12.096
[SPEAKER_02]: You bought, like, an Activator on eBay for something.

35:12.116 --> 35:12.556
[SPEAKER_02]: It was for your...

35:13.788 --> 35:14.509
[SPEAKER_02]: for the cabinet.

35:14.529 --> 35:16.431
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to do the Parapara thing.

35:16.511 --> 35:18.633
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to build a Parapara setup for the cabinet.

35:18.653 --> 35:23.698
[SPEAKER_01]: This was back when I was going to build one control panel for every single Bomani game.

35:23.758 --> 35:25.179
[SPEAKER_02]: And back when Parapara was cool.

35:25.860 --> 35:29.523
[SPEAKER_01]: Parapara was so cool.

35:29.563 --> 35:33.687
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up throwing the Activator stuff away because I got it for like $10.

35:35.389 --> 35:37.591
[SPEAKER_01]: I did, however, and I still have them,

35:38.140 --> 35:44.803
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the Dream Parapara controller, which does hook up to the PC via a converter.

35:45.063 --> 35:47.324
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if I really want to.

35:47.364 --> 35:50.486
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember we played the Dream Parapara on the Dreamcast.

35:50.506 --> 35:53.647
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exactly the same as Parapara, except it has really crappy songs.

35:55.708 --> 35:56.929
[SPEAKER_02]: Son of Dad asks a good question.

35:56.949 --> 35:59.710
[SPEAKER_02]: Can Silent Hill Arcade be ported to the Wii with the Zapper?

36:00.251 --> 36:00.691
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope so.

36:00.831 --> 36:01.331
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be fun.

36:02.011 --> 36:03.192
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you want to shoot Pyramid Head?

36:04.373 --> 36:04.593
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

36:04.673 --> 36:05.133
[SPEAKER_02]: With hearts?

36:05.153 --> 36:05.213
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

36:06.593 --> 36:07.874
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

36:32.194 --> 36:32.514
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't.

36:32.934 --> 36:34.895
[SPEAKER_02]: I never saw the second movie because I knew it would suck.

36:34.915 --> 36:35.695
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked the second one.

36:35.755 --> 36:36.075
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you?

36:36.235 --> 36:36.715
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I did.

36:36.835 --> 36:38.396
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently the third one isn't bad.

36:38.416 --> 36:40.136
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better than the second one is what people are saying.

36:40.176 --> 36:42.137
[SPEAKER_05]: The second one had all the crap I wanted to see.

36:42.377 --> 36:42.617
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

36:42.637 --> 36:44.618
[SPEAKER_05]: Being stuck in a city full of zombies.

36:44.678 --> 36:46.498
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, hey, that was fantastic.

36:46.778 --> 36:48.939
[SPEAKER_02]: But the movie was number one at the box office this weekend.

36:49.059 --> 36:50.220
[SPEAKER_02]: It beat the Dane Cook movie.

36:50.680 --> 36:51.260
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jessica Alba.

36:51.280 --> 36:51.740
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dane Cook movie?

36:52.140 --> 36:54.501
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but Dane Cook sucks.

36:54.821 --> 37:00.183
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the movie has a 3% on Rotten Tomatoes, and Resident Evil at least has like 10%, I want to say.

37:00.223 --> 37:01.764
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let's go see it this weekend, Rob.

37:02.884 --> 37:03.905
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I want to.

37:04.165 --> 37:04.785
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

37:05.645 --> 37:06.125
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll pay.

37:06.285 --> 37:06.906
[SPEAKER_01]: They're serious?

37:06.966 --> 37:07.266
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

37:07.446 --> 37:08.086
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get there.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.206
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, if you'll pay.

37:09.527 --> 37:13.368
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to do something better, Transformers just came into the IMAX.

37:14.088 --> 37:15.349
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh.

37:15.869 --> 37:18.450
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen 10 to 20 minutes of extra footage in there.

37:18.550 --> 37:19.150
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go, Rob.

37:20.011 --> 37:21.031
[SPEAKER_02]: That I might have to go see.

37:21.616 --> 37:22.237
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen that yet.

37:22.377 --> 37:23.798
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not paying for IMAX.

37:24.038 --> 37:25.399
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll pay for IMAX though.

37:25.419 --> 37:25.940
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be fun.

37:27.741 --> 37:36.128
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I was going to say, once again, commenting on the Wii Zapper, completely useless piece of shit, and you guys will all buy it because it has Zelda crossbow training.

37:36.228 --> 37:37.769
[SPEAKER_01]: You fucking sheep.

37:39.321 --> 37:52.165
[SPEAKER_01]: and we will prove on this show that that piece of shit actually hinders your playing versus helping you and that it is a complete useless pile of junk.

37:52.305 --> 37:56.046
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I think we should use Zelda's crossbow training as the game.

37:57.407 --> 38:00.988
[SPEAKER_02]: For those that forget, Loki and I made a bet about 10 weeks ago on the show.

38:01.348 --> 38:03.469
[SPEAKER_02]: We made a bet when the Wii Zapper was first announced.

38:03.509 --> 38:04.029
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki said...

38:04.529 --> 38:05.249
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

38:29.298 --> 38:33.100
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

38:59.226 --> 38:59.767
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

39:00.007 --> 39:00.568
[SPEAKER_02]: Be good times.

39:00.588 --> 39:01.308
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

39:01.809 --> 39:02.169
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

39:02.189 --> 39:02.450
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

39:03.150 --> 39:04.892
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's travel the globe and look at some release dates.

39:04.952 --> 39:06.314
[SPEAKER_02]: Things that are coming out very soon.

39:06.654 --> 39:06.895
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

39:07.555 --> 39:12.080
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting in the U.S., this is a big week, of course, with Halo 3 coming out on the 360.

39:13.282 --> 39:15.124
[SPEAKER_01]: All three versions on Tuesday.

39:16.365 --> 39:19.869
[SPEAKER_01]: Better start lining up on Monday because everybody else is going to

39:21.030 --> 39:21.391
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

39:21.411 --> 39:22.371
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, why?

39:22.912 --> 39:25.213
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you need to line up that?

39:25.514 --> 39:27.095
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't you just go after work or school on Tuesday?

39:27.115 --> 39:29.176
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can be the first people in the world to play it.

39:29.216 --> 39:29.717
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what?

39:29.737 --> 39:30.357
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not.

39:30.798 --> 39:33.920
[SPEAKER_02]: Like three people on my friends list have already been playing it and we had it.

39:34.000 --> 39:34.380
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

39:34.620 --> 39:35.821
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not the first in the world.

39:35.881 --> 39:37.803
[SPEAKER_02]: So just wait for Tuesday.

39:37.963 --> 39:40.204
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you really have to get it at midnight?

39:40.525 --> 39:41.065
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want.

39:41.245 --> 39:46.409
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know how many people in our chat room are planning to run out at midnight tomorrow and buy the game and if so, why?

39:47.109 --> 39:47.750
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to know.

39:49.271 --> 39:49.451
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

39:50.154 --> 39:50.374
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

39:50.735 --> 39:52.698
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, other games coming out this week.

[SPEAKER_01]: Jackass the game on PlayStation 2 and PSP.

39:58.285 --> 39:59.247
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to buy this game.

39:59.507 --> 39:59.988
[SPEAKER_01]: It just looks...

40:01.034 --> 40:01.814
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too much fun.

40:01.834 --> 40:04.655
[SPEAKER_01]: I would... Well, you don't gotta buy the game.

40:04.715 --> 40:07.156

40:25.556 --> 40:31.067

40:54.136 --> 40:55.798
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw the website for that.

40:56.498 --> 41:01.162
[SPEAKER_05]: It's by the people who did... Crap, now I can't think of it.

41:01.382 --> 41:02.804
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a tactics game, though.

41:03.304 --> 41:03.885
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, yeah.

42:11.303 --> 42:17.648
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the DS, we've got Math Play, which I'm sure is fun, and it has to do with math.

42:24.353 --> 42:24.973

[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, SSJ100Matt says, Ask the people who lined up for the new Harry Potter book.

42:51.597 --> 42:52.998
[SPEAKER_02]: Every place imaginable sold it.

42:53.078 --> 42:53.679
[SPEAKER_02]: Why line up?

42:54.798 --> 42:57.540
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob D says, I'd go if the crowds weren't all frat boys and racist 12-year-olds.

42:57.560 --> 43:02.382
[SPEAKER_02]: I love what an employee of an unnamed store told a friend of mine and Dan's.

43:02.502 --> 43:03.343
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

43:19.324 --> 43:24.928
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to call you and tell you that your reservation for Halo 3 is here, but you don't have to come at midnight if you don't want to.

43:25.349 --> 43:26.610
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be there the next day.

43:30.753 --> 43:31.833
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, best ever.

43:32.314 --> 43:40.500
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to comment, chat.orangeloungeradio.com and you can say such things like DJ Morpheus says, Rob is the Chris Crocker of internet radio.

43:40.780 --> 43:41.180
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

43:41.220 --> 43:41.861
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that guy.

43:42.461 --> 43:43.002
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

43:45.236 --> 43:47.857
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy sucks.

43:47.937 --> 43:50.839

[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

44:47.544 --> 44:48.264
[SPEAKER_05]: Stranglehold.

44:48.344 --> 44:49.665
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, like the GameX, Rob.

45:02.032 --> 45:02.573
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

45:02.913 --> 45:03.153
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

45:03.877 --> 45:04.818
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

45:26.349 --> 45:30.452
[SPEAKER_02]: The little cover art for the game cracked me up, so Bass Fishing on the Wii is coming out.

45:30.932 --> 45:33.253
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think if it comes to America it'll have that box art.

45:33.814 --> 45:36.836
[SPEAKER_02]: My Sims is coming out on the Wii in Japan, the Japanese version.

45:36.916 --> 45:40.658
[SPEAKER_02]: Boku no, sorry, Boku to Sim no Machi is what it's called over there.

45:41.138 --> 45:48.663
[SPEAKER_02]: On the PlayStation 3, The Elder Scrolls Oblivion finally comes out to the PlayStation 3 on September 27th, along with

45:49.501 --> 45:51.283
[SPEAKER_02]: Agarest Senki is coming out.

45:51.544 --> 45:55.007
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a compile game from them, and that's coming out on the PlayStation 3.

45:55.327 --> 45:57.850
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks to be a little strategy-based game.

45:58.271 --> 46:01.394
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of looks like it has some RPG elements to me.

46:01.934 --> 46:04.357
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that battle kind of looks like an Eternal Sonata battle.

46:05.991 --> 46:07.032
[SPEAKER_02]: A little tactical there in nature.

46:07.912 --> 46:12.033
[SPEAKER_02]: Phantasy Star Universe Ambition of the Illuminous comes out on the PlayStation 2.

46:12.674 --> 46:16.335
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I first read this, I thought it said Phantasy Star Universe Abortion of the Illuminous.

46:16.375 --> 46:18.016
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, that's got to be a controversial game.

46:18.496 --> 46:19.276
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's Ambition.

46:20.977 --> 46:22.797
[SPEAKER_02]: We may be calling that once it comes out.

46:23.017 --> 46:29.020
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people called Phantasy Star Universe an abortion of a game, but it's not that bad.

46:29.080 --> 46:29.940
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think it was that bad.

46:31.085 --> 46:38.047
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 2, Bleach, Blade Battle Seconds coming out on the PlayStation 2 because you can't have enough bleach.

46:38.807 --> 46:41.528
[SPEAKER_02]: A game is coming out on the DS and this could be useful.

46:41.588 --> 46:43.008
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Bartender DS.

46:43.648 --> 46:45.729
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a game that teaches you how to mix drinks.

46:46.569 --> 46:47.269
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.

46:47.289 --> 46:48.770
[SPEAKER_02]: That could actually come in pretty handy.

46:49.570 --> 46:52.251
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that is making usefulness out of the DS.

46:52.331 --> 46:52.771
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.

46:53.011 --> 46:53.711
[SPEAKER_02]: Props to those guys.

46:54.538 --> 46:58.821
[SPEAKER_02]: Namco Bandai is putting out another Tamagotchi game in Japan on the 27th for the DS.

46:59.121 --> 47:03.643
[SPEAKER_02]: Tamagotchi no Puchi Puchi Omiseki Mina San Q is coming out.

47:04.884 --> 47:06.305
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a strategy Tamagotchi game.

47:06.625 --> 47:09.446
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the PSP, Yu-Gi-Oh!

47:09.527 --> 47:11.468
[SPEAKER_02]: Dual Monsters GX Tag Force 2.

47:12.348 --> 47:14.890
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you just can't get enough Yu-Gi-Oh!

47:15.630 --> 47:16.230
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you, Jamie?

47:16.611 --> 47:17.451
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you love Yu-Gi-Oh?

47:18.351 --> 47:19.112
[SPEAKER_05]: Not in English.

47:21.454 --> 47:22.275
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

47:41.565 --> 47:42.526
[SPEAKER_01]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

48:11.954 --> 48:15.721
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that being said, the DualShock 3 is official.

48:16.423 --> 48:23.396
[SPEAKER_01]: It will feature the same wonderful technology that was in the DualShock 2, as well as now you get the tilt stuff.

48:24.356 --> 48:52.807
[SPEAKER_01]: it's coming out in Japan in November the rest of the world in spring of 2008 there will be some interesting features for it including I believe they're going to be some of the newer games are going to be supporting it also some of the older games that have already come out will be able to support Rumble as well through a patch system that they're going to implement so Resistance and I think Ratchet and Clank is going to support it stuff like that so

48:53.655 --> 49:01.001
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool, you know, with them saying that, you know, Rumble is last-gen stuff, that you don't need it.

49:01.441 --> 49:03.082
[SPEAKER_01]: Boy, they sure know how to backpedal.

49:03.222 --> 49:05.984
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the entire chatroom is bursting out in unison.

49:06.025 --> 49:13.730
[SPEAKER_02]: GS68 says, STFU, Sony Rumble is so last-gen, and DarkTetsuya says, but Rumble is so last-gen, I roll.

49:14.511 --> 49:19.595
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what do you think finally caused them to release this controller that we all knew was coming six months ago?

49:20.339 --> 49:22.240
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole immersion thing is what it is.

49:22.580 --> 49:24.261
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because they finally settled with them.

49:24.321 --> 49:27.063
[SPEAKER_01]: They're saying, oh no, we planned on doing stuff like this.

49:27.403 --> 49:29.364
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys wanted it, so we made it happen.

49:29.384 --> 49:30.725
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just spin.

49:30.785 --> 49:33.066
[SPEAKER_01]: All it is is that they were going to have it originally.

49:33.086 --> 49:38.249
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, why else would the controller shells have room for, I don't know, rumble motors?

49:38.629 --> 49:42.872
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm, that's kind of odd, seeing as they never planned on having them there in the first place.

49:43.052 --> 49:49.015
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wait, yes they did, but then they found out a company got pissed at them for stealing their technology, so...

49:50.717 --> 49:51.878
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

50:09.392 --> 50:15.834
[SPEAKER_01]: can detect that, you know, the controller shaking is not actually you tilting it in a different direction.

50:15.894 --> 50:21.355
[SPEAKER_02]: What we've done is we've actually taken a race of little gnome people and put them inside the controller.

50:21.996 --> 50:29.918
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're speedily calculating all these different algorithms, making the Six Axis and Rumble technology work together in perfect harmony.

50:30.198 --> 50:33.579
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's so amazing, because no other systems have been able to do that yet.

50:33.699 --> 50:35.239
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wait, no, I take that back.

50:35.279 --> 50:37.340
[SPEAKER_01]: The Wii has one that works just like that.

50:37.970 --> 50:40.372
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Wii is also powered by little gnome people.

50:40.652 --> 50:42.033
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they're so hard to get.

50:43.274 --> 50:46.417
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the gnome women are having to crank out babies left and right to make this.

50:46.437 --> 50:48.078
[SPEAKER_03]: The gnome people are going to go on strike.

50:49.459 --> 50:51.380
[SPEAKER_03]: No, hell no, we won't rumble.

50:52.141 --> 50:55.964
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, please, Nintendo and Sony, think of David the Gnome.

50:56.750 --> 51:03.133
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo Maniac 64 says in our chatroom, Loki, so that means that Metal Gear Solid 4 and Final Fantasy XIII will actually be on the 360.

51:03.173 --> 51:04.493
[SPEAKER_02]: They are rumors.

51:05.594 --> 51:05.754
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

51:05.774 --> 51:07.435
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XIII.

51:07.455 --> 51:08.795
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I'm taking a future story.

51:08.835 --> 51:09.295
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry if I am.

51:09.575 --> 51:10.096
[SPEAKER_02]: But Final Fantasy XIII.

51:11.870 --> 51:17.754
[SPEAKER_02]: They definitively said at the end of the trailer, PlayStation 3 only, when they showed it at Tokyo Game Show this week.

51:17.994 --> 51:21.056
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what they did show on there is 2020.

51:21.517 --> 51:24.359
[SPEAKER_05]: You can come play at my house, Rob.

51:24.499 --> 51:26.660
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XIII in 2013.

51:27.261 --> 51:31.904
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole... Yeah, and it'll come out on 1.13 or something, I don't know.

51:32.684 --> 51:33.025
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget it.

51:34.245 --> 51:34.586
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

51:34.806 --> 51:35.186
[SPEAKER_05]: Forget what?

51:35.206 --> 51:36.107
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

51:36.127 --> 51:36.447
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

51:37.513 --> 51:38.413
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

51:54.878 --> 51:55.298
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

52:14.887 --> 52:17.368
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I mean, that doesn't seem like a real big deal to me.

52:17.728 --> 52:25.470
[SPEAKER_02]: But multiple PSP systems in the future will be able to connect as a hub, and they're wanting to continue this and use this more often.

52:25.930 --> 52:27.070
[SPEAKER_02]: So, pretty cool.

52:27.811 --> 52:28.511
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this idea.

52:29.251 --> 52:32.452
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for the fact that, you know, you have to have a lot of friends with PSPs for it to work.

52:33.172 --> 52:35.433
[SPEAKER_01]: In case you want to have three rear-view mirrors.

52:37.113 --> 52:38.234
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you need side mirrors.

52:38.934 --> 52:39.594
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, awesome.

52:39.994 --> 52:42.075
[SPEAKER_01]: That must be a reason why they're buying their system.

52:42.235 --> 52:42.715
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

52:42.735 --> 52:43.475
[SPEAKER_01]: Rear-view mirror.

52:44.193 --> 52:47.856
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you have to have a certain firmware for that to work?

53:08.388 --> 53:09.049
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about it.

53:09.069 --> 53:09.650
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be running 3.7.

53:09.710 --> 53:11.232
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I want to do a story.

53:11.312 --> 53:12.815
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, sounds good.

53:13.035 --> 53:13.395
[SPEAKER_02]: You may.

53:13.936 --> 53:22.128
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, recent reports, thanks to Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII, shows that the PSP sales have surged in Japan.

53:24.026 --> 53:24.427
[SPEAKER_05]: PSP 95,487 Units

53:41.631 --> 53:43.113
[SPEAKER_05]: DS-79,974, Wii-26,181, PS2-13,128, PS3-13,128, Xbox 360-1,243, Game Boy Advance-836 GameCubes at 97 units

54:01.704 --> 54:10.067
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not surprising that they've sold so well because Crisis Core would only run on the PSP Slim, so if you wanted to play it, you had to buy one.

54:10.447 --> 54:11.367
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Sony!

54:11.887 --> 54:12.308
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

54:12.688 --> 54:13.888
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, it won't run on an old PSP?

54:13.928 --> 54:14.508
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it won't.

54:14.548 --> 54:14.808
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

54:15.369 --> 54:17.789
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's using the full clock.

54:17.809 --> 54:18.670
[SPEAKER_05]: Crisis Core?

54:19.090 --> 54:19.310
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

54:19.430 --> 54:19.770
[SPEAKER_05]: It will.

54:19.950 --> 54:21.791
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen side-by-side comparisons of the game.

54:22.251 --> 54:22.451
[SPEAKER_01]: Aha!

54:22.970 --> 54:27.174
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a video file out showing how Crisis Core runs on an old PSP and a new one.

54:27.194 --> 54:27.775
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, I've seen that.

54:27.795 --> 54:28.896
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought they said that it wouldn't.

54:29.276 --> 54:39.826
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a higher loading time, and although I thought it was funny that when they showed the demo battles, both battles finished at the same time, even though the PSP one loaded later.

54:40.166 --> 54:45.591
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I thought they needed the... Well, you thought wrong!

54:45.612 --> 54:47.593
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is what I read, okay?

54:47.673 --> 54:48.114
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

54:49.184 --> 55:00.207
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, side-by-side comparison showed, but the thing that was good about that comparison is that it did show the better processing power in the new PSPs.

55:00.307 --> 55:18.353
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, just another comparison for software releases in relation to those hardware releases is that Crisis Core, of course, was the top seller, followed by Pokemon Fushigino Dungeon, Tokino, uh, uh, Tankentai, and also the, uh,

55:19.167 --> 55:34.491
[SPEAKER_05]: Yami no Tanken Tai, um, followed by that, Fate, Tiger Coliseum, Another Centuries, Episode 3, The Final, Taiko no Satsujin DS, Mario Party 8, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, Ring of Fates, Sengoku Musou 2 Mushouden, and My Housekeeping Diary.

55:35.051 --> 55:35.291
So.

55:36.951 --> 55:37.391
[SPEAKER_05]: That was number 10.

55:37.611 --> 55:38.812
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the women had to buy something.

55:38.832 --> 55:39.232
[SPEAKER_05]: For sales.

55:40.092 --> 55:41.212
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they're not buying Pokemon.

55:42.673 --> 55:43.793
[SPEAKER_05]: I want Crisis Core, though.

55:43.853 --> 55:45.813
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize to all our female listeners this week.

55:45.853 --> 55:47.394
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to apologize to me, Rob.

55:47.454 --> 55:48.014
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, you know.

55:48.789 --> 55:51.530
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to beg my forgiveness.

55:51.771 --> 55:56.573
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear DarkSakura the Great and Terrible, I beg upon ye for forgiveness.

55:57.193 --> 56:04.557
[SPEAKER_01]: Buying Crisis Core, you know, would only encourage them to make games like Dirge of Service, so... I like Dirge of Service.

56:04.737 --> 56:07.399
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides, I can't really play Crisis Core right now, it's all in Japanese.

56:07.599 --> 56:08.359
[SPEAKER_05]: Vincent's awesome.

56:09.160 --> 56:11.141
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes out in the US, we'll see.

56:11.261 --> 56:12.381
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mind playing it in Japanese.

56:13.922 --> 56:14.783
[SPEAKER_01]: Next story, please.

56:16.724 --> 56:17.064
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways...

56:18.374 --> 56:22.575
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's another game that's also going to be coming out pretty soon in Japan.

56:23.275 --> 56:25.696
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know that game that we thought was free before?

56:26.096 --> 56:28.296
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, but never fear.

56:28.456 --> 56:30.937
[SPEAKER_01]: Sony's here to take a shit on you.

56:31.917 --> 56:39.038
[SPEAKER_01]: Gran Turismo 5 Prologue has been priced in Japan for 49.80 yen.

56:39.798 --> 56:46.480
[SPEAKER_01]: And also it will be coming out on Blu-ray as well for a total savings of about 5 bucks for 4,500 yen.

56:48.606 --> 56:53.929
[SPEAKER_01]: for the download, or I'm sorry, $49.80 was the Blu-ray version, $4,500 was the download.

56:54.390 --> 56:58.712
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, you save $5 downloading it straight to your PS3.

57:00.593 --> 57:12.940
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I know it's supposed to come with, I think, about 40 cars, and looks pretty nice, but, I mean, after all, you are buying pretty much a partial game, I guess, because it's technically kind of like a demo.

57:13.821 --> 57:14.461
[SPEAKER_01]: So, $40 for...

57:16.457 --> 57:20.940
[SPEAKER_01]: A partially finished game when you can wait probably a year and play the full game for $60.

57:21.080 --> 57:25.604
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, do people like Gran Turismo 5 that much?

57:26.464 --> 57:30.507
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're interested, it's coming out December 13th in Japan.

57:31.268 --> 57:33.509
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you have a Japanese account, you can probably download it over here.

57:35.471 --> 57:36.992
[SPEAKER_02]: But not that you do that, because that's wrong.

57:37.292 --> 57:38.653
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck no, I'm not going to pay that...

57:39.557 --> 57:43.466
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to pay what is the equivalent of $43.10 for Gran Turismo 5.

57:43.746 --> 57:46.633
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the full game if I'm going to be paying that kind of money.

57:46.833 --> 57:48.437
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Loki, would you pay $69.99 for the Eye of Judgment?

57:50.868 --> 57:55.451
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the Eye of Judgment comes out soon on October 23rd.

57:55.612 --> 57:56.232
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks funny.

57:56.252 --> 57:56.792
[SPEAKER_02]: For $69.99.

57:57.153 --> 58:03.477
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the good news is, that is the price of the game and the PlayStation Eye, which is the peripheral.

58:04.238 --> 58:08.781
[SPEAKER_02]: Or as we call it here on the program, the Brown Eye of Judgment that will come with the PlayStation Brown Eye.

58:08.801 --> 58:13.905
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to get a Brown Eye for your PlayStation, you can get one on October 23rd for $69.99.

58:14.786 --> 58:17.968
[SPEAKER_02]: You also get a little camera stand with it, but it's called...

58:18.769 --> 58:19.330
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

58:35.899 --> 58:41.864
[SPEAKER_02]: There's battle maps that come with it, a starter deck of cards comes with it, and an 8-card booster pack.

58:41.904 --> 58:43.125
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's where things get interesting.

58:43.585 --> 58:47.448
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want more booster packs, they'll cost you $3.75 each.

58:48.369 --> 58:52.572
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also get 1 of 5 pre-constructed theme packs for $14.99.

58:53.753 --> 58:58.877
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of course, Loki was wondering, well, what the hell's going to stop me from making my own cards and using them to play online?

58:58.937 --> 58:59.177
[SPEAKER_02]: Aha!

58:59.757 --> 59:11.199
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what's going to happen is that you're going to have to pre-register your decks with the game, and you put in your serial numbers, I suppose, and then the software will randomly select what cards get drawn next.

59:11.239 --> 59:12.600
[SPEAKER_02]: That way you can't stack the deck.

59:13.340 --> 59:14.320
[SPEAKER_02]: That's stupid.

59:15.020 --> 59:17.641
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can't... It's stupid.

59:17.921 --> 59:26.442
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, you know, whereas, okay, maybe the PlayStation Brown Eye can have some future, you know... Nobody's really done a decent camera.

59:26.462 --> 59:29.103
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how long did that Xbox 360 Vision thing last?

59:29.838 --> 59:30.818
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it didn't.

59:30.919 --> 59:32.439
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it fizzled the moment it hit.

59:32.459 --> 59:34.060
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it had... What did it have going for it?

59:34.120 --> 59:34.700
[SPEAKER_02]: Totem ball.

59:34.920 --> 59:36.201
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that you can make your own gamer picks.

59:36.221 --> 59:36.841
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me put it this way.

59:36.981 --> 59:38.482
[SPEAKER_01]: It was as popular as the iToy.

59:39.142 --> 59:39.682
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

59:39.882 --> 59:40.422
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.

59:40.643 --> 59:42.263
[SPEAKER_01]: Cameras for systems.

59:43.264 --> 59:46.105
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people just... They're like, ooh, that's kind of cool.

59:46.165 --> 59:52.267
[SPEAKER_02]: And then... iToy squeezed out a little more life out of it.

59:53.508 --> 59:57.390
[SPEAKER_02]: The iToy squeezed a little more life out of it.

59:57.470 --> 59:57.650
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

59:58.911 --> 01:00:03.315
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because it had DDR probably in some of the Harry Potter games and things that kids were into.

01:00:03.755 --> 01:00:08.659
[SPEAKER_02]: But the brown eye is going to need a lot more than the brown eye of judgment to do well, I think.

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:11.682
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just plain online stuff.

01:00:11.762 --> 01:00:15.645
[SPEAKER_01]: It says via cheating, pre-registering your decks.

01:00:16.126 --> 01:00:18.287
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people are going to crack that shit so fast.

01:00:18.307 --> 01:00:19.228
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cheat in person all you want.

01:00:19.809 --> 01:00:22.911
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to crack that shit so fast it's not even funny.

01:00:22.951 --> 01:00:23.211
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

01:00:23.272 --> 01:00:27.355
[SPEAKER_02]: I ask the cracking and hacking community of the world out there.

01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:29.471
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this worth hacking?

01:00:29.971 --> 01:00:30.271
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

01:00:46.298 --> 01:00:47.239
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:04.730
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds interesting.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:19.820
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

01:01:20.021 --> 01:01:26.426
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why, but uploading yourself singing badly to karaoke to put on this YouTube-type thing.

01:01:26.446 --> 01:01:32.391
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you really need that much attention, you could probably set up your own webcam and put it on the real YouTube, and guess what?

01:01:32.431 --> 01:01:35.733
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be free, so... And more people would probably see it.

01:01:35.753 --> 01:01:40.037
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could be angsty about Britney Spears or something, and millions of people will view it.

01:01:41.478 --> 01:01:43.280
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I don't see the point.

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:48.244
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the PlayStation... The eye of judgment is as bad as I thought it was, so...

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:51.942
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well if you plan on purchasing the Eye of Judgment, we'd love to hear from you.

01:01:52.022 --> 01:01:54.023
[SPEAKER_02]: Mail back at orangeonstrider.com I want to know why.

01:01:54.183 --> 01:01:57.365
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to camp out at midnight to buy it, we especially want to hear from you.

01:01:58.065 --> 01:01:58.485
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

01:01:59.966 --> 01:02:01.267
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just what I want to know, why.

01:02:01.427 --> 01:02:03.028
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I get one for free, but I know I won't.

01:02:05.149 --> 01:02:08.210
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you get one for free, I think you should destroy it live on our program.

01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:11.372
[SPEAKER_05]: They did show off the Eye of Judgment at their conference.

01:02:11.452 --> 01:02:14.814
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, Loki, Loki, if you get a brown Eye of Judgment for free, can we destroy it on the program?

01:02:15.592 --> 01:02:15.932
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

01:02:16.032 --> 01:02:16.673
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray!

01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:17.373
[SPEAKER_02]: Destroy!

01:02:17.433 --> 01:02:17.973
[SPEAKER_02]: Destruction!

01:02:18.173 --> 01:02:18.854
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I want the camera.

01:02:18.974 --> 01:02:20.574
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll set something up outside.

01:02:20.614 --> 01:02:26.677
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to play the game, and then, like, in the middle of the game... Can you imagine if someone set the thing on fire?

01:02:26.717 --> 01:02:31.760
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, if you're playing someone online, and then you're, like, dealing with other cards, I'll be like, fuck this shit!

01:02:34.096 --> 01:02:35.296
[SPEAKER_02]: We're totally going to do that.

01:02:35.316 --> 01:02:36.096
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be hilarious.

01:02:36.116 --> 01:02:37.017
[SPEAKER_02]: We will totally do that.

01:02:37.037 --> 01:02:40.557
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll set something up where we can start a small fire and it will be safe.

01:02:41.058 --> 01:02:45.839
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will set the PlayStation Eye on fire live during a match on the PlayStation Online Store.

01:02:45.919 --> 01:02:46.879
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this idea.

01:02:47.259 --> 01:02:47.679
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

01:02:48.399 --> 01:02:50.120
[SPEAKER_05]: I like anything that involves fire, Rob.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:50.620
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:51.240
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:52.760
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how about something that doesn't suck?

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:53.260
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:53.960
[SPEAKER_02]: How about it?

01:02:54.161 --> 01:02:57.201
[SPEAKER_05]: Metal Gear Solid 4, which is full of happy and joy.

01:02:58.501 --> 01:03:00.162
[SPEAKER_05]: Kojima was saying that...

01:03:01.587 --> 01:03:05.588
[SPEAKER_05]: The Metal Gear Online experience is going to include a starter pack.

01:03:06.888 --> 01:03:12.669
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to look through this to see exactly what this starter pack is.

01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:14.970
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like an online starter pack.

01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:21.091
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not seeing anything too specific, but maybe it's... This is like a glorious demo of the game.

01:03:21.731 --> 01:03:22.071
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:03:22.492 --> 01:03:28.653
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I say this real quick while you're... Oh, you can pull over enemies in a barrel.

01:03:29.619 --> 01:03:31.001
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody in chat sent me a message.

01:03:31.021 --> 01:03:31.562
[SPEAKER_02]: This is hilarious.

01:03:31.963 --> 01:03:37.874
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, If the Eye of Judgment becomes a success, Loki must promise to dress up as Tingle.

01:03:41.172 --> 01:03:43.613
[SPEAKER_02]: I will take that bet because I know... Whoa!

01:03:43.793 --> 01:03:44.553
[SPEAKER_02]: He took the bet!

01:03:44.573 --> 01:03:48.215
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it will not... Ladies and gentlemen, everybody must go out.

01:03:48.235 --> 01:03:48.675
[SPEAKER_02]: You have it.

01:03:48.695 --> 01:03:51.896
[SPEAKER_02]: You record... Timestamp this, record it, put it in the archive.

01:03:52.156 --> 01:03:53.197
[SPEAKER_02]: The bet has been taken.

01:03:53.577 --> 01:03:55.277
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now we have to... Wait, hold on.

01:03:55.297 --> 01:03:56.938
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we need to make... Set the parameters here.

01:03:56.978 --> 01:03:58.299
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you said a success.

01:03:58.479 --> 01:04:00.159
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you mean exactly by success?

01:04:00.179 --> 01:04:03.020
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's very general and very broad.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.801
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it needs to sell, like, say, a million units.

01:04:05.841 --> 01:04:06.302
[SPEAKER_01]: How about that?

01:04:06.422 --> 01:04:07.362
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a success?

01:04:07.442 --> 01:04:09.683
[SPEAKER_05]: If the Eye of Judgment sells a million units...

01:04:10.535 --> 01:04:11.736
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki will dress up as Tingle.

01:04:11.796 --> 01:04:14.176
[SPEAKER_01]: I will dress up as Tingle.

01:04:14.917 --> 01:04:18.918
[SPEAKER_01]: I guarantee if that thing sells a million copies, which it will not.

01:04:18.958 --> 01:04:20.279
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, worldwide or domestic?

01:04:20.619 --> 01:04:22.980
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta be specific, because the damn thing could take off in Japan.

01:04:23.618 --> 01:04:24.118
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.

01:04:24.478 --> 01:04:27.019
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go as far as saying worldwide.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:28.980
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit!

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:29.920
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it'll do anything.

01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:32.241
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how many billion people in the world.

01:04:32.301 --> 01:04:37.663
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like saying one in four people buys this thing that owns a PlayStation 3, and there's no way that's going to happen.

01:04:38.183 --> 01:04:40.864
[SPEAKER_01]: Suddenly, everybody in chat has just pre-ordered the Eye of Judgment.

01:04:41.324 --> 01:04:42.085
[SPEAKER_01]: Go right ahead.

01:04:42.345 --> 01:04:42.926
[SPEAKER_01]: Worldwide.

01:04:43.086 --> 01:04:45.368
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you anything that will not sell a million copies.

01:04:45.668 --> 01:04:50.232
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, we have to set a deadline here because a million copies could happen like eight years from now.

01:04:50.272 --> 01:04:51.553
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, six months after release.

01:04:51.593 --> 01:04:52.234
[SPEAKER_01]: Six months, okay.

01:04:52.274 --> 01:04:53.395
[SPEAKER_05]: That's six months after release.

01:04:53.835 --> 01:04:57.319
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, one million copies worldwide within six months.

01:04:57.939 --> 01:04:58.279
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

01:04:58.920 --> 01:04:59.701
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you got it.

01:04:59.881 --> 01:05:00.261
[SPEAKER_01]: You got it.

01:05:00.301 --> 01:05:02.323
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget, chat room, don't let him forget this.

01:05:02.703 --> 01:05:04.105
[SPEAKER_04]: You are all witnesses.

01:05:05.774 --> 01:05:06.934
[SPEAKER_04]: and I will take many, many videos.

01:05:06.954 --> 01:05:07.835
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, god damn.

01:05:07.955 --> 01:05:12.016
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm even going to go out and buy the Eye of Judgment now just to destroy it and get us one step closer.

01:05:12.036 --> 01:05:12.936
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going on YouTube.

01:05:12.976 --> 01:05:15.097
[SPEAKER_02]: To Loki dressing up as YouTube.

01:05:15.237 --> 01:05:17.597
[SPEAKER_02]: Dressing up as Tingle and the whole thing being put on YouTube.

01:05:17.917 --> 01:05:18.498
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the best part.

01:05:18.538 --> 01:05:26.720
[SPEAKER_02]: If it sells a million units, Loki will be dressed up as Tingle, burning on fire and no one will get it.

01:05:28.334 --> 01:05:29.935
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you imagine our poor opponent?

01:05:30.235 --> 01:05:34.078
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, cosplayers who listen to the show, we'll be sending you measurements.

01:05:34.378 --> 01:05:35.739
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the thing.

01:05:36.439 --> 01:05:40.482
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to be playing Bobby Blackwolf when it happens, and nobody tell him what's going to happen.

01:05:42.043 --> 01:05:46.526
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Bobby was your first friend on the PlayStation 3, so nobody tell Blackwolf what we're up to.

01:05:46.546 --> 01:05:47.566
[SPEAKER_02]: Is he going to buy that?

01:05:47.667 --> 01:05:48.267
[SPEAKER_02]: But he'll be the one.

01:05:48.347 --> 01:05:48.687
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:05:48.727 --> 01:05:50.849
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll send him a copy just to make this happen, okay?

01:05:50.869 --> 01:05:54.451
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how about to go back to Metal Gear Solid 4?

01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:55.131
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, yes.

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:56.112
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still cracking up.

01:05:56.561 --> 01:06:05.223
[SPEAKER_05]: They're basically saying that some of the gameplay that's going to be involved in that little demo was like it was saying rolling over enemies with a barrel and then shooting people into the air with a cannon.

01:06:06.503 --> 01:06:07.023
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fun.

01:06:07.864 --> 01:06:08.064
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:06:08.364 --> 01:06:14.225
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you get to do those moves like he does in Super Smash Brothers where he comes up behind somebody and looks like he's about to, you know, ass rape him?

01:06:15.565 --> 01:06:16.546
[SPEAKER_05]: He does that in all the other games.

01:06:16.586 --> 01:06:16.926
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

01:06:17.166 --> 01:06:17.466
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:06:17.506 --> 01:06:17.946
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like fun.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.862
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways... Sorry, I had too good of a laugh.

01:06:23.182 --> 01:06:37.849
[SPEAKER_01]: In case you don't get enough of browsing the PlayStation 3 store, because, you know, there's a whole lot to look at on there, you will now also have the ability to browse the store on the PC soon.

01:06:38.689 --> 01:06:45.773
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll be able to purchase PSP content without using the PS3, and also...

01:06:47.881 --> 01:06:53.144
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's all it's being used for right now, is basically PSP content.

01:06:53.425 --> 01:06:59.048
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I guess a lot of people don't have a PS3, so if they want to download those... Really?

01:06:59.088 --> 01:07:00.249
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't have a PlayStation 3?

01:07:00.289 --> 01:07:01.270
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know, surprising.

01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:05.793
[SPEAKER_01]: If they want to download those PS1 games, now they can do that.

01:07:06.453 --> 01:07:07.194
[SPEAKER_01]: Hooray!

01:07:08.590 --> 01:07:13.372
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the thing that got everybody excited about a PlayStation 3 earlier this year was PlayStation Home.

01:07:13.652 --> 01:07:19.994
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you were hoping to play PlayStation Home this year, you better hope you're in the beta because otherwise you're not playing it until spring of 2008.

01:07:20.194 --> 01:07:22.835
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, something delayed on the PlayStation 3?

01:07:23.336 --> 01:07:24.416
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, who would have thunk it?

01:07:24.916 --> 01:07:28.978
[SPEAKER_02]: This bombshell was announced by Kaz Hirai during the Tokyo Game Show press conference.

01:07:30.918 --> 01:07:33.919
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, everything that comes out on the PlayStation 3 has been delayed lately.

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.741
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like Skate came out a couple weeks later.

01:07:37.661 --> 01:07:37.921
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it

01:07:38.684 --> 01:07:41.025
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuntman Ignition came out almost a month later.

01:07:41.425 --> 01:07:44.427
[SPEAKER_01]: Stranglehold's been delayed again to the end of October now.

01:07:44.507 --> 01:07:47.889
[SPEAKER_02]: Which just goes to show the PlayStation 3 should have waited before it released.

01:07:48.189 --> 01:07:50.010
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, that's old news now.

01:07:50.070 --> 01:07:54.092
[SPEAKER_02]: It should have released this year, but... Gears 2's coming out about a month later?

01:07:56.056 --> 01:07:57.818
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, here's the thing, though.

01:07:57.878 --> 01:08:02.821
[SPEAKER_02]: Despite all the shit I'm talking about, if it's that awesome, maybe it'll be worth the wait.

01:08:03.282 --> 01:08:14.570
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'd rather they do release it bug-free or with as few bugs as possible and just really awesome and the killer app to have for the PlayStation rather than them rush it to make it for this year.

01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.471
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

01:08:16.231 --> 01:08:19.634
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll eventually decide to charge for it once, you know, it's been so long.

01:08:20.274 --> 01:08:21.215
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be worth it.

01:08:21.615 --> 01:08:22.336
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big might.

01:08:23.156 --> 01:08:23.757
[SPEAKER_02]: Big might.

01:08:24.377 --> 01:08:24.978
[SPEAKER_02]: But it might be worth it.

01:08:24.998 --> 01:08:25.458
[SPEAKER_02]: It has potential.

01:08:26.641 --> 01:08:27.082
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll see.

01:08:27.883 --> 01:08:32.368
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, I still have no reason to get a PlayStation 3 until Final Fantasy XIII comes out.

01:08:33.229 --> 01:08:35.833
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's all I have to say on PlayStation Home.

01:08:36.453 --> 01:08:36.974
[SPEAKER_02]: Being delayed.

01:08:38.055 --> 01:08:44.183
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for those who are keeping up with some of the news out of the Tokyo Game Show, there is a new Kingdom Hearts...

01:08:46.343 --> 01:08:52.388
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, more, I would say, additions to the Kingdom Hearts franchise to be out on DS, PSP, and mobile phones.

01:08:53.769 --> 01:09:00.034
[SPEAKER_05]: There is going to be Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep for the PSP.

01:09:00.154 --> 01:09:03.857
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a single-player RPG like the PS2 one.

01:09:04.738 --> 01:09:12.525
[SPEAKER_05]: Kingdom Hearts 358-2 Days for the DS, which is a 3D game with Roxas.

01:09:13.445 --> 01:09:13.606
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

01:09:14.781 --> 01:09:16.882
[SPEAKER_05]: And also we'll have a four-way multiplayer mode.

01:09:16.922 --> 01:09:20.864
[SPEAKER_05]: And the last one is Kingdom Hearts Coded that is on mobile phones.

01:09:22.025 --> 01:09:23.445
[SPEAKER_01]: Coded sounds actually pretty cool.

01:09:23.505 --> 01:09:29.168
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the original Kingdom Hearts game, but you can almost like edit the worlds or something as you're playing through it.

01:09:29.208 --> 01:09:32.090
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the Matrix and Kingdom Hearts together.

01:09:32.490 --> 01:09:41.854
[SPEAKER_05]: That actually, though, after playing Kingdom Hearts 2, at least from the beginning of it, makes perfect sense if it's like set in, you know, I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but if it's set like in dude's computer.

01:09:42.655 --> 01:09:42.835
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

01:09:43.214 --> 01:09:45.519
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember with Roxas and all that.

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:46.943
[SPEAKER_02]: I never beat Kingdom Hearts 2.

01:09:47.003 --> 01:09:48.246
[SPEAKER_05]: But you did play at the beginning, right?

01:09:48.266 --> 01:09:48.566
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:48.586 --> 01:09:49.649
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know what I'm talking about.

01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:50.130
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do, I do.

01:09:50.874 --> 01:09:53.335
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm, uh, I'm looking forward to the games.

01:09:53.355 --> 01:09:53.956
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll check them out.

01:09:54.036 --> 01:09:55.597
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, hopefully they're better than Chain of Memories.

01:09:55.797 --> 01:09:58.658
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, as long as the Disney stuff stays intact.

01:09:59.058 --> 01:10:00.579
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's the one thing that always worries me.

01:10:00.639 --> 01:10:04.181
[SPEAKER_02]: It worried me about that, uh, Final Mix trailer or whatever it was at the end of Kingdom Hearts 2.

01:10:04.661 --> 01:10:07.183
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it was very, very not Disney related.

01:10:07.263 --> 01:10:09.404
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, that's a big charm of the series.

01:10:09.944 --> 01:10:11.185
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, come on.

01:10:11.345 --> 01:10:13.666
[SPEAKER_02]: Tron World was like the awesomest part of Kingdom Hearts 2.

01:10:13.726 --> 01:10:13.786
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

01:10:15.993 --> 01:10:17.335
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon Quest IX Final Fantasy XIV DS

01:10:32.668 --> 01:10:37.871
[SPEAKER_01]: One good thing we can say about the PlayStation 3 is that it has really helped the Folding at Home project.

01:10:37.931 --> 01:10:44.695
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, they have made the milestone achievement of reaching one petroflop.

01:10:45.015 --> 01:10:48.677
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one quadrillion floating point operations per second.

01:10:50.918 --> 01:10:58.463
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it would take everyone in the world 75,000 calculations in a second to achieve a similar result.

01:11:00.103 --> 01:11:00.924
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty awesome.

01:11:03.393 --> 01:11:03.873
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:33.523
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to comments from chat, they're a little bit delayed, so sometimes we report on the last story.

01:11:33.983 --> 01:11:39.806
[SPEAKER_02]: TheRobD says, Sky, none of the Kingdom Hearts 2 stuff had Disney stuff in there either, so Kingdom Hearts will have Disney.

01:11:40.466 --> 01:11:46.709
[SPEAKER_02]: And WonderDogHerald says, singing along with the Little Mermaid was the best part of Kingdom Hearts 2, not Tron, but the Little Mermaid.

01:11:46.729 --> 01:11:52.672
[SPEAKER_05]: Those parts sucked because the songs were awful, but, the original songs, but they were even worse in Japanese.

01:11:55.017 --> 01:11:57.018
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Little Mermaid has awesome music.

01:11:57.478 --> 01:12:01.980
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the songs that were from the Little Mermaid were good, but the ones that they made up for the game sucked ass.

01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:08.342
[SPEAKER_05]: The Japanese ones were pretty... Yeah, but the songs were actually worse than Japanese, including the originals.

01:12:08.643 --> 01:12:11.604
[SPEAKER_02]: And theRobD just wanted to clarify he meant the trailers.

01:12:12.004 --> 01:12:14.285
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I got that, but hopefully the listeners did too.

01:12:15.926 --> 01:12:19.047
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ghost in our chatroom says, World of Warcraft causes cancer.

01:12:20.567 --> 01:12:24.229
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're smoking and playing WoW at the same time, which I've seen people do, it just might.

01:12:25.964 --> 01:12:29.407
[SPEAKER_02]: and drinking, then you're going to have all sorts of problems.

01:12:30.608 --> 01:12:38.635
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the MotorStorm developers are not going to have a problem making money anymore because they just got bought from Sony.

01:12:39.075 --> 01:12:43.939
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony bought Evolution Studios and its subsidiary, Big Big Studios.

01:12:44.159 --> 01:12:52.166
[SPEAKER_02]: They made Pursuit Force, but of course Evolution Studios were the makers of MotorStorm and lots of Sony fans very happy with the game MotorStorm and Sony's very happy with it too.

01:12:52.946 --> 01:12:59.931
[SPEAKER_02]: Evolution has also unveiled that since they've been purchased, they've also been given the go-ahead to make Motorstorm 2.

01:13:00.551 --> 01:13:04.133
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, as a side note, Nintendo, make Excite Truck 2.

01:13:05.814 --> 01:13:06.735
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife demands it.

01:13:06.975 --> 01:13:07.475
[SPEAKER_02]: Excite Truck 2?

01:13:08.096 --> 01:13:08.656
[SPEAKER_02]: Excite Truck 2.

01:13:10.117 --> 01:13:11.258
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Excite something else.

01:13:11.298 --> 01:13:12.719
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be like Excite Boat.

01:13:12.899 --> 01:13:13.239
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:14.520
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

01:13:15.621 --> 01:13:16.281
[SPEAKER_01]: That won't work.

01:13:16.741 --> 01:13:19.183
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not need another Hydro Thunder game.

01:13:20.106 --> 01:13:22.067
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:13:44.344 --> 01:13:45.825
[SPEAKER_01]: Come down, I think, the next week or two.

01:13:47.105 --> 01:13:47.505
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.

01:13:48.045 --> 01:13:51.227
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, congrats, Sony, on your marriage with these new companies.

01:13:51.787 --> 01:13:52.987
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats to DarkSakura.

01:13:53.007 --> 01:13:53.968
[SPEAKER_05]: Let the humping start.

01:13:54.228 --> 01:13:58.670
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats to DarkSakura for finding yet another website to share with our listeners tonight.

01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:03.151
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the next to the last Website of the Week segment.

01:14:03.171 --> 01:14:03.732
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you believe it?

01:14:03.912 --> 01:14:04.392
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

01:14:05.112 --> 01:14:14.775
[SPEAKER_02]: Last, or I should say next week will be DarkSakura's final website of the week because in the next series of episodes starting with 250, she's going to be doing the classic game of the week.

01:14:15.095 --> 01:14:15.315
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

01:14:15.475 --> 01:14:16.036
[SPEAKER_02]: Which will be fun.

01:14:16.516 --> 01:14:21.217
[SPEAKER_02]: So until then though, she surfs the internet up and down finding her last few websites to share with you.

01:14:21.517 --> 01:14:22.678
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got one for you this week.

01:14:23.018 --> 01:14:24.158
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it away, Miss DarkSakura.

01:14:26.699 --> 01:14:30.220
[SPEAKER_05]: The website of the week is actually one given to me by Sauce.

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:32.441
[SPEAKER_05]: It's retrojunk.com.

01:14:33.971 --> 01:14:37.973
[SPEAKER_05]: RetroJunk.com And this site is the best ever.

01:14:39.033 --> 01:14:39.673
[SPEAKER_05]: Ever.

01:14:40.333 --> 01:14:45.335
[SPEAKER_05]: You have everything from old TV show intros to commercials including video game commercials.

01:14:45.716 --> 01:14:46.496
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, Rob.

01:14:46.836 --> 01:14:55.199
[SPEAKER_05]: I found out that a game that I loved that was a PC game was actually on the Turbo Duo and now I have to find it even though it's $30 on eBay.

01:14:55.659 --> 01:14:56.500
[SPEAKER_02]: Dang, what game was that?

01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:57.020
[SPEAKER_05]: Loom.

01:14:57.940 --> 01:14:58.861
[SPEAKER_02]: Loom is rad.

01:14:59.081 --> 01:14:59.781
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Loom.

01:15:00.821 --> 01:15:01.382
[SPEAKER_02]: Good choice.

01:15:01.822 --> 01:15:02.362
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um...

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:20.330
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a... In fact, on their main page, they actually have an article about the Sega Master System, which I don't know if anyone knows, the Sega Master System was actually still going pretty strong in Brazil for a very long time, with a lot of games that came out on 16-bit and later coming out over there on this 8-bit system.

01:15:22.091 --> 01:15:23.192
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of really cool stuff.

01:15:23.232 --> 01:15:32.377
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, just some of the TV intros listed on the main page is Danger Mouse and Voltron Hunter, Robocop,

01:15:33.254 --> 01:15:37.037
[SPEAKER_05]: The commercials listed are like old Nickelodeon commercials from 1982.

01:15:37.297 --> 01:15:38.698
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

01:15:38.939 --> 01:15:39.799
[SPEAKER_05]: Private Benjamin.

01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:42.241
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure YouTube just makes this shit even better.

01:15:42.782 --> 01:15:44.083
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, because everything's on YouTube now.

01:15:44.183 --> 01:15:49.567
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, all of this stuff, from what I understand, I don't think these are links out of YouTube but hosted on their own thing.

01:15:49.667 --> 01:15:50.488
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, cool.

01:15:50.528 --> 01:15:53.110
[SPEAKER_05]: As much of the stuff on there is actually pretty damn good quality.

01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:54.751
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

01:15:54.851 --> 01:15:56.893
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing that I was actually watching, the Voltron one.

01:15:56.953 --> 01:15:57.613
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.

01:15:58.133 --> 01:16:02.537
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an article on here that's 80s movies you hate to love, and it's got a picture of Shona from The Last Dragon.

01:16:03.852 --> 01:16:04.492
[SPEAKER_02]: Show Nuff.

01:16:04.973 --> 01:16:05.913
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's the master?

01:16:06.013 --> 01:16:06.673
[SPEAKER_02]: Show Nuff.

01:16:07.054 --> 01:16:07.294
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

01:16:07.994 --> 01:16:13.137
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of the trailers on here is like the Brave Little Toaster and King Kong vs. Godzilla.

01:16:14.818 --> 01:16:15.158
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

01:16:15.438 --> 01:16:16.398
[SPEAKER_05]: This is pretty cool.

01:16:16.758 --> 01:16:19.260
[SPEAKER_05]: It has stuff dating back to the 60s, 70s, 80s.

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:19.860
[SPEAKER_05]: I think 60s.

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:23.062
[SPEAKER_05]: But definitely the 70s, 80s, and 90s.

01:16:23.382 --> 01:16:27.164
[SPEAKER_05]: And lots of just really awesome retro stuff.

01:16:27.484 --> 01:16:28.404
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty, pretty fun.

01:16:29.225 --> 01:16:31.746
[SPEAKER_05]: What I was trying to mention is I went back to watch the Voltron one.

01:16:32.822 --> 01:16:36.844
[SPEAKER_05]: and it actually had the Go Lion intro and outro on it.

01:16:38.044 --> 01:16:40.485
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the chatroom seems... And David the Gnome, Loki.

01:16:40.905 --> 01:16:43.987
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the chatroom gives your website of the week their seal of approval.

01:16:44.707 --> 01:16:45.867
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be linking this in the chatroom.

01:16:45.947 --> 01:16:49.989
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, if anyone is curious, there also is a forum on here.

01:16:50.409 --> 01:16:53.951
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like they are talking about, oh, do you remember this?

01:16:54.111 --> 01:16:55.691
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to see this?

01:16:56.092 --> 01:16:57.632
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to remember the name of this show.

01:16:58.333 --> 01:16:58.913
[SPEAKER_05]: That type of thing.

01:16:58.933 --> 01:17:01.794
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's one on here that says, which video game songs made you tear up?

01:17:04.646 --> 01:17:05.907
[SPEAKER_05]: I had one that made me cry.

01:17:06.147 --> 01:17:06.548
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

01:17:06.968 --> 01:17:07.688
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Eyes on Me.

01:17:09.249 --> 01:17:10.050
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, wimp.

01:17:10.890 --> 01:17:11.331
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

01:17:11.371 --> 01:17:13.892
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a girl, I'm allowed.

01:17:14.012 --> 01:17:15.453
[SPEAKER_05]: To bite my ass raw.

01:17:15.493 --> 01:17:17.515
[SPEAKER_02]: I was getting a little choked up at Eternal Sonata.

01:17:17.535 --> 01:17:19.136
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't cry, but I was getting a little choked up.

01:17:19.236 --> 01:17:20.056
[SPEAKER_02]: I was getting verklempt.

01:17:20.817 --> 01:17:22.318
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk amongst yourselves.

01:17:22.818 --> 01:17:24.499
[SPEAKER_02]: Eternal Sonata made me a little verklempt.

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:26.320
[SPEAKER_02]: Eternal Sonata.

01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:27.981
[SPEAKER_02]: Neither Eternal nor Sonata.

01:17:28.041 --> 01:17:28.622
[SPEAKER_02]: Disgust.

01:17:28.642 --> 01:17:28.782
[SPEAKER_02]: Disgust.

01:17:31.583 --> 01:17:36.627
[SPEAKER_04]: 555-4444 Anyhow, Loki, please save this program.

01:17:38.449 --> 01:17:40.070
[SPEAKER_01]: What is Africa?

01:17:40.891 --> 01:17:46.095
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, we know it's a continent in the world, but really, what is Africa the game?

01:17:46.815 --> 01:17:54.141
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it is a Pokemon Snap type of jungle safari game where you drive around and you take pictures of wildlife.

01:17:54.161 --> 01:17:55.002
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome!

01:17:55.302 --> 01:17:55.783
Africa!

01:17:56.183 --> 01:17:57.444
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I totally want to play that.

01:17:58.525 --> 01:17:59.626
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's Africa Snap?

01:17:59.646 --> 01:17:59.726
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

01:18:00.279 --> 01:18:01.040
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, yeah.

01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:01.680
[SPEAKER_01]: Rad!

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:18.953
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way I will play this game, and goddammit, it better be possible, and I know it won't be because they're going to pussy out, is if I can't drive my jeep all over the savannah, destroying wildlife as it rolls underneath my tires.

01:18:19.393 --> 01:18:22.175
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the only way I will play this game.

01:18:23.976 --> 01:18:27.499
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to put the fucking things on a track, you know it, just like in Pokemon Snap.

01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:33.823
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm totally gonna play this game.

01:18:35.664 --> 01:18:39.188
[SPEAKER_05]: I fished out money for the Cardcaptor Sakura game just because I thought it was like Pokemon Snap.

01:18:39.728 --> 01:18:41.009
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted a clock and a plate.

01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:42.611
[SPEAKER_02]: Pokemon Snap is fucking rad.

01:18:42.651 --> 01:18:44.373
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like one of the most underrated games in my opinion.

01:18:44.393 --> 01:18:46.355
[SPEAKER_05]: The Cardcaptor Sakura game, however, is not.

01:18:46.595 --> 01:18:50.919
[SPEAKER_05]: But it comes with a clock and a plate, a knife, a fork, spoon, and a pillowcase.

01:18:56.115 --> 01:18:57.056
[SPEAKER_05]: It was on Dreamcast.

01:18:57.236 --> 01:19:01.539
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma says the game should be like Jumbo Safari, and I agree, because Jumbo Safari is awesome.

01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:03.400
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

01:19:04.821 --> 01:19:08.523
[SPEAKER_02]: Tigerclaw says, I'm more curious how the AI in the game is like.

01:19:08.963 --> 01:19:11.625
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if you see a pride of lion, will it show them getting it on?

01:19:12.005 --> 01:19:13.987
[SPEAKER_02]: Will it show them eating something?

01:19:14.607 --> 01:19:17.609
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see blood in this game.

01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:18.870
[SPEAKER_02]: I want M-rated Africa.

01:19:20.331 --> 01:19:23.793
[SPEAKER_05]: We want monkeys flinging poo, lions doing it,

01:19:24.432 --> 01:19:25.753
[SPEAKER_05]: and lots of carnivorous death.

01:19:26.514 --> 01:19:31.758
[SPEAKER_02]: The Rob D says, is Debbie Downer today saying, I don't think Africa is going to be a sandbox GTA game.

01:19:32.698 --> 01:19:36.321
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why they're making this out to be a big game for the PlayStation 3.

01:19:36.762 --> 01:19:39.984
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, it's going to be yet another disappointment.

01:19:40.084 --> 01:19:45.388
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet another average game where it's like, look, it's the most realistic African safari ever!

01:19:45.769 --> 01:19:46.769
[SPEAKER_01]: Then people will be like, so?

01:19:46.969 --> 01:19:48.431
[SPEAKER_05]: We need people to actually get shot.

01:19:48.511 --> 01:19:51.473
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not buying your fucking $600 system for an African safari.

01:19:52.025 --> 01:19:52.465
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you.

01:19:52.685 --> 01:19:56.268
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. DeBucket says, Africa is a former Hot Shots Golf 5 minigame.

01:19:56.568 --> 01:19:58.229
[SPEAKER_02]: You used to shoot gold balls at the animal.

01:19:59.490 --> 01:20:00.291
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a bit weird.

01:20:00.891 --> 01:20:03.873
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone, GS68, was bringing up Let's Go Jungle.

01:20:05.114 --> 01:20:06.555
[SPEAKER_05]: A rail shooter where you shoot the wildlife.

01:20:07.956 --> 01:20:12.239
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to join in the fun, chat.orangeonstrater.com where we do tapes.

01:20:12.279 --> 01:20:14.001
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not want to kill the animals.

01:20:14.401 --> 01:20:17.043
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to see the animals killing other animals.

01:20:17.063 --> 01:20:17.543
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

01:20:18.084 --> 01:20:20.045
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, carnivorous death.

01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:22.670
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

01:20:42.136 --> 01:20:42.936
[SPEAKER_01]: for PlayStation 3.

01:21:10.672 --> 01:21:12.013
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a lolcats game.

01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:14.233
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. DeBucket says we need a ceiling cat game.

01:21:14.353 --> 01:21:14.694
[SPEAKER_02]: Winner!

01:21:14.934 --> 01:21:15.174
[SPEAKER_02]: Winner!

01:21:15.194 --> 01:21:16.674
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a ceiling cat game!

01:21:16.874 --> 01:21:24.017
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you've been on cat macros on LiveJournal lately, it's all nothing but fucking ceiling cat lately.

01:21:24.477 --> 01:21:29.459
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone is picking any word that ends in 8 and making a ceiling cat macro to it.

01:21:32.513 --> 01:21:36.614
[SPEAKER_05]: Sealing Cat is watching you masticate or fornicate or abbreviate.

01:21:36.874 --> 01:21:39.295
[SPEAKER_05]: But my favorite one, two people did this.

01:21:39.315 --> 01:21:42.996
[SPEAKER_05]: They did one with Daleks and it says, Sealing Cat is watching you exterminate.

01:21:43.657 --> 01:21:44.297
[SPEAKER_05]: That was great.

01:21:46.798 --> 01:21:47.998
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one with Bill O'Reilly.

01:21:48.038 --> 01:21:49.819
[SPEAKER_02]: Sealing Cat is watching you bloviate.

01:21:51.679 --> 01:21:52.039
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:54.440
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some of the older ones.

01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:56.361
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these was like a marathon post.

01:21:56.901 --> 01:21:57.141
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:21:58.533 --> 01:21:59.614
[SPEAKER_02]: It had, like, everything.

01:21:59.634 --> 01:22:02.616
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of them is, Sealing Cat is watching you look for words that end in 8.

01:22:03.437 --> 01:22:05.318
[SPEAKER_02]: Sealing Cat is watching you conjugate.

01:22:05.358 --> 01:22:07.500
[SPEAKER_02]: Sealing Cat is watching you regurgitate.

01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:09.601
[SPEAKER_02]: Sealing Cat is watching you vegetate.

01:22:09.661 --> 01:22:11.162
[SPEAKER_02]: Sealing Cat is watching you spin a plate.

01:22:11.643 --> 01:22:13.304
[SPEAKER_02]: Sealing Cat is watching you precipitate.

01:22:14.044 --> 01:22:16.246
[SPEAKER_02]: Sealing Cat is watching you permutate.

01:22:16.966 --> 01:22:18.568
[SPEAKER_02]: Sealing Cat is watching you obliviate.

01:22:18.648 --> 01:22:20.149
[SPEAKER_02]: With a Harry Potter reference there.

01:22:20.209 --> 01:22:22.410
[SPEAKER_02]: Sealing Cat is watching you percolate at a Starbucks there.

01:22:22.831 --> 01:22:25.012
[SPEAKER_02]: Sealing Cat is watching you animate with The Simpsons.

01:22:25.933 --> 01:22:27.314
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my favorite, The Little Truck.

01:22:28.166 --> 01:22:30.007
[SPEAKER_02]: Sealing Cat is watching you compensate.

01:22:31.768 --> 01:22:36.171
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I'll link that in chat because I'm sure the podcast listeners are like... I like Sealing Cat is doing a figure eight.

01:22:36.371 --> 01:22:37.772
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, what the hell did I sign up for?

01:22:38.833 --> 01:22:40.214
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Wonder Dog Herald is right on.

01:22:40.234 --> 01:22:42.375
[SPEAKER_02]: It says it's like green eggs and ham for a new generation.

01:22:44.776 --> 01:22:45.397
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you imagine?

01:22:45.697 --> 01:22:49.079
[SPEAKER_01]: That is untapped profit right there.

01:22:49.239 --> 01:22:50.220
[SPEAKER_01]: What, the Seuss series?

01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:53.822
[SPEAKER_01]: No, to make children's books with internet access.

01:22:54.918 --> 01:22:56.039
[SPEAKER_01]: Sealing Cat is watching this show suck.

01:22:56.059 --> 01:22:57.279
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that didn't end at 8.

01:22:57.319 --> 01:22:57.420
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:00.101
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what can save a show from going downhill is a good old story that relates to porn.

01:23:16.428 --> 01:23:19.109
[SPEAKER_02]: or in this sense, Eroticness.

01:23:19.749 --> 01:23:29.111
[SPEAKER_02]: In World of Warcraft, that's right, an erotic role-playing guild that was spanned across two realms has been disabled by Blizzard.

01:23:29.631 --> 01:23:34.492
[SPEAKER_02]: Blizzard forcibly disbanded the guild, but of course they just went and made it under a new name.

01:23:34.532 --> 01:23:39.754
[SPEAKER_02]: The guild, Abhorrent Taboo, is a horde-side RP guild on Ravenholt, which is

01:23:41.661 --> 01:23:44.242
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost the name of the server I play on, Ravencrest.

01:23:44.822 --> 01:23:48.143
[SPEAKER_02]: It had an alliance chapter on Blackwater Raiders.

01:23:49.343 --> 01:23:51.944
[SPEAKER_02]: Here was their welcome message on their forums.

01:23:52.384 --> 01:23:53.824
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote, role-playing is legal.

01:23:53.984 --> 01:23:59.606
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you are role-playing something that wouldn't be considered deplorable and highly illegal in real life, it's still just role-playing.

01:23:59.626 --> 01:24:01.947
[SPEAKER_02]: It isn't subject to any form of disciplinary action.

01:24:02.347 --> 01:24:03.887
[SPEAKER_02]: Negative publicity is still publicity.

01:24:03.947 --> 01:24:05.788
[SPEAKER_02]: Make a dig or website about how sick we are.

01:24:06.068 --> 01:24:07.408
[SPEAKER_02]: Report us to perverted justice.

01:24:07.468 --> 01:24:08.748
[SPEAKER_02]: All it does is bring in more members.

01:24:08.829 --> 01:24:10.529
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, the dig guy on Ravenholt said,

01:24:11.469 --> 01:24:15.771
[SPEAKER_02]: made about us was so effective, several people signed up for WoW just to be in our guild.

01:24:15.831 --> 01:24:20.172
[SPEAKER_02]: The bottom line is we're allowed to do what we want on any server we please and no one can do anything about it.

01:24:21.292 --> 01:24:32.796
[SPEAKER_02]: And those types of things, by the way, would be extreme sexual situations, meaning sometimes with folks that are under 18, blah, blah, blah, et cetera, et cetera.

01:24:32.856 --> 01:24:33.796
[SPEAKER_02]: Use your imagination here.

01:24:34.376 --> 01:24:35.777
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it's all in game.

01:24:35.817 --> 01:24:37.077
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all fake anyways.

01:24:37.357 --> 01:24:39.038
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you saying it's okay?

01:24:39.958 --> 01:24:40.859
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all in game.

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:44.425
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going out and actually having sex with children or something like that.

01:24:44.825 --> 01:24:48.570
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless if they are, then that's wrong, but it's all in game.

01:24:49.752 --> 01:24:55.801
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them end up on an episode of Dateline or something like that.

01:24:56.968 --> 01:25:01.170
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, I'm kind of torn on this, is that, you know, I do believe censorship is wrong.

01:25:01.690 --> 01:25:09.373
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, there's probably some pretty, I mean, there might be some normal people that are trying to, you know, this gives a bad name to role players everywhere is what it really does.

01:25:10.373 --> 01:25:14.515
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, at the same time, Blizzard has the right to do whatever they want with their servers.

01:25:15.115 --> 01:25:16.996
[SPEAKER_01]: All they need to do is just go second life.

01:25:17.316 --> 01:25:19.277
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, come on.

01:25:20.717 --> 01:25:22.058
[SPEAKER_01]: Way worse than what we're doing.

01:25:23.627 --> 01:25:27.048
[SPEAKER_02]: To which Mr. DeBucket says, Pedobear is watching you play World of Warcraft.

01:25:28.029 --> 01:25:29.269
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's a play on Sealing Cat?

01:25:29.289 --> 01:25:29.789
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea.

01:25:32.370 --> 01:25:33.631
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Pedobear, you don't get it.

01:25:33.931 --> 01:25:34.891
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, I get it.

01:25:36.292 --> 01:25:49.877
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess what's been going on for a while is that I never noticed these guys in-game, but folks have been petitioning customer service and posting in the suggestion forums wanting people to do stuff about this extreme roleplay, and finally this guild was forcibly disbanded.

01:25:51.358 --> 01:25:52.919
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if there's a comment from Blizzard here.

01:25:52.979 --> 01:25:53.279
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.

01:25:53.899 --> 01:25:58.802
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote, this matter is not one Blizzard takes lightly in any way, shape, or form.

01:25:58.962 --> 01:26:01.203
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not wish to have this topic continue circulation.

01:26:01.683 --> 01:26:09.887
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it finally be said that we appreciate those of you who brought this particular issue to our attention and that we will continue to follow up with this matter in the future to ensure the safety of all parties is concerned.

01:26:10.587 --> 01:26:11.988
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, the guild is reformed.

01:26:12.048 --> 01:26:14.089
[SPEAKER_02]: Their new name is Vile Anathema.

01:26:16.044 --> 01:26:16.485
[SPEAKER_05]: Anathema.

01:26:16.725 --> 01:26:17.186
[SPEAKER_02]: Anathema.

01:26:17.706 --> 01:26:18.547
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that even mean?

01:26:18.608 --> 01:26:18.968
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:26:19.709 --> 01:26:21.471
[SPEAKER_05]: It means it's a front.

01:26:23.454 --> 01:26:23.734
[SPEAKER_02]: Cute.

01:26:25.697 --> 01:26:26.318
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there you go.

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:30.043
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I'd really call that erotic in WoW.

01:26:30.383 --> 01:26:33.708
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of crazies people in WoW.

01:26:35.769 --> 01:26:37.590
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious what you guys in the chat room think.

01:26:37.650 --> 01:26:46.177
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Legend of Zaku says, Loki, I'm sorry, but speaking in a sexually suggestive manner to a minor is not protected speech.

01:26:47.058 --> 01:26:55.504
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, dictionary definition, a thing that is detested or loathed, cursed, or consigned to damnation or destruction.

01:26:56.825 --> 01:26:58.126
[SPEAKER_02]: At least they have a sense of humor about it.

01:26:59.407 --> 01:27:00.728
[SPEAKER_05]: Thought that you would find that amusing.

01:27:01.021 --> 01:27:01.782
[SPEAKER_01]: PS2 Nerf Wireless Controller

01:27:24.661 --> 01:27:33.130
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's actually DarkTesia posted a link in LiveJournal about this and I want one so I can throw my controller at the screen and not break my TV.

01:27:33.330 --> 01:27:34.591
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, lots of people do that.

01:27:35.732 --> 01:27:37.073
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw their controllers everywhere.

01:27:37.094 --> 01:27:37.894
[SPEAKER_05]: This is so smart.

01:27:38.054 --> 01:27:38.875
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously.

01:27:39.936 --> 01:27:41.458
[SPEAKER_05]: To read the description on GameStop.com

01:27:43.631 --> 01:28:10.497
[SPEAKER_05]: the Nerf wireless controller from Pelican allows gamers to play like a pro baller on their PlayStation 2 the controllers are made from soft pliable Nerf material on the outside but feature legendary Pelican performance on the inside legendary my ass they are tough enough to withstand hardcore squeezing throwing twisting spiking and feel like no other controller on the market and there's retail for $24.99 I thought those came out like a long time ago I don't know if they did but I want one

01:28:11.763 --> 01:28:13.346
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's a new version or something, who knows?

01:28:13.726 --> 01:28:15.950
[SPEAKER_05]: They're kind of ugly but adorable.

01:28:18.375 --> 01:28:19.397
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like an ugly baby.

01:28:22.765 --> 01:28:25.568
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, and on that note, I think we'll bring Part A to a close.

01:28:25.588 --> 01:28:27.790
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gone long tonight on Part A. I guess we have a lot to say.

01:28:28.191 --> 01:28:32.615
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to take a quick break, and we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
