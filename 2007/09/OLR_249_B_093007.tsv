4760	5760	twice weekly.
5760	12240	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links
12240	15480	to websites with listings of past episodes.
15480	20240	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20240	24440	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, September the 30th
24440	29120	of 2007, I almost said 2008, what's wrong with me?
29120	33640	We're getting into October, very soon, and gosh, where did the year go?
33640	38520	I don't know, pretty soon we're going to be getting into just this games upon games
38520	39520	upon game release.
39520	42400	Well, really, we're kind of already in the middle of that, really, with the launch of
42400	47760	Halo 3 and Bioshock, we're really in the gaming season.
47760	50740	So be good or Santa's not going to bring you the games you want.
50740	54660	But we will keep bringing you the gaming news you want, whether you've been good or bad.
54660	57120	So we're going to get right back into some gaming news, aren't we, Loki?
57120	63440	Yes, and you know, this game's kind of interesting, I don't know how popular it's going to be,
63440	66840	because you've got, you know, kind of conflicting elements to it.
66840	75400	For example, well Mario and Sonic at the Olympics, now Mario and Sonic games, those are good.
75400	77640	Olympic games, those are usually bad.
77640	82220	So it's kind of, I don't know, I don't know if it's going to be good or not.
82220	84660	Either way, this could go either way.
84660	91320	Either way, there will be 16 characters, including your favorites from both the Sonic and Mario
91320	93440	and I guess Nintendo universes.
93440	99700	Although what's weird though is I do see the villain from one of the alligators from the
99700	104160	Donkey Kong Country franchises, yet no Donkey Kong.
104160	105160	Odd.
105160	107380	So that was kind of neat.
107380	115680	And then, you know, they have of course Sonic and Knuckles and Tails and etc.
115680	121880	So anyways, some of the events that you're going to see in there, fencing, they've got
121880	122880	that.
122880	130080	Archery, shooting skeet, gymnastics, including trampoline and vault, high jump, pole vault,
130080	137200	long jump, triple jump, javelin throw, hammer throw, single skulls for rowing of course,
137200	143680	table tennis, aquatics in both the 100 meter and of course the 4 lap 100 meter.
143680	150960	And let's see here, tracks of course, 110 meter, 400 meter hurdles, 100 meter relay
150960	156280	and the just normal 100 meter and 400 meter.
156280	157760	So lots of running and stuff.
157760	158760	I don't know.
158760	161900	I still don't understand how Mario is ever going to beat Sonic in running.
161900	164120	Like nobody's been able to explain this logic to me.
164120	169080	Like did they give Sonic some like drugs to slow him down or Mario some steroids?
169080	171800	I mean what, how is that ever going to be an even match?
171800	176240	The characters in the game, I mean it's, they've kind of broken them up like they did with
176240	181760	Mario Kart where you've got the power types, you know, the ones that are more of the robust
181760	187840	characters like Bowser and you know Wario, stuff like that, and Knuckles is in there
187840	188840	too.
188840	189840	So apparently Knuckles is a fat ass.
189840	192360	Well, he's a fatty.
192360	194400	But they say, well he does have a little bit of a gut.
194400	198000	What they're saying, Dark Knight says in our chat room at chat.orangelandsreading.com,
198000	199120	they balance the characters.
199120	203280	I understand they balance the characters but that still doesn't make sense in the regards
203280	207360	of that Sonic, you know, runs very fast and Mario runs kind of fast.
207360	213700	They also have all round characters which Mario falls under as well as Luigi and apparently
213700	216240	also the two chicks from the Sonic universe.
216240	219760	So Mario and Luigi, you're as powerful as chicks.
219760	221440	Way to go, pansies.
221440	222440	Anyways and then...
222440	225240	Woah, I think there might be some women a little angry at that comment.
225240	230080	Well, I mean, honestly.
230080	234640	Mr. DeBucket in chat says they wouldn't let Bowser into the Chinese Olympics.
234640	235640	Yeah.
235640	241520	And then of course for the speed types, you have Sonic, you actually have, what's his
241520	242520	name...
242520	243520	Tails.
243520	246880	Oh, the crappy game, what was the crappy game?
246880	247880	Driver.
247880	251400	No, the Sonic game, crappy Sonic game.
251400	252400	Sonic the Hedgehog.
252400	255720	No, the last one that came out before Sonic...
255720	256720	I don't know.
256720	257720	The guy with the gun.
257720	258720	I don't know.
258720	259720	Oh, Shadow the Hedgehog?
259720	260720	Shadow, yes.
260720	261720	Thank you.
261720	266400	Sorry, they all look alike and those games kind of blend together so pardon me for forgetting
266400	267400	that crappy game.
267400	275480	And then of course the skill types where you have Princess Peach, Tails, Waluigi, and Dr.
275480	276840	Eggman.
276840	281880	I hope Princess Peach will be able to use her emotional power in the Olympic game somehow.
281880	283720	Well, that would be a skill, I guess.
283720	285400	That's right, some type of skill.
285400	292400	I don't know, so it's going to be all split up, who knows, I don't know, but to be honest,
292400	295900	I don't like, I don't think I'm going to buy this game.
295900	296900	It's just...
296900	297900	Maybe I'd run it.
297900	303360	All it seems to me is it's like, hey, we put out another crappy Olympics game, but we have
303360	307280	Sonic and Mario this time, so you're going to buy it, right?
307280	308280	Huh?
308280	309280	Huh?
309280	310280	Yeah?
310280	313840	Maybe we'll have advertising for these games during the Olympics and that kind of crap,
313840	316720	so cross promotion stuff.
316720	320340	Be honest though, I think you guys are going to get suckered into buying another crappy
320340	324460	Olympics game because it has characters that you like, so have at it.
324460	327120	I'll be busy playing Super Mario Galaxy instead.
327120	331720	Well, I will be busy playing Super Smash Brothers Brawl when that comes out.
331720	338800	Oh yeah, upon its release, yes, and one thing that has lots of fanboys and girls very excited,
338800	342800	especially if you're a David Hayter fanboy or fangirl, which I believe Dark Soccer is
342800	343800	a David Hayter fangirl.
343800	346160	Oh yeah, because he could just talk to me all day and I'll be happy.
346160	347160	Do you watch his YouTube?
347160	351200	Apparently, he has a YouTube site where he does all these little Q&A things and does
351200	352200	stuff on there.
352200	353200	I didn't know that.
353200	354200	I'll have to check.
354200	355200	You definitely should check that out.
355200	359880	This guy named Archduke Chocula was checking it out and sent David Hayter a question that
359880	363240	said, hello, David Hayter, I have to say you are one of the greatest voice actors ever
363240	365800	and you do a great job as Snake.
365800	369800	I was wondering, are you going to voice Snake in the Super Smash Brothers Brawl, to which
369800	374320	David Hayter responded, I am indeed voicing Snake in Smash Brothers.
374320	378880	I recorded it already and I believe that fans of both games are going to be extremely happy.
378880	380080	It's very cool.
380080	381240	That's all I can say.
381240	385780	So this is authentic Snake now because it's the same voice actor and everything.
385780	393000	So that's just one more cool thing that you can put on the ever-growing list of cool things
393000	394000	in Smash Brothers Brawl.
394000	395000	I mean, seriously.
395000	396000	I love David Hayter.
396000	398000	They've got Resetti in there.
398000	400760	Dude, they put fucking Resetti in Smash Brothers Brawl.
400760	401760	That's great.
401760	403200	What is he going to do, bitch at you until you die?
403200	406520	He comes out and lectures you on the mechanics of how to play the game, I think.
406520	410040	Wasn't that the impression I got from, I don't think he's like an item or anything.
410040	411280	He lectures you on how to play the game.
411280	415060	I want Mr. Saturn still in the game as an item because I love Mr. Saturn.
415060	416680	I just want Ness.
416680	417680	Is that too much to ask?
417680	418680	PK Fire.
418680	421960	Or how about like, was it Howard and Nestor?
421960	422960	That'd be hilarious.
422960	425600	Dark Knight says, I would love to have a Smash Brothers on the DS.
425600	428040	Dude, I bet that'll be the next one.
428040	429520	I bet that'll be the next one.
429520	430520	Yeah.
430520	431520	Anyway.
431520	437140	Well, speaking of things, Nintendo, for Virtual Console coming out in the UK, Sin and Punishment
437140	442240	is the recent addition, which was a Nintendo 64 game.
442240	450000	Pretty cool game and it supposedly just came out looking really nice on the Wii, so it's
450000	458360	out there for 1200 Wii points, which translates in money to 12 euro or 8 pounds 40.
458360	462400	And then moving on to the next releases in the UK.
462400	464160	Did you have a comment?
464160	465160	Nope.
465160	466160	I had no comments.
466160	467840	You looked like you had anticipation.
467840	468840	No.
468840	471360	We also have The Legend of Hero Tanma.
471360	473800	I would like Anticipation to be released on Virtual Console.
473800	474800	That was an awesome game.
474800	475800	Anticipation.
475800	476800	No it wasn't.
476800	478200	I see you shiver.
478200	479200	With Anticipation.
479200	480200	Okay.
480200	481200	Never mind.
481200	482200	Please move on.
482200	483200	Say it!
483200	484200	No.
484200	490000	TurboGrafx-16 game, The Legend of Hero Tanma, 600 Wii points, which is a little platformer
490000	492800	kind of like Wonder Boy.
492800	495600	You go save a princess and do shit.
495600	496600	So, yeah.
496600	498160	You sure know how to sell those games.
498160	499160	Yeah, whatever.
499160	500160	Yeah, check out this game.
500160	501480	You go save a princess and do shit.
501480	503400	Dude, I'm saving the best for last.
503400	504400	Alright.
504400	505400	So it's Mario?
505400	506400	No.
506400	507400	Zelda?
507400	508400	No.
508400	509400	Just, you know, some princess.
509400	510400	Wonder Boy!
510400	513040	Wonder Boy in Monsterland did come out, didn't it?
513040	514040	Mmm.
514040	515040	I think so.
515040	516040	I love Wonder Boy in Monsterland.
516040	517040	But anyway.
517040	522640	Gradius III, which was a SNES game, 900 Wii points.
522640	525160	And dude, it's fucking Gradius, so you won it right now.
525160	531040	And I think that's also part of that Japanese gamey thing that, you know, are the releasing
531040	533560	games in the UK that we don't have over here.
533560	534560	Gradius III.
534560	535560	Sad.
535560	538960	I actually have Gradius III, though.
538960	541040	It's in the Gradius collection on PSP.
541040	543640	Well, but I actually have a cart.
543640	545400	Well, can I touch you?
545400	546400	You're just so cool.
546400	547400	I have Gradius II.
547400	548880	I just want a little piece of your coolness.
548880	553680	I have Gradius II on Turbo Duo, which is the best version of that game ever.
553680	557080	Can we get to another story before Jamie's ego gets too big?
557080	558080	She can't leave my house.
558080	559080	Yes.
559080	560840	I have to have the ultimate gamer ego.
560840	566440	Speaking of the Turbo Duo, there are going to be a couple games coming out, actually
566440	572240	as part of the first Turbo CD games being announced for the Virtual Console.
572240	577360	The first two are going to be Gates of Thunder, or Gate of Thunder.
577360	582320	And they'll be coming out for 800 Wii points, as well as Super Air Zonk will be coming out
582320	583320	as well.
583320	586480	That was such a bizarre little game.
586480	590520	Turbo Graphics XVI was a bizarre little console, so it makes perfect sense.
590520	593800	But it has some great stuff on it.
593800	597000	I pressed the bathroom door to get a copy of Pac-Land.
597000	598000	Remember the button?
598000	600640	Oh my god, that was so long ago.
600640	601640	I know, that was great.
601640	602640	You have to set the door.
602640	605360	Okay, well, we were at Classic Gaming Expo, right?
605360	608080	And they were selling Pac-Land on the Turbo Graphics XVI.
608080	609680	I was, what, $5 short?
609680	613080	And Jamie was like, I want that, I just need $5 to get it.
613080	618240	And so, what did we, there was this little, god, this is so stupid, I can't believe we're
618240	619240	telling this story.
619240	620680	It was the bathroom, there were three doors that had the automatic button.
620680	622800	But seriously, Jamie, this was a, you had to be there thing.
622800	624960	The listeners are going to be like, this story isn't funny at all.
624960	628960	But I will do stuff for Turbo Graphics games.
628960	634120	This little girl we saw, she ran up and pressed the button to open the handicapped restroom
634120	636040	and then ran away.
636040	639700	And for some reason this was the most hilarious thing in the world to us, like we were laughing
639700	640700	and laughing at this little girl.
640700	641700	We were that bored.
641700	643160	And we, I guess so.
643160	647200	So I said to Jamie, I said Jamie, if you mimic what that little girl just did, I'll give
647200	648420	you $5.
648420	649420	And she did it.
649420	650420	We took pictures.
650420	651420	They're somewhere.
651420	652420	Because, I don't know.
652420	655160	Do you know how many times I've played that copy of Pac-Land?
655160	656160	Hmm.
656160	657160	Once.
657160	658160	Really?
658160	659160	Not even on the actual duo.
659160	660160	I played it on a Turbo Express.
660160	662160	I want my $5 back.
662160	663160	No.
663160	664160	You can come play my game though.
664160	665160	I don't wanna.
665160	670840	Another game, well another Turbo Graphics game announced as well, Samurai Ghost.
670840	674080	But of course that's not a Turbo CD title.
674080	676760	Wow, more people just entered the studio.
676760	677760	What is that?
677760	678760	Keep going with the story.
678760	680120	Ignore them for a minute.
680120	681600	So that's it.
681600	683560	All your Turbo CD games.
683560	685460	Was that it?
685460	687880	No more news on Turbo Graphics CD games?
687880	688880	Nope.
688880	689880	That was it.
689880	690880	Well.
690880	698140	Going back to Nintendo Wii, Fatal Frame is being developed for the Nintendo Wii.
698140	702680	It's being developed by Grasshopper and it's being published by Tecmo.
702680	706280	And it's being worked on very soon, I guess, right now.
706280	710100	And it's kinda cool because Fatal Frame is very popular, well, it's no Silent Hill or
710100	715220	Resident Evil, but it's probably on that secondary tier of scary video games and so we're always
715220	717880	curious to see how games translate over to the Wii.
717880	721860	But you can bet there'll probably be something to do with photography and the Wiimote and
721860	724000	all that stuff.
724000	727760	All that stuff is very, you know, specific, Rob.
727760	728760	Absolutely.
728760	733360	Well, this makes me a happy, happy, happy bunny.
733360	737240	One of my favorite games ever...
737240	738540	They're distracting me, Rob!
738540	740440	To ignore them and read the story.
740440	747380	One of my favorite ever games is Samba de Amigo and there is a statement that it is
747380	749360	going to be on the Wii.
749360	756360	It's supposedly this cover scan from Nintendo Power that's floating around ye old interwebs
756360	764440	showing a Samba de Amigo for the Wii.
764440	767840	Samba de Amigo on the Wii is going to be awesome.
767840	771240	There's nothing, though, in the issue regarding gameplay, so...
771240	772240	Alright.
772240	773440	So, yeah.
773440	778740	Anyway, let's introduce, you know, X-Defer and Rice Princess barged in here, so I thought
778740	780280	I'd let them say hello.
780280	782520	Well, hello there.
782520	784800	I'm British now.
784800	787120	What are you kids up to this evening?
787120	789360	We basically came here to say hi.
789360	791280	I haven't been on Orange Laundry in a while.
791280	792640	Well, I mean, since I called in.
792640	793640	I like it that way!
793640	794640	Awwww.
794640	796160	Were you here last week?
796160	798360	Well, no, I called in last week.
798360	800160	Oh, that's right.
800160	801840	But I decided to...
801840	802840	It's me and Rice Princess.
802840	804840	Say hi, Rice Princess.
804840	808320	Hi, Rice Princess.
808320	810440	Okay.
810440	812080	And we just want to say hi.
812080	815960	And oh, yeah, we want you to do a song that we want on the cage match.
815960	817920	Okay, well, that's after the show.
817920	819120	We'll worry about that later.
819120	821400	But for right now, what games have you guys been playing?
821400	822400	You need to make this gaming-related.
822400	825720	Don't just come onto the show and be all, hi, I'm here, and you should care about that,
825720	828480	because, you know, we might have new listeners who don't know who the fuck you are.
828480	831840	So, what kinds of games have you been playing this week?
831840	832840	The Game of Life.
832840	834840	No, I pulled in...
834840	836240	You lost!
836240	843280	I've been playing WoW and also Puzzle Quest, which is just usual stuff.
843280	847360	I think that's what I said last week, Rice Princess.
847360	849360	That is what you said last week.
849360	851160	I'm just kidding.
851160	857440	I've been playing WoW, and I played Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo last night at a certain
857440	862320	party that was thrown that I attended.
862320	863320	It was fun.
863320	867960	Now, I have a question about Puzzle Fighter II, because you loved the one that was on
867960	870320	Sony PlayStation and the old-school one.
870320	873640	How does the Xbox 360 one compare?
873640	877300	The game itself isn't bad, but the controller is god-awful.
877300	881120	Like when I wanted to press down, it would go, like, to the left or to the right.
881120	882120	It made me mad.
882120	883680	Am I being too quiet?
883680	885200	I'm sorry about that.
885200	887240	I will raise my voice.
887240	892840	Yeah, the game itself isn't bad, but the controller is, like, a nightmare to use to play that
892840	893840	game.
893840	894840	But, yeah.
894840	895840	I enjoyed it thoroughly.
895840	896840	Yep.
896840	901280	Did you try the remix mode with the different drop patterns and stuff?
901280	902280	No.
902280	903280	What?
903280	905160	I only went into one mode.
905160	908440	I just kept pressing A until the game started, so.
908440	909800	There's like way more to the game.
909800	912120	There's, like, all these different, like, you can play modes where you don't even just
912120	913120	make bricks.
913120	917680	You make, like, different things, and you need to check out the game a little more thoroughly.
917680	920280	That was a very bad review job you did.
920280	921280	Fired!
921280	924920	Well, listen, son of a bitch, you should have told me.
924920	925920	I would have done that.
925920	930320	I just kept pressing A because I really wanted to play the game, like, because I, you know
930320	934360	what, I'm, like, the best at the game out of all of you, so.
934360	938360	That's why you're making fun of me, because you're jealous of my skills.
938360	940840	All right, no more derailing the show.
940840	942240	We gotta get back to gaming news.
942240	945320	So you can stay if you want to contribute to news, otherwise get out.
945320	949760	Well, we actually, are we gonna go?
949760	952800	I guess, way to put me on the spot.
952800	953800	Oh, okay.
953800	955200	Well, we can stay and listen.
955200	956240	All right.
956240	957240	You do that.
957240	958240	Let's get back to some gaming news.
958240	961080	All the listeners are like, back to gaming news?
961080	963400	Well, yeah, now Irene's like, I gotta go look at Puzzle Fighter.
963400	964400	All right.
964400	965400	Anyways.
965400	966400	Yes, please.
966400	971000	So, apparently the BAFTA nominees are really coming around.
971000	976240	For those not to know, that's the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.
976240	981480	They've announced their nominees to the 2007 Video Game Awards, and topping the list is
981480	983040	Wii Sports.
983040	989360	With seven nominations, including Innovation and Best Game categories, and of course there's
989360	994960	also a four-way tie for the second most nominations with Crackdown, awesome game, Gears of War,
994960	1001480	also awesome game, Akami, and God of War 2, all awesome games.
1001480	1003360	I don't know if it should be Game of the Year, though.
1003360	1006900	It's pretty rad, though, that they give it such good recognition, though, over there.
1006900	1010160	Other nominees, of course, Bioshock, Crysis.
1010160	1011280	How could Crysis be nominated?
1011280	1013280	It's not even out yet.
1013280	1017920	Gears of War, which I already mentioned, Guitar Hero 2, and Kane & Lynch.
1017920	1022060	Also, Kane & Lynch is not out yet.
1022060	1027880	They need a gaming Oscars, and I'm not talking about, like, what is it, the Spike TV Awards
1027880	1028880	or whatever that crap is.
1028880	1029880	The G4ia Awards.
1029880	1031560	You know, does that even exist anymore?
1031560	1033960	I think it's now, like, a segment on X-Play.
1033960	1034960	It doesn't even matter.
1034960	1035960	E4All presents.
1035960	1037840	None of that stuff counts.
1037840	1041400	I want a gaming Oscars, something that's not a joke.
1041400	1042400	Oh well.
1042400	1043920	Forget it.
1043920	1046080	The Howard and Nestor Awards.
1046080	1047080	No.
1047080	1049360	The Howard and Nestor Awards.
1049360	1050880	That would actually be pretty awesome.
1050880	1053840	Winners will be announced, of course, on October 23rd.
1053840	1058480	Well, Xbox 360 games seem to be moving over to the Nintendo DS.
1058480	1063000	Heck, Viva Pinata, as you know, was announced to have an incubation coming out on the Nintendo
1063000	1064000	DS.
1064000	1065000	Guess what?
1065000	1067360	Blue Dragon is also on its way to the Nintendo DS.
1067360	1070400	Now, normally you'd kind of go, well, that doesn't seem like too big a surprise.
1070400	1072800	I mean, it kind of seems like the kind of game that could have been on the DS.
1072800	1078040	But when you consider that, you know, Mistwalker made it for Microsoft, it is kind of interesting
1078040	1082240	that the game is going to have an incubation on the DS.
1082240	1086360	This was coming from a recent issue of the manga Shonen Jump.
1086360	1087360	It's funny.
1087360	1091480	This is my Microsoft rep about Viva Pinata and who was publishing it.
1091480	1093480	He got on a plane and left.
1093480	1094480	Interesting.
1094480	1096280	He didn't have the answer for me.
1096280	1097280	Huh.
1097280	1100080	And then he got on a plane and left.
1100080	1101080	That was your answer.
1101080	1102080	I guess so.
1102080	1103080	The answer was...
1103080	1104080	He's like, look over there.
1104080	1105080	The answer was, what's that?
1105080	1106080	The answer was...
1106080	1107080	Run away.
1107080	1108080	Okay, thanks.
1108080	1109080	Bye.
1109080	1110080	For real.
1110080	1111080	I know.
1111080	1112080	Really.
1112080	1122080	There is a little speculation regarding Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass, and it was confirmed
1122080	1131120	that the producer, Eiji Aonuma, basically did agree that the game was a remake of the
1131120	1134000	very first Zelda game.
1134000	1137600	Or it must have started off that way, but it certainly hopefully hasn't ended up that
1137600	1138920	way, because I don't want to pony up that kind of money.
1138920	1143280	The game's already out, and I know people who play it who didn't say that it was just
1143280	1144280	like it.
1144280	1145280	But it was supposed to be...
1145280	1146280	What the crap?
1146280	1147280	Phantom Hourglass came out?
1147280	1148280	In Japan.
1148280	1149280	Oh, okay.
1149280	1150280	I had...
1150280	1151280	Remember, my friends have a...
1151280	1152280	Right, right, right.
1152280	1153280	Ninja Pass.
1153280	1154280	Sorry.
1154280	1155280	I was like, wait, wait, wait.
1155280	1156280	It came out over here?
1156280	1157280	I missed that.
1157280	1163520	But at any rate, it's saying that in his attempt to return to the root series, he unintentionally
1163520	1164840	remade the game.
1164840	1168840	So it's not really a complete remake.
1168840	1169840	It's more of like a...
1169840	1170840	An homage.
1170840	1171840	A spiritual remake.
1171840	1176960	When I hear that, though, I go, well, if it's an original, I don't know if I want it.
1176960	1177960	Well, I'm going to get it.
1177960	1178960	No, I know.
1178960	1179960	I'm going to get it, too.
1179960	1183840	Heck, even if it was a remake of the first game, I'd probably get it, because I'm a consumer
1183840	1184840	whore.
1184840	1185840	And how.
1185840	1186840	Exactly.
1186840	1194360	Anyways, so funny that you mention remakes, because the sex pixels are actually coming
1194360	1198680	together to re-record Anarchy in the UK.
1198680	1201560	And of course, this is going to be for Guitar Hero 3.
1201560	1203080	Why should you care?
1203080	1206580	Because it's a pretty cool song.
1206580	1207960	But yeah, they've come back together.
1207960	1210080	And it's the sex pistols getting back together.
1210080	1211400	That's kind of cool.
1211400	1212400	Exactly.
1212400	1217680	And so apparently they're going to be reissuing Anarchy in the UK, as well as part of the
1217680	1220020	celebration, they're going to be...
1220020	1223520	Our Guitar Hero 3 is going to be sponsoring the band's performance at the London Brixton
1223520	1226600	Academy on November 8th.
1226600	1227960	All in thanks to a video game.
1227960	1232200	Well, they're re-releasing, it's kind of co-advertising here.
1232200	1238600	It's basically, they're re-releasing their album, Nevermind the Bollocks.
1238600	1240480	Here's the Sex Pistols.
1240480	1245800	And that's coming out on the 29th, which is actually the day after Guitar Hero comes out
1245800	1246800	over here.
1246800	1248800	I don't know.
1248800	1255520	I don't know why they decided to re-record it, probably because it's good press.
1255520	1259040	Going to our chatroom, chat.orangetonsready.com, Dark Tetsuya asked, wasn't that in Guitar
1259040	1260040	Freaks at one point?
1260040	1263800	Yes it was, but it was a shitty cover of it was in the game.
1263800	1266760	But the real deal Sex Pistols are getting back together.
1266760	1270160	And you know, Anarchy in the UK is one of those songs that's just like fun to kick ass
1270160	1271160	to.
1271160	1272520	You know, it's a pretty ass kicking song.
1272520	1284440	When we think about kicking some ass, it inspires us to do the FUs of the Week.
1284440	1288360	Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off with tonight's FUs of the Week.
1288360	1299720	My FU of the Week goes towards, yeah, it's actually going to go to work, just in general.
1299720	1304500	I actually went and got my business license on Wednesday so that I can hopefully quit
1304500	1308400	my job and get to working at a spa, that'd be so nice.
1308400	1314680	And so it really, really just sort of made me realize how much more futile what I do
1314680	1315680	is.
1315680	1316680	So, FU to work.
1316680	1317680	Loki.
1317680	1325240	I'm FU'd the Bad Drivers, I was commuting back from Oakland today, and there are just
1325240	1331720	some people out there that don't really follow any of the laws of the road, in fact just
1331720	1332720	weave in and out.
1332720	1337320	I watched a truck almost flip itself because it turned so tight, you know, trying to go
1337320	1342960	between cars and stuff like that, so you know, there's just some people and there's a guy
1342960	1348720	with some riced up car or something that just decided, oh I'm going to just cut through
1348720	1356280	cars and stuff, no signal, no nothing, just trying to kill people, so fuck them.
1356280	1363040	I'm going to give an FU, sorry, one more thing, FU to the California Highway Patrol for stopping
1363040	1365800	the freeway, you morons!
1365800	1370120	So you know, they do all these things to stop people from speeding, so one of those things
1370120	1376360	apparently is to stop traffic on the freeway completely, all lanes at one time, because
1376360	1378280	that solves the problem.
1378280	1382820	No it doesn't, it causes more traffic, people become late and they speed more, you stupid
1382820	1383820	dumb fucks.
1383820	1384820	That's it.
1384820	1388640	That does seem like a little silly idea, unless there's an axe in the head or something.
1388640	1389640	No, they just.
1389640	1390640	For no reason?
1390640	1391640	No reason.
1391640	1392640	Just have fun.
1392640	1395640	We're bored today, let's screw with traffic.
1395640	1403240	My FU of the week goes to my ass, hear me out here for a minute, because I was a little
1403240	1409080	bit intoxicated, and I slipped and I fell on this chest that's in my room, this little
1409080	1412920	green, not a treasure chest, but a chest for clothes and stuff, I slipped and I fell right
1412920	1418600	on the corner of that, so my butt hit that corner, and now it's red and practically bruised.
1418600	1419600	I saw Rob's butt.
1419600	1423280	Yeah, I showed it to Jamie earlier, but only because I'm gay and she's a married woman,
1423280	1424280	so it's okay.
1424280	1425720	I gave Rob drugs.
1425720	1430840	Yeah, and she evaluated it and gave me some ibuprofen that was very strong.
1430840	1431840	Do you feel better?
1431840	1432840	I do, actually.
1432840	1434840	I don't feel it at all.
1434840	1436560	It's nice.
1436560	1440960	That's it for the FUs of the week, hooray.
1440960	1446040	Let's go back to some gaming news, and this is almost FU of the week worthy.
1446040	1453480	I found this on Digg, there's a site, EbizMBA, that tracks the top 25 gaming sites on the
1453480	1456360	internet, and Orange Launch Radio is nowhere to be found.
1456360	1457960	Well, of course.
1457960	1458960	That's just bullshit.
1458960	1463360	Okay, when was the last time we actually had news on our website?
1463360	1465960	Which by the way, oh, actually it was about that interview, we were supposed to have an
1465960	1471280	interview tonight, DMN did the interview, it was with a gal from Nintendo who got fired
1471280	1475760	over her blog, DMN actually interviewed her for their own show, STFU, which is on Thursdays
1475760	1479200	on the station, we were going to rebroadcast it because it's kind of an in the news current
1479200	1481160	thing that we thought you guys would be interested in.
1481160	1486520	Apparently their connection sucked, and the audio quality wasn't worth it to try and bring
1486520	1487520	it to you guys.
1487520	1490560	So we made an editorial decision to cut it out.
1490560	1492240	What about the guy that proposed over...
1492240	1495760	I didn't hear a fact from him on Myspace, I don't know, maybe he's listening.
1495760	1497640	We'll still have him on the show, call in.
1497640	1500520	Maybe if he's listening right now, we're going to have the Skype line later on the show,
1500520	1502480	we'll get to that, or anybody who wants to call in.
1502480	1506600	I think some of our New Yorkers that went to Digital Life are dying to get through tonight,
1506600	1510360	so we're going to hear from them a little later, but the 25 most popular video game
1510360	1511360	sites.
1511360	1516440	The number one video game site, according to this roster, which judges the top 25 by
1516440	1521960	the number of inbound links, the number of monthly visitors, the Quantcast monthly visitors,
1521960	1525800	I don't even know what that is, and the Alexa ranking, which by the way I think is bullshit.
1525800	1529480	I think you should not use, oh god, I fucking hate Alexa.
1529480	1532080	It's like one of the biggest plagues on the internet.
1532080	1534360	Who owns it, like Amazon or some shit?
1534360	1538520	All it is is a spyware bar that you basically have to install on your computer and it tracks
1538520	1540080	what websites you visit.
1540080	1546120	And they have the balls to release this ranking of the top sites based on who has this Alexa
1546120	1549120	toolbar installed.
1549120	1555040	That's not, because if you are anti-spyware, anti-toolbar, all this stuff, you probably
1555040	1559160	visit different sites than people who get suckered to putting this stuff on their computer.
1559160	1563280	Anyway, I could just go off all day, because one of the things I hate about Wikipedia is
1563280	1569440	that they use the Alexa ranking as some of their, as a site worthy to be on our page,
1569440	1573600	which how we've managed to keep our article up on Wikipedia for so long, I'll never be
1573600	1576200	able to figure that out.
1576200	1580960	But thank you all to the listeners who made that, but anyway, sorry, I get off my soapbox
1580960	1581960	there.
1581960	1586400	Top 25 sites, number one video game site, IGN.com, followed by GameSpot.com at number
1586400	1592280	two, GameFacts.com at number three, GamesRadar.com at number four, which kind of surprised me,
1592280	1599200	I'd never really heard of it until a few months ago, UGO.com at number five, GameSpy, CheatCC,
1599200	1605000	Kotaku, Yahoo Video Games, and GameTap rounding out the top 10.
1605000	1606920	File Front is a gaming site.
1606920	1609400	Apparently File Front is a gaming site, number 11.
1609400	1610960	File Planet?
1610960	1617200	Yeah, so some other big blogs, OneUp, who does a bunch of podcasts, they're number 13
1617200	1624760	on the list, Destructoid is number 20, Joystiq is number 19, and that's all I care to mention.
1624760	1626960	We're getting beat out by Strategy Informer.
1626960	1629840	Well, you know, life sucks sometimes.
1629840	1631600	Yeah, we don't have the budget.
1631600	1636240	I bet you all these people, none of these are, of course, independent sites, well maybe
1636240	1639640	Kotaku, I guess, and Joystiq, and Destructoid.
1639640	1644760	Well, yeah, I don't want to get into the politics of it all, yeah.
1644760	1645760	Yeah.
1645760	1646760	Anywho.
1646760	1649520	Yeah, some of the chat is asking, where's AllGames?
1649520	1652360	Nope, AllGames didn't make the top 25 either.
1652360	1655280	But AllGames doesn't really do news, you know, AllGames only shows.
1655280	1658240	I think if there were more to it, there might be more people going there.
1658240	1660320	Maybe someday.
1660320	1667240	I trust that we're at the top of our favorite sites.
1667240	1668240	And that's all I really care about.
1668240	1669800	That's all right, we're just underground, yo.
1669800	1671160	We're just underground.
1671160	1674800	We're way under the radar.
1674800	1678600	We're like underground at a bomb shelter.
1678600	1679600	That's right.
1679600	1680600	I'm not in a bomb shelter.
1680600	1682880	I'm in the land of awesome.
1682880	1688400	Anyway, speaking of something that could be awesome, but I sincerely doubt it, is that
1688400	1694440	there is a rumor about a Mortal Kombat game that will feature characters from the DC universe
1694440	1698720	trying to do a versus type of thing.
1698720	1701880	But yeah, I don't know how I feel about that.
1701880	1704800	In fact, I feel that it's going to be kind of dumb.
1704800	1705800	What is that?
1705800	1709120	A ramp I see there and a tank with sharks.
1709120	1710760	What's going to happen soon?
1710760	1711760	I wonder.
1711760	1720320	If they were going to do something awesome like Marvel vs. Capcom vs. DC Play-A-Rama.
1720320	1722200	Isn't that kind of what this is?
1722200	1725280	It's the answer to Marvel vs. Capcom, which is Street Fighter.
1725280	1729320	So instead of Marvel vs. Street Fighter, now you have DC vs. Mortal Kombat.
1729320	1731360	This makes perfect sense to me.
1731360	1734000	In fact, this reeks the fanboyism to me.
1734000	1735000	I don't even think it's true.
1735000	1738600	The difference between Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter is that Street Fighter is a good game.
1738600	1742960	First off, the next game that they're going to do is going to be a versus game.
1742960	1746520	They never said it was versus DC.
1746520	1747520	Although that would make sense.
1747520	1751080	To be honest, I think the Mortal Kombat series, DC, I don't think would go for it if you think
1751080	1752080	about it.
1752080	1756960	I mean, granted, I think DC vs. Street Fighter makes sense because it's more like comic book-y
1756960	1757960	and stuff.
1757960	1761200	But, Mortal Kombat is just kind of violent.
1761200	1763200	Well maybe they're going to change Mortal Kombat's adventure.
1763200	1771080	Mortal Kombat vs. Monsters of Horror or something like that, where they have Freddy and Jason
1771080	1772080	and shit like that.
1772080	1775280	You know why I like the Mortal Kombat games, especially the more recent one?
1775280	1778720	I like them because they have more than just the fighting game stuff in them.
1778720	1782560	Like the kart thing, the adventure modes.
1782560	1784120	The games have quite a bit of depth.
1784120	1785120	I don't know.
1785120	1787320	I mean, they're not like OMG drop everything.
1787320	1789280	They're no Soul Calibur 2, that's for sure.
1789280	1790280	But they're fun.
1790280	1791280	I don't know.
1791280	1794400	I think you guys are beating too hard on Mortal Kombat.
1794400	1795400	It's fun.
1795400	1797720	You guys are just tough to please.
1797720	1799520	I am tough to please.
1799520	1804040	Anyways, one game though that I do like is Saints Row.
1804040	1807960	And Saints Row 2 has been confirmed for PlayStation 3 and the 360.
1807960	1812160	Some of the changes coming with the brand new version of the game, of course it's going
1812160	1819960	to bring back Stillwater as well as including some improvements to the online game.
1819960	1827760	Both the online co-op now being added and multiplayer open world multiplayer matches.
1827760	1828760	That's kind of cool.
1828760	1833840	I mean, don't get me wrong, the multiplayer is okay, but I kind of wish that it was open
1833840	1839440	world like Grand Theft Auto on the PSP and stuff like that.
1839440	1847400	After a while, those three maps that you have for death match really get old.
1847400	1848400	It should be good.
1848400	1854240	You know what though, they set the bar pretty high for Grand Theft Auto so it would be kind
1854240	1860200	of cool to see them look at what Grand Theft Auto 4 did well and then improve on that.
1860200	1861200	Competition is always good.
1861200	1862200	It makes for better games.
1862200	1866920	Alright, well you could say one thing that's competing with DDR, although not really, is
1866920	1869000	Dance Online.
1869000	1874360	Dance Online is that dancing MMO that was created by David Perry who also made Earthworm
1874360	1878920	Jim and I think I played it a long time ago and I wasn't that impressed with it.
1878920	1882180	It didn't have a lot of songs that really grabbed me, but now I've got to go back and
1882180	1886840	take a look because Dance Online has gotten some updates and they have apparently made
1886840	1891200	some type of agreement with Warner Brothers Records or Warner Music.
1891200	1897180	There are now songs from Ashley Tisdale, The Ramones, The Click Five, 30 songs from Warner
1897180	1901000	Music also in the game now, Paris Hilton.
1901000	1902000	You know you want to...
1902000	1903000	What?
1903000	1904000	No, I don't.
1904000	1905000	Oh, no.
1905000	1910200	No, you want to also add more items to the shop for more customization.
1910200	1916780	Over 150 hairstyles and apparently the game has also added fresh dance mode to give fresh
1916780	1921680	dance modes giving some new challenges to the dancers in the game.
1921680	1925880	There's a new superstar mode where you try to rack up combos and break dance and then
1925880	1927320	reverse notes.
1927320	1931760	You have to hit the opposite keyboard or dance pad arrows that you normally would.
1931760	1934240	A little silly.
1934240	1935240	Yawn.
1935240	1936240	I don't know.
1936240	1937240	I'll check it out.
1937240	1938240	I'll check it out.
1938240	1940000	I think with some good music it could be fun.
1940000	1941000	I don't know.
1941000	1942000	Some folks in chat...
1942000	1944240	Dark Tetsuya says, Pass.
1944240	1947040	Mr. DeBucket says, David Perry for the lose.
1947040	1948040	Ouch.
1948040	1951440	Shadow Charlie says, Play Supernova 2 for Ashley Tisdale.
1951440	1954360	You know a sad time or a sad sign that things are changing.
1954360	1957880	You know how like our show started off like, you know, because we met all playing DDR.
1957880	1959440	We were all about the DDR.
1959440	1963720	Did you notice that not one but two new DDR games this week or DDR games came out this
1963720	1967240	week and did either of us bother to report on them at the top of the show in our gaming
1967240	1968240	weeks?
1968240	1969240	No.
1969240	1970240	We talked about it last week.
1970240	1971240	Yeah, but did you play them?
1971240	1972240	No, I didn't.
1972240	1973240	I'm just like, did you play them?
1973240	1974240	I'm waiting for my free coffees.
1974240	1975240	I mean, come on.
1975240	1976240	Oh, never mind.
1976240	1977240	Sorry.
1977240	1978240	A lot's changed in five years.
1978240	1985200	I mean, I just don't want to buy, well first off I'm not buying DDR Haas Party unless I
1985200	1987800	get it, you know, for free.
1987800	1990680	And then Supernova 2, I listened to the music.
1990680	1993240	I was disappointed with the Trip Machine remix.
1993240	1997440	It was crap, so.
1997440	2002360	And then, Ashley, is that your official review?
2002360	2004800	I did like the Fascination Max remix though.
2004800	2008880	That reminded me a lot of like Healing Vision and then Healing Vision Angelic, that kind
2008880	2011600	of remix of it.
2011600	2017920	And then, some of the songs though they didn't have ripped from it though, like Volcano I
2017920	2020600	didn't get to hear, but some of the other ones were okay.
2020600	2023800	I think though, I'll have to try it.
2023800	2027480	I want an actual machine to be out here though instead of having to play it on the Playstation
2027480	2028880	2.
2028880	2031000	But hopefully I'll get to play it soon.
2031000	2034640	Alright, well one thing we're going to get to do very soon is open up the mailbag.
2034640	2039320	That's right, you guys email us every week at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and we
2039320	2041640	read some of our favorites here on the program.
2041640	2049360	So DarkSakura, jump in the mailbag, pull out some letters, let's see what we got.
2049360	2057200	First email, dun dun dun, comes from, well, you didn't give a nickname so I'm just going
2057200	2058200	to say Erin.
2058200	2060200	Hi, first of all, I want to say I love the show.
2060200	2063320	It's the only podcast I listen to that doesn't ever bore me.
2063320	2065400	It's funny, entertaining, and informative.
2065400	2068480	As for Rob's comments about Facebook, I totally agree.
2068480	2074520	It's so annoying to log in and have like five invitations for apps that you don't care about.
2074520	2077760	I don't think that it's as bad as MySpace, but I do think Facebook is headed in that
2077760	2078760	direction.
2078760	2081600	I got a Facebook too and I hate it.
2081600	2087960	I mean, I do kind of like getting the notifications on my phone sometimes, but that shit gets
2087960	2088960	old.
2088960	2093120	Anyway, to continue, I also have a few comments on Halo 3.
2093120	2095680	I love the first game, it's the reason I bought an Xbox.
2095680	2099160	I was disappointed in Halo 2 and not long after Halo 2, I stopped telling people that
2099160	2108080	I played it because I didn't want them to think I was a stupid frat boy.
2108080	2111280	I eventually stopped playing Halo 2 with anyone I didn't know because of the ignorant people
2111280	2112880	on Xbox Live.
2112880	2116960	I'm excited for Halo 3, but I won't be going to the midnight release because of the people
2116960	2118640	that will be there.
2118640	2123760	I think the Halo series started out well and the games are still solid, but the atmosphere
2123760	2128080	surrounding the games has dissolved into one blatant commercialism and poor sportsmanship,
2128080	2129080	for lack of a better word.
2129080	2130080	Love this show, guys.
2130080	2131080	Keep it up.
2131080	2132080	Aaron?
2132080	2136240	Yeah, I seem to remember we were talking about last week, you know, who's actually going
2136240	2138000	to the midnight release.
2138000	2139880	Do we hear from anyone who actually went?
2139880	2144360	This guy said he wanted to go, but all right.
2144360	2148720	Shall I move forward to the next one, Rob?
2148720	2149720	You may.
2149720	2156000	Hello, dudes and chicks, I'm playing Worms 2 Up in Warfare on my PSP 2000, and I'm naming
2156000	2157720	the worms on my custom team.
2157720	2162440	I tried to name one of my worms Star Drifter, but when the worm shows up in the game, his
2162440	2167000	name appears as S-X-X-X-X-Ifter.
2167000	2172400	No matter how many times I try to rename him or a new team with the worm Star Drifter,
2172400	2176480	it automatically changes to S-X-X-X-X-Ifter.
2176480	2177640	Any idea why this is?
2177640	2180160	Yeah, because T-A-R-D is T.A.R.D.
2180160	2184040	Yeah, T.A.R.D. is slang for retard, which is a naughty word.
2184040	2188880	They also censored death because I had a team death something.
2188880	2190120	Can you play this online?
2190120	2191120	No.
2191120	2192120	You play Wi-Fi.
2192120	2195360	Well, then why bother censoring it?
2195360	2197840	The person's got to be in the room with you.
2197840	2199040	I don't get it.
2199040	2200040	That's overdoing it.
2200040	2201040	That's from Darkraven.
2201040	2202040	That's overdoing it.
2202040	2206240	No, it's being censored because I guess T.A.R.D. is a bad word, and so anything with that
2206240	2208260	in it, you know.
2208260	2211160	What if you wanted to name your character Compass?
2211160	2214440	Compass has the word ass in it, so you know, you can't do that.
2214440	2215440	It's messed up.
2215440	2219640	It would be comp, compa, and maybe com is a bad word too.
2219640	2220640	Who knows?
2220640	2221640	Calm.
2221640	2222640	It depends on how it's spelled.
2222640	2223640	Calm.
2223640	2224640	Anyway, this one comes from A.Z.H.P.
2224640	2225640	Hey, O.L.R.
2225640	2226640	Crew.
2226640	2231140	Last week on your show you discussed Loki's bet that he would dress up as Tingle while
2231140	2235260	burning the Eye of Judgment, and since it comes out on October 23rd, six months from
2235260	2239120	then, that would be April 23rd, which is my birthday.
2239120	2243560	I just wanted to say how great a birthday present it would be if it ended up happening.
2243560	2245840	Looking forward to the Eye of Judgment hitting the one million mark.
2245840	2249240	Unfortunately, I won't be contributing to that one million because I don't have a PS3
2249240	2250240	in it.
2250240	2251240	Oh yeah, the Eye of Judgment is crap.
2251240	2256840	Oh yeah, since you guys love lolcat so much, here's the Geometry Wars galaxy ad for the
2256840	2257840	Wii.
2257840	2267440	Yeah, but that was actually linked from the GW Cats thing that you gave me that was going
2267440	2269440	to be my side of the week.
2269440	2275880	Well, let's take a minute to talk about Galaxy Wars Cats.
2275880	2278840	Genius marketing campaign, those folks at Geometry Wars Galaxy.
2278840	2282520	Have you seen the site gwgcats.com?
2282520	2287380	Somebody's taken the lolcats trend and made an advertising campaign out of it.
2287380	2291920	I think the advertising campaign for Geometry Wars Galaxies is brilliant because you can
2291920	2292920	even watch the commercial.
2292920	2293920	Wait, hold on.
2293920	2294920	I'm going to go to the site.
2294920	2295920	I'm sorry.
2295920	2297760	I don't care if I sound like a consumer whore, but you know what?
2297760	2302800	I've seen so many lame video game commercials, and you might think this is lame, but I don't
2302800	2303800	care.
2303800	2304800	I think it's funny.
2304800	2306280	They have this in theaters.
2306280	2307280	This is so great.
2307280	2311160	There's Geometry Wars and they have all these things like, I'm in your solar system on top
2311160	2315720	of your leaderboards, I'm in your battle grids, topping your highest score, and just all this
2315720	2316720	funny stuff.
2316720	2321280	And then if you actually go to the website for Geometry Wars Galaxies, the little trailer
2321280	2325920	for the game has a remake of Particle Man, which is so awesome.
2325920	2326920	Hold on.
2326920	2329760	I got to play a little clip of the song from the trailer.
2329760	2332520	This is from Geometry Wars Galaxies dot com slash us.
2332520	2336720	Particle Man, Particle Man, doing the things of Particle Man.
2336720	2337720	What's he like?
2337720	2338720	It's not important.
2338720	2339720	Particle Man, is he a dot?
2339720	2340720	Or is he his back?
2340720	2341720	When he's in the water, does he get wet?
2341720	2348360	Or does the water get him instead?
2348360	2349360	Because get it?
2349360	2353240	Because it's like Triangle Man and, I don't know, it's funny.
2353240	2354240	That's great.
2354240	2355240	Is that They Might Be Giants?
2355240	2356240	No.
2356240	2358640	It's like, oh, unless they redid the song, it's definitely not the original.
2358640	2361680	Well, I mean, I was going to say, because the voice was kind of...
2361680	2362680	A little bit.
2362680	2363680	Could have been.
2363680	2364680	Yeah.
2364680	2365680	Great.
2365680	2366680	Love it.
2366680	2369520	Well, then the next email then, if you are ready.
2369520	2374880	Actually, real quickly, I just want to say, Black Wolf, of course, our old buddy Bobby
2374880	2378360	B's in chat right now, and he does his own show, of course, on All Games.
2378360	2382040	It also airs on Sunday nights, and sometimes when he's done with his show, he'll come listen
2382040	2386480	to ours for a little bit, because he's awesome, and he says, oh, man, that email was a mass
2386480	2387680	email to a lot of podcasts.
2387680	2391740	I think he said that about the last email, the one about the Worms 2.
2391740	2395360	So somebody is like mass emailing podcasts with the same question.
2395360	2396540	Amazing.
2396540	2397540	We got spammed.
2397540	2402000	I wonder if they're trying to see if the different podcasts give different answers of some type
2402000	2403000	of survey.
2403000	2407400	Well, then, I wonder if they're spamming all the podcasts about whether their penis needs
2407400	2409920	to be larger, too, because...
2409920	2414320	Or maybe they're trying to spam all the podcasts with a Worms 2 email, so people will actually
2414320	2415800	talk about Worms 2 on the podcast.
2415800	2417040	There's apparently people who think that...
2417040	2418040	We just bought it.
2418040	2419040	Hook, line, and sinker.
2419040	2422800	There's a bunch of people who think that I need a bigger penis, too, apparently, in my
2422800	2423800	email.
2423800	2426440	So we actually deleted my email address.
2426440	2428320	So I don't think it'll work, but good luck.
2428320	2429320	You never know.
2429320	2434640	Well, if they get them back, then they have auto-delete things or some shit.
2434640	2436800	I'm actually thinking about changing it anyway.
2436800	2437800	Yeah.
2437800	2438800	All right.
2438800	2440800	But anyway, next email now, please, please, please, please.
2440800	2441800	Yes, yes, yes.
2441800	2442800	Can I has email, Rob?
2442800	2444920	Yes, you can has email.
2444920	2448560	Last episode, look, you said nothing is original anymore.
2448560	2449560	Originality is hard to find.
2449560	2453960	One of my favorite quotes is from one of my design teachers is, you are only as original
2453960	2456400	as your sources are obscure.
2456400	2457600	Ones are the same as design.
2457600	2460080	I do agree with that.
2460080	2463820	I was listening to episode nine of Game Theory about emotional responses to video games and
2463820	2468520	how the design aspect can begin there to create a better game, and it reminded me of my own
2468520	2470560	reactions to certain games or events in games.
2470560	2473840	Like, the first time I played through Symphony of the Night, I beat Belmont at the end, and
2473840	2474960	I thought, cool, whatever.
2474960	2477080	I had no idea about the extra gameplay.
2477080	2480640	I was bored a few weeks later, so I had to play through it again, but thoroughly this
2480640	2481640	time.
2481640	2484720	So when I defeated the green orb this time, the exact words out of my mouth was, what
2484720	2486920	the crap?
2486920	2491440	Talk about a reward for good gaming or the end for Final Fantasy II in the U.S.
2491440	2493640	That's Final Fantasy IV overseas.
2493640	2495760	The page turning with the great music, it was incredible.
2495760	2499160	I sat and smiled contentedly for a good half an hour.
2499160	2504120	I can actually say the same thing about Final Fantasy III over here when it came out, was
2504120	2508880	that I actually finally decided to wait and be patient and wait for Shadow to catch up
2508880	2514680	with you so that he doesn't die, spoiler, and got the ending with everybody alive.
2514680	2517000	That made me happy.
2517000	2518660	Even retarded GoGo.
2518660	2521840	I was missing somebody when I first beat Final Fantasy III.
2521840	2522840	It wasn't Shadow.
2522840	2524880	I actually thought to wait around for Shadow.
2524880	2525960	I got everybody.
2525960	2530960	I want to say, I was missing, like somebody really, like Gao or somebody I was like really
2530960	2531960	weird I was missing.
2531960	2534720	Well no, you couldn't play through without Gao.
2534720	2536140	Then who was I missing?
2536140	2539560	Your extra characters were Umaru and GoGo.
2539560	2540560	The stupid mimic?
2540560	2544020	No, isn't there a way that you can actually get all the way to the very last tower with
2544020	2545200	only three people?
2545200	2549600	You have to have Celes, you have to have Edgar, and you have to have one other person.
2549600	2550600	I think Locke.
2550600	2551600	Terra.
2551600	2552600	Is it?
2552600	2553600	No, I think you can go and skip Terra.
2553600	2557200	I mean, it makes no sense for the story, but remember how you could access the last tower
2557200	2558200	really early on?
2558200	2562220	Terra was like the first character you play in the game.
2562220	2568320	But then after the game resets, when it goes into World of Ruin, you start as Celes, remember?
2568320	2569320	That is true.
2569320	2571320	So, it was weird.
2571320	2574440	Well, at any rate, now I look for these things.
2574440	2577680	I want to care about my characters on normal story-based games.
2577680	2578960	It's not always easy to find.
2578960	2584600	I get by these days with a good triple Winfury crit on any gnome anywhere, or seriously just
2584600	2589000	killing anything alliance, but that kind of quick fix can't replace the more in-depth
2589000	2590240	stuff.
2590240	2593840	What are some of the moments that got you guys all teary eyed or made you jump like
2593840	2594840	an idiot?
2594840	2598520	Oh, and let's hear it for the gamers, spelled G-A-Y-M-E-R-S.
2598520	2600440	Apparently Seattle is the gamer mecha.
2600440	2601440	Really?
2601440	2603040	And that comes from No Soul Boy.
2603040	2605240	I knew there was a reason I liked Seattle.
2605240	2610400	No, let's see, games that got me, well, okay, games that got me a jump would be Silent Hill,
2610400	2612900	like any of them.
2612900	2618520	Games that got me all teary- Well, I actually cared when Aris died in Final Fantasy VII
2618520	2619520	on one of my co-hosts.
2619520	2620520	I cheered.
2620520	2621520	You're a bitch.
2621520	2622520	I'm not a bitch.
2622520	2628000	I hated her the entire fucking game, and oh my God, I hated her, and I was so happy when
2628000	2629000	she died.
2629000	2630000	I was sad.
2630000	2632240	Actually, I got verklempt when that happened.
2632240	2635560	Actually, I got a little verklempt playing Eternal Sonata the other day.
2635560	2637560	That game's sad.
2637560	2639780	It's about all these dying kids and stuff.
2639780	2640780	It's kind of sad.
2640780	2645840	I laughed my ass off during the bitch slap fight in Final Fantasy VII between Scarlet
2645840	2653440	and Tifa, and oh God, there was a game though that made me completely freaking ball, and
2653440	2658160	I couldn't remember what it was because it was a few years ago.
2658160	2663960	I do know one game that completely cracked me up, and that was- Now, crap, I can't remember
2663960	2671280	the name of it, but it had the girl with the red pigtails, and she used the rings, the
2671280	2675240	chakram for her weapons, and you could play as either the girl or the boy, and it had
2675240	2681720	a really cool name in Japan, and then it came out with Winds of Fate in the US, but that
2681720	2687440	game had lots of crack-me-up bunny moments because she was just over the top, but I can't
2687440	2690720	remember the game that made me freaking ball like a baby though.
2690720	2694400	It was like people dying in the game.
2694400	2695400	Mario is missing.
2695400	2697920	I just, I can't believe it's missing.
2697920	2702920	I'll tell you what recently though- I can't believe it, please, I can't find him.
2702920	2709840	I'll tell you what recently made me so annoyed was watching on YouTube, asshole Mario, just
2709840	2713320	people go to YouTube and look up asshole Mario.
2713320	2716240	That was awesome talent, I love asshole Mario.
2716240	2721280	It's people who what they did is took Super Mario Brothers and did ROM hacks with it to
2721280	2725660	make these intensely hard levels, and the thing about these hard levels is that they
2725660	2727800	are not unplayable.
2727800	2734940	You can beat them, but you have to have the mad skills to do it and time and patience
2734940	2736280	and be willing to die.
2736280	2742560	The only thing that's annoying about the asshole Mario levels is that they keep showing people
2742560	2747480	dying over and over and over again, and what they should do is just show someone playing
2747480	2750040	through the level and then show them dying.
2750040	2755280	My favorite was how they showed one at just the very start of the game, and the very first
2755280	2759840	level the guy goes into, he goes into the level and then there's a bullet machine that
2759840	2760840	shoots him in the face.
2760840	2761840	Right when the level starts.
2761840	2765320	Or the womps that land directly on him.
2765320	2769580	The very first level where it does the little happy music, it starts with a womp falling
2769580	2773720	on him, and you have to find the secret hidden block.
2773720	2779920	The best thing is, and I was actually discussing this with Sauce the other day, is that when
2779920	2784240	they have the uber long jumps and the guy's timing it perfectly, and then he jumps and
2784240	2786960	hits a brick and lands in the hole.
2786960	2788760	It's like an invisible coin block.
2788760	2791560	Anyway, back to the email, shall I?
2791560	2792560	Yes.
2792560	2793560	Okay.
2793560	2796900	This is addressed to me, and then you guys in parentheses.
2796900	2798360	This is Rob with two Bs, by the way.
2798360	2799360	Who's it from?
2799360	2800360	I just told you, Rob.
2800360	2802840	Oh, hi, Rob and two Bs.
2802840	2809440	There's a little war of words going on between a site called Game Twat, I think that's great,
2809440	2814720	it just gets funnier each time you think slash say it, and game politics, as well as GP versus
2814720	2820700	Jackie Poo, and it's being taken way too seriously by GP readers.
2820700	2826000	In a GT post on a GP survey involving a Jackie Poo interview, what's more, you'd think by
2826000	2830520	naming a site Game Twat would sort of imply people that it's not meant to be taken 100%
2830520	2833260	seriously, but I guess that sort of skips people by.
2833260	2836400	I've heard of Game Cock, but I've never heard of Game Twat.
2836400	2840540	Game Cock is a publisher, or a developer.
2840540	2844720	I think people need to lighten up and realize how we secretly enjoy the antics between Jackie
2844720	2846520	Poo and GP butting heads.
2846520	2848640	GT is funny if you let it.
2848640	2853200	I personally believe that porn court filing's story on Jackie Poo was his attempt to show
2853200	2857660	the judge was biased against him in the case versus the Florida Bar.
2857660	2860820	Mission accomplished, but now the legal system is against him.
2860820	2865200	Sorry for the misquote, but if you strike Jackie Poo down, he'll become stronger than
2865200	2866200	ever.
2866200	2871040	I'd rather we adopt a meh attitude and maybe he'll start eating crayons as recreational
2871040	2872040	drugs.
2872040	2873040	Rob Bubba.
2873040	2880320	And he wrote Bubba afterwards.
2880320	2885400	This Game Twat site looks like Perez Hilton.
2885400	2890600	It's awfully pink, and that joystick looks like a cock.
2890600	2894300	Black Wolf in chat says something interesting, he says, wow, Game Twat is getting really
2894300	2895640	too much publicity over this.
2895640	2898480	So what's the debate?
2898480	2900000	What are they mad at each other about?
2900000	2904640	I don't get it.
2904640	2907640	Hold on, I'm trying to figure this out, because Game Twat interviewed him.
2907640	2910800	I can't believe he would have interviewed with a site called Game Twat.
2910800	2912720	What the hell?
2912720	2916720	Hi, we're with Game Twat, we want to interview you.
2916720	2921080	Whatever, I don't want to get involved in the drama.
2921080	2924720	It's more publicity for both sites, I mean, we just reported on it, congratulations to
2924720	2925900	both sites.
2925900	2928000	We need to start a fight with somebody.
2928000	2929160	Who can we start a fight with?
2929160	2930160	How about all games?
2930160	2931160	Ah, that's too obvious.
2931160	2932160	How about Bobby?
2932160	2934160	Bobby, we're going to start a fight with you, is that okay?
2934160	2935160	That's too obvious.
2935160	2937040	It's too obvious if we start a fight with somebody.
2937040	2939280	I'll start a fight with you, you want to make some noise?
2939280	2943480	What about the developer of The Eye of Judgment?
2943480	2944480	I don't know.
2944480	2945480	Who's the developer?
2945480	2946480	Well, I don't know where we are.
2946480	2949880	Chat, send us an email, let us know who we should get in a fight with.
2949880	2952320	Yes, chat room, who should we start a fight with?
2952320	2954920	We'll say something really nasty about some other show.
2954920	2955920	PM Rob.
2955920	2956920	Let us know who.
2956920	2957920	PM Rob with your answers.
2957920	2958920	Yes, please do.
2958920	2964420	Okay, to report from the Afro guy, hey, OLR, I wanted to make a correction to that rather
2964420	2967720	formal review of Earth Defense Forces sent in last week.
2967720	2971520	There are more enemy types than just ants in the game, but it turns out they're the
2971520	2972560	best.
2972560	2975800	By the way, having played Metal Slug Anthology this week, I agree with Loki that every Metal
2975800	2978960	Slug game is exactly the same, even if they are really fun.
2978960	2983160	Enemies, weapons, and even goddamn mini-bosses are repeated.
2983160	2984160	You know what?
2984160	2990040	So you can get turned into undead in the later ones.
2990040	2994240	To continue, last one, dun, dun, dun.
2994240	2998600	Hi, OLR people, this is Mori again.
2998600	3002280	Earlier this week, I was able to get a Wii with money from various sources, and so far
3002280	3004120	I've been enjoying it immensely.
3004120	3007960	My house has been lacking in a home version of DDR for quite some time, so I splurged
3007960	3013000	and picked up the new DDR Hottest Party bundle that came out Tuesday, I think.
3013000	3014000	Anywho.
3014000	3016720	The game's, in a nutshell, excellent.
3016720	3019240	It's easily the best DDR home version in a while.
3019240	3024160	The song list is a tad shorter than the average game, by about 50 total, but most of the songs
3024160	3025360	are actually fun to play.
3025360	3029600	About half of it consists of licenses, they're all covers, but the range and quality from
3029600	3032280	good to questionable.
3032280	3034520	For some reason, the 80s ones tend to be the most fun.
3034520	3037900	Blue Monday by New Order is the first one that comes to mind.
3037900	3040760	The original songs in the game are pretty awesome, too.
3040760	3045280	Furthermore, whoever did the step charts for this game needs to stay around forever.
3045280	3047760	There's a wide range of difficulty.
3047760	3052400	A couple of genuine ten-footers in the other charts are fun without being mind-numbingly
3052400	3053400	boring.
3053400	3057800	The Wii remote motions are kind of hard to get the hang of, though, and the game doesn't
3057800	3061280	give you any advice besides swinging the controller.
3061280	3064520	As far as I can tell, the best way to do it is to hold the remote and nunchuck in front
3064520	3066480	of you vertically and swing them forward.
3066480	3069840	Oh, and the new Love Shine remix is rad.
3069840	3071400	Finally, a quick question.
3071400	3073120	What other Wii games are good at the moment?
3073120	3074120	I'm into quirky stuff.
3074120	3075120	Cheers, Mori.
3075120	3078640	Um, I still love Trauma Center.
3078640	3083560	If you really want quirky, escape from Bug Island.
3083560	3084560	That's really quirky.
3084560	3085880	Quirky games?
3085880	3091140	Dip into the retro archive and go play some old stuff, because seriously, some developers
3091140	3093720	back in the day were smoking crack.
3093720	3096720	Who would have thought that a game about a loom would be so awesome?
3096720	3097720	Loom is awesome.
3097720	3098720	I know.
3098720	3099720	That's what I'm saying.
3099720	3100820	Loom is fucking rad.
3100820	3101940	Go back in the archive.
3101940	3102940	Play some old-school stuff.
3102940	3103940	Seriously.
3103940	3104940	Good times.
3104940	3105940	Well, that's it for the email.
3105940	3108800	Bobby Black Wolf in chat, boy, he's getting a lot of FaceTime tonight.
3108800	3109800	See?
3109800	3111480	Because of the fight.
3111480	3116080	And he commented on our fight, the possible fight between OLR and Black Wolf.
3116080	3122280	He says, we tried to fight, however, Loki refused to play ChromeHounds, so I won by
3122280	3123280	default.
3123280	3125680	Dude, it was like me and some other person.
3125680	3128120	I think I'd already sold my copy back.
3128120	3133040	Uh, GS68 says also that we should be fighting with Bobby Black Wolf, but see, that doesn't
3133040	3134040	work.
3134040	3137840	This suggests that we should have a fight with Tekken Games.
3137840	3141040	You know, Raven's Dolphins show, because he always calls it this show and he has his own
3141040	3144960	thing, the Tekken Games, which is like number three on Op 11 or something like that.
3144960	3146880	It's just crazy.
3146880	3149240	Which just proves people watch anything.
3149240	3153320	See, I'm starting a little fight, starting a little fight.
3153320	3155320	Just kidding, Raven, if you're listening.
3155320	3157120	Hugs and kisses.
3157120	3158120	Let's see.
3158120	3162640	Oh, and then Black Wolf suggested that we fight one up.
3162640	3164120	And I'm like, that fight.
3164120	3165800	I would fight him with a cricket bat.
3165800	3168320	That fight's so 2006.
3168320	3170680	I'm over my issues with one up.
3170680	3172680	I'm over my issues.
3172680	3174680	Whatever.
3174680	3179120	I guess so we can't fight anybody, so we have to love everybody.
3179120	3181120	Hugs and kisses all around.
3181120	3183760	We love everyone.
3183760	3187560	The Nintendo Wii Online Development staff, how about that?
3187560	3188560	Let's fight them.
3188560	3190360	No, but we need a good fight.
3190360	3193400	Like a really good bang up fight that people will report on.
3193400	3199680	Because it's like, you know, O.L.R. threatened to kill somebody's family or something.
3199680	3200680	Camp threatened to kill families.
3200680	3201680	That's illegal.
3201680	3202680	I know.
3202680	3203680	It is illegal.
3203680	3204680	Alright.
3204680	3209520	We need to get some really good dirt on somebody and start a fight with them.
3209520	3211520	It'd be good for publicity.
3211520	3212520	Can you work on that, Loki?
3212520	3214440	You have ties in dark places.
3214440	3216960	Get some dirt on another cast.
3216960	3218600	Alright, anyway.
3218600	3223120	Yeah, don't you know, I'm just like the fucking sleuth.
3223120	3225560	Alright, then get some news.
3225560	3226560	God.
3226560	3232600	Anyways, so, you know, when I'm not digging up dirt, apparently, we're going to be talking
3232600	3234160	about Square Enix.
3234160	3236280	And they're focusing on overseas.
3236280	3240480	Yeah, that's a surprise.
3240480	3245240	I guess, you know, of course, since they're only known, well, Square Enix is mainly known
3245240	3246960	for the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest series.
3246960	3249960	A lot of other stuff that they used to do, unfortunately.
3249960	3251560	Never saw remixes.
3251560	3253400	I really want Einhänder.
3253400	3260920	But now, apparently, they're going to be focusing on overseas markets that have increased more
3260920	3265360	than to three times the size of the Japanese market.
3265360	3266360	Thank God.
3266360	3270360	Maybe that means we'll actually get Final Fantasy XIII in a timely manner.
3270360	3275680	Instead of having to wait for Japan to get it and then us getting it way afterwards.
3275680	3280640	So they had, apparently, two strategies planned to seize the opportunities.
3280640	3288240	First, they're, of course, going to increase their distribution channel ties throughout,
3288240	3291760	you know, both the United States and, I believe, in Europe.
3291760	3300800	And of course, the second is, you know, developing more titles overall.
3300800	3302920	So it's pretty cool.
3302920	3305420	Alright, well, we here at the Orange Lounge.
3305420	3309960	You think we'd be really excited about the Orange Box, but I know there's a lot of our
3309960	3311960	listeners who are excited about the Orange Box.
3311960	3312960	I am excited about the Orange Box.
3312960	3314980	It's not games I usually play.
3314980	3316360	Maybe I should be more excited about it.
3316360	3317360	Portal!
3317360	3318360	Come on.
3318360	3321200	Alright, well, the Orange Box has officially gone gold.
3321200	3322200	And it's coming out.
3322200	3325840	You know, the only thing that I wish this would have in it is Gary's mod.
3325840	3333200	$59.99 on the 360, $49.99 on the PC, Half-Life 2, 1 and 2, Team Fortress 2, and, as Loki
3333200	3335480	said, Portal, all in the Orange Box.
3335480	3338840	Well maybe this is the perfect opportunity for me to check it out, because I, you know,
3338840	3344360	haven't really played Half-Life a whole lot, I mean a little bit, but, you know, I don't
3344360	3347720	play a lot of these first person shooters and stuff, so.
3347720	3351620	If you're going to buy it, Loki, then I'll check it out when you get it.
3351620	3354600	But it's gone gold, so those of you guys that are excited about it, I know there's a couple
3354600	3357640	of people on my Twitter that are really excited about the Orange Box.
3357640	3359780	It's on its way very soon.
3359780	3362120	So take a look for it.
3362120	3367040	Well, I can't say that I'm too excited about this bit of news, because honestly I don't
3367040	3369400	give a crap about it.
3369400	3374840	But some people are happy about it, so for anyone who's interested in the Sam & Max series,
3374840	3381900	season 2 will be on GameTap starting November 8th for those who have subscribed for it.
3381900	3387280	And it has Ice Station Santa.
3387280	3391580	For the person who emailed earlier about the quirky games, here you go, Sam & Max.
3391580	3394240	I think this is a good little quirky game.
3394240	3395240	Fun to play.
3395240	3396240	Enjoy.
3396240	3397240	You don't like Sam & Max?
3397240	3398240	I never got into it.
3398240	3399240	Oh, it's fun.
3399240	3400240	It's cute.
3400240	3404560	And funny.
3404560	3410840	And I like how it's the only episodic game I can think of that actually stayed, like
3410840	3413120	actually continued to put out episodes.
3413120	3417660	Like most episodic games you hear about die after two episodes, you know what I mean?
3417660	3418660	Shenmue.
3418660	3419660	What?
3419660	3424160	Shenmue was supposed to be a series of, they're supposed to have a whole line of them giving
3424160	3426480	episodes of What's-His-Face's Quest.
3426480	3433080	But see somebody just, you know, it pooped and quit along the way, and this Sam & Max
3433080	3436520	has been going for a long time.
3436520	3439760	So hooray to it being a good episodic game.
3439760	3445480	I did not drop my microphone.
3445480	3446480	So.
3446480	3452240	Alright, we're going to open the Skype line very soon if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR
3452240	3457680	or our username on Skype, Orangelaunchradio, but one more story before we get to that.
3457680	3463560	Yes, anyways, so it's a little bit disappointing because this was one of the big features of
3463560	3471680	Unreal Tournament 3 for PlayStation 3, but no cross-platform play.
3471680	3475240	It was apparently too hard to make, so they scrapped it.
3475240	3479280	So you'll only be able to play people on the PC if you have the PC version, and only be
3479280	3485360	able to play people on the PlayStation 3 if you have the PlayStation 3 version.
3485360	3486600	So sad.
3486600	3489520	So people on PCs cannot play people on PlayStation 3s.
3489520	3490520	That's correct.
3490520	3491720	And it's kind of sad.
3491720	3492720	That's a bummer.
3492720	3496980	Alright, well we are going to open up the Skype line over at Orangelaunchradio.com.
3496980	3503340	Our username, of course, is Orangelaunchradio on Skype, or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3503340	3507040	Let's open up the Skype line and see who can get on through.
3507040	3509440	Hello, you're on Orangelaunchradio.
3509440	3510440	Who's this?
3510440	3513240	It's the one and only Legend of Zaku.
3513240	3514760	Hello, Legend of Zaku.
3514760	3517360	What's on your mind, my friend?
3517360	3521600	Just dealing with the aftermath of digital life this weekend, especially the tourney.
3521600	3525700	I was hoping some of the New Yorkers would call in and tell us all about digital life.
3525700	3528300	I didn't get a chance to go.
3528300	3530600	As you know, I wanted to go and I didn't get to go.
3530600	3535400	Somebody on my Twitter said, not that I should be thankful I didn't go, but that it wasn't
3535400	3536400	that good to show.
3536400	3537400	You should be glad that you didn't go.
3537400	3538400	Ooh, snap.
3538400	3542680	Let's just say a lot of drama is... Oh shit, what happened?
3542680	3544280	What happened, Zaku?
3544280	3547120	Okay, I just want to make this a short story.
3547120	3552320	I don't want to get people entangled in the current affairs of our community.
3552320	3553320	Wait, hold on.
3553320	3554320	Hold on.
3554320	3555320	Hold on, Zaku.
3555320	3556320	Wait, hold on.
3556320	3558080	Remember we were talking about that fight earlier?
3558080	3559080	Here we go.
3559080	3560680	We have to start a fight right here.
3560680	3561680	Okay.
3561680	3562680	All right.
3562680	3567720	To sum it up, basically the biggest complaints right now were regarding freestyle and the
3567720	3571040	way the rest of the other tournaments were run.
3571040	3576900	Basically the... All right, for starters, the way freestyle turned out, in other words,
3576900	3584720	people accusing the judges of favoritism and people pissing and moaning on why certain
3584720	3592120	of their favorite freestylers didn't place at all and there was a lot of name calling.
3592120	3601640	A lot of... It even got to the point where one of the players from Expert Tech actually
3601640	3608760	cursed out one of the organizers right there and he got de-cued but then ended up staying
3608760	3612800	after apologizing.
3612800	3614800	Never mind, it's Dance Dance Revolution drama.
3614800	3615800	Nobody's going to care about that.
3615800	3616800	No, no, no.
3616800	3617800	We have to start a fight somewhere else.
3617800	3618800	What?
3618800	3620280	I can email Jackie Poo for you.
3620280	3621280	That's all right.
3621280	3628120	That same guy, mind you, he also cursed out one of the other organizers who also freestyled
3628120	3631320	there on Saturday and who I happen to know personally.
3631320	3636920	He just basically... Yeah, he called him out for racism for his body appearance.
3636920	3637920	Oh, boy.
3637920	3639880	It was just really nasty.
3639880	3641920	It was shit-load of like...
3641920	3647720	So, somebody was cursing out some other guy at Digital Life throwing race and all this
3647720	3649520	other stuff into it and they didn't get ejected?
3649520	3650520	Yeah, race factor.
3650520	3651520	They didn't get ejected?
3651520	3657880	His appearance because he's a big guy, it's just a lot of immature bullshit that's just
3657880	3660560	spanning four pages on the freak right now.
3660560	3662840	I don't want to get into it because it's...
3662840	3663840	Okay, so fine.
3663840	3665960	Go to DDR Freak for your DDR drama.
3665960	3669920	However, did this ruin Digital Life single-handedly to one little fight ruin the show?
3669920	3670920	How did that go down?
3670920	3675960	Well, it turned out pretty good and there was a lot of people that really complimented
3675960	3681320	and really praised the organizers for running it.
3681320	3687800	The pad misses were another issue that certain people had sour grapes over.
3687800	3695480	The way it was set up was that the machines were on the stage and since the stage itself
3695480	3701760	is not as secure as something like the ground, they have no choice but to put it up there.
3701760	3705920	They have no saying in where the machines are actually placed.
3705920	3719800	Zaku, if I didn't know better, I think Digital Life is one giant DDR machine.
3719800	3722160	No, it's not even that.
3722160	3724240	It's just... Let's just put it this way.
3724240	3729920	Pad misses were just caused by the instability of the stage, just having all the machines
3729920	3736800	and people up there and the sensors just going off like that.
3736800	3741640	That was one of the biggest complaints by certain people.
3741640	3746240	They agreed with the judgment calls because there were many... The people running and
3746240	3752720	taking down the scores were very, very meticulous in making sure that whatever score was received
3752720	3759360	was the fairest and most accurate score out there received.
3759360	3764000	Tell me one thing in Digital Life that was cool that has nothing to do with DDR.
3764000	3765000	Guitar Hero 3.
3765000	3769020	It's all right though, but I mean... Music game.
3769020	3770020	It's fine.
3770020	3772040	He was within the confines of the question.
3772040	3773040	That's fine.
3773040	3774040	All right.
3774040	3775040	Guitar Hero 3, how was it?
3775040	3776040	It was all right.
3776040	3780280	I only played it once, but so far it's just nice graphics.
3780280	3781280	That's all.
3781280	3782280	Same gameplay.
3782280	3783280	New songs.
3783280	3784280	Same gameplay.
3784280	3790440	Yeah, but I just can't get my mind off of the 800-pound gorilla in the room, which is
3790440	3794480	the DDR tournament that's still lingering right now.
3794480	3795480	I'm sorry.
3795480	3802840	I just hope next year we just fix what we had that went wrong this time.
3802840	3804720	I can't take the DDR talk anymore.
3804720	3805720	I'm sorry.
3805720	3808400	I had to hit the red button to end it.
3808400	3810080	I can't deal with the DDR drama anymore.
3810080	3813480	I'm sorry, guys.
3813480	3818560	If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username OrangeLoungeRadio.
3818560	3819560	Hi.
3819560	3820560	You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
3820560	3821560	Who's this?
3821560	3822560	It's GS68.
3822560	3823560	Hi, GS68.
3823560	3826320	What DDR drama would you like to report on tonight?
3826320	3829000	Actually, not really DDR drama.
3829000	3831600	I just want to say drama in general sucks ass.
3831600	3834960	Yeah, drama in general is kind of crappy.
3834960	3840680	Someone violated the card line thingy today when I was playing Maximum Tune 3.
3840680	3844720	I so was about to hit the hang-up button because I thought you were going to say they violated
3844720	3848920	the card thing on DDR, and I was like, God damn it, I'm cutting off the Skype calls.
3848920	3851640	Okay, but it was Midnight Maximum Tune.
3851640	3852640	I'm okay then.
3852640	3853640	All right, so what happened?
3853640	3862200	Well, I have a card up on the machine to show what was next, and this guy starts to look
3862200	3867040	for coins so he can continue, and then I tell him that my turn is next, and then apparently
3867040	3872520	it's not about the card roll, so I tell him about it, and then he still wants to continue,
3872520	3877160	and then when he finally gets off, he calls me dumb and a faggot, et cetera.
3877160	3884040	So what I did was I started a game and did one of the Metro courses.
3884040	3885040	Can't we all just get along?
3885040	3889840	I mean, seriously, people, you all are fighting each other over, and here's the thing.
3889840	3894200	You're starting fights over Dance Dance Revolution.
3894200	3896180	Can't anyone see the comedy in this?
3896180	3902920	And then now you're calling people a fag because they beat you to playing Midnight Maximum
3902920	3908080	Tune, and this gives you the right to call other people gay?
3908080	3909080	Come on.
3909080	3913040	Because, you know, making it to a machine first is a really different sexuality.
3913040	3920920	I know, his penis must be so large that I'd be like, you know, get it.
3920920	3925000	How would you feel if someone hogged the machine when your turn was next?
3925000	3927360	Anyway, drama sucks.
3927360	3928360	Tell me something.
3928360	3929860	I need to hear a happy story, GS68.
3929860	3930880	Something good happened this week.
3930880	3931880	Didn't it?
3931880	3932880	Anything?
3932880	3933880	Something?
3933880	3937040	Well, seeing as new sites don't cover arcade games, I'll cover the arcade games myself,
3937040	3938920	I finally got to play Initial D4.
3938920	3941480	Oh, I didn't even know Initial D4 came out.
3941480	3942480	How was that?
3942480	3943720	Um, it was alright.
3943720	3947840	I like the drifty physics because it felt more like drift racing.
3947840	3950200	Is that something that's new over Initial D3?
3950200	3956120	Yeah, Initial D3, there was some drifting, but you couldn't see it unless you were in
3956120	3962320	third person view, which was useless because the camera wasn't right on your butt, so it's
3962320	3966000	very hard to control your car.
3966000	3968840	And does it still have all the fabulous Eurobeat in Initial D4?
3968840	3973920	Yeah, but I heard you can't pick your own song, I just randomly choose for you.
3973920	3976880	That's so that the same person doesn't play heartbeat over and over and over again because
3976880	3978880	they don't know how to change the song.
3978880	3985280	Well, not if you're in speed car over and over, like the song was, Speedcar, Speedcar,
3985280	3989800	AEAT6, he's coming.
3989800	3993600	Now suddenly we've turned into a singing karaoke show, no that's alright.
3993600	3995600	This is the Eurobeat hour.
3995600	3999120	Same, this is the strangest Skypline segment ever.
3999120	4004720	Alright, GS60A, any quick last thoughts before we move on?
4004720	4005720	Um, no.
4005720	4008040	Alright, take care GS60A, have a good one.
4008040	4009040	You too.
4009040	4012560	And punch that kid in the face next time they try to call you names.
4012560	4018000	Alright, not that I should be encouraging that, I'm just kidding.
4018000	4020000	You can't win with violence.
4020000	4025480	877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, give us a call, let's talk.
4025480	4027720	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
4027720	4029000	This is Brad from Pod Culture.
4029000	4032400	Hello, Brad from Pod Culture, so good to hear from you, what's on your mind?
4032400	4036560	Well, you said you wanted to hear from somebody who was crazy enough to be in a midnight launch
4036560	4037560	of Halo 3.
4037560	4041160	Oh, and let me guess, it was you, wasn't it?
4041160	4042160	Oh yeah.
4042160	4046440	Alright, so why, why did you have to be there at midnight to be, I mean, you couldn't wait
4046440	4048440	until the next day?
4048440	4050360	It's more of a social thing than anything else.
4050360	4051360	I agree with that.
4051360	4055120	He had to be there because someone cut in front of him, you know, for midnight maximum
4055120	4059640	on Toon 3, and then, you know, the stage was unstable for DDR.
4059640	4064960	Well, when I had pre-ordered my copy at Best Buy, they had said that they were going to
4064960	4067440	be open until midnight.
4067440	4069400	Ours here in Louisville weren't.
4069400	4070400	Louisville?
4070400	4071400	Louisville.
4071400	4072400	Louisville, Kentucky.
4072400	4080240	Sorry, for a second I thought it was Louisville, it looks like Louisville, no, like Louisville.
4080240	4084040	Only city can take a horse race and turn it into a three week party.
4084040	4091320	You know what, my uncle used to live there for a little while, and that's exactly the
4091320	4092920	same way he described it.
4092920	4097240	Well, no, he lived there for a little while with some woman that he was seeing, and then
4097240	4104040	he moved to, right outside Nashville, which is almost as bad.
4104040	4107680	Alright, so you were in the line in Louisville, and
4107680	4110080	Yeah, I actually went to three different lines, actually.
4110080	4112560	Dang, so you had to go all around.
4112560	4120040	Well, the Best Buy wasn't open, so our co-host, Glenn, had his pre-order at a GameStop over
4120040	4122040	in Indiana.
4122040	4125500	So we're, that's about 15, 20 minutes away, so I drove over there to meet him, and they
4125500	4131120	didn't have any more of the collector's edition, so I drove over to meet a friend at another
4131120	4136400	GameStop here in Louisville, they didn't have any, and wound up in line at Circuit City.
4136400	4137400	Wow.
4137400	4142080	Yeah, okay, Circuit City, not a lot of people seem to shop at Circuit City anymore, so that
4142080	4143080	makes sense.
4143080	4145920	There's only like 20 or 30 people in line.
4145920	4149220	I remember when we went out, when the Nintendo Wii went on sale, we went around to all the
4149220	4152440	different lines, which, by the way, yes, there is a difference between the Wii Midnight Launch
4152440	4155800	and this, is that you knew everybody was going to have Halo 3 coming out the ass the next
4155800	4159040	day, but when the Wii came out, you had to be in line at midnight, or you weren't getting
4159040	4160040	the Wii.
4160040	4161040	Big difference.
4161040	4163160	I finally saw a Wii on the shelf the other day.
4163160	4165040	There you go.
4165040	4166040	Big difference.
4166040	4168720	Anyway, yeah, yeah, there was like, what, four people at Circuit City?
4168720	4172660	There was less than 20, 15, 20, 25 people, something like that.
4172660	4174360	But so you got it?
4174360	4179120	Yeah, I got it, and the guy ahead of me spent like 800 bucks.
4179120	4181720	That's right, you sent us a private message earlier, so he went all out.
4181720	4184680	Did he say why he was so crazy for Halo?
4184680	4189080	Well, if he hadn't actually had his girlfriend with him, I would have thought he hadn't moved
4189080	4191800	out of his parents' basement yet.
4191800	4193360	He was pretty geeky.
4193360	4195360	Maybe the girlfriend lives with him in the parents' basement.
4195360	4197000	Well, that could be it, too.
4197000	4202640	Some girlfriends will visit their boyfriends in their parents' basement, sometimes, and
4202640	4206480	then they'll realize that he's kind of, you know, not desirable.
4206480	4207480	But yeah, he...
4207480	4208480	But he loves me.
4208480	4211000	800 bucks for a game, that was crazy.
4211000	4213320	He hits me because he does me.
4213320	4216080	Well, you know, we are in Kentucky here.
4216080	4222440	Hey, hey, I'm not from too much farther away from there, so...
4222440	4225600	So yeah, it was actually a lot of fun hanging around talking to people.
4225600	4230000	Now, you sent me a private message about some of the voice acting in Halo 3 that you discovered
4230000	4231000	during the credits.
4231000	4232000	Yeah.
4232000	4233000	Some pretty popular sci-fi stars.
4233000	4234000	I know you love your sci-fi.
4234000	4236760	Who can we find in Halo 3, in the voice acting?
4236760	4240720	Nathan Fillion, Adam Baldwin, and Alan Tudyk from Firefly.
4240720	4241720	Cool.
4241720	4242720	Ooh, nice!
4242720	4244520	And Katie Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica.
4244520	4246720	She is awesome, and bionic woman now.
4246720	4247720	Yep.
4247720	4251160	Of which I missed on Wednesday, but I have a T-vote, I'm going to watch it a little later.
4251160	4252880	She's freaking nuts on that show.
4252880	4254960	I hear she's the reason to watch that show.
4254960	4255960	Yeah.
4255960	4258600	So I'm definitely going to want to check that out.
4258600	4263320	Good times, but some, maybe not A-list actors, in the sci-fi world, they're definitely on
4263320	4267840	the A-list, but some, you know, some pretty well-known actors there for the Halo 3.
4267840	4271600	Every time I think of dude, I still cry over the end of Firefly.
4271600	4274360	Let's not do spoilers.
4274360	4275680	I'm not saying anything.
4275680	4276680	All right.
4276680	4279280	Oh, come on, the movie's been out two years.
4279280	4280280	All right, that's fine.
4280280	4283320	That was just a sucky way to die, okay?
4283320	4284320	That sucked!
4284320	4285760	I'm a leaf on the wind.
4285760	4288600	No, you're a leaf pinned to a chair.
4288600	4289600	Splat!
4289600	4290600	Ouch.
4290600	4291600	Oh, man.
4291600	4299520	I wanted to hunt Joss down and burn my Joss Whedon is my Master Now shirt.
4299520	4300520	All right, nerds.
4300520	4302800	We've got to wrap up this call and take some more nerdy calls.
4302800	4306760	I'm going to watch The Sarah Jean Adventures, I promise, since the new episodes are out.
4306760	4307760	Excellent show.
4307760	4308760	All right, catch you later, guys.
4308760	4309760	Bye.
4309760	4310760	All right, take care, Brad.
4310760	4311880	Thanks for calling.
4311880	4313000	Ask and ye shall receive.
4313000	4316000	We asked to hear from crazies that were in the Halo 3 line, and we heard from one.
4316000	4317000	That was great.
4317000	4318000	Let's go to the next call.
4318000	4319240	Hello, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
4319240	4320240	Who's this?
4320240	4323520	Sarah Jean Adventures, I promise, since the new episodes are out.
4323520	4324520	Hello?
4324520	4325520	Can you hear us?
4325520	4326520	Yeah, hello?
4326520	4327520	Hi.
4327520	4328520	Hello, who's this?
4328520	4329520	Hey, what's going on?
4329520	4330520	This is GZ.
4330520	4331520	Is this who?
4331520	4332520	GZDR4E.
4332520	4337600	Okay, what's on your mind, buddy?
4337600	4338600	Digital life.
4338600	4342960	Ah, I swear to God, if this is about DDR, we're not continuing this phone call, but
4342960	4343960	what's on your mind?
4343960	4346280	How is digital life?
4346280	4347920	Retro arcade area.
4347920	4350120	Big problem.
4350120	4351720	What big problem in the retro...
4351720	4357440	Apparently, on VIP day on Thursday, they wanted Billy Mitchell to have a photo out with the
4357440	4359320	Donkey Kong machine.
4359320	4361480	I was playing on the machine.
4361480	4364160	They told me to get off the machine.
4364160	4365160	I refused.
4365160	4369680	They threatened to take my VIP pass and kick me off the premises.
4369680	4373520	So I just let them have the machine.
4373520	4375240	Were you going for a high score or something?
4375240	4379520	I mean, were you about ready to be the new King of Kong?
4379520	4383080	Just playing off the machine.
4383080	4384080	What was that?
4384080	4388240	Just playing the machine.
4388240	4391440	So I mean, how does that feel that they had to just kick you off there because somebody
4391440	4394280	more important was in town and needed a photo op?
4394280	4396280	That's kind of got to suck.
4396280	4401160	Yeah, it's all about power there, I guess.
4401160	4405280	You're going to have to actually get the world record on the machine, and then you'll be
4405280	4408640	able to get on any Donkey Kong machine you want in the world.
4408640	4411560	There you have it.
4411560	4415160	So were you so mad that you just kind of left, or did you walk around and check out other
4415160	4416880	stuff that was at Digital Life?
4416880	4421640	No, I just left, I was mad.
4421640	4422640	Wow.
4422640	4423640	All right.
4423640	4430640	Well, I'm sorry to hear that about getting kicked off the machine, but will you try again
4430640	4433680	for Digital Life next year, or you think you're kind of done with it?
4433680	4435880	Yeah, I'll try again next year.
4435880	4436880	All right.
4436880	4440880	Well, just be careful because if there's a movie about asteroids next year, you'll probably
4440880	4445520	want to stay away from the asteroid's machine or the same thing might happen.
4445520	4448520	Anything else you want to share with our listeners?
4448520	4450480	All right, take care.
4450480	4452680	All right, take care.
4452680	4456840	There's connection problems there or something, but thank you for sharing the injustices of
4456840	4460080	Donkey Kong in this world.
4460080	4461080	Sorry to hear it.
4461080	4463280	All right, let's go to the phones and take more calls.
4463280	4465000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4465000	4466000	Who's this?
4466000	4472600	So, I heard that they were holding the bar, and that wasn't cool.
4472600	4473600	Wow.
4473600	4475280	Welcome to DDR Drama Chat.
4475280	4476280	How can we help you?
4476280	4478280	No, this is Bobby.
4478280	4479280	What's going on, guys?
4479280	4480280	Hi, Bobby.
4480280	4481280	How are you?
4481280	4482280	It's good to hear from you.
4482280	4486680	You were asking about people that were in a Halo 3 midnight launch.
4486680	4489720	How did I know you'd call about this?
4489720	4490720	Yeah, what happened?
4490720	4491720	What's your story?
4491720	4496840	Well, actually, the full story I'm not going to go into, but I was actually up in Bellevue,
4496840	4502080	Washington as a guest of Microsoft, so I attended one of the big midnight launches.
4502080	4506320	I was not standing in line for it, but it was a huge party.
4506320	4508160	It was actually fun being there.
4508160	4510200	I had fun, and I wasn't even getting the game.
4510200	4511200	Wow.
4511200	4513160	It was a cheap piece of skinnier in person.
4513160	4515200	Just wanted to throw that out there.
4515200	4516200	Okay.
4516200	4517760	So, what did you guys get to do?
4517760	4521160	Didn't you guys get to go hand out goodies to people in line and stuff?
4521160	4526600	Yeah, I handed out some Halo 3 shirts, and we had some Halo 3 lanyards, and these little
4526600	4529440	five-dollar Burger King credit card things.
4529440	4534040	So, we were giving out, it doesn't get you a happy meal or anything, but it was at least
4534040	4535040	five dollars towards something.
4535040	4540600	We were just giving those out to people in the line for doing stupid stuff or just throwing
4540600	4541600	them out.
4541600	4542600	That sounds like fun.
4542600	4544600	Were there tons of people there?
4544600	4545600	There were probably about four hundred.
4545600	4546600	Wow.
4546600	4548560	Four hundred to five hundred people there, all in line.
4548560	4552000	It stretched all the way down to the Home Depot that was across the parking lot.
4552000	4553000	Dang.
4553000	4554000	And everything.
4554000	4558160	Mountain Dew was giving out the game fuel and all their other stuff, and Balls showed
4558160	4565360	up with this big, huge van, and Bungee showed up in a big charter bus coming straight from
4565360	4569720	their launch party, so they were all boozed up and giving out calendars and swag.
4569720	4570720	Bill Gates showed up.
4570720	4575960	He shook hands with the first fifty people in line right after he rolled out of bed.
4575960	4576960	But it was a big party.
4576960	4582120	I think Warren Moon was there, and everybody was like, we love you in tech mobile.
4582120	4586280	I wish we could have been there to hand out orange soda and cookies in our traditional
4586280	4588640	fashion, but maybe next, maybe for Halo 4.
4588640	4591800	Oh wait, I guess there can't be a Halo 4, can there?
4591800	4592800	Yeah, well.
4592800	4594120	They'll find a way.
4594120	4597040	Now, it's just the end of the story arc.
4597040	4599160	They never said it was the end of Halo.
4599160	4601800	Doesn't the box advertise the end to the Halo chosen?
4601800	4602800	Halo Wars will be there.
4602800	4603800	There'll be more.
4603800	4604800	There'll be more.
4604800	4606240	There'll be another game to get excited about later.
4606240	4607240	There's always something.
4607240	4613480	Now, they did throw out these stress balls that were oranges, and they were actually
4613480	4616400	throwing them at people, like helping people with it.
4616400	4618560	Did you save one for us, Bobby?
4618560	4619560	They didn't help them at me.
4619560	4620560	They were throwing people in line.
4620560	4621560	I'm so sorry.
4621560	4622560	That's alright.
4622560	4628800	We'll just put that on the list of reasons to start a fight with you, that's all.
4628800	4629800	There you go.
4629800	4635800	Yeah, people were walking out of there with big Halo clicks, the big, huge Spartan stuff,
4635800	4640520	because there was the WizKids stuff, and people were walking out of there with hundreds of
4640520	4645600	dollars worth of stuff, and I'm like, you guys realize this is just for a DVD?
4645600	4649600	Did you see people dropping $800, like the guy Brad said he saw that bought the Xbox?
4649600	4650600	Yes.
4650600	4651600	With the game?
4651600	4652600	Oh my gosh.
4652600	4657360	We did see somebody walk out with the big, huge Halo action clicks, figuring it was a
4657360	4663040	$800 and the legendary edition, and then I did see one Xbox 360 sold along with that
4663040	4665680	stuff, so yeah, I can fully believe.
4665680	4669040	Was that people just caught up in the moment, you think, or do you think there's just people
4669040	4672000	that are that hardcore for their Halo?
4672000	4676160	I think it'd be people that are that hardcore, or to buy the 360, it might be somebody who
4676160	4678680	never got a 360 until Halo came out.
4678680	4685440	Yeah, that would make sense, because I got the original Xbox as a Halo one, because I
4685440	4689680	didn't buy it until Halo was out, and it had been out a little while, and they did those
4689680	4695640	special green Xboxes, and I was like, oh, I have to get one of those, so I guess that
4695640	4696640	was me.
4696640	4699800	I didn't wait no midnight line for it either, though.
4699800	4703920	You didn't need to wait in a midnight line, because as I've been telling some people,
4703920	4708160	the Fry's Electronics near me, we walked in yesterday, there are 10 legendary editions
4708160	4709160	sitting on the shelf.
4709160	4715000	Yeah, I went to Fry's too, and they just had tons and tons of Halo 3, and I didn't even
4715000	4716000	get the limited edition.
4716000	4719760	I'm not that into Halo, I just got the regular game.
4719760	4725320	Yeah, they only gave us the regular game, so I don't have any of the cutscene discs
4725320	4727520	or anything else that came with it.
4727520	4733720	Well, Loki had the other one early, because he's sly like that.
4733720	4734720	Good times.
4734720	4737960	Which reminds me, I still need to load the bonus stuff that you have on your one disc,
4737960	4738960	Loki.
4738960	4739960	Don't let me forget.
4739960	4740960	Anyhow.
4740960	4742360	Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners, Bobby?
4742360	4744080	I'm glad to hear you had a good time.
4744080	4745680	Yeah, no, that's it.
4745680	4750560	You just wanted to talk about the Halo 3 launch, but really, that guy, when he touched the
4750560	4755440	bar and we just really all got pissed off at him and stuff, that just...
4755440	4756440	They didn't kick him out.
4756440	4762280	Okay, I had to hang up on Bobby, because I didn't want to hear about DDR drama.
4762280	4763920	And there is no bar raping in Halo.
4763920	4764920	Come on.
4764920	4765920	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4765920	4766920	Who's this?
4766920	4767920	Hey, guys.
4767920	4768920	It's SSJ-100 Matt.
4768920	4771760	Well, hello, SSJ-100 Matt.
4771760	4772760	What's on your mind?
4772760	4777080	I'm exhausted from a digital life.
4777080	4778760	Dare I ask about...
4778760	4779760	I don't know.
4779760	4781320	There's no drama on this call.
4781320	4782320	Even though I judged...
4782320	4783320	Praise you.
4783320	4785320	You're a great man.
4785320	4786900	Even though what?
4786900	4792360	Even though I was helping the judge on the elephant in the room.
4792360	4798740	Okay, well, tell us about digital life, like what else you saw there and some of the other
4798740	4799740	stuff.
4799740	4803160	What else there was in digital life besides DDR?
4803160	4806520	For the most part, well, this is my first time going.
4806520	4811840	From what I understand, it was a lot smaller than last year, but gaming-wise, I had a really
4811840	4815080	good time.
4815080	4821800	They premiered a lot of games that haven't been out yet, mostly PC stuff.
4821800	4830200	I got to play World in Conflict, I should say, which I thought was pretty good.
4830200	4837840	I wanted to try to get on Hellgate London, but the line was too long for that.
4837840	4843480	And the biggest surprise, I would say, and Loki's going to hate me for this, was The
4843480	4845560	Eye of Judgment.
4845560	4846560	Really?
4846560	4847960	Another positive...
4847960	4849640	Is this a positive review of The Eye of Judgment?
4849640	4850640	You thought it was cool?
4850640	4851640	Yes.
4851640	4857720	Yeah, I don't have a PS3 yet, but I would seriously consider it.
4857720	4861140	This is not the first person that's called in to say The Eye of Judgment is better than
4861140	4862140	you think.
4862140	4865480	Actually, I was hearing some good reviews from the GameCrazy managers when they got
4865480	4866600	back from conference.
4866600	4867880	What the crap is going on?
4867880	4871480	That you don't have to photocopy or buy any booster packs or anything.
4871480	4873700	It comes with all of the cards available for the game.
4873700	4878200	But Jamie, seriously, you did see the same thing we saw at E3 last year, right?
4878200	4879200	With The Eye of Judgment?
4879200	4880200	I didn't go to The Eye of Judgment.
4880200	4884280	It doesn't come with all of the cards, because that's why they sell booster packs in assorted
4884280	4885280	decks.
4885280	4888800	No, that's what they were saying at the GameCrazy managers conference that's coming with them
4888800	4889800	all intact.
4889800	4892040	I bet you it's not.
4892040	4893040	That's from the vendor.
4893040	4894040	I'm misinformed.
4894040	4895040	That's from the vendor.
4895040	4896040	Wait, hold on.
4896040	4897040	Let's go back to the hall.
4897040	4898040	What caller?
4898040	4902040	From what I understand, from what I was told, actually Wizards of the Coast is handling
4902040	4904040	the game packs, I believe.
4904040	4908320	Well, I actually should, because they were the ones hosting the event.
4908320	4915960	But anyways, they're going to be giving out 150 cards when you buy the game, at least
4915960	4916960	that's what they say.
4916960	4917960	Well, maybe that was what it was.
4917960	4921120	Yeah, because they figured out, probably, that everyone's going to pirate them anyways,
4921120	4922120	so.
4922120	4923120	All right.
4923120	4927400	Well, actually, you know, I'm going to be sending you guys a couple gifts, and one of
4927400	4930560	the gifts is actually a couple cards from the game.
4930560	4932680	So you guys will get this checked.
4932680	4933680	Awesome.
4933680	4936160	I'm actually thinking about getting the game, honestly.
4936160	4939600	Go right ahead, it's not going to sell a million units.
4939600	4940760	I'm just not going to happen.
4940760	4943800	I think this turnaround is hilarious, in my own mind.
4943800	4948600	Well, just from what I was hearing from the feedback from the manager's conference, I
4948600	4951200	was like, well, I'll give it a try.
4951200	4952200	So maybe.
4952200	4953200	All right.
4953200	4963560	What else in digital life would you think was cool?
4963560	4966960	They touched on it before, but I really like Guitar Hero 3.
4966960	4968760	Okay.
4968760	4972840	It was kind of hard to hear any of the songs, because, you know, the whole convention itself
4972840	4982360	was loud as hell, but it just reminded me, it just seemed like a better version of one
4982360	4985360	and two.
4985360	4989480	Someone said it seems like modifiers, but there are involved, but I don't know how true
4989480	4992320	that is.
4992320	4995160	So it didn't just feel like Guitar Hero 2 with new songs?
4995160	5003200	No, it didn't seem like a copy and paste, like 80s style, or whatever, 80s mix.
5003200	5006840	Which basically was a copy and paste job, but that's a whole other story.
5006840	5007840	Yeah.
5007840	5008840	All right.
5008840	5012640	So if you had to judge digital life on a scale of one to ten, what would you give it?
5012640	5018920	Well, considering this was my first one, I'd have to give it like seven out of ten.
5018920	5019920	All right.
5019920	5020920	It's not bad.
5020920	5028240	Yeah, I'll be sending you guys out a couple of stuff, including some VROs I got from the
5028240	5031240	Elephant in the Closet.
5031240	5034200	The game we can't speak of tonight.
5034200	5038040	We're going to give it the JT treatment, I guess.
5038040	5039040	That's all right.
5039040	5042960	No, we do love DDR, which is why it pains us so much to hear about all this drama.
5042960	5043960	Can't we all just get along?
5043960	5045240	You people are playing a dancing game.
5045240	5046240	Don't take it that seriously.
5046240	5047240	All right.
5047240	5051720	Well, SJ100, Matt, we've got to let you go, but thank you so much for calling in and giving
5051720	5055520	us a drama-free report from Digital Life.
5055520	5056520	We appreciate it.
5056520	5057520	Don't mention it.
5057520	5058520	All right.
5058520	5059520	Take care, buddy.
5059520	5060520	Yep.
5060520	5061520	Take care.
5061520	5062520	I love this.
5062520	5063520	Mr. Gohan in chat sums this up perfectly.
5063520	5065320	After this, who knows?
5065320	5068740	Africa could be Loki's favorite game ever.
5068740	5070440	Only if I get to run over the animals.
5070440	5072080	All right, guys.
5072080	5073720	That's going to do it for the Sky Flying tonight.
5073720	5076760	Sorry to those folks that didn't get through, but thank you guys very much.
5076760	5078720	We've been going a long time on this segment.
5078720	5082200	It's about time to go around and wrap things up, but first, we've got to ask if there's
5082200	5084200	any last-minute stories.
5084200	5085200	No.
5085200	5086200	No.
5086200	5087200	Wow.
5087200	5089200	No last-minute stories.
5089200	5090200	That might be a first.
5090200	5091600	In other news, I like beer.
5091600	5092600	All right.
5092600	5093600	Me too.
5093600	5095440	Well, then let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
5095440	5097000	Dark Sakura, we'll start with you.
5097000	5098000	What's your final thought?
5098000	5100360	In other words, I like beer.
5100360	5106720	My final thought is I need another air conditioning event in here because it's getting too hot.
5106720	5107720	Too hot.
5107720	5108720	Loki.
5108720	5112640	My final thought is asshole Mario is hilarious.
5112640	5113640	Hilarious.
5113640	5116040	It's like you can't stop watching it.
5116040	5117040	I can't.
5117040	5120800	We'll see you back here next week, boys and girls, for Orange Launch Radio episode number
5120800	5123200	250, if you can believe it.
5123200	5129520	I'm telling you, I know how G4 is desperate for television to play all these back-to-back.
5129520	5130520	There you go.
5130520	5131520	There's a good hour block.
5131520	5132520	Isn't it a three-day weekend?
5132520	5133520	What?
5133520	5134520	Next weekend.
5134520	5135520	Is next weekend a three-day weekend?
5135520	5136520	I don't think so.
5136520	5137520	I don't know.
5137520	5138520	Unless you get Columbus Day off.
5138520	5139520	I get Columbus Day.
5139520	5140520	That's why.
5140520	5141520	Because I work for...
5141520	5142520	I think it's Columbus Day.
5142520	5143520	Because I get banking holidays.
5143520	5144520	Well, lucky you.
5144520	5145520	Not me.
5145520	5146520	I'm going to get...
5146520	5150120	I'm going to bring some Metoxa and drink it on the show.
5150120	5151120	All right.
5151120	5152440	Stay tuned and see how that goes.
5152440	5155520	We'll be back next week with more of Orange Launch Radio.
5155520	5156520	See you guys then.
