20892	21872	Orange Lounge Radio
48011	50132	Be good or Santa's not going to bring you the games you want.
50652	53933	But we will keep bringing you the gaming news you want, whether you've been good or bad.
54593	56654	So we're going to get right back into some gaming news, aren't we, Loki?
56834	60635	Yes, and this game's kind of interesting.
60875	66677	I don't know how popular it's going to be because you've got kind of conflicting elements to it.
66777	71078	For example, Mario and Sonic at the Olympics.
71858	74359	Now, Mario and Sonic games, those are good.
75072	77313	Olympic Games, those are usually bad.
77573	80355	So it's kind of... I don't know.
80375	81856	I don't know if it's going to be good or not.
82116	82456	Either way.
82536	83796	This could go either way.
84557	84897	Either way.
85257	92921	There will be 16 characters, including your favorites from both the Sonic and Mario and, I guess, Nintendo universes.
93421	103446	Although, what's weird, though, is I do see the villain from one of the alligators from the Donkey Kong Country franchises, yet no Donkey Kong.
104607	104727	Odd.
105347	106368	Fencing, Archery,
123556	142640	Shooting, Skeet, Gymnastics, including Trampoline and Vault, High Jump, Pull Vault, Long Jump, Triple Jump, Javelin Throw, Hammer Throw, Single Skulls for rowing, of course, Table Tennis, Aquatics, both the 100 meter and, of course, the 4-lap 100 meter.
143540	146440	And let's see here, Tracks, of course, 110 meter, 400 meter, Hurdles, Freestyle,
150015	154659	100m Relay, and the just normal 100m and 400m.
156220	157721	So lots of running and stuff.
157841	161984	I still don't understand how Mario is ever going to beat Sonic in running.
162044	164026	Nobody's been able to explain this logic to me.
164246	167328	Did they give Sonic some drugs to slow him down?
167728	169330	Or Mario some steroids?
169990	171611	How is that ever going to be an even match?
171811	179277	The characters in the game, they've kind of broken them up like they did with Mario Kart, where you've got the power types, the ones that
179850	186532	are more of the robust characters, like Bowser and Wario, stuff like that.
186812	189613	And Knuckles is in there too, so apparently Knuckles is a fat ass.
190353	191053	He's a fatty.
192233	194034	Well, he does have a little bit of a gut.
194294	199075	What they're saying, Dark Knight says in our chat room at chat.orangelongery.com, they balance the characters.
199195	206717	I understand they balance the characters, but that still doesn't make sense in the regards of that Sonic runs very fast and Mario runs quickly.
207157	211601	They also have all-around characters, which Mario falls under, as well as Luigi.
212562	216105	And apparently also the two chicks from the Sonic universe.
216185	219167	So Mario and Luigi, you're as powerful as chicks.
219688	221029	Way to go, pansies.
221529	224792	Whoa, I think there might be some women a little angry at that comment.
225532	230597	Well, I mean, honestly.
230677	233999	Mr. DeBucket in chat says they wouldn't let Bowser into the Chinese Olympics.
234700	234900	Yeah.
235661	235741	Uh...
236280	239101	And then, of course, for the speed types, you have Sonic.
239681	241861	You actually have... What's his name?
242041	245062	Oh, the crappy game.
245102	246102	What was the crappy game?
248042	248503	Driver.
248803	250223	No, Sonic game.
250283	251123	Crappy Sonic game.
251443	252303	Sonic the Hedgehog.
252563	256344	No, the last one that came out before Sonic... I don't know.
256384	257444	The guy with the gun.
258285	258565	I don't know.
258825	259765	Oh, Shadow the Hedgehog?
259785	260745	Shadow, yes.
260845	261425	Thank you.
261805	264666	Sorry, they all look alike, and those games kind of blend together, so...
265302	267163	Part of me for forgetting that crappy game.
267723	275766	And then, of course, the skill types where you have Princess Peach, Tails, Waluigi, and Dr. Eggman.
276906	281848	I hope Princess Peach will be able to use her emotional power in the Olympic Games somehow.
282068	283448	Well, that would be a skill, I guess.
283608	284068	That's right.
284368	285069	Some type of skill.
285469	285789	I don't know.
285909	287249	So it's going to be all split up.
290230	290671	Who knows?
291071	291431	I don't know.
291731	294712	To be honest, I don't think I'm going to buy this game.
296779	297500	Maybe I'd rent it.
297720	306086	All it seems to me is it's like, hey, we put out another crappy Olympics game, but we have Sonic and Mario this time, so you're going to buy it, right?
306247	306487	Huh?
306587	306807	Huh?
306907	307227	Yeah?
308989	315314	And maybe we'll have advertising for these games during the Olympics and that kind of crap, so cross-promotion stuff.
316695	324061	Be honest, though, I think you guys are going to get suckered into buying another crappy Olympics game because it has characters that you like, so have at it.
324577	326839	I'll be busy playing Super Mario Galaxy instead.
327559	330001	Well, I will be busy playing Super Smash Bros.
330081	331342	Brawl when that comes out.
331642	333284	Well, yeah.
333484	334445	Upon its release, yes.
335185	343912	And one thing that has lots of fanboys and girls very excited, especially if you're a David Hader fanboy or fangirl, which I believe DarkSakura is a David Hader fangirl.
344072	346033	Because he could just talk to me all day and I'll be happy.
346153	347214	Do you watch his YouTube?
347254	351838	Apparently he has a YouTube site where he does all these little Q&A things and does stuff on there.
352198	352758	I didn't know that.
352778	353379	I'll have to check.
353539	354520	You definitely should check that out.
355020	359702	This guy named Archduke Chocula was checking it out and sent David Hayter a question.
359762	361163	It said, Hello, David Hayter.
361203	363344	I have to say you are one of the greatest voice actors ever.
364324	365565	And you do a great job as Snake.
365925	368747	I was wondering, are you going to voice Snake in the Super Smash Bros.
368827	369267	Brawl?
369647	374309	To which David Hayter responded, I am indeed voicing Snake in Smash Bros.
374429	378791	I recorded it already, and I believe that fans of both games are going to be extremely happy.
378831	379612	It's very cool.
379952	380833	That's all I can say.
381213	385336	So this is authentic Snake now because it's the same voice actor and everything.
385757	393743	So that's just one more cool thing that you can put on the ever-growing list of cool things in Smash Bros.
393783	394044	Brawl.
394064	394664	I mean, seriously.
394844	395745	I love David Hader.
395785	396806	Got Resetti in there.
397106	400808	Dude, they put fucking Resetti in Smash Bros.
400828	400928	Brawl.
400948	402948	What is he going to do, bitch at you until you die?
403209	406330	He comes out and lectures you on the mechanics of how to play the game, I think.
406450	407730	Was that the impression I got?
407990	409251	I don't think he's like an item or anything.
409291	411312	I think he lectures you on how to play the game.
411352	414673	I want Mr. Saturn still in the game as an item because I love Mr. Saturn.
415193	416374	I just want Ness.
416694	417574	Is that too much to ask?
417614	418255	PK Fire?
418815	421196	Or how about, like, was it Howard and Nestor?
422690	425032	Dark Knight says, I would love to have a Smash Bros.
425112	425773	on the DS.
425893	427254	Dude, I bet that'll be the next one.
428115	429076	I bet that'll be the next one.
429236	429477	Yeah.
429677	429897	Anyway.
430718	441429	Well, speaking of things Nintendo, for Virtual Console coming out in the UK, Sin and Punishment is the recent edition, which is a Nintendo 64 game.
442069	443531	Pretty cool game, and...
444554	445815	The Legend of Hirotanma
471563	476785	Anticipation Anticipation Anticipation Anticipation Anticipation Anticipation Anticipation Anticipation
498952	499953	Yeah, check out this game.
499973	501474	You get to go save a princess and do shit.
501514	503375	I'm saving the best for last.
503655	504536	So it's Mario?
504736	504976	No.
505196	505697	Zelda?
506057	506337	No.
506838	508278	Just, you know, some princess.
508319	509219	Wonder Boy!
510840	512601	Wonder Boy and Monsterland did come out, didn't it?
513542	513942	I think so.
514022	515323	I love Wonder Boy and Monsterland.
515423	520527	But anyway, Gradius 3, which was a SNES game.
520547	521748	900 Wii points.
522508	524990	And dude, it's fucking Gradius, so you won it right now.
526121	533326	I think that's also part of that Japanese gamey thing that, you know, the releasing games in the UK that we don't have over here.
533546	534366	Gradius 3.
535207	535527	Sad.
536467	538048	I actually have Gradius 3, though.
538889	540790	It's in the Gradius collection on PSP.
541130	543332	Well, but I actually have the cart.
544012	545253	Well, can I touch you?
545313	546193	You're just so cool.
546233	546874	I have Gradius 2.
547014	549015	I just want a little piece of your coolness.
549135	553458	I have Gradius 2 on Turbo Duo, which is the best version of that game ever.
554295	554875	GATE OF THUNDER
577217	582662	and I'll be coming out for 800 Wii Points as well as Super Air Zonk will be coming out as well.
582842	584643	Air Zonk was such a bizarre little game.
586465	590749	The TurboGrafx-16 was a bizarre little console, so it makes perfect sense.
590789	591809	But it had some great stuff on it.
592710	596273	Like, I pressed the bathroom door to get a copy of Pac-Land.
596794	597614	Remember the button?
597634	600777	Oh my god, that was so long ago.
600937	602098	I know, that was great.
602378	604180	Well, we were at Classic Gaming Expo, right?
604200	604280	Yeah.
605307	607808	And they were selling Pac-Land on the TurboGrafx-16.
607988	609409	I was with $5 short.
609609	610910	And Jamie was like, I want that.
611010	612671	I just need $5 to get it.
613371	617434	And so there was this little... God, this is so stupid.
617454	617854	It was the bathroom.
617874	618734	I can't believe we're telling this story.
618754	620395	There were three doors that had the automatic button.
620415	622716	But seriously, Jamie, this was like you had to be there thing.
622756	624757	The listeners are going to be like, this story isn't funny at all.
624818	628259	But I will do stuff for TurboGrafx games.
628860	634843	This little girl we saw, she ran up and pressed the button to open the handicap restroom and then ran away.
635936	638778	And for some reason, this is the most hilarious thing in the world to us.
638798	640679	Like, we were laughing and laughing at this little girl.
640719	641540	We were that bored.
641580	642441	Yeah, I guess so.
643121	647964	So I said to Jamie, I said, Jamie, if you mimic what that little girl just did, I'll give you five dollars.
648365	648965	And she did it.
649065	649766	We took pictures.
649826	650406	They're somewhere.
651027	652327	Because, I don't know.
653148	655049	Do you know how many times I've played that copy of Pac-Land?
655770	655930	Once.
656490	656751	Really?
657651	659112	Not even on the actual duo.
659152	660453	I played it on a Turbo Express.
660533	661454	Oh, my five bucks back.
662134	662354	No.
662695	663695	You can come play my game, though.
664076	664536	I don't want to.
664870	669651	Other game, well another TurboGrafx game announced as well, Samurai Ghost.
670711	673692	But of course that's not a TurboCD title.
674632	676092	Wow, more people just entered the studio.
677433	679413	Keep going with the story, ignore them for a minute.
680033	682994	So that's it, all your TurboCD games.
684994	685374	Was that it?
685434	687235	No more news on TurboGrafx CD games?
687455	688875	Nope, that was it.
690799	696622	Going back to Nintendo Wii, Fatal Frame is being developed for the Nintendo Wii.
698062	701344	It's being developed by Grasshopper and it's being published by Tecmo.
702565	706206	And it's being worked on very soon, I guess, right now.
706246	708507	And it's kind of cool because Fatal Frame is very popular.
708587	714190	Well, it's no Silent Hill or Resident Evil, but it's probably on that secondary tier of scary video games.
714290	717512	And so we're always curious to see how games translate over to the Wii.
717792	720093	But you can bet there'll probably be something to do with photography.
720905	722386	and the Wiimote and all that stuff.
723947	726469	All that stuff is very specific, Rob.
727850	728310	Absolutely.
729291	732032	Well, this makes me a happy, happy, happy bunny.
733313	738397	One of my favorite games ever... They're distracting me, Rob!
738697	739998	Ignore them and read the story.
740418	744161	One of my favorite ever games is Samba de Amigo and there is...
746252	749033	A statement that it is going to be on the Wii.
749253	762417	It's supposedly this cover scan from Nintendo Power that's floating around ye old interwebs showing a Samba de Amigo for the Wii.
764338	767699	Samba de Amigo on the Wii is going to be awesome.
767719	770159	There's nothing, though, in the issue regarding gameplay.
771780	772020	All right.
772200	772440	So, yeah.
773755	779657	Anyway, let's introduce, you know, Extifer and Rice Princess barged in here, so I thought I'd let them say hello.
781037	782017	Well, hello there.
782597	783478	I'm British now.
784718	785878	What are you kids up to this evening?
787079	789179	We basically came here to say hi.
789559	791080	I haven't been on Orange Lingerie in a while.
791460	792640	Well, I mean, since I called in.
792660	794741	I like it that way.
794761	794821	Aww.
794841	796081	Were you here last week?
796421	798122	Well, no, I called in last week.
798262	798742	Oh, that's right.
799578	815747	um but i i decided to it's me and rice princess say hi say hi rice princess hi rice princess okay and um we just want to say hi and oh yeah we want you to do a song that we want on the cage match
817006	817786	The Game of Life Rice Princess
847250	848550	That is what you said last week.
849731	850131	I'm just kidding.
851512	862776	I've been playing WoW and I played Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo last night at a certain party that was thrown that I attended and it was fun.
864216	870218	Now, I have a question about Puzzle Fighter 2 because you loved the one that was on Sony PlayStation and the old school one.
870258	872039	How does the Xbox 360 one compare?
873598	876899	The game itself isn't bad, but the controller is god-awful.
877199	880679	Like, when I wanted to press down, it would go, like, to the left or to the right.
881079	881639	It made me mad.
882019	882880	Am I being too quiet?
883700	884740	I'm sorry about that.
885240	886200	I will raise my voice.
887740	892841	Yeah, the game itself isn't bad, but the controller is, like, a nightmare to use to play that game.
893361	895442	But, yeah, I enjoyed it thoroughly.
896762	897122	Yep.
898282	900643	Did you try the remix mode with the different drop patterns and stuff?
901843	902183	No.
902403	902743	What?
902763	902843	What?
903604	905165	I only went into one mode.
905185	907406	I just kept pressing A until the game started.
908306	909686	There's like way more to the game.
909706	912708	There's like all these different, like you can play modes where you don't even just make bricks.
912748	917730	You make like different things and you need to check out the game a little more thoroughly.
918030	919771	That was a very bad review job you did.
919871	920231	Fired!
921731	922992	Well, listen, son of a bitch.
923012	923772	You should have told me.
923792	925873	I would have done that.
925933	928754	I just kept pressing A because I really wanted to play the game.
928974	930435	Like, because I, you know what?
930635	933276	I'm like the best at the game out of all of you, so...
934192	937733	That's why you're making fun of me, because you're jealous of my skills.
939374	940655	All right, no more derailing the show.
940795	941935	We've got to get back to gaming news.
942175	943796	So you can stay if you want to contribute to news.
943836	944476	Otherwise, get out.
945737	948218	Well, we actually are going to go.
950198	951159	I guess.
951199	952559	Way to put me on the spot.
952839	954720	Okay, well, we can stay and listen.
955380	955740	All right.
956201	956641	You do that.
956681	958322	Let's get back to some gaming news.
958542	959442	All the listeners are like,
960185	961066	Back to gaming news?
961246	963768	Yeah, now Irene's like, I gotta go look at Puzzle Fighter.
964069	970074	Anyways, so apparently the BAFTA nominees are coming around.
970875	975319	For those not in the know, that's the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.
976140	982306	They've announced their nominees for the 2007 Video Game Awards, and topping the list is Wii Sports.
982915	987898	with seven nominations, including Innovation and Best Game categories.
988658	999243	And, of course, there's also a four-way tie for the second-most nominations with Crackdown, awesome game, Gears of War, also awesome game, Akami, and God of War II, all awesome games.
1001485	1002905	I don't know if it should be Game of the Year, though.
1003225	1006327	That's pretty rad, though, that they give it such good recognition, though, over there.
1006767	1009249	Other nominees, of course, Bioshock, Crysis.
1010069	1011250	How could Crysis be nominated?
1011270	1012010	It's not even out yet.
1013232	1017255	Gears Award, Guitar Hero 2, and Kanan Lynch.
1018195	1019716	Also, Kanan Lynch is not out yet.
1021978	1023679	They need a Gaming Oscars.
1023799	1029102	And I'm not talking about the Spike TV Awards or whatever that crap is.
1029142	1031603	Does that even exist anymore?
1032024	1033905	I think it's now like a segment on X-Play.
1033925	1035766	It doesn't even matter.
1036586	1037787	None of that stuff counts.
1037827	1038928	I want a Gaming Oscars.
1038988	1040028	Something that's not a joke.
1040849	1041089	Oh well.
1042079	1042439	Forget it.
1043861	1045363	The Howard and Nestor Awards.
1046824	1046964	No.
1048226	1049347	The Howard and Nestor Awards.
1049367	1050508	That would actually be pretty awesome.
1050808	1052310	Winners will be announced of course on October 23rd.
1054560	1058501	Well, Xbox 360 games seem to be moving over to the Nintendo DS.
1058601	1062982	Heck, Viva Pinata, as you know, was announced to have an incarnation coming out on the Nintendo DS.
1063322	1063782	Guess what?
1063902	1067342	Blue Dragon is also on its way to the Nintendo DS.
1067702	1070563	Now, normally you'd kind of go, well, that doesn't seem like too big a surprise.
1070603	1072763	I mean, it kind of seems like the kind of game that could have been on the DS.
1073063	1081785	But when you consider that, you know, Mistwalker made it for Microsoft, it is kind of interesting that the game is going to have an incarnation on the DS.
1082145	1085806	This was coming from a recent issue of the manga Shonen Jump.
1086046	1086726	You know, it's funny.
1086806	1092728	When I asked my Microsoft rep about Viva Pinata and who was publishing it, he got on a plane and left.
1094448	1094948	Interesting.
1095109	1096029	He didn't have the answer for me.
1096649	1096869	Huh.
1097149	1098269	And then he got on a plane and left.
1100030	1100670	That was your answer.
1101070	1101610	I guess so.
1101790	1103851	The answer was... He's like, uh, look over there.
1104051	1105311	The answer was, what's that?
1105511	1106752	The answer was, um... Run away!
1106772	1107772	Okay, thanks, bye.
1108492	1108932	For real.
1109452	1110213	I know, really.
1110913	1111393	Well, um...
1112927	1132079	There is a little speculation regarding Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass, and it was confirmed that the producer, Eiji Aonuma, basically did agree that the game was a remake of the very first Zelda game.
1133979	1138801	or it must have started off that way, but it certainly hopefully hasn't ended up that way because I don't want to pony up that kind of money.
1138821	1145224	Well, the game's already out, and I know people who play it who didn't say that it was just like it, but it was supposed to be... What the crap?
1145264	1146325	Phantom Hourglass came out?
1146785	1147185	In Japan.
1147606	1148986	Oh, okay.
1149487	1153088	Remember, my friends have a Ninja Pass.
1153308	1155389	Sorry, I was like, wait, wait, it came out over here?
1155409	1156490	I missed that.
1157094	1164200	But at any rate, it's saying that in his attempt to return to the root series, he unintentionally remade the game.
1165901	1170966	So it's not really a complete remake, it's more like a... An homage.
1172227	1173588	A spiritual remake, I guess.
1173608	1176590	When I hear that though, I go, well if it's an original, I don't know if I want it.
1176990	1177891	Well, I'm gonna get it.
1178332	1179472	No, I know, I'm gonna get it too.
1180093	1184036	Heck, even if it was a remake of the first game, I'd probably get it, because I'm a consumer whore.
1184296	1184737	And how.
1186508	1187128	Exactly.
1187908	1197831	Anyways, so funny that you mentioned remakes because the Sex Pistols are actually coming together to re-record Anarchy in the UK.
1198591	1200411	And of course this is going to be for Guitar Hero 3.
1201472	1202572	Why should you care?
1202592	1205413	Because it's a pretty cool song.
1206433	1207993	But yeah, they've come back together.
1208273	1209914	And it's the Sex Pistols getting back together.
1209934	1210374	That's kind of cool.
1210394	1210634	Exactly.
1210674	1211154	Exactly.
1211730	1239533	and so apparently they're going to be reissuing Anarchy in the UK as well as part of the celebration they're going to be our Guitar Hero 3 is going to be sponsoring the band's performance at the London Brixton Academy on November 8th all in thanks to a video game well they're re-releasing it's kind of co-advertising here it's basically they're re-releasing their album Nevermind the Bollocks here's the Sex Pistols
1240323	1246305	And that's coming out on the 29th, which is actually the day after Guitar Hero comes out over here.
1248346	1248686	I don't know.
1248886	1250887	I don't know why they decided to re-record it.
1251307	1255028	Probably because it's good press.
1255388	1259950	Going to our chatroom, chat.orangehoundsradio.com, DarkTetsuya asks, wasn't that in Guitar Freaks at one point?
1259990	1263151	Yes, it was, but it was a shitty cover of it was in the game.
1263646	1267027	DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with tonight's FUs of the week?
1267107	1268087	Um... My FU of the week goes towards, um...
1294281	1295561	Yeah, it's actually going to go to work.
1296882	1297642	Just in general.
1299842	1306324	I actually went and got my business license on Wednesday so that I can hopefully quit my job and get to working at a spa.
1306644	1307364	That'd be so nice.
1308264	1314726	And so, it really, really just sort of made me realize how much more futile what I do is.
1315046	1316686	So, F you to work.
1318647	1318967	Loki.
1320307	1322968	After the bad drivers, I was commuting back from
1323723	1330605	Oakland Today, and there are just some people out there that don't really follow any of the laws of the road.
1330665	1332346	In fact, just weave in and out.
1332386	1339008	I watched a truck almost flip itself because it turned so tight, you know, trying to go between cars and stuff like that.
1339148	1350812	So, you know, there's just some people, and there's a guy with some riced up car or something that just decided, oh, I'm going to just cut through cars and stuff, no signal, no nothing, just
1352503	1353585	Try and kill people.
1353605	1354968	So, fuck them.
1356531	1357452	Um, I'm gonna give an F you.
1357533	1358575	Oh, sorry.
1358635	1359035	One more thing.
1359536	1365067	F you to the California Highway Patrol for stopping the freeway, you morons.
1365732	1369375	So, you know, they do all these things to stop people from speeding.
1369475	1373858	So one of those things apparently is to stop traffic on the freeway completely.
1374318	1375800	All lanes at one time.
1375960	1377761	Because that solves the problem.
1378261	1378682	No, it doesn't.
1378702	1379883	That causes more traffic.
1379923	1383525	People become late and they speed more, you stupid dumb fucks.
1384986	1385307	That's it.
1386087	1387368	That does seem like a little silly idea.
1387388	1388549	Unless there's an axe in the head.
1388609	1390751	No, they just... For no reason?
1391091	1391912	No reason.
1392272	1393092	We're bored today.
1393112	1393853	Let's screw with traffic.
1396771	1398813	My FU of the week goes to my ass.
1400034	1411664	Hear me out here for a minute, because I was a little bit intoxicated, and I slipped and I fell on this chest that's in my room, this little green, not a treasure chest, but a chest for clothes and stuff.
1411984	1418409	I slipped and I fell right on the corner of that, so my butt hit that corner, and now it's red and practically bruised.
1418689	1419630	I saw Rob's butt.
1419810	1424214	Yeah, I showed it to Jamie earlier, but only because I'm gay and she's a married woman, so it's okay.
1424674	1425395	I gave Rob drugs.
1425717	1430918	Yeah, and she evaluated it and gave me some ibuprofen that was very strong.
1430938	1431438	Do you feel better?
1431838	1432338	I do, actually.
1432358	1433118	I don't feel it at all.
1433138	1434219	It's nice.
1436359	1437519	That's it for the FUs of the Week.
1438679	1438999	Hooray.
1440820	1442280	Let's go back to some gaming news.
1442580	1445240	And, you know, this is almost FU of the Week worthy.
1445661	1447341	Did you know, I found this on Dig.
1447401	1453762	There's this site, eBizMBA, that tracks the top 25 gaming sites on the Internet.
1454790	1456092	Orange Lounge Radio is nowhere to be found
1467906	1472048	DMN did the interview with a gal from Nintendo who got fired over her blog.
1472288	1476270	DMN actually interviewed her for their own show, STFU, which is on Thursdays on the station.
1476310	1480952	We were going to rebroadcast it because it's kind of an in-the-news current thing that we thought you guys would be interested in.
1481232	1488455	Apparently, their connection sucked and the audio quality wasn't worth it to try and bring it to you guys.
1488595	1490336	We made an editorial decision to cut it out.
1490456	1494278	What about the guy that proposed over... I didn't hear back from him on MySpace.
1494358	1494618	I don't know.
1494638	1495298	Maybe he's listening.
1495678	1496619	We'll still have him on the show.
1496659	1496979	Call in.
1497628	1498348	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1520333	1522214	The Quantcast monthly visitors.
1522234	1522934	I don't even know what that is.
1523234	1525795	And the Alexa ranking, which, by the way, I think is bullshit.
1525855	1529097	I think you should not use... Oh, God, I fucking hate Alexa.
1529417	1531538	It's like one of the biggest plagues on the internet.
1532098	1532618	Who owns it?
1532658	1533819	Like Amazon or some shit?
1534259	1539701	All it is is a spyware bar that you basically have to install on your computer and it tracks what websites you visit.
1540001	1547225	And they have the balls to release this ranking of the top sites based on who has this Alexa toolbar installed.
1547765	1548045	I mean...
1548891	1559134	That's not... I mean, like, because if you are anti-spyware, anti-toolbar, all this stuff, you probably visit different sites than people who get suckered to putting this stuff on their computer.
1559154	1560815	Anyway, I could just go off all day.
1560835	1568918	Because I... One of the things I hate about Wikipedia is that they use the Alexa ranking as some of their, like, is a site worthy to be on our page.
1569398	1574480	Which, how we've managed to keep our article up on Wikipedia for so long, I'll never be able to figure that out.
1576140	1578001	But thank you all to the listeners who made that.
1578141	1578381	Anyway...
1579685	1581046	Sorry, I have my soapbox there.
1581146	1581846	Top 25 sites.
1581906	1583887	Number one video game site, IGN.com.
1584487	1592051	Followed by GameSpot.com at number two, GameFacts.com at number three, GamesRadar.com at number four, which kind of surprised me.
1592371	1594072	I'd never really heard of it until a few months ago.
1594812	1604177	UGO.com at number five, GameSpy, CheatCC, Kotaku, Yahoo Video Games, and GameTap rounding out the top ten.
1604804	1606604	Filefront is a gaming site.
1606905	1609165	Apparently Filefront is a gaming site, number 11.
1609225	1610065	Fileplanet.
1612606	1617687	Some other big blogs, 1UP, who does a bunch of podcasts, they're number 13 on the list.
1618807	1620168	Destructoid is number 20.
1620228	1621888	Joystick is number 19.
1623429	1624569	And that's all I care to mention.
1624669	1626849	We're getting beat out by Strategy Informer.
1627350	1629610	Well, you know, life sucks sometimes.
1629990	1631291	Yeah, we don't have the budget.
1631711	1632991	I bet you all these people...
1633462	1635343	None of these are, of course, independent sites.
1635783	1637124	Well, maybe Kotaku, I guess.
1637364	1637944	And Joystick.
1638824	1639505	And Destructoid.
1640405	1643146	I don't want to get into the politics of it all.
1643306	1647388	Anywho.
1647408	1649209	Some of the chat is asking, where's All Games?
1649869	1651890	Nope, All Games didn't make the top 25 either.
1652250	1653731	But All Games doesn't really do news.
1654111	1655232	All Games is only shows.
1655252	1658073	I think if there were more to it, there might be more people going there.
1658113	1658653	Maybe someday.
1660394	1662695	I trust that we're at the top of
1663465	1664967	Our favorite sites.
1667170	1667930	And that's all it really gets.
1667950	1669572	That's alright, we're just underground, yo.
1670433	1671074	We're just underground.
1671114	1672516	We're way under the radar.
1674218	1675759	We're like... We're like underground.
1676981	1677261	That's right.
1677301	1677982	In a bomb shelter.
1678483	1678903	That's right.
1679183	1680385	I'm not in a bomb shelter.
1681026	1682127	I'm in the land of awesome.
1683340	1697445	Anyway, speaking of something that could be awesome, but I sincerely doubt it, is that there is a rumor about a Mortal Kombat game that will feature characters from the DC Universe trying to do a versus type of thing.
1698525	1701767	But, yeah, I don't know how I feel about that.
1701887	1703807	In fact, I feel that it's going to be kind of dumb.
1704708	1705228	What is that?
1705388	1707909	A ramp I see there and a tank with sharks.
1708989	1710129	What's going to happen soon?
1710970	1711490	I wonder.
1712298	1713199	DC vs. Mortal Kombat DC vs. Mortal Kombat
1731326	1733948	In fact, this reeks of fanboyism to me.
1734008	1734609	I don't even think it's true.
1734629	1737591	The difference between Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter is that Street Fighter is a good game.
1738352	1739633	Mortal Kombat's fun.
1739953	1742355	The next game that they're going to do is going to be a versus game.
1742935	1744436	They never said it was versus DC.
1746518	1747419	Although that would make sense.
1747439	1751462	To be honest, I think the Mortal Kombat series, DC, I don't think would go for it if you think about it.
1751622	1757507	I mean, granted, I think DC versus Street Fighter makes sense because it's more comic book-y and stuff.
1758027	1759268	Mortal Kombat is just kind of violent.
1760646	1760926	I don't know.
1761126	1762567	Well, maybe they're going to change Mortal Kombat's image.
1762587	1771750	They should be like Mortal Kombat versus Monsters of Horror or something like that, where they have Freddy and Jason and shit like that.
1772431	1775292	You know why I like the Mortal Kombat games, especially the more recent one?
1775372	1781254	I like them because they have more than just the fighting game stuff in them, like the kart thing, the adventure modes.
1781494	1784035	The games have quite a bit of depth.
1784255	1784556	I don't know.
1784616	1787217	I mean, they're not like OMG, drop everything.
1787237	1789658	They're no Soul Calibur 2, that's for sure, but they're fun.
1791323	1791703	I don't know.
1792504	1794224	I think you guys are being too hard on Mortal Kombat.
1794345	1794705	It's fun.
1795105	1795305	Yeah.
1796145	1797126	You guys are just tough to please.
1797846	1798907	I am tough to please.
1799447	1803809	Anyways, one game though that I do like is Saints Row.
1803929	1807371	And Saints Row 2 has been confirmed for PlayStation 3 and the 360.
1807891	1810653	Some of the changes coming with the brand new version of the game.
1811373	1817016	Of course, it's going to bring back Stillwater as well as including some improvements.
1817509	1828257	to the online game, both the online co-op now being added and multiplayer, open world multiplayer matches, so that's kind of cool.
1828698	1837384	I mean, don't get me wrong, the multiplayer is okay, but I kind of wish that it was open world, like Grand Theft Auto on the PSP and stuff like that.
1838205	1845050	I mean, after a while, those three maps that you have for deathmatch really get old, so...
1847332	1847812	DanceOnline.com
1868815	1874778	Dance Online is that dancing MMO that was created by David Perry, who also made Earthworm Jim.
1874798	1878240	I played it a long time ago, and I wasn't that impressed with it.
1878881	1890467	It didn't have a lot of songs that really grabbed me, but now I've got to go back and take a look because Dance Online has gotten some updates, and they have apparently made some type of agreement with Warner Brothers Records or Warner Music.
1891107	1892268	There are now songs from...
1892888	1900372	Ashley Tisdale, The Ramones, The Click 5, 30 Songs from Warner Music, also in the game now, Paris Hilton.
1900952	1901652	You know you wanna.
1901872	1902252	What?
1902733	1903213	No, I don't.
1903633	1904654	No, no, no.
1904694	1905274	You know you wanna.
1905434	1909416	Also added more items to the shop for more customization.
1910116	1911537	Over 150 hairstyles.
1912277	1914078	And apparently the game has also added
1914482	1915702	DarkTetsuya says, pass.
1944215	1946379	MrDeBucket says, David Perry for the lose.
1947180	1947360	Ouch.
1948021	1950746	ShadowCharlie says, play Supernova 2 for Ashley Tisdale.
1951387	1954291	You know, a sad time or a sad sign that things are changing.
1954331	1957797	You know how like our show started off like, you know, because we met all playing DDR.
1957817	1958939	We were all about the DDR.
1959377	1959837	Thanks for watching!
1979947	1986892	I just don't want to buy... Well, first off, I'm not buying DDR Haas Party unless I get it for free.
1987332	1990094	And then Supernova 2, I listened to the music.
1990795	1992876	I was disappointed with the Trip Machine remix.
1993257	1993857	It was crap.
1994498	1994718	So...
1997389	1999650	And then... Is that your official review?
1999670	2002311	I don't know.
2002431	2004612	I did like the Fascination Max remix, though.
2004972	2008413	It reminded me a lot of Healing Vision and then Healing Vision Angelic.
2008513	2011074	That kind of remix of it.
2011514	2016596	And then I didn't... Some of the songs, though, they didn't have ripped from it, though.
2016676	2018477	Like Volcano, I didn't get to hear.
2018517	2020017	But some of the other ones were okay.
2020718	2021458	I think, though...
2022708	2023388	I'll have to try it.
2023848	2027410	I want an actual machine to be out here, though, instead of having to play it on the PlayStation 2.
2028710	2029890	But hopefully I'll get to play it soon.
2031251	2034852	All right, well, one thing we're going to get to do very soon is open up the mailbag.
2035152	2041114	That's right, you guys email us every week at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and we read some of our favorites here on the program.
2041555	2045716	So, DarkSakura, jump in the mailbag, pull out some letters, let's see what we got.
2049037	2050298	First email.
2050598	2051518	Dun-dun-dun!
2052281	2057804	It comes from, uh... Well, you didn't give a nickname, so I'm just gonna say Aaron.
2058305	2060026	Hi, first of all, I want to say I love the show.
2060086	2062747	It's the only podcast I listen to that doesn't ever bore me.
2063227	2065149	It's funny, entertaining, and informative.
2065329	2067990	As for Rob's comments about Facebook, I totally agree.
2068391	2074154	It's so annoying to log in and have, like, five invitations for apps that you don't care about.
2074594	2078056	I don't think that it's as bad as MySpace, but I do think Facebook is headed in that direction.
2078537	2079197	I am not alone.
2079297	2080678	I got a Facebook, too, and I...
2081735	2082215	I hate it.
2083316	2088080	I mean, I do kind of like getting the notifications on my phone sometimes, but that shit gets old.
2089141	2090722	Anyway, to continue.
2091162	2092744	I also have a few comments on Halo 3.
2093104	2093985	I love the first game.
2094045	2095326	It's the reason I bought an Xbox.
2095806	2101711	I was disappointed in Halo 2, and not long after Halo 2, I stopped telling people that I played it because I didn't want them to think I was a stupid frat boy.
2106574	2107175	Anyway, that was gross.
2108073	2112274	I eventually stopped playing Halo 2 with anyone I didn't know because of the ignorant people on Xbox Live.
2112894	2117816	I'm excited for Halo 3, but I won't be going to the midnight release because of the people that will be there.
2118656	2128918	I think the Halo series started out well and the games are still solid, but the atmosphere surrounding the games has dissolved into one blatant commercialism and poor sportsmanship, for lack of a better word.
2129219	2129959	Love this show, guys.
2129999	2130419	Keep it up.
2130539	2130739	Erin.
2131730	2137152	Yeah, I seem to remember we were talking about last week, you know, who's actually going to the midnight release.
2137532	2139412	Do we hear from anyone who actually went?
2139752	2141073	This guy said he wanted to go.
2142193	2143734	All right.
2146214	2148635	Well, shall I move forward to the next one, Rob?
2148655	2150816	You may.
2150856	2151576	OLR Dudes and Chicks.
2151616	2153837	I'm playing Worms 2 Open Warfare on my PSP-2000.
2155399	2155940	T-A-R-D is TARD
2180202	2183983	Yeah, TARD is slang for retard, which is a naughty word.
2184003	2188764	They also censored death, because I had a team death something.
2188784	2190085	Can you play this online?
2190945	2191045	No.
2191485	2193606	You can play it on Wi-Fi.
2193686	2195306	Well, then why bother censoring it?
2195326	2196767	The person's got to be in the room with you.
2197867	2198367	I don't get it.
2198847	2199708	That's overdoing it.
2199748	2200308	That's from Dark Raven.
2200448	2201188	That's overdoing it.
2201868	2207510	No, it's being censored because I guess TARD is a bad word, and so anything with that in it, you know...
2208226	2209007	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2239122	2242704	I just wanted to say how great a birthday present it would be if it ended up happening.
2269819	2272640	Let's take a minute to talk about Galaxy Wars Cats.
2275402	2279023	Genius Marketing Campaign, those folks at Geometry Wars Galaxy.
2279043	2281623	Have you seen the site, gwgcats.com?
2282303	2286684	Somebody's taken the lolcats trend and made an advertising campaign out of it.
2287524	2292865	I think the advertising campaign for Geometry Wars Galaxies is brilliant because you can even watch the commercial.
2292905	2293425	Like, wait, hold on.
2293445	2294206	I'm going to go to the site.
2294746	2295066	I'm sorry.
2295106	2297646	I don't care if I sound like a consumer whore, but you know what?
2297846	2301407	I've seen so many lame video game commercials, and you might think this is lame.
2302489	2303009	But I don't care.
2303069	2303609	I think it's funny.
2304669	2306110	They have this in theaters.
2306210	2306890	This is so great.
2307130	2312531	There's Geometry Wars and they have all these things like, I'm in your solar system on top of your leaderboards.
2312991	2316252	I'm in your battle grids topping your highest score and just all this funny stuff.
2316592	2326094	But then if you actually go to the website for Geometry Wars Galaxies, the little trailer for the game has a remake of Particle Man, which is so awesome.
2326704	2329406	Hold on, I gotta play a little clip of the song from the trailer.
2329666	2332168	This is from geometrywarsgalaxies.com slash US.
2332208	2336731	Particle man, particle man, doing the things a particle can.
2337132	2338052	What's he like?
2338192	2339453	It's not important.
2339674	2343116	Particle man, is he a dot or is he a speck?
2343376	2345618	When he's underwater, does he get wet?
2345978	2348200	Or does the water get him instead?
2348240	2348880	Cause get it?
2348920	2352183	Cause it's like triangle man and I don't know, it's funny.
2353024	2353624	That's great.
2353925	2354925	Is that They Might Be Giants?
2355305	2357627	No, it's like... Oh, unless they redid the song.
2357667	2358768	It's definitely not the original.
2359128	2362190	Well, I mean, I was going to say, because the voice was kind of... A little bit.
2362530	2362870	Could have been.
2363530	2363851	Yeah.
2364711	2365171	Great.
2365612	2365872	Love it.
2366692	2369114	Well, then the next email, then, if you are ready...
2370250	2378175	Actually, real quickly, I just want to say, Black Wolf, of course, our old buddy Bobby B is in chat right now, and he does his own show, of course, on all games.
2378195	2383278	It also airs on Sunday nights, and sometimes when he's done with his show, he'll come listen to ours for a little bit because he's awesome.
2383778	2387961	And he says, oh, man, that email was a mass email to a lot of podcasts.
2387981	2391002	I think he said that about the last email, the one about the worms, too.
2391703	2394724	So somebody is, like, mass emailing podcasts with the same question.
2395205	2395665	Amazing.
2396505	2397306	We got spammed.
2398641	2402724	I wonder if they're trying to see if the different podcasts give different answers, if it's some type of survey.
2403385	2408789	Well then, I wonder if they're spamming all the podcasts about whether their penis needs to be larger too.
2409910	2416475	Or maybe they're trying to spam all the podcasts with a Worms 2 email so people will actually talk about Worms 2 on the podcast.
2416515	2418737	We just bought it, hook, line, and sinker.
2418977	2422800	There's a bunch of people who think that I need a bigger penis too, apparently in my email.
2423140	2425562	So we actually deleted my email address.
2426543	2427904	I don't think it'll work, but good luck.
2428277	2428717	You never know.
2428977	2434639	Well, if they get them back, then they have auto-delete things or some shit.
2434679	2436260	I'm actually thinking about changing it anyway.
2436420	2436640	Yeah.
2436940	2437180	All right.
2438200	2440641	But anyway, next email now, please, please, please, please.
2440681	2441241	Yes, yes, yes.
2441321	2442722	Can I has email, Rob?
2442762	2443862	Yes, you can has email.
2444716	2447400	Last episode, Loki said, nothing is original anymore.
2448021	2449362	Originality is hard to find.
2449723	2455671	One of my favorite quotes is from one of my design teachers is, you are only as original as your sources are obscure.
2456232	2457614	Games are the same as design.
2457674	2458515	I do agree with that.
2460177	2461758	Talk about a reward for good gaming.
2488846	2491467	or the end for Final Fantasy 2 in the US.
2491507	2492928	That's Final Fantasy 4 overseas.
2493608	2495709	The page turning with the great music, it was incredible.
2495849	2498490	I sat and smiled contentedly for a good half an hour.
2499250	2503491	I can actually say the same thing about Final Fantasy 6, well 3 over here when it came out.
2503992	2510374	Was that I actually finally decided to wait and be patient and wait for Shadow to catch up with you so that he doesn't die.
2511174	2511775	Spoiler!
2512595	2514275	And got the ending with everybody alive.
2514295	2515656	And that made me happy.
2516966	2518346	and even retarded Gogo.
2539525	2540285	The Stupid Mimic
2569556	2570276	It was weird.
2571977	2574398	At any rate, now I look for these things.
2574518	2577239	I want to care about my characters on normal story-based games.
2577599	2578900	It's not always easy to find.
2579040	2589523	I get by these days with a good triple Windfury crit on any gnome anywhere, or seriously just killing anything alliance, but that kind of quick fix can't replace the more in-depth stuff.
2590124	2594465	What are some of the moments that got you guys all teary-eyed or made you jump like an idiot?
2595406	2596526	Let's hear it for the gamers.
2597071	2601154	Spelled G-A-Y-M-E-R-S Apparently Seattle is the gamer mecca Really?
2601174	2624371	And that comes from No Soul Boy I knew there was a reason I liked Seattle No, uh Let's see, games that got me Well, okay, games that got me a jump would be Silent Hill Like any of them Games that got me all Well, I actually Cared when Eris died in Final Fantasy 7 I cheered You're a bitch I'm not a bitch, I hated her the entire fucking game
2625427	2628750	and oh my god, I hated her and I was so happy when she died.
2628810	2629911	I got a little choked.
2629971	2631812	I got verklempt when that happened.
2632913	2635475	Actually, I got a little verklempt playing Eternal Sonata the other day.
2635495	2637376	That game is sad.
2637476	2639678	It's about all these dying kids and stuff.
2639758	2640278	It's kind of sad.
2640339	2648445	I laughed my ass off during the bitch slap fight in Final Fantasy VII between Scarlet and Tifa and...
2649634	2652878	Oh God, there was a game, though, that made me completely freaking bawl.
2654059	2656442	And I couldn't remember what it was, because it was a few years ago.
2658204	2667615	I do know one game that completely cracked me up, and that was... Now, crap, I can't remember the name of it, but it had the girl with the red pigtails, and she used a...
2670333	2674295	The Rings, The Chakram for her weapons, and you could play as either the girl or the boy.
2674835	2680218	And it had a really cool name in Japan, and then it came out with, like, Winds of Fate in the U.S.
2681238	2685220	But that game had lots of crack me up bunny moments, because she was just over the top.
2687201	2689922	I can't remember the game that made me freaking bawl like a baby, though.
2691623	2694184	It was, like, people dying in the game.
2694305	2695145	Mario is Missing.
2696051	2697754	I can't believe he's missing!
2697934	2699437	I can't believe I'm playing this game!
2699557	2700599	I can't find him!
2700679	2701119	I'm so mad!
2709908	2713089	People go to YouTube and look up Asshole Mario.
2713189	2714489	That's some talent.
2714529	2715910	I love Asshole Mario.
2716130	2723472	It's people who what they did is took Super Mario Brothers and did ROM hacks with it to make these intensely hard levels.
2723812	2726993	And the thing about these hard levels is that they are not unplayable.
2727702	2729083	You can beat them.
2729303	2733466	But you have to have the mad skills to do it.
2733966	2736048	And time and patience and be willing to die.
2736248	2744113	The only thing that's annoying about the Asshole Mario levels is that they keep showing people dying over and over and over again.
2744653	2749116	And what they should do is just show someone playing through the level and then show them dying.
2750017	2756501	My favorite was how they showed just the very start of the game and the very first level the guy goes into.
2757031	2758612	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2786866	2788327	It's like an invisible coin block.
2789127	2790488	Anyway, back to the email, shall I?
2790608	2790828	Yes.
2791608	2792709	Okay.
2792749	2795270	This is addressed to me, and then you guys in parentheses.
2796791	2798132	This is Rob with 2Bs, by the way.
2798252	2798752	Who's it from?
2799412	2800193	I just told you, Rob.
2800513	2801553	Oh, hi, Rob and 2Bs.
2802634	2807136	There's a little war of words going on between a site called GameTwat.
2807976	2808857	I think that's great.
2809437	2811958	It just gets funnier each time you think slash say it.
2812579	2815320	And GamePolitics, as well as GP versus JackiePoo.
2816075	2818197	GameCock is a publisher, or a developer?
2818217	2818417	Developer.
2818457	2818778	Developer.
2840635	2846097	I think people need to lighten up and realize how we secretly enjoy the antics between Jackie Poo and GP Butting Heads.
2846578	2848158	GT is funny if you let it.
2848719	2857262	I personally believe that porn court filing story on Jackie Poo was his attempt to show the judge was biased against him in the case versus the Florida Bar.
2857643	2860224	Mission accomplished, but now the legal system is against him.
2860984	2865366	Sorry for the misquote, but if you strike Jackie Poo down, he'll become stronger than ever.
2866812	2871397	I'd rather we adopt a meh attitude and maybe he'll start eating crayons as recreational drugs.
2872097	2872658	Raw bubba.
2873098	2874320	And he wrote bubba afterwards.
2880225	2882348	This GameTwat site looks like Perez Hilton.
2885311	2887833	It's awfully pink and that joystick looks like a cock.
2888494	2888594	Um...
2890586	2892287	BlackWolf in chat says something interesting.
2892327	2895569	He says, wow, GameTwat is getting really too much publicity over this.
2895909	2897350	So what's the debate?
2898091	2899692	What are they mad at each other about?
2900592	2901072	I don't get it.
2904475	2907496	Hold on, I'm trying to figure this out, because GameTwat interviewed him.
2907717	2910538	I can't believe he would have interviewed with a site called GameTwat.
2912219	2912860	What the hell?
2913280	2915501	Hi, we're with GameTwat, we want to interview you.
2917803	2919704	Whatever, I don't want to get involved in the drama.
2921024	2922605	It's more publicity for both sites.
2922705	2923926	I mean, we just reported on it.
2923966	2925287	Congratulations to both sites.
2925848	2927409	We need to start a fight with somebody.
2927970	2929070	Who can we start a fight with?
2929111	2929891	How about all games?
2930432	2932133	No, that's too obvious.
2932153	2932914	How about Bobby?
2932934	2933934	Bobby, we're going to start a fight with you.
2933974	2934255	Is that okay?
2934275	2935215	That's too obvious.
2935295	2936837	It's too obvious if we start a fight with somebody.
2936857	2939038	I'll start a fight with you when it makes sense.
2939659	2942201	What about the developer of the Eye of Judgment?
2943627	2947569	I wanted to make a correction to that rather formal review of Earth Defense Forces sent in last week.
2947609	2950491	There are more enemy types than just ants in the game but it turns out they're the best.
2972538	2978762	By the way, having played Metal Slug Anthology this week, I agree with Loki that every Metal Slug game is exactly the same, even if they are really fun.
2978822	2981243	Enemies, weapons, and even goddamn mini-bosses are repeated.
2983124	2984025	You know what, so.
2984665	2987146	You can get turned into undead in the later ones.
2989988	2991809	To continue, last one.
2992309	2993370	Dun-dun-dun.
2994931	2997272	Hi, OLR people, this is Maury again.
2998406	3015788	earlier this week I was able to get a Wii with money from various sources and so far I've been enjoying it immensely my house has been lacking in a home version of DDR for quite some time so I splurged and picked up the new DDR hottest party bundle that came out Tuesday I think anywho the game's in a nutshell excellent
3016635	3018876	It's easily the best DDR home version in a while.
3019236	3025197	The song list is a tad shorter than the average game by about 50 total, but most of those songs are actually fun to play.
3025257	3026958	About half of it consists of licenses.
3027038	3030999	They're all covers, but they range in quality from good to questionable.
3032179	3034480	For some reason, the 80s ones tend to be the most fun.
3034540	3037460	Blue Monday by New Order is the first one that comes to mind.
3037840	3040161	The original songs in the game are pretty awesome, too.
3041001	3044202	Furthermore, whoever did the step charts for this game needs to stay around forever.
3045200	3047301	There's a wide range of difficulty.
3047861	3052702	A couple of genuine 10-footers in the other charts are fun without being mind-numbingly boring.
3053382	3060684	The Wii remote motions are kind of hard to get the hang of, though, and the game doesn't give you any advice besides swinging the controller.
3061285	3066086	As far as I can tell, the best way to do it is to hold the remote and nunchuck in front of you vertically and swing them forward.
3066917	3069521	Oh, and the new Love Shine remix is rad.
3070042	3071224	Finally, a quick question.
3071324	3073087	What other Wii games are good at the moment?
3073147	3074068	I'm into quirky stuff.
3074168	3074970	Cheers, Mori.
3077453	3078555	I still love Trauma Center.
3079016	3081660	If you really want quirky, escape from Bug Island.
3083365	3084446	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3113615	3136503	The possible fight between OLR and Blackwolf He says, we tried to fight However, Loki refused to play Chromehounds So I won by default Dude, it was like me and some other person I think I already sold my copy back GS68 says also that we should be fighting with Bobby Blackwolf See, that doesn't work Mr. DeBucket suggests that we should have a fight with Tekken Games
3137751	3139431	BlackWolf suggested that we fight one up.
3162526	3165627	But I'm like, I'll fight him with a cricket bat.
3165647	3167708	That fight's so 2006.
3168389	3169869	I'm over my issues with 1UP.
3170750	3171610	I'm over my issues.
3174311	3174651	Whatever.
3174771	3178053	I guess so we can't fight anybody, so we have to love everybody.
3178953	3180294	Hugs and kisses all around.
3181074	3181954	We love everyone.
3183695	3186936	The Nintendo Wii online development staff, how about that?
3186956	3188117	Let's fight them.
3188553	3193136	No, but we need a good fight, like a really good bang-up fight that people will report on.
3193196	3197118	Because it's like, you know, OLR threatened to kill somebody's family or something.
3197358	3197939	No.
3199440	3200820	Can't threaten to kill families.
3200840	3202101	That's illegal.
3202221	3203742	I know, it is illegal.
3204763	3205403	Alright.
3206584	3209346	We need to get some really good dirt on somebody and start a fight with them.
3209886	3210827	Be good for publicity.
3211447	3212408	Can you work on that, Loki?
3212448	3214249	You have ties in dark places.
3214389	3216350	Get some dirt on another cast.
3218407	3218927	All right, anyway.
3219227	3223250	Yeah, don't you know, I'm just like the fucking sleuth.
3223430	3224530	All right, then get some news.
3225971	3226411	God.
3226671	3235756	Anyways, so, you know, when I'm not digging up dirt, apparently, we're going to be talking about Square Enix, and they're focusing on overseas.
3237497	3239398	Yeah, that's a surprise.
3240558	3243480	I guess, you know, of course, since they're only known, well...
3244096	3247017	Square Enix is mainly known for the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest series.
3247357	3250958	A lot of other stuff that they used to do, unfortunately, never saw remixes.
3251618	3252738	I really want Einhander.
3253298	3264501	But now apparently they're going to be focusing on overseas markets that have increased more than three times the size of the Japanese market.
3265161	3265981	Thank God!
3266101	3270022	Maybe that means we'll actually get Final Fantasy XIII in a timely manner.
3271325	3274887	So they're having to wait for Japan to get it and then us getting it way afterwards.
3275608	3280731	So they had apparently two strategies planned to seize the opportunities.
3281091	3290837	First, they're of course going to increase their distribution channel ties throughout both the United States and I believe in Europe.
3291618	3300424	And of course, the second is developing more titles overall.
3300744	3300924	Yeah.
3301781	3302081	Gary's Mod
3326311	3335154	59.99 on the 360, 49.99 on the PC, Half-Life 2, 1 and 2, Team Fortress 2, and as Loki said, Portal, all in the orange box.
3335415	3341037	Well, maybe this is the perfect opportunity for me to check it out because I haven't really played Half-Life a whole lot.
3341397	3342097	I mean, a little bit.
3343758	3346779	But I don't play a lot of these first-person shooters and stuff.
3346799	3349860	So if you're going to buy it, Loki, then I'll check it out when you get it.
3350220	3350380	Okay.
3351559	3356801	But it's gone gold, so those of you guys that are excited about it, I know there's a couple people on my Twitter that are really excited about the Orange Box.
3357561	3358781	It's on its way very soon.
3359722	3360922	So take a look for it.
3362302	3367904	Well, I can't say that I'm too excited about this bit of news because honestly I don't give a crap about it.
3369204	3380768	But some people are happy about it, so for anyone who's interested in the Sam & Max series, Season 2 will be on GameTap starting November 8th for those who have subscribed for it.
3381705	3384367	and it has Ice Station Santa.
3386689	3391193	For the person who emailed earlier about the quirky games, here you go, Sam & Max.
3391693	3393534	I think this is a good little quirky game.
3394135	3394515	Fun to play.
3394595	3395116	Enjoy.
3395836	3396857	You don't like Sam & Max?
3397237	3398138	I never got into it.
3398999	3399439	It's fun.
3399739	3400139	It's cute.
3402721	3403342	And funny.
3404837	3413184	I like how it's the only episodic game I can think of that actually continued to put out episodes.
3413244	3416306	Most episodic games you hear about die after two episodes.
3416346	3416866	You know what I mean?
3417087	3417747	Shenmue.
3418007	3419028	What?
3419588	3426373	Shenmue was supposed to be a series of... They were supposed to have a whole line of them giving episodes of What's-His-Face's quest.
3426414	3432198	But see, somebody just pooped and quit along the way, and this...
3433055	3434815	I blame all the Dreamcast haters.
3436476	3438896	So hooray to it being a good episodic game.
3442837	3444217	I did not drop my microphone.
3445417	3445617	So.
3446558	3448418	All right, we're going to open the Skype line very soon.
3448458	3454119	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
3454179	3456019	But one more story before we get to that.
3458220	3458480	Yes.
3458500	3458560	Yes.
3459286	3470473	Anyways, so it's a little bit disappointing because this was one of the big features of Unreal Tournament 3 for the PlayStation 3, but no cross-platform play.
3471694	3474555	It was apparently too hard to make, so they scrapped it.
3475196	3482620	So you'll only be able to play people on the PC if you have the PC version, and only be able to play people on the PlayStation 3 if you have the PlayStation 3 version.
3485322	3485662	So sad.
3486078	3489160	So people on PCs cannot play people on PlayStation 3s.
3489400	3489861	That's correct.
3490501	3491181	Which is kind of sad.
3491582	3492082	That's a bummer.
3493183	3496925	All right, well, we are going to open up the Skype line over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
3496985	3503149	Our username, of course, is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype, or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3503229	3506692	Let's open up the Skype line and see who can get on through.
3508093	3509354	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3509374	3509774	Who's this?
3511155	3512816	It's the one and only Legend of Zaku.
3513036	3514517	Hello, Legend of Zaku.
3514657	3515878	What's on your mind, my friend?
3517175	3521458	Just dealing with the aftermath of Digital Life this weekend.
3521758	3525660	I was hoping some of the New Yorkers would call in and tell us all about Digital Life.
3525800	3527221	I didn't get a chance to go.
3528282	3529862	As you know, I wanted to go and I didn't get to go.
3530283	3535926	Somebody on my Twitter said, well, not that I should be thankful I didn't go, but that it wasn't that good this year.
3535946	3537227	You should be glad that you didn't go.
3537247	3542309	Let's just say a lot of drama is... Oh shit, what happened?
3542369	3543270	Alright, what happened, Zaku?
3544344	3547107	Okay, I just want to make this a short story.
3547127	3552371	I don't want to get people entangled in our current, you know, in the current affairs of our community.
3552471	3554713	Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, Saku, wait, hold on.
3555274	3556835	Remember we were talking about that fight earlier?
3558016	3560238	Here we go, I bet we're about to start a fight right here.
3561239	3561619	Okay.
3561900	3562180	Alright.
3562400	3569827	To sum it up, basically, the biggest complaints right now were regarding freestyle and the way the rest of the other tournaments were run.
3570687	3571288	Basically, the
3572381	3591296	Alright, for starters, the way freestyle turned out, in other words, people accusing the judges of favoritism, and, you know, people pissing and moaning on why certain of their, you know, their favorite, you know, freestylers didn't place at all, and there was a lot of name-calling.
3592196	3604700	A lot of, you know, it even got to the point where one of the players from Expert Tech actually cursed out one of the organizers right there.
3605920	3609781	And he got DQ'd but then ended up staying after apologizing.
3612768	3613749	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3632768	3634610	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3653229	3660472	Just, you know, it's just a lot of immature bullshit that's just spanning four pages on the Freak right now.
3660953	3661793	I don't want to get into it.
3661853	3662353	Okay, hold on.
3662993	3663694	Okay, so fine.
3663754	3665475	Go to DDR Freak for your DDR drama.
3665535	3668496	However, did this ruin digital life single-handedly?
3668516	3669797	Did one little fight ruin the show?
3669877	3670637	How did that go?
3670797	3672838	No, it turned out pretty good.
3672858	3679301	There was a lot of people that really complimented and really praised the organizers for running it.
3681269	3687616	The Padmisses were another issue that certain people had sour grapes over.
3687776	3698028	The way it was set up was that the machines were on the stage, and since the stage itself is not as secure as something like the ground,
3699251	3701033	They have no choice but to put it up there.
3701714	3705297	They have no say in where the machines are actually placed.
3705317	3710462	The sponsors, the people running Digital Life, require them to put the machines up on the stage.
3710502	3711343	No, it's not even that.
3711423	3711983	It's just...
3722924	3723965	Let's just put it this way.
3724025	3727987	Pad misses were just caused by the instability of the stage.
3728287	3732289	Just having all the machines and people up there.
3734650	3737271	The censors just going off like that.
3737291	3740373	That was one of the biggest complaints by certain people.
3741613	3749257	They agreed with the judgment calls because the people running and taking down the scores were very meticulous.
3749847	3756910	and making sure that whatever score was received was the fairest and most accurate score out there.
3756950	3762913	Tell me one thing in digital life that was cool that has nothing to do with DDR.
3763693	3764673	Guitar Hero 3.
3765354	3769375	It's alright though, but I mean... It's fine.
3770236	3772076	He was within the confines of the question.
3772336	3774137	Alright, so Guitar Hero 3, how was it?
3775018	3775898	It was alright, I mean...
3776650	3780014	I only played it once, but so far it's just nice graphics.
3780094	3781216	That's all same gameplay.
3781716	3782237	New songs.
3782678	3783819	New songs, same gameplay.
3784019	3786743	Yeah, but I just can't get my mind off of, you know...
3788687	3792490	of the 800 pound gorilla in the room, which is the DDR tournament.
3792670	3794972	That's still lingering right now.
3795993	3802478	I just hope next year we just fix what we had to that went wrong this time.
3803198	3804680	I can't take the DDR talk anymore.
3804720	3805320	I'm sorry.
3806021	3807442	I had to hit the red button to end it.
3808502	3810064	I can't deal with the DDR drama anymore.
3810084	3810764	I'm sorry, guys.
3813466	3814968	If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR
3817242	3818463	Username OrangeLoungeRadio.
3818563	3819724	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
3819744	3820165	Who's this?
3821045	3821786	It's GS68.
3821906	3822927	Hi, GS68.
3822947	3825069	What DDR drama would you like to report on tonight?
3827491	3829232	Actually, not really DDR drama.
3829252	3831994	I just want to say drama in general sucks ass.
3832115	3833736	Yeah, drama in general is kind of crappy.
3834016	3834997	Like, someone...
3835660	3839902	Violated the card line thingy today when I was playing Maximum Tune 3
3854028	3854669	Now we get into it.
3883922	3885143	Can't we all just get along?
3885283	3886343	I mean, seriously, people?
3886383	3889265	Y'all are fighting each other over... And here's the thing.
3889745	3892786	You're starting fights over Dance Dance Revolution.
3893967	3895808	Can't anyone see the comedy in this?
3896088	3903531	And then now you're calling people a fag because they beat you to playing Midnight Maximum Tune.
3904252	3906853	And this gives you the right to call other people gay?
3907934	3908634	Come on!
3909898	3913501	Because, you know, making it to a machine first is a really different sexuality.
3913521	3913881	Oh my god, I know.
3913901	3924368	His penis must be so large that I'd be like, you know... How would you deal with someone hogging the machine when your turn was next?
3924969	3925289	Anyway.
3926510	3927211	Drama sucks.
3927271	3927771	Tell me something.
3927791	3929452	I need to hear a happy story, GS68.
3929692	3931113	Something good happened this week, didn't it?
3931213	3931534	Anything?
3931634	3931914	Something?
3931934	3936938	Well, since news sites don't cover arcade games, I'll cover the arcade games myself.
3937138	3938739	I finally got to play Initial D for...
3939767	3941408	Oh, I didn't even know Initial D4 came out.
3941468	3941889	How was that?
3943190	3943690	It was alright.
3943730	3947013	I like the drifty physics because it felt more like drift racing.
3947793	3949995	Is that something that's new over Initial D3?
3951116	3963645	Yeah, Initial D3, there was some drifting, but you couldn't see it unless you were in third-person view, which was useless because the camera wasn't right on your butt, so it's very hard to control your car.
3965967	3968309	And does it still have all the fabulous Eurobeat in Initial D4?
3969335	3973136	Yeah, but I heard you can't pick your own song and just randomly choose for you.
3973697	3978018	That's so that the same person doesn't play Heartbeat over and over and over again because they don't know how to change the song.
3978038	3979739	That's probably a good thing.
3979759	3981660	Well, now I'm hearing Speedcar over and over.
3982260	3988162	Like, the song goes, Speedcar, Speedcar, AE86 is coming.
3989743	3992364	Now suddenly we've turned into a singing karaoke show.
3992404	3992944	No, that's right.
3992964	3995965	You know, all Eurobeat songs sound the same.
3996025	3998166	This is the strangest Skyblind segment ever.
3999292	4003375	877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio Give us a call, let's talk
4025546	4026667	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4026727	4027087	Who's this?
4027647	4028948	This is Brad from PodCulture.
4029008	4030469	Hello, Brad from PodCulture.
4030509	4031230	So good to hear from you.
4031270	4031790	What's on your mind?
4032731	4037033	Well, you said you wanted to hear from somebody who was crazy enough to be in a midnight launch of Halo 3.
4037073	4039655	Oh, and let me guess.
4039735	4040736	It was you, wasn't it?
4041316	4041636	Oh, yeah.
4041876	4042197	All right.
4042237	4042917	So why?
4043017	4045078	Why did you have to be there at midnight?
4045639	4047260	I mean, you couldn't wait till the next day?
4048372	4050254	It's more of a social thing than anything else.
4050515	4051536	I agree with that.
4051796	4059263	He had to be there because someone cut in front of him for Midnight Maximum Tune 3 and the stage was unstable for DDR.
4059944	4066009	Well, when I had pre-ordered my copy at Best Buy, they had said that they were going to be open until midnight.
4067431	4068632	Ours here in Louisville weren't.
4070174	4070754	Hmm.
4071114	4071615	Louisville?
4072324	4072824	Louisville.
4073324	4074105	Louisville, Kentucky.
4074565	4076506	Sorry, for a second I thought it was Lowellville.
4076566	4078907	It looks like Louisville.
4080147	4082988	Only city can take a horse race and turn it into a three week party.
4085729	4086169	You know what?
4086469	4086730	What?
4087550	4092772	My uncle used to live there for a little while and that's exactly the same way he described it.
4093632	4100835	He lived there for a little while with some woman that he was seeing and then he moved to right outside Nashville.
4102222	4103782	Which is almost as bad.
4104783	4106923	All right, so you were in the line in Louisville.
4108223	4110104	Actually, I went to three different lines, actually.
4110324	4112104	Dang, so you had to go all around.
4112844	4120946	Well, the Best Buy wasn't open, so our co-host, Glenn, had his pre-order at a GameStop over in Indiana.
4122006	4123766	So that's about 15, 20 minutes away.
4123806	4126987	So I drove over there to meet him, and they didn't have any more of the collector's edition.
4128343	4128663	Wow.
4129163	4132505	So I drove over to meet a friend at another GameStop here in Louisville.
4132745	4135707	They didn't have any and wound up in line at Circuit City.
4136547	4136907	Wow.
4137908	4139488	Yeah, okay, Circuit City.
4139508	4142310	There's not a lot of people seem to shop at Circuit City anymore, so that makes sense.
4142330	4144391	No, there's only like 20 or 30 people in line.
4144431	4144951	See what I mean?
4146042	4159393	I remember when we went out, when the Nintendo Wii went on sale, we went around to all the different lines, which, by the way, yes, there is a difference between the Wii Midnight launch and this, is that you knew everybody was going to have Halo 3 coming out the ass the next day, but when the Wii came out, you had to be in line at midnight, or you weren't getting a Wii.
4160074	4162696	I finally saw a Wii on the shelf the other day.
4162816	4163336	There you go.
4164958	4165458	Big difference.
4165538	4168060	Anyway, yeah, there was like, what, four people at Circuit City?
4168440	4171583	Yeah, there was less than 20, 15, 20, 25 people, something like that.
4171603	4172264	But so you got it.
4174853	4178316	Yeah, I got it, and the guy ahead of me spent like 800 bucks.
4178996	4181639	That's right, you sent us a private message earlier, so he went all out.
4181679	4183840	Did he say why he was so crazy for Halo?
4185522	4190326	Well, if he hadn't actually had his girlfriend with him, I would have thought he hadn't moved out of his parents' basement yet.
4191807	4192948	He was pretty geeky.
4193248	4195109	Maybe the girlfriend lives with him in the parents' basement.
4195790	4196791	Well, that could be it, too.
4196911	4200013	Some girlfriends will visit their boyfriends in their parents' basement.
4201455	4201875	Sometimes.
4202575	4204337	And then they'll realize that he's kind of, you know...
4206002	4206923	Not desirable.
4206943	4207823	But he loves me.
4207843	4209924	800 bucks for a game.
4209944	4210565	That was crazy.
4210985	4212566	He hits me because he loves me.
4214027	4216208	Well, you know, we are in Kentucky here.
4216448	4220491	Hey, hey, I'm not from too much farther away from there, so...
4223021	4225323	It was actually a lot of fun hanging around talking to people.
4225683	4230686	Now you sent me a private message about some of the voice acting in Halo 3 that you discovered during the credits.
4230706	4232406	Some pretty popular sci-fi stars.
4232447	4233407	I know you love your sci-fi.
4233967	4236109	Who can we find in Halo 3 in the voice acting?
4236729	4240671	Nathan Fillion, Adam Baldwin, and Alan Tudyk from Firefly.
4241171	4241491	Cool.
4241832	4244153	And Katie Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica.
4244433	4246154	She is awesome and Bionic Woman now.
4247326	4249687	of which I missed on Wednesday, but I have a T-vote.
4249707	4250968	I'm going to watch it a little later.
4251008	4252409	She's freaking nuts on that show.
4252529	4254590	I hear she's the reason to watch that show.
4255090	4255290	Yeah.
4255390	4257872	So I'm definitely going to want to check that out.
4258492	4259012	Good times.
4260553	4261854	Maybe not A-list actors.
4261914	4266856	In the sci-fi world, they're definitely on the A-list, but some pretty well-known actors there for the Halo 3.
4267717	4271359	Every time I think of dude, I still cry over the end of Firefly.
4272299	4273540	Let's not do spoilers.
4274400	4275521	I'm not saying anything.
4275681	4275941	All right.
4277113	4277453	Oh, come on.
4277473	4278973	The movie's been out two years.
4279353	4279713	All right.
4279753	4280154	That's fine.
4280734	4283094	That was just a sucky way to die, okay?
4283174	4284014	That sucked.
4284594	4285614	I'm a leaf on the wind.
4285914	4287315	No, you're a leaf pinned to a chair.
4289115	4289895	Splat.
4291855	4292436	Oh, man.
4293416	4297476	I wanted to hunt Joss down and burn my Joss Whedon is my master now shirt.
4299497	4300277	All right, nerds.
4300437	4302777	We've got to wrap up this call and take some more nerdy calls.
4302817	4306558	I'm going to watch the Sarah Jane Adventures, I promise, since the new episodes are out.
4307663	4319553	Alright, catch you later guys Alright, take care Brad, thanks for calling Ask and ye shall receive We asked to hear from crazies that were in the Halo 3 line and we heard from one, that was great Let's go to the next call Hello, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?
4322955	4324416	Hello, can you hear us?
4324456	4325397	Yeah, hello?
4325457	4326498	Hi, hello, who's this?
4327279	4330381	Hey, what's going on, this is GZ This is who?
4330401	4335065	GZDR4E Okay, what's on your mind buddy?
4339168	4363094	Digital Life Retro Arcade Area Big Problem Apparently on VIP Day on Thursday, they wanted Billy Mitchell to have a photo op with the Donkey Kong machine I was playing on the machine, they told me to get off the machine
4364294	4365055	I refuse.
4365095	4368777	They threatened to take my VIP pass and kick me off the premises.
4369617	4372299	So I just let them have the machines.
4373480	4375141	Were you going for a high score or something?
4375181	4378763	I mean, like, were you about ready to be the new King of Kong?
4383006	4383486	What was that?
4385007	4386247	Just playing the machines.
4388180	4393981	So, I mean, how does that feel that they had to just kick you off there because somebody more important was in town and needed a photo op?
4394121	4395221	That's kind of got to suck.
4396682	4401002	Yeah, it's all about power there, I guess.
4401042	4408064	You're going to have to actually get the world record on the machine and then you'll be able to get on any Donkey Kong machine you want in the world.
4409664	4410504	There you have it.
4410624	4416225	So were you so mad that you just kind of left or did you walk around and check out other stuff that was at Digital Life?
4418194	4419174	No, I just left.
4419194	4419614	I was mad.
4419634	4422175	Yeah, I'll try again next year.
4422195	4425576	Anything else you want to share with our listeners?
4449392	4449952	Alright, take care.
4450132	4450752	Alright, take care.
4450772	4454253	I think there was connection problems there or something.
4454913	4458334	Thank you for sharing the injustices of Donkey Kong in this world.
4459935	4460475	Sorry to hear it.
4461275	4462956	Alright, let's go to the phones and take more calls.
4463816	4464896	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4464916	4465276	Who's this?
4466316	4471678	So I heard that they were holding the bar and that wasn't cool.
4473518	4475199	Welcome to DDR Drama Chat.
4475239	4476039	How can we help you?
4477395	4478135	No, this is Bobby.
4478176	4478816	What's going on, guys?
4478836	4479716	Hi, Bobby.
4479836	4480457	How are you?
4480557	4481317	It's good to hear from you.
4481357	4481878	What's on your mind?
4483158	4486520	You were asking about people that were in a Halo 3 midnight launch.
4488141	4489622	How did I know you'd call about this?
4489702	4490503	Yeah, what happened?
4490543	4491303	What's your story?
4492444	4499468	Well, actually, the full story I'm not going to go into, but I was actually up in Bellevue, Washington as a guest of Microsoft.
4499488	4502089	So I attended one of the big midnight launches.
4502109	4503450	I was not standing in line for it.
4504506	4506347	But it was a huge party.
4506647	4508168	Like, it was actually fun being there.
4508228	4509989	I had fun and I wasn't even getting the game.
4510609	4512910	And Master Chief, he's skinnier in person.
4513030	4514471	Just wanted to throw that out there.
4514871	4515211	Okay.
4516172	4517552	So what did you guys get to do?
4517612	4520554	Didn't you guys get to go hand out goodies to people in line and stuff?
4521494	4528958	Yeah, I handed out some Halo 3 shirts and we had some Halo 3 lanyards and these little $5 Burger King credit card things.
4529696	4543460	so we were giving out like it doesn't get you a Happy Meal or anything but it was at least $5 towards something and we were just giving those out to people in the line for doing stupid stuff or just throwing them out that sounds like fun were there tons of people there?
4544500	4552022	there were probably about 400 wow 400 to 500 people there all in line like stretched all the way down to the Home Depot that was across the parking lot dang
4552529	4579740	and everything and like Mountain Dew was giving out like big game fuel and all their other stuff and Ball showed up with this big huge van and Fungi showed up in a big charter bus coming straight from their launch party so they were all boozed up and giving out calendars and swag and Bill Gates showed up he shook hands with the first like 50 people in line right after he rolled out of bed but it was a big party I think Warren Moon was there and everybody was like we love you and Tecmo Ball
4582474	4588457	I wish we could have been there to hand out orange soda and cookies in our traditional fashion, but maybe for Halo 4.
4588977	4592658	Oh wait, I guess there can't be a Halo 4, can there?
4592698	4593398	They'll find a way.
4595099	4596680	It's just the end of the story arc.
4597000	4598520	They never said it was the end of Halo.
4599061	4602442	But doesn't the box advertise the end of Halo?
4602702	4603222	Halo Wars.
4603242	4603742	There'll be more.
4604142	4606023	There'll be another game to get excited about later.
4606844	4610565	Now they did throw out these stress balls that were oranges.
4612811	4614572	and they were actually throwing them at people.
4616314	4617795	Did you save one for us, Bobby?
4618535	4622038	They didn't pelt them at me.
4622058	4622738	I'm so sorry.
4625080	4627962	We'll just put that on the list of reasons to start a fight with you, that's all.
4628683	4629163	There you go.
4629843	4637369	People were walking out of there with big Halo clicks, the big huge Spartan stuff because they were the WizKids stuff and
4637845	4643909	and people were walking out of there with hundreds of dollars worth of stuff and I'm like, you guys realize this is just for a DVD?
4645490	4649872	Did you see people dropping like $800 like the guy Brad said he saw that bought the Xbox?
4649972	4651733	Oh my gosh.
4652534	4657917	We did see somebody walk out with like the big huge Halo action clicks figuring it was a couple hundred and
4658633	4663295	The Legendary Edition, and then I did see one Xbox 360 sold along with that stuff.
4663335	4665216	So yeah, I can fully believe.
4665596	4667697	Was that people just caught up in the moment, you think?
4667797	4670558	Or do you think there's just people that are that hardcore for their Halo?
4672079	4678282	I think it'd be people that are that hardcore, or to buy the 360, it might be somebody who never got a 360 until Halo came out.
4678817	4681779	Yeah, like that would make sense because, you know, I got the Halo Xbox.
4682339	4687262	The original Xbox is a Halo one because I didn't buy it until Halo was out.
4687402	4691084	And, you know, it had been out a little while and they did those special green Xboxes.
4691404	4692825	And I was like, oh, I have to get one of those.
4693345	4696307	So, yeah, I guess that was it.
4696327	4698468	I didn't wait a no midnight line for it either, though.
4699349	4705312	And you don't you didn't need to wait in the midnight line because, like, as I've been telling some people, the Fry's Electronics near me.
4705902	4706903	We walked in yesterday.
4706943	4708845	There are ten Legendary Editions sitting on the shelf.
4709205	4713028	Yeah, I went to Fry's too, and they just had tons and tons of Halo 3.
4713509	4716011	And I didn't even get the Limited Edition.
4716051	4717893	I'm not that into Halo.
4718013	4718974	I just got the regular game.
4719074	4726640	Yeah, they only gave us the regular game, so I don't have any of the cutscene discs or anything else that came with it.
4727501	4733006	Well, Loki had the other one early, because he's sly like that.
4733647	4734148	Good times.
4734488	4738131	Which reminds me, I still need to load the bonus stuff that you have on your one disc, Loki.
4738391	4739212	Don't let me forget.
4739912	4740192	Anyhow.
4740553	4742314	Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners, Bobby?
4742394	4743535	I'm glad to hear you had a good time.
4744436	4745557	Yeah, no, that's it.
4745597	4756225	You just wanted to talk about the Halo 3 launch, but really, that guy, when he touched the bar and we just really all got pissed off at him and stuff, that just, they didn't kick him out.
4756406	4759168	Okay, I had to hang up on Bobby because I didn't want to hear about DDR drama.
4762182	4764123	and there is no bar raping in Halo, come on.
4764783	4766124	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
4767985	4769906	Hey guys, it's SSJ100 Matt.
4769966	4772267	Well, hello SSJ100 Matt, what's on your mind?
4773468	4775269	I'm exhausted from digital life.
4776990	4781332	Dare I ask about... I don't know, there's no drama on this call.
4781532	4784433	Even though I judged... Praise you, you're a great man.
4785174	4786374	Even though what?
4786755	4791097	Even though I was helping the judge on the elephant in the room.
4794304	4801506	Okay, well, tell us about Digital Life, like what else you saw there and some of the other stuff, because I have yet to hear what else there was at Digital Life besides DDR.
4802846	4805466	Well, for the most part, this is my first time going.
4806426	4812467	From what I understand, it was a lot smaller than last year, but gaming-wise, I had a really good time.
4815068	4818068	They've premiered a lot of games that haven't been out yet.
4819769	4820909	Mostly PC stuff.
4821883	4829845	I got to play World of Conflict, World in Conflict I should say, which I thought was pretty good.
4830285	4834906	I wanted to try to get on Hellgate London, but the line was too long for that.
4837606	4844228	And the biggest surprise I would say, and Loki's going to hate me for this, was the Eye of Judgment.
4845988	4846368	Really?
4846528	4849589	Is this a positive review of the Eye of Judgment?
4849609	4850289	You thought it was cool?
4851129	4856471	Yes, yeah, I don't have a PS3 yet, but you know, I would seriously consider it.
4857031	4861593	This is not the first person that's called in to say the Eye of Judgment is better than you think.
4862253	4866275	Actually, I was hearing some good reviews from the Game Crazy managers when they got back from conference.
4866415	4867935	What the crap is going on?
4867975	4873398	That you don't have to photocopy or buy any booster packs or anything, that it comes with all of the cards available for the game.
4873618	4877019	But Jamie, seriously, you did see the same thing we saw at E3 last year, right?
4878101	4879062	with the eye of judgment.
4879182	4880103	I didn't go to the game.
4880183	4884707	It doesn't come with all the cards because that's why they sell booster packs and assorted decks.
4885188	4889551	That's what they were saying at the Game Crazy Managers Conference that's coming with them all intact.
4890012	4890813	I bet you it's not.
4891874	4892654	That's from the vendor.
4892674	4893255	I'm misinformed.
4893895	4894656	That's from the vendor.
4894676	4894976	Hold on.
4894996	4895577	Let's go back to the caller.
4895597	4895977	What caller?
4897339	4903304	From what I understand, from what I was told, actually Wizards of the Coast is handling the game packs, I believe.
4904082	4908204	Well, I actually should because they were the one hosting the event.
4908224	4913928	But anyways, they're going to be giving out 150 cards when you buy the game.
4914988	4916529	At least that's what they say.
4916689	4917950	Well, maybe that was what it was.
4918070	4920992	Yeah, because they figured out probably that everyone's going to pirate them anyway.
4922813	4926435	Well, actually, you know, I'm going to be sending you guys a couple gifts.
4926835	4929997	And one of the gifts is actually a couple cards from the game.
4930497	4932398	So you guys will get to check that out.
4932799	4933380	Awesome!
4933420	4935381	I'm actually thinking about getting the game, honestly.
4937223	4938164	Go right ahead.
4938184	4939605	It's not going to sell millions.
4939745	4943689	I think this turnaround is hilarious in my own mind.
4944109	4950014	Just from what I was hearing from the feedback from the managers conference, I was like, well, I'll give it a try.
4951135	4951536	So maybe.
4952596	4956019	Alright.
4956060	4958502	What else in digital life would you think was cool?
4959723	4959823	Um...
4962405	4966128	You know, they touched on it before, but I really like Guitar Hero 3.
4966768	4967068	Okay.
4968750	4974333	It was kind of hard to hear any of the songs, because, you know, the whole convention itself was loud as hell.
4974493	4982539	But it just reminds me, it just seems like a better version of 1 and 2.
4984660	4989904	And someone said it seems like modifiers, but there are involved, but I don't know how true that is.
4991085	4991325	But...
4992259	4994480	So it didn't just feel like Guitar Hero 2 with new songs?
4995640	5002322	No, it didn't seem like a copy-and-paste, like, 80s style or whatever, 80s mix.
5002902	5006503	Well, which basically was a copy-and-paste job, but that's a whole other story.
5007363	5011444	All right, so if you had to judge digital life on a scale of 1 to 10, what would you give it?
5013765	5018246	Well, considering this was my first one, I'd have to give it, like, 7 out of 10.
5018926	5020587	All right, that's not bad, not bad.
5021588	5029253	Yeah, I'll be sending you guys out a couple of stuff, including some viewers I got from the elephant in the closet.
5029513	5032735	The game we can't speak of tonight.
5034115	5037337	We're going to give it the JT treatment, I guess.
5037877	5038378	That's all right.
5038458	5042700	No, we do love DDR, which is why it pains us so much to hear about all this drama.
5042840	5043741	Can't we all just get along?
5043781	5045102	You people are playing a dancing game.
5045122	5046102	Don't take it that seriously.
5046983	5047243	All right.
5048194	5055457	Well, SJ100, Matt, we gotta let you go, but thank you so much for calling in and giving us a drama-free report from Digital Life.
5055477	5056018	We appreciate it.
5056298	5056858	Don't mention it.
5056998	5057718	Alright, take care, buddy.
5058519	5059139	Yep, take care.
5060840	5061220	I love this.
5061280	5063161	Mystic Gohan in chat sums this up perfectly.
5063721	5064942	After this, who knows?
5065282	5067063	Africa could be Loki's favorite game ever.
5068623	5070184	Only if I get to run over the animals.
5071257	5072018	DarkSakura, I like beer.
5100334	5107040	My final thought is I need like another air conditioning vent in here because it's getting too hot.
5107380	5107660	Loki.
5109041	5113065	My final thought is Asshole Mario is hilarious.
5113425	5113905	Hilarious.
5114005	5115647	It's like you can't stop watching it.
5116167	5116608	I can't.
5116968	5123153	We'll see you back here next week, boys and girls, for Orange Lounge Radio episode number 250, if you can believe it.
5123173	5129158	I'm telling you, you know, I know how G4 is desperate for television to play all these back to back.
5129431	5129871	There you go.
5129891	5130872	There's a good hour block.
5130892	5131653	Isn't it a three-day weekend?
5131953	5132193	What?
5133454	5134135	Next weekend.
5134435	5135556	Is next weekend a three-day weekend?
5135576	5136096	I don't think so.
5136476	5137257	I don't know.
5137337	5138538	Unless you get Columbus Day off.
5138598	5139439	I get Columbus Day.
5139479	5139859	That's why.
5140179	5142301	Because I work for... I think it's Columbus Day.
5142321	5143582	Because I get banking holidays.
5143602	5144503	Well, lucky you.
5145183	5145443	Not me.
5145523	5149987	I'm going to get... I'm going to bring some Metoxa and drink it on the show.
5150267	5150747	All right.
5150887	5152328	Stay tuned and see how that goes.
5152389	5152849	We'll be back.
