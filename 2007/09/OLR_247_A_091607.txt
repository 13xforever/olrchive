Tonight, September 16th, 2007, some cult games from the last generation are coming to Xbox 360.
A retro CD-based system is coming soon to Wii's Virtual Console.
And do M-rated games sell better than other games?
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
My name is Rob Roberts.
You might know me as Sky.
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
What?
How are you, DarkSakura?
I'm sorry to inconvenience you with our little program tonight.
I was busy.
Busy doing what, might I ask?
Petting my ferret.
Petting your ferret?
Is that a euphemism for something?
Maybe I shouldn't ask.
Say hello to the Tech Master, Loki!
Hello.
How are you doing, Loki?
I'm doing fine.
I'm glad to hear it.
Just fine?
Well, I'm trying to get... I have a custom firmware on my PSP Slim, and I'm trying to get it to run ISOs, but I think that there's been some changes versus what I was running before, so... Gotcha.
Well, happy birthday.
A little late, by the way.
Thank you.
Mr. Loki.
Mr. Loki.
and I hope you had a good one.
But I'm sure you'll tell us all about your little birthday gathering last night in a minute during How Was Your Gaming Week.
But yeah, we're going to start off with How Was Your Gaming Week.
I want to introduce the chat room though.
Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
If you're listening to us live here on this Sunday evening, you can join our chat room.
Just head on over there.
And of course, if you aren't listening live, just join us sometime.
We tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
on our live 365 feed, and now we have a webcam on Operator11.com, although I don't know, the webcam feed's not that exciting.
You just kind of like see my face looking at the camera and Loki's back because of the way the room's set up.
But I'm hoping when we finally move the show out into the bigger room, we'll have more stuff to look at.
So this is all warm-up.
This is all the pre.
This is the foreplay.
That's exactly right.
This is the foreplay with the camera.
Thank you.
DarkSakura, always the witty one.
Alright, how was your gaming week?
Since we don't have guests here tonight to introduce, after last week's cluster fuck of people, it's an empty house tonight.
We're just feeling the love, the three of us.
DarkSakura.
I didn't play anything.
Nothing?
Except World Cup Soccer.
Oh, and we had Uno going on in my house, because Dan's buddy Will has decided that he loves Uno now, and has been doing what he calls ultimate dickery games.
What Pray Tell is an ultimate dickery game.
Well, actually I've been calling it that.
He's just calling it being an asshole.
As in doing all the make you draw until you get the card and doing extra draws for challenges and things like that.
And then he's doing challenges all the time.
So he's just being a complete asshole and he's doing it on purpose.
So like setting it to like the maximum cards you can possibly draw and all that stuff?
Yeah.
I see.
And I think, I don't know if he's doing it under Dan's gamertag though.
I think he's doing it under his own.
Or yours.
Yeah.
DarkSakura again, you love that World Cup Soccer Because it's the best pinball machine ever
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Uh-oh.
Dear PlayNC, please work on the weekends, not love me.
P.S.
Crap.
All right, well, then we'll go to Loki.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
It was good.
I took two days off this week to play games.
Unfortunately, during those two days, I really only played Bioshock.
I did finish it, though, so that's good.
And unfortunately, I forgot to do a few things.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's a pretty cool twist and you don't realize it throughout most of the game.
I guess you kind of pick up on it a little bit as you go through.
But it's also good to note that those audio diaries kind of tell more of the backstory.
They're not just there for achievements and stuff.
Definitely check those out while you're playing the game.
And then other things, like I mentioned, I bought a PSP Slim.
It is very light, and of course the first thing I do to it, I hacked it and tried to put a custom firmware on it.
Now I have three PSPs for some reason.
and I just bought the cables for a video out today so I haven't tried that yet.
What is going to be pretty cool though is when I do get the homebrew on there because I'll be able to hook it up to my TV and play around with that and play Nintendo games on my TV I guess.
Though I can do that with like five other systems.
I don't know.
And then I've been trying to get my PS2 back from my sister so I can play the beta that got leaked out for Manhunt 2 because that's supposed to be good.
Other things I played during the week, more Call of Duty 4 beta, I still suck at it, but it's going to be great, can't wait for the game to come out.
Of course, more Saints Row multiplayer at work, and they're kind of getting frustrated with me because I keep winning a lot, and buy a lot.
So, sorry, it just... And you're so humble too.
Well, I don't play it that much, I only play it at work, and so everyone thinks I'm practicing or something, I really don't, and...
It's not like I'm that good or anything.
I don't know.
And then I'm trying to think what else.
I played some Xbox Live Arcade games.
I played a little bit more Worms, and that's just kind of, I don't know.
I don't even know if I want to play that to get achievement points, but yeah, I think that's pretty much it.
Yeah, Worms was better like 10 years ago.
Exactly.
I love Worms Armageddon.
That was like the ultimate for me, and then it just kind of, they haven't done anything with it since.
Worms Armageddon other than make it worse.
So that's about it so far.
I got the Ratchet and Clank demo but I didn't get to play it yet for PS3.
You will be playing that soon.
Yes.
Well, my gaming week, I've of course been playing more Final Fantasy XI, and it's pretty awesome because Shane, before he left town, he actually got me a clock for Final Fantasy XI, which is actually pretty hilarious.
It's a little Vanadil clock.
It actually shows you what time it is in Vanadil along with the Earth time, and it sets these little alarms that you can set on it.
It's so funny.
This is like for the totally hardcore gamer.
But when the timers run out, this is the best part.
It plays like little music box music.
Hold on, let me see if I can get one to play.
Final Fantasy XI in a Window
So instead of sitting there looking for a party doing absolutely nothing, I can actually sit there and surf the internet while I wait and look for a party.
It's the best thing ever.
Now, Windoward does have some cheats built in, but I don't use them because that's how people get caught.
And I don't want to cheat.
I think cheating in MMOs is screwed up.
But I don't see too much of the harm between flipping between different windows.
I mean, I used to have my laptop over here and doing that.
World of Warcraft, you can.
Guild Wars, you can.
Yeah, so I don't think it's a big deal about that.
So there you have it.
Let's see.
Uh-oh.
Is our feed dropping?
No?
It said it was lagging.
It said it was lagging?
All right, our chatroom's saying the feed's screwing up.
If the feed keeps screwing up too bad, I guess we'll have to kill Operator 11.
I hope we don't have to do that.
We'll see.
But I'm looking in the chatroom here.
And I'm looking at what the chat was saying.
They played their gaming week.
We have a lot of, like, threes in the gaming week.
Like, I see a lot of Metroid Prime 3s people have been playing.
Nintendo Maniac 64 says Metroid Prime 3.
HitStun says Quake 3.
RawSteelUT says Persona 3.
And then SonOfDad has been watching The Office Season 3.
There you go.
Huh.
and then also I've been playing on the DS Planet Puzzle League because Planet Puzzle League is all kinds of awesome and trying to get more people on my friends list though so I'll be posting my code in our little thread we have there on the forums over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com trying to get more friends for Planet Puzzle League that I can play against.
I bought that
A pink DS Lite for Nelly.
So now she has her own gaming system to play with.
Without having to bling it out?
Yeah.
And I just got her today.
I got her a pink case to go with it.
She's all pinked out.
So before we get into housekeeping and gaming news tonight, let's talk about your birthday gathering, Loki.
You didn't mention anything about our little trip this week.
Oh yeah, we went to... The real life game we played this week.
Yeah, we went to Stars in Vacaville, which is this bowling alley slash entertainment center.
It's got Cusar laser tag in there, which I think is the best laser tag game ever.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
They claim that their computer system is broken so that they can't change the game settings, which is bullshit because they said the same thing last time and I yelled at them and they finally did it.
And then also the people that work there are complete morons.
In fact, they didn't really give a shit about anything.
I mean, the second game, for example, we beat the other team by 800 points.
That game was awesome.
It was just the worst game.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
He had a pack that said that he only fired five shots and hit 59 people.
His hit ratio is 100%.
That's like ultimate bounce.
And he never got hit, which is complete bullshit.
He fired a lot more than five shots.
It's just the game was so fucked up and they really don't care.
So why don't you open your own?
Because it costs a lot of money to do that.
Can you get a loan?
Not that kind of a loan right now, because I don't have property or any sort of collateral to go with it.
I mean, a car, but it's going to cost at least half a million dollars to open one of those places.
I'd love to do it, because it's not that fucking hard.
I mean, shit, if they can run a laser tag place there, and it may be poorly run, but they have just two people doing it, it can be done.
Not to mention, other than Lasertag, we were just getting, like, drinks in between games and stuff, and the fucker, and they have this, like, little cafe or something that you can buy food at, and they had one person working there, pretty much, at the counter, and I guess running food also, so it took us ten minutes to get a fucking soda, because you kept, you know, helping other people, and, you know, people, I guess you fucked up orders and stuff like that, so it was just really horrible, and none of the equipment at the Lasertag place was even, you know,
Looked like it had been repaired in years.
It's just really fallen apart.
So, fuck them.
We will not be coming back.
I want to point out, last night was the first time I've seen a DDR machine in a long time, too.
But the thing I thought was interesting is I kind of assumed that DDR was kind of dead.
And I know this might piss a lot of people off.
Obviously, our show started a long time ago about DDR.
We all met playing Dance Dance Revolution and everything, so I know it's kind of funny I'm saying this now.
But I kind of thought most people played Dance Dance Revolution at home now, because that's where all the new stuff comes out, is home.
And there's been some pretty decent mixes we've gotten.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Some kid was doing Max 300.
It's like you're not cool unless you can do Max 300 these days.
Well, he worked there, too.
He was the one that marshaled their second game.
Oh, wow.
I wouldn't even call it marshalling.
For example, I was arguing with him because he's like, yeah, those two packs in the back work.
I'm like, no, we played those packs last game.
They're fucking broken.
Oh, Lord.
And the laser doesn't shoot straight.
He's like, well, you mean the laser?
I'm like, no, the emitter does not shoot straight.
Oh, well, they're still working.
I'm like, no, they're not, you fucking retard.
I just hate talking to them.
Especially when they're saying that their system's working.
I'm like, do I need to come back there and set up my own damn game?
Because I know how to do it.
Interesting.
I just thought it was interesting that there's still that whole little community for DDR.
But that's cool.
I'm really glad.
Even though I kind of thought it was dead.
Just because there hasn't been a whole lot of new stuff.
I mean, Supernova didn't bring a whole lot of new stuff to the table besides new songs.
So I was just kind of surprised.
That's all.
So call me a cynic, whatever.
We need Supernova too.
Shut up.
All right.
Anyhow, let's see.
Let's get into some housekeeping for tonight, of which we don't really have much.
There's not a whole lot to say.
I will plug our MySpace and LiveJournal communities and ways you can interact with us online.
Of course, there's our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com, or we have a MySpace as well.
You should add us, and we'll be your friend on MySpace.
Sometimes we post little things up there, a little special, especially like bonus shows and weird things we tape other places.
For instance, we taped a show at an anime con earlier this year that you could only get in our communities.
So it's MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
You can add us there, or you can add us on LiveJournal.
Our community on LiveJournal is also Orange Lounge Radio.
So there you go.
Actually, no, I think we're Orange Lounge on LiveJournal.
I can't remember.
I think that I don't remember.
I think I don't remember.
I don't remember either.
I think we're just Orange Lounge on LiveJournal.
I'm trying to look right now.
This is great radio, I know.
This is the best radio ever, Rob.
I'm really excited to be a part of this.
It's just completely amazing.
Next time before I... Yeah, we're just Orange Lounge on LiveJournal.
There you go.
Let's see.
Ryoma says Wii Online laser tag.
Dude.
Would that be awesome?
An online laser tag with a Wii?
I don't know.
You know what would have been awesome is Metroid Prime 3 online, but that's just me.
Yeah, that'd be awesome.
There was some actual online content with the Wii.
Let's get into some gaming news since we've given the communities ample plugging.
Yes.
Big news coming up.
Just before Tokyo Game Show here, including some big announcements, including the inclusion of Rez Ikaruga Exit and more on Xbox Live Arcade, which is really awesome.
This news makes me so happy.
Rez.
Rez.
Rez.
Rez.
They need to do a new trans-vibrator thing.
I doubt it.
No.
Microsoft had their pre-show conference.
Tetsuya Mizuguchi, of course, they're confirming that both...
and his, I guess, remake of Rez, Rez HD, which is pretty much just Rez in high definition, yay.
And then, of course, Ikaruga, Exit, which has appeared on the PSP, and, of course, some that have already been announced already, Every Extend, Extra Extreme, and, of course, Omega 5.
Also known as E!
Sorry, I'm going to my happy place right now.
And Trigger Heart, Alexia.
You know what, though?
Have I mentioned I love titsy music?
You know what would make me happier with all of that?
If they're giving us Ikaruga, why can't they give us another release of Radiant Silvergun?
Wrong twice now.
Anyways, lots of awesome games coming to Xbox Live Arcade, so... Yay!
I'm excited.
I'll definitely be buying Rez.
Jamie, explain for our listeners what makes Rez so awesome.
Thump, thump, thump.
I can't explain what makes Rez so great, but it's totally just one of those trippy things.
It's like playing Vib Ribbon.
It reminds me of those old trance music videos that you used to see on MTV's Amp, like really late at night.
You remember that show Amp, back when MTV actually played videos?
It would come on like 12 or 1 in the morning.
It reminded me of that show, except you were playing it.
And the cool thing about Rez is that, like, as you're, you know, flying around shooting things, the little, like, lasers and stuff are all in time with the music.
I can't explain it, but it's just, it's like seriously one of those games you just zone out to.
Vibramin.
I can't think of any better way to explain it.
Vibramin's kind of like that, but not to the extent that Rez is.
You don't zone out on it, but Vibramin is definitely trippy enough that you have to blink again when you move your eyes away from the screen.
There you go.
TigerClaw in our chat room at chat.orangelearnsradio.com says, I guess Rez is the kind of game you play if you want to create your own personal rave.
Sort of.
Sort of.
There you go.
Fucking awesome at a rave, I think.
Can you imagine playing that just at a rave?
Huge, you know, giant screen.
That might be a way to kind of do it.
People tripping out and stuff.
That'd be awesome.
All right.
So I'm very, very happy about this news.
It definitely takes me to my happy place.
Exit, I haven't really checked out before, so I'm kind of interested in it.
Well, I never played it, but a lot of people love it, so it's one of those kind of niche things.
But just like Ikaruga was one of those niche games.
By chance, did they say when this... Ikaruga was awesome.
Did they say when this all was coming out?
I know some of that list, like the Omega 5 was supposed to be due out in November, so...
and soon, I know, was Every Extend Extra Extreme is supposed to be coming out this year as well, I think.
Nice.
I actually, I liked Every Extend Extra on the PSP.
That's another one of those just like totally chill out games.
I need to borrow that from you.
You want to?
I'll go get it.
Okay.
This is an awesome game for PSP, so.
Elite Beat Agents Elite Beat Agents Elite Beat Agents Elite Beat Agents Elite Beat Agents
Now, that doesn't mean it's Elite Beat Agents 360.
Like, you know, that would be really hard, because there's no touchscreen on the 360.
But it's just kind of cool that the development team is developing something for another system.
They're not just going to keep games on the DS, so they are making something on the Xbox 360.
It should be said that some of the other games that this company has made, Guitaruman was another game that they made.
So, maybe Guitaruman 360?
That'd be kind of rad.
Well, it was really just more like a Guitaruman remix on PSP.
Unjamalami 360 Guitar Hero Controller
V for 5 Hours
Like playing V for five hours?
Well, that's just, you know, going to the arcade when DDR Extreme first came out, but that's a whole other story.
So, anyway.
Well, I'm excited to see what the team comes up with for the 360.
Well, this puts me in my happy place.
I love Ninja Gaiden, and we're getting a Ninja Gaiden 2, and you can kill a lot of people as Ryu, who's, like, majorly cool and awesome with... Except the only thing is that he doesn't have the cool-looking scarf, but otherwise.
But Itadaki is...
basically saying, here we go, Ninja Gaiden 2 on Xbox 360, so that makes me happy.
And it's uber violent.
Lots of blood flying everywhere.
Yeah, I love violence and blood.
Like, I like this picture of him totally cutting off this guy's head, and it's like, it's not just blood, it's like this glorious fountain of crimson floating toward the air and covering everything in, you know, its glory.
I think that's beautiful.
It's gonna be pretty awesome.
Something that's
Sort of awesome, I guess.
Viva Pinata.
It's a game, of course.
It came out last year.
Some people liked it.
I didn't.
But someone decided that they love Viva Pinata so much that they proposed to their spouse on it.
And so, yes, it's, I don't know, cheesy.
Very, very cheesy.
I'd have to say no.
But, I mean, why would you use Viva Pinata, like,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Do not do it over a game.
It's really cheesy and stupid.
Why not?
Jamie got proposed to over UHF.
Well, it was not necessarily as much of a proposal as much of a... We should just get married, okay?
When?
Sometime?
And, you know, seven years later.
It's just, it is pretty cheesy, though.
I mean... It's no cheesier than the people who go to a basketball game and have it go out over the big screen.
That's pretty cheesy, too.
I'd be like, don't embarrass me into marrying you shit.
I'm kind of curious what other type of video game-related proposals have happened.
I'm kind of looking in our chat room.
I'm not seeing a whole lot of stuff there.
But what I thought was very interesting about this story is that a lot of sites really ran this, although this is really someone's personal business, but some guy just got kind of creative.
I'm surprised that we never saw an Animal Crossing wedding proposal.
Maybe there was, and I just forgot about it.
But, you know.
Final Fantasy XI Ceremony
Like Ragnarok weddings, remember Ragnarok?
Oh, another nerdy, my god.
It was actually in the game too, so hey.
Need to unplug, seriously.
And of course, especially with Final Fantasy XI, of course you can do it, and then they'll just milk you for any sort of in-game money for it.
Comments from chat.
Lots of comments from chat here.
Chat.OrangeLunchRadio.com if you want to comment live on this Sunday night.
Escapist says, on one hand, it's sort of touching.
On the other, dot, dot, dot.
NoChillyNoPity says, I'm going to propose using an automated Super Mario World level.
Oh my God, those are great.
Jamie, I made this in your honor.
Will you marry me?
No.
That's a little interesting.
Well, you're gonna be like 65 feet away.
Come on.
The least you could do is actually go up to them and say, will you marry me?
Instead of just like, look, I drew it into a picture.
It says, will you marry me?
Oh, how cute.
No, just do it.
It's like, okay, you know.
I hate to even quote, like, Kelly, but you don't text message break up, okay?
You don't text, you don't, you don't fucking PictoChat, you know, engage.
Oh my god, Loki, you're such a betch.
I'm gonna betch slap you, deckhead.
I can't believe Loki quoted Kelly.
It's just, it's stupid, it really is.
If you think it's cute...
Okay, great, it's cute, but you know, anyone that doesn't play the game, like your parents, relatives, they're going to be going, what?
What if you sent a text message over PictoChat that said something like, you know, open the book on the table, and then the book has a ring in it, and then you're on one knee, would that be cute?
That would be cute, but okay, just doing it in Animal Crossing is kind of lame.
GS68 said the best thing ever.
What?
Will you be my 2P?
What's that?
Where?
Second player.
Will you be my 2P?
I get it.
That's cute.
There's some great comments in chat tonight.
You guys are funny.
Escapist says, better Picto chat than Ping Pals.
If I got proposed to in Ping Pals, I'd say no.
I'd say you couldn't find something better?
No.
Get out.
In fact, get out of my house.
Let's see.
I like FootyMonster's comment too.
If I ever proposed to my girl on a game, she'd never see it.
Wow.
Wow.
That's kind of like Loki in proposing to Nelly.
How did you propose to Nelly?
I can't remember.
It wasn't over PictoChat.
That's for sure.
It sure as hell wasn't over Viva Pinata.
Is it private?
Or what?
Can you share?
No, we were talking about getting married for a while, so we didn't really have a proposal or anything, but I sure as hell didn't do it over Viva Pinata or anything.
Did you get on one knee and everything?
Actually, no, I didn't.
Oh my god, you bastard.
It doesn't matter.
We were going to do it anyways.
No, it's fine.
The wedding was really nice, if nothing else.
Even if you have no good proposal story.
Even if you took my camera in the bathroom.
Do we have to get into those discussions?
You know, that was a very M-rated experience.
And you know what they say about M-rated games?
Let's buy them!
That's right.
Let's get them.
This M-rated game is $300.
M-rated games have higher scores and better sales.
That is to be if a recent study by the Electronic Entertainment Design and Research Firm is to be believed.
They actually were evaluating some games that were rated mature by the ESRB.
Even though mature-rated games are only about 10% of what's out there on what the ESRB rates, apparently these titles, quote, have both the highest average Metacritic scores and the highest average gross sales in the United States.
So apparently having a mature-rated game is actually a ticket to better sales.
Who knows?
What do you guys think?
Is this story surprising?
I actually think this is a little surprising.
I don't think it has anything to do with the fact that it's rated M or anything.
I just think a lot of the games that come out that are really good, that are your big blockbuster games, are rated M. I mean, let's look at the last few things that have come out.
Bioshock was rated M. Stranglehold was rated M. Heavenly Sword, no, that's Teen...
Halo's rated M might make it a little bit better but not much
so anyway if you want to visit the Electronic Entertainment Design and Research it's EEDAR.com and they have a whole little press release about it on their site so check it out and hopefully this will bode well for the upcoming release of Manhunt 2 but we'll see so that's all I have to say on the M-rated games I'm actually looking to see if there's anything in chat here Ryoma seems to agree because mature rated games include Metal Gear Solid, Halo, and GTA
um let's see uh no chili no pity says that's weird comedy films potentially make a lot more rated as pg-13 versus r kind of an interesting uh comparison there but ross deal ut says well that's in theaters what about dvd hmm interesting
Well, in other news, speaking of news since you brought up movies, Activision has a demo out for Spider-Man Friend or Foe on Xbox Live.
It's 432 megabytes, and what you do is you either play as Spider-Man or you are in a co-op mode with either the Green Goblin or Venom, and you can
In the demo, you fight Dr. Octopus, which is kind of cool.
It's going to be on PS2, 360, and Wii, put out by Next Level Games.
They also gave us Mario Strikers.
Mario Strikers Charged, I'm sorry.
And there's a PC version, I think, too.
I was also going to say, there's some other stuff that's come out on live.
They had...
Tony Hawk's Proving Grounds Tony Hawk's Proving Grounds
Usually Tony Hawk games are pretty fun.
Definitely play Flat Out Ultimate Carnage.
I cannot stress that enough.
That game is so awesome.
Time Shift might be okay.
I don't know.
I played, like, an old-ass demo for it.
I mean, back when it was owned by Atari.
And it was okay then.
I don't know if I'd buy that game, though, or not.
I would say... Let's see.
On PlayStation 3, I know Ratchet & Clank's...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
SSJ100Matt says, I hear the new FlatOut is getting closer and closer to a Burnout clone.
I think we talked about this a little bit last week.
The box art certainly is, but the game itself, Loki?
Burnout's going in a completely different direction, so I guess you can compare it to some of the older Burnouts, but the new Burnout game's nothing like it.
Isn't the new Burnout game more like Test Drive, where it's like an open world?
Sort of.
It's just really open... I don't even know how to really describe it.
It's just kind of like an open world where you're driving around...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
As I mentioned, there's a demo out for Juice 2 Hot Import Nights coming out on PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 this week, as well as PlayStation 3 is coming out the week after, because you know all those PlayStation 3 delays.
And then on PlayStation 2, if you happen to love karaoke, well, there's quite a bit of it this week.
SingStar 80s is coming out both the game by itself and a game bundled with microphones, as well as SingStar Amped.
And both
And let's see.
Also on PlayStation 2 and 360, we have Warriors Orochi, which is a very unique game by Koei that combines Samurai Warriors with Dynasty Warriors.
So if you love the Dynasty Warriors games, it's yet another one.
On PSP, Coated Arms Contagion, finally coming out, as well as Yu-Gi-Oh!
GX.
I thought that game got canceled.
No, that was the PlayStation 3 one.
Oh.
Yu-Gi-Oh!
GX, Tag Force 2, also coming out on PSP.
Let's see, on 360, or I'm sorry, PS3 this week, Stuntman Ignition, finally coming out.
And then also on 360, Eternal Sonata, which is going to be pretty big.
Sold.
I'm so getting that game.
What were you telling me about Eternal Sonata before the show started tonight, Jamie?
Well, I know that Chopin killed himself by drinking cholera-infested water because of his lifestyle.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Let's see, on the Wii, My Sims, also coming out on the DS as well.
Cosmic Family, if you have really little kids that like to learn, there you go.
Fishing Master, which is that Hudson-based fishing game, which I didn't think we really saw too much of it, but if you like fishing, it might be cool.
Mercury Meltdown Revolution, it's a cool puzzle game, only $20 for the Wii, so check it out.
Anubis 2, budget game, so maybe.
and then Dewey's Adventure is also coming out on the Wii.
Let's see, DS, my god, there's like way too much stuff this week.
DS, Digimon World Dawn and Dusk, as well as I believe Digimon World is also coming out on Data Squad on PS2.
We've also got, let's see here, Frisbee Disc Bundle, which is Frisbee Disc Golf and Ultimate Frisbee, woohoo!
Nancy Drew is going to be getting a game.
Yay!
Namco Museum.
Actually, I hear the Nancy Drew games are pretty awesome.
I shouldn't just pass it off because it's a Nancy Drew game.
I've actually heard they're pretty awesome.
Namco Museum DS is coming out, and that's kind of interesting, I guess.
On PC, World in Conflict is coming out.
I know that's going to be pretty big.
Then some of these weird games here.
Big Buck Hunter, 30,000 Games.
I love kittens.
I love puppies.
I love puppies too, Loki.
Stranglehold, I guess, is coming out as well.
I think there might be a couple other things on PS2 here.
Let me take a look.
Growlancer 5.
That one's actually supposed to be pretty big.
Some crappy Honda SBK07 Superbike game.
And Syphon Filter Dark Mirror.
And that's it.
Wow.
Lots and lots of stuff coming out this week in the U.S.
And you know, the Japanese launch calendar looks pretty full as well.
Not quite as much as we've got over here, but certainly there's quite a bit of stuff coming out over there.
The Madden 08 Japanese version makes its way to the Xbox 360 this week on September 20, 2007, and it does look like it's localized there for Japan with the text and all that stuff.
But I'm imagining it's still the same teams, because it's still the NFL, so...
There you have it.
Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Sengoku Musou Katana, which I'm imagining is a little bit of a sword fighting game.
I'm trying to look at some of the screenshots, and it kind of reminds me... What's that old Sega arcade game?
They have it like Dave and Buster's.
You can swing the sword around.
What the hell is that game?
I can't remember the name of it.
Oh, I know what you're talking about, too.
It looks like it might be this kind of game.
I don't know.
So, we'll go.
Go with that.
Anyhow, Burnout Dominator is coming out on the PlayStation 2 in Japan, so check that out.
and coming out as well on the PlayStation 2, Kinero no Korda 2 Anchor is coming out.
It's an RPG.
Also coming out on the PlayStation 2.
By the way, I have to correct myself.
Yes?
Because once I thought about it, I realized it wasn't Chopin, it was Tarkovsky.
Oh.
Oh, is it because people did their research on Wikipedia or something?
No, I knew that.
And once I had said it, I was like, no, that wasn't who it was.
I'm sorry, I'm correcting myself.
It's all good.
I'm still looking forward to the game, because it is based on hallucinations, one way or the other.
I like hallucinating.
It's based on the 70s!
It's basically the musical hair in video game form, but not really.
Anyway, back to Japanese releases.
Saint Beast, Rasen no Shou is coming out on the PlayStation 2 as well, an action-based game.
Saint Beast.
Coming out on the Nintendo DS, Del Toro Quest...
Seven Tsun no Hoseki is coming out.
It's another RPG game on the DS.
As well as Elemental Monster, which looks to be a card-based action game.
Not sure what that is, if that's based on anime or what that is.
That's coming out on the DS over there in Japan.
PSP is getting Burnout Dominator on the 20th over in Japan.
And R-Type Tactics comes out.
R-Type!
It's a strategy tactical game based on R-Type on the PSP.
Pretty awesome.
Never mind.
It's not really our type then.
It is our type.
It's our type-ish, I don't know.
No.
But there you have it.
That's what's coming out on the Japanese calendar for September the 20th.
It's only our type if you fly around and shoot stuff.
You do.
In a turn-based strategy fashion.
That's not fun.
So how about some European release dates?
How about it?
For our buddies in the UK, on the 20th, LocoRoco Cocorecho comes out on PlayStation 3.
21st, Drawn to Life and My Sims.
Also, My Sims is coming out on the Wii.
And why is there two listings for My Sims on the Wii?
Anyway.
It also, oh, there's two listings for it on Wii and DS.
And one of them has a space and one doesn't.
I guess that makes it special.
SingStar Rock Ballads on PlayStation 2, Stranglehold on PC, and World in Conflict on PC.
Oh, yeah, and Halo 3 on the 26.
Who cares?
And just in case if anyone's actually thinking about buying my Sims, just so you know, it's not multiplayer.
It's only one player.
Totally lame.
It's poo.
Yeah.
Anywho.
Alright.
One thing that's not quite as lame...
But you can actually get Ratchet & Clank the demo which will be coming out October the 4th and looks pretty awesome.
That will be on PlayStation 3, actually a good PlayStation 3 game coming out for once.
And if you can't wait until October 4th like I did, you can also pre-order your game at GameStop and they have a demo disc for you.
DarkSakura, look at her butt.
It is so big.
Wow.
And now, why are they talking about... Gosh, our chat room is random tonight.
Jvmon says, I want Silent Hill, the Hannah Montana edition.
To which Hippolytus responds, Silent Hill, Hannah Montana would never be as awesome as Silent Hill, Britney Spears.
Go figure.
Although I do think in the next Silent Hill game, Pyramid Head should come out and go, It's Pyramid Head, bitch.
Like the new Britney song?
Forget it.
Anyhow.
More games on the way to the PlayStation 3.
I don't know a whole lot about this game, so hopefully, because I haven't been following PS3 like I should be, like a good amateur game journalist.
But on November 20th on the PlayStation 3, Uncharted, Drake's Fortune, is coming out.
So, Loki, what is so amazing about this game that I should be paying attention to it for?
Well, it's sort of amazing.
It's basically Tomb Raider with a guy.
I've done Tomb Raider.
Is he scantily clad?
He's not scantily clad.
They're comparing it to Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones.
There's a chick in it and he shoots things and it's in a jungle.
Woo!
Go Naughty Dog for original content for the PS3.
That's funny.
Eternal Sonata is coming out on PS3.
It has been confirmed.
and we've already talked about it.
Well, what hasn't been confirmed?
Wait a minute.
We did talk about Eternal Sonata, but we were talking about it on the 360.
So now we're hearing that the game is actually coming out on the PlayStation 3?
Yeah.
As well?
Echo says no.
What?
As I seem to recall, there's been a lot of drama that's played out on the internet this week where, you know, oh yeah, for one, we're not supposed to talk about Namco's release calendar on this show, but they seem to consistently do this, where they put these things out there, whether it be on the ESRB, right?
Wasn't Internal Sonata listed on the ESRB?
Then it was pulled.
Then they put it on their own freaking website, then it was pulled.
It was also put back onto the ESRB list.
And now it's on the ESRB list again.
and it was on their website.
It's almost like Namco's doing this on purpose to keep getting the story bumped up to the top of blogs.
I mean, Eternal Sonata is coming out this week after all.
Hmm.
How about, who cares?
Let me put it this way, it's...
Obviously, it's going to still come out on PS3.
That is, I mean, if you believe it's not, you're an idiot.
And I believe also beautiful Katamari is listed on there for PlayStation 3 and the Wii as well, to be determined.
Which, you know, we didn't tell you that six months ago when the story first hit the internet.
I bet you anything.
We never changed our stance.
Everybody else did.
I bet you anything it's still coming out next spring.
I agree.
It's confirmed in my head.
Not that we, you know, would, you know.
I don't know.
I could see it coming out in spring with like a...
Timed, Exclusive, whatever.
Because it's Katamari, come on.
Of course they're going to put it on the Wii.
It's got tilty shit.
It's gimmicky.
People love gimmicky.
So, you know, it's just like the Wii and PS3.
I'm just curious why Namco's having all these like, Oh, it's coming out.
Oh, no, it's not.
Oh, it's an exclusive.
Oh, no, it's not.
Maybe they should start... And this goes for all game companies.
If you don't want information put out there, you need to really...
Be coordinating with every single department of your company to make sure this information doesn't get out.
Coordinate your marketing people with the web people, with the, I don't know, ratings people.
I mean, seriously, if it's on your website, people are going to go, oh, I think it's actually coming out now because it's actually listed on your website.
And don't say, oh, someone made a mistake.
They weren't supposed to put that up there yet.
and don't talk about it in gag order and everybody better shut up.
We'll sue, we'll sue, we'll sue.
Hey, how much you want to bet that there may be, and this is just pure guessing, Tokyo Game Show is right around the corner.
How much you want to bet there's an announcement of some sorts?
Just like how right before E3 happened a certain no-name website said something and somebody wasn't happy about it?
Possibly.
Maybe.
Anyhow, thank you for that story on Eternal Sonata, Jamie.
In my mind, my head says yes.
It's never wrong.
Anyways, as we alluded to last week, that it was only a matter of time before the impenetrable 3.6 firmware of the PSP was cracked, and guess what?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I want to know why DarkSakura's laughing.
Are you laughing because of Loki's big vocabulary?
Nothing.
Team M33 has cracked it.
There is now a custom version of the firmware out there that allows you to run some homebrew.
The problem is right now they can't get support for the 1.5 kernel, which before was able to run all the homebrew stuff.
So now people are kind of having to go back, retool things.
So some things work, some things don't.
Eventually, though, as things progress and more firmwares come out,
Thanks for watching!
Which is interesting in itself.
And what you do with that is you, I guess they call it extending the Pandora's battery.
You basically put some parts of different firmwares on there and then it works.
So once you've done the Pandora's battery, it's pretty easy.
And they actually have programs out there to make it walk you through step by step what to do.
So it's pretty simple.
But definitely worth checking out.
I'm sure that we're going to see some more stuff coming from that.
Of course, Sony, hearing that, released 3.7 on the PSP, the firmware to break what other people have done on 3.6.
And now they have custom theme support, which I will remind everybody has been available in the homebrew scene for quite a while now.
But you can download official themes, which also, by the way, can be cracked apart and put on custom.
Wait, wait, wait.
I thought there's been themes on the PSP forever.
Well, this is actually like customizing themes.
You can put like a wallpaper in the background and stuff like that.
This is actually changing all the icons, text, etc.
Oh, that's interesting.
Okay, cool.
But you can do this on custom firmwares right now, and it's been available for a long time.
But people have already found ways to crack those theme files apart and
Yeah, just nothing to save.
Other things have been supported, I guess, more where you can assign buttons in remote play, so maybe that gets to allow you to play Lair a little bit easier on the PSP.
I guess sequential playback is now supported under video and simultaneous playback under, I guess, music and photos, so you can play music while viewing your photos.
Other interesting stuff, right after this came out, I guess they had dumped that firmware, and now there's 3.71.
So, it will never end.
Never, ever.
Well, you know, I guess, like, homebrew and, you know, changing little things around is one thing, but when folks can play, you know, pirated games on there, Sony's got to do what they got to do.
Yeah, they got to do what they got to do.
Put the Swift Panhammer down.
They got to do it not very well, either.
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching.
See you next time.
and one of their reporters is actually reporting that yes there have been some changes for instance you might remember an early report where the killer could use a pair of pliers to literally rip the balls off of a hunter well that scene has been taken out
Not on my version.
I was looking forward to that.
Well, that's okay.
Here's the thing, though.
One of the biggest changes that they've done is that Rockstar has made a blur effect to some of the major death blows in the game.
So in the M-rated version, there's like this blur effect that goes on, or the graphics get darkened a little bit, so it's really hard to tell what's going on because it becomes like this kind of like motion blur type thing that doesn't make it so clear.
Well, that's why they made the killing the...
and Crazy88 seen in Kill Bill Black and White in the US.
That's true.
I mean, these types of little censorship things happen.
So, yeah, that's kind of interesting.
But what changing it to black and white made it that much different?
Not seeing the blood as red or something.
I've seen it without it.
Wow.
It's ridiculous is all it is.
That's just like the... It's people who aren't getting laid.
That's just like when they change the blood to sweat.
That will forever be my favorite rating thing that was done.
Look at how much sweat comes out.
Damn.
So there you have it.
Those are some of the big changes that are in the Manhunt 2.
So, you know, I would still say, though, I think this game's going to come out, and I think the adults-only version will still come out on the PC later on.
Okay, but here's some other interesting things, though.
Apparently they're talking about different cutscenes.
In one cutscene, a masked killer uses a power saw to slice a man's bulging belly as the victim lies helpless strapped to a table.
That's okay for M, but oh my god, you know, if they rip off fake balls on a goddamn 3D model of somebody.
Well, I mean, that does kind of make everybody go, you know, that has them collectively go, oh, hey, oh, crush your legs.
The ESRB is so hilarious.
So, well, I don't know.
I have to admit, my interest on this game is kind of, you know, at first it was kind of like, yeah, this might be kind of fun, but now I'm just like, eh.
I don't like those movies like Saw and stuff, so I probably won't like this game.
So I don't think I'm going to buy it.
Unless it gets incredible reviews and there's something about the game I just have to see.
I'm not really in it for the... I'm kind of interested in the Wii murdering of people.
That is interesting, but not... I don't know.
I'll just go to your house and play it, man.
To be very honest,
There's a lot of little Wii games out there that I want to buy right now, and unfortunately that's the next one in line.
It's not necessarily that I want to go around murdering people with the Wii remotes, even though I do find humor in that, but I don't know.
Now, Ross Deal UT in our chatroom says, Manhunt 2, a trash game selling on Controversy Alone.
Sad, sad thing.
And I sort of agree, except I don't want to pass the game off as trash without having actually gotten to play it.
But, you know, I will definitely kind of want to look at the reviews and things.
All right.
This game certainly doesn't stay in the news for its incredible innovations that it's bringing to the gaming scene.
I'll give you that, but look at Hostel.
There's a perfect example.
There's another movie that's probably trash that's selling on Controversy alone.
I won't say that the game won't sell.
I'm just saying I don't care.
I didn't watch Hostel either.
I have an interest in those.
I know, I know.
Like, no, like, it's just weird.
Like, sometimes I will watch the very gory movies, like The Descent was pretty gory, and I loved it, but it was like... There's more suspense, though, isn't there?
Yeah, it was way, like, more, just the way it was directed and everything, it was, oh, it was scary.
That was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, The Descent.
Anyway.
Well, um, for other news, though, regarding Manhunt 2, people were interviewed to see whether or not they would be interested in buying it, and, um...
There were only 18% of the people polled who said they were going to buy it when it launches on Halloween.
52% said no, and 30% said, uh, what?
That many people clicked a button that said, uh, what?
And decided.
Oh, okay.
That's, well, so, so apparently only 18% of the, that's still, I don't know, I mean, 18% to me kind of seems like a large...
chunk of the gaming community.
I mean, if you can sell out of one to every five people that own a Wii this game, that's still quite a lot of copies moved.
So I don't think it's as bad as they're saying.
But I think a good, a better question would be were you planning to buy the adult-only one and now you're not going to anymore?
I'd be kind of curious to see what the result is of that one.
At the end of the day, though, it doesn't really matter to any of the console makers.
It really just fucks over Take-Two again and Rockstar, so...
Oh well.
Stop making such violent games.
No.
But, oh well.
I guess we'll see.
I mean, again, it all really depends on the reviews for me.
Release it on PC, Unrated.
There you go.
We'll see.
We will see.
Anyways.
Oops, it knocked the ferret on the floor.
That's fine.
Good, I hope it died.
No.
No.
If you happen to be a stupid kid trying to buy games at GameStop, well, there might be one particular GameStop in South Dallas that won't be selling you games.
In fact, he's breaking corporate policy and he refuses to sell games to school kids who can't prove that they're doing well in school.
And apparently the manager is Brandon Scott and he's...
Make sure that an adult can verify that the child is getting good grades, otherwise he won't sell them a game.
Any game, ever.
He says, I'm probably going to get in trouble for this, but to me it's worth it because the kids understand that somebody cares.
You know who doesn't care?
Probably GameStop Corporate and you're going to get fired.
Congratulations.
You know, I'm very tempted, like, there's a, you know, the part of me that is very like, you know, aha, people get what they deserve, aha, wants to kind of applaud what this guy is doing, but when I really kind of sit there and think about it, I go like, you know, this is kind of screwed up.
It is screwed up.
I mean, I think it should be up to the parents what the kids get, period.
Now, I don't have a problem with him deciding to do that, if he owned his own game store, but he doesn't, and so he's
I think it's a great idea that you shouldn't sell games to kids that are stupid.
But there's a lot of reasons not to sell games to certain kids.
Hell, I was at a playing trade this week and I was looking at they were doing their grand opening and there was a kid no parents watching him.
Kid couldn't have been like 10, 11 years old playing Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
Just sitting there playing and he's like, I just killed a hooker!
You know, it's like
Come on, people!
And then you're bitching about, oh, I didn't know Billy was playing such a violent game!
Parents are stupid.
Don't let a GameStop-type store babysit your children, then.
What you need to do, though, I mean, I applaud him for making that decision.
I mean, granted, it's probably going to be great for the store, but, you know, wants that off his conscience, great.
Good grades does not equal good behavior.
You know, there are a lot of kids there who weren't necessarily motivated.
They might be good kids, they're just not motivated to get good grades.
This started to happen to me in my senior year of high school.
I remember when I was in school and stuff, and if I would get good grades, my parents would reward me by buying me something, you know?
That was kind of my thing, too, is that my parents did what this guy did.
If I got good grades, I got stuff.
If I didn't get good grades, I got, you know, locked in a cellar.
So...
And silly Bob, you don't have a cellar.
I had to live in the closet under the stairs.
Like Harry Potter.
And really, I mean, the kids, if they can't buy their games from GameStop or whatever, they'll just go somewhere else.
You're not the only fucking game store on the planet, you moron.
I mean, people go to Walmart.
Ranma wants to say, Loki, he was suspended.
Way to go!
That's what you get for doing good things.
DarkTetsuya says, well, the adults should be there to buy the game anyway.
Exactly.
And Frisbee, in their best Maury Povich impression, says, you are not the father.
Get it?
Because the guy is not the father.
GameStop.
I don't even know if that was supposed to be in a Maury Povich impression.
I just felt like saying it in one.
GameStop, you are not the father.
You are not the father.
Escape, it says, I've had eight-year-olds in my stores talking about how awesome Grand Theft Auto was, too.
But I wonder if a lot of that is hype.
Like, you gotta wonder how many of those kids actually played the game.
Like, sometimes, I mean, obviously there's some screwed up kids, like, you know, the one Loki was talking about earlier playing the game.
But you gotta wonder, like, sometimes eight-year-olds are just full of talk.
You know what I mean?
Like, none of them have probably played the game, but they hear their brother talking about it or something like that.
I don't know.
That's poop-tastic.
I don't know.
Who isn't?
I'm doing a Halo 3 presale.
I unfortunately was over at GameStop quite a bit this week, just for different reasons.
Buying systems.
But...
I guess they had a sign on their door that said that the line starts at 9pm the night before for Halo.
What day does Halo come out?
I forget.
25th.
Oh, so it's next Tuesday.
So I cannot wait for it to be over.
I really cannot.
Well, unfortunately what is not clear at this time, don't know if it's going to be, you know, like they're going to turn the whole store into games like GameStop EB, probably not.
I can see that they'll probably have a little corner of the store dedicated to video games.
I mean, why not?
Because they sell a lot of the accessories and things anyway.
And they sell other types of gaming things.
Radio Shack Sells
Those are all kinds of cool.
I got one at a garage sale years ago and I loved it.
I hate RadioShack.
They're so damn expensive when it comes to anything component-wise.
You're buying video cables, audio cables.
You're better off somewhere else.
Seriously.
I go to RadioShack to buy lithium batteries and that's about it.
There's cables.
I have a lot of AV cable needs.
And I bought a microphone there before.
Yeah, microphone.
I think our microphones.
Our old microphones were.
No, yeah, the old ones were.
These are the newer ones from the guitar place, right?
The one I used at my what-to-do pump-up-the-volume-for-the-longest-time was from RadioShack.
Put it this way.
I was going to go to GameStop to buy some stuff for our setup at work for the LAN stuff, like some headsets and...
Audio Cables.
It was going to cost me $80 to buy it there.
I ended up shopping this place that my coworkers recommended, CableWholesale.com.
I would say it was $15 instead of $80.
So just so you know, don't shop there.
So here's my question.
Remember when the Wii launched?
We went out and we gave orange soda to people and cookies and stuff.
What should we do for the Halo 3 launch?
Should we go out on Monday night and do something for the kids in life?
Give them crack.
I don't want to go out on a Monday night.
Loki's like, I'm tired.
Let me sleep.
Fuck this.
It's Halo.
I mean...
I guess you could bring him the game fuel shit.
I really don't want to talk to Halo fans.
What about the journalist in you, Loki?
Doesn't the journalist in you want to go out there and talk to the people?
No, I don't care.
I despise Halo 3 right now.
Just, I don't know, retail standpoint.
That's your personal vendetta.
That is my personal vendetta.
I don't see the point.
All right, well, we'll see.
Yeah, I like the idea of going out and giving them game fuel.
Maybe we'll see about that.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura.com
I mean, we just had here last week having a conversation about Newtopia.
Yeah.
So coming soon, DarkSakura's website of the week will be replaced with DarkSakura's classic game of the week.
That'll be fun.
It'll be ObscureShit.com.
RossDLUT says, Loki only hates Halo 3 because it's popular.
No, I don't hate Halo 3 because it's popular.
I hate it because all my customers are complaining, when am I going to get Halo 3?
And you really need it on 3D because it's going to suck if we don't have it.
When's it coming in?
I hated even when the Wii came out because it was a pain in the ass and we knew we couldn't get them on time and all that stuff.
Halo 3
Everybody wants this damn thing and they're all coming out of the woodwork and all complaining that they need it like five days early and stuff and you're like, yeah, you're not going to be selling it early or anything.
I just, I hate games that are going to be just that popular.
Grand Theft Auto 4, when it comes out, I'm going to hate that too.
Except I love Grand Theft Auto 4, but I am still going to hate the whole selling of Grand Theft Auto 4.
DarkTetsuya in our chatroom thinks that for the next couple weeks, well, before we transition in episode 250 to, you know, changing some things up, thinks that your website of the week should be like Google.com or Yahoo.com.
Actually, if you type in Goggle.com, because I typoed it once, it takes you to porn.
I used to use HotBot as my search engine back in the day.
And you could, you know, totally typo that to HotBot.
Blackle
DarkSakura.com
Escapist says Halo 3 will end with Bob Newhart waking up in bed discovering the whole war was a dream.
JV Mon's jumping up and down saying you win the internet.
That was a pretty great ending.
Okay, I actually have a website.
And I have to blame... I have to blame... Hold on for the mute.
I have to blame JV Mon for this one because it's awful.
It made my heart cry.
This is my website of the week not to go to.
Ever.
Ever.
It's insulting and horrible and you don't want to go there ever.
This is fun.
The anti-website of the week.
The anti-website of the week.
It's captain-jack.de slash 2008 slash cj.html A new Captain Jack.
And it makes my heart hurt.
I want to see a new Captain Jack.
And his girl that's with him is vacant.
Hey, I like the new Captain Jack.
I can deal with this.
Wait, hold on.
I thought this was another Doctor Who thing.
No, this sucks.
Like, THE Captain Jack.
That Captain Jack.
They replaced him?
How dare they?
I know!
Unless that's his son.
If it's his son, I forgive them.
If it's not, I don't forgive them.
How dare they?
No, check this out.
This is awful.
Let me turn up my volume.
Wait, can you give me the website one more time because I'll play it on here so the listeners can hear.
It's captain-jack.de slash 2008 slash cj.html Wait.
captain-jack.de slash captain-jack.de slash 2008, this is great radio, slash cj.html Yes.
Okay, I think I got it.
It hurts my heart.
Alright, here we go.
Site is loading.
Alright, we welcome, we proudly present the one and only Captain Jack.
Screw you!
There will only be one Captain Jack.
Oh lord, this sounds horrible already.
This is bad.
I've got to stop it.
Besides, we don't want to play more.
Captain Jack, you are not.
Wow.
JV Mon says his son came out as Captain Jack Jr.
Interesting.
Is that like James Bond Jr.?
Interesting.
All right.
I like how in his glasses on the website you can totally see the film crew.
Way to go, people.
All right.
I'd like to cordially thank JV Mon for ruining tonight's program.
Thank you, JV Mon.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Should be pretty sweet, actually.
It's more of like a traditional, crazy, tons of bullets, all over the place, shooter game.
So, hopefully it'll be as cool as I think it is.
Hopefully it's cool as you make it out to be.
Well, unfortunately, the link that I had on here was the wrong story, so... Uh-oh.
That's based off memory, so... My bad.
Oh, we linked the wrong story in the show.
Ha-ha, Rob!
My bad.

Based on the movie.
Wii is showing off Knights Journey into Dreams, Ghost Squad, another version of the Golden Compass, Sega Rally on the Xbox 360.
That's it.
But remember, this is, you know, Tokyo Game Show and unfortunately the Xbox 360 is not doing as well over there.
I think that's all they had over on the 360 from Sega.
Other than Golden Compass, I would imagine.
They are showing an expansion for Phantasy Star Universe on the PlayStation 2, though, which makes me wonder.
It must not be coming out on 360, but did the game come out on 360?
It is coming out over here, but I think the expansion will probably be a download, just like...
PICTO IMAGE DS
Another version of the Golden Compass, which by the way will also be on PSP.
And a game that I like.
This is called Dream Cat Smile DS.
Rad.
PSU expansion pack also coming to the PC.
Rad.
And Escapist in chat says, no new Jet Set Radio yet?
My heart is breaking.
I agree.
I agree.
Seaman 2.
Seaman 2?
Yeah.
I don't know so much about that.
You know what?
I wouldn't mind having a Seaman 2 because I thought it was great that the whole thing was narrated by Leonard Nimoy.
So if I can get this right here, DarkSakura, you're saying you want Seaman 2.
I got a ferret thrown at me.
Thank God the webcam's off.
Yeah, this is horrible radio.
Ferret!
No.
When you read the story, I'll give back the ferret.
EA, give me it.
Okay.
Okay.
Anyway, EA is finally entering the world of survival horror by giving us a game called Dead Space.
You get zombies hidden in fun places.
We won't say where they are, but they are somewhere.
And it's supposed to be some zombie game set in outer space, from what I understand.
It's like Event Horizon, I think they said.
Oh, and you have tentacles in it, so that's okay.
Yay, tentacles!
Kids love tentacles!
Tentacle porn?
I need to put that on top of my Netflix queue.
Just download it like everybody else.
Then I'm done.
All right.
