19764	21425	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
21445	24968	This is Part B of our podcast, taped live on September 9th, 2007.
25549	35937	And a lot of you guys have been giving us some feedback in our forums lately on OrangeLoungeRadio.com, in our forums, that you guys want to see Part B of the podcast a little bit sooner than you're seeing it today.
36297	40641	So you will get the Part B of our podcast a little bit sooner.
41121	44284	Very soon, we're going to change the order in which, well, not the order, but the...
44844	46485	So we get Part B first.
46545	50808	Yeah, you're not going to get Part B first, but we'll change the speed in which we get the podcast out to you guys very soon.
51089	55832	We're going to be making some changes with Episode 250, which is coming up very soon, if you can believe it.
56913	57253	Yikes.
57653	58634	It's very, very soon.
59575	59815	All right.
60566	62908	So let's get back into some gaming news, shall we?
63108	63468	All right.
63588	64129	We shall.
65170	69193	So some interesting trademarks were made from Nintendo.
70034	81262	And of course, some things people wondering what they are, including a Wii body controller, which people are thinking is just the balance board or whatever it was called before because it wasn't the final name.
81883	88208	Another one, Wii Handle, which could possibly be either a new controller or possibly something that has to do with, you know,
88683	90564	your online name or something like that.
91444	96966	Nintendo Magic, which unfortunately is going to be a DS game.
97026	98947	It's to teach you how to do magic.
99867	105029	And Mii Audition, which is supposed to be that everybody votes channel for your Miis.
105830	109411	And then that's it.
110691	113452	Also, they renewed the Pikmin trademark.
114033	116354	So maybe we'll see a new Pikmin game for the Wii.
117274	117474	And
118826	119667	Yeah, so that's it.
120688	124931	I thought a Nintendo Magic is what it's going to take for them to do some more online gaming.
124951	127453	Some magic.
127473	131717	No, actually the game already came out in Japan and it's coming out over here in November.
131737	132978	Well, that's cool.
133018	135339	It's like a teaching you magic game.
136120	137201	All right, very cool.
138472	143255	Well, there's actually a lot of third party stuff going on with the Nintendo Wii.
143415	153142	And this, of course, is if you want to listen to what Satoru Iwata, the president of Nintendo, has to say, quote, I believe that third party publishers kind of look at the software titles that are being sold on Nintendo.
153182	155363	They don't want Nintendo to have more than one third.
155763	157184	Otherwise, Nintendo will be too strong.
157224	159766	They want to have two thirds of what's being sold on the platform.
160406	163328	I believe that the job of first-party software is to drive hardware.
163628	167530	If you don't have a quick impact and a quick dissemination amongst the audience, you lose momentum.
167870	170991	If you don't have momentum, the third parties don't want to jump on your platform.
171271	173272	So that's not a good situation to be in.
174113	183898	It's interesting because a lot of people have been paralleling what's going on with the Wii here to the Nintendo DS, where there wasn't a lot of stuff available for the DS when it first came out.
183938	186379	It took a long time for the titles to really start coming in.
187079	188560	And even Satori Wada...
189384	190165	is aware of this.
190245	190445	Quote,
208183	209104	New, Innovative, Original Content
230369	232010	I guess I can agree with both of that.
232330	239593	And Nintendo, I think, needs to open up a bit more of those little things they like to sit on and then announce later when their own stuff comes out.
240293	243515	Need to make things more available to the other developers, I think.
244975	246056	I would certainly agree with that.
246236	252939	So they need to open up the online stuff a little faster and the DS connectivity, you know, even though I guess they kind of did that with Pokemon.
252959	253679	You know, more.
254139	254880	Open that up a little more.
255240	256380	We need more, please.
257521	257761	Well...
258519	267105	Another very interesting development is that Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, is coming to the Wii in November.
268406	269167	That looks hilarious.
269647	278093	But it's actually being put out by Capcom, and it's going to be, and I quote, a fully animated interactive adventure game.
279114	283117	So maybe it's going to be fun for...
283564	286545	I would like to say I saw that at Comic Con this year, and what little I played of it was really crappy.
308850	311591	Well, then again, Phoenix Wright doesn't really take itself very seriously.
311631	314672	Did you see the pun that they put in the last Phoenix Wright game?
314872	315812	No, I don't play those games.
316453	318733	Oh, they did this as Sparta.
319334	320214	It was like crazy.
320234	323435	Wow, this is totally original.
324615	327896	This is Sparta.
328217	329237	300, I get it.
330537	335499	Anyways, something that is totally original, a game by Square Enix.
336207	339189	That's not featuring any Final Fantasy characters.
340690	343431	Wait, is there any Dragon Quest characters in it?
345693	346213	I don't think so.
346993	348374	Is it Tales of blank?
348594	349455	Blank of Mana?
349595	350015	What is it?
350695	351616	It is a puzzle game.
352757	355198	So... Hooray!
356919	357559	Well, you know what?
358080	361102	You joke about... Urgeis 2, please.
361962	362823	No, it's not Urgeis 2.
363163	363443	That would be...
364068	365049	Pocket Fighter!
391175	407919	DarkTetsuya says, what they don't tell you is that Cloud and Sephiroth are unlockable characters.
408879	412660	That comment coming from our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
414361	414721	Whatever.
414801	416241	Sephiroth, Sephiroth, whatever.
416441	416861	I don't care.
417061	417621	Who cares?
417841	418502	Overplayed.
418582	419162	That's his name.
419302	419662	Overplayed.
421933	424275	and Drew Nami says Tales of Blank is Namco Bandai.
424555	427498	You know, that's true and yet I said it anyway and I knew that.
427778	428159	It's weird.
429540	431002	Like I said, I'm broken tonight, remember?
431943	433504	It's because of all the cocaine you've been doing.
433744	434485	Apparently.
436087	437288	I don't do drugs, that's not cool.
438169	444074	Alright, but what is cool is the virtual console and what's really, really super cool, Donkey Kong Jr.
444174	444555	Math.
445736	447257	You know, I actually had a Donkey Kong Jr.
447277	447977	Math cartridge.
448177	448637	Go figure.
449378	453259	But I saw it for like two bucks once, and I thought, ooh, this will be a collector's item someday.
453979	454600	Yeah, I was wrong.
454860	455920	But anyway, Donkey Kong Jr.
455940	458461	Math has made its way to the Virtual Console this week.
458541	462783	I guess you could say it was part of like a whole back-to-school type thing, because it did come out.
462823	464683	Of course, it's 500 points for Donkey Kong Jr.
464703	468465	Math, which, by the way, way too much money for Donkey Kong Jr.
468485	468565	Math.
468585	469885	Here, I have a suggestion for you guys.
470026	470886	Here's what you should do.
471548	475489	For 500 points or 5 bucks, you could buy Donkey Kong Jr.
475509	475809	Math.
476629	478790	Yeah, that may sound like a good deal for you, but how about this?
479190	483711	Spend just a little bit more money, buy Animal Crossing for the GameCube, and guess what?
483731	486132	Look, you've got a bunch of virtual console games right there.
487332	490473	By the way, Animal Crossing is one of those backwards-compatible games as well, right?
490613	495594	Exactly, and it's probably around 20 bucks right now, if not cheaper.
495754	497815	Goddamn, I can't wait for Animal Crossing Wii.
499122	505783	Even if the DS one was a little bit disappointing because it was kind of the same thing, I really hope they kind of change it up and make Animal Crossing Wii just awesome.
506704	507124	You know what?
507204	518246	I was actually using the Japanese GameCube one as a training tool to help me read better because it doesn't use any kanji except for really simple ones.
519526	522807	And they say, you know how they say every letter?
523890	530337	It still sounds that way, but you can actually hear a little bit more of it like they're actually saying it.
531158	538947	And so I found it to be very educational, and I kind of hope that they'd have a language mode in the release that we get.
539287	540148	I think that'd be a good idea.
540629	541550	You never know, it might happen.
541930	542611	It'd be very cool.
544046	546288	Also, I want to point out what also came out on the Virtual Console.
546368	549391	Adventure Island, which was one of the very first NES games I ever owned.
549431	550852	Adventure Island is also out.
551492	559659	And if you want to hop over to the Genesis, Landstalker, The Treasures of King Gnoll, as well as Bonk 3, Bonk's Big Adventure on the TurboGrafx-16.
559959	564662	Just a note for those of you guys listening on the podcast, this would be last week's releases by the time you guys hear this.
564682	568986	But for our live listeners on Sunday, that's all the stuff that came out for you guys this week.
570079	575105	By the way, also, we have a very important message from SSJ100 Matt in our chat room right now.
575165	579189	Apparently there's one of those character battles going on on GameFacts.com right now.
579870	591001	And it should be noted now, again, this only really will work for those of you guys on Sunday night, but it should be noted that our beloved, one of our favorite game characters of all time, Pyramid Head, is in the running right now in the character battle.
591481	592743	And Pyramid Head needs more votes.
593793	598857	He's up against Aron from Final Fantasy, Chris Redfield from, I believe, Resident Evil, right?
599138	601720	And Shadow the Hedgehog from, of course, the Sonic series.
602040	603521	But Pyramid Head needs your help.
604282	605523	So please go vote for Pyramid Head.
606384	608405	Or else we will send him to your house to rape you.
609126	609426	That's all.
612769	613209	I voted.
613910	615571	Did you vote for Pyramid Head?
615831	616672	I'm very proud of you.
616712	618874	That's all I have to say on Virtual Console.
618934	620815	I have things to say on Virtual Console.
620855	621676	Well, isn't that nice?
622096	622917	It's all Sega.
623581	627864	Sega, Sega, Sega, Sega, Sega, or in this case for the UK, Mega.
628704	629645	Mega Drive Games.
629685	634007	We have Sonic the Hedgehog 3, which is really good.
634508	644193	And then one of my personal favorites, Ghouls N' Ghosts, which is really still freaking hard even to this day, because it's like, let's play Ghouls N' Ghosts, blah, blah, blah, beat Satan.
644554	645794	Oh, I have to play again.
646295	646715	Shit.
647335	649997	So that's, by the way, Ghouls N' Ghosts in a nutshell.
651394	653434	E-SWAT, City Under Siege Shining in the Darkness Crackdown
675115	689064	I really need to go back and play some more Crackdown I remember the Crackdown that came out on 360 a little while ago This is two words, Crackdown Oh, that's an old ass game And maybe it had a different name over here, I don't know Why is it that the folks in the UK get completely different releases?
689104	690604	Why don't they just make it the same for everybody?
690624	694667	You have to save the world from evil cyborgs and then bomb them That's kind of cool
695373	704258	But just to let our listeners overseas know, they are 800 points apiece, translated to 5 pounds 60 and 8 euros.
704599	705279	So, there you go.
706900	710462	Alright, check it out if you're in the UK and need some more virtual console games.
712363	721789	Now to kind of switch gears to something a little different, Square Enix was saying that PlayStation 3 needs their marketing to be straightened up.
722289	724331	And I think basically referring to...
726123	737592	This is kind of going back to the stories we were talking about in Part A where they were calling it a computer, strictly a home media center or something like that.
738393	746820	Because basically according to Wada, he says, Sony first unveiled the PlayStation 3 as a mighty home electronics product.
746880	753665	Then after some badgering from game companies, it shifted the position of the console closer to a game machine.
754902	760586	The future of the PlayStation 3 would be tough if its marketing strategy is not straightened up.
761446	764428	And, you know, to be honest, I can kind of agree with him a little bit.
764868	772633	If you've seen any of the marketing that they've done, you know, in the UK, especially with, you know, This Is Living...
773405	776088	It makes no fucking sense whatsoever.
776489	783597	And even now, I remember the first commercials that came out for the PlayStation 3 with the crying baby doll and weird shit like that.
783657	784938	It made no fucking sense.
785439	789784	Luckily now though, they show gameplay during their commercials and just kind of leave it at that.
790224	791386	That is what they need to be doing.
791446	794149	So it sounds like they're kind of smarting up a little bit, but
794997	801182	My god, do not fucking let the people that did the advertising campaign in the UK get a hold of anything.
801222	802323	In fact, they should all be fired.
802543	805545	Or the people that did the All I Want for Xmas is a PSP.com.
806326	806526	Yeah.
807587	808348	Yeah, all fired.
808548	808988	Good stuff.
809469	810650	They all should be sacked.
810990	812851	And then the people that sacked them will be sacked as well.
813612	816134	And then they'll do them again at great expense with llamas.
817645	822448	All right, well, moving on to something, and now for something completely different, so to speak.
822488	823488	This is how not to be seen.
824729	828411	There was, of course, big announcements in the nerd world this week from Apple.
828891	833234	And Apple is launching, just in time for the holiday season, they are launching all sorts of new crap.
833834	837516	Basically, now they have an iPhone without the phone, which they're calling the new iPod.
838180	846262	They are also releasing a classic iPod, but what should be noted and what the hell this has to do with gaming is a new iPod Nano that's coming out.
846582	854805	The new iPod Nano has a little bit more of a wider screen, and what should also be noted is that not only does the Nano have this, but the classics ship with this as well.
855205	856025	Some games.
856865	858967	Some games will actually be included with these.
859487	863150	The games will be included Vortex, iQuiz, and Klondike.
863590	866692	iQuiz and Klondike, I believe, have been available on the store for a little while.
866773	868033	I think Vortex might have been as well.
868574	874678	Vortex is basically like a 3D version of Arknoid or Breakout, if you will, where basically you move the paddle.
875259	881123	I think that's a pretty creative use of the wheel, is that you actually move the little wheel around, which moves the paddle around.
882043	882864	and it's like Breakout.
882884	885808	You're breaking bricks towards the center of the screen.
885868	886689	So, kind of cool.
887149	889332	I played a whole crap ton of Arkanoid back in the day.
889352	890072	Yeah, back in the day.
892067	906534	It's kind of interesting, and it brings to note that especially with the release of the iPod without the phone or whatever you want to call it, it's kind of interesting that Apple does seem to be sticking their foot in there a little more and more with this whole gaming thing.
906874	911956	And I don't think it's time to say, like, OMG, Apple's going to release a gaming console because we all remember Pippin.
912317	917339	But I think that it's interesting to see, especially when it comes to… You remember the Pippin?
917359	917439	Yeah.
918486	920687	I've completely shoved that out of my head.
921368	926890	I think it would be interesting to see what kind of happens with the whole, like, you know, especially with, like, classic games.
930312	931453	I was just telling you.
931473	932533	The sandwich smells.
932633	933414	Get it out of here.
934434	935535	Mmm, sandwich.
936755	937256	Sorry, Eddie.
937276	938996	You can come back when the sandwich is gone.
939297	941438	Here's an old system name that will make you laugh, Rob.
941458	941818	What's that?
942238	942958	GameCom.
944299	944899	Wow.
945320	946020	I have one.
947541	947841	Really?
948106	948366	Yes.
949787	951927	Then again, I also had an N-Gage and we gave it away.
952627	955608	You have a lot of weird consoles.
956249	958970	You also have a lot of weird emails this week, I bet.
959350	960070	Oh, God.
960450	964771	Always invite our listeners to email us at our website, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
964791	965432	I want one of these, Rob.
966032	967192	And send us some emails.
967432	968573	This is adorable.
968773	969173	What things?
969193	970473	I want one of these iPod things.
970853	971174	Which ones?
971194	973594	The little one with the square looking one.
973614	974335	The Nanos?
974695	975515	Is that the Nano?
975842	977383	I actually kind of want an iPhone.
977443	978023	Yeah, that's a nano.
978043	979044	That's cute.
979484	981686	I actually kind of want an iPhone now that they dropped in price.
981706	982526	We'll save that another day.
982767	983507	Let's do the e-mails.
984187	985628	Mailbag at originalsradio.com.
985668	989591	DarkSakura will now open up the mailbag and read a few of her favorites.
990471	993433	At least I'll read a few of the ones that actually have substance to them.
994094	996976	And I'm sorry, Misty, I did get both of yours, and I'm very sorry that you have to work.
997956	998417	Really sorry.
1000178	1001919	This one's from our friend Rob with two Bs.
1002691	1012119	I read in Nintendo Power the next version of Williams Classic Pinball will include Gorgar, the first talkie, Black Knight, which inspired David's Midnight Magic, and Pinbot.
1012179	1012539	Hooray!
1012840	1017403	I'm hoping for Z and B to be the flippers for the nunchuck.
1018725	1020666	And my two bits on Space Giraffe.
1021627	1022067	Bit 1.
1022228	1024990	I love the arcade's style play in similarity to Tempest 2000.
1025971	1026131	Bit 2.
1026351	1030995	The blurry visuals are sort of low-res and the game's LSD-inspired visuals seem to be their
1031573	1033896	I bought it, but I haven't really played it much.
1033936	1034257	Boredom get.
1047811	1049531	And one last topic, PS3 pricing.
1049551	1051872	The original price was intended for the hardcore gamer.
1052272	1053352	Not many people wanted it.
1053752	1057893	It was priced too high for resale on eBay, and it was readily available in mid-December.
1057973	1061074	Did Sony effectively kill the third-party market for initial PS3 games?
1061454	1064255	Did they actually get the money that the eBayers would have gotten?
1064955	1067815	It's an interesting thought because the answers to both seem to be yes.
1068355	1071696	They still didn't stop the stabbings and shootings, but I don't blame them for that.
1071816	1072976	See you later, Rob Bubba.
1074677	1075557	I like hearing from Rob.
1076069	1077069	It's been a little while, so.
1077489	1082111	I actually am really looking forward to this whole pinball game that's going to be on the Wii that we talked about at the very beginning.
1082891	1084051	Like, pinbot and stuff.
1084931	1101036	I would like to see a type of reincarnation of the old school pinbot on the NES as an optional mode where you could actually have the little aliens come out on the table and try to eat your ball and all the crazy shit they had in the NES version of the game.
1101336	1101776	You know what?
1101956	1102116	What?
1103211	1105992	Right now our NES is hooked up with Pinbot in it.
1106912	1107793	That is rad.
1108953	1113915	Of course, also hooked up to the same receiver is our PS2 with Guitar Hero.
1115175	1115475	Nice.
1115655	1116295	Yeah, anyway.
1117796	1119156	Many greetings, Orange Lounge Radio.
1119216	1120357	I'm a big fan of your show.
1120657	1121997	No, it's not that I like your show a lot.
1122037	1124818	It's just that a lifetime of Doritos has made me very big.
1124898	1125218	Wait, who is this?
1125238	1125758	I'm only joking.
1126479	1126979	Mr. Patch.
1127179	1127479	Oh, okay.
1128319	1130420	I love your show, but for about three months I lost you.
1131038	1131798	No, not really.
1154198	1159483	And I understand it's not the best game for some hardcore gamers, but for me, Banjo-Kazooie really turned me into the gamer I am today.
1160044	1161565	Anyways, finally my question.
1161986	1168933	Do you think Microsoft will push Banjo-3-E when its release date comes near, or will it be a quiet release like some of the other Rare games?
1169453	1174678	Thanks for taking the time to read this email, and thanks even more if you answer my question with curse words.
1175179	1176340	Love, HeyMrPatch.
1176500	1177081	Well, fuck!
1178449	1179852	Listen here, you little fucker.
1187426	1195111	Yeah, I'm not the biggest fan of these games, but I think Microsoft will realize that there is a fan base for the games.
1195972	1197032	Guys like you, you know.
1197513	1202496	And I think they will, for that reason, definitely try to get it out there that, hey, it's back.
1202916	1204337	Banjo-Kazooie comes back.
1204437	1207379	And I think you will see a little bit of a marketing campaign like that.
1207719	1215204	I don't think it's going to be near the size that you would see for one of their AAA titles, but I don't see any reason why I won't get
1216053	1216833	Some notability.
1216934	1218694	I don't think it'll be a quiet release by any means.
1219795	1220095	There you go.
1220675	1223737	I think of Banjo-Kazooie, and for some reason I always think of Pandemonium.
1224497	1225318	Do you remember that game, Rob?
1227159	1227539	Um, no.
1228199	1237144	Pandemonium was a side-scrolling, very bizarre game, but I actually have the Japanese version of it, which was Magical Hoppers, and they re-pixeled it or whatever, and...
1238012	1250063	But I don't know why, but it's always one of those... I always think of those very early PlayStation 1 games and the early Nintendo games and every game that's come out since then that's in that franchise, like Spyro.
1250704	1255588	I always lump them into that one category that I label, why God, why?
1257830	1264376	SSJ100 Matt in our chat room at chat.org.com says, Fuck Banjo, give me a new fucking Killer Instincts.
1267421	1269041	Why so much love for Killer Instincts?
1269061	1271502	Because I've also seen people with a lot of hate for Killer Instinct.
1271822	1281445	Keep in mind, I played a shit ton of the first Killer Instinct when it... Or if I'm going to go give my homage... How many pounds in a shit ton?
1281705	1284466	I'm going to give my homage to Don French right now.
1285266	1290347	I played crock shits of Killer Instinct when I was in college.
1291468	1295889	And KI2 was very exciting to me when it came out because...
1296784	1311690	Except that I hated that they changed all of Orchid's moves, but it was very, very cool for me, and even to the point where Dan had it on his Super Nintendo when I lived here, well, when I lived in Alabama, to the point that he kept starting over and over until it started off with Orchid's level so he could copy the music for me.
1312810	1313691	Isn't that romantic?
1313811	1314591	That's very sweet.
1314831	1315471	Anyway, next email.
1315732	1316292	Aw, barf.
1317472	1319233	Combo breaker, next email, please.
1319753	1320714	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1321614	1322194	Oi, peeps.
1322634	1324015	This is Nosoulboy.
1325234	1326835	Alcohol and Tylenol can kill you.
1327816	1328376	Prime 3.
1328596	1329937	Oh yeah, you weren't here last week.
1330517	1334640	I was actually, you want to know what I did last week?
1334720	1337321	It was my anniversary.
1337341	1338122	Were you seeing Weird Al?
1338902	1339603	I did more than that.
1340923	1345966	On Friday night, Dan and I hung out and did stuff.
1346887	1351670	Well, actually I hung out online and talked to people and then Dan and I did a couple of things.
1352670	1353831	Saturday we went to Benihana.
1355751	1368318	and I drank a lot and Sunday I cracked open my bottle of Metoxa which I was going to bring over and you said you were sick so I was like I don't want to get sick not on my anniversary so I said I'm not going to hang out with Bob
1369031	1370472	It wasn't contagious, whatever it was.
1370532	1371292	It's gone, thank God.
1371332	1373533	Rob had the rocket pneumonia and the boogie-woogie flu.
1373693	1381777	Here's the thing, and I do want to apologize if I came off like an idiot, but I did say something about I'd been taking Tylenol because I was sick, and I was drinking because I don't care.
1382277	1383698	And I said something like, it's not going to kill me.
1384078	1384679	Here's the thing.
1386239	1389801	Obviously, if you drink a lot and you take a lot of Tylenol, yes, that can kill you.
1389921	1390661	I'm not stupid.
1390821	1394743	And I've seen a lot of kids do a lot of stupid things, unfortunately, in my lifetime.
1395104	1395724	But here's the thing.
1396383	1397484	A little tiny bit.
1397524	1398524	It wasn't that much Tylenol.
1398584	1399124	It really wasn't.
1399184	1401265	It wasn't that much liquor I drank last week either.
1401365	1405067	I think little bits, like a lot of things, moderation is okay.
1405487	1406908	Overdoing it, not okay.
1407168	1409249	So, the more you know, NBC.
1409309	1409729	There you go.
1409809	1412211	Can I finish with an email now?
1412251	1412511	You may.
1412591	1416293	Prime 3, you can die if you don't kill Meta Ridley in time.
1416713	1418073	Yes, I suck, but give me a break.
1418153	1419534	Second Wii game I ever played.
1419974	1423236	I'm a Mac lover, but iPhones are for people with too much money and too much to do.
1424218	1425180	Finish Bioshock.
1425540	1429066	That part that scared me was when the Spicers started playing dead.
1429707	1433873	Oh, and also the huge room with the water on the floor and the plaster-covered ballet dancers are very creepy.
1435188	1438350	I listen to your podcast and game theory.
1438470	1443414	As a designer, I'd really like to hear more about excellent game design as opposed to graphics or effects.
1444315	1451840	For instance, on the DC Phantasy Star Online's UI and menu system, amazingly fluid and functional during gameplay.
1451980	1452661	Hell yes!
1453321	1460887	That was one of the biggest things that I hated about Phantasy Star Universe is that the menus in Phantasy Star Online were so much freaking better.
1461527	1462428	Okay, so I'm going to keep going.
1463384	1470127	or for anyone who's ever played a squad game to compare it to the four player action in Crystal Chronicles on GameCube.
1470807	1477010	People started working together in a way that is just genius and it's totally obvious that it was the intent of the designers.
1477110	1478930	Or how about most of the games by Treasure?
1479231	1480171	A freaking men.
1480651	1483692	Talk about walking out on a limb and creating amazing experiences.
1484073	1486974	These games are perfect arguments for the game as art debate.
1487694	1488234	You know what?
1489155	1492536	Treasure is just... Okay, Treasure gave us
1493543	1494023	Ikaruga.
1494784	1496084	They gave us Bangayo.
1496204	1497504	I love Bangayo.
1497665	1498145	Oh my god.
1498165	1500025	The game is so cool.
1500165	1508388	They gave us Silhouette Mirage, which is just... It was... When it came out, it was like something nobody had ever seen.
1508628	1510549	No one had ever seen anything like that before.
1511349	1514250	Even that dorky little chameleon twist game was cool.
1514290	1517531	I mean, Treasure is all about the innovation in gameplay.
1518972	1522413	Another game that you're talking about having people work together is Pac-Man vs...
1524036	1528879	Where you have three people on individual game... S, it's GBAs actually.
1529940	1532702	Or a Game Boy SP because of the connector that they use for it.
1532762	1535564	But they control the ghosts and you have your person as Pac-Man.
1536965	1538406	You know, I gotta hand it to the GameCube.
1538926	1543910	Those games that had the connectivity between the DS and the GameCube were a heck of a lot of fun.
1544190	1545511	Like the Four Swords Adventures.
1545571	1548273	I had a lot of fun playing that game with some of my friends.
1548673	1551435	It's kind of a shame because you see that potential...
1552270	1553572	Thanks for watching!
1569372	1569953	Yes, Eddie's back.
1591291	1591651	Hey, I'm back.
1591812	1601563	Yeah, no, I agree because what I was thinking is a lot of those games would be cool is if the DS was like a device in the game and like it was like a spy sort of espionage game.
1601583	1606028	Like you would get like secret messages on your DS or something like that and it would, you know, light up or something like that.
1606048	1606889	I think that'd be cool.
1606929	1611614	Like you're saying more like make it more like reality, you know, just make it really interactive with the game.
1611634	1612295	I think it'd be awesome.
1613496	1625598	You know what else I thought was cool, kind of speaking of that, was that whole, you know, in a red steel, like, you could, you'd put the Wiimote up to your ear, because it has a speaker in there, and it would tell you what your objective was, like, hey, you need to kill player three or whatever it is.
1625618	1626278	That was lame.
1626299	1628719	It sounded cool, but it was lame.
1628739	1628979	I know.
1629579	1638981	Unfortunately, the game turned out to be kind of dumb, but I think the idea was good, and I can recognize that that was, you know, especially for a launch title, that was a pretty neat usage of the stuff.
1639551	1646293	Because they could do that like if the phone's ringing in the game or something, like you put the Wiimote up to your ear or something like that and press A, and then it's like they're talking to you on the phone.
1646313	1646773	That'd be cool.
1647653	1648794	Well, you can do that in WarioWare.
1649574	1650694	That's one of the mini games.
1650714	1653615	Yeah, you pick up the phone, and then you hear it coming out the speaker and the Wiimote.
1653635	1654295	Hello, hello.
1654855	1655596	It's really funny.
1656836	1658516	That kind of little shit goes a long way.
1658576	1658957	I love it.
1659497	1660637	So there you have it.
1661737	1661977	All right.
1662818	1663018	Sorry.
1663538	1664598	That's my response to the email.
1665418	1667379	I don't even know if that's what they were looking for, but there you have it.
1668084	1668624	Um, okay.
1670806	1671726	I'm adjusting.
1673107	1673568	Wedgie?
1673808	1674108	No.
1674648	1678231	This chair's like sitting on, it's like the princess and the pea.
1679251	1680592	You know, where you've got, hey!
1680612	1680692	What?
1680712	1686316	I'm asking where I'll be in Tylenol.
1686336	1687056	It's in the bathroom.
1687717	1688678	Yeah, I believe I do.
1689178	1692420	Yes, I'll go show you where the Tylenol is while Jamie reads more emails.
1693385	1694345	Look at the left side of the cabinet.
1694365	1700447	This chair's like the princess and the pea, you know, where you have all this cushion, but you feel that one little lump that's like, I can't sit in this chair.
1700908	1701248	That's it.
1701928	1703208	Okay, princess, next email.
1703949	1706489	Hi to you, O'Reilly folks.
1706810	1707090	Wave.
1708050	1714152	Anyway, I went to Project Revolution Tour here in Chicago, and me and my friend got there around 1.30.
1714492	1717973	I found out the band I really wanted to see, Linkin Park, wasn't playing until 9.30.
1719034	1722715	So me and my friend hung out and walked around for a few hours, and then we saw...
1724489	1751998	MSI and that was cool now upon walking around I discovered a tent that had two long banners that just had three on them and believe 92507 at the bottom you know so I was like do one and asked the two guys standing there if I could go in they said that it was a private party after this I just kind of listened hard as much as you can at a rock concert and I heard the distinctive noise of shields recharging I knew I had to get in
1753323	1756226	That was before as Mindless Self-Indulgence.
1756306	1757707	Okay, I was like, hey, that's a band I like.
1759048	1761911	Now, fast forward to the end of the MSI show.
1762031	1765834	I went back to find the tent open with quite a few people inside.
1765974	1770638	I stood there with a few other people and knew I was going to get in somehow.
1770678	1774141	Unfortunately, one guy gave out three passes to three people around me.
1774682	1778024	I stuck around, though, and saw none.
1778925	1779326	Okay.
1779626	1779726	Oh.
1780242	1784365	None other than Jay Wineland, I guess that's... I don't know if this is misspelled.
1785546	1786847	The head sound designer for Bungie.
1786887	1788868	I pointed to him and said, Hey, you're Jay, right?
1788928	1789489	The sound guy.
1789809	1791690	And he just nodded in a smile and says, Wow, that was good.
1791730	1792551	Kind of creepy, but good.
1792571	1793431	And disappeared for a sec.
1793752	1795413	And then he came back with a pass for me to get in.
1796293	1798175	I was all happy, got his autograph, and went and played.
1798575	1801317	Let me tell you, Narrows is going to be a classic map.
1801457	1802898	This is about Halo 3, by the way.
1803746	1808648	Seriously, the build he had wasn't final, but you could tell it almost was because the fourth grenade was up there.
1809148	1811549	Unfortunately, all we had were the following maps.
1811609	1815131	High Ground, Valhalla, Snowbound, Narrows, Epitaph, Last Resort, and Sand Trap.
1815771	1818492	One thing I loved about the game overall, everything was colorful.
1818792	1821254	I don't mean like bright colors everywhere, but it was just vibrant.
1821714	1829197	I couldn't see clearly 100% of the time, but unlike in Halo 2 where I have to turn the brightness up a ton, it looked much better than Gears of War.
1830822	1832383	Anyway, I didn't see much new stuff.
1832443	1838207	I really did get to see a game of Infection Slash Zombies, though, which I didn't quite understand.
1838287	1838907	Weird shrug.
1839727	1847392	So around 7.30 to 8 o'clock or so, Mike, Rob, and Joe from Linkin Park walk in and just sit down and start playing.
1847472	1853936	Everyone in the room outside who didn't get in was all OMG for a while, and people just sat down and played.
1853956	1855217	I totally kicked their butts.
1856077	1860340	Mike and Joe, the rapper and DJ, were pretty good, and you could tell Rob, the drummer, doesn't play much.
1861408	1864169	I hung around Rob, got his autograph as well, and Mike Slater.
1864669	1865249	But Rob was there.
1865329	1867250	As long as I don't get last place, I'm good.
1867710	1868270	And he didn't.
1868290	1868951	He did pretty good.
1869271	1872772	Oh, and that was pretty much the highlight of my summer and definitely the best concert I've ever been to.
1872812	1874292	Here's any pictures of the event.
1874852	1880654	So I will actually save this email so that we can put this up on the website.
1880694	1881154	How's that sound?
1882195	1882435	Rad.
1882475	1885216	Yeah, you should put the pictures up because I was actually looking at that email earlier this week.
1885296	1886196	And that's from Sycoon, by the way.
1888057	1889337	That's our buddy, Sycoon.
1891007	1893249	Good job, Sycoon, with your field reporting.
1895331	1896192	More emails.
1896712	1896913	Yes.
1898214	1899175	Hey, OLR crew.
1899535	1903098	There are quite a few new games coming out that are being reported as having short play times.
1903159	1905881	Heavenly Sword, for example, is just six to ten hours.
1906301	1916211	Now, I don't have a problem with short games, but I do have a problem with paying 60 bucks for them, so I decided to join Gamefly to rent those shorter games and play them through without the heavy cost.
1917102	1917342	Okay, wow.
1917362	1917422	Um...
1942415	1942795	You know what?
1942835	1944536	Blockbuster didn't kill the movie industry.
1945576	1947497	And Netflix certainly hasn't damaged it either.
1947597	1950178	So why would Gamefly kill the games industry?
1950539	1954860	Because Gamefly still has to buy all those games from the publishers to get out to rent.
1954940	1956841	It all depends on how you see it.
1956921	1960603	I'm sure the publishers don't like Gamefly, but there's nothing really they can do about it.
1960983	1967086	I mean, because, I don't know, one argument you could say, well, people are just going to rent games and they're not going to buy them.
1967226	1970307	So we want people buying our games, not renting them.
1970714	1974237	But in the other hand, though, people rent the game, like it, and then maybe buy it.
1975358	1978020	Yeah, make a game worth buying and people will buy it.
1978480	1978620	Right?
1978640	1981223	Because how many times... I mean, seriously, that's what it boils down to.
1981583	1983785	How many people... I mean, I know I did this when I was a kid all the time.
1983825	1985446	I would rent a game and I would love it so much.
1985486	1987468	I'd be like, Mommy, Mommy, buy it for me for Christmas.
1987828	1989729	And she would because she loved me.
1992872	1993933	At least that's what she told me.
1994773	1995414	To my face.
1996735	1997255	So there you go.
1997716	1999217	Yeah, it's your face behind your back.
2000058	2000338	Anyway.
2001184	2005308	Hey OLR, I know you guys have been looking for someone who doesn't like Bioshock.
2005848	2011393	And even with my praises sung a few episodes ago, I've made your complaint about the game after getting the retail version.
2011793	2020801	It's far too dark and things that are shooting at you are impossible to see because they're either too far away and have deadly aim or you can't see them because the whole place is freaking dark.
2021481	2023203	Has anyone else had this problem?
2023303	2024384	I can't be the only one.
2025264	2028427	The story is going to keep me going through the game though, it's very intriguing.
2028820	2031253	Cheers and keep up the podcasting, AZHP
2035111	2037032	I really want to hear... I mean, that was a good email.
2037132	2040112	But I really want to hear from people that, like, fucking hate Bioshock.
2040493	2042293	But not just because I said so.
2042413	2046434	Like, I really want to hear a really good counterpoint to the whole, you know, everybody loves Bioshock.
2046674	2050375	There's always somebody that does... I mean, there's two sides to every story.
2050415	2054816	So somewhere on the internet, there is somebody that hates Bioshock for a good reason.
2054876	2056897	I want to know why, and I want to know that reason.
2057057	2059218	I did see something like that on Kotaku.
2059278	2059898	It was from...
2061601	2063042	The consumerist, I want to say.
2063342	2064962	But was it somebody just trying to be funny?
2064982	2065903	I don't know if they were trying to be funny.
2065923	2066803	Because I think I saw something.
2066823	2068023	It was just somebody trying to be funny.
2068604	2069504	Like, it wasn't real.
2069864	2073005	You know, I want to hear some real, like, I hate Bioshock and this is why.
2073705	2074066	Please.
2076146	2082689	And the last email is actually, wow, kind of long.
2085090	2085730	Read a snippet.
2087200	2091662	Well, it's mostly suggestions for games to do on the show, so I'm going to skip down to the actual gaming part.
2094503	2099744	To make this email a little more video game related, I'm a Wii PS2, is it Wii S2?
2100425	2103506	Owner that just is about ready to pounce on the Xbox 360.
2103566	2105526	Now the premium has HDMI and a price cut.
2106167	2108147	And so I've already waited this long.
2108167	2116350	Should I wait a little bit longer until the Falcon 65NM chips come out?
2117601	2119962	or with the 3 year warranty should I just finally pick one up?
2120383	2127488	A friend of mine just picked up an Xbox 360 Premium without the HDMI and it died within a week and not with the red rings of death.
2128169	2133693	Any game played would instantly lock up after 5 minutes of turning the system on and it wasn't in a cramped cabinet either.
2134213	2141899	Makes me a little tentative about getting one with the hotter 90nm chips or if it does have the extra heatsink.
2143110	2155187	Since it's not Red Wings of Death and not covered in the extended warranty, although you're still able to take it back to the store, this got long still ended here by hailstorm in our forums.
2157011	2158372	XBOX 360 Now or Wait Here's the deal
2181673	2187398	I honestly think it'll be, I mean, maybe they'll do a little tiny chipset switcheroo, but I don't think it'll be that big a deal.
2187458	2197267	The games they're putting out now, I mean, any game they put out is going to be designed to run flawlessly on the, well, if all the testing is done the way it should be, to run as best as it can on the consoles that are out now.
2197308	2199570	So I wouldn't worry so much about waiting for a chipset.
2199590	2207457	And here's the thing, if you're waiting for price reduction, new package or whatever, ain't going to happen for a year, until next Christmas season, or at least well after Christmas.
2207837	2216821	So I would say unless you're prepared to wait six months for some significant changing in the structures, price, offerings of the 360, just go get one now.
2218122	2222204	Honestly, as long as you document, I think, whatever happens.
2223785	2228267	We've actually only had to return one system, but I think that we did it through the store itself.
2228887	2234530	And we've actually got the Elite now, Dan and I do, and we've never had a problem.
2235157	2256285	and if you're also worried about that whole oh I went out and got an iPhone oh shit they just dropped the price by 200 bucks I got screwed don't worry that won't that won't happen yeah I get well I guess now they're doing the hundred dollar you know rebate or whatever but still I I know some people who bought an iPhone that weren't happy when they heard that announcement I know I'm sure I know who you're referring to several people I know weren't happy but yeah well um
2257967	2261509	Oh, shoot, I was going to say something else about the Xbox 360.
2261609	2261849	Oh, yeah.
2262809	2272373	I, though, have not seen what the HD movies look like on the Xbox 360, but I have seen an HD movie, and I kind of like Blu-ray better.
2272393	2273954	I hate to say it.
2273974	2276315	The quality is exactly the same.
2276415	2276795	Sound.
2276835	2277175	Sound.
2278880	2283283	Am I the only one that's not that intensely excited about this next gen of video?
2294972	2295953	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2322006	2329849	and you know when they start making HD, DVD and Blu-ray porn, you are so there in the next generation of video.
2330409	2333850	They already have that and I'm not so there.
2335350	2336631	Rob, we still need to see Pirates.
2337851	2339251	Oh, don't they have Pirates on HD?
2339412	2339952	And Blu-ray.
2339972	2341292	It's on both.
2341532	2342513	I think I'm going to get the Blu-ray.
2342953	2349435	I used to work at a video store and people would be like, you know, I want to return this movie because when I pause it, I couldn't see the picture and it's like, okay.
2349455	2350215	Okay, listen.
2350885	2352166	I do have HD porn.
2352306	2356029	I stream it to my 360, because thank you, Media Center Extender.
2356409	2361072	But, you know what, Black Boy, that's what Black Boy says in chat.
2361112	2363474	Black Boy says, who goes out and buys porn discs?
2363574	2364735	It's all download today.
2365115	2367657	Here's the thing, no, I'm not saying I'm going to go buy the porn discs.
2367677	2370459	I'm just someone who buys a lot of porn.
2370719	2371219	Here's the thing, though.
2371640	2376283	I'm waiting for the discs to come out, so someone can rip them and put them on the internet, and then I can download them.
2376744	2376944	See?
2377144	2378985	Wow, you really need to get out.
2379005	2381205	I mean, seriously, this stuff's out there already.
2381345	2384326	For the record, the only reason I have a Blu-ray player is because we actually bought a PS3.
2384346	2387847	I'm not saying it's horrible.
2387867	2390288	I'm just saying, I'm not saying it's horrible.
2390308	2395049	I'm just like, I'm not that, I was like really, really wanting to get a DVD when they came out, DVD player.
2395369	2399570	And I'm not, I'm like, eh, you know, I can wait until they battle it out between HD and Blu-ray.
2400636	2407038	I'm sort of thinking about if I did buy a new computer, I think the next one I get will be a VAIO because all the new VAIOs come out with Blu-ray players.
2407798	2408838	Hmm.
2409318	2412079	And they cost the same that my old one did when I got it new.
2412419	2413440	Hmm.
2414560	2415280	Or meh.
2416220	2416640	Meh.
2418761	2419481	Is that it for emails?
2420001	2421022	Yes, Rob.
2421222	2421902	That's it.
2422062	2423342	Bye, mailbag.
2425083	2425383	All right.
2426943	2427363	Now what?
2427403	2428084	Back into some news.
2428904	2429564	Yes, news.
2430900	2436062	So, anyways, this is not surprising, but it's actually pretty cool.
2436863	2445826	Manhunt 2 has leaked out online, and that would be the uncensored beta from European regions, because it is in PAL format.
2446366	2450188	So, of course, everybody's been jumping on the bit to actually play it.
2450748	2458711	No word if it plays well or not, because it is beta, but I'm definitely going to find out.
2459930	2463392	Ew, MrDeBucket in chat says Manhunt 2 has neck raping.
2463452	2464012	Is that true?
2464072	2464873	That's gross.
2465673	2468875	I don't know, but I heard there's something about ripping off testicles.
2470976	2471856	It sounds awesome.
2471916	2473557	Eddie just covered his balls in the studio.
2473577	2474298	That game sounds great.
2474398	2476359	I cannot wait to play this on the Wii.
2477019	2479280	If you're a woman, it's coming to the Wii.
2479540	2479980	Oh my god.
2482122	2483083	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2510822	2512043	That's not a fucking joke.
2512083	2512804	That's gross.
2512984	2514706	What if someone has a tracheotomy?
2514726	2521552	Ew, you want to fuck somebody's hole instead of tracheotomy?
2521592	2522573	No!
2522793	2524534	I was trying to think, how would that work?
2526036	2529199	And I would think that it would have to either be someone with their head chopped off or a tracheotomy.
2531220	2533683	That would be a two-part explicit episode this week.
2533723	2534964	Congratulations, crew.
2535444	2536185	You've done good.
2539516	2543659	I'm so glad you're not holding a microphone right now and that Op 11 is down.
2547062	2549083	That's wrong.
2549143	2549383	Wow.
2550804	2552846	Anyway.
2552946	2554267	Anyway.
2569696	2574939	The guy who directed Doom is directing the new Street Fighter movie and it's probably going to be just as shitty as the old one.
2576079	2576519	The end.
2579341	2580641	Yeah, I think that about says it.
2580681	2585124	I mean, gosh, there was an awful lot of internet articles about it, but I think Jamie summed it up very well.
2585764	2586204	There you go.
2586644	2586905	Yep.
2587545	2588125	I'm brilliant.
2588365	2594809	I really hope they don't destroy some guy's wonderful movie career and then that guy dies, kind of like Raul Julia.
2594829	2597610	His last movie role was M. Bison, you know?
2598288	2598869	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2622543	2622943	You know what?
2623023	2623944	Forget the story.
2624364	2627325	When I can't talk for an entire night, I get angsty.
2627525	2629346	And that means it's FUs of the Week time.
2638630	2639531	FUs of the Week time.
2639591	2640851	Start off with DarkSakura.
2642472	2643813	FU goes to my sinuses.
2644613	2648915	FU goes to my toilet.
2648955	2650796	We've had this clog in our pipes.
2652282	2661428	What happens is that it makes the toilet back up, or it backs up sewage into our tub.
2663029	2663730	And it sucks.
2665071	2668993	So our landlord came out and was digging around the pipes trying to fix it today.
2669033	2671555	I hope it's fixed by the time we get home.
2673656	2675998	Yes, you can say an F you to a video game company, Eddie.
2676727	2680349	F you to LucasArts for saying, we're considering making a game for the Wii.
2680389	2681329	I'm like, fuck you!
2681390	2683431	I mean, oh my god, this is like the best system ever.
2683751	2688313	And then like, LucasArts is awesome and they need to get out their ass and stop thinking about it and actually make a game for the Wii.
2688693	2689494	So fuck you, LucasArts.
2690334	2693076	I should say, Eddie is an unapologetic Nintendo fanboy, right?
2693796	2694736	Exactly, exactly.
2695177	2698899	Has a Sony or Microsoft product or Sega product that manner ever been in your house?
2699699	2699999	Never.
2701500	2702000	Fanboy.
2702540	2703341	Alright, Loki.
2704541	2706742	Uh, fuck you, the crappy pizza.
2706762	2712044	Especially at John's Incredible Pizza, because it was not incredible, it was incredibly crappy.
2712724	2715545	Although, props to that- It probably gave you incredible diarrhea, too.
2715585	2721807	No, it did not give me incredible diarrhea, but it was just like, it was like, wow, I can tell you spent a lot of money on this.
2721907	2726268	What, there's a whole, like, two pepperonis on this pepperoni pizza they have?
2726368	2727148	I mean, seriously.
2728069	2730389	It's just, it was pretty lame, but, uh, whatever.
2731810	2732110	Whatever.
2734814	2739396	I want to give an F you first off to my voice, because apparently I can't talk at all tonight.
2739436	2740797	It's really ruining the show for me.
2741837	2754382	And then I just want to give an F you to people that start out really nice, like they want to be your best friend in the world, and like, you know, oh, I love you, and da-da-da, and then they turn into a total psycho host beast.
2758241	2759461	I'm not talking about you, Jamie.
2760042	2761142	Although you've done that too.
2761542	2761902	No, no, no.
2761962	2764663	I'm talking about work-related situations.
2764903	2769785	I actually was actually... You said that and I started thinking about somebody.
2770065	2770365	What?
2770385	2772005	I'm not going to say anyone here.
2772285	2772405	Oh.
2774486	2775786	I can probably think about it, yeah.
2777027	2777547	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2777567	2778347	I know who you're talking about.
2778707	2778987	Alright.
2780268	2780708	Haha.
2781628	2783609	OLR rumors you guys will never know about.
2783689	2784529	So that's all I wanted to say.
2784629	2784929	F you too.
2786184	2789927	Anyways, so, EverQuest.
2790027	2791929	Yeah, that wonderful game, EverQuest.
2792770	2797874	EverQuest 1 and 2 have added a brand new card game called Legends of Norath.
2798815	2810325	And, yeah, I guess it's going to be the Oathbound series will feature 375 cards in a 55-card starter deck for $9.99 and 15-card booster packs for $2.99.
2814434	2826079	And the game is playable from EverQuest 1 or 2, although there will be a standalone client due out for free in September, actually this week, on Wednesday.
2827039	2829880	So, I don't know.
2830481	2833302	Just trying to cash in, I guess, on the collectible card games.
2835203	2839685	And EverQuest, it's such a, you know, new product.
2840485	2840765	I don't know.
2841567	2843128	These MMOs last forever.
2843208	2846491	I mean, if you think about it, Final Fantasy XI is five years old, if you can believe it.
2846571	2848013	So these MMOs last forever.
2848373	2848893	They really do.
2851295	2851576	Alright.
2852577	2854878	Anyway, speaking of MMOs online... I have a comment.
2855319	2855539	What?
2855599	2855859	Yes.
2856860	2858061	How old is Final Fantasy?
2858321	2858782	Five years.
2859222	2860964	Just old enough to be raped now.
2862005	2863326	What is wrong with you? !
2864614	2866978	You missed our discussion on neck raping earlier.
2867279	2869061	Really?
2869182	2870364	Thank you for punching him.
2870584	2872768	That's what you get for watching Battlestar Galactica during this show.
2872848	2875672	Now stay quiet until the next year's segment, alright?
2875692	2876394	Fine.
2878004	2879005	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2899822	2901962	and some new storylines are being added into the game.
2901982	2904283	And of course, Myst Online is a part of GameTap.
2904303	2906643	So if you're a GameTap subscriber, you get access to Myst Online.
2906944	2911424	I played Myst Online for like three days, but I found it to be really... Like, I didn't know what the hell I was doing.
2911764	2918386	Like, there needs to be a little more... Like, even though I thought it was cool, they had like live actors that actually did like introductions, initiations.
2918806	2922527	I just wish there had been a little more like, what the fuck do I do with this game?
2922647	2923927	Like, kind of like talk.
2924367	2925387	So, that's all.
2925427	2927728	But otherwise, I thought Myst Online was actually a really good looking game.

2985763	2988144	and the fact that you could hack it to play Nintendo games.
2988204	2989125	Oh, you didn't even really hack it.
2989145	2989705	It would just burn you out.
2989725	2990425	Dreamcast.
2990705	2991466	Dreamcast was cool.
2991706	2992967	And they had a Pepsi Man game.
2993667	2997269	And the Dreamcast love is still out there because there's still a bunch of shit being made for it.
2997529	2997909	Not a bunch.
2997929	2998749	It's still awesome.
2999070	3000090	I love the Dreamcast.

3132691	3134473	All right, now let me explain how this works.
3135574	3137596	Raven's Dolphin, do you know how the video game match game works?
3138911	3145077	I know how to play the match game, and I'm familiar with the rules, yes, but I can go over them like normal, like a dream reaper.
3158288	3158688	DarkSakura,
3187506	3188086	and Loki.
3188426	3188847	Hello.
3189487	3192268	And you haven't heard her yet tonight, but she is here, folks.
3192728	3195690	Rice Princess, our surprise lady tonight.

3197371	3197711	All right.
3197911	3198991	Raven's Dolphin's excited.
3199231	3200192	Are you a fan of Rice Princess?
3200212	3200732	I like Rice Princess.
3201172	3201472	All right.
3202793	3203733	That was a little creepy.
3203754	3205294	You might want to get a restraining order.
3205914	3207675	Get one of those nanny cams in your house.
3207755	3209096	Make sure no one comes in.
3209456	3209756	All right.
3210797	3211537	Are you guys ready?
3211597	3215439	Let's get some music because it's time to play the match game.
3219355	3220116	I love this theme song.
3220136	3221436	It's one of the best theme songs ever made.
3221976	3222557	Yes, it is.
3222597	3223157	It's fantastic.
3223177	3224197	All right, here we go.
3224217	3225538	Are you ready for question number one?
3225558	3227359	I'll try.
3227579	3232541	GS68, you're going to send us your answer over private message, okay?
3232681	3236362	And Raven Stolfen, you get to... Verbally say it.
3236402	3238343	Verbally say it, but not until I say when, okay?
3238883	3240404	You have to vocalize your reply.
3240444	3241124	Yes, here it is.
3241204	3243025	Here's the first question tonight, folks.
3243994	3249677	Rob is very excited about the Heroes Season premiere happening in a couple of weeks.
3250557	3254699	He's blocked the time on his calendar, paid the cable bill for this month.
3255539	3259981	All he has to do to be completely ready is go out and buy a blank.
3261862	3265684	That's right, Rob is very excited about the Heroes Season premiere happening in a couple of weeks.
3266044	3269345	He's blocked the time on the calendar, paid the cable bill for this month.
3269745	3273267	All he has to do to be completely ready is go out and buy a blank.
3275017	3275737	Thank you for watching!
3305658	3306759	because you asked for it.
3308060	3308480	Lordy.
3308820	3309000	All right.
3309020	3310321	Does everybody have their answer in their mind?
3310341	3311622	Do you have a new answer in your mind?
3311923	3312683	I think of one.
3312843	3314064	And say ding when you thought of one.
3314645	3314905	All right.
3314925	3315325	He's thought of one.
3315345	3315525	Good.
3315625	3315865	All right.
3315885	3316246	Here we go.
3316266	3317346	Let me see.
3317366	3318727	Make sure GS68 has an answer.
3318767	3318928	Okay.
3318948	3319328	There you go.
3319728	3322330	And Raven's Dolphin, do you have an answer?
3322830	3323231	Tyvo.
3324111	3324331	Okay.
3324371	3326953	Raven's Dolphin says Tevo or Tyvo.
3327274	3327634	Okay.
3328194	3328554	Tybo?
3328595	3329035	Tybo?
3329465	3330246	It's a TiVo.
3330426	3330946	All right, here we go.
3331006	3333809	All he has to do to be completely ready is to go out and buy a TiVo.
3334049	3335690	That's what Raven's Dolphin says.
3335970	3340474	And GS68 says all he has to do is go out and buy an HD Porn.
3341475	3342155	HD Porn.
3342656	3343697	All right, let's see what happens.
3343777	3346019	Let's go around and see if any of the celebrities have matched.
3346079	3346859	Loki, what did you get?
3349662	3352684	Funny enough, I was going to say Pleasure Glove, but...
3357540	3357960	Was that it?
3358180	3358581	Yeah.
3358681	3358981	Oh, okay.
3359001	3359642	Pleasure Club.
3359662	3360082	There you go.
3360102	3361243	I was like, where's the punchline?
3361723	3361903	All right.
3362303	3362624	I forgot.
3362664	3363164	He's not funny.
3363464	3365346	DarkSakura, what did you say?
3365946	3367647	A life-size standee of George Takei.
3368127	3370549	A life-size... That's a good answer.
3370609	3372731	I love George Takei, but not a match.
3373011	3379656	I haven't really watched any except for when they took the sword, but I know that George Takei is in it, and he's awesome.
3379736	3380336	He is awesome.
3380696	3381397	That was a good answer.
3382097	3387141	My answer would be he forgot to go out and buy a blow-up Siler doll.
3387642	3388963	because Siler is gorgeous.
3389844	3391445	What, with extra brain-eating action?
3392105	3394868	Yes, because Siler is so hot.
3394948	3396108	Okay, Shane, what did you say?
3397309	3399471	He needs to go out and buy... A bottle of lube.
3399831	3401192	A bottle of lube.
3401753	3402333	Not a match.
3402413	3408578	All right, Eddie, he needs to go out and buy a... Copy of George Takei's movie, Blowed Up.
3408778	3409579	Oh, my.
3411580	3411860	Wow.
3412241	3416344	All right, Rice Princess says he needs to go out and buy...
3417168	3418588	I just stuck with the requisite.
3418648	3419768	Prostitute.
3420009	3421429	Prostitute.
3422329	3422729	All right.
3422829	3424929	So let's add it up and look at the scoreboard.
3425089	3425429	Ah, yes.
3425930	3426150	It is.
3426790	3427050	Oops.
3427410	3427750	No.
3430290	3432171	And we've been canceled, ladies and gentlemen.
3432611	3433511	The show's over.
3433551	3434071	Good night.
3434751	3435411	What did I do?
3436971	3439472	Maybe I went too far with the prostitute comment.
3441652	3443673	This show is so broken tonight.
3443733	3444673	I want a refund.
3445533	3445813	All right.
3446533	3447334	Just like my Xbox.
3447374	3451136	Yes, going back to the scoreboard, it is 0-0.
3451536	3452036	Look at that.
3452116	3454018	All right, good job.
3454038	3454638	0-0.
3454678	3456699	All right, shall we go to the next question?
3457360	3457560	Yes.
3457800	3460421	Are you going to make a better effort this time, Raven's Dolphin?
3461002	3461582	I'm trying.
3461822	3462723	I know you're trying your best.
3462763	3463263	I appreciate it.
3463283	3464524	Okay, here's question number two.
3465144	3465925	Question number two.
3466885	3471228	Loki went out to the arcades today to try out some of the new games in town.
3472105	3477348	When he drove up to Roseville Golf Land to find that they were closed though, he was very upset.
3478188	3482830	He was inspired, however, to make an awesome new video game called Blank.
3489974	3493236	Loki went out to the arcades today to try out some of the new games in town.
3493856	3497378	When he drove up to Roseville Golf Land to find out they were closed though, he was very upset.
3497698	3501600	He was inspired, however, to make an awesome new video game called Blank.
3503598	3503898	Ding.
3505199	3505739	Double ding.
3506639	3507059	Ding.
3507079	3513201	Okay, everybody in studio has said ding.
3513801	3514401	How are you doing?
3514701	3515642	Do you have an answer yet?
3515682	3517442	Don't say it yet, but do you have an answer yet, Raven's Dolphin?
3518523	3520183	No, but give me just two more seconds.
3520223	3522584	I'm trying to think of a new thing.
3522604	3522744	One, two.
3522784	3523104	All right.
3524184	3525245	All right, two seconds are up.
3525265	3526345	GS68 has an answer.
3526365	3526945	Do you have an answer?
3528266	3528586	Yeah.
3528606	3529206	All right, here we go.
3529246	3531487	He invented... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3531547	3532067	Don't say it yet.
3532691	3533611	We're not ready for it yet.
3533932	3535753	I have to read the question and ask you for your answer.
3535793	3535933	Shh.
3536673	3538214	Can I have some silence in the studio, please?
3538834	3540195	Silence.
3540615	3543516	Loki went out to the arcades today to try some of the new games in town.
3543556	3546778	When he drove up to Rosso Golf Land to find out they were closed, though, he was very upset.
3547098	3550320	He was inspired, however, to make an awesome new video game called Raven's Dolphin.
3551843	3553943	He called Drunken Cart Racer.
3554324	3555844	Drunken Cart Racer.
3555984	3557744	Okay, good show reference.
3557944	3560545	Thinking back to the last time Loki was at Rosal Goblin.
3561005	3566286	All right, GS68 said, Beat Mania 2DX16, George Takai.
3566306	3569267	This is the game that's going to be made.
3569327	3569867	So there you go.
3570287	3571407	All right, let's see what happens.
3572007	3574388	Loki, he's going to make a game called...
3575777	3577218	Mini Golf Course Tycoon.
3577738	3579278	Mini Golf Course Tycoon.
3579298	3580279	That's a fun game.
3580339	3585481	So I too can suck at running a mini golf course just like Golf Land.
3585541	3588402	All right, DarkSakura, he's going to make a game called?
3588502	3591203	Because it's Loki, I said Iraqi Suicide Baby Bombers.
3591643	3595544	Iraqi Suicide Baby Bombers, a reference to 200 episodes ago.
3596124	3603587	All right, my answer is, and you have to know what Roseville Golf Land looks like for this to make sense, but I was going to call it Castle Crashers 2.
3605029	3607131	Blizzerclaw Battle!
3607171	3608372	Oh my...
3634008	3635069	and Rice Princess.
3635130	3644901	The game is called... Yeah, I didn't have any ideas so I'm just going to stick to Cylon Occupied Caprica.
3645061	3647224	Cylon Occupied Caprica.
3647384	3647985	Occupried?
3648766	3650488	Occupied Caprica.
3653643	3654544	All right, there it is.
3655264	3657764	All right, let's go to the scoreboard and take a look.
3658244	3660485	Oh, okay, we have zero to zero.
3660805	3661645	Good job.
3661785	3666266	Oh, Rob, let's be nice and give them something each equally worthless.
3666786	3667026	All right.
3667106	3675527	Like, you know, a Fairchild Channel F for GS68 and an N-Gage for... A fart in a Ziploc bag.
3675647	3676907	Why would I want an N-Gage?
3677888	3678748	All right.
3679048	3680648	An N-Gage with no SIM card.
3682017	3682957	I got a SIM card.
3683077	3684798	What's the difference?
3685438	3686198	One more question.
3688178	3688378	What?
3688659	3689879	Yes, we have one more question.
3690019	3696120	Now, I hope somebody gets on the scoreboard or everybody loses, which is a familiar theme here for the video game match game.
3696440	3699141	All right, here it is, our last question for tonight.
3700361	3705062	Jamie borrowed Dan's camera for the awesome OLR photo shoot today.
3705982	3713347	What Dan doesn't know, however, is that after the show is over, Jamie will be using the camera to take some pictures of Blank.
3715968	3716288	Um, ding.
3716308	3718030	Have a mutual ding.
3734028	3737269	Alright, I think everybody in studio has mostly said ding.
3738529	3740629	Okay, GS68 has dinged.
3741029	3742750	Have you dinged too, Raven's Dolphin?
3743730	3744270	I'm dinging.
3744670	3745450	Alright, grats.
3745790	3747670	Alright, here we go.
3748391	3748871	Let's see.
3749531	3751291	Let's go to Raven's Dolphin, you first for an answer.
3751331	3751991	Here's the question.
3752311	3756052	Jamie borrowed Dan's camera for the awesome OLR photo shoot today.
3756472	3761773	What Dan doesn't know, however, is that after the show is over, Jamie will be using the camera to take some pictures of...
3763506	3786350	Doctor Who Nude Doctor Who Nude Okay, good answer, good answer Especially if you know Jamie And GS68 said, taking some pictures of Ferret Porn Ferret Porn Alright, let's see if there's a match with anybody in studio Let's go around, start it off with Loki Take some pictures of This goes back to, I think part B still Neck Raping
3787529	3790312	Neck raping, unfortunately, is not a match.
3790772	3792214	DarkSakura, take some pictures of?
3792234	3793295	I actually said the doctor.
3794035	3795477	The doctor, is that a match?
3796458	3798039	Well, he's nude under his clothing.
3798419	3800662	All right, we'll give Raven's Dolphin half a point.
3801162	3802944	Half a point for Raven's Dolphin.
3802964	3803664	Congratulations.
3803684	3803945	All right.
3805306	3811552	My answer was she's going to take some pictures of naked high school musical stars.
3812327	3813388	I saw it I saw it I saw it
3837188	3837408	All right.
3837728	3840249	Anyway, can we please get the rest of the answers?
3840649	3842590	Miklatov, Jamie's going to take some pictures of?
3843030	3844411	A bottle of lube.
3844611	3848553	A bottle of lube, which is not a match nor a very creative answer.
3848973	3851234	It was creative the first time I said it.
3851634	3852074	And you know what?
3852094	3852994	I said it every time.
3853015	3854335	A joke that was funny one time.
3854355	3856556	They could have got a point if they would have been paying attention.
3856576	3856756	Shh.
3856896	3857576	Just stop.
3857616	3857736	Shh.
3858137	3858377	No.
3859357	3859537	Eddie.
3859757	3860458	Shh.
3861078	3861198	It.
3861758	3862018	Eddie.
3863219	3863779	Answer is?
3865405	3868546	Rob and George Takei playing Pleasure Glove Battle together.
3869066	3869946	Oh my.
3869966	3872767	So he's officially Charles Nelson Reilly?
3873587	3875047	No, it's not Charles Nelson Reilly.
3875087	3875467	He's dead.
3877388	3883549	Rice Princess taking pictures of... The train wreck that is this show.
3883749	3885870	The train wreck that is this show.
3886310	3889791	Although it clearly said in the question, after the show is over...
3890518	3893820	Let's hear it for Rice Princess, the genius of Orange Love Radio.
3893840	3894000	Yay!
3894020	3894180	Woo!
3894320	3895240	I rock!
3895460	3897521	Because we can't keep doing the show after the show is over.
3898222	3898602	All right.
3899722	3901983	Let's go to the scoreboard and take a look.
3903604	3907526	Oh, I see we have GS68, and the game was zero points.
3908046	3908686	Good job, GS68.
3908706	3909106	A for effort.
3911189	3917896	But our winner today, with half a point, Raven's Dolphin is our winner!
3918517	3920399	Raven's Dolphin, what do you want to surprise?
3921760	3923202	I don't know, maybe a callback?
3924243	3926645	Alright, as your prize tonight, we will call you back.
3927566	3927966	Yay!
3928087	3929328	But in the meantime, we hang up on you.
3929915	3934640	All right, so we'll hear from Raven's Dolphin later in the program, but after we do some news.
3935300	3938163	So let's get back into some gaming news, which we actually don't have much of.
3938464	3939905	Bye, thanks for being on the show, celebrities.
3940466	3943008	Go watch your Galaxy Galactica with the Krylon.
3943068	3944970	Even if you were below average tonight.
3945431	3948053	All right, I give you guys a D minus.
3948514	3950115	No, a D plus.
3950275	3950996	No, that was awesome.
3951296	3953799	All right, Eddie, you get an A. We were good stuff, exactly.
3954229	3956851	Well, unfortunately I have a little bit of bad news.
3958152	3961415	There is no Crackdown sequel in development right now.
3962055	3970162	And the reason being is that Microsoft was a little late to ask them to actually make a sequel.
3970282	3976267	So now they're working on a new MMO called All Points Bulletin or APV.
3976387	3980250	It's going to be a MMO coming out in 2009.
3982714	3983515	So that sucks.
3983655	3983995	You know what?
3984015	3985596	Real Time Worlds isn't making a sequel.
3985656	3986116	Hold on.
3986376	3987958	Is that really such a bad thing?
3988398	3989358	I mean, think about it for a minute.
3989419	3990739	I know you guys all love Crackdown.
3990779	3992000	I'm not saying anything against Crackdown.
3992040	3992360	No, no, no.
3992400	3992861	Hold on, though.
3993581	3997084	I mean, what is the number one bitch people have about the gaming industry?
3997144	3997624	Long time fans.
3997664	3998885	They're not original enough.
3998925	4001787	A lot of the things you see out there are just sequels to other stuff.
4002207	4005129	So shouldn't we kind of support a company that says, you know what?
4005289	4006650	We don't really want to make a sequel right now.
4006990	4007931	Is that really such a bad thing?
4007951	4009632	Well, it wasn't that they don't want to make a sequel.
4009672	4010593	They wanted to make a sequel.
4010613	4012534	It's just that they didn't approach them for a sequel.
4013681	4013781	Oh.
4015562	4017943	Well, then they suck, and they can go die in a boat fire.
4019603	4020043	Right, Jamie?
4022284	4022544	Yes.
4023004	4023304	All right.
4025185	4025445	All right.
4026405	4031047	That's it for the gaming news tonight until we get to last-minute stories, but that means it's time for the Skype line.
4031087	4037369	Yes, we're going to open up our Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
4037729	4042511	But of course, since we promised Raven's Dolphin as his prize, we will now call him back.
4043243	4047346	So we have hit the dial button on Raven Stauffen's name, and we're waiting to connect.
4047646	4050408	Do you want to hear something creepy?
4050548	4051469	I think we got voicemail.
4051489	4054350	You have reached Tekken Game Podcast messaging line.
4054951	4057613	Voicemail, please leave a message after the beep.
4057833	4062476	Please eliminate all or most background noise.
4062636	4064998	Keep it under a minute or 30 seconds.
4065018	4065658	That's fine.
4065678	4066118	Here we go.
4071854	4073694	Raven's Dolphin, this message is for you.
4073794	4077295	We are calling you back as promised, but you're not there.
4079116	4080096	Sucks to be you.
4080576	4081416	Hugs and kisses.
4082357	4082937	All right, it's over.
4083537	4087838	All right, so let's go to the phones and see who calls us.
4087938	4090219	Again, our username is Orange Launch Radio on Skype.
4090539	4093760	Phone number 1-877-GAME-OLR.
4094060	4095361	Oh, look who's calling us back.
4095761	4097261	Do you want your own show or something?
4097921	4098242	No.
4098402	4099542	All right, what do you want, Raven's Dolphin?
4100285	4102766	I forgot to tell you that I fail at computers.
4103887	4104327	Yes, you do.
4104427	4105027	Congratulations.
4105047	4105768	Alright, real quickly.
4105808	4106768	You've had too much show time.
4107028	4108169	What's your question tonight for us?
4109069	4110030	My Xbox died.
4110150	4110490	That's it.
4111210	4112351	That's not a fucking question.
4112411	4113171	That's not a question.
4114472	4116073	No, I just want to tell you that I'm sad.
4116633	4116733	Oh.
4117373	4117754	I'm sorry.
4117794	4118414	Here's the Kleenex.
4119014	4124957	Alright, if you want to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username is Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
4127816	4129978	Meanwhile, I'm looking at chat comments.
4130018	4131780	There hasn't been a lot of chat comments tonight I've read.
4132040	4132621	I apologize.
4133561	4136064	Velerno, I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing your name.
4136104	4136805	I'm not sure how to say that.
4136865	4142690	Velerno says, I wanted a Crackdown sequel and puts those dejected little three dots right after that comment there.
4142810	4144011	So sorry about that.
4145112	4145333	All right.
4145413	4146574	We got some more calls, though.
4146614	4147354	Let's go to the calls.
4147655	4148716	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4148756	4149136	Who's this?
4150177	4150457	Hey, guys.
4150477	4151218	This is FootyMonster.
4151378	4152479	Hello, FootyMonster.
4152519	4152940	How are you?
4153957	4154737	I think it's just fine.
4154797	4155398	What about you guys?
4169380	4170481	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4191832	4197096	Like, I don't know, maybe during a certain upcoming expo we can give you more information.
4197196	4199298	Not that I know anything, or don't, but that's it.
4199658	4201179	FootyMonster, what do you have for our listeners tonight?
4201899	4217571	Well, basically I just wanted to share with you guys, I don't know if it's a review or something, but Persona 3, which is this new game for the PS2, it's an RPG, and I just wanted to let everyone know, because it's probably underrated and under the radar, it's from the Shin Megami Tensei universe.
4217611	4220153	If anyone ever played one of those games, like Nocturne,
4220892	4248762	Digital Devil Saga, Nocturne was the game in which Dante from Devil May Cry made a cameo and stuff so it was known back in the day in the PS2 and Persona 3 came out and it was really really really good and I've been playing it I put like 40 hours into it I'm not even halfway done it's deep as hell and it's really good I don't know if you guys have heard anything about it or you know what's funny I'm holding here in my hand the Persona 3 trade demo we got sent from Atlas and I have to admit I have not played it still
4249335	4249995	Shame on you, Rob.
4250135	4251916	Alright, I'll give it to Jamie to play.
4252936	4257338	I swear I was going to play it, but then I went back to Final Fantasy XI because that's stupid.
4257358	4259379	Have you played Overlord yet?
4260299	4260479	No.
4261660	4262120	But I will.
4265681	4268623	What makes this game so great compared to the Final Fantasies of the world?
4268823	4270943	You know, most people say, what's the greatest role-playing game of all time?
4271224	4275625	People will say Dragon Quest or they'll say Final Fantasy VII.
4275685	4277066	Why is it so great?
4277106	4277306	Well,
4277932	4278912	Thank you for watching!
4307631	4309052	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4331792	4332693	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4355006	4356047	Thank you for watching!
4380376	4380716	You win.
4381536	4385578	I mean, on the show, a couple weeks ago, we did review the whole thing in length.
4385598	4388559	I spent like 20 minutes talking about it because it's really, really that good.
4389199	4389700	Very cool.
4389800	4393921	Well, so you can go ahead and plug your show real quick so they know where to go download that if they want.
4394921	4395202	All right.
4395242	4397102	So it's ultimatequest.net.
4397322	4400964	It's a show that I did with Shadow Slayer, Jack Ransom, and Xenocore.
4401564	4404305	And I believe that was episode 21, I want to say, or 22.
4404365	4406806	I forgot right now because it was a couple of weeks ago.
4407774	4409175	Oh, and I said I'd come on the show.
4409255	4412077	I sent a reply message back because I didn't see an email for like a week.
4412097	4419801	But any of us will – I'm sure if you can work in the time with any of us, we'll all come on at some point and talk nerdy role-playing games.
4419822	4427846	Yeah, I know that Sinogor talked with you about maybe you doing – we have this little thing called the Ultimate Side Quest, which is a show that we do on and off, sometimes like once a month.
4428327	4436772	And it's like a discussion that's not just about the news but about like maybe a topic, like let's say tabletop RPG gaming and how it would make RPGs in the consoles better.
4437729	4439810	That was the topic of the latest one.
4439970	4442491	You'll have to get Jamie for that one because I don't do a lot of tabletop.
4443692	4445512	I haven't been doing any in the past month.
4445532	4447753	I was playing D&D.
4449034	4449394	Very cool.
4450205	4453447	All right, well, Footy, thanks so much for the input and for the game suggestions.
4453467	4456649	You've been full of game suggestions lately, from the Hannah Montana DS to this.
4457209	4459791	I got to spread the Hannah Montana love.
4459891	4460391	It's awesome.
4460471	4463713	You better be calling back in a couple weeks and telling us about the next game we all need to be playing.
4463953	4464854	Oh, that reminds me.
4464934	4466615	Loki, do not buy jam sessions.
4466655	4467835	I have the Japanese version.
4468056	4468816	It's not good.
4469296	4469957	It's not good.
4471398	4472438	It's cheap, though.
4473539	4474339	It really is.
4474479	4475360	Loki likes cheap.
4476460	4479005	I'm not buying Hannah Montana, I can tell you that much.
4480328	4481410	I will buy Hannah Montana.
4482372	4483274	Alright, you do that.
4483454	4485037	Alright, bye footy monster, thanks for the call.
4485077	4485799	Talk to you later guys.
4486465	4486645	GS68 GS68
4514284	4517745	Someone sent an email complaining that Heavenly Sword was too short, right?
4518045	4518345	Mm-hmm.
4519645	4524906	Well, when I was younger, games took less than an hour to complete and had no save points.
4526546	4529887	So, people are saying that Heavenly Sword is too short of a game.
4531067	4531928	Yeah, ten hours.
4533368	4534828	Ten hours isn't that short.
4534988	4538349	Ten hours is about how long it took to beat Silent Hill 2, and that's a beautiful game.
4538969	4539129	So...
4540857	4545260	I don't think it's such a bad thing that the games are necessarily short, as long as it's fun.
4545280	4549202	You're right, a lot of those old school NES games, they were really good.
4549222	4552004	God, I could probably beat Super Mario Bros.
4552925	4554085	in 15 minutes, if that.
4554305	4559348	Yeah, or Mario 2, I just got that on Virtual Console, and that's like a 15 minute game if you know all the power-ups and stuff.
4559368	4562570	But it's part of the, is it fun to replay over and over again?
4562590	4564291	Because a game like Super Mario Bros.
4564311	4565992	2, hell yeah, it's fun to play over and over again.
4566072	4567073	Super Mario Bros.
4567682	4568443	It's really short.
4568523	4573227	I mean, you can beat it in under two hours, and there are people who play it over and over again.
4574167	4574407	Yeah.
4574828	4586657	So, hey, you know, a game is all about fun, you know, but considering how much they're charging for these games, if it is only a ten-hour game, it better be a really fun ten-hour game, like six bucks an hour good.
4587058	4591621	But if you think about it, I mean, hell, they charge ten dollars for an hour-and-a-half movie, so why not?
4592982	4593243	Yeah.
4593443	4593623	So.
4594944	4596886	Now, are you buying Heavenly Sword, Loki?
4597286	4597366	Uh,
4598007	4598327	Maybe.
4598627	4600249	Are you buying it, GS68?
4600309	4601930	Uh, no.
4602830	4604852	I don't really have much interest in games like those.
4605632	4608594	I'll probably give it a rent since I can rent for free.
4610635	4611016	There you go.
4611376	4613037	Here's one of those rent-before-you-buy things.
4613377	4616399	Maybe you'll rent it and beat it and then wonder, do I want to play this again?
4616439	4617720	What money is it out of my pocket?
4619161	4619421	Alright.
4620342	4621803	If it's free, I'll do almost anything.
4622769	4624210	Tiger Claw has an interesting point.
4624310	4629953	I hate games that force you to play on a hard difficulty just to see the better ending.
4630333	4637516	If it's normal, then I don't mind because, in my opinion, if you use easy difficulty, you're a pussy.
4638037	4641718	But I don't really do hard mode a lot on games.
4643959	4648502	There was a Star Wars game on N64 that you couldn't even see the ending unless you got to the ending and it's all.
4648522	4650863	To see the ending played in hard mode, I was like, fuck you.
4651678	4652502	Here's the thing, though.
4652522	4652923	That wasn't...
4655023	4658506	Oh shoot, now I'm... It was like the only Star Wars... No, it was other than Rogue Squadron.
4658546	4660567	Other than Rogue Squadron was the only... Yeah, the one that wasn't Rogue Squadron.
4660647	4663949	It was the one where you play the... The Ren'ei guy, yeah.
4664410	4665010	I have that game.
4665431	4666011	Here's the thing, though.
4666151	4668833	I think those subtle ending differences are pretty cool.
4668893	4671375	I go back all the way to the original Metroid.
4672596	4677299	When you played it the first time, it probably took you forever and a day to actually beat it, and so you got the crappy ending.
4677559	4683664	But then somebody at school tells you, hey, if you play it really fast, then you get to see the chick take all her clothes off.
4686768	4693032	Which is people kind of stretching the truth a little bit, but who didn't run home and play through the game just as fast as they could to see if there was that other ending in it?
4693072	4693672	I know I did.
4693912	4696333	Well, it was... There you go, see?
4697154	4707880	I couldn't get under three hours in Super Metroid, not just because of, you know... Or even the games with all the different multiple endings, if you did things a different way or did it the harder way, like Chrono Trigger.
4708883	4715344	You know, you start off, if you do save game plus and start off and just beat Lavos right away, you get the developer ending.
4716264	4717024	And that was pretty cool.
4717645	4718845	Yeah, stuff like that's really cool.
4722625	4724086	So did Airspace, apparently.
4724546	4726126	Sorry, I was reading stuff.
4726226	4729087	So, okay, so anyway, anything else you want to share with our listeners, GS68?
4729207	4733647	Yeah, I finally got around to playing 3DX Distorted on PS2.
4734247	4734828	And, what'd you think?
4736068	4736748	It's pretty good.
4736768	4736968	I've
4738085	4750608	I haven't played any, well, I don't have any 2DX between 9th and 13th style, so there's a lot of features that are new to me, like all the score data from the arcade and such.
4751868	4755469	Yeah, I haven't bought a 2DX game since 9th style either, but I did play a lot of Red.
4756269	4757389	I don't know, we'll see.
4757669	4760550	I'm kind of over a lot of those Konami music games, I have to admit.
4760590	4762670	It's the same fucking thing for like five years now.
4763191	4765572	So it's... I'm ready for something new.
4765852	4768234	So when Konami's ready to give me something new, I'll go back.
4769094	4772016	Or, you know, I do still buy, like, the new DDR games on consoles.
4772056	4776258	Like, because, you know, Universe and the Xbox DDRs have felt really new to me.
4776798	4782381	And, hell, I still think, what is it, Ultramix 2 is, like, the best DDR game they've put out in any country on a console.
4782781	4785443	I got tired of playing DDR at home.
4786043	4786283	Yeah.
4786943	4787564	It's not the same.
4787964	4788404	I'll give you that.
4788945	4790585	All right, well, GS68, thanks so much for the call.
4790605	4791366	We appreciate it, okay?
4792150	4792390	All right.
4792730	4793070	Later, buddy.
4794511	4794771	All right.
4795051	4796992	That's actually going to do it tonight for the Skype line.
4797092	4800273	We're actually running way over tonight thanks to all the craziness.
4800673	4803674	So we're actually going to wrap things up with some last minute stories.
4803774	4805355	Does anybody have some quick last minute stories?
4806055	4809216	I have some things I forgot to mention during the release dates.
4809496	4813538	There's a game that apparently was coming out on PC called 30,000 Games.
4814778	4816819	I don't know what it is, but I know there's 30,000 of them.
4816839	4819400	And I say for $19.99, that's a pretty damn good deal.
4822928	4823309	Anyways.
4823949	4824389	Oops.
4825390	4826711	Sorry, I wasn't ready for that yet.
4827132	4827512	My bad.
4828253	4828933	Okie dokie.
4829554	4831656	I've been having all sorts of sound boo-boos tonight.
4833577	4834058	Anyways.
4835119	4839342	One thing I was going to mention, South Park did win the Emmy for World of Warcraft episodes.
4840223	4842045	This is actually Loki's new theme music.
4842065	4843926	Okay.
4850357	4853780	That, by the way, was Super Mario RPG in Mario Paint.
4854220	4854781	That's what that was.
4855041	4858063	Sega's game, The Club, will not be out for Christmas, by the way.
4859184	4860605	It's going to be out early 2008 for PC, PS3, and Xbox 360.
4864328	4867270	This is perfect for what we've been talking about.
4868130	4874613	Anyways, apparently there's some, you can buy unicorns in Second Life.
4875053	4880416	There's just one teensy little, small little issue that they forgot to mention.
4880676	4890961	In order to obtain a unicorn, you have to have sex with an adult unicorn in Second Life.
4890981	4891221	Yay!
4897290	4898211	It's Super Mario RPG.
4921550	4922870	but they come with a price.
4923070	4929411	You can only get them by having sex with an adult unicorn located at the Bell Highland Sim.
4930191	4932112	Deal or no deal?
4933052	4934892	How many unicorns get a baby?
4935192	4942294	Apparently there's a website here that has not... Oh, yeah, that's interesting.
4942514	4945034	Oh, no.
4945834	4948535	That's special.
4948695	4949595	Where's the baby unicorn?
4950835	4950955	Um...
4951772	4953532	That's just... Does it really matter?
4955193	4955673	I don't know.
4955973	4957694	There's some weird shit on this website.
4957714	4961975	Like, why is... I don't even know what that is, but some sort of insect having sex with somebody.
4962775	4964095	God, Second Life is awesome.
4965315	4966696	And by awesome, you mean scary.
4967036	4967336	Yes.
4967996	4969477	Anything else for Last Minute Stories tonight?
4970397	4973698	Sell everything and get a Wii.
4973718	4974618	Try First Life.
4974998	4975678	It's great.
4976598	4977199	Loki, you done?
4978559	4978619	Um...
4979721	4985485	There's some cool Office Depot, I guess, bundle for the Xbox 360 for $2.99.
4985926	4988648	You get the premium system, so that might be worth it.
4988868	4989228	I don't know.
4990249	4990609	Woo!
4992130	4992391	All right.
4992711	4994012	That's it.
4994552	4994832	All right.
4995373	4998415	Well, that is going to do it tonight for Orange Lounge Radio, you guys.
4998435	5003419	I want to thank everybody for tuning in to and listening to Orange Lounge Radio tonight and supporting independent radio.
5003799	5005040	We really appreciate it, you guys.
5005060	5005741	You guys are awesome.
5006001	5006581	And by the way...
5008416	5009836	I want my voice back for next week.
5026542	5027003	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5046444	5051626	does an outstanding job of being an intelligent, intricate look into what's reasonably current in video games.
5051686	5066472	As one of the foremost independent video game podcasts, OLR, hosted by Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki, continues to entertain with its rants, the always low-key but questionable input by frequent guest Shane, and more importantly, its attention to audience through the live chat during the show's Sunday night airing in the mailbag.
5066952	5069633	The hosts are wonderfully funny without setting out to create comedy.
5069953	5072714	Sometimes it just works best when the show breaks down and laughter...
5073911	5075092	Hope you like tonight's show.
5077514	5080877	Due to some bizarrely inappropriate comment, usually from Shane.
5081838	5082418	Go figure.
5083159	5085241	Highly recommended to video game fans of all ages.
5085361	5087943	Okay, make that relatively mature audiences, but still.
5088203	5089865	So thank you, Robert H.M., for that review.
5089945	5093708	And all the people who've left happy, fun reviews on iTunes.
5094664	5100987	like Mac Man I see here, Mayo Nation, even though I hate mayonnaise, AJ Twist, Flaming, sure, your name got cut off.
5101007	5102008	Read some of the bad reviews.
5102208	5103388	And Blue Collar Murder.
5103748	5104769	You want to hear a bad review?
5105149	5107350	No, because that will encourage people to write bad reviews.
5107390	5109011	I don't want to write bad reviews.
5109671	5113193	No, if you wrote a bad review, then you don't get any attention on our program.
5113233	5113493	Sorry.
5114993	5115253	All right.
5116094	5116554	That's that.
5116994	5118575	So thank you guys very much for that.
5118923	5120865	and let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
5121946	5127730	Eddie, thank you for being here tonight and sticking with us through the whole show and staying away from Gattlestar Balactica during the program.
5127750	5128991	Do you have any final thoughts?
5130172	5131553	Nice and fancy.
5132014	5132414	Indeed.
5133455	5135236	DarkSakura, do you have any final thoughts tonight?
5137258	5138219	I actually have one other.
5138719	5138919	What?
5140040	5142482	Meh.
5142622	5147306	My final thought will be reject false icons and give me a dollar.
5149332	5152293	Tonight's final thought was just stolen from all of Jamie's past stuff.
5152714	5153674	Loki, your final thought.
5154054	5157456	My final thought in this... I forgot to mention this during FQs of the Week.
5158016	5163119	Comcast, for some reason, I don't know if you've noticed this, Rob, or if it's even an issue with your TV.
5163459	5167141	For some reason now, all the HD channels I get are not widescreen.
5167781	5169622	They're all, like, boxed.
5169902	5170822	Like, really small.
5171023	5171483	Mine are fine.
5172083	5174164	It's weird, because, like, it just started doing that now.
5174564	5175044	And I don't know...
5179571	5180851	I say beat them up.
5181552	5183112	I say I'm switching to something else.
5183172	5183372	All right.
5183412	5184012	There you go.
5184473	5187653	That's what more people need to do because Comcast has been pissing me off a lot lately too.
5187713	5190114	Not because of that but just their general service in general.
5190534	5190794	All right.
5192255	5195996	But we do love Comcast because that is the internet that gets us out to you guys.
5196256	5197416	So thanks for that, Comcast.
5198137	5198377	All right.
5198417	5200377	Anyhow, that's it for this week's show.
5200437	5203318	Thank you once again for downloading and supporting Independent Radio.
5203338	5204419	We couldn't do it without you guys.
5204819	5206459	Hey, why don't we do it all again next week?
5206519	5206999	Sound good?
5208540	5209040	Yeah.
5210943	5213505	Until then, have a meh week and we'll see you next time.
