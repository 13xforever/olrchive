15000	19500	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19500	26400	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. This is part B of our podcast, taped live on September 9th, 2007.
26400	31300	And a lot of you guys have been giving us some feedback in our forums lately on orangeloungeradio.com
31300	36100	on our forums that you guys want to see part B of the podcast a little bit sooner than you're seeing it today.
36100	40800	So you will get the part B of our podcast a little bit sooner.
40800	46400	Very soon we're going to change the order in which, well not the order, but the speed first.
46400	50900	Yeah, you're not going to get part B first, but we'll change the speed in which we get the podcast out to you guys very soon.
50900	56100	And we're going to be making some changes with episode 250, which is coming up very soon if you can believe it.
56100	59100	Yikes. It's very, very soon.
59100	63000	Alright. So, let's get back into some gaming news, shall we?
63000	67100	Alright. We shall. So some interesting trademarks
67100	72900	were made from Nintendo, and of course some things people wondering what they are,
72900	78000	including a Wii body controller, which people are thinking is just the balance
78000	81300	board or whatever it was called before because it wasn't the final name.
81300	88300	Another one Wii handle, which could possibly be either a new controller or possibly something that has to do with, you know,
88300	90800	your online name or something like that.
90800	96900	Nintendo Magic, which unfortunately is going to be a DS game.
96900	99100	It's to teach you how to do magic.
99100	105100	And Mii Audition, which is supposed to be that everybody votes channel for, you know, your Miis.
105100	109600	And then, that's it.
109600	113900	So, also they renewed the Peekman trademark.
113900	116500	So, maybe we'll see a new Peekman game for the Wii.
116500	120500	And, yeah. So, that's it.
120500	125600	I thought Nintendo Magic is what it's going to take for them to do some more online gaming.
125600	127100	Some magic.
127100	131700	No, actually the game already came out in Japan and it's coming out over here in November.
131700	135900	So, it's like a teaching you magic game.
135900	137900	Alright. Very cool.
137900	143300	Well, there's actually a lot of third-party stuff going on with the Nintendo Wii.
143300	148700	And this, of course, is if you want to listen to what Satoru Iwata, the president of Nintendo, has to say.
148700	153100	Quote, I believe that third-party publishers kind of look at the software titles that are being sold on Nintendo.
153100	155600	They don't want Nintendo to have more than one-third.
155600	157200	Otherwise, Nintendo will be too strong.
157200	160300	They want to have two-thirds of what's being sold on the platform.
160300	163600	I believe that the job of first-party software is to drive hardware.
163600	167800	If you don't have a quick impact and a quick dissemination amongst the audience, you lose momentum.
167800	171200	If you don't have momentum, the third-parties don't want to jump on your platform.
171200	174000	So, that's not a good situation to be in.
174000	179600	It's interesting because a lot of people have been paralleling what's going on with the Wii here to the Nintendo DS,
179600	183900	where there wasn't a lot of stuff available for the DS when it first came out.
183900	186900	It took a long time for the titles to really start coming in.
186900	190200	And even Satoru Iwata is aware of this.
190200	195100	Quote, the same thing that happened to the Wii, a lot of the same conversations took place when the DS was launched.
195100	200700	And that's because Nintendo was really the only one that was very focused on that user expansion goal we've talked about so often,
200700	203700	and because we are creating unique software that no one else is creating.
203700	206800	The phenomenon of Nintendo software selling was insane.
206800	209100	Hmm. Kind of interesting there.
209100	215300	Where do you think the future lies for Nintendo as far as the third-party softwares go, and what's in the future for us?
215300	224500	Well, hopefully people will exhaust the stupid ports that they're going to make, and we actually get some better games.
224500	230000	We really need new, innovative, original content.
230000	232100	I guess I can agree with both of that.
232100	237200	And Nintendo, I think, needs to open up a bit more of those little things they like to sit on
237200	240200	and then announce later when their own stuff comes out,
240200	244900	need to make things more available to the other developers, I think.
244900	246100	I would certainly agree with that.
246100	250800	So they need to open up the online stuff a little faster, and the DS connectivity, you know,
250800	255100	even though I guess they kind of did that with Pok√©mon, is, you know, more. Open that up a little more.
255100	257400	We need more, please.
257400	263300	Well, another very interesting development is that
263300	268300	Harvey Birdman, Attorney-at-Law, is coming to the Wii in November.
268300	269600	That looks hilarious.
269600	273500	But it's actually being put out by Capcom,
273500	278900	and it's going to be, and I quote, a fully animated interactive adventure game.
278900	283500	So, um, maybe it's going to be fun?
283500	286700	Think of Phoenix Wright, but just with the Cartoon Network humor, it's hilarious.
286700	291900	And there's, like, they showed one video of it where, like, I guess Guile is in the stands,
291900	295000	and some woman's, like, rubbing his nipples or something.
295000	296800	It was really weird stuff.
296800	298500	But it's, like, it's hilarious.
298500	302100	It's Phoenix Wright, but just not taking itself seriously at all.
302100	304900	I would like to say I saw that at Comic-Con this year,
304900	308500	and what little I played of it was really crappy.
308500	311500	Well, then again, Phoenix Wright doesn't really take itself very seriously.
311500	314700	Did you see the pun that they put in the last Phoenix Wright game?
314700	316200	No, I don't play those games.
316200	319300	Oh, it was, they did this as Sparta.
319300	320300	It was, like, crazy.
320300	324300	Wow, this is not, this is totally original!
324300	327700	This is Sparta!
327700	330500	300, I get it.
330500	333700	Anyways, something that is totally original,
333700	339500	a game by Square Enix that's not featuring any Final Fantasy characters.
339500	343500	Wait, how can this, is there any Dragon Quest characters in it?
343500	346300	Uh, I don't think so.
346300	346900	Star Ocean!
346900	348500	Is it Tales of Blank?
348500	349500	Blank of Mana?
349500	350100	What is it?
350100	351700	It is a puzzle game.
351700	355300	So, hooray!
355300	359900	Well, you know what, you joke about,
359900	365300	Ergeist II, please? No, it's not Ergeist II, that would be fucking awesome, though, seriously.
365300	369300	I would kill for another Ergeist, that would be great.
369300	373100	No, we need, if they have Einhander, they need Zweihander
373100	375100	as the sequel. Two-handed.
375100	378500	No, it's going to be a game called Josumen,
378500	384100	and it's a web puzzler in which you arrange blocks into squares
384100	386400	and rectangles and destroy them.
386400	389300	Wow, that sounds like every other puzzle game.
389300	390500	Ever.
390500	393500	No, but seriously, though, I mean, at least they're kind of making something a little different.
393500	396900	I remember, was it, um, there's going to be the, uh,
396900	403000	Puzzle Day Harvest Moon coming out in October, so it's like, ooh.
403000	404500	Um, Dark Tetsuya says,
404500	408800	What they don't tell you is that Cloud and Sephiroth are unlockable characters.
408800	414300	That comment coming from our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
414300	417000	Whatever, Sephiroth, Sephiroth, whatever, I don't care.
417000	419400	Who cares? Overplayed, that's his name. Overplayed.
419400	421200	Tomato, tomato.
421200	422700	Uh, and Druunami says,
422700	424500	Tales of blank is Namco Bandai.
424500	427700	You know, that's true, and yet I said it anyway, and I knew that.
427700	429500	It's weird.
429500	431900	Like I said, I'm broken tonight, remember?
431900	433600	It's because of all the cocaine you've been doing.
433600	436000	Apparently.
436000	438100	I don't do drugs, that's not cool.
438100	440900	All right, but what is cool is the Virtual Console,
440900	445300	and what's really, really super cool, Donkey Kong Jr. Math.
445300	448900	That made, you know I actually had a Donkey Kong Jr. Math cartridge, go figure.
448900	453900	Uh, but I, I saw it for like two bucks once, and I thought, ooh, this'll be a collector's item Sunday.
453900	454800	Yeah, I was wrong.
454800	458400	But anyway, Donkey Kong Jr. Math has made its way to the Virtual Console this week.
458400	461800	I guess you could say it was part of like a whole back to school type thing,
461800	465700	because it did come out, of course it's 500 points for Donkey Kong Jr. Math, which by the way,
465700	467900	way too much money for Donkey Kong Jr. Math.
467900	469900	Here, I have a suggestion for you guys.
469900	471400	Here's what you should do.
471400	476500	For, you know, 500 points or five bucks, you could buy Donkey Kong Jr. Math.
476500	479000	Yeah, that may sound like a good deal for you, but how about this?
479000	483100	Spend just a little bit more money, buy Animal Crossing for the GameCube,
483100	487200	and guess what, look, you've got a bunch of Virtual Console games right there.
487200	490500	By the way, Animal Crossing is one of those backwards compatible games as well, right?
490500	495700	Exactly, and um, it's probably around 20 bucks right now, if not cheaper.
495700	499000	Goddamn, I can't wait for Animal Crossing Wii.
499000	502000	Even if the DS one was a little bit disappointing, because it was kind of the same thing,
502000	506500	like I really hope they kind of like change it up and make Animal Crossing Wii just awesome.
506500	514600	You know what, I was actually using the Japanese GameCube one as a training tool to help me read better,
514600	518800	because it doesn't use any kanji except for like really simple ones,
518800	523400	and they say, you know how they say every letter?
523400	525500	And so when they talk it sounds like...
525500	530400	It still sounds that way, but you can actually hear a little bit more of it like they're actually saying it.
530400	531000	Right.
531000	534900	And so I found it actually to be very educational,
534900	539200	and I kind of hope that they'd have like a language mode in the release that we get.
539200	540500	I think that'd be a good idea.
540500	542100	You never know, it might happen.
542100	543600	Be very cool.
543600	546300	Also, I want to point out what also came out on the Virtual Console,
546300	549400	Adventure Island, which was one of the very first NES games I ever owned.
549400	553300	Adventure Island is also out, and if you want to hop over to the Genesis,
553300	555800	Landstalker, The Treasures of King Knoll,
555800	559900	as well as Bonk 3, Bonk's Big Adventure on the TurboGrafx-16.
559900	561900	Just a note for those of you guys listening on the podcast,
561900	564600	this would be last week's releases by the time you guys hear this,
564600	566200	but for our live listeners on Sunday,
566200	570000	that's all the stuff that came out for you guys this week.
570000	575100	By the way, also, we have a very important message from SSJ100Matt in our chat room right now.
575100	579700	Apparently there's one of those character battles going on on gamefacts.com right now,
579700	580900	and it should be noted now.
580900	583800	Again, this only really will work for those of you guys on Sunday night,
583800	586200	but it should be noted that our beloved,
586200	588400	one of our favorite game characters of all time,
588400	591300	Pyramid Head is in the running right now in the character battle,
591300	593700	and Pyramid Head needs more votes.
593700	596700	He's up against Auron from Final Fantasy,
596700	599000	Chris Redfield from, I believe, Resident Evil, right?
599000	601900	And Shadow the Hedgehog from, of course, the Sonic series.
601900	604200	But Pyramid Head needs your help,
604200	606200	so please go vote for Pyramid Head,
606200	609000	or else we will send him to your house to rape you.
609000	611400	That's all.
611400	613800	I voted.
613800	615600	Did you vote for Pyramid Head?
615600	616600	I am very proud of you.
616600	618100	That's all I have to say on Virtual Console,
618100	619200	and go vote Pyramid Head.
619200	620800	I have things to say on Virtual Console.
620800	621900	Well, isn't that nice?
621900	623400	It's all Sega.
623400	625400	Sega, Sega, Sega, Sega, Sega,
625400	628600	or in this case for the UK, Mega.
628600	629600	Mega Drive Games.
629600	634300	We have Sonic the Hedgehog 3, which is really good.
634300	638000	And then one of my personal favorites, Ghouls and Ghosts,
638000	641000	which is really still freaking hard even to this day,
641000	642700	because it's like, let's play Ghouls and Ghosts,
642700	644400	blah, blah, blah, beat Satan.
644400	646200	Oh, I have to play again.
646200	647200	Shit.
647200	651400	So that's, by the way, Ghouls and Ghosts in a nutshell.
651400	654000	And then we have E-Swat, City Under Siege,
654000	657600	which actually is a game that Dan and I played a little bit of.
657600	659800	Could be like E-Swat for some reason.
659800	665600	And then we have Shining in the Darkness, which is an OK game.
665600	673800	And then there was Crackdown.
673800	674800	I don't remember that.
674800	676800	You know, I really need to go back and play some more Crackdown.
676800	679800	I remember the Crackdown that came out on 360 a little while ago.
679800	681800	This is two words, Crackdown.
681800	683800	Oh, that's an old-ass game.
683800	685400	And maybe it had a different name over here.
685400	686000	I don't know.
686000	689000	Why is it that the folks in the UK get completely different releases?
689000	690600	Why don't they just make it the same for everybody?
690600	694000	You have to save the world from evil cyborgs and then bomb them.
694000	695300	That's kind of cool.
695300	697600	But just to let our listeners overseas know,
697600	699600	they are 800 points apiece,
699600	704500	translated to 5 pounds 60 and 8 euros.
704500	706800	So there you go.
706800	708800	All right, check it out if you're in the UK
708800	712200	and need some more virtual console games.
712200	715300	Now to kind of switch gears to something a little different.
715300	719400	Square Enix was saying that PlayStation 3
719400	722200	needs their marketing to be straightened up.
722200	725400	And I think basically referring to,
725400	728800	this is kind of going back to the stories we were talking about in part A
728800	733400	where they were calling it a computer,
733400	738400	strictly a home media center or something like that.
738400	742000	Because basically according to Wada,
742000	744600	he says, Sony first unveiled the PlayStation 3
744600	746800	as a mighty home electronics product.
746800	749400	Then after some badgering from game companies,
749400	753800	it shifted the position of the console closer to a game machine.
753800	757600	The future of the PlayStation 3 would be tough
757600	760700	if its marketing strategy is not straightened up.
760700	764500	And to be honest, I can kind of agree with him a little bit.
764500	767700	If you've seen any of the marketing that they've done
767700	772800	in the UK, especially with this is living,
772800	776200	it makes no fucking sense whatsoever.
776200	780500	And even now, I remember the first commercials that came out for the PlayStation 3
780500	783600	with the crying baby doll and weird shit like that,
783600	785000	it made no fucking sense.
785000	788500	Luckily now though, they show gameplay during their commercials
788500	789900	and just kind of leave it at that.
789900	791400	That is what they need to be doing.
791400	794000	So it sounds like they're kind of smartening up a little bit,
794000	799800	but my god, do not fucking let the people that did the advertising campaign in the UK
799800	801200	get a hold of anything.
801200	802400	In fact, they should all be fired.
802400	805600	Or the people that did the All I Want for Xmas is at PSP.com?
805600	806900	Yeah.
806900	809200	Yeah, all fired. Good stuff.
809200	810800	They all should be sacked.
810800	813000	And then the people that sacked them will be sacked as well.
813000	816400	And then they'll do them again at great expense with llamas.
816400	819900	Alright, well, moving on to something.
819900	822600	And now for something completely different, so to speak.
822600	823800	This is how not to be seen.
823800	828600	There was of course big announcements in the nerd world this week from Apple.
828600	831200	And Apple is launching just in time for the holiday season.
831200	833400	They are launching all sorts of new crap.
833400	836000	Basically now they have an iPhone without the phone,
836000	838000	which they're calling the new iPod.
838000	841200	They are also releasing a classic iPod.
841200	844000	But what should be noted and what the hell this has to do with gaming
844000	846400	is a new iPod Nano that's coming out.
846400	849200	The new iPod Nano has a little bit more of a wider screen.
849200	852600	And what should also be noted is that not only does the Nano have this,
852600	855000	but the classics ship with this as well.
855000	856500	Some games.
856500	859300	Yes, some games will actually be included with these.
859300	863300	The games will be included Vortex, iQuiz, and Klondike.
863300	866700	iQuiz and Klondike I believe have been available on the store for a little while.
866700	868200	I think Vortex might have been as well.
868200	873400	Vortex is basically like a 3D version of Arkanoid or Breakout, if you will.
873400	874800	Where basically you move the paddle.
874800	877000	And I think that's a pretty creative use of the wheel.
877000	881200	Is that you actually move the little wheel around, which moves the paddle around.
881200	882800	And it's like Breakout.
882800	885800	You're breaking bricks towards the center of the screen.
885800	886800	So, kind of cool.
886800	889400	I played a whole crap ton of Arkanoid back in the day.
889400	890100	Yeah, back in the day.
890100	894400	So, this is kind of interesting and brings to note that,
894400	900000	especially with the release of the iPod without the phone or whatever you want to call it.
900000	903200	It's kind of interesting that Apple does seem to be getting their...
903200	906800	They're sticking their foot in there a little more and more with this whole gaming thing.
906800	908300	And I don't think it's time to say like,
908300	912200	OMG, Apple's going to release a gaming console because we all remember Pippin.
912200	916200	But I think that it's interesting to see, especially when it comes to...
916200	918200	You remember the Pippin?
918200	921200	I completely shoved that out of my head.
921200	925000	I think it would be interesting to see what kind of happens with the whole like,
925000	927200	you know, especially with like classic games.
930200	931400	I'll just tell you...
931400	932600	Sandwich smells.
932600	934200	Get it out of here.
934200	936600	Mmm, sandwich.
936600	937200	Sorry, Eddie.
937200	938400	You can come back when the sandwich is gone.
938400	941400	Here's an old system name that will make you laugh, Rob.
941400	942200	What's that?
942200	944200	Game.com.
944200	945200	Wow.
945200	947400	I have one.
947400	948400	Really?
948400	949400	Yes.
949400	952400	Then again, I also had an N-Gage and we gave it away.
952400	955400	You have a lot of like weird consoles.
955400	959400	So, you also have a lot of weird emails this week, I bet.
959400	960400	Oh, God.
960400	963400	And of course, we always invite our listeners to email us at our website.
963400	965400	Mailbag at orangelonserator.com.
965400	966400	I want one of these, Rob.
966400	967400	And send us some emails.
967400	968400	This is adorable.
968400	969400	What things?
969400	970400	I want one of these iPod things.
970400	971400	Which ones?
971400	973400	The little one with the square looking one.
973400	974400	The Nanos or the...
974400	975400	Is that the Nano?
975400	977400	I actually kind of want an iPhone.
977400	978400	Yeah, that's a Nano.
978400	979400	That's cute.
979400	981400	I actually kind of want an iPhone now that they dropped in price.
981400	982400	We'll say that another day.
982400	983400	Let's do the emails.
983400	984400	Okay.
984400	985400	Mailbag at orangelonserator.com.
985400	989400	Dark Sakura will now open up the mailbag and read a few of her favorites.
989400	993400	At least I'll read a few of the ones that actually have substance to them.
993400	994400	And I'm sorry, Misty.
994400	995400	I did get both of yours.
995400	997400	I'm very sorry that you have to work.
997400	999400	Really sorry.
999400	1002400	This one's from our friend, Rob with two Bs.
1002400	1006400	I read in Nintendo Power the next version of William's classic pinball will include
1006400	1012400	Gorgar, the first talkie, Black Knight, which inspired David's midnight magic, and Pinbot.
1012400	1013400	Hooray.
1013400	1017400	I'm hoping for Z and B to be the flippers for the nunchuck.
1017400	1020400	And my two bits on Space Giraffe.
1020400	1021400	Bit one.
1021400	1025400	I love the arcade's style play and similarity to Tempest 2000.
1025400	1026400	Bit two.
1026400	1030400	The blurry visuals are sort of low res and the game's LSD inspired visuals seem to be
1030400	1033400	there to make the game harder.
1033400	1035400	It's not as good as Tempest, I'm afraid.
1035400	1039400	I'd much rather have a crisp vector display than a trippy, blurry, inferior graphic.
1039400	1041400	At least it was $5 and not $10.
1041400	1044400	It should also carry an epileptic seizure warning.
1044400	1046400	I bought it, but I haven't really played it much.
1046400	1047400	Boredom get.
1047400	1048400	And one last topic.
1048400	1049400	PS3 pricing.
1049400	1052400	The original price was intended for the hardcore gamer.
1052400	1053400	Not many people wanted it.
1053400	1057400	It was priced too high for resale on eBay and it was readily available in mid-December.
1057400	1061400	Did Sony effectively kill the third party market for initial PS3 games?
1061400	1064400	Did they actually get the money that the eBayers would have gotten?
1064400	1068400	It's an interesting thought because the answers to both seem to be yes.
1068400	1071400	They still didn't stop the stabbings and shootings, but I don't blame them for that.
1071400	1074400	See you later, Rob Bubba.
1074400	1075400	I like hearing from Rob.
1075400	1077400	It's been a little while, so.
1077400	1080400	I actually am really looking forward to this whole pinball game that's going to be on the
1080400	1081400	Wii that he talked about at the very beginning.
1081400	1082400	Pinball.
1082400	1084400	Like, pin-bot and stuff.
1084400	1094400	I would like to see a reincarnation of the old school pin-bot on the NES as an optional
1094400	1097400	mode where you could actually have the little aliens come out on the table and try to eat
1097400	1100400	your ball and all the crazy shit they had on the NES version of the game.
1100400	1101400	You know what?
1101400	1102400	What?
1102400	1106400	Right now our NES is hooked up with pin-bot in it.
1106400	1108400	That is rad.
1108400	1113400	Of course, also hooked up to the same receiver is our PS2 with Guitar Hero.
1113400	1114400	Nice.
1114400	1115400	Yeah.
1115400	1116400	Anyway.
1116400	1118400	Many greetings, Orange Orange Radio.
1118400	1119400	I'm a big fan of your show.
1119400	1121400	No, it's not that I like your show a lot.
1121400	1124400	It's just that a lifetime of Doritos has made me very big.
1124400	1125400	Wait, who is this?
1125400	1126400	I'm only joking.
1126400	1127400	Mr. Patch.
1127400	1128400	Oh, okay.
1128400	1130400	I love your show, but for about three months I lost you.
1130400	1135400	Things really got hectic in my life and schedules got tight, so no time to tune into your show,
1135400	1136400	but it lasts.
1136400	1138400	About two months ago, I found you in my crazy life.
1138400	1141400	I found time for you in my crazy life, and damn, I have been enjoying it.
1141400	1145400	Anyway, I emailed you to ask you guys about Banjo 3E.
1145400	1150400	I've emailed before about the Banjo series being on 360 in some form, and from that email
1150400	1152400	I learned that you really didn't care for Banjo too much.
1152400	1153400	No, not really.
1153400	1157400	And I understand it's not the best game for some hardcore gamers, but for me, Banjo Kazooie
1157400	1159400	really turned me into the gamer I am today.
1159400	1161400	Anyways, finally, my question.
1161400	1166400	Do you think Microsoft will push Banjo 3E when its release date comes near, or will
1166400	1169400	it be a quiet release like some of the other Rare games?
1169400	1173400	Thanks for taking the time to read this email, and thanks even more if you answer my question
1173400	1174400	with curse words.
1174400	1176400	Love, hey, Mr. Patch.
1176400	1177400	Well, fuck.
1177400	1180400	Well, listen here, you little fucker.
1180400	1181400	No.
1181400	1182400	With shit for brains?
1182400	1183400	No, I'm kidding.
1183400	1184400	Heart, heart, heart.
1184400	1185400	No, we appreciate the email.
1185400	1186400	Here it is.
1186400	1191400	Yeah, I'm not the biggest fan of these games, but I think Microsoft will realize that there
1191400	1195400	is a fan base for the games.
1195400	1197400	Guys like you, you know?
1197400	1202400	And I think they will for that reason definitely try to get it out there that, hey, it's back.
1202400	1204400	Banjo Kazooie comes back.
1204400	1207400	And I think you will see a little bit of a marketing campaign like that.
1207400	1213400	I don't think it's going to be near the size that you would see for one of their AAA titles,
1213400	1216400	but I don't see any reason why I won't get some notability.
1216400	1218400	I don't think it'll be a quiet release by any means.
1218400	1220400	There you go.
1220400	1223400	I think of Banjo Kazooie, and for some reason I always think of Pandemonium.
1223400	1226400	Do you remember that game, Rob?
1226400	1227400	No.
1227400	1233400	Pandemonium was a side-scrolling, very bizarre game, but I actually have the Japanese version
1233400	1237400	of it, which was Magical Hoppers, and they re-pixeled it or whatever.
1237400	1240400	But I don't know why, but it's always one of those...
1240400	1246400	I always think of those very early PlayStation 1 games and the early Nintendo games, and
1246400	1251400	every game that's come out since then that's in that franchise, like Spyro, I always lump
1251400	1256400	them into that one category that I label, Why God?
1256400	1257400	Why?
1257400	1262400	SSJ100Matt in our chat room at chat.ornishonorsready.com says, Fuck Banjo.
1262400	1265400	Give me a new fucking Killer Instincts.
1265400	1267400	Ooh.
1267400	1269400	Why so much love for Killer Instincts?
1269400	1271400	Because I've also seen people with a lot of hate for Killer Instinct.
1271400	1277400	Keep in mind, I played a shit ton of the first Killer Instinct when it...
1277400	1281400	How many pounds in a shit ton?
1281400	1284400	I'm going to give my homage to Don French right now.
1284400	1294400	I played croc shits of Killer Instinct when I was in college, and KI2 was very exciting
1294400	1299400	to me when it came out, except that I hated that they changed all of Orchid's moves.
1299400	1303400	But it was very, very cool for me, and even to the point where Dan had it on his Super
1303400	1308400	Nintendo when I lived in Alabama, to the point that he kept starting over and over until
1308400	1312400	it started off with Orchid's level so he could copy the music for me.
1312400	1313400	Isn't that romantic?
1313400	1314400	That's very sweet.
1314400	1315400	Anyway, next email.
1315400	1317400	Aw, barf.
1317400	1319400	Combo Breaker, next email please.
1319400	1321400	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1321400	1324400	Oi Peeps, this is no Soul Boy.
1324400	1327400	Alcohol and Tylenol can kill you.
1327400	1328400	Prime 3.
1328400	1330400	Oh yeah, you weren't here last week.
1330400	1334400	I was actually, you know what I did last week?
1334400	1336400	It was my anniversary.
1336400	1338400	Weren't you seeing Weirdo?
1338400	1340400	I did more than that.
1340400	1348400	On Friday night, Dan and I hung out and did stuff on, well actually I hung out online
1348400	1352400	and talked to people, and then Dan and I did a couple of things.
1352400	1357400	Saturday we went to Benihana, and I drank a lot.
1357400	1363400	And Sunday, I cracked open my bottle of Metaxa, which I was going to bring over, and you said
1363400	1364400	you were sick.
1364400	1367400	So I was like, I don't want to get sick, not on my anniversary, so I said I'm not going
1367400	1368400	to hang out with Bob.
1368400	1370400	It wasn't contagious, whatever it was.
1370400	1371400	It's gone, thank God.
1371400	1373400	Rob had the rocket pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu.
1373400	1378400	Here's the thing, and I do want to apologize if I came off like an idiot, but I did say
1378400	1381400	something about, I had been taking Tylenol because I was sick, and I was drinking because
1381400	1383400	I don't care, and I said something like, it's not going to kill me.
1383400	1388400	Here's the thing, I am not, obviously if you drink a lot and you take a lot of Tylenol,
1388400	1389400	yes, that can kill you.
1389400	1393400	I'm not stupid, and you know, I've seen a lot of kids do a lot of stupid things, unfortunately
1393400	1394400	in my lifetime.
1394400	1398400	But here's the thing, a little tiny bit, it wasn't that much Tylenol, it really wasn't,
1398400	1400400	it wasn't that much liquor I drank last week either.
1400400	1406400	I think little bits, like a lot of things, moderation is okay, overdoing it, not okay.
1406400	1409400	So the more you know, NBC, there you go.
1409400	1410400	Can I finish my email now?
1410400	1411400	You may.
1411400	1416400	Prime 3, you can die if you don't kill Meta Ridley in time.
1416400	1418400	Yes, I suck, but give me a break.
1418400	1419400	Second Wii game I ever played.
1419400	1424400	I'm a Mac lover, but iPhones are for people with too much money and too much to do.
1424400	1429400	Finished Bioshock, that part that scared me was when the Spicers started playing Dead.
1429400	1432400	Oh, and also the huge room with the water on the floor and the plaster covered ballet
1432400	1434400	dancers, very creepy.
1434400	1438400	I listened to your podcast and Game Theory.
1438400	1442400	As a designer, I'd really like to hear more about excellent game design as opposed to
1442400	1444400	graphics or effects.
1444400	1451400	For instance, on the DC Phantasy Star Online's UI and menu system, amazingly fluid and functional
1451400	1452400	during gameplay.
1452400	1453400	Hell yes!
1453400	1457400	That was, you know, one of the biggest things that I hated about Phantasy Star Universe
1457400	1461400	is that the menus in Phantasy Star Online were so much freaking better.
1461400	1463400	Okay, so I'm going to keep going.
1463400	1468400	Or for anyone who's ever played a squad game to compare it to the four player action in
1468400	1470400	Crystal Chronicles on GameCube.
1470400	1475400	People started working together in a way that is just genius and it's totally obvious that
1475400	1477400	it was the intent of the designers.
1477400	1479400	Or how about most of the games by Treasure?
1479400	1480400	A-freaking-men.
1480400	1483400	Talk about walking out on a limb and creating amazing experiences.
1483400	1487400	These games are perfect arguments for the game as art debate.
1487400	1489400	You know what?
1489400	1494400	Treasure is just, okay, Treasure gave us Ikaruga.
1494400	1495400	They gave us Bongio.
1495400	1496400	I love Bongio.
1496400	1497400	Oh my God.
1497400	1499400	The game is so cool.
1499400	1507400	They gave us Silhouette Mirage, which is just, it was, when it came out, it was like something
1507400	1511400	nobody had ever seen, you know, no one had ever seen anything like that before.
1511400	1514400	Even that dorky little chameleon twist game was cool.
1514400	1518400	I mean, Treasure is all about the innovation in gameplay.
1518400	1522400	You know, another game that you're talking about having people work together is Pac-Man
1522400	1531400	vs. where you have three people on individual game, it's GBAs actually, or a Game Boy SP
1531400	1534400	because of the connector that they use for it, but they control the ghost and you have
1534400	1536400	your person as Pac-Man.
1536400	1538400	You know, I got to hand it to the GameCube.
1538400	1543400	Those games that had the connectivity between the DS and the GameCube were a heck of a
1543400	1544400	lot of fun.
1544400	1547400	Like the Four Swords Adventures, I had a lot of fun playing that game with some of my friends.
1547400	1554400	It's kind of a shame because you see that potential available on the PlayStation 3 and
1554400	1558400	the PSP and the whole Wii DS thing, you know, without needing everybody having to have a
1558400	1559400	cable.
1559400	1560400	Remember, that was the thing.
1560400	1563400	It's like, sure, a lot of people had Crystal Chronicles, but nobody could play it the right
1563400	1567400	way because you could never find enough of those damn cables to hook up your DS, or not
1567400	1570400	your DS, your Game Boy to the system and everything.
1570400	1576400	But, you know, a lot of people, a lot of people have a DS now these days, so it would be so
1576400	1580400	easy to do something with the whole Wii and the Wi-Fi and kind of bring back those types
1580400	1581400	of games.
1581400	1582400	It would be awesome.
1582400	1587400	Then you can do the touch and the motion and there's a lot of potential there that I'm
1587400	1589400	hoping is explored in the next couple of years.
1589400	1590400	Yes, Eddie's back.
1590400	1591400	Hey, I'm back.
1591400	1594400	Yeah, no, I agree because what I was thinking is that on a lot of those games it would be
1594400	1600400	cool as if the DS was like a device in the game and like if it was like a spy sort of
1600400	1603400	espionage game, like you would get like secret messages on your DS or something like that
1603400	1605400	and it would, you know, light up or something like that.
1605400	1610400	I think that would be cool, like you're saying, make it more like reality, you know, just
1610400	1611400	make it really interactive with the game.
1611400	1613400	I think that would be awesome.
1613400	1616400	You know what else I thought was cool, kind of speaking of that, was that whole, you know,
1616400	1620400	in a Red Steel, like you could, you'd put the Wii mode up to your ear because it has
1620400	1623400	a speaker in there and it would tell you what your objective was, like, hey, you need to
1623400	1625400	kill player three or whatever it is.
1625400	1626400	That was lame.
1626400	1628400	It sounded cool, but it was lame.
1628400	1629400	I know.
1629400	1634400	Unfortunately, the game turned out to be kind of dumb, but I think the idea was good and
1634400	1637400	I can recognize that that was, you know, especially for a launch title, that was a pretty neat
1637400	1639400	usage of the stuff.
1639400	1642400	Because they could do that like if the phone's ringing in the game or something, like you
1642400	1645400	put the Wii mode up to your ear or something like that and press A and then it's like,
1645400	1646400	you know, they're talking on the phone.
1646400	1647400	That'd be cool.
1647400	1649400	Well, you can do that in WarioWare.
1649400	1650400	That's one of the mini games.
1650400	1653400	Yeah, you pick up the phone and then you hear it coming out the speaker and the Wii mode,
1653400	1654400	hello, hello.
1654400	1656400	It's really funny.
1656400	1658400	That kind of little shit goes a long way.
1658400	1659400	I love it.
1659400	1661400	So, there you have it.
1661400	1662400	All right.
1662400	1665400	Sorry, that's my response to the email.
1665400	1668400	I don't even know if that's what they were looking for, but there you have it.
1668400	1670400	Um, okay.
1670400	1672400	I'm adjusting.
1672400	1673400	Wedgies?
1673400	1674400	No.
1674400	1680400	This chair's like sitting on, it's like the princess and the pea, you know, where you've
1680400	1682400	got, hey.
1682400	1683400	What?
1683400	1686400	I'm asking where it would be in Tylenol.
1686400	1687400	It's in the bathroom.
1687400	1689400	Yeah, I believe I do.
1689400	1691400	Yes, I'll go show you where the Tylenol is.
1691400	1692400	Jamie reads more emails.
1692400	1694400	Look at the left side of the cabinet.
1694400	1697400	This chair's like the princess and the pea, you know, where you have all this cushion,
1697400	1700400	but you feel that one lump that's like, I can't sit in this chair.
1700400	1701400	That's it.
1701400	1702400	Okay, princess.
1702400	1703400	Next email.
1703400	1706400	Hi to you, other lady folks.
1706400	1707400	Wave.
1707400	1713400	Anyway, I went to Project Revolution Tour here in Chicago and me and my friend got there
1713400	1714400	around 1.30.
1714400	1718400	I found out the band I really wanted to see, Linkin Park, wasn't playing until 9.30.
1718400	1725400	So me and my friend hung out and walked around for a few hours and then we saw MSI, and that
1725400	1727400	was cool.
1727400	1733400	Now, upon walking around, I discovered a tent that had two long banners that just had three
1733400	1740400	on them and believe, 9.25.07 at the bottom, you know, so I was like, do one and asked
1740400	1741400	the two guys standing there if I could go in.
1741400	1743400	They said that it was a private party.
1743400	1747400	After this, I just kind of listened hard as much as you can at a rock concert, and I heard
1747400	1750400	the distinctive noise of shields recharging.
1750400	1753400	I knew I had to get in.
1753400	1758400	That was before, as mindless self-indulgence, okay, I was like, hey, that's a band I like.
1758400	1764800	Now, fast forward to the end of the MSI show, I went back to find the tent open with quite
1764800	1765800	a few people inside.
1765800	1770680	I stood there with a few other people and knew I was going to get in somehow.
1770680	1774600	Unfortunately, one guy gave out three passes to three people around me.
1774600	1786280	I stuck around, though, and saw none other than Jay Wineland, the head sound designer
1786280	1787280	for Bungie.
1787280	1788960	I pointed to him and said, hey, you're Jay, right?
1788960	1789960	The sound guy.
1789960	1792960	He just nodded and smiled and said, wow, that was good, kind of creepy, but good, and disappeared
1792960	1796160	for a sec, and then he came back with a pass for me to get in.
1796160	1798640	I was all happy, got his autograph, and went and played.
1798640	1801520	Let me tell you, Narrows is going to be a classic map.
1801520	1803600	This is about Halo 3, by the way.
1803600	1807480	Seriously, the build he had wasn't final, but you could tell it almost was because the
1807480	1808960	fourth grenade was up there.
1808960	1813640	Unfortunately, all we had were the following maps, High Ground, Valhalla, Snowbound, Narrows,
1813640	1815800	Epitaph, Last Resort, and Sandtrap.
1815800	1818720	One thing I loved about the game overall, everything was colorful.
1818720	1821560	I don't mean bright colors everywhere, but it was just vibrant.
1821560	1826780	I couldn't see clearly 100% of the time, but unlike in Halo 2, where I have to turn the
1826780	1829960	brightness up a ton, it looked much better than Gears of War.
1829960	1832400	Anyway, I didn't see much new stuff.
1832400	1837680	I really did get to see a game of Infection slash Zombies, though, which I didn't quite
1837680	1838680	understand.
1838680	1839680	Weird shrug.
1839680	1845840	So, around 7.30 to 8 o'clock or so, Mike, Rob, and Joe from Linkin Park walk in and
1845840	1847680	just sit down and start playing.
1847680	1852600	Everyone in the room outside who didn't get in was all OMG for a while, and people just
1852600	1853600	sat down and played.
1853600	1854600	I played too.
1854600	1856080	I totally kicked their butts.
1856080	1859840	Mike and Joe, the rapper and DJ, were pretty good, and you could tell Rob the drummer doesn't
1859840	1860840	play much.
1860840	1865360	I hung around Rob, got his autograph as well, and Mike's later, but Rob was there.
1865360	1868340	As long as I don't get last place, I'm good, and he didn't.
1868340	1869340	He did pretty good.
1869340	1872160	Oh, and that was pretty much the highlight of my summer and definitely the best concert
1872160	1873160	I've ever been to.
1873160	1874920	Here's any pictures of the event.
1874920	1880760	So I will actually save this email so that we can put this up on the website.
1880760	1881760	How's that sound?
1881760	1882760	Rad.
1882760	1884960	Yeah, you should put the pictures up, because I was actually looking at that email earlier
1884960	1885960	this week.
1885960	1888240	And that's from Sycoon, by the way.
1888240	1891120	That's our buddy Sycoon.
1891120	1895440	Good job, Sycoon, with your field reporting.
1895440	1896440	More emails.
1896440	1897440	Hey.
1897440	1898440	Yes.
1898440	1899440	Hey, OLR crew.
1899440	1903000	There are quite a few new games coming out that are being reported as having short play
1903000	1904000	times.
1904000	1905960	Heavenly Sword, for example, is just six to ten hours.
1905960	1909760	Now, I don't have a problem with short games, but I do have a problem with paying 60 bucks
1909760	1914800	for them, so I decided to join Gamefly to rent those shorter games and play them through
1914800	1917200	without the heavy cost.
1917200	1919600	Am I not supporting the industry by joining Gamefly?
1919600	1926400	Without this option, I certainly would have bought Heavenly Sword Lair and the sword at
1926400	1930000	the full price and finished them in a week or two, thus putting more money directly into
1930000	1931000	the industry.
1931000	1934440	Do you think long-term renting options like Gamefly are bad for the industry?
1934440	1938120	And why is it that every time I pick my nose, it's full again after a few minutes?
1938120	1939600	Dark Raven.
1939600	1942480	Okay, wow.
1942480	1943480	You know what?
1943480	1945680	Blockbuster didn't kill the movie industry.
1945680	1950720	And Netflix certainly hasn't damaged it either, so why would Gamefly kill the games industry?
1950720	1954960	Because Gamefly still has to buy all those games from the publishers to get out to rent.
1954960	1956880	It all depends on how you see it.
1956880	1960560	I'm sure the publishers don't like Gamefly, but there's nothing really they can do about
1960560	1961560	it.
1961560	1965140	I mean, because, I don't know, one argument you could say, well, people are just going
1965140	1969040	to rent games and they're not going to buy them, so, you know, we want people buying
1969040	1970840	our games, not renting them.
1970840	1974800	But on the other hand, though, people rent the game, like it, and then maybe buy it.
1974800	1978800	Yeah, make a game worth buying and people will buy it, right?
1978800	1981640	Because how many times, seriously, that's what it boils down to.
1981640	1984240	How many people, I mean, I know I did this when I was a kid all the time, I would rent
1984240	1987880	a game and I would love it so much, I'd be like, Mommy, Mommy, buy it for me for Christmas,
1987880	1992880	and she would, because she loved me.
1992880	1994800	At least that's what she told me.
1994800	1996800	To my face.
1996800	1997800	So there you go.
1997800	2000200	Yeah, it's your face behind your back.
2000200	2001200	Anyway.
2001200	2005920	Hey, OLR, I know you guys have been looking for someone who doesn't like Bioshock, and
2005920	2010240	even with my praises sung a few episodes ago, I have major complaint about the game after
2010240	2011840	getting the retail version.
2011840	2015800	It's far too dark and things that are shooting at you are impossible to see because they're
2015800	2019760	either too far away and have deadly aim or you can't see them because the whole place
2019760	2021600	is freaking dark.
2021600	2023200	Has anyone else had this problem?
2023200	2025280	I can't be the only one.
2025280	2028800	The story is going to keep me going through the game, though, it's very intriguing.
2028800	2035000	Cheers and keep up the podcasting AZHP.
2035000	2038120	I really want to hear, I mean, that was a good email, but I really want to hear from
2038120	2042920	people that, like, fucking hate Bioshock, but not just because I said so, like, I really
2042920	2046800	want to hear a really good counterpoint to the whole, you know, everybody loves Bioshock.
2046800	2051000	There's always somebody that doesn't, I mean, there's two sides to every story, so somewhere
2051000	2054840	on the internet there is somebody that hates Bioshock for a good reason.
2054840	2056920	I want to know why, and I want to know that reason.
2056920	2063440	I did see something like that on Kotaku, it was from The Consumerist, I want to say.
2063440	2065320	But was it somebody just trying to be funny?
2065320	2066320	I don't know if they're trying to be funny.
2066320	2069400	Because I think I saw something, it was just somebody trying to be funny, like, it wasn't
2069400	2074760	real, you know, I want to hear, like, some real, like, I hate Bioshock and this is why.
2074760	2076320	Please.
2076320	2085200	And the last email is actually, wow, kind of long.
2085200	2090640	It's mostly suggestions for games to do on the show, so I'm going to skip down to the
2090640	2094560	actual gaming part.
2094560	2101720	To make this email a little more video game related, I'm a Wii PS2 owner that just is
2101720	2105800	about ready to pounce on the Xbox 360, now the premium has HDMI and a price cut.
2105800	2110680	But since I've already waited this long, should I wait a little bit longer?
2110680	2116760	And until the Falcon 65nm chips come out?
2116760	2117760	Okay.
2117760	2120000	Or with the three year warranty, should I just finally pick one up?
2120000	2124400	A friend of mine just picked up an Xbox 360 Premium without the HDMI and it died within
2124400	2128240	a week, and not with the Red Rings of Death.
2128240	2131800	Any game played would instantly lock up after five minutes of turning the system on and
2131800	2134320	it wasn't in a cramped cabinet either.
2134320	2140640	Makes me a little tentative about getting one with the hotter 90nm chips, or if it does
2140640	2143280	have the extra heat sink.
2143280	2147040	Since it's not Red Rings of Death and not covered in the extended warranty, although
2147040	2153100	you're still able to take it back to the store, this got long still ended here, and it's by
2153100	2157180	hailstorm in our forums.
2157180	2158180	Very cool.
2158180	2160440	I didn't see this email earlier in the week, and I'm looking at the ideas.
2160440	2161440	It just came.
2161440	2163120	Yeah, I love some of these ideas that are in there.
2163120	2164120	That's great.
2164120	2167360	In fact, one of the games he suggests we do on here is Family Feud, and that's something
2167360	2170800	I've been trying to do, like put together, but I can't figure out a good way to do it.
2170800	2171800	So I like some of these suggestions.
2171800	2173800	I'm going to read through this in more detail later.
2173800	2177760	But anyway, the meat and potatoes of the interview here down there.
2177760	2180520	Should I get an Xbox 360 now or wait?
2180520	2181520	Here's the deal.
2181520	2186000	I honestly think it'll be, I mean, maybe they'll do a little tiny chip set switcheroo, but
2186000	2187480	I don't think it'll be that big a deal.
2187480	2190500	The games they're putting out now, I mean, any game they put out is going to be designed
2190500	2195460	to run flawlessly on the, well, if all the testing is done the way it should be, to run
2195460	2197360	as best as it can on the consoles that are out now.
2197360	2200160	So I wouldn't worry so much about waiting for a chip set, and here's the thing, if you're
2200160	2204960	waiting for price reduction, new package or whatever, ain't going to happen for a year
2204960	2207880	till next Christmas season, or at least well after Christmas.
2207880	2213340	So I would say, unless you're prepared to wait six months for some significant changing
2213340	2218680	in the structures, price, offerings of the 360, just go get one now.
2218680	2224720	Honestly, as long as you document, I think, whatever happens, we've actually only had
2224720	2229760	to return one system, but I think that we did it through the store itself, and we've
2229760	2235200	actually got the elite now, Dan and I do, and it's, we've never had a problem.
2235200	2239240	And if you're also worried about that whole, oh, I went out and got an iPhone, oh shit,
2239240	2243240	they just dropped the price by 200 bucks, I got screwed, don't worry, that won't happen.
2243240	2244240	Well, there's a rebate, too.
2244240	2248000	Yeah, well, I guess now they're doing the $100 rebate or whatever, but still, I know
2248000	2251040	some people who bought an iPhone that weren't happy when they heard that announcement.
2251040	2252040	I know a lot of people weren't.
2252040	2254000	I'm sure I know who you're referring to.
2254000	2256000	Several people I know weren't happy, but yeah.
2256000	2263560	Well, um, oh, shoot, I was going to say something else about the Xbox 360, oh, yeah, I, though
2263560	2271160	have not seen what the HD movies look like on the Xbox 360, but I have seen an HD movie,
2271160	2274000	and I kind of like Blu-ray better, I hate to say it.
2274000	2276480	The quality is exactly the same.
2276480	2281600	Well, and, you know, and that's so, am I the only one that's not that intensely excited
2281600	2283400	about this next gen of video?
2283400	2288920	I mean, it's like, DVD, yeah, DVD was a huge, I mean, it was a huge contrast from VHS, but
2288920	2291480	I'm like, eh, the picture's a little better, I'm like, I don't know.
2291480	2296440	Actually, actually, actually, as a laserdisc player owner, I was very upset with a lot
2296440	2300320	of DVDs that came out, because, um, keep in mind that with laserdisc, you actually had
2300320	2302180	much less compression.
2302180	2306940	My laserdiscs of Tron, because I have the big, the nice special box set, are infinitely
2306940	2308880	better than the DVDs of Tron.
2308880	2312200	Here's the thing about the whole next gen thing, is that what's out there now is just
2312200	2316280	a bunch of bullshit, but you have to think about the finish line, because when all is
2316280	2320800	said and done, what else is going to move into the next generation of video?
2320800	2321800	Porn.
2321800	2328280	And, you know, when they start making HD, DVD, and Blu-ray porn, you are so there in
2328280	2330440	the next generation of video.
2330440	2333160	They already have that, and I'm not so there.
2333160	2334160	And they're rawr!
2334160	2336960	Rob, we still need to see Pirates.
2336960	2339520	Oh, don't they have Pirates on HD?
2339520	2340520	And Blu-ray.
2340520	2341520	Ooh!
2341520	2342520	I think I'm going to get the Blu-ray.
2342520	2345800	I used to work at a video store, and people would be like, you know, I want to return
2345800	2349960	this movie, because when I pause it, I couldn't see the picture, and it's like, okay.
2349960	2350960	Okay, listen.
2350960	2352240	I do have HD porn.
2352240	2356560	I stream it to my 360, because, thank you, media center extender.
2356560	2361680	But you know what, Black Boy, that's what Black Boy says in chat, is, Black Boy says,
2361680	2363640	who goes out and buys porn discs?
2363640	2365200	It's all download today.
2365200	2367600	Here's the thing, no, I'm not saying I'm going to go buy the porn discs.
2367600	2369800	I am someone who buys a lot of porn.
2369800	2371520	Here's the thing, though.
2371520	2375440	I'm waiting for the discs to come out, so someone can rip them and put them on the internet,
2375440	2376680	and then I can download them.
2376680	2377680	See?
2377680	2381440	Well, you really need to get out, I mean, seriously, this stuff's out there already.
2381440	2385440	For the record, the only reason I have a Blu-ray player is because we actually bought a PS3.
2385440	2390760	I'm not saying it's horrible, I'm just saying, I'm not saying it's horrible, I'm just like,
2390760	2395440	I'm not that, I was like, really, really wanting to get a DVD when they came out, a DVD player,
2395440	2399320	and I'm not, I'm like, eh, you know, I can wait until they battle it out between HD and
2399320	2400320	Blu-ray.
2400320	2404480	I'm sort of thinking about, if I did buy a new computer, I think the next one I get will
2404480	2410480	be a VIO because all the new VIOs come out with Blu-ray players, and they cost the same
2410480	2412880	that my old one did when I got it new.
2412880	2413880	Hmmm.
2413880	2414880	Mm-hmm.
2414880	2415880	Or meh.
2415880	2416880	Meh.
2416880	2419920	Is that it for emails?
2419920	2421520	Yes, Rob.
2421520	2422520	That's it.
2422520	2423520	Buy mailbag.
2423520	2424520	Alright.
2424520	2425520	Now what?
2425520	2428520	Back into some news.
2428520	2430960	Yes, news.
2430960	2437040	So anyways, this is not surprising, but it's actually pretty cool.
2437040	2443600	Manhunt 2 has leaked out online, and that would be the uncensored beta from European
2443600	2449160	regions because it is in PAL format, so of course everybody's been jumping on the bit
2449160	2450760	to actually play it.
2450760	2458080	No word if it's any, you know, if it plays well or not because it is beta, but I'm definitely
2458080	2459440	going to find out.
2459440	2463440	Ew, Mr. DeBucket in chat says Manhunt 2 has neck raping.
2463440	2464440	Is that true?
2464440	2465440	That's gross.
2465440	2466440	Ew.
2466440	2470000	I don't know, but I heard there's something about ripping off testicles in the game.
2470000	2471000	Ahhh!
2471000	2472000	It sounds awesome.
2472000	2474000	Eddie just covered his balls in the studio.
2474000	2475000	That game sounds great.
2475000	2477040	I cannot wait to play this on the Wii.
2477040	2479320	If you're a woman, and you don't have balls.
2479320	2482160	Oh my God.
2482160	2484760	How would you like it if some chick got her titties ripped off?
2484760	2485760	That's similar.
2485760	2486760	Hey, you know what?
2486760	2490720	It's going to be some crazy interactivity where you move out the Wiimote and then yank
2490720	2492840	it back to yank off the testicles.
2492840	2493840	Exactly.
2493840	2497880	It'd be like the harpoon in Zelda.
2497880	2500680	Oh my God.
2500680	2505480	Okay, the chatroom said apparently it's a running gag on All Games Interactive, one
2505480	2506480	of our buddy shows.
2506480	2508800	Neck raping is some type of joke.
2508800	2510960	Neck raping is not a joke.
2510960	2512240	That's not a fucking joke.
2512240	2513240	That's gross.
2513240	2516840	What if someone has a tracheotomy?
2516840	2521680	Ew, you want to fuck somebody's hole that you said a tracheotomy?
2521680	2522680	That's disgusting!
2522680	2526080	I was trying to think how would that work?
2526080	2528720	And I would think that it would have to either be someone with their head chopped off or
2528720	2529720	a tracheotomy.
2529720	2533920	That would be a two-part explicit episode this week.
2533920	2534920	Congratulations, crew.
2534920	2535920	You've done good.
2535920	2539080	They could talk to you while they're giving you a blow job.
2539080	2540080	They could.
2540080	2542360	I'm so glad you're not holding a microphone right now.
2542360	2547880	And that Op11 is down.
2547880	2554520	Oh my God.
2554520	2555520	That's wrong.
2555520	2556520	Now you just need a smoker.
2556520	2557520	Tracheotomy, man.
2557520	2564960	I started playing Manhunt 2 and I'll tell you it's not funny.
2564960	2566600	Wow.
2566600	2573520	Anyway, the guy who directed Doom is directing the new Street Fighter movie and it's probably
2573520	2576120	going to be just as shitty as the old one.
2576120	2577680	The end.
2577680	2580680	Yeah, I think that about says it.
2580680	2584440	I mean, gosh, there was an awful lot of internet articles about it, but I think Jamie summed
2584440	2585440	it up very well.
2585440	2586760	Here you go.
2586760	2587760	Yep.
2587760	2588760	I'm brilliant.
2588760	2593640	I really hope they don't destroy some guy's wonderful movie career and then that guy dies,
2593640	2598760	like kind of like Raul Julia, like his last movie role was M. Bison, you know, or at least
2598760	2602880	his last big screen movie role was M. Bison and Raul Julia was awesome.
2602880	2606360	Like who didn't love Gomez Adams, but anyway.
2606360	2614840	All I know is that when I hear about the shitty video game trends, shitty-os, shitty-os, new
2614840	2622600	shitty-os from the makers of Doom, the movie, it's brand new shitty-os.
2622600	2623600	You know what?
2623600	2624600	Forget the story.
2624600	2628960	When I can't talk for an entire night, I get angsty and that means it's F.U.'s of the week
2628960	2638600	time.
2638600	2639720	F.U.'s of the week time.
2639720	2641280	Start off with Dark Sakura.
2641280	2648960	F.U. goes to my sinuses for making F.U. goes to my toilet.
2648960	2654360	We have a, we've had this clog in our pipes that what happens is that it makes the toilet
2654360	2665120	back up or it backs up, it backs up, well, sewage into our tub and it sucks.
2665120	2670520	So our landlord came out and it was digging around the pipes trying to fix it, so I hope
2670520	2673600	it sticks by the time we get home.
2673600	2676560	Yes, you can say an F.U. to a video game company, Eddie.
2676560	2680400	F.U. to LucasArts for saying, we're considering making a game for the Wii.
2680400	2681400	I'm like, fuck you.
2681400	2685360	I mean, oh my god, this is like the best system ever and that like, LucasArts is awesome and
2685360	2688000	they need to like get out their ass and stop thinking about it and actually make a game
2688000	2689000	for the Wii.
2689000	2690000	So fuck you, LucasArts.
2690000	2693440	I should say Eddie is an unapologetic Nintendo fanboy, right?
2693440	2694440	Exactly, exactly.
2694440	2701320	Has a Sony or Microsoft product or Sega product, for that matter, ever been in your house?
2701320	2702320	Never.
2702320	2703320	Fanboy.
2703320	2704320	Alright, Logie.
2704320	2710200	Uh, fuck you to crappy pizza, especially at John's Incredible Pizza, because it was not
2710200	2712760	incredible, it was incredibly crappy.
2712760	2713760	Although, props to that-
2713760	2715440	It probably gave you incredible diarrhea, too.
2715440	2719920	No, it did not give me incredible diarrhea, but it was just like, it was like, wow, I
2719920	2724240	can tell you spent a lot of money on this, what, there's a whole like two pepperonis
2724240	2726240	on this pepperoni pizza they have?
2726240	2732080	I mean, seriously, it's just, it was pretty lame, but uh, whatever.
2732080	2738920	Uh, I want to give an F.U. first off to my voice, because apparently I can't talk at
2738920	2741280	all tonight, and it's really ruining the show for me.
2741280	2747560	Uh, and then I just want to give an F.U. to, um, people that start out like really nice,
2747560	2751120	like they want to be your best friend in the world, and like, you know, oh I love you and
2751120	2755040	da da da, and then they turn into like a total psycho-host beast.
2755040	2761320	I'm not talking about you, Jamie, although you've done that, too.
2761320	2764680	No, no, no, I'm talking about work-related situations.
2764680	2768760	I, I actually was actually thinking, you said that and I started thinking about, started
2768760	2769760	thinking about somebody.
2769760	2770760	What?
2770760	2773760	I'm not gonna say my name.
2773760	2774760	Oh.
2774760	2775760	I can probably think about it, yeah.
2775760	2778760	Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know what you're talking about.
2778760	2779760	Alright.
2779760	2780760	Haha.
2780760	2786280	O.L.R. rumors you guys will never know about, so that's all I wanted to say, F.U. too.
2786280	2794060	Anyways, um, so, EverQuest, yeah, that wonderful game, EverQuest, um, EverQuest 1 and 2 have
2794060	2801680	added a brand new card game called Legends of Norrath, and, um, yeah, I guess it's gonna
2801680	2811480	be, um, Oath, the Oathbound series will feature 375 cards in a 55 card starter deck for $9.99
2811480	2818400	and 15 card booster packs for $2.99, and the game is playable from EverQuest 1 or 2, although
2818400	2825640	there will be a stand-alone client, um, due out for free in September, actually this week,
2825640	2826640	on Wednesday.
2826640	2835240	So, um, I don't know, just trying to cash in, I guess, on the collectible card games.
2835240	2841720	And EverQuest, it's such a, you know, uh, new product, I don't know.
2841720	2845760	These MMOs last forever, I mean, if you think about it, Final Fantasy XI is five years old,
2845760	2848440	if you can believe it, so these MMOs last forever.
2848440	2849880	They really do.
2849880	2850880	So.
2850880	2851880	Alright.
2851880	2855320	Uh, anyway, speaking of MMOs, I have a comment.
2855320	2856320	What?
2856320	2857320	Yes.
2857320	2858480	How old is Final Fantasy?
2858480	2859480	Five years.
2859480	2862120	Just old enough to be raped now.
2862120	2864680	What is wrong with you?
2864680	2867120	You missed our discussion on neck-raping earlier.
2867120	2868120	Really?
2868120	2869120	Ow!
2869120	2871080	That's what you get for watching, thank you for punching him, that's what you get for
2871080	2872880	watching Battlestar Galactica during the show.
2872880	2876480	Now stay quiet until the next, your segment, alright?
2876480	2877480	Alright.
2877480	2878480	Fine.
2878480	2883360	Uh, moving on, speaking of MMOs, there is a new Missed Online episode coming soon to
2883360	2886360	Missed Online, which of course is part of the GameTap service.
2886360	2891000	It actually just debuted this weekend, and it's called Deception.
2891000	2893640	There's a new guild system being built into the game.
2893640	2896360	It's going to have a guild, actually I think there's already a guild system, but now the
2896360	2900880	guilds are getting pubs, and so you can actually meet up in this pub, and some new storylines
2900880	2901880	are being added into the game.
2901880	2905800	And of course Missed Online is a part of GameTap, so if you're a GameTap subscriber, you get
2905800	2906800	access to Missed Online.
2906800	2910160	I played Missed Online for like three days, but I found it to be really, like I didn't
2910160	2911840	know what the hell I was doing.
2911840	2914720	Like there needs to be a little more, like even though I thought it was cool, they had
2914720	2919520	like live actors that actually did introductions and initiations, I just wish there had been
2919520	2924400	a little more like, what the fuck do I do with this game, like kind of like talk.
2924400	2927660	So that's all, but otherwise I thought Missed Online was actually a really good looking
2927660	2933880	game, and considering I like GameTap as it is already, and I swear I'm not on their payroll,
2933880	2938060	I think it's a nice addition, I mean you pay next to nothing for it with all the other
2938060	2940920	crap that's there, so it's pretty cool.
2940920	2946780	Well, how is this for happy and sad at the same time?
2946780	2957080	You know what, it's the Dreamcast's birthday, poor, poor Dreamcast, how we miss you, 8th
2957080	2959160	birthday of the Dreamcast.
2959160	2965440	8 years, wow, that's not very long, would you consider how long ago the Dreamcast was
2965440	2966440	now?
2966440	2976600	They brought us though, we had Power Stone, Bongio, Ikaruga, Choo Choo Rocket, Soul Edge,
2976600	2987200	Soul Calibur, Rezz, lots and lots of shit, Shenmue, and the fact that you could hack
2987200	2990680	it to play Nintendo games, oh you didn't even really hack it, you just bring your own, huh,
2990680	2995320	Blingcast was cool, and they had a Pepsi Man game, and the Dreamcast love is still out
2995320	2998600	there because there's still a bunch of shit being made for it, not a bunch, it's still
2998600	3002780	awesome, I love the Dreamcast, so there you go, I have two of them because I stole mats,
3002780	3009360	I have two Dreamcast's as well, I need that back, alright Logie, alright kids, guess what
3009360	3014880	time it is, Burrito Day, no it's not Burrito Day, that's tomorrow, it's time for one of

4098300	4100100	All right, what do you want, Ravensdolvin?
4100100	4103200	I forgot to tell you that I fail at computers.
4103200	4104900	Congratul- Yes you do, congratulations.
4104900	4106900	All right, real quickly, you've had too much showtime.
4106900	4108900	What's your question tonight for us?
4108900	4111100	My Xbox died, that's it.
4111100	4112300	That's not a fucking question.
4112300	4114300	That's not a question.
4114300	4116300	No, I just want to tell you that I'm sad.
4116300	4118800	Oh, I'm sorry, here's the Kleenex.
4118800	4122100	All right, if you want to call us, 1877-GAME-OLR,
4122100	4127600	or our username is OrangeLaunchRadio on Skype.
4127600	4129900	Meanwhile, I'm looking at chat comments.
4129900	4133400	There has been a lot of chat comments tonight I've read, I apologize.
4133400	4136700	Velurno, I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing your name, I'm not sure how to say that.
4136700	4139200	Velurno says, I wanted a Crackdown sequel,
4139200	4142600	and puts those dejected little three dots right after that comment there.
4142600	4144900	So, sorry about that.
4144900	4147400	All right, we got some more calls though, let's go to the calls.
4147400	4149900	Hi, you're on OrangeLaunchRadio, who's this?
4149900	4151200	Hey guys, this is FootyMonster.
4151200	4153700	Hello, FootyMonster, how are you?
4153700	4155500	I'm doing just fine, what about you guys?
4155500	4158300	Good, hey, I don't know if I'm supposed to say this publicly,
4158300	4161500	but I heard you guys got picked up by AllGames, the ultimate quest.
4161500	4164300	That is correct, yeah, I think it's public knowledge by now.
4164300	4168200	We were promised a long time ago, but it just comes to friction right now.
4168200	4172700	So, about a week or two, we're going to be on AllGames on the stream and stuff like that.
4172700	4175000	Congratulations, that's okay, because you know what?
4175000	4178000	Hey, ScottBlue, something that I thought was a secret,
4178000	4180900	that I guess he said on the show,
4180900	4183000	and I was trying to keep it a secret.
4183000	4184900	Are we supposed to keep that a secret, or can we say it?
4184900	4186800	No, I think we're supposed to keep that a secret.
4186800	4188100	All right, then I won't say it.
4188100	4190000	All right, oh, it's a secret.
4190000	4193000	Later, I will tell you later, like, I don't know,
4193000	4197000	maybe during a certain upcoming expo, we can give you more information.
4197000	4199300	Not that I know anything, or don't, but that's it.
4199300	4201700	FootyMonster, what do you have for our listeners tonight?
4201700	4204700	Well, basically, I just wanted to share with you guys,
4204700	4206200	I don't know if it's a review or something,
4206200	4209200	but Persona 3, which is this new game for the PS2,
4209200	4212600	it's an RPG, and I just wanted to let everyone know,
4212600	4215200	because it's probably underrated and under the radar.
4215200	4217400	It's from the Shin Megami Tensei universe,
4217400	4221800	if anyone ever played one of those games, like Nocturne or Digital Devil Saga.
4221800	4225800	Nocturne was the game in which Dante from Devil May Cry made a cameo and stuff,
4225800	4228000	so it was known back in the day in the PS2.
4228000	4231400	And Persona 3 came out, and it was really, really, really good,
4231400	4234400	and I've been playing it, I've put, like, 40 hours into it,
4234400	4236000	I'm not even halfway done.
4236000	4238600	It's deep as hell, and it's really good.
4238600	4241200	I don't know if you guys have heard anything about it, or...
4241200	4242700	You know what's funny?
4242700	4246800	I'm holding here in my hand the Persona 3 trade demo we got sent from Atlus,
4246800	4249100	and I have to admit, I have not played it still.
4249100	4250000	Shame on you, Rogue.
4250000	4252500	All right, I'll give it to Jamie to play.
4252500	4257200	I swear I was going to play it, but then I went back to Final Fantasy XI.
4257200	4260100	Have you played Overlord yet?
4260100	4261500	No.
4261500	4264600	But I will.
4264600	4268600	What makes this game so great compared to the Final Fantasies of the world,
4268600	4269600	where, you know, most people you say,
4269600	4271100	what's the greatest role-playing game of all time?
4271100	4275000	People will say Dragon Quest, or they'll say Final Fantasy VII.
4275000	4277000	Why is it so great?
4277000	4278900	Well, this is the thing.
4278900	4282800	It's not just an RPG. They try to break the mold a little bit.
4282800	4285200	And as you know, RPGs are really...
4285200	4287500	They're falling flat every day more and more.
4287500	4289100	They're not that amazing anymore.
4289100	4291600	They're never anything new in them,
4291600	4295700	except for, you know, kind of cases like Bioware releasing Mass Effect and stuff like that,
4295700	4298800	which is a massive world or anything, or something like that.
4298800	4302000	This game, however, it's a single-player experience, but it's so huge.
4302000	4303800	Like, you don't just fight.
4303800	4307400	You also have to live the life of the character, as in you go to school.
4307400	4310300	You, you know, you gotta make friends with people.
4310300	4313000	You gotta develop your relationship with everyone else.
4313000	4315400	And it's not just that it's tacked on.
4315400	4320700	Also, you use that as a means to get more powerful in the game on the fighting aspect of things.
4320700	4326400	So, it's like they made this perfect balance between fighting and normal dungeon crawling,
4326400	4331700	and all this other stuff that's just about story and developing characters.
4331700	4333000	All right. Well, that sounds kind of cool.
4333000	4335900	I mean, I definitely have to check it out at some point. I will. So many games.
4335900	4339100	Tokimeki meets RPG.
4339100	4344400	I would say so. It's kind of like a date scene, if you think about it that way.
4344400	4344900	Yeah.
4344900	4351000	But, you know, in the sense that, yeah, you need to raise your academic status to do better at school,
4351000	4354900	and that in turn will unlock the chance of you to date a certain girl,
4354900	4358900	which in turn will give you the chance to get this certain magic spell,
4358900	4361900	which will make you more powerful in the fighting side of things.
4361900	4363300	That's pretty cool.
4363300	4367600	So, it's forcing you, but at the same time, if you don't want to do it, you don't want to do it.
4367600	4369600	But, there's a lot of benefit from it.
4369600	4375400	So, they actually motivate you into looking further into the game rather than just the fighting aspect of the game.
4375400	4377400	All right. I'll give you that. It sounds kind of interesting.
4377400	4380300	I definitely will have to check it out at some point.
4380300	4381300	You win.
4381300	4385600	I mean, on the show, a couple weeks ago, we did review the whole thing in length.
4385600	4389100	I spent like 20 minutes talking about it because it's really, really that good.
4389100	4389700	Very cool.
4389700	4394700	Well, so, you can go ahead and plug your show real quick so they know where to go download that if they want.
4394700	4397200	All right. So, it's UltimateQuest.net.
4397200	4401200	It's a show that I did with Shadow Slayer, Jack Ransom, and Xenocore.
4401200	4404200	And I believe that was episode 21, I want to say, or 22.
4404200	4407500	I forgot right now because we're, you know, it was a couple of weeks ago.
4407500	4409000	Oh, and I said I'd come on the show.
4409000	4412000	I sent a reply message back because I didn't see an email for like a week.
4412000	4417700	But, any of us will, I'm sure if you can work in the time with any of us, we'll all come on at some point
4417700	4419700	and talk nerdy role-playing.
4419700	4424700	Yeah, I know that Xenocore talked with you about maybe you doing, we have this little thing called the Ultimate Side Quest,
4424700	4428200	which is a show that we do on and off, sometimes like once a month.
4428200	4431700	And it's like a discussion, it's not just about the news, but about like maybe a topic,
4431700	4437200	like let's say tabletop RPG gaming and how it would make RPGs in the consoles better.
4437200	4439700	That was the topic of the latest one.
4439700	4442700	You'll have to get Jamie for that one because I don't do a lot of tabletop.
4442700	4445700	I haven't been doing any in the past month.
4445700	4446700	That's not that long.
4446700	4448700	Yeah, I was playing D&D.
4448700	4449700	Very cool.
4449700	4453200	All right, well, Footy, thanks so much for the input and for the game suggestions.
4453200	4456700	You've been full of game suggestions lately, from the Hannah Montana DS to this.
4456700	4460200	I got to spread the Hannah Montana love. It's awesome.
4460200	4463700	You better be calling back in a couple weeks and telling us about the next game we all need to be playing.
4463700	4466700	Oh, that reminds me, Loki, do not buy Jam Sessions.
4466700	4470700	I have the Japanese version. It's not good. It's not good.
4470700	4472700	It's cheap though.
4472700	4474200	It really is.
4474200	4475700	Loki likes cheap.
4475700	4479700	I'm not buying Hannah Montana. I can tell you that much.
4479700	4481700	I will buy Hannah Montana.
4481700	4483700	All right, you do that.
4483700	4485700	All right, bye, Footy Monster. Thanks for the call.
4485700	4486700	Talk to you later, guys.
4486700	4492700	All right, if you want to give us a call or use the name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR,
4492700	4494700	and let me take this opportunity to remind you guys.
4494700	4498700	You've probably heard Raven on the show before and Footy Monster on the show before.
4498700	4500700	That's because they're actually calling in.
4500700	4504700	So if you want to call in and be on the show sometime, make sure you're actually listening to the program.
4504700	4506700	Sunday nights at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
4506700	4509700	Let's go back to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
4509700	4510700	GS68.
4510700	4512700	Hello, GS68. What's on your mind?
4512700	4517700	Oh, someone sent an email complaining that Heavenly Sword was too short, right?
4517700	4518700	Mm-hmm.
4518700	4525700	Well, when I was younger, game took less than an hour to complete. It had no save points.
4525700	4530700	So people are saying that Heavenly Sword is too short of a game.
4530700	4532700	Yeah, 10 hours.
4532700	4538700	10 hours isn't that short. 10 hours is about how long it took to beat Silent Hill 2, and that's a beautiful game.
4538700	4544700	So, you know, I don't think it's such a bad thing that the games are necessarily short, as long as it's fun.
4544700	4548700	You're right. Like, a lot of those old-school NES games, like, they were really good.
4548700	4553700	Like, God, I could probably beat Super Mario Brothers in, like, 15 minutes, if that.
4553700	4558700	Yeah, or Mario 2. I just got that on Virtual Console, and that's like a 15-minute game if you know all the power-ups and stuff.
4558700	4565700	But it's part of the, is it fun to replay over and over again, because a game like Super Mario Brothers 2, hell yeah, it's fun to play over and over again, so.
4565700	4572700	It's really short. I mean, you can beat it in under two hours, and there are people who play it over and over again.
4572700	4580700	Yeah. So, hey, you know, a game is all about fun, you know, but considering how much they're charging for these games,
4580700	4586700	if it is only a 10-hour game, it better be a really fun 10-hour game, like six bucks an hour good.
4586700	4591700	But if you think about it, I mean, hell, they charge $10 for an hour and a half movie, so why not?
4591700	4593700	Yeah.
4593700	4596700	Now, are you buying Heavenly Sword, Loki?
4596700	4598700	Maybe.
4598700	4600700	Are you buying it, GS68?
4600700	4604700	No, I don't really have much interest in games like those.
4604700	4608700	I'll probably give it a rent, since I can rent for free.
4608700	4612700	There you go. Here's one of those rent-before-you-buy things.
4612700	4615700	Maybe you'll rent it and beat it, and then wonder, do I want to play this again?
4615700	4618700	What money is it out of my pocket?
4618700	4620700	All right.
4620700	4622700	If it's free, I'll do almost anything.
4622700	4624700	Tigerclaw has an interesting point.
4624700	4629700	I hate games that force you to play on a hard difficulty just to see the better ending.
4629700	4631700	Oh, no kidding.
4631700	4637700	If it's normal, then I don't mind, because in my opinion, if it's easy difficulty, you're a pussy.
4637700	4642700	But I don't really do hard mode a lot on games.
4642700	4648700	There was a Star Wars game on N64 that you couldn't even see the ending unless you got to the ending and it's all,
4648700	4651700	to see the ending played in hard mode, I was like, fuck you.
4651700	4654700	Here's the thing, though.
4654700	4656700	Oh, shoot.
4656700	4659700	It was like the only Star Wars. No, it was other than Rogue Squadron.
4659700	4663700	Yeah, the one that wasn't Rogue Squadron. It was the one where you play the guy.
4663700	4665700	I have that game.
4665700	4668700	Here's the thing, though. I think those subtle ending differences are pretty cool.
4668700	4672700	I go back all the way to the original Metroid.
4672700	4677700	When you played it the first time, it probably took you forever and a day to actually beat it, and so you got the crappy ending.
4677700	4686700	But then somebody at school tells you, hey, if you play it really fast, then you get to see the chick take all her clothes off.
4686700	4688700	Which is people stretching the truth a little bit.
4688700	4692700	But who didn't run home and play through the game just as fast as they could to see if there was that other ending in it?
4692700	4694700	I know I did.
4694700	4698700	There you go, C.
4698700	4703700	I tried to get under three hours in Super Metroid, not just for the accomplishment, but because of, you know.
4703700	4708700	Or even the games with all the different multiple endings, if you did things a different way or did it the harder way, like Chrono Trigger.
4708700	4715700	You start off, if you do save game plus and start off and just beat Lavos right away, you get the developer ending.
4715700	4717700	That was pretty cool.
4717700	4722700	Yeah, stuff like that's really cool.
4722700	4724700	Those did Airspace, apparently.
4724700	4726700	Sorry, I was reading stuff.
4726700	4729700	Okay, so anything else you want to share with our listeners, DS68?
4729700	4733700	Yeah, I finally got around to playing 2DX Distorted on PS2.
4733700	4735700	And what'd you think?
4735700	4737700	It's pretty good.
4737700	4751700	I haven't played any, well, I don't have any 2DX between 9th and 13th styles, so there's a lot of features that are new to me, like all the score data from the arcade and such.
4751700	4755700	Yeah, I haven't bought a 2DX game since 9th style either, but I did play a lot of Red.
4755700	4757700	I don't know, we'll see.
4757700	4760700	I'm kind of over a lot of those Konami music games, I have to admit.
4760700	4765700	It's the same fucking thing for like five years now, so I'm ready for something new.
4765700	4768700	So when Konami's ready to give me something new, I'll go back.
4768700	4771700	Or, you know, I do still buy the new DDR games on consoles.
4771700	4782700	Because, you know, Universe and the Xbox DERs have felt really new to me, and hell, I still think, what is it, UltraMix 2 is like the best DDR game they've put out in any country on a console.
4782700	4785700	I got tired of playing DDR at home.
4785700	4788700	Yeah, it's not the same. I'll give you that.
4788700	4791700	All right, well, DS68, thanks so much for the call, we appreciate it, okay?
4791700	4793700	All right, later buddy.
4793700	4796700	All right, that's actually going to do it tonight for the Skype line.
4796700	4803700	We're actually running way over tonight, thanks to all the craziness, so we're actually going to wrap things up with some last minute stories.
4803700	4805700	Does anybody have some quick last minute stories?
4805700	4808700	I have some things I forgot to mention during the release dates.
4808700	4813700	There's a game that apparently was coming out on PC called 30,000 Games.
4813700	4817700	I don't know what it is, but I know there's 30,000 of them.
4817700	4821700	And I say, for $19.99, that's a pretty damn good deal.
4821700	4827700	Anyways, sorry, I wasn't ready for that yet. My bad.
4827700	4829700	Okey-dokey.
4829700	4832700	I've been having all sorts of sound boo-boos tonight.
4832700	4839700	Anyways, one thing I was going to mention, South Park did win the Emmy for World of Warcraft episodes.
4839700	4842700	This is actually Loki's new theme music.
4847700	4849700	Okay, I have news.
4849700	4854700	That, by the way, was Super Mario RPG in Mario Paint. That's what that was.
4854700	4858700	Sega's game, The Club, will not be out for Christmas, by the way.
4858700	4863700	It's going to be out early 2008 for PC, PS3, and Xbox 360.
4863700	4867700	This is perfect for what we've been talking about.
4867700	4880700	Anyways, apparently you can buy unicorns in Second Life. There's just one small little issue that they forgot to mention.
4880700	4888700	In order to obtain a unicorn, you have to have sex with an adult unicorn in Second Life.
4893700	4896700	What is that from?
4896700	4899700	It's Super Mario RPG.
4899700	4903700	Yeah, Rama sent me all these YouTubage things.
4903700	4909700	The username is TomBobBlender has made all these YouTubes of all these songs in Mario Paint.
4909700	4911700	It's good times.
4911700	4913700	I remember the little kitty and doggy noises. That's great.
4913700	4916700	Anyways, what it says basically, it says,
4916700	4922700	Someone on Second Life is offering tiny, adorable baby unicorns that you can hold and cuddle, but they come with a price.
4922700	4929700	You can only get them by having sex with an adult unicorn located at the Belle Highland Sim.
4929700	4932700	Deal or no deal.
4932700	4934700	How can a unicorn get a baby?
4934700	4937700	Apparently there's a website here that has not...
4937700	4940700	Oh, yeah, that's interesting.
4940700	4943700	Oh, God.
4943700	4947700	That is special.
4947700	4950700	Where's the baby unicorn?
4950700	4954700	Does it really matter?
4954700	4958700	I don't know. There's some weird shit on this website.
4958700	4962700	I don't even know what that is, but it's some sort of insect having sex with somebody.
4962700	4965700	God, Second Life is awesome.
4965700	4967700	And by awesome you mean scary.
4967700	4970700	Yes. Anything else for last minute stories tonight?
4970700	4973700	Sell everything and get a Wii.
4973700	4976700	Try First Life. It's great.
4976700	4980700	Okay, you done?
4980700	4986700	There's some cool Office Depot, I guess, bundle for the Xbox 360 for $2.99.
4986700	4989700	You get the premium system, so that might be worth it.
4989700	4992700	I don't know.
4992700	4995700	That's it.
4995700	4998700	Well, that is going to do it tonight for Orange Launch Radio, you guys.
4998700	5001700	I want to thank everybody for tuning into and listening to Orange Launch Radio tonight
5001700	5003700	and supporting independent radio.
5003700	5005700	We really appreciate it, you guys. You guys are awesome.
5005700	5009700	And by the way, I want my voice back for next week.
5009700	5015700	One, I also want to say a big thank you to all those of you guys who have left five-star reviews on iTunes recently
5015700	5018700	on our podcast page on iTunes, because that's pretty awesome.
5018700	5021700	There's been some pretty great reviews written.
5021700	5026700	Of course, people like to use the little in-jokes from the show in their reviews, and we certainly appreciate that.
5026700	5028700	But then sometimes people just write things that are generally pretty cool,
5028700	5032700	and I want to give a moment to actually read one of these on the air, one of the more recent ones.
5032700	5038700	And then hopefully that will encourage folks to maybe leave more, because we love five-star reviews and it inflates our egos.
5038700	5040700	This Robert H.M. guy wrote,
5040700	5045700	Named for popular Bamani artist Orange Lounge, this show, situated in San Francisco,
5045700	5051700	does an outstanding job of being an intelligent, intricate look into what is reasonably current in video games.
5051700	5053700	As one of the foremost independent video game podcasts,
5053700	5057700	OLR, hosted by Sky Dark Soccer and Loki, continues to entertain with its rants,
5057700	5061700	the always low-key but questionable input by frequent guest Shane,
5061700	5066700	and more importantly, its attention to audience through the live chat during the show's Sunday night airing in the mailbag.
5066700	5069700	The hosts are wonderfully funny without setting out to create comedy.
5069700	5073700	Sometimes it just works best when the show breaks down in laughter.
5073700	5075700	Hope you like tonight's show.
5075700	5081700	Due to some bizarrely inappropriate comment, usually from Shane.
5081700	5082700	Go figure.
5082700	5084700	Highly recommended to video game fans of all ages.
5084700	5087700	Okay, make that relatively mature audiences, but still.
5087700	5089700	So thank you, Robert H.M., for that review.
5089700	5093700	And all the people who've left happy, fun reviews on iTunes.
5093700	5095700	Like MacMan, I see here.
5095700	5097700	Mayo Nation, even though I hate mayonnaise.
5097700	5100700	AJ Twist, Flaming, sure, your name got cut off.
5100700	5101700	Read some of the bad reviews.
5101700	5102700	And Blue Collar Murder.
5102700	5104700	You want to hear a bad review?
5104700	5106700	No, because that will encourage people to write bad reviews.
5106700	5108700	I don't want to write bad reviews.
5108700	5113700	No, if you wrote a bad review, then you don't get any attention on our program, sorry.
5113700	5115700	All right.
5115700	5116700	That's that.
5116700	5118700	So thank you guys very much for that.
5118700	5121700	And let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
5121700	5124700	Eddie, thank you for being here tonight and sticking with us through the whole show.
5124700	5127700	And staying away from Gattle Star Ballactica during the program.
5127700	5129700	Do you have any final thoughts?
5129700	5131700	Nice and fancy.
5131700	5132700	Indeed.
5132700	5136700	Dark Sakura, do you have any final thoughts tonight?
5136700	5138700	I actually have one other.
5138700	5139700	What?
5139700	5141700	Meh.
5141700	5147700	My final thought will be reject false icons and give me a dollar.
5147700	5152700	Tonight's final thought was just stolen from all of Jamie's past stuff.
5152700	5153700	Loki, your final thought.
5153700	5157700	My final thought, and I forgot to mention this during FAQs of the week.
5157700	5162700	Comcast for some reason, I don't know if you've noticed this, Rob, or if it's even an issue with your TV.
5162700	5166700	For some reason now, all the HD channels I get are not widescreen.
5166700	5170700	They're all boxed, like really small.
5170700	5171700	Mine are fine.
5171700	5173700	It's weird, because it just started doing that now.
5173700	5176700	Sounds like the user.
5176700	5180700	I say beat them up.
5180700	5182700	I say I'm switching to something else.
5182700	5183700	All right, there you go.
5183700	5187700	That's what more people need to do, because Comcast has been pissing me off a lot lately too.
5187700	5189700	Not because of that, but just their general service in general.
5189700	5191700	All right.
5191700	5195700	But we do love Comcast, because that is the internet that gets us out to you guys.
5195700	5197700	So thanks for that, Comcast.
5197700	5199700	All right, anyhow, that's it for this week's show.
5199700	5202700	Thank you once again for downloading and supporting independent radio.
5202700	5204700	We couldn't do it without you guys.
5204700	5205700	Hey, why don't we do it all again next week?
5205700	5207700	Sound good?
5207700	5209700	Yeah.
5209700	5214700	All right, until then, have a meh week, and we'll see you next time.
5214700	5219700	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
