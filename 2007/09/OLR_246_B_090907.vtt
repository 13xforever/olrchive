00:15.000 --> 00:19.500
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.500 --> 00:26.400
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. This is part B of our podcast, taped live on September 9th, 2007.

00:26.400 --> 00:31.300
And a lot of you guys have been giving us some feedback in our forums lately on orangeloungeradio.com

00:31.300 --> 00:36.100
on our forums that you guys want to see part B of the podcast a little bit sooner than you're seeing it today.

00:36.100 --> 00:40.800
So you will get the part B of our podcast a little bit sooner.

00:40.800 --> 00:46.400
Very soon we're going to change the order in which, well not the order, but the speed first.

00:46.400 --> 00:50.900
Yeah, you're not going to get part B first, but we'll change the speed in which we get the podcast out to you guys very soon.

00:50.900 --> 00:56.100
And we're going to be making some changes with episode 250, which is coming up very soon if you can believe it.

00:56.100 --> 00:59.100
Yikes. It's very, very soon.

00:59.100 --> 01:03.000
Alright. So, let's get back into some gaming news, shall we?

01:03.000 --> 01:07.100
Alright. We shall. So some interesting trademarks

01:07.100 --> 01:12.900
were made from Nintendo, and of course some things people wondering what they are,

01:12.900 --> 01:18.000
including a Wii body controller, which people are thinking is just the balance

01:18.000 --> 01:21.300
board or whatever it was called before because it wasn't the final name.

01:21.300 --> 01:28.300
Another one Wii handle, which could possibly be either a new controller or possibly something that has to do with, you know,

01:28.300 --> 01:30.800
your online name or something like that.

01:30.800 --> 01:36.900
Nintendo Magic, which unfortunately is going to be a DS game.

01:36.900 --> 01:39.100
It's to teach you how to do magic.

01:39.100 --> 01:45.100
And Mii Audition, which is supposed to be that everybody votes channel for, you know, your Miis.

01:45.100 --> 01:49.600
And then, that's it.

01:49.600 --> 01:53.900
So, also they renewed the Peekman trademark.

01:53.900 --> 01:56.500
So, maybe we'll see a new Peekman game for the Wii.

01:56.500 --> 02:00.500
And, yeah. So, that's it.

02:00.500 --> 02:05.600
I thought Nintendo Magic is what it's going to take for them to do some more online gaming.

02:05.600 --> 02:07.100
Some magic.

02:07.100 --> 02:11.700
No, actually the game already came out in Japan and it's coming out over here in November.

02:11.700 --> 02:15.900
So, it's like a teaching you magic game.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.900
Alright. Very cool.

02:17.900 --> 02:23.300
Well, there's actually a lot of third-party stuff going on with the Nintendo Wii.

02:23.300 --> 02:28.700
And this, of course, is if you want to listen to what Satoru Iwata, the president of Nintendo, has to say.

02:28.700 --> 02:33.100
Quote, I believe that third-party publishers kind of look at the software titles that are being sold on Nintendo.

02:33.100 --> 02:35.600
They don't want Nintendo to have more than one-third.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.200
Otherwise, Nintendo will be too strong.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.300
They want to have two-thirds of what's being sold on the platform.

02:40.300 --> 02:43.600
I believe that the job of first-party software is to drive hardware.

02:43.600 --> 02:47.800
If you don't have a quick impact and a quick dissemination amongst the audience, you lose momentum.

02:47.800 --> 02:51.200
If you don't have momentum, the third-parties don't want to jump on your platform.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.000
So, that's not a good situation to be in.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.600
It's interesting because a lot of people have been paralleling what's going on with the Wii here to the Nintendo DS,

02:59.600 --> 03:03.900
where there wasn't a lot of stuff available for the DS when it first came out.

03:03.900 --> 03:06.900
It took a long time for the titles to really start coming in.

03:06.900 --> 03:10.200
And even Satoru Iwata is aware of this.

03:10.200 --> 03:15.100
Quote, the same thing that happened to the Wii, a lot of the same conversations took place when the DS was launched.

03:15.100 --> 03:20.700
And that's because Nintendo was really the only one that was very focused on that user expansion goal we've talked about so often,

03:20.700 --> 03:23.700
and because we are creating unique software that no one else is creating.

03:23.700 --> 03:26.800
The phenomenon of Nintendo software selling was insane.

03:26.800 --> 03:29.100
Hmm. Kind of interesting there.

03:29.100 --> 03:35.300
Where do you think the future lies for Nintendo as far as the third-party softwares go, and what's in the future for us?

03:35.300 --> 03:44.500
Well, hopefully people will exhaust the stupid ports that they're going to make, and we actually get some better games.

03:44.500 --> 03:50.000
We really need new, innovative, original content.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.100
I guess I can agree with both of that.

03:52.100 --> 03:57.200
And Nintendo, I think, needs to open up a bit more of those little things they like to sit on

03:57.200 --> 04:00.200
and then announce later when their own stuff comes out,

04:00.200 --> 04:04.900
need to make things more available to the other developers, I think.

04:04.900 --> 04:06.100
I would certainly agree with that.

04:06.100 --> 04:10.800
So they need to open up the online stuff a little faster, and the DS connectivity, you know,

04:10.800 --> 04:15.100
even though I guess they kind of did that with PokÃ©mon, is, you know, more. Open that up a little more.

04:15.100 --> 04:17.400
We need more, please.

04:17.400 --> 04:23.300
Well, another very interesting development is that

04:23.300 --> 04:28.300
Harvey Birdman, Attorney-at-Law, is coming to the Wii in November.

04:28.300 --> 04:29.600
That looks hilarious.

04:29.600 --> 04:33.500
But it's actually being put out by Capcom,

04:33.500 --> 04:38.900
and it's going to be, and I quote, a fully animated interactive adventure game.

04:38.900 --> 04:43.500
So, um, maybe it's going to be fun?

04:43.500 --> 04:46.700
Think of Phoenix Wright, but just with the Cartoon Network humor, it's hilarious.

04:46.700 --> 04:51.900
And there's, like, they showed one video of it where, like, I guess Guile is in the stands,

04:51.900 --> 04:55.000
and some woman's, like, rubbing his nipples or something.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.800
It was really weird stuff.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.500
But it's, like, it's hilarious.

04:58.500 --> 05:02.100
It's Phoenix Wright, but just not taking itself seriously at all.

05:02.100 --> 05:04.900
I would like to say I saw that at Comic-Con this year,

05:04.900 --> 05:08.500
and what little I played of it was really crappy.

05:08.500 --> 05:11.500
Well, then again, Phoenix Wright doesn't really take itself very seriously.

05:11.500 --> 05:14.700
Did you see the pun that they put in the last Phoenix Wright game?

05:14.700 --> 05:16.200
No, I don't play those games.

05:16.200 --> 05:19.300
Oh, it was, they did this as Sparta.

05:19.300 --> 05:20.300
It was, like, crazy.

05:20.300 --> 05:24.300
Wow, this is not, this is totally original!

05:24.300 --> 05:27.700
This is Sparta!

05:27.700 --> 05:30.500
300, I get it.

05:30.500 --> 05:33.700
Anyways, something that is totally original,

05:33.700 --> 05:39.500
a game by Square Enix that's not featuring any Final Fantasy characters.

05:39.500 --> 05:43.500
Wait, how can this, is there any Dragon Quest characters in it?

05:43.500 --> 05:46.300
Uh, I don't think so.

05:46.300 --> 05:46.900
Star Ocean!

05:46.900 --> 05:48.500
Is it Tales of Blank?

05:48.500 --> 05:49.500
Blank of Mana?

05:49.500 --> 05:50.100
What is it?

05:50.100 --> 05:51.700
It is a puzzle game.

05:51.700 --> 05:55.300
So, hooray!

05:55.300 --> 05:59.900
Well, you know what, you joke about,

05:59.900 --> 06:05.300
Ergeist II, please? No, it's not Ergeist II, that would be fucking awesome, though, seriously.

06:05.300 --> 06:09.300
I would kill for another Ergeist, that would be great.

06:09.300 --> 06:13.100
No, we need, if they have Einhander, they need Zweihander

06:13.100 --> 06:15.100
as the sequel. Two-handed.

06:15.100 --> 06:18.500
No, it's going to be a game called Josumen,

06:18.500 --> 06:24.100
and it's a web puzzler in which you arrange blocks into squares

06:24.100 --> 06:26.400
and rectangles and destroy them.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.300
Wow, that sounds like every other puzzle game.

06:29.300 --> 06:30.500
Ever.

06:30.500 --> 06:33.500
No, but seriously, though, I mean, at least they're kind of making something a little different.

06:33.500 --> 06:36.900
I remember, was it, um, there's going to be the, uh,

06:36.900 --> 06:43.000
Puzzle Day Harvest Moon coming out in October, so it's like, ooh.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.500
Um, Dark Tetsuya says,

06:44.500 --> 06:48.800
What they don't tell you is that Cloud and Sephiroth are unlockable characters.

06:48.800 --> 06:54.300
That comment coming from our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

06:54.300 --> 06:57.000
Whatever, Sephiroth, Sephiroth, whatever, I don't care.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.400
Who cares? Overplayed, that's his name. Overplayed.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.200
Tomato, tomato.

07:01.200 --> 07:02.700
Uh, and Druunami says,

07:02.700 --> 07:04.500
Tales of blank is Namco Bandai.

07:04.500 --> 07:07.700
You know, that's true, and yet I said it anyway, and I knew that.

07:07.700 --> 07:09.500
It's weird.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.900
Like I said, I'm broken tonight, remember?

07:11.900 --> 07:13.600
It's because of all the cocaine you've been doing.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.000
Apparently.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.100
I don't do drugs, that's not cool.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.900
All right, but what is cool is the Virtual Console,

07:20.900 --> 07:25.300
and what's really, really super cool, Donkey Kong Jr. Math.

07:25.300 --> 07:28.900
That made, you know I actually had a Donkey Kong Jr. Math cartridge, go figure.

07:28.900 --> 07:33.900
Uh, but I, I saw it for like two bucks once, and I thought, ooh, this'll be a collector's item Sunday.

07:33.900 --> 07:34.800
Yeah, I was wrong.

07:34.800 --> 07:38.400
But anyway, Donkey Kong Jr. Math has made its way to the Virtual Console this week.

07:38.400 --> 07:41.800
I guess you could say it was part of like a whole back to school type thing,

07:41.800 --> 07:45.700
because it did come out, of course it's 500 points for Donkey Kong Jr. Math, which by the way,

07:45.700 --> 07:47.900
way too much money for Donkey Kong Jr. Math.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.900
Here, I have a suggestion for you guys.

07:49.900 --> 07:51.400
Here's what you should do.

07:51.400 --> 07:56.500
For, you know, 500 points or five bucks, you could buy Donkey Kong Jr. Math.

07:56.500 --> 07:59.000
Yeah, that may sound like a good deal for you, but how about this?

07:59.000 --> 08:03.100
Spend just a little bit more money, buy Animal Crossing for the GameCube,

08:03.100 --> 08:07.200
and guess what, look, you've got a bunch of Virtual Console games right there.

08:07.200 --> 08:10.500
By the way, Animal Crossing is one of those backwards compatible games as well, right?

08:10.500 --> 08:15.700
Exactly, and um, it's probably around 20 bucks right now, if not cheaper.

08:15.700 --> 08:19.000
Goddamn, I can't wait for Animal Crossing Wii.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
Even if the DS one was a little bit disappointing, because it was kind of the same thing,

08:22.000 --> 08:26.500
like I really hope they kind of like change it up and make Animal Crossing Wii just awesome.

08:26.500 --> 08:34.600
You know what, I was actually using the Japanese GameCube one as a training tool to help me read better,

08:34.600 --> 08:38.800
because it doesn't use any kanji except for like really simple ones,

08:38.800 --> 08:43.400
and they say, you know how they say every letter?

08:43.400 --> 08:45.500
And so when they talk it sounds like...

08:45.500 --> 08:50.400
It still sounds that way, but you can actually hear a little bit more of it like they're actually saying it.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.000
Right.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.900
And so I found it actually to be very educational,

08:54.900 --> 08:59.200
and I kind of hope that they'd have like a language mode in the release that we get.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.500
I think that'd be a good idea.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.100
You never know, it might happen.

09:02.100 --> 09:03.600
Be very cool.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.300
Also, I want to point out what also came out on the Virtual Console,

09:06.300 --> 09:09.400
Adventure Island, which was one of the very first NES games I ever owned.

09:09.400 --> 09:13.300
Adventure Island is also out, and if you want to hop over to the Genesis,

09:13.300 --> 09:15.800
Landstalker, The Treasures of King Knoll,

09:15.800 --> 09:19.900
as well as Bonk 3, Bonk's Big Adventure on the TurboGrafx-16.

09:19.900 --> 09:21.900
Just a note for those of you guys listening on the podcast,

09:21.900 --> 09:24.600
this would be last week's releases by the time you guys hear this,

09:24.600 --> 09:26.200
but for our live listeners on Sunday,

09:26.200 --> 09:30.000
that's all the stuff that came out for you guys this week.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.100
By the way, also, we have a very important message from SSJ100Matt in our chat room right now.

09:35.100 --> 09:39.700
Apparently there's one of those character battles going on on gamefacts.com right now,

09:39.700 --> 09:40.900
and it should be noted now.

09:40.900 --> 09:43.800
Again, this only really will work for those of you guys on Sunday night,

09:43.800 --> 09:46.200
but it should be noted that our beloved,

09:46.200 --> 09:48.400
one of our favorite game characters of all time,

09:48.400 --> 09:51.300
Pyramid Head is in the running right now in the character battle,

09:51.300 --> 09:53.700
and Pyramid Head needs more votes.

09:53.700 --> 09:56.700
He's up against Auron from Final Fantasy,

09:56.700 --> 09:59.000
Chris Redfield from, I believe, Resident Evil, right?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.900
And Shadow the Hedgehog from, of course, the Sonic series.

10:01.900 --> 10:04.200
But Pyramid Head needs your help,

10:04.200 --> 10:06.200
so please go vote for Pyramid Head,

10:06.200 --> 10:09.000
or else we will send him to your house to rape you.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.400
That's all.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.800
I voted.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.600
Did you vote for Pyramid Head?

10:15.600 --> 10:16.600
I am very proud of you.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.100
That's all I have to say on Virtual Console,

10:18.100 --> 10:19.200
and go vote Pyramid Head.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.800
I have things to say on Virtual Console.

10:20.800 --> 10:21.900
Well, isn't that nice?

10:21.900 --> 10:23.400
It's all Sega.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.400
Sega, Sega, Sega, Sega, Sega,

10:25.400 --> 10:28.600
or in this case for the UK, Mega.

10:28.600 --> 10:29.600
Mega Drive Games.

10:29.600 --> 10:34.300
We have Sonic the Hedgehog 3, which is really good.

10:34.300 --> 10:38.000
And then one of my personal favorites, Ghouls and Ghosts,

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
which is really still freaking hard even to this day,

10:41.000 --> 10:42.700
because it's like, let's play Ghouls and Ghosts,

10:42.700 --> 10:44.400
blah, blah, blah, beat Satan.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.200
Oh, I have to play again.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.200
Shit.

10:47.200 --> 10:51.400
So that's, by the way, Ghouls and Ghosts in a nutshell.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.000
And then we have E-Swat, City Under Siege,

10:54.000 --> 10:57.600
which actually is a game that Dan and I played a little bit of.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.800
Could be like E-Swat for some reason.

10:59.800 --> 11:05.600
And then we have Shining in the Darkness, which is an OK game.

11:05.600 --> 11:13.800
And then there was Crackdown.

11:13.800 --> 11:14.800
I don't remember that.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.800
You know, I really need to go back and play some more Crackdown.

11:16.800 --> 11:19.800
I remember the Crackdown that came out on 360 a little while ago.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.800
This is two words, Crackdown.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.800
Oh, that's an old-ass game.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.400
And maybe it had a different name over here.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.000
I don't know.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Why is it that the folks in the UK get completely different releases?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.600
Why don't they just make it the same for everybody?

11:30.600 --> 11:34.000
You have to save the world from evil cyborgs and then bomb them.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.300
That's kind of cool.

11:35.300 --> 11:37.600
But just to let our listeners overseas know,

11:37.600 --> 11:39.600
they are 800 points apiece,

11:39.600 --> 11:44.500
translated to 5 pounds 60 and 8 euros.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.800
So there you go.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.800
All right, check it out if you're in the UK

11:48.800 --> 11:52.200
and need some more virtual console games.

11:52.200 --> 11:55.300
Now to kind of switch gears to something a little different.

11:55.300 --> 11:59.400
Square Enix was saying that PlayStation 3

11:59.400 --> 12:02.200
needs their marketing to be straightened up.

12:02.200 --> 12:05.400
And I think basically referring to,

12:05.400 --> 12:08.800
this is kind of going back to the stories we were talking about in part A

12:08.800 --> 12:13.400
where they were calling it a computer,

12:13.400 --> 12:18.400
strictly a home media center or something like that.

12:18.400 --> 12:22.000
Because basically according to Wada,

12:22.000 --> 12:24.600
he says, Sony first unveiled the PlayStation 3

12:24.600 --> 12:26.800
as a mighty home electronics product.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.400
Then after some badgering from game companies,

12:29.400 --> 12:33.800
it shifted the position of the console closer to a game machine.

12:33.800 --> 12:37.600
The future of the PlayStation 3 would be tough

12:37.600 --> 12:40.700
if its marketing strategy is not straightened up.

12:40.700 --> 12:44.500
And to be honest, I can kind of agree with him a little bit.

12:44.500 --> 12:47.700
If you've seen any of the marketing that they've done

12:47.700 --> 12:52.800
in the UK, especially with this is living,

12:52.800 --> 12:56.200
it makes no fucking sense whatsoever.

12:56.200 --> 13:00.500
And even now, I remember the first commercials that came out for the PlayStation 3

13:00.500 --> 13:03.600
with the crying baby doll and weird shit like that,

13:03.600 --> 13:05.000
it made no fucking sense.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.500
Luckily now though, they show gameplay during their commercials

13:08.500 --> 13:09.900
and just kind of leave it at that.

13:09.900 --> 13:11.400
That is what they need to be doing.

13:11.400 --> 13:14.000
So it sounds like they're kind of smartening up a little bit,

13:14.000 --> 13:19.800
but my god, do not fucking let the people that did the advertising campaign in the UK

13:19.800 --> 13:21.200
get a hold of anything.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.400
In fact, they should all be fired.

13:22.400 --> 13:25.600
Or the people that did the All I Want for Xmas is at PSP.com?

13:25.600 --> 13:26.900
Yeah.

13:26.900 --> 13:29.200
Yeah, all fired. Good stuff.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.800
They all should be sacked.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.000
And then the people that sacked them will be sacked as well.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.400
And then they'll do them again at great expense with llamas.

13:36.400 --> 13:39.900
Alright, well, moving on to something.

13:39.900 --> 13:42.600
And now for something completely different, so to speak.

13:42.600 --> 13:43.800
This is how not to be seen.

13:43.800 --> 13:48.600
There was of course big announcements in the nerd world this week from Apple.

13:48.600 --> 13:51.200
And Apple is launching just in time for the holiday season.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.400
They are launching all sorts of new crap.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.000
Basically now they have an iPhone without the phone,

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
which they're calling the new iPod.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.200
They are also releasing a classic iPod.

14:01.200 --> 14:04.000
But what should be noted and what the hell this has to do with gaming

14:04.000 --> 14:06.400
is a new iPod Nano that's coming out.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.200
The new iPod Nano has a little bit more of a wider screen.

14:09.200 --> 14:12.600
And what should also be noted is that not only does the Nano have this,

14:12.600 --> 14:15.000
but the classics ship with this as well.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.500
Some games.

14:16.500 --> 14:19.300
Yes, some games will actually be included with these.

14:19.300 --> 14:23.300
The games will be included Vortex, iQuiz, and Klondike.

14:23.300 --> 14:26.700
iQuiz and Klondike I believe have been available on the store for a little while.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.200
I think Vortex might have been as well.

14:28.200 --> 14:33.400
Vortex is basically like a 3D version of Arkanoid or Breakout, if you will.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.800
Where basically you move the paddle.

14:34.800 --> 14:37.000
And I think that's a pretty creative use of the wheel.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.200
Is that you actually move the little wheel around, which moves the paddle around.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.800
And it's like Breakout.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.800
You're breaking bricks towards the center of the screen.

14:45.800 --> 14:46.800
So, kind of cool.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.400
I played a whole crap ton of Arkanoid back in the day.

14:49.400 --> 14:50.100
Yeah, back in the day.

14:50.100 --> 14:54.400
So, this is kind of interesting and brings to note that,

14:54.400 --> 15:00.000
especially with the release of the iPod without the phone or whatever you want to call it.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.200
It's kind of interesting that Apple does seem to be getting their...

15:03.200 --> 15:06.800
They're sticking their foot in there a little more and more with this whole gaming thing.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.300
And I don't think it's time to say like,

15:08.300 --> 15:12.200
OMG, Apple's going to release a gaming console because we all remember Pippin.

15:12.200 --> 15:16.200
But I think that it's interesting to see, especially when it comes to...

15:16.200 --> 15:18.200
You remember the Pippin?

15:18.200 --> 15:21.200
I completely shoved that out of my head.

15:21.200 --> 15:25.000
I think it would be interesting to see what kind of happens with the whole like,

15:25.000 --> 15:27.200
you know, especially with like classic games.

15:30.200 --> 15:31.400
I'll just tell you...

15:31.400 --> 15:32.600
Sandwich smells.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.200
Get it out of here.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.600
Mmm, sandwich.

15:36.600 --> 15:37.200
Sorry, Eddie.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.400
You can come back when the sandwich is gone.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.400
Here's an old system name that will make you laugh, Rob.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.200
What's that?

15:42.200 --> 15:44.200
Game.com.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.200
Wow.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.400
I have one.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.400
Really?

15:48.400 --> 15:49.400
Yes.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.400
Then again, I also had an N-Gage and we gave it away.

15:52.400 --> 15:55.400
You have a lot of like weird consoles.

15:55.400 --> 15:59.400
So, you also have a lot of weird emails this week, I bet.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.400
Oh, God.

16:00.400 --> 16:03.400
And of course, we always invite our listeners to email us at our website.

16:03.400 --> 16:05.400
Mailbag at orangelonserator.com.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.400
I want one of these, Rob.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.400
And send us some emails.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.400
This is adorable.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.400
What things?

16:09.400 --> 16:10.400
I want one of these iPod things.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.400
Which ones?

16:11.400 --> 16:13.400
The little one with the square looking one.

16:13.400 --> 16:14.400
The Nanos or the...

16:14.400 --> 16:15.400
Is that the Nano?

16:15.400 --> 16:17.400
I actually kind of want an iPhone.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.400
Yeah, that's a Nano.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.400
That's cute.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.400
I actually kind of want an iPhone now that they dropped in price.

16:21.400 --> 16:22.400
We'll say that another day.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.400
Let's do the emails.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.400
Okay.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.400
Mailbag at orangelonserator.com.

16:25.400 --> 16:29.400
Dark Sakura will now open up the mailbag and read a few of her favorites.

16:29.400 --> 16:33.400
At least I'll read a few of the ones that actually have substance to them.

16:33.400 --> 16:34.400
And I'm sorry, Misty.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.400
I did get both of yours.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.400
I'm very sorry that you have to work.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.400
Really sorry.

16:39.400 --> 16:42.400
This one's from our friend, Rob with two Bs.

16:42.400 --> 16:46.400
I read in Nintendo Power the next version of William's classic pinball will include

16:46.400 --> 16:52.400
Gorgar, the first talkie, Black Knight, which inspired David's midnight magic, and Pinbot.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.400
Hooray.

16:53.400 --> 16:57.400
I'm hoping for Z and B to be the flippers for the nunchuck.

16:57.400 --> 17:00.400
And my two bits on Space Giraffe.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.400
Bit one.

17:01.400 --> 17:05.400
I love the arcade's style play and similarity to Tempest 2000.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.400
Bit two.

17:06.400 --> 17:10.400
The blurry visuals are sort of low res and the game's LSD inspired visuals seem to be

17:10.400 --> 17:13.400
there to make the game harder.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.400
It's not as good as Tempest, I'm afraid.

17:15.400 --> 17:19.400
I'd much rather have a crisp vector display than a trippy, blurry, inferior graphic.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.400
At least it was $5 and not $10.

17:21.400 --> 17:24.400
It should also carry an epileptic seizure warning.

17:24.400 --> 17:26.400
I bought it, but I haven't really played it much.

17:26.400 --> 17:27.400
Boredom get.

17:27.400 --> 17:28.400
And one last topic.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.400
PS3 pricing.

17:29.400 --> 17:32.400
The original price was intended for the hardcore gamer.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.400
Not many people wanted it.

17:33.400 --> 17:37.400
It was priced too high for resale on eBay and it was readily available in mid-December.

17:37.400 --> 17:41.400
Did Sony effectively kill the third party market for initial PS3 games?

17:41.400 --> 17:44.400
Did they actually get the money that the eBayers would have gotten?

17:44.400 --> 17:48.400
It's an interesting thought because the answers to both seem to be yes.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.400
They still didn't stop the stabbings and shootings, but I don't blame them for that.

17:51.400 --> 17:54.400
See you later, Rob Bubba.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.400
I like hearing from Rob.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.400
It's been a little while, so.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.400
I actually am really looking forward to this whole pinball game that's going to be on the

18:00.400 --> 18:01.400
Wii that he talked about at the very beginning.

18:01.400 --> 18:02.400
Pinball.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.400
Like, pin-bot and stuff.

18:04.400 --> 18:14.400
I would like to see a reincarnation of the old school pin-bot on the NES as an optional

18:14.400 --> 18:17.400
mode where you could actually have the little aliens come out on the table and try to eat

18:17.400 --> 18:20.400
your ball and all the crazy shit they had on the NES version of the game.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.400
You know what?

18:21.400 --> 18:22.400
What?

18:22.400 --> 18:26.400
Right now our NES is hooked up with pin-bot in it.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.400
That is rad.

18:28.400 --> 18:33.400
Of course, also hooked up to the same receiver is our PS2 with Guitar Hero.

18:33.400 --> 18:34.400
Nice.

18:34.400 --> 18:35.400
Yeah.

18:35.400 --> 18:36.400
Anyway.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.400
Many greetings, Orange Orange Radio.

18:38.400 --> 18:39.400
I'm a big fan of your show.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.400
No, it's not that I like your show a lot.

18:41.400 --> 18:44.400
It's just that a lifetime of Doritos has made me very big.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.400
Wait, who is this?

18:45.400 --> 18:46.400
I'm only joking.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.400
Mr. Patch.

18:47.400 --> 18:48.400
Oh, okay.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.400
I love your show, but for about three months I lost you.

18:50.400 --> 18:55.400
Things really got hectic in my life and schedules got tight, so no time to tune into your show,

18:55.400 --> 18:56.400
but it lasts.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.400
About two months ago, I found you in my crazy life.

18:58.400 --> 19:01.400
I found time for you in my crazy life, and damn, I have been enjoying it.

19:01.400 --> 19:05.400
Anyway, I emailed you to ask you guys about Banjo 3E.

19:05.400 --> 19:10.400
I've emailed before about the Banjo series being on 360 in some form, and from that email

19:10.400 --> 19:12.400
I learned that you really didn't care for Banjo too much.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.400
No, not really.

19:13.400 --> 19:17.400
And I understand it's not the best game for some hardcore gamers, but for me, Banjo Kazooie

19:17.400 --> 19:19.400
really turned me into the gamer I am today.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.400
Anyways, finally, my question.

19:21.400 --> 19:26.400
Do you think Microsoft will push Banjo 3E when its release date comes near, or will

19:26.400 --> 19:29.400
it be a quiet release like some of the other Rare games?

19:29.400 --> 19:33.400
Thanks for taking the time to read this email, and thanks even more if you answer my question

19:33.400 --> 19:34.400
with curse words.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.400
Love, hey, Mr. Patch.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.400
Well, fuck.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.400
Well, listen here, you little fucker.

19:40.400 --> 19:41.400
No.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.400
With shit for brains?

19:42.400 --> 19:43.400
No, I'm kidding.

19:43.400 --> 19:44.400
Heart, heart, heart.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.400
No, we appreciate the email.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.400
Here it is.

19:46.400 --> 19:51.400
Yeah, I'm not the biggest fan of these games, but I think Microsoft will realize that there

19:51.400 --> 19:55.400
is a fan base for the games.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.400
Guys like you, you know?

19:57.400 --> 20:02.400
And I think they will for that reason definitely try to get it out there that, hey, it's back.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.400
Banjo Kazooie comes back.

20:04.400 --> 20:07.400
And I think you will see a little bit of a marketing campaign like that.

20:07.400 --> 20:13.400
I don't think it's going to be near the size that you would see for one of their AAA titles,

20:13.400 --> 20:16.400
but I don't see any reason why I won't get some notability.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.400
I don't think it'll be a quiet release by any means.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.400
There you go.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.400
I think of Banjo Kazooie, and for some reason I always think of Pandemonium.

20:23.400 --> 20:26.400
Do you remember that game, Rob?

20:26.400 --> 20:27.400
No.

20:27.400 --> 20:33.400
Pandemonium was a side-scrolling, very bizarre game, but I actually have the Japanese version

20:33.400 --> 20:37.400
of it, which was Magical Hoppers, and they re-pixeled it or whatever.

20:37.400 --> 20:40.400
But I don't know why, but it's always one of those...

20:40.400 --> 20:46.400
I always think of those very early PlayStation 1 games and the early Nintendo games, and

20:46.400 --> 20:51.400
every game that's come out since then that's in that franchise, like Spyro, I always lump

20:51.400 --> 20:56.400
them into that one category that I label, Why God?

20:56.400 --> 20:57.400
Why?

20:57.400 --> 21:02.400
SSJ100Matt in our chat room at chat.ornishonorsready.com says, Fuck Banjo.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.400
Give me a new fucking Killer Instincts.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.400
Ooh.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.400
Why so much love for Killer Instincts?

21:09.400 --> 21:11.400
Because I've also seen people with a lot of hate for Killer Instinct.

21:11.400 --> 21:17.400
Keep in mind, I played a shit ton of the first Killer Instinct when it...

21:17.400 --> 21:21.400
How many pounds in a shit ton?

21:21.400 --> 21:24.400
I'm going to give my homage to Don French right now.

21:24.400 --> 21:34.400
I played croc shits of Killer Instinct when I was in college, and KI2 was very exciting

21:34.400 --> 21:39.400
to me when it came out, except that I hated that they changed all of Orchid's moves.

21:39.400 --> 21:43.400
But it was very, very cool for me, and even to the point where Dan had it on his Super

21:43.400 --> 21:48.400
Nintendo when I lived in Alabama, to the point that he kept starting over and over until

21:48.400 --> 21:52.400
it started off with Orchid's level so he could copy the music for me.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.400
Isn't that romantic?

21:53.400 --> 21:54.400
That's very sweet.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.400
Anyway, next email.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.400
Aw, barf.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.400
Combo Breaker, next email please.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:01.400 --> 22:04.400
Oi Peeps, this is no Soul Boy.

22:04.400 --> 22:07.400
Alcohol and Tylenol can kill you.

22:07.400 --> 22:08.400
Prime 3.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.400
Oh yeah, you weren't here last week.

22:10.400 --> 22:14.400
I was actually, you know what I did last week?

22:14.400 --> 22:16.400
It was my anniversary.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.400
Weren't you seeing Weirdo?

22:18.400 --> 22:20.400
I did more than that.

22:20.400 --> 22:28.400
On Friday night, Dan and I hung out and did stuff on, well actually I hung out online

22:28.400 --> 22:32.400
and talked to people, and then Dan and I did a couple of things.

22:32.400 --> 22:37.400
Saturday we went to Benihana, and I drank a lot.

22:37.400 --> 22:43.400
And Sunday, I cracked open my bottle of Metaxa, which I was going to bring over, and you said

22:43.400 --> 22:44.400
you were sick.

22:44.400 --> 22:47.400
So I was like, I don't want to get sick, not on my anniversary, so I said I'm not going

22:47.400 --> 22:48.400
to hang out with Bob.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.400
It wasn't contagious, whatever it was.

22:50.400 --> 22:51.400
It's gone, thank God.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.400
Rob had the rocket pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu.

22:53.400 --> 22:58.400
Here's the thing, and I do want to apologize if I came off like an idiot, but I did say

22:58.400 --> 23:01.400
something about, I had been taking Tylenol because I was sick, and I was drinking because

23:01.400 --> 23:03.400
I don't care, and I said something like, it's not going to kill me.

23:03.400 --> 23:08.400
Here's the thing, I am not, obviously if you drink a lot and you take a lot of Tylenol,

23:08.400 --> 23:09.400
yes, that can kill you.

23:09.400 --> 23:13.400
I'm not stupid, and you know, I've seen a lot of kids do a lot of stupid things, unfortunately

23:13.400 --> 23:14.400
in my lifetime.

23:14.400 --> 23:18.400
But here's the thing, a little tiny bit, it wasn't that much Tylenol, it really wasn't,

23:18.400 --> 23:20.400
it wasn't that much liquor I drank last week either.

23:20.400 --> 23:26.400
I think little bits, like a lot of things, moderation is okay, overdoing it, not okay.

23:26.400 --> 23:29.400
So the more you know, NBC, there you go.

23:29.400 --> 23:30.400
Can I finish my email now?

23:30.400 --> 23:31.400
You may.

23:31.400 --> 23:36.400
Prime 3, you can die if you don't kill Meta Ridley in time.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.400
Yes, I suck, but give me a break.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.400
Second Wii game I ever played.

23:39.400 --> 23:44.400
I'm a Mac lover, but iPhones are for people with too much money and too much to do.

23:44.400 --> 23:49.400
Finished Bioshock, that part that scared me was when the Spicers started playing Dead.

23:49.400 --> 23:52.400
Oh, and also the huge room with the water on the floor and the plaster covered ballet

23:52.400 --> 23:54.400
dancers, very creepy.

23:54.400 --> 23:58.400
I listened to your podcast and Game Theory.

23:58.400 --> 24:02.400
As a designer, I'd really like to hear more about excellent game design as opposed to

24:02.400 --> 24:04.400
graphics or effects.

24:04.400 --> 24:11.400
For instance, on the DC Phantasy Star Online's UI and menu system, amazingly fluid and functional

24:11.400 --> 24:12.400
during gameplay.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.400
Hell yes!

24:13.400 --> 24:17.400
That was, you know, one of the biggest things that I hated about Phantasy Star Universe

24:17.400 --> 24:21.400
is that the menus in Phantasy Star Online were so much freaking better.

24:21.400 --> 24:23.400
Okay, so I'm going to keep going.

24:23.400 --> 24:28.400
Or for anyone who's ever played a squad game to compare it to the four player action in

24:28.400 --> 24:30.400
Crystal Chronicles on GameCube.

24:30.400 --> 24:35.400
People started working together in a way that is just genius and it's totally obvious that

24:35.400 --> 24:37.400
it was the intent of the designers.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.400
Or how about most of the games by Treasure?

24:39.400 --> 24:40.400
A-freaking-men.

24:40.400 --> 24:43.400
Talk about walking out on a limb and creating amazing experiences.

24:43.400 --> 24:47.400
These games are perfect arguments for the game as art debate.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.400
You know what?

24:49.400 --> 24:54.400
Treasure is just, okay, Treasure gave us Ikaruga.

24:54.400 --> 24:55.400
They gave us Bongio.

24:55.400 --> 24:56.400
I love Bongio.

24:56.400 --> 24:57.400
Oh my God.

24:57.400 --> 24:59.400
The game is so cool.

24:59.400 --> 25:07.400
They gave us Silhouette Mirage, which is just, it was, when it came out, it was like something

25:07.400 --> 25:11.400
nobody had ever seen, you know, no one had ever seen anything like that before.

25:11.400 --> 25:14.400
Even that dorky little chameleon twist game was cool.

25:14.400 --> 25:18.400
I mean, Treasure is all about the innovation in gameplay.

25:18.400 --> 25:22.400
You know, another game that you're talking about having people work together is Pac-Man

25:22.400 --> 25:31.400
vs. where you have three people on individual game, it's GBAs actually, or a Game Boy SP

25:31.400 --> 25:34.400
because of the connector that they use for it, but they control the ghost and you have

25:34.400 --> 25:36.400
your person as Pac-Man.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.400
You know, I got to hand it to the GameCube.

25:38.400 --> 25:43.400
Those games that had the connectivity between the DS and the GameCube were a heck of a

25:43.400 --> 25:44.400
lot of fun.

25:44.400 --> 25:47.400
Like the Four Swords Adventures, I had a lot of fun playing that game with some of my friends.

25:47.400 --> 25:54.400
It's kind of a shame because you see that potential available on the PlayStation 3 and

25:54.400 --> 25:58.400
the PSP and the whole Wii DS thing, you know, without needing everybody having to have a

25:58.400 --> 25:59.400
cable.

25:59.400 --> 26:00.400
Remember, that was the thing.

26:00.400 --> 26:03.400
It's like, sure, a lot of people had Crystal Chronicles, but nobody could play it the right

26:03.400 --> 26:07.400
way because you could never find enough of those damn cables to hook up your DS, or not

26:07.400 --> 26:10.400
your DS, your Game Boy to the system and everything.

26:10.400 --> 26:16.400
But, you know, a lot of people, a lot of people have a DS now these days, so it would be so

26:16.400 --> 26:20.400
easy to do something with the whole Wii and the Wi-Fi and kind of bring back those types

26:20.400 --> 26:21.400
of games.

26:21.400 --> 26:22.400
It would be awesome.

26:22.400 --> 26:27.400
Then you can do the touch and the motion and there's a lot of potential there that I'm

26:27.400 --> 26:29.400
hoping is explored in the next couple of years.

26:29.400 --> 26:30.400
Yes, Eddie's back.

26:30.400 --> 26:31.400
Hey, I'm back.

26:31.400 --> 26:34.400
Yeah, no, I agree because what I was thinking is that on a lot of those games it would be

26:34.400 --> 26:40.400
cool as if the DS was like a device in the game and like if it was like a spy sort of

26:40.400 --> 26:43.400
espionage game, like you would get like secret messages on your DS or something like that

26:43.400 --> 26:45.400
and it would, you know, light up or something like that.

26:45.400 --> 26:50.400
I think that would be cool, like you're saying, make it more like reality, you know, just

26:50.400 --> 26:51.400
make it really interactive with the game.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.400
I think that would be awesome.

26:53.400 --> 26:56.400
You know what else I thought was cool, kind of speaking of that, was that whole, you know,

26:56.400 --> 27:00.400
in a Red Steel, like you could, you'd put the Wii mode up to your ear because it has

27:00.400 --> 27:03.400
a speaker in there and it would tell you what your objective was, like, hey, you need to

27:03.400 --> 27:05.400
kill player three or whatever it is.

27:05.400 --> 27:06.400
That was lame.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.400
It sounded cool, but it was lame.

27:08.400 --> 27:09.400
I know.

27:09.400 --> 27:14.400
Unfortunately, the game turned out to be kind of dumb, but I think the idea was good and

27:14.400 --> 27:17.400
I can recognize that that was, you know, especially for a launch title, that was a pretty neat

27:17.400 --> 27:19.400
usage of the stuff.

27:19.400 --> 27:22.400
Because they could do that like if the phone's ringing in the game or something, like you

27:22.400 --> 27:25.400
put the Wii mode up to your ear or something like that and press A and then it's like,

27:25.400 --> 27:26.400
you know, they're talking on the phone.

27:26.400 --> 27:27.400
That'd be cool.

27:27.400 --> 27:29.400
Well, you can do that in WarioWare.

27:29.400 --> 27:30.400
That's one of the mini games.

27:30.400 --> 27:33.400
Yeah, you pick up the phone and then you hear it coming out the speaker and the Wii mode,

27:33.400 --> 27:34.400
hello, hello.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.400
It's really funny.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.400
That kind of little shit goes a long way.

27:38.400 --> 27:39.400
I love it.

27:39.400 --> 27:41.400
So, there you have it.

27:41.400 --> 27:42.400
All right.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.400
Sorry, that's my response to the email.

27:45.400 --> 27:48.400
I don't even know if that's what they were looking for, but there you have it.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.400
Um, okay.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.400
I'm adjusting.

27:52.400 --> 27:53.400
Wedgies?

27:53.400 --> 27:54.400
No.

27:54.400 --> 28:00.400
This chair's like sitting on, it's like the princess and the pea, you know, where you've

28:00.400 --> 28:02.400
got, hey.

28:02.400 --> 28:03.400
What?

28:03.400 --> 28:06.400
I'm asking where it would be in Tylenol.

28:06.400 --> 28:07.400
It's in the bathroom.

28:07.400 --> 28:09.400
Yeah, I believe I do.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.400
Yes, I'll go show you where the Tylenol is.

28:11.400 --> 28:12.400
Jamie reads more emails.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.400
Look at the left side of the cabinet.

28:14.400 --> 28:17.400
This chair's like the princess and the pea, you know, where you have all this cushion,

28:17.400 --> 28:20.400
but you feel that one lump that's like, I can't sit in this chair.

28:20.400 --> 28:21.400
That's it.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.400
Okay, princess.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.400
Next email.

28:23.400 --> 28:26.400
Hi to you, other lady folks.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.400
Wave.

28:27.400 --> 28:33.400
Anyway, I went to Project Revolution Tour here in Chicago and me and my friend got there

28:33.400 --> 28:34.400
around 1.30.

28:34.400 --> 28:38.400
I found out the band I really wanted to see, Linkin Park, wasn't playing until 9.30.

28:38.400 --> 28:45.400
So me and my friend hung out and walked around for a few hours and then we saw MSI, and that

28:45.400 --> 28:47.400
was cool.

28:47.400 --> 28:53.400
Now, upon walking around, I discovered a tent that had two long banners that just had three

28:53.400 --> 29:00.400
on them and believe, 9.25.07 at the bottom, you know, so I was like, do one and asked

29:00.400 --> 29:01.400
the two guys standing there if I could go in.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.400
They said that it was a private party.

29:03.400 --> 29:07.400
After this, I just kind of listened hard as much as you can at a rock concert, and I heard

29:07.400 --> 29:10.400
the distinctive noise of shields recharging.

29:10.400 --> 29:13.400
I knew I had to get in.

29:13.400 --> 29:18.400
That was before, as mindless self-indulgence, okay, I was like, hey, that's a band I like.

29:18.400 --> 29:24.800
Now, fast forward to the end of the MSI show, I went back to find the tent open with quite

29:24.800 --> 29:25.800
a few people inside.

29:25.800 --> 29:30.680
I stood there with a few other people and knew I was going to get in somehow.

29:30.680 --> 29:34.600
Unfortunately, one guy gave out three passes to three people around me.

29:34.600 --> 29:46.280
I stuck around, though, and saw none other than Jay Wineland, the head sound designer

29:46.280 --> 29:47.280
for Bungie.

29:47.280 --> 29:48.960
I pointed to him and said, hey, you're Jay, right?

29:48.960 --> 29:49.960
The sound guy.

29:49.960 --> 29:52.960
He just nodded and smiled and said, wow, that was good, kind of creepy, but good, and disappeared

29:52.960 --> 29:56.160
for a sec, and then he came back with a pass for me to get in.

29:56.160 --> 29:58.640
I was all happy, got his autograph, and went and played.

29:58.640 --> 30:01.520
Let me tell you, Narrows is going to be a classic map.

30:01.520 --> 30:03.600
This is about Halo 3, by the way.

30:03.600 --> 30:07.480
Seriously, the build he had wasn't final, but you could tell it almost was because the

30:07.480 --> 30:08.960
fourth grenade was up there.

30:08.960 --> 30:13.640
Unfortunately, all we had were the following maps, High Ground, Valhalla, Snowbound, Narrows,

30:13.640 --> 30:15.800
Epitaph, Last Resort, and Sandtrap.

30:15.800 --> 30:18.720
One thing I loved about the game overall, everything was colorful.

30:18.720 --> 30:21.560
I don't mean bright colors everywhere, but it was just vibrant.

30:21.560 --> 30:26.780
I couldn't see clearly 100% of the time, but unlike in Halo 2, where I have to turn the

30:26.780 --> 30:29.960
brightness up a ton, it looked much better than Gears of War.

30:29.960 --> 30:32.400
Anyway, I didn't see much new stuff.

30:32.400 --> 30:37.680
I really did get to see a game of Infection slash Zombies, though, which I didn't quite

30:37.680 --> 30:38.680
understand.

30:38.680 --> 30:39.680
Weird shrug.

30:39.680 --> 30:45.840
So, around 7.30 to 8 o'clock or so, Mike, Rob, and Joe from Linkin Park walk in and

30:45.840 --> 30:47.680
just sit down and start playing.

30:47.680 --> 30:52.600
Everyone in the room outside who didn't get in was all OMG for a while, and people just

30:52.600 --> 30:53.600
sat down and played.

30:53.600 --> 30:54.600
I played too.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.080
I totally kicked their butts.

30:56.080 --> 30:59.840
Mike and Joe, the rapper and DJ, were pretty good, and you could tell Rob the drummer doesn't

30:59.840 --> 31:00.840
play much.

31:00.840 --> 31:05.360
I hung around Rob, got his autograph as well, and Mike's later, but Rob was there.

31:05.360 --> 31:08.340
As long as I don't get last place, I'm good, and he didn't.

31:08.340 --> 31:09.340
He did pretty good.

31:09.340 --> 31:12.160
Oh, and that was pretty much the highlight of my summer and definitely the best concert

31:12.160 --> 31:13.160
I've ever been to.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.920
Here's any pictures of the event.

31:14.920 --> 31:20.760
So I will actually save this email so that we can put this up on the website.

31:20.760 --> 31:21.760
How's that sound?

31:21.760 --> 31:22.760
Rad.

31:22.760 --> 31:24.960
Yeah, you should put the pictures up, because I was actually looking at that email earlier

31:24.960 --> 31:25.960
this week.

31:25.960 --> 31:28.240
And that's from Sycoon, by the way.

31:28.240 --> 31:31.120
That's our buddy Sycoon.

31:31.120 --> 31:35.440
Good job, Sycoon, with your field reporting.

31:35.440 --> 31:36.440
More emails.

31:36.440 --> 31:37.440
Hey.

31:37.440 --> 31:38.440
Yes.

31:38.440 --> 31:39.440
Hey, OLR crew.

31:39.440 --> 31:43.000
There are quite a few new games coming out that are being reported as having short play

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
times.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.960
Heavenly Sword, for example, is just six to ten hours.

31:45.960 --> 31:49.760
Now, I don't have a problem with short games, but I do have a problem with paying 60 bucks

31:49.760 --> 31:54.800
for them, so I decided to join Gamefly to rent those shorter games and play them through

31:54.800 --> 31:57.200
without the heavy cost.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.600
Am I not supporting the industry by joining Gamefly?

31:59.600 --> 32:06.400
Without this option, I certainly would have bought Heavenly Sword Lair and the sword at

32:06.400 --> 32:10.000
the full price and finished them in a week or two, thus putting more money directly into

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
the industry.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.440
Do you think long-term renting options like Gamefly are bad for the industry?

32:14.440 --> 32:18.120
And why is it that every time I pick my nose, it's full again after a few minutes?

32:18.120 --> 32:19.600
Dark Raven.

32:19.600 --> 32:22.480
Okay, wow.

32:22.480 --> 32:23.480
You know what?

32:23.480 --> 32:25.680
Blockbuster didn't kill the movie industry.

32:25.680 --> 32:30.720
And Netflix certainly hasn't damaged it either, so why would Gamefly kill the games industry?

32:30.720 --> 32:34.960
Because Gamefly still has to buy all those games from the publishers to get out to rent.

32:34.960 --> 32:36.880
It all depends on how you see it.

32:36.880 --> 32:40.560
I'm sure the publishers don't like Gamefly, but there's nothing really they can do about

32:40.560 --> 32:41.560
it.

32:41.560 --> 32:45.140
I mean, because, I don't know, one argument you could say, well, people are just going

32:45.140 --> 32:49.040
to rent games and they're not going to buy them, so, you know, we want people buying

32:49.040 --> 32:50.840
our games, not renting them.

32:50.840 --> 32:54.800
But on the other hand, though, people rent the game, like it, and then maybe buy it.

32:54.800 --> 32:58.800
Yeah, make a game worth buying and people will buy it, right?

32:58.800 --> 33:01.640
Because how many times, seriously, that's what it boils down to.

33:01.640 --> 33:04.240
How many people, I mean, I know I did this when I was a kid all the time, I would rent

33:04.240 --> 33:07.880
a game and I would love it so much, I'd be like, Mommy, Mommy, buy it for me for Christmas,

33:07.880 --> 33:12.880
and she would, because she loved me.

33:12.880 --> 33:14.800
At least that's what she told me.

33:14.800 --> 33:16.800
To my face.

33:16.800 --> 33:17.800
So there you go.

33:17.800 --> 33:20.200
Yeah, it's your face behind your back.

33:20.200 --> 33:21.200
Anyway.

33:21.200 --> 33:25.920
Hey, OLR, I know you guys have been looking for someone who doesn't like Bioshock, and

33:25.920 --> 33:30.240
even with my praises sung a few episodes ago, I have major complaint about the game after

33:30.240 --> 33:31.840
getting the retail version.

33:31.840 --> 33:35.800
It's far too dark and things that are shooting at you are impossible to see because they're

33:35.800 --> 33:39.760
either too far away and have deadly aim or you can't see them because the whole place

33:39.760 --> 33:41.600
is freaking dark.

33:41.600 --> 33:43.200
Has anyone else had this problem?

33:43.200 --> 33:45.280
I can't be the only one.

33:45.280 --> 33:48.800
The story is going to keep me going through the game, though, it's very intriguing.

33:48.800 --> 33:55.000
Cheers and keep up the podcasting AZHP.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.120
I really want to hear, I mean, that was a good email, but I really want to hear from

33:58.120 --> 34:02.920
people that, like, fucking hate Bioshock, but not just because I said so, like, I really

34:02.920 --> 34:06.800
want to hear a really good counterpoint to the whole, you know, everybody loves Bioshock.

34:06.800 --> 34:11.000
There's always somebody that doesn't, I mean, there's two sides to every story, so somewhere

34:11.000 --> 34:14.840
on the internet there is somebody that hates Bioshock for a good reason.

34:14.840 --> 34:16.920
I want to know why, and I want to know that reason.

34:16.920 --> 34:23.440
I did see something like that on Kotaku, it was from The Consumerist, I want to say.

34:23.440 --> 34:25.320
But was it somebody just trying to be funny?

34:25.320 --> 34:26.320
I don't know if they're trying to be funny.

34:26.320 --> 34:29.400
Because I think I saw something, it was just somebody trying to be funny, like, it wasn't

34:29.400 --> 34:34.760
real, you know, I want to hear, like, some real, like, I hate Bioshock and this is why.

34:34.760 --> 34:36.320
Please.

34:36.320 --> 34:45.200
And the last email is actually, wow, kind of long.

34:45.200 --> 34:50.640
It's mostly suggestions for games to do on the show, so I'm going to skip down to the

34:50.640 --> 34:54.560
actual gaming part.

34:54.560 --> 35:01.720
To make this email a little more video game related, I'm a Wii PS2 owner that just is

35:01.720 --> 35:05.800
about ready to pounce on the Xbox 360, now the premium has HDMI and a price cut.

35:05.800 --> 35:10.680
But since I've already waited this long, should I wait a little bit longer?

35:10.680 --> 35:16.760
And until the Falcon 65nm chips come out?

35:16.760 --> 35:17.760
Okay.

35:17.760 --> 35:20.000
Or with the three year warranty, should I just finally pick one up?

35:20.000 --> 35:24.400
A friend of mine just picked up an Xbox 360 Premium without the HDMI and it died within

35:24.400 --> 35:28.240
a week, and not with the Red Rings of Death.

35:28.240 --> 35:31.800
Any game played would instantly lock up after five minutes of turning the system on and

35:31.800 --> 35:34.320
it wasn't in a cramped cabinet either.

35:34.320 --> 35:40.640
Makes me a little tentative about getting one with the hotter 90nm chips, or if it does

35:40.640 --> 35:43.280
have the extra heat sink.

35:43.280 --> 35:47.040
Since it's not Red Rings of Death and not covered in the extended warranty, although

35:47.040 --> 35:53.100
you're still able to take it back to the store, this got long still ended here, and it's by

35:53.100 --> 35:57.180
hailstorm in our forums.

35:57.180 --> 35:58.180
Very cool.

35:58.180 --> 36:00.440
I didn't see this email earlier in the week, and I'm looking at the ideas.

36:00.440 --> 36:01.440
It just came.

36:01.440 --> 36:03.120
Yeah, I love some of these ideas that are in there.

36:03.120 --> 36:04.120
That's great.

36:04.120 --> 36:07.360
In fact, one of the games he suggests we do on here is Family Feud, and that's something

36:07.360 --> 36:10.800
I've been trying to do, like put together, but I can't figure out a good way to do it.

36:10.800 --> 36:11.800
So I like some of these suggestions.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.800
I'm going to read through this in more detail later.

36:13.800 --> 36:17.760
But anyway, the meat and potatoes of the interview here down there.

36:17.760 --> 36:20.520
Should I get an Xbox 360 now or wait?

36:20.520 --> 36:21.520
Here's the deal.

36:21.520 --> 36:26.000
I honestly think it'll be, I mean, maybe they'll do a little tiny chip set switcheroo, but

36:26.000 --> 36:27.480
I don't think it'll be that big a deal.

36:27.480 --> 36:30.500
The games they're putting out now, I mean, any game they put out is going to be designed

36:30.500 --> 36:35.460
to run flawlessly on the, well, if all the testing is done the way it should be, to run

36:35.460 --> 36:37.360
as best as it can on the consoles that are out now.

36:37.360 --> 36:40.160
So I wouldn't worry so much about waiting for a chip set, and here's the thing, if you're

36:40.160 --> 36:44.960
waiting for price reduction, new package or whatever, ain't going to happen for a year

36:44.960 --> 36:47.880
till next Christmas season, or at least well after Christmas.

36:47.880 --> 36:53.340
So I would say, unless you're prepared to wait six months for some significant changing

36:53.340 --> 36:58.680
in the structures, price, offerings of the 360, just go get one now.

36:58.680 --> 37:04.720
Honestly, as long as you document, I think, whatever happens, we've actually only had

37:04.720 --> 37:09.760
to return one system, but I think that we did it through the store itself, and we've

37:09.760 --> 37:15.200
actually got the elite now, Dan and I do, and it's, we've never had a problem.

37:15.200 --> 37:19.240
And if you're also worried about that whole, oh, I went out and got an iPhone, oh shit,

37:19.240 --> 37:23.240
they just dropped the price by 200 bucks, I got screwed, don't worry, that won't happen.

37:23.240 --> 37:24.240
Well, there's a rebate, too.

37:24.240 --> 37:28.000
Yeah, well, I guess now they're doing the $100 rebate or whatever, but still, I know

37:28.000 --> 37:31.040
some people who bought an iPhone that weren't happy when they heard that announcement.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.040
I know a lot of people weren't.

37:32.040 --> 37:34.000
I'm sure I know who you're referring to.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Several people I know weren't happy, but yeah.

37:36.000 --> 37:43.560
Well, um, oh, shoot, I was going to say something else about the Xbox 360, oh, yeah, I, though

37:43.560 --> 37:51.160
have not seen what the HD movies look like on the Xbox 360, but I have seen an HD movie,

37:51.160 --> 37:54.000
and I kind of like Blu-ray better, I hate to say it.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.480
The quality is exactly the same.

37:56.480 --> 38:01.600
Well, and, you know, and that's so, am I the only one that's not that intensely excited

38:01.600 --> 38:03.400
about this next gen of video?

38:03.400 --> 38:08.920
I mean, it's like, DVD, yeah, DVD was a huge, I mean, it was a huge contrast from VHS, but

38:08.920 --> 38:11.480
I'm like, eh, the picture's a little better, I'm like, I don't know.

38:11.480 --> 38:16.440
Actually, actually, actually, as a laserdisc player owner, I was very upset with a lot

38:16.440 --> 38:20.320
of DVDs that came out, because, um, keep in mind that with laserdisc, you actually had

38:20.320 --> 38:22.180
much less compression.

38:22.180 --> 38:26.940
My laserdiscs of Tron, because I have the big, the nice special box set, are infinitely

38:26.940 --> 38:28.880
better than the DVDs of Tron.

38:28.880 --> 38:32.200
Here's the thing about the whole next gen thing, is that what's out there now is just

38:32.200 --> 38:36.280
a bunch of bullshit, but you have to think about the finish line, because when all is

38:36.280 --> 38:40.800
said and done, what else is going to move into the next generation of video?

38:40.800 --> 38:41.800
Porn.

38:41.800 --> 38:48.280
And, you know, when they start making HD, DVD, and Blu-ray porn, you are so there in

38:48.280 --> 38:50.440
the next generation of video.

38:50.440 --> 38:53.160
They already have that, and I'm not so there.

38:53.160 --> 38:54.160
And they're rawr!

38:54.160 --> 38:56.960
Rob, we still need to see Pirates.

38:56.960 --> 38:59.520
Oh, don't they have Pirates on HD?

38:59.520 --> 39:00.520
And Blu-ray.

39:00.520 --> 39:01.520
Ooh!

39:01.520 --> 39:02.520
I think I'm going to get the Blu-ray.

39:02.520 --> 39:05.800
I used to work at a video store, and people would be like, you know, I want to return

39:05.800 --> 39:09.960
this movie, because when I pause it, I couldn't see the picture, and it's like, okay.

39:09.960 --> 39:10.960
Okay, listen.

39:10.960 --> 39:12.240
I do have HD porn.

39:12.240 --> 39:16.560
I stream it to my 360, because, thank you, media center extender.

39:16.560 --> 39:21.680
But you know what, Black Boy, that's what Black Boy says in chat, is, Black Boy says,

39:21.680 --> 39:23.640
who goes out and buys porn discs?

39:23.640 --> 39:25.200
It's all download today.

39:25.200 --> 39:27.600
Here's the thing, no, I'm not saying I'm going to go buy the porn discs.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.800
I am someone who buys a lot of porn.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.520
Here's the thing, though.

39:31.520 --> 39:35.440
I'm waiting for the discs to come out, so someone can rip them and put them on the internet,

39:35.440 --> 39:36.680
and then I can download them.

39:36.680 --> 39:37.680
See?

39:37.680 --> 39:41.440
Well, you really need to get out, I mean, seriously, this stuff's out there already.

39:41.440 --> 39:45.440
For the record, the only reason I have a Blu-ray player is because we actually bought a PS3.

39:45.440 --> 39:50.760
I'm not saying it's horrible, I'm just saying, I'm not saying it's horrible, I'm just like,

39:50.760 --> 39:55.440
I'm not that, I was like, really, really wanting to get a DVD when they came out, a DVD player,

39:55.440 --> 39:59.320
and I'm not, I'm like, eh, you know, I can wait until they battle it out between HD and

39:59.320 --> 40:00.320
Blu-ray.

40:00.320 --> 40:04.480
I'm sort of thinking about, if I did buy a new computer, I think the next one I get will

40:04.480 --> 40:10.480
be a VIO because all the new VIOs come out with Blu-ray players, and they cost the same

40:10.480 --> 40:12.880
that my old one did when I got it new.

40:12.880 --> 40:13.880
Hmmm.

40:13.880 --> 40:14.880
Mm-hmm.

40:14.880 --> 40:15.880
Or meh.

40:15.880 --> 40:16.880
Meh.

40:16.880 --> 40:19.920
Is that it for emails?

40:19.920 --> 40:21.520
Yes, Rob.

40:21.520 --> 40:22.520
That's it.

40:22.520 --> 40:23.520
Buy mailbag.

40:23.520 --> 40:24.520
Alright.

40:24.520 --> 40:25.520
Now what?

40:25.520 --> 40:28.520
Back into some news.

40:28.520 --> 40:30.960
Yes, news.

40:30.960 --> 40:37.040
So anyways, this is not surprising, but it's actually pretty cool.

40:37.040 --> 40:43.600
Manhunt 2 has leaked out online, and that would be the uncensored beta from European

40:43.600 --> 40:49.160
regions because it is in PAL format, so of course everybody's been jumping on the bit

40:49.160 --> 40:50.760
to actually play it.

40:50.760 --> 40:58.080
No word if it's any, you know, if it plays well or not because it is beta, but I'm definitely

40:58.080 --> 40:59.440
going to find out.

40:59.440 --> 41:03.440
Ew, Mr. DeBucket in chat says Manhunt 2 has neck raping.

41:03.440 --> 41:04.440
Is that true?

41:04.440 --> 41:05.440
That's gross.

41:05.440 --> 41:06.440
Ew.

41:06.440 --> 41:10.000
I don't know, but I heard there's something about ripping off testicles in the game.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
Ahhh!

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
It sounds awesome.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Eddie just covered his balls in the studio.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
That game sounds great.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.040
I cannot wait to play this on the Wii.

41:17.040 --> 41:19.320
If you're a woman, and you don't have balls.

41:19.320 --> 41:22.160
Oh my God.

41:22.160 --> 41:24.760
How would you like it if some chick got her titties ripped off?

41:24.760 --> 41:25.760
That's similar.

41:25.760 --> 41:26.760
Hey, you know what?

41:26.760 --> 41:30.720
It's going to be some crazy interactivity where you move out the Wiimote and then yank

41:30.720 --> 41:32.840
it back to yank off the testicles.

41:32.840 --> 41:33.840
Exactly.

41:33.840 --> 41:37.880
It'd be like the harpoon in Zelda.

41:37.880 --> 41:40.680
Oh my God.

41:40.680 --> 41:45.480
Okay, the chatroom said apparently it's a running gag on All Games Interactive, one

41:45.480 --> 41:46.480
of our buddy shows.

41:46.480 --> 41:48.800
Neck raping is some type of joke.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.960
Neck raping is not a joke.

41:50.960 --> 41:52.240
That's not a fucking joke.

41:52.240 --> 41:53.240
That's gross.

41:53.240 --> 41:56.840
What if someone has a tracheotomy?

41:56.840 --> 42:01.680
Ew, you want to fuck somebody's hole that you said a tracheotomy?

42:01.680 --> 42:02.680
That's disgusting!

42:02.680 --> 42:06.080
I was trying to think how would that work?

42:06.080 --> 42:08.720
And I would think that it would have to either be someone with their head chopped off or

42:08.720 --> 42:09.720
a tracheotomy.

42:09.720 --> 42:13.920
That would be a two-part explicit episode this week.

42:13.920 --> 42:14.920
Congratulations, crew.

42:14.920 --> 42:15.920
You've done good.

42:15.920 --> 42:19.080
They could talk to you while they're giving you a blow job.

42:19.080 --> 42:20.080
They could.

42:20.080 --> 42:22.360
I'm so glad you're not holding a microphone right now.

42:22.360 --> 42:27.880
And that Op11 is down.

42:27.880 --> 42:34.520
Oh my God.

42:34.520 --> 42:35.520
That's wrong.

42:35.520 --> 42:36.520
Now you just need a smoker.

42:36.520 --> 42:37.520
Tracheotomy, man.

42:37.520 --> 42:44.960
I started playing Manhunt 2 and I'll tell you it's not funny.

42:44.960 --> 42:46.600
Wow.

42:46.600 --> 42:53.520
Anyway, the guy who directed Doom is directing the new Street Fighter movie and it's probably

42:53.520 --> 42:56.120
going to be just as shitty as the old one.

42:56.120 --> 42:57.680
The end.

42:57.680 --> 43:00.680
Yeah, I think that about says it.

43:00.680 --> 43:04.440
I mean, gosh, there was an awful lot of internet articles about it, but I think Jamie summed

43:04.440 --> 43:05.440
it up very well.

43:05.440 --> 43:06.760
Here you go.

43:06.760 --> 43:07.760
Yep.

43:07.760 --> 43:08.760
I'm brilliant.

43:08.760 --> 43:13.640
I really hope they don't destroy some guy's wonderful movie career and then that guy dies,

43:13.640 --> 43:18.760
like kind of like Raul Julia, like his last movie role was M. Bison, you know, or at least

43:18.760 --> 43:22.880
his last big screen movie role was M. Bison and Raul Julia was awesome.

43:22.880 --> 43:26.360
Like who didn't love Gomez Adams, but anyway.

43:26.360 --> 43:34.840
All I know is that when I hear about the shitty video game trends, shitty-os, shitty-os, new

43:34.840 --> 43:42.600
shitty-os from the makers of Doom, the movie, it's brand new shitty-os.

43:42.600 --> 43:43.600
You know what?

43:43.600 --> 43:44.600
Forget the story.

43:44.600 --> 43:48.960
When I can't talk for an entire night, I get angsty and that means it's F.U.'s of the week

43:48.960 --> 43:58.600
time.

43:58.600 --> 43:59.720
F.U.'s of the week time.

43:59.720 --> 44:01.280
Start off with Dark Sakura.

44:01.280 --> 44:08.960
F.U. goes to my sinuses for making F.U. goes to my toilet.

44:08.960 --> 44:14.360
We have a, we've had this clog in our pipes that what happens is that it makes the toilet

44:14.360 --> 44:25.120
back up or it backs up, it backs up, well, sewage into our tub and it sucks.

44:25.120 --> 44:30.520
So our landlord came out and it was digging around the pipes trying to fix it, so I hope

44:30.520 --> 44:33.600
it sticks by the time we get home.

44:33.600 --> 44:36.560
Yes, you can say an F.U. to a video game company, Eddie.

44:36.560 --> 44:40.400
F.U. to LucasArts for saying, we're considering making a game for the Wii.

44:40.400 --> 44:41.400
I'm like, fuck you.

44:41.400 --> 44:45.360
I mean, oh my god, this is like the best system ever and that like, LucasArts is awesome and

44:45.360 --> 44:48.000
they need to like get out their ass and stop thinking about it and actually make a game

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
for the Wii.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
So fuck you, LucasArts.

44:50.000 --> 44:53.440
I should say Eddie is an unapologetic Nintendo fanboy, right?

44:53.440 --> 44:54.440
Exactly, exactly.

44:54.440 --> 45:01.320
Has a Sony or Microsoft product or Sega product, for that matter, ever been in your house?

45:01.320 --> 45:02.320
Never.

45:02.320 --> 45:03.320
Fanboy.

45:03.320 --> 45:04.320
Alright, Logie.

45:04.320 --> 45:10.200
Uh, fuck you to crappy pizza, especially at John's Incredible Pizza, because it was not

45:10.200 --> 45:12.760
incredible, it was incredibly crappy.

45:12.760 --> 45:13.760
Although, props to that-

45:13.760 --> 45:15.440
It probably gave you incredible diarrhea, too.

45:15.440 --> 45:19.920
No, it did not give me incredible diarrhea, but it was just like, it was like, wow, I

45:19.920 --> 45:24.240
can tell you spent a lot of money on this, what, there's a whole like two pepperonis

45:24.240 --> 45:26.240
on this pepperoni pizza they have?

45:26.240 --> 45:32.080
I mean, seriously, it's just, it was pretty lame, but uh, whatever.

45:32.080 --> 45:38.920
Uh, I want to give an F.U. first off to my voice, because apparently I can't talk at

45:38.920 --> 45:41.280
all tonight, and it's really ruining the show for me.

45:41.280 --> 45:47.560
Uh, and then I just want to give an F.U. to, um, people that start out like really nice,

45:47.560 --> 45:51.120
like they want to be your best friend in the world, and like, you know, oh I love you and

45:51.120 --> 45:55.040
da da da, and then they turn into like a total psycho-host beast.

45:55.040 --> 46:01.320
I'm not talking about you, Jamie, although you've done that, too.

46:01.320 --> 46:04.680
No, no, no, I'm talking about work-related situations.

46:04.680 --> 46:08.760
I, I actually was actually thinking, you said that and I started thinking about, started

46:08.760 --> 46:09.760
thinking about somebody.

46:09.760 --> 46:10.760
What?

46:10.760 --> 46:13.760
I'm not gonna say my name.

46:13.760 --> 46:14.760
Oh.

46:14.760 --> 46:15.760
I can probably think about it, yeah.

46:15.760 --> 46:18.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know what you're talking about.

46:18.760 --> 46:19.760
Alright.

46:19.760 --> 46:20.760
Haha.

46:20.760 --> 46:26.280
O.L.R. rumors you guys will never know about, so that's all I wanted to say, F.U. too.

46:26.280 --> 46:34.060
Anyways, um, so, EverQuest, yeah, that wonderful game, EverQuest, um, EverQuest 1 and 2 have

46:34.060 --> 46:41.680
added a brand new card game called Legends of Norrath, and, um, yeah, I guess it's gonna

46:41.680 --> 46:51.480
be, um, Oath, the Oathbound series will feature 375 cards in a 55 card starter deck for $9.99

46:51.480 --> 46:58.400
and 15 card booster packs for $2.99, and the game is playable from EverQuest 1 or 2, although

46:58.400 --> 47:05.640
there will be a stand-alone client, um, due out for free in September, actually this week,

47:05.640 --> 47:06.640
on Wednesday.

47:06.640 --> 47:15.240
So, um, I don't know, just trying to cash in, I guess, on the collectible card games.

47:15.240 --> 47:21.720
And EverQuest, it's such a, you know, uh, new product, I don't know.

47:21.720 --> 47:25.760
These MMOs last forever, I mean, if you think about it, Final Fantasy XI is five years old,

47:25.760 --> 47:28.440
if you can believe it, so these MMOs last forever.

47:28.440 --> 47:29.880
They really do.

47:29.880 --> 47:30.880
So.

47:30.880 --> 47:31.880
Alright.

47:31.880 --> 47:35.320
Uh, anyway, speaking of MMOs, I have a comment.

47:35.320 --> 47:36.320
What?

47:36.320 --> 47:37.320
Yes.

47:37.320 --> 47:38.480
How old is Final Fantasy?

47:38.480 --> 47:39.480
Five years.

47:39.480 --> 47:42.120
Just old enough to be raped now.

47:42.120 --> 47:44.680
What is wrong with you?

47:44.680 --> 47:47.120
You missed our discussion on neck-raping earlier.

47:47.120 --> 47:48.120
Really?

47:48.120 --> 47:49.120
Ow!

47:49.120 --> 47:51.080
That's what you get for watching, thank you for punching him, that's what you get for

47:51.080 --> 47:52.880
watching Battlestar Galactica during the show.

47:52.880 --> 47:56.480
Now stay quiet until the next, your segment, alright?

47:56.480 --> 47:57.480
Alright.

47:57.480 --> 47:58.480
Fine.

47:58.480 --> 48:03.360
Uh, moving on, speaking of MMOs, there is a new Missed Online episode coming soon to

48:03.360 --> 48:06.360
Missed Online, which of course is part of the GameTap service.

48:06.360 --> 48:11.000
It actually just debuted this weekend, and it's called Deception.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.640
There's a new guild system being built into the game.

48:13.640 --> 48:16.360
It's going to have a guild, actually I think there's already a guild system, but now the

48:16.360 --> 48:20.880
guilds are getting pubs, and so you can actually meet up in this pub, and some new storylines

48:20.880 --> 48:21.880
are being added into the game.

48:21.880 --> 48:25.800
And of course Missed Online is a part of GameTap, so if you're a GameTap subscriber, you get

48:25.800 --> 48:26.800
access to Missed Online.

48:26.800 --> 48:30.160
I played Missed Online for like three days, but I found it to be really, like I didn't

48:30.160 --> 48:31.840
know what the hell I was doing.

48:31.840 --> 48:34.720
Like there needs to be a little more, like even though I thought it was cool, they had

48:34.720 --> 48:39.520
like live actors that actually did introductions and initiations, I just wish there had been

48:39.520 --> 48:44.400
a little more like, what the fuck do I do with this game, like kind of like talk.

48:44.400 --> 48:47.660
So that's all, but otherwise I thought Missed Online was actually a really good looking

48:47.660 --> 48:53.880
game, and considering I like GameTap as it is already, and I swear I'm not on their payroll,

48:53.880 --> 48:58.060
I think it's a nice addition, I mean you pay next to nothing for it with all the other

48:58.060 --> 49:00.920
crap that's there, so it's pretty cool.

49:00.920 --> 49:06.780
Well, how is this for happy and sad at the same time?

49:06.780 --> 49:17.080
You know what, it's the Dreamcast's birthday, poor, poor Dreamcast, how we miss you, 8th

49:17.080 --> 49:19.160
birthday of the Dreamcast.

49:19.160 --> 49:25.440
8 years, wow, that's not very long, would you consider how long ago the Dreamcast was

49:25.440 --> 49:26.440
now?

49:26.440 --> 49:36.600
They brought us though, we had Power Stone, Bongio, Ikaruga, Choo Choo Rocket, Soul Edge,

49:36.600 --> 49:47.200
Soul Calibur, Rezz, lots and lots of shit, Shenmue, and the fact that you could hack

49:47.200 --> 49:50.680
it to play Nintendo games, oh you didn't even really hack it, you just bring your own, huh,

49:50.680 --> 49:55.320
Blingcast was cool, and they had a Pepsi Man game, and the Dreamcast love is still out

49:55.320 --> 49:58.600
there because there's still a bunch of shit being made for it, not a bunch, it's still

49:58.600 --> 50:02.780
awesome, I love the Dreamcast, so there you go, I have two of them because I stole mats,

50:02.780 --> 50:09.360

52:41.480 --> 52:46.520

socially kind of support a company that says you know what

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.960
we don't really want to make a sequel right now

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.280
is there really such a bad thing what was it that they don't want to make a

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:52.120
sequel they wanted to make a sequel is that they didn't approach him for a

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:55.560
sequel

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:59.560
within the stock they could go to die in a boat fire

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.240
right jamie

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:05.120
yes right

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:05.880
all right

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:09.080
uh... that's it for the gaming news tonight so we get to last minute stories

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:12.160
but that means it's time for the skype line yes we're gonna open up our skype

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:12.800
line

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:17.640
at a orange lounge radio on skype or one eight seven seven game o l r

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:21.300
but of course since we promised ravens dolphin as his prize

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:23.180
we will now call him back

01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:26.440
so uh... we have hit the dial button on ravens dolphins name

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:29.420
or waiting to connect

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:33.440
when i hear some creepy i think we got voicemail every second game podcast

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:34.940
message you live

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:37.820
voicemail we've got a message after the beat

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:39.160
please eliminate

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:40.420
all

01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:41.460
or most

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:48.180
background noise keep it under a minute thirty-second

01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:50.200
uh...

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:53.600
uh...

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.160
we are calling you back as promised

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:59.000
but you're not there

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.560
sucks to be here

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.360
hugs and kisses

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:04.600
right it's over

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:07.800
So let's go to the phones and see who calls us.

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:13.900
Again, our username is OrangeLaunchRadio on Skype, phone number 1877-GAME-OLR.

01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:15.700
Oh, look who's calling us back.

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:17.700
Do you want your own show or something?

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:18.300
No.

01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:20.100
All right, what do you want, Ravensdolvin?

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:23.200
I forgot to tell you that I fail at computers.

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.900
Congratul- Yes you do, congratulations.

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:26.900
All right, real quickly, you've had too much showtime.

01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:28.900
What's your question tonight for us?

01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:31.100
My Xbox died, that's it.

01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:32.300
That's not a fucking question.

01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.300
That's not a question.

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:36.300
No, I just want to tell you that I'm sad.

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:38.800
Oh, I'm sorry, here's the Kleenex.

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:42.100
All right, if you want to call us, 1877-GAME-OLR,

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:47.600
or our username is OrangeLaunchRadio on Skype.

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.900
Meanwhile, I'm looking at chat comments.

01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:53.400
There has been a lot of chat comments tonight I've read, I apologize.

01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:56.700
Velurno, I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing your name, I'm not sure how to say that.

01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:59.200
Velurno says, I wanted a Crackdown sequel,

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:02.600
and puts those dejected little three dots right after that comment there.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.900
So, sorry about that.

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:07.400
All right, we got some more calls though, let's go to the calls.

01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:09.900
Hi, you're on OrangeLaunchRadio, who's this?

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:11.200
Hey guys, this is FootyMonster.

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:13.700
Hello, FootyMonster, how are you?

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:15.500
I'm doing just fine, what about you guys?

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:18.300
Good, hey, I don't know if I'm supposed to say this publicly,

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:21.500
but I heard you guys got picked up by AllGames, the ultimate quest.

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:24.300
That is correct, yeah, I think it's public knowledge by now.

01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:28.200
We were promised a long time ago, but it just comes to friction right now.

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:32.700
So, about a week or two, we're going to be on AllGames on the stream and stuff like that.

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:35.000
Congratulations, that's okay, because you know what?

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Hey, ScottBlue, something that I thought was a secret,

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.900
that I guess he said on the show,

01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:43.000
and I was trying to keep it a secret.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.900
Are we supposed to keep that a secret, or can we say it?

01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:46.800
No, I think we're supposed to keep that a secret.

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.100
All right, then I won't say it.

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.000
All right, oh, it's a secret.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Later, I will tell you later, like, I don't know,

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000
maybe during a certain upcoming expo, we can give you more information.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.300
Not that I know anything, or don't, but that's it.

01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:01.700
FootyMonster, what do you have for our listeners tonight?

01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:04.700
Well, basically, I just wanted to share with you guys,

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.200
I don't know if it's a review or something,

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:09.200
but Persona 3, which is this new game for the PS2,

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:12.600
it's an RPG, and I just wanted to let everyone know,

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.200
because it's probably underrated and under the radar.

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:17.400
It's from the Shin Megami Tensei universe,

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:21.800
if anyone ever played one of those games, like Nocturne or Digital Devil Saga.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:25.800
Nocturne was the game in which Dante from Devil May Cry made a cameo and stuff,

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.000
so it was known back in the day in the PS2.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.400
And Persona 3 came out, and it was really, really, really good,

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.400
and I've been playing it, I've put, like, 40 hours into it,

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.000
I'm not even halfway done.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.600
It's deep as hell, and it's really good.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:41.200
I don't know if you guys have heard anything about it, or...

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.700
You know what's funny?

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:46.800
I'm holding here in my hand the Persona 3 trade demo we got sent from Atlus,

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:49.100
and I have to admit, I have not played it still.

01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:50.000
Shame on you, Rogue.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.500
All right, I'll give it to Jamie to play.

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:57.200
I swear I was going to play it, but then I went back to Final Fantasy XI.

01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.100
Have you played Overlord yet?

01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:01.500
No.

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:04.600
But I will.

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:08.600
What makes this game so great compared to the Final Fantasies of the world,

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:09.600
where, you know, most people you say,

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.100
what's the greatest role-playing game of all time?

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:15.000
People will say Dragon Quest, or they'll say Final Fantasy VII.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Why is it so great?

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.900
Well, this is the thing.

01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:22.800
It's not just an RPG. They try to break the mold a little bit.

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:25.200
And as you know, RPGs are really...

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.500
They're falling flat every day more and more.

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.100
They're not that amazing anymore.

01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:31.600
They're never anything new in them,

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:35.700
except for, you know, kind of cases like Bioware releasing Mass Effect and stuff like that,

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:38.800
which is a massive world or anything, or something like that.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:42.000
This game, however, it's a single-player experience, but it's so huge.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.800
Like, you don't just fight.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:47.400
You also have to live the life of the character, as in you go to school.

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.300
You, you know, you gotta make friends with people.

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:53.000
You gotta develop your relationship with everyone else.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.400
And it's not just that it's tacked on.

01:11:55.400 --> 01:12:00.700
Also, you use that as a means to get more powerful in the game on the fighting aspect of things.

01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:06.400
So, it's like they made this perfect balance between fighting and normal dungeon crawling,

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:11.700
and all this other stuff that's just about story and developing characters.

01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:13.000
All right. Well, that sounds kind of cool.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.900
I mean, I definitely have to check it out at some point. I will. So many games.

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:19.100
Tokimeki meets RPG.

01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:24.400
I would say so. It's kind of like a date scene, if you think about it that way.

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:24.900
Yeah.

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:31.000
But, you know, in the sense that, yeah, you need to raise your academic status to do better at school,

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.900
and that in turn will unlock the chance of you to date a certain girl,

01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:38.900
which in turn will give you the chance to get this certain magic spell,

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.900
which will make you more powerful in the fighting side of things.

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:43.300
That's pretty cool.

01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:47.600
So, it's forcing you, but at the same time, if you don't want to do it, you don't want to do it.

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:49.600
But, there's a lot of benefit from it.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:55.400
So, they actually motivate you into looking further into the game rather than just the fighting aspect of the game.

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.400
All right. I'll give you that. It sounds kind of interesting.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:00.300
I definitely will have to check it out at some point.

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:01.300
You win.

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:05.600
I mean, on the show, a couple weeks ago, we did review the whole thing in length.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:09.100
I spent like 20 minutes talking about it because it's really, really that good.

01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:09.700
Very cool.

01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:14.700
Well, so, you can go ahead and plug your show real quick so they know where to go download that if they want.

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:17.200
All right. So, it's UltimateQuest.net.

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:21.200
It's a show that I did with Shadow Slayer, Jack Ransom, and Xenocore.

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:24.200
And I believe that was episode 21, I want to say, or 22.

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:27.500
I forgot right now because we're, you know, it was a couple of weeks ago.

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.000
Oh, and I said I'd come on the show.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
I sent a reply message back because I didn't see an email for like a week.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.700
But, any of us will, I'm sure if you can work in the time with any of us, we'll all come on at some point

01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:39.700
and talk nerdy role-playing.

01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:44.700
Yeah, I know that Xenocore talked with you about maybe you doing, we have this little thing called the Ultimate Side Quest,

01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:48.200
which is a show that we do on and off, sometimes like once a month.

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:51.700
And it's like a discussion, it's not just about the news, but about like maybe a topic,

01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:57.200
like let's say tabletop RPG gaming and how it would make RPGs in the consoles better.

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:59.700
That was the topic of the latest one.

01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:02.700
You'll have to get Jamie for that one because I don't do a lot of tabletop.

01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:05.700
I haven't been doing any in the past month.

01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:06.700
That's not that long.

01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:08.700
Yeah, I was playing D&D.

01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:09.700
Very cool.

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:13.200
All right, well, Footy, thanks so much for the input and for the game suggestions.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.700
You've been full of game suggestions lately, from the Hannah Montana DS to this.

01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:20.200
I got to spread the Hannah Montana love. It's awesome.

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:23.700
You better be calling back in a couple weeks and telling us about the next game we all need to be playing.

01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:26.700
Oh, that reminds me, Loki, do not buy Jam Sessions.

01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:30.700
I have the Japanese version. It's not good. It's not good.

01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:32.700
It's cheap though.

01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:34.200
It really is.

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.700
Loki likes cheap.

01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:39.700
I'm not buying Hannah Montana. I can tell you that much.

01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:41.700
I will buy Hannah Montana.

01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:43.700
All right, you do that.

01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:45.700
All right, bye, Footy Monster. Thanks for the call.

01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:46.700
Talk to you later, guys.

01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:52.700
All right, if you want to give us a call or use the name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR,

01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:54.700
and let me take this opportunity to remind you guys.

01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:58.700
You've probably heard Raven on the show before and Footy Monster on the show before.

01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:00.700
That's because they're actually calling in.

01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:04.700
So if you want to call in and be on the show sometime, make sure you're actually listening to the program.

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:06.700
Sunday nights at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:09.700
Let's go back to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:10.700
GS68.

01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:12.700
Hello, GS68. What's on your mind?

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:17.700
Oh, someone sent an email complaining that Heavenly Sword was too short, right?

01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:18.700
Mm-hmm.

01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:25.700
Well, when I was younger, game took less than an hour to complete. It had no save points.

01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:30.700
So people are saying that Heavenly Sword is too short of a game.

01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:32.700
Yeah, 10 hours.

01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:38.700
10 hours isn't that short. 10 hours is about how long it took to beat Silent Hill 2, and that's a beautiful game.

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:44.700
So, you know, I don't think it's such a bad thing that the games are necessarily short, as long as it's fun.

01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:48.700
You're right. Like, a lot of those old-school NES games, like, they were really good.

01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:53.700
Like, God, I could probably beat Super Mario Brothers in, like, 15 minutes, if that.

01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:58.700
Yeah, or Mario 2. I just got that on Virtual Console, and that's like a 15-minute game if you know all the power-ups and stuff.

01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:05.700
But it's part of the, is it fun to replay over and over again, because a game like Super Mario Brothers 2, hell yeah, it's fun to play over and over again, so.

01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:12.700
It's really short. I mean, you can beat it in under two hours, and there are people who play it over and over again.

01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:20.700
Yeah. So, hey, you know, a game is all about fun, you know, but considering how much they're charging for these games,

01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:26.700
if it is only a 10-hour game, it better be a really fun 10-hour game, like six bucks an hour good.

01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:31.700
But if you think about it, I mean, hell, they charge $10 for an hour and a half movie, so why not?

01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:33.700
Yeah.

01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:36.700
Now, are you buying Heavenly Sword, Loki?

01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:38.700
Maybe.

01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:40.700
Are you buying it, GS68?

01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:44.700
No, I don't really have much interest in games like those.

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:48.700
I'll probably give it a rent, since I can rent for free.

01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:52.700
There you go. Here's one of those rent-before-you-buy things.

01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:55.700
Maybe you'll rent it and beat it, and then wonder, do I want to play this again?

01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:58.700
What money is it out of my pocket?

01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:00.700
All right.

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:02.700
If it's free, I'll do almost anything.

01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:04.700
Tigerclaw has an interesting point.

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:09.700
I hate games that force you to play on a hard difficulty just to see the better ending.

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:11.700
Oh, no kidding.

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:17.700
If it's normal, then I don't mind, because in my opinion, if it's easy difficulty, you're a pussy.

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:22.700
But I don't really do hard mode a lot on games.

01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:28.700
There was a Star Wars game on N64 that you couldn't even see the ending unless you got to the ending and it's all,

01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:31.700
to see the ending played in hard mode, I was like, fuck you.

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:34.700
Here's the thing, though.

01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:36.700
Oh, shoot.

01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:39.700
It was like the only Star Wars. No, it was other than Rogue Squadron.

01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:43.700
Yeah, the one that wasn't Rogue Squadron. It was the one where you play the guy.

01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:45.700
I have that game.

01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:48.700
Here's the thing, though. I think those subtle ending differences are pretty cool.

01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:52.700
I go back all the way to the original Metroid.

01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:57.700
When you played it the first time, it probably took you forever and a day to actually beat it, and so you got the crappy ending.

01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:06.700
But then somebody at school tells you, hey, if you play it really fast, then you get to see the chick take all her clothes off.

01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:08.700
Which is people stretching the truth a little bit.

01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:12.700
But who didn't run home and play through the game just as fast as they could to see if there was that other ending in it?

01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:14.700
I know I did.

01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:18.700
There you go, C.

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:23.700
I tried to get under three hours in Super Metroid, not just for the accomplishment, but because of, you know.

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:28.700
Or even the games with all the different multiple endings, if you did things a different way or did it the harder way, like Chrono Trigger.

01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:35.700
You start off, if you do save game plus and start off and just beat Lavos right away, you get the developer ending.

01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:37.700
That was pretty cool.

01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:42.700
Yeah, stuff like that's really cool.

01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:44.700
Those did Airspace, apparently.

01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:46.700
Sorry, I was reading stuff.

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:49.700
Okay, so anything else you want to share with our listeners, DS68?

01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:53.700
Yeah, I finally got around to playing 2DX Distorted on PS2.

01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:55.700
And what'd you think?

01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:57.700
It's pretty good.

01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:11.700
I haven't played any, well, I don't have any 2DX between 9th and 13th styles, so there's a lot of features that are new to me, like all the score data from the arcade and such.

01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:15.700
Yeah, I haven't bought a 2DX game since 9th style either, but I did play a lot of Red.

01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:17.700
I don't know, we'll see.

01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:20.700
I'm kind of over a lot of those Konami music games, I have to admit.

01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:25.700
It's the same fucking thing for like five years now, so I'm ready for something new.

01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:28.700
So when Konami's ready to give me something new, I'll go back.

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:31.700
Or, you know, I do still buy the new DDR games on consoles.

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:42.700
Because, you know, Universe and the Xbox DERs have felt really new to me, and hell, I still think, what is it, UltraMix 2 is like the best DDR game they've put out in any country on a console.

01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:45.700
I got tired of playing DDR at home.

01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:48.700
Yeah, it's not the same. I'll give you that.

01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:51.700
All right, well, DS68, thanks so much for the call, we appreciate it, okay?

01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:53.700
All right, later buddy.

01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:56.700
All right, that's actually going to do it tonight for the Skype line.

01:19:56.700 --> 01:20:03.700
We're actually running way over tonight, thanks to all the craziness, so we're actually going to wrap things up with some last minute stories.

01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:05.700
Does anybody have some quick last minute stories?

01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:08.700
I have some things I forgot to mention during the release dates.

01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:13.700
There's a game that apparently was coming out on PC called 30,000 Games.

01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:17.700
I don't know what it is, but I know there's 30,000 of them.

01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:21.700
And I say, for $19.99, that's a pretty damn good deal.

01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:27.700
Anyways, sorry, I wasn't ready for that yet. My bad.

01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:29.700
Okey-dokey.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:32.700
I've been having all sorts of sound boo-boos tonight.

01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:39.700
Anyways, one thing I was going to mention, South Park did win the Emmy for World of Warcraft episodes.

01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:42.700
This is actually Loki's new theme music.

01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:49.700
Okay, I have news.

01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:54.700
That, by the way, was Super Mario RPG in Mario Paint. That's what that was.

01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:58.700
Sega's game, The Club, will not be out for Christmas, by the way.

01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:03.700
It's going to be out early 2008 for PC, PS3, and Xbox 360.

01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:07.700
This is perfect for what we've been talking about.

01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:20.700
Anyways, apparently you can buy unicorns in Second Life. There's just one small little issue that they forgot to mention.

01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:28.700
In order to obtain a unicorn, you have to have sex with an adult unicorn in Second Life.

01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:36.700
What is that from?

01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:39.700
It's Super Mario RPG.

01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:43.700
Yeah, Rama sent me all these YouTubage things.

01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:49.700
The username is TomBobBlender has made all these YouTubes of all these songs in Mario Paint.

01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:51.700
It's good times.

01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:53.700
I remember the little kitty and doggy noises. That's great.

01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:56.700
Anyways, what it says basically, it says,

01:21:56.700 --> 01:22:02.700
Someone on Second Life is offering tiny, adorable baby unicorns that you can hold and cuddle, but they come with a price.

01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:09.700
You can only get them by having sex with an adult unicorn located at the Belle Highland Sim.

01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:12.700
Deal or no deal.

01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:14.700
How can a unicorn get a baby?

01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:17.700
Apparently there's a website here that has not...

01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:20.700
Oh, yeah, that's interesting.

01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:23.700
Oh, God.

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:27.700
That is special.

01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:30.700
Where's the baby unicorn?

01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:34.700
Does it really matter?

01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:38.700
I don't know. There's some weird shit on this website.

01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:42.700
I don't even know what that is, but it's some sort of insect having sex with somebody.

01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:45.700
God, Second Life is awesome.

01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:47.700
And by awesome you mean scary.

01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:50.700
Yes. Anything else for last minute stories tonight?

01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:53.700
Sell everything and get a Wii.

01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:56.700
Try First Life. It's great.

01:22:56.700 --> 01:23:00.700
Okay, you done?

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:06.700
There's some cool Office Depot, I guess, bundle for the Xbox 360 for $2.99.

01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:09.700
You get the premium system, so that might be worth it.

01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:12.700
I don't know.

01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:15.700
That's it.

01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:18.700
Well, that is going to do it tonight for Orange Launch Radio, you guys.

01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:21.700
I want to thank everybody for tuning into and listening to Orange Launch Radio tonight

01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:23.700
and supporting independent radio.

01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:25.700
We really appreciate it, you guys. You guys are awesome.

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:29.700
And by the way, I want my voice back for next week.

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:35.700
One, I also want to say a big thank you to all those of you guys who have left five-star reviews on iTunes recently

01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:38.700
on our podcast page on iTunes, because that's pretty awesome.

01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:41.700
There's been some pretty great reviews written.

01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:46.700
Of course, people like to use the little in-jokes from the show in their reviews, and we certainly appreciate that.

01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:48.700
But then sometimes people just write things that are generally pretty cool,

01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:52.700
and I want to give a moment to actually read one of these on the air, one of the more recent ones.

01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:58.700
And then hopefully that will encourage folks to maybe leave more, because we love five-star reviews and it inflates our egos.

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:00.700
This Robert H.M. guy wrote,

01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:05.700
Named for popular Bamani artist Orange Lounge, this show, situated in San Francisco,

01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:11.700
does an outstanding job of being an intelligent, intricate look into what is reasonably current in video games.

01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:13.700
As one of the foremost independent video game podcasts,

01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:17.700
OLR, hosted by Sky Dark Soccer and Loki, continues to entertain with its rants,

01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:21.700
the always low-key but questionable input by frequent guest Shane,

01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:26.700
and more importantly, its attention to audience through the live chat during the show's Sunday night airing in the mailbag.

01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:29.700
The hosts are wonderfully funny without setting out to create comedy.

01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:33.700
Sometimes it just works best when the show breaks down in laughter.

01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:35.700
Hope you like tonight's show.

01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:41.700
Due to some bizarrely inappropriate comment, usually from Shane.

01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:42.700
Go figure.

01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:44.700
Highly recommended to video game fans of all ages.

01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:47.700
Okay, make that relatively mature audiences, but still.

01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:49.700
So thank you, Robert H.M., for that review.

01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:53.700
And all the people who've left happy, fun reviews on iTunes.

01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:55.700
Like MacMan, I see here.

01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:57.700
Mayo Nation, even though I hate mayonnaise.

01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:00.700
AJ Twist, Flaming, sure, your name got cut off.

01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:01.700
Read some of the bad reviews.

01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:02.700
And Blue Collar Murder.

01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:04.700
You want to hear a bad review?

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:06.700
No, because that will encourage people to write bad reviews.

01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:08.700
I don't want to write bad reviews.

01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:13.700
No, if you wrote a bad review, then you don't get any attention on our program, sorry.

01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:15.700
All right.

01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:16.700
That's that.

01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:18.700
So thank you guys very much for that.

01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:21.700
And let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:24.700
Eddie, thank you for being here tonight and sticking with us through the whole show.

01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:27.700
And staying away from Gattle Star Ballactica during the program.

01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:29.700
Do you have any final thoughts?

01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:31.700
Nice and fancy.

01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:32.700
Indeed.

01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:36.700
Dark Sakura, do you have any final thoughts tonight?

01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:38.700
I actually have one other.

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:39.700
What?

01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:41.700
Meh.

01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:47.700
My final thought will be reject false icons and give me a dollar.

01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:52.700
Tonight's final thought was just stolen from all of Jamie's past stuff.

01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:53.700
Loki, your final thought.

01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:57.700
My final thought, and I forgot to mention this during FAQs of the week.

01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:02.700
Comcast for some reason, I don't know if you've noticed this, Rob, or if it's even an issue with your TV.

01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:06.700
For some reason now, all the HD channels I get are not widescreen.

01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:10.700
They're all boxed, like really small.

01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:11.700
Mine are fine.

01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:13.700
It's weird, because it just started doing that now.

01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:16.700
Sounds like the user.

01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:20.700
I say beat them up.

01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:22.700
I say I'm switching to something else.

01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:23.700
All right, there you go.

01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:27.700
That's what more people need to do, because Comcast has been pissing me off a lot lately too.

01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:29.700
Not because of that, but just their general service in general.

01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:31.700
All right.

01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:35.700
But we do love Comcast, because that is the internet that gets us out to you guys.

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:37.700
So thanks for that, Comcast.

01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:39.700
All right, anyhow, that's it for this week's show.

01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:42.700
Thank you once again for downloading and supporting independent radio.

01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:44.700
We couldn't do it without you guys.

01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:45.700
Hey, why don't we do it all again next week?

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:47.700
Sound good?

01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:49.700
Yeah.

01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:54.700
All right, until then, have a meh week, and we'll see you next time.
