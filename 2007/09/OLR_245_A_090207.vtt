Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco.

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Tonight, September 2nd, 2007, Xbox Live gets a Labor Day sale, PlayStation gets a SingStar bundle, and an old PC gaming classic is now free.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
But joining us, as always, say hello to Loki.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Yes.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
How are you doing, Loki?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm fine.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
You're fine? That sounded a little bit forced.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
I'm doing okay.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
Oh, so now we've downgraded from find okay. What gives?

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
I'm running low of soda in this cup here, but luckily I brought two backups.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
How much soda do you bring to this program?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Two cans.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Two cans.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
All right, also joining us tonight, say hello to Miklatov, who's filling in in the big blue chair tonight.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Hello.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
How are you doing, Miklatov?

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
I'm fine.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
What are you playing there on your PSP?

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
It's not my PSP.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Whose PSP is it?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Matt's.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Matt's? What are you playing on Matt's PSP?

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
I am playing Katamari.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Can I show the webcam people what you're doing?

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Fine, but I'm going to miss important text.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Important dialogue and what have you.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
Dude, the king of all cosmos always says important funny things.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Well, you missed that one, I'm sorry to say.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
All right.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
Well, anyhow, yes, we do have webcam tonight for the folks that are listening live.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
We're on operator11.com.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
I do want to state, though, as we were kind of talking about last week, we're not planning on suddenly changing into a video show or a video podcast.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
It's just that some of our live listeners wanted to see us while we were taping live, so here we are.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
The webcam's on.

02:10.000 --> 02:17.000
But operator11 has some funky rules, and it's supposedly going to shut off after 40 minutes, and so we won't be able to archive until part B again.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
But the good news is that operator11 saves an archive of the file for a long time, so if you're listening to the podcast and you wonder to yourself,

02:23.000 --> 02:29.000
I wonder what this looks like being taped live, you can go over to operator11.com and look for our feed on there and see it.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
I want to see how fat all the hosts look on camera and then find out.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
And then you can love us long time.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Yes, you can.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
I just named my island in Katamari.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
What is your island in Katamari?

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
It's Poop Island.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
That's lovely.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Cracks me up.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Do you get to name those yourself?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
I played the Katamari on the PSP.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
I don't know.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
It just asked me to name the island, so I named it Poop Island.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
My island was named Slavery Island.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Why did you name it that?

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
I don't know.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
All right.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Let's start off tonight's show, as we always do, talking about how is your gaming week.

02:59.000 --> 03:06.000
Dark Sakura starts us off, but she's not here, so I'll go to Shane, also known as Miklotov, first, since obviously he's playing me and my Katamari.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
So I'm playing me and my Katamari.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
And how is it?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I hate the controls a lot.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
It's really bad to control, but it's still funny, and that's what really counts in Katamari.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
What else have you been playing this week?

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
Metroid Prime 3, which is the coolest.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
What do you like about Metroid Prime 3?

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
It's fun.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
What a very descriptive answer you're giving us here.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Well, that was a terrible question.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Sorry.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Why do you think Metroid Prime 3 is so fun?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
What is it about the game that appeals to you?

03:40.000 --> 03:55.000
Well, I like the fact that the controls are really cool, and I like the Metroid Prime series, and I like the fact that—spoilers are coming up—I got to fight Ridley, and it was really fun, and I had to shoot him in his mouth.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
And I was falling down this big shaft the whole time, and it was really cool.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
So you have to fight somebody while you're falling down?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Yes.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Is there a chance that you'll ever hit the ground?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Probably not.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Did you just keep falling forever?

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
I think you fall forever until you beat Ridley or Ridley kills you.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
All right.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Also, is there anything else you're giving me?

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
I started playing Suikoden V again.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
I've owned it since it came out, and I worked on it, but I never actually played it, really.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Can you say what you did on the game?

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Yeah, I've said before.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
I don't remember.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
I did text.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
I can't remember.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
There's secrets you can say and things you can't say on air.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
And yeah, I'm just now starting to play it.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
See, if I asked you if there was a Suikoden VI, could you talk about that?

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
I could not talk about that.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
You can neither confirm nor deny those reports?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Not.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
All right.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Fine.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Fair enough.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Anything else?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
No.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
All right.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Let's go over to Loki.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
And while Loki talks about his gaming week, I'm going to go grab another cookie.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Do you want a peanut butter cookie, Loki?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Yes.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Awesome.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
I want a peanut butter cookie.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
All right.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
I'm going to go get that.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Stupid cookies.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Loki, tell us about your gaming week.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
My gaming week was a lot of Xbox 360 stuff.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
I played a lot of demos, including some stuff I've already played before, like beautiful

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Katamari.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.520
Ace Combat 6.

05:03.520 --> 05:08.640
I think I tried a little bit of Juice 2 and didn't like that still.

05:08.640 --> 05:14.460
Then, of course, I played Bioshock, which is still awesome and continues to get even

05:14.460 --> 05:16.520
more awesome as I play it.

05:16.520 --> 05:19.860
So definitely, ooh, cookie.

05:19.860 --> 05:21.120
And let's see.

05:21.120 --> 05:25.540
Other games I've played, Call of Duty 4, I actually got to try a little bit of the multiplayer

05:25.540 --> 05:26.820
beta.

05:26.820 --> 05:30.980
And I had no doubts going into it that the game's going to be awesome, and it's just

05:30.980 --> 05:31.980
amazing.

05:31.980 --> 05:34.200
It still plays like Call of Duty 2 and 3.

05:34.200 --> 05:38.820
I do like how they've updated the radar a little bit so you can actually get a better

05:38.820 --> 05:42.000
idea of where people are firing from, so that's pretty cool.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.120
And also the replays of when you get killed, they're pretty cool.

05:46.120 --> 05:47.600
So that's neat.

05:47.600 --> 05:54.380
And then other stuff, I actually played more Settlers of Catan on Xbox Live Arcade.

05:54.380 --> 06:00.480
And I thought about, oh, I played Street Trace New York.

06:00.480 --> 06:05.120
It's that hoverboard racing combat game or something.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.680
That game's really weird.

06:06.680 --> 06:13.880
It kind of reminds me of like Crossing Sonic Riders with that crappy, was it that bumper

06:13.880 --> 06:16.960
car game that came with Windows 98 or something.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.960
I don't even remember what the hell that's called.

06:18.960 --> 06:21.160
But something like that.

06:21.160 --> 06:22.680
Not recommending that game, though.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.240
It's quite boring.

06:24.240 --> 06:28.600
But I tried the demo, and that was kind of fun.

06:28.600 --> 06:29.600
Let's see.

06:29.600 --> 06:35.600
Other stuff, on PSP, I was playing a lot of We Love Katamari, and I don't know why.

06:35.600 --> 06:42.200
I absolutely hate the control in that game, but I'm stuck playing it and loving it.

06:42.200 --> 06:45.720
The only thing I wish they would do is just port that to PlayStation 2, because I know

06:45.720 --> 06:48.920
they like doing those ports from PSP to PlayStation 2.

06:48.920 --> 06:49.920
Just do that.

06:49.920 --> 06:55.240
I mean, I'll spend the $20 to actually buy the game, so I think that's what they need

06:55.240 --> 06:58.400
to do to make at least the controls a little bit better.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.720
And other than that, I believe that was my gaming week.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.640
Oh, Saints Row Multiplayer.

07:03.640 --> 07:10.080
We finally, and I wish I had pictures because I haven't finished setting it up yet, but

07:10.080 --> 07:12.720
our game room set up at work is finally done.

07:12.720 --> 07:17.340
We have five Xbox 360s land and have been playing Saints Row on it, and it's absolutely

07:17.340 --> 07:19.160
fun multiplayer.

07:19.160 --> 07:24.980
The only thing I really hate, though, is the system link multiplayer on it, you can't change

07:24.980 --> 07:27.440
the way your character looks, so everybody looks the same.

07:27.440 --> 07:31.960
You can change it on live, but you can't change it in system link, which doesn't make any

07:31.960 --> 07:33.680
sense whatsoever.

07:33.680 --> 07:38.800
But hopefully they'll fix that with a sequel, I don't know.

07:38.800 --> 07:43.480
But hopefully I'll get some actual pictures of the setup.

07:43.480 --> 07:49.800
I'm still putting the 360s in clear cases, which by the way, if I were to review the

07:49.800 --> 07:52.200
clear cases I bought, they absolutely suck.

07:52.200 --> 07:55.560
But they look pretty, so that was my gaming week.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.680
That was a hell of a lot of gaming week.

07:57.680 --> 08:01.160
There's a lot of comments going on in the chat room here at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

08:01.160 --> 08:04.640
Again, our chat room location is chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

08:04.640 --> 08:07.600
If you guys are in the Operator 11 chat, since we are doing the video tonight, I just want

08:07.600 --> 08:08.640
to get out there.

08:08.640 --> 08:12.040
We do not read the Op 11 chat because it's on a laptop that's on the other side of the

08:12.040 --> 08:14.800
room and it's hard for us to read, so you have to be in a regular chat room.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.560
I play Contra IV for the DS.

08:16.560 --> 08:17.880
How did you do that?

08:17.880 --> 08:22.400
Our Konami rep brought in a DS with a dev thing in it.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.280
That's kind of important.

08:24.280 --> 08:25.280
That's a big one.

08:25.280 --> 08:26.280
What's Contra IV?

08:26.280 --> 08:27.720
It's awesome.

08:27.720 --> 08:32.200
It's exactly like you would imagine a sequel to Contra III being.

08:32.200 --> 08:41.080
It's true 2D side-scrolling action, it's Contra, it's awesome, and not that sort of awesome

08:41.080 --> 08:46.160
that was a neo-Contra and stuff like that.

08:46.160 --> 08:48.600
That was pretty cool.

08:48.600 --> 08:54.380
The other thing, I didn't play this game, but I dogged on it last week, Cruisin' for

08:54.380 --> 08:55.380
the Wii.

08:55.380 --> 09:02.520
I actually saw the game in motion in a trailer and it looked not as bad, let me put it that

09:02.520 --> 09:03.520
way.

09:03.520 --> 09:08.440
It looked very low poly count, it almost looked like a DS game ported to the Wii, but it was

09:08.440 --> 09:13.400
running at 60 frames per second, so while it may not have been too pretty to look at,

09:13.400 --> 09:16.800
it was really smooth and looked pretty fun.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.480
If it's cheap enough, let me try it.

09:18.480 --> 09:21.320
I want to go back to Contra IV for a minute because this is a game a lot of people are

09:21.320 --> 09:23.460
very excited about.

09:23.460 --> 09:25.280
How does it use the vertical?

09:25.280 --> 09:26.280
How does it use the two screens?

09:26.280 --> 09:27.560
Is it just a very vertical game?

09:27.560 --> 09:29.080
It's a very vertical game.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.840
It's very tall.

09:30.840 --> 09:36.640
If you'll see stuff falling down and you basically get to shoot at stuff, there's a grappling

09:36.640 --> 09:40.680
hook in it so you can grapple with stuff and crawl on bars and whatnot.

09:40.680 --> 09:44.320
Does it use a touch screen at all or did they just say fuck it?

09:44.320 --> 09:48.040
For the brief time that I had with the game, it did not use a touch screen.

09:48.040 --> 09:51.080
You have no idea if they have the top-down modes like they had in the old Super Nintendo

09:51.080 --> 09:52.080
Contra?

09:52.080 --> 09:55.360
I don't think they do, but it would be cool if they did.

09:55.360 --> 09:56.360
Very cool.

09:56.360 --> 09:57.360
All right.

09:57.360 --> 09:58.360
Wait.

09:58.360 --> 09:59.360
Wait.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.360
Wait.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.360
What?

10:01.360 --> 10:02.360
Let's tell everybody what my new island name is.

10:02.360 --> 10:03.360
Yes.

10:03.360 --> 10:04.360
On Miyamakatamari, what did you name it?

10:04.360 --> 10:06.960
I named it Penn Island.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.520
Penn Island.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.360
Think about that one for a minute.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.360
Penn Island.

10:12.360 --> 10:13.360
P-E-N-I-S-L-A-M-D.

10:13.360 --> 10:14.360
It's so good.

10:14.360 --> 10:15.360
Hilarious.

10:15.360 --> 10:16.360
That's comedy gold.

10:16.360 --> 10:25.080
Anyhow, I was going to go to the chat room here and read some comments, but we got a

10:25.080 --> 10:26.480
little bit sidetracked here.

10:26.480 --> 10:27.480
Again, chat.orangessoundsradio.com.

10:27.480 --> 10:31.360
Somebody was talking about Bioshock here earlier.

10:31.360 --> 10:34.480
Drunami said, Bioshock is fucking scary.

10:34.480 --> 10:36.000
Did you get scared by Bioshock?

10:36.000 --> 10:41.400
There was one time, I didn't get scared, but it startled me a little bit, where you're

10:41.400 --> 10:49.920
investigating this dentist's office and there's pipes breaking and it's freezing stuff.

10:49.920 --> 10:53.680
All of a sudden, one of the pipes breaks and it gets a little foggy and you turn around

10:53.680 --> 10:56.000
and there's a guy standing right there.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.920
I thought he was dead at first.

10:57.920 --> 11:00.760
The first time they played through it and then the second time I knew he was going to

11:00.760 --> 11:01.760
be there.

11:01.760 --> 11:06.000
I turned around and just stood there for a second and then he finally attacked me.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
It was kind of freaky.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.400
You turn around and all of a sudden, boom, there's someone there.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.640
Picker Uno says, I got scared by the demo of Bioshock.

11:13.640 --> 11:14.640
I did too a little bit.

11:14.640 --> 11:15.640
I have to admit.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.960
I got a little bit scared from just the demo alone because it's crazy.

11:17.960 --> 11:25.720
The game gets so awesome and I can't imagine Andrew Ryan, the main guy who built this whole

11:25.720 --> 11:28.880
city as Walt Disney.

11:28.880 --> 11:34.320
I can replace Walt Disney in this and just like, I don't know.

11:34.320 --> 11:37.440
You're going to make me not want to go back to Disneyland and that makes me sad because

11:37.440 --> 11:39.440
I love Disneyland.

11:39.440 --> 11:44.960
Andrew Ryan just reminds me of Walt Disney or like a really weird version of Walt Disney.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.520
Maybe they based it off him, who knows.

11:47.520 --> 11:51.240
I was hoping to get some emails from people who didn't like Bioshock, but I didn't see

11:51.240 --> 11:53.120
anything in the mail bag when I last checked.

11:53.120 --> 11:54.120
I don't know.

11:54.120 --> 11:56.480
We'll open up the email bag a little later and let you know if we heard from any people

11:56.480 --> 11:58.280
that didn't like Bioshock.

11:58.280 --> 12:02.520
Anyhow, let's go ahead and go on to My Gaming Week.

12:02.520 --> 12:03.520
I want to talk about My Gaming Week.

12:03.520 --> 12:06.760
I've also been playing Metroid Prime 3, but not quite as much as Shane has.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.600
I don't want to give this game a full review yet, but I can already tell you I like it

12:09.600 --> 12:11.200
better than 1 and 2.

12:11.200 --> 12:15.420
Because 1 and 2, I still had to get over that shock of, oh my god, Metroid is not 2D anymore.

12:15.420 --> 12:18.960
What did they do to my game?

12:18.960 --> 12:22.360
I don't want to label myself as somebody who just hates games automatically because they're

12:22.360 --> 12:25.880
3D, but you have to remember Metroid is a series that's very near and dear to my heart

12:25.880 --> 12:30.600
and it was very hard to kind of conceptualize Metroid in a 3D world.

12:30.600 --> 12:33.160
I don't think the first two games are bad games by any means.

12:33.160 --> 12:36.140
I couldn't get into them because they didn't feel like Metroid to me.

12:36.140 --> 12:40.780
But this third game, I have to admit, the gimmicky controls are actually pretty awesome

12:40.780 --> 12:45.440
and done pretty well considering the limited amount of buttons that a Wii controller has.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.500
It's pretty fun.

12:46.500 --> 12:51.400
And I also like the fact that Metroid Prime 3 kind of breaks the mold of when you start

12:51.400 --> 12:57.320
in the world, you are missing all of your gear, like you only have your suit and a gun.

12:57.320 --> 13:02.480
And when you start in Metroid Prime 3, you already have like a double jump move.

13:02.480 --> 13:07.080
You already have, or you get the ability to shoot missiles rather quickly.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.800
You can already turn into a ball and a lot of that stuff.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.320
So I think that's kind of cool.

13:11.320 --> 13:15.560
Escapist in the chat room asks, do you have to scan everything in Metroid Prime 3 to understand

13:15.560 --> 13:16.960
what the heck is going on?

13:16.960 --> 13:17.960
Yes.

13:17.960 --> 13:18.960
No.

13:18.960 --> 13:19.960
Yes.

13:19.960 --> 13:20.960
No.

13:20.960 --> 13:21.960
But it helps.

13:21.960 --> 13:22.960
No.

13:22.960 --> 13:25.040
The scanning in Metroid Prime 3 only, it's not to tell you what's going on, it's to tell

13:25.040 --> 13:28.840
you now what you need to do to get through this room.

13:28.840 --> 13:33.640
It's not like, oh, you know, there's lore stuff you can read, but...

13:33.640 --> 13:34.640
It's not mandatory.

13:34.640 --> 13:35.640
It's not mandatory.

13:35.640 --> 13:39.820
I did notice it was a little easier to get into story-wise than one or two was, because

13:39.820 --> 13:44.260
you could go up and you could talk to people and it kind of made the story a little better

13:44.260 --> 13:45.440
for me.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.680
It wasn't just scanning things and reading things.

13:47.680 --> 13:51.600
Also, I will point out though, scanning things appears to be the way that you get most of

13:51.600 --> 13:52.880
the tokens in the game.

13:52.880 --> 13:56.700
I know there hasn't been a lot of talk about the tokens, which a couple weeks ago was labeled

13:56.700 --> 14:02.280
by a lot of the big game blogs as, like, Metroid Prime's achievement system, but it's not really

14:02.280 --> 14:03.280
achievements.

14:03.280 --> 14:07.440
The tokens that you unlock by scanning things or doing certain things in the game, you can

14:07.440 --> 14:12.320
use to unlock soundtrack things, graphics and art and all those types of things.

14:12.320 --> 14:16.800
It's kind of like, basically, Mortal Kombat, how you got the tokens from beating things

14:16.800 --> 14:21.640
and you could use them in the crypt or whatever it was called and unlock special stuff.

14:21.640 --> 14:28.080
Also, it uses Wii Connect 24 because for every 100 enemies you kill, you get a green token

14:28.080 --> 14:33.800
and you can send the green tokens to other people and they can use them.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.740
Or, I guess, no, it's a black token and when you send it to someone else, it's green or

14:36.740 --> 14:41.600
something like that, but you have to use friend codes to make that work.

14:41.600 --> 14:45.520
And then you said, Shane, you are pretty sure you got an actual achievement in the game

14:45.520 --> 14:46.520
or something.

14:46.520 --> 14:47.520
Oh, yeah.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.520
I was using my ice missile.

14:48.520 --> 14:51.320
Hey, while I'm talking, smell this alcohol.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.920
I'll talk about the alcohol in a minute, folks.

14:53.920 --> 14:58.920
I was using the ice missile on just enemies randomly.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.200
I want to drink it first.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.200
Not yet.

15:01.200 --> 15:05.800
No, I'm going to drink it first.

15:05.800 --> 15:12.480
I used the ice missile on some lizard thing and once I did that, one of the little cards

15:12.480 --> 15:20.840
you get for every 100 kills, I guess for certain random tasks you do, came up and was like

15:20.840 --> 15:25.920
a chilled lizard or something like that, like a terrible achievement name.

15:25.920 --> 15:26.920
And it was cool.

15:26.920 --> 15:27.920
I like that.

15:27.920 --> 15:28.920
It's achievements.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.320
And you know what you can do with that?

15:30.320 --> 15:31.320
Nothing.

15:31.320 --> 15:32.320
Absolutely nothing.

15:32.320 --> 15:36.840
Just like the Xbox 360 achievements.

15:36.840 --> 15:39.700
By the way, the liquor talk is because it is a three-day weekend, so some of us have

15:39.700 --> 15:45.040
chosen to do a little drinking tonight, which leads me to the responsibility spiel.

15:45.040 --> 15:48.960
Of course, we are all over 21 and Matt's not drinking tonight because he didn't find a

15:48.960 --> 15:50.080
designated driver.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.600
I could have, but I figured that...

15:51.600 --> 15:52.600
Loser?

15:52.600 --> 15:53.600
He's not into it tonight.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.800
You said you were sick and were possibly not going to be drinking, so that's why I didn't

15:56.800 --> 15:58.000
want to be the only one.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.800
Yes, I have been sick, but I figure it's only Tylenol that I'm taking, so I should be okay,

16:02.800 --> 16:03.800
right?

16:03.800 --> 16:08.760
Well, yeah, unless you die, in which case then we would have been terribly wrong.

16:08.760 --> 16:09.760
All right.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.080
Well, anyhow, what else?

16:12.080 --> 16:14.800
But Shane's here and Shane's drinking, although he doesn't like his blue drink, even though

16:14.800 --> 16:15.800
he likes the smell of it.

16:15.800 --> 16:16.800
I like it.

16:16.800 --> 16:17.800
I like the smell.

16:17.800 --> 16:20.320
It's like an alcoholic blueberry muffin to me.

16:20.320 --> 16:21.320
It's really weird.

16:21.320 --> 16:22.320
You want to try this one?

16:22.320 --> 16:23.320
This pomegranate thingy?

16:23.320 --> 16:24.320
I haven't drank from it yet.

16:24.320 --> 16:25.320
Yes.

16:25.320 --> 16:29.440
I was going to say, we are all over 21 and we drink responsibly, blah, blah, blah, and

16:29.440 --> 16:32.840
kids shouldn't drink, blah, blah, blah, and so on, so yeah.

16:32.840 --> 16:33.840
Is that any good?

16:33.840 --> 16:38.720
I don't know if it's the combination of the two, but that tastes like that gamer-fueled

16:38.720 --> 16:41.000
Mountain Dew to me, which is not a pleasant taste.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Really?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
This is pomegranate fusion smearing off.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.780
We're taking it easy tonight, so we'll see.

16:45.780 --> 16:46.780
Let's see.

16:46.780 --> 16:47.780
What else did I do in my gaming week?

16:47.780 --> 16:52.840
I bought on the Xbox 360, which of course is a Japanese RPG made by a lot of the people

16:52.840 --> 16:54.120
that were involved with Final Fantasy.

16:54.120 --> 16:59.080
You have Sakaguchi, who made the first Final Fantasy, Nobui Matsu does the music again,

16:59.080 --> 17:02.320
and then I believe, who is it, Akira Toriyama, is that his name?

17:02.320 --> 17:03.320
Something like that.

17:03.320 --> 17:04.320
Did the Dragon Ball Z characters?

17:04.320 --> 17:05.680
Those are the characters in this game.

17:05.680 --> 17:08.300
Blue Dragon is a good game.

17:08.300 --> 17:09.760
Is it a great game?

17:09.760 --> 17:10.760
No.

17:10.760 --> 17:11.760
Is it a 10?

17:11.760 --> 17:12.760
No.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.600
Is it going to leave a lot of people disappointed because they were expecting...

17:14.600 --> 17:15.600
Blue Dragon...

17:15.600 --> 17:16.600
Hold on.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.200
I'm going to have your opinion in a minute.

17:18.200 --> 17:22.360
Is it going to leave a lot of people disappointed because you hear these big names attached

17:22.360 --> 17:27.080
to it, and you are expecting greatness, or like a Final Fantasy XIII or something?

17:27.080 --> 17:28.080
Yes.

17:28.080 --> 17:29.240
It's going to leave a lot of people disappointed.

17:29.240 --> 17:33.040
But it's not a bad game by any means, and certainly it's the type of game that the Xbox

17:33.040 --> 17:34.920
360 is severely lacking.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.560
But here's the problems I see with Blue Dragon.

17:36.560 --> 17:37.560
It's not with the battle system.

17:37.560 --> 17:38.980
I love the battle system.

17:38.980 --> 17:44.560
It's a real throwback to an old Super Nintendo RPG, and it feels very similar to Final Fantasy

17:44.560 --> 17:47.360
V with some elements in the act of time kind of thrown in.

17:47.360 --> 17:52.560
You can charge attacks and drop them in certain places in the act of time, and depending on

17:52.560 --> 17:54.680
how long you charge, it does more damage.

17:54.680 --> 17:59.680
So I personally like the battle system as a throwback to old RPGs, but the story is

17:59.680 --> 18:01.320
kind of meh.

18:01.320 --> 18:04.880
And you would think with these names attached to it would be an awesome story, but the problem

18:04.880 --> 18:08.480
with the story is that it just kind of comes out of nowhere, you know?

18:08.480 --> 18:11.160
And you don't understand what the bad guy's motivations are.

18:11.160 --> 18:19.640
I mean, literally, you go up into this big bubble in the sky.

18:19.640 --> 18:29.480
Your town is being attacked by this land shark.

18:29.480 --> 18:33.520
This shark is going around destroying buildings and things, and then you basically manage

18:33.520 --> 18:37.400
to sort of catch the land shark, but it drags you into this place.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.400
Would you say it's a street shark?

18:39.400 --> 18:40.680
No, it's a land shark.

18:40.680 --> 18:41.680
That's what they call it.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.520
And it even has a fin that sticks out above the ground.

18:43.520 --> 18:47.200
I thought it may have been a reference back to that really crappy cartoon series.

18:47.200 --> 18:52.160
Eventually, the land shark takes them underground, and then the land shark blasts off into space,

18:52.160 --> 18:56.360
and they're on it, or not, I shouldn't say into space, but into the sky.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.160
And then they finally meet the bad guy.

18:58.160 --> 19:01.240
You encounter the main bad guy within the first 30 minutes to an hour of the game, and

19:01.240 --> 19:02.520
they're like, why are you doing this?

19:02.520 --> 19:06.320
And he says, because I want to hear your screams.

19:06.320 --> 19:09.080
I'm like, what kind of motivation is that?

19:09.080 --> 19:10.080
Ooh, pedophile.

19:10.080 --> 19:14.960
It's like, that kind of uber generic bad guy thing kind of worked back in the day when

19:14.960 --> 19:18.440
there wasn't a whole lot of way to flesh out the story, but I don't know so much now.

19:18.440 --> 19:24.080
So it's got a very awkward story, and I cannot stand the little cute character Maru Maru.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.720
I cannot stand what they did with his voice.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.160
It's awful.

19:28.160 --> 19:32.400
Otherwise, those little bitches aside, I mean, it is a good game.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.560
If you're a fan of role-playing games and you have a 360, it's worth your time to check

19:35.560 --> 19:39.960
out, because importantly, it comes down to how is the game, and the game is fine.

19:39.960 --> 19:42.120
The music's really good and all that stuff.

19:42.120 --> 19:47.360
I'm sorry, but that gameplay is boring, and it has led me to call it Blue Dragon.

19:47.360 --> 19:52.720
I'm noticing DJ Disentery in chat says, because you want to hear their screams, sounds like

19:52.720 --> 19:57.440
Shane's reason for shaking babies, referring to an earlier episode of the program.

19:57.440 --> 20:00.400
Or just in general.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.880
Why did you not like Blue Dragon?

20:01.880 --> 20:04.240
You're someone that liked old RPGs, right?

20:04.240 --> 20:10.520
But we've come so far, and then to be thrown this battle system that's absolutely boring,

20:10.520 --> 20:15.120
it's just like, I don't know, it doesn't sit right with me.

20:15.120 --> 20:20.720
And the pacing seems slow, and granted, this is all, the only thing I've played is the

20:20.720 --> 20:22.520
demo that was on Xbox Live.

20:22.520 --> 20:26.120
See, I don't think that, I think the demo, now that I've played the actual game, the

20:26.120 --> 20:27.120
demo fucking sucks.

20:27.120 --> 20:30.880
The demo is not a good representation of the game, I think.

20:30.880 --> 20:37.600
I just, it looks overly generic, and not interesting.

20:37.600 --> 20:44.400
And yeah, that Maru Maru guy is, like, the reason we have mute buttons on TVs.

20:44.400 --> 20:49.600
I'm looking in the chat room here, Pika Uno says, Blue Drag On?

20:49.600 --> 20:50.600
Get it?

20:50.600 --> 20:51.600
Because it drags on.

20:51.600 --> 20:52.600
Get it?

20:52.600 --> 20:53.600
Yes, I get it.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.600
So maybe you could call it Boo Drag On, maybe, I don't know.

20:56.600 --> 20:59.160
I'm just going to stick with Boo Dragon.

20:59.160 --> 21:01.960
Mark Tetsuya says, Does Blue Dragon have the original voice?

21:01.960 --> 21:02.960
Is this an option?

21:02.960 --> 21:03.960
Yes, it does.

21:03.960 --> 21:08.480
You can choose the English language, a Japanese language, all with English subtitles, or you

21:08.480 --> 21:10.020
can have French language.

21:10.020 --> 21:14.080
So if you want all your characters to speak French, you can have that as well, which I'm

21:14.080 --> 21:15.080
sure is interesting.

21:15.080 --> 21:17.520
That might make the game a little better playing it in French.

21:17.520 --> 21:18.520
You think?

21:18.520 --> 21:19.520
Yes.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.000
But I think that one guy's voice is still going to be very annoying.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.320
But it would be.

21:24.320 --> 21:25.320
That's literally what he sounds like.

21:25.320 --> 21:26.320
It's horrible.

21:26.320 --> 21:27.320
It would be French annoying.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.320
It might be cool.

21:29.320 --> 21:36.960
Sounds like teen girl squad.

21:36.960 --> 21:43.240
Escapist in chat room says, Well, now to wait for Eternal Sonata and Lost Odyssey.

21:43.240 --> 21:45.520
Eternal Sonata is going to be awesome, but this will hold me over.

21:45.520 --> 21:49.880
That was the best thing about Blue Dragon is inside the case was a card pimping out

21:49.880 --> 21:54.320
Eternal Sonata, because that's a good game.

21:54.320 --> 21:57.040
But again, you're basing your opinions on these games off a demo.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.040
How dare you?

21:58.040 --> 21:59.040
I'm watching you play it.

21:59.040 --> 22:01.480
By Eternal Sonata, you haven't even played the real game yet.

22:01.480 --> 22:02.480
You've only played a demo.

22:02.480 --> 22:05.040
And it was the best demo ever.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.040
I'm trying to think.

22:06.040 --> 22:08.800
What were some good demos that were bad games?

22:08.800 --> 22:10.120
Loki, help me out here.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.760
Good demos that were bad games.

22:11.760 --> 22:14.480
Can you think of anything?

22:14.480 --> 22:16.320
I know there's got to be something.

22:16.320 --> 22:19.840
I'm going to think about this one.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.840
Chat room, I need your help.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.400
Good demos, bad games.

22:24.400 --> 22:25.800
Did Perfect Dark have a good demo?

22:25.800 --> 22:27.280
I don't know.

22:27.280 --> 22:29.640
Perfect Dark Zero, sorry.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.440
Not to be confused with the original Perfect Dark, sorry.

22:32.440 --> 22:33.440
Cameo maybe?

22:33.440 --> 22:34.440
I've never played that.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.240
Escapist says Final Fantasy 12.

22:36.240 --> 22:37.760
I freaking love Final Fantasy 12.

22:37.760 --> 22:38.760
What are you talking about?

22:38.760 --> 22:41.440
Who that person from the chat room, because they're idiots.

22:41.440 --> 22:42.920
Fireboma says Devil Dice.

22:42.920 --> 22:44.840
I don't even know what that is.

22:44.840 --> 22:48.280
Pika Uno says Cameo rules, shut the fuck up.

22:48.280 --> 22:49.280
It's okay.

22:49.280 --> 22:50.560
I wouldn't say it rules, but it's okay.

22:50.560 --> 22:51.560
It rules.

22:51.560 --> 22:52.560
It's sucking.

22:52.560 --> 22:54.200
All right.

22:54.200 --> 22:57.840
Let's get into tonight's gaming news, since we've talked about our gaming week for far

22:57.840 --> 22:58.840
too long.

22:58.840 --> 23:00.440
I was going to get into some housekeeping.

23:00.440 --> 23:03.920
Pretty much the only thing I had to tell you guys was that we are doing a little bit of

23:03.920 --> 23:06.720
drinking tonight, so if we sound a little off, that's why it's a three-day weekend.

23:06.720 --> 23:07.720
Why not?

23:07.720 --> 23:09.240
I'm just going to be off, period.

23:09.240 --> 23:12.360
And that we are up on Operator 11, if you want to check us out there, or the archive

23:12.360 --> 23:13.360
should be up there.

23:13.360 --> 23:14.920
I don't know about this video quality, though.

23:14.920 --> 23:16.160
It looks like it's running really slow.

23:16.160 --> 23:17.240
We'll see, though.

23:17.240 --> 23:18.240
I'm just moving really slow.

23:18.240 --> 23:20.920
As long as it doesn't kill the screen.

23:20.920 --> 23:23.680
We're not going to play to the camera, because we don't want to be a TV show.

23:23.680 --> 23:27.480
We're still Orange Lounge Radio, but to answer the calls of our live listeners who wanted

23:27.480 --> 23:28.960
us to get a webcam, we finally did.

23:28.960 --> 23:29.960
So there you have it.

23:29.960 --> 23:30.960
Wow.

23:30.960 --> 23:31.960
Enjoy.

23:31.960 --> 23:32.960
That's really...

23:32.960 --> 23:34.220
I know.

23:34.220 --> 23:35.220
That's really awesome.

23:35.220 --> 23:36.220
Figure.

23:36.220 --> 23:37.220
All right.

23:37.220 --> 23:38.220
Anyhow.

23:38.220 --> 23:39.220
Wow.

23:39.220 --> 23:40.220
FootyMonster agrees with Final Fantasy XII.

23:40.220 --> 23:41.560
I second Final Fantasy XII.

23:41.560 --> 23:42.560
Demo was great.

23:42.560 --> 23:43.720
Game sucked.

23:43.720 --> 23:44.720
You guys are mean.

23:44.720 --> 23:45.720
Yeah.

23:45.720 --> 23:46.720
How about Final Fantasy VIII?

23:46.720 --> 23:47.720
The game was awesome.

23:47.720 --> 23:48.720
Yes.

23:48.720 --> 23:49.720
How about Final Fantasy VIII?

23:49.720 --> 23:50.720
I love Final Fantasy VIII.

23:50.720 --> 23:51.720
Excellent example.

23:51.720 --> 23:52.720
That is such a good game.

23:52.720 --> 23:53.720
I don't even remember the demo.

23:53.720 --> 23:54.720
Ruined by a battle system.

23:54.720 --> 23:55.720
Where was the demo?

23:55.720 --> 23:56.720
And the battle system was great.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.720
The demo was with...

23:58.720 --> 23:59.720
What did they put the Final Fantasy VIII?

23:59.720 --> 24:00.720
Vagrant Story.

24:00.720 --> 24:01.720
Was it really?

24:01.720 --> 24:02.720
Yeah.

24:02.720 --> 24:03.720
They put the Final Fantasy VIII demo with some other Square game.

24:03.720 --> 24:04.720
I remember that.

24:04.720 --> 24:05.720
All right.

24:05.720 --> 24:06.720
Let's get into the gaming news.

24:06.720 --> 24:08.840
I don't have any housekeeping otherwise.

24:08.840 --> 24:10.800
Visit our website, OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

24:10.800 --> 24:15.500
Leave us five-star reviews on iTunes, pretty please, or elsewhere around the web.

24:15.500 --> 24:18.220
Tell two people you know about our program, and so on and so on.

24:18.220 --> 24:19.220
Live journal MySpace.

24:19.220 --> 24:20.220
Add us there.

24:20.220 --> 24:21.220
Blah, blah, blah.

24:21.220 --> 24:22.220
Gaming news.

24:22.220 --> 24:23.220
I don't know.

24:23.220 --> 24:24.220
Can I?

24:24.220 --> 24:25.220
You, Loki, or me?

24:25.220 --> 24:26.220
You are.

24:26.220 --> 24:27.220
I am.

24:27.220 --> 24:28.220
Oh, crap.

24:28.220 --> 24:29.220
Oh, because I have a follow-up to something we talked about last week.

24:29.220 --> 24:30.800
Last week, we were talking about Mass Effect is getting delayed to December.

24:30.800 --> 24:31.840
Well, guess what?

24:31.840 --> 24:36.680
That turned out to not be true, because Mass Effect is now set to be released on November

24:36.680 --> 24:41.320
20th, which is getting close to December, but not quite there yet.

24:41.320 --> 24:45.680
So that should be out just in time for the big day after Thanksgiving holiday.

24:45.680 --> 24:48.720
And of course, a lot of people definitely looking forward to this game.

24:48.720 --> 24:49.720
They call it an RPG.

24:49.720 --> 24:52.240
It's like sci-fi.

24:52.240 --> 24:56.920
Looks to have a little bit of first-person shooter elements in it, though.

24:56.920 --> 25:00.360
I don't want to call it a first-person shooter, but some elements is kind of mixed up.

25:00.360 --> 25:06.560
I would say it's like what Phantasy Star Online should have been.

25:06.560 --> 25:07.560
Sort of.

25:07.560 --> 25:08.560
Except it's offline.

25:08.560 --> 25:09.560
Well, we'll see.

25:09.560 --> 25:10.560
You know, futuristic.

25:10.560 --> 25:11.560
Wait, wait.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.600
Phantasy Star Online or Phantasy Star Universe?

25:13.600 --> 25:14.600
Either.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.600
Phantasy Star Online was a great game.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.720
Universe was a piece of crap.

25:18.720 --> 25:24.060
I liked Universe's single-player story, and the fact that it was online was just a bonus.

25:24.060 --> 25:25.960
But it was a little bit repetitive.

25:25.960 --> 25:26.960
I'll give you that.

25:26.960 --> 25:27.960
It was a little bit repetitive.

25:27.960 --> 25:28.960
You didn't like online?

25:28.960 --> 25:29.960
It was okay.

25:29.960 --> 25:32.480
All you do is run around and hit things.

25:32.480 --> 25:33.480
It was great.

25:33.480 --> 25:35.280
It was fun to play with voice chat.

25:35.280 --> 25:36.280
It was fun to play with other people.

25:36.280 --> 25:37.280
It was a chatroom with swords.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.280
It was a terrible game fight.

25:38.280 --> 25:39.280
That's what it was.

25:39.280 --> 25:40.280
It was a chatroom with swords.

25:40.280 --> 25:41.280
Whatever.

25:41.280 --> 25:43.280
At least they didn't move as funky as they did in the old Phantasy Star Online.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.580
At least there's that much.

25:45.580 --> 25:49.120
Anyways, something less exciting now.

25:49.120 --> 25:55.840
Apparently there's some pictures that leaked out on Flickr of a new Xbox Live arcade game

25:55.840 --> 25:58.360
featuring the Toyota Yaris.

25:58.360 --> 26:02.720
Yes, those wonderful commercials featuring the car doing stupid things, yet not really

26:02.720 --> 26:04.720
talking about the car.

26:04.720 --> 26:06.120
Great.

26:06.120 --> 26:08.760
It's going to be an adver game.

26:08.760 --> 26:09.760
I don't know.

26:09.760 --> 26:12.840
This was at, I think, some Toyota event.

26:12.840 --> 26:17.920
I hope we don't pay for this because I sure as hell am not going to pay for this.

26:17.920 --> 26:20.760
Now, is this a racing game?

26:20.760 --> 26:21.760
What the hell would you do with it?

26:21.760 --> 26:22.760
It looks like a racing game.

26:22.760 --> 26:23.760
Is there screenshots?

26:23.760 --> 26:30.880
Well, there are screenshots of a shot of people playing the game, but it doesn't really show

26:30.880 --> 26:31.880
much.

26:31.880 --> 26:36.600
It was at the Evolution FGC EVO West 2007 event.

26:36.600 --> 26:39.840
Yeah, I don't know.

26:39.840 --> 26:46.320
It doesn't really show me much and I could care less that this game is coming out.

26:46.320 --> 26:47.640
Hey, you know what though?

26:47.640 --> 26:52.720
If it's free and it's a decent racing game, I'm all about that.

26:52.720 --> 26:53.720
Here it is for you.

26:53.720 --> 26:57.600
If it's free and you can get achievement points from it, you'll totally play it until you

26:57.600 --> 26:58.600
unlock everything.

26:58.600 --> 27:00.840
Yeah, shut up.

27:00.840 --> 27:04.060
You know what should be an unlockable feature in a Toyota racing game, though?

27:04.060 --> 27:07.840
To be able to race Priuses, that would be awesome.

27:07.840 --> 27:09.960
Don't you think, like Al Gore's Sun Mode?

27:09.960 --> 27:12.400
Wouldn't that be fun?

27:12.400 --> 27:16.440
I don't know how fun this is going to be, but they are making a brand new movie out

27:16.440 --> 27:21.120
of another video game, because you know Hollywood loves to make movies out of video games.

27:21.120 --> 27:27.760
CP Productions is a brand new Hollywood company and they have bought the rights to make Joust.

27:27.760 --> 27:33.720
Yes, like Joust from 1983 or whenever that game came out.

27:33.720 --> 27:38.120
Remember when you had the little lance and you tried to stab the pterodactyl in the mouth

27:38.120 --> 27:39.960
and you hit the button to flap around?

27:39.960 --> 27:43.800
It's actually a pretty fun game to play two player, and it's on Xbox Live.

27:43.800 --> 27:47.080
That's right, they are going to make Joust the movie.

27:47.080 --> 27:50.900
It's being made by producers Christine Peters and Michael Cerenzi.

27:50.900 --> 27:58.600
They have worked on such notable films as Blackout and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.680
Here's a quote from Cerenzi.

28:00.680 --> 28:05.360
Joust is an arcade game that's as old as Pac-Man and has global awareness.

28:05.360 --> 28:10.160
We took one element of the game and the brand itself and built a whole new world around

28:10.160 --> 28:11.880
it for the film.

28:11.880 --> 28:14.040
So you can guess what that element is going to be.

28:14.040 --> 28:17.600
I hope it's the element of the hands coming up from the lava to pull people in the lava

28:17.600 --> 28:19.600
because that was always cool.

28:19.600 --> 28:23.440
And maybe they'll pull these producers in and make them not make this movie because

28:23.440 --> 28:25.000
it's probably going to be bad.

28:25.000 --> 28:33.380
I could see one of those, I don't know, just like a pseudo-futuristic jousting movie.

28:33.380 --> 28:35.040
It's going to be boring is what it is.

28:35.040 --> 28:40.480
I mean, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, fortunately I got dragged to that and that was a horrible

28:40.480 --> 28:41.480
movie.

28:41.480 --> 28:43.720
So, I don't know.

28:43.720 --> 28:45.120
It's such a dumb idea.

28:45.120 --> 28:48.120
Let's see, going to our chat room, chat.orensonshadeo.com.

28:48.120 --> 28:52.040
Tiger Claw says, a movie about people riding on giant ostriches.

28:52.040 --> 28:58.120
Articuya says, ostriches don't fly and Dark Knight says, fail in its future.

28:58.120 --> 29:00.120
There you go.

29:00.120 --> 29:07.000
Escapist says, Kate Hudson and her ostriches bicker for half the movie than Fall in Love.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Now that I'd pay to see.

29:09.000 --> 29:15.760
Anyways, there's an interesting rumor going on regarding Guitar Hero 3.

29:15.760 --> 29:26.080
Apparently another artist is in talks with Activision and Red Octane regarding, of course,

29:26.080 --> 29:31.600
being in Guitar Hero 3 as one of the legends of rock to join up with the other people in

29:31.600 --> 29:32.600
there.

29:32.600 --> 29:37.920
That person is Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine, of course, obviously going to

29:37.920 --> 29:39.080
be dueling against him.

29:39.080 --> 29:46.200
I think right now it's still, they're in talks but hasn't fully committed yet.

29:46.200 --> 29:49.200
But that'd be kind of neat.

29:49.200 --> 29:52.960
They're getting down the line here so if they're going to put him in there, it's going to have

29:52.960 --> 29:53.960
to be pretty soon.

29:53.960 --> 29:57.240
Yeah, isn't that game coming out like next month or something?

29:57.240 --> 29:59.760
Yeah, like around Halloween, seriously.

29:59.760 --> 30:02.040
Are they just maybe holding on to some secrets?

30:02.040 --> 30:07.760
Well, I mean, I can't imagine that there's too much development going into that game.

30:07.760 --> 30:12.760
You don't really have to change that much other than putting songs in there and creating

30:12.760 --> 30:18.640
the player models for these people that they're getting in there.

30:18.640 --> 30:23.560
Coming soon to the Xbox Live Video Marketplace, Family Guy.

30:23.560 --> 30:27.800
That's right, coming on September 2nd.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.320
Is that today or tomorrow?

30:29.320 --> 30:30.320
That's today.

30:30.320 --> 30:31.320
That's today.

30:31.320 --> 30:32.320
Well, holy crap.

30:32.320 --> 30:33.320
It's coming out today on Xbox Live Marketplace.

30:33.320 --> 30:34.640
That's freaking sweet.

30:34.640 --> 30:40.640
Stewie Griffin, The Untold Story, and I believe episodes from, I don't know if it's, is it

30:40.640 --> 30:42.880
every episode that's coming up on Xbox Live?

30:42.880 --> 30:43.880
I think it is.

30:43.880 --> 30:45.120
Let me just save you some time.

30:45.120 --> 30:48.720
Do not download Stewie Griffin, The Untold Story, whatever that is.

30:48.720 --> 30:49.720
Wasn't that bad?

30:49.720 --> 30:50.720
It is horrible.

30:50.720 --> 30:54.900
It's just three episodes strung together and it feels like three episodes.

30:54.900 --> 30:58.920
It was not good, but Family Guy is good.

30:58.920 --> 31:04.080
I like that they decided to put this on the Marketplace at the height of its popularity.

31:04.080 --> 31:08.320
Being sarcastic because nobody should care about the show anymore.

31:08.320 --> 31:12.760
Well, isn't it ironic, though, that the show is so damn popular and then it came out, it

31:12.760 --> 31:13.760
got canceled or whatever.

31:13.760 --> 31:18.200
It was more like a cult thing, then it got canceled, then it was popular again on DVD,

31:18.200 --> 31:21.620
like insanely popular, like it was like, you know, have you seen this, and then Fox brings

31:21.620 --> 31:25.800
it back and it's funny for a couple weeks and then it just kind of goes downhill.

31:25.800 --> 31:26.800
It's so funny.

31:26.800 --> 31:27.800
I love it.

31:27.800 --> 31:28.800
Really?

31:28.800 --> 31:29.800
But here's the thing, though.

31:29.800 --> 31:30.800
I don't watch it on Fox.

31:30.800 --> 31:32.680
I watch three runs on Cartoon Network and TBS.

31:32.680 --> 31:34.960
So you're still watching the old episodes?

31:34.960 --> 31:37.560
I'm watching, well, they're older episodes.

31:37.560 --> 31:40.640
It's basically when I don't get to catch the new episodes when they come out on Fox, they

31:40.640 --> 31:42.760
play them a few weeks later on Cartoon Network.

31:42.760 --> 31:47.380
And I think if you watch Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, your standards for entertainment

31:47.380 --> 31:53.360
are a lot lower than most people's, because god damn, I don't know how some of those shows

31:53.360 --> 31:56.720
survive on their late-night stoners watching that.

31:56.720 --> 31:57.840
Tom Goes to the Mayor or whatever?

31:57.840 --> 32:00.200
No, there's stuff that's a lot weirder than that now.

32:00.200 --> 32:01.200
Really?

32:01.200 --> 32:02.760
They're just scraping at the bottom of the barrel.

32:02.760 --> 32:04.960
Now, it's a lot worse.

32:04.960 --> 32:09.960
They actually have some perfect hair, or like, woman with perfect hair, and it's like some

32:09.960 --> 32:15.560
weird perverted guy, and some anime chick, or something, I don't know.

32:15.560 --> 32:22.340
So speaking of weird Japanese stuff, there's that Dreamcast shoot-em-up game that was coming

32:22.340 --> 32:24.280
out, I guess, next year.

32:24.280 --> 32:28.400
It's also coming out on Xbox Live Arcade in Japan.

32:28.400 --> 32:35.080
So, it's pretty interesting, I guess it's one of the games called Trigger Heart Alexia

32:35.080 --> 32:42.520
is coming to Xbox Live Arcade, and I guess it's the team behind a Sega Saturn shooter

32:42.520 --> 32:50.160
game called Shin-ru, I guess, I probably butchered that.

32:50.160 --> 32:56.680
That's pretty awesome, and I will definitely be using my Japanese account to buy that game.

32:56.680 --> 33:00.160
If you buy a game on the Japanese Xbox Live accounts, can you play it on the American

33:00.160 --> 33:01.160
accounts?

33:01.160 --> 33:02.520
Does it work that way?

33:02.520 --> 33:03.860
Um, maybe.

33:03.860 --> 33:09.920
What you can do is you can download the demo on the Japanese account, and then you register

33:09.920 --> 33:17.380
it on the US account, because if you download a game and you purchase it on another account,

33:17.380 --> 33:23.080
it's a demo on the other accounts, so what you can do is I download it on the Japanese

33:23.080 --> 33:26.680
download the demo and then register it on the US one. That should work.

33:26.680 --> 33:32.960
Interesting, I think. Alright. Also coming to Xbox Live Arcade very soon, it's in this

33:32.960 --> 33:37.440
next week, Fatal Fury Special finally makes its way to Xbox Live Arcade, which

33:37.440 --> 33:40.360
I'm actually pretty excited about because Fatal Fury Special is a game I

33:40.360 --> 33:43.360
actually really enjoyed back in the day, so I'm excited to see this game finally

33:43.360 --> 33:49.240
make its way to Xbox Live. Cyberball 2072. This was not a game I'm so fond of, but I

33:49.240 --> 33:51.640
bet there's a lot of people out there that are into this game.

33:51.640 --> 33:55.480
It's like that futuristic football game that Atari put out many

33:55.480 --> 33:59.240
years ago. I think it runs on the same hardware as games like 720, and those

33:59.240 --> 34:03.560
games did. So that game is coming out to Xbox Live Marketplace. What should be also

34:03.560 --> 34:06.920
noted, though, is that there's a Labor Day sale going on on Xbox Live

34:06.920 --> 34:11.400
Marketplace right now, and you can get certain games for half price. Small Arms

34:11.400 --> 34:16.880
and Zuma are 400 Microsoft points apiece this weekend, and Gauntlet and Dig Dug

34:16.880 --> 34:22.400
are 200 points a pop through Monday at 5 o'clock. So if you're listening to us

34:22.400 --> 34:26.680
live or on the podcast, you might want to hurry up and grab those if you want them.

34:26.680 --> 34:32.920
I don't know. I mean, even at 200 points, that's, what, 250? Eh, I don't know. Gauntlet and Dig Dug

34:32.920 --> 34:36.160
are both decent games. I don't know. I think Gauntlet is fun, like it's a

34:36.160 --> 34:38.980
nostalgia thing for, like, the first two times you play it, and then you're like,

34:38.980 --> 34:42.840
I'm done with this now. Dig Dug is a classic, though. I don't know. I guess it

34:42.840 --> 34:48.000
depends how strongly you feel about retro titles. Yeah. Anyways, there are some

34:48.000 --> 34:51.800
pictures that leaked out, or I wouldn't really say leaked out, went out on the

34:51.800 --> 34:57.060
internet showing that, yes, the elites can also crap out as well and get the

34:57.060 --> 35:02.240
wonderful three rings of death. Although, I'm not too surprised, though, seeing that

35:02.240 --> 35:06.960
they're showing, I guess, a kiosk. Now, I'm not sure what kind of ventilation those

35:06.960 --> 35:10.700
kiosks have, but just looking at it, I mean, doesn't look like there's much

35:10.700 --> 35:14.640
airflow in that at all, and depending on what they're running, no wonder that

35:14.640 --> 35:24.360
thing overheated. So, I don't know. Xbox 360s die. They'll get replaced. Live. I guess as

35:24.360 --> 35:27.320
long as they give the three-year warranty with those, right? Oh, yeah, they

35:27.320 --> 35:31.700
still do the warranties on all of them, so, I mean, apparently they're stepping up

35:31.700 --> 35:35.900
things to make sure that their turnaround time's a lot less, but... And aren't

35:35.900 --> 35:39.360
they, like, giving away free Xbox Live or something with that, too? They are. They're

35:39.360 --> 35:44.760
giving away, when you actually return the system, you'll get a free card for one

35:44.760 --> 35:50.440
month of Xbox Live, valued at probably, like, five bucks. Now, is that something

35:50.440 --> 35:56.080
that you can extend your current Xbox Live account with? I'm not sure if you

35:56.080 --> 36:00.200
can extend your current one. I'd imagine you would, because it's just those

36:00.200 --> 36:11.600
redeemable cards, the gold subscriptions. So, I'm not sure, but... Alright, well, one

36:11.600 --> 36:15.080
thing I'm looking forward to playing on the 360 at some point is Tekken 6.

36:15.080 --> 36:18.920
Hopefully it's coming to the 360, and they said, yep, I seem to remember they announced

36:18.920 --> 36:23.720
it's coming to both systems. I don't know if it's coming to the 360 yet,

36:23.720 --> 36:27.760
because I think that the arcade game's actually running off of PlayStation 3

36:27.760 --> 36:32.680
hardware, so... Don't! No, we'll see. Well, anyway, Tekken 6 is still on its way. I guess...

36:32.680 --> 36:38.000
I probably have a PS3 by then, anyway. Yeah, Dartusuius says, are you sure you're

36:38.000 --> 36:41.240
not thinking of Virtua Fighter 5? Maybe I am. Yeah, Virtua Fighter 5's coming out in

36:41.240 --> 36:45.880
October. Well, Tekken 6 is on its way, and there's a brand new fighter that's been

36:45.880 --> 36:51.800
announced for Tekken 6, and that's Bob. Yes, he has the very unique name of Bob,

36:51.800 --> 36:56.640
but the cool thing about Bob, he's a chubby. He's a chubster, and you don't see

36:56.640 --> 37:01.120
a lot of fat guys in video games, especially in fighting games. Doesn't he

37:01.120 --> 37:05.440
sort of resemble Mario with bleached hair? Kinda. Here's a picture of him right

37:05.440 --> 37:07.880
here. He does kind of look like Mario with bleached hair. He's got the blue

37:07.880 --> 37:12.280
jeans and a red shirt and suspenders, and then bleached hair. But, you know, the only

37:12.280 --> 37:15.920
fat guys I can think of in video game history would be like, you know, Raiden

37:15.920 --> 37:19.880
from... I think he was in one of the Neo Geo fighting games. I think he was in the

37:19.880 --> 37:25.440
first Fatal Fury, I think. And there was... What other big fat guys were there?

37:25.440 --> 37:30.240
T-Honda. T-Honda, but he wasn't fat. He was... He was a sumo wrestler. Yeah. There you go.

37:30.240 --> 37:35.160
Karnov is what Jirnami says in chats. There you go. Yes, I guess he's a

37:35.160 --> 37:41.400
stereotypical American, according to Nintendo Maniac 64. According to Japanese

37:41.400 --> 37:46.760
Arcadia Magazine, who actually kind of broke the news on this, Bob used to be

37:46.760 --> 37:50.460
into conventional beauty, but he got frustrated by how his size limited him,

37:50.460 --> 37:59.340
so he got super fat. You go, boy. Awesome. Now what else is pretty neat? That Tekken

37:59.340 --> 38:06.160
5 online is now online. And yes, it's kind of funny, but you can now download,

38:06.160 --> 38:14.100
and not for free, but for $10, you can download and get survival mode, and then

38:14.100 --> 38:21.360
I guess a practice mode, and of course the online mode. So, yay! They broke it and

38:21.360 --> 38:27.560
then make you pay $10 to fix it. Hooray. Do you have Tekken on the PlayStation

38:27.560 --> 38:31.600
Network? Fuck no. Because you know I don't even have a PlayStation 2. I'm not spending like 15 bucks for a

38:31.600 --> 38:37.080
crippled game. I'm not really a Tekken fan. I mean, I don't play fighting games

38:37.080 --> 38:45.200
that much, so much less do I play PlayStation 3 games much. All right, well,

38:45.200 --> 38:49.440
one thing we like to do is we like to open up ye old mailbag once in a while

38:49.440 --> 38:53.000
and read some of our favorite emails. Sadly, Dark Soccer is not here tonight, so

38:53.000 --> 38:58.800
she's not here to read the emails for us, but I'm here, damn it. I'll read the emails.

39:02.800 --> 39:07.040
Again, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangelaundry.com is the place to do

39:07.040 --> 39:15.480
it. Our first email tonight comes from AZHP, and AZHP says, hey OLR, random

39:15.480 --> 39:19.200
thought from last week's show that I forgot to say on the skype line. Saw the

39:19.200 --> 39:23.560
live feed for about five seconds before live 365 got cut off and you killed the

39:23.560 --> 39:29.680
operator. 11 feed. Rob is hot, call me later. Well, thank you.

39:29.680 --> 39:34.080
That's awkward. Yeah, a little bit. P.S., just kidding. Keep up the great

39:34.080 --> 39:43.560
podcasting. Less awkward. Funny. Let's go to another email. This email comes to us

39:43.560 --> 39:50.160
from Ali. It could be Ali, actually. I think it's Ali. In episode 244, part A, you

39:50.160 --> 39:53.760
got an email from someone who said your show is calming, and Rob exclaimed, I

39:53.760 --> 39:56.360
don't understand. How is this show calming? This show makes me want to do

39:56.360 --> 40:00.680
vehicular manslaughter to my cousins. I second that calming effect. I've been

40:00.680 --> 40:03.960
doing the endurance races in Forza while listening to podcasts, and I must say,

40:03.960 --> 40:08.400
it is when I listen to yours that I don't want to kill my Xbox. It cheats. Now

40:08.400 --> 40:12.800
I need to say F you to my local EB Games. It is situated in a local burg separated

40:12.800 --> 40:17.480
from the city, which is illegal to trade video games if you are under 18, and you

40:17.480 --> 40:21.680
must have photo ID to trade video games. In other words, when I went to take my

40:21.680 --> 40:25.680
stack of old Xbox games that have no replay value in to get Forza, I had to go

40:25.680 --> 40:30.620
back home, drag my mom to EB, and make her show them her driver's license so I

40:30.620 --> 40:36.640
could buy the E-rated Forza Motorsport 2, WTF. I would have called in to deliver

40:36.640 --> 40:40.040
that rant, but I'm never home when you guys tape. Also, am I the only one who

40:40.040 --> 40:44.180
finds the mouse acceleration and Bioshock unbelievably frustrating? I love

40:44.180 --> 40:48.620
how in Battlefield 1942, Half-Life 2, and Counter-Strike, the mouse response is

40:48.620 --> 40:53.000
snappy and rigid, but Bioshock has some weird acceleration built into it, or is

40:53.000 --> 40:56.960
it because I'm playing in Vista? Oh, by the way, I'm playing Bioshock on my

40:56.960 --> 41:02.560
dual-booting MacBook Pro. Suck it, Loki. Love the show, except the Mac hating, Ali.

41:02.560 --> 41:09.320
There you go. Another fan mail for Loki. Well, maybe it's because he's doing that

41:09.320 --> 41:12.440
whole dual-booting thing that his mouse is so screwed up. No, I have no idea. I

41:12.440 --> 41:16.880
have not been able to play. Bioshock won't even run on my archaic PC, so I

41:16.880 --> 41:19.920
couldn't tell you, but I'm curious, chat room, maybe is there somebody in chat

41:19.920 --> 41:22.240
that's playing Bioshock on the PC that would care to enlighten us? Does the mouse

41:22.240 --> 41:25.680
feel weird to you guys? What do you guys think about his other story where he

41:25.680 --> 41:29.080
says that you cannot trade video games if you're under 18? You have to have

41:29.080 --> 41:32.240
photo ID to trade games. You probably have a lot of theft of video games and

41:32.240 --> 41:35.000
stuff, and people are just tired of dealing with it. So they're blaming the

41:35.000 --> 41:40.640
damn kids. Yep, it's those damn kids. They make laws for reasons, so, you know,

41:40.640 --> 41:45.400
obviously they've had reason to make such a law because, you know, they were

41:45.400 --> 41:50.200
getting too much theft or people turn in stuff. I could understand needing a photo

41:50.200 --> 41:55.160
ID. I don't understand the 18 thing, but... I think all of them require photo ID. Yeah,

41:55.160 --> 42:01.080
they do now, so, I mean, 16 and up, I can see that. All right, well, let's go to the next

42:01.080 --> 42:06.160
email. Goldbanjo14 in our chat room says, that law is bullshit. Let's go to the

42:06.160 --> 42:09.200
next email in our mailbag. mailbagandorangelsrader.com. This one's not

42:09.200 --> 42:16.920
signed, so I will attribute it to Nick C, and it's titled, I agree with Loki. Hi, my

42:16.920 --> 42:20.880
name Nick, and I have been listening since I got a PSP when it first came and

42:20.880 --> 42:25.560
found the OLR PSP website. I'm reading this as is, you guys. Wow, this is a

42:25.560 --> 42:30.440
terrible email. I listen live once and a while and download the podcast all the

42:30.440 --> 42:33.440
time. I'm thinking he typed it on his PSP, so I'm giving him a break.

42:33.440 --> 42:38.160
So, listening to your podcast helped me out when buying a DDR game for my sister.

42:38.160 --> 42:44.480
I agree with Loki on Apple. I hat every product made by Apple. People always get

42:44.480 --> 42:48.720
made when I bash on Apple all the time, saying that Apple is good with their

42:48.720 --> 42:53.640
crappy iPods and Macs that are overpriced. So, what do you think he meant

42:53.640 --> 42:59.120
by hat? Was it hate or half? It's hate. I think it's half. It says, I hate

42:59.120 --> 43:02.600
every product made by Apple. People always get mad, but I read it as is.

43:02.600 --> 43:06.280
People always get mad when I bash on Apple all the time, saying that Apple is

43:06.280 --> 43:09.520
good with their crappy iPods and Macs that are overpriced, and I hope they

43:09.520 --> 43:13.560
unlock the iPhone so I can make fun of more people that bought an iPod that

43:13.560 --> 43:20.120
makes calls. So, there you go, Loki. At least you have the bad grammar kids

43:20.120 --> 43:21.120
agree with you.

43:21.120 --> 43:26.800
Okay, you know, still though, you've got to admit, I mean, $600 for a phone?

43:26.800 --> 43:27.800
Come on.

43:27.800 --> 43:33.160
I mean, if it were a Microsoft phone, I would still be giving people crap for

43:33.160 --> 43:36.360
it. I'm like, why the fuck are you spending $600 on a phone? That's what I

43:36.360 --> 43:37.360
want to know.

43:37.360 --> 43:42.360
Here's my thing. I'll tell you straight up right now. You know I love Macs and

43:42.360 --> 43:47.160
all that stuff, so I'm not going to hate on it or whatever, but here's the

43:47.160 --> 43:50.280
thing is that I did notice when I was at the airport this week, because I did

43:50.280 --> 43:54.760
spend a lot of my week in L.A. this week, is that there are tons of assholes

43:54.760 --> 43:58.040
out there with iPhones that don't even know how to use them. It's becoming

43:58.040 --> 44:03.040
this trendy thing amongst men and businesswomen to use, and there's a lot

44:03.040 --> 44:05.840
of assholes out there with iPhones, so go figure.

44:05.840 --> 44:06.840
All right.

44:06.840 --> 44:11.280
Because it's expensive and excessive, just like SUVs.

44:11.280 --> 44:15.280
Hey, if you're an Apple fan boy, fan girl, and you bought one because you

44:15.280 --> 44:19.960
want to support the great Apple in the sky, then go for it. It's all good.

44:19.960 --> 44:22.880
No hate. No hate from here.

44:22.880 --> 44:29.440
We'll do one more here. This is from Nate. Hi, Nate. Good day to you. I've

44:29.440 --> 44:32.080
been listening to your podcast for a couple months now, starting with your

44:32.080 --> 44:35.680
fifth anniversary show, and I find it very entertaining. I just want to let

44:35.680 --> 44:39.600
you know that despite Sky's frequent admonishments of the show going off

44:39.600 --> 44:43.280
subject, I find this very quality to be one of the most appealing aspects

44:43.280 --> 44:47.400
of your podcast. I am but a poor commoner and don't have any of the next

44:47.400 --> 44:51.640
gen systems, so I have to make do with the pre-DS and Wii Nintendo systems.

44:51.640 --> 44:56.720
As such, a lot of the hot news regarding Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, etc., I

44:56.720 --> 44:59.680
just don't have much interest in, although it is nice to keep up with

44:59.680 --> 45:02.720
what's happening in the industry just for the sake of staying well informed.

45:02.720 --> 45:05.560
Long story short, what keeps me coming back each week is the chemistry

45:05.560 --> 45:09.260
between you guys, your weird but hilarious sense of humor, and yes, even

45:09.260 --> 45:14.240
the bizarre rants and ostensibly off-subject forays into movies, comics,

45:14.240 --> 45:17.960
social commentary, cat websites, etc. Oh, and of course, all that forbidden

45:17.960 --> 45:22.200
sexual tension between Sky and Dark Sakura. Wow, that person obviously

45:22.200 --> 45:27.080
doesn't listen to this show whatsoever. What? What? You may have missed a

45:27.080 --> 45:31.720
small detail about me that would mean I would not think of Dark Sakura

45:31.720 --> 45:34.640
like that, although I wish she was here to react to that. That would be

45:34.640 --> 45:36.680
kind of funny. I'm going to leave that in the mail bag and see if she

45:36.680 --> 45:40.000
reads it next week. And then he closes with, keep up the good work.

45:40.000 --> 45:46.160
Thank you very much, even if that sexual tension is extremely misplaced.

45:46.160 --> 45:51.240
Maybe I could do one more. One more? All right. One more from Nintendo

45:51.240 --> 45:56.040
Maniac 64. Oh, boy. I've already said this twice in chat, but honestly,

45:56.040 --> 46:00.080
this is important in my opinion. In the final area in Super Metroid,

46:00.080 --> 46:04.640
below the four boss statues, make sure you only save in the first save

46:04.640 --> 46:08.040
room. If you save in the second one, you've already gone past a certain

46:08.040 --> 46:12.000
point where there's a room where its door is gray and deactivated,

46:12.000 --> 46:14.800
resulting in you being trapped, except for being able to complete the

46:14.800 --> 46:18.120
game. This would prevent you from going back and collecting any power

46:18.120 --> 46:22.640
ups you may have missed. Note, I learned this the hard way. I even had

46:22.640 --> 46:27.240
all the reserve tanks and energy tanks. So, boy, you got screwed,

46:27.240 --> 46:33.480
didn't you? Sorry, buddy. Sorry to hear it. All right, that's it for

46:33.480 --> 46:35.880
e-mail. Again, if you want to send us an e-mail, mailbag at

46:35.880 --> 46:42.200
orangelaundry.com is the place to do it. Yes. Anyways, we touched on

46:42.200 --> 46:46.680
this a little bit, I think, last week and a few weeks before. Neo Geo

46:46.680 --> 46:50.800
titles are confirmed to be coming to the Virtual Console and as soon as

46:50.800 --> 46:55.440
this month. In fact, September 11th, you'll be getting a few games,

46:55.440 --> 47:01.880
including Fatal Fury, Magical Lord, and God, I can't remember the last

47:01.880 --> 47:07.320
one. World Heroes. Those are each going to cost a whopping 900 Wii

47:07.320 --> 47:11.920
points. No word on whether they're coming to the US. I imagine at some

47:11.920 --> 47:16.720
point they will. Magical Lord is fucking awesome. I'm glad to see

47:16.720 --> 47:21.040
that's, you know, in the initial allotment there, because I remember

47:21.040 --> 47:24.680
playing that a lot. For some reason, you know, these grocery chains

47:24.680 --> 47:30.080
around here had Neo Geo machines a while back, so while my parents were

47:30.080 --> 47:33.640
checking out, I would be playing Magical Lord. I would think it's

47:33.640 --> 47:38.440
inevitable that the game's going to come at some point. Yeah. State

47:38.440 --> 47:42.840
side, I mean. But we'll see. We shall see. Alright, let's get on with

47:42.840 --> 47:46.960
some release dates and things that you can check out long before these

47:46.960 --> 47:49.960
Neo Geo games come state side. Although, we are going to start with the

47:49.960 --> 47:53.440
Japanese release dates, so I guess we're doing things a little backwards.

47:53.440 --> 47:57.080
Coming out on the Xbox 360, Fatal Inertia is coming out on September

47:57.080 --> 48:02.080
6th, and that's, again, in Japan, if you want to check that game out.

48:02.080 --> 48:05.920
Going over to some other systems, on the Nintendo Wii, there's this

48:05.920 --> 48:12.160
game called Shin Chuka Taisen, Maikel to Meme no Boken, which is

48:12.160 --> 48:15.800
coming out from Starfish, and this looks to be a game. I'm trying to

48:15.800 --> 48:18.760
look at some of the screenshots. Looks like a little bit of a side

48:18.760 --> 48:23.400
scroller, action-y type game, like a throwback to an old, you know,

48:23.400 --> 48:28.120
like Mario type game. That's kind of cool. I wonder if they'll bring that state side.

48:28.120 --> 48:31.440
Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii, nothing this week, but we can go

48:31.440 --> 48:35.560
over to the PlayStation 3, and I can tell you that there is another

48:35.560 --> 48:41.200
Pachinko game coming out. There's always something coming out.

48:41.200 --> 48:44.200
And then, let's see, going to the PlayStation 2. Now, there's a lot of

48:44.200 --> 48:48.500
stuff on the PlayStation 2, including Grand Theft Auto Liberty City

48:48.500 --> 48:51.840
Stories finally making its way to the Japanese PlayStation 2 this week.

48:51.840 --> 48:56.480
Also, Dear My Son, but that's S-U-N, Sun, is coming out this week, as

48:56.480 --> 49:02.400
well as EA Sports Rugby 08, and Willow Wisp is coming out as well on

49:02.400 --> 49:08.220
the PlayStation 2. Going over to the Nintendo DS, Theta is coming

49:08.220 --> 49:15.380
out this week, and also a game from Bandai called, well, let's just

49:15.380 --> 49:17.920
call it Mahjong, because that's what it is. It's a Mahjong game.

49:17.920 --> 49:26.440
Let's just leave it at that. Really quickly, seeing if there's anything

49:26.440 --> 49:29.680
on the PSP worth mentioning, Sony's putting out a game called

49:29.680 --> 49:34.200
Rezel Cross. That might be kind of interesting. It's an RPG, and it's

49:34.200 --> 49:39.080
from Sony themselves. The script is written by the folks who did

49:39.080 --> 49:42.280
Ark the Lad 3 and 4, so if you like Ark the Lad, you might like this

49:42.280 --> 49:44.480
game. There you have it, Japan releases.

49:44.480 --> 49:50.600
In the US, on PlayStation 2, I hope you like Naruto, because Naruto

49:50.600 --> 49:54.880
Uzumaki Chronicles 2 is the only PS2 game coming out this week.

49:54.880 --> 49:58.020
On other systems, though, let's see, 360, we've got Medal of Honor

49:58.020 --> 50:03.240
Airborne that's also coming out on PC. Stranglehold is also coming out

50:03.240 --> 50:07.360
on Xbox 360, both the standard and collector's edition.

50:07.360 --> 50:12.320
On PSP and DS, Worms Open Warfare 2, because the Worms games are

50:12.320 --> 50:16.320
awesome. And, let's see here, on PlayStation 3, you

50:16.320 --> 50:22.600
get a big fat nothing. And then, of course, on the Wii, Pool Party,

50:22.600 --> 50:26.800
and no, that's not with water, that is billiards.

50:26.800 --> 50:31.240
And, let's see, also on the DS, Garfield Nightmares, which I'm sure

50:31.240 --> 50:38.320
is awesome, and PC games, two games that I have to love, I guess.

50:38.320 --> 50:43.200
I Love Kittens and I Love Puppies. Hooray, I Love Kittens, that sounds

50:43.200 --> 50:48.040
like fun. Let's see, other fun games, is there a Tycoon

50:48.040 --> 50:52.480
game this week, because I'm going to be very disappointed if there is

50:52.480 --> 51:00.600
not. And, no, no Tycoon game.

51:00.600 --> 51:04.760
Nice, sorry to hear it. Well, going over to European release dates,

51:04.760 --> 51:07.320
since Dark Sakura is not here, I still got a lot of love for you,

51:07.320 --> 51:10.120
Europe. I'm going to go and look at your release dates real quick.

51:10.120 --> 51:13.440
On the 7th, all these games on the 7th, Blazing Angels coming out on

51:13.440 --> 51:16.140
Xbox 360 and the PC. This would be the secret missions from

51:16.140 --> 51:20.060
Ubisoft. Crazy Taxi Fair Wars on the PSP.

51:20.060 --> 51:23.640
Two Worlds makes its way to the PC and the Xbox 360.

51:23.640 --> 51:28.600
And Valkyrie Profile 2 Slumera is coming out on the PlayStation 2.

51:28.600 --> 51:31.520
God, that game came out over here like a year ago, didn't it?

51:31.520 --> 51:33.760
Just about. God, it's about time you guys got it.

51:33.760 --> 51:37.100
Sorry to hear it, folks. Alright, well, that's it for release dates.

51:37.100 --> 51:39.760
Not that I think it's a real big disappointment that they haven't gotten

51:39.760 --> 51:41.720
it yet. Well, there's some Valkyrie Profile fans

51:41.720 --> 51:47.800
out there, I'm sure are sad. Anyways, there's an interesting game coming

51:47.800 --> 51:54.200
out in Japan, of course, because, God forbid, you know, that something

51:54.200 --> 52:00.120
like this come out over here. It's created by the team, Sega's Feel the

52:00.120 --> 52:04.880
Magic team, and it uses voice recognition technology to decipher how

52:04.880 --> 52:13.280
people really feel. It's called Koroko Scan, and apparently they

52:13.280 --> 52:19.680
have a hilarious clip on YouTube that's talking, they're interviewing, I guess,

52:19.680 --> 52:25.240
a girl and her boyfriend, and they were asking, I guess, how he feels

52:25.240 --> 52:31.280
about living together and marriage and stuff like that, and I guess it came

52:31.280 --> 52:38.000
up that he was cheating on her or something. Well, yes.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.920
I want to play with that game. That'd be fun.

52:39.920 --> 52:45.080
Any chances might come out over here? Nope, but, hey, thank goodness that those

52:45.080 --> 52:51.360
games are region-free, so, awesome. Oh, that's right, you said you'd have to

52:51.360 --> 52:54.120
be able to read Japanese to actually play them, so what the hell?

52:54.120 --> 52:57.880
It doesn't matter. Alright, well, this might be a little more

52:57.880 --> 53:02.720
mainstream, and this is coming out on the Nintendo DS, I don't know when,

53:02.720 --> 53:05.400
I'm assuming, sometime within the next year or so.

53:05.400 --> 53:10.060
The Legend of Kage, Part 2. Some folks, if you don't know how to pronounce

53:10.060 --> 53:13.520
things right, might call this Legend of Kage, because this came out years

53:13.520 --> 53:19.200
ago on NES, but The Legend of Kage is coming out on the DS, a new sequel

53:19.200 --> 53:24.360
to it, and this was something that was spotted in Famitsu Magazine with

53:24.360 --> 53:28.340
some screenshots and everything, so, pretty cool.

53:28.340 --> 53:31.080
If you like The Legend of Kage. I know that's a NES game that a lot of

53:31.080 --> 53:34.160
people liked, so. I think it's on Virtual Console now, right?

53:34.160 --> 53:36.880
I think so. Possibly.

53:36.880 --> 53:40.640
I thought I saw that it was coming back to Virtual Console, so there you go.

53:40.640 --> 53:45.440
Well, if you are looking for a game that's not so mainstream and definitely

53:45.440 --> 53:50.920
a lot cheaper, you may be interested in Rose Camellia DS.

53:50.920 --> 53:56.120
Now if you're not familiar of Rose and Camellia, it's a women's slapping

53:56.120 --> 54:01.600
game that's a Flash game right now, but it is being ported over to the DS

54:01.600 --> 54:06.080
via the homebrew community, and actually it's funny, the guy that's doing

54:06.080 --> 54:11.840
it happens to be French and needs help finishing the game, but still

54:11.840 --> 54:16.520
though, if you want to check it out, you can definitely check out the

54:16.520 --> 54:24.560
free Flash game site, and it is BeyondDS.free.fr.

54:24.560 --> 54:28.000
For the record, that game is fucking rad. The slapping game, I love that game.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.200
Slapping game, yeah. I love the slapping game. Have you ever played

54:31.200 --> 54:34.360
the slapping game, the Flash game, Shane? I know you've been checked out

54:34.360 --> 54:38.200
at the show. I think I tried to play it at work once and

54:38.200 --> 54:40.520
it wouldn't work right. I'm sorry to hear it. It's a fun game.

54:40.520 --> 54:45.680
It sounds funny, because you slap women. But you're a woman slapping

54:45.680 --> 54:48.200
the women, so it's okay. It doesn't matter. As long as the woman is

54:48.200 --> 54:51.160
getting slapped, all is right. Wow, you can send those cards and letters

54:51.160 --> 54:57.840
too. What's your email? Miklatov? Anyhow. Also announced for a Nintendo

54:57.840 --> 55:04.040
platform, not quite as huh, but it's pretty cool nonetheless.

55:04.040 --> 55:09.040
Coming to the Wii, Worms, a space odyssey. It's another game in the

55:09.040 --> 55:12.260
Worms series, and of course it will be taking advantage of the Wii's motion

55:12.260 --> 55:16.720
control system, but what's really cool about this, online worldwide play,

55:16.720 --> 55:19.520
which is not something you've been seeing a whole lot of Nintendo releases

55:19.520 --> 55:23.640
lately, so that is certainly very promising. This was announced by an

55:23.640 --> 55:27.160
official press release from THQ Inc. this week. Buying it.

55:27.160 --> 55:31.040
You're that big a fan of Worms. I love me some Worms.

55:31.040 --> 55:35.760
Just an FYI, there is still the Worms Open Warfare 2 being made for the DS

55:35.760 --> 55:38.840
and PSP. Wow, they must still really have a fan base for these games,

55:38.840 --> 55:40.960
because they crank them out left and right. Oh yeah.

55:40.960 --> 55:49.760
Are you buying all of these games, Logie? No, I bought the very first one

55:49.760 --> 55:53.500
that came out on the PC years ago, and that's the last one I bought.

55:53.500 --> 56:00.680
I think the last game I bought was for the PC, and it was Worms Armageddon.

56:00.680 --> 56:03.240
They do have one of the Worms games on GameTap, so that's one of the ones

56:03.240 --> 56:06.580
I've played too. I've been meaning to buy the one on Xbox Live

56:06.580 --> 56:12.720
Arcade, but I haven't got around to it yet. Alright.

56:12.720 --> 56:18.080
One game I'm definitely going to be around to buying is Manhunt 2, and of

56:18.080 --> 56:22.640
course people are still pissed off that the game got re-rated down to an M.

56:22.640 --> 56:25.760
They want to know why they're demanding answers, and guess what?

56:25.760 --> 56:30.080
The ESRB says, uh-uh, we ain't giving you no fucking answers.

56:30.080 --> 56:34.920
So here's their statement basically. The FTC, the National PTA, the Kaiser

56:34.920 --> 56:40.740
Family Foundation, and the Peter Hart Research team have all found that

56:40.740 --> 56:45.440
parents are overwhelmingly satisfied with the ESRB rating system, rather

56:45.440 --> 56:52.620
than publicly second-guessing what is unmistakably a strong warning to

56:52.620 --> 56:57.600
parents about the suitability of particular games for children, which

56:57.600 --> 57:04.360
presumably neither Senator Yee or the CCFC have personally reviewed.

57:04.360 --> 57:09.600
We feel that a more productive tact would be joining us in encouraging

57:09.600 --> 57:13.380
parents to take their ratings seriously when buying games for their

57:13.380 --> 57:17.000
children. You show them.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.320
So in other words, no, yeah, they re-rate it.

57:19.320 --> 57:21.840
What do they change to re-rate it? Well, fuck off.

57:21.840 --> 57:27.040
You don't get to find out. Actually, they can find out if they buy

57:27.040 --> 57:30.120
certain versions of the game in other countries and check it against

57:30.120 --> 57:34.360
them. Or maybe they didn't change much at all. Maybe they appealed or

57:34.360 --> 57:37.800
something and got it. It's freakin' okay. 17 and 18-year-olds, come

57:37.800 --> 57:41.520
on. We've discussed this before. There's not much maturity difference

57:41.520 --> 57:47.500
between a 17 and 18-year-old, okay? It's just one gets more held

57:47.500 --> 57:53.080
accountable to certain things. But other than that, really, and the whole

57:53.080 --> 57:58.400
ESRB rating system is all fucked up anyway, so big deal. It's mature now.

57:58.400 --> 58:00.880
What the fuck do you want? They just want it banned because they're

58:00.880 --> 58:05.000
fuckin' hypocrites. We want to ban everything. Keep our children

58:05.000 --> 58:09.280
safe. Oh my God. I'm more impressed that they did it this quick.

58:09.280 --> 58:12.080
I mean, we all thought the game was just not going to come out for like

58:12.080 --> 58:15.300
a year now because of this, and it seems like not even a month later,

58:15.300 --> 58:19.240
it's all fixed. So it makes me think whatever they change wasn't that

58:19.240 --> 58:22.040
much. It wasn't that much. It was probably stupid things. Remember

58:22.040 --> 58:26.000
when we talked about Lair last week and how they had to change stuff

58:26.000 --> 58:28.820
to get a teen rating, they couldn't show blood, but they could show

58:28.820 --> 58:32.920
people being burned alive. I mean, like there's a big difference there

58:32.920 --> 58:37.360
or something. So it's just, it's really stupid the requirements that

58:37.360 --> 58:42.000
they have. It's just like the, you know, MPA, it's all fucked up. But

58:42.000 --> 58:44.680
I don't know. I like how these people that haven't played the game at

58:44.680 --> 58:48.600
all can criticize, you know, the rating system or anything like that.

58:48.600 --> 58:52.960
They have no clue on what's going on, yet they're just like, oh, we want

58:52.960 --> 58:55.480
the game banned. It's horrible. They're going to be selling it to

58:55.480 --> 59:01.760
children, you know, despite the fact that it's, you know, over 17. Who

59:01.760 --> 59:05.200
cares? If it's being sold to children and you're a parent, you're going

59:05.200 --> 59:09.360
to just be like, oh my God, he bought it. I can't do nothing. It's too

59:09.360 --> 59:13.560
late. Jimmy's going to go kill people now. What they need to do is just

59:13.560 --> 59:16.920
say, hey, where'd you get that game? I'm taking this back. Or break the

59:16.920 --> 59:19.720
disc in half or something. I don't know. You have control over your

59:19.720 --> 59:23.760
damn kids. Do something. It's like they act like their parents are

59:23.760 --> 59:27.200
powerless. It's like, oh no, he's got it in his hands now. I can't take

59:27.200 --> 59:33.880
it away from him. We're doomed. Lots of comments from chat here. Fire

59:33.880 --> 59:39.520
Bulma says, won't somebody think of the children? Let's see. Escapist

59:39.520 --> 59:42.960
says, maybe they just had to excise some extreme cut scenes to Manhunt

59:42.960 --> 59:47.360
2 down to an M. Son of Dad speculates, Manhunt wasn't changed. It was a

59:47.360 --> 59:53.480
publicity stunt. Interesting. GS 191 says, I'm 19. I don't feel any

59:53.480 --> 59:56.880
more different than when I was 17. Sure, I learned a lot of things, but

59:56.880 --> 59:59.600
these people forget that there's a lot of kids that know the difference

59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.920
between real and fake. Yeah, but isn't it fair to say, unfortunately,

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:05.400
there's some that don't, and there's even some 20-year-olds that don't?

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:09.040
Shouldn't you be more worried about your kids going and having underage

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:14.360
sex and doing drugs and all sorts of things like that, rather than

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:17.640
playing violent video games? I would think that you would be more

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:21.960
encouraging of kids playing games that require them not to leave the

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:26.840
house to do malicious things. I don't know about you, but I think,

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:33.520
given the two choices, I'll take my kids playing violent video games.

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:36.480
Fire Bulma in chat has a funny comment that says, my precious, unique

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:41.400
snowflake would never do drugs. Or play these violent video games, I'm

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:46.160
sure. I mean, seriously, how dumb are people? Really?

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.600
Who doesn't enjoy a little bit of violence once in a while? Do you like

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:53.960
violence, Shane? Yes. You do? Okay, that's good. No, only sometimes.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.240
Only sometimes? What types of violence do you like?

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:00.800
The stuff that doesn't look too real. I can't stand the real stuff.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:04.840
Okay. All right. Just wanted to give you some... Violence against women.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:09.080
I just... Again, those cards and letters. You want to hear a funny story?

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:12.480
Sorry. Sure, why not? This refers to last week when we were talking

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:16.560
about Imagine Babies. I actually talked to the company that's making

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:19.960
Imagine Babies. I think Ubisoft's putting it up. And I mentioned to them

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:23.920
about the baby shaking. They did not know that.

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:28.000
They didn't? I'm like, you can rock the baby with one part.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.200
I'm like, and if you shake it really fast, you're actually shaking babies.

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:34.520
So it was fascinating. I don't want them to change that.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.280
They're not going to change that. Okay, good.

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:39.800
Good job, Loki, ruining Imagine Babies. I know.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:46.600
Good job, ass. Wow, this show has gone to all sorts of places.

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.040
I didn't think it would go tonight. It's because Jamie's not here to keep us

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:55.720
in check and make pouty faces. And flip me off.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:59.640
A lot of controversy going around about E for All, specifically when it comes to Electronic

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.680
Arts. Here's what's interesting is that there was

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:05.880
word going around that Electronic Arts had dropped out of the show this week because

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:09.560
I guess they suddenly didn't show up in some advertising material for the show, which

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:14.840
started to make people go, well, gee, who's left besides Nintendo and Konami and a couple

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:17.920
others? But Electronic Arts was contacted a little

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:23.920
later in the week, and EA has reaffirmed that, yes, they are going to E for All.

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:28.100
So if you want a chance to play Rock Band early, you still have a chance, because obviously

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:31.400
if EA is going, they're bringing that game with them, because they've trucked it everywhere

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:36.560
the past couple months. As long as the show is still on and my badge

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:40.000
forwards to my new address, like it should, I am planning to go to E for All.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.640
I've already registered and all that crap and got the time off work, so...

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.320
I haven't registered yet, but I don't know if the wife would let me.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:50.600
I should just register and just not go. Well, do whatever you want, but I'm going

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:55.120
to try and go, and if All Games is doing anything down there, I'm sure I'll hang with them.

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:58.960
Because otherwise I don't want to have to go by myself. It's going to be sad.

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:03.220
Shane, I might have to drag you with me if you can. Go. I don't know. Depending on what's

01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:07.720
going on. Alright, well anything else in this Part A?

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:10.560
We're kind of running a short show tonight. I don't know what's up with that.

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:13.000
Oh, that's just Part A. That's just Part A. That's right. There's

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.040
plenty more to come. Tonight in Part B, we're going to be playing

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:19.240
a little bit of Beat the Host. So you might want to get your phones nearby

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:23.720
or your Skype line ready, because we'll be taking the first caller to play Beat the Host.

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.860
Not now, but when we come back and we tell you to call in.

01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:28.560
And if you haven't heard Beat the Host, it's a lot of fun.

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:32.020
Stay tuned for tonight's Beat the Host. We'll be right back in a little bit with

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.020
more of Orange Lounge Radio.
