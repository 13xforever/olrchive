Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
There's a host, Dark Sakura

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Sky and World of War

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight September 30th, 2007

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Halo 3 breaks big records

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Blue Dragon gets free download content

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Could Katana someday do battle with Wonder Woman?

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Red Dragon gets free download content

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Red Dragon gets free download content

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Red Dragon gets free download content

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
priorities!

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
I want to know where the Tootsie Rolls are

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
There are no Tootsie Rolls

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
I do have brownies

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
There's no joke there

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
I really do have little yummy brownies

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
They taste like coffee too

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Like the Starbucks ones

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
I'm hoping that if we can get all the computer issues worked out

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
We can go out into El Garage

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
I mean the studio

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
That's not a converted garage door

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Remember change under the couch

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
We can go out there for next week's program

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
And I'm pretty excited about that

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
So it'll be fun

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
And no laundry baskets to be found out there

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
But there is a washer and dryer that will be off during the program

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Anyhow

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Let me also introduce the chatroom

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Aren't you glad you subscribed us?

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
That's going to be just like, MOM! I'm recording my show!

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Get out of here!

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Gosh damn

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Luckily I don't live with my parents

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
That's one good thing about the program

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I don't live with my parents

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
We live with our parents

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Good job everybody

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
You guys all have spouses though

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
I'm the only unmarried one

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
I haven't lived with my parents since I was 15

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Ow

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Mommy wow

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Anyway there's the chatroom

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
chat.orangelaungeradio.com

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
We too says put up pics

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Well we actually simulcast on operator11

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
So if you head on over to operator11.com

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Of which I saw Frisbee put up the link in chat earlier

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Or for those of you guys listening on the archive

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
And search for Orangelaungeradio

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
And you can look at the simulcast of our webcam

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
It's all archived on there

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Because operator11 is cool and they let us eat up tons of disc space

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
With our big talking heads doing the podcast

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Someone asked special brownies

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Once again there is no budget

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
For special brownies

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Like we could afford marijuana even if we wanted to eat it

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Which I'm not really into that

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Why would you want to eat marijuana?

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Well apparently it gets you high

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Yeah but it tastes like ass

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
I can't still

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Stay on the smell of marijuana

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Remember kids don't do drugs

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Don't we do video games once in a while?

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Here on this show

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
DarkSakura please save us from turning into the hashcast

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
And tell us about your gaming week

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
I play a lot of Ragnarok online

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
A lot

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Dude I played this game called Ragnarok

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
You're so cool

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Hey Rob shut up

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
I'm a level 91 assassin now

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Been beating the shit out of ogres

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
And I've also got

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
People are going to yell at me

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Because you're not supposed to do one

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
But I'm working on

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Well I was going to make an agility spear knight

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
And now I'm making an agility

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
One handed sword crusader

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
So

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
But I am going to do a spear knight next

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Because spear knights are cool

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
They have long pulls and poke things with them

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Wow

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Sounds kind of

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Nevermind

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
I've not played any World of Warcraft

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
In fact I'm going to stop paying for it

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
While my computer is down

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
And I actually did not play any pinball this week

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
But

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Excuse me

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Halo 3 in my house

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
We had a bunch of people in our house

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Doing multiplayer Halo campaigns

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
And then the other night

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Dan decided to get all of his buddies

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
We had Will in one of the rooms

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
And then

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Our friend Alex

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Who is a crazy psycho ex-marine

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Was that a LAN party?

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
A local area nerd party?

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Yeah

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
But they beat it on Legendary

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
According to Dan

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
The way to beat Halo 3 on Legendary

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Is to be an uber sniper

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Good times

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
I've compared Legendary

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
To Nightmare on Doom

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
That's like old school Halo 1

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Because that's the only way you could network back in the day

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Was LANing it

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
I'm glad to hear

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Actually I saw Dan online

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
And I saw that he was playing campaign

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
On Legendary and co-op

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
I was like wow

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
I play the game on normal

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I would play on easy

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
But you don't get achievements on easy

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I play on normal

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
I seriously died 10 times in the first level

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
I suck at Halo

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
So bad

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
There should be a charity for me

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
It's sad

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Oh oh oh

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
It was this week

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Oh oh oh

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
It's a flash game

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
What's that?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I think someone

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
IM'd it to me

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
I'm trying to find

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Give me a second I don't get the name of it

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
It's basically like a stick figure

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Stick figure version

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Of Dragon's Lair

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
It's fucking fantastic

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Down to having

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Little music and death scenes

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
And the cut scenes

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
And all that fun

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
It's called Dungeon Escape

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
And it can be found

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
And I'm trying to get the

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Address for people

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
It's at

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Ok studiohunty

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
H-U-N-T-Y dot com

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Slash dungeon

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
And I'm going to link it in the chat room

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
It's hilarious

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
It's not just hilarious it's HILARIOUS

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
HILARIOUS

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Yeah I'm going to link it in the chat room

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Alright well while that's being linked

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
If there's nothing else for your gaming week

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
We'll move on over to Loki, how was your gaming week?

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
My gaming week was fine

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Let's see

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
I started off

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Playing Halo 3 on

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Legendary, single player

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Because no one wants to fucking enjoy my games

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Fuck you all, I'll beat it myself

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
And I'm better than you

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
I'll play with you but I'll probably hold you back

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Whatever, I've been playing it

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
By myself

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Wait I want to know where all this sand in your vagina is coming from

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Are you sending out invites to people on your friends list?

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
No I don't send out invites at all

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Well then if you don't invite people

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Then how do you expect people to join your party?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
I'm supposed to be an internet celebrity or something that says people

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Wake up call

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
You are not famous

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
I have no patience to sit in the lobby for like

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
A long time

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
It's because I have boobies

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
But no it's fine

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Actually it's funny because I'm getting stuck in the same spots

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
I did in the normal game

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Wait what about Bobby?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
I thought Bobby Blackwolf was your only friend

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
On Playstation 3

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Isn't he your friend on Xbox Live?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Yeah but he's not on there

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
He plays the Halo

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
I've seen him on Halo a couple times

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Well you should give him a call or something

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Say hey Bobby

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Oh yeah let me just

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
My phone that has everyone's phone number in it

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Oh there it is, Bobby's number

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Oh wait no I don't have Bobby's number

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
I don't have a whole phone that doesn't exist

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Ok now

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Really I could sit here saying hey

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
You know

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Want to play some Halo 3 but to be honest

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I don't know when I'm going to be online to play Halo 3

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
You know

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I'm doing all sorts of busy stuff like

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Going to see Eastern Promises and crap

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
So I don't know

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
But um

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
So other than playing Halo 3

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I've actually, well of course more scenes

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Row multiplayer and people are certainly pissed off

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Because

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
It's kind of unfair for them

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I've been playing on other people's systems

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
You know while

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
They were gone or something and

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Yeah my system is way

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Better

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Like if I get caught on fire

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
I burn out a lot quicker

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
My rockets seem to have better accuracy

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
I can kill them a lot easier

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
I don't know why

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
But that's just the way it is

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Anyways

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Other than all that stuff

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
On the PSP I've been playing

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Jackass the game

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
And I love it

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
It's so stupid and simple

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
It's so

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
It's such a you game

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
It's really, I mean it is not hard at all

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
To play through the game at all

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
And it's fun

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
It's just stupid little things

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
It's a great rental game

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
And I think it's also probably a good game

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
To have friends over

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
You can play it and laugh

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
On the PSP how do you play

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Well not on the PSP but like

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
It's also on Playstation 2

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I don't have the Playstation 2 version

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Because my sister is still borrowing my Playstation 2

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
You need to call her up and say hey

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Bring it back

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
I did say hey bring it back

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
But she hasn't brought it back yet

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
You send out the troops

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
And then let's see

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Other than that I tried Driver 76

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
For the PSP

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Much like every other Driver game known to man

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
I'm not going to try the Driver series anymore

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
I'm going to stay away from it

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
And I think that's pretty much it

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Oh I played with

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
I've updated my firmware

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
On my PSP Slim

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
To the 3.71 CFW

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Or whatever the new

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
One that's done by Team M33

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Which ends up being Dark Alex anyways

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
The guy that did all the other custom firmwares

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
So now since I have

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
3.71 CFW I can put the official themes

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
On there and so I have

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
A cookie theme on my

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Because it comes with it

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
A cookie theme?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Like

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Like peanut butter cookies

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Or Cookie Monster

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
It's chocolate chip cookies

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
And I will show you

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
It's hilarious

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Sony would like to remind you

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Not to eat your PSP

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
No but it seriously is the cookie theme

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
What about the OLR theme?

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
What happened to that?

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
I haven't made that yet

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
And I will get into that later

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
I was going to say I just had to pay to renew OLRPSP.com

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Our PSP site this week

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Oh it does look like someone ate your PSP

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Oh I see

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
It changes all the icons into cookies as well

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Hold on I'll put that on the OP11 cam in a minute

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Get it?

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Don't eat the PSP Jamie

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
It's not healthy

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
There's actually one thing that

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
I didn't make tonight

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
The Japan Playstation site

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Released the official tool to make themes

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
So yes

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
We can make an OLR theme

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
For the PSP

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
And it's pretty sweet

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
But there's some other ones on there

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
They have like wipeout

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
And some pretty pink one

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
That I'm not going to put on my system

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I'm sure Nellie would want that on hers

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
I don't know

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
So

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
It's neat I guess

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
I don't know if I'd upgrade it

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
To just get that

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
But it's neat

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
ShadowSlayer says

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Lowkey's PSP is delish

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Darktachidea says

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
This is a PSP made of chocolate chips and cookie dough

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Could you imagine if the PSP could just make cookies?

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
It would be awesome

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
It would be totally worth the price

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Even though the PSP

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
I've been growing fonder and fonder

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
This year and last year

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
When the thing first came out

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
I've been more fond of the PSP this year

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
It would be even awesomer if it made cookies

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
I think more people would buy those than DS's

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
If that happened

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
It would be hilarious

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
If they had an

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Easy Bake Oven

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Attachment for the DS

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
You know how they always put all these weird attachments

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
In the Game Boy Advance slot

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Something like that

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Where you actually program stuff in there

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
And you can cook a cookie at a time

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
It's a DS

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
That would be kind of neat

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I don't know

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Going on to my gaming week

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
I haven't played a whole lot

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I did play some more Halo 3

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Which you know I'm not a big fan of first person shooters

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
I do like Halo

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
I love that they

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Just added all this crap into it

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
I don't know what else to call it

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
It's all this crap in the game

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
You can go back and watch your multiplayer matches

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
And take pictures

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I don't know

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
There's not a lot I can say

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Really the only people this is benefiting

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Me talking about Halo 3

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Is people that don't already own an Xbox 360

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Because I think most people that do

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Probably went out and got the game

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Unless you hate first person shooters for some reason

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
In which case I find it hard to believe you got

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Xbox 360 in the first place

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
To be honest I was never a fan of Halo

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
And Halo 3 is pretty cool

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
I think the matchmaking is pretty good

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
I do admit

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
I've played and certainly there's been news about that

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
This week which we'll get into a little later

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
But you know what it's not all about graphics

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
And they are bright though

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
And vibrant

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
The only reason I've always loved Halo before was multiplayer

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
And multiplayer doesn't disappoint

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
I mean in regards it is just

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Halo 2 but you know

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
With more and that's okay

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
But if you're not a fan of Halo

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
At all I don't know if this

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Is going to do it for you

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Especially the single player mode man

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
There's no back story no nothing

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I find it hard to follow because

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
I'm not good at single player therefore I

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Don't really play the campaign modes of the other games

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
So anyway

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
That's that

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Halo 3 and then

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
World of Warcraft I finally went back to after

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
About a three week vacation

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
I decided to go back to World of Warcraft this week

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
And

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Trying to think how that's been going

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
I just hit level 66

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Ran some instances with some friends

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Over in uh near Thrallmar

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
I can't remember what that zone is called

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
But yeah back into World of Warcraft

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Which I missed a little bit

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
And I'm glad I waited because now I have a bunch of friends in the guild

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
That are on the same level I am so we're running instances together

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Good times

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Other than that not a whole lot

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
There was no new arcade release this week

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Did you notice that?

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Am I the one that noticed that?

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Like that they decided you know on Xbox Live arcade

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
That since Halo 3 came out they didn't need an arcade release this week

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
I mean I guess they released like a Bomberman pack

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Or something there was nothing new

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Am I the one that noticed that?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
I was looking forward to something new on Wednesday

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Well there wasn't anything new

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I think just like you said

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
You know you almost didn't notice

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Well I think probably a lot of people

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Almost didn't notice

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Yeah I think a lot of people probably didn't care

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
They've been doing two a week

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
So I mean that's pretty good

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Yeah in our chat room HendersonMan says

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
I noticed I want Puzzle Quest

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Yeah I kind of feel the same way like there's all this cool stuff

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
That I want

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
But Puzzle Quest isn't probably coming out until November

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Because that's when the console versions are coming out

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
But then you know there's Res and there's

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Res ain't coming out this year okay

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
I can tell you that much

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
You're a jerk

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Just other stuff would be cool

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Omega 5 maybe

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
I don't think Res is coming out this year

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
How about Castle Crashers?

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Where the fuck is Castle Crashers?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
There you go wasn't that supposed to be out last year?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Yeah

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
In our chat room sometimes our chatters like to post

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
About their gaming weeks

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
And I think my favorite gaming week goes to AJ Mix

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
In our chat room says

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
My gaming week, Legend of the Mystical Ninja

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
On Wii Virtual Console and Halo 3

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
And I think he wins because

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Legend of the Mystical Ninja is awesome

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
It is a pretty awesome game

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Have you gotten to the place where you can play

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Gradius in one of the arcades

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Like little shops in game

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
It's pretty awesome

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Take a look at that

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Anyhow

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Let's get into some housekeeping for tonight

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Of which again we don't have a whole lot

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
There's not been a whole lot of news going on with our show recently

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
So of course we'll continue to plug the community

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Such as our LiveJournal community at Orange Lounge

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
On LiveJournal our username

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Our MySpace at MySpace.com

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Our Facebook

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
I think it's called the OL Army

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Or the OLR listeners or something

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
On Facebook and

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
If you listened to our show a couple weeks ago

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
I don't really use Facebook that religiously

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
You can go to www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Next week is episode 250

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
And although we're not planning

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
A whole lot of big stuff for it

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Because we already had our 5th anniversary show this year

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
So we already kind of did fun stuff for that

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
We're hoping to actually switch our location a little bit

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Which for those of you that listen to us live and watch on the webcam

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Might get a kick out of that

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
And we're hoping to also bring some more interviews

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
And just do some reshuffling of the show

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
If you have ideas go post on our forums

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
What kinds of things you'd like to see on Orange Lounge Radio

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
So we go into our next 50 episodes

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
And 100 more after that

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
And who knows how much longer we can get this show going

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Anyway

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Let's get into some gaming news

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
We'll start off with Loki tonight, some gaming news

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Anyways of course the big news this week

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Was Halo 3 came out

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
And it sold a lot of copies

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
In fact

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Game Daily estimates that

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
They've sold

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
2.48 million units

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
On day 1

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
And of course of that most of them

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Of course being standard editions

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
And then of course it tears down from there

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Limited and legendary

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
But that's a whole lot of games

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
I don't know

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
I mean I'm not surprised

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
We knew it was going to sell like crazy

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
And

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Yeah it's going to continue to sell like crazy

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Weren't they touting on

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Xbox.com or somewhere

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
That it's like biggest entertainment day ever

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Well they're saying that

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
There are sales

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Top that of like

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
I don't know

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Spiderman 3 or something like that

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
The box office gross

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
To which I say Spiderman 3 wasn't that great of a movie

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Well also it costs

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
You know what 9.50 maybe 10.50

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Depending on where you live to go to the movies

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
To see Spiderman 3

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
And if you're cheap like me you'll go to like a matinee for 7 bucks

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
But Halo 3

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
60 bucks plus tax

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
For Halo 3 so of course it made a shit load of money

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Right?

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
I mean I don't know

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Is my math that screwed up

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
I mean we can do the math and figure out exactly how much it made

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
I just don't care

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
It says

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
We all knew Halo 3 was going to make shit loads of money

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
And that's really what the press release should have said

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Confirmed Halo 3 makes shit load of money

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
It made a lot of money

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
And I mean it's just going to

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
It'll help them out it'll sell consoles possibly

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
I mean although some people

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
From other companies have come out and said

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
No it's not people that already wanted

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
You know

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Halo 3 have already bought a 360

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Or some shit like that

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
But it will sell consoles

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Because there are people that were waiting for Halo 3

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Before they bought

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
I don't know

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
It's good for Microsoft

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Misty in our chat room says

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
What? It's Halo 3

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Even Burger King is advertising it

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Money aside I wonder why

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Considering it's an M rated game

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Good point

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
It's like the child movies in Dora the Explorer

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Here's the reason

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Burger King still advertises R rated movies

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
And that kind of stuff

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Do they?

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
I think so

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
I don't know

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Can you get little toys with your meals there?

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Well you can get different things

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Actually no Jurassic Burger is PG-13

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
But here's the thing though

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
And it kind of goes back to the whole

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
ESRB ratings

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
There are no laws in place

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Forbidding people from playing the game

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
If it's

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
If they're under 18

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Or whatever

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
It's really all just

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Store policies

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
And stuff like that

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Unless of course you're in specific states

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Which makes it a felony to sell

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
The game to a minor

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
But

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
It's still

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
It's not a law

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
TigerKlon our chat room says

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
He ends up as an unlockable character in Halo 3

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
That'd be awesome cause then he could shoot it over and over again

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
That would be the best ever

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Cause he's really freakin' disturbing

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Then I want Ronald McDonald in the Grimace

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
I would rather not have him in there

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
To be honest

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
No it would be kind of jumping the shark

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Yeah it would be

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
They've already hoarded themselves out enough for Halo 3

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Maybe in Halo 4

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
It was everywhere

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
We don't need it to be quite that everywhere

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Brad from Pod Culture

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Is in our chat room and says

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
The guy ahead of me in line for Halo 3

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Dropped 800 bucks

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
He bought the legendary edition

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
The Halo version of the 360 console

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
The two Halo controllers and some other crap

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
800 bucks on Halo

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
And he's a consumer of horror

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
And how?

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Well I see

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
The 360

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Halo 3 system I think is not selling as well

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
I think they thought it would

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
I think it's butt ugly

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
It's a paint job for 50 extra bucks

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
I think cause most people already bought

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
The 360 that were anticipating

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Halo before they announced this

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
It's a system that doesn't

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Include Halo 3

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
That's for 50 extra dollars

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
That's a weird color

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
I mean

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
That's kind of stupid

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Least you could do is throw in the game

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
I mean come on

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Did anyone go out to the midnight sales or hear about them?

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
No

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
God damn I meant to get

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
My husband was that one cause he sold

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
And what did he say? Did he say anything about it?

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
He said they were butt ugly

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
The people? No

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
I was gonna say

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Actually our manager

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
In Dallas Texas

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
He dresses up like a Spartan

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
He has an actual Spartan costume

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
It looks cool too

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
He went out to some Dallas launches

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
And stuff

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
And walked around and did fun stuff like that

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
I don't get it

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
I mean

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
It's cool

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
I just don't want to do every single midnight

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
It's like you've seen a midnight launch

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Then you've seen them all

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
It's just someone else cosplaying as something else

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
And a long ass line

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
And people waiting

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
And excited about something

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
It's interesting cause Halo 3 is pretty awesome

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
But it's not gonna be the game of the year for me

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
And I think for a lot of people

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
I don't think it's gonna be the game of the year

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Oh it's gonna be worth the wait

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
It's good

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
It's better than good, it's great

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
But I don't think it's gonna be game of the year

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
I can already think of at least one game

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
That's very similar to Halo that's better

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
It didn't even have multiplayer mode

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Well I mean

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
I don't think a game really needs to be

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
You know

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
To have the best graphics

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
It's all about the best gameplay

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
And has great gameplay

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Halo 2 before Halo 3 came out

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Was still on the top 10

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Most played

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Game on live

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
And now Halo 3 will just take that spot

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
And

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
People will still buy it

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
It's just what

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Makes a good game though

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Is the fact that even throughout time

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
As new games come out

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
People are still interested in that game

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
It's just like

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
When Saints Row

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
2 comes out

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Are people gonna be still playing

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Crackdown or

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
The original Saints Row

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Or Grand Theft Auto 4

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
When that comes out everyone's gonna forget about

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
A lot of other games as well

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
I don't know if it's just me or the people on my friends list

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
But I notice a lot of my friends list

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Don't play

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
They're very much in the now

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
I only ever see people playing the current games

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Or the games that have come out within the past month

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Obviously this week it's been Halo 3

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
I'm sure everybody's friends list is like that

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
But before that it was all Bioshock

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
And you don't see anybody playing

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
You know, Ridge Racer 6 anymore

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Or you know, it's just very interesting

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Not a lot of people playing the old stuff

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
I don't know

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Thought it was interesting

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Anyway, I think this is kinda interesting too

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Is that there's some Halo 3

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Errors, some disc errors

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
That are pissing people off

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
The legendary, I'm sorry not the legendary

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
But the limited edition versions of the games

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Apparently have some

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Disc copies of Halo 3

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
It's causing some disc read errors

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Even on some consoles the red's ringing of death

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Well, that's bullshit

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Yeah, I don't know about that

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
If like one little disc skip can cause that

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
But you know, the things are all under warranty anyway

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
So I mean it shouldn't be too big of a deal

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
But certainly people that wanted to get their Halo

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
On launch night are pretty pissed off

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
That the limited edition copies are scratched

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
Now naturally they have a replacement disc program in the works

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
And all that stuff

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
I'm not sure that somebody's probably getting fired over this

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Well, all it was was the crappy packaging

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
And the cause of the disc

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
To fall off the hub

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Because it was a piece of crap

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
And I don't understand why

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Because in other countries they had a piece of foam

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
And they're holding the disc in place

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
There is a replacement program in place right now

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
For both the essentials disc

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
And the normal game disc

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
And also on top of all that

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
The whole red ring of death thing

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Could it possibly be

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
This is kind of a stretch for me

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Could it be possibly that you're playing it for so many hours straight

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
That the console is overheating because of that

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Because it's poorly ventilated

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
I think that's what the red ring of death would be caused by

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
In fact, I mean

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
It's because of a chip overheating

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
It's not because of

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
A disc read error is not going to cause your chip all of a sudden to explode

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
No, it's

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
It's Bill Gates' fault, obviously

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Right?

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Obviously

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Because he did it himself

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
That's right

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Because he went out there with a

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
With a knife

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
An X-Acto knife

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
To kind of draw a parallel here

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
I would say, for example

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Let's just say

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
This is about as ridiculous as saying

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Okay, if there was a certain car that had problems with their tires popping

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Or something like that

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Now there's a rumor going around

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Saying that if you insert a certain CD into your CD player

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
That your tire is going to explode

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
I mean, that's about how ridiculous it is

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Interesting comments from chat

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Wiedu says

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Not so in New Zealand, Loki

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
My store's limited editions were all scratched

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Pika Uno says

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
All Japanese editions had foam inserts

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
That's a good idea

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Because they package games better there

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Yeah, they do package games a little better there

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
They should also

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
You know what they should do?

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
They should have cases that have rose petals and daisies inside them

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Well, it was stupid

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
They had these little hubs on there

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Kind of locking ones

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
That they'd have in normal DVD cases

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
So yeah, some did fuck up

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
And it's stupid

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Luckily, mine was not scratched

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Alright

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Well, good for you Loki

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Not having a scratched Halo 3 game

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Ours wasn't scratched either

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
I bought the regular one

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
I walked in the day

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
After the midnight sale

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
I walked in the next day

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
I walked right into Fry's

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Looking out Master Chief's ass

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
I mean, there were so many games

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
I was just like, oh, pick one up

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
That was it

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Well, speaking of Master Chief's ass

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
You should check out this charity

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Halo 3 action figure of the Master Chief

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
It's very chickly

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
There is

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
It's an 11.5 inch figure

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Right now going for $241

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
It only has

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
3 bids on it at the time of this article

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
But they are donating

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
10% of the profits to the

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
American Breast Cancer Foundation

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
And it's

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Master Chief is a very hot chick

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Mistress Chief

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Mistress Chief

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
You know, Ms. Chief if you're nasty

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
I don't know

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
I don't know, it looks stupid to me

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
It looks like someone took

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Like a fucking figure

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
For like Witchblade and stuck the Master Chief

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Helmet on it

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
I mean, that's seriously what it looks like

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
I'm not really interested to figure either

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
And as the comments to the story

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Even kind of

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
They're like, okay, seriously though

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
There's no body armor

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
I mean, you could just like

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Shoot her in the boobs and she'd keel over

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Does she have her ass cheeks?

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Does it have the assless

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Suit on it?

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Hmm

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
It looks kind of retarded

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
The hell game have you people been playing?

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Can't you set your character as a female

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Yeah, but she doesn't look like that

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Yeah, and it changes nothing

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Of course, it's body armor

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
It's unisex body armor

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
That's right

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Hey, do we remember text

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
In Red vs. Blue?

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
I don't really watch it

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
I don't watch it

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
I don't get Halo jokes

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Why don't you watch everything that's great?

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
I know, why can't I be like everybody else?

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Seriously

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
God, anyways

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Why can't I be a robot instead of an alien?

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Hero's joke, by the way

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Hope you all saw it

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Someone save this show please

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
This is the first episode

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Of the new season

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Anyways, so

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
This is a complete shocker

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
There's going to be some new bundles

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Coming for the Xbox 360

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
And of course this is kind of

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Very similar to the same thing that

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
I believe was announced for the UK

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Where they were going to be getting a bundle

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Including Forza 2

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
And Marvel Ultimate Alliance

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
This is going to be for both the premium system

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
And for the elite system

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
And both of those systems will be still

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
The same price as they are now

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Just to get two free games

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Hooray

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Then, of course

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
The other new bit of info

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Is that the core system is going to be discontinued

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
And in its place

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Is going to be the Xbox 360

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Arcade SKU

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
It's going to have a 256 megabyte memory card

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
A disk with five Xbox Live arcade games

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Including Boom Boom Rocket, Pac-Man

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
Uno, Feeding Frenzy, and Luxor 2

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
And it's going to have an HDMI out on it as well

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
With a wireless controller

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
All for $279.99

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Which I think is

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Good that they're getting rid of the core

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Because I know a big complaint

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
I always hear is

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Why would you get the core system you can't save your game?

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
So now you can

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Because you buy the core and then you buy a hard drive

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
But at least this way you don't have to

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Right out of the box you can save your game

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
I just think that because

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
When I got my Xbox 360

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
That's what I had to do

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I bought a core and then bought a hard drive

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Because you couldn't get Xbox 360s

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Like anywhere when they first came out

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Remember that? They were like Wii's

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
A couple years ago you couldn't get them anywhere

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
And of course this is just a rumor right now

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
Well yeah but you know what we say about Microsoft rumors

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
They're always true

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Pretty much

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
All the time unless somebody completely pulls it out of their butt

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
But usually you know

32:33.000 --> 32:37.000
Usually there's any sense of legitimacy to it whatsoever

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
I'm going to go on a limb here and say back

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
About a month ago when they showed that whole

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
UK rumor

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
They actually had pictures to go along with it

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
And I've seen pictures to go along with this stuff

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
So I'm going to take a wild guess

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
And say that

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
I think this is actually going to happen

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Alright well

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Back in the 80s we had Pac-Man fever

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
So this week we had Halo fever

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Because Halo is huge

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
And a news story out of Seattle

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
There was a high school student who was on TV

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
He was on the TV going

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Look ma I got Halo 3

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
And I'm standing here with Bill Gates

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
His name was Ritesh David

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
Ritesh David

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
And he was buying the very first copy of Halo 3

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
At a Bellevue Best Buy store

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
And shaking hands with Bill Gates

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
And this all went down of course early Tuesday morning

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Bill Gates autographed David's copy of the new game

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Pretty awesome

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
David's parents actually called the school

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
And said he was ill that day

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
And then here he is on the TV

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Hi here I am

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Somebody got caught

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Also if you wanted to also draw

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Straws a little bit more

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
He was either 18 or 17

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Well no not if he was nice

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Well get this

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Did he get carded for the damn game?

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Well no because M is 17

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
So he's probably okay

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
It didn't say if he was a senior

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Or what we'll assume he's a senior

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Alright but he told the radio station

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
KIRO that he was being

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Feared that he would be put in detention

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Or that other students would taunt him

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Or whatever and he has no regrets about

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Halo fever and says that meeting Bill Gates

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Was the greatest moment of his life

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
And I find that kind of shocking

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
That the school did not bust him

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
And that the parents called him sick

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
For him with this whole Halo 3

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
I mean wasn't it kind of

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
You know what

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Is this kind of messed up

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
When I was in school all I had to do to get out

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Was like if it was a family function

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Or something important I had to go to

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
All the parents had to do was just say

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Um she could go to school today

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
So why did they have to lie?

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
He should be publicly spanked

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Naughty naughty naughty

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Caning

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
In Singapore

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Hey your BFF Bobby Blackwolf

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Is in chat Loki

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
I believe Bobby was there

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
From when I was reading in his LJ

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
I don't know if I have it all together

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Blackwolf says he was not the first person in line

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
He was the first person who was of age

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
There were two people in front of him

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
That were underage

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
They were skipped

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
So then he was of age

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
Then what's the big deal

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Why is his parents calling for him

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
He's over 18

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
I remember when I was in high school

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
You could check yourself out because you're of age

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Oh wait

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
He might be 17

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
I think he should be disciplined

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
You should not be skipping school for a video game

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Not that I ever did that when Final Fantasy 7

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
First came out or anything

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
But I should have been spanked for doing that

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
It was very naughty

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Sometimes

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
I can tell you right now

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Probably skipping work when Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Naughty naughty

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Whatever

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Jamie, surely there must be a

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Disciplinarian inside of you that thinks

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
There's something wrong with this picture

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
That he's not getting in trouble

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Or his parents are not being mocked openly

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
For basically lying for him

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
For this Halo 3

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
I don't think that there was a necessity to lie

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
But at the same time

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
It's their choice in how they raise him

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
So

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Anything that comes back on him

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Is their fault

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
That's how I see it

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
It's the parents choice

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
So he stayed up past his bedtime

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
God damn

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
No dessert for a week

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
He needs to suck it up though and still go to school the next day

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
So what if you're tired

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Suck it up, come on

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
That's right, I've done that

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Now I've had those late night games

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
When I first came out on the Super Nintendo

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
I must have stayed up until 2 AM in the morning

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Playing that game

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
And then I had to go in to like band the next morning

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
I was so tired

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
I did take a week off the school to play Final Fantasy 3

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Cause was my mom

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Was my mom gonna call the school and say I was sick

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Cause I was playing video games too late

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
She'd say, hell no, you did this

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
You still gotta go to school and you just suffer

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Anyway

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Moving on

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Too much time on this story

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Yep

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Alright

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Well

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
For anyone who was curious as to the details behind

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Bizarre

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
And Activision

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Basically

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
It was actually

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
quoted by their

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
commercial director saying that they were

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
trying to find a long term

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
partner association

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
that they wanted to

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
work on just making good games

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
and not have to deal with

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
the development side

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
of everything so that's why they brought them in

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
They made hot sweet

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
love

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Yes they did and hopefully we'll get a nice baby out of it

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
What's that? Activision's

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
been buying people up lately cause they did the whole

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
They took over Guitar Hero

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
too

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Remember?

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Activision's got money

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
They bought Red Octane

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Well sorta

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
No they bought them, they acquired them

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Well right now though as far as any

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
upcoming releases the only thing

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
really titled right now

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
is that Bizarre has

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Project Gotham Racing 4

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
They also have the club coming

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
out from Sega so that's gonna be

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
the last game that Bizarre's doing

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
If you count I guess

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Geometry Wars Galaxies which is also being

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
released by Sega as well

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
So after all those

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
What happens to Project Gotham 5?

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Well it will be probably put out

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
by Activision or

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Does that mean it's gonna be multi console?

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
PlayStation 3, Project Gotham 5

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
How can this be?

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
I don't know

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Or Project Gotham 5

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
will be developed by another studio

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
You know

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Much like Guitar Hero

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
now is being developed by

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
someone else as well

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Anyways

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Something kinda cool

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Tetris Splash is coming to

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Xbox Live Arcade

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
and

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Apparently

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
It's gonna be Tetris all over again

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Hurrah because if you didn't get your fill

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
What was it? Tetris

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Not Grandmaster

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Well the last Tetris game that came out

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Evolution, whatever the fuck it was called

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Well it will play on

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Live and it will feature

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
4 players offline

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
6 players over Live

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
and lots of blocks

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
in multicolors

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
and apparently a very creepy

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
woman announcer

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Hurrah for creepy women

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
announcers. Boo for the fact I already

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
bought Tetris on the Xbox 360

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
and probably paid way more

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
for it than I should have but I guess that's my own damn

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
fault. I bought that. What was that Tetris

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
game called that was the disc version?

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
I don't know. Obviously it wasn't

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
memorable. Yet another Tetris game now on

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
360 is what it's called now

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
I mean

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Tetris and Pac-Man

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
seriously stop making

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
new games or just re-releasing

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
your old games I guess

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Going to the chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Bobby to the rescue again

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
with the answer about what happens to Project

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Gotham 5. In fact you could say

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
he just owned me. I don't know

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Project Gotham Racing 5 is put out by Microsoft

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Game Studios. It's a Microsoft

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
property. They're moving it to another

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
developer within Microsoft Game Studios

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
So like I said they're moving it to

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
another developer much like Guitar

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Hero 3 moved to a different developer

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
I said I got owned not you got

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
owned. Oh. Yeah

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Yes you did. I did

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
That's alright. I don't play Project Gotham Racing

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
anyway. It's too too confusing

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
I like burnout. It's too sim-like

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
No it's just that you know the

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
racing games are a little different. The cars handled it

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
I crash into walls in Project Gotham Racing

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
more than any other game I play. You need to pick up flat out

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Ultimate Carnage next week. I don't think about it

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
I'm serious. It's awesome. Play the demos

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
over and over and over again. Oh we'll see

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Are you on their payroll?

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
No it's awesome. I'm talking about GameTap

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Seriously. I love

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
the game because I played

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
the original flat out over

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
and over and over again. Playing

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
the ragdoll mode in it where you can just

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
launch the driver through the windshield

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
and do the high jump and stuff

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
I don't know. I just I like

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
breaking stuff and launching

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
drivers through windows and watching

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
them get hurt. Why? Same reason

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
I'm playing Jackass. Yeah I know it's this

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
theme here. You enjoy Jackass the game

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
you enjoy launching people through windows

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
I seem to remember there's that Playstation Network

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
game that's like a crazy guy that

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
does what was that called? Pain? Best

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Pain or whatever? Yeah. That you were all giddy about

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
so you chuckle. You chuckle

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
like a little kid who's setting fire to things in the

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
back of the class. If only they had

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
that game

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Back of the

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Classroom Pyro the game coming to

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Xbox Network game.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
One game I enjoyed quite

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
a bit more than the average person and I'm not

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
sure why maybe just because I like Japanese

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
role playing games or maybe I have such

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
a boner for Chrono Trigger that I was able to

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
look past the fact that the game you know

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
wasn't the greatest RPG of all time but

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
it wasn't bad either. Blue Dragon

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
and one thing

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
that you know I was one of the negatives

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
I was saying about Blue Dragon is it's kind of easy

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
I mean if you just take the time to level

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
up in the very beginning of the game you're always

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
two steps ahead of the enemies and only

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
the boss fights really proved to be difficult

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
well guess what? Blue

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Dragon has come out and said you don't think the game

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
is hard enough? Here's some

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
free download content

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
that will up the difficulty of the game.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
You don't think the hard is game enough?

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Don't worry.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
What? We got covered you.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
You're about to say that.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
I was just

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
showing my translation skills

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
from the Japanese text original.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
The ultra

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
hard mod gives three new

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
aspects to the game. New game

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
plus or game plus which is like

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
gee they had this in Chrono Trigger.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
You just start the game over again with all the

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
stats that you had when you last ended.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
But there's also now hard mode which is

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
twice as challenging as the normal

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
so I guess that means all the enemies do

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
twice as much damage, have twice as much

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
HP and impossible

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
impossible mode is meant

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
to be played with characters starting

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
at level 50 or higher.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
So needless to say you don't want to start this

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
with characters that are level 1.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
No word yet though if you get anything

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
for beating it. I would think that you should get

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
a special achievement or you know

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
a little bonus

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
clip or movie or something for beating

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
it on one of these ultra hard modes. But nope

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
you just get the satisfaction of

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
knowing you're better than everybody else at a game no one

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
seems to care about.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
So congratulations to you.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Don't play a hard game player at Defense Force 2017.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
I will say though I'm thankful

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
that Microsoft is putting out

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
or I guess I should say Microsoft because

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
the devs charge this. Microsoft is putting out.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Yeah Microsoft is putting out quite well

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
but no the developers and Mistwalker

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
and everybody is putting out the game

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
or they're putting out the content for

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
free. Actually I believe Microsoft

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
did publish it themselves. Mistwalker just developed it.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
So they did decide to

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
charge nothing for it. So hooray for

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Microsoft. Thank you for putting out.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Yes we like it when they put out.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Speaking of putting out

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
for the

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
most recent

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
offering from Capcom

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
and the Super Street Fighter 2 series

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
you know Turbo Remix

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
for matching service dot com

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
you know 4chan

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
edition

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
they are having

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
two characters confirmed

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
will be Cammy and M. Bison

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
who in the Japanese version

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
is Vega.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Well that's supposed to be all the same people

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
they're just making them all pretty.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
They

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
do look very high def-ey.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
There's some pictures on here.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Cammy with her humongous thighs.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Well people are saying her humongous

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
camel toe but

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
well that's always been Cammy.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
But yeah.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Go Cammy.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Is that where she got

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
her name from?

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
I don't know.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
But if you can't wait for

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Super Street Fighter 2 HD

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Remix

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
you can possibly find some

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
other fun games at your

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
local stores this week.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Including if you happen to be a fan

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
of basketball games

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
well there's going to be plenty of them

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
with both

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
NBA Live 08

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
NBA 2K8

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
and NBA 08 coming out this week

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
on the 2nd of October.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
And of course Live

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
and 2K will both be on

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Playstation 2, Playstation 3

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
the 360 and then of course Live

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
being on the Wii

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
making it the first basketball game appearance.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
And of course

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
on the PSP as well.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
And then let's see here

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
if you're not a fan of

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
basketball games then maybe you're a fan of some of the

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
other games from VIMVITY

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
including Crash of the Titans

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
and Spyro

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
or Legend of Spyro

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
The Eternal Night

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
and those are supposed to be coming out on

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Playstation 2 for both and then of course

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
on Crash

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Xbox 360

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
and the Wii

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
DS and

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Game Boy Advance.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Then on PSP

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
a kind of crappy rip-off

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
of WarioWare

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Hot Pixel is coming to

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
that system on the 2nd.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
What's funny though is when they

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
released it over here they decided to spell out

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
pixel P-I-X-E-L

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
instead of just the PXL

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
as it was in other regions.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
On

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
also most systems

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Spiderman Friend or Foe

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
is coming out. Looks a little bit better

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
than Spiderman 3 and that's

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
going to be on Playstation 2

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Playstation 3, 360, Wii

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
and some of the handhelds.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
And let's see here

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
also MLB

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Power Pros coming to

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Playstation 2 on the Wii.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
That looks kind of neat.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Also on the DS, Jackass the Game

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
should be coming out this week.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
And on PSP

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Syphon Filter. Do I want to know how to use

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
the touch screen in Jackass the Game

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
because that sounds kind of scary. I don't know but

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
it'll be interesting.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
And then some smaller games here

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
maybe not a smaller game but Legend of Zelda

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Phantom Hourglass is coming out this week.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
And it actually might already be out

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
if you happen to be at the Nintendo World Store.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Other

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
stuff coming out on the Wii this week

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Dave Mirra's BMX Challenge

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
which is crap.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
And then of course the DS

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
also has Race Driver, Create and Race.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Kuru,

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Poto, Cool Cool

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Stars.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Krale the Treasure Adventures.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Arctic Tale. All which sound

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
kind of crappy.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Let's see here. Backyard Football

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
08. Master

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Jinjin's IQ Challenge. Paws

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
and Claws. Dogs and Cats.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
And then on the PC

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
of course all sorts of random

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
stuff including a brand new

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Tycoon game because

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
what would it be without

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
a new Tycoon game almost every single

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
week? Rock Tour

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Tycoon. Man

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
they're really drawn in straws now.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Scraping

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
the bottom of the barrel.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Sounds like fun.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Oh and flat out Ultimate Carnage on

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Xbox 360 as I mentioned earlier.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Nintendo Maniac 64 says I want to see

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Jackass Wii where you throw Wii

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
motes. Like maybe it just puts a

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
big target on your TV and you're encouraged to destroy it.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
They've got some weird little games

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
in that. One of them is

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
the Elephant Pooh

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Dive where you're diving off of a

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
skyscraper into a big bucket

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
of Elephant Pooh and then

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
they've got another one where

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
you're rolling down a

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
ski slope

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
kind of like Katamari and you're rolling

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
over things. They've got a bunch

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
of fun stuff in there. Definitely worth

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
a rental at least. And it's

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
cheap.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Well

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
moving on

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
going to the Japanese release

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
dates. Not a huge week in Japan

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
but if you've been sitting around

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
in Japan you've been going god damn

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
I want a new Dragon Ball Z

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
fighting game. I mean there's just

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
not enough Dragon Ball Z fighting games

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
out there on the market. Well shit you're

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
in luck this week because on the Nintendo Wii

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Dragon Ball Z Sparkling

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Meteor is coming out on the

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Nintendo Wii. I believe that's on the PlayStation

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
too as well.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Thank god that those don't come over

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
at the same subtitles.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
You know actually I should say this though.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Back in the day there used to be this

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
you know blockbuster type store but it was a

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Ma and Pa store that rented video games. But they

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
rented import video games with a little

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
converter. The first Japanese video game

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
I ever rented was a Dragon Ball Z fighting

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
game on the Super Nintendo.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
It was fun too because at the time we was like

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
oh cool this is from Japan. I don't understand

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
anything. You know if you're not part of the solution.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
I still got the old Super Nintendo.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Oh the old Famicom? You got the Famicom?

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Super Famicom. Really? Yeah. Rad. Anyhow

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
sorry back to Japanese release dates. On the

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
PlayStation 2, Bakumatsu Renka

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Karyu Kenshiden is coming out.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
An action game

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
that is probably based on an anime.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
For you Bamani fans

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Guitar Freaks V3 and

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Drummania V3 are out in

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Japan. And see I don't think they have

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Guitar Hero over there and I don't think they're

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
getting Rock Band. So this is

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
what you get in Japan instead. You get

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Guitar Freaks and Drummania.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Of which I have not played

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
V3 or V4 in the arcades

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
at all. I played V2.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Which was pretty much the same game.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
If you will, imagine V2

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
but instead of a 2 there's a 4

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
there and you'll be pretty damn

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
close. Alright, alright. Fair enough.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Smartass. What if there's good

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
songs though? I mean you know those games

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
are only as good as the songs or whatever.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Forget it. Yeah. A chibi

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
little baseball game on the PlayStation 2

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
called Jikoyu Powerful

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Pro Major League 2 is coming

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
out. It looks like if the cast of

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
worms start in a baseball game

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
that's what you get. That's MLB

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Power Pros over here. Oh really?

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Alright, well that shows you how much I follow

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
baseball games. The Crimson and Black

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
DS makes its way to Japan this week.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Take a look at that. Also on the Nintendo

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
DS. It ain't Cookin' Mama

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
but it's kind of close. Koharu

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
no DS Ushigohan

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Shokuji Balance Guide

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Suki. And this

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
what the hell do you do? It looks like a game

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
where you put in what you've been eating

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
like it shows you little pictures

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
of food. Yeah and it shows you

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
like how many grams of fat

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
and how many Kcals you're eating

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
and all that good stuff. Another thing

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
real quick. I think that's the smart

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
idea to bring something like that out over here.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
There's enough people

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
that own DS's that would be interested in that.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
That Crimson and Black DS

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
ain't only coming out in Japan.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Oh really?

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Where else are they going to see it? Over here.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Well it's already out over here.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Well it's out over here in that bundle

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
but it's going to be sold by itself.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Which I mean come on

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
man it's just

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
black and red I mean really

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
DNA. But it's two colors! Oh my

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
god! Well then they should be twice

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
the price then obviously. Can I finish release

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
dates please? Sure. Thank you.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
On the PSP Gundam Battle Chronicle

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
on the PSP

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Mina no Golf Ba Vol. 3

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
which I believe isn't that just their hotshots

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
over there? Yeah. And then

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Shin Sangoku Mosu

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Dynasty Warriors goes into

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
the best hits on the PSP.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
So if you're a fan of Dynasty Warriors

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
price cut enjoy that. That's your Japanese

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
release dates. Horribly butchered

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
pronunciations courtesy of me.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
How about Europe?

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Well there is some

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
well a little fun.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
There's an hour of victory on

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
PC NBA 08

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
hour of victory comes out on the first

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
NBA 08 comes out on the second.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
A bunch of stuff for the fifth there's

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Creed 2 Liberation, Cookie

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
and Cream on DS

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
CSI 3 Dimensions of Murder

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
and then CSI Hard Evidence

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
on PC and Xbox 360

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Dead and Furious on DS

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Deadhead Fred on PSP

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Final Fantasy Tactics The War of Lions

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
on PSP, Glory Days 2

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Brotherhood of Men

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
NFL 08 and Tiger Woods PGA Tour

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
08

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Great.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Alright.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Well let's see here we talked

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
about some 360

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
rumors that will probably come

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
true. Let's talk about some

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
PlayStation 3 rumors

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
which will also probably come true.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
One of which is going to be that the

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
FCC has filed a

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
or had a filing for a brand

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
new PlayStation 3 model

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
and no word

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
on what it is yet but

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
most likely it's going to be that

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
40 gig system that just

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
that rumor won't die that one

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
is supposed to be coming out for

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
$399 or $299 depending on

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
who you're talking to

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
and apparently the

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
specifications for it so far it will have

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Wi-Fi obviously it's going to have Bluetooth

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
etc. and they're identical

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
to the other PlayStation 3 models right

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
now so you know it's not going to

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
be like 20 gig system where it doesn't have

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
any Wi-Fi

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
or stuff like that but

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
still though

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
it's coming whether

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Sony you know

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
admits to it or not it will be coming

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
soon. I bet you that you're going to

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
get an announcement probably any

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
day.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Good times.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
In fact I was going to say there was

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
some other story that was also

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
kind of coinciding with the same thing

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
where they had one of those

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
it was the

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Blu-ray deals

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
that they have going on right now for the PlayStation 3

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
where you buy the system

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
and get five Blu-ray movies. Well that

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
also had the same new

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
SKU number on there as well. So

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
that at least confirms that there will be a new

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
SKU whether it be a 48

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
system or God knows whether

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
size hard drive they're going to throw in with it

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
there is a new SKU coming.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Hmm

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Alright.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Well, Kazurai has

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
commented recently on the PlayStation 3

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
saying the PlayStation original

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
price was just right. Nah nah nah

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
I have no regrets about releasing

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
this for such a high cost even if everybody

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
seems to have a problem with it. Well then you have

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
no regrets for nobody buying

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
it. Okay hold on that's not exactly

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
what he said. Okay here's a quote

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
quote the PS3 has been on the market less than a year

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
in the US and Japan and what is it less than that

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
in Europe? I love

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
that because it doesn't even know. It's difficult

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
right now to say who's where. Clearly

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
we've never started from a position of strength

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
and we've always had to catch up with any generation

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
of hardware that we've brought into the market.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
You know interesting point that I think back to

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
the PlayStation 1 and that is kind of true

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
what he's saying. But I seem to

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
recall with the PlayStation 2 they were

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
kind of the big deal right

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
out the gate. I don't think they ever really

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
I mean I don't know maybe

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
you'd know more about Dreamcast versus PlayStation

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
2 Jamie but I seem to recall you know

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
as much as we love Sega I think Sony

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
was always whooping their ass from the get go weren't they?

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Sadly. Yeah so

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
you know. But I mean

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
we also over here we had to

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
deal with the problems of coming back

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
from the Saturn

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
versus the PlayStation as you'll recall.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Over here the Saturn didn't have the proper

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
support to make it the

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
big machine like it was in Japan.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
In Japan they had all of the

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
2D games. All of the best stuff came out

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
on Saturn. You know I don't know I think this is just

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
excuses though. I mean if you think about it their

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
whole thing is well we haven't been out as

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
long as the 360 so that's why we haven't

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
sold as many units.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
No you still have not figured out

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
why you haven't sold that many units yet.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
And that fact right there is scary

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
as it is if you can't figure out why your system

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
is not selling. I mean

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
dude it's your

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
fucking price. I mean that's why the

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Panasonic 3DO didn't take off because

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
it was $700.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
I mean that's what Rob was asking.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Wait quick name one game on the

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
3DO. 5, 4

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
And it had

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
You Don't Know Jack. I remember playing that

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
game. But back to what Rob asked.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
I bet most people wouldn't have passed that

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
challenge. Sorry. I think that

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
the whole reason, part of the reason why the Dreamcast

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
didn't take off so well over here

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
was just coming off of the

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
American failure of the Saturn.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Because overseas it was

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
the shit. I mean

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
that's why I imported all my games on Saturn.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
But

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
and you know the Dreamcast

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
to me had more fun

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
games on it than the PS2 did

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
but I think it was just coming off of

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
that failure and then

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
but now you know I always looked at

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Microsoft has sort of taken Sega's

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
place as far as systems go

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
and then they've just turned it

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
right around because I honestly think that

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
they're looking into the

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
actual thing that gamers want instead of the

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
thing they think gamers want. You know what I mean?

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
If they want to catch up

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
they need to put out the $399 skew

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
and then they need to start putting out some better

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
games because I think with that price point being

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
in place people will be more likely to buy the

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
system, developers will be more likely

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
to make games for it, etc.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
It's interesting you bring that up, that whole

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Microsoft took Sega's place thing because then you

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
even put, I've thought the same thing actually

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
and it's kind of interesting because you even

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
throw that Peter Moore thing you know because he was with

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
the Dreamcast and then he did the, you know he's not with

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Microsoft anymore but he was definitely a big part of 360

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
it makes it even more eerie

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
that whole comparison.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Anyway, we can move on

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
with the news now, sorry just random

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
sidebars. Really, can I?

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Yes, actually maybe I should go to the chat and see

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
what's going on in chat.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
I'm sorry if I mispronounced this, either

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Wettu or Weetu, I think it's Weetu?

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
There's no A in it though. It says Dreamcast

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
sold really well in New Zealand but

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
PlayStation 2 killed it.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Misty said I never got PlayStation

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
2 until DDR and if I recall

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
correctly I got my PlayStation

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
2 at the same mall GameStop that I got

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
my little DS Lite bundle at.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
BlackWolf says wasn't Tempest 2000

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
on the 3DO? Jaguar.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Jaguar. Was the only game worth getting on the Jaguar?

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
There was another one on

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Jaguar. Okay, one other Jaguar game.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
But

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
yeah, it was all about, and now you

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
can get Tempest 2000 on damn near

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
everything else. Mr. DeBucket says Peter Moore

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
says 9-9 of 99 is still the biggest

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
day in media history? Fuck Halo 3.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
That's right, because the MTV

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Music Awards were on 9-9 of 99

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
weren't they? I was sitting in line for my Dreamcast.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
We can move on, please

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
let's move on.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
That's what I was doing except for when I ran

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
over and bought a book and then came back and

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
waited in line. Wait, BlackWolf says

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
3DO Jaguar, same thing.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
No. Compare the

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
controller sometime. The Jaguar

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
came with like a dictionary for

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
a controller.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
You know what I still think was the most kind of

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
but controller there was was the ColecoVision

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
controller. Yeah, I was going to say it looked very

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
similar to ColecoVision. ColecoVision

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
I mean it could have been like a cell phone of the 80's

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
they had like a whole number pad on there.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
The only game that I played on the

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
ColecoVision that used that number pad was

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Mouse Trap. Seriously?

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
The Jaguar controller

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
reminds me of the Steel Battalion

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
controller. Now the Steel Battalion

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
controller is freaking awesome. It was one

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
eject button short of a Steel Battalion controller

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
that's what it was. Hey, I bought my husband

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
a Steel Battalion controller for his birthday.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Alright. Because I'm the best

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
wife ever. Okay, chat room please

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
stop derailing the show. Yes please.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Let's move on with the news.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
There was a

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
recent FCC filing

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
for a 40GB PS3

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
and Sony isn't saying crap about

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
it. They are

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
really not saying crap about it.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
I don't see any statements, no nothing.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Because

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
they're like, oh shit

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
not again.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
There is no 40GB system just like

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
there was no PSP Slim or

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
no rumbling controllers.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Well

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
at any rate

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
it's there. They're not saying anything

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
end of story.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Or no 80GB

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
system.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Well I already got mine.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Why does it seem like the hard drive

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
is the only thing that freaking changes on that system?

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Because you don't get it. Well people must not like it

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
because they don't have a large enough hard drive.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Well put something for me to put on the hard drive.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Bigger is better Rob. Oh well.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Well Rob, you know you can convert your videos over.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Oh wait, but there isn't really an easy way to do that.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Oh and they don't really tell you how to

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Next story, I'm angry. Sorry.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
I use it for putting videos on there.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
I have a copy of

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Kung Pao on there.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Whoop-de-freaking-do. Hey, Kung Pao

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
is an awesome movie. Don't talk bad about it.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Steve OdoKirk needs to fucking make a sequel.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Anyways. Somebody linked

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
a picture of the Jaguar controller in chat.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
How is that thing supposed to, that's like an original

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Xbox controller, okay.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Where you have to have like gorilla hands to be able to hold

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
that thing.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
See, with it being that big, it makes

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
one sort of wonder about the

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Saturn dual analog controller, but that one

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
is one of the single most

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
comfortable controllers ever. And they wonder

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
why the Xbox didn't sell in Japan.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
I mean, you need like

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
three Japanese hands to hold the Xbox.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
No, Rob, Rob, Rob.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I will point out to you that when they released the

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Xbox in Japan, it did have a smaller controller.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Which they released here, and

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Which I made Dan buy me because

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
I'm sorry, look at these short fingers.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
You do not have gorilla hands.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
You have petite little girly hands.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Alright. Anyways.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
So, it's been confirmed

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
the price of Rock Band, and the date for Rock Band

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
has been announced.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Rock Band will come out on the Xbox 360

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
and Playstation 3 on

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Black Friday. Thank you,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
EA, for

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
$170.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
And of course, that is the bundle

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
which is going to include both

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
a guitar,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
a drum set,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
microphone, and the game. Of course, the game

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
by itself will also be available

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
for $60 in case you

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
just want to play the guitar version and

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000
own a guitar from Guitar Hero.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
However, what is kind of new

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
is they announced that there will be a Playstation 2

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
version for the low, low price of

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
$160. You save $10.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000
And that is coming out on December 10th.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
And of course, we'll feature these same things

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
as well. What I find interesting

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
is that they came out with a Playstation 2

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
version. Something tells me it's because

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
they like money.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
You got to play Rock Band last week.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Is it worth it?

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
For that price? Yeah, I think so. I was going to buy it for

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
$200. Good. I'll come over and play yours

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
because I don't feel like dropping that kind of money

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
on a video game.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Well, hopefully you'll get a pretty decent discount.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
I wish they would send me a copy for free.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
I'll buy the game itself,

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
but I'm not going to buy $100. For a game

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I'll play once, and you know it.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
I'm only going to play it once, probably.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Because we don't have people

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
over all the time. I play

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Guitar Hero 1. I don't see my roommate being somebody

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
where I'm going to be all like, hey, let's bust out

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Rock Band and get down.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
It's a party game. It's a total party game.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Speaking of Guitar Hero 2, whatever fucking happened to

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
their Effector pedal or something that was going to be

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
added later on, I

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
built one of those Effector pedals

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
and now it's for nothing.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Seriously, very disappointing.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Not that it cost me any money to do that, but

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
you know, still very disappointing.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Because it works, too.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Except it doesn't do anything.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Anyways,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I think it's going to be worth it.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
The big thing for me, I think, is going to be to see

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
whether people are going to pay $170

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
for this game or not.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
I will.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I don't know.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
It's going to be big. It's definitely going to sell

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
very well. It's just, are people going to pay

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
$170 for a game?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
And if so,

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
then we're going to see a bunch more.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
I think it is going to be

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
a huge party game. I totally see

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
this is the kind of thing that people who have

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
big families or

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
people that host parties regularly

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
or it's going to become like the

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
we're going to have this at a fundraiser

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
or have Rock Band there. Because Guitar Hero

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
is already like that.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Oh, we're going to have a fundraiser.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
We're going to have a bake sale slash car

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
wash. Guitar Hero is going to be there.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
I don't know. Am I the only one that ever

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
notices that Guitar Hero seems to turn up at these

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
random charity events that you see advertised?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
That's going to be Rock Band.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Well, it's cool, I guess.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
I'm not knocking Rock Band.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
It's just a lot of money to drop on a game.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
It is.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
I don't know.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Now you have me

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
waving on it now.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Oops. Sorry EA.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Sorry, Harmonics.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Well then let's go to the next story before

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Loki changes his mind completely.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
The PlayStation.com shopping service

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
is closing in Japan.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
That's right. In December

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
it will be ending the site's

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
e-commerce services and the service

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
will be coming to a complete halt in February

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
2008. Now while at first glance

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
this might seem like, oh, doom and gloom

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
for the PlayStation, not so.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Because PlayStation.com was for

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
providing downloadable content for the

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
PlayStation 2. But as you guys all know

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
it's all about the PlayStation 3 now

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
and the PlayStation Network.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
PlayStation 2 had downloadable content?

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
I guess in Japan, yeah. Because you get the PlayStation

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
points.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Well anyway, if you still have PlayStation

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
points you can transfer those over to your

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
PlayStation 3 wallet.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
They always get better stuff in Japan.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Hello? Where have you been?

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Where have you been?

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
I don't know.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Well,

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
for anyone who also

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
has been keeping up with more

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
of the downloadable content for PS3

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
especially for our European fans.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Well, I should say fans of the system.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Well,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Sony is pulling

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
their Gran Turismo HD concept

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
from the Japanese store

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
and it's not probably

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
coming out in Europe at all.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
There's been no announcement.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
No nothing.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
They're just not getting it.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Sorry. But now

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
there's a Gran Turismo 5 prologue

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
that will be

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
coming out but there's no date for it

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
in the UK yet.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
So that's kind of a bitch move I think

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
that they're actually getting rid of

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
the free version

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
of Gran Turismo on there

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
before the paid

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
demo I guess comes out.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Well, if you have a PS3 now

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
might as well download it.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Put it on your hard drive.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Honestly, what else are you going to

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
fill that hard drive with?

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
It wasn't a bad game.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
I mean it's good for a demo.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
I just can't see myself paying 50 bucks

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
I can't see myself paying 50 bucks

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
for Gran Turismo 5

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
prologue. I'm telling you

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
put porn on the Playstation Network

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Sony will start out selling Microsoft

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
consoles tomorrow.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Mark my words.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Okay, don't

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
mark my words. Read another story.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Mark my words.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Parrish.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
The fuck was that?

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
That sounded funny.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Do you need some fresh air, Loki?

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
I'm feeling fine. I have to drive from Oakland.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
I'm feeling tingle fresh.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Mark my words.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
You will pay for that.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
By the way, kids, don't forget to buy

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
the Eye of Judgment. We only have to sell a million.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
If you don't know what I'm talking about, listen to last week's show.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
It will never happen.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Never.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Story.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
So, in Europe

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Playstation 3 is getting another

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
bundle. Not surprising

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
though, it's going to be bundled with Pro

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Evolution Soccer 2008.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
And it's coming in November.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
That's all there is to say.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Yeah, it was confirmed

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
by Playstation France and

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Well, that's logical.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
You know, sports bundles are nothing

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
uncommon and certainly in Europe a soccer

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
bundle is going to sell some systems.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
So, you know, makes sense.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Exactly. I mean,

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
remember that really crappy one that they did

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
for, I think it was Pro Evo

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
2007. It was like with

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
AstroTurf on the 360.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Wait, it came with AstroTurf? What?

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
They did like, it was an auction

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
thing where they were selling it.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
What?

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Well, ten years

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Funny! Not funny.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Ten years have passed since Ultima Online

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
first rolled out. That's right, back in

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
1997 was when Ultima Online was

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
first unleashed upon the world.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
And now EA is celebrating with a ten

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
years of Ultima Online celebration.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
There's a brand new

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Kingdom Reborn update,

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
which I think we reported on previously in the program.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
It's free to download for the previous

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
subscribers through October 9th.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
But, however, there's also now

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
the Return to Britannia campaign

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
that's going on. Electronic Arts

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
is doing a monster hunt and

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
prizes such as a new pendant necklace,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
a whole map of Britannia that you can win,

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
a commemorative sculpture,

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
armor set, all this stuff.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
The characters in game get fireworks

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
and ten decor tokens.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Unfortunately, I haven't played the game

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
so I can't tell you what those tokens do,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
but maybe somebody can email us and let us know

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
and mail back buy more fireworks!

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I was actually going to check this game out because I think

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
you can get a two week free trial.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Since I've been going back and forth on all these MMOs lately,

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
why not check out the granddaddy of all the

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
MMOs? I remember when I played

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Ultima Online with my friend briefly,

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
and god, I remember who it was.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
It was still long ago, but

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
we were complete

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
asses on the game and it was fun.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Did you get banned? Oh no, we were just

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
playing around at his

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
house and just running around

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
as our character was completely naked

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
yelling sausage for sale.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
That's all I remember.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
That's all I remember.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
That's all I remember.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
I think I saw that in the

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
barons the other day, so some things never

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
change, you know?

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
No, no, no, no, no.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Someone was walking around in one of the

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
towns in Ragnarok the other day going,

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
I got a snake mange!

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Like the Adam Sandler thing.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Now they've taken that and now it's just slash dance.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Does Ultima Online have

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
slash dance? We don't have slash dance

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
I just remember it was weird because people would buy

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
houses and they would store their horse in

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
their house and I was like, why would you put a

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
why were we walking past a house

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
where I hear a horse? It was weird.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
But it was because you can lock the houses, otherwise

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
your stuff would get stolen, I guess, or something.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
I think Misty sums up my thoughts

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
on the Ultima Online bonus stuff.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
She says, Woot explosives.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
That's true, explosives are always

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
good incentive to come back to an

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
old abandoned MMO. I shouldn't say

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
that, actually. I guess there's still quite a few

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
people who play Ultima Online. I just

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
don't know any of them.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Oh well, perhaps some will email us.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
I know a couple of people who play. Really?

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Yeah.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Alright. Ask them if they're having

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
fun with the event or whatever. We'll have to

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
bring them on the show for an interview. Interview this

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
week, people that actually play Ultima Online. It's either

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Ultima Online or Diablo. Oh, because they're so similar.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
They look very similar, actually.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Some of them I just

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
sort of get mixed up on. Like, who plays EverQuest

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
anymore? We never...

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
To be honest, when I went out to

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Pennsylvania

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
last year, one of the

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
workers at our office

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
that we work with out there, without saying too much about what I do

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
during the day, she

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
knew that I was into video games. I said, yeah,

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
at the time I was playing Final Fantasy 11.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I'm like, yeah, I play Final Fantasy 11. She's all, oh, I

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
tried that once, but I just can't give up EverQuest.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
She's like, me and my husband play EverQuest

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
all the time. You haven't played EverQuest? I'm like, I watched

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
it once and I was bored out of my mind.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
But, yeah, I've seen it.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
There are people out there that still play EverQuest.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
We just don't really hear much about it anymore.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
It's harder to find people that are playing

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
EverQuest 2 because nobody wanted

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
to abandon their EverQuest character. I think that was one of the

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
biggest mistakes they made, is they should have made a way

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
for you can at least get some type of bonuses

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
for bringing your character over from EverQuest 1.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Maybe I'm just crazy, I don't know.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Anyhow,

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
DarkSakura, every week

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
she likes to surf the internet up and down and all

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
around and bring you her very favorite in

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
websites. By the way, folks,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
this is the very last edition of

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
DarkSakura's website of the week.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Sorry to report, DarkSakura

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
is no longer going to be able to give you a website of the week

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
because pretty

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
much you can bet that

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
if the site has something to do with

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
pictures of cats, it's probably going to be

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
her website of the week. No.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
I've done a bunch of cool

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
sites, Rob. In all seriousness,

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
DarkSakura's website of the week...

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
One had two website of the week mentions.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
That's right. The Weebles.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
That's right. Well, anyway, or Doctor Who.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
No, there's multiple Doctor Who

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
sites, but I've done Weebles twice. Anyway,

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
DarkSakura's website of the week will be going away

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
in favor of DarkSakura's

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Classic Game of the Week.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Well, yeah. You better pick a good one for the very first

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
week next week, the Classic Game of the Week. I already know what I'm

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
going to pick. So here it is for the very last time. And it's not

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
the Guardian Legend. I'm so disappointed.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
No, that's too predictable.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Guardian Legend will save for down

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
the road, but we'll do the Classic Game of the Week. It'll be something obscure

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
like rainbow cotton. Alright.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Anyhow, don't give it away.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
They won't want to tune in next week.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Make it a game you don't talk about a lot

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
on the show.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Anyhow, here it is, ladies and gentlemen,

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
the very last website of the week.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
DarkSakura, you better be good.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
The website

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
of the week is

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
speaklolcat.com

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
It's very easy,

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
very simple.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
You type in something in English and it translates

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
it into catspeak.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
What did I tell all of you?

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
If it has to do with lolcat, it's your

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
side of the week. See, I'm going to type in something right now.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Um, okay.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
I don't know. I'm talking and I'm...

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
What are you putting in there? Rob is a big what?

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Tool. Tool?

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
And it says Rob is huge tool.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Hahahaha

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Lovely.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
I'm going to post that direct link into the chatroom.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.000
But, um, it's speaklolcat.com

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
And that, boys and girls, is the very last

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
website of the week.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
End of line.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Alright, so next week, DarkSakura's classic game

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
of the week. Yay!

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Oh, you can actually link it

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
with it saying Rob is a big tool.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Yep, that's why I did it.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Let me just check that out on my screen here.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Rob is huge tool.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
You're a bitch.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Alright. I love you.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Wait, actually, I want to see that.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Let me go back to that site here.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Jamie is a bitch.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Rob's really good at typing with one hand.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
I am. I can do a lot of things with one hand.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Jamie is bish.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Okay, where did that come from?

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:39.000
I think this show is in need of a break.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
I think this show might actually be in need of cancellation.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
But we'll have to do it for a break for now.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Right after this, Nintendo News,

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
in part, we haven't even touched Nintendo yet during the show.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
We'll get to all the Nintendo news in part B

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
and plenty more to come.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Don't worry, we'll touch Nintendo plenty when we come back.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
We'll get out our wheeze when we come back.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights
