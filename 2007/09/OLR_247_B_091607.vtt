00:15.300 --> 00:20.300
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.300 --> 00:27.300
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Part B of our podcast for this September the 16th of 2007.

00:27.300 --> 00:30.300
And of course remember as always, Orange Lounge Radio is released in two parts.

00:30.300 --> 00:33.800
So if you haven't heard tonight's Part A, you're only here in half the show.

00:33.800 --> 00:38.300
So head on over to orangeloungeradio.com for more information on how to download our show

00:38.300 --> 00:40.300
and catch up on everything that you've missed.

00:40.300 --> 00:43.300
But for now, Loki's going to take us right back into the gaming news.

00:43.300 --> 00:44.300
I am?

00:44.300 --> 00:45.300
You are.

00:45.300 --> 00:46.300
Okay, I am.

00:46.300 --> 00:47.300
Just kidding.

00:47.300 --> 00:53.300
Anyways, so there was a game that we saw a couple years back when they were first showing off the Wii.

00:53.300 --> 00:54.300
And it was kind of neat.

00:54.300 --> 00:58.300
I thought the title was retarded, but whatever.

00:58.300 --> 01:01.300
So there's this game, Project Hammer.

01:01.300 --> 01:05.300
And while people were speculating, is it on hold?

01:05.300 --> 01:06.300
What's going on?

01:06.300 --> 01:08.300
Well, according to Famitsu, it's been cancelled.

01:08.300 --> 01:11.300
And it's not coming back.

01:11.300 --> 01:17.300
So that's too bad because who doesn't like hitting people with a giant cybernetic hammer?

01:17.300 --> 01:21.300
Yeah, I remember the game seemed alright at E3 in the demos.

01:21.300 --> 01:25.300
It was there the first year the Wii was there, last year in 06.

01:25.300 --> 01:26.300
It wasn't that long ago.

01:26.300 --> 01:27.300
Yeah, I'm surprised.

01:27.300 --> 01:29.300
The last big E3 or whatever you want to call it.

01:29.300 --> 01:32.300
I'm surprised that it looked cool.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.300
I don't know why they wouldn't put it out.

01:34.300 --> 01:36.300
Or just some other company put it out.

01:36.300 --> 01:37.300
Seriously.

01:37.300 --> 01:38.300
It wasn't bad.

01:38.300 --> 01:41.300
It's better than DK Bongo Blast.

01:41.300 --> 01:42.300
I wonder why they ended up canceling it.

01:42.300 --> 01:43.300
I wonder what we're going to get instead.

01:43.300 --> 01:49.300
Because sometimes when these games get cancelled, something else comes out instead that makes it kind of worth the wait.

01:49.300 --> 01:53.300
They should have the Project Hammer guy in Super Smash Brothers. That'd be hilarious.

01:53.300 --> 02:00.300
Didn't they say at game developers conferences this year that Peekman was the result of something else?

02:00.300 --> 02:02.300
It was the result of Mario's...

02:02.300 --> 02:05.300
Yeah, it was a Mario concept ended up being the Peekman game.

02:05.300 --> 02:07.300
So you never know what might happen.

02:07.300 --> 02:09.300
Frisbee asked a good question in chat.

02:09.300 --> 02:12.300
Whatever happened to that game's sadness?

02:12.300 --> 02:13.300
It's still being worked on.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.300
Is it?

02:14.300 --> 02:15.300
As far as I'm aware.

02:15.300 --> 02:16.300
Alright, we'll see.

02:16.300 --> 02:19.300
Now this is pretty cool. Some new information about the Wii.

02:19.300 --> 02:22.300
And I know this will make Dark Sakura all kinds of excited.

02:22.300 --> 02:29.300
It has been announced that TurboGrafx-16 CD games are on their way to Wii Virtual Console.

02:29.300 --> 02:33.300
And I believe some of the earlier titles were announced.

02:33.300 --> 02:37.300
I have not seen... I don't remember what was on the early list.

02:37.300 --> 02:40.300
Sadly, the Dracula game you love, Jamie, wasn't on there.

02:40.300 --> 02:41.300
I do remember.

02:41.300 --> 02:43.300
I want to say Ys I and II was on it though.

02:43.300 --> 02:44.300
Yeah, Ys I and II was on there.

02:44.300 --> 02:47.300
That's great. I actually have that game, but it's still awesome.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.300
But I'm curious how it now and what we're all wondering about...

02:49.300 --> 02:50.300
I want the Volus games.

02:50.300 --> 02:53.300
Well, how the hell are they going to fit all this on the Virtual Console?

02:53.300 --> 02:55.300
Because the Wii only has so much internal memory.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.300
Okay, first of all, the biggest things about the TurboGrafx-16 CD games

02:58.300 --> 03:03.300
were that most of the audio on the Microsoft is all Redbook audio.

03:03.300 --> 03:06.300
So all you'd have to do is compress it.

03:06.300 --> 03:08.300
Or maybe they've removed the audio from the games.

03:08.300 --> 03:09.300
Do you think that maybe they've done that?

03:09.300 --> 03:10.300
No, I think it's compressed.

03:10.300 --> 03:15.300
Just put it down to MP3. It'd probably be really small or Ogg Vorbis or whatever they want to use.

03:15.300 --> 03:16.300
Oh, we'll see.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.300
But I imagine you won't be able to fit that many of those on the game.

03:18.300 --> 03:21.300
Or they're going to start selling these memory cards or something,

03:21.300 --> 03:23.300
Virtual Console memory cards, or I don't know.

03:23.300 --> 03:26.300
Obviously, any memory card will work, but you guys know what I mean.

03:26.300 --> 03:29.300
They might start pushing people to get more memory cards.

03:29.300 --> 03:33.300
The games themselves, though, didn't take up a whole lot of space.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.300
I mean, they're just really the equivalent of...

03:36.300 --> 03:39.300
I think one of the biggest ones that I personally have is Sapphire,

03:39.300 --> 03:44.300
which has some rendered graphics in it.

03:44.300 --> 03:47.300
No, actually, it has some true polygons in it.

03:47.300 --> 03:51.300
And some of the CD arcade games,

03:51.300 --> 03:59.300
but if we're just getting out East and all the other sprite-based ones,

03:59.300 --> 04:02.300
that wouldn't take any space at all.

04:02.300 --> 04:04.300
And the games are only going to be 800 points.

04:04.300 --> 04:05.300
That's a pretty good deal.

04:05.300 --> 04:06.300
Yeah, that's a really good deal.

04:06.300 --> 04:08.300
I don't think it's going to be a major thing at all.

04:08.300 --> 04:14.300
Especially if they're doing the Bomberman CD that came as a pack-in with the duo.

04:14.300 --> 04:16.300
Or...

04:16.300 --> 04:18.300
Rondo of Blood, maybe?

04:18.300 --> 04:20.300
Rondo of Blood could actually easily be done.

04:20.300 --> 04:23.300
If we're getting Super Nintendo cartridges on there,

04:23.300 --> 04:26.300
it is not going to be hard at all for them to do Rondo of Blood.

04:26.300 --> 04:29.300
How much of a fangasm will you have if Rondo of Blood comes out on Virtual Console?

04:29.300 --> 04:33.300
I'd be like, thank God, I don't have to put my disc in the machine anymore.

04:33.300 --> 04:38.300
My actual Rondo of Blood CD is still in perfect condition,

04:38.300 --> 04:41.300
but I twitch every time.

04:41.300 --> 04:46.300
I can't move the machine while I'm playing it because the disc costs $300.

04:46.300 --> 04:50.300
It was saying that they were talking about,

04:50.300 --> 04:55.300
it's going to be 10 games in 2007, 5 more slated for 2008.

04:55.300 --> 04:58.300
Game downloads will be 800 points.

04:58.300 --> 05:02.300
And I guess they are saying Rondo of Blood and Snatcher are true possibilities.

05:02.300 --> 05:05.300
Huh. We'll see.

05:05.300 --> 05:06.300
That'd be awesome.

05:06.300 --> 05:07.300
That'd be really cool.

05:07.300 --> 05:13.300
Well, speaking of our Virtual Console, let me go ahead and cover our UK Virtual Console.

05:13.300 --> 05:17.300
For 600 points, we have Super Mario Bros. The Lost Levels,

05:17.300 --> 05:19.300
which is a Famicom disc game,

05:19.300 --> 05:22.300
and actually, according to this, it isn't the touched-up one

05:22.300 --> 05:27.300
that was on the Super Mario All-Stars Super Nintendo cartridge.

05:27.300 --> 05:31.300
Instead, this is the actual Super Mario Bros. 2 that came out in Japan,

05:31.300 --> 05:33.300
which is freaking hard.

05:33.300 --> 05:36.300
That's rad, though, that they actually released that on Virtual Console,

05:36.300 --> 05:40.300
because we have never in this country seen the original Lost Levels,

05:40.300 --> 05:44.300
except on ROMs, but if I seem to recall right, wasn't that a disc game?

05:44.300 --> 05:47.300
That's what I said. It was a Famicom disc game.

05:47.300 --> 05:48.300
Wow.

05:48.300 --> 05:51.300
And so the price for it is going to be 600 points,

05:51.300 --> 05:54.300
but I think that that's actually fair,

05:54.300 --> 05:58.300
because it is basically a game that,

05:58.300 --> 06:01.300
at least unless you owned a disc system,

06:01.300 --> 06:05.300
you have never seen either remade or, you know,

06:05.300 --> 06:08.300
it's the only unadulterated version of it that's going to be out.

06:08.300 --> 06:11.300
Well, I mean, they have the one that was all touched up,

06:11.300 --> 06:14.300
like they have the Super Nintendo, but that was different.

06:14.300 --> 06:17.300
Yeah, but this is the actual one.

06:17.300 --> 06:19.300
That's going to be pretty good.

06:19.300 --> 06:22.300
And it's not Doki Doki Panic.

06:22.300 --> 06:24.300
But maybe Doki Doki Panic will come out

06:24.300 --> 06:27.300
now that they're releasing Japanese games on the console.

06:27.300 --> 06:30.300
Yes, that opens huge doors now.

06:30.300 --> 06:32.300
Well, here's a little bit more.

06:32.300 --> 06:36.300
We have Mario Super P-Cross coming out,

06:36.300 --> 06:39.300
which is 900 Wii points.

06:39.300 --> 06:44.300
And then we have Neutopia 2, which we were discussing.

06:44.300 --> 06:47.300
Right, so the UK finally got Neutopia 2 then.

06:47.300 --> 06:49.300
So it looks like for these missing games,

06:49.300 --> 06:52.300
they're charging 100 more points, is basically how it boils down to,

06:52.300 --> 06:54.300
these never-before-seen.

06:54.300 --> 06:55.300
Well, for anyone who doesn't know,

06:55.300 --> 06:57.300
Neutopia 2 is going to be at 600 points.

06:57.300 --> 06:59.300
Well, but that's one they've seen before.

06:59.300 --> 07:01.300
So I'm curious, when does the US get this?

07:01.300 --> 07:03.300
Because we've got to get it soon.

07:03.300 --> 07:06.300
I don't know, but it's all part of this brand new,

07:06.300 --> 07:08.300
I guess it's a thing that they're doing right now,

07:08.300 --> 07:13.300
the Hanabi Festival in Europe and Australia.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.300
And I guess this is week one is Mario Week.

07:15.300 --> 07:19.300
Next week, they're going to be having Ninja Week.

07:19.300 --> 07:24.300
And that's going to include Ninja Gaiden and Ninja Jaja Maru-kun.

07:24.300 --> 07:28.300
And then I guess the third week is going to be Sci-Fi Week,

07:28.300 --> 07:32.300
and that's going to have Sin and Punishment and Gradius 3.

07:32.300 --> 07:34.300
That's a good game.

07:34.300 --> 07:39.300
Actually, of the Gradius games, which one's your favorite?

07:39.300 --> 07:42.300
Well, I've got to go to Salamander.

07:42.300 --> 07:43.300
So I'm cheating.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.300
I'm going to say Salamander.

07:45.300 --> 07:48.300
I'm going to say Gradius 2 with the sun.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.300
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

07:50.300 --> 07:52.300
Yeah, with Burning Heat, the Burning Heat stage.

07:52.300 --> 07:55.300
Well, I actually have that one on TurboGrafx.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.300
Yeah, you know, I don't know.

07:56.300 --> 07:58.300
But I do have the Gradius collection on PSP,

07:58.300 --> 07:59.300
so I have a lot of those games.

07:59.300 --> 08:02.300
But I miss Salamander or Life Force.

08:02.300 --> 08:04.300
But I think Salamander was a slight bit cooler,

08:04.300 --> 08:06.300
because they had better graphics in their case.

08:06.300 --> 08:09.300
I'm really hoping, now this is completely off topic here,

08:09.300 --> 08:11.300
and I did Life Force or Salamander.

08:11.300 --> 08:14.300
I was going to say, it'd be really awesome if they did.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.300
They really need to do this in the U.S. as well.

08:16.300 --> 08:22.300
And I think they also need to do the Nintendo World Championships cart

08:22.300 --> 08:26.300
and have that with an online leaderboard with score,

08:26.300 --> 08:30.300
so you can post it on there if anyone remembers that.

08:30.300 --> 08:32.300
The World Championship cart?

08:32.300 --> 08:33.300
Yeah.

08:33.300 --> 08:34.300
I'm kind of curious.

08:34.300 --> 08:36.300
I'm going to ask the chat room what kinds of import games

08:36.300 --> 08:40.300
that we've been missing in the U.S. or the U.K. for a long time.

08:40.300 --> 08:42.300
Would you like to see come to Virtual Console?

08:42.300 --> 08:44.300
I'm sure somebody's going to say Doki Doki Panic,

08:44.300 --> 08:46.300
although in some extent we kind of...

08:46.300 --> 08:48.300
I'll take the first five ones on Pirate Message. How's that?

08:48.300 --> 08:50.300
We already have Doki Doki Panic.

08:50.300 --> 08:52.300
You want to take some private messages?

08:52.300 --> 08:54.300
Yeah. Send me the first five private messages.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.300
Tell me what import game you'd like to see come out.

08:56.300 --> 08:57.300
All right. Then we'll read those in a little bit.

08:57.300 --> 08:58.300
Yeah.

08:58.300 --> 09:00.300
Send Dark Sakura, private message in our chat.

09:00.300 --> 09:02.300
But it has to be in our regular chat room,

09:02.300 --> 09:03.300
chat.orangelandrater.com.

09:03.300 --> 09:05.300
And not 2DX.

09:05.300 --> 09:07.300
Okay. Remember, if you're watching us on Operator 11,

09:07.300 --> 09:09.300
we're not looking at the chat room over there,

09:09.300 --> 09:11.300
because our computer that streams Op 11

09:11.300 --> 09:13.300
is all the way on the other side of the room.

09:13.300 --> 09:17.300
So, wow. Virtual Console.

09:17.300 --> 09:20.300
So, there's other neat stuff, I guess.

09:20.300 --> 09:23.300
Oblivion's Gamebryo engine has been ported to the Wii now.

09:23.300 --> 09:28.300
So, now that doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to see Oblivion on the Wii,

09:28.300 --> 09:32.300
but it means maybe we'll see some better games coming to the Wii as well.

09:32.300 --> 09:35.300
And, of course, the Gamebryo engine's been used from everything,

09:35.300 --> 09:40.300
including Freedom 4, Civ 4, Dark Age of Camelot,

09:40.300 --> 09:43.300
and, oh, I mean, that's pretty cool.

09:43.300 --> 09:46.300
Maybe we'll see an actual cool role-playing game or something,

09:46.300 --> 09:47.300
maybe something scaled down.

09:47.300 --> 09:48.300
Hey, they could do Oblivion,

09:48.300 --> 09:51.300
or the PSP version that was supposed to be coming out a while ago.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.300
The hell ever happened to the Wii, or the PSP version?

09:53.300 --> 09:55.300
I don't think it's coming. I think it got cancelled.

09:55.300 --> 09:56.300
Really?

09:56.300 --> 10:01.300
But, hey, who says they can't port that over to maybe the Wii or something,

10:01.300 --> 10:03.300
where they have a little bit more disk space to work with,

10:03.300 --> 10:08.300
and, I don't know, real-time sword controls, maybe?

10:08.300 --> 10:10.300
I don't know. Just speculation here.

10:10.300 --> 10:12.300
Huh. Interesting.

10:12.300 --> 10:16.300
Well, certainly if these guys want to use this Oblivion engine

10:16.300 --> 10:18.300
to make new games for the Wii,

10:18.300 --> 10:20.300
it's not like there's a shortage of Wiis out there.

10:20.300 --> 10:23.300
I mean, certainly these things are still selling pretty well.

10:23.300 --> 10:26.300
I'm sure we've had plenty of sales stories on the Wii in previous shows.

10:26.300 --> 10:28.300
And, of course, this all leads up to Christmas.

10:28.300 --> 10:31.300
You might remember last Christmas, finding a Wii was tough.

10:31.300 --> 10:35.300
I mean, it was the Cabbage Patch Kids, or the Furbies, of last year.

10:35.300 --> 10:38.300
So, yeah, and actually, rare fact, or rare dumb little tidbit,

10:38.300 --> 10:42.300
I actually own a Furby that I got that Christmas,

10:42.300 --> 10:44.300
because I'm a consumer whore.

10:44.300 --> 10:46.300
There was only one cool Furby, Rob.

10:46.300 --> 10:47.300
What's that?

10:47.300 --> 10:48.300
The Gizmo one.

10:48.300 --> 10:49.300
For gremlins.

10:49.300 --> 10:52.300
All right, but anyway, back to the Nintendo Wii.

10:52.300 --> 10:55.300
So, folks in the media are starting to ask Reggie Fils-Aime,

10:55.300 --> 10:57.300
the man over at Nintendo,

10:57.300 --> 10:58.300
what's up?

10:58.300 --> 11:01.300
Are you guys going to have enough supply this Christmas season?

11:01.300 --> 11:02.300
Well, Reggie Fils-Aime says,

11:02.300 --> 11:06.300
quote, Wii hardware that will be in North American stores will be unprecedented,

11:06.300 --> 11:08.300
substantially more than the launch,

11:08.300 --> 11:11.300
substantially more than has been seen to date.

11:11.300 --> 11:15.300
And that was a quote that Reggie Fils-Aime said to the San Jose Mercury News.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.300
So, of course, if you really want one of these, though,

11:18.300 --> 11:23.300
Reggie Fils-Aime still says you should regularly check to see if the system is available.

11:23.300 --> 11:27.300
So even though they're saying they're going to flow through the streets with Wii supplies,

11:27.300 --> 11:29.300
you probably still want to call the store and check,

11:29.300 --> 11:30.300
because they might still be selling out.

11:30.300 --> 11:31.300
I'll believe it when I see it.

11:31.300 --> 11:32.300
That's what I'm saying.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.300
I'll believe that shit when I see it.

11:34.300 --> 11:35.300
Really?

11:35.300 --> 11:36.300
I don't believe.

11:36.300 --> 11:39.300
I mean, obviously, I haven't tried to purchase a Wii in a long time.

11:39.300 --> 11:40.300
How is it out there?

11:40.300 --> 11:42.300
I mean, are they still pretty hard to find?

11:42.300 --> 11:43.300
It's been getting worse.

11:43.300 --> 11:44.300
Really?

11:44.300 --> 11:45.300
Yeah.

11:45.300 --> 11:47.300
Promises, promises, and then no fucking delivery.

11:47.300 --> 11:48.300
That's what it's been.

11:48.300 --> 11:49.300
Sad face.

11:49.300 --> 11:53.300
I just hope they have some games to move those systems this year,

11:53.300 --> 11:56.300
but I guess we get in Smash Brothers Brawl, Mario Galaxy.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.300
Those will be two AAA titles.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.300
Don't get me wrong.

11:59.300 --> 12:02.300
They have a pretty good first-party lineup for the rest of this year,

12:02.300 --> 12:06.300
and even January, hopefully Mario Kart soon.

12:06.300 --> 12:07.300
True.

12:07.300 --> 12:10.300
But it's all about systems.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.300
You really need the systems,

12:11.300 --> 12:14.300
and I really hope that he's not blowing smoke up my ass.

12:14.300 --> 12:20.300
Let's hope not, because I don't like smoke in my ass, much like meat.

12:20.300 --> 12:22.300
Anyways.

12:22.300 --> 12:25.300
Well, we got our responses in.

12:25.300 --> 12:26.300
Okay.

12:26.300 --> 12:27.300
Let's hear them.

12:27.300 --> 12:30.300
Mario Kristoff says, Kuru Kuru Kuru Rin.

12:30.300 --> 12:31.300
I don't even know that game.

12:31.300 --> 12:33.300
It's a Game Boy Advance game.

12:33.300 --> 12:35.300
Oh, and you can't have Game Boy.

12:35.300 --> 12:36.300
I know.

12:36.300 --> 12:37.300
They don't do Game Boy games on Virtual Console.

12:37.300 --> 12:38.300
Cheater.

12:38.300 --> 12:39.300
It'd be good if they could.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.300
A damn dirty cheater?

12:40.300 --> 12:41.300
No, I'm just kidding.

12:41.300 --> 12:43.300
Foodie Monster says, Gauss Panic.

12:43.300 --> 12:44.300
Oh, yes.

12:44.300 --> 12:45.300
That would rock.

12:45.300 --> 12:46.300
Yes, winner.

12:46.300 --> 12:49.300
GS68 says, Gradius II, NES version.

12:49.300 --> 12:50.300
Don't we already have it?

12:50.300 --> 12:52.300
No, we don't.

12:52.300 --> 12:53.300
In Japan, they got it.

12:53.300 --> 12:54.300
Yes.

12:54.300 --> 12:57.300
Hit Sense says Pulseman for the Mega Drive.

12:57.300 --> 12:58.300
Wow.

12:58.300 --> 13:01.300
Well, you know what I would pick for Mega Drive?

13:01.300 --> 13:03.300
It'd freaking be Panorama Cotton.

13:03.300 --> 13:04.300
Oh, hell yeah.

13:04.300 --> 13:05.300
Good luck.

13:05.300 --> 13:07.300
Well, you know I have Rainbow Cotton.

13:07.300 --> 13:08.300
I know.

13:08.300 --> 13:11.300
This somehow comes up, because I seem to remember I asked.

13:11.300 --> 13:14.300
I made the mistake of asking in the early days of OLR.

13:14.300 --> 13:17.300
Because Jamie has a very scary collection of video games at her house.

13:17.300 --> 13:18.300
What are you missing?

13:18.300 --> 13:20.300
What's the one thing you want that you're missing?

13:20.300 --> 13:23.300
And Jamie always goes, freaking Panorama Cotton.

13:23.300 --> 13:25.300
Okay, Panorama Cotton.

13:25.300 --> 13:28.300
Sega made 600 copies of it.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.300
I know somebody who owns one.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.300
And I got to touch it.

13:32.300 --> 13:35.300
And it was a special day in my life.

13:35.300 --> 13:37.300
Did you touch it with your fingers?

13:37.300 --> 13:39.300
Did you rub it on your arm or your boots?

13:39.300 --> 13:42.300
I have actually played a legit Panorama Cotton before.

13:42.300 --> 13:43.300
Did you?

13:43.300 --> 13:44.300
It was really, really nice.

13:44.300 --> 13:45.300
Can I touch your hand?

13:45.300 --> 13:48.300
Oh, I've touched the hand that touched a Panorama Cotton.

13:48.300 --> 13:51.300
I'll hook you up with playing Panorama Cotton.

13:51.300 --> 13:52.300
All right, all right.

13:52.300 --> 13:57.300
RalstonUT suggests Terranigma and Dragon Quest 5 and 6.

13:57.300 --> 13:58.300
Okay.

13:58.300 --> 13:59.300
Well, that might be cool.

13:59.300 --> 14:01.300
I mean, but obviously they might have to translate it.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.300
And I don't think these other ones were translated, so.

14:03.300 --> 14:07.300
Frisbee mentioned the Japanese Mario Brothers 2,

14:07.300 --> 14:08.300
not the alternate version,

14:08.300 --> 14:10.300
but that was the one they're getting in the UK on Virtual Console.

14:10.300 --> 14:12.300
So it's only really a matter of time.

14:12.300 --> 14:13.300
Cool.

14:13.300 --> 14:16.300
And Darktatsuya says, Crisis Force.

14:16.300 --> 14:17.300
Wow.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.300
So what would you pick, Rob?

14:19.300 --> 14:24.300
How about the version of Excitebike where you could actually save and load?

14:24.300 --> 14:26.300
That would be the disc version.

14:26.300 --> 14:29.300
Why didn't they do that for the fucking Virtual Console version?

14:29.300 --> 14:30.300
That's a really good question.

14:30.300 --> 14:31.300
I don't know.

14:31.300 --> 14:32.300
Okay, you know what I want?

14:32.300 --> 14:33.300
Here's what I want.

14:33.300 --> 14:35.300
You want to talk about like fucking obscure only available in Japan only?

14:35.300 --> 14:40.300
I want the Zelda 1 remake that was on the Nintendo Channel thing,

14:40.300 --> 14:41.300
the whatever it was called.

14:41.300 --> 14:42.300
The MBS Satellaview.

14:42.300 --> 14:43.300
That's it.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.300
The Satellaview.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.300
Satellaview.

14:45.300 --> 14:47.300
What was the slower you made about it?

14:47.300 --> 14:48.300
Just different graphics?

14:48.300 --> 14:51.300
It was Super Nintendo graphics and I think it had shorter levels.

14:51.300 --> 14:52.300
Yeah.

14:52.300 --> 14:58.300
The Satellaview was a pay service where you had a timer for how long you could play,

14:58.300 --> 15:01.300
but there are hacked ROMs out there now that you can play it without a timer.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.300
Are there really?

15:02.300 --> 15:03.300
Yeah, Dan played through it.

15:03.300 --> 15:04.300
Oh.

15:04.300 --> 15:05.300
Played through it.

15:05.300 --> 15:06.300
I didn't know that there were ROMs in there.

15:06.300 --> 15:08.300
Do you know one of the ones, though, that Melody has?

15:08.300 --> 15:09.300
Hmm.

15:09.300 --> 15:12.300
She has the contest version of Star Fox.

15:12.300 --> 15:13.300
Oh, that's rad.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.300
From the big competition.

15:15.300 --> 15:16.300
That would be rad.

15:16.300 --> 15:22.300
That would be so cool on the Wii if they would bring back that old World Championship.

15:22.300 --> 15:23.300
Remember the Nintendo World Championships?

15:23.300 --> 15:26.300
Like I said about five minutes ago.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.300
Sorry.

15:27.300 --> 15:28.300
The online leaderboards.

15:28.300 --> 15:31.300
That's exactly what I said five minutes ago.

15:31.300 --> 15:32.300
Were you not paying attention?

15:32.300 --> 15:33.300
I guess not.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.300
God.

15:34.300 --> 15:38.300
I was thinking about Panorama Cotton.

15:38.300 --> 15:41.300
Maybe they'd eventually finish Robotech Crystal Dreams.

15:41.300 --> 15:42.300
All right.

15:42.300 --> 15:43.300
But yeah.

15:43.300 --> 15:46.300
Well, what import game did you want?

15:46.300 --> 15:49.980
I have one to piss off the fans, and I don't really care to see this over here, because

15:49.980 --> 15:53.500
I don't get the point of it, but Mother 3.

15:53.500 --> 15:54.500
There you go.

15:54.500 --> 15:55.900
You ain't getting it ever.

15:55.900 --> 15:58.300
Actually, you can get the UK one and play it translated.

15:58.300 --> 16:02.700
But I had a story, too.

16:02.700 --> 16:06.300
We have a wireless classic controller for the GameCube.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.300
Okay.

16:07.300 --> 16:12.300
Oh, no, it's for the Wii, but it's by Thrustmaster, which has the best name ever.

16:12.300 --> 16:13.300
Thrustmaster.

16:13.300 --> 16:15.300
Is that the name of the controller?

16:15.300 --> 16:16.300
Thrustmaster?

16:16.300 --> 16:18.300
No, the company that's putting it out is Thrustmaster.

16:18.300 --> 16:22.300
That sounds like something Suzanne Somers would be selling with the Thighmaster, Thrustmaster.

16:22.300 --> 16:24.300
That sounds like a bad porn.

16:24.300 --> 16:29.300
Instead of Beastmaster, you have Thrustmaster, Beastialitymaster, or something.

16:29.300 --> 16:31.300
I don't know.

16:31.300 --> 16:34.300
Thrustmaster just sounds like bad porn.

16:34.300 --> 16:35.300
Okay.

16:35.300 --> 16:37.300
Good times.

16:37.300 --> 16:38.300
Anyways.

16:38.300 --> 16:44.300
So, here's another thing I don't understand about that wireless virtual console controller.

16:44.300 --> 16:49.300
Why they don't have it where that it can be also a GameCube controller, as well.

16:49.300 --> 16:53.300
Why don't they release something like that for the Wii, so that you can use one controller

16:53.300 --> 16:56.300
for virtual console and for GameCube games?

16:56.300 --> 16:58.300
That's what you need to do.

16:58.300 --> 17:00.300
Make it happen, people.

17:00.300 --> 17:07.300
Anyways, one thing that certain parents don't want to happen, much like me, is the Wii Zapper.

17:07.300 --> 17:12.300
Which is the most retarded thing on the face of the earth, I swear to God.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.300
Why the hate?

17:14.300 --> 17:15.300
Why the hate?

17:15.300 --> 17:16.300
It's stupid.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.300
It's a piece of plastic.

17:17.300 --> 17:18.300
You don't need it.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.300
And it does not enhance your games, and I will prove it to you when it comes out.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.300
That's right.

17:21.300 --> 17:22.300
You might owe me a date.

17:22.300 --> 17:24.300
I will not owe you a date at all.

17:24.300 --> 17:26.300
What was I supposed to give you if you win?

17:26.300 --> 17:27.300
I don't remember.

17:27.300 --> 17:28.300
You were supposed to...

17:28.300 --> 17:30.300
Oh, I have to take Nelly off your hands for a night.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.300
Yeah.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.300
That's what it was.

17:32.300 --> 17:38.700
Anywho, so it has been announced officially that it is going to come out in November on

17:38.700 --> 17:46.500
the 19th, I believe, and it's going to feature, hooray, Zelda's crossbow training, which is

17:46.500 --> 17:56.160
going to be, I guess, exactly like the crossbow training that was in Twilight Princess, hooray.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.580
So yeah, all for 20 bucks.

17:58.580 --> 18:03.780
But there's some Jersey parents, though, that are kind of a little pissed off, describing

18:03.780 --> 18:11.900
it as a gun-like remote, a wand in the shape of a weapon, and they don't want to happen.

18:11.900 --> 18:12.900
Great.

18:12.900 --> 18:13.900
This is what we need.

18:13.900 --> 18:17.740
Children with guns learning how to aim and shoot.

18:17.740 --> 18:22.380
Then we can sit back and wonder what is happening to our country with kids killing kids.

18:22.380 --> 18:24.460
What's next?

18:24.460 --> 18:26.220
First off, that doesn't look like a gun.

18:26.220 --> 18:29.380
I don't know what kind of guns are out there in the market, but I'm pretty sure none of

18:29.380 --> 18:31.660
them look like the Wii Zapper.

18:31.660 --> 18:38.220
Second of all, there have been gun attachments for games for a long-ass time now.

18:38.220 --> 18:43.140
And third, you don't have to buy it for your fucking kids, you moron.

18:43.140 --> 18:46.940
Not that you can't play the no-shooter games without the attachment.

18:46.940 --> 18:52.020
Here's my problem with this, is that these parental groups are about 20 years late.

18:52.020 --> 18:54.420
Because remember the NES Zapper?

18:54.420 --> 18:55.420
Hello?

18:55.420 --> 18:57.100
That looked like a freaking gun.

18:57.100 --> 19:03.500
I mean, not like a handgun, but that looked way more like a gun.

19:03.500 --> 19:04.500
What was the one on Sega?

19:04.500 --> 19:07.740
That was the Master System gun was based off the Zillion gun.

19:07.740 --> 19:10.140
Okay, that thing looked like a real gun.

19:10.140 --> 19:11.940
And hello, the Super Scope?

19:11.940 --> 19:12.940
The Enforcer?

19:12.940 --> 19:16.220
The Super Scope was a freaking bazooka that you put on your shoulder.

19:16.220 --> 19:19.660
You remember the lethal enforcers guns that looked like six shooters?

19:19.660 --> 19:25.380
Even though they were red and pink and blue, they were still in full-on gun shape.

19:25.380 --> 19:26.660
I love the Super Scope.

19:26.660 --> 19:29.340
Why the fuck didn't the Super Scope do better?

19:29.340 --> 19:32.460
It's because there were no good freaking games for it.

19:32.460 --> 19:37.140
But I mean, it was a goddamn bazooka that you got to play with.

19:37.140 --> 19:38.140
I love my Super Scope.

19:38.140 --> 19:39.140
That's how you win at the competition.

19:39.140 --> 19:40.140
Oh, we have a gun.

19:40.140 --> 19:41.140
Well, we have a fucking bazooka.

19:41.140 --> 19:42.140
Top that shit.

19:42.140 --> 19:45.300
Nintendo's like, look, we'll whip it out, ours is bigger.

19:45.300 --> 19:47.300
And then Sega's like, well, we have a half bazooka.

19:47.300 --> 19:49.740
They call it the Menacer.

19:49.740 --> 19:52.580
So yeah, we also had the Activator and we know how well that went.

19:52.580 --> 19:57.740
So now parents are all getting pissed off at this Wii Zapper thing, which looks nothing

19:57.740 --> 19:58.740
like a gun.

19:58.740 --> 20:02.620
I mean, seriously, I mean, it looks kind of like it's like a gun shaped cookie cutter

20:02.620 --> 20:03.620
or something.

20:03.620 --> 20:04.620
I don't know how to explain it.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.580
If it was a gun, it would be a Tron prop.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.660
It's as much of a gun as a banana is a gun, okay?

20:09.660 --> 20:11.900
That's seriously the Wii Zapper.

20:11.900 --> 20:15.940
Ooh, I like this comment from Rama in chat, chat.orangelsready.com.

20:15.940 --> 20:21.100
Rama says this, it simply amuses me that about 20 years ago when Nintendo first introduced

20:21.100 --> 20:24.900
the Zapper, the same soccer moms and dads that are protesting against it were playing

20:24.900 --> 20:27.140
these light gun games on the original NES.

20:27.140 --> 20:30.940
If that's not the biggest form of hypocrisy, I don't know what is, but hey, that's just

20:30.940 --> 20:31.940
me.

20:31.940 --> 20:34.980
Here's something, it's all these fucking parental guidance groups, they fucking see

20:34.980 --> 20:39.300
a little headline or get like tipped off on something and then they go ballistic about

20:39.300 --> 20:43.980
it without actually using no said item or even knowing anything about it.

20:43.980 --> 20:47.380
I mean, they're pissed off at Bully when they knew, oh my God, it's a game with bullies

20:47.380 --> 20:48.380
in it.

20:48.380 --> 20:50.020
Oh, hate, hate, hate.

20:50.020 --> 20:54.180
And then, you know, they didn't know what the hell the game was and it was like kind

20:54.180 --> 21:01.300
of promoting against bullying people and it's just, all you have to know is you don't need

21:01.300 --> 21:05.340
to listen to these people and nothing they ever do ever works anyway.

21:05.340 --> 21:08.220
Has their banning of, you know, games worked?

21:08.220 --> 21:09.220
No.

21:09.220 --> 21:11.380
Has, you know, it hurt anybody's sales?

21:11.380 --> 21:12.380
No.

21:12.380 --> 21:13.380
Is it given...

21:13.380 --> 21:14.380
Has it helped sales?

21:14.380 --> 21:15.380
Has it given more publicity and stuff?

21:15.380 --> 21:16.380
Yes, it has.

21:16.380 --> 21:19.740
So, they are actually helping the sale of this stuff, you morons.

21:19.740 --> 21:21.620
Escapist has a good question in chat, too.

21:21.620 --> 21:25.300
Why aren't they protesting Big Buck Hunter, those deer hunting games in the front of every

21:25.300 --> 21:26.300
wall?

21:26.300 --> 21:30.500
Or how about why aren't they protesting Time Crisis 4, which looks more like a gun than

21:30.500 --> 21:31.500
this thing?

21:31.500 --> 21:35.180
Oh, but it's because the Wii, the Wii is a system for kids.

21:35.180 --> 21:38.060
No it's not, you morons, seriously.

21:38.060 --> 21:41.740
Thank God these crazies are in the minority, at least I hope so.

21:41.740 --> 21:45.180
Those of you listening might notice that the rant levels seem to have gone through the

21:45.180 --> 21:49.980
roof on this story, and y'all know what that means.

21:49.980 --> 21:57.220
It's time for the FUs of the Week.

21:57.220 --> 22:01.060
Dark Sakura.

22:01.060 --> 22:03.380
My FU of the Week has to go...

22:03.380 --> 22:07.360
I wouldn't really say so much towards Play N' See, but has to go toward my copy of Guild

22:07.360 --> 22:08.360
Wars.

22:08.360 --> 22:12.400
Because I've been playing on the demo for a little while and I finally decided to open

22:12.400 --> 22:16.460
my box and install it on my PC, since I don't have World of War... not on my PC, but on

22:16.460 --> 22:19.420
my laptop, since I don't have World of Warcraft installed on here.

22:19.420 --> 22:22.700
And until I have my PC rebuilt, I'm just gonna stop paying for my World of Warcraft account.

22:22.700 --> 22:26.460
So I was like, Guild Wars is free, I already have a character, I have a free box.

22:26.460 --> 22:33.220
So I go to peel off the sticker so I can scratch off my ID, my access key, and the access key

22:33.220 --> 22:34.220
peels off with it.

22:34.220 --> 22:35.220
Oh no.

22:35.220 --> 22:36.780
A lot of it did.

22:36.780 --> 22:38.380
And I was like, well shit.

22:38.380 --> 22:43.900
So Heather, bless her, she helped me, she got me my ID from my birthday.

22:43.900 --> 22:47.500
I know, and I'm finally installing it.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.900
And I've gone through all of that time, upgrading my Guild Wars and everything and downloading

22:50.900 --> 22:56.860
all the patches, which has so much better of a patch function than World of Warcraft

22:56.860 --> 22:59.380
could ever imagine having.

22:59.380 --> 23:05.060
It downloads them all at once, instead of download me, download me, download me, but

23:05.060 --> 23:07.020
anyway that's another story.

23:07.020 --> 23:14.260
So I do have to say though that to play MC's credit, they are very fast in the response.

23:14.260 --> 23:20.820
I sent in my request, I'd have to say around 7 o'clock on Thursday, I had a response within

23:20.820 --> 23:21.820
an hour.

23:21.820 --> 23:24.820
I had a second response 30 minutes after that.

23:24.820 --> 23:28.700
Friday I got two more responses telling me that they were forwarding it to a different

23:28.700 --> 23:29.700
party.

23:29.700 --> 23:32.740
They were keeping me informed at every step of the way, and that's really good customer

23:32.740 --> 23:33.740
service.

23:33.740 --> 23:39.380
So, at the end of the disc, but a thank you goes to play MC, except for being closed on

23:39.380 --> 23:40.380
the weekend.

23:40.380 --> 23:41.380
The end.

23:41.380 --> 23:42.380
Alright.

23:42.380 --> 23:47.580
Anyways, uh, fuck you to Stars in Vacaville.

23:47.580 --> 23:54.380
My god is that a whole bunch of ghetto wrapped into one ugly ass building, and, you know,

23:54.380 --> 23:58.700
Qsar has really gone downhill there, as well as everything else there, their employees

23:58.700 --> 24:03.700
don't give a shit, and I don't give a shit either, and I will not be coming back.

24:03.700 --> 24:12.380
And that's saying a lot because the next Qsar is fucking 45 minutes away from that, so.

24:12.380 --> 24:13.380
My turn?

24:13.380 --> 24:14.380
Yeah.

24:14.380 --> 24:17.540
Um, I'll have to give an FU to the waffle place I ate breakfast at today.

24:17.540 --> 24:22.180
Now don't get me wrong, waffles are awesome, like waffles are God's food, okay?

24:22.180 --> 24:23.180
Waffles are like the best thing ever.

24:23.180 --> 24:26.180
I mean, can anybody think of a better food than waffles?

24:26.180 --> 24:27.180
No?

24:27.180 --> 24:28.180
Didn't think so.

24:28.180 --> 24:29.180
Two waffles!

24:29.180 --> 24:30.180
Yes, two waffles!

24:30.180 --> 24:31.180
Cornmeal pancakes.

24:31.180 --> 24:32.980
Here's the thing though.

24:32.980 --> 24:37.400
I did have a pretty odd, well here's the reason why I give the place an FU is because they

24:37.400 --> 24:40.380
didn't have a peanut butter waffle on their menu.

24:40.380 --> 24:46.300
Like the competing waffle shop across town has a peanut butter waffle that I'm very used

24:46.300 --> 24:50.620
to and I love that, and they don't have any type of peanut butter related waffle on menus.

24:50.620 --> 24:51.620
That's why they get an FU.

24:51.620 --> 24:54.460
However, they do redeem themselves, you know why?

24:54.460 --> 24:57.940
Because they do have a waffle that has bacon inside it.

24:57.940 --> 25:00.180
It's a bacon waffle.

25:00.180 --> 25:03.540
So the only thing better than a waffle, a bacon waffle?

25:03.540 --> 25:07.900
No, I beg to differ, that's really gross because it makes me look greasy.

25:07.900 --> 25:09.620
That sounds awesome.

25:09.620 --> 25:12.700
It was awesome, Loki, I can't even describe.

25:12.700 --> 25:13.700
So there you go.

25:13.700 --> 25:15.700
Hey, guess what I get to do in a month.

25:15.700 --> 25:16.700
What?

25:16.700 --> 25:17.700
I get to go eat at a waffle house.

25:17.700 --> 25:18.700
Well, actually two months.

25:18.700 --> 25:22.600
Like a legitimate, you know I've never eaten at an actual waffle house, but I'm worried

25:22.600 --> 25:26.300
that if I do, it will ruin my impression of waffle.

25:26.300 --> 25:27.300
Waffles everywhere.

25:27.300 --> 25:32.140
Well, the thing about Waffle House, and all of our East Coast and Southern listeners will

25:32.140 --> 25:36.340
know this, is that Waffle House isn't just about the waffles, which really aren't that

25:36.340 --> 25:38.580
fantastic.

25:38.580 --> 25:43.320
It's just about being at a fucking waffle house, and they have the best coffee ever,

25:43.320 --> 25:47.980
and the best hash browns ever, because you can get them smothered, covered, chunked,

25:47.980 --> 25:53.300
cheese, everything on it, and I was like, ah, sexy, but I went to Waffle House and I

25:53.300 --> 25:57.500
came back with a hat, and they wouldn't sell me a cup, because I wanted a big coffee mug

25:57.500 --> 26:01.020
that said Waffle House on it.

26:01.020 --> 26:04.340
And just to let people know, I'm going to Alabama in November.

26:04.340 --> 26:09.300
I will be doing my usual cyber station in Mobile, Alabama run, because I used to work

26:09.300 --> 26:14.380
at that freaking arcade, and I hate it, but I will be there.

26:14.380 --> 26:17.420
So are you going to go, do they have an ultracade machine there?

26:17.420 --> 26:18.420
I don't remember.

26:18.420 --> 26:21.900
They had a busted up DDR last time I was there, but that was the first place I played Tekken

26:21.900 --> 26:22.900
5.

26:22.900 --> 26:26.260
So will you, if they have an ultracade machine, will you be doing your ceremonial trip to

26:26.260 --> 26:27.700
the arcade to kick the ultracade machine?

26:27.700 --> 26:29.740
Yes, I will be kicking an ultracade.

26:29.740 --> 26:30.740
I will also be...

26:30.740 --> 26:32.860
What if they don't have an ultracade, what will you kick?

26:32.860 --> 26:37.980
I will be kicking the smoking token, because it used to fucking break all the time, and

26:37.980 --> 26:44.220
that bump and jump game, I hate that one too, but the thing about me going to cyber station

26:44.220 --> 26:49.500
is that any new Namco arcade game that comes out, all the Namco arcades get it first, so

26:49.500 --> 26:54.140
that's why I was in such a big tizzy to get to that one when I went a few years ago, so

26:54.140 --> 27:01.220
I could go play Tekken 5, because they got it a couple of months before golf landed.

27:01.220 --> 27:07.840
But I will not be going to New Orleans, sorry, that's too much of a drive, I may be in Biloxi.

27:07.840 --> 27:11.900
I will be in Dothan, Alabama, and I will probably stop at the tilt for about five minutes and

27:11.900 --> 27:13.860
leave, because that arcade...

27:13.860 --> 27:16.140
To also kick a machine of your choosing.

27:16.140 --> 27:20.100
If the tilt is closed, I don't know if it's still at the mall.

27:20.100 --> 27:23.060
Hopefully a listener will know and can email us, but I was going to say, someday when we're

27:23.060 --> 27:28.260
rock stars, that should be how we go out on tour to promote things, is we should set up

27:28.260 --> 27:31.340
a time in an arcade for everybody to meet us there, and everybody can gather around

27:31.340 --> 27:33.740
a machine, and then we all walk in and kick it and leave.

27:33.740 --> 27:42.860
I did go to a DDR tourney, and this is when we already had Max, but their newest DDR machine

27:42.860 --> 27:46.260
that they had at this arcade in...

27:46.260 --> 27:51.140
I want to say it was at the Beaux-Rivage, this is of course before Katrina hit, was

27:51.140 --> 27:55.060
a fifth mix, and I went to meet up with people there.

27:55.060 --> 27:57.060
This is a few years ago.

27:57.060 --> 28:02.500
Made some cool friends too, but just also to let people know while I'm thinking about

28:02.500 --> 28:06.340
it, there's not going to be any more pump up the volume until I get my computer replaced.

28:06.340 --> 28:12.100
My computer died a lot, so I'm done.

28:12.100 --> 28:14.100
Ready to hear it.

28:14.100 --> 28:21.380
Well, we got through our FUs of the Week, minorly unscathed.

28:21.380 --> 28:25.140
Are there any other traveling anybody's doing this year that should be noted?

28:25.140 --> 28:26.140
I don't know.

28:26.140 --> 28:27.300
I know where I'm not going.

28:27.300 --> 28:28.300
Where are you not going?

28:28.300 --> 28:30.460
I'm not going to E for All.

28:30.460 --> 28:31.460
Why is that?

28:31.460 --> 28:32.460
I still kind of want to go for E for All.

28:32.460 --> 28:35.340
I have the week off work, but why is it that you don't want to go?

28:35.340 --> 28:39.300
Because, it's like everybody's canceled, and it's also in LA, and also the wife probably

28:39.300 --> 28:40.300
wouldn't let me anyways.

28:40.300 --> 28:43.020
The wife's not going to permit you to go?

28:43.020 --> 28:46.340
Well, you know, it's a long ways away.

28:46.340 --> 28:49.900
If it were in San Francisco or something like that, that would be a little different.

28:49.900 --> 28:56.420
But eight hours away for something that's progressively getting worse?

28:56.420 --> 28:57.420
I don't know.

28:57.420 --> 28:58.420
Not for me.

28:58.420 --> 28:59.420
We'll see.

28:59.420 --> 29:05.460
I kind of want to go to network and see who I can meet and what have you, but we'll see.

29:05.460 --> 29:08.700
Anyhow, there is a brand new version of Winamp coming out.

29:08.700 --> 29:12.220
A lot of you guys left Winamp behind when you switched to iTunes to run with your iPod.

29:12.220 --> 29:14.220
No, I don't touch that iTunes shit.

29:14.220 --> 29:15.700
I've flipped off iTunes.

29:15.700 --> 29:18.340
In the internet, a lot of folks did.

29:18.340 --> 29:23.580
Now, we use Winamp to do this show and everything, but there is Winamp coming out.

29:23.580 --> 29:27.900
A new version is coming out, and here's the cool thing about it, because they obviously

29:27.900 --> 29:31.700
want people to go back to Winamp, folks that ditched them for iTunes.

29:31.700 --> 29:32.700
Here's the thing.

29:32.700 --> 29:39.540
A new version of Winamp will stream songs to your consoles, such as the Nintendo Wii.

29:39.540 --> 29:43.300
So a new version of Winamp, it's the 10th anniversary edition, and it's going to stream

29:43.300 --> 29:44.300
to your consoles.

29:44.300 --> 29:45.820
Pretty rad.

29:45.820 --> 29:50.580
I'm not sure exactly how it works yet, but I'm sure we will see more when the release

29:50.580 --> 29:53.900
of this comes out, which I'm not sure exactly when it's supposed to.

29:53.900 --> 29:57.540
I haven't seen a date on it, but I imagine it's later this year.

29:57.540 --> 29:58.540
That's pretty cool.

29:58.540 --> 30:02.660
And I was going to remind the chat room, because it's been a while since we talked about the

30:02.660 --> 30:03.900
whole UltraCade thing.

30:03.900 --> 30:08.460
The reason why you're supposed to kick an UltraCade machine is because at one time,

30:08.460 --> 30:13.460
well, other than the fact that it sucks, at one time the company that owns UltraCade tried

30:13.460 --> 30:20.460
to register a trademark for, or copyright or something, for MAME, and that's why, even

30:20.460 --> 30:22.740
though they didn't make any of that.

30:22.740 --> 30:27.500
It was this big legal nightmare, but UltraCade sucks anyway.

30:27.500 --> 30:36.060
So this is, I guess, new news there, but old news for us, really, because we've had DDR

30:36.060 --> 30:42.060
in schools for a long time, is over in the UK, they're using Dancing Stage, which is

30:42.060 --> 30:53.100
the version of Dance Dance Revolution over there, to combat childhood obesity.

30:53.100 --> 30:59.940
There are trials that are done in Bedfordshire schools to see if people will play that, but

30:59.940 --> 31:06.820
they're targeting it towards girls who don't want to play sports, especially competitive

31:06.820 --> 31:07.820
sports.

31:07.820 --> 31:12.100
So it's basically to help increase activities going on at school, and I think that's pretty

31:12.100 --> 31:14.100
cool.

31:14.100 --> 31:18.700
I mean, I played DDR for a long time, and it's activity.

31:18.700 --> 31:20.260
Activity is activity.

31:20.260 --> 31:21.260
Definitely.

31:21.260 --> 31:27.300
Let's see here, I was going to say, there's a brand new, of course we played a little

31:27.300 --> 31:33.900
bit, if you were listening to us live during the break, a brand new album coming out from

31:33.900 --> 31:41.260
OC Remix, and it's Lifestream, a tribute album to Final Fantasy VII, or Voices of the Lifestream,

31:41.260 --> 31:42.260
I should say.

31:42.260 --> 31:50.700
It is four discs, huge, completely free, there's a 2.32 gigabyte torrent for it available,

31:50.700 --> 31:55.660
and it's split up, I guess, into their four different universes, Crisis Core, Jurge of

31:55.660 --> 32:03.140
Service, Advent Children in Last Order, and features a bunch of awesome music, 45 tracks

32:03.140 --> 32:08.740
including, and features the work of 42 different remixers.

32:08.740 --> 32:11.020
So freaking awesome.

32:11.020 --> 32:12.020
Download it now.

32:12.020 --> 32:15.380
Yeah, we'll actually play a couple clips here, just some real quick clips here on the show,

32:15.380 --> 32:18.780
so you can hear what some of this, this is one we played during the break, this is a

32:18.780 --> 32:23.860
Jenova remix, called Jenova Celestial by Blind.

32:23.860 --> 32:41.980
I like that, it's all like techno-y and stuff, and there's a Chocobo remix called Que, Electric

32:41.980 --> 32:57.620
De Chocobo, which is by an artist named Durangin, here's a little clip.

32:57.620 --> 33:02.180
And one more clip we'll play for you guys, this is a song that's a compilation from Norg

33:02.180 --> 33:03.180
and Snappleman.

33:03.180 --> 33:23.980
They came together to do this one called Full Frontal Assault, pretty rad.

33:23.980 --> 33:30.240
So it's free on their site, so pretty cool.

33:30.240 --> 33:33.500
Maybe I'll play something on the Xbox 360 and use that as a custom soundtrack, that

33:33.500 --> 33:34.500
might be kind of fun.

33:34.500 --> 33:38.180
Play like Blue Dragon and use that as a custom soundtrack, who knows.

33:38.180 --> 33:41.900
Anyhow, one game that you don't use custom soundtracks for though is Guitar Hero 3, and

33:41.900 --> 33:45.820
certainly it seems like every week we're hearing about some new songs in the game.

33:45.820 --> 33:51.220
Well get this, if a recent post on Score Hero that came up and then was taken down not even

33:51.220 --> 33:56.420
two minutes later is to be believed, the full song list for Guitar Hero 3 has leaked.

33:56.420 --> 33:59.640
The whole fact that it was up and then taken down right away certainly seems to make it

33:59.640 --> 34:05.100
look like it was removed, and you'll have to forgive me because I don't remember exactly

34:05.100 --> 34:08.660
what has been announced and what's not, but I do notice some interesting stuff here.

34:08.660 --> 34:12.860
I remember that Tom Morello was announced as a boss, but Rage Against the Machine has

34:12.860 --> 34:16.620
Bulls On Parade in there, remember that's a pretty awesome guitar song.

34:16.620 --> 34:20.780
And let's see what else caught my eye here, Tenacious D's in there, but I think they were

34:20.780 --> 34:21.780
announced for that before.

34:21.780 --> 34:26.580
Guns N' Roses, Welcome to the Jungle, Aerosmith, same old song and dance, so Aerosmith might

34:26.580 --> 34:30.620
actually be Guitar Hero 3, I know we heard a story last week that they were going to

34:30.620 --> 34:32.140
be a big part of Guitar Hero 4.

34:32.140 --> 34:35.300
I was going to write how Chili Peppers Suck My Kiss.

34:35.300 --> 34:41.660
Yeah, I'm trying to think what else here, oh the Encore Stage, the very last song, you

34:41.660 --> 34:47.780
know how before it was Freebird, now it's going to be The Devil Went Down to Georgia.

34:47.780 --> 34:48.820
Nice.

34:48.820 --> 34:49.820
So that'll be pretty rad.

34:49.820 --> 34:54.900
And I guess, what was this one, it says Boss Lou Guitar Battle?

34:54.900 --> 34:55.900
I don't know.

34:55.900 --> 34:58.220
I don't know who Lou would be.

34:58.220 --> 35:01.900
Let's see here, they were saying...

35:01.900 --> 35:02.900
Lou Reed maybe?

35:02.900 --> 35:03.900
I don't know.

35:03.900 --> 35:06.020
Disturbed, stricken, that's kind of cool before I forget.

35:06.020 --> 35:07.020
Where does it say Lou?

35:07.020 --> 35:08.020
Oh I don't know.

35:08.020 --> 35:10.620
Maybe it's an in-game character, who knows.

35:10.620 --> 35:11.620
Maybe.

35:11.620 --> 35:13.940
I don't know my Guitar Heroes apparently.

35:13.940 --> 35:15.220
I'm trying to see if there's anything else.

35:15.220 --> 35:19.060
But now again, this is a rumored list, so we don't know for sure.

35:19.060 --> 35:22.260
I don't know, it looks pretty official to me.

35:22.260 --> 35:25.620
Yeah, it looks pretty convincing.

35:25.620 --> 35:26.620
We'll see.

35:26.620 --> 35:28.620
I mean, the game's out, what?

35:28.620 --> 35:29.620
Next month?

35:29.620 --> 35:31.620
It's the end of next month, the 31st.

35:31.620 --> 35:32.620
Halloween!

35:32.620 --> 35:33.620
Halloween!

35:33.620 --> 35:37.260
I think they'll actually know it, I take that back, the 28th is when it's coming out, Sunday.

35:37.260 --> 35:40.660
Oh, they're doing a weekend release because they can.

35:40.660 --> 35:44.940
Anyhow, we're going to do the Mailbag segment now, because we can.

35:44.940 --> 35:48.060
That's what we want to do, and every week you guys send us emails, and Dark Sakura picks

35:48.060 --> 35:52.580
a few of her favorites and reads them live, on air, and then makes fun of them as well,

35:52.580 --> 35:54.620
when she feels like it.

35:54.620 --> 35:57.460
The mailbag at orangesonsrated.com is the place to send those emails.

35:57.460 --> 35:58.460
So open up the mailbag!

35:58.460 --> 36:01.460
Dive in, Dark Sakura, what's in there?

36:01.460 --> 36:04.620
Hello guys, what's up?

36:04.620 --> 36:08.700
This is Foodie Monster from Argentina, and this is probably my first email to you guys.

36:08.700 --> 36:12.100
Anyway, I won't make it long since I've been known to call into the show a few times, so

36:12.100 --> 36:15.540
I'm not scared of the Skypline to make any long-winded rants.

36:15.540 --> 36:19.780
The reason to this email is to send you guys a picture of the game drawn to life for the

36:19.780 --> 36:20.780
DS.

36:20.780 --> 36:24.660
I believe you guys don't know this game, which got released on September 11th, I believe,

36:24.660 --> 36:25.660
so it's new.

36:25.660 --> 36:29.500
It's a cutesy game, and would be well-defined as a weird hybrid between Zelda Adventure

36:29.500 --> 36:30.500
Island, Mario, and Sonic.

36:30.500 --> 36:33.540
Yes, I know it all seems to be all over the place.

36:33.540 --> 36:37.860
Anyway, the point is that the gimmick of this game is that you basically draw everything,

36:37.860 --> 36:42.980
and not just lines, no, I mean full-blown things, from clouds you step on, to the slug

36:42.980 --> 36:47.640
you ride on on one of the levels, to the gun you wield, to the main character.

36:47.640 --> 36:50.980
And that's what I wanted to show you guys, in the pictures that I've attached, I made

36:50.980 --> 36:56.500
one of OLR's, and Jamie's favorite, a playable character, a cute Pyramid Head.

36:56.500 --> 36:59.700
The pictures do speak for themselves, and it shows the way you can show the listeners

36:59.700 --> 37:00.700
as well.

37:00.700 --> 37:04.540
Maybe point the Operator 11 camera at the computer screen or something.

37:04.540 --> 37:05.540
Too late, Op11 died.

37:05.540 --> 37:08.900
But I thought it was pretty funny, especially when the town's mayor says, oh, Pyramid H,

37:08.900 --> 37:10.900
go to rescue little Miwa.

37:10.900 --> 37:14.860
The whole time I pictured a Pyramid Head ripping said little girl to shreds with a giant meat

37:14.860 --> 37:16.860
cleaver, and that made me LOL.

37:16.860 --> 37:20.300
Anyways, I'll wrap this up and let you guys continue through the mailbag.

37:20.300 --> 37:22.300
Take care and keep up the great work as usual.

37:22.300 --> 37:23.540
Oh, that's cute.

37:23.540 --> 37:24.540
Here's the little Pyramid Head.

37:24.540 --> 37:28.540
I'm looking, I peeked in the mailbag as well to pull out the pictures.

37:28.540 --> 37:29.540
That is cute.

37:29.540 --> 37:33.260
And this is great radio, but maybe Footy, I think it's Footy's in chat tonight, so maybe

37:33.260 --> 37:34.260
he can share.

37:34.260 --> 37:35.260
Oh yeah, he just posted his photo bucket there.

37:35.260 --> 37:36.260
Thank you, Footy.

37:36.260 --> 37:37.260
Thank you.

37:37.260 --> 37:38.260
That was awesome radio.

37:38.260 --> 37:39.260
By the way, pictures make for great radio.

37:39.260 --> 37:40.260
That is the cutest thing ever.

37:40.260 --> 37:41.260
Look at that.

37:41.260 --> 37:42.260
Oh my God, he's adorable.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.260
I want one.

37:43.260 --> 37:44.260
I want my Pyramid Headie.

37:44.260 --> 37:49.100
Pea Headie, Pea Headie, Pea Headie.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.100
We call him Pea Headie.

37:50.100 --> 37:52.100
I'm going to look at the other picture.

37:52.100 --> 37:55.260
Oh my God, he's so cute.

37:55.260 --> 38:00.540
Okay, so moving on.

38:00.540 --> 38:09.580
So from Gray Fox, we have an email.

38:09.580 --> 38:13.100
Hello LLR gang, I've been listening to your podcast for a couple of months now and would

38:13.100 --> 38:14.420
like to say that I love your show.

38:14.420 --> 38:18.660
I agree with many others who have commented that it is hilarious interactions between

38:18.660 --> 38:21.100
all three of you that make this show unique.

38:21.100 --> 38:25.020
I had about a four year hiatus of gaming because of being enrolled in university and did not

38:25.020 --> 38:27.100
have much time for video games.

38:27.100 --> 38:30.940
Now that I have graduated, I have more time to play, so I got myself a PS2 slimline and

38:30.940 --> 38:31.940
I'm loving it so far.

38:31.940 --> 38:38.340
I was wondering if it were possible to have a section on the show dedicated to great last

38:38.340 --> 38:39.340
gen games.

38:39.340 --> 38:43.220
I find there are many people who cannot afford to get involved in the next gen gaming and

38:43.220 --> 38:48.880
there are still many great games, Metal Gear Solid Series, God of War, Viewtiful Joe, etc.

38:48.880 --> 38:53.800
Right now I rely on IGN for my game recommendations, but I am afraid that some games might still

38:53.800 --> 38:55.860
be great but get a lower score.

38:55.860 --> 38:56.860
Any help would be great.

38:56.860 --> 38:58.900
Keep up the good work.

38:58.900 --> 39:07.660
I would suggest for good PS2 games, definitely the Metal Gear series.

39:07.660 --> 39:13.260
I was always a big fan of the Tekken games because I love my fighting games a whole lot.

39:13.260 --> 39:15.780
I'm a big Namco nerd.

39:15.780 --> 39:20.500
Klonoa 2 was a really, really, really good PS2 game.

39:20.500 --> 39:24.340
It got really hard toward the end, but it was a really good game.

39:24.340 --> 39:27.740
It kind of makes you think, if you're going to pick up a platformer, I suggest Klonoa

39:27.740 --> 39:28.740
2.

39:28.740 --> 39:29.740
Guys?

39:29.740 --> 39:33.900
I don't know, but Klonoa 2, I mean it's a good, it's okay a game I guess.

39:33.900 --> 39:38.100
As far as the last gen game goes, I mean they're still making some good stuff for PlayStation

39:38.100 --> 39:39.100
2.

39:39.100 --> 39:42.260
Like Final Fantasy XII came out amongst all the new consoles and kind of got lost, but

39:42.260 --> 39:44.260
it's a freaking great RPG.

39:44.260 --> 39:49.820
And I know a lot of folks in chat have been yapping about Persona 3, which is also supposed

39:49.820 --> 39:50.820
to be a really good one.

39:50.820 --> 39:51.820
I still need to play the demo.

39:51.820 --> 39:52.820
I've been busy.

39:52.820 --> 39:53.820
Yeah, I know.

39:53.820 --> 39:56.980
I want to play the full game at some point, but just, you know, there's so many games

39:56.980 --> 39:58.580
out there to play right now.

39:58.580 --> 40:02.900
So certainly PS2 still has a bunch of crack going out for it.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.980
And you know, I still, I even want to go way back to some of the games that were released

40:05.980 --> 40:06.980
earlier on.

40:06.980 --> 40:10.860
I still want to catch up on the.hack series, because I actually enjoy the games, the little

40:10.860 --> 40:11.860
bits I played of them.

40:11.860 --> 40:13.380
There's just, you know, a lot to them.

40:13.380 --> 40:17.280
So ironically enough, we talked about in part 8 tonight, Jamie's going to have a classic

40:17.280 --> 40:20.980
game of the week segment, so maybe once in a while he can have a PS2 game or something

40:20.980 --> 40:21.980
in there.

40:21.980 --> 40:22.980
Oh, you know what?

40:22.980 --> 40:23.980
Space Channel 5.

40:23.980 --> 40:24.980
Ooh, good times.

40:24.980 --> 40:27.300
They did a double release of 1 and 2.

40:27.300 --> 40:28.300
Why not get that?

40:28.300 --> 40:29.300
That's fun.

40:29.300 --> 40:30.300
Parappa 2?

40:30.300 --> 40:33.740
Yeah, Parappa 2 is really fun.

40:33.740 --> 40:36.140
Mojib Ribbon, if you're into the import.

40:36.140 --> 40:37.140
If you can get it.

40:37.140 --> 40:39.140
NCSX still sells it.

40:39.140 --> 40:43.260
You know, you've got your 2DX, your DDR.

40:43.260 --> 40:45.180
There's tons of good stuff on PS2.

40:45.180 --> 40:46.180
Rez.

40:46.180 --> 40:47.180
Rez.

40:47.180 --> 40:48.180
Oh yes, Rez.

40:48.180 --> 40:49.180
Good job.

40:49.180 --> 40:50.180
Amplitude.

40:50.180 --> 40:51.180
Frequency.

40:51.180 --> 40:52.180
Guitar Hero.

40:52.180 --> 40:57.500
Yeah, those prequels to, or you could say to what ended up being Guitar Hero.

40:57.500 --> 40:58.500
Yeah.

40:58.500 --> 40:59.500
Cool.

40:59.500 --> 41:00.500
Yes.

41:00.500 --> 41:01.500
I am moving forward.

41:01.500 --> 41:02.500
Prepare to fast-forward.

41:02.500 --> 41:07.980
Hey, Rob, Jamie, and Matt, it's been a while since I've communicated with you guys, so

41:07.980 --> 41:08.980
I've missed you all.

41:08.980 --> 41:15.260
I'm still unpacking from my move to Brooklyn Studios, but the area I'm at, really awesome.

41:15.260 --> 41:17.500
A few things I'd like to say if you don't mind.

41:17.500 --> 41:21.220
Rob, I know you're not a big fan of anime, but I've heard you go on about how awesome

41:21.220 --> 41:22.220
Blue Dragon is.

41:22.220 --> 41:24.900
In case you haven't heard, there's an anime based on the game now.

41:24.900 --> 41:25.900
Here's my question.

41:25.900 --> 41:29.660
If there was a game that you liked also had an anime to it, would you watch it as well?

41:29.660 --> 41:32.580
Oh, and Jamie, I've seen the first episode, and it's pretty good.

41:32.580 --> 41:33.580
It's a must-see.

41:33.580 --> 41:35.940
I'm gonna have to download that then.

41:35.940 --> 41:38.980
I will say this, so far, sorry, I know the email's not done, but just to get that part

41:38.980 --> 41:45.440
out of the way, I don't think Blue Dragon is like, OMG awesome, but Blue Dragon is better

41:45.440 --> 41:47.980
than a lot of people say it is, I think.

41:47.980 --> 41:51.580
It's just, you know, it's a Super Nintendo RPG with next-gen graphics.

41:51.580 --> 41:52.580
That's what Blue Dragon is.

41:52.580 --> 41:54.660
Take it or leave it.

41:54.660 --> 41:55.660
Would I watch the anime?

41:55.660 --> 41:56.660
Sure.

41:56.660 --> 41:57.660
I've heard it's out there.

41:57.660 --> 41:58.660
I think I've seen it on YouTube.

41:58.660 --> 42:00.340
I just haven't sat down to watch it.

42:00.340 --> 42:03.900
But I did watch an episode of Final Fantasy Unlimited just because I liked Final Fantasy,

42:03.900 --> 42:04.900
so yeah, I've done it.

42:04.900 --> 42:06.180
Final Fantasy Unlimited was a very strange series.

42:06.180 --> 42:10.500
Yeah, it wasn't, yeah, I didn't watch the whole thing, but you know, it's, I will, if

42:10.500 --> 42:11.500
I'm into it enough.

42:11.500 --> 42:13.180
I still need to finish Death Note, okay?

42:13.180 --> 42:14.980
Anyway, Rob, another question.

42:14.980 --> 42:18.180
The New York chapter of the O.L. Army wants to know if you're going to digital life.

42:18.180 --> 42:21.820
I know you said you were thinking about it because you have a credit with JetBlue, but

42:21.820 --> 42:23.220
not much has been said.

42:23.220 --> 42:26.540
Would love it if you came out to New York City again because we all love you.

42:26.540 --> 42:30.180
I thought I'd clarified this on a previous show, but perhaps some folks were out or maybe

42:30.180 --> 42:35.100
I said it on a off-recorded break or something, but unfortunately, due to a conflict, I cannot

42:35.100 --> 42:36.300
make it out there for digital life.

42:36.300 --> 42:38.100
I'm very sorry to the New York folks.

42:38.100 --> 42:41.180
However, you're right, I still have that credit from JetBlue and I've got to use it before

42:41.180 --> 42:45.020
June or it goes away, so you bet you're going to see me out there in the spring for something.

42:45.020 --> 42:46.020
So we'll see.

42:46.020 --> 42:47.020
Okay.

42:47.020 --> 42:48.260
Well, let me move forward.

42:48.260 --> 42:53.660
And by the way, this email is from our Ron Chan in the chat room who always makes me

42:53.660 --> 42:55.660
squee.

42:55.660 --> 43:00.540
So moving forward, speaking of East Coast, no, we've already done that one.

43:00.540 --> 43:01.540
Wait.

43:01.540 --> 43:02.540
Have I done that?

43:02.540 --> 43:03.540
No, I haven't.

43:03.540 --> 43:06.140
Speaking of the East Coast, Rob, you've jokingly said that if we fly at O.L.R. out to a con,

43:06.140 --> 43:07.140
you would all go.

43:07.140 --> 43:11.020
I can't do that, but I can try to get you, Jamie, and Matt to scounce on flights if you

43:11.020 --> 43:15.860
three can come to anime next to local con in Jersey.

43:15.860 --> 43:16.860
He's offering us to stay.

43:16.860 --> 43:19.260
Do you think we could make something like that?

43:19.260 --> 43:20.540
Well, we'll consider.

43:20.540 --> 43:25.440
We do have something, a resource we can tap into to maybe make that happen.

43:25.440 --> 43:27.860
It would just be also, though, our personal calendars.

43:27.860 --> 43:30.860
We also, don't forget, Oren's on Friday, we don't get paid for doing this.

43:30.860 --> 43:31.940
This isn't our jobs.

43:31.940 --> 43:37.540
So we all have jobs and Jamie goes to school, Loki's married, so sometimes our personal

43:37.540 --> 43:40.580
lives keep us at home, not just so much the fact that we're poor.

43:40.580 --> 43:44.420
But we do have a money resource we can tap into and we appreciate the offer.

43:44.420 --> 43:46.300
Here's the thing, though.

43:46.300 --> 43:50.300
If we're going to go to a con and make that kind of trip for it, I just don't want some

43:50.300 --> 43:54.740
like Sunday morning when everybody's packing, because that kind of, you know what I went

43:54.740 --> 43:55.740
through, Rama.

43:55.740 --> 43:58.740
And although I had a good time at the con, don't get me wrong, I was a little disappointed,

43:58.740 --> 44:02.540
you know, that when you get scheduled for such a crap time, when you make that kind

44:02.540 --> 44:06.180
of trip out somewhere, you know, that it's unfortunate.

44:06.180 --> 44:09.220
So I still love you, Rama, mwah, mwah, mwah.

44:09.220 --> 44:11.220
Okay, where was I?

44:11.220 --> 44:15.340
Also, more good news, I've decided not to get a wee now because my friends around me

44:15.340 --> 44:17.220
have one, including my own roommate.

44:17.220 --> 44:19.940
I've decided to get an Xbox 360 instead.

44:19.940 --> 44:23.540
Despite the three year warranty Microsoft has given, I'm opting for the two year replacement

44:23.540 --> 44:27.660
plan because I'd rather spend the extra cash to have it replaced the same day at my local

44:27.660 --> 44:28.660
Best Buy.

44:28.660 --> 44:34.940
I'm planning to purchase it February 08, when they should have the 65nm chips in it.

44:34.940 --> 44:39.060
Now that you all know I'm buying one, I'm really fickle about buying games.

44:39.060 --> 44:43.180
I'd like each of you to recommend one game I should get, but don't suggest Rumble Roses

44:43.180 --> 44:48.260
XX, I'm already planning on buying that.

44:48.260 --> 44:50.260
Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

44:50.260 --> 44:53.020
Somebody's getting a text message.

44:53.020 --> 44:54.260
That's probably sauce.

44:54.260 --> 44:55.820
You can't text message Breakup.

44:55.820 --> 44:57.620
That's probably sauce.

44:57.620 --> 44:59.300
I'm sorry, what was the question?

44:59.300 --> 45:00.300
Cheap Xbox 360 games?

45:00.300 --> 45:04.220
Well, just an Xbox 360 game that you would suggest buying.

45:04.220 --> 45:08.420
Well I know you like RPGs, Rama, so I would say Blue Dragon, or I think, has Enchanted

45:08.420 --> 45:09.900
Arms gotten a price cut yet?

45:09.900 --> 45:11.660
Because Enchanted Arms also wasn't bad.

45:11.660 --> 45:16.340
Enchanted Arms is dirt cheap now, especially if you have a Playstation 3, it's really dirt

45:16.340 --> 45:17.340
cheap.

45:17.340 --> 45:18.340
Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

45:18.340 --> 45:20.980
If you want to try an RPG, opt for Enchanted Arms, it's not as bad as people made it out

45:20.980 --> 45:22.280
to be.

45:22.280 --> 45:25.980
If you can get through the first couple hours, which are a little rough especially, you really

45:25.980 --> 45:26.980
start to get into it.

45:26.980 --> 45:28.740
I don't think it was a bad game.

45:28.740 --> 45:30.020
Again, it wasn't a great game.

45:30.020 --> 45:35.020
I'm still waiting for the freaking great blow your hair back RPG on the Xbox 360, which

45:35.020 --> 45:38.700
I'm hoping is Eternal Sonata, but I shouldn't hold my breath.

45:38.700 --> 45:40.900
Marvel Ultimate Alliance, that's all I have to say.

45:40.900 --> 45:46.460
Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Uno, anyway.

45:46.460 --> 45:49.660
Yeah, don't forget the arcade actually.

45:49.660 --> 45:56.780
Make sure that you get Castlevania, that's also, it looks kind of, actually the Double

45:56.780 --> 46:01.660
Dragon is so funny because it's all high res, and to me, it just doesn't look the same.

46:01.660 --> 46:03.660
It's not as cool to me.

46:03.660 --> 46:08.380
Okay, next part, oh Jamie, I had my house warming last night, I didn't get any Guinness,

46:08.380 --> 46:14.300
I'm sorry, Tear, but we did have other alcoholic beverages and I did a 151 shot for you, which

46:14.300 --> 46:18.340
reminds me of how much I loved hanging out with you at Final Mate, aww, I know I've said

46:18.340 --> 46:21.460
this several times already, but you truly made me feel at home, I can't wait to come

46:21.460 --> 46:24.180
back out there, not to calm, but to relax and have a good time.

46:24.180 --> 46:30.540
Oh, that's so sweet, well definitely, you've got crashing space, definitely have crashing

46:30.540 --> 46:31.540
space.

46:31.540 --> 46:32.540
I'm sorry, what?

46:32.540 --> 46:33.540
Who wants to come back out and hang out?

46:33.540 --> 46:34.540
Oh.

46:34.540 --> 46:35.540
That's cool.

46:35.540 --> 46:36.540
Cool.

46:36.540 --> 46:38.620
Okay, I'm almost done with the email.

46:38.620 --> 46:43.620
Speaking of fun times, all of OLR me is on notice, I will be back for Final Mate 2009

46:43.620 --> 46:48.740
Prior Commitments for 08, and it will be OLR Con, two suites full of OLR fans just going

46:48.740 --> 46:49.740
insane.

46:49.740 --> 46:56.300
Oh, and for the record, the fancy Articulate Guys comment from last week was made by my

46:56.300 --> 46:59.260
friend Patty, not by me, and she rocks hard.

46:59.260 --> 47:01.220
Do you remember you commented on that, Rob?

47:01.220 --> 47:04.900
I remember there was the fancy- Articulate Guys.

47:04.900 --> 47:08.740
Alright, whatever, yeah, I'm just starting to get warm, I'm going to have to open the

47:08.740 --> 47:09.740
door pretty soon.

47:09.740 --> 47:14.820
I believe that's it for now, I had more topics to comment on, but I forgot what I was going

47:14.820 --> 47:19.260
to say about them, but keep up the good work, and don't stop believing, wink face.

47:19.260 --> 47:22.300
DJ Rama asked, proud member of the OLR me since 2003.

47:22.300 --> 47:24.740
That was a long email.

47:24.740 --> 47:25.740
Last email.

47:25.740 --> 47:26.740
Alright.

47:26.740 --> 47:30.900
Hey, OLR Nintendo Maniac 64 here, for math class, I'm doing a survey-like thing, it's

47:30.900 --> 47:35.620
very simple, I need you to list your preference of which of the following gaming systems from

47:35.620 --> 47:37.620
one best to four worst.

47:37.620 --> 47:44.860
The Wii, the 360, Playstation 3, and PC emulators and ROMs do not count.

47:44.860 --> 47:48.740
And then, oh, he just wants to send an e, oh, never mind, he's wanting us to do his

47:48.740 --> 47:49.740
poll.

47:49.740 --> 47:51.220
Well, I'm curious, what of the four do you think is best?

47:51.220 --> 47:57.380
Oh, lordy, I'm just setting myself up for fanboy backlash.

47:57.380 --> 48:02.420
I'm gonna go strictly in terms of based of what's available, and what I play, and where

48:02.420 --> 48:06.580
my time goes based on that, because, you know, our golden rule, we haven't said it a long

48:06.580 --> 48:11.500
time on this show, so let me reiterate the golden rule of gaming, a console is only as

48:11.500 --> 48:13.380
good as the games that are on it.

48:13.380 --> 48:14.380
Yep.

48:14.380 --> 48:15.380
Alright.

48:15.380 --> 48:20.120
So, that being said, I would say the Xbox 360 is number one, PC is number two, Wii is

48:20.120 --> 48:23.100
number three, Playstation 3 is number four.

48:23.100 --> 48:25.100
I agree with that.

48:25.100 --> 48:31.700
But let me put this honestly, based on the golden rule of gaming, like Xbox 360, PC,

48:31.700 --> 48:36.820
and Wii, well, I would say Xbox 360 and PC are like really close to the top, Wii down

48:36.820 --> 48:38.580
a little bit, but still near the top.

48:38.580 --> 48:39.580
It's getting there.

48:39.580 --> 48:41.580
Big gap.

48:41.580 --> 48:43.460
And then Playstation 3 at the bottom.

48:43.460 --> 48:49.620
Well, being that I have a PS3 and have a bunch of games for it, the only game I played on

48:49.620 --> 48:54.500
that one regularly was Marvel Ultimate Alliance, and, you know, and now that I have it on Xbox

48:54.500 --> 48:56.500
360, I'm like, well, why?

48:56.500 --> 48:57.500
What's the point?

48:57.500 --> 49:00.700
I can actually play it and not have to shake my controller around like an idiot and look

49:00.700 --> 49:05.340
like I'm having a seizure trying to do the underwater level, so screw it.

49:05.340 --> 49:09.980
You know you don't need to flail your arms around a lot, you can just do it with your

49:09.980 --> 49:10.980
wrist.

49:10.980 --> 49:11.980
She likes to flail.

49:11.980 --> 49:13.380
I don't know, but I hate it.

49:13.380 --> 49:14.980
Loki, what would be your list?

49:14.980 --> 49:21.740
I don't know about PC, I mean, I don't play a lot of PC stuff, so I would say probably,

49:21.740 --> 49:27.220
well, 360 because there's just a lot of games on it.

49:27.220 --> 49:32.540
Wii is hard, I mean, there's a lot of games out there, but I don't play it a lot, so actually

49:32.540 --> 49:37.200
I would say probably, and I don't want to put the Playstation, I guess I'd say the same

49:37.200 --> 49:42.380
list as you, Rob, but the thing is, you know, I don't play a lot of PC games because my

49:42.380 --> 49:48.900
computer sucks, and then I don't play definitely a lot of Playstation 3 games because there's

49:48.900 --> 49:54.940
really nothing out for it, and the Wii, there's just nothing out that I really must have.

49:54.940 --> 49:59.540
Sometimes, and I have to keep this in mind about PC gaming, is that PC gaming can also

49:59.540 --> 50:03.320
be a lot of those homebrew and freeware things you play that you can't really get on any

50:03.320 --> 50:06.980
other system, and you know, certainly games like World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XI

50:06.980 --> 50:11.860
on the PC, big time sink games for me, you know, I probably, when you add it up, I actually

50:11.860 --> 50:14.420
probably do more gaming on the PC than anywhere else.

50:14.420 --> 50:18.180
I'm surprised, though, Mac wasn't number one on there, because I would have thought the

50:18.180 --> 50:19.180
Mac would be on there.

50:19.180 --> 50:21.240
Oh, that's right, it wasn't one of the options.

50:21.240 --> 50:22.240
My mistake.

50:22.240 --> 50:23.240
No games.

50:23.240 --> 50:24.240
No games.

50:24.240 --> 50:25.240
Sorry.

50:25.240 --> 50:26.240
Shut up.

50:26.240 --> 50:27.240
All right, any more to that email, DarkSakura?

50:27.240 --> 50:28.240
That's it for the mailbag.

50:28.240 --> 50:33.480
All right, if you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

50:33.480 --> 50:34.480
Until then.

50:34.480 --> 50:35.480
More news, right, Logie?

50:35.480 --> 50:36.480
Dot com.

50:36.480 --> 50:41.140
Yeah, of course, I have tons of news for you, anyways.

50:41.140 --> 50:47.900
So yeah, there's a, I'm pulling up different stories now, anyways, there's some interesting

50:47.900 --> 50:52.740
rumors going around about the Mel Your Solid movie, one of which is that Christian Bale

50:52.740 --> 50:58.780
is up for the role for Solid Snake himself, so that'd be pretty interesting.

50:58.780 --> 51:09.700
I guess it's from a UK magazine called Nuts, which I'm not really sure if I would add.

51:09.700 --> 51:15.980
I don't know how that would really rate there, but they say he's in the running to play Solid

51:15.980 --> 51:20.260
Snake for the 2009 movie Mel Your Solid.

51:20.260 --> 51:24.380
And of course, I don't know.

51:24.380 --> 51:28.660
That's a big fat rumor, I think.

51:28.660 --> 51:29.660
I don't know.

51:29.660 --> 51:32.020
I don't know if he'd look good as Snake, though.

51:32.020 --> 51:33.920
Can't see him as Snake.

51:33.920 --> 51:36.180
They need someone who's a lot more hardcore.

51:36.180 --> 51:38.700
Well, if Tom Selleck were younger.

51:38.700 --> 51:40.860
No, no, no, no, no.

51:40.860 --> 51:42.780
If Kurt Russell were younger.

51:42.780 --> 51:43.780
Kurt Russell, yeah.

51:43.780 --> 51:45.140
I like Kurt Russell.

51:45.140 --> 51:46.700
Kurt Russell would be able to do it.

51:46.700 --> 51:48.340
Or he could play Old Snake.

51:48.340 --> 51:49.820
Or even Richard Dean Anderson.

51:49.820 --> 51:50.820
Yeah.

51:50.820 --> 51:56.780
Do you saw him in the, no, I'm thinking of two people who play the same character in

51:56.780 --> 51:57.780
Stargate.

51:57.780 --> 51:58.780
Maybe.

51:58.780 --> 51:59.780
I don't know.

51:59.780 --> 52:00.780
Alright.

52:00.780 --> 52:01.780
I love Stargate.

52:01.780 --> 52:02.780
Anyway.

52:02.780 --> 52:03.780
Stargate's okay.

52:03.780 --> 52:08.980
You know what else is okay?

52:08.980 --> 52:09.980
What?

52:09.980 --> 52:10.980
Handsets.

52:10.980 --> 52:12.540
I don't know.

52:12.540 --> 52:15.700
I don't have a transition for this.

52:15.700 --> 52:21.220
But Sony Ericsson is possibly going to tap into the PlayStation brand for some of the

52:21.220 --> 52:26.820
new high-end, meaning expensive, mobile phones that they're going to be putting out.

52:26.820 --> 52:30.620
Could they be turning the PlayStation brand into what the N-Gage was?

52:30.620 --> 52:31.860
Not really.

52:31.860 --> 52:37.460
But they'll just kind of be using the PlayStation branding to try and launch a possible, I'm

52:37.460 --> 52:39.380
sorry, there is not a gaming phone.

52:39.380 --> 52:40.380
I should say this.

52:40.380 --> 52:43.140
I don't know PSP phone slash thing or whatever.

52:43.140 --> 52:50.700
But since Ericsson and PlayStation are under the same corporate entity, Sony, why not explore

52:50.700 --> 52:52.420
the possibilities of what could happen?

52:52.420 --> 52:54.100
So there you go.

52:54.100 --> 52:58.980
They need to just bring out the freaking Vodafone over here and leave it at that.

52:58.980 --> 52:59.980
I mean, who's going to care?

52:59.980 --> 53:02.740
Because everybody's buying one of those iPhones now.

53:02.740 --> 53:04.580
Even I'm tempted to get a stinking iPhone.

53:04.580 --> 53:08.580
But I'm holding out because I'm convinced next year they'll have GPS in them.

53:08.580 --> 53:10.620
That's the one thing that's missing that I want.

53:10.620 --> 53:11.620
I'm getting a BlackBerry.

53:11.620 --> 53:14.100
I think it's going to be revised so many times.

53:14.100 --> 53:15.420
I'm getting a BlackBerry.

53:15.420 --> 53:17.420
I'm trying so hard to resist the iPhone temptation.

53:17.420 --> 53:18.420
Let me just put it that way.

53:18.420 --> 53:19.420
I'm getting a BlackBerry.

53:19.420 --> 53:20.420
Well, aren't you special?

53:20.420 --> 53:22.420
I am.

53:22.420 --> 53:32.580
Well, for anyone who is interested in interesting ways of announcing games or hinting at games

53:32.580 --> 53:35.940
or starting weirdo rumors anyway.

53:35.940 --> 53:44.060
For the demo for Tony Hawk Proving Ground, there is a poster that says, shows a sequel

53:44.060 --> 53:48.260
for Gun, Magruder's Ghost.

53:48.260 --> 53:49.260
So is it a rumor?

53:49.260 --> 53:50.260
Is it a tease?

53:50.260 --> 53:51.260
Is it wishful thinking?

53:51.260 --> 53:54.100
Is it someone just trying to make a funny?

53:54.100 --> 53:57.460
Who knows?

53:57.460 --> 53:58.460
Hopefully it's a real game.

53:58.460 --> 53:59.460
Gun was okay.

53:59.460 --> 54:00.460
I know it wasn't.

54:00.460 --> 54:01.460
It didn't sell very well.

54:01.460 --> 54:02.460
I know it's good.

54:02.460 --> 54:03.460
Gun didn't do very well.

54:03.460 --> 54:04.460
Did it?

54:04.460 --> 54:05.460
So I was kind of.

54:05.460 --> 54:09.500
I mean, they can always fix that stuff for sequels.

54:09.500 --> 54:12.180
That's the whole point of doing a sequel, to fix the crap that didn't work in the first

54:12.180 --> 54:13.180
one.

54:13.180 --> 54:14.180
Exactly.

54:14.180 --> 54:19.340
That's why we're on so many NBA Live games and Madden and whatnot.

54:19.340 --> 54:24.220
Anyways, this is kind of a little 180 of normal news.

54:24.220 --> 54:28.780
Conan, the game that was supposed to be coming out at the end of October, got bumped up into

54:28.780 --> 54:29.780
September.

54:29.780 --> 54:34.700
In fact, now it's coming out the week of September 28th to compete with Halo.

54:34.700 --> 54:35.700
Hooray!

54:35.700 --> 54:40.300
That's not the smartest move, but it's nice to see that the game's actually going to be

54:40.300 --> 54:43.020
coming out earlier than expected.

54:43.020 --> 54:49.020
It is going to be kind of a hack and slash action game, similar to God of War.

54:49.020 --> 54:50.020
Lots of blood.

54:50.020 --> 54:54.300
I know there's full frontal nudity, so hey, that's got two things that I need and that's

54:54.300 --> 54:56.380
probably going to guarantee a sale.

54:56.380 --> 54:57.780
I don't know.

54:57.780 --> 54:59.960
We don't get enough games with nudity.

54:59.960 --> 55:01.700
We need more games with nudity.

55:01.700 --> 55:02.700
Damn straight.

55:02.700 --> 55:05.380
I want niche nudity games.

55:05.380 --> 55:06.880
Manhunt 2 is supposed to have lots.

55:06.880 --> 55:10.020
There's a whole S&M club, I guess.

55:10.020 --> 55:12.380
Playboy Mansion or whatever, that's niche nudity.

55:12.380 --> 55:16.020
I want hardcore nudity in mainstream games.

55:16.020 --> 55:20.260
Is that too much to ask for?

55:20.260 --> 55:22.180
BMX Triple X was great.

55:22.180 --> 55:23.900
That was a bad game, though.

55:23.900 --> 55:24.900
I know, but it's...

55:24.900 --> 55:25.900
It was not a bad game.

55:25.900 --> 55:26.900
It was fun.

55:26.900 --> 55:33.180
Dave mirrored BMX and it just had weird shit like, you know, impress a dog so he gets horny

55:33.180 --> 55:34.180
and fucks another dog.

55:34.180 --> 55:37.420
I mean, just weird shit, but it was just excuses for you to do tricks and stuff.

55:37.420 --> 55:38.820
You had to pick up the hooker.

55:38.820 --> 55:39.820
And pick up the hookers.

55:39.820 --> 55:41.180
I mean, it's a fun game.

55:41.180 --> 55:42.500
It's really weird, granted.

55:42.500 --> 55:45.020
I think it's a game that makes fun of itself.

55:45.020 --> 55:46.020
It is.

55:46.020 --> 55:47.020
It is.

55:47.020 --> 55:48.020
And it's another one of those games.

55:48.020 --> 55:52.740
I kind of have the benchmark where it's stuff that my sister actually plays.

55:52.740 --> 55:56.740
It's weird because they like these weird, nichey games like Driver 3 that's completely

55:56.740 --> 56:03.060
awful, but they find it fun, just like they find BMX Triple X fun, because it's really

56:03.060 --> 56:04.060
weird.

56:04.060 --> 56:07.700
You know what really weird game I want them to make a new one of?

56:07.700 --> 56:09.020
Jumping Flash.

56:09.020 --> 56:10.780
Okay, like, the whole chat...

56:10.780 --> 56:14.900
Okay, now like Leo Kristoff in chat says, why do you want to pay for CGI porn and Ross

56:14.900 --> 56:17.940
Steele UT says, guy, fuck no, I don't want porn games, really.

56:17.940 --> 56:18.940
I didn't...

56:18.940 --> 56:19.940
I said, I don't want porn games.

56:19.940 --> 56:23.540
I just want, like, you know, random nudity inserted into video games.

56:23.540 --> 56:27.620
Like, you know, it's like when you watch a movie, and then like, you know, like you're

56:27.620 --> 56:31.060
watching the movie and like, oh, I didn't know I'd get that ass shot, or, oh, tease.

56:31.060 --> 56:32.060
Life is Brian.

56:32.060 --> 56:33.060
You know?

56:33.060 --> 56:34.060
Yeah, or, you know, boop.

56:34.060 --> 56:36.900
Where he comes out fully naked and addresses the crowd.

56:36.900 --> 56:37.900
Where is that?

56:37.900 --> 56:38.900
We just need...

56:38.900 --> 56:40.820
It's gotta be porn.

56:40.820 --> 56:41.820
It's tasteful.

56:41.820 --> 56:42.820
We need random...

56:42.820 --> 56:46.780
Artistic purposes, because games are art, after all.

56:46.780 --> 56:49.500
We need random occurrences of naked.

56:49.500 --> 56:53.460
Of course, I hope you guys know what happens.

56:53.460 --> 56:57.860
No ferret bestiality, oh my God, DT, what the hell are you on?

56:57.860 --> 56:59.420
I'm half kidding, chat room.

56:59.420 --> 57:01.380
I hope you guys know.

57:01.380 --> 57:06.740
But there is no kidding around that PC is getting a new version, I'm sorry, is getting

57:06.740 --> 57:10.860
a new game called Stranglehold, which of course is coming to all the consoles as well.

57:10.860 --> 57:14.300
But Stranglehold is coming out this week on the consoles, but if you want to check out

57:14.300 --> 57:17.780
a demo, it's up now.

57:17.780 --> 57:24.140
The game ships on September 18th, but the PC demo is available to download right now.

57:24.140 --> 57:30.340
So if you want to check that out, go to your favorite downloading site, such as, you know,

57:30.340 --> 57:34.020
I don't know, what's a good site that doesn't make you pay to download stuff?

57:34.020 --> 57:37.220
Like, you know, because I hate those ones that are like, you know, oh, you get this

57:37.220 --> 57:38.220
many spots.

57:38.220 --> 57:39.220
Just find a torrent.

57:39.220 --> 57:40.220
Yeah, or just find a torrent.

57:40.220 --> 57:41.220
Game spots sometimes.

57:41.220 --> 57:42.780
That's a legal use of a torrent, so you can go for that.

57:42.780 --> 57:43.780
So Stranglehold.

57:43.780 --> 57:47.780
By the way, I did want to say this real quick, sorry, is that I thought it was interesting

57:47.780 --> 57:51.420
that I, because I want to use this story as an excuse to talk about MySpace and logging

57:51.420 --> 57:52.420
on to MySpace lately.

57:52.420 --> 57:54.980
I've noticed a lot of ads for Stranglehold on MySpace.

57:54.980 --> 57:56.620
I don't know if you guys have noticed this.

57:56.620 --> 58:00.860
I mean, usually ads are blocked, but for some reason these show up.

58:00.860 --> 58:05.500
And it's just so funny the way they're advertising the game to me is like, more stuff to blow

58:05.500 --> 58:08.420
up than any game ever.

58:08.420 --> 58:11.100
Just I don't know, it made me laugh.

58:11.100 --> 58:16.060
You know what, that would be the whole reason I would buy a game, is explosions.

58:16.060 --> 58:20.940
Well, speaking of things that aren't exploding, however, you can probably get some neat pyrotechnics

58:20.940 --> 58:22.740
included.

58:22.740 --> 58:27.660
More information about Guitar Hero 3 Legends of Rock is that it will be coming out on the

58:27.660 --> 58:29.700
PC and the Mac.

58:29.700 --> 58:31.460
Games on a Mac!

58:31.460 --> 58:34.500
Like snakes on a plane, but not really.

58:34.500 --> 58:41.620
It will have the same gameplay, same content as the console versions, unlockable, multiplayer

58:41.620 --> 58:49.580
mode, boss battles, I do believe downloadable content, which would make sense.

58:49.580 --> 58:53.900
And it's Guitar Hero.

58:53.900 --> 59:00.740
And it'll be cracked so wide open that it'll be freely available before you know it.

59:00.740 --> 59:05.220
And it's not that, but I'm waiting for people to crack this game to insert their own shit

59:05.220 --> 59:06.220
into it.

59:06.220 --> 59:08.460
It's been done on Playstation 2 and stuff.

59:08.460 --> 59:09.820
It's only a matter of time.

59:09.820 --> 59:14.580
I've seen Playstation 2 ones done with Metroid Metal music.

59:14.580 --> 59:18.740
And I just want to say though, shortly after the release of this game is when America is

59:18.740 --> 59:23.400
going to realize that we're just oversaturated with Guitar Hero crap and I think the series

59:23.400 --> 59:24.940
will start to decline.

59:24.940 --> 59:27.740
Just about, just like DDR.

59:27.740 --> 59:29.740
We'll see, we'll see.

59:29.740 --> 59:30.740
Anyways.

59:30.740 --> 59:35.340
Ah, so, um, and then my, there we go.

59:35.340 --> 59:39.220
Nintendo Midnight 64 mentioned that there's already something like that on PC called Fretz

59:39.220 --> 59:40.380
on Fire.

59:40.380 --> 59:43.260
And maybe that's why they want to do this, you know, because they realize there is a

59:43.260 --> 59:44.980
market for the PC guitars, who knows.

59:44.980 --> 59:47.540
Yeah, that's how we get like in the groove.

59:47.540 --> 59:48.540
Yay.

59:48.540 --> 59:52.060
Um, so, GameStop, once again we're talking about them.

59:52.060 --> 59:56.740
Now they're planning on catering to the casual gamer.

59:56.740 --> 59:57.740
Yay.

59:57.740 --> 01:00:02.860
Um, apparently they're going to be redesigning their stores or rearranging them, um, kind

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:03.860
of as a test.

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:07.420
And what they're going to do is they're going to have a couple new sections, including one

01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:09.780
dedicated to children's and family games.

01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:17.020
Uh, another section is going to be dedicated to, um, I guess, uh, like music rhythm games.

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:20.460
I mean, because there's quite a bit of stuff and I know they try to push a lot of those

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:21.460
peripherals.

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:27.860
Um, and then I guess they're going to have, uh, new sections for kiosks, I guess one that

01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:32.220
will also highlight music games and another one that will highlight family games.

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:39.500
So new kiosks, new sections, new reason to go to GameStop, probably not.

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:44.660
You know what I think GameStop's biggest failure has been lately, is, um, them, uh, not selling

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:48.200
anything older than, um, PS2.

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:54.460
I had to go to Fry's today, an electronics store nearby that's pretty big, because none

01:00:54.460 --> 01:01:00.220
of the GameStops within a 111 mile radius had any PSP cables.

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:01.220
Awesome.

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:02.660
Not cool.

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:05.880
Yeah, you can still go to GameCrazy and buy Genesis.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:07.380
There are options, folks.

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:09.460
Don't need to necessarily go to GameStop.

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:14.600
And also think about this, um, remember I bought the collector's edition of Bioshock

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.140
so I can get the Big Daddy.

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:20.860
Would I really have missed it if I didn't buy the collector's edition?

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:21.860
Probably not.

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:26.740
So don't be fooled in buying this shit for, like, crappy little trinkets that you probably

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:27.740
don't need anyways.

01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:30.500
GameCrazy needs your money.

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:31.500
That's all I'm going to say.

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.820
Yeah, they need a lot of money.

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:35.700
They need a whole lot of money.

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:36.700
Anyway.

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:37.700
Alright.

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:40.460
Well, is that it for the news tonight?

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:41.460
I think it is.

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:42.460
I think so.

01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:45.260
So this is where we open up the Skype line and let you guys interact with our program.

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:51.260
If you want to give us a call, our phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:56.620
is OrangeLoungeRadio and the Skype line is open and you guys can give us a call.

01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:57.620
So we'll wait for some calls.

01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:58.620
I don't know.

01:01:58.620 --> 01:01:59.620
Our listenership seems to be down a little bit tonight.

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:03.060
I don't know if that's the Emmys to thank for that or Back to School or the fact that

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:04.060
our show just sucks.

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:08.420
I don't know what it is, but we don't have a lot of live listeners as much as usual tonight.

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:14.000
So I'm hoping that we get some calls at some point, but the line is open.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.620
So go ahead and start calling.

01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:17.820
In the meantime, do we have any last minute stories?

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:19.820
Oh yeah.

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:20.820
Let's see.

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:21.820
Let's start off here.

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:25.580
Of course, Colin McRae, he's died in an helicopter crash.

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:32.140
You may remember him from such rally racing events that have happened, of course, in Europe

01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:39.540
and also because he's had his name on various rally racing games, including Dirt, which

01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:40.860
is actually pretty awesome.

01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:44.660
But unfortunately, he has passed away.

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:45.660
Let's see.

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:52.180
Also, I was going to say that China, this is funny, China's gaming companies are trying

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:54.540
to combat piracy.

01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:55.540
I don't know.

01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:58.940
If that gets you to laugh, I don't know what will, so.

01:02:58.940 --> 01:02:59.940
Okay.

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:06.300
Well, I mean, China is just big on, you know, a ton of pirate stuff coming out of there.

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:07.300
Yeah, but that's a scene.

01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:12.020
You can't, you know, label everybody as, you know, participating in the piracy rings.

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:13.020
All right, fine.

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:14.020
All right.

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:15.020
We got calls on Skype.

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:16.020
Let's go to that.

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:17.020
We'll get the rest of your stories in a minute.

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:18.020
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:19.020
Colin, are you there?

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:20.020
Yes, I am.

01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:21.020
And it's not Raven's Dolphin.

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:23.580
Oh, well, who is it then?

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:28.580
It's DJ Rama S. Well, hello, DJ Rama S. So somebody different got through first for once

01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:29.580
this week.

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:30.580
All right.

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:31.580
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:32.580
Not much.

01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:37.180
I want to make a comment about the whole GameStop thing about the man who got basically

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:40.460
suspended for only selling games to smart people.

01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:45.580
I can't say I don't blame him for doing that because I used to work in a video store and

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:51.100
the video store was like right by the schools and they would come in all the time and mess

01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:52.100
the place up.

01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:56.540
And then we started doing stuff like that, you know, we started doing like a program

01:03:56.540 --> 01:04:00.180
where if you had good grades, you get free rentals and stuff.

01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:05.900
And we were basically like a mom and pop store and we basically knew the families and stuff

01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:07.980
and they were coming all the time.

01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:12.540
And we, you know, we basically knew if you weren't doing too well in school and stuff,

01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:15.740
you weren't renting games at all, as simple as that.

01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:19.660
Well, I'm sorry, I was typing in chat.

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:20.660
What?

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:21.660
Sorry.

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:23.140
Everybody's like, I'm sorry.

01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:24.580
Restate your question real quick.

01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:28.940
No, what I said was I used to work at a mom and pop store and we basically did the same

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:31.240
thing what this GameStop manager did.

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:35.580
If you were, you know, if you were stupid, you know, like that, we wouldn't rent games

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:36.580
to you.

01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:37.580
Simple as that.

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:38.580
Wow.

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:41.740
So how, how exactly would you do the whole report card thing, the grades thing?

01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:43.380
Yeah, that's what we did.

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:44.380
Wow.

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.820
And how did that go over?

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:51.380
Basically the parents liked it because one thing was for sure was that, you know, we

01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:54.740
knew the parents knew, they knew they weren't doing their homework because they were too

01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:58.820
busy mulling around in our store, checking out the games and stuff like that.

01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:03.180
We had to like kick them out from time to time and just like, you know, it's like three,

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:06.460
three, four o'clock, you've been here over an hour, you should be at home doing your

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:10.300
homework instead of drooling over the games that you want to buy or rent.

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:11.300
Simple as that.

01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:12.300
Wow.

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:15.620
You know, I don't have a problem with people kicking out lawyers, but I mean, I don't think

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:19.660
it's a great business practice to turn away business, especially when most of the mom

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:25.180
and pop stores I talk to on a daily basis are having trouble selling games, let alone,

01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:27.140
you know, they're not like swimming in money.

01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:36.100
So I wouldn't, I would highly, you know, advise against it despite how tempting it may be.

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:39.660
Mystic Gohan says, what if my homework is to play a game?

01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:42.700
That was from our chat.

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:44.620
So that went over okay.

01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:46.540
There wasn't a lot of controversy there.

01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:48.420
No, not at all.

01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:53.740
You know, like I said, we were small, so everybody knew each other and it was pretty cool about

01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:55.580
it, you know?

01:05:55.580 --> 01:06:01.940
And I mean, overall, I don't blame this manager for doing it, but it's not his job to be the

01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:05.280
parent of over these kids, you know?

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:09.820
I mean, these parents should be more responsible and stuff like that, you know?

01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:10.820
That's the way I see it.

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:15.380
You know, overall, I give him points for doing that, but not at the risk of your job, you

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:16.380
know?

01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:17.380
All right.

01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:21.980
Well, thank you for the insight, I guess, from having been working for a game store

01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:23.540
that used to kind of do this.

01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:25.780
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:27.980
No, that's just I just want to throw my two cents about there.

01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:28.980
That's all.

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:29.980
Well, I appreciate it.

01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:30.980
I'm sorry I missed you the first time.

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:33.620
I thought someone else was listening and I was trying to work on a question that got

01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:36.620
asked in chat, so I didn't want you to feel like I was ignoring you.

01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:37.620
I'm sorry.

01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.100
We multitask while doing the show.

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:40.780
I know that feeling.

01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:41.780
All right.

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:42.780
Take care, buddy.

01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:43.780
You too.

01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:44.780
All right.

01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:45.780
Bye-bye.

01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:46.780
All right.

01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:50.940
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is ORANGE LOUNGE

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:54.220
RADIO on Skype.

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:56.580
Loki give us another last minute story while we wait for another call because there's a

01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:57.580
bit of a delay.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:58.580
Okay.

01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:04.220
So Jam Sessions has come out last week, I guess, and funny enough, if you purchase it

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:08.740
through Best Buy, you've got three hidden tracks.

01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:13.060
Well, actually anybody can get the hidden tracks, and funny enough, it's the Konami

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:17.500
code which unlocks those hidden tracks, despite the fact that the game's actually being made

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:18.660
by Ubisoft.

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:24.200
So to unlock Brad Paisley, I'm going to miss her, Jimi Hendrix, Wild Thing, and Tom Petty

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.240
Needles and Pins.

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:31.060
Simply push up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, during free mode, and it will

01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:32.060
give you those three songs.

01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:33.060
Wait.

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:34.060
And what game is this?

01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:35.060
Jam Sessions.

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:36.900
Isn't this the game that some of our listeners told you to stay away from?

01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:37.900
Yeah.

01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:38.900
Oh, okay.

01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:39.900
All right.

01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:40.900
Well, let's go to the phones.

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:41.900
We've got another call coming in.

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:42.900
Hi.

01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:43.900
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:44.900
Who's this?

01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:45.900
This is Jason.

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:46.900
Hi, Jason.

01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:47.900
And we do need a new jumping flash now.

01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:48.900
Jumping flash.

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:49.900
Amen.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:50.900
Oh, man.

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:54.260
Jamie said that, and I smiled so big.

01:07:54.260 --> 01:08:00.100
Jumping flash was my first ever PlayStation game, back when Blockbuster still rented out

01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:07.940
the systems, and I paid the, what, $150, well, my dad paid the $150 deposit, and I rented

01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:13.460
the system along with jumping flash and a Revolution X.

01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:14.460
Revolution X is awesome.

01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:16.820
Revolution X was awful at home, though.

01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:23.620
Yeah, it was, but I enjoyed it, and I laughed, and I played it regardless.

01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:25.740
The only system I ever rented was a Neo Geo.

01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:30.500
That's why I played Fatal Fury Special at home, which was all sorts of awesome.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:31.500
Let's see.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:32.500
What else was I going to ask about?

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:34.300
I'm trying to remember what the first PlayStation game I ever played was.

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:35.500
It might have been Final Fantasy VII.

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:36.500
I don't think I...

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:37.500
Oh, no, no.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.500
I remember.

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:39.500
I bought my PlayStation with Crash Bandicoot 2.

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.500
That was the first PlayStation game I ever played.

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:42.500
So I got into the PlayStation game a little late.

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:44.460
I think that was the one when I actually owned it.

01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:45.460
Huh?

01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:49.780
I think Crash Bandicoot was my first game when I actually owned a PlayStation as well.

01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:50.780
Wow.

01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:54.740
But as I said, I rented it well before that, and Jumping Flash was my first ever PlayStation

01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:55.740
game.

01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:56.740
Mm-hmm.

01:08:56.740 --> 01:09:00.860
I was a freshman in college, and my roommate's boyfriend had a PlayStation, but my friend

01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:06.660
had imported a Saturn before, so I'd actually played an import Saturn before we got them

01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:07.660
over here.

01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:08.660
You know what would be hilarious?

01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:09.660
Oh, sorry.

01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:16.300
I was just thinking, you know how they were talking about Guitar Hero 4 as being, I guess,

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:18.060
Aerosmith's going to be the big thing for that.

01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:22.580
Wouldn't it be hilarious if they had Revolution X as an unlockable in that?

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:23.580
I didn't say...

01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:25.980
Fire CD is for whaling boner.

01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:32.220
Well, what I was saying about the PlayStation stuff, though, is that my first PlayStation

01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:36.180
game that I played was Toshinden and Jumping Flash.

01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:39.180
Those were my first two.

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:42.340
And you said you were a freshman in college, and I don't even think I was in middle school

01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:43.340
at that point.

01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:44.340
I may have just been, but...

01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:45.620
Thank you for making me feel old.

01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:46.620
I'm sorry.

01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:47.620
I know.

01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:48.620
I'm sorry.

01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:54.380
But my first Saturn game that I played was that really crappy Gundam game, and Golden

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:55.380
Axe the Duel.

01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:59.180
I didn't even know they made that game on Saturn.

01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:00.180
Oh, yeah.

01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:01.180
It was really...

01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:02.180
It was actually a good game.

01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:06.620
I only remember two or three things about the Saturn.

01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:13.060
One of them was a friend of mine with the extra memory chip or something like that,

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:18.020
something along those lines, some kind of an expansion chip, Knights, and some weird

01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.940
mech game that I played at...

01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:22.060
Oh, I don't even remember where it was anymore.

01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:26.660
I think it was at Hastings or something like that on one of their demo kiosks, but I next

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:28.940
had no idea what it is anymore.

01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:32.140
Saturn was the machine you had if you were an importer, though, because you had arcade

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:38.660
perfect copies of Marvel Super Heroes versus Street Fighters, X-Men versus Street Fighter.

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:43.980
You had all the King of Fighters games, even though the load time was just completely ridiculous.

01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:44.980
Virtual on...

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:54.260
Ready for the beginning, CD systems, kind of, for mainstream, that didn't crash horribly.

01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:55.260
I still...

01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:56.260
Oh, yeah.

01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:58.800
And RalstillUT points out that all the working designs games came out for Saturn, like the

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:06.620
Rayearth RPG, and I actually did games, though, for the Sega CD, like they did...

01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:09.340
We had Popful Mail over here from Working Designs.

01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:16.980
But yeah, Fighters Megamix, Sephiroth 1215s us, but the Saturn just completely kicked

01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:19.780
the PlayStation's ass, and I'm sorry that it did so badly over here.

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:20.780
Oh, of course.

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:21.780
Oh, and Puzzle Fighter.

01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:26.060
Thank you to the people that did own the Saturn, the notion that that was the importer's console.

01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:29.220
Yes, that was very true, now that I think about it.

01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:34.140
It's funny, Dan and I used to hook up our Saturn and our PlayStation and have the same

01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:37.900
games in them, because we actually had a few of the games that were the same on both systems,

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:41.780
and we would compare what they looked like, and the Saturn was it for anything that was

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:44.740
2D or required a lot of memory.

01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:50.460
Even though the PlayStation was built for 3D, we compared Symphony of the Night, because

01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:55.980
I have the Japanese one on the Saturn, and all the 3D effects looked a lot better on

01:11:55.980 --> 01:12:02.580
the PlayStation, of course, but all of the sprites and the music was better on the Saturn,

01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:05.100
because I think the Saturn had a better sound processor.

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:10.020
The music being better was really common to pretty much every game on the Saturn, wasn't

01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:11.020
it?

01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:12.020
I think so.

01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:13.020
Well, a lot of things...

01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:14.020
I remember hearing something along those lines.

01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:17.500
They did have a lot of games, too, that were Red Book, and also other games that were pointed

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:25.140
out were Guardian Heroes, Panzer Dragoon, Sonic Jam, Silhouette Mirage, Dragon Force.

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:28.860
Sonic Jam, yes, that one is a very big deal.

01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:34.780
I remember my girlfriend really complaining about Sonic Jam's collection and the fact

01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:41.740
that they used the Sega CD version of Sonic Jam instead of the Saturn version, because

01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:49.820
the Saturn version actually had the true epic music composed to synthesized, MIDI-ish track

01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:50.820
version.

01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:55.300
And that's, yes, the world of difference right there.

01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:58.900
Wow, it's like a trip down memory lane here.

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:06.300
Well, also, for me being an importer, I actually lucked into a copy of Grandia on Saturn, and

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:11.420
comparing that to the PlayStation 1, oh my God, the PlayStation 1 was crap.

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:16.620
Even the 3D was crap in it, and it was so much better on Saturn.

01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:20.780
The music, you actually had a bigger view field, so you could see more stuff that was

01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:22.300
going on in the game.

01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:24.220
The timing was better.

01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:26.980
Everything came out so much better on the Saturn version.

01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:30.500
All right, Sega fanboys, we gotta wrap up and go to another call.

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:34.860
Jason, any last thoughts quickly before we move on?

01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:42.740
Bust-A-Move Bash with the Wii controller is absolutely, it makes so much sense, it plays

01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:45.300
so well, it is very, very fun.

01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:47.180
What game?

01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:51.900
Bust-A-Move Bash, it's like a puzzle game where you can play up to eight players at

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:52.900
one time.

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:56.500
My mind went to the old dance game, and I was like, there's a fucking new Bust-A-Move

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:57.500
out?

01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:01.140
I knew it would have, I should have said Puzzle Bobble Bash, because it would make more sense

01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:02.140
to you pretty much immediately.

01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:03.140
No, that's all right, okay.

01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:08.580
Bust-A-Move Bash for the Wii, the Wiimote control is so intuitive, it is so easy to

01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:10.420
pick up and play, it is so fun.

01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:11.420
Really?

01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:12.420
Might have to check it out.

01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:13.420
Yes.

01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:14.420
All right.

01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:15.420
It's pretty cheap.

01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:16.420
Give it a shot.

01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:17.420
It's fun.

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:22.140
Even though I've played this game like 50 times, this will be worth it, right?

01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:25.220
You might want to play it on mute, I'll warn you that.

01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:26.220
If you don't...

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:28.900
Well, maybe I can use my custom soundtrack for the Winamp, hopefully.

01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:29.900
We'll see.

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:30.900
Oh, yeah, that's true, huh?

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:31.900
Who knows?

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:32.900
I haven't gotten that yet.

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:33.900
I need to.

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:36.900
All right, Jason, we've got to let you go, but have a good one, okay, buddy?

01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:37.900
You too.

01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:38.900
All right, bye-bye.

01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:39.900
Goodnight.

01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:44.420
Thanks for hearing from Jason, our fearless webmaster, for OrangeLunchRadio.com.

01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:47.580
We'll probably take one more call, then we're going to call it a night, because we are running

01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:48.580
a little bit long tonight.

01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:50.300
I don't know what's going on with that.

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:53.300
Another last-minute story real quick, Loki, if you have any more.

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:54.300
Yeah.

01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:55.300
Do you have any?

01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:56.300
I have a whole ton.

01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:59.300
Anyways, they were talking a little bit bizarre.

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:03.460
They were talking about Project Anthem Racing 5 and what they want to do with that.

01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:09.540
One thing that they're looking to do is possibly off-road stuff, including quad bikes and off-road

01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:10.540
tracks.

01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:11.540
So, that's kind of neat.

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:13.220
All right, we've got another call real quick.

01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:14.620
Hi, you're on OrangeLunchRadio.

01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:15.620
Who's this?

01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:16.620
GS68.

01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:17.860
Well, hello, GS68.

01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:19.060
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:24.780
Yeah, you know the thing about the New Jersey parents reacting to the Wii Zapper?

01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:27.340
I'm sorry, the parents that are getting mad about the Wii Zapper?

01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:28.340
Yeah, yeah.

01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:29.340
I was particularly offended.

01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:33.980
I mean, for fuck's sake, I grew up with light gun games.

01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:37.900
And are you thinking about going and shooting actual people?

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.180
No.

01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:44.260
You know, and I wonder, at the carnivals, even before the days of video games, I mean,

01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:48.740
they still have the county fairs and the state fairs and the various carnivals around.

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:52.420
Don't they have those BB gun shooting games where you shoot pellets, as many pellets as

01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:56.220
you can through the little silhouette, and if you can punch out the star completely,

01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:57.220
you get a prize?

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.220
They have better than that now.

01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.220
That's true.

01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:00.700
They have to shoot the paintballs at the man thing.

01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:01.700
Cool.

01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:04.740
They have a guy in riot gear, and you can shoot him with paintballs.

01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:05.740
Wow.

01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:08.140
And don't they have, they also have a shooting range.

01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:12.540
You know, remember, like that fucking thing they have at Scandia, that's like that whole

01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:15.460
elaborate set up, like the Wild West, you can shoot like...

01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:17.460
I think they have one of those at Tilt.

01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:22.820
Okay, so anyway, I mean, yeah, these types of games existed long before video games,

01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:27.500
so these are just a couple of dumbasses who somehow got their name in the media.

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.180
And don't you mean start it with Nerf guns?

01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:32.420
I mean, they're obviously for kids, and they shoot real projectiles.

01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:33.420
Or Super Soaker.

01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:34.800
I keep thinking of that one commercial.

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:36.060
It's all over YouTube.

01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:39.820
It doesn't worry us, it says not to shoot someone in the face with it.

01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:40.820
Anyway.

01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:42.540
I like getting Super Soakers and putting ink in them.

01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:44.260
Why would you do that?

01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:45.260
That's mean.

01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:46.900
We used to when I was in middle school.

01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:48.100
Why would you do that?

01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:49.100
Because we were mean.

01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:50.780
You were a bad child.

01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:52.980
I should take it back.

01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:56.060
Well, yeah, I agree with you, GS68.

01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:57.060
These people are dumbasses.

01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:58.060
But what can you do?

01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:01.620
In every village, there's an idiot, right?

01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:02.620
Yeah.

01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:06.140
Well, any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?

01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:07.140
I don't think so.

01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:08.140
All right.

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:09.140
Well, thank you for your rant.

01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:10.140
We appreciate it.

01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:11.140
And it fits in well with our program.

01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:12.140
No problem.

01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:13.140
All right.

01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:14.140
Bye-bye, dude.

01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:15.140
See ya.

01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:16.140
All right.

01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:18.980
That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:20.140
Thank you to those that got through.

01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:21.720
Sorry to those that didn't.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:26.380
The new Skype is so weird because I can't, like...

01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:31.460
If five calls are coming in at once, I have to hang up on four to answer the one.

01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:35.420
And then the people that I hung up on will try to call right back.

01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:36.660
So I can never pick up a call.

01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:39.820
So now I have to force the calls to go to voicemail if we're already in a call.

01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:44.460
But then the people that keep calling back in seem to get right through.

01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:46.100
It's really weird.

01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:47.100
But I don't know.

01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:48.100
We'll see.

01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:49.100
We'll see what we can do with Skype.

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:50.100
I just want the old version back.

01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:51.100
Okay.

01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:52.100
Sorry.

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:53.100
Sorry.

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:54.100
Last minute news.

01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:57.780
To go back to what we were talking about earlier, Eternal Sonata has definitely been confirmed

01:17:57.780 --> 01:17:59.180
for the PlayStation 3.

01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:02.820
In fact, it will be shown at Tokyo Game Show in video form only.

01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:07.220
And there's actually some updates on what the PlayStation 3 will have that the Xbox

01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:13.620
360 won't, including new playable characters and a new clothing system in the works.

01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:15.460
So that's kind of interesting.

01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:16.660
And I guess...

01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:20.220
That is interesting with the release of the game in the U.S. only days away.

01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:23.920
Now they're telling us, oh, wait, maybe you want to wait for the PlayStation 3 version.

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:32.900
For those who love the game's characters will want to pay attention to Bandai Namco is also

01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:37.300
working on a costume system that will allow you to freely change your character's costumes.

01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:40.100
Accompanying this is an increase in costume variations.

01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:45.340
So unfortunately, PlayStation 3 owners will have to wait until 2008 to get their hands

01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:47.740
on this RPG update.

01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:49.940
So that was kind of funny.

01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:57.460
And some other things, real quick, Hot Shots Golf Online is coming out on PSP.

01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:00.460
That's another thing that's going to be shown at Tokyo Game Show.

01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:06.540
As well as there's going to be a free online RPG coming to the PlayStation 3 from Q Entertainment.

01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:07.740
That is interesting.

01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:09.060
I guess it's going to be...

01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:11.780
Oh, God, I hope that's not the actual...

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:12.780
Oh, no.

01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:15.580
It's the one we were talking about before, Angel Love Online.

01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:20.060
I think it's the one where you have to have sex with people and you get impregnated or

01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:21.060
something.

01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:22.060
What?

01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:23.060
What?

01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:24.060
There was one, though.

01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:25.060
I saw this on Kotaku.

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:26.060
From Q Entertainment?

01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:27.060
No.

01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:28.060
No.

01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:29.060
There's something else.

01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:30.060
Angel Love Online is what it's called.

01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:31.860
But I swear to God, I thought there was something that you had to impregnate women or something

01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:36.940
and then you created new characters based off that or something.

01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:38.940
There was some weird thing about that.

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:42.860
Anyways, other things to note real quick.

01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:47.380
There's another rumor coming from 1UP's podcast saying that Kingdom Hearts Zero is going to

01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:53.500
be announced at Tokyo Game Show and that Crisis Core is not the last Final Fantasy VII game.

01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:57.060
I can only hope that Crisis Core is the last Final Fantasy VII game.

01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:58.780
There is way too damn many.

01:19:58.780 --> 01:19:59.780
You know what?

01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:02.440
Kingdom Hearts Zero would make a lot of sense because the creators come out and said the

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:04.380
next game is not Kingdom Hearts 3.

01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:06.660
That would be a cute little trick to play.

01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:08.300
It's actually Kingdom Hearts Zero.

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:09.300
But here's the thing.

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:12.820
If it doesn't have the Disney tie-in this time, like if that's their way to not have

01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:14.900
Disney tie-ins this time, I'm not buying it.

01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:18.620
I'm sorry, but the Disney tie-ins make that game.

01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:22.500
And then the other thing, this is kind of going to DDR Universe.

01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:28.820
Apparently, if you were one of those people that downloaded the download content for Universe

01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:34.620
1, it will not be compatible with Universe 2, unlike the UltraMix series where all your

01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:39.460
download content was transferable to each additional game.

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:45.460
So sucks if you downloaded that one thing that they had.

01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:46.820
So that's interesting.

01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:52.260
Well, I think this is kind of cool, something I wouldn't mind looking forward to.

01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:59.020
Actually the developer that brought us R-Type, Irem, they're bringing out SteamBot 2 on PS3

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.820
for anyone who's interested.

01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:10.100
Over in Japan, it's Bumpy Trot, but it's a non-linear action-adventure game.

01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:14.660
And there's a comparison made between GTA and Harvest Moon, so I think that'd be pretty

01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:15.660
cool.

01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:17.540
It'll be announced at Tokyo Game Show.

01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:21.220
GTA meets Harvest Moon, that's awesome.

01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:22.220
I would exactly...

01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:24.100
Milk my cow, now die!

01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:27.660
No, it is not that good of a game, trust me.

01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:30.300
That would be awesome.

01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:31.900
Grand Theft Farmer.

01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:34.460
Yeah, that's not quite...

01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:36.260
That's it.

01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:40.180
Alright, well then if that's it for the last minute stories, then that means it's time

01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:41.740
to wrap up this damn show.

01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:44.300
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:46.380
We'll start off with Loki tonight.

01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:47.380
Loki, what's your final thought?

01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:52.300
My final thought is I don't want to see the next Resident Evil movie.

01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:56.540
My final thought is I am craving a Marie Callender's pie right now.

01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:58.820
I want pies so bad it hurts.

01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:03.260
I had to buy a pie for a potluck and then we left before we even got to dessert.

01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:06.140
So my poor pie, I had to leave.

01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:07.140
Now I crave a pie.

01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:08.140
Poor baby.

01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:09.140
I know, poor me.

01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:10.900
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:17.540
I have to wake up at 4 in the morning because I have to be at work at 6 so that I can leave

01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:21.340
at 10 and go to a dentist appointment.

01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:25.540
Fortunately for me, it's just a routine cleaning and I always fall asleep.

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:26.540
And then I get to go home.

01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:27.540
Lucky you.

01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:29.020
It's because I hate the dentist.

01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:33.660
These very comfortable chairs at my dentist's office and they're cushy and they're completely

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:34.820
ergonomic.

01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:38.940
So when you're laying in them, you're not like, you know, sections propped up.

01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:42.780
It's completely curved to your body shape with like memory foam and shit.

01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:45.420
And I'm like, I'm going to pass out now.

01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:48.220
Do whatever you want to to my teeth.

01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:49.220
It's great.

01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:50.220
Lucky you.

01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:51.220
That's all I have to say.

01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:52.220
I love my dentist.

01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:53.220
All right.

01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:54.220
Well, that's going to do it for the show tonight.

01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:57.580
Boys and girls, thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting independent

01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:59.340
radio and independent podcasts.

01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:00.340
You guys are awesome.

01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:04.340
And of course, it's you guys downloading us and participating and letting us know you

01:23:04.340 --> 01:23:09.500
care that keeps us going from week to week for almost 250 shows now, if you can believe

01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:11.620
it.

01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:12.620
But that's going to do it for this week.

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:16.280
Remember, if you like our show, all we ask, tell two people you know about the show because

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:19.460
if everybody tells two people, then slowly we take over the world.

01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:23.580
Or if you have no friends, which would be sad and I'm sorry for one, but if you have

01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:24.580
no friends, you can tell about the show.

01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:25.580
Tell your imaginary friends.

01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:30.220
Leave us a review on iTunes, a positive review on iTunes or any other type of site.

01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:35.500
Your dig.coms, your Yahoo podcasts, your podcast alley, hell, there's a million of them.

01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:37.340
Spread the love.

01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:41.820
