[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

00:20.430 --> 00:20.530
[SPEAKER_10]: I am.

00:20.550 --> 00:20.710
[SPEAKER_10]: You are.

00:45.504 --> 00:46.264
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I am.

00:46.924 --> 00:47.344
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

00:47.844 --> 00:52.745
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so there was a game that we saw a couple years back when they were first showing off the Wii.

00:53.445 --> 00:54.486
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was kind of neat.

00:54.726 --> 00:58.146
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought the title was retarded, but whatever.

00:58.306 --> 01:00.727
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's this game, Project Hammer.

01:01.327 --> 01:04.527
[SPEAKER_02]: And while people were speculating, is it on hold?

01:05.327 --> 01:05.887
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?

01:05.987 --> 01:07.788
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, according to me, it's been canceled.

01:08.708 --> 01:11.248
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not coming back.

01:11.548 --> 01:14.889
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's too bad, because who doesn't like hitting people

01:15.498 --> 01:16.339
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:37.679 --> 01:38.139
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't bad.

01:38.840 --> 01:41.101
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better than DK Bongo Blast.

01:41.301 --> 01:42.561
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder why they ended up canceling it.

01:42.581 --> 01:43.822
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder what we're going to get instead.

01:43.862 --> 01:49.405
[SPEAKER_10]: Because sometimes when these games get canceled, something else comes out instead that makes it, you know, kind of worth the wait.

01:49.425 --> 01:52.266
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have the Project Hammer guy in, like, Super Smash Bros.

01:52.286 --> 01:52.966
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be hilarious.

01:53.046 --> 01:59.089
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, didn't they say at Game Developers Conference this year or something like that that Pikmin was the result of something else?

02:00.430 --> 02:05.352
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the result of, like, Mario's... Yeah, it was a Mario concept that ended up being the Pikmin game.

02:05.372 --> 02:06.293
[SPEAKER_10]: So you never know what might happen.

02:07.737 --> 02:09.278
[SPEAKER_10]: Frisbee asked a good question in chat.

02:09.578 --> 02:11.178
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever happened to that game Sadness?

02:12.159 --> 02:13.299
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still being worked on.

02:13.599 --> 02:13.840
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it?

02:14.380 --> 02:15.140
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as I'm aware.

02:15.400 --> 02:15.960
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we'll see.

02:17.161 --> 02:18.101
[SPEAKER_10]: Now this is pretty cool.

02:18.141 --> 02:19.602
[SPEAKER_10]: Some new information about the Wii.

02:19.642 --> 02:22.643
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know this will make DarkSakura all kinds of excited.

02:23.263 --> 02:29.446
[SPEAKER_10]: It has been announced that TurboGrafx-16 CD games are on their way to Wii Virtual Console.

02:30.246 --> 02:33.067
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe some of the earlier titles were announced.

02:33.528 --> 02:34.308
[SPEAKER_10]: I have not seen...

02:35.821 --> 02:37.362
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember what was on the early list.

02:37.422 --> 02:40.504
[SPEAKER_10]: Sadly, the Dracula game you love, Jamie, wasn't on there.

02:40.624 --> 02:41.225
[SPEAKER_02]: I do remember.

02:41.245 --> 02:42.866
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say Ys 1 and 2 was on it, though.

02:42.886 --> 02:43.906
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Ys 1 and 2 was on there.

02:44.266 --> 02:44.847
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

02:44.947 --> 02:46.688
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have that game, but it's still awesome.

02:47.128 --> 02:49.750
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm curious, and what we're all wondering about.

02:49.770 --> 02:50.630
[SPEAKER_04]: I want the Valis games.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.132
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how the hell are they going to fit all this on the virtual console?

02:53.172 --> 02:55.393
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the Wii only has so much internal memory.

02:55.413 --> 03:02.838
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, first of all, the biggest things about the TurboGrafx-CD games were that most of the audio on them actually is all Redbook audio.

03:03.615 --> 03:05.812
[SPEAKER_04]: So all you'd have to do is compress it.

03:06.613 --> 03:08.594
[SPEAKER_10]: Or maybe they've removed the audio from the games?

03:08.634 --> 03:09.675
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think that maybe they've done that?

03:09.995 --> 03:10.856
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think it's compressed.

03:10.876 --> 03:11.556
[SPEAKER_02]: Just put it down to MP3.

03:11.576 --> 03:12.697
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd probably be really small.

03:13.138 --> 03:15.339
[SPEAKER_02]: Or AugVorbis or whatever they want to use.

03:15.359 --> 03:15.719
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

03:16.040 --> 03:18.561
[SPEAKER_10]: But I imagine you won't be able to fit that many of those on the game.

03:18.621 --> 03:21.303
[SPEAKER_10]: Or they're going to start selling these memory cards or something.

03:21.343 --> 03:22.524
[SPEAKER_10]: Virtual console memory cards.

03:22.744 --> 03:23.084
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

03:24.145 --> 03:25.646
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, any memory card will work.

03:25.666 --> 03:26.467
[SPEAKER_10]: But you guys know what I mean.

03:26.927 --> 03:28.888
[SPEAKER_10]: They might start pushing people to get more memory cards.

03:28.948 --> 03:33.011
[SPEAKER_04]: The games themselves, though, didn't take up a whole lot of space.

03:33.091 --> 03:34.092
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're just really...

03:34.612 --> 03:44.439
[SPEAKER_04]: The equivalent of, I think one of the biggest ones that I personally have is Sapphire, which has some rendered graphics in it.

03:45.280 --> 03:48.182
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually it has some true polygons in it.

03:49.523 --> 03:55.908
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the CD arcade games, but if we're just getting out like, you know, just Ys and...

03:57.173 --> 04:01.959
[SPEAKER_04]: and all the other sprite-based ones, that wouldn't take any space at all.

04:02.179 --> 04:03.761
[SPEAKER_10]: The games are only going to be 800 points.

04:04.041 --> 04:04.802
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a pretty good deal.

04:05.183 --> 04:06.384
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a really good deal.

04:06.484 --> 04:08.567
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's going to be a major thing at all.

04:08.867 --> 04:13.993
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if they're doing the Bomberman CD that came as a pack-in with the duo.

04:14.754 --> 04:14.814
[SPEAKER_04]: Or...

04:17.193 --> 04:18.675
[SPEAKER_10]: and Rondo of Blood, maybe.

04:18.796 --> 04:20.558
[SPEAKER_04]: Rondo of Blood could actually easily be done.

04:20.638 --> 04:26.087
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're getting Super Nintendo cartridges on there, it is not going to be hard at all for them to do Rondo of Blood.

04:26.107 --> 04:29.171
[SPEAKER_10]: How much of a fangasm will you have if Rondo of Blood comes out on Virtual Console?

04:29.191 --> 04:32.877
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be like, thank God I don't have to put my disc in the machine anymore.

04:35.141 --> 04:40.664
[SPEAKER_04]: My actual Rondo of Blood CD is still in perfect condition, but I twitch every time.

04:40.744 --> 04:44.886
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't move the machine while I'm playing it because the disc costs $300.

04:45.206 --> 04:54.531
[SPEAKER_02]: It was saying that they were talking about there's going to be 10 games in 2007, 5 more slated for 2008.

04:54.751 --> 05:02.495
[SPEAKER_02]: Game downloads will be 800 points, and I guess they're saying Rondo of Blood and Snatcher are true possibilities.

05:02.515 --> 05:03.396
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

05:04.520 --> 05:04.900
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

05:05.581 --> 05:06.101
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be awesome.

05:33.300 --> 05:41.364
[SPEAKER_10]: That's rad, though, that they actually released that on Virtual Console, because we have never in this country seen the original Lost Levels, except on ROMs.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.566
[SPEAKER_10]: But if I seem to recall right, wasn't that a disc game?

05:44.826 --> 05:46.827
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I said, it was a Famicom disc game.

05:47.247 --> 05:47.627
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

05:48.328 --> 05:50.689
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the price for it is going to be 600 points.

05:51.269 --> 05:58.193
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that that's actually fair, because it is, you know, basically a game that...

05:58.948 --> 06:00.389
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

06:22.479 --> 06:26.681
[SPEAKER_10]: But maybe Doki Doki Panic will come out now that they're releasing Japanese games on the console.

06:27.021 --> 06:29.683
[SPEAKER_10]: That opens huge doors now.

06:30.263 --> 06:31.403
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's a little bit more.

06:31.804 --> 06:38.447
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Mario Super P-Cross coming out, which is 900 Wii Points.

06:39.487 --> 06:43.569
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have Newtopia 2, which we were discussing earlier.

06:44.429 --> 06:46.111
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

07:09.592 --> 07:12.534
[SPEAKER_02]: In Europe and Australia.

07:13.075 --> 07:15.236
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess this is week one is Mario week.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.658
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week, they're going to be having Ninja week.

07:19.559 --> 07:23.782
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to include Ninja Gaiden and Ninja Jaja Maru-kun.

07:24.682 --> 07:28.445
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I guess the third week is going to be Sci-Fi week.

07:28.465 --> 07:30.706
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to have Sin and Punishment and Gradius 3.

07:32.728 --> 07:33.408
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good game.

07:34.709 --> 07:37.511
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, of the Gradius games, which one's your favorite?

07:39.774 --> 07:40.594
[SPEAKER_10]: I miss Salamander, Life Force

08:02.912 --> 08:31.734
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think Salamander was a slight bit cooler I'm really hoping now this is completely off topic here and I did like Life Force or Salamander I was going to say it'd be really awesome if they did they really need to do this in the US as well and I think they also need to do like the Nintendo World Championships cart and have that with an online leaderboard with scores that you can post on there if anyone remembers that the World Championship cart

08:32.250 --> 08:32.750
Yeah.

08:33.330 --> 08:34.210
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of curious.

08:34.250 --> 08:38.731
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to ask the chat room what kinds of import games that we've been missing in the U.S.

08:38.811 --> 08:39.411
[SPEAKER_10]: or the U.K.

08:39.491 --> 08:42.792
[SPEAKER_10]: for a long time would you like to see come to Virtual Console?

08:43.072 --> 08:48.293
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure somebody's going to say Doki Doki Panic, although in some extent... I'll take the first five ones on Pirate Message.

08:48.313 --> 08:48.633
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that?

08:48.793 --> 08:51.554
[SPEAKER_10]: We already have Doki Doki Panic.

08:51.574 --> 08:52.734
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to take some private messages?

08:52.774 --> 08:53.014
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

08:53.214 --> 08:54.514
[SPEAKER_04]: Send me the first five private messages.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.135
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me what import game you'd like to see come out.

08:56.275 --> 08:56.535
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

08:56.615 --> 08:57.535
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we'll read those in a little bit.

08:57.655 --> 08:57.755
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.900
[SPEAKER_10]: Send DarkSakura a private message in our chat.

09:01.080 --> 09:04.122
[SPEAKER_10]: But it has to be in our regular chat room, chat.orangelondradio.com.

09:04.142 --> 09:05.022
[SPEAKER_04]: And not 2DX.

09:05.702 --> 09:05.962
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

09:06.303 --> 09:12.826
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, if you're watching us on Operator 11, we're not looking at the chat room over there because our computer that streams Op 11 is all the way on the other side of the room.

09:13.946 --> 09:15.667
[SPEAKER_10]: So, wow.

09:16.108 --> 09:16.748
[SPEAKER_10]: Virtual console.

09:17.668 --> 09:19.869
[SPEAKER_02]: So other neat stuff, I guess.

09:20.310 --> 09:23.031
[SPEAKER_02]: Oblivion's Gamebryo engine has been ported to the Wii now.

09:23.795 --> 09:24.996
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Age of Camelot

09:42.253 --> 09:43.454
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I mean, that's pretty cool.

09:43.474 --> 09:46.156
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll see an actual cool role-playing game or something.

09:46.196 --> 09:47.137
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe something scaled down.

09:47.177 --> 09:48.277
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, they could do Oblivion.

09:48.558 --> 09:50.959
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the PSP version that was supposed to be coming out a while ago?

09:50.979 --> 09:53.141
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell ever happened to the Wii?

09:53.741 --> 09:54.482
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's coming.

09:54.602 --> 09:55.403
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it got cancelled.

09:55.823 --> 09:56.163
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

09:57.084 --> 10:01.467
[SPEAKER_02]: But, hey, who says they can't port that over to maybe the Wii or something?

10:01.947 --> 10:07.972
[SPEAKER_02]: Where they have a little bit more disk space to work with and, I don't know, real-time sword controls, maybe?

10:08.372 --> 10:08.752
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

10:09.313 --> 10:10.313
[SPEAKER_02]: Just speculation here.

10:10.974 --> 10:11.214
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh.

10:11.234 --> 10:11.314
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

10:11.798 --> 10:12.258
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

10:12.739 --> 10:20.965
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, certainly if these guys want to use this Oblivion engine to make new games for the Wii, it's not like there's a shortage of Wiis out there.

10:21.025 --> 10:23.207
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, certainly these things are still selling pretty well.

10:23.487 --> 10:26.530
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure we've had plenty of sales stories on the Wii in previous shows.

10:27.110 --> 10:28.612
[SPEAKER_10]: And, of course, this all leads up to Christmas.

10:28.632 --> 10:31.334
[SPEAKER_10]: You might remember last Christmas, finding a Wii was tough.

10:31.414 --> 10:34.877
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it was the Cabbage Patch Kids or the Furbies of last year.

10:35.357 --> 10:40.181
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, and actually, rare fact or rare dumb little tidbit, I actually own a Furby.

10:41.325 --> 10:42.146
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

10:57.695 --> 10:58.215
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?

10:58.316 --> 11:01.037
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you guys going to have enough supply this Christmas season?

11:01.357 --> 11:05.320
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Reggie Fils-Aimé says, quote, And that was a quote that Reggie Fils-Aimé said to the San Jose Mercury News.

11:05.400 --> 11:07.821
[SPEAKER_10]: So, of course, if you really want one of these, though...

11:18.928 --> 11:22.789
[SPEAKER_10]: Reggie Fils-Aimé still says you should regularly check to see if the system is available.

11:23.069 --> 11:29.570
[SPEAKER_10]: So even though they're saying they're going to flow through the streets with Wii supplies, you probably still want to call the store and check.

11:29.830 --> 11:31.071
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll believe it when I see it.

11:31.371 --> 11:32.131
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm saying.

11:32.251 --> 11:33.811
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll believe that shit when I see it.

11:34.091 --> 11:34.351
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

11:35.031 --> 11:35.511
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't believe it.

11:36.312 --> 11:39.112
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, obviously I haven't tried to purchase a Wii in a long time.

11:39.432 --> 11:40.252
[SPEAKER_10]: How is it out there?

11:40.292 --> 11:42.433
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, are they still pretty hard to find?

11:43.213 --> 11:43.953
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been getting worse.

11:43.973 --> 11:44.193
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

11:44.453 --> 11:44.593
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

11:44.613 --> 11:47.074
[SPEAKER_02]: Promises, promises, and then no fucking delivery.

11:47.174 --> 11:47.954
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it's been.

11:48.482 --> 11:49.042
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadface.

11:49.763 --> 11:53.025
[SPEAKER_10]: I just hope they have some games to move those systems this year.

11:53.105 --> 11:54.706
[SPEAKER_10]: But I guess we get in Smash Bros.

11:54.766 --> 11:56.607
[SPEAKER_10]: Brawl, Mario Galaxy.

11:56.667 --> 11:57.668
[SPEAKER_10]: Those will be two AAA titles.

11:57.688 --> 11:58.329
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't get me wrong.

11:58.349 --> 12:05.694
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have a pretty good first-party lineup for the rest of this year and even January, hopefully Mario Kart soon.

12:06.534 --> 12:06.774
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

12:07.034 --> 12:10.016
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's all about systems.

12:10.156 --> 12:11.117
[SPEAKER_02]: You really need the systems.

12:11.157 --> 12:14.279
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really hope that he's not blowing smoke up my ass.

12:15.040 --> 12:15.680
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope not.

12:16.741 --> 12:18.202
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't like smoke in my ass.

12:18.874 --> 12:19.514
[SPEAKER_02]: Much like meat.

12:21.135 --> 12:21.575
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.697
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we got our responses in.

12:25.077 --> 12:25.537
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, okay.

12:25.898 --> 12:26.338
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's hear them.

12:27.118 --> 12:29.259
[SPEAKER_04]: Leo Christoph says, Kurukuru Kururin.

12:30.720 --> 12:31.700
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know that game.

12:31.720 --> 12:32.901
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Game Boy Advance game.

12:33.261 --> 12:35.622
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you can't have Game Boy.

12:35.642 --> 12:37.523
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't do Game Boy games on Virtual Console.

12:37.583 --> 12:38.064
[SPEAKER_10]: Cheater.

12:39.324 --> 12:40.225
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn dirty cheater.

12:40.245 --> 12:40.825
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm just kidding.

12:41.285 --> 12:42.846
[SPEAKER_04]: Foodie Monster says, Gauss Panic.

12:44.247 --> 12:44.927
[SPEAKER_10]: That would rock.

12:45.247 --> 12:45.968
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, winner.

12:46.468 --> 12:48.509
[SPEAKER_04]: GS68 says, Gradius 2 NES version.

12:49.753 --> 12:50.494
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't we already have?

12:50.694 --> 12:51.274
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we don't.

12:52.295 --> 12:53.336
[SPEAKER_10]: In Japan, they got it.

12:53.536 --> 12:53.737
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

12:54.757 --> 12:56.479
[SPEAKER_04]: Hitson says Pulseman for the Mega Drive.

12:57.520 --> 12:57.880
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

12:58.461 --> 13:01.323
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what I would pick for Mega Drive?

13:01.784 --> 13:03.325
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd freaking be Panorama Cotton.

13:03.745 --> 13:04.366
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hell yeah.

13:04.426 --> 13:04.926
[SPEAKER_10]: Good luck.

13:05.206 --> 13:06.808
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know I have Rainbow Cotton.

13:08.702 --> 13:17.927
[SPEAKER_10]: This somehow comes up, because I seem to remember I asked, I made the mistake of asking in the early days of OLR, because Jamie has a very scary collection of video games in her house.

13:18.067 --> 13:18.787
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you missing?

13:19.007 --> 13:20.708
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the one thing you want that you're missing?

13:20.768 --> 13:21.908
[SPEAKER_04]: Frickin' Panorama Cotton.

13:21.928 --> 13:23.209
[SPEAKER_10]: Frickin' Panorama Cotton.

13:23.849 --> 13:27.631
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Panorama Cotton, Sega made 600 copies of it.

13:28.431 --> 13:29.912
[SPEAKER_04]: I know somebody who owns one.

13:30.972 --> 13:31.833
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got to touch it.

13:32.653 --> 13:34.094
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a special day in my life.

13:35.943 --> 13:39.904
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you touch it with your fingers or did you rub it on your arm or your boobs?

13:39.924 --> 13:41.945
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually played a legit Panorama Cotton before.

13:42.045 --> 13:42.405
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you?

13:42.905 --> 13:44.085
[SPEAKER_10]: It was really, really nice.

13:44.125 --> 13:44.885
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I touch your hand?

13:45.706 --> 13:47.906
[SPEAKER_10]: I've touched the hand that touched a Panorama Cotton.

13:48.346 --> 13:48.706
[SPEAKER_04]: You should.

13:49.867 --> 13:51.707
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll hook you up with playing Panorama Cotton.

13:51.727 --> 13:52.227
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, all right.

13:52.567 --> 13:56.848
[SPEAKER_04]: Rostelia T suggests Terranigma and Dragon Quest V and VI.

13:57.809 --> 13:57.989
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

13:58.089 --> 14:03.250
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that might be cool, but obviously they might have to translate it, and I don't think these other ones were translated, so...

14:03.908 --> 14:07.169
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris B mentioned the Japanese Mario Bros.

14:07.189 --> 14:10.250
[SPEAKER_04]: 2, not the All-Stars version, but that was the one they're getting in the UK on Virtual Console.

14:10.790 --> 14:11.990
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's only really a matter of time.

14:12.511 --> 14:12.771
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

14:13.991 --> 14:15.791
[SPEAKER_04]: And DarkTetia says Crisis Force.

14:17.292 --> 14:17.532
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

14:17.772 --> 14:18.672
[SPEAKER_04]: So what would you pick, Rob?

14:20.573 --> 14:20.633
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

14:21.704 --> 14:24.565
[SPEAKER_10]: How about the version of Excitebike where you could actually save and load?

14:24.785 --> 14:25.946
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be the disc version.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.248
[SPEAKER_10]: Why didn't they do that for the fucking virtual console version?

14:29.368 --> 14:30.708
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a really good question.

14:30.768 --> 14:31.048
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

14:31.289 --> 14:32.229
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, you know what I want?

14:32.329 --> 14:32.909
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's what I want.

14:32.989 --> 14:35.691
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to talk about fucking obscure only available in Japan only?

14:36.271 --> 14:40.613
[SPEAKER_10]: I want the Zelda 1 remake that was on the Nintendo Channel thing.

14:41.053 --> 14:42.074
[SPEAKER_10]: The whatever it was called.

14:42.134 --> 14:42.874
[SPEAKER_04]: The NPS Satellaview.

14:43.014 --> 14:43.374
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

14:43.614 --> 14:44.295
[SPEAKER_10]: The Intelliview.

14:44.575 --> 14:45.435
[SPEAKER_04]: Satellaview.

14:45.675 --> 14:47.016
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the remake about?

14:47.076 --> 14:48.237
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just different graphics?

14:48.377 --> 14:50.818
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Super Nintendo graphics, and I think it had shorter levels.

14:51.398 --> 15:01.588
[SPEAKER_04]: It was meant, um, this, this, uh, Teleview was, um, a, uh, pay service where you had a timer for how long you could play, but there are hacked ROMs out there now that you can play it without a timer.

15:01.608 --> 15:02.109
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there really?

15:02.129 --> 15:02.789
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Dan played through it.

15:03.430 --> 15:03.530
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

15:03.650 --> 15:04.251
[SPEAKER_04]: Played through it.

15:04.911 --> 15:06.253
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know that there were ROMs in there.

15:13.357 --> 15:13.757
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's rad.

15:13.977 --> 15:15.138
[SPEAKER_04]: From the big competition.

15:15.178 --> 15:15.998
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be rad.

15:16.118 --> 15:18.839
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember the, that would be so cool on the Wii.

15:19.279 --> 15:22.540
[SPEAKER_10]: If they would bring back that old, you know, like the World Championships.

15:22.560 --> 15:23.901
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember the Nintendo World Championships?

15:23.941 --> 15:26.001
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said about five minutes ago.

15:26.261 --> 15:26.581
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

15:27.762 --> 15:28.962
[SPEAKER_10]: The online leaderboards.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.323
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what I said five minutes ago.

15:31.363 --> 15:32.423
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you not paying attention?

15:32.483 --> 15:33.164
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess not.

15:33.484 --> 15:33.964
[SPEAKER_02]: God.

15:36.845 --> 15:38.265
[SPEAKER_10]: I was thinking about Panorama Cotton.

15:38.305 --> 15:41.246
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they'd eventually finish Robotech Crystal Dreams.

15:43.206 --> 15:45.989
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a wireless classic controller for the GameCube.

16:08.450 --> 16:12.112
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, oh no, it's for the Wii, but it's by Thrustmaster, which has the best name ever.

16:12.192 --> 16:13.152
[SPEAKER_02]: Thrustmaster.

16:14.072 --> 16:15.133
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the name of the controller?

16:15.153 --> 16:16.233
[SPEAKER_10]: Thrustmaster?

16:16.253 --> 16:18.534
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the company that's putting it out is Thrustmaster.

16:18.654 --> 16:23.176
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds like, you know, something Suzanne Summers would be selling with the Thighmaster, the Thrustmaster.

16:23.196 --> 16:28.799
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like a bad porn, you know, instead of like Beastmaster, you have, you know, Thrustmaster, Beastiality Master or something.

16:28.819 --> 16:29.659
I don't know.

16:31.780 --> 16:33.260
[SPEAKER_04]: Thrustmaster just sounds like bad porn.

16:34.521 --> 16:34.741
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

16:35.421 --> 16:35.882
[SPEAKER_10]: Good times.

16:36.482 --> 16:36.942
[SPEAKER_02]: Any ways.

16:38.882 --> 16:44.444
[SPEAKER_02]: So, here's another thing I don't understand about that wireless virtual console controller.

16:44.904 --> 16:49.586
[SPEAKER_02]: Why they don't have it where it can be also a GameCube controller as well.

16:49.866 --> 16:56.728
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't they release something like that for the Wii so that you can use one controller for virtual console and for GameCube games.

16:57.368 --> 16:58.349
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you need to do.

16:58.549 --> 16:59.489
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it happen, people.

17:01.430 --> 17:04.791
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, one thing that certain parents don't want to happen is...

17:05.626 --> 17:12.927
[SPEAKER_02]: Much like me, is the Wii Zapper attachment, which is the most retarded thing on the face of the earth, I swear to God.

17:12.987 --> 17:13.467
[SPEAKER_10]: Why the hate?

17:13.907 --> 17:14.608
[SPEAKER_10]: Why the hate, Loki?

17:14.628 --> 17:15.048
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the hate?

17:15.128 --> 17:15.748
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stupid.

17:15.768 --> 17:16.688
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a piece of plastic.

17:16.728 --> 17:17.508
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need it.

17:17.708 --> 17:20.008
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does not enhance your games, and I will prove it to you.

17:20.028 --> 17:20.509
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

17:20.689 --> 17:21.369
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes out.

17:21.389 --> 17:22.309
[SPEAKER_10]: You might owe me a date.

17:22.649 --> 17:24.269
[SPEAKER_02]: I will not owe you a date at all.

17:25.229 --> 17:26.550
[SPEAKER_10]: What was I supposed to give you if you win?

17:26.570 --> 17:27.070
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember.

17:27.350 --> 17:30.330
[SPEAKER_10]: You were supposed to... Oh, I have to take Nelly off your hands for a night.

17:30.490 --> 17:30.710
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

17:30.730 --> 17:31.270
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it was.

17:31.290 --> 17:32.010
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

17:32.111 --> 17:33.671
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywho, so it is...

17:35.250 --> 17:39.791
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been announced officially that it is going to come out in November on the 19th, I believe.

17:40.331 --> 17:45.013
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to feature, hooray, Zelda's crossbow training.

17:46.273 --> 17:54.275
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is going to be, I guess, exactly like the crossbow training that was in Twilight Princess.

17:54.395 --> 17:54.675
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray.

17:56.096 --> 17:57.556
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, for all over $20.

17:58.396 --> 18:01.157
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's some Jersey parents, though, that are...

18:01.952 --> 18:02.653
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

18:31.719 --> 18:33.480
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

18:51.764 --> 18:52.485
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

19:09.965 --> 19:11.806
[SPEAKER_10]: and, uh, hello, the Super Scope.

19:11.826 --> 19:12.467
[SPEAKER_10]: The Enforcer?

19:12.847 --> 19:16.209
[SPEAKER_08]: The Super Scope was a freakin' bazooka that you put on your shoulder.

19:16.229 --> 19:19.391
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember the lethal Enforcer's guns that looked like six-shooters?

19:19.511 --> 19:25.454
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though they were red and, you know, pink and blue, you know, they were still in full-on gun shape.

19:25.735 --> 19:26.795
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the Super Scope.

19:26.815 --> 19:28.896
[SPEAKER_08]: Why the fuck didn't the Super Scope do better?

19:29.277 --> 19:32.318
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because there were no good freakin' games for it.

19:32.438 --> 19:36.041
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I mean, it was a goddamn bazooka that you got to play with.

19:36.141 --> 19:36.461
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

19:37.265 --> 19:38.025
[SPEAKER_08]: I love my SuperScope.

19:38.045 --> 19:39.185
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you win up the competition.

19:39.265 --> 19:40.006
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we have a gun.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.366
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have a fucking bazooka.

19:41.906 --> 19:42.766
[SPEAKER_02]: Top that shit.

19:43.406 --> 19:45.007
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo's like, look, we'll whip it out.

19:45.047 --> 19:45.387
[SPEAKER_04]: Ours is bigger.

19:45.427 --> 19:47.547
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Sega's like, well, we have a half bazooka.

19:47.847 --> 19:49.067
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it the Menacer.

19:50.028 --> 19:52.408
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we also had the Activator, and we know how well that went.

19:52.548 --> 19:58.509
[SPEAKER_10]: So now parents are all getting pissed off at this Wii Zapper thing, which looks nothing like a gun.

19:58.569 --> 20:00.710
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it looks kinder.

20:00.890 --> 20:02.930
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a gun-shaped cookie cutter or something.

20:02.950 --> 20:03.551
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how to explain it.

20:03.571 --> 20:05.071
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was a gun, it would be a Tron prop.

20:05.091 --> 20:05.711
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

20:06.508 --> 20:09.411
[SPEAKER_02]: It's as much of a gun as a banana is a gun, okay?

20:09.451 --> 20:12.053
[SPEAKER_02]: That's seriously the Wii Zapper.

20:12.153 --> 20:15.736
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, I like this comment from Ranma in chat, chat.orangehallstradio.com.

20:16.056 --> 20:26.765
[SPEAKER_10]: Ranma says this, It simply amuses me that about 20 years ago when Nintendo first introduced the Zapper, the same soccer moms and dads that are protesting against it were playing these light gun games on the original NES.

20:27.126 --> 20:29.768
[SPEAKER_10]: If that's not the biggest form of hypocrisy, I don't know what is.

20:29.828 --> 20:30.969
[SPEAKER_10]: But hey, that's just me.

20:31.309 --> 20:32.089
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's something.

20:32.129 --> 20:34.030
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all these fucking parental guidance groups.

20:34.070 --> 20:43.934
[SPEAKER_02]: They fucking see a little headline or get, like, tipped off on something, and then they go ballistic about it without actually using said item or even knowing anything about it.

20:43.954 --> 20:47.755
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're pissed off at Bully when they knew, oh, my God, it's a game with bullies in it.

20:48.035 --> 20:49.356
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hate, hate, hate.

20:49.956 --> 20:56.178
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, they didn't know what the hell the game was, and it was, like, kind of promoting against bullying people.

20:56.778 --> 20:58.819
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just...

21:00.009 --> 21:05.052
[SPEAKER_02]: All you have to know is you don't need to listen to these people and nothing they ever do ever works anyway.

21:05.813 --> 21:07.974
[SPEAKER_02]: Their banning of games worked?

21:08.094 --> 21:08.194
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

21:09.781 --> 21:11.322
[SPEAKER_02]: It hurt anybody's sales?

21:11.422 --> 21:11.962
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

21:12.282 --> 21:13.503
[SPEAKER_04]: Has it helped sales?

21:13.563 --> 21:15.164
[SPEAKER_02]: Has it given more publicity and stuff?

21:15.224 --> 21:15.904
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it has.

21:16.004 --> 21:19.646
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are actually helping the sale of this stuff, you morons.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.507
[SPEAKER_10]: Escapist has a good question in chat, too.

21:21.567 --> 21:25.729
[SPEAKER_10]: Why aren't they protesting Big Buck Hunter, those deer hunting games in the front of every Walmart?

21:25.749 --> 21:31.052
[SPEAKER_02]: Or how about why aren't they protesting Time Crisis 4, which looks more like a gun than this thing?

21:32.433 --> 21:34.854
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's because the Wii, the Wii is a system for kids.

21:35.154 --> 21:36.435
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not, you morons.

21:37.461 --> 21:37.941
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

21:38.102 --> 21:40.544
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank God these crazies are in the minority, at least I hope so.

21:41.584 --> 21:47.730
[SPEAKER_10]: Those of you listening might notice that the rant levels seem to have gone through the roof on this story, and y'all know what that means.

21:53.574 --> 21:56.136
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time for the FUs of the week.

21:57.057 --> 21:57.438
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.

21:57.458 --> 21:57.658
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.

22:01.019 --> 22:07.745
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week has to go, I wouldn't really say so much towards PlayNC, but it has to go toward my copy of Guild Wars.

22:08.366 --> 22:13.991
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've been playing on the demo for a little while and I finally decided to open my box and install it on my PC.

22:14.452 --> 22:18.876
[SPEAKER_04]: Since I don't have World of Warcraft, not on my PC, but on my laptop, since I don't have World of Warcraft installed on here.

22:19.396 --> 22:22.739
[SPEAKER_04]: And until I have my PC rebuilt, I'm just going to stop paying for my World of Warcraft account.

22:23.220 --> 22:26.563
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, Guild Wars is free, I already have a character, I have a free box.

22:27.247 --> 22:34.110
[SPEAKER_04]: So I go to peel off the sticker so I can scratch off my ID, my access key, and the access key peels off with it.

22:35.151 --> 22:36.031
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of it did.

22:36.711 --> 22:38.652
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, well, shit.

22:39.573 --> 22:41.534
[SPEAKER_04]: And Heather, bless her, she helped me.

22:42.074 --> 22:44.015
[SPEAKER_04]: She got me my game for my birthday.

22:44.095 --> 22:46.816
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, and I'm finally installing it.

22:47.476 --> 22:54.840
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've gone through all of that time upgrading my Guild Wars and everything and downloading all the patches, which has so much better of a patch experience.

22:55.367 --> 23:04.272
[SPEAKER_04]: I sent in my request, I'd have to say around 7 o'clock on Thursday I had a response within an hour I had a second response 30 minutes after that

23:25.123 --> 23:29.006
[SPEAKER_04]: Friday, I got two more responses telling me that they were forwarding it to a different party.

23:29.347 --> 23:33.210
[SPEAKER_04]: They were keeping me informed at every step of the way, and that's really good customer service.

23:33.850 --> 23:39.856
[SPEAKER_04]: So, F you to the disc, but a thank you goes to PlayNC, except for being closed on the weekend.

23:41.837 --> 23:42.558
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the end.

23:42.618 --> 23:43.198
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

23:43.639 --> 23:45.901
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, fuck you too.

23:46.101 --> 23:47.462
[SPEAKER_02]: Stars in Vacaville.

23:47.562 --> 23:52.726
[SPEAKER_02]: My god, is that a whole bunch of ghetto wrapped into one ugly ass building.

23:53.147 --> 23:53.267
[SPEAKER_02]: And

23:53.965 --> 23:58.226
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, QZAR has really gone downhill there, as well as everything else there.

23:58.266 --> 24:02.287
[SPEAKER_02]: Their employees don't give a shit, and I don't give a shit either, and I will not be coming back.

24:04.028 --> 24:07.809
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's saying a lot, because the next QZAR is fucking 45 minutes away from that.

24:08.389 --> 24:10.889
[SPEAKER_10]: So, that depends on you.

24:12.350 --> 24:12.810
[SPEAKER_10]: My turn?

24:13.310 --> 24:13.470
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

24:14.189 --> 24:17.491
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll have to give an FU to the waffle place I ate breakfast at today.

24:17.791 --> 24:19.952
[SPEAKER_10]: Now don't get me wrong, waffles are awesome.

24:19.992 --> 24:21.813
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, waffles are God's food, okay?

24:21.853 --> 24:23.293
[SPEAKER_10]: Waffles are like the best thing ever.

24:23.373 --> 24:26.094
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, can anybody think of a better food than waffles?

24:26.615 --> 24:26.835
[SPEAKER_10]: No?

24:26.895 --> 24:27.615
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't think so.

24:27.975 --> 24:28.896
[SPEAKER_10]: Two waffles!

24:28.916 --> 24:30.897
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, two waffles!

24:31.077 --> 24:31.857
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing, though.

24:33.078 --> 24:39.901
[SPEAKER_10]: I did have a pretty... The reason why I give the place an FU is because they didn't have a peanut butter waffle on their menu.

24:40.261 --> 24:43.162
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, the competing waffle shop crossed town.

24:43.956 --> 24:44.596
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

25:12.642 --> 25:13.162
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

25:43.257 --> 25:49.300
[SPEAKER_04]: and the best hash browns ever because you can get them smothered, covered, chunked, cheese, everything on it.

25:49.340 --> 25:50.701
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, ah, sexy.

25:51.401 --> 25:58.584
[SPEAKER_04]: But I went to Waffle House and I came back with a hat and they wouldn't sell me a cup because I wanted a big coffee mug that said Waffle House on it.

26:00.866 --> 26:03.847
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to let people know, I'm going to Alabama in November.

26:04.487 --> 26:11.771
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be doing my usual Cyber Station in Mobile, Alabama run because I used to work at that freaking arcade and I hate it.

26:13.226 --> 26:14.647
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

26:41.844 --> 26:48.869
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing about me going to Cyber Station is that any new Namco arcade game that comes out, all the Namco arcades get it first.

26:49.430 --> 26:55.174
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I was in such a big tizzy to get to that one when I went a few years ago so I could go play Tekken 5.

26:56.175 --> 26:59.237
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, they got it like a couple of months before Golf Land did.

27:01.078 --> 27:03.280
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will not be going to New Orleans.

27:03.560 --> 27:04.881
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, that's too much of a drive.

27:05.381 --> 27:06.362
[SPEAKER_04]: I may be in Biloxi.

27:07.936 --> 27:18.654
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be in Dothan, Alabama and I will probably stop at the Tilt for about 5 minutes and leave to also kick a machine of your choosing if the Tilt is closed, I don't know if it's still at the mall

27:19.306 --> 27:19.846
[SPEAKER_04]: Beemaw, OnlyMaw.

27:19.906 --> 27:21.547
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully a listener will know and can email us.

27:21.767 --> 27:27.489
[SPEAKER_10]: But I was going to say, someday when we're rock stars, that should be how we go out on tour to promote things.

27:27.529 --> 27:33.531
[SPEAKER_10]: We should set up a time in an arcade for everybody to meet us there, and everybody can gather around a machine, and then we all walk in and kick it and leave.

27:33.832 --> 27:40.674
[SPEAKER_04]: I did go to a DDR tourney, and this is when we already had Max.

27:41.214 --> 27:44.395
[SPEAKER_04]: But their newest DDR machine that they had at this arcade in –

27:46.348 --> 27:48.049
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say it was at the Beau Ravage.

27:48.089 --> 27:49.770
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, of course, before Katrina hit.

27:50.451 --> 27:52.412
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a fifth mix.

27:53.333 --> 27:54.733
[SPEAKER_04]: And I went to meet up with people there.

27:55.014 --> 27:55.914
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a few years ago.

27:55.934 --> 27:58.056
[SPEAKER_04]: I made some cool friends, too.

27:59.837 --> 28:05.540
[SPEAKER_04]: But just also to let people know while I'm thinking about it, there's not going to be any more Pump Up the Volume until I get my computer replaced.

28:06.341 --> 28:07.742
[SPEAKER_04]: My computer died.

28:09.103 --> 28:09.443
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot.

28:10.764 --> 28:11.464
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'm done.

28:11.965 --> 28:12.445
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to hear it.

28:13.846 --> 28:14.066
[SPEAKER_10]: Well...

28:15.187 --> 28:18.350
[SPEAKER_10]: We got through our FUs of the week, minorly unscathed.

28:21.313 --> 28:24.056
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there any other traveling anybody's doing this year that should be noted?

28:25.217 --> 28:25.577
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

28:25.697 --> 28:26.939
[SPEAKER_02]: I know where I'm not going.

28:27.159 --> 28:28.220
[SPEAKER_10]: Where are you not going?

28:28.400 --> 28:30.182
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to E4ALL.

28:30.402 --> 28:30.742
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is that?

28:30.822 --> 28:32.284
[SPEAKER_10]: I still kind of want to go for E4ALL.

28:32.404 --> 28:34.546
[SPEAKER_10]: I have the week off work, but why is it that you don't want to go?

28:35.006 --> 28:39.911
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's like everything, everybody's canceled and it's also in LA and also the wife probably wouldn't let me anyways.

28:41.494 --> 28:46.218
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, it really, it's, you know, a long ways away.

28:46.299 --> 28:49.702
[SPEAKER_02]: If it were like in San Francisco or something like that, that'd be a little different.

28:49.762 --> 28:57.068
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, eight hours away for something that's, you know, progressively getting worse, I don't know.

28:57.389 --> 28:59.611
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not for me.

28:59.631 --> 28:59.951
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

29:00.031 --> 29:04.075
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of want to go to Network, you know, and see who I can meet and what have you, but we'll see.

29:04.954 --> 29:08.720
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, there is a brand new version of Winamp coming out.

29:08.760 --> 29:12.346
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of you guys left Winamp behind when you switched to iTunes to run with your iPod.

29:12.406 --> 29:14.209
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't touch that iTunes shit.

29:14.370 --> 29:15.612
[SPEAKER_04]: I flipped off iTunes.

29:15.712 --> 29:16.694
[SPEAKER_10]: In the Internet's...

29:17.213 --> 29:18.154
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

29:45.876 --> 29:53.903
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure exactly how it works yet, but I'm sure we will see more when the release of this comes out, which I'm not sure exactly when it's supposed to.

29:53.923 --> 29:56.385
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't seen a date on it, but I imagine it's later this year.

29:57.445 --> 29:58.066
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

29:58.502 --> 30:03.866
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was going to remind the chat room because it's been a while since we talked about the whole Altercade thing.

30:03.906 --> 30:19.579
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why you're supposed to kick an Altercade machine is because at one time other than the fact that it sucks, at one time the company that owns Altercade tried to register a trademark for or copyright or something for MAME and that's why.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.001
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though they didn't make any of that.

30:22.762 --> 30:25.604
[SPEAKER_04]: It was this big legal nightmare but Altercade sucks anyway.

30:27.465 --> 30:27.666
[SPEAKER_04]: So

30:28.832 --> 30:51.874
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, I guess, new news there, but old news for us, really, because we've had DDR in schools for a long time, is over in the UK they're using Dancing Stage, which is the version of Dance Dance Revolution over there, to combat childhood obesity.

30:53.031 --> 31:06.895
[SPEAKER_04]: There are trials that are done in Bedfordshire schools to see if people will play that, but they're targeting it towards girls who don't want to play sports, especially competitive sports.

31:06.955 --> 31:12.497
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's basically to help increase activities going on at school, and I think that's pretty cool.

31:14.218 --> 31:18.359
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I played DDR for a long time, and, you know, it's activity.

31:18.419 --> 31:19.379
[SPEAKER_04]: Activity is activity.

31:20.239 --> 31:20.660
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.

31:22.725 --> 31:23.546
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

31:24.346 --> 31:41.676
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say there's a brand new, of course we played a little bit, if you were listening to us live during the break, brand new album coming out from OC Remix, and it's Livestream, a tribute album to Final Fantasy VII, or Voices of the Livestream, I should say.

31:42.737 --> 31:45.939
[SPEAKER_02]: It is four discs, huge, completely free.

31:46.079 --> 31:47.440
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a 2.32 gigabyte torrent

31:49.525 --> 32:06.933
[SPEAKER_02]: for it available, and it's split up, I guess, into their four different universes, Crisis Core, Jersey Service, Advent Children, and Last Order, and features a bunch of awesome music, 45 tracks including, and features the work of 42 different remixers.

32:08.654 --> 32:11.175
[SPEAKER_02]: So, freaking awesome.

32:11.396 --> 32:12.156
[SPEAKER_02]: Download it now.

32:12.236 --> 32:16.518
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll actually play a couple clips here, just some real quick clips here on the show, so you can hear what some of this

32:16.854 --> 32:18.135
[SPEAKER_10]: This is one we played during the break.

32:18.195 --> 32:22.097
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a Jenova remix called Jenova Celestial by Blind.

32:36.045 --> 32:36.445
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that.

32:36.485 --> 32:37.745
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all like techno-y and stuff.

32:37.846 --> 32:45.110
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a Chocobo remix called Que, Electric de Chocobo, which is by an artist named Durangan.

32:45.290 --> 32:45.810
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's a little clip.

32:57.583 --> 32:58.643
[SPEAKER_10]: Full Frontal Assault Pretty rad.

33:23.908 --> 33:24.549
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkDragon

33:38.803 --> 33:45.266
[SPEAKER_10]: One game that you don't use custom soundtracks for, though, is Guitar Hero 3, and certainly it seems like every week we're hearing about some new songs in the game.

33:45.646 --> 33:55.870
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, get this, if a recent post on Score Hero that came up and then was taken down not even two minutes later is to be believed, the full song list for Guitar Hero 3 has leaked.

33:56.390 --> 34:01.232
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole fact that it was up and then taken down right away certainly seems to make it look like that it was...

34:02.561 --> 34:02.981
[SPEAKER_10]: Removed.

34:03.021 --> 34:06.482
[SPEAKER_10]: And you'll have to forgive me because I don't remember exactly what has been announced and what's not.

34:06.762 --> 34:08.402
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do notice some interesting stuff here.

34:08.442 --> 34:10.883
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I remember that Tom Morello was announced as a boss.

34:11.603 --> 34:14.024
[SPEAKER_10]: But Rage Against the Machine has Bulls on Parade in there.

34:14.324 --> 34:15.964
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, that's a pretty awesome guitar song.

34:16.484 --> 34:18.005
[SPEAKER_10]: And let's see, what else caught my eye here?

34:19.325 --> 34:21.585
[SPEAKER_10]: Tenacious D's in there, but I think they were announced for that before.

34:21.685 --> 34:23.226
[SPEAKER_10]: Guns N' Roses, Welcome to the Jungle.

34:23.926 --> 34:25.846
[SPEAKER_10]: Aerosmith, same old song and dance.

34:25.906 --> 34:27.747
[SPEAKER_10]: So Aerosmith might actually be Guitar Hero 3.

34:28.127 --> 34:28.527
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we heard...

34:29.705 --> 34:31.807
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess, what was this one that says Boss Lou Guitar Battle?

34:31.827 --> 34:32.848
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

34:32.888 --> 34:33.608
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who Lou would be.

34:33.628 --> 34:33.969
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

35:01.916 --> 35:02.737
[SPEAKER_10]: Lou Reed, maybe?

35:02.837 --> 35:03.277
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

35:03.618 --> 35:05.259
[SPEAKER_02]: Disturbed, stricken, that's kind of cool.

35:05.419 --> 35:06.720
[SPEAKER_02]: Where does it say Lou?

35:06.800 --> 35:07.340
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I don't know.

35:07.981 --> 35:09.282
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's an in-game character.

35:09.322 --> 35:09.662
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

35:10.403 --> 35:10.663
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

35:12.484 --> 35:14.045
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know my guitar heroes, apparently.

35:14.065 --> 35:15.206
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to see if there's anything else.

35:15.226 --> 35:17.588
[SPEAKER_10]: But now again, this is a rumored list, so we don't know for sure.

35:17.608 --> 35:19.909
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

35:19.930 --> 35:22.171
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks pretty official to me.

35:22.231 --> 35:24.573
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it looks pretty convincing.

35:24.913 --> 35:25.293
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

35:25.534 --> 35:25.914
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

35:26.674 --> 35:27.455
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the game's out.

35:27.975 --> 35:28.155
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

35:28.476 --> 35:28.856
[SPEAKER_10]: Next month?

35:29.672 --> 35:31.154
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the end of next month, the 31st.

35:31.374 --> 35:33.295
[SPEAKER_02]: Halloween!

35:33.496 --> 35:34.456
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no, I take that back.

35:34.637 --> 35:36.198
[SPEAKER_02]: The 28th is when it's coming out.

35:36.278 --> 35:36.758
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunday.

35:37.659 --> 35:40.221
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, they're doing a weekend release because they can.

35:40.822 --> 35:41.102
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

35:41.623 --> 35:44.445
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, we're going to do the mailbag segment now because we can.

35:44.765 --> 35:45.586
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what we want to do.

35:45.686 --> 35:47.308
[SPEAKER_10]: And every week you guys send us emails.

35:47.348 --> 35:53.333
[SPEAKER_10]: And DarkSakura picks a few of her favorites and reads them live on air and then makes fun of them as well when she feels like it.

35:54.278 --> 35:56.860
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag at OrangeZonesRadio.com is the place to send those emails.

35:57.420 --> 35:58.321
[SPEAKER_10]: So open up the mailbag.

35:58.781 --> 36:00.842
[SPEAKER_10]: Dive in, DarkSakura.

36:00.982 --> 36:02.203
[SPEAKER_04]: What's in there?

36:03.084 --> 36:03.804
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, guys.

36:03.864 --> 36:04.305
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

36:04.525 --> 36:08.487
[SPEAKER_04]: This is FoodieMonster from Argentina, and this is probably my first email to you guys.

36:08.968 --> 36:14.891
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I won't make it long since I've been known to call into the show a few times, so I'm not scared of the sky plane to make any long-winded rants.

36:15.492 --> 36:20.155
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason to this email is to send you guys a picture of the game Drawn to Life for the DS.

36:21.152 --> 36:25.113
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe you guys don't know this game, which got released on September 11th, I believe, so it's new.

36:25.453 --> 36:30.755
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a cutesy game and would be well-defined as a weird hybrid between Zelda Adventure Island, Mario, and Sonic.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.076
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I know, it all seems to be all over the place.

36:33.776 --> 36:46.200
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, the point is that the gimmick of this game is that you basically draw everything, and not just lines, no, I mean full-blown things, from clouds you step on, to the sled you ride on on one of the levels, to the gun you wield, to the main character.

36:47.560 --> 36:49.040
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I wanted to show you guys.

36:49.060 --> 36:55.442
[SPEAKER_04]: In the pictures that I've attached, I made one of OLR's and Jamie's favorite, a playable character, a cute pyramid head.

36:56.462 --> 37:00.123
[SPEAKER_04]: The pictures do speak for themselves, and I wish there was a way you could show the listeners as well.

37:00.504 --> 37:04.305
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe point the Operator 11 camera at the computer screen or something.

37:04.485 --> 37:05.605
[SPEAKER_10]: Too late, Op 11 died.

37:05.805 --> 37:10.226
[SPEAKER_04]: But I thought it was pretty funny, especially when the townspeople said, Oh, Pyramid H, go to rescue little Miwa.

37:10.826 --> 37:15.848
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole time I pictured a pyramid head ripping said little girl to shreds with a giant meat cleaver, and that made me L.O.L.,

37:16.952 --> 37:19.974
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, I'll wrap this up and let you guys continue through the mailbag.

37:20.174 --> 37:21.975
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care and keep up the great work as usual.

37:22.575 --> 37:23.336
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's cute.

37:23.416 --> 37:24.536
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the little pyramid head.

37:24.677 --> 37:27.978
[SPEAKER_10]: I peeked in the mailbag as well to pull out the pictures.

37:28.439 --> 37:29.099
[SPEAKER_10]: That is cute.

37:29.820 --> 37:31.881
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is great radio, but maybe Footy.

37:31.901 --> 37:33.762
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Footy's in chat tonight, so maybe he can share.

37:33.802 --> 37:35.203
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, he just posted his photo bucket there.

37:35.223 --> 37:35.663
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Footy.

37:35.963 --> 37:36.303
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

37:36.603 --> 37:37.584
[SPEAKER_10]: That was awesome radio.

37:37.644 --> 37:38.965
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, pictures make for great radio.

37:38.985 --> 37:40.626
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the cutest thing ever.

37:41.426 --> 37:42.027
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.

37:42.707 --> 37:43.808
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God, he's adorable.

37:43.888 --> 37:44.308
[SPEAKER_04]: I want one.

37:45.140 --> 37:46.401
[SPEAKER_04]: I want my own Pyramid Heddy.

37:47.501 --> 37:47.921
[SPEAKER_04]: P-Hiddy.

37:48.001 --> 37:48.421
[SPEAKER_10]: P-Hiddy.

37:48.541 --> 37:48.941
[SPEAKER_04]: P-Hiddy.

37:49.062 --> 37:50.002
[SPEAKER_04]: We call him P-Hiddy.

37:51.643 --> 37:52.603
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to look at the other picture.

37:52.703 --> 37:54.284
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, he's so cute!

37:55.104 --> 37:55.384
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

37:56.544 --> 37:58.605
[SPEAKER_04]: So moving on.

38:00.446 --> 38:08.629
[SPEAKER_04]: So from Gray Fox, we have an email.

38:09.517 --> 38:10.338
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, OLR gang.

38:10.358 --> 38:14.401
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been listening to your podcast for a couple months now and would like to say that I love your show.

38:14.481 --> 38:20.446
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with many others who have commented that it is the hilarious interactions between all three of you that make this show unique.

38:21.227 --> 38:26.591
[SPEAKER_04]: I had about a four-year hiatus of gaming because of being enrolled in university and did not have much time for video games.

38:27.071 --> 38:31.895
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I have graduated, I have more time to play, so I got myself a PS2 Slimline, and I'm loving it so far.

38:32.356 --> 38:39.001
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering if it were possible to have a section on the show dedicated to great last-gen games.

38:39.597 --> 38:48.140
[SPEAKER_04]: I find there are many people who cannot afford to get involved in the next gen gaming and there are still many great games, Metal Gear Solid series, God of War, Beautiful Joe, etc.

38:48.780 --> 38:55.622
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now I rely on IGN for my game recommendations but I am afraid that some games might still be great but get a lower score.

38:55.782 --> 38:57.582
[SPEAKER_04]: Any help would be great, keep up the good work.

38:59.063 --> 39:05.245
[SPEAKER_04]: I would suggest for good PS2 games, definitely the Metal Gear series.

39:07.791 --> 39:08.292
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but...

39:33.029 --> 39:38.033
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as the last gen game goes, they're still making some good stuff for PlayStation 2.

39:38.433 --> 39:43.737
[SPEAKER_10]: Final Fantasy XII came out amongst all the new consoles and kind of got lost, but it's a freaking great RPG.

39:44.157 --> 39:50.462
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know a lot of folks in chat have been yapping about Persona 3, which is also supposed to be a really good one.

39:50.482 --> 39:51.683
[SPEAKER_04]: I still need to play the demo.

39:51.783 --> 39:53.504
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been busy.

39:53.744 --> 39:54.064
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I know.

39:54.104 --> 39:57.727
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to play the full game at some point, but there's so many games out there to play right now.

39:58.514 --> 40:02.456
[SPEAKER_10]: So certainly PS2 still has a bunch of crack going out for it.

40:02.776 --> 40:06.558
[SPEAKER_10]: And I even want to go way back to some of the games that were released earlier on.

40:06.718 --> 40:11.660
[SPEAKER_10]: I still want to catch up on the .hack series because I actually enjoyed the games, the little bits I played of them.

40:11.700 --> 40:12.960
[SPEAKER_10]: There's just a lot to them.

40:13.320 --> 40:18.222
[SPEAKER_10]: So ironically enough, we talked about in Part 8 tonight, Jamie's going to have a Classic Game of the Week segment.

40:18.242 --> 40:21.264
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe once in a while you can have a PS2 game or something in there.

40:21.304 --> 40:21.964
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know what?

40:21.984 --> 40:24.065
[SPEAKER_10]: Space Channel 5.

40:24.105 --> 40:24.525
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, good times.

40:24.545 --> 40:26.046
[SPEAKER_04]: They did a double release of 1 and 2.

40:27.239 --> 40:27.759
[SPEAKER_04]: Amplitude, Frequency

40:52.275 --> 40:54.897
[SPEAKER_10]: Guitar Hero I am moving forward, prepare to fast forward

41:12.242 --> 41:15.083
[SPEAKER_04]: But the area I'm at, really awesome.

41:15.683 --> 41:17.423
[SPEAKER_04]: A few things I'd like to say if you don't mind.

41:17.503 --> 41:21.964
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, I know you're not a big fan of anime, but I've heard you go on about how awesome Blue Dragon is.

41:22.284 --> 41:24.765
[SPEAKER_04]: In case you haven't heard, there's an anime based on the game now.

41:24.825 --> 41:25.565
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my question.

41:25.945 --> 41:29.606
[SPEAKER_04]: If there was a game that you liked also had an anime to it, would you watch it as well?

41:29.766 --> 41:32.427
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and Jamie, I've seen the first episode, and it's pretty good.

41:32.487 --> 41:33.127
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a must-see.

41:33.367 --> 41:34.567
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have to download that then.

41:35.667 --> 41:42.479
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I will say this, so far, sorry, I know the email's not done, but just to get that part out of the way, I don't think Blue Dragon is, like, OMG awesome.

41:43.602 --> 41:47.683
[SPEAKER_10]: Blue Dragon is better than a lot of people say it is, I think.

41:47.903 --> 41:51.404
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a Super Nintendo RPG with next-gen graphics.

41:51.444 --> 41:52.324
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what Blue Dragon is.

41:52.484 --> 41:53.044
[SPEAKER_10]: Take it or leave it.

41:54.564 --> 41:55.544
[SPEAKER_10]: Would I watch the anime?

41:55.565 --> 41:55.865
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

41:56.205 --> 41:57.005
[SPEAKER_10]: I've heard it's out there.

41:57.025 --> 41:58.525
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I've seen it on YouTube.

41:58.565 --> 41:59.745
[SPEAKER_10]: I just haven't sat down to watch it.

42:00.085 --> 42:03.746
[SPEAKER_10]: But I did watch an episode of Final Fantasy Unlimited just because I liked Final Fantasy.

42:03.846 --> 42:06.127
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy Unlimited was a very strange series.

42:06.567 --> 42:10.928
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't watch the whole thing, but I will if I'm into it enough.

42:10.948 --> 42:12.588
[SPEAKER_04]: I still need to finish Death Note, okay?

42:13.605 --> 42:14.866
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, Rob, another question.

42:14.926 --> 42:16.087
[SPEAKER_04]: The New York chapter of the O.L.

42:16.127 --> 42:18.129
[SPEAKER_04]: Army wants to know if you're going to Digital Life.

42:18.749 --> 42:23.073
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you said you were thinking about it because you have a credit with JetBlue, but not much has been said.

42:23.113 --> 42:26.035
[SPEAKER_04]: Would love it if you came out to New York City again because we all love you.

42:26.615 --> 42:33.000
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought I'd clarified this on a previous show, but perhaps some folks were out or maybe I said it on an off-recorded break or something.

42:33.020 --> 42:36.283
[SPEAKER_10]: But unfortunately, due to a conflict, I cannot make it out there for Digital Life.

42:36.343 --> 42:37.864
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very sorry to the New York folks.

42:38.291 --> 42:39.032
[SPEAKER_10]: However, you're right.

42:39.092 --> 42:42.074
[SPEAKER_10]: I still have that credit from JetBlue, and I've got to use it before June or it goes away.

42:42.134 --> 42:44.476
[SPEAKER_10]: So you bet you're going to see me out there in the spring for something.

42:44.956 --> 42:45.317
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll see.

42:45.817 --> 42:46.297
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

42:46.798 --> 42:48.159
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let me move forward.

42:48.219 --> 42:54.184
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, this email is from our Ron-chan in the chat room, who always makes me squee.

42:55.605 --> 42:59.988
[SPEAKER_04]: So moving forward, speaking of East Coast – oh, no, we've already done that one.

43:01.129 --> 43:01.890
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, have I done that?

43:01.910 --> 43:02.250
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I haven't.

43:02.530 --> 43:06.774
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of the East Coast, Rob, you've jokingly said that if we fly OLR out to a con, you would all go.

43:07.409 --> 43:13.517
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't do that, but I can try to get you, Jamie, and Matt to discount some flights if you three can come to anime next to local con in Jersey.

43:15.820 --> 43:16.981
[SPEAKER_04]: He's offering us to stay.

43:17.001 --> 43:18.503
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think we could make something like that?

43:19.659 --> 43:20.439
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we'll consider.

43:20.520 --> 43:24.822
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have a resource we can tap into to maybe make that happen.

43:25.462 --> 43:27.764
[SPEAKER_10]: It would just be also, though, our personal calendars.

43:28.744 --> 43:30.785
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't forget, Orange Entretien, we don't get paid for doing this.

43:30.805 --> 43:31.726
[SPEAKER_10]: This isn't our jobs.

43:31.906 --> 43:32.986
[SPEAKER_10]: So we all have jobs.

43:33.066 --> 43:34.247
[SPEAKER_10]: And Jamie goes to school.

43:34.707 --> 43:35.608
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki's married.

43:36.308 --> 43:40.210
[SPEAKER_10]: So sometimes our personal lives keep us at home, not just so much the fact that we're poor.

43:40.531 --> 43:43.372
[SPEAKER_10]: But we do have a money resource we can tap into, and we appreciate the offer.

43:44.353 --> 43:45.153
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing, though.

43:46.314 --> 43:48.495
[SPEAKER_10]: If we're going to go to a con and make that kind of trip for it,

43:48.925 --> 43:49.945
[SPEAKER_10]: I still love you, Ranma!

44:09.355 --> 44:10.035
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, where was I?

44:11.657 --> 44:16.940
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, more good news, I've decided not to get a Wii now because my friends around me have one, including my own roommate.

44:17.360 --> 44:19.422
[SPEAKER_04]: I've decided to get an Xbox 360 instead.

44:19.882 --> 44:28.227
[SPEAKER_04]: Despite the three-year warranty Microsoft has given them, opting for the two-year replacement plan because I'd rather spend the extra cash to have it replaced the same day at my local Best Buy.

44:28.648 --> 44:32.650
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm planning to purchase it February 08 when they should have the 65mm chips in it.

44:34.910 --> 44:39.034
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that you all know I'm buying one, I'm really fickle about buying games.

44:39.134 --> 44:41.536
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like each of you to recommend one game I should get.

44:41.936 --> 44:43.757
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't suggest Rumble Roses XX.

44:43.777 --> 44:46.960
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm already planning on buying that.

44:48.201 --> 44:49.142
[SPEAKER_04]: Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

44:51.824 --> 44:52.765
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody's getting a text message.

44:52.785 --> 44:54.046
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably sauce.

44:54.226 --> 44:55.667
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't text message break up.

44:55.687 --> 44:57.028
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably sauce.

44:57.929 --> 44:58.770
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, what was the question?

44:59.170 --> 45:00.231
[SPEAKER_10]: Cheap Xbox 360 games?

45:00.331 --> 45:02.553
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, just an Xbox 360 game that you would suggest buying.

45:03.395 --> 45:04.438
[SPEAKER_10]: Blue Dragon, Enchanted Arms,

45:10.134 --> 45:11.575
[SPEAKER_02]: because Enchanted Arms also wasn't bad.

45:11.595 --> 45:13.276
[SPEAKER_02]: Enchanted Arms is like dirt cheap now.

45:13.696 --> 45:18.018
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you have a PlayStation 3, it's really dirt cheap.

45:18.058 --> 45:19.759
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to try an RPG, opt for Enchanted Arms.

45:19.799 --> 45:21.239
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not as bad as people made it out to be.

45:22.240 --> 45:28.583
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can get through the first couple hours, which are a little rough, especially if it really starts to get into it, I don't think it was a bad game.

45:28.863 --> 45:29.964
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, it wasn't a great game.

45:30.004 --> 45:36.447
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still waiting for the freaking great blow-your-hair-back RPG on the Xbox 360, which I'm hoping is Eternal Sonata.

45:37.566 --> 45:38.507
[SPEAKER_04]: But I shouldn't hold my breath.

45:38.747 --> 45:40.708
[SPEAKER_04]: Marvel Ultimate Alliance, that's all I have to say.

45:40.968 --> 45:42.289
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

45:45.711 --> 45:45.951
[SPEAKER_04]: Uno.

45:46.471 --> 45:46.752
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

45:47.872 --> 45:49.153
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, don't forget the arcade, actually.

45:49.193 --> 45:53.416
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, make sure that you get Castlevania.

45:53.696 --> 45:58.999
[SPEAKER_04]: That's also, it looks kind of, actually the double dragon is so funny because it's all high res.

45:59.319 --> 46:01.180
[SPEAKER_04]: And to me, it just doesn't look the same.

46:01.540 --> 46:02.301
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not as cool to me.

46:03.948 --> 46:04.949
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, next part.

46:05.049 --> 46:06.930
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Jamie, I had my housewarming last night.

46:07.290 --> 46:08.331
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get any Guinness.

46:08.371 --> 46:08.852
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

46:08.932 --> 46:09.232
[SPEAKER_04]: Tear.

46:09.572 --> 46:17.237
[SPEAKER_04]: But we did have other alcoholic beverages, and I did a 151 shot for you, which reminds me of how much I loved hanging out with you at Faname.

46:17.257 --> 46:17.297
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw.

46:17.938 --> 46:20.680
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I've said it several times already, but you truly made me feel at home.

46:20.800 --> 46:23.962
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait to come back out there, not to calm, but to relax and have a good time.

46:23.982 --> 46:24.983
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's so sweet.

46:25.864 --> 46:27.985
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, definitely, you've got crashing space.

46:29.646 --> 46:30.807
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely have crashing space.

46:30.867 --> 46:31.447
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, what?

46:31.648 --> 46:33.109
[SPEAKER_04]: I want us to come back out and hang out.

46:33.349 --> 46:33.449
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

46:33.888 --> 46:34.448
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

46:34.568 --> 46:34.829
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

46:35.849 --> 46:38.150
[SPEAKER_04]: And, okay, I'm almost done with the email.

46:38.590 --> 46:41.232
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of fun times, all of OLR me is on notice.

46:41.372 --> 46:46.455
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be back for Fonamay 2009 Prayer Commitments for 08, and it will be OLRCon.

46:46.575 --> 46:49.096
[SPEAKER_04]: Two suites full of OLR fans just going insane.

46:50.016 --> 46:57.921
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and for the record, the fag, fancy articulate guy's comment from last week was made by my friend Patty, not by me, and she rocks hard.

46:59.221 --> 47:00.682
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember you commented on that, Rob?

47:01.640 --> 47:03.482
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember there was the fancy.

47:03.702 --> 47:04.763
[SPEAKER_04]: Articulate guys.

47:05.083 --> 47:05.784
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, whatever.

47:07.285 --> 47:07.985
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it is starting to get warm.

47:08.005 --> 47:09.186
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to have to open the door pretty soon.

47:09.206 --> 47:10.347
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that's it for now.

47:11.528 --> 47:15.631
[SPEAKER_04]: I had more topics to comment on, but I forgot what I was going to say about them.

47:16.071 --> 47:18.133
[SPEAKER_04]: But keep up the good work and don't stop believing.

47:18.253 --> 47:18.974
[SPEAKER_04]: Wink face.

47:19.814 --> 47:21.836
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, proud member of the LOL Army since 2003.

47:21.996 --> 47:23.637
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a long email.

47:24.558 --> 47:25.219
[SPEAKER_04]: Last email.

47:25.499 --> 47:25.739
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

47:26.075 --> 47:28.196
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, OLR, Nintendo Maniac 64 here.

47:28.316 --> 47:30.458
[SPEAKER_04]: For math class, I'm doing a survey-like thing.

47:30.818 --> 47:31.518
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very simple.

47:31.658 --> 47:37.002
[SPEAKER_04]: I need you to list your preference of which of the following game systems from one best to four worst.

47:37.582 --> 47:41.144
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii, the 360, PlayStation 3, and the PC.

47:41.665 --> 47:43.146
[SPEAKER_04]: Emulators and ROMs do not count.

47:44.747 --> 47:46.728
[SPEAKER_04]: And then... Oh, he just wants to send an email.

47:46.868 --> 47:47.488
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, never mind.

47:47.528 --> 47:48.669
[SPEAKER_04]: He's wanting us to do his poll.

47:49.069 --> 47:49.770
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm curious.

47:49.830 --> 47:51.050
[SPEAKER_04]: What of the four do you think is best?

47:51.331 --> 47:51.911
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, lordy.

47:52.011 --> 47:54.413
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just setting myself up for fanboy backlash.

47:54.813 --> 47:54.913
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

47:57.481 --> 48:04.043
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go strictly in terms of based on what's available and what I play and where my time goes based on that.

48:04.083 --> 48:09.444
[SPEAKER_10]: Because our golden rule, we haven't said it a long time on this show, so let me reiterate the golden rule of gaming.

48:10.364 --> 48:13.985
[SPEAKER_10]: A console is only as good as the games that are on it.

48:14.325 --> 48:17.506
[SPEAKER_10]: So that being said, I would say the Xbox 360 is number one.

48:18.086 --> 48:19.327
[SPEAKER_10]: PC is number two.

48:19.887 --> 48:20.807
[SPEAKER_10]: Wii is number three.

48:21.724 --> 48:22.884
[SPEAKER_10]: PlayStation 3 is number four.

48:23.205 --> 48:24.865
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with that.

48:25.005 --> 48:25.666
[SPEAKER_10]: But let me put this.

48:26.186 --> 48:35.929
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, based on the goal, again, based on the golden rule of gaming, like Xbox 360, PC, and Wii, well, I would say Xbox 360 and PC are really close to the top.

48:36.310 --> 48:38.510
[SPEAKER_10]: Wii down a little bit, but still near the top.

48:38.530 --> 48:39.171
[SPEAKER_04]: It's getting there.

48:39.351 --> 48:40.331
[SPEAKER_10]: Big gap.

48:41.512 --> 48:42.752
[SPEAKER_10]: And then PlayStation 3 at the bottom.

48:43.132 --> 48:47.454
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, being that I have a PS3 and have a bunch of games for it,

48:48.625 --> 48:51.668
[SPEAKER_04]: The only game I played on that one regularly was Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

48:51.928 --> 48:55.893
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that I have it on Xbox 360, I'm like, well, why?

48:56.433 --> 48:56.934
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the point?

48:57.254 --> 49:03.902
[SPEAKER_04]: I can actually play it and not have to shake my controller around like an idiot and look like I'm having a seizure trying to do the underwater level.

49:04.322 --> 49:04.903
[SPEAKER_04]: So screw it.

49:06.519 --> 49:08.981
[SPEAKER_02]: You know you don't need to flail your arms around a lot.

49:09.041 --> 49:10.282
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just do it with your wrist.

49:10.322 --> 49:11.002
[SPEAKER_10]: She likes to flail.

49:11.022 --> 49:12.903
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but I hate it.

49:13.143 --> 49:14.644
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, what would be your list?

49:16.386 --> 49:17.426
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about PC.

49:17.506 --> 49:19.347
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't play a lot of PC stuff.

49:19.408 --> 49:25.151
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say probably, well, 360 because there's just a lot of games on it.

49:27.033 --> 49:28.033
[SPEAKER_02]: Wii is hard.

49:28.093 --> 49:31.776
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a lot of games out there, but I don't play it a lot.

49:31.896 --> 49:33.637
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually, I would say probably...

49:34.875 --> 49:38.038
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to put the PlayStation... I guess I'd say the same list as you, Rob.

49:38.258 --> 49:43.363
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing is, you know, I don't play a lot of PC games because my computer sucks.

49:43.483 --> 49:43.744
[SPEAKER_02]: And then...

49:44.912 --> 49:47.675
[SPEAKER_02]: PC Gaming PC Gaming PC Gaming PC Gaming

50:08.233 --> 50:10.474
[SPEAKER_10]: Big time sink games for me.

50:10.955 --> 50:14.257
[SPEAKER_10]: When he added up, I actually probably do more gaming on the PC than anywhere else.

50:14.517 --> 50:19.079
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised, though, Mac wasn't number one on there because I would have thought that Mac would be on there.

50:19.660 --> 50:20.060
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.

50:20.080 --> 50:21.140
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't one of the options.

50:21.220 --> 50:21.981
[SPEAKER_02]: My mistake.

50:22.241 --> 50:22.761
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shut up.

50:22.781 --> 50:23.201
[SPEAKER_10]: No games.

50:23.602 --> 50:24.142
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

50:24.282 --> 50:24.562
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

50:24.882 --> 50:26.623
[SPEAKER_10]: Any more to that email, DarkSakra?

50:26.743 --> 50:27.564
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it for the mailbag.

50:28.084 --> 50:28.304
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

50:28.364 --> 50:31.386
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

50:33.287 --> 50:34.468
[SPEAKER_10]: Until then, more news.

50:34.688 --> 50:35.068
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, Logie?

50:36.131 --> 50:38.333
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course I have tons of news for you.

50:38.753 --> 50:46.019
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so yeah, there's... I'm pulling up different stories now.

50:46.700 --> 50:56.247
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, there's some interesting rumors going around about the Metal Gear Solid movie, one of which is that Christian Bale is up for the role for Solid Snake himself.

50:56.988 --> 50:58.749
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'd be pretty interesting.

50:58.769 --> 51:01.451
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's from...

51:03.087 --> 51:32.676
[SPEAKER_02]: UK magazine called Nuts which I'm not really sure if I would I don't know how that would really rate there but they say he's in the running to play Salt Snake for the 2009 movie Metal Gear Solid and of course I don't know that's a big fat rumor I think I don't know I don't know if he'd look good as Snake though can't see him as Snake

51:33.868 --> 51:36.510
[SPEAKER_04]: They need someone who's a lot more hardcore.

51:36.750 --> 51:38.191
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if Tom Selleck were younger.

51:39.391 --> 51:40.492
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no.

51:40.832 --> 51:42.653
[SPEAKER_04]: If Kurt Russell were younger.

51:42.673 --> 51:43.654
[SPEAKER_02]: Kurt Russell, yeah.

51:44.214 --> 51:45.054
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Kurt Russell.

51:45.115 --> 51:46.335
[SPEAKER_04]: Kurt Russell would be able to do it.

51:46.695 --> 51:47.516
[SPEAKER_02]: He could play Old Snake.

51:48.336 --> 51:49.437
[SPEAKER_04]: Or even Richard Dean Anderson.

51:50.698 --> 51:51.018
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

51:51.118 --> 51:58.082
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you saw him in... No, I'm thinking of two people who played the same character in Stargate.

51:59.963 --> 52:00.263
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

52:01.784 --> 52:02.104
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

52:02.945 --> 52:03.205
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

52:03.883 --> 52:04.563
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Stargate.

52:04.823 --> 52:05.124
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

52:31.094 --> 52:31.474
[SPEAKER_10]: Not really.

52:31.774 --> 52:37.716
[SPEAKER_10]: But they'll just kind of be using the PlayStation branding to try and launch a possible... I'm sorry.

52:37.976 --> 52:39.376
[SPEAKER_10]: There is not a gaming phone.

52:39.416 --> 52:39.936
[SPEAKER_10]: I should say this.

52:39.956 --> 52:42.497
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no PSP phone slash thing or whatever.

52:42.897 --> 52:52.139
[SPEAKER_10]: But since Ericsson and PlayStation are under the same corporate entity, Sony, why not explore the possibilities of what could happen?

52:53.519 --> 52:53.939
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

52:54.039 --> 52:56.920
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to just bring out the freaking Vodafones over here and leave it at that.

52:58.380 --> 52:58.580
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

52:59.062 --> 53:00.043
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting a Blackberry.

53:00.063 --> 53:01.744
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's going to be revised so many times.

53:02.464 --> 53:03.305
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting a Blackberry.

53:03.325 --> 53:03.945
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting a Blackberry.

53:03.985 --> 53:04.106
[SPEAKER_10]: I am.

53:23.519 --> 53:34.608
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, for anyone who is interested in interesting ways of announcing games or hinting at games or starting weirdo rumors anyway.

53:35.929 --> 53:46.378
[SPEAKER_04]: For the demo for Tony Hawk Proving Ground, there is a poster that shows a sequel for Gun Magruder's Ghost.

53:48.219 --> 53:49.140
[SPEAKER_04]: So, is it a rumor?

53:49.240 --> 53:49.840
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a tease?

53:49.880 --> 53:50.921
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it wishful thinking?

53:51.201 --> 53:53.043
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it someone just trying to make it funny?

53:54.042 --> 53:57.544
[SPEAKER_04]: and Madden and what not.

54:19.620 --> 54:23.664
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, this is kind of a little 180 of normal news.

54:24.084 --> 54:29.269
[SPEAKER_02]: Conan, the game that was supposed to be coming out at the end of October, got bumped up into September.

54:29.389 --> 54:34.494
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, now it's coming out the week of September 28th to compete with Halo.

54:34.635 --> 54:35.155
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray!

54:35.215 --> 54:42.082
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the smartest move, but it's nice to see that the game's actually going to be coming out earlier than expected.

54:43.011 --> 54:47.133
[SPEAKER_02]: It is going to be kind of a hack and slash action game.

54:47.653 --> 54:48.713
[SPEAKER_02]: Similar to God of War.

54:48.773 --> 54:49.634
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of blood.

54:49.674 --> 54:51.114
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's full frontal nudity.

54:51.174 --> 54:53.295
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hey, that's got two things that I need.

54:53.415 --> 54:56.376
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's probably going to guarantee a sale.

54:56.456 --> 54:56.796
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

54:57.737 --> 54:59.317
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't get enough games with nudity.

54:59.917 --> 55:01.198
[SPEAKER_10]: We need more games with nudity.

55:01.258 --> 55:02.158
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn straight.

55:02.318 --> 55:04.699
[SPEAKER_10]: That aren't like niche nudity games.

55:05.279 --> 55:06.540
[SPEAKER_10]: Manhunt 2 is supposed to have lots.

55:06.760 --> 55:08.221
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a whole S&M club, I guess.

55:08.981 --> 55:11.102
[SPEAKER_10]: Like Playboy Mansion or whatever.

55:11.122 --> 55:12.042
[SPEAKER_10]: That's niche nudity.

55:12.472 --> 55:15.325
[SPEAKER_10]: I want like, you know, hardcore nudity in mainstream games.

55:17.469 --> 55:19.530
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that too much to ask for?

55:20.191 --> 55:22.032
[SPEAKER_02]: BMX XXX was great.

55:22.152 --> 55:22.853
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an awesome game.

55:22.893 --> 55:23.933
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a bad game, though.

55:23.973 --> 55:25.535
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but it's... It was not a bad game.

55:25.655 --> 55:26.395
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.

55:26.455 --> 55:34.200
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, like, Dave mirrored his BMX, and it just had, like, weird shit, like, you know, impress a dog so it gets horny and fucks another dog.

55:34.541 --> 55:37.363
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just weird shit, but it was just excuses for you to do tricks and stuff.

55:37.403 --> 55:38.563
[SPEAKER_04]: And you had to pick up the hooker.

55:38.804 --> 55:39.444
[SPEAKER_02]: And pick up the hookers.

55:39.484 --> 55:40.905
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a fun game.

55:41.085 --> 55:42.186
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really weird...

55:42.926 --> 55:44.566
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a game that makes fun of itself.

55:44.586 --> 55:47.207
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what really weird game I want them to make a new one of?

55:47.227 --> 55:47.567
[SPEAKER_02]: Jumping Flash.

56:09.625 --> 56:14.648
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, now Leo Kristoff in chat says, why do you want to pay for CGI porn?

56:14.668 --> 56:17.509
[SPEAKER_10]: And RossTLUT says, Sky, fuck no, I don't want porn games really.

56:18.029 --> 56:19.550
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, I don't want porn games.

56:19.590 --> 56:23.612
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want random nudity inserted into video games.

56:24.312 --> 56:29.815
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like when you watch a movie and then you're watching the movie and you're like, oh, I didn't know I'd get that ass shot.

56:30.876 --> 56:31.716
[SPEAKER_04]: Life of Brian.

56:32.156 --> 56:36.619
[SPEAKER_04]: Where he comes out fully naked and addresses the crowd.

56:36.739 --> 56:37.399
[SPEAKER_10]: Where is that?

56:40.736 --> 56:46.742
[SPEAKER_10]: It's tasteful, artistic purposes, because games are art, after all.

56:46.782 --> 56:48.784
[SPEAKER_04]: We need random occurrences of naked.

56:51.746 --> 56:53.668
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I hope you guys know I'm half kidding.

56:53.688 --> 56:54.929
[SPEAKER_04]: And no ferret bestiality.

56:55.029 --> 56:57.652
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, DT, what the hell are you on?

56:57.932 --> 56:59.393
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm half kidding, chat room.

56:59.914 --> 57:00.515
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you guys know.

57:01.226 --> 57:09.812
[SPEAKER_10]: But there is no kidding around that PC is getting a new game called Stranglehold, which of course is coming to all the consoles as well.

57:10.693 --> 57:17.058
[SPEAKER_10]: But Stranglehold is coming out this week on the consoles, but if you want to check out a demo, it's up now.

57:17.758 --> 57:23.142
[SPEAKER_10]: The game ships on September 18th, but the PC demo is available to download right now.

57:24.103 --> 57:30.728
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you want to check that out, go to your favorite downloading site, such as, you know, I don't know,

57:31.411 --> 57:31.871
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

58:00.797 --> 58:03.638
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's just so funny the way they're advertising the game to me.

58:03.678 --> 58:07.258
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, more stuff to blow up than any game ever.

58:08.239 --> 58:09.679
[SPEAKER_10]: It just, I don't know, it made me laugh.

58:11.019 --> 58:14.760
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, that would be the whole reason I would buy a game is explosions.

58:15.920 --> 58:21.301
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, speaking of things that aren't exploding, however, you can probably get some neat pyrotechnics included.

58:22.661 --> 58:29.023
[SPEAKER_04]: More information about Guitar Hero 3 Legends of Rock will be coming out on the PC and the Mac.

58:29.323 --> 58:30.403
[SPEAKER_04]: Games on a Mac!

58:31.383 --> 58:32.764
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Snakes on a Plane, but not really.

58:34.464 --> 58:54.014
[SPEAKER_04]: It will have the same gameplay, same content as the console versions, unlockable, multiplayer mode, boss battles, I do believe downloadable content, which would make sense, and it's Guitar Hero...

58:55.512 --> 59:00.496
[SPEAKER_10]: And it'll be cracked so wide open that it'll be freely available before you know it.

59:00.817 --> 59:05.561
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's not that, but I'm waiting for people to crack this game to insert their own shit into it.

59:05.741 --> 59:10.225
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been done on PlayStation 2 and stuff, so... It's only a matter of time upon this release.

59:10.245 --> 59:12.727
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen PlayStation 2 ones done with Metroid Metal music.

59:14.468 --> 59:22.055
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just want to say, though, shortly after the release of this game is when America's going to realize that we're just oversaturated with Guitar Hero crap and...

59:22.725 --> 59:24.586
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the series will start to decline.

59:24.686 --> 59:25.286
[SPEAKER_02]: Just about.

59:25.646 --> 59:26.406
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like DDR.

59:27.627 --> 59:28.087
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

59:28.147 --> 59:28.507
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

59:29.528 --> 59:29.888
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

59:31.509 --> 59:34.950
[SPEAKER_02]: So... And then my... There we go.

59:34.970 --> 59:39.732
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo made an x64 mention that there's already something like that on PC called Fretz on Fire.

59:40.332 --> 59:41.793
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe that's why they want to do this.

59:42.013 --> 59:44.574
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, because they realize there is a market for the PC guitars.

59:44.614 --> 59:44.894
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

59:45.310 --> 59:46.791
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's how we get, like, in the groove.

59:47.151 --> 59:47.412
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

59:48.712 --> 59:51.875
[SPEAKER_02]: So, GameStop, once again, we're talking about them.

59:52.035 --> 59:55.877
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're planning on catering to the casual gamer.

59:57.058 --> 59:57.459
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

59:58.159 --> 01:00:03.683
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, they're going to be redesigning their stores or rearranging them, kind of as a test.

01:00:03.963 --> 01:00:09.567
[SPEAKER_02]: What they're going to do is they're going to have a couple new sections, including one dedicated to the children's and family games.

01:00:10.388 --> 01:00:14.471
[SPEAKER_02]: Another section is going to be dedicated to, I guess...

01:00:15.586 --> 01:00:17.728
[SPEAKER_02]: New reason to go to GameStop?

01:00:17.748 --> 01:00:18.029
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.

01:00:39.474 --> 01:00:46.719
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to go to Fry's today, an electronics store nearby that's pretty big, because none of the GameStops within a 111 mile radius had any PSP cables.

01:01:01.994 --> 01:01:02.314
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

01:01:02.334 --> 01:01:02.714
[SPEAKER_04]: Not cool.

01:01:03.815 --> 01:01:05.756
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can still go to GameCrazy and buy Genesis.

01:01:05.796 --> 01:01:07.077
[SPEAKER_02]: There are options, folks.

01:01:07.157 --> 01:01:09.298
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't need to necessarily go to GameStop.

01:01:09.398 --> 01:01:10.579
[SPEAKER_02]: And also think about this.

01:01:11.599 --> 01:01:15.721
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, I bought the collector's edition of Bioshock so I can get the Big Daddy.

01:01:17.042 --> 01:01:20.124
[SPEAKER_02]: Would I really have missed it if I didn't buy the collector's edition?

01:01:20.344 --> 01:01:21.264
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.

01:01:21.805 --> 01:01:27.688
[SPEAKER_02]: So, don't be fooled in buying this shit for crappy little trinkets that you probably don't need anyways.

01:01:27.948 --> 01:01:29.409
[SPEAKER_04]: GameCrazy needs your money.

01:01:30.369 --> 01:01:31.390
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm going to say.

01:01:32.541 --> 01:01:33.682
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they need a lot of money.

01:01:33.782 --> 01:01:35.103
[SPEAKER_04]: They need a whole lot of money.

01:01:36.404 --> 01:01:36.744
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

01:01:37.745 --> 01:01:38.065
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

01:01:38.645 --> 01:01:40.427
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, is that it for the news tonight?

01:01:40.507 --> 01:01:41.027
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it is.

01:01:41.047 --> 01:01:41.788
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

01:01:41.948 --> 01:01:45.430
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is where we open up the Skype line and let you guys interact with our program.

01:01:45.450 --> 01:01:47.511
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to give us a call, our phone number is 1-877-GAMEOLR.

01:01:50.109 --> 01:01:55.332
[SPEAKER_10]: or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio and Skype line is open and you guys can give us a call.

01:01:56.573 --> 01:01:57.513
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll wait for some calls.

01:01:57.553 --> 01:01:59.655
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, our listenership seems to be down a little bit tonight.

01:01:59.675 --> 01:02:03.917
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if that's the Emmys to thank for that or back to school or the fact that our show just sucks.

01:02:04.077 --> 01:02:08.300
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what it is, but we don't have a lot of live listeners as much as usual tonight.

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:13.703
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm hoping that we get some calls at some point, but the line is open.

01:02:13.943 --> 01:02:15.244
[SPEAKER_10]: So go ahead and start calling.

01:02:15.604 --> 01:02:17.245
[SPEAKER_10]: In the meantime, do we have any last minute stories?

01:02:17.745 --> 01:02:19.206
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

01:02:19.226 --> 01:02:19.266
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

01:02:19.673 --> 01:02:22.795
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, let's start off here, of course, Colin McRae.

01:02:23.316 --> 01:02:24.997
[SPEAKER_02]: He's died in a helicopter crash.

01:02:25.537 --> 01:02:32.062
[SPEAKER_02]: You may remember him from such rally racing events that have happened, of course, in Europe.

01:02:32.702 --> 01:02:40.648
[SPEAKER_02]: And also because he's had his name on various rally racing games, including Dirt, which is actually pretty awesome.

01:02:40.748 --> 01:02:43.190
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately, he has passed away.

01:02:44.530 --> 01:02:45.771
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, also...

01:02:47.403 --> 01:02:53.447
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna say that China, this is funny, China's gaming companies are trying to combat piracy.

01:02:54.668 --> 01:02:57.791
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that gets you to laugh, I don't know what will, so.

01:02:58.771 --> 01:02:59.252
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

01:02:59.712 --> 01:03:02.354
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, China is just...

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:05.695
[SPEAKER_02]: Big on, you know, a ton of piracy stuff coming out there.

01:03:05.715 --> 01:03:07.216
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but that's, you know, that's a scene.

01:03:07.256 --> 01:03:11.840
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't, you know, label everybody as, you know, participating in the piracy rings.

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:12.481
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, fine.

01:03:12.701 --> 01:03:12.961
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:03:13.762 --> 01:03:14.582
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got calls on Skype.

01:03:14.602 --> 01:03:15.043
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to that.

01:03:15.083 --> 01:03:16.064
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get the rest of your stories in a minute.

01:03:16.324 --> 01:03:17.445
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:03:17.485 --> 01:03:18.045
[SPEAKER_10]: Caller, are you there?

01:03:19.086 --> 01:03:21.408
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I am, and it's not Raven's Dolphin.

01:03:21.788 --> 01:03:22.529
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, who is it then?

01:03:23.530 --> 01:03:28.874
[SPEAKER_10]: It's DJ Ranma S. Well, hello, DJ Ranma S. So somebody different got through first for once this week.

01:03:28.934 --> 01:03:29.755
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, what's on your mind, buddy?

01:03:30.734 --> 01:03:31.274
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much.

01:03:31.755 --> 01:03:40.342
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make a comment about the whole GameStop thing about the manager who got basically suspended for only selling games to smart people.

01:03:41.022 --> 01:03:51.771
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say I don't blame him for doing that because I used to work in a video store and the video store was like right by the schools and they would come in all the time and mess the place up.

01:03:51.831 --> 01:03:54.673
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we started doing stuff like that.

01:03:54.693 --> 01:04:00.017
[SPEAKER_01]: We started doing like a program where if you had good grades, you get free rentals and stuff.

01:04:00.444 --> 01:04:07.070
[SPEAKER_01]: We were basically like a mom and pop store and we basically knew the families and stuff like that would come in all the time.

01:04:07.850 --> 01:04:13.815
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, you know, we basically knew if you weren't doing too well in school and stuff, you weren't renting games at all.

01:04:13.855 --> 01:04:14.476
[SPEAKER_01]: Simple as that.

01:04:17.358 --> 01:04:18.399
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm sorry.

01:04:18.419 --> 01:04:19.320
[SPEAKER_10]: I was typing in chat.

01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:19.660
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

01:04:21.541 --> 01:04:21.762
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

01:04:22.022 --> 01:04:22.782
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody's like, I'm sorry.

01:04:22.802 --> 01:04:23.043
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

01:04:23.123 --> 01:04:24.084
[SPEAKER_10]: Restate your question real quick.

01:04:25.365 --> 01:04:28.047
[SPEAKER_01]: What I said was I used to work at a mom and pop store.

01:04:28.067 --> 01:04:29.328
[SPEAKER_01]: We basically did the same thing.

01:04:29.388 --> 01:04:29.488
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:30.671
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:04:51.246 --> 01:04:58.749
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew, the parents knew, basically knew they weren't doing their homework because they were too busy mulling around in our store checking out the games and stuff like that.

01:04:58.789 --> 01:05:10.593
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to like kick them out from time to time and just like, you know, it's like 3, 3, 4 o'clock, you've been here over an hour, you should be at home doing your homework instead of drooling over the games that you want to buy or rent, simple as that.

01:05:10.653 --> 01:05:10.753
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

01:05:11.325 --> 01:05:34.571
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't have a problem with people kicking out loiters, but, I mean, I don't think it's a great business practice to turn away business, especially when most of the mom-and-pop stores I talk to on a daily basis are having trouble selling games, let alone, you know, they're not, like, swimming in money, so I wouldn't, I would highly, you know, advise against it, despite how tempting it may be.

01:05:36.072 --> 01:05:38.732
[SPEAKER_10]: Mystic Gohan says, what if my homework is to play a game?

01:05:38.752 --> 01:05:40.813
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

01:05:41.288 --> 01:05:42.028
[SPEAKER_10]: That was from our chat.

01:05:42.649 --> 01:05:44.530
[SPEAKER_10]: So that went over okay?

01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:45.850
[SPEAKER_10]: There wasn't a lot of controversy there?

01:05:47.131 --> 01:05:48.772
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not at all, you know.

01:05:49.252 --> 01:05:54.295
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, we were supposed to, everybody knew each other, and it was pretty cool about it, you know.

01:05:55.415 --> 01:06:03.639
[SPEAKER_01]: And, I mean, overall, I don't blame this manager for doing it, but it's not his job to be the parent of all these kids, you know.

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:08.862
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these parents should be more responsible and stuff like that, you know.

01:06:09.654 --> 01:06:10.575
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way I see it.

01:06:11.275 --> 01:06:15.597
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall, I give them points for doing that, but not at the risk of your job, you know?

01:06:17.277 --> 01:06:17.558
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:06:18.398 --> 01:06:22.960
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you for the insight, I guess, from having been working for a game store that used to kind of do this.

01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:24.721
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

01:06:25.881 --> 01:06:27.842
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's just, I just want to throw my two cents about that.

01:06:27.882 --> 01:06:28.462
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.

01:06:28.582 --> 01:06:29.223
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I appreciate it.

01:06:29.243 --> 01:06:30.243
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry I missed you the first time.

01:06:30.263 --> 01:06:34.345
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought someone else was listening and I was trying to work on a question that got asked in chat.

01:06:34.485 --> 01:06:36.626
[SPEAKER_10]: So I didn't want you to feel like I was ignoring you.

01:06:36.686 --> 01:06:37.066
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

01:06:37.406 --> 01:06:38.907
[SPEAKER_10]: We multitask while doing the show.

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:40.661
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that feeling.

01:06:41.141 --> 01:06:41.961
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care, buddy.

01:06:42.862 --> 01:06:43.162
[SPEAKER_10]: You too.

01:06:43.443 --> 01:06:43.623
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.

01:07:02.805 --> 01:07:08.409
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny enough, if you purchase it through Best Buy, you get three hidden tracks.

01:07:08.869 --> 01:07:11.271
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, anybody can get the hidden tracks.

01:07:11.391 --> 01:07:15.133
[SPEAKER_02]: And funny enough, it's the Konami code which unlocks those hidden tracks.

01:07:15.573 --> 01:07:18.555
[SPEAKER_02]: Despite the fact that the game is actually being made by Ubisoft.

01:07:18.615 --> 01:07:25.220
[SPEAKER_02]: So, to unlock Brad Paisley, I'm Gonna Miss Her, Jimi Hendrix, Wild Thing, and Tom Petty, Needles and Pins...

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:31.906
[SPEAKER_02]: Simply push up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, during free mode, and it will give you those three songs.

01:07:31.926 --> 01:07:32.687
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, and what game is this?

01:07:33.168 --> 01:07:33.928
[SPEAKER_02]: Jam Sessions.

01:07:34.629 --> 01:07:36.671
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't this a game that some of our listeners told you to stay away from?

01:07:36.851 --> 01:07:37.092
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:07:37.352 --> 01:07:37.712
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

01:07:37.732 --> 01:07:39.274
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, let's go to the phones.

01:07:39.354 --> 01:07:40.355
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got another call coming in.

01:07:40.395 --> 01:07:41.356
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:07:41.376 --> 01:07:41.736
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

01:07:43.158 --> 01:07:43.898
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Jason.

01:07:44.098 --> 01:07:44.819
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Jason.

01:07:44.839 --> 01:07:47.081
[SPEAKER_07]: We do need a new jumping flash now.

01:07:47.442 --> 01:07:48.143
[SPEAKER_10]: A new jumping flash.

01:07:48.163 --> 01:07:48.463
[SPEAKER_05]: Amen.

01:07:49.908 --> 01:07:53.630
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh man, Jamie said that and I smiled so big.

01:07:54.010 --> 01:08:15.761
[SPEAKER_07]: Jumping Flash was my first ever PlayStation game back when Blockbuster still rented out the systems and I paid the $150 deposit and I rented the system along with Jumping Flash and Revolution X. Revolution X was awful at home though.

01:08:17.143 --> 01:08:20.046
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was when I actually owned it.

01:08:45.498 --> 01:08:49.383
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a freshman in college and my roommate's boyfriend had a Playstation but my friend had imported a Saturn

01:09:03.033 --> 01:09:04.074
[SPEAKER_04]: Hire CDs for whaling bonus

01:09:29.003 --> 01:09:29.804
[SPEAKER_04]: Golden Axe The Duel

01:09:57.844 --> 01:09:59.305
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even know they made that game on Saturn.

01:09:59.506 --> 01:10:01.127
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, it was actually a good game.

01:10:02.228 --> 01:10:05.891
[SPEAKER_07]: I only remember two or three things about the Saturn.

01:10:06.612 --> 01:10:12.938
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them was a friend of mine with the extra memory chip or something like that.

01:10:12.998 --> 01:10:15.320
[SPEAKER_07]: Something along those lines, some kind of an expansion chip.

01:10:16.261 --> 01:10:19.544
[SPEAKER_07]: Knights and some weird mech game that I played at.

01:10:20.473 --> 01:10:22.233
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I don't even remember where it was anymore.

01:10:22.253 --> 01:10:28.075
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was at Hastings or something like that on one of their demo kiosks, but I next to no idea what it is anymore.

01:10:28.675 --> 01:10:30.955
[SPEAKER_04]: Saturn was the machine you had if you were an importer, though.

01:10:31.335 --> 01:10:36.796
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you had arcade-perfect copies of Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighters, X-Men vs. Street Fighter.

01:10:38.617 --> 01:10:43.038
[SPEAKER_04]: You had all the King of Fighters games, even though the load time was just completely ridiculous.

01:10:43.618 --> 01:10:44.498
[SPEAKER_04]: Virtual Lawn.

01:10:46.078 --> 01:10:47.879
[SPEAKER_07]: Ready for the beginning, CD systems.

01:10:48.479 --> 01:10:48.759
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of.

01:10:49.671 --> 01:10:52.112
[SPEAKER_07]: Sonic 3 didn't crash horribly.

01:10:54.574 --> 01:10:59.876
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and RawSteelUT points out that all the Working Designs games came out for Saturn, like the Rayearth RPG.

01:11:00.917 --> 01:11:05.779
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually did get games for the Sega CD.

01:11:05.819 --> 01:11:09.001
[SPEAKER_04]: We had Popful Mail over here from Working Designs.

01:11:10.329 --> 01:11:10.869
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, of course.

01:11:10.930 --> 01:11:13.331
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to the people that did own the Saturn.

01:11:13.351 --> 01:11:18.033
[SPEAKER_04]: The notion that that was the importer's console, yes, that was very true now that I think about it.

01:11:29.150 --> 01:11:34.713
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny, Dan and I used to hook up our Saturn and our PlayStation and have the same games in them.

01:11:34.933 --> 01:11:37.515
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we actually had a few of the games that were the same on both systems.

01:11:37.855 --> 01:11:39.396
[SPEAKER_04]: And we would compare what they looked like.

01:11:39.936 --> 01:11:43.798
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Saturn was it for anything that was 2D or required a lot of memory.

01:11:44.619 --> 01:11:47.480
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though the PlayStation was built for 3D.

01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:52.243
[SPEAKER_04]: We compared Symphony of the Night, because I have the Japanese one on the Saturn.

01:11:53.157 --> 01:12:04.800
[SPEAKER_04]: and all the 3D effects looked a lot better on the PlayStation, of course, but all of the sprites and the music was better on the Saturn because I think the Saturn had a better sound processor.

01:12:05.641 --> 01:12:09.762
[SPEAKER_07]: The music being better was really common to pretty much every game on the Saturn, wasn't it?

01:12:10.422 --> 01:12:11.302
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

01:12:11.742 --> 01:12:13.823
[SPEAKER_07]: I do remember hearing something along those lines.

01:12:14.083 --> 01:12:21.905
[SPEAKER_04]: They did have a lot of games, too, that were Redbook and also other games that were pointed out were Guardian Heroes, Panzer Dragoon, Sonic Jam, Silhouette Mirage.

01:12:22.563 --> 01:12:49.078
[SPEAKER_07]: Dragon Force Sonic Jam, yes, that one is a very big deal I remember my girlfriend really complaining about Sonic Jam's collection of the fact that they used the Sega CD version of Sonic Jam instead of the Saturn version because the Saturn version actually had the true epic music composed to not just a synthesized MIDI-ish sound

01:12:49.788 --> 01:12:54.653
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, yes, the world of difference right there.

01:12:56.395 --> 01:12:58.617
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, that's like a trip down memory lane here.

01:12:58.637 --> 01:13:05.123
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, also, for me being an importer, I actually lucked into a copy of Grandia on Saturn.

01:13:06.184 --> 01:13:09.447
[SPEAKER_04]: And comparing that to the PlayStation 1, oh my god.

01:13:09.788 --> 01:13:11.189
[SPEAKER_04]: The PlayStation 1 was crap.

01:13:11.289 --> 01:13:13.011
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the 3D was crap in it.

01:13:13.883 --> 01:13:16.165
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was so much better on Saturn.

01:13:16.545 --> 01:13:21.689
[SPEAKER_04]: Music, you actually had a bigger view field so you could see more stuff that was going on in the game.

01:13:22.230 --> 01:13:23.410
[SPEAKER_04]: The timing was better.

01:13:23.871 --> 01:13:26.913
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything came out so much better on the Saturn version.

01:13:27.193 --> 01:13:30.236
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Sega fanboys, we've got to wrap up and go to another call.

01:13:30.296 --> 01:13:32.938
[SPEAKER_10]: Jason, any last thoughts quickly before we move on?

01:13:34.659 --> 01:13:39.903
[SPEAKER_07]: Bust a Move Bash with the Wii controller is absolutely amazing.

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:42.003
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes so much sense.

01:13:42.144 --> 01:13:43.266
[SPEAKER_07]: It plays so well.

01:13:43.366 --> 01:13:45.010
[SPEAKER_07]: It is very, very fun.

01:13:45.170 --> 01:13:45.611
[SPEAKER_08]: What game?

01:13:46.995 --> 01:13:47.917
[SPEAKER_02]: Bust a Move Bash.

01:13:48.017 --> 01:13:49.600
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a puzzle game where you can play up to...

01:13:51.328 --> 01:13:52.529
[SPEAKER_02]: 8 players at one time.

01:13:52.589 --> 01:13:56.791
[SPEAKER_10]: My mind went to the old dance game and I was like, there's a fucking new bus to move out?

01:13:57.231 --> 01:13:58.552
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it would have.

01:13:58.652 --> 01:14:02.233
[SPEAKER_07]: I should have said Puzzle Bobble Bash because it would make more sense to you pretty much immediately.

01:14:02.333 --> 01:14:02.914
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's alright.

01:14:02.934 --> 01:14:07.476
[SPEAKER_07]: But the move bash for the Wiimote control is so intuitive.

01:14:07.596 --> 01:14:09.357
[SPEAKER_07]: It is so easy to pick up and play.

01:14:09.377 --> 01:14:10.197
[SPEAKER_07]: It is so fun.

01:14:10.477 --> 01:14:10.797
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

01:14:11.017 --> 01:14:11.978
[SPEAKER_10]: I might have to check it out.

01:14:12.038 --> 01:14:12.218
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

01:14:12.939 --> 01:14:16.141
[SPEAKER_07]: Rinse it, buy it, pretty cheap, give it a shot.

01:14:16.281 --> 01:14:16.721
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun.

01:14:16.901 --> 01:14:21.064
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though I've played this game like 50 times, this will be worth it, right?

01:14:22.064 --> 01:14:23.325
[SPEAKER_07]: You might want to play it on mute.

01:14:23.525 --> 01:14:25.226
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll warn you that.

01:14:25.626 --> 01:14:28.147
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, maybe I can use my custom soundtracks with the Winamp.

01:14:28.267 --> 01:14:28.688
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully.

01:14:28.788 --> 01:14:29.148
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

01:14:30.168 --> 01:14:31.209
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, that's true, huh?

01:14:31.389 --> 01:14:31.709
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

01:14:31.929 --> 01:14:32.770
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't gotten up yet.

01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:33.250
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to.

01:14:33.770 --> 01:14:35.751
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Jason, we've got to let you go, but have a good one, okay, buddy?

01:14:36.832 --> 01:14:37.132
[SPEAKER_10]: You too.

01:14:37.372 --> 01:14:38.053
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, bye-bye.

01:14:38.653 --> 01:14:39.433
[SPEAKER_10]: Night.

01:14:39.453 --> 01:14:42.195
[SPEAKER_10]: We always like hearing from Jason, our fearless webmaster.

01:14:43.206 --> 01:14:44.346
[SPEAKER_10]: for OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

01:14:44.366 --> 01:14:48.688
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll probably take one more call, then we're going to call it a night because we are running a little bit long tonight.

01:14:48.708 --> 01:14:50.069
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what's going on with that.

01:14:50.129 --> 01:14:52.910
[SPEAKER_10]: Another last-minute story real quick, Loki, if you have any more.

01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:53.690
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:54.230
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any?

01:14:55.111 --> 01:14:55.911
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a whole ton.

01:14:56.531 --> 01:14:59.452
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, they were talking a little bit bizarre.

01:14:59.472 --> 01:15:02.514
[SPEAKER_02]: They were talking about Project Gotham Racing 5 and what they want to do with that.

01:15:03.434 --> 01:15:09.676
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that they're looking to do is possibly off-road stuff, including quad bikes and off-road tracks.

01:15:10.557 --> 01:15:11.217
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of neat.

01:15:12.077 --> 01:15:14.879
[SPEAKER_10]: GS68 Yeah, you know that thing about the New Jersey parents reacting to the Wii Zapper?

01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:16.321
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was particularly offended.

01:15:16.521 --> 01:15:18.442
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, for fuck's sake, I grew up with light gun games.

01:15:19.323 --> 01:15:19.483
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:38.520
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

01:15:39.101 --> 01:15:48.329
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and I wonder, like, at the carnivals, like, even before the days of video games, I mean, they still have this at, like, the county fairs and the state fairs and the various carnivals around.

01:15:48.589 --> 01:15:56.756
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't they have those BB gun shooting games where you shoot pellets, as many pellets as you can, through the little silhouette, and if you can, like, punch out the star completely, you get a prize?

01:15:56.776 --> 01:15:58.117
[SPEAKER_04]: They have better than that now.

01:15:58.517 --> 01:16:00.639
[SPEAKER_04]: They have shoot the paintballs at the man thing.

01:16:01.019 --> 01:16:01.359
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

01:16:01.399 --> 01:16:04.182
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a guy in riot gear, and you can shoot him with paintballs.

01:16:04.622 --> 01:16:04.922
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

01:16:05.303 --> 01:16:11.106
[SPEAKER_10]: And don't they have, um, they also have, uh, shooting, like, you know, remember, like, that fucking thing they have at Scandia?

01:16:11.366 --> 01:16:17.210
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like that whole elaborate setup with, like, the Wild West, you can shoot, like... I think you have one of those at Tilt.

01:16:17.610 --> 01:16:22.333
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so, anyway, I mean, yeah, these types of games existed long before, uh, video games.

01:16:22.754 --> 01:16:26.316
[SPEAKER_10]: So these are just a couple of dumbasses who somehow got their name in the media.

01:16:26.336 --> 01:16:26.436
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

01:16:27.396 --> 01:16:29.076
[SPEAKER_09]: And don't get me started with Nerf guns.

01:16:29.196 --> 01:16:32.057
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they're obviously for kids, and they shoot real projectiles.

01:16:32.337 --> 01:16:33.357
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Super Soaker.

01:16:33.377 --> 01:16:35.558
[SPEAKER_09]: I keep thinking of that one commercial that's all over YouTube.

01:16:35.598 --> 01:16:39.418
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because it was a warrior that says not to shoot someone in the face with it.

01:16:40.159 --> 01:16:40.399
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

01:16:40.519 --> 01:16:42.339
[SPEAKER_04]: I like getting Super Soakers and putting ink in them.

01:16:43.299 --> 01:16:44.059
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would you do that?

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:44.419
[SPEAKER_04]: That's mean.

01:16:44.459 --> 01:16:46.780
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to when I was in middle school.

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:47.720
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would you do that?

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:48.880
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we were mean.

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:50.661
[SPEAKER_10]: You were a bad child.

01:16:51.301 --> 01:16:52.041
[SPEAKER_10]: I just take it back.

01:16:52.641 --> 01:16:52.721
[SPEAKER_10]: Ugh.

01:16:53.891 --> 01:16:55.952
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, I agree with you, GS68.

01:16:55.972 --> 01:16:57.633
[SPEAKER_10]: These people are dumbasses, but what can you do?

01:16:58.013 --> 01:16:59.554
[SPEAKER_10]: In every village, there's an idiot, right?

01:17:00.675 --> 01:17:00.875
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

01:17:02.476 --> 01:17:04.297
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?

01:17:05.597 --> 01:17:06.778
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think so.

01:17:07.298 --> 01:17:07.578
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:17:07.879 --> 01:17:08.799
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you for your rant.

01:17:09.099 --> 01:17:11.160
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate it, and it fits in well with our program.

01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:12.421
[SPEAKER_10]: No problem.

01:17:12.521 --> 01:17:12.801
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:17:13.141 --> 01:17:13.762
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye-bye, dude.

01:17:14.642 --> 01:17:14.802
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

01:17:15.863 --> 01:17:16.163
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:17:16.581 --> 01:17:18.542
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

01:17:18.822 --> 01:17:20.143
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you to those that got through.

01:17:20.263 --> 01:17:21.123
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to those that didn't.

01:17:21.703 --> 01:17:35.209
[SPEAKER_10]: The new Skype is so weird because I can't, like, if five calls are coming in at once, I have to hang up on four to answer the one, and then the people that I hung up on will try to call right back.

01:17:35.370 --> 01:17:36.330
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can never pick up a call.

01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:39.471
[SPEAKER_10]: So now I have to force the calls to go to voicemail if we're already in a call.

01:17:39.772 --> 01:17:44.394
[SPEAKER_10]: But then, like, it's, you know, the people that keep, like, calling back in seem to get, like, right through.

01:17:44.434 --> 01:17:44.974
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really weird.

01:17:46.035 --> 01:17:46.496
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know.

01:17:46.836 --> 01:17:47.236
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

01:17:47.256 --> 01:17:48.336
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see what we can do with Skype.

01:17:48.376 --> 01:17:50.597
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want the old version back.

01:17:51.038 --> 01:17:51.818
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, last minute news.

01:17:52.178 --> 01:17:58.961
[SPEAKER_02]: To go back to what we were talking about earlier, Eternal Sonata has definitely been confirmed for the PlayStation 3.

01:17:59.202 --> 01:18:02.303
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it will be shown at Tokyo Game Show in video form only.

01:18:02.723 --> 01:18:12.568
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's actually some updates on what the PlayStation 3 will have that the Xbox 360 one won't, including new playable characters and a new clothing system in the works.

01:18:13.331 --> 01:18:14.052
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:18:36.890 --> 01:18:40.632
[SPEAKER_02]: Accompanying this is an increase in costume variations.

01:18:40.672 --> 01:18:46.616
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, PlayStation 3 owners will have to wait until 2008 to get their hands on this RPG update.

01:18:47.676 --> 01:18:48.877
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of funny.

01:18:49.797 --> 01:18:52.379
[SPEAKER_02]: And some other things real quick.

01:18:52.579 --> 01:18:56.021
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot Shots Golf Online is coming out on PSP.

01:18:56.961 --> 01:19:00.043
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's another thing that's going to be shown at Tokyo Game Show.

01:19:00.443 --> 01:19:05.586
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as there's going to be a free online RPG coming to the PlayStation 3 from Q Entertainment.

01:19:06.343 --> 01:19:07.404
[SPEAKER_02]: That is interesting.

01:19:08.104 --> 01:19:12.487
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's going to be... Oh, God, I hope that's not the actual... Oh, no.

01:19:12.868 --> 01:19:15.530
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the one we were talking about before, Angel Love Online.

01:19:15.570 --> 01:19:20.073
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the one where you have to have sex with people and you get impregnated or something.

01:19:20.093 --> 01:19:21.033
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

01:19:21.254 --> 01:19:21.874
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one, though.

01:19:21.894 --> 01:19:22.434
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw it on Kotaku.

01:19:22.454 --> 01:19:23.235
[SPEAKER_10]: From Q Entertainment?

01:19:23.295 --> 01:19:23.535
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

01:19:23.915 --> 01:19:25.216
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's something else.

01:19:25.336 --> 01:19:35.043
[SPEAKER_02]: Angel Love Online is what it's called, but I swear to God, I thought there was something that you had to impregnate women or something, and then you created new characters based off that or something.

01:19:35.063 --> 01:19:35.924
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:19:36.608 --> 01:19:38.050
[SPEAKER_02]: Crisis Core is not the last Final Fantasy 7 game.

01:19:54.172 --> 01:19:56.914
[SPEAKER_02]: I can only hope that Crisis Core is the last Final Fantasy 7 game.

01:19:56.934 --> 01:19:58.475
[SPEAKER_10]: There's way too damn many.

01:19:58.695 --> 01:20:03.739
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, a Kingdom Hearts 0 would make a lot of sense because the creators come out and said the next game is not Kingdom Hearts 3.

01:20:04.279 --> 01:20:05.821
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be a cute little trick to play.

01:20:06.321 --> 01:20:07.462
[SPEAKER_10]: That it's actually Kingdom Hearts 0.

01:20:08.122 --> 01:20:08.923
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the thing.

01:20:09.103 --> 01:20:14.627
[SPEAKER_10]: If it doesn't have the Disney tie-in this time, like if that's their way to not have Disney tie-ins this time, I'm not buying it.

01:20:14.967 --> 01:20:16.889
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, but the Disney tie-ins make that game.

01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:17.389
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:20:18.529 --> 01:20:47.412
[SPEAKER_02]: and then the other thing this is kind of going to DDR Universe apparently if you were one of those people that downloaded the download content for Universe 1 it will not be compatible with Universe 2 unlike the Ultra Mix series where all your download content was transferable to each additional game so sucks if you downloaded that one thing that they had so that's interesting well

01:20:47.933 --> 01:20:49.394
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is kind of cool.

01:20:49.414 --> 01:20:51.216
[SPEAKER_04]: Something I wouldn't mind looking forward to.

01:20:52.097 --> 01:21:00.403
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, the developer that brought us R-Type, Irem, they're bringing out SteamBot 2 on PS3 for anyone who's interested.

01:21:00.744 --> 01:21:03.426
[SPEAKER_04]: Over in Japan, it's Bumpy Trot.

01:21:03.766 --> 01:21:09.211
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a non-linear action-adventure game.

01:21:09.991 --> 01:21:12.693
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a comparison made between GTA and Harvest Moon.

01:21:13.914 --> 01:21:14.915
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that'd be pretty cool.

01:21:15.636 --> 01:21:15.756
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

01:21:17.221 --> 01:21:18.722
[SPEAKER_10]: GTA meets Harvest Moon.

01:21:18.742 --> 01:21:19.302
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.

01:21:21.444 --> 01:21:24.306
[SPEAKER_04]: Milk my cow, now die!

01:21:25.607 --> 01:21:26.988
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that good of a game.

01:21:27.108 --> 01:21:27.568
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me.

01:21:27.729 --> 01:21:28.489
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome.

01:21:30.210 --> 01:21:32.552
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Farmer.

01:21:32.612 --> 01:21:34.754
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not quite.

01:21:36.255 --> 01:21:37.756
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

01:21:37.796 --> 01:21:41.599
[SPEAKER_10]: If that's it for the last minute stories, then that means it's time to wrap up this damn show.

01:21:42.059 --> 01:21:43.981
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:21:45.001 --> 01:21:46.261
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll start off with Loki tonight.

01:21:46.301 --> 01:21:47.242
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, what's your final thought?

01:21:47.442 --> 01:21:50.903
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is I don't want to see the next Resident Evil movie.

01:21:52.263 --> 01:21:56.525
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is I am craving a Marie Callender's pie right now.

01:21:56.545 --> 01:21:58.225
[SPEAKER_10]: I want pie so bad it hurts.

01:21:58.865 --> 01:22:02.867
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to buy a pie for a potluck and then we left before we even got to dessert.

01:22:03.167 --> 01:22:05.268
[SPEAKER_10]: So my poor pie, I had to leave.

01:22:06.448 --> 01:22:07.208
[SPEAKER_10]: Poor baby.

01:22:07.508 --> 01:22:08.148
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, poor me.

01:22:09.229 --> 01:22:10.309
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, your final thought?

01:22:10.989 --> 01:22:12.730
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to wake up at four in the morning.

01:22:14.301 --> 01:22:19.644
[SPEAKER_04]: because I have to be at work at 6 so that I can leave at 10 and go to a dentist appointment.

01:22:21.264 --> 01:22:24.206
[SPEAKER_04]: Fortunately for me, it's just a routine cleaning and I always fall asleep.

01:22:25.446 --> 01:22:26.387
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I get to go home.

01:22:26.587 --> 01:22:27.087
[SPEAKER_10]: Lucky you.

01:22:27.748 --> 01:22:34.291
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because these very comfortable chairs at my dentist's office and they're cushy and they're completely ergonomic.

01:22:34.771 --> 01:22:36.552
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you're laying in them, you're not like,

01:22:37.102 --> 01:22:38.142
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:23:03.425 --> 01:23:04.726
[SPEAKER_10]: and letting us know you care.

01:23:05.327 --> 01:23:09.531
[SPEAKER_10]: That keeps us going from week to week for almost 250 shows now, if you can believe it.

01:23:11.512 --> 01:23:12.634
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's going to do it for this week.

01:23:12.674 --> 01:23:18.839
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, if you like our show, all we ask, tell two people you know about the show, because if everybody tells two people, then slowly we take over the world.

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:22.963
[SPEAKER_10]: Or if you have no friends, which would be sad, and I'm sorry for one.

01:23:23.257 --> 01:23:24.618
[SPEAKER_10]: but if you have no friends you can tell about the show.

01:23:24.638 --> 01:23:25.779
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell your imaginary friends.

01:23:26.179 --> 01:23:29.861
[SPEAKER_10]: Leave us a review on iTunes, a positive review on iTunes or any other type of site.

01:23:30.141 --> 01:23:34.844
[SPEAKER_10]: Your dig.coms, your Yahoo podcasts, your podcast alley, hell there's a million of them.

01:23:35.485 --> 01:23:36.165
[SPEAKER_10]: Spread the love.
