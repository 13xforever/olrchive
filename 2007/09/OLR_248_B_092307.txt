Orange Lounge Radio
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
Rain's nice, but you know... I opened all the windows in the house while I was home.
Yeah, I don't necessarily want to go out and play in it, but I have the view.
I can look in the backyard and watch the rain fall.
Rain is great.
Rain's okay.
It's overrated sometimes.
If I wanted to see rain all the time, I'd live in Seattle or something.
Live in Alabama for a while.
Do they get a lot of rain there too?
Oh, hell yeah.
Second highest precipitation in the country.
It's a subtropical climate.
Less weather, more games.
Yes.
One interesting thing to happen this week is that Intel has actually bought the physics engine Havoc and is now going to be incorporating it into their product.
Interesting enough, Havoc Engine's been in quite a few games, including Bioshock, Stranglehold, Halo 2, Half-Life 2, Oblivion, and Crackdown.
And they've bought the company for $21 million.
So, it's pretty cool.
I could sell them my cat for $21 million.
So maybe we'll see some more Havoc stuff built into the new Intel chips, which would be good, because, you know, physics are awesome.
That's the new wave now.
Take it from Loki, physics are awesome.
In games.
Wouldn't it be physics is?
Real physics suck.
Intelligence are awesome.
Intelligence are awesome.
Apparently it had 4 out of 5 pieces of a tier 6 armor set.
Obviously the damn thing was level 7.
It had legendary swords that were dropped by Illidan Stormrage.
So basically it was about as high of a character as you can get.
And there you have it.
This character sold for $10,000.
Granted, I don't know where this sold, but I'm assuming it was on eBay or something.
The price was in euros, so it had to be in Europe.
Well, yeah, but was it like eBay Europe or what?
I'm not sure.
If I were rich, I would buy him and delete him.
I thought it was funny they were mentioning in there that the person that bought it, his regular account was banned.
Oh, so that's why they bought it.
That makes sense.
Yeah, that totally makes sense to spend $10,000 on a character.
Never mind.
Well, okay.
In somebody's mind, though, dude, what if they had a lot of friends on there or something?
If I had that much money, well, you know, I would do actually constructive things with it.
It's probably someone like Ashley Simpson or something like, I'm totally hardcore, yo!
Look at all the stuff I earned!
All the stuff.
I'm super awesome.
And of course, the chat, our chat room, chat.orangemonstrator.com is asking about Force Strength, Force Dam, Leather Belts.
You know what?
Shut up.
I'm only going to tell you this once, chat.
Shut up.
It's an inside joke.
Forget it.
Yeah, but World of Warcraft doesn't have a goat helmet like Ragnarok does.
You know what else World of Warcraft doesn't have that Ragnarok does have that's pretty awesome?
The bow that you can wear in your hair.
I know the bow is great.
You can get a giant bow, Rob.
I used to have a SARS mask and a bow.
It was awesome.
I gave you your bow.
Anyway.
It used to be my cell phone.
I will think about playing Ragnarok on your server, but after I beat Eternal Sonata...
Please don't ever tell me that again.
No, in one of the dungeons it's like, because the drop rate is so high, you leave with like 500 pairs of panties.
Only on this program.
It's Ragnarok.
Women throwing their panties at me.
Anyway, next story please, panty lover.
Don't wanna, I quit.
Do not want!
No.
New downloadable content for Guitar Hero 2 will have some pretty, pretty cool stuff.
Trivium's Detonation, Atreyu Right Side of the Bed, and Protest the Heroes Bury the Hatchet.
I just think it's rad there's a band called Atreyu.
We did.
That was the dude in NeverEnding Story.
I know.
Their cover of You Give Love a Bad Name.
It's like the verse parts are awful because he's also just doing nothing but screaming.
But like the chorus parts are great.
So that's like the worst and best cover ever.
The cover does in fact give love a bad name, actually.
It gives everything a bad name.
Phil Do in our chatroom says Atreyu sucks.
They suck.
But they have a rad name.
I mean, they might totally suck, but they have a rad name.
You can't deny that.
Well, it's even worse, though, if you have a crappy band with a cool name.
It's like, why didn't you pick a crappy name?
Damn it, now, like, a cool band can't have your name.
Loser.
What was that quote in Wayne's World, one of my favorite movies of all time?
Who else is playing tonight?
The Shitty Beatles.
The Shitty Beatles?
Yeah, they suck.
Oh, that's not just a clever name.
Yeah, that was great.
I'm sure I butchered that quote, but I could almost quote that entire movie.
That's how much I love Wayne's World.
Anyway.
Back to games, please help save the show.
Anyways.
So, you know, if you're not into downloading songs off of Xbox Live, well, maybe you just want to buy the soundtrack to Guitar Hero 3 and put that in your system and unlock some more songs that way.
Apparently, actually, there will be a code to download some songs off of Xbox Live and
to be added into Guitar Hero 3.
Three tracks that you unlock include, let's see here, a track by AFI, Carcigen Crush, looks like Tina by Flyleaf, and a remix of Marilyn Manson's Putting Holes in Happiness by Nick Zinner of the Yayayas.
So how much you want to bet?
How much do you want to bet that these songs are already in the game and you're just having to buy the soundtrack?
You're just locking them on the disc already.
And that pisses people off.
I notice that pisses a lot of Xbox people off.
When they download these things and they find that they're just keys to unlock shit that was already on the disc.
But here's the thing, though, about this.
It wasn't really clear to me whether this is just for the 360 or what.
I mean, this is coming from Billboard.
They were saying that this is going to be a code or whatever.
But they may misinterpret it to actually being a physical code that you punch into the game.
Because obviously this game is coming out on almost all the platforms.
So it wouldn't be surprising if it's just a little key code that you put in.
I like all that exclusive GameStop content you get.
Just a code that ends up leaking out in the internet later on anyways.
Well, this kind of news makes me angsty, but it's not time for that segment yet.
So instead I have to do some news that makes me happy.
GameTap, GameTap, GameTap, GameTap, GameTap, GameTap, GameTap, GameTap,
Oh my god, it's so much fun.
When I used to hang out with Iguana Girl, we used to just go over and do nothing but play.
Typing of the Dead for like hours.
I'm not even joking.
What was the version of it they had at Arcade Infinity for a while?
It was the Japanese one.
Yeah, the Japanese one, but like you couldn't beat one of the bosses because it asks you trivia questions and you can't beat it.
Because it's in Japanese.
Yeah, unless you can speak it.
But man, playing the Japanese one was hard because you wouldn't know the words.
Well, I think that it had like an all like an English typing mode and then it had the Kana mode and I used to actually have
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we read them here live on air.
Dark Sakura will answer your questions or she'll taunt you and make fun of your grammar and punctuation.
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to do it.
Dark Sakura, open up the mailbag, dive on in.
What do we got?
The first one comes from Spamoflage.
That's a great name.
Guys, you make my Monday morning at work fun.
Thanks for the podcast.
Why is Uncharted referred to as Tomb Raider with a guy and unoriginal, whereas every single World War II slash army type slash alien space type first person shooter isn't criticized for lack of originality?
Lastly, I've noticed a trend on your show.
One, Loki makes an Xbox 360 announcement and follows it with a neutral or positive comment.
Two, Loki makes a PS3 announcement followed by a sarcastic or negative comment.
Don't believe me?
Try this.
Loki, ask the ever so lovely DarkSakura to ring a bell every time you say something negative about the PS3 and see how many times you catch yourself.
Enough.
Why the hate?
Come on.
Thanks.
P.S.
No idea how to spell Loki, so make fun of me.
I deserve it.
It's L-O-K-I, not with two E's.
That looks very girly.
Loki!
That's like a MySpace name.
Seriously.
Put a T in there, you have loquette.
Should we do that next week?
Get a bell?
Let's do it.
Let's keep a little tally thing.
A little tally?
Alright.
Next week, we'll get DarkSakura a bell, and every time Loki makes a negative comment about the PlayStation 3, we'll ring it.
Well, maybe they should stop making it so damn easy.
Seriously.
I mean, come on.
I own both systems, okay?
So...
I can't help it if they keep disappointing me.
Okay, well, the emailer raises a valid point.
Why does this Uncharted get passed off as Tomb Raider with a guy, whereas lots of other games are copies of each other?
Well, I'm not saying that all the games that come out are original anyways.
I mean, shit, there's how many World War II first-person shooter games out there?
I mean, seriously.
And if I were to compare Halo 3 to Resistance, I mean, it looks...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and they're expecting this to be this big holiday seller.
I don't think it's going to happen.
I mean, maybe Unreal Tournament 3, but then again, no, that's another first-person shooter game.
I mean, nothing's original nowadays.
It's very hard to make an original game.
Well, we'll withhold that final judgment until the game is actually released and you get a chance to play it.
That's fine.
I'm not going to buy it, but you know what?
If you want to buy it, and if you like those kind of action-adventure games, then maybe that's something for you.
Maybe that's the game that you've been looking for for the PlayStation 3.
If you're waiting, though, for some of these other games that they keep promising us, but, you know, I'm very disappointed that we don't have Final Fantasy XIII yet, or even a demo of it, as they promised us before, but all this stuff keeps getting pushed back.
I love the bell idea, though.
It's because Sony and they can.
Comments from chat, chat.orange.com.
Rob D would like to say, no, it's not.
It's very hard to get funding for an innovative game because it's a risk.
There's a difference.
So, next email?
Yes, please.
I love the bell idea.
We'll do that.
Next email.
This comes from Osfer.
Dear Rob, yeah, I said Rob, but everyone else can chime in with their opinion if they wish to do so.
You always talk about Final Fantasy XII as such a great game.
Why?
Why?
What's so great about a game that has a boring political storyline?
To me, a great compelling story like Final Fantasy VII and X are what make the games great.
Also, I don't like the battle system.
It's way too much like World of Warcraft.
I prefer the strategic system like in Final Fantasy X.
Speaking of which, Final Fantasy X needs more praise.
For me, it's the best game in the series and one of the few games I have ever pulled an all-nighter on.
Why?
The story is freaking epic.
It's compelled me to keep playing.
I also love the battle system and don't really mind the random battles.
Final Fantasy X too wasn't that bad either.
People just need to quit complaining about Yuna singing, which I think is really good.
A Thousand Words is an amazing song.
The only thing that made me sad is that Final Fantasy X-2 lacks summons, but oh well.
Thanks for reading, Osfer.
Yeah, I agree.
XII actually is one of the Final Fantasy games I have not played.
I just have no... It doesn't...
I don't know.
It just doesn't do it.
What I've gone through with the stories so far, I actually like political stories.
I love things that make you think.
You know, and maybe, I don't know if that, I'm not trying to be rude or anything, but sometimes people don't like...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But my problem with Final Fantasy VIII is that the battles and the whole like junctioning magic and all that shit ruined the game for me.
Single-handedly ruined the game.
Could not stand the battle system in VIII.
Couldn't stand it.
So I didn't want to play through it.
I kind of liked the junctioning.
I mean, I really, really liked having to draw your spells.
Oh, drawing magic.
Oh, it hits a nerve.
I liked it.
I couldn't stand it.
I liked that part of it.
But by the time I got to the third disc and was trying to put together my weapons and shit, I was like, bored now!
So I watched someone else beat it and didn't have to.
I'd already gotten all the other cool cutscenes anyway.
That's what I said before I got to the end of the first disc.
I'm like, ugh.
The second just had some cool crap in it.
It had the Ultimecia battles and all that.
I don't really like when the monsters level with you either.
I don't know.
That kind of thing bugs me.
I don't know why.
I like being able to go to so and such area and knowing what to expect.
You know.
But then again.
This next email, if we are ready.
It's from Rob with two B's.
Oh, I haven't heard from him in a while.
Hooray for Rob with two B's.
Well, he sends us a few stories, but... And sometimes we try to work them into the show role, but, you know.
Oh, here we go.
I think that was the name.
No, I kind of agree.
I mean, let's just say I did not jump up and want to spend $10 on this game.
I mean, I just, I don't know.
You're right.
It's like all the parts are there, but the whole they'd add up to, it's just eh.
It's like when you look at $10, you know, spending on that game and you're saying, hmm, look, Rez HD's coming out at some point and Ikaruga and all that stuff.
It's like...
Ikaruga Yeah, I don't know if I want to spend $10 on this one.
I can buy that for probably about $10 as well.
That's a damn fine point.
That's it.
Ikaruga Next email, shall I?
You shall.
Dear Our Lady of the Rosary, OLR, Video Game Missionaries, Howdy, I have two questions for you fine people.
I don't know.
Someone be creative.
Huh.
That is certainly creative.
I beat the ferret in your honor.
and a ferret liked it.
1.
I once had a PS2, the original bigger kind, but it was getting a little spotty on playing some games and I wanted a GameCube anyway, so a couple years ago I traded it in, but now I miss the Silent Hill games, never finished 2.
Why haven't you finished 2?
It's the shortest one!
Anyway.
But I've been getting all nostalgic when you guys talk about them.
And I want to play Final Fantasy XII, so I'm going to buy a used one online with some birthday money.
However, I'll be getting a slim PS2, and I remember reading something about the slims getting too hot and frying the unit.
My question is, do I have to worry about this with used slash refurb PS2s, or have all the units in question been recalled or fixed at the time of refurbishment?
If I do have to worry about this, is there some way I can tell if the unit I get is one of the models prone to overheating?
That I personally do not know because I actually have our first PS2 still, and it works just fine.
And on top of that, I have a first model Japanese PS2 that works just fine, which is an oddity.
You know what?
Here's the thing.
Any system is going to have some faulty ones, but you can take steps in making sure that the system is not going to fry itself.
Not buying it on eBay.
Don't put it in an oven.
Make sure it's in a well-ventilated place.
Don't put it in a box.
Take care of it when you move it around.
A suggestion I do have that came back from the Dreamcast days is if you have carpet or anything, put a flat surface down like a cutting board or something and then set your system on top of that.
And that way it'll be elevated so that the vents, if the vents are underneath it, can get some... You're like the Martha Stewart of gaming.
Well, the Dreamcast did have a problem with getting a little too hot.
Without the jail time.
And without the bad hair.
And without the fruits of the garden.
No, my Slim PS2 works just fine.
I did not buy an American PS2 until the Slims were out.
I only had a Japanese PlayStation 2 for the longest time.
And I finally bought a US one when the Slims came out.
And it works just fine for me still.
So for whatever it's worth, there you have it.
Shall I move forward?
You shall.
Yay.
Oh, the second question by this person.
One of my favorite games ever is Pokemon Snap, and I've been hoping for years they'd make a sequel, but to no avail.
Are there any other good photography... I know, I was just thinking that.
Any other good photography-themed games out there that you would recommend?
I know Metal Gear Solid 2 had a camera, and some of the Zelda games had minigames, but other than that, I don't know anything, especially with photography figures in largely.
Keep on rocking.
Ciao.
Atreyu.
I highly recommend... What's with Atreyu tonight?
Atreyu!
Wow.
Say my name, Bastion.
What?
I highly recommend Bioshock because you have to take pictures of dead bodies.
Dead Rising.
Dead Rising.
Dead Rising, an awesome photography mode.
Good point.
Eternal Sonata, actually... Don't get the cardcaptor Sakura game on Dreamcast.
Eternal Sonata actually has a photographer.
One of the characters, their special move, they can take photos and you can control what's taken a picture of.
And you can sell the photos at shops.
And the better the picture, the more they sell for.
Here's the thing.
It's actually one of the things I should have said was one of my kind of complaints about the game.
It totally throws the game off balance.
Like weapons and things in the part of the game I'm in are like 800 gold, 1,000 gold maybe.
You can sell one picture for 14,000 gold.
Gold is not a factor in this game if you just take ten pictures and sell them all.
I mean, they don't even have to be that good of pictures.
That's one other little bitch I have about Eternal Sonata, is that I think somebody threw the photo system way out of whack in testing.
Next email?
Yep.
I'm not certain, but I believe this is the same... Okay, this is something else from Rob.
About the man who died after three days straight in the internet cafe in China.
The game he played was Online Bridge.
How unexciting, but it shows that it's self-neglect from obsession, not an MMO or other game.
Good point.
Because most of us automatically think, oh, he was playing Warcraft.
No, he was playing Bridge.
It's these people who do online poker or some shit.
It's Final Fantasy XI.
It was Evercrack.
Evercrack takes another soul.
Nope, it was online Bridge.
Hoyle is deadly.
So shall I keep going?
You shall.
Dear OLR, I recently joined a game rental service and decided to rent out Earth Defense Force, although it was the PS2 version since I don't have a 360, to find out whether Loki's claims were accurate or not, and they are, sort of.
The game is fun.
It is really fun.
Destroying armies of ants, sorry, gigantors, is supremely satisfying, and the way that you can mold the battlegrounds by destroying the infected city is genius.
The variation in weapon types gives the game an element of strategy and all loads extremely quickly, very useful on some difficulty levels.
I forgot I played more of Earth Defense Force this week as well.
Maybe you're just so used to it that it just blends in with the rest of your schedule.
Yeah.
The game's budget nature is very obvious from the horrible color scheme that makes some levels look like big piles of sludge to the plot, which is basic to say the least.
It's common to find the alien invaders trapped in the scenery, while the variations in enemy types are small and uninteresting visually.
There are some that fly, some that shoot suspicious looking brown stuff from their bottoms, but in the end they're all ants.
Whether these problems are dealt with in the sequel, I don't know, but they don't detract from the game too much.
Put simply, the game is a grand version of squashing armies of ants like I did when I was a kid.
The squashing ants never seems to get old.
The Afro guy.
I still have yet to play Earth Defense Force.
I'm going to have to check it out.
I'm telling you, they need, and there's another story we're going to get to later, they need to bring out the other PlayStation 2 games and
Convert them over to be able to be played on some of these systems over here.
Seriously, all the games have been almost exactly the same, just different locations and stuff, but I don't think they get old at all.
It's still a very scary thought to me that our reviews and suggestions on games actually influence people.
It's kind of scary.
Well, speaking of someone wanting some influence, we got an email from the doctor!
Alright, hooray!
I love the doctor!
So, I'm going to read it.
I saw the Dalek the other night too.
Yes, I have the remote controlled Dalek.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Good.
Fans of Drum Mania or Keyboard Mania will notice this first, as those two games let you hit as many extra notes as you wanted to without penalizing you, and therefore let you improvise a bit.
In Rock Band, you can't improvise until you're told to, except sometimes on vocals.
Second, the drum pedal on the pre-release units works just like in Arcade Drum Mania.
It's big, has a long throw and relatively little resistance, and it triggers somewhere near the end of its throw, but not all the way at the end.
No quick bass rolls with your toes here.
Third, the drum pedals connect to the main unit by a 1.8 inch mono phone plugs.
Basically the mono headphone jack.
These work electrically like I think they do.
You should be able to wire two of them in parallel using a mono headphone splitter and make a double bass so that you can be the god of thunder.
I asked a Harmonix dev about this and he said he will try it at the office and get back to me.
Fourth, Byrite sucks.
Yes, they do.
Fifth, there is a crazy advanced lag compensation tool built in case your TV internally desyncs audio and video.
I love harmonics.
Lastly, the new guitar buttons and switches feel very solid and responsive.
This drum bar is a bit longer now and does not use clicking micro switches, but still seems to be pretty accurate.
I have experimentally verified that it works well played behind your head and between your legs.
Looking forward to your next show tonight, Warrior Bob.
Yeah, see, mine must have been busted from constant use or something.
Someone must have broke it.
Who knows what kind of drunk middle-aged people were playing it.
at the event that I went to, but it's fun.
Sounds like fun.
Is that it for email?
That be all, sir.
Bye, email bag.
Send us more.
Mailbag at orangeonestradio.com.
You know what we have missed, though?
What?
Talk Like a Pirate Day?
Talk Like a Pirate Day.
Because you said R. I was like, did you celebrate?
I did by making a one-line comment in my live journal.
Oh, it was Talk Like a Pirate Day.
I was off that day.
So I made like a pirate and slept in my cabin.
I was doing other pirate related things.
I was pirating comic books.
I sent an email to all my coworkers with something from I Can Ask Cheeseburger.
I said, you better have a good and productive work day today or else I'm going to send you to the captain.
It was Talk Like a Pirate Day.
It was a little kitty that had a little hook and a pirate hat on.
I know that picture.
It said something like,
I can have booty.
Or no, it said something like, why are you laughing?
Walk plank.
Or I said walk plank or something like that.
It's really funny.
So I sent that to my coworkers.
That's all I celebrated.
Yeah, I'm lame.
Shut up.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Now, I know I'm not supposed to show Jamie on the cam, and I won't, but I can show that she gets a fancy little blue chair to sit on.
So you can see, like, I'm showing her feet on the footstool.
You can see this fancy little chair that she gets to sit in.
And that's why Loki has to take the crappy chair, because the woman took the nice chair, I guess.
That's how it goes.
So there you have it.
Anyhow.
Moving on to another story.
Project Gotham Racing 4 Demo
and it's going to have content I guess that's exclusive to the demo itself.
In fact, I guess there's supposed to be some electric versus gas engine race that they're going to be doing.
There's also going to be arcade mode, which is going to be exclusive to it, set in Macau, I guess.
Macau.
And it's going to feature exclusive challenges.
So I guess that's kind of neat that it's going to have that.
They're also going to feature a time trial for...
Looks like Nurburgrin Snow.
And it's... Yeah.
It says it's due out... Well, the game I know is due out, like, in what?
Two weeks?
So the demo's gotta be coming out here pretty soon, I'd imagine.
It's kind of weird that the demo would have, like, something special.
Maybe... It would be kind of cool if, like, whatever content was in the demo, you could get in the game because you downloaded the demo.
Like, some type of, like, unlock.
I don't know.
Well, it's just like what they did with, um...
NINJAGATING SIGMA
One thing on the Xbox 360 that some folks were doing on Talk Like a Pirate Day was doing some piracy of their own.
And it was leaking Halo 3 onto the internet.
Yes, that's right.
Halo 3 made its way to some Wares sites.
6.14 gigabytes is how big the game clocks in as.
And of course, you know, kind of sucks that people are doing this and taking away from the folks that have spent so much hard time and effort developing the game.
But at the same time,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Where it's undetectable.
I think all of it's done.
I mean, it's going to be hard for them to do that because they have some sort of encryption on there.
So if that's cracked, then the only other thing is there's a media detector or something like that that detects whether you're playing a CD-R, a DVD-R, a press CD, DVD, etc.
And if you can change that, if you can get that to go over so that makes a DVD-R look like a press DVD...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yeah, but when they try to take these things online, won't it kind of screw it up?
No.
If the system can't tell that it's not an official game, then no, there won't be any problems.
It's if you run a special firmware or something that disables that checking, that's when you're going to run into problems.
But if the system itself cannot tell that it's a burned copy and you haven't modified it in any way, then...
Yeah, you will be able to get away with it.
Interesting.
All right, well, I imagine, though, it's just a small percentage, a very, very, very small percentage of people that are able to get away with this, and the game will still sell like hotcakes the day it was released.
Yeah, they're going to make tons of money.
That's not a problem.
And besides, the people that are pirating it probably had no intention of buying it in the first place.
And Loki, you did not get banned for playing Halo 3 early, right?
No, I did not.
The only thing, here's the only thing that they did do is the matchmaking servers aren't up, so you can't play online.
Oh, noes.
Well, right now, until they start them.
Well...
Something that you can play online on Xbox Live is Viva Pinata Party.
The demo is up.
No, Viva Pinata Party Animals is up.
I'm sorry.
It's 971.17 megabytes.
It's basically a big minigame compilation, and it's, of course, by Rare.
So the official game is going to be out by Christmas with over 40 minigames, and you can burp boats down a stream.
and Smash Up Gardens.
Burping Boats is just so much fun, you know.
I think it's a racing game mixed with mini-games.
Escapist in our chatroom asks, will someone be proposing on that one as well?
You know, funny story.
and DarkSakura.com.
www.DarkSakura.com
Really wanted to do an interview on iChat, and unfortunately the way we're wired, where we have the Mac laptop does our Operator 11 stuff, and the PC does most of the audio here, it just wouldn't work for me to do iChat.
But I'm hoping we can call him this week and get him on the show next week.
So if you're listening, Mr. Pinata, let's make that interview happen this week.
So you can clear the air.
I still think it's kind of retarded, but we'll go with that.
It's like those people who...
Who proposed, though, on the big screens, but that I sort of feel like you're pressuring someone into saying yes.
Well, it's just... If it's in a public place like that... But I don't think it was.
It was in their home.
Well, if it's in their home, that's one thing.
Well, we'll find out soon.
We're going to ask all the questions.
Because part of me kind of goes, is this really big to be on all these different blogs?
I mean, this is kind of a private matter in a way.
I don't know.
We'll see.
We'll see.
We'll get our questions answered.
I'm excited.
Back to the gaming news then.
Yes.
Anyways, one thing I'm excited about, as I hinted before, the Simple series is possibly coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
According to some digging done during Tokyo Game Show,
The Simple 2000 series, which of course brought us wonderful games, much like Earth Defense Force.
They're talking about releasing some of them on, of course, the online service, and possibly also the PlayStation Network as well.
And according to Kotaku's article here, it says they're asking about the possibility of the series turning up as downloadable titles, and they said that...
They had two cheap, easy games coming out on Xbox Live Arcade soon.
So, maybe we'll see some more stuff from that series come over.
I hope they port some of that stuff.
Because there was some weird shit over there, like Zombies vs. Abulences.
Awesome.
Gotta love it.
Well...
You gotta love this too.
I know Loki loves this.
Lesbians!
I do love me some lesbians.
Then you'll definitely want to pick up Mass Effect.
I was already gonna pick it up.
It's like the icing on the cake.
Well, apparently, Mass Effect has been causing some waves in the gaming blogs and the gaming news sites this week because, apparently, if you play as a female character, there is a sex scene that you can initiate in the game.
And you can initiate this scene between her and a male human or a female humanoid alien.
So you get some female-on-female action.
But here's the thing, though.
You can also play as a male character.
However, a male character can only initiate sex between him and a human woman.
or the humanoid female alien.
So, no man sex, but Lesbo's okay.
But surprise, butt sex is great.
Well, here's another thing, okay?
Just a thought.
Maybe the storyline, it's between these two women anyways.
It's, you know, you either pick one or the other or something like that.
Maybe because your character...
They didn't make a branching type of storyline or something for this one part.
I see.
So you're saying this lesbian sex is for artistic and story purposes.
It's like the character in the game or something.
For example, wasn't there something in Knights of the Old Republic or Jade Empire or something like that where they had something similar?
I think it was Knights of the Old Republic 2 or maybe the first one.
www.DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?
I know lack of gay sex makes you mad.
Well, yeah.
But F you to male drivers, especially stupid old men, and men who drive big trucks and SUVs.
Every last bad driver I've encountered on the road has been male.
First of all, when I was picking up Dan from the airport yesterday, there was a guy driving an Altima, and he was drifting into my lane.
and I didn't know if he was just changing lanes without signaling or if he was just old and stupid he seemed to lean about middle age but he almost bumped me off the road until I banged on the horn and his wife shook him awake he couldn't have been more than 50 so he wasn't that old but I was like, he's a stupid man and then this guy driving a truck cutting off everybody in front of him just being an asshole driver
Which I consider being an asshole driver is pretty much equivalent with being a bad driver.
Because you're supposed to maintain your cool and calm on the road.
And if you do get angry, you're not supposed to let it affect how you drive.
This guy was cutting off everybody left and right.
He made one car swerve, and I did thankfully get to see him pull over.
I know, I was going to say, I saw an asshole driver get pulled over this week, and it was very satisfying.
And then, um, you know, I saw so many people just changing lanes without signaling and almost causing accidents.
And you know, every last one of them happened to be male.
So I would like to point out there that bad drivers are bad drivers regardless of gender.
Shut the fuck up.
Next, please.
Anyways.
I didn't really have anything to make an FU for, but now I do.
So, yes, once again, women drivers, horrible.
In fact, I bet that guy falling asleep is probably falling asleep from nagging from his wife.
So, you know, I blame her for that.
But, yeah, there are a lot of bad drivers, especially SUV drivers, cell phone drivers.
Cell phone drivers are even worse than stupid men.
And a combination of those as well.
So, fuck you to bad drivers, no matter which sex.
Mainly women drivers.
Hey, cell phone drivers are the worst.
Sorry, Rob.
Well, that's all right.
I have my Bluetooth now, so it doesn't matter.
Yes.
Although I never got in an accident while talking in the phone and driving.
It's an urban legend.
It's made up, just like how man actually went to the moon.
It's all made up, those cell phones.
What was I going to say?
I don't really have a whole lot of FUs, so I'll just say, I don't know.
FU to lack of angst this week.
I'm actually in a pretty good mood.
FU to the million and one projects I have at work.
I have so many projects at work.
I'm all project out.
Projects are work of the devil.
I have too many of them.
That's it.
A rather tame FU this week.
So there you have it.
Another successful FUs of the week segment.
I have one last thing I was just going to add in there real quick.
Oh lordy.
FU to the Halo 3 launch because I fucking hate having to deal with customers asking about when they're going to get Halo 3.
You get it when it's good and ready.
Exactly.
That's how you should respond to them, too.
Alright, back to some gaming news.
Well, anyone who is interested in watching movies and things on Xbox Live will be happy.
That's an anime fan, at least.
We'll be happy to know that S.T.A.R.S.
is bringing different shows.
We are getting Ghost in the Shell, Standalone Complex, Both Seasons, Street Fighter 2V, Noyan, Toko, Virus, and Astro Boy.
There's actually a bunch more.
Some of the other ones that were listed is...
Well, at least they have particular access to was like Blood the Last Vampire, A Different Loop in the Third, Appleseed, Blood the Last Vampire, Ninja Scroll, Perfect Blue.
I love Perfect Blue.
Just different series.
I haven't seen a single one of those series you mentioned.
Perfect Blue was like, oh my god, head trip.
I've seen it twice in the theater.
Perfect Blue was weird.
Perfect Blue was awesome.
Anyway, some people are not so happy about NHL 2K8 charging you $5 to unlock a feature that's already on the game.
This feature, of course, is actually the 2K ReelMaker add-on, and it will allow you to do a variety of video recording and playback options for the game.
But the download was a Puny 108K, which means that you're just paying for an unlock key for something that's already on the disc.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Eternalsonata Eternalsonata
There's, I mean, sports games, you know, you play over and over and over again in little bursts, but a game like Eternal Sonata is really meant to be played start to finish.
So what good does this, I don't know, it doesn't make sense.
They're just hoping for people to buy these things at a push of a button.
What does make a little more sense is buying things that were not included with the original game, such as new outfits.
And this is pretty interesting, is that Bomberman Live is going to be getting a new download pack.
Actually, I believe it's already up, this new download pack they have.
One of the characters that's in the download pack is based off of the mascot from Destructoid.com, which of course is another gaming blog.
We had some of those guys on our year-end show a while ago.
We'll have to have them back sometime.
But yeah, they've crossed over from gaming press blog site into video game character with their little mascot, that green little robot face thing.
Actually, I thought it was silver in some of the pictures I've seen, but whatever.
Color be damned, the little mascot has certainly made a name for itself now by crossing over into a OMG legitimate video game.
So where's the giant Loki head for future expansions?
Well, people would argue that it would have to be a Tingle head because they're fascinated with the character Tingle.
I do not understand this, but whatever.
Then that wouldn't work because you're crossing over Nintendo.
Then they would say, well, he should be in Super Smash Bros.
Brawl as Tingle, dressed up as Tingle.
Yeah, there you go.
That's an awesome idea.
Why don't we make that happen?
No, just kidding.
No, it's not an awesome idea.
That's like mixing the matter with antimatter.
I don't know.
Escapist in our chatroom asks, if Destructoid can do it, why not Bomberman based on the OLR staff?
Well, that's a very nice thought.
I'm sure, A, Destructoid gets like a million more hits in a month than we do.
We're just a tiny little show in somebody's spare bedroom.
Whereas Destructoid is like, they've come a long way.
They've only been around, what, like a year and a half?
They've come a long way.
B, I seem to recall that a couple weeks ago, I don't know if it was their E3 coverage, or they had some coverage of some expo that was sponsored by...
and they had like ads all over their site so they had some type of relationship going on with the folks that made Bomberman so you know that's kind of cool though I'm not knocking it I think it's awesome what happened and I love the fact that the Microsoft community as a whole is really seeming to embrace the community more and more
Some of our other buddy podcasts, such as the Gamerscore blog and Gamertag Radio.
What are all those guys called together?
Gamercast.
They all have their own pictures up on the marketplace.
That's pretty rad.
Hopefully we'll see more of those very soon.
Yes.
Anyhow, back to the gaming news.
Well, something that should interest a few people, especially that are mobile phone gamers...
Coming out will be Rockman Dash, which is one of the Mega Man Legends series.
It's a new Rockman Dash game, and those fuckers didn't put it on a damn console that I can play.
Cell phones do not need more games.
I hate the Mega Man Legends games.
There's also Resident Evil 4 Mobile Edition, Devil May Cry, Dante vs. Virgil, Sengoku Basara, Tactical RPG, and Breath of Fire 4.
I wouldn't mind having Breath of Fire 4 on my phone.
But anyway, that's all Japanese only right now.
Yeah, but it's mobile phone, so who cares?
I care.
I play Luminous on my phone.
Really?
Yes.
Really?
Why?
Because, first of all, I can sneak around outside at work and play it.
And it's actually not too bad.
Actually, I enjoy Luminous on mobile phones too, I have to be honest.
I'm going to load it up right now.
I'm playing during a show.
Well, you have fun with that, Miss Thing.
I will.
Anyways, so, maybe you're looking to find that special someone to eventually proclaim your love over Viva Pinata 2.
Well, fear not.
We're here to help you, and thanks to the Sexy Video Game Land blog, they have compiled a list of what they think are... What a great blog name, by the way, might I add.
The best video game pickup lines.
Here are some to...
What do you say?
I take my flag to your base and score.
So, you ever been in a five man raid?
Hey baby, I need a new hoe and it ain't for gardening.
How does that have anything to do with video games?
It's Harvest Moon.
Oh god.
That's so stupid.
Let me call you Silent Hill because things really get freaky when I'm inside you.
I know how Mario must feel because I really want to clean your pipes.
Call me Ash because I choose you.
There's a warp zone in my pants.
I made that one up.
Oh, let's see.
You're just like an RPG.
I can't wait to take you home, unwrap you, put it in, and then grind all the way until sun rises.
Girl, you got me like WarioWare.
I'm touched.
That's stupid.
You can't be Phoenix Wright because I have no objection to you, baby.
Okay.
Those are awful.
If you're a devil, you may cry by the time I'm finished with you.
You remind me of a game of Tetris.
You always want the long ones.
What?
That doesn't even make sense.
That's stupid.
Hey, baby, can I hide my solid snake in your box?
That makes me want to throw up a little.
I think I did just throw up in my mouth.
Now see, our chat room's joining in now.
Did you throw up in your stomach, Rob?
Huh?
Did you throw up in your stomach?
Shut up.
DJ Dark Knight says, Back me wool, baby.
That's an old OLR joke.
Ranma says, Hey baby, how about I dance dance to your revolution and you beat my mania?
Okay.
GS68 says, You must play 2DX because you've got me on hard mode.
I like that one.
That one's funny.
Warrior Bob says, you remind me of Tetris.
I just want to make you disappear.
I mean, wait, have sex with me.
I like that one.
You know, my favorite pickup line was always, hi, I like peanut butter.
Want to fuck?
Or how about this one?
Babe, you're hotter than my first edition 360s power supply.
That's lame.
Stupid.
Wow.
Lame.
Baby, you can screw attack me all night long.
Anyhow, Drew Nami says, you must play Tetris because you're stacked.
That one's actually kind of good.
Not bad.
Drew Nami has a funny joke once in a while.
All right, moving on.
Add it to the toilet paper.
For the love of God, a new story, please.
From Video Game Pickup Lines, from what was that, Sexy Game Blog?
What was that called?
Sexy Game Land Blog.
Sexy Game Land Blog, nice.
Moving on to something completely different.
I don't keep up with too many Republicans.
So imagine the irony and hilarity when you notice the Mitt Romney ad campaign ads start showing up on GameTrailers.com.
That's right.
A joystick snapped a picture of a GameTrailers.com site with – and it's not a Photoshop thing.
It's the real deal.
It's the GameTrailers little logo there and the Mitt Romney ad right on top of the site.
Hilarity that their campaign would be advertising on the site.
Now –
Let's see, I'm going to go for the obvious here and say that probably they're people or whatever bought into a package deal or some type of advertising company that distributes through all these different websites and game trailers just happens to be one of many.
Because doesn't MTV own game trailers, I want to say?
Or there's some type of partnership there?
I could be wrong, I don't remember.
But yeah, there's probably some much bigger thing that just showed up on that site.
That's kind of funny.
That's karma for you.
This is why we don't do banner ads on OrangeLawnTrader.com.
This is also why we're poor.
I'd just like to point out.
But irony for the win in this case.
So there you have it.
Well, here is a little bit more for anyone who wants.
Yakuza 2 is coming out in the U.S.
Dinosaur King and Mystery Dungeon is also coming out thanks to Sega!
So, um...
They are supposed to be coming out in 2008.
And I think that's going to be very cool.
Because I honestly want... I actually was looking into a little bit on Mystery Dungeon.
It's Shiren the Wanderer.
Dinosaur King is a game where you collect 100 dinosaurs with different moves and you make them fight.
And... Wow.
I just want Yakuza 2 so I can go around beating people up.
You just like violence.
I do like violence.
I like beating up people wearing nice suits.
All right.
Well, those games coming to you very soon from Sega.
Also coming to you very soon, the Skype line.
You can give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
We love to be interactive.
But one more story for you real quick.
Yeah, I like being interactive.
All right.
Anyways.
Okay, enough with the pickup lines, seriously.
Although, I have to say this, SSJ100Matt sent me a message and says that there should be a voicemail challenge for people to leave pickup lines on the Skype line voicemail.
Do you want some hot coffee?
Yeah, so please, I love that idea.
So please call, if you give our number a call, either on Skype or the phone number when we're not live, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Leave us a message with your sexy video game pickup line and we'll play some of our favorites on next week's show, but I bet you we don't get any.
Anyways, in case you had hopes and dreams that that wonderful Halo 3 Legendary Edition game box was actually going to become a brand new helmet for your cat, unfortunately, that will not be the case, because the helmet itself, as IGN found out, is not hollowed and will not fit on your cat.
That sucks.
Now I can't put the helmet on my cat and watch my cat run into walls?
No.
But, I mean, with some simple modding, you probably could do that.
Oh, wait, I don't own a cat.
I own a cat.
There's no way a cat would put their head in that anyways.
Could we put the helmet on the ferret?
Yeah, that would look weird, though.
That we might be able to pull off.
I bet Shermie's little head would fit in it.
She's got a small brain.
Are you kidding?
Shermie's the fattest cat I've ever seen.
But her brain is very small.
Cat's aren't dumb enough to put their head in there.
Yes, as this is very interesting, well, not for me, but for maybe Rob, apparently if you were looking for some man sex type game or whatever, there's Dual Love, which is going to be coming to the DS, and it includes a part of the game where you scrub down a naked man.
Yay!
Oh, God, I saw a preview for that on some website.
I'm going to scrub down a naked man.
No, it looks stupid.
Somebody sent me a link to it.
It looks stupid.
Anyway, we're getting some phone calls.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Oh, this is Warrior Bob.
How's it going, Scott?
Hi, Warrior Bob.
It's good.
How about you?
Not too bad.
Long time no chat.
Yeah, serious.
So we read your email about the rock band.
Good times?
I heard that.
Thank you.
Loki went down and played it, but I missed out.
I totally forgot.
Oh, when was he there?
Today.
Oh, that's why I didn't see you.
Were you there like all day or something?
I was there most of the day Thursday and Friday because I had a group of friends going and I figured, eh, why not?
But you went to the Sac State one, right?
That's right.
Loki went to the Ribs, what was it, Rib Fest?
The Rhythm and Ribs Fest.
Rhythm and Ribs.
I should have gone to that, I love Ribs.
That's awesome.
I would have went to the one on Friday but I had to work and unfortunately I only went until 6.
Unfortunately a Rib Festival doesn't work very well for someone who's trying to be more vegetarian but what have you.
Anyway... I'm unemployed, so Friday was a great day.
Ah, gotcha.
What would you call in about tonight?
What's on your mind?
Well, so, I figured it's the first time I've gotten to listen to your show live in a few years, so I'd figure I'll take some of your advice.
I've been playing the Guardian Legend.
Yay!
Awesome.
What do you think?
Well, it's a lot of fun, and I can't put my finger on it, but what in God's name am I supposed to be doing?
Wandering around...
You fight things and collect the power-ups, and then you go into the different levels, and the levels are numbered by, like, 1, 21, 2, you know, they back and forth.
I think it's 1, 11.
Yeah, 1, 11, and your last two levels are 10 and 20.
And they are fucking hard.
Here's the thing, is that you walk around the Zelda-ish world looking for where the corridors are, and the first few corridors are easy to open up.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and they'd give you tips on how to open up the corridors.
When you beat the corridors, like 1 through 10, they give you a key, like you'll get a little moon key or you get a little square key or a diamond key and that will allow you to progress to another section of the Zelda world where there are more corridors waiting for you.
Well, that makes way more sense.
I thought I was supposed to go to like level moon or level plus sign or something.
No, no, you find those moons and plus signs in the corridors when you beat them.
Yeah, they're different keys.
And then the corridors 11 through 20 just give you weapon upgrades and stuff, right?
I think so.
Yeah.
I don't think you get too much other stuff special.
Well, you still have to beat every level to progress through it.
But the weapons that you get, the one weapon that's going to be your best friend, especially in the last level, is the multi-directional ball.
Because you can shoot it up, down, left, right, and diagonals.
and the way you beat the last boss is so freaking easy, but everything else is really hard.
It isn't way better than GameFAQs.
Thank you.
But TGL mode, you want to try TGL mode at least once.
You go into your password and just put in in all caps TGL.
Okay.
It's just all the shooting stages back to back.
And it gives you your power-ups, however there are ways to get around and get earlier power-ups and other things playing in RPG mode.
But TGL mode is definitely for the win.
Crazy talk.
They are.
So where the hell is Lolo in these games?
He probably died because, like, everything kills you in that game.
Hmm.
There was a button that killed you in that game.
Escapist said Lolo moonlighted in the first Kirby game then disappeared.
That's true.
He probably hit the select button or whatever the seppuku button was in Lolo.
Those are some tough games.
Lolo's seppuku button.
That's right.
There was Lolo Lo and La La La.
Remember his girlfriend La La La?
She was the girl because she had a bow in her hair and she was pink.
Well, there's the connection.
Kirby had King Dedede.
It's like you take a syllable and just repeat it a bunch of times.
We need a new enemy in this next HAL game.
How about King Nanana or King Boo Boo Boo?
They let their babies name them, actually, is what they do.
Learn your first Japanese character and just write it a bunch of times.
That's right.
All right, Warrior Bob, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
No, I've got an NES plugged in now, so what should I play?
See you next time.
See ya.
I hope Warrior Bob comes back to visit sometime.
It was fun having him on the show.
And lots of folks in the chat room are chiming in.
Tecmo Bowl, Ninja Gaiden, Clue Clue Land, Archon.
Ooh, that's a good suggestion, Archon.
Clue Clue Land.
Oh my god, I played so much of that stupid game.
I did an Animal Crossing.
We have another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
This is Mr. DeBucket.
Hello, Mr. DeBucket.
What's on your mind?
He's going to yell at me for kicking him over the Dreamcast.
No, I'm not going to yell at you for that.
That's understandable.
I know how Dreamcast fans are really defensive.
This is true.
Well, what's on your mind then?
Oh, Metal Gear Solid 4, Metal Gear Solid Online.
I wanted to know what you guys thought of them making the game separate from the multiplayer.
You know, I don't... Here's the thing.
I have to be honest.
I don't follow the Metal Gear series too much, but I'm kind of welcoming the idea of an online version.
I think that might be a lot of fun.
Kind of like this...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
How do you finish it?
As far as I got was I found a dude tied up by some, you know, in the middle of the jungle.
I untied him.
He runs off.
I leave.
And then it's just all darkness and fireworks going off.
I seriously don't remember.
When I rented it, I was like 11.
Yeah, every time I went to a new screen, it was all dark.
Then fireworks went off and everything was lit up for some reason.
And helicopters couldn't see you even though you're standing right next to them.
Well, how do you feel about it?
Because you must have called this because you had an opinion on it.
I think it's an interesting idea.
I mean, if you don't like Metal Gear that much, if you really can't get into the single player, the multiplayer aspect, since it's a second game, I'm pretty sure you will be able to buy it separate.
You could like that better.
And also, they changed the controls.
They make them more like Western games or things that a lot of online gamers would get into.
Like, now you use R1 to shoot and stuff, kind of like most games do, using the right trigger, the fire, and use L to aim.
Yeah, and the Sons of Patriot system, which is a new thing you can do, because normally in a multiplayer game, you know, you can always, like, see your buddies and tell if they died or something like that, or, you know, say, like, this person's name got shot, or, but you can actually see everything that they're doing by, like, at the beginning, every time you begin a match, you all, like, link up, and you can see everybody's stats, and what weapon they have, and what they're exactly doing, so you can go help them out or something, and
It's a really cool system, and it's a completely different game, and they're selling it different, but if you do buy Metal Gear Solid 4, you will get a starter pack or something.
Yeah, I heard about that.
Yeah, and apparently they're going to be making more downloadable content over...
The next year's if people still play it.
That's cool.
And I think what you said is kind of right where I feel.
I'm not so excited about Metal Gear Solid 4, but I hear about this online one.
I'm like, oh, really?
That looks like it could be fun.
I don't really follow the story, but just throwing me in the arena and shoot them up looks like a lot of fun.
So I definitely will check it out, if nothing else.
I may not get so into it, but we'll see.
Okay.
All right.
Anything else you want to share with our listeners today?
I appreciate it.
Thank you very much.
Have a good one, buddy.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
In fact, I think that we should play this, though, in the afterbirth.
What's that?
If we can find the video of it.
I'll try.
Of the PlayStation 2 vs. Dreamcast with special guest the VMU.
With them arguing over who was better.
I'll try.
I'll find it.
All right, I picked up a call.
Let's go to the phones.
Hi, you're on Orange Zone Radio.
Who's this?
Legend of Zaku.
Hello, Legend of Zaku.
What's on your mind?
Nah, just chilling, just getting ready for Digital Life, which is at the end of the week.
I'm sorry, I'm not coming.
I was looking forward to it, but something else came up.
I've been knowing that.
It's alright, though.
Yeah, just the general stuff within the community.
You know, stuff like Metal Gear Solid 4.
What the hell are you typing?
Hey, are you typing to somebody else?
It's our turn.
You talk to us.
No, I mean Final Fantasy.
I mean, you know, all the Halo stuff.
All the reviews.
All the Halo 3 reviews coming back almost at 100 or something.
The general internet says stuff like OMG, they probably got paid off by Microsoft.
But yeah, that sort of thing.
I'm not really buying into that much hype.
What are you most looking forward to about digital life?
Um, just the, you know, just the DDR tournament.
I'm competing in freestyle on Saturday.
Ooh, any hints about your routine?
Um, not yet.
Um, when you see it up on YouTube, hopefully at that, you know, at that night, you know, the night of the tour, I mean, the night, the day, you know, after the tournament, then you'll see something.
But yeah, I'm trying to keep it under wraps.
I will be looking for you on the YouTube-age.
Yeah, that too.
I mean, why else do people DDR freestyle anymore?
I mean, it's all about being on YouTube and everybody able to watch your routine.
Well, yeah, I mean, freestyle is kind of like a dying art right now because most tournaments don't even have that except for a few exceptions.
If they have that whole SingStar thing on the PlayStation 3 where you're going to be able to upload your videos like a karaoke thing, why don't they do that with DDR?
That's what I don't get.
Microsoft doesn't care.
Konami doesn't care.
Don't most DDR mixes have some sort of camera support?
I know, you know, the PS2 ones had iToy.
Exactly.
I don't know about 360.
So how about just a website you can upload all that to?
Come on, it's untapped resource.
Konami, I'm giving you free hints here.
I don't think Konami's ready to, you know, to drop that much bandwidth on that.
I mean, they're taking DDR that far, but, you know, that's about it.
All right.
Well, what else is on your mind tonight, buddy?
Just really go over the whole, you know, the whole Rumble, Sony actually getting it
and supposedly taking their quote-unquote last-gen feature and just polishing it up as if it were new.
Basically polishing a turd.
We all know better.
All right.
Well, Sakura, I've got to let you go to get more calls, but have a good one.
Have fun in digital life and tell everybody we said hi.
Tell Don I said hi, and I'm sorry I didn't make it.
Yeah, I will.
All right.
Later, buddy.
See, I'm having people relay my personal messages now.
All right.
Rob.
What?
I sent you that thing.
Yes.
Do you want me to play it now or do you want me to play it in the after?
Right before.
Right now?
No, not now.
Right before the very end.
Okay.
You got it.
A little treat for our live listeners.
Are we going to get any more calls?
I don't know.
How about some more last-minute stories while we wait for more calls?
1-877-GAME-OLR or username OrangeLawsRadio on Skype.
Loki, anything else?
If you like Owen Dunn or Elite Beat Agents, you'll be happy to know that OSU, the sim for those games, has been released onto the PC.
It is available to download and is actually pretty interesting.
You can find it at osu.ppy.sh.
It's in one of their forum posts there.
It's just like playing Owen Dunn, but just with your mouse, which must be insanely difficult.
Hold on.
We'll talk about that in a minute.
We got another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
This is Misty.
Hi, Misty.
How are you, Misty?
Up for once.
Wow, I know.
We never hear from you live on the show, but I'm so happy you were able to call in.
OMG, a girl, everybody.
OMG.
Dot, dot, dot.
Well, yeah, but you're always here.
All right.
What do you think of Cooking Momma?
It is addictive.
This is very addictive.
What kind of foods have you been preparing in Cooking Mama lately?
Pretty much so far, the stuff that has retained its Japanese names.
Okay.
Very cool.
Very cool.
Is there anything coming out soon on the DS that you're looking forward to?
Not really, because I've only been half paying attention.
But considering my birthday's coming up, I'm going to start paying more attention at Target.
Okay.
Okay.
and seeing what else is coming out.
I don't know, actually, I don't know if there's a whole lot on DS coming out soon to get excited about this year.
Zelda Phantom Hourglass?
Oh, thank you.
I knew I was forgetting something big.
It's the week after next.
There you go, Zelda Phantom Hourglass.
But most of their big stuff for the holidays have already come out, like Brain Age 2 and all that, right?
There's Final Fantasy Tactics on the DS.
Oh, Final Fantasy 4.
A front mission, Revenant Wings.
All right, all right.
So shoot me for not following the DS so much.
My bad.
Well, I don't think it's coming out this year, but...
Now, folks in the chat room are giving you some advice on DS games to pick up.
TheRobD says you need to get Clubhouse games.
SonofDad says Planet Puzzle League.
That's a good game.
Yeah, those two look like ones that I've been considering.
And for Clubhouse, I have considered it last night, but I came and got Cookie Mama because I saw that it was only $20, and I was trying to watch my money a little bit.
because that GameStop was only my first stop in the mall.
I still had a good portion of the mall to go.
Right.
See, the good deals always went out when they're cheaper.
Always went out.
Well, Misty, anything else you want to share with our listeners today?
Not really anything that I can think of.
All right.
Well, Misty, thanks so much for calling in, and I'm glad to hear you got through.
I know you've been listening to our show forever, and it's always good to listen to you live.
All right?
All right.
All right.
Have a good one.
You too.
Bye-bye.
Hey, no moleste.
This is.
How's it going?
I went into the chat room, I was playing my puzzle quest, and I went onto the website, and so I decided to call in.
Well, there you have it.
I thought you guys were taking calls.
Do you miss living where the show is recorded?
Yeah, I don't miss you, but I miss the show.
I miss everything about the show.
You miss Jamie and Matt, but...
I miss Jamie and that.
Nothing about you, though.
You need to actually come with us to get Indian food when you can eat.
Yeah, I know.
Actually, that place is very friendly to the South Beach diet, is what I was reading.
It's all whole wheat or unbleached.
And it's great for vegetarians.
Except for the rice.
It's awesome for vegetarians, too.
I'm actually thinking about going vegetarian again.
I just did three days ago.
Did you?
Yes.
Cool.
That's why I'm taking vitamins and stuff.
I didn't want to make too big a deal out of it, because last time I went vegetarian, I was not able to do it for more than a week and a half.
So you're being a vegetarian, Rob?
What?
I will go vegetarian with you, except I will need to eat fish.
No, I'm going to eat fish, too, because protein is so hard to get.
I get an earache.
Well, then you're not a true vegetarian.
You're right, I'm not.
So it would be more appropriate to say I don't eat meat.
No red meat.
Yeah, you're a fishitarian.
No red meat and no protein.
Yeah, I'm a fishitarian.
I can't give up sushi.
I just can't.
All right, well, anyway, enough about that.
Who the fuck cares about what I eat?
Extrovert.
Nobody cares about what I eat.
Extrovert, what kind of games have you been playing this week?
I don't know if you remember, but we talk about video games on this show once in a while.
What kind of video games have you been playing?
I've been playing World of Warcraft and Puzzle Quest.
Big surprise!
How's World of Warcraft been treating you?
Pretty good.
I'm at the end of a grind in the game, and I don't know.
Like, it's getting kind of boring because I've gotten a lot of stuff, and so now I'm like,
What are you most looking forward to about Wrath of the Lich King?
I haven't decided yet.
I think that just to look in the new areas and stuff like that, explore in the new areas.
Awesome.
Well, you know, when I come back to World of Warcraft, which is probably going to happen, because, oh, my gosh, I can't believe we didn't talk about it during the news, but Final Fantasy XI, okay, A, I kind of stopped playing like a couple weeks ago, but B, they announced that for the new expansion that's coming out, Wings of the Goddess is the new expansion coming out, they have announced one of the new job classes for Wings of the Goddess, Dancer.
So you can shake your booty.
Yeah, I know.
Oh, I'm so excited.
By the way, Sauce says it's technically pescatarianism.
is that what it is?
Pescatarian?
will not eat the flesh of any animal other than types of seafood yes and I don't want to live off seafood but I just want that to be available because I'm not I'm doing it for health reasons not I'm not a member of PETA or anything it's just health reasons people eating tasty animals well hey what?
if you come back to WoW then you can't you're like a you're a cooker right?
you cook food in WoW right?
yes yes
Yeah, so you can't make any meat anymore.
I'll call you a liar.
It's a virtual game.
It doesn't matter.
It matters.
It matters to me.
If you give me meat, I'm going to call you a liar.
If I was a card-carrying member of PETA, then maybe, but I'm doing it for health reasons.
Because I'll tell you what, making yourself vegetarian really makes you stop and think about everything you're eating.
Whereas usually, you don't.
If you're not on some type of thing, you don't.
But I don't want to talk about food anymore.
Jesus Christ.
Alright.
See, now everybody in chat is yelling at me.
I should never call myself a vegetarian.
I'm just on a lifestyle adjustment.
Who cares?
Alright.
Excellent hanging up on you.
You're ruining the show.
You had a what?
I had a mushroom Swiss burger today.
It was so good.
I'm so glad to hear it.
Filled with meat and protein and meat.
All right, I'm hanging up.
Buy extra frozen.
But remember, you can only eat top cuts of meat.
It has to all be lean, less than 5% fat from meat if you're doing South Beach.
That's right.
You'll balloon up and you'll look like all those contestants on Biggest Loser.
You look like Roseanne.
Well, good.
Then I can try out for Biggest Loser next year.
All right.
I'm hanging up on you, Extifer.
Okay.
Take care.
I love you all.
Bye.
Bye.
I'm surprised Extifer didn't use the opportunity to tell us he was talking to us on his iPhone.
Because usually he'll say, I'm on my iPhone.
Actually, the funny thing about Extifer, he has a whole YouTube series now.
His live journal posts have all been YouTube clips.
Extifer, if you're still in chat, you can plug your YouTube channel there.
You have to spell his name really funny, so I can't even remember how to get there.
There you go.
And Actdeft will also be coming back to Orange Launch Radio just as soon as we can get coordinated and get our Wednesday show off the ground again.
But we're going to do something with video this time because of Op 11 and all that fun stuff.
I'm going to hide.
It's the Wednesday show.
You're not on it.
I should come on the Wednesday show and bring pizza.
But then you have to be on cam.
No.
Fine.
Then you have to wear a paper bag over your head the whole time.
Like Faust from Guilty Gear.
All right.
That's it for the Skype line tonight, you guys.
Thanks so much for tuning in and participating.
Appreciate it.
Play it.
Hold on.
We're not there yet.
I'm not there yet.
Any more last-minute stories?
Yes.
Thank you.
I've been finding more as we wait.
Anyways, some interesting stuff to kind of go back to last week's story, how we talked about Sony releasing 3.71 firmware for the PSP and PSP Slim to circumvent the...
Team M33 has just released the custom firmware 3.71 to combat that.
So now you have all the wonderful features of the most current firmware for the PSP, and you can also run homebrew.
It will never work, Sony.
Try as you may, it will never, ever work.
Anyways...
Some other interesting stuff.
There is a Chinese MMO company, Shonda Entertainment, who has a MMO called King of the World.
Apparently, they have banned men playing women characters.
Oh, shit.
You know I only play women characters now.
You will be required to prove your gender via webcam.
What if it's a really pretty guy?
I know.
That won't be hard to fake.
What if you're Chris Crocker?
or just put your sister in front of the camera.
My little six-year-old sister.
Or what if you have a woman who has very masculine features?
You mad.
Yeah, what do they do with trannies?
I don't know.
No love for the transsexuals.
I love channies, Rob.
I know you do.
People are noticing that more and more EB games are slowly becoming GameStop.
I wonder what's going to happen to the two that are in the mall.
So it's kind of speculation, isn't it?
Well, they said just this week that two stores in Rochester have already become GameStops.
And that they've noticed more and more since then.
Samurai Shodown 2 is coming to Xbox Live Arcade and the Wii.
Which is the best one in the series.
It was shown at Tokyo Game Show, so people will be happy about that.
Best one ever.
It is coming to the Japanese Xbox Live Arcade, so no one worried if it's coming to the US.
Probably will be.
And then finally, there have been some tools released for modders of the Xbox 360.
Using, I guess, a timing attack with a mod chip that's out there right now, you can drop your firmware down to one that can be exploited
and it will allow you to install Linux on your Xbox 360 and probably also run Homebrew and God knows probably running backups of games.
And then real quick, this is more for in-studio unfortunately, check out this cool add-on for the Arkanoid DS game that's got the... Oh yeah, the little paddle.
That's cool.
I saw that somewhere, that was awesome.
Yeah, that's pretty awesome.
Let's see, I think, yep, that's all the stories I had.
Well, it's about time.
All right, now, DarkSakura, set up this YouTube-age I'm going to look at here in studio, and the folks on the stream and podcast will get the audio.
This was back in the day when there was the big debate between the Dreamcast and the PS2.
People trying to decide what was better.
And this is basically a Dreamcast and a VMU talking to a PlayStation 2.
Now wait, was this an actual commercial on TV or what was this?
No, this is just a fan video.
And it was on some site a long time ago, but a bunch of people have re-uploaded it.
But the PS2 was the one with the really snooty voice.
And the Dreamcast is like the regular, you know...
Hey, PS2!
Yes?
Me and the VMU were watching you play Ridge Racer 5.
Oh, really?
Yeah, and we thought it looked really good.
Ah, thank you.
Yeah, it looks good.
For us to poop on.
Mock me if you must, but keep in mind that I am powered by the 128-bit emotion engine.
Yeah, the only emotion you're giving developers is frustration.
Ha ha ha ha!
They better be programming on a Saturn!
What a disappointment.
Only top-notch Japanese development studios can obtain optimum results from my hardware.
Yeah, then how come Dead or Alive 2 looks better running on me than on you?
What a disappointment.
But surely you've witnessed the raw beauty that is Tekken Tag Tournament.
Yeah, a game that looks like Tekken 3 running in enhanced mode.
What a disappointment.
Oh, I see.
Do you actually believe your crappy lineup can compete with Japs at Radio, Grandia 2, Echo the Dolphin, Metropolis Street Racer, Furballs, NFL 2001, Eternal Arcadia, Slammity Amigo, and Sonic Adventure 2?
Oh, yeah?
Well, all that Namco thinks you can handle is Mr. Drew!
Hey, hey, hey, do you want to go?
Do you want some of this?
I'll spank you like a little bitch, you f***ing b***h!
Come on, come on!
Good luck, you're okay!
I have had enough of you!
The internet thanks you for blowing out their speakers.
Good job.
What a disappointment.
That was great.
I love that little video.
That was from user Kohan69 on YouTube.
I'm going to post it in the chat room again.
It's funny.
Wow.
Okay, well, on that note, God, this has been a long show tonight.
Both segments over an hour and a half.
That's because we're awesome.
I think it's time to wrap this shit up.
Just like that PlayStation 2 got, we need to put a bullet in this show.
It's done.
So that means we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.
Loki, your final thought.
My final thought is... I was just reading this last article here.
There's some 12-year-old, I guess, a 6th grader that received $6.5 million for an in-game commerce network they designed.
Bastard.
Okay.
I want $6.5 million.
My final thought is... I want a cookie.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
Dreamcast!
