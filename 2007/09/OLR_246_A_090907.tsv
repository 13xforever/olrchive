7000	13000	We're your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loco here
14000	19000	Tonight, September 9th, 2007, Layers Hot Coffee Mode is found, but it's not what you think.
20000	26000	HD DVD gets a price cut in Europe, and a third-party company has something to say about PlayStation's marketing.
26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37000	45000	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer lifestyle, and gamer culture.
46000	48000	That'll teach me to say so damn much during the introduction.
49000	52000	That voice you hear taunting behind me is the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
52000	56000	Hi. And my name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as well, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
57000	59000	Hello. How you doing, Jamie? How you doing tonight?
60000	62000	I have a soda. You has a soda?
63000	64000	I has a soda. Is it delicious?
65000	69000	Not really. Not really? You're very quiet tonight. You seem kind of timid. Is everything okay?
70000	73000	I just ate. You just ate, so you're very well satiated?
74000	79000	I was getting into Uber bitch mode because I didn't eat, and then I ate, and I ate too much.
79000	83000	Now I should say something before we get to the rest of the show is that we are taking new pictures tonight,
84000	87000	which I'm hoping you guys will see the results of in our album.
88000	90000	I can't talk tonight. What the hell's wrong with me?
91000	98000	In our album artwork that you'll be seeing for episode 250 at least a little later on, and Jamie got to eat.
99000	103000	Weren't you eating a Pikachu? Or was that? No, you were squishing a Pikachu, pretending to eat a Pikachu.
104000	105000	I ate my cell phone.
106000	107000	You ate your cell phone. Was it delicious?
107000	109000	Not really. It tasted like Samsung.
110000	114000	Wonderful. Anyhow, also joining us tonight, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
115000	117000	I've already said hello, but yes. Hello.
118000	119000	Hi again. How are you?
120000	120000	I'm doing fine.
121000	126000	Awesome. Also say hello to our chat room, which is available at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
127000	131000	You can also say hello to Gay Eddie, who's here tonight, joining us on the show.
131000	136000	Yeah, that'd be Casper the Gay, thank you very much. You just always call me Gay Eddie, because you're a douche.
137000	138000	I don't know what else to call you. I'm sorry.
139000	141000	We're going to start off with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week?
142000	145000	We'll come back to you and get you filled in a little more for the folks that may not know you,
146000	147000	because you haven't been on the show in a long time.
148000	151000	Has it really been six months? You could have had a baby since the last time.
152000	154000	Maybe you had a baby, and we'll find that out.
155000	157000	We'll start with Dark Sakura. How was your gaming week? Let's talk about video games.
157000	161000	Lots of pinball. We sold the Whodunnit, finally.
162000	163000	Oh, I liked Whodunnit.
164000	166000	Yeah, but we can get a much better one than the one that we had.
167000	171000	We're babysitting some machines. We're babysitting Back to the Future, which, Back to the Future sucks,
172000	175000	because Michael J. Fox wouldn't let his likeness be used in the game,
176000	178000	so it has somebody who completely doesn't look like him.
179000	180000	What a bastard.
181000	183000	Or it's either him or his agent or something.
183000	188000	And then we got a time machine, which is one of my favorite older pins,
189000	194000	and I played a whole crap ton of World Cup Soccer 94, which is my favorite pinball ever,
195000	197000	and some Final Fantasy VI Advance.
198000	199000	Good times.
200000	201000	And no World of Warcraft.
202000	205000	Aw, sadness. That's all right. I haven't been playing World of Warcraft either,
206000	208000	and I'll tell you why in a little bit. Let's go over to the one and only Loki.
209000	210000	Hello.
210000	214000	I played this week Project Gotham Racing 3 Land,
215000	217000	which is weird, though, because we have five 360s,
218000	220000	but one of them does not want to land.
221000	225000	I don't know why. It will land other games, but it just doesn't like Project Gotham Racing 3.
226000	227000	I don't know.
228000	229000	So we played four players with that.
230000	233000	Luckily, that day there was someone missing, so it worked out.
234000	236000	Then Saints Row multiplayer, also via System Link.
236000	240000	I swear, you know, there's just not enough support for System Link.
241000	242000	It's sad.
243000	246000	But hopefully we'll get live soon at work and then be able to play anything.
247000	248000	Let's see, other things I played.
249000	250000	Bioshock, more of that.
251000	253000	I'm actually a little bit more into it now.
254000	257000	I forget where the hell I'm at, but it's still been very good,
258000	260000	so definitely looking forward to playing more of that game.
261000	264000	And then, let's see, I tried a little bit more stuff on the 360.
264000	268000	I actually downloaded the full version of Worms, and well, it's Worms,
269000	271000	so I can't really say too much on that.
272000	274000	Let's see, what else did I try out?
277000	285000	Also on the PSP, I found someone had dumped a version of Sega Rally on there that's not out yet,
286000	287000	but it's actually very awesome.
288000	291000	Sega Rally Revo, I know it's going to be on most other systems.
291000	295000	I think they just drop in the Revo part for the PSP version though,
296000	298000	but it's cool. It's very awesome.
299000	300000	If you've played Sega Rally in the arcades, it's exactly like that.
301000	303000	I mean, it looks good too, so I really recommend that one.
304000	306000	And, oh! I almost forgot.
307000	309000	On 360, play Flatout Ultimate Carnage.
310000	311000	Fucking love this game.
312000	314000	This game right now, I think, best racing game of the year.
315000	316000	Hands down.
317000	318000	That's a pretty hefty title.
318000	321000	It's fucking fun. It's got, you know, Flatout used to love the game first off,
322000	323000	because you can crash into things.
324000	325000	Now, the first game really pissed me off,
326000	328000	because when you'd crash into objects on the track,
329000	331000	you would kind of get stuck on them, and that kind of sucked.
332000	334000	But, they went back, fixed all that shit.
335000	337000	Now there's like 6,000 things on the track to crash into,
338000	342000	and you see all of them, you know, all strewn about on the track.
343000	345000	Then they have like this Ultimate Carnage mode,
345000	348000	which is basically like the takedown mode in Burnout,
349000	350000	and it's really fun.
351000	353000	And then they've also got Destruction Derby,
354000	355000	and of course the Ragdoll Olympics.
356000	357000	Highly recommend this game when it comes out in October.
358000	359000	I'm definitely picking it up.
360000	362000	As far as arcade racers, it's definitely the best one this year.
363000	365000	I'm not sure if people would agree as far as sim racers.
366000	367000	I'm sure Project Gotham Racing 4 will take that.
368000	370000	But as far as arcade racers go,
371000	372000	if you want something that's pretty fun,
372000	376000	definitely check out Burnout, not Burnout, Flatout, Ultimate Carnage.
377000	379000	I was going to say, isn't this the game that I seem to recall reading
380000	381000	on one of the big blogs out there,
382000	383000	and I'm sorry, I forget which one,
384000	385000	but they have like a side-by-side comparison of the box art
386000	388000	from Flatout to Burnout, and it's like the same fucking box,
389000	390000	but just with a different title?
391000	393000	Basically, but, you know, Flatout is a completely different game.
394000	395000	I mean, their thing is, you know,
396000	398000	the fact that you can crash into a bunch of different objects on the course.
399000	400000	You know, Burnout doesn't really have that.
400000	403000	It's mainly just crashing into the cars and exploding and stuff like that.
404000	405000	So it's a different type of game,
406000	407000	but I really recommend checking it out.
408000	409000	It's pretty awesome.
410000	411000	I played the demo for a good half an hour at least,
412000	413000	and probably will play it a little bit more until it comes out.
414000	417000	Then, of course, I also tried out Worms 2,
418000	420000	Open Warfare on the PSP.
421000	422000	Once again, that's also Worms,
423000	424000	and, you know, I don't know why the hell I'm playing these Worms games.
425000	426000	It's probably because I can get them for free.
427000	428000	Because you're a whore for worms.
428000	429000	Yeah, it's a fun game.
430000	432000	It's just, you know, it's a fun game to play with other people.
433000	434000	It's kind of like a board game, almost.
435000	436000	You need other people to make it fun,
437000	438000	because the computer sucks.
439000	440000	Only on this show would saying,
441000	442000	you're a whore for worms actually make sense.
443000	444000	Like, could you imagine if I walked up to,
445000	446000	like, just a random person on the street,
447000	448000	you're a whore for worms!
449000	450000	You're a worm whore!
451000	452000	Unless they liked worms.
453000	454000	Or were a fisherman.
455000	456000	Do you think there is such a thing as, like, worm fetish?
456000	457000	That's really gross.
458000	459000	Probably. There's sick people in the world.
460000	461000	There's fish fetish for everything.
462000	463000	That's what they say.
464000	465000	Seriously?
466000	467000	Do we have anybody in the chatroom with a worm fetish?
468000	469000	Everybody in the chatroom is talking about their gaming weeks.
470000	471000	I don't care what you play in your gaming weeks.
472000	473000	We haven't asked any of you.
474000	475000	I know.
476000	477000	Oh, no, dude.
478000	479000	I'm trying to see if there's any other stuff that catches my eye in chat.
480000	481000	I like DJ Jenai, because he's got, like, old school stuff in his gaming week,
482000	483000	like Mighty Bomb Jack and Mappy.
483000	485000	That's pretty old, right?
486000	487000	Hey, 1942 in Lode Runner.
488000	490000	But in Kaboom, on this, uh, the Activision's hit Remix, which sucks.
491000	492000	Kaboom is awesome.
493000	494000	Wait, you didn't like the Remix?
495000	496000	We were talking about Kunio games earlier.
497000	498000	No, I just didn't like the, Activision hits Remix on the PSP.
499000	500000	It's just, I don't know.
501000	502000	Wait, but isn't that the only system they put it out on, is the Remix ones?
503000	504000	Like, all the souped up titles?
505000	506000	Well, they weren't really souped up.
507000	508000	These were just the standard games.
509000	510000	Oh.
510000	513000	This is the classic one that's going to be redone, you know, with the ones that they had in, like, Xbox Live Arcade.
514000	515000	This is just the old one.
516000	520000	It was a collection of, like, 70-some Activision titles, you know, like Kaboom, Pitfall, Pitfall 2, etc.
521000	522000	Oh, okay.
523000	524000	Which is okay.
525000	526000	If you really want a collection of those old games, then great.
527000	528000	Pick that up.
529000	530000	I'm sure it's dirt cheap by now.
531000	532000	I don't know.
533000	534000	It's just not for me.
535000	536000	I'm not, I don't want to play it on that console.
536000	539000	Hey, I was playing Worms, and I was getting achievements on that.
540000	541000	What was I playing?
542000	543000	There was something else I was playing.
544000	545000	Oh, I played Mutant Storm Reloaded.
546000	548000	I played that, and I was getting some more achievements on that as well.
549000	550000	Oh, actually, no.
551000	552000	I was looking through my arcade games.
553000	556000	I'm like, I own, like, 40 arcade games, and I don't have the high scores on any of them among my friends.
557000	558000	I'm like, which one can I possibly get the high score on?
559000	560000	And I was like, okay.
561000	562000	I don't know.
563000	564000	I don't know.
564000	565000	I don't have the high score on.
566000	570000	And I tried on Mutant Storm Reloaded, and I just didn't have enough time to dedicate to it.
571000	572000	How many games am I whipping your ass on?
573000	574000	I don't know.
575000	576000	I don't play live arcade games that much, so probably a lot.
577000	578000	Just curious.
579000	580000	All finished?
581000	582000	I'm all finished.
583000	584000	Oh, Call of Duty 4 multiplayer, the beta.
585000	586000	Oh.
587000	588000	It's pretty awesome.
589000	590000	Are you in it legally?
591000	592000	I am in it legally.
592000	593000	Call of Duty actually put me in the first wave.
594000	595000	Are you allowed to talk about it?
596000	597000	Fuck if I know.
598000	599000	Okay, let me put it this way.
600000	601000	It's Call of Duty.
602000	603000	I mean, shit, they haven't really changed much since, you know, 2.
604000	605000	And it's no modern day stuff.
606000	607000	It looks awesome.
608000	609000	That's it.
610000	611000	I mean, if you want me to describe it for you, go play Call of Duty 3, but just imagine it's futuristic.
612000	613000	Or modern day.
614000	615000	I mean, it's basically the same damn thing.
616000	617000	It's good.
618000	619000	People are loving this game.
619000	621000	You know, it ran really smooth.
622000	623000	Didn't have any lag issues.
624000	625000	Just, it looks awesome, and I kind of figured it would.
626000	630000	So, you know, I will definitely be picking it up when it comes out, but just so you know, it looks good.
631000	632000	All right.
633000	638000	Well, we're going to go over to Casper, the gay, and find out about his gaming week and what kind of stuff he's been playing.
639000	646000	I've just been doing the virtual console thing, just playing the heck out of Super Metroid, which is still one of the best games ever.
646000	653000	So, I'm not very far, because it's actually the first time I've ever played this game, because I think it was in a coma in the 90s when it came out.
654000	655000	So, I'm like, oh my God, this is like my first time playing, and it's awesome.
656000	658000	So, you know, I've got all the cool power-ups, and it's awesome.
659000	663000	And then Neotopia, or whatever it's called, which is that Zelda clone for TurboGrafx.
664000	665000	Neotopia is great.
666000	667000	I've got Neotopia and Neotopia 2.
668000	669000	Oh, do you have Neotopia 2?
670000	671000	I have TurboGrafx.
671000	677000	Okay, okay. The thing about it is, it's a Zelda clone. If you like Zelda games, you'll like it for that old-school gameplay.
678000	680000	But there's some reasons why Zelda was way more popular.
681000	687000	For instance, if you bomb a cave or you bomb a wall in a dungeon, you have to re-bomb it the next time you go back in, which is a real pain in the ass.
688000	689000	That's what they get for being HuCard games.
690000	693000	Yeah, it's horrible. And then if you go into the cave or something, you automatically have to start talking to the person.
694000	699000	You have no choice. Or if somebody's in a dungeon in a room, every time you pass through that room, you start talking to them again.
699000	701000	I'm like, ugh! But it's still fun. It's good stuff.
702000	703000	Again, HuCard games.
704000	711000	It's good times, though. I haven't played any new stuff, so I want to play Metroid, the new one, so that looks pretty awesome.
713000	716000	Kick them off the TV watching Battlestar reruns and go play Metroid. It's awesome.
717000	721000	Alright. Well, I've got to talk about my gaming week.
721000	728000	Oh, hell. I don't know if I really want to say anything about my gaming week. I'd better brace myself.
729000	736000	This week, I played Final Fantasy XI of a lot this week.
737000	738000	Oh, hi, Shane. How are you?
739000	740000	Hello. I'm good.
741000	743000	I've been playing Final Fantasy XI. I went back.
744000	748000	What's the old saying, Shane? Final Fantasy XI is like an abusive husband?
748000	753000	Yeah. You just keep going back to them, despite the fact that they abuse you and beat you up.
754000	761000	Yeah, I went back. But why, Shane, did we end up going back to Final Fantasy XI, out of curiosity?
762000	763000	There's a camera on me.
764000	771000	Because I wanted to play something, and I had codes that would make it so I could play for a month for free, so I was like, I'm going to do that.
772000	775000	And then you got a free month on WoW, and you're like, okay, I'll come play Final Fantasy XI.
775000	781000	And then we got two of our friends to play, too. So we're all just going back. We're migrating back.
782000	788000	The thing about it is that they've changed a lot since I've been gone, and I was kind of curious what all has changed.
789000	794000	And it does seem like they have fixed a lot of things that were pissing me off before, such as they got rid of a lot of the gold sellers.
795000	798000	The economy seems to be a lot better than it was before. Seems like it's stabilized.
799000	799000	The economy changed?
800000	802000	Yeah, seriously, the economy changes. It happens in a lot of MMOs.
802000	808000	But here's the most hilarious part, and old-school OLR listeners will really get a kick out of this.
809000	810000	You know what server we're playing on?
811000	812000	Faerie.
813000	814000	The Faerie server!
815000	816000	We're playing on the Faerie server!
817000	818000	And we're pretending we're noobs.
819000	821000	You have to go back to Episode 80 to get these jokes when I was first getting into Final Fantasy XI.
822000	823000	But yes, we're playing on the Faerie server.
824000	825000	For what reason?
826000	827000	What was it?
828000	830000	I don't remember. It was something to do with live journal trauma or something.
830000	831000	You have to go back.
832000	833000	It's really fun, though.
834000	836000	I'm actually having a really good time playing this time.
837000	838000	So am I. I keep leveling everything I can.
839000	843000	But I'm wondering if it's one of those things where when I have to start partying in the dunes, if it's going to wear off real quick.
844000	846000	We don't know what the dunes are. Give me my drink, Eddie!
847000	848000	This is great radio. What?
849000	850000	He's trying to steal my drink.
851000	854000	We don't know what the dunes are yet. Remember, we're just low levels.
855000	856000	We'll be there soon.
857000	858000	We've never played before.
858000	860000	I'm looking in the chat room to see what people are saying.
861000	863000	Ghostguy says Final Fantasy XI equals not so good.
864000	864000	Cry.
865000	867000	Well, that person's name that you just read equals not so good.
868000	871000	SSJ100Matt says, why isn't Jamie on top of Rob about this?
872000	873000	Well, Shane took her mic, for one.
874000	875000	Well, I needed talking to something.
876000	877000	I would be curious what Jamie's thoughts are on all of this.
878000	879000	I'm going to go ask her. I'll start by.
880000	881000	I don't care.
882000	883000	Oh, I thought you were going to call me an addict or yell at me or something.
884000	885000	No.
885000	887000	The play is up to you.
888000	890000	Oh, I like this. This is the kinder, gentler Jamie than we had a few episodes ago.
891000	892000	No, this is the indifferent, apathetic Jamie.
893000	894000	Oh, I see. This is the meh Jamie.
895000	896000	Yeah.
897000	898000	The meh. What do you think about that, Jamie?
899000	900000	Meh.
901000	902000	I didn't just play Final Fantasy XI, though.
903000	905000	Because I swear I'm going to limit my time on it this time around.
906000	907000	I'll let you guys know how long I actually stick with it.
908000	910000	But I also was playing some more Blue Dragon and made some more progress on that.
911000	912000	I'm enjoying Blue Dragon.
912000	915000	I realize the critics didn't exactly give it the best scores in the world,
916000	918000	but I'm actually having a good time with it.
919000	921000	And then some stuff on Xbox Live Arcade. Hello, Fatal Fury Special.
922000	923000	I had to give that a go.
924000	926000	It's the same game, basically, from the Neo Geo.
927000	928000	They didn't really change anything, but that's okay,
929000	930000	because Fatal Fury is an awesome game.
931000	932000	But they did add Xbox Live support and achievements.
933000	936000	For five bucks, I actually think it's one of the better fighting game deals on Xbox Live right now.
937000	939000	I think it's a better value than the $10 Street Fighter II that's up there now,
939000	942000	although I am still looking forward to the Street Fighter II HD remix.
943000	944000	Street Fighter is $10?
945000	946000	Street Fighter is $10, believe it or not.
947000	948000	I thought that Virtual Console games were expensive.
949000	950000	Well, Virtual Console games are expensive.
951000	952000	I mean, like $5 for Mario Brothers.
953000	954000	Excuse me, not even Super Mario Brothers.
955000	956000	Or $5 for Metroid. Hello.
957000	959000	You should see the PlayStation Network game prices.
960000	967000	Granted, they're more full games, but we're talking like $40, $20.
967000	972000	I want to say one other thing I've noticed about Final Fantasy XI
973000	978000	is that it seems like there's a lot less OMGWTF-type kids on there now,
979000	981000	and I'm noticing there's a lot of older people that are getting into Final Fantasy XI.
982000	986000	A lot of stay-at-home moms seem to be playing the game. It's interesting.
987000	990000	So what do you think I should see about getting back in?
991000	992000	Are you a stay-at-home mom?
993000	994000	Shut the heck up. Are you actually thinking about coming back?
994000	998000	Well, I'd play it about as much as I'd play World of Warcraft.
999000	1000000	Shane, you gotta hear this!
1001000	1002000	Somebody go, Shane!
1003000	1006000	Well, this is like news-breaking stories here. I'm sure the chat room is like OMG.
1007000	1008000	I have to find my controller again, though.
1009000	1010000	Shane! I'm running!
1011000	1013000	But I haven't installed all that square crap off my computer.
1014000	1015000	Run faster!
1016000	1017000	I don't know where my discs are either.
1018000	1021000	If you want, you have to play like you've never played before, though.
1021000	1023000	That's okay. I only got to, what, level 15?
1024000	1025000	There you go. You'll forget everything.
1026000	1027000	She's thinking about it. Oh, this is exciting news.
1028000	1029000	I'm probably actually going to quit World of Warcraft, too.
1030000	1031000	I'm just going to quit MMOs.
1032000	1033000	I haven't quit World of Warcraft. I should say that.
1034000	1037000	It's just that I have a free month because I got somebody else to play through the rewards room,
1038000	1041000	so this is my month where I'm going to decide which one I'm going to stick with, if any,
1042000	1043000	because honestly, when I play MMOs...
1044000	1045000	You should totally play World of Warcraft. Bye!
1046000	1048000	It cuts into my console times, so we'll see.
1048000	1050000	I'm going to try to play through Super Metroid.
1051000	1053000	Oh, Super Metroid. Good stuff.
1054000	1056000	You know, I've been looking for a video capture card for the Mac,
1057000	1062000	so we can do Operator 11 stuff with the Super Metroid.
1063000	1064000	We can do our live playthrough and have the video feed actually on it.
1065000	1066000	You actually have to do it this week.
1067000	1068000	I know. We totally will. I just need to get the card.
1069000	1072000	I haven't been doing my show on Tuesday, so we should do that instead of my show.
1073000	1074000	We'll figure something out.
1075000	1076000	Speaking of Operator 11, let's go into housekeeping tonight.
1076000	1077000	Yeah.
1078000	1081000	I want to remind everybody out there, we do have our video feeds now on Operator 11.
1082000	1085000	I don't think it's the most interesting thing in the world to just kind of sit here and watch us do the show,
1086000	1088000	but I'm hoping as time goes on, we'll think of more ways to integrate the video,
1089000	1093000	but what I do want to point you guys to is that we're looking at putting other videos on Operator 11,
1094000	1095000	like us playing new games as they come out.
1096000	1098000	Like Jamie said, we're going to play through Super Metroid and a bunch of other stuff,
1099000	1101000	so keep an eye out on our page on operator11.com.
1102000	1103000	I'm not sure exactly how to get to our profile,
1103000	1106000	but I can tell you our username is orangelanerator. That was a really bad plug, huh?
1107000	1108000	I don't really know how you get there.
1109000	1110000	Best. Plug. Ever.
1111000	1112000	Just find it.
1113000	1114000	All right, so there you go.
1115000	1117000	Let's see, I don't really have a whole lot of other housekeeping.
1118000	1119000	I already talked about that we have new pictures coming.
1120000	1121000	I ate too much pizza.
1122000	1123000	I'm sorry to hear that. I'm actually hungry.
1124000	1125000	Eddie, you want to make another round to talk about?
1126000	1127000	Do you want my breadsticks?
1128000	1129000	Seriously, can I have some breadsticks?
1130000	1131000	Sure.
1131000	1132000	And we're going to get into tonight's gaming news.
1133000	1134000	Hopefully I'm not first.
1135000	1136000	Hey, Rob's first!
1137000	1138000	No, I'm kidding.
1139000	1143000	So, to start things off, let's talk about pathetic stuff,
1144000	1145000	including how pathetic Lair was.
1146000	1148000	Well, personally, I haven't played it,
1149000	1151000	so I don't know if it's pathetic, but based on people's reviews of it,
1152000	1154000	for example, IGN gave it a 4.9,
1155000	1156000	I would say it's pretty pathetic,
1156000	1160000	and I guess, you know, there are some control issues and stuff like that.
1161000	1163000	Well, to, I guess, help save face,
1164000	1165000	Sony has figured, you know what,
1166000	1167000	the reason why our game is getting bad scores
1168000	1170000	is because reviewers just don't know how to review our game.
1171000	1173000	Yeah, it's never a good argument.
1174000	1178000	So, what they did was they sent out reviewers guides for Lair.
1179000	1182000	They basically sent IGN a guide of how to review their game,
1182000	1185000	because they figure, oh, you're stupid and you don't know how to play our game.
1186000	1189000	Yeah, that really makes you look cool.
1190000	1194000	So, apparently, six of the 21 pages of the guide
1195000	1196000	are devoted to the game's controls,
1197000	1201000	and I guess it has, you know, like a fact or something in it.
1202000	1204000	That's so retarded.
1204000	1211000	Ghostguy in our chat room says Lair is lame.
1212000	1214000	I don't know, I will withhold judgment until I have a chance to play it.
1215000	1215000	It looked good, though.
1216000	1218000	It looked like the game that could save the PlayStation 3
1219000	1222000	from all this, you know, that people are saying at it.
1223000	1224000	So, what went wrong, Loki?
1225000	1227000	It just kind of sucked.
1228000	1228000	I don't know.
1229000	1230000	I think one of the things was, first off,
1231000	1232000	you had to use the motion controls.
1232000	1235000	It wasn't just, you know, you can turn them off or it's optional.
1236000	1237000	You had to use them.
1238000	1240000	They were kind of floaty.
1241000	1243000	There was, I guess, some lag between certain things,
1244000	1247000	and I don't know, it's just a lot harder than people thought.
1248000	1249000	So...
1250000	1253000	Mr. DeBucket in our chat room at chat.orangestonesradio.com says
1254000	1257000	Lair is better on PSP via remote play.
1257000	1261000	You know, gimmick. That's all I'm saying.
1262000	1264000	Well, you know, it's interesting that that gets brought up
1265000	1267000	because it makes me think about the whole DS Wii thing.
1268000	1269000	Should we have seen something with that by now?
1270000	1271000	Oh, I guess we have the Pokemon game, huh?
1272000	1274000	I guess we do have a little bit of connectivity, but nothing to this extent.
1275000	1276000	That's cool, but here's the thing, though.
1277000	1279000	I mean, I don't want to get into other stories or anything,
1280000	1282000	but I'm just saying, you know, the remote play isn't like,
1283000	1285000	it's not like the DS thing with the Wii,
1285000	1289000	where, you know, that's actually being used as a controller,
1290000	1292000	and it actually has an interface on there and menus and stuff.
1293000	1294000	It's different than what's on the screen.
1295000	1297000	It's actually, you know, kind of an accessory to the game.
1298000	1301000	Whereas remote play is, look, I can play this from, you know,
1302000	1303000	Starbucks down the street.
1304000	1306000	I'm playing my PlayStation 3 on my PSP.
1307000	1309000	I mean, it doesn't work completely.
1310000	1311000	Even that's kind of broken.
1312000	1313000	I mean, sure, you can do it, but, you know,
1313000	1317000	it's just like, sure, you can emulate PlayStation 1 games on there,
1318000	1321000	but not perfectly, so I don't know.
1322000	1323000	It is a gimmick.
1324000	1325000	I can understand watching the movies, you know,
1326000	1327000	maybe streaming that stuff when you're on the go,
1328000	1329000	you know, waiting in the airport and you have free Wi-Fi
1330000	1334000	or something like that, but playing Lair on the go,
1335000	1338000	I mean, if you really want to play Lair on your PSP,
1339000	1341000	make a version of Lair for your PSP.
1341000	1342000	Alright, let me go ahead and say this,
1343000	1345000	because, you know, I know Loki's dying for me to get to this,
1346000	1347000	so he can go off even more than he already is,
1348000	1349000	but of course, you know, as you guys know,
1350000	1352000	Lair has that connectivity between the PSP and the PlayStation 3,
1353000	1356000	and a Sony technical insider has been spotted saying,
1357000	1358000	quote, it's a nice start.
1359000	1361000	Over time, I'm sure we'll have more advanced features.
1362000	1365000	So is this possibly just the beginning of more to come for the console?
1366000	1367000	Well, remember when they were shown off the console
1368000	1369000	and they had the Formula One racing game
1369000	1373000	and they were like, look, you can use your PSP as a rear view mirror.
1374000	1376000	Why? Why would you do that?
1377000	1378000	Where are you going to put it?
1379000	1381000	You're just going to set it, stand next to you or something.
1382000	1383000	Just put it in your damn, you know,
1384000	1387000	they have rear view mirrors on your car model in the game.
1388000	1390000	Why would you need to have it on a separate screen?
1391000	1393000	It's just a gimmick. Fucking gimmick is what it is.
1394000	1397000	You know, and granted, the DS connectivity with the Wii,
1397000	1401000	you know, very brief, you know, all one game of it,
1402000	1405000	is very gimmicky as well because you don't really need it to play.
1406000	1409000	But, you know, at least it is something in additional to the game.
1410000	1412000	It's not like, oh look, you can sort of control the game with this.
1413000	1416000	There were some other, when they were doing the GameCube too,
1417000	1419000	there was some cooler like connectivity with the Game Boy Advance
1420000	1422000	because like when you were playing, I think it was one of the Metal Gear games,
1423000	1424000	something like that, it was like your sonar
1424000	1427000	and it was like having your own cool like device but in the game.
1428000	1431000	So it was a gimmick but it was like practical too, so.
1432000	1434000	Oh, no, here's the thing, the reason why they did that
1435000	1438000	is so that you can make the racing game more like real life.
1439000	1441000	And by the way, Mr. DeBucket in chat wants to point out,
1442000	1444000	it was a tech demo, you dumbass, it wasn't even in the game.
1445000	1446000	I know, that's what I'm saying, it was the tech demos
1447000	1448000	when they were first showing the PlayStation 3 on.
1449000	1450000	It makes it more like real life because what you do
1450000	1453000	is you get a woman to sit next to you while you drive.
1454000	1455000	Where's something I can throw at Rob right now?
1456000	1457000	I'm not even finished, and you have the PSP
1458000	1461000	and the woman's watching and she's nagging about everything you're doing wrong.
1462000	1464000	Where's something I can throw at Rob? Give me one of your Pikachus.
1465000	1467000	Throw one of these breadsticks, these things will knock me out.
1468000	1469000	They're like rock solid.
1470000	1473000	I think the Operator 11 people heard me banging it against the wall earlier.
1474000	1475000	These things are tough.
1476000	1477000	Alright, anyway, that's all I have to say.
1477000	1479000	It's okay because Rob drives like Grandma.
1480000	1482000	See? You're criticizing my driving.
1483000	1488000	Now, Rob, the game they even admitted when they were showing off the connectivity,
1489000	1491000	yeah, you can use it to control your dragon.
1492000	1493000	Oh, by the way, you can't land your dragon or anything
1494000	1497000	because there's no additional L2 buttons or R2 and stuff like that,
1498000	1499000	so some of the controls are broken.
1500000	1503000	Then why even put some half-assed control system in there
1504000	1505000	that you can play this thing remotely? It's stupid.
1505000	1508000	It's just like those people that use their media center extender
1509000	1511000	to view the internet on their 360.
1512000	1513000	It's stupid. It's gimmicky.
1514000	1515000	You don't need to do that.
1516000	1517000	Well, if you'd like to comment on Loki's rants,
1518000	1519000	we always welcome your emails.
1520000	1522000	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and of course our chat room.
1523000	1524000	Send them directly to Loki.
1525000	1527000	Send them to him. I don't need them.
1528000	1532000	And while you're at it, sign him up for lots of Nigerian bank lotteries.
1532000	1534000	I already get enough spam.
1537000	1541000	And Loki's definitely interested in anything you have on Viagra or Syalis.
1542000	1544000	I will forward all my email to you, Rob.
1545000	1547000	He also wants bigger breasts.
1550000	1553000	All right, I'm done. That's all I wanted to say about the connectivity.
1554000	1559000	Well, you know our favorite crayon eater was going around in his days at Sony
1559000	1565000	saying that the PS3 was a computer and a multimedia whatever.
1566000	1571000	Kazurai, who is now the man again, said, and I'm going to quote,
1572000	1575000	I'd like to clearly say the PS3 is a game machine.
1576000	1577000	It's nothing more than that.
1578000	1582000	No, it is not. In fact, all their commercials say computer entertainment system.
1583000	1584000	It's a fucking computer.
1585000	1586000	No, it is not. It's the Sony PlayStation.
1586000	1590000	I mean, it is a fucking computer. You've been saying computer.
1591000	1593000	Just because your fucking computer does not sell,
1594000	1597000	does not mean that you have to start calling it a game machine now.
1598000	1599000	It's a fucking computer. Stick with it.
1600000	1602000	Who turned Loki to 11 tonight? That's what I want to know.
1603000	1605000	Why don't you just make 10 louder?
1606000	1609000	No, he's too loud. Here's my thing.
1610000	1612000	This is why I think this is a newsworthy quote.
1612000	1616000	Because of the fact that I remember them selling the PlayStation 3 as a computer.
1617000	1620000	And to some extent, I think this is where Sony excels best.
1621000	1624000	Like, what makes the PSP better than a DS to some people?
1625000	1627000	Now again, you can argue all you want until you're blue in the face about the games,
1628000	1633000	but some people prefer the PSP because you can surf the internet on it as built in.
1634000	1636000	You can listen to MP3s, help people download our show.
1637000	1638000	A lot of people download this podcast and listen to it on it.
1639000	1640000	You can carry the pictures with you anywhere you go,
1640000	1644000	and pretty soon they're going to have the video out and you can watch the movies.
1645000	1648000	Sony actually does this pretty well at being more than just a game system.
1649000	1655000	And that's kind of what makes the PlayStation 3 a little bit appealing as well.
1656000	1660000	What's the one thing that has people more excited than anything about PlayStation 3?
1661000	1665000	Home. Is home a game? No, it's kind of something outside the box.
1665000	1670000	So for them to go out and say a quote like this is a little bit like, huh?
1671000	1673000	But you're like the worst at being a game machine.
1674000	1675000	You do everything else really good. I don't know.
1676000	1678000	Guess what? People didn't care that you can load Linux on it.
1679000	1682000	That's why it's now a game system and not a fucking computer.
1683000	1687000	Well, okay, fine then. $600 is too much for a game system.
1689000	1691000	$600 was cheap for a computer, too much for a game system.
1692000	1693000	So now it's too much for a game system.
1693000	1700000	All right, let's see. Son of Dad says PlayStation 3 right now is a cheap Blu-ray player, no more, no less.
1701000	1703000	There might be some Sony fans that disagree, but I don't know.
1704000	1708000	I mean, I still have yet to buy a PlayStation 3 because I have to admit I feel kind of similar. Sorry.
1709000	1710000	There's nothing out there to play.
1711000	1716000	Even, I mean, Ratchet and Clank Future, that looks pretty good and Resistance was good.
1717000	1719000	I'm sure when Final Fantasy 13 comes out, I'll be like,
1719000	1723000	Hail, Sony! Welcome into my house! Hello, PlayStation 3! I love you!
1724000	1728000	Well, then you'll have a lot of time to save up money, you know, when it comes out spring 2009.
1729000	1730000	Is that the current release they're saying?
1731000	1732000	No, I'm just guessing because, you know, that's shit.
1733000	1736000	I mean, because it'll come out in Japan, you know, probably Christmas next year or something,
1737000	1740000	and then we'll see it maybe spring or summer of 2009.
1741000	1745000	But don't worry, don't worry. Good games are coming to the PlayStation 3 someday.
1745000	1749000	All right. Thank you, Jamie, for the quote.
1750000	1752000	It certainly livened up our show a little bit tonight.
1753000	1754000	Nah.
1755000	1756000	Except for you.
1757000	1767000	Anyway, so guess what? You can't talk about PSP Homebrew on the official Sony forums.
1767000	1776000	Wow! Surprise! You know, you can't talk about cracking their system on their own forums.
1777000	1778000	How dare they do that?
1779000	1783000	I'm more concerned with the fact that it took them this long to ban that chat.
1784000	1785000	What?
1786000	1790000	Well, you know, the PSP is only a game system. You shouldn't be doing everything.
1791000	1792000	Shut up and read the story!
1792000	1801000	So, yeah, if you talk about Homebrew, you will be banned from Sony's official chat room or forum.
1802000	1803000	And guess what?
1804000	1805000	We ban you!
1806000	1814000	Since we're on the topic of Homebrew, it should not be a surprise that with the PlayStation Slim coming out,
1814000	1824000	the PlayStation Portable Slim, that they've already cracked, or not really cracked, but dumped the 3.6 firmware that is included with it.
1825000	1830000	So you know what that means. First they dump it, then they crack it, and then you run your Homebrew.
1831000	1835000	So it's only a matter of time before I will be picking up a PSP Slim.
1835000	1843000	You know, I know I can say this, and it won't go anywhere, so nobody tell him, but I think I know what I'm going to get William for.
1844000	1847000	I'm totally serious here. I think I know what I'm going to get William for his birthday. I'm going to get him a PSP Slim.
1848000	1851000	Because funny enough, William is a huge Sony fanboy.
1852000	1856000	And I don't know what it is. He doesn't even play a whole lot of video games, but every time we go into Best Buy,
1857000	1859000	we'll be looking at Motorstorm or whatever, and he's always like,
1859000	1864000	don't you want a PlayStation 3? Look at it. It's so beautiful. Why don't you have a PlayStation 3 in your house? You ever heard of the game system?
1865000	1867000	Why don't you get a PlayStation 3? I'm like, are you going to buy me one? And he's like, no.
1868000	1872000	But I think he really wants a PSP, so I'm going to get him one, because he thinks they're cool.
1873000	1878000	I know, but I'm going to get him the Slim, because they're new, and then I can go, look, it's a new toy too, and I think he'll get a kick out of that.
1879000	1884000	So Sony fanboys who are pissed off at the show right now because we're, you know, knocking Sony,
1885000	1887000	I just thought I'd let you know they are still getting some of our money.
1887000	1889000	Because, you know, I do think the PSP is pretty awesome now.
1890000	1894000	It was a slow start, but then again, the DS had a slow start too, so what can you say?
1895000	1903000	Well, anyhow, one thing, of course, that you can play on those PSPs is Lair, which goes back and forth, you know, with a little remote connectivity.
1904000	1906000	But yes, we have one more Lair story for you guys.
1907000	1915000	There's a brand new hot coffee mode that's been discovered inside Lair. Yes, there's a hot coffee mode, except it's not really what you think.
1915000	1926000	If you actually watch the video of the hot coffee mode, it's actually just something you unlock where somebody brews, we're watching it here in the studio, so you can hear it on the TV.
1927000	1929000	Somebody just brews a pot of hot coffee.
1930000	1937000	All you have to do is enter in this big, long string at the cheat menu, and you'll be welcomed with this video of somebody making hot coffee.
1938000	1940000	That's the best joke ever.
1940000	1946000	It's kind of stupid, but like it's stupid funny. Like a Jim Carrey movie, it's stupid funny.
1947000	1948000	That's great.
1949000	1957000	By the way, that code that you can enter in, 686-F7-420-636-F66666565.
1958000	1961000	If you missed any part of this show and need a transcription, get out a pen next time.
1962000	1966000	And guess what, those also happen to be the reviews that this game got as well.
1966000	1970000	Good job, Loki.
1971000	1983000	As I was reminded in the chat room, though, the PSP has already cracked the firmware, and they're going to be releasing a...
1984000	1990000	I guess Team M33 is going to be releasing a CFW 3.6 firmware for it.
1990000	1996000	That's one of the better jokes we've had in a while on this program. Good job, Loki.
1997000	2000000	Yes, chat room, now you two get to beat that one into the ground.
2001000	2006000	So, some news for our UK listeners. Sega's got some dates out for some of their stuff.
2006000	2026000	Virtua Fighter V, who gives a crap on Xbox 360, will be 26th October, Universe at War for PC and Ghost Squad on Wii is 2nd November, Sonic Rush Adventure for the DS will be next week, Crazy Taxi, Fair Wars also will be later this month on PSP.
2026000	2035000	Sonic Rivals 2 will be on November 2nd, and The Golden Compass will be on November 30th. There you go.
2036000	2040000	Hitstun asks, do they get Virtua Fighter V 360 before we do?
2041000	2042000	I'm not sure.
2043000	2044000	Probably about the same week, right?
2045000	2046000	We're getting the last week of October.
2047000	2054000	Interesting. Well, let's go to some release dates and travel the world and see what's coming out right now in all different places, not just from Sega.
2054000	2063000	Oh, yes. In fact, this week's actually pretty good. We're starting to get into some of the better stuff, you know, fourth quarter stuff for all systems.
2064000	2074000	And I know next week, well, I'm not a huge fan of it, but NHL 08 and NHL 2K8 are both coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and 360.
2075000	2082000	Then we have EA's competition for Tony Hawk's Skate that's also going to be coming out next week.
2082000	2098000	Let's see here. What? Anyways, Heavenly Sword will be making its way out next week, and hopefully that's another game that we will not be seeing a reviewer's guide going out for as well.
2099000	2101000	I have high hopes for Heavenly Sword. It looks really good.
2102000	2102000	It looks okay.
2103000	2104000	It could be what Laird, unfortunately, was not.
2104000	2117000	I am waiting a little bit to get it just because, you know, I don't know, the demo, it was short and I didn't enjoy myself too much with it, so we'll see.
2118000	2123000	Also next week, Dirt on PlayStation 3, finally getting that game.
2124000	2129000	On PlayStation 2,.hack//G.U. Volume 3, the last game in that trilogy.
2129000	2135000	Guilty Gear XX Accent Core on PlayStation 2, that should make a lot of import fans happy.
2136000	2145000	Let's see, then also on 360, you will be getting the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Game of the Year Edition.
2146000	2150000	That's going to be including both the expansion, I believe, and some of the download content for that.
2151000	2156000	In other words, this is the release that fucks you all over who bought the game originally at full price and then all the expansions at full price.
2156000	2160000	If you want the PlayStation 3 one, guess what, it's not coming out. It got delayed.
2161000	2166000	Fatal Inertia is also coming out in 360 next week, as well as Kengo, Legend of the Nine.
2167000	2172000	And let's see, then also on the Wii, Big Fat Nothing.
2173000	2177000	On PC, of course, Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, the Game of the Year Edition.
2178000	2184000	Democracy, apparently we're getting Democracy on September 11th, how appropriate.
2184000	2189000	And some crappy Sherlock Holmes game, that's interesting.
2190000	2193000	And then, of course, my favorite for the DS, Drawn to Life is coming out next week.
2194000	2196000	That looks really awesome, so that would be cool.
2197000	2199000	And then, of course, if you're a music game fan, Jam Sessions.
2200000	2207000	I'm actually thinking about picking this up just because I need some guitar stuff in the mixes I do, so Jam Sessions.
2208000	2209000	That's pretty much it.
2209000	2217000	Good times. Lots of stuff coming out on the Japan release calendar for September 13th, 2007.
2218000	2224000	On the Xbox 360, Musou Orochi is coming out. It's an action game. It'll be available on the Xbox 360.
2225000	2228000	It doesn't look like a game they're bringing over here, but it looks like it could be a little bit of fun.
2229000	2234000	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, SSX Blur finally comes out in Japan for you guys over there.
2234000	2240000	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Mega Zone 23, Ali Garland is coming out.
2241000	2242000	That's like old school anime, too.
2243000	2246000	Yet another old school anime having a game made out of it. Who would have thought?
2247000	2248000	Like we don't have 20 million Lupin games.
2249000	2250000	Yeah, I know. But you get those games.
2251000	2253000	Also, on the PlayStation 2, I like this title.
2254000	2259000	I think this is just getting a price reduction because it's going into Best Collection, but it's a game called Happiness Deluxe.
2259000	2263000	And it's even better. It's made by Marvelous Entertainment. So there you go.
2264000	2265000	It's marvelously happy.
2266000	2268000	And Sega's putting out yet another Pachinko game.
2269000	2269000	No!
2270000	2272000	Taisen Pachinko. He's shou... He's shou...
2273000	2274000	Sakura Taisen is coming out.
2275000	2275000	You know what I want to see?
2276000	2277000	Oh, dude, they're doing a Sakura Taisen Pachinko?
2278000	2281000	They should have a Pachinko Xbox Live Arcade game. That'd be funny.
2282000	2283000	That would be actually pretty rad.
2284000	2284000	I think that would be pretty great.
2285000	2287000	You know, then maybe we can find out what we're missing out on over here.
2287000	2290000	Also coming out on the Nintendo DS.
2291000	2294000	I love this. This is my favorite title of the week.
2295000	2296000	Coming out on the Nintendo DS.
2297000	2300000	I Love Dolphin is coming out in Japan.
2301000	2302000	Oh, I bet you do.
2303000	2306000	I would make a comment about that. Knowing certain things about certain people.
2307000	2310000	Here's the best part. It's made by Starfish Entertainment.
2311000	2313000	I Love Dolphin coming to the Nintendo DS.
2314000	2315000	Dolphin safe.
2315000	2316000	Do you know they make a viper called the Dolphin?
2317000	2319000	I don't know. Some Pokemon games and SimCity DS.
2320000	2320000	You know, blah, blah, blah.
2321000	2323000	Oh, I can't forget the PSP. Let me see if there's anything on the PSP worth mentioning.
2324000	2324000	Crap!
2325000	2325000	Oh, Crisis Core!
2326000	2327000	Shit, I think there's a lot of people really excited about that.
2328000	2329000	Crisis Core also out on September 13th.
2330000	2331000	As well as Fate Tiger Coliseum.
2332000	2332000	Ooh.
2333000	2334000	There you go.
2335000	2336000	Those are your release dates for Japan.
2337000	2338000	Well, how about for our friends in the UK?
2339000	2342000	On the 14th is Blazing Angels Secret Missions of World War II.
2342000	2345000	CSI Three Dimensions of Murder.
2346000	2347000	Yay.
2348000	2349000	Dungeons and Dragons Tactics for PSP.
2350000	2352000	Fatal Inertia on Xbox 360.
2353000	2355000	Freshly Picked Tingles Rosy Ruby Land.
2356000	2357000	Hooray!
2358000	2360000	Freshly Picked Tingles. I love those!
2361000	2362000	That's on the DS.
2363000	2364000	I hope it never comes over here.
2365000	2366000	I'm going to import it.
2367000	2368000	It will be in English.
2369000	2370000	We have Heavenly...
2370000	2371000	English, English!
2372000	2374000	That means there will be extra vowels.
2375000	2377000	Extra vowels make everything better.
2378000	2380000	Heavenly Sword on PlayStation 3.
2381000	2383000	Heroes of Mana, which we already have over here.
2384000	2387000	MotoGP07 Sonic Rush Adventure on the 14th.
2388000	2390000	Stranglehold Super Paper Mario on Wii.
2392000	2393000	Yay!
2393000	2399000	Something you guys were talking about reminded me of one other thing that I really missed in Final Fantasy XI.
2400000	2403000	And that was boss monsters with no vowels in their name.
2404000	2405000	Like...
2407000	2408000	Is the name of a dragon.
2409000	2410000	Or no, I think there's a dragon you have to fight called...
2415000	2416000	Good times.
2416000	2423000	Good times. Anyways, as with most games, they've been getting updates and patches every now and then.
2424000	2431000	And one in particular that happened this last week was BioShock got a title update to fix a few things.
2432000	2433000	Just some minor stuff I guess.
2433000	2445000	Updates improve stability when loading autosaves and overall game stability corrects audio during title menu loading and addresses AI behaviors regarding health stations.
2446000	2448000	So, that's kind of interesting.
2449000	2456000	Another interesting thing though is of course people picking apart the PC version found a couple of notations for Plasmid Pack 1.
2457000	2461000	Which is believed to be a download that's going to happen later on.
2461000	2466000	Including some brand new Plasmids that you'll be able to buy from the machines and whatnot.
2467000	2469000	So hopefully we'll see some download content a little bit later on.
2470000	2472000	But of course, nothing official yet.
2477000	2480000	I'm choking on breath. Yes, I just sounded like a Murloc just then.
2482000	2484000	Loki, keep talking. It's rude of me to talk with my mouth full.
2484000	2490000	That's going to be awesome. I'm looking forward to some new Plasmids.
2491000	2492000	You like new plasma?
2493000	2494000	New Plasmids.
2495000	2497000	Oh, I thought you said plasma. There's people who recycle their plasma.
2498000	2500000	No, new Plasmids for the game. I love this show.
2501000	2507000	Loki, you know what you should check out if you dig that Drawn to Life is there's a game that nobody knows about for GameCube called Monster Island.
2507000	2513000	Where you could basically create your own monsters, draw them out on a screen and then play them in various competitions. It was very cool.
2514000	2515000	Wasn't that like Magic Penjil?
2516000	2518000	Yeah, they had Magic Penjil and they had Graffiti Kingdom that were also the same type of things.
2519000	2520000	Yeah, it was cool though. It was good times if you liked that kind of thing.
2521000	2527000	Magic Penjil, I had a 2DX system that was fighting and we also had popin' music.
2528000	2531000	Yes, I think people drew a penis monster as well.
2532000	2535000	The penis monster was great. I really have to say the penis monster was good.
2535000	2536000	My character...
2537000	2540000	Not that that's, you know, some people don't like that.
2541000	2550000	See, the game is easy to exploit though. My character was just like a teddy bear and I'd draw this big like square that would be attached to it and it would be all blue which would give you like more magic attack or something.
2551000	2552000	What was the attack of the penis monster?
2553000	2554000	It was like, poke it.
2557000	2558000	And swing around.
2559000	2562000	Did it have a similar attack as to a squid? Is that what happened when you poked it?
2562000	2565000	It was just, it would just sit and hunch over.
2566000	2567000	Apparently...
2568000	2569000	That's because you weren't doing it right.
2570000	2572000	Whoever drew the penis monster...
2573000	2574000	Excuse me, what the fuck were you doing?
2575000	2587000	It thought that the hair that someone drew on the testicles was actually like legs so it would walk around on legs of this giant thing and it was the worst Pokemon type game ever.
2587000	2592000	Oh my god. Now that is something we need for the fucking Operator 11.
2593000	2600000	Yeah, too bad the cam just shut off on Op 11 like 5 minutes ago because we got booted out from time feeds because we can only do 40 minute shows on there but whatever.
2601000	2610000	What was I going to say? Oh yeah, Jason, Webmaster Jason, remind me to mark this episode explicit please a little later. Thank you.
2610000	2620000	Seriously though, if you can find Magic Penjal or even better, Graffiti Kingdom, that game is really fun especially for 5 minutes.
2621000	2629000	Oh, it's not fun for 5 minutes. Just, you get your friends over and you're like, you can draw your own characters and give them just time and eventually something perverted is going to come out of...
2630000	2632000	Yeah, we tried to draw a vagina monster so they could fight but we ran out of ink.
2632000	2642000	I think we got the...never mind. I was going to get into female anatomy but probably I shouldn't do that.
2643000	2653000	Let's see, what was I going to say? Mr. DeBucket says, Wangzilla for the win. Also, oh I like this quote from Mr. DeBucket, isn't every GameCube game a game for GameCube that no one knows about?
2654000	2655000	Aww.
2656000	2656000	Touche.
2657000	2660000	Drunami says, I think I still have a save file with a penis monster.
2660000	2664000	Oh, that's right because that was the day that we had Paper Plate Battle Royale.
2665000	2673000	Son of Dad is thinking that the movie Superbad, the end credits, is suddenly reminding him of our discussion right now. So, go figure.
2674000	2678000	Anyhow, moving from penis monster back to Bioshock.
2678000	2690000	God, what can I say about this? Okay, somebody posted on the 2K forums about that basically his brother and him were trying to play the game Bioshock together.
2691000	2697000	But the game wouldn't let him because as you may know, Bioshock on the PC only limits you to activate your account so many times.
2698000	2701000	You only get like five activations for the game and then that's it, you're cut off, no more.
2701000	2708000	And it's been a very controversial maneuver. But what happened, okay, this guy named 2kTechJT responded,
2709000	2714000	there's no other way to view this as one user has purchased the game, not the whole family.
2715000	2722000	So why should your brother play for free? To which everybody goes, hello, hasn't it always been that way?
2722000	2731000	I mean, if you bring a traditional CD, let's say Xbox 360 or Playstation 2 game home, and everybody gets to use that game, right?
2732000	2735000	Hello, this is nothing normal. If you buy a CD, everybody in the house...
2736000	2741000	How about if he wants his brother to play, how about you just log into your brother's account on Windows and fucking play the game?
2742000	2745000	Instead of being a little whiny bitch about it, I want to install it on mine!
2746000	2750000	There's a certain amount of usage that goes along with it.
2750000	2753000	I have to say that I don't let anybody else use my computer.
2754000	2759000	Yeah, but that's just because you're mean. How about you buy a 360 and play it on there? How about that, huh?
2760000	2764000	How about that? Why are people whining so fucking much about this shit?
2765000	2772000	If you know you're not supposed to be copying it for your brother and stuff like that, just have him log into your damn account and do it.
2773000	2777000	Seriously, stop being so fucking lazy and just do what you need to do.
2777000	2779000	What you need to do? Rob...
2780000	2782000	What? What? What? What?
2783000	2790000	Anyway, this is a very important update I need to go here. 2K actually reached out to some of the gaming blogs and said,
2791000	2797000	Just so you know, this 2K Tech JT guy, he's actually not an employee of 2K. He's an outside contractor.
2798000	2802000	Please note that the forum moderator has been incorrectly quoted as a 2K employee.
2802000	2808000	The individual JT Tech 2K works for an outside tech support group and is not an employee of 2K.
2809000	2811000	Additionally, 2K is investigating the validity of the post.
2812000	2819000	I will say this, for all the BS people have been posting all around the internet about Bioshock on the PC,
2820000	2825000	2K has done pretty good on their damage control because there's been a lot of companies out there that would have just kept their mouths shut and just said,
2825000	2833000	Suck it. We don't care. You're buying the game anyway. But hats off to 2K for kind of doing something about all the noise around the internet.
2834000	2835000	So, very cool.
2836000	2842000	Rama would like to say, but Loki, if my account is password locked, I'm not telling it to my brother.
2843000	2845000	Tough. Your brother doesn't get to play Bioshock now, does he?
2846000	2851000	I don't really have a little brother or anything that would find, but I would not want them to find my massive porn collection on my computer.
2851000	2858000	And how old is his little brother anyways? I mean, because maybe he's not of age to be able to play the game.
2859000	2864000	Hmm? Where are the parents? Think of the children?
2865000	2870000	Yes. Loki from Orange Lounge Radio reminding you to think of the children. Alright, I'm done.
2871000	2873000	Think of how tasty they are.
2876000	2877000	Oh my.
2878000	2879000	Barbecued.
2879000	2883000	With, like, asparagus. Asparagus is good.
2884000	2885000	Hello, gaming story.
2886000	2891000	Oh yeah, sorry, I was hungry again. You're eating on my breadsticks. That's okay, because they're bread bricks.
2892000	2897000	So, for some news regarding, again, more information in the UK,
2897000	2911000	it says that the sales for the Xbox 360 actually have increased, and the PSP is having their worst week since launch.
2912000	2915000	Poor Sony baby.
2915000	2927000	But at any rate, what they're claiming is responsible for the increase in Xbox 360 sales would be the Elite model, and the other price reductions for the Premium and Core systems,
2928000	2934000	which are, I guess, making people really, you know, crazy about wanting them.
2934000	2945000	However, with the upcoming launches for the Slim PSP on September 14th overseas, people just still don't care.
2946000	2950000	Well, I was going to say, without sounding like an ass, I mean, this isn't like, or a fanboy or whatever,
2951000	2956000	I think this news is only temporary because the Slims are coming out, and because Christmas Hello is right around the corner,
2957000	2958000	sales for everything are going to pick up.
2959000	2960000	Well, we'll see.
2961000	2962000	We will see.
2962000	2973000	Anyways, so, the Xbox HD DVD add-on, I guess, has gotten a price drop in Europe,
2974000	2977000	which is good, because everyone wants cheap add-ons.
2978000	2982000	It will drop, looks like from 200 euros to 180 euros.
2983000	2985000	So, great.
2986000	2989000	You get a little bit of a discount, and I do, I'm not sure if it's going on over there as well,
2989000	2995000	but I know over here, once you buy it, you do get a rebate for five free HD DVD movies.
2996000	2998000	Fuckers. Not when I bought my HD DVD player.
2999000	3004000	You know what I got? King Kong. It's still in the wrapping, I just would like to point out.
3005000	3007000	You can also get Blu-ray players, too. They're kind of doing the same thing.
3008000	3014000	They are desperate for people to adopt the next-gen video formats, but you should be fine.
3014000	3019000	Do you think they're feeling a little heat, because whether you want to say it's thanks to the PlayStation 3 or whatever,
3020000	3023000	Blu-ray does seem to be pushing a little more of the market share.
3024000	3028000	Yeah, but really, they're counting them as players, Blu-ray players,
3029000	3032000	but really how many people are actually using them for Blu-ray. That's the thing.
3033000	3034000	There is no way of showing that.
3035000	3037000	Well, yeah, but there is no way of showing it.
3037000	3043000	I mean, because, yeah, okay, I use mine for Blu-ray movies sometimes, but I can count on one hand
3044000	3047000	how many times I've watched a Blu-ray movie on there. I mean, it's not a lot.
3048000	3049000	I just don't use the system at all.
3050000	3056000	And if I bought an HD DVD player, I don't think I would use it any more than I'm using the Blu-ray player.
3057000	3063000	I don't know. Personally, I would not buy an add-on for the 360 for any sort of next-gen video format,
3063000	3068000	because at least with the PlayStation 3, if Blu-ray doesn't win out, big deal. It's a fucking game machine.
3069000	3070000	Computer. My mistake.
3071000	3076000	And if, you know, say, HD DVD doesn't win out, then you're stuck with this fucking external drive
3077000	3079000	for, you know, you can't do anything with.
3080000	3082000	So, I don't know.
3083000	3089000	Alright, well, now, one period of time when you're going to have to watch these movies on the HD DVD
3089000	3096000	is a four-hour period between 2 a.m. tonight and 9 in the, or I'm sorry, it actually starts at 2 a.m. tonight
3097000	3098000	and runs to 6 a.m.
3099000	3100000	That's because Xbox Live is going to be down.
3101000	3106000	So, sorry, kids, you're going to have to hold off on yelling the N word and the F-A-G word at each other
3107000	3111000	for four hours while the system is down, because that's all people really do on Xbox Live.
3113000	3114000	Which, by the way, I...
3114000	3118000	So, they call each other nice and fancy?
3121000	3124000	Yes, they call each other nice and fancy.
3126000	3133000	See, you're not helping your hole. You need to call me Casper instead of Big Gay Eddie.
3135000	3137000	Whatever, Rob, you're just a big silly.
3137000	3143000	Well, guys, you just fragged me. Wasn't that fancy?
3144000	3149000	Oh, look at me. I'm on the ground now, all helpless and laid down.
3150000	3153000	It would be awful if someone violated me.
3155000	3163000	Oh, I see you're squatting over and over again above my pelvis. Isn't that nice? Isn't that fancy?
3163000	3166000	What the hell is wrong with you, Eddie?
3167000	3172000	Just because you've been watching what I do on Saturday nights by myself. Don't make fun of me.
3177000	3185000	Wonder Dog Harold sits in our chat room. Snagglepuss is on Xbox Live.
3185000	3189000	I can't even talk.
3190000	3198000	Xbox Live is going to be down. Get over it. By the time most of you downloaded the podcast, it's already done anyway.
3199000	3203000	So, we've spent far too long on this useless story. Jamie, please save the show.
3204000	3208000	I like how Ranma says, Fag, fancy, articulate guys.
3212000	3213000	Who said that?
3213000	3215000	Ranma, you're the best. You're awesome.
3216000	3218000	Why are you talking about a cigarette?
3219000	3221000	I am a fancy, articulate guy.
3222000	3228000	So, according to Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry, man, they're old.
3229000	3233000	I mean, I'm sorry. Aerosmith is really awesome, don't get me wrong.
3234000	3240000	But it's like, I see really good pictures of all of them and then I see really old pictures of all of them.
3240000	3242000	And then I look at Keith Richards and feel better.
3243000	3258000	So, anyway, since they're working hand in hand with the folks behind Guitar Hero 4, and they are going to be, the game is pretty much going to be Aerosmith edition Guitar Hero.
3259000	3265000	So, they told Aerosmith, yeah, it's all going to be about you. Totally about you. Please be in our game.
3265000	3272000	Well, there will be other stuff, of course, but the hope is that the master tracks are Aerosmith, so that'd be cool.
3273000	3276000	Okay, I have a bad joke for you guys.
3277000	3282000	What did Steven Tyler say when Activision asked him to be in the next Guitar Hero game?
3283000	3284000	What did he say?
3285000	3287000	YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH!
3289000	3290000	Yes, that was it.
3291000	3292000	That's fancy talk.
3292000	3296000	That's pretty accurate as being crappy.
3297000	3298000	Anyways...
3299000	3301000	I think something was in the breadsticks at this point.
3302000	3305000	I didn't even eat the breadsticks, Rob, and I'm turning gay.
3306000	3307000	You smelled them.
3307000	3327000	So, anyways, if you're interested in checking out Rock Band and you happen to be living in the United States, guess what? They're going to be doing a road tour. In fact, it's going to be touring from Las Vegas and pretty much most of the country, including stopping in California a few times.
3328000	3329000	I heard they're going to be in Sacramento.
3329000	3340000	Yes, they are going to be in Sacramento. In fact, I was confirming with our boss that we need to do a road trip if they happen to be down here pretty soon.
3341000	3345000	Looks like actually in the next couple weeks, the 23rd or 23rd they're going to be in Sacramento, so we'll have to go check it out.
3346000	3348000	Jamie, are we going to go to the Rock Band show and have some fun?
3349000	3350000	No, I'm going to go see They Might Be Giants.
3351000	3354000	Okay, but it's going to be here for three days. Are you going to see They Might Be Giants for three days?
3354000	3358000	No, I'm going to see them for one day, and that's about as much a concert as I can stand.
3359000	3361000	It's not a concert, it's a play the game. You make your own concert.
3362000	3364000	Oh, play the game, I see. Well then, no.
3365000	3367000	Yes, it's what we do here on this show, Jamie. We talk about playing games, remember?
3368000	3369000	Well, no.
3371000	3373000	Well, Loki, will you go to the Rock Band tour with me?
3374000	3377000	I will definitely go. I'm not sure if it's going to be with you, though, but I will try to make it happen.
3378000	3379000	Oh, gee, thanks.
3380000	3381000	Well, sorry, I don't know if I'm going to.
3381000	3383000	I will definitely go. I probably won't go with you.
3384000	3387000	I will make a trip out there with you, but I will also make a trip out there maybe with my work.
3388000	3394000	I will not, on either of those trips, be singing in the game. Fuck that shit.
3395000	3399000	If it comes down, well, all we've got left is karaoke for you, Bell. Fuck you, I'm leaving.
3400000	3404000	I'm sorry, I thought I heard somebody say that they were doing some type of concert for the thing.
3405000	3406000	Oh, no. You're the concert.
3406000	3413000	No, they basically have this giant semi-truck and there's a stage that they have set up and you play a game.
3414000	3416000	You know what? Screw you, Loki. I'll take Gay Eddie with me.
3417000	3419000	I'll go do it. I'll go play the game.
3420000	3421000	Rob, I'll go.
3422000	3424000	Because, Rob, when you sing, it's nice. And fancy.
3425000	3426000	We'll be the fancy band.
3427000	3431000	Oh, my God. We'll be the fancy band boys. Oh, my God.
3432000	3433000	No, that's what you should be.
3433000	3436000	We are the fancy, articulate guys.
3437000	3440000	Loki, you're so silly. I love you so much.
3441000	3443000	You know what, Sal? We're going to get hate mail.
3444000	3452000	No, because I really am gay, so I don't hate gay people. I mean, if you really talk like that, that's cool. I don't care. It's just funny.
3453000	3455000	And then you can film it.
3455000	3461000	Okay, speaking of Rock Band, there's some new song.
3462000	3463000	Oh, my God.
3464000	3468000	This is one of the most horrible picture-ups I have ever seen on this computer. Is that Courtney Love?
3469000	3470000	Is that Courtney Love?
3471000	3472000	Yes, it is.
3473000	3474000	That is Courtney Love.
3474000	3484000	Which, by the way, she'll be making an appearance in Rock Band, you should know. Celebrity Skin by Hole will be in Rock Band, as well as the Yaya Yas maps and the Pixies Wave of Mutilation.
3485000	3486000	Dude, cool.
3487000	3489000	I love this song. Garbages, I think I'm paranoid because I love garbage.
3490000	3491000	No, the Pixies. That's cool.
3492000	3493000	That is pretty rad. I like the Pixies, too.
3494000	3501000	Now, there's some unconfirmed songs in the game, and these are forum members that are saying this from the Score Hero and Something Awful forums.
3501000	3511000	So take this with a little bit of a grain of salt, but these would be very cool additions to the game. Red Hot Chili Peppers Danny California is rumored for the game, as well as Soundgarden's Black Hole Sun.
3512000	3513000	That sucks.
3514000	3518000	I mean, come on, who does not remember the video to Black Hole Sun back from the days when MTV was cool?
3519000	3520000	Rob.
3521000	3525000	Which, by the way, thank you to our live listeners tonight for choosing us over to those Skanky Awards shows that are going on on MTV right now.
3526000	3527000	Back in the day?
3527000	3530000	Back in the day, yes. That was my freshman year of college.
3531000	3532000	Back in the day. How old are you?
3533000	3534000	Thirty-one.
3535000	3542000	That's right. She's just a fabulously accessorized girl. That's all she is.
3543000	3544000	Yeah, right.
3545000	3546000	Anyway, that's all I have to say.
3546000	3559000	Well, speaking of things, from back in Rob's day, no, I'm kidding. Rock Band is also saying there will be 18 master recordings from The Grateful Dead as downloadable content. Isn't that cool?
3560000	3562000	Oh, gosh, I hope it has Keep On Truckin' in it.
3563000	3567000	Truckin' is one, Uncle John's Band, Touch of Gray, Sugar Magnolia, and Casey Jones.
3568000	3572000	And my favorite part about the whole thing is they still haven't announced what the price point is going to be.
3573000	3574000	Didn't they?
3574000	3581000	No, they have never announced price points for download content for Rock Band yet, so people are kind of afraid.
3582000	3583000	Wimpy people.
3584000	3585000	What?
3586000	3589000	The ghost guy in our chat room says Jamie is old? She doesn't sound old?
3590000	3594000	Well, you have to consider this guy's probably 15 or 16 or 18.
3595000	3596000	Bite my butt.
3597000	3599000	But you're young at heart. That's all that matters.
3599000	3606000	Seriously, the older I get, I realize 30 is not as old as you think. I remember when I was 18.
3607000	3614000	I used to think that 30 was old because my mom had me really young, so my mom was 30 when I was in high school.
3615000	3618000	Yeah, my mom was 30 when I was in high school, and I thought 30 was old.
3619000	3624000	And then I saw my friend's parents. I was like, is that your grandfather?
3625000	3627000	When I was in high school, my parents were like 60.
3627000	3629000	I always thought that was so bizarre.
3630000	3632000	My mom had me when she was 38.
3633000	3635000	My mom had me at 17.
3636000	3640000	Wow. Ghost guy responded, I'm not going to bite anyone's butt.
3643000	3645000	I love our chat. That was ghost guy.
3651000	3653000	Jamie is trying to figure out the whole bathroom situation.
3653000	3657000	Sorry, guys. We're listening to Jamie try to get in the bathroom. She's yelling at it.
3658000	3662000	She went out there and she's like, oh, somebody's in there, and I'm thinking nobody's in there, but I wasn't going to tell her.
3667000	3678000	Anyways, so, surprise! Guitar Hero 3 on the Wii is not going to have download content initially, but at least it will have online play.
3678000	3685000	I don't know. They haven't really figured out how to implement download content yet, I guess, on the Wii.
3686000	3690000	I know. I was going to say, how would they have download content on the Wii? The Wii is not exactly set up very friendly.
3691000	3692000	I guess there's the Wii Shop channel.
3693000	3701000	And also, where would they store it? There's no storage on the Wii, so they're going to be very challenged to try and figure out how to even do that.
3702000	3704000	They just didn't really think when they designed the Wii, did they?
3704000	3707000	They're just like, oh, if no one knows the story, who's going to store it?
3708000	3713000	No, it's not that, because remember, they were trying to release the Wii for cheap. Remember, they wanted to do it at, what, $99 at first?
3714000	3718000	They wanted to make it a very, very cheap system, so they purposely left all that crap out.
3719000	3729000	But honestly, though, how much are flash drives? They're not that expensive. I mean, you can easily put a two or four gig drive in there and it wouldn't cost you anything.
3729000	3738000	I mean, it's stupid. It really is. Or just support additional storage or something. Ben said, no.
3739000	3741000	You can add memory cards to it.
3742000	3748000	Yeah, for saving your save games, but not for anything else. That's it. It's just for save games and maybe virtual console titles and that shit.
3749000	3753000	Yeah, but they can't design it so that when you download content that it would go into the memory card?
3754000	3756000	That doesn't seem like it would be that hard for them to design it that way.
3756000	3760000	Well, they have to add a patch or something, because right now it doesn't support that.
3761000	3763000	Jamie, why did you walk in here and then tell me to die in a boat fire?
3764000	3765000	Because you should.
3766000	3767000	That's mean! See, you're mean!
3768000	3770000	You were making fun of me while I was going to the...
3771000	3772000	Especially if you die...
3773000	3775000	That's what we do here. We make fun of you when you're not here.
3776000	3777000	If you die in a boat fire, that's pretty pathetic.
3778000	3779000	Just kidding.
3780000	3782000	If you die in a boat fire, that would be really awesome and stupid.
3782000	3785000	I don't want to die in a boat fire. I'm not going to go on a boat now.
3786000	3787000	Is it my turn yet?
3788000	3789000	No, it's not your turn. It's my turn.
3790000	3795000	I'm taking my turn to tell you guys that Video Games Live is having a CD release on October 15th.
3796000	3798000	It's their Greatest Hits Volume 1.
3799000	3801000	Now, it's actually not a live show.
3802000	3805000	They didn't go around to all these venues and actually tape the songs being played live.
3806000	3808000	But they've actually taken some of these artists into the studio.
3808000	3811000	For instance, Martin Lung, who's the piano player who plays all the songs.
3812000	3813000	They got him to record some of these songs.
3814000	3818000	And they're going to have the CD come out from World of Warcraft, Super Mario, Halo.
3819000	3820000	It's going to be pretty awesome.
3821000	3822000	That is, if you're a nerd.
3823000	3828000	And it's a rumor, but I believe that each copy is going to come with a lock of Tommy Tallarico's hair.
3829000	3830000	Can't confirm that.
3831000	3833000	From his head or his pubes?
3834000	3835000	It doesn't say.
3835000	3840000	Maybe the limited edition comes from a different place.
3841000	3842000	That's disgusting.
3843000	3845000	Wow, I think I made myself throw up in my stomach.
3850000	3852000	Rob, how does your body even work?
3853000	3854000	This is what happens when I'm gone for a week.
3855000	3856000	Everything just goes to hell.
3857000	3859000	And Rob throws up in his stomach.
3860000	3862000	Which is totally counterproductive.
3862000	3864000	I meant to say my mouth.
3865000	3868000	Didn't I tell you guys when the show started?
3869000	3870000	That would be like regurgitated feeding.
3871000	3872000	Isn't that eating?
3873000	3874000	Yeah, no Rob, shut up.
3875000	3878000	Have you never heard the expression, you just made me throw up in my mouth a little bit?
3879000	3880000	There you go, that's what I was going for.
3881000	3883000	But for some reason I said stomach.
3884000	3887000	I don't know why, I told you guys at the top of the show, I'm broken tonight.
3888000	3889000	Aw, poor baby.
3889000	3891000	Let's get Rob some duct tape.
3892000	3893000	I haven't even had anything to drink.
3894000	3895000	What's wrong with me?
3896000	3899000	I was going to come last week and bring you my really expensive booze from Grease.
3900000	3901000	And it didn't happen.
3902000	3905000	We definitely need to take a break pretty soon because the show is already broken as it is.
3906000	3908000	But we've got one more thing for you guys before we go to a break.
3909000	3911000	And that is the one and only Website of the Week.
3912000	3917000	As presented by Dark Sakura who surfs the internet up and down and all around every week to find a website she likes to share with all of you.
3917000	3922000	Miss Dark Sakura, where should the kids be pointing their web browsers to this week?
3925000	3926000	Somewhere else.
3927000	3930000	No, the Website of the Week is BBC Radio 1 homepage actually.
3931000	3935000	I a lot of times really hate the crap that's on the radio over here.
3936000	3942000	So I will go, you know, turn on the BBC Radio 1 and listen to it.
3942000	3949000	I also a lot of times will record the, you know, interviews that go off of there and some of the music specials.
3950000	3952000	You can actually get a lot of good information off there too.
3953000	3957000	Just like, you know, if there's other interviews posted, there's your singles charts.
3958000	3961000	You know, you even get in some of the indie stuff that comes through.
3962000	3963000	So I think that's pretty cool.
3964000	3967000	A lot, I think, a different variety of music than what we're used to over here.
3967000	3971000	I mean, a lot of it's the same. You know, you got your mainstays, but I think it's pretty cool.
3972000	3973000	I like that it's all free streaming radio.
3974000	3977000	And the other good thing about it is that there's a schedule up.
3978000	3981000	So if there's something in particular that you want to listen to, a lot of times it will be up there.
3982000	3983000	You can rewind it too and get back.
3984000	3987000	I've actually recorded a number of guerrillas and interviews off of there back in the day.
3988000	3989000	Pretty cool.
3990000	3992000	Tiger Claw would like to back you up. Tiger Claw says BBC Radio 1 is awesome.
3993000	3994000	The essential mix is the best show.
3994000	4000000	I like listening to, I can't think of her name, but she's one of the DJs on there.
4001000	4003000	She really does some good interviews.
4004000	4006000	Anyway, very good stuff.
4007000	4008000	Do they still play the Spice Girls on BBC Radio 1?
4009000	4011000	I don't know. Usually I just block that out.
4012000	4013000	I miss the Spice Girls.
4014000	4015000	The sheist girls.
4016000	4018000	Eddie, you want to go see the reunion tour with me in San Jose?
4019000	4020000	I so want to go, like, so bad.
4021000	4022000	Me too!
4022000	4025000	Remember, why am I out here?
4026000	4031000	The very short version is that Irene and I, it was like 3 in the morning, were playing Spice World.
4032000	4033000	I don't know if you guys remember that game from PS1.
4034000	4035000	That game was awful!
4036000	4037000	Awful, awful, awful, awesome.
4038000	4041000	We were laughing so hard and it was like 3 in the morning, so of course Rob comes out wagging his finger.
4042000	4043000	Why am I out here?
4044000	4046000	Because we were being bad and Rob was going to spank us, I don't know.
4046000	4053000	Well, never mind. There's another part to this story, but I can't say it, even though the show's already got an explicit tag.
4054000	4059000	Let's just say, let's just say they were interrupting something from all their laughing.
4060000	4062000	I was very upset.
4063000	4071000	I think we need to take a break on the show now, because I don't actually know how much video game content was in tonight's program.
4071000	4077000	So we will go, and the people responsible for screwing up tonight's program will be sacked.
4078000	4082000	And those responsible for the sacking would like it to be known that they too have just been sacked.
4083000	4088000	Alright, so everybody will be sacked during our break, and we're going to come back with a stupendous Part B.
4089000	4090000	It'll be fancy and nice.
4091000	4092000	Doing it in a completely different manner and at great expense.
4093000	4097000	Because, honestly guys, there's only one way we could probably fuck up this show even more.
4098000	4099000	That's by letting Rob keep talking.
4099000	4103000	Well, that would be one. But the other would be is that tonight, and by the way, fuck you.
4104000	4106000	In tonight's Part B...
4107000	4108000	Do not want.
4110000	4113000	No, but you do want this. Part B tonight will have the match game.
4114000	4118000	That's right. Nerd match game in Part B tonight. Can't wait for that.
4119000	4120000	So Eddie will be here.
4121000	4122000	That's too much metal for one man.
4123000	4124000	Shane will be here, and one more guest. We haven't even...
4125000	4126000	Did you point at me when you said Shane would be here?
4126000	4129000	No! No, that means I have to sound really apathetic.
4130000	4131000	May we go to break time now?
