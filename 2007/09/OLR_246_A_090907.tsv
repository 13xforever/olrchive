14007	19331	Tonight, September 9th, 2007, Laird's Hot Coffee Mode is found, but it's not what you think.
19851	25596	HD DVD gets a price cut in Europe, and a third-party company has something to say about PlayStation's marketing.
32267	36309	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36349	45252	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer lifestyle and gamer culture.
45712	47793	That'll teach me to say so damn much during the introduction.
48133	52175	That voice you hear taunting behind me is the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
52475	52775	Hi.
53255	56957	And my name is Rob Roberts and joining me as well, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
57157	57677	Hello.
57997	58918	How are you doing, Jamie?
58938	59578	How are you doing tonight?
60492	61252	I have a soda.
61513	62273	You has a soda?
62293	63434	I has a soda.
63534	64134	Is it delicious?
64815	65255	Not really.
65575	65935	Not really?
66195	67296	You're very quiet tonight.
67316	68557	You seem kind of timid.
69057	69697	Is everything okay?
70818	71899	I just ate.
72279	72739	You just ate?
72759	74080	So you're very well satiated?
74100	79123	I was getting into uber bitch mode because I didn't eat and then I ate and I ate too much.
79870	87754	Now I should say something before we get to the rest of the show is that we are taking new pictures tonight, which I'm hoping you guys will see the results of in our album.
88334	89155	I can't talk tonight.
89195	89915	What the hell's wrong with me?
90195	95198	In our album artwork that you'll be seeing for episode 250, at least a little later on.
96879	98079	And Jamie got to eat.
99300	100260	Weren't you eating a Pikachu?
100520	100901	Or was that?
101121	103062	No, you were squishing a Pikachu, pretending to eat a Pikachu.
103142	104603	I ate my cell phone.
104983	105843	You ate your cell phone.
105963	106583	Was it delicious?
106944	107384	Not really.
107444	108665	It tasted like Samsung.
109065	109505	All right.
110140	110480	Wonderful.
111021	111261	All right.
111822	114304	Anyhow, also joining us tonight, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
115224	116566	I've already said hello, but yes.
116726	117066	Oh, yes.
117266	117486	Hi.
117927	118487	Well, hi again.
118567	118928	How are you?
119328	119868	I'm doing fine.
120249	120529	Awesome.
120989	121189	All right.
121270	126114	And also say hello to our chat room, which is available at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
126674	131218	And you can also say hello to Gay Eddie, who's here tonight joining us on the show.
131959	133120	Yeah, that'd be Casper the Gay.
133140	133700	Thank you very much.
133800	135542	You just always call me Gay Eddie because you're a douche.
136698	138259	I don't know what else to call you, I'm sorry.
138339	146904	But we're going to start off with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week, and we'll come back to you and fill in a little more for the folks that may not know you, because you haven't been on the show in a long time.
147825	149306	Has it really been six months?
149326	151647	You could have had a baby since the last time.
151867	154349	See, maybe you had a baby, and we'll find that out.
154689	156030	All right, we'll start with Dark Sakura.
156070	156910	How was your gaming week?
156950	157711	Let's talk about video games.
158271	159232	Lots of pinball.
159472	161553	We sold the whodunit, finally.
162253	163094	Oh, I liked whodunit.
163840	166423	Yeah, but we can get a much better one than the one that we had.
166903	168264	We're babysitting some machines.
168284	175672	We're babysitting a Back to the Future, which Back to the Future sucks because Michael J. Fox wouldn't let his likeness be used in the game.
176512	178434	So it has somebody who completely doesn't look like him.
178995	179275	What a bastard.
179295	180116	And that is the sound files.
181137	183940	Or it's either him or his agent or something.
184560	188344	And then we got a Time Machine, which is one of my favorite older pens.
189130	189970	Project Gotham Racing 3 Land 5 360s
218624	220924	But one of them does not want to land.
221405	222065	I don't know why.
222365	225545	It will land other games, but it just doesn't like Project Gotham Racing 3.
226866	227166	I don't know.
228166	229506	So we played four players with that.
229886	233227	Luckily that day there was someone missing, so it worked out.
233967	236528	Then Saints Row multiplayer, also via System Link.
236688	240248	I swear, you know, there's just not enough support for System Link.
240588	241049	It's sad.
241769	245910	But hopefully we'll get live soon at work and then be able to play anything.
247130	248130	Let's see, other things I played...
249125	275761	Bioshock, more of that I'm actually a little bit more into it now I forget where the hell I'm at but it's still been very good so definitely looking forward to playing more of that game and then let's see I tried a little bit more stuff on 360 I actually downloaded the full version of Worms and well it's Worms so can't really say too much on that and let's see what else did I try out um
277603	287910	Also on the PSP, I found a... Someone had dumped a version of Sega Rally on there that's not out yet, but it's actually very awesome.
288350	291532	Sega Rally Revo, I know it's going to be on most other systems.
292113	297096	I think they're just dropping the Revo part for the PSP version, though, but it's cool.
297296	300438	It's very awesome if you've played Sega Rally in the arcades exactly like that.
300936	302198	I mean, it looks good, too.
302318	303901	So, really recommend that one.
304962	305743	And... Oh!
306064	306765	I almost forgot!
307125	309489	On 360, play FlatOut Ultimate Carnage.
310230	311252	Fucking love this game.
311312	314256	This game right now, I think, best racing game of the year.
314977	315458	Hands down.
316130	317231	That's a pretty hefty title.
317411	319132	It is, and it's fucking fun.
320113	323656	Flat out, I used to love the game, first off, because you can crash into things.
324116	332262	Now, the first game really pissed me off, because when you'd crash into objects on the track, you would kind of get stuck on them, and that kind of sucked.
332682	342770	But, they went back, fixed all that shit, now there's like 6,000 things on the track to crash into, and you see all of them all strewn about on the track.
343257	345759	Ultimate Carnage, Destruction Derby, Ragdoll Olympics
372145	374987	Definitely check out FlatOut Ultimate Carnage.
390603	393864	It's basically, but FlatOut is a completely different game.
394284	398825	Their thing is the fact that you can crash into a bunch of different objects on the course.
399466	400646	Burnout doesn't really have that.
400666	404007	It's mainly just crashing into the cars and exploding and stuff like that.
405147	408388	So it's a different type of game, but I really recommend checking it out.
409288	409909	It's pretty awesome.
409929	413690	I played the demo for a good half an hour at least, and probably will play it a little bit more until it comes out.
415512	415993	Worms 2 Open Warfare
440571	444372	Only on this show would saying you're a whore for worms actually make sense.
444512	447153	Could you imagine if I walked up to just a random person on a street?
447173	448673	You're a whore for worms!
448693	450514	You're a worm whore!
450974	452394	Unless they liked worms.
452814	453895	Or were fishermen.
454015	456015	Do you think there are such things like worm fetish?
456055	456775	That's really gross.
457135	457776	Probably.
457916	459116	There's sick people in the world.
459136	460256	There's fetishes for everything.
460716	461577	That's what they say.
461657	462257	Seriously?
462277	464237	Do we have anybody in the chatroom with worm fetish?
464957	467058	Everybody in the chatroom is talking about their gaming weeks.
467078	467278	I don't...
467799	468700	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
484230	485170	Eh, that's pretty old.
485551	486711	Hey, 1942 and Lode Runner.
486891	490853	But, and Kaboom, on this Activision's hit remix, which sucks.
490873	491693	Kaboom is awesome.
491733	493974	We were talking about Kunio games earlier.
494094	497576	No, I just didn't like the Activision hits remixed on the PSP.
497956	498276	It's just...
499073	499453	I don't know.
499634	502296	Wait, but isn't that the only system they put it out on is the remixed ones?
502416	503637	Like all the souped up titles?
503977	505238	Well, they weren't really souped up.
505338	506699	These were just the standard games.
507420	508300	Oh.
508821	514225	It's not the Atari Classics one that's going to be redone with the ones that they had on Xbox Live Arcade.
514545	515566	This is just the old one.
515626	521630	It was a collection of 70-some Activision titles like Kaboom, Pitfall, Pitfall 2, etc.
522491	523212	Which is okay.
523512	526674	If you really want a collection of those old games, then great.
526774	527295	Pick that up.
527335	528836	I'm sure it's dirt cheap by now.
530741	531021	I don't know.
531161	531941	It's just not for me.
532101	534942	I'm not... I don't want to play it on that console.
535523	538204	SSJ100Mad is applauding you, Loki, in our chatroom.
538264	539484	Loki is really branching out.
539564	541125	I thought he was just an achievement point whore.
542119	542980	Hey, I still am.
543140	547243	I was playing Worms and I was getting achievements on that.
547403	547983	What was I playing?
548003	548784	There was something else I was playing.
549004	550585	Oh, I played Mutant Storm Reloaded.
551746	555089	I played that and I was getting some more achievements on that as well.
555529	556070	Oh, actually, no.
556090	557310	I was looking through my arcade games.
557350	562354	I'm like, I own like 40 arcade games and I don't have the high scores on any of them among my friends.
562394	564676	I'm like, which one can I possibly get the high score on?
565677	570000	And I tried on Mutant Storm Reloaded and I just didn't have enough time to dedicate to it.
570888	572849	How many games am I whooping your ass on?
573269	573529	I don't know.
573549	576229	I don't play live arcade games that much, so probably a lot.
576249	576850	Just curious.
577650	577910	All right.
578690	579130	All finished?
579530	580070	I'm all finished.
580510	580791	All right.
581511	584011	Oh, Call of Duty 4 multiplayer, the beta.
584271	584391	Oh.
584652	585272	It's pretty awesome.
585292	586152	Are you in it legally?
586652	587612	I am in it legally.
587832	588733	Oh, congratulations.
589433	593394	I know there's a way people were getting on there illegally, but no, they actually put me in the first wave.
593434	594274	Are you allowed to talk about it?
595092	595653	Fuck if I know.
596333	597054	Okay, let me put it this way.
597254	597995	It's Call of Duty.
598035	600757	I mean, shit, they haven't really changed much since, you know, 2.
602399	604420	And it's no modern day stuff.
604580	605301	It looks awesome.
605701	606082	That's it.
606202	612728	I mean, if you want me to describe it for you, go play Call of Duty 3, but just imagine it's futuristic or modern day.
612828	614489	I mean, it's basically the same damn thing.
615130	615590	It's good.
616291	617772	Yeah, people are, like, loving this game.
617832	618373	It is good.
618633	618753	It's...
619673	620454	CasperTheGay
640100	641181	I've got Newtopia and Newtopia 2.
668024	668905	Oh, do you have Nootopia 2?
669065	670566	I have TurboGrafx.
670806	671407	Oh, okay, okay.
671707	674269	You know, the thing about it is, it's a Zelda clone.
674289	677031	If you like Zelda games, you'll like it for that old-school gameplay.
677371	679853	But there's some reasons why Zelda was way more popular.
679973	687338	I mean, like, for instance, if you bomb a cave or you bomb a wall in a dungeon, you have to re-bomb it the next time you go back in, which is a real pain in the ass.
687478	688859	That's what they get for being HuCard games.
688959	689899	Yeah, it's horrible.
689959	693660	And then if you go into the cave or something, you automatically have to start talking to the person.
693680	694960	You have no choice.
695241	699301	Or if somebody's in a dungeon in a room, every time you pass through that room, you start talking to them again.
699362	700142	I'm like, ugh.
700562	701222	But it's still fun.
701322	701822	It's good stuff.
702542	703763	Again, Hugh Card game.
705123	705883	So it's good times, though.
705903	706723	So that's pretty much it.
706783	711825	I haven't played any new stuff, so I want to play Metroid, the new one, so that looks pretty awesome.
713565	716446	Kick them off the TV watching Battlestar reruns and go play Metroid.
716466	716906	It's awesome.
717726	717966	All right.
718783	719023	All right.
719404	724313	Well, I got to talk about my gaming week and... Oh, hell.
724453	726677	I don't know if I really want to say anything about my gaming week.
727018	728180	I better brace myself.
730384	731225	This week, I...
733783	737566	Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI
762076	763077	There's a camera on me.
764739	770005	Because I wanted to play something and I had codes that would make it so I could play for a month for free.
770045	770986	So I was like, I'm going to do that.
771487	775291	And then you got a free month on WoW and you're like, okay, I'll come play Final Fantasy XI.
775932	777774	And then we got two of our friends to play too.
778775	780517	So we're all just going back.
780617	781518	We're migrating back.
783140	788583	The thing about it is that they've changed a lot since I've been gone, and I was kind of curious what all has changed.
788623	794586	And it does seem like they have fixed a lot of things that were pissing me off before, such as they got rid of a lot of the gold sellers.
794606	796868	The economy seems to be a lot better than it was before.
796888	798368	It seems like it's stabilized.
798388	799709	The economy changes.
799749	801110	Yeah, seriously, the economy changes.
801130	802531	It happens in a lot of MMOs.
802851	808574	But here's the most hilarious part, and old-school OLR listeners will really get a kick out of this.
808854	810195	You know what server we're playing on?
811296	811696	Faerie.
812642	813723	The Fairy Server!
813743	816005	We're playing on the Fairy Server!
816425	817826	And we're pretending we're noobs.
818006	821869	You have to go back to like episode 80 to get these jokes when I was first getting into Final Fantasy XI.
821909	823931	But yes, we're playing on the Fairy Server.
823951	825732	I don't remember why we were pissed off at that chick.
825752	827013	What was it?
827334	827694	I don't remember.
827714	829936	It was something to do with live journal drama or something.
830656	831297	You have to go back.
831517	832758	It's really fun though in...
833510	835632	I'm actually having a really good time.
835652	838014	So am I. I keep leveling everything I can.
838094	843598	But I'm wondering if it's one of those things where when I have to start partying in the dunes, if it's going to wear off real quick.
843618	844619	We don't know what the dunes are.
844679	846260	Give me my drink, Eddie.
847401	848161	This is great radio.
848221	848422	What?
848642	849823	He's trying to steal my drink.
850583	851904	We don't know what the dunes are yet.
852164	854326	Remember, we're just low levels.
855027	855447	We'll be there.
855487	858109	We've never played before.
858149	860131	I'm looking in the chat room to see what people are saying.
860731	863173	Ghost Guy says Final Fantasy XI equals not so good.
864567	867390	Oh, that person's name that you just read equals not so good.
868031	871834	SSJ100Matt says, why isn't Jamie on top of Rob about this?
872315	873636	Well, Shane took her mic for one.
873656	874917	Well, I needed to talk to him to some point.
874957	876999	I would be curious what Jamie's thoughts are on all of this.
877019	877640	I'm going to go watch what else.
877660	879281	Sorry, bye.
879301	879922	I don't care.
880703	883225	Oh, I thought you were going to call me an addict or yell at me or something.
883485	883806	No.
884686	884907	All right.
884927	886108	What you play is up to you.
886542	887143	Oh, I like this.
887163	889945	This is the kinder, gentler Jamie than we had a few episodes ago.
889965	892228	No, this is the indifferent, apathetic Jamie.
892328	892848	Oh, I see.
892908	894069	This is the meh Jamie.
894430	894770	Yeah.
894890	895191	All right.
896392	896832	The meh.
897473	898594	What do you think about that, Jamie?
898834	899034	Meh.
900450	905214	I didn't just play Final Fantasy XI, though, because I swear I'm going to limit my time on it this time around.
905354	907095	I'll let you guys know how long I actually stick with it.
907396	910418	But I also was playing some more Blue Dragon and made some more progress on that.
910438	911799	And I'm enjoying Blue Dragon.
912039	917824	I realize the critics didn't exactly give it the best scores in the world, but I'm having a good time with it.
918745	920266	And then some stuff on Xbox Live Arcade.
920306	921527	Hello, Fatal Fury Special.
921867	922748	I had to give that a go.
923288	926351	And it's the same game, basically, from the Neo Geo.
926371	928753	They didn't really change anything, but that's okay, because Fatal Fury...
929193	929793	Street Fighter is $10?
929854	931294	Wow, I thought that virtual console games were expensive.
931314	931875	Not even Super Mario Bros.
955411	956212	or $5 for Metroid.
956252	957472	I think that stuff's expensive.
957492	959773	You should see the PlayStation Network game prices.
961114	965476	I mean, granted, they're more full games, but we're talking like $40, $20.
970138	981903	I want to say one other thing I've noticed about Final Fantasy XI is that it seems like there's a lot less OMG, WTF-type kids on there now, and I'm noticing there's a lot of older people that are getting into Final Fantasy XI.
982403	984024	A lot of stay-at-home moms...
984835	985615	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1014099	1015480	Run faster!
1015520	1016741	I don't know where my discs are either.
1016841	1018962	Jamie's thinking about coming back to Final Fantasy.
1022265	1023465	That's okay, I only got to level 15.
1025814	1026654	She's thinking about it.
1027035	1028055	Oh, this is exciting news.
1028075	1029796	I'm probably actually going to quit World of Warcraft 2.
1030616	1031637	I'm just going to quit MMOs.
1031677	1032797	I haven't quit World of Warcraft.
1032837	1033377	I should say that.
1033437	1038179	It's just that I have a free month because I got somebody else to play through the rewards program.
1038459	1041941	So this is my month where I'm going to decide which one I'm going to stick with, if any.
1042241	1044982	Because honestly, when I play MMOs... You should totally play World of Warcraft.
1045102	1045482	Bye!
1045743	1047783	It cuts into my console times.
1048544	1049004	So we'll see.
1049244	1050685	I'm going to try to play through Super Metroid.
1051085	1052826	Oh, Super Metroid.
1053066	1053486	Good stuff.
1054384	1062747	I've been looking for a video capture card for the Mac so we can do Operator 11 stuff with the Super Metroid.
1062767	1065268	We can do our live playthrough and have the video feed actually on it.
1065288	1066548	You actually have to do it this week.
1067148	1067448	I know.
1067528	1068189	We totally will.
1068209	1069009	I just need to get the card.
1069429	1072691	I haven't been doing my show on Tuesday so we should do that instead of my show.
1098582	1101864	So keep an eye out on our page on Operator11.com.
1101924	1105646	I'm not sure exactly how to get to our profile, but I can tell you our username is Orange Laundry.
1105666	1106827	That was a really bad plug, huh?
1107187	1108608	I don't really know how you get there.
1108628	1110129	Best plug ever.
1110149	1110989	But just find it.
1111490	1112250	All right, so there you go.
1114411	1115232	And let's see.
1115272	1117073	I don't really have a whole lot of other housekeeping.
1117093	1119014	I already talked about that we have new pictures coming.
1119074	1120015	I ate too much pizza.
1120335	1121115	I'm sorry to hear that.
1121576	1122356	I'm actually hungry.
1122516	1123797	Eddie, you want to make another run to talk about?
1124097	1125258	Do you want my breadsticks?
1126070	1127070	Seriously, can I have some breadsticks?
1127110	1127331	Sure.
1127451	1128511	I would heart you forever.
1129071	1129351	Hooray.
1129491	1132733	I'm going to eat breadsticks, and we're going to get into tonight's gaming news.
1132773	1133733	Hopefully, I'm not first.
1134573	1135994	Hey, Rob's first.
1136454	1136734	Anyways.
1136754	1138215	No, I'm kidding.
1138935	1139175	No.
1139715	1145898	So, to start things off, let's talk about pathetic stuff, including how pathetic Lair was.
1146718	1153261	Well, you know, personally, I haven't played it, so I don't know if it's pathetic, but based on people's reviews of it, you know, for example, IGN gave it a 4.9.
1155379	1160182	I would say it's pretty pathetic, and I guess, you know, there are some control issues and stuff like that.
1160682	1170688	Well, to, I guess, help save face, Sony has figured, you know what, the reason why our game is getting bad scores is because reviewers just don't know how to review our game.
1172189	1173470	Yeah, it's never a good argument.
1173610	1175491	So, what they did was they sent out...
1176403	1178384	Reviewers Guides for Lair.
1178884	1185526	They basically sent IGN a guide of how to review their game because they figure, oh, you're stupid and you don't know how to play our game.
1187147	1189408	Yeah, that really makes you look cool.
1190868	1201052	So, apparently six of the 21 pages of the guide are devoted to the game's controls and I guess it has, you know, like a fact or something in it.
1202952	1204533	That's so retarded.
1206227	1208510	Ghost Guy in our chatroom says Lair is lame.
1212074	1212374	I don't know.
1212975	1214857	I will withhold judgment until I have a chance to play it.
1214977	1215838	It looked good, though.
1215878	1222185	It looked like the game that could save the PlayStation 3 from all this, you know, that people are saying at it.
1222686	1224107	So what went wrong, Loki?
1225269	1225369	Um...
1226132	1227393	It just kind of sucked.
1228054	1228414	I don't know.
1228774	1232517	I think one of the things was, first off, you had to use the motion controls.
1232958	1235860	It wasn't just you can turn them off or it's optional.
1235920	1236941	You had to use them.
1237601	1238762	They were kind of floaty.
1240964	1243306	There was, I guess, some lag between certain things.
1244467	1244787	I don't know.
1244827	1246869	It's just a lot harder than people thought.
1249511	1255736	Mr. DeBucket in our chat room at chat.orangesoundsradio.com says, Lair is better on PSP via remote play.
1258487	1260388	You know... Gimmick.
1260768	1261568	That's all I'm saying.
1262028	1267810	Well, you know, it's interesting that that gets brought up because it makes me think about the whole, like, DS Wii thing.
1267830	1269510	Shouldn't we have seen something with that by now?
1269790	1271090	Oh, I guess we have the Pokemon game, huh?
1271110	1274251	I guess we do have a little bit of connectivity, but nothing to this extent.
1274451	1275992	That's cool, but here's the thing, though.
1276112	1286134	I mean, I don't want to get into other stories or anything, but I'm just saying, you know, the remote play isn't like... It's not like the DS thing with the Wii, where
1286690	1292473	You know, that's actually being used as a controller, and it actually has an earface on there and menus and stuff.
1292593	1294414	It's different than what's on the screen.
1294494	1297395	It's actually, you know, kind of an accessory to the game.
1297756	1303739	Whereas remote play is, look, I can play this from, you know, Starbucks down the street.
1303799	1306120	I'm playing my PlayStation 3 on my PSP.
1306640	1309021	I mean, it doesn't work completely.
1309922	1311122	Even that's kind of broken.
1311142	1314424	I mean, sure, you can do it, but, you know, it's just like...
1315302	1315963	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1337600	1338960	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1362466	1365988	So is this possibly just the beginning of more to come for the console?
1366308	1373330	Remember when they were shown off the console and they had the Formula 1 racing game and they were like, look, you can use your PSP as a rearview mirror.
1375311	1375731	Why?
1376451	1377852	Why would you do that?
1378892	1383274	You're just going to set it on a stand next to you or something.
1383514	1387736	They have rearview mirrors on your car model in the game.
1388076	1390177	Why would you need to have it on a separate screen?
1390297	1391157	It's just a gimmick.
1391624	1392505	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1413410	1427558	There was some other... When they were doing it at the GameCube, too, there was some cooler, like, connectivity with the Game Boy Advance because, like, when you were playing, I think it was one of the Metal Gear games, something like that, it was, like, your sonar, and it was, like, having your own cool, like, device, but in the game.
1427618	1428058	Exactly.
1428098	1433601	So it was a gimmick, but it was, like, practical, too, so... Oh, I... No, here's the thing.
1433762	1436183	The reason why they did that is so that you can make...
1436821	1438583	The Racing Game More Like Real Life.
1439183	1443367	And by the way, Mr. DeBucket in chat wants to point out, it was a tech demo, you dumbass.
1443447	1444668	It wasn't even in the game.
1444848	1445829	I know, that's what I'm saying.
1445909	1446790	It was the tech demo.
1446810	1448831	It was when they were first showing the PlayStation 3 on.
1448892	1453796	It makes it more like real life because what you do is you get a woman to sit next to you while you drive.
1454036	1455517	Where's something I can throw at Rob right now?
1455557	1456378	I'm not even finished.
1456738	1462003	And you have the PSP and the woman's watching and she's nagging about everything you're doing wrong.
1462083	1463264	Where's something I can throw at Rob?
1463863	1464884	Give me one of your Pikachus.
1464924	1466206	Throw one of these breadsticks.
1466586	1467708	These things will knock me out.
1467748	1468629	They're like rock solid.
1468649	1469950	I know, they're nasty.
1469970	1474335	I think the Operator 11 people heard me banging it against the wall earlier.
1474375	1475156	These things are tough.
1475697	1477439	All right, anyway, that's all I have to say.
1477639	1479141	That's okay, because Rob drives like Grand Moff.
1479862	1480162	Whatever.
1480182	1481223	See?
1481464	1482705	You're criticizing my driving!
1499538	1504699	Then why even put some half-assed control system in there that you can play this thing remotely?
1504779	1505719	It's stupid.
1506179	1511320	It's just like those people that use their media center extender to view the internet on their 360.
1512220	1513141	It's stupid.
1513341	1514181	It's gimmicky.
1514221	1515501	You don't need to do that.
1516361	1519702	Well, if you'd like to comment on Loki's rants, we always welcome your emails.
1519802	1525443	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com No, that's Loki at... Send them directly to Loki.
1525483	1526243	Send them to him.
1527293	1527894	I don't need them.
1528374	1533118	And while you're at it, sign him up for lots of Nigerian bank lotteries.
1533198	1534419	I already get enough spam.
1537882	1541404	And Loki's definitely interested in anything you have on Viagra or Cialis.
1541845	1545308	I will forward all my email to you, Rob.
1546328	1547750	He also wants bigger breasts.
1550552	1551613	Alright, I'm done.
1551633	1553114	That's all I wanted to say about the connectivity.
1553587	1565337	Well, you know our favorite crayon eater was going around in his days at Sony saying that the PS3 was a computer and a multimedia whatever.
1566238	1568480	Kaz Hirai, who is now the man again.
1569651	1575836	said, and I'm going to quote, I'd like to clearly say the PS3 is a game machine.
1576416	1577537	It's nothing more than that.
1577637	1578317	No, it is not.
1578438	1582320	In fact, all their commercials say computer entertainment system.
1582380	1583541	It's a fucking computer.
1584542	1585283	No, it is not.
1585383	1586664	It's the Sony PlayStation.
1586884	1587084	I mean...
1588550	1589611	It is a fucking computer.
1589651	1590652	You've been saying computer.
1590732	1597117	Just because your fucking computer does not sell does not mean that you have to start calling it a game machine now.
1597757	1598698	It's a fucking computer.
1598778	1599418	Stick with it.
1599558	1601000	Who turned Loki to 11 tonight?
1601100	1602220	That's what I want to know.
1603762	1605343	Why don't you just make 10 louder?
1606055	1606876	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1627410	1627970	and many more.
1650215	1656440	What makes the PlayStation 3 a little bit appealing as well?
1656480	1660003	What's the one thing that has people more excited than anything about PlayStation 3?
1660703	1661023	Home.
1661584	1662604	Is home a game?
1663305	1665406	No, it's kind of something outside the box.
1665827	1670070	So for them to go out and say a quote like this is a little bit like, huh?
1671098	1673640	But you're like the worst at being a game machine.
1673660	1675101	You do everything else really good.
1675241	1675601	I don't know.
1675781	1676141	Guess what?
1676221	1678323	People didn't care that you can load Linux on it.
1678363	1682085	That's why it's now a game system and not a fucking computer.
1683045	1685027	Well, okay, fine then.
1685327	1686928	$600 is too much for a game system.
1688789	1691891	You know, $600 was cheap for a computer, too much for a game system.
1692071	1693552	So now it's too much for a game system.
1695413	1695913	All right, let's see.
1696213	1700955	SonOfDad says, PlayStation 3 right now is a cheap Blu-ray player, no more, no less.
1701696	1704097	There might be some Sony fans that disagree, but I don't know.
1704137	1708539	I mean, I still have yet to buy a PlayStation 3 because, I have to admit, I feel kind of similar.
1708639	1710639	There's nothing out there to play.
1711040	1711680	Even, I mean...
1713135	1714396	Ratchet and Clank Future.
1714616	1715577	That looks pretty good.
1715797	1716959	And Resistance was good.
1717239	1721042	I'm sure when Final Fantasy XIII comes out, I'll be like, Hail Sony!
1721142	1722163	Welcome into my house!
1722223	1723084	Hail PlayStation 3!
1723364	1723865	I love you!
1724005	1727528	Well, then you'll have a lot of time to save up money when it comes out Spring 2009.
1729339	1730679	Is that the current release?
1730860	1740502	No, I'm just guessing, because, you know, this shit... I mean, because it'll come out in Japan, you know, probably Christmas next year or something, and then we'll see it maybe spring or summer of 2009.
1741443	1742083	But don't worry!
1742283	1742723	Don't worry!
1742823	1745624	Good games are coming to the PlayStation 3 someday.
1746624	1747044	All right.
1748505	1749765	Thank you, Jamie, for the quote.
1749805	1752666	It certainly livened up our show a little bit tonight.
1753086	1753426	Meh.
1755386	1756147	Except for you.
1756627	1757047	Anyways...
1760709	1763230	Anyway, so guess what?
1763570	1766950	You can't talk about PSP Homebrew on the official Sony forums.
1769891	1772612	Wow, surprise.
1772632	1776252	You can't talk about cracking their system on their own forums.
1777613	1778833	How dare they do that?
1779133	1783574	I'm more concerned with the fact that it took them this long to ban that chat.
1784054	1784274	What?
1785438	1789221	Well, you know, the PSP is only a game system.
1789481	1790562	You shouldn't be doing other things on there.
1790602	1791783	Shut up and read the story.
1792603	1802231	So, yeah, if you talk about homebrew, you will be banned from Sony's official chatroom or forum.
1802931	1803492	And guess what?
1804132	1805713	We ban you!
1806154	1814420	Since we're on the topic of homebrew, it should not be a surprise that with the PlayStation Slim coming out,
1815368	1816329	The PlayStation Portable Slim
1837955	1843880	Now, I know I can say this, and it won't go anywhere, so nobody tell him, but I think I know what I'm going to get William for.
1844200	1844981	And I'm totally serious here.
1845001	1846462	I think I know what I'm going to get William for his birthday.
1846482	1847723	I'm going to get him a PSP Slim.
1848203	1851426	Because funny enough, William is a huge Sony fanboy.
1852167	1853107	And I don't know what it is.
1853368	1860713	He doesn't even play a whole lot of video games, but every time we go into Best Buy, we'll be looking at MotorStorm or whatever, and he's always like, don't you want a PlayStation 3?
1861034	1861374	Look at it.
1861414	1862034	It's so beautiful.
1862075	1863316	Why don't you have a PlayStation 3 in your house?
1863336	1864236	You have another game system.
1864256	1865017	Why don't you get a PlayStation 3?
1865077	1866358	I'm like, are you going to buy me one?
1866798	1867299	He's like, no.
1868459	1895915	but I think he really wants a PSP so I'm going to get him one because he thinks they're cool but I'm going to get him the Slim because they're new and then I can go look it's a new toy too and I think he'll get a kick out of that so Sony fanboys who are pissed off at the show right now because we're knocking Sony I just thought I'd let you know they are still getting some of our money because I do think the PSP is pretty awesome now it was a slow start but then again the DS had a slow start too so what can you say well
1896863	1904067	Anyhow, one thing, of course, that you can play on those PSPs is Lair, which goes back and forth, you know, with a little remote connectivity.
1904387	1906728	But yes, we have one more Lair story for you guys.
1907528	1911671	There's a brand new hot coffee mode that's been discovered inside Lair.
1911711	1915813	Yes, there's a hot coffee mode, except it's not really what you think.
1916673	1920335	If you actually watch the video of the hot coffee mode...
1920891	1929815	It's actually just something you unlock where somebody brews a pot of hot coffee.
1930515	1937879	All you have to do is enter in this big long string at the cheat menu and you'll be welcomed with this video of somebody making hot coffee.
1938839	1940520	That's the best joke ever.
1941741	1944482	It's kind of stupid, but it's stupid funny.
1945262	1947183	Like a Jim Carrey movie, it's stupid funny.
1948184	1949004	That's great.
1949471	1958553	By the way, that code that you can enter in, 686-F7-420-636-F66666565.
1959154	1962734	If you missed any part of this show and need a transcription, get out a pen next time.
1962774	1963215	And guess what?
1963235	1968816	Those also happen to be the reviews that this game got as well.
1970016	1971137	Good job, Loki.
1972597	1976478	Just as I was reminded in the chat room, though, the
1977028	1991037	PSP is, I guess, they've already cracked the firmware and they're going to be releasing a, I guess, Team M33 is going to be releasing a CFW 3.6 firmware for it.
1994139	1996340	That's one of the better jokes we've had in a while on this program.
1996360	1997000	Good job, Loki.
1997781	2000462	Yes, chatroom, now you two get to beat that one into the ground.
2001443	2003444	So, some news for our UK listeners.
2003765	2006046	Sega's got some dates out for some of their stuff.
2006713	2012536	Virtua Fighter 5, Who Gives a Crap on Xbox 360 will be 26th October.
2012696	2016778	Universe at War for PC and Ghost Squad on Wii is 2nd November.
2017078	2021580	Sonic Rush Adventure for the DS will be next week.
2021680	2026143	Crazy Taxi, Fair Wars also will be later this month on PSP.
2027003	2034327	Sonic Rivals 2 will be on November 2nd and The Golden Compass will be on November 30th.
2034847	2035147	There you go.
2036107	2039908	Hitstun asks, do they get Virtua Fighter 5 360 before we do?
2039928	2041529	I'm not sure.
2042989	2043930	Probably about the same week, right?
2043950	2045410	We're getting the last week of October.
2046611	2046931	Interesting.
2048131	2054614	Well, let's go to some release dates and travel the world and see what's coming out right now in all different places, not just from Sega.
2054914	2056114	Oh, yes.
2056274	2057835	In fact, this week's actually pretty good.
2057855	2063717	We're starting to get into some of the better stuff, you know, fourth quarter stuff for all systems.
2064187	2074114	and I know next week, well, I'm not a huge fan of it, but NHL 08 and NHL 2K8 are both coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and 360.
2075355	2082420	Then we have EA's competition for Tony Hawk's Skate that's also going to be coming out next week.
2084121	2084982	Let's see here.
2086183	2086623	What?
2088944	2093888	Anyways, Heavenly Sword will be making its way out next week and
2094206	2096147	Dirt on PlayStation 3 Dirt on PlayStation 3 Dirt on PlayStation 3
2124674	2126376	on PlayStation 2, .hack//G.U.
2126456	2128979	Volume 3, the last game in that trilogy.
2130360	2135106	Guilty Gear XX Accent Core on PlayStation 2, that should make a lot of import fans happy.
2136527	2137789	Let's see then, also...
2139197	2145678	On 360, you will be getting the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Game of the Year Edition.
2145758	2150599	That's going to be including both the expansion, I believe, and some of the download content for that.
2150819	2156600	In other words, this is the release that fucks you all over who bought the game originally at full price and then all the expansions at full price.
2156620	2158441	If you want the PlayStation 3 one, guess what?
2158481	2159201	It's not coming out.
2159261	2159901	It got delayed.
2160481	2166302	Fatal Inertia is also coming out on 360 next week, as well as Kengo, Legend of the Nine.
2167604	2195472	And let's see, then also on the Wii, Big Fat Nothin' On PC, of course, Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, the Game of the Year edition Democracy, apparently we're getting Democracy on September 11th, how appropriate And some crappy Sherlock Holmes game, that's interesting And then, of course, my favorite for the DS, Drawn to Life is coming out next week That looks really awesome
2196027	2196888	So, that'd be cool.
2197048	2199811	And then, of course, if you're a music game fan, Jam Sessions.
2199931	2205097	I'm actually thinking about picking this up just because I need some guitar stuff in the mixes I do.
2205257	2206919	So, Jam Sessions.
2208427	2209467	Thanks for watching!
2229192	2233717	Nintendo Wii, SSX Blur PlayStation 3, Megazone 23, Ali Garland Old School Anime
2246681	2247042	Happiness Deluxe
2260541	2263362	and it's even better, it's made by Marvelous Entertainment.
2263402	2263903	So there you go.
2264243	2265263	It's marvelously happy.
2265644	2268425	And Sega's putting out yet another Pachinko game.
2268925	2269265	No!
2269285	2274988	Tyson Pachinko, he's... Sakura Tyson is coming out.
2275008	2275729	You know what I want to see?
2275809	2278010	Oh, dude, they're doing a Sakura Tyson Pachinko?
2278130	2280871	They should have a Pachinko Xbox Live Arcade game.
2281591	2282112	That'd be funny.
2282392	2283452	That would be actually pretty rad.
2283472	2284553	I think that would be pretty great.
2285160	2286220	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2311923	2312744	I love Dolphin!
2312924	2314165	Coming to the Nintendo DS.
2314565	2315246	Dolphin safe.
2315346	2316968	Do you know they make a vibrator for the Dolphin?
2317028	2320691	I don't know, some Pokemon games and SimCity DS, you know, blah blah blah.
2321111	2322232	Oh, I can't forget the PSP.
2322272	2323994	Let me see if there's anything on the PSP worth mentioning.
2324214	2324654	Crap!
2324814	2325675	Oh, Crisis Core!
2326236	2327997	Shit, I think there's a lot of people really excited about that.
2328037	2331941	Crisis Core also out on September 13th, as well as Fate Tiger Coliseum.
2332661	2332961	Ooh.
2333762	2334122	There you go.
2334983	2336104	Those are your release dates for Japan.
2336384	2337926	Well, how about for our friends in the UK?
2339986	2357320	Blazing Angels Secret Missions of World War 2 CSI Three Dimensions of Murder Dungeons and Dragons Tactics for PSP Fatal Inertia on Xbox 360 Freshly Picked Tingles Rosy Rupeeland Hooray!
2358781	2360943	Freshly Picked Tingles, I love those!
2362264	2363185	That's on the DS.
2363605	2365707	I hope it never comes over here.
2365747	2366607	I'm going to import it.
2367748	2368429	It will be in English.
2368857	2372079	We have Heavenly... English, English.
2373360	2374840	That means there'll be extra vowels.
2376781	2378042	Extra vowels make everything better.
2378843	2391109	Heavenly Sword on PlayStation 3, Heroes of Mana, which we already have over here, MotoGP07, Sonic Rush Adventure on the 14th, Stranglehold, Super Paper Mario on Wii.
2393311	2393651	Yay!
2393671	2393731	Yay!
2394873	2404037	Something you guys were talking about reminded me of one other thing that I really missed in Final Fantasy XI, and that was boss monsters with no vowels in their name.
2404677	2408619	Like, Xrrr, is the name of a dragon.
2408659	2411460	Or no, I think there's a dragon you have to fight called Vrth.
2415735	2417837	Good times!
2418477	2423522	Anyways, as with most games, they've been getting updates and patches every now and then.
2423902	2431489	And one in particular that happened this last week was Bioshock got a title update to fix a few things.
2432150	2433491	Just some minor stuff, I guess.
2434232	2439897	Updates improve stability when loading autosaves, and overall game stability corrects audio during
2440878	2445220	and addresses AI behaviors regarding health stations.
2446601	2448842	So that's kind of interesting.
2448942	2466170	Another interesting thing though is of course people picking apart the PC version found a couple of notations for Plasmid Pack 1 which is believed to be a download that's going to happen later on including some brand new plasmids that you'll be able to buy from the machines and whatnot.
2466691	2469232	So hopefully we'll see some download content a little bit later on
2470480	2472361	But of course, nothing official yet.
2475663	2476064	Excuse me.
2477684	2478345	I'm choking on breath.
2478365	2481166	Yes, I just sounded like a murloc just then.
2482427	2483208	Loki, keep talking.
2483248	2484548	It's rude of me to talk with my mouth full.
2485849	2487150	That's going to be awesome.
2487210	2488951	I'm looking forward to some new plasmids.
2491012	2492033	You like new plasma?
2492993	2493774	New plasmids.
2493974	2495014	Oh, I thought you said plasma.
2495034	2497516	I'm like, there's people who recycle their plasma.
2498129	2499590	No, new plasmids for the game.
2500090	2500810	I love this show.
2501370	2504091	Loki, you know what you should check out if you dig that Drawn to Life?
2504332	2513115	There's a game that nobody knows about for GameCube called Monster Island, where you could basically create your own monsters, draw them out on a screen, and then play them in various competitions.
2513155	2513795	It was very cool.
2513835	2514916	Wasn't that like Magic Penjel?
2514936	2518197	Yeah, they had Magic Penjel, and they had Graffiti Kingdom that were also the same type of thing.
2518217	2519057	Yeah, it was cool, though.
2519097	2520618	It was good times, if you like that kind of thing.
2520758	2527821	Magic Penjel, I had a 2DX system that was fighting, and we also had poppin' music, and
2528430	2531211	Yes, I think people drew a penis monster as well.
2532251	2533551	Penis monster was great.
2533951	2535872	I really have to say the penis monster was good.
2536372	2541193	My character... That's, you know, some people don't like that.
2541213	2542913	The game is easy to exploit, though.
2542953	2550715	My character was just like a teddy bear, and I'd draw this big square that would be attached to it, and it'd be all blue, which would give you more magic attack or something.
2550735	2553176	What was the attack of the penis monster?
2553836	2554916	You'd poke it.
2558351	2561753	Did it have a similar attack as to a squid?
2562153	2564114	Is that what happened when you poked it?
2564234	2565915	It would just sit and hunch over.
2567376	2569657	That's because you weren't doing it right.
2569937	2581024	Whoever drew the penis monster, it thought that the hair that someone drew on the testicles was actually legs.
2581104	2583325	So it would walk around on legs of this giant thing.
2584546	2587047	It was the worst Pokemon type game ever.
2589158	2592241	Now that is something we need for fucking Operator 11.
2593562	2598127	Yeah, too bad the cam just shut off on Op 11 like five minutes ago because we got booted out from time feeds.
2598147	2600249	Because we can only do 40 minute shows on there, but whatever.
2600269	2602772	What was I going to say?
2603272	2608698	Oh yeah, Jason, Webmaster Jason, remind me to mark this episode explicit, please, a little later.
2609598	2610019	Thank you.
2612611	2620475	Seriously though, if you can find Magic Pendulum or even better, Graffiti Kingdom, that game is really fun, especially... For five minutes.
2620835	2622076	Oh, it's not fun for five minutes.
2622836	2629399	You get your friends over and you're like, you can draw your own characters and give them just time and eventually something perverted is going to come out of it.
2629419	2632541	Yeah, we tried to draw a vagina monster so they could fight, but we ran out of ink.
2637323	2639064	I think we got the... Never mind.
2639104	2642226	I was going to get into female anatomy, but probably I shouldn't do that.
2643326	2644406	Let's see, what was I going to say?
2645927	2647929	Mr. DeBucket says Wangzilla for the win.
2648549	2650310	Also, oh, I like this quote from Mr. DeBucket.
2650430	2653472	Isn't every GameCube game a game for GameCube that no one knows about?
2654593	2654793	Aww.
2656414	2656935	Touche.
2657055	2660037	Drew Nami says, I think I still have a save file with the penis monster.
2661298	2664760	Oh, that's right, because that was the day that we had Paper Plate Battle Royale.
2666201	2671945	Son of Dad is thinking that the movie Superbad, the end credits, is suddenly reminding him of our discussion right now.
2672864	2678308	so go figure anyhow moving from Penis Monster back to Bioshock
2681815	2683136	God, what can I say about this?
2683176	2691064	Okay, somebody posted on the 2K forums about that basically his brother and him were trying to play the game Bioshock together.
2691465	2697471	But the game wouldn't let him because, as you may know, Bioshock on the PC only limits you to activate your account so many times.
2697771	2700314	You only get like five activations for the game and then that's it.
2700354	2700874	You're cut off.
2700934	2701275	No more.
2701655	2704077	And it's been a very controversial maneuver.
2704117	2705359	But what happened, okay...
2705979	2714473	This guy named 2KTechJT responded, There's no other way to view this, is one user has purchased the game, not the whole family.
2714853	2716876	So why should your brother play for free?
2717778	2719480	To which everybody goes, um...
2720143	2722124	Hello, hasn't it always been that way?
2722224	2731687	I mean, if you bring a traditional CD, let's say Xbox 360 or PlayStation 2 game home, and, you know, everybody gets to use that game, right?
2732047	2733387	Hello, this is nothing normal.
2733407	2741570	If you buy a CD, everybody in the house... Or how about they, if he wants his brother to play, how about you just log into your brother's account on Windows and fucking play the game?
2741730	2745591	Instead of being a little whiny bitch about, I don't want to install it on mine!
2745771	2748072	There's a certain amount of, you know...
2749893	2752934	I have to say that I don't let anybody else use my computer.
2754254	2757095	Seriously, stop being so fucking lazy and just do what you need to do.
2778672	2780332	Thank you for watching!
2798075	2802359	Please note that the forum moderator has been incorrectly quoted as a 2K employee.
2802739	2808744	The individual JT Tech 2K works for an outside tech support group and is not an employee of 2K.
2809184	2811606	Additionally, 2K is investigating the validity of the post.
2816311	2817532	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2843168	2845189	Loki from Orange Lounge Radio reminding you to think of the children.
2845209	2845590	Alright, I'm done.
2872008	2873308	Think of how tasty they are.
2892580	2911495	So for some news regarding, again, more information in the UK, it says that the sales for the Xbox 360 are up, actually have increased, and the PSP is having their worst week since launch.
2913077	2914698	Poor Sony, baby.
2917168	2945431	but at any rate what they're claiming is responsible for the increase in Xbox 360 sales would be the Elite model and the other price reductions for the Premium and Core systems which are I guess making people really crazy about wanting them however with the upcoming launches for the Slim PSP on September 14th overseas people just still don't care
2946072	2950175	Well, I was going to say, without sounding like an ass, I mean, this isn't like a fanboy or whatever.
2951616	2956400	I think this news is only temporary because the Slims are coming out and because Christmas Hello is right around the corner.
2956420	2957221	I still think people don't care.
2957241	2958301	Sales for everything are going to pick up.
2959282	2959843	Well, we'll see.
2961464	2961924	We will see.
2964026	2965487	Anyways.
2966508	2969410	So, the Xbox HD DVD...
2970356	2971418	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2985572	2987453	Get a little bit of a discount.
2987593	2996138	I'm not sure if it's going on over there as well, but I know over here, once you buy it, you do get a rebate for five free HD DVD movies.
2996238	2996678	Fuckers.
2997039	2998940	Not when I bought my HD DVD player.
2999040	2999920	You know what I got?
3000220	3001061	King Kong.
3001581	3002962	It's still in the wrapping.
3003522	3004383	I just would like to point out.
3005223	3006664	You can also get Blu-ray players, too.
3006684	3007705	They're kind of doing the same thing.
3008665	3013088	They are desperate for people to adopt the next-gen video formats, but...
3014417	3015758	Do you think they're feeling a little heat?
3015799	3022608	Because whether you want to say it's thanks to the PlayStation 3 or whatever, Blu-ray does seem to be pushing a little more of the market share.
3025117	3031739	Yeah, but really, I mean, they're counting them as players, Blu-ray players, but really how many people are actually using them for Blu-ray?
3031779	3033979	That's the thing, is there is no way of showing that.
3033999	3034739	If I had one, I would be.
3035019	3037000	Well, yeah, but there's no way of showing it.
3037020	3045542	I mean, because, yeah, okay, I use mine for Blu-ray movies sometimes, but I can count on one hand how many times I've watched a Blu-ray movie on there.
3045562	3047422	I mean, it's not a lot.
3047482	3049163	I just don't use the system at all.
3050523	3054684	And if I bought an HD DVD player, I don't think I would use it any more than I'm using...
3055303	3057684	I don't know.
3057964	3067468	Personally, I would not buy an add-on for the 360 for any sort of next-gen video format because at least with the PlayStation 3, if Blu-ray doesn't win out, big deal.
3067528	3068708	It's a fucking game machine.
3069888	3071029	Computer, my mistake.
3072349	3079912	And if, you know, say, HDTV doesn't win out, then you're stuck with this fucking external drive for, you know, you can't do anything with.
3080732	3082133	So, I don't know.
3084045	3093093	All right, well, now one period of time when you're going to have to watch these movies on the HD DVD is a four-hour period between 2 a.m.
3093173	3096376	tonight and 9 in the, or I'm sorry, it actually starts at 2 a.m.
3096416	3098057	tonight and runs to 6 a.m.
3098818	3100620	That's because Xbox Live is going to be down.
3101080	3111009	So sorry, kids, you're going to have to hold off on yelling the N-word and the F-A-G-word at each other for four hours while the system is down because that's all people really do on Xbox Live.
3113430	3118093	Which, by the way, I... So they call each other nice and fancy?
3121656	3124358	Yes, they call each other nice and fancy.
3127100	3129241	See, you're not helping your hole.
3129421	3132844	You need to call me Casper instead of Big Gay Eddie.
3135806	3136486	Whatever, Rob.
3136506	3137547	You're just the big silly.
3138988	3141410	Well, guys, you just fragged me.
3141750	3142931	Wasn't that fancy?
3142951	3143051	Yeah.
3145794	3149537	Oh, look at me, I'm on the ground now, all helpless and laid down.
3149557	3153079	It would be awful if someone violated me.
3156261	3160424	Oh, I see you're squatting over and over again above my pelvis.
3160844	3161945	Isn't that nice?
3162045	3163346	Isn't that fancy?
3163366	3166868	What the hell is wrong with you, Eddie?
3167749	3170891	Just because you've been watching what I do on Saturday nights by myself.
3171791	3172712	Don't make fun of me.
3178338	3185378	Wonderdog Harold says in our chatroom Snagglepuss is on Xbox Live
3194779	3196100	Xbox Live is going to be down.
3196140	3196641	Get over it.
3196701	3200144	By the time most of you downloaded the podcast, it's already done anyway.
3200484	3203086	So we've spent far too long on this useless story.
3203647	3205168	Jamie, please save the show.
3205348	3209812	I like how Ranma says, fag, fancy, articulate guys.
3210253	3214036	Okay, who said that?
3214897	3215277	Ranma.
3215377	3216438	Ranma, you're the best.
3216478	3216819	You're awesome.
3216839	3218280	Why are you talking about a cigarette?
3219861	3221643	I am a fancy, articulate guy.
3222350	3228734	So according to Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry... Man, they're old.
3230675	3231436	I mean, I'm sorry.
3231816	3233897	Aerosmith is really awesome, don't get me wrong.
3234818	3240381	But it's like, I see really good pictures of all of them, and then I see really old pictures of all of them.
3240661	3242282	And then I look at Keith Richards and feel better.
3242923	3249807	So anyway, since they're working hand-in-hand with the folks behind Guitar Hero 4...
3250965	3258189	and they are going to be the the game is pretty much going to be Aerosmith Edition Guitar Hero.
3258449	3262431	So they told Aerosmith, yeah, it's all going to be about you.
3262912	3264353	Totally about you.
3264633	3265273	Please be in our game.
3266854	3272717	Well, there will be other stuff, of course, but the hope is that the master tracks are Aerosmith, so that'd be cool.
3274178	3276179	Okay, I have a bad joke for you guys.
3278020	3279661	What did Steven Tyler say about
3279946	3282647	when Activision asked him to be in the next Guitar Hero game.
3284068	3284969	What did he say?
3289811	3291752	Yes, that was... That's fancy talk.
3294593	3296434	That's pretty accurate as being crappy.
3298755	3301937	Anyways... I think something was in the breadsticks at this point.
3303138	3305859	I didn't even eat the breadsticks, Rob, and I'm turning gay.
3306059	3306800	You smelled them.
3309541	3309601	Um...
3310399	3311620	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3333023	3340829	I was confirming with our boss that we need to do a road trip if they happen to be down here pretty soon.
3340909	3344952	So it looks like actually in the next couple weeks, the 23rd or 23rd, they're going to be in Sacramento.
3344992	3346112	So we'll have to go check it out.
3346253	3348935	Jamie, are we going to go to the rock band show and have some fun?
3349155	3350696	No, I'm going to go see They Might Be Giants.
3351829	3353350	It's going to be here for three days.
3353550	3355412	Are you going to see They Might Be Giants for three days?
3355492	3358414	No, I'm going to see them for one day, and that's about as much concert as I can stand.
3358734	3359735	It's not a concert.
3359875	3360636	It's a play the game.
3360676	3361817	You make your own concert.
3361837	3362597	Oh, play the game.
3362678	3363258	I see.
3363738	3364319	Well, then no.
3364459	3365960	Yes, it's what we do here on the show, Jamie.
3365980	3367641	We talk about playing games, remember?
3367862	3368162	Well, no.
3371297	3373498	All right, well, Loki, will you go to the Rock Band tour with me?
3374298	3374938	I will definitely go.
3374958	3378099	I'm not sure if it's going to be with you, though, but I will try to make it out there.
3378119	3378739	Gee, thanks.
3378919	3382080	Well, sorry, I don't know if I'm going to... Yeah, I'm definitely going to go.
3382100	3383020	I probably won't go with you.
3383540	3387901	I will make a trip out there with you, but I will also make a trip out there maybe with my work.
3388601	3393202	I will not, on either of those trips, be singing in the game.
3393543	3394523	Fuck that shit.
3394963	3399044	If it comes down, well, all we got left is karaoke for you, I'll be like, fuck you, I'm leaving.
3399950	3404173	I'm sorry, I thought I heard somebody say that we're doing some type of concert for the thing.
3404213	3405214	Oh, no.
3405735	3406475	You're the concert.
3406495	3413600	They basically have this giant semi-truck and there's a stage that they have set up and you play a game.
3414381	3414761	You know what?
3414801	3415822	Screw you, Loki.
3415942	3417023	I'll take Gay Eddie with me.
3417543	3418424	I'll go do it.
3418604	3419685	I'll go play the game.
3419705	3420085	No, no, no.
3420245	3420666	It's fine.
3420766	3421086	I'll go.
3421206	3424148	Because, Rob, when you sing, it's nice and fancy.
3425469	3426530	We'll be the fancy band.
3428100	3430962	Oh my god, we'll be the fancy band boys, oh my god.
3432944	3433944	No, that's what you should be.
3434485	3437487	We are the fancy articulate guys.
3439068	3440869	Loki, you're so silly, I love you so much.
3443071	3446313	You know what, Sal, we're going to get hate mail.
3446333	3449456	No, I really am gay, so I don't hate gay people.
3449516	3451877	I mean, if you really talk like that, that's cool, I don't care.
3452658	3453118	It's just funny.
3454459	3455520	And then you can film it.
3458729	3464211	Okay, speaking of Rock Band, there's some new songs.
3464291	3464992	Oh my god.
3465212	3468793	This is one of the most horrible pictures I have ever seen on this computer.
3468813	3469693	Is that Courtney Love?
3469753	3470994	Is that Courtney Love?
3472475	3473055	Yes, it is.
3473535	3474315	That is Courtney Love.
3474335	3477597	Which, by the way, she'll be making an appearance in Rock Band, you should know.
3477897	3484459	Celebrity Skin by Hole will be in Rock Band, as well as the Yeah Yeah Yeah's Maps and the Pixies' Wave of Mutilation.
3484759	3485980	But very exciting to me.
3486200	3488281	I love this song, Garbages, I Think I'm Paranoid.
3488701	3489361	The Pixies, that's cool.
3514267	3518949	I mean, come on, who does not remember the video to Black Hole Sun back from the days when MTV was cool?
3519750	3525813	Which, by the way, thank you to our live listeners tonight for choosing us over to those skanky awards shows that are going on in MTV right now.
3525833	3526573	Back in the day?
3526613	3527374	Back in the day, yes.
3528314	3530275	That was my freshman year of college.
3530315	3531175	Back in the day.
3532096	3533997	How old are you?
3534017	3533997	31.
3536538	3536938	That's right.
3537639	3540840	She's just a fabulously accessorized girl.
3541281	3542101	That's all she is.
3543653	3544373	Yeah, right.
3544973	3550835	Anyway, that's all I have to say on... Well, speaking of things from back in Rob's day, no, I'm kidding.
3551955	3558076	Black Band is also saying there will be 18 master recordings from the Grateful Dead as downloadable content.
3559216	3559796	Isn't that cool?
3560497	3562677	Oh, gosh, I hope it has Keep On Truckin' in it.
3562937	3567678	Truckin' is one, Uncle John's Band, Touch of Grey, Sugar Magnolia, and Casey Jones.
3568018	3572499	And my best, or my favorite part about the whole thing is they still haven't announced what the price point's gonna be.
3573744	3576426	GhostGuyInOurTerms says Jamie is old?
3576466	3577186	She doesn't sound old.
3590851	3593073	Well, you have to consider this guy's probably 15 or 16 or 18.
3593253	3595835	Bite my butt.
3596876	3597977	But you're young at heart.
3598117	3598918	That's all that matters.
3600139	3603782	Seriously, the older I get, I realize 30 is not as old as you think.
3604503	3605884	I remember when I was 18.
3605964	3609046	I used to think that 30 was old because my mom had me really young.
3609787	3614251	So my mom was 30 when I was in high school.
3614871	3618314	Yeah, my mom was 30 when I was in high school, and I thought 30 was old.
3618454	3618675	Right.
3619744	3621205	And then I saw my friend's parents.
3621725	3623767	I was like, is that your grandmother?
3624467	3629030	When I was in high school, my parents were like 60, so... I always thought that was so bizarre.
3630371	3631712	Um, my mom had me when she was 38.
3632673	3634594	So, like, my mom... My mom had me at 17.
3634754	3635094	Wow.
3635294	3636875	Wow, wow, wow.
3637656	3640538	GhostGuy responded, I'm not gonna bite anyone's butt.
3640558	3644240	I love, I love our chat.
3644260	3645261	That was GhostGuy.
3647822	3647923	Oh.
3647983	3648363	Anyway...
3651140	3653362	Jamie's trying to figure out the whole bathroom situation.
3653382	3653842	Sorry, guys.
3654183	3656444	Yeah, we're listening to Jamie try to get in the bathroom.
3656464	3657105	She's yelling at it.
3658186	3660167	She came, she went out there and she's like, oh, somebody's in there.
3660187	3662028	And I'm thinking, nobody's in there, but I wasn't going to tell her.
3667152	3667733	Anyways.
3667753	3668453	Just be outside.
3668913	3677840	So, surprise, Guitar Hero 3 on the Wii is not going to have download content initially, but at least it will have online play.
3678541	3678901	Apparently,
3680032	3681033	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3701411	3702091	Thanks for watching!
3730774	3731494	It's stupid.
3731594	3732174	It really is.
3732355	3737636	Or just supporting... Or just supporting, you know, maybe additional storage or something.
3737976	3738516	Benstead?
3738616	3738776	No?
3739837	3741437	You can add memory cards to it.
3741497	3744818	Yeah, for saving your save games, but not for anything else.
3745218	3745659	That's it.
3745819	3748639	It's just for save games and maybe virtual console titles and that.
3748679	3753801	Yeah, but I mean, they can't, like, design it so that when you download content that it would go into the memory card?
3753821	3754261	No.
3754281	3756462	That doesn't seem like it'd be that hard for them to design it that way.
3756482	3760283	Well, they have to add a patch or something because right now it doesn't support that, so...
3760945	3763567	Jamie, why did you walk in here and then tell me to die in a boat fire?
3763647	3764328	Because you should.
3765028	3765248	What?
3765529	3766309	That's mean!
3766449	3767410	See, you're mean!
3767530	3773094	You were making fun of me while I was going to the... Especially if you die... That's what we do here.
3773194	3775036	We make fun of you when you're not here.
3775176	3777397	If you die in a boat fire, that's pretty pathetic.
3777898	3778298	Just kidding.
3778758	3781961	If you die in a boat fire, that would be really awesome and stupid.
3782661	3783622	I don't want to die in a boat fire.
3783642	3784643	I'm not going to go on a boat now.
3786184	3787545	Well... Is it my turn yet?
3788099	3788780	No, it's not your turn.
3788820	3789301	It's my turn.
3789421	3796047	And I'm taking my turn to tell you guys that Video Games Live is having a CD release on October 15th.
3796107	3798229	It's their Greatest Hits Volume 1.
3798750	3802013	Now, it's actually not a live show.
3802073	3804976	They didn't go around all these venues and actually tape the songs being played live.
3805797	3808019	But they've actually taken some of these artists in the studio.
3808059	3811703	For instance, Martin Lung, who's like the piano player who plays all the songs.
3811943	3818407	They got him to record some of these songs, and they're going to have the CD come out for World of Warcraft, Super Mario, Halo.
3818927	3819868	It's going to be pretty awesome.
3820668	3821449	That is, if you're a nerd.
3822549	3827613	And it's a rumor, but I believe that each copy is going to come with a lock of Tommy Tallarico's hair.
3829254	3830134	Can't confirm that.
3831475	3832796	From his head or his pubes.
3833816	3834817	It doesn't say.
3837218	3840020	Maybe the limited edition comes from a different place.
3840820	3841621	That's disgusting.
3842434	3845896	Anyway, wow, I think I made myself throw up in my stomach.
3846436	3847957	You threw up in your stomach?
3849418	3849858	Wow.
3851159	3852900	Rob, how does your body even work?
3852920	3855121	This is what happens when I'm gone for a week.
3855281	3857042	Everything just goes to hell.
3857983	3860844	And Rob throws up in his stomach.
3860884	3862945	Which is totally counterproductive.
3863526	3864746	I meant to say my mouth.
3865827	3867348	Didn't I tell you guys, like...
3868032	3870334	That would be like regurgitative eating.
3870814	3871715	That'd be like a mother bird.
3871735	3872176	Isn't that eating?
3872216	3872756	When you eat.
3873056	3874177	Yeah, no, Rob, shut up.
3874217	3875338	It would be like a mother bird.
3875438	3879061	Have you never heard the expression, you just made me throw up in my mouth a little bit?
3879302	3879742	There you go.
3879782	3880963	That's what I was going for.
3881083	3882024	But that's not what you said.
3882044	3883485	For some reason I said stomach.
3883625	3884366	I don't know why.
3884486	3887248	I told you guys at the top of the show, I'm broken tonight.
3888129	3889290	Aw, poor baby.
3889470	3891152	Let's get Rob some duct tape.
3891172	3892533	I haven't even had anything to drink.
3893133	3893714	What's wrong with me?
3894196	3900880	I was going to come last week and bring you my really expensive booze from Greece and it didn't happen.
3901721	3905423	We definitely need to take a break pretty soon because the show is already broken as it is.
3905523	3917730	But we've got one more thing for you guys before we go to a break and that is the one and only website of the week as presented by DarkSakura who surfs the internet up and down and all around every week to find a website she likes to share with all of you.
3918390	3922633	Miss DarkSakura, where should the kids be pointing their web browsers to this week?
3925370	3926050	Somewhere else.
3927511	3930993	No, the website of the week is BBC Radio 1 homepage, actually.
3931973	3936115	I, a lot of times, really hate the crap that's on the radio over here.
3936596	3942719	So I will go, you know, turn on the BBC Radio 1 and listen to it.
3942779	3943159	I also...
3944040	3949523	A lot of times we'll record the interviews that go off of there and some of the music specials.
3950163	3954265	You can actually get a lot of good information off there too.
3954325	3955786	There's other interviews posted.
3955886	3957226	There's your singles charts.
3958287	3961548	You even get in some of the indie stuff that comes through.
3961568	3962429	So I think that's pretty cool.
3962629	3967011	A lot of different variety of music than what we're used to over here.
3967451	3968252	A lot of it's the same.
3968272	3968732	You've got your
3969557	3971038	Tiger Claw says BBC Radio 1 is awesome.
3971058	3972179	The essential mix is the best show.
3995484	4001428	I like listening to... I can't think of her name, but she's one of the DJs on there.
4001568	4003650	She really does some good interviews.
4003730	4004890	Anyway.
4006191	4006492	Very good.
4006872	4008953	Do they still play the Spice Girls on BBC Radio 1?
4009073	4009814	I don't know.
4010174	4011595	Usually I just block that out.
4013156	4014077	I miss the Spice Girls.
4014977	4015918	The Shice Girls?
4016058	4018840	Eddie, you want to go see the reunion tour with me in San Jose?
4018960	4020241	I so want to go, like so bad.
4020781	4021162	Me too.
4021182	4023803	Remember?
4024224	4024564	Remember?
4024978	4025699	Why am I out here?
4027159	4034044	Yeah, no wait, the short, no, the very short version is that Irene and I, it was like 3 in the morning, we're playing Spice World, I don't know if you guys remember that game from PS1.
4034384	4035324	That game was awful!
4035344	4037746	Yeah, it was awesome, awful, awful, awesome.
4038106	4043609	And like, we were laughing so hard, and it's like 3 in the morning, so of course Rob comes out wagging his finger, why am I out here?
4043990	4046291	Because we were being bad and Rob was going to spank us, I don't know.
4048382	4049483	Well, never mind.
4049503	4053825	There's another part to this story, but I can't say it, even though the show's already got an explicit tag.
4054245	4059769	Let's just say they were interrupting something from all their laughing.
4062130	4062810	And I was very upset.
4066893	4071996	I think we need to take a break on the show now, because I don't actually know how much video game content was in tonight's program.
4072396	4077599	So we will go, and the people responsible for screwing up tonight's program will be sacked.
4078457	4082359	And those responsible for the sacking would like it to be known that they too have just been sacked.
4082579	4085400	Alright, so everybody will be sacked during our break.
4085640	4089781	And we're going to come back with a stupendous Part B. It'll be fancy and nice.
4089801	4092202	Doing it in a completely different manner and at great expense.
4093142	4097344	Because honestly, guys, there's only one way we could probably fuck up this show even more.
4097784	4099025	That's by letting Rob keep talking.
4099845	4100765	Well, that would be one.
4101145	4103846	But the other would be is that tonight, and by the way, fuck you.
4105507	4107968	Tonight's Part B. Do not want.
4110703	4111724	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4128543	4129984	That means I have to sound really apathetic.
4130004	4131645	May we go to break time now?
