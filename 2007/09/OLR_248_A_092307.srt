00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,720
Tonight, September 23rd, 2007, a highly anticipated Wii game is going online, Sony goes back to

2
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:31,680
good vibrations, and have we finally figured out what the game Africa is all about?

3
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,440
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

4
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,040
Radio. We are that video game program dedicated to video games, gaming, gamer culture, the

5
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,480
gamer lifestyle, and boobs, right Dark Sakura? Yes, I have some. Alright, congratulations.

6
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,600
Thank you, I'll tell my mom. Alright, yes please tell her about the show you do on the

7
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,880
internet where we talked about your boobs tonight. I'm sure she'll really appreciate

8
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,400
that. You've called her. I know, that was an old OLR stunt, that was old news. That

9
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,920
was yesterday's news. Let's not call my mom today, okay? Alright, probably not. Also joining

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,360
us, the man with no boobs, and that's a good thing, Loki. Hello. How you doing, Loki? Fine.

11
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,240
Awesome. And it's just the three of us here in studio tonight, just feeling the love between

12
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,360
the three of us since there's no guests to speak of tonight. Miklotov sadly moved back

13
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,560
to Kansas so he's not going to be on the show for a long time. He might be back in December

14
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,040
for a little bit but we won't have him on for a while. Trying to get our friend Casper

15
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,960
the Gay back on a future episode but, you know, we have to be careful because you have

16
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,480
too much of him on the show at once. The show might just combust. So, sometimes it's good

17
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:39,160
to just have the three of us and you guys in the chat room over at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

18
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,840
Folks in the chat room there. I see some new faces in chat tonight. Welcome everybody in

19
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,280
the chat room. Really appreciate you guys tuning in live here on this Sunday night.

20
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,960
Alright, let's start off the show. Enough chit chat. How was your gaming week? Dark

21
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,280
Sakura, how was your gaming week? Um, I started playing a game again. One that I played for

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,200
a very, very, very, very, very long time. Ooh, did you get into Final Fantasy XI again

23
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:06,080
too? Fuck no. I'm playing Ragnarok Online again. Heal please. Oh, what are you playing?

24
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,040
Because you were a white mage in Final Fantasy XI. So, what are you playing as in Ragnarok

25
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:15,080
now? Well, I started off with a ninja and they kind of suck. So, I went back to my old

26
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:26,920
standby of Assassin and, um, right now I am at level 79-47 I think. Uh huh. 79 base, 47

27
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,380
job. Sheesh. Assassin. Well, it's a 50-50-50 server. I haven't played Ragnarok in a long

28
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,640
time so I kind of forget what that means, but it just sounds like borderline addict.

29
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,140
Well, um, the whole thing about it is that it's very, um, it's pretty quick leveling

30
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,760
the way that they've got the ratio set up with lots and lots of loot. Wait a minute.

31
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,480
You said you're playing on a server that's 50-50-50? Yeah. Gravity's going to come in

32
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,920
and say, we ban you! Fuck Gravity. They can't. They're playing on a 50-50 server. They can't

33
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,040
do anything. And besides that, I can go back to IRO anytime I want to because I was in

34
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,080
the beta and they don't delete the beta characters. Oh, that's good. So, my characters are still

35
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:15,040
sitting there. And to tell DJ Dark Knight, the Ninja class I haven't quite figured out

36
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,520
just because I haven't found any good FAQs in English. And Dark Knight's comment for

37
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,040
the record was, Ninjas don't suck, Jamie. It's 50-50-50, by the way. And what does 50-50-50

38
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,520
mean? Meaning that it's a higher ratio for leveling. You get more experience, more loot.

39
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:40,480
It's more, okay, it's more experience for base level, for job level, and for your loot.

40
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,640
It's drop rate. So, um, it means you get a whole bunch of crap. And like, I was already

41
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:54,440
over 400,000 zenny for money, like, in two days. So, and the thing is that I just don't

42
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,660
like play and play and play and play. I play and then sit and do other stuff while I'm

43
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,480
talking to people and then go, oh, I'm still logged into Ragnarok and play some more. And

44
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,320
then go, okay, I'm bored, sit, and then go do other stuff. So, because it's windowed

45
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,080
and really easy, I can just leave it running. And the server's really nice. I'm playing

46
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,520
on Deliverance Online, if anyone. Windowed MMOs for the win. Windows, yes. I am going

47
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,120
to be quitting World of Warcraft until such a day that I have a PC that works that will

48
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,840
run it. I'm going to be playing Guild Wars instead, because thanks to Plan C, I only

49
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,240
took them like, I'd have to say four business days, I think, that they got me my, um, my

50
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,160
key restored. So nice. And they, they email it right to you. Everything's cool. So I'm

51
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:47,160
gonna go, uh, it's really cool. Instead of just being all like, oh, fuck you, your key's

52
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,520
broken. You lose. They will actually, if you, if you send them a high quality enough image,

53
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:59,080
they will, um, decipher what your key is. Wow. And, um, give, give you whatever your

54
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,120
key was. They'll base it off of the one that you were given. Dang. So their customer service

55
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,240
is really good then, huh? Oh yeah. I wouldn't think that they, I would think most companies

56
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,600
would tell you too bad, so sad. They're really on the ball. Wow. Really on the ball. And

57
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:19,720
I also, um, we got stuff. Dan came back from the Game Crazy Manager Conference. So I'm

58
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,600
getting a free Halo 3. I'm getting a free Heavenly Sword, which I want to play. I'm

59
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,760
looking forward to it. We got a copy of Jean Dark already, which I'm going to be playing

60
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:33,760
through. Um, he got some other games. We're supposed to be getting Mass Effect. He said

61
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,760
that it looked really, really, really sweet. Yeah, I'm, I'm looking forward to that too.

62
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,240
And then, um, he got to play, uh, uh, Dracula X Collection and he thought it was really

63
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,440
cool. Um, I actually watched a bunch of videos from Tokyo Game Show. Um, not from Tokyo Game

64
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,040
Show, but, um, well, from Tokyo Game Show, I watched the, the Knights demo, but I was

65
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:59,000
watching the, um, the footage from, uh, uh, Rondo of Blood and it looked really, really,

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,400
really good. I think I'm going to be very impressed with it. And, um, we got a whole

67
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,120
bunch of t-shirts that we don't want and we're getting a, uh, Wii Zapper and we already,

68
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,520
he came home with a Wii Sword. So rub it in with all this free shit you're getting. I'm,

69
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,920
uh, looking in chat, some folks, uh, dissing Heavenly Sword in chat. Fildos. I don't care.

70
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,640
I'm playing it anyway. I like that name, by the way. Fildos says, I beat Heavenly Sword

71
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,440
in five minutes and Mikosense says Heavenly Sword in all that great. I don't care. It's

72
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,060
free and I'm playing it. It does look pretty. Pretty things are good. Like I said, it's

73
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,240
free and I'm playing it. There you go. All right. Uh, let's go over to Loki. Loki, how

74
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,920
was your gaming week? Uh, my week was a little busy. Um, let's see. Of course at work I've

75
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,880
been playing more Saints Row multiplayer. Now we're doing all Rocket matches, which

76
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:52,320
are pretty fun. Um, then of course, you know, the big one, um, I got Halo 3 early and you're

77
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,680
breaking stuff. Sorry. Um, so I actually have already finished the game. Um, it's kind of

78
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:05,480
short. Reminds me, see now I never really played, I mean I played Halo once or twice

79
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,680
and I've played Halo 2 maybe once or twice, but never through the entire story mode. So

80
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,620
I think most of the story and the ending stuff is pretty lost to me as far as, uh, the impact

81
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:23,360
I guess. But, um, I don't know. It was good. It reminds me a lot of Resistance. I mean

82
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:30,360
there's a lot of parallels between this game and that one. So, I don't know. How so? Well,

83
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,640
I don't want to give away too much. I mean, I don't know, I mean if anyone's actually

84
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,720
heard anything about the game, you know, there's a race called the Flood and they remind me

85
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:46,360
a lot of the race of creatures that you fight in Resistance. Um, I don't know. The game

86
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,680
itself is pretty good. I liked it. Um, the multiplayer is pretty fun. I can't wait to

87
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,680
play more of that. And then co-op I really want to give a try to some of that. Overall

88
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,120
it's pretty good. Definitely not the best game this year. Definitely not the best looking

89
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,400
game this year, but I don't think you really need to have the best graphics to make great

90
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,800
games. So, it should be good. And I know that Bungie supports their games pretty well, so

91
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,720
I can't wait to see what they do with the rest of it. Um, then the last game, well actually

92
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,880
there's a few others. I played Brain Age 2. I bought that for Nelly and I don't like that

93
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:30,320
game. I don't like that game because, why? The text recognition and the voice recognition

94
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,560
are horrible. They're absolutely horrible. Like there's a part where you're having to

95
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,040
yell out, you know, rock, paper, scissor and you're playing that and you either have to

96
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:46,400
win or lose. And it did not understand scissor. I had to like go, scissor, scissor, scissor.

97
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,920
And it finally is like, oh, okay you got it. Or it'll just say you got it wrong. And then

98
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,400
there's another one, it was addition, where you had to like insert the, um, the operative

99
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,600
for a math problem. So, you know, I'd draw a plus or something and it would think it's

100
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,520
a multiplication, like an X or something. I'm like, that does not look like an X at

101
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,520
all. Or there's another one that wanted me to spell out stuff, um, to like create a word

102
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,520
and I was trying to draw a B. And I mean, it looks like a B and it thinks I'm drawing

103
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,640
like a D or like something else. It can't recognize my handwriting. You know, so it

104
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,860
gives me a really crappy, you know, time on it because it's stupid. So, I don't know.

105
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:30,440
It's really frustrating. Luckily, I didn't buy it for me, so that's all good. Um, then

106
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:36,760
the last game I played was Rock Band. I actually went out to, um, Sacramento today to check

107
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,080
out the Rock Band. They're doing that mobile tour thing.

108
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:45,740
I knew I forgot to do something this weekend. And, um, so it was interesting. Um, there's

109
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:51,200
actually hardly anyone there. I mean, they had enough stations for about, I would say

110
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,440
twenty people to play at once. They had like five different setups, so it was pretty easy

111
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,200
to get in there. Um, the problem I had, and hopefully this is not reflecting the final

112
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,560
product is, that guitar, man, there was some issues with that strum bar. It just was not

113
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,880
working at all. I mean, I failed two songs on easy. And I mean, I'm not great. You know,

114
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,000
I can do the three keys fine, but this thing was not hitting right at all. And they were

115
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,480
like, well, I don't know if it's the humidity or what. And it wasn't very humid out. But

116
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,080
I'm like, there's like barely any humidity in California, people.

117
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,920
The humidity or whatever, but pushing down the strum bar doesn't work. You gotta pull

118
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:35,920
up sometimes, because the down will stop working. I'm like, okay. So, you know, pulling up worked

119
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,800
fine, and we ended up playing Tom Sawyer, and that was okay. Um, the game itself looks

120
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,360
exactly like Guitar Hero. I mean, if you've seen Guitar Hero and you've seen Kariok Hero

121
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,120
Evolution, it's just those two games combined. It's not a big surprise. The drums look kind

122
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,360
of neat. The way they had them set up, though, they were very low to the ground. But it worked

123
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,480
for whoever was playing drums. I ended up playing the bass guitar, because that was

124
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,720
all that was left. And I do like the buttons on it. They have buttons towards the top and

125
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,040
of course towards the bottom for like, I guess, solo stuff. I never really figured out, because

126
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,740
you can use the bottom buttons the entire game. And I guess you use them also when you're

127
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:21,740
doing the finale part. Other than that, there's a little effector thing there. You can switch

128
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,680
between like five different effects, including like chorus, echo, and they have like some

129
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:33,680
wah-wah and other stuff that you can do. So, it was okay. But, I don't know. The guitar

130
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,320
thing, also they were a little bit thinner, and probably about as light as a normal Guitar

131
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,080
Hero guitar. So, the guitars look good. I don't know. I mean, I'm sure that the guitar

132
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:50,940
has been through all sorts of abuse if it's on this tour. So, I'm attributing to that,

133
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,560
but I hope that there isn't an issue with the guitars when it comes out, because that

134
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:00,320
game is quite expensive. So, we'll have to see. But otherwise, it was fun. Definitely

135
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,480
fun. I like the whole team kind of aspect to it, because my guitar was giving me shit.

136
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:11,440
And so, I failed the first song, and my other teammates kind of got me back into the game.

137
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,520
And the same thing happened in reverse the last time. The drummer failed, and I got him

138
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,920
back in there with the bass guitar. So, that's kind of cool. I don't know. It was a good

139
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:27,360
game though. But, if you expect anything really different from Guitar Hero, you're going to

140
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,360
be disappointed. But, it'll look good. All right. So, do you think that Rock Band

141
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,840
got lots of awards at E3 2007? Do you think that it's worthy of all the praise it's been

142
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,200
getting? I think so. I think, well, Guitar Hero 3, I don't really think they're doing

143
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,800
too much different, other than the fact that they're going to be catering to more of a

144
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:51,120
hardcore crowd. It's kind of like the In The Groove. If In The Groove were created by Konami,

145
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,600
this would be kind of like that. Where it's a game catered towards people that really

146
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:02,640
want insane charts to play. Whereas, Rock Band's going to be a little bit different,

147
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,600
because they're going to try to appeal to everybody. The place that they had it showing

148
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,120
today was this Rhythm and Ribs Festival. It was a bunch of middle-aged people listening

149
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:22,400
to blues music and stuff, eating ribs. I just happened to go just to play this game. But,

150
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,600
I think it'll be good. The problem is, they're going to have a tough time selling it for

151
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,160
200 bucks. From what I hear, and I don't know if this is going to be exactly the case, they're

152
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,720
only going to be selling the game by itself, and also that special edition, which is going

153
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,520
to have the guitar, drums, and microphone. Those are the only two ways that they're going

154
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:48,440
to have them. But, I guess in 2008, in January, they're going to start selling the drums and

155
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:56,840
the guitars separately. So, I don't know. Alright. Well, my gaming week, I also got

156
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,360
to play Halo 3 for about 15 minutes, because Loki brought it over here, and I wanted to

157
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,120
see it. So, I got part of the way through the jungle.

158
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,040
One last thing I forgot to mention. Since I did get the collector's edition, there's

159
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,960
another game that's actually on the disc, on the add-on disc. It's almost like a flash

160
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:25,680
game where you have to put grenades underneath a warthog to fling it into the air to destroy

161
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,720
aliens. Let me show the game to the OP11 people again

162
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,280
so you can see the box, because this is different than the box art I've been seeing online,

163
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,520
because most of the reviewers got the regular copy of Halo 3, but you somehow managed one

164
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,760
of these little special edition things, so it's pretty neat there.

165
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,400
So again, if you want to look at webcam feed of our show archived, it's operate11.com.

166
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,640
Sometimes we hold up random things in front of the camera just to show what's going on.

167
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:53,660
So I played Halo 3, which was pretty cool. Again, I certainly haven't played enough to

168
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,720
give an opinion of it. It certainly looked nice, I'll say that.

169
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,840
And I like the customization. I love the customization in games like that.

170
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,360
And all I have to say is I was able to make my emblem a unicorn, and it was awesome, because

171
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,040
unicorns are rad. So there you go.

172
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:15,160
More on Halo 3 next week. I have been spending my entire freaking week

173
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,800
playing Eternal Sonata. I ran out and bought this game the day it came out, because I really

174
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,880
enjoyed the demo, and I have been loving the game.

175
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,960
And I've been reading some of the reviews online of the game, and I honestly think most

176
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,680
of the critics have been pretty harsh on this game.

177
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,880
I think critics across the board just don't really care for Japanese role-playing games,

178
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,760
especially 360 reviewers. Because on the 360, you don't get a lot of

179
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:42,900
games like this, but this is kind of a throwback to some really rad PlayStation 2 games I can

180
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,880
think of in the past. So I don't know, I would say if you're a fan

181
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,840
of these types of Japanese role-playing games, don't listen to the reviews.

182
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,880
Is the game perfect? No. Some of my issues with the game is that the

183
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,160
game tends to repeat the monsters over and over again.

184
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,120
Like you go into a dungeon, and there's basically only two types of monsters you can fight.

185
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,240
There's scorpions, there's other things, flying bugs or something, I don't know.

186
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,920
So the monsters get a little stale, and the game does feel a little bit easy on the easy

187
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,920
side. But that's probably just the way that I play

188
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,940
RPGs usually, is I grind hella much in the beginning so that I'm one step ahead on the

189
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,080
EXP. But otherwise, I think the game is awesome.

190
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,160
I love the battle system in the game, because with the battle system, basically the play

191
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,640
field is live. You run around the field, you have five seconds,

192
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,920
depending on what level your party's at, you have five seconds, then like four seconds,

193
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,640
you have a certain amount of time to run around the battlefield to where the monster is, and

194
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,880
then attack or what have you. So it's like a tactical mixed with a Final

195
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,240
Fantasy type battle system. It's really cool.

196
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,360
And then there's light spots and dark spots, and the special attacks you do in the light

197
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,280
spots are one thing, and the dark spots are completely a different thing.

198
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,100
And of course, every character has their own stuff, and later on, as you advance, the one

199
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,720
cool thing is that the battle system builds and builds.

200
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,920
In the beginning, your five seconds only counts down when you're actually doing something.

201
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,540
But then later on, you have four seconds that counts down no matter what.

202
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,720
But you get perks from that. You get this echo meter that you build up.

203
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,800
So the more attacks you do, the more damage your special attacks do.

204
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,560
It's pretty neat, intricate, the way the game works.

205
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:23,040
And the game is beautiful, very colorful, lots of greens, blues, reds, you know, just

206
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,320
all these different types of areas, snow areas, fire areas, you know, just really shows off

207
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,600
the graphical capabilities of the 360. And I, for one, think the story is pretty

208
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,240
awesome. I mean, it's certainly one of the most original

209
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,100
stories you'll see out there. I mean, it's based around Chopin, and how

210
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:45,720
in the last days of Chopin's life, he was kind of dreaming up this fantasy world, and

211
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,120
this whole story takes place in a fantasy world.

212
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,820
But it's really deep, and it's really weird. Like, one thing I hadn't heard about until

213
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,580
I really started playing the game was that at random occurrences, the game will actually

214
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:01,420
cut away to these, like, educational pieces about Chopin's life.

215
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,920
It's so weird. Boo, education!

216
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,820
No, no, no, no. It's not like that.

217
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,760
It tells stories about Chopin's life, and while it's doing that, it shows, like, pictures.

218
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,340
It shows, like, really beautiful high-definition pictures from, you know, Poland and France

219
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,460
and all these places that he lived, and it tells you these things about Chopin's life.

220
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,800
But the pieces, and they're playing the scores on piano.

221
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,440
And by the way, for you DDR fans, the song Kakumei from DDR Max 2, you remember that

222
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,680
song? That's based on a Chopin piece, Revolution,

223
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,740
and Revolution is the whole second stage in the game.

224
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,220
So you actually hear the original piano piece, and it's showing you all these pictures, kind

225
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,760
of telling you about Chopin's life, and what it is is kind of mirroring what's going on

226
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,980
in the game. And it's just really interesting.

227
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:52,660
Some really long monologues and stuff. It's a good story. Certainly worth checking

228
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,580
out. Some of the voice acting is actually really

229
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,780
good. Some of it is a little bit irritating, like,

230
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:05,060
I don't care for the little child beat or polka, but some of the other voice acting

231
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,860
is really, really good in the game. So I definitely recommend it.

232
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:14,300
If you own a 360 and you are into role-playing games of the Japanese style at all, you totally

233
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,200
should check this one out. I think it's better than a lot of critics

234
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,900
are making it out to be. Not that critics are giving it bad scores,

235
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,980
but like 7s and 8s, but I would definitely say this game is at least an 8.5, if not a

236
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,140
9. It probably will be one of my favorite games

237
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,860
of the year. Going to chat room, looking at some comments

238
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,460
there. Chat.orangelandradio.com if you guys want

239
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,820
to participate. Ghost says, anyway, Eternal Sonata looks beautiful.

240
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:43,140
GS68 says, fuck corporate reviewers. WTF, I can only move in two dimensions.

241
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,380
There's no save points, I keep dying, and the game can be beaten in under one hour?

242
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:52,420
Negative 264 out of 10. You know, I think the thing about reviews

243
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,540
is that everybody's different. Everybody's different and likes different

244
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,700
stuff, including the reviewers out there like different stuff.

245
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,700
So, you just have to kind of find that reviewer that matches your taste, and maybe that's

246
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,860
me here on this show, or maybe it is somebody that writes for one of the corporate sites.

247
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,300
And I also think people are influenced by hype and stuff, like for example, if I wanted

248
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:16,020
to rate Halo like a 7 or 8 or something like that, people would be jumping all over me.

249
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,220
They'd be like, what the hell, this is the game of the year, blah blah blah blah blah.

250
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,980
I mean, hype does go a long way, that's for sure.

251
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,100
And also, did you notice that those commercials for Halo 3 that they have right now, like

252
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,840
the final set of commercials and teasers and stuff, completely suck.

253
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,860
It's like that they have a marketing person from Sony come over and create commercials

254
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,420
for them, like with that stupid digital museum shit.

255
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,860
It just shows fucking gameplay. That's all you got to show.

256
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,860
You don't need to show some fucking old guy talking about a plasma rifle or some shit

257
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,900
like that. No one knows nor cares what it's for.

258
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,460
I don't know, it's stupid.

259
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,640
By the way, the story in Eternal Sonata is kind of a real downer.

260
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,260
Like, you don't really see these types of stories in games, but I'm not going to real

261
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,860
spoil anything, because the very first thing you see is one of the characters jumping off

262
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,740
a cliff, apparently committing suicide, talking about letting herself go or whatever.

263
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,500
And then of course, you know, Chopin is dying, and he's actually a character in the game.

264
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,580
He's talking about dying.

265
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,140
Meanwhile, there's another character who's 14 years old who realizes that because she

266
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,940
can use magic, she has an incurable illness.

267
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,300
So it's like all these people are dying, and then there was one death scene at the end

268
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:30,260
of one of the chapters I just beat, and this character died, and she realized all the wrong

269
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:35,460
that she had done in the world, and gives this five-minute monologue before she dies

270
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,100
and lets this dove go free as her last dying wish.

271
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,660
I mean, it sounds hokey the way I'm describing it, but actually, the way it was done was

272
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,660
really cool.

273
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,980
It's got good news and bad news for you.

274
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,420
Good news, you can do magic.

275
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,040
What's the bad news?

276
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
You have brain cancer.

277
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,300
Essentially, that's what it is, but here's the interesting thing is they try to make

278
00:21:54,300 --> 00:22:01,660
parallels between that character and Chopin's sister who died as a teenager of tuberculosis.

279
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,900
See there's all these really interesting parallels in it that I think make the story certainly

280
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,300
really creative.

281
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:12,860
You know, you may have those cliche RPG moments in it, but it's certainly never seen anything

282
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,860
like this before.

283
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:20,020
You know, if TB gave you magical powers, maybe people wouldn't be so sad over it, you know?

284
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,820
I mean, you are so wrong.

285
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,620
I don't even know what to tell you.

286
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,140
There are some magicians out there which would get TB.

287
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,140
I'm looking at you, David Copperfield.

288
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,300
Alright, anyhow, that's really all I've been playing.

289
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,200
I checked out that one game that came out on Xbox Live this week.

290
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
What is it?

291
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
Geos or whatever?

292
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
I don't know.

293
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
It looks stupid.

294
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
Was it Geos, the system on the Commodore 64?

295
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
It's like Geon Emotions or something.

296
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Isn't that like an English school in Japan?

297
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
I don't know.

298
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
Geon Emotions.

299
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Oh, is it Geon?

300
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,200
I don't know.

301
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,200
Maybe I was thinking of the Commodore 64 thing.

302
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,200
It's Geon, I'm not going to buy it.

303
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,900
That's what it's called.

304
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,900
It was okay.

305
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,980
I played it for like 15 minutes and then I was like, I need to go back to Eternal Sonata

306
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,660
because I'm not progressing enough in the story.

307
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,000
I don't know where the hell these reviewers are saying this game is too short.

308
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,740
I've been playing for about 16 hours now and I think I'm maybe at the halfway point.

309
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,120
It may be a little past.

310
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,620
Like 30 hours is short for an RPG.

311
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,900
How long did it take you to beat Halo 3, Loki?

312
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:18,300
Well, I got the game on Wednesday and I finished it today.

313
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,300
And I didn't play that long.

314
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:24,080
I mean, maybe, I'd say maybe 10 hours at the most.

315
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,080
There you go.

316
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,080
And let me put it this way.

317
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,020
I mean, I guess, granted, Halo 3 has a shitload of replayability value thanks to the multiplayer

318
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,020
mode.

319
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,080
Well, there's a lot of stuff you can go back and, like, I played it on Normal difficulty,

320
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,080
which I hear is super easy, but, you know, I just wanted to start at Normal.

321
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,300
Had I realized that you can actually go through, like, Legendary or something like that and

322
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,660
then you'll get the achievements for all the other difficulties, I would have saved myself

323
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,540
some time and just played on the hardest difficulty.

324
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:55,380
But I was going to say, if one bit of advice, so whenever you get into a sequence where

325
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,760
someone's piloting a vehicle, I highly recommend you kick them out of the driver's seat and

326
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,920
you pilot the vehicle because the AI sucks at piloting vehicles.

327
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,860
Completely awful.

328
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,580
Especially if a woman's driving the car, correct?

329
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,780
Oh my God, there was someone driving, there was a woman driving the fucking, like, one

330
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:17,660
of the mongooses in the game and fucking just said, I'm going to jump this cliff and then,

331
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,100
like, boom, straight down the cliff or, like, slam it into the wall and stuff.

332
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,580
I'm like, okay, woman out, I'll drive this.

333
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,980
I'm just like, you know, I drove by like typical.

334
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,820
That was hilarious.

335
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:34,380
DarkSakura, will you be playing Halo 3?

336
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,540
If first person shooters didn't make me puke, then maybe.

337
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:42,660
No, actually, even if first person shooters made me puke, no.

338
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,020
Because you're too busy with Ragnarok.

339
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,540
No, because I'm too busy playing good games.

340
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,340
Oh, snap.

341
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:53,460
Alright, let's, uh, I guess that's it, that's really all I have to say for my gaming week.

342
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:58,300
I've talked far too much about those games I've been playing this week, so let's get

343
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:03,000
into some housekeeping, of which there's not a lot tonight, no really big changes coming

344
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,060
up with the show, except that we do have episode 250 is only two weeks away, although we're

345
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,860
not planning a whole lot of special stuff for that because we already had, like, a fifth

346
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:15,180
year anniversary show this year, we do just want to point that out, that maybe something

347
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:19,060
special will happen, something little will happen in a couple weeks, we'll see.

348
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:24,100
In the meantime, our show is still simulcast on Operator 11, which you can visit operator11.com

349
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:29,220
and look at the old video of our feeds, or you can always join our communities on Live

350
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,060
Journal and Myspace and Facebook, I forgot to say the Facebook people last week, but

351
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:38,380
the reason why I neglected to mention Facebook last week is because Facebook has been fucking

352
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:42,820
bugging me lately, like, oh, I'm going to take a lot of shit for this, I seriously think

353
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,900
Facebook is getting worse than Myspace, and you know why?

354
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,300
It's because of all those little add-ins that they have on the pages now, like, I get all

355
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:56,460
these invites to play Pirates vs Ninjas, to have a movie list, to have a, it's just turned

356
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:02,340
into a bunch of crap, I mean, at least on Myspace, if my page sucks, that's my fault,

357
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,620
but I don't know, I don't want to start a social networking war, but I apologize to

358
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,980
the Facebook fans, twice, for my behavior this week.

359
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:16,860
So that's that, let's get into some gaming news, and we'll talk about that.

360
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:21,920
Well, this week we had a lot of big announcements, of course, because Tokyo Game Show was going

361
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,700
on.

362
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:28,160
One interesting thing though, and will probably be a sigh of relief for a lot of people, Super

363
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:34,480
Smash Bros. Brawl has revealed their online plans, yes, there will be friends codes, at

364
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,980
least it will be online, so that's good, thank god, there will be options to play against

365
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:46,700
friends or to play against anybody, so, I don't know, kind of, I guess, typical for

366
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:54,020
your normal Nintendo online game, so yeah, pretty awesome.

367
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:58,820
And on the dojo this week, they put up all these snake things, like they finally, you

368
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:03,260
know, I guess, what do you want to say, officially unveiled Snake as a character on the dojo,

369
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:07,940
although thanks to E3 last year, we already knew it was coming, but they actually officially,

370
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,940
you know, rolled out his profile and everything on the site, and there's a pretty awesome

371
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:16,100
picture of him, it's kind of a homoerotic pose, with him and Ike coming up behind him

372
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,820
and doing the whole, like, I'm going to snap your neck type thing, or who knows what.

373
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,500
You know, I remember that one game that I had, and I cannot remember the name for the

374
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:29,340
life of me, that had a bunch of Hudson characters, and like Hasbro characters in it and stuff,

375
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,660
remember Snake was in there.

376
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,660
Wasn't that the one where you could be, like, Optimus Prime?

377
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,620
Yeah, you could do Optimus Prime vs. Barbie, I mean, how awesome is that?

378
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,020
That was on the DS, right?

379
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:43,260
Yeah, it was like, you could play as Bomberman, or no, it wasn't DS, it was on the Playstation

380
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:49,060
2, it was, they had Bomberman, Snake, they actually had Simon Belmont, you could play

381
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:54,060
as Barbie, there was Optimus Prime...

382
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,820
Dark Tetsuya and Rob D are yelling, Dream Mix TV World Fighters!

383
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,200
Yes, that's it, yeah, that's awesome.

384
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,940
So, you know, really, they could have just ripped that out of, or ripped Snake from there,

385
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:08,140
and just used all of his moves, because from what I've seen on Super Smash Brothers already,

386
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:12,340
it's kind of similar anyways, so, I don't know.

387
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,340
Interesting.

388
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,020
Optimus Prime vs. Barbie, awesome.

389
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:18,340
It made me think of a completely different game, even though it's not the same.

390
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:23,100
The, what was it, Super Konami World, where you could, you played original characters

391
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,900
that went into different Konami games, it was very interesting.

392
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,900
Very cool.

393
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,340
And that's the one, you could be like, Miss Cool Ninja, what is this, going on, you could

394
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,340
be like...

395
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,340
You could go into that world.

396
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,340
Yeah, that's cool.

397
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,340
I think I played that once.

398
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,260
And I think there was like a Yayar Kung Fu level or something.

399
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,260
That's random.

400
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:45,420
Alright, anyhow, I also wanted to say about this though, what do you think about the whole

401
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:50,640
fact that when you play online against strangers, you don't get to see their names, you don't

402
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,980
get to have the little chat bubbles, nothing, it's just a straight up, it's almost like

403
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,340
playing against the computer, except the computer is actually being controlled by someone real

404
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,340
you don't know.

405
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,420
It doesn't save stats, it doesn't do anything.

406
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,540
I mean, in my mind, I'm kind of like, well, then why do they even bother?

407
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:11,660
Because you can't track who you're playing, you can't, if you liked playing with them,

408
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,660
you can't play with them again later, I mean, there's like none of that.

409
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:18,140
But I suppose this is just more bitching about Nintendo's online mode.

410
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,420
All I gotta say is their online needs a major overhaul.

411
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:28,100
I mean, I heard rumors that there's supposed to be some major update coming this month,

412
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:34,180
and with next week being the last week of the month, I don't think that's gonna happen.

413
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:38,100
You know, I do like what they're doing with the friend stuff, like if you have a friend

414
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,300
added, you know, how you can do, in lieu of voice chat, I mean, since they don't have

415
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,780
that, you can do the little speech bubbles and things, I mean, that's kind of neat,

416
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,780
I guess.

417
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:51,780
I don't know, part of the reason the DS online thing works is, I don't know how you guys

418
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:55,900
do it, but the way I play DS online is that I'll be chatting with someone on AOL, and

419
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,380
they'll be like, hey, you wanna play something on DS?

420
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,900
I'm like, okay, and so then I'll play the game, and then as soon as the game overs,

421
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,580
I can go right over and chat with them, like, haha, I kicked your ass, or, boy, you own

422
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,580
me, or whatever.

423
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,360
Yeah, but even- But you can't do that on the Wii now, unless

424
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,360
I have a laptop.

425
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:14,580
But even the DS has more features in their online games than the Wii has, I mean, shit,

426
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,580
it's like they've got voice chat, they have lobbies and stuff like that, the Wii doesn't

427
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,580
have that.

428
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,900
I mean, come on, there's more technology in the Wii than there is in the DS, why can't

429
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,340
they implement the stuff that's already implemented in other things?

430
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:30,340
And if the DS can handle voice chat, why can't the fucking Wii handle it?

431
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:34,820
The Rob D. in our chat says, honestly, Sky, Wii fighter fans get so few bones thrown to

432
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:38,200
us in terms of online play that I, for one, don't even care.

433
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,780
Online play on a fighter is enough for me right now.

434
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:46,180
And Rob D. says, when I play on DS, we chat on Skype, too, that'll work.

435
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:50,340
And I guess, in a way, you have a point, it's better than nothing.

436
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:54,000
And I think that's a lot of the reaction people are having to this news, at least that's kind

437
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,840
of what I said, I said, okay, at least it's a step in the right direction, and it's better

438
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,260
than not being online at all, like Metroid Prime 3.

439
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:07,680
But still, you look at the mainframe and everything that Xbox Live has to offer, and you kind

440
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:12,460
of go, jeez, Nintendo really feels like a little bit behind in these realms of online

441
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,460
play.

442
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,500
But I suppose with their whole, you know, we're not making games for the hardcore gamers

443
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:22,060
all the time type thing, maybe they can get away with that, and they probably can.

444
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,060
So what have you?

445
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:27,600
Well, if you have some further comments on this, you can always send us an email, mailbag

446
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,980
at orangelandrater.com is the place to go.

447
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:37,700
Meanwhile, I have some news for you guys, and it has to do with Star Wars The Force

448
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,900
Unleashed.

449
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:44,060
It's a new game coming out on the Nintendo Wii, and you know, a lot of folks are very

450
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:48,300
excited that they're finally getting a Star Wars game, because of course, you know, Star

451
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:53,340
Wars game equals, ooh, we're gonna have big lightsaber battles finally on the Wii, yes,

452
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,700
what the Wii was made for.

453
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:59,120
Well, according to a recent episode of the 1UP Podcast, thanks to my Twitter friends

454
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,580
for pointing this out to me, it may not be so.

455
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:07,300
It looks like the game may actually not feature that kind of support for...

456
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,660
I would say, because I thought this was coming out on like 360 and Playstation 3 as well.

457
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,660
Yeah, it's probably one.

458
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:16,740
And it's just gonna be kind of like, you know, Knights of the Old Republic or something like

459
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:22,780
that, you know, but a little bit more physics and stuff like, you know, it's gonna look

460
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,780
pretty.

461
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:27,980
But it's not like a true, you know, like playing the Star Wars arcade game, you know, the new

462
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:32,740
arcade game where they had, you know, the actual lightsaber and stuff that you can play

463
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,740
around with.

464
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:37,020
I suppose there will be more to come on this, however, I'll leave you with this official

465
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:41,580
quote from the president of LucasArts, Jim Ward, quote, Wii is a great platform for the

466
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:46,180
Force Unleashed because the console's motion-oriented controllers really bring the game to life.

467
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:50,260
We've worked hard to make the Wii version of the game unique in order to truly let you

468
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,820
unleash the Force.

469
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:56,300
Hmm, but if you, I mean, I don't know, I don't know to what validity the other podcast information

470
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,940
is, but if it's not that way, that's gonna be a bummer.

471
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,140
It'll probably have, like, limited stuff where you'll swing it around to, like, do different

472
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,940
things, but it'll also be, like, if you're gonna be using the Force, like, if you push

473
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:11,980
the remote and uncheck out, it'll be, like, doing the Force push or, you know, stuff like

474
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,980
that.

475
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,980
It's very limited.

476
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:20,640
All right, well, I'll still, you know, check it out, and hopefully you do get to do some

477
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,660
Wii lightsaber, but, you know, just because it doesn't have the lightsaber doesn't necessarily

478
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,660
mean it'll be a bad game.

479
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,900
I mean, a lot of people seem to enjoy the Lego Star Wars thing, which had really nothing

480
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,980
to do with motion controls, so you can still have, there's still a lot of good games to

481
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:38,220
be cranked out of the Star Wars franchise, and I'm sure they'll try for years and years

482
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,700
and years to come.

483
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:45,220
Well, I've made a mention of this earlier that I'm going to be getting one myself, but

484
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:49,420
there you've confirmed that the Wii Zapper's gonna be out in Europe this year, though there's

485
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:55,220
not a date on it yet, and the US will be out on the 19th of November, but the games that

486
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,900
we'll work with so far is Link's Crossbow Training that's coming out, sort of like a

487
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,540
shooting gallery type of game.

488
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:07,100
There's Medal of Honor Heroes 2, Ghost Squad.

489
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,900
I'm so excited about Ghost Squad coming out, by the way, because it's one of my favorite

490
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:16,020
arcade games, and Resident Evil the Umbrella Chronicles, so it'll use the Zapper.

491
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,740
Dan was saying at their conference that they weren't calling it a light gun.

492
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:25,700
They were calling it a pointing system, a pointer system.

493
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,620
I thought that was funny.

494
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,620
Interesting.

495
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:34,620
Also sort of related, too, is that he did see the new gun con that looks like the gun

496
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,340
con 2 and has a trigger switch.

497
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,340
Over time crisis?

498
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,340
Yeah.

499
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,340
Yeah.

500
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,900
And has a trigger switch on the side for a directional button.

501
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:47,940
Mr. DeBucket in chat says, it's not a gun, it's a blaster or a pointer.

502
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,940
You know, but it ain't a bazooka.

503
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,260
That thing is still as awesome as the Saturn Enforcer.

504
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,780
Or the Super Scope 6, honestly.

505
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,980
I mean, it was a fucking bazooka.

506
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,300
You can't get any cooler than that.

507
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,300
You really can't.

508
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,180
I'm telling you, man, that thing is so useless.

509
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,300
The miniser, Rob.

510
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,300
The miniser.

511
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,300
Or the activator.

512
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,300
No.

513
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,300
I have an activator.

514
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,300
I'm sorry.

515
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,460
I got it for nine bucks.

516
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,220
I remember when Loki bought an activator.

517
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,160
Why the hell did you buy an activator?

518
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,140
You bought an activator on eBay for something.

519
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,140
It was for your cabinet.

520
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,140
It was for the cabinet.

521
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,140
You poured money.

522
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,420
You were going to do the Para Para thing.

523
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,700
I was going to build a Para Para setup for the cabinet.

524
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:23,820
This is back when I was going to build one control panel for every single Bomani game.

525
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,980
And back when Para Para was cool.

526
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:35,220
I ended up throwing the activator stuff away because I got it for like ten bucks.

527
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:41,140
I did, however, and I still have them, I have the dream Para Para controller, which does

528
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:45,140
hook up to the PC via a converter.

529
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,380
So if I really want to.

530
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,540
And I remember we played the dream Para Para on the Dreamcast.

531
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:55,700
It's exactly the same as Para Para, except it has really crappy songs.

532
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,980
Son of Dad asks a good question.

533
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,780
Can Silent Hill Arcade be ported to the Wii with the Zapper?

534
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,780
Probably.

535
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,780
I hope so.

536
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,780
It'll be fun.

537
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,780
Don't you want to shoot Pyramid Head?

538
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,780
Yes.

539
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,780
With hearts?

540
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:09,060
I'd like to shoot him with death.

541
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,500
With death.

542
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,820
Cake or death?

543
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,180
Cake, please.

544
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,180
Death.

545
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,180
No, wait!

546
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,700
Ha ha, you said death first.

547
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,980
Actually since Dark Sakura brought up Resident Evil real fast, I wanted to say this because

548
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,760
I know it's not in the show world tonight, but did you guys know that a new Resident

549
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,300
Evil movie came out this week?

550
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,060
Yeah, I saw it.

551
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,860
Rice Princess called me last night wanting to know if I wanted to go see it and I was

552
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,780
like, no, I don't.

553
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,900
I never saw the second movie because I knew it would suck.

554
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,900
I liked the second one.

555
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,900
Did you?

556
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,900
Yes, I did.

557
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,900
Apparently the third one isn't bad.

558
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,140
It's better than the second one is what people are saying.

559
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,580
The second one had all the crap I wanted to see.

560
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,580
Really?

561
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,580
Being stuck in a city full of zombies.

562
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,820
I mean, hey, that was fantastic.

563
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,060
But the movie was number one at the box office this weekend.

564
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,700
It beat the Dane Cook movie.

565
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,700
And Jessica Alba.

566
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,700
Was it the Dane Cook movie?

567
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,700
Yes.

568
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,700
Yeah, but Dane Cook sucks, so.

569
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:59,940
And I think the movie has a 3% on Rotten Tomatoes and Resident Evil at least has like 10% I want

570
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,940
to say.

571
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,820
Okay, let's go see it this weekend, Rob.

572
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,260
I don't know if I want to.

573
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,260
Come on.

574
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,260
I'll pay.

575
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,260
There's serious...

576
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,260
Okay.

577
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,260
You can get dinner.

578
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,260
Here, if you'll pay.

579
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,700
If you want to do something better, Transformers just came into the IMAX.

580
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,700
Ooh.

581
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,660
I haven't seen 10 to 20 minutes of extra footage in there.

582
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,140
Let's go, Rob.

583
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,140
That I might have to go see.

584
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,140
I haven't seen that yet.

585
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,140
But I'm not paying for IMAX.

586
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,140
Okay, I'll pay for IMAX though.

587
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,780
That'll be fun.

588
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,180
One thing I was going to say, once again, commenting on the Wii Zapper, completely useless

589
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,180
piece of shit.

590
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,300
And you guys will all buy it because it has Zelda crossbow training.

591
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,380
You fucking sheep.

592
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,380
And we will prove on this show.

593
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,380
I'll buy it.

594
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,380
Yeah, you will buy it.

595
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:47,500
We will prove on this damn show that that piece of shit actually hinders your playing

596
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:52,300
versus helping you and that it is a complete useless pile of junk.

597
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,940
In fact, I think we should use Zelda's crossbow training as the game.

598
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,940
As the game.

599
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,940
All right.

600
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,140
So, yes, for those that forget, Loki and I made a bet.

601
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,140
What was it?

602
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,380
About 10 weeks ago on the show?

603
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:06,540
We made a bet when the Wii Zapper was first announced, Loki said the Zapper will not be

604
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,180
better than using the Wiimote.

605
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:12,460
So we made a bet that we're going to play a game and whoever can get the higher score

606
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:16,840
in the game, Loki will not use the Zapper, I will use the Zapper in a game that was intended

607
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,420
for the Zapper to be used, like Zelda crossbow training.

608
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:25,040
If Loki can get a higher score than me, then I will have to take his wife out for an evening

609
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,700
so that he can have the place to himself to play all the games that he wants.

610
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:33,540
However, if I win, then Loki has to go out on a date with me and it'll be videotaped

611
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:38,220
and chronicled for our listeners.

612
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,700
I'm really just doing it to get a free dinner.

613
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,140
There's nothing involved with that.

614
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,000
I'm not making him put out at the end of the date or anything.

615
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,900
That's taking it a little far, but it will be fun and it will be a free dinner.

616
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,040
Darktitsia says, YouTuber, it didn't happen.

617
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,540
Mikosynth says, I want Skye to win just because that would be freaking hilarious.

618
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,660
I think so, it'd be a good time.

619
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,660
Good times.

620
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,660
Absolutely.

621
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,500
All right, let's travel the globe and look at some release dates, things that are coming

622
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,500
out very soon.

623
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,900
Yes, starting in the US.

624
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:13,300
This is a big week, of course, with Halo 3 coming out in the 360.

625
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,380
All three versions on Tuesday.

626
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,140
Better start lining up on Monday because everybody else is going to...

627
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,700
You know what?

628
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,700
Seriously?

629
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,700
Why?

630
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,700
Why do you need to line up?

631
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,700
Can't you just go after work or school on Tuesday?

632
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,340
So you can be the first people in the world to play it.

633
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,340
Guess what?

634
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,340
You're not.

635
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,060
Three people on my friends list have already been playing it and we had it.

636
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,060
You know what?

637
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,980
You're not the first in the world, so just wait for Tuesday.

638
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,660
Do you really have to get it at midnight?

639
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,660
That's what I want.

640
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,740
I want to know how many people in our chat room are planning to run out at midnight tomorrow

641
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,220
and buy the game, and if so, why?

642
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,220
That's what I want to know.

643
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,220
Yeah.

644
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,220
Sorry.

645
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,180
Anyways, other games coming out this week, actually some that I'm looking forward to.

646
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:58,260
Jackass the Game on PlayStation 2 and PSP.

647
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,500
I've got to buy this game.

648
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,120
It just looks...

649
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,280
It's too much fun.

650
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,280
I would...

651
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,620
Well, you don't got to buy the game.

652
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,620
I have to buy the...

653
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:08,180
Well, yeah, I don't have to buy the game.

654
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,100
Anyways, other games coming out.

655
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:15,820
Also we have CSI Hard Evidence on Xbox 360.

656
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:21,740
Hot Wheels Beat That, which I'm sure is going to be an awesome game, on Xbox 360, PlayStation

657
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:25,300
2, and the Wii.

658
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:32,100
A small old game called Dance Dance Revolution Supernova 2 is going to be coming out on PlayStation

659
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,100
2.

660
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,100
Yes it is.

661
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,100
Where did that come from?

662
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,100
Yeah.

663
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,100
It's coming out next week.

664
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,100
Yeah.

665
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,100
Funny enough, they haven't...

666
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,100
Oh, battle things.

667
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,100
Yeah, I know.

668
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,100
I was like, oh, yeah, DDR.

669
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,100
I remember when I played that every day.

670
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,460
CSI Three Mentions of Murder on PlayStation 2.

671
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:52,900
My favorite title, or just name of a title, this week is Soul Nomad and the World Eaters

672
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,060
on PlayStation 2.

673
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,540
I saw the website for that.

674
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:01,520
It's by the people who did, crap, now I can't think of it.

675
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,180
It's a tactics game, though.

676
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,180
Nice.

677
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:08,340
I think they did Grimm and Gremor, if I remember correctly.

678
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:17,060
Or, let's see here, World Series of Poker 2008, and then, of course, on PlayStation

679
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:23,420
2, PlayStation 3, and the PSP NBA 08.

680
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:30,620
Let's see, Skates coming out on PlayStation 3, and let's see, on the Wii, you have Bratz

681
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:34,420
the movie, Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party.

682
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:37,060
Loki, why do you even bother reading that title, Bratz?

683
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:42,140
I mean, can you think of a single person who listens to this show who might purchase Bratz?

684
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,140
I don't know.

685
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,140
There's people that buy Hannah Montana games, so I have to mention everything.

686
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,140
Okay, you know what?

687
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,140
No.

688
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,140
I'm going to pose that question to our listeners.

689
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:52,380
I want to know if any of our listeners actually go out and purchase Bratz on the Wii.

690
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:57,500
If so, you have to send a picture, because emailing us just isn't good enough for something

691
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,500
of that caliber.

692
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,500
I actually want to see a picture.

693
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,500
Anyways...

694
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,980
I'm going to let Loki read those dates in the future.

695
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:07,260
Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party for the Wii is coming out this week as well.

696
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,260
Really?

697
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,260
Yes.

698
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,260
The bundle.

699
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:16,740
Let's see here, and then on the DS, we've got Math Play, which I'm sure is fun, and

700
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:23,180
it has to do with math, Race Driver Create and Race, Crayola Treasure Adventures...

701
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,820
Yay!

702
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:32,380
It's basically a bunch of crap, and I guess there are some spelling challenges and shit

703
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:38,140
game coming out on the DS and PSP.

704
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:42,260
I'm going to read some comments in chat real fast before we get to the next set of dates

705
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,780
here, because there's comments about the 360 midnight launch.

706
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,540
Remember I mentioned that a little bit ago?

707
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:51,700
SSJ100Matt says, ask the people who lined up for the new Harry Potter book.

708
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,900
Everyplace Imaginables sold it, why line up?

709
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,820
Because there were people that seriously took off work the next day to read the book all

710
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,820
damn day.

711
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:03,420
Like a lot of my friends.

712
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:07,300
Rama asks, so how many people are going to call out sick to play Halo 3?

713
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:11,940
Rob D says, I'd go if the crowds weren't all frat boys and racist 12 year olds.

714
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:19,360
I love what an employee of an unnamed store told a friend of mine and Dan's.

715
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:23,140
We have to call you and tell you that your reservation for Halo 3 is here, but you don't

716
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,380
have to come at midnight if you don't want to.

717
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:32,320
It'll be there the next day.

718
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:38,220
If you want to comment, chat.orangelaungeradio.com and you can say such things like DJ Morpheus

719
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,820
says, Rob is the Chris Crocker of internet radio.

720
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,820
You know what?

721
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,820
Fuck that guy.

722
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,820
Seriously.

723
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:46,360
That guy sucks.

724
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:51,220
I cannot believe he's famous for that stupid, all right, forget it.

725
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,220
Release dates.

726
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,220
Oh, is it my turn?

727
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,220
Yes.

728
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,220
Oh, whatever.

729
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,660
Oh yeah, Halo 3 on the 26.

730
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:58,660
Big whoop.

731
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,660
Ha, you get it.

732
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,660
Day later.

733
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,660
Oh yeah.

734
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:06,540
Yeah, but technically their day later is, no, it is later, isn't it?

735
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,540
Anyway.

736
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,540
They're always a day later.

737
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,700
Moving forward to the 28th.

738
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:17,500
We have a whole bunch of shit coming out.

739
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:22,500
Armed assault, Queen's Gambit on PC, Blazing Angels, Secret Missions of World War II on

740
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:29,020
PC, Company of Heroes, Opposing Fronts, Conan on some stuff, Crazy Taxi, Fair Wars, PSP,

741
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:35,260
Enemy Territory, Quake Wars, FIFA 08 on damn near everything, Grim Grimoire, Jam Sessions,

742
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:41,980
Juice 2, Hot Import Nights, King of Clubs, MotoGP 07, Ratatouille on damn near everything,

743
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,420
Sega Rally also on damn near everything.

744
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,020
Is that an official console, damn near everything?

745
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,020
Yes.

746
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,860
Stranglehold, it's like the GameX, Rob.

747
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:51,860
Stuntman Ignition.

748
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,540
Oh yeah, we got that, I think.

749
00:44:54,540 --> 00:45:02,100
Test Drive Unlimited, Xbox 360 Classics, and The Settlers Rise of an Empire.

750
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,100
Good times.

751
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,100
Yeah.

752
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,420
Moving over to Japan, checking out the release dates in Japan.

753
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,700
On the Wii, Bass Fishing Wii is coming out.

754
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,620
Now usually you go, you know, oh hooray, a fishing title on the Wii.

755
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:19,180
But I think the box art to this game is hilarious because they have like this random sexy girl

756
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:22,780
wearing a little camouflage vest going, hey, I just caught a fish.

757
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,940
I posted the link in chat so they can see.

758
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:30,200
But the little cover art for the game cracked me up, so Bass Fishing on the Wii is coming

759
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,200
out.

760
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,840
I don't think if it comes to America it'll have that box art.

761
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,980
My Sims is coming out on the Wii in Japan, the Japanese version.

762
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:41,180
Boku no, sorry, Boku to Sim Nomachi is what it's called over there.

763
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:46,300
On the PlayStation 3, The Elder Scrolls Oblivion finally comes out to the PlayStation 3 on

764
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:51,620
September 27th, along with Agarest Senki is coming out.

765
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:55,460
It's a compile game from them, and that's coming out on the PlayStation 3.

766
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,420
Looks to be a little strategy-based game.

767
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,620
Kind of looks like it has some RPG elements to me.

768
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,820
Actually, that battle kind of looks like an Eternal Sonata battle.

769
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:08,300
Hmm, a little tactical there in nature.

770
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:12,900
Fantasy Star Universe Ambition of the Illuminus comes out on the PlayStation 2, and when I

771
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,460
first read this I thought it said Fantasy Star Universe Abortion of the Illuminus, and

772
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:21,020
I was like, well, that's going to be a controversial game, but it's Ambition, Ambition.

773
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:23,160
We may be calling that once it comes out.

774
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:29,020
Some people called Fantasy Star Universe an abortion of a game, but it's not that bad.

775
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,580
I didn't think it was that bad.

776
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:37,140
PlayStation 2, Bleach Blade Battle 2nd, coming out on the PlayStation 2, because, you know,

777
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,740
you can't have enough Bleach.

778
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:41,660
A game is coming out on the DS, and this could be useful.

779
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,780
It's Bartender DS.

780
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:46,740
This is a game that teaches you how to mix drinks.

781
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:47,740
Fuck yeah!

782
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,620
That could actually be pretty handy.

783
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:52,420
Now that is making usefulness out of the DS.

784
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,420
Good job.

785
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,420
Props to those guys.

786
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:59,220
Namco Bandai is putting out another Tamagotchi game in Japan on the 27th for the DS.

787
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:04,980
Tamagotchi no Pucci Pucci Omiseki Mina San Q is coming out.

788
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,720
It's a strategy Tamagotchi game.

789
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,660
And then on the PSP, Yu-Gi-Oh!

790
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:15,780
Dual Monsters GX Tag Force 2, because you just can't get enough Yu-Gi-Oh!

791
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:16,780
Can you, Jamie?

792
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,500
Don't you love Yu-Gi-Oh?

793
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,500
Not in English.

794
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,740
But it looks like I'm trying to see, oh, it looks like another card battle game.

795
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:25,740
Surprise, surprise.

796
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,740
Yeah.

797
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,740
All right, that's it for release dates in Japan.

798
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:37,380
Anyways, so, Tokyo Game Show came out and, yeah, there's a whole bunch of news that I'm

799
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:41,540
totally, it was really shocking.

800
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:46,500
Of course, this can't be true because, you know, Sony's come out numerous times saying

801
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:52,780
that they have no plans on making the 6-axis rumble, but, oh, looky there, look, it's the

802
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:53,780
DualShock 3.

803
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:56,380
Oh my God, that's so surprising.

804
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,100
Didn't know that was going to happen.

805
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:03,300
Okay, let me put it this way, if there's ever a Sony rumor about, you know, them releasing

806
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:09,340
a new SKU, new features coming, et cetera, it's probably true, and that also goes for

807
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,340
Microsoft.

808
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,980
It's probably true.

809
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:16,420
So with that being said, the DualShock 3 is official.

810
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:21,580
It will feature the same wonderful technology that was in the DualShock 2, as well as now

811
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:24,380
you get, you know, the tilt stuff.

812
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:29,980
It's coming out in Japan in November, the rest of the world in spring of 2008.

813
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:34,620
There will be some interesting features for it, including, I believe, they're going to

814
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:38,940
be, you know, some of the newer games are going to be supporting it.

815
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:43,760
Also some of the older games that have already come out will be able to support rumble as

816
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:49,700
well through a patch system that they're going to implement, so, you know, Resistance, and

817
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:53,860
I think Ratchet and Clank is going to support it, stuff like that, so.

818
00:48:53,860 --> 00:49:00,300
That's cool, you know, with them saying that, you know, rumble is last gen stuff, that you

819
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,300
don't need it.

820
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,200
Boy, they sure know how to backpedal.

821
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,540
Of course, the entire chat room is bursting out in unison, GS68 says, STFU, Sony rumble

822
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:14,540
is so last gen, and Darktetsuya says, but rumble is so last gen, eye roll.

823
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:18,620
So what do you think finally caused them to release this controller that we all knew was

824
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,380
coming six months ago?

825
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,660
The whole immersion thing is what it is.

826
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,420
It's because they finally settled with them.

827
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,620
They're saying, oh no, we planned on doing stuff like this, you guys wanted it so we

828
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:29,620
made it happen.

829
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:34,120
You know, it's just spin, all it is is that they were going to have it originally, I mean,

830
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:38,660
why else would the controller shells have room for, I don't know, rumble motors?

831
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:42,820
Hmm, that's kind of odd seeing as they never planned on having them there in the first

832
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:43,820
place.

833
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:47,780
Oh wait, yes they did, but then they found out a company got pissed at them for stealing

834
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:51,820
their technology, so.

835
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:52,820
It's all a bunch of bullshit.

836
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:57,620
Now if I'm understanding this correctly, when the rumble comes out, is the six axis motion

837
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:58,620
thing going away?

838
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,620
No, it's going to still be there.

839
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:01,620
It's both.

840
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:02,620
It's both now.

841
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:03,620
Okay.

842
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:04,620
So the two can work together.

843
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:10,980
Oh yeah, there's special algorithms, they said, that they have, that can detect, can

844
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:15,320
detect that, you know, the controller shaking is not actually you tilting it in a different

845
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,320
direction or something.

846
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,500
What we've done is we've actually taken a race of little gnome people and put them inside

847
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:25,880
the controller, and they're speedily calculating all these different algorithms, making the

848
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,020
six axis and rumble technology work together in perfect harmony.

849
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:33,620
Wow, that's so amazing, because no other systems have been able to do that yet.

850
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:38,020
Oh wait, no, I take that back, the Wii has one that works just like that.

851
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:43,180
So the Wii is also powered by little gnome people, that's why they're so hard to get.

852
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:46,320
I mean, the gnome women are having to crank out babies left and right to make this.

853
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,940
The gnome people are going to go on strike.

854
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:51,860
No, hell no, we won't rumble.

855
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:58,020
Please, please, Nintendo and Sony, think of David the gnome, think of David the gnome.

856
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:01,700
Nintendo Media 64 says in our chatroom, Loki, so that means that Metal Gear Solid 4 and

857
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,900
Final Fantasy 13 will actually be on the 360, they are rumors.

858
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:09,660
No, I've no Final Fantasy 13, I don't think I'm taking a future story, sorry if I am,

859
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:15,860
but Final Fantasy 13, they definitively said at the end of the trailer, PlayStation 3 only,

860
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,820
when they showed it at Tokyo Game Show this week, so.

861
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:24,700
Yeah, what they did show on there is 2020, you can come play at my house, Rob.

862
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:31,540
Final Fantasy 13 in 2013, that's the whole, yeah, and it'll come out on 1.13 or something,

863
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,700
I don't know, forget it.

864
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:34,700
Anyhow.

865
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,700
Okay, forget what?

866
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:36,700
Yeah, exactly.

867
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:42,220
One other thing that is pretty cool about the PlayStation 3, I mean, hey, heckle Sony

868
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:45,420
all you want over some of the decisions they've made, but you've got to admit, this is pretty

869
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:49,860
cool, is the whole fact that you can have the PlayStation portable functionality with

870
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:53,980
the PlayStation 3, even though we've given it shit on the show before for the rear view

871
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:58,740
mirror and stuff, you know, things like they've done in Lair and some of their future enhancements

872
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,900
look pretty cool.

873
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:05,220
They actually, Kazurai was talking about it at the keynote that happened at Tokyo Game

874
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:11,220
Show, and they were using this game, Manichi Demo, and it introduces some new functionality,

875
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:16,220
it allows you to turn on and off your PlayStation 3 via remote play, okay, I mean, that doesn't

876
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:20,340
seem like a real big deal to me, but multiple PSP systems in the future will be able to

877
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:27,780
connect as a hub, and they're wanting to continue this and use this more often, so pretty cool.

878
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:31,420
I like this idea, except for the fact that, you know, you have to have a lot of friends

879
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,220
with PSPs for it to work, but they're coming out at a price.

880
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:36,100
In case you want to have three rear view mirrors.

881
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,620
Well, you need side mirrors.

882
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:44,100
Well, awesome, that must be a reason why they're buying their system, you know, rear view mirror.

883
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,100
Absolutely.

884
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,100
Awesome.

885
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:50,500
So, now all my friends have to go out and get a PSP so we can play these games.

886
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,500
I have a PSP.

887
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,500
Alright, cool.

888
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,500
You'll have to play.

889
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,540
Oh wait, I need a PlayStation 3 first.

890
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,540
I have a PS3.

891
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,540
Hey, I'm all set when it comes to rear view mirrors, Kaz.

892
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:02,140
You already have three PSPs, don't you?

893
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,140
Exactly.

894
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:05,260
I can see behind me perfectly.

895
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:08,420
Don't you have to have a certain firmware for that to work?

896
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,420
What are we talking about?

897
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:10,420
I could be running 3.7.

898
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,020
Hey, I want to do a story of you up, can I, can I, huh, huh, huh?

899
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,020
You may.

900
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:20,380
Well, recent reports thanks to Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII shows that the PSP sales

901
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:22,420
have surged in Japan.

902
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:31,340
In fact, it's gone up by six times on the previous week, and just to give a list of

903
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:37,580
how performance has been, and that's, again, for the last week.

904
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:51,220
PSP, 95,487 units, DS, 79,974, Wii, 26,181, PS2, 13,128, PS3, 13,121, the PS2's outselling

905
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:52,220
the PS3.

906
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:53,220
That's funny.

907
00:53:53,220 --> 00:54:01,740
Xbox 360, 1,243, Game Boy Advance, 836, and they're still selling Gamecubes at 97 units.

908
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:05,240
You know, it's pretty surprising, well, it's not surprising that they've sold so well,

909
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:09,260
because Crisis Core would only run on the PSP Slim, so if you wanted to play it, you

910
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:10,620
had to buy one.

911
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:11,620
Thank you, Sony.

912
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,620
Awesome.

913
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,060
Whoa, it won't run on an old PSP?

914
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,060
No, it won't.

915
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,060
Why?

916
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,060
Actually-

917
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:18,060
Because it's using the full clock.

918
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,060
It's-

919
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,060
Crisis Core?

920
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,060
Yeah.

921
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,060
It will.

922
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,060
I've seen side-by-side comparisons of the game.

923
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,060
Aha!

924
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:27,060
There's a video file out showing how Crisis Core runs on an old PSP and a new one.

925
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,060
That's right, I've seen that.

926
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,060
That's right, I've seen that.

927
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,060
I thought they said that it wouldn't.

928
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:35,000
It has a higher loading time, and although I thought it was funny that when they showed

929
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,620
the demo battles, both battles finished at the same time, even though the PSP one loaded

930
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:40,620
later.

931
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:43,620
Well, I thought that it supported- I thought they needed the, um, 3.6.

932
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,340
Well, you thought wrong!

933
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:48,100
Well, this is what I read, okay?

934
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,100
Whatever.

935
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:53,580
Well, side-by-side comparisons showed- but the thing that was good about that comparison

936
00:54:53,580 --> 00:55:00,500
is that it did show the, uh, better processing power in the, um, in the, uh, new PSPs, but

937
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:06,220
also just another comparison for, uh, software releases in relation to those hardware releases

938
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:13,020
is that, um, Crisis Core, um, of course, was the top seller, followed by, um, Pokemon Fushigi

939
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:21,020
no Dungeon, Tokino, uh, uh, Tonkentai, and also the, uh, Yami no Tonkentai, um, followed

940
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:27,660
by that Fate Tiger Coliseum, Another Centuries Episode 3, the final, Taeko no Satsujin DS,

941
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:33,380
Mario Party 8, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, Ring of Fates, Sengoku Musou 2, Mushoden,

942
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:36,980
and my housekeeping diary, so.

943
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:37,980
That was number 10.

944
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:38,980
Well, the women had to buy something.

945
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:39,980
For sales.

946
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:42,500
No, they were buying Pokemon.

947
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,700
I want Crisis Core, though.

948
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,180
I apologize to all our female listeners this week after today's episode.

949
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,180
You need to apologize to me, Rob.

950
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,180
I'm, you know-

951
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:51,780
You need to beg my forgiveness.

952
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:57,220
Dear Dark Sakura the Great and Terrible, I beg upon ye for forgiveness.

953
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:03,060
Buying Crisis Core, you know, would only encourage them to make games like Dirge of Service,

954
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,060
so.

955
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,060
I like Dirge of Cerberus.

956
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:07,620
Besides, I can't really play Crisis Core right now, it's all in Japanese.

957
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:08,620
Vincent Maycry.

958
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:09,620
Vincent's awesome.

959
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,140
But when it comes out in the US, we'll see.

960
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:14,060
I don't mind playing it in Japanese.

961
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:16,220
Next story, please.

962
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:23,380
Anyways, um, so, there's another game that's also gonna be coming out pretty soon in Japan,

963
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:29,020
if you know that game that we thought was free before, oh, but never fear, Sony's here

964
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,940
to take a shit on you.

965
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:41,060
Gran Turismo 5 Prologue has been priced in Japan for 4980 yen, and also it will be coming

966
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:48,700
out on Blu-ray as well for a total savings of about five bucks for 4500 yen.

967
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:54,460
I'm sorry, 4980 was the Blu-ray version, 4500 was the download.

968
00:56:54,460 --> 00:57:00,620
So yeah, you save five dollars downloading it straight to your PS3.

969
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:05,660
Now I know it's supposed to come with, I think, about 40 cars, and looks pretty nice, but

970
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:11,940
I mean, after all, you are buying pretty much a partial game, I guess, because it's technically

971
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:13,880
kind of like a demo.

972
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:20,040
So 40 bucks for a partially finished game, when you can wait probably a year and play

973
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:23,500
the full game for 60 bucks?

974
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:26,620
I don't know, do people like Gran Turismo 5 that much?

975
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:31,580
But if you're interested, it's coming out December 13th, in Japan, or if you have a

976
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:35,540
Japanese account, you can probably download it over here.

977
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,100
But not that you do that, because that's wrong.

978
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:42,820
Fuck no, I'm not gonna pay that, I'm not gonna pay like, what is the equivalent of like $43.10

979
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:44,460
for Gran Turismo 5?

980
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,820
I want the full game if I'm gonna be paying that kind of money.

981
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:51,020
Well, Loki, would you pay $69.99 for the Eye of Judgment?

982
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:55,620
Because the Eye of Judgment comes out soon, on October 23rd.

983
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:56,620
It looks funny.

984
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,620
For $69.99.

985
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:02,740
Now the good news is, that is the price of the game and the PlayStation Eye, which is

986
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:03,740
the peripheral.

987
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:07,740
Or as we call it here on the program, the Brown Eye of Judgment, that will come with

988
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:08,860
the PlayStation Brown Eye.

989
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:12,760
So if you want to get a Brown Eye for your PlayStation, you can get one on October 23rd

990
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,820
for $69.99.

991
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:19,840
You also get a little camera stand with it, but it's called, this is my favorite part,

992
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:22,540
the camera stand is called the Judgment Stand.

993
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:30,820
I'm sorry, I just think of like Judge Judy or something when I see the Judgment Stand.

994
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:31,820
Here come the Judge.

995
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:38,620
Booster, now here's the other thing, okay, there's battle maps that come with it, a starter

996
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:42,060
deck of cards comes with it, and an eight card booster pack.

997
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,620
Here's where things get interesting.

998
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:48,400
If you want more booster packs, they'll cost you $3.75 each.

999
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:53,780
You can also get one of five pre-constructed theme packs for $14.99.

1000
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,920
Now of course, Loki was wondering, well what the hell is going to stop me from making my

1001
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,060
own cards and using them to play online?

1002
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:00,060
Aha!

1003
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:03,020
Well, what's going to happen is that you're going to have to pre-register your decks with

1004
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:09,360
the game and you put in your serial numbers, I suppose, and then the software will randomly

1005
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:13,580
select what cards get drawn next, that way you can't stack the deck.

1006
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:14,580
That's stupid.

1007
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:17,700
Yeah, I can't, it's stupid.

1008
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:22,820
I'm sorry, you know, whereas, okay, maybe the PlayStation Brown Eye can have some future,

1009
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:28,860
you know, nobody's really done a decent camera, I mean how long did that Xbox 360 vision thing

1010
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:29,940
last?

1011
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:33,740
Like it didn't, like it fizzled the moment it hit, because it had, what did it have going

1012
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:34,740
for it?

1013
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:35,740
Totem Ball.

1014
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:36,740
And the fact that you can make your own gamer picks.

1015
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,860
Let me put it this way, it was as popular as the eye toy.

1016
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:39,860
Yeah.

1017
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:46,220
Seriously, cameras for systems, I think people just, they're like, ooh, that's kind of cool,

1018
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:48,580
and then, ehhh.

1019
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:56,700
Eye Toy squeezed out a little more life out of it, the Eye Toy squeezed a little more

1020
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:02,020
life out of it, but just because it had DDR probably in, you know, some of the Harry Potter

1021
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:03,860
games and things that kids were into.

1022
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:08,300
But the Brown Eye's going to need a lot more than the Brown Eye of Judgment to do well,

1023
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:09,300
I think.

1024
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:16,060
And that's just plain online and stuff, it says via cheating, pre-registering your decks.

1025
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:18,220
I mean, people are going to crack that so fast.

1026
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:20,100
Well cheat in person all you want.

1027
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:23,060
People are going to crack that shit so fast, it's not even funny.

1028
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:24,060
Why?

1029
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:28,140
Is this on, I ask the cracking and hacking community of the world out there, is this

1030
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:29,900
worth hacking?

1031
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:30,900
I mean.

1032
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:34,700
If you're going to spend $69 on the game, you're of course not going to, I bet you anything

1033
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:40,420
those booster packs and theme packs do not sell well, they're hoping that it takes over

1034
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:47,140
like Pokemon or Yugioh or Magic or anything like that, and just people are going crazy

1035
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:50,760
over the Eye of Judgment and sells tons of systems.

1036
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:54,560
They live in this dream world that does not exist, is what the problem is.

1037
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:59,600
I agree, however, when I hear about things like that whole SingStar thing will have the

1038
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:04,780
camera and you can upload your videos to like a YouTube type service, that sounds interesting.

1039
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:08,180
Yeah, it does sound interesting, and here's the other thing, the PlayStation 3 does support

1040
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:12,640
other cameras other than the PlayStation Eye, so if you have your own webcam that's USB,

1041
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:16,100
why the fuck are you spending money on the PlayStation Eye if you're just going to be

1042
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:23,560
using the video camera to upload, why, I don't know why, but uploading yourself singing badly

1043
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:26,840
to karaoke to put on this YouTube type thing.

1044
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:30,340
If you really need that much attention, you could probably set up your own webcam and

1045
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:35,480
put it on the real YouTube, and guess what, that will be free, and more people will probably

1046
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:36,480
see it.

1047
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,680
And you can be angsty about Britney Spears or something, and millions of people will

1048
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,680
view it.

1049
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:43,640
I just, I don't see the point.

1050
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:48,520
I mean, the PlayStation Eye of Judgment is as bad as I thought it was, so.

1051
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:52,120
Alright, well if you plan on purchasing the Eye of Judgment, we'd love to hear from you,

1052
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:53,120
mailbagorangeonstrader.com.

1053
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,220
I want to know why.

1054
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:58,520
If you're going to camp out at midnight to buy it, we especially want to hear from you.

1055
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,100
Why?

1056
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,360
That's just what I want to know why.

1057
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:05,240
I hope I get one for free, but I know I won't.

1058
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:08,240
Even if you get one for free, I think you should destroy it live on our program.

1059
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,320
They did show off the Eye of Judgment at their conference.

1060
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:14,560
Loki, Loki, Loki, if you get a brown Eye of Judgment for free, can we destroy it on the

1061
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:15,560
program?

1062
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:16,560
Sure.

1063
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,560
Hooray!

1064
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,560
Destroy destruction!

1065
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:19,560
Oh, I want the camera.

1066
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:20,560
We'll set something up outside.

1067
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:26,760
I want to play the game and then, like, in the middle of the game, set the thing on fire.

1068
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:30,720
Like, if you're playing someone online and then you're, like, dealing another card, they'll

1069
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,440
go, fuck this shit.

1070
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,440
Whoosh.

1071
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,440
We're totally going to do that.

1072
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:36,440
That'll be hilarious.

1073
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:37,440
We will totally do that.

1074
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,360
We'll set something up where we can start a small fire and it'll be safe, and we will

1075
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:45,840
set the PlayStation Eye on fire live during a match on the PlayStation Online store.

1076
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,200
I love this idea.

1077
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,340
I love it.

1078
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:50,320
I like anything that involves fire, Rob.

1079
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,320
All right.

1080
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,320
Awesome.

1081
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,320
Well, how about something that doesn't suck?

1082
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,320
All right.

1083
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,320
How about it?

1084
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:58,560
Metal Gear Solid 4, which is full of happy and joy.

1085
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:09,280
Kojima was saying that the Metal Gear Online experience is going to include a starter pack.

1086
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,640
Trying to look through this to see exactly what this starter pack is.

1087
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,480
It's like an online starter pack.

1088
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:19,200
I'm not seeing anything too specific, but maybe it's...

1089
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,640
This is like a glorious demo of the game.

1090
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:22,640
Yeah.

1091
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,640
Can I say this real quick while you're...

1092
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,640
Yeah.

1093
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:29,840
Oh, you can roll over enemies in a barrel.

1094
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:33,960
Somebody in chat sent me a message, this is hilarious, SSJ100Matt says, if the Eye of

1095
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:41,000
Judgment becomes a success, Loki must promise to dress up as Tingle.

1096
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,880
I will take that bet because I know...

1097
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:43,880
Whoa!

1098
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:44,880
He took the bet!

1099
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,280
Ladies and gentlemen, everybody must go out.

1100
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:53,520
You record, time stamp this, record it, put it in the archive, the bet has been taken.

1101
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:57,200
Okay, now we have to wait, hold on now, we need to set the parameters here now.

1102
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,600
You said a success.

1103
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:03,160
What do you mean exactly by a success because that's very general and very broad.

1104
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:06,440
It needs to sell like say a million units, how about that?

1105
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,440
Is that a success?

1106
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,440
Yes.

1107
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:11,760
If the Eye of Judgment sells a million units, Loki will dress up as Tingle.

1108
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,760
I will dress up as Tingle.

1109
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:19,040
I guarantee you, if that thing sells a million copies, which it will not.

1110
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,040
Wait, worldwide or domestic?

1111
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:23,660
You gotta be specific because the damn thing could take off in Japan.

1112
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:24,660
You never know.

1113
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:27,040
I will even, I'll go as far as saying worldwide.

1114
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,040
Holy shit!

1115
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,040
Holy shit!

1116
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,040
I don't think it will do anything.

1117
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,440
I don't know how many billion people in the world.

1118
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,160
That's like saying one in four people buys this thing that owns a Playstation 3 and there's

1119
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,220
no way that's going to happen.

1120
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:41,360
Suddenly everybody in chat has just preordered the Eye of Judgment.

1121
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,360
Go right ahead.

1122
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,520
Worldwide, I bet you anything that will not sell a million copies.

1123
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:49,800
Wait, we have to set a deadline here because a million copies could happen like eight years

1124
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:50,800
from now or something.

1125
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:51,800
Okay, six months after release.

1126
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:52,800
Six months, okay.

1127
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:53,800
That's six months after release.

1128
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:54,800
If it sells a million units...

1129
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,800
One million copies worldwide within six months.

1130
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,440
Alright, you got it.

1131
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:01,440
Don't forget chat room.

1132
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,740
Don't let him forget this.

1133
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:07,040
You are all witnesses and I will take many, many videos.

1134
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,040
Oh, goddamn.

1135
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:11,300
I'm even going to go out and buy the Eye of Judgment now just to destroy it and get us

1136
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:12,300
one step closer.

1137
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,300
You're dressing up as Tingle on YouTube.

1138
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,480
To Loki dressing up as YouTube.

1139
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:18,040
Dressing up as Tingle on the whole thing being put on YouTube.

1140
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,040
Here's the best part.

1141
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:25,960
If it sells a million units, Loki will be dressed up as Tingle burning on fire and no

1142
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,360
one will get it.

1143
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,160
Can you imagine our poor opponent?

1144
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:35,320
Okay, cosplayers who listen to the show will be sending you measurements.

1145
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,500
Here's the thing.

1146
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,920
We have to be playing Bobby Black Wolf when it happens and nobody tell them what's going

1147
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:45,240
to happen because Bobby was your first friend on the PlayStation 3, so nobody tell Black

1148
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,800
Wolf what we're up to.

1149
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:47,800
Is he going to buy that?

1150
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,800
But he'll be the one.

1151
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:49,800
I don't know.

1152
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,040
We'll send him a copy just to make this happen, okay?

1153
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,520
How about to go back to Metal Gear Solid 4?

1154
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,520
I'm sorry, yes.

1155
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:56,520
I'm still cracking up.

1156
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:59,200
They're basically saying that some of the gameplay that's going to be involved in that

1157
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:03,960
little demo was like it was saying rolling over enemies with a barrel and then shooting

1158
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,680
people into the air with a cannon.

1159
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:07,680
That's fun.

1160
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,680
Yeah.

1161
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:11,160
Is he going to do those moves like he does in Super Smash Brothers where he comes up

1162
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:15,600
behind somebody and looks like he's about to, you know, ass rape them?

1163
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:16,600
He does that in all the other games.

1164
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:17,600
Why not?

1165
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,600
Alright.

1166
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,600
Sounds like fun.

1167
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,600
Anyways.

1168
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:21,600
Sorry.

1169
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,200
I had too good of a laugh.

1170
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:29,320
In case you don't get enough of browsing the PlayStation 3 store because, you know, there's

1171
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:35,540
a whole lot to look at on there, you will now also have the ability to browse the store

1172
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:37,800
on the PC soon.

1173
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:48,440
So, you'll be able to purchase PSP content without using the PS3 and also, I think that's

1174
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:54,440
all it's being used for right now is basically PSP content because I guess a lot of people,

1175
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:59,560
you know, don't have a PS3 so if they want to download those, really, a lot of people

1176
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:00,560
don't have a PlayStation 3.

1177
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:01,560
Yeah.

1178
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,560
I know.

1179
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,560
It's surprising.

1180
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,640
If they want to download those, you know, PS1 games, now they can do that.

1181
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:06,640
So, hooray!

1182
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:12,200
Well, the thing that got everybody excited about a PlayStation 3 earlier this year was

1183
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:16,960
PlayStation Home and if you were hoping to play PlayStation Home this year, you better

1184
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:20,960
hope you're in the beta because otherwise, you're not playing it until spring of 2008.

1185
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,240
Oh, something delayed on the PlayStation 3.

1186
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,240
I know.

1187
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,240
Who would have thunk it?

1188
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:26,240
Really?

1189
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,960
This bombshell was announced by Kazurai during the Tokyo Game Show press conference.

1190
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,200
You want to know something else that was delayed?

1191
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,960
Seriously, everything that comes out on the PlayStation 3 has been delayed lately.

1192
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:40,280
I mean, like, Skate came out a couple weeks later, was it Stunt Magnition came out almost

1193
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:44,580
a month later, Stranglehold's been delayed again to the end of October now.

1194
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:48,280
Which just goes to show the PlayStation 3 should have waited before it released.

1195
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:50,080
But anyway, that's old news now.

1196
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,960
It should have released this year.

1197
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:56,120
But for guys of twos coming out, it'll go a month later?

1198
01:07:56,120 --> 01:08:00,680
You know, here's the thing though, despite all the shit I'm talking about it, if it's

1199
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:03,320
that awesome, maybe it'll be worth the wait.

1200
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:09,360
You know, I'd rather they do release it bug-free or with as few bugs as possible and just really

1201
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:13,940
awesome and the killer app to have for the PlayStation rather than them rush it to make

1202
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:14,940
it for this year.

1203
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:15,940
Right?

1204
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:20,280
They'll eventually decide to charge for it once, you know, it's been so long.

1205
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,740
It might be worth it.

1206
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:23,320
That's a big might.

1207
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:24,320
Big might.

1208
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:25,320
But it might be worth it.

1209
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,320
It has potential.

1210
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:27,640
But we'll see.

1211
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:32,120
Meanwhile, I still have no reason to get a PlayStation 3 until Final Fantasy 13 comes

1212
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,260
out.

1213
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:36,580
So that's all I have to say on PlayStation Home.

1214
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:37,580
Being delayed.

1215
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:43,180
Well, for those who are keeping up with some of the news out of Togo Game Show, there is

1216
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:49,280
a new Kingdom Hearts, well, more I would say addition to the Kingdom Hearts franchise to

1217
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:53,900
be out on DS, PSP, and mobile phones.

1218
01:08:53,900 --> 01:09:00,240
There is going to be Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep for the PSP.

1219
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:04,720
It's a single player RPG like the PS2 one.

1220
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:13,640
Kingdom Hearts 3, 58 slash 2 days for the DS, which is a 3D game with Roxas.

1221
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:17,000
And it also will have a four-way multiplayer mode.

1222
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:22,160
And the last one is Kingdom Hearts Coded that is on mobile phones.

1223
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,560
Coded sounds actually pretty cool.

1224
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:27,880
It's like the original Kingdom Hearts game, but you can almost like edit the worlds or

1225
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,240
something as you're playing through it.

1226
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,640
It's like the Matrix and Kingdom Hearts together.

1227
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,920
That actually though, after playing Kingdom Hearts 2, at least from the beginning of it

1228
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:40,440
makes perfect sense if it's like set in, you know, I don't want to spoil it for anyone,

1229
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,360
but if it's set like in dude's computer.

1230
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:43,360
Hmm.

1231
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:45,640
Remember with Roxas and all that.

1232
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,120
I never beat Kingdom Hearts 2.

1233
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,120
But you did play it from the beginning, right?

1234
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1235
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,120
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1236
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,120
So you know what I'm talking about.

1237
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,120
Yeah, I do.

1238
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,120
I do.

1239
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,120
I'm looking forward to the games.

1240
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,120
I'll check them out.

1241
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,120
I mean, hopefully they're better than Chain of Memories.

1242
01:09:56,120 --> 01:10:00,560
But as long as the Disney stuff stays intact, because that's the one thing that always worries

1243
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,560
me.

1244
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:04,280
It worried me about that Final Mix trailer or whatever it was at the end of Kingdom Hearts

1245
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,280
2.

1246
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,380
Like it was very, very not Disney related.

1247
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:10,000
And to me, that's a big charm of the series.

1248
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,040
You know, come on, Tron World was like the awesomest part of Kingdom Hearts 2.

1249
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:21,940
So as long as the games aren't totally deviating from the Disney stuff, I think it'll be okay.

1250
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:25,080
It's very interesting that everything's going handheld, especially with Squeenix between

1251
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,560
this and Dragon Quest IX.

1252
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,080
I'd be surprised if Final Fantasy XIV wasn't for the DS.

1253
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,080
We'll see.

1254
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:36,280
Well, one good thing we can say about the PlayStation 3 is that it has really helped

1255
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:37,720
the Folding at Home project.

1256
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:45,200
In fact, they have made the milestone achievement of reaching one petroflop.

1257
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:50,040
That's one quadrillion floating point operations per second.

1258
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:57,200
And basically, it would take everyone in the world 75,000 calculations in a second to achieve

1259
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,640
a similar result.

1260
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:03,460
So that's pretty awesome.

1261
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,360
But have they found the cure for cancer yet?

1262
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,360
No.

1263
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,360
So what good is a petroflop?

1264
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,360
If the program has...

1265
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,360
No, I'm just kidding.

1266
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,360
I think it's a fun little project.

1267
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:12,560
I like those distributed things.

1268
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,480
You know, there's actually an OL Army for Folding at Home, and I tried running it on

1269
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:19,920
my computer for a while, but it conflicts with World of Warcraft.

1270
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,800
Like you can't run them both at the same time.

1271
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:22,800
Priorities, Rob.

1272
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,760
World of Warcraft is clearly more important than cancer.

1273
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,760
Absolutely.

1274
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:33,000
Going to comments from chat, they're a little bit delayed, so sometimes we report on the

1275
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
last story.

1276
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,520
TheRobD says, Skye, none of the Kingdom Hearts 2 stuff had Disney stuff in there either,

1277
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:40,600
so Kingdom Hearts will have Disney.

1278
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:43,960
And WonderDocHerald says, singing along with the Little Mermaid was the best part of Kingdom

1279
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:44,960
Hearts 2.

1280
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,820
Not Tron, but the Little Mermaid.

1281
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:51,820
This part sucks because the songs were awful, but, the original songs, but they were even

1282
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:55,080
worse in Japanese.

1283
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,240
But the Little Mermaid has awesome music.

1284
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:00,100
Well, the songs that were from the Little Mermaid were good, but the ones that they

1285
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:02,240
made up for the game sucked ass.

1286
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,120
The Japanese ones were pretty.

1287
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:08,720
Yeah, but the songs were actually worse in Japanese, including the originals.

1288
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:12,120
And TheRobD just wanted to clarify, he meant the trailers.

1289
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:16,040
Well yeah, I got that, but hopefully the listeners did too.

1290
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:20,600
And Ghost in our chat room says, World of Warcraft causes cancer.

1291
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:26,040
If you're smoking and playing WoW at the same time, which I've seen people do, it just might.

1292
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,360
And drinking.

1293
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:30,840
Then you're going to have all sorts of problems.

1294
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:37,000
Well, the MotorStorm developers are not going to have a problem making money anymore, because

1295
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,120
they just got bought from Sony.

1296
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:44,180
Sony bought Evolution Studios, and it's a subsidiary of BigBig Studios.

1297
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:49,000
They made Pursuit Force, but of course Evolution Studios were the makers of MotorStorm, and

1298
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,880
lots of Sony fans are very happy with the game MotorStorm, and Sony's very happy with

1299
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,000
it too.

1300
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,400
Evolution has also unveiled that since they've been purchased, they've also been given the

1301
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,120
go-ahead to make MotorStorm 2.

1302
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:05,680
Which, as a side note, Nintendo, make Excite Truck 2.

1303
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:06,680
You want them to make it?

1304
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:07,680
My wife demands it.

1305
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,680
Excite Truck 2?

1306
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,140
Excite Truck 2.

1307
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:11,140
Or Excite something else.

1308
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:14,680
So it could be like Excite Boat, I don't know.

1309
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:15,680
No.

1310
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:16,760
That won't work.

1311
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:19,800
We do not need another Hydro Thunder.

1312
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:24,840
Well, when I think of what a cool...how about Cobra Triangle on the Wii?

1313
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:25,840
That game was awesome.

1314
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,840
I played that game.

1315
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:27,840
Cobra Triangle was so awful.

1316
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:28,840
It was so awful.

1317
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,840
Rad.

1318
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:30,840
Shut up!

1319
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,920
Cobra Triangle was like RC Pro-Am mixed with Gradius in boats.

1320
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,560
How is that a bad thing, I ask you?

1321
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:36,560
I don't know.

1322
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,600
This is pretty bad.

1323
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:42,880
By the way, Big Big Studios is already making Pursuit Force Extreme Justice.

1324
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:43,880
That should be fun.

1325
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:44,880
That should be fun.

1326
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:45,880
That should be fun.

1327
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:46,880
Next week or two.

1328
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:47,880
Yeah.

1329
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:48,880
Very cool.

1330
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,120
Well, congrats, Sony, on your marriage with these new companies.

1331
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:53,120
Congrats to Dark Sakura.

1332
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,600
Let the humping start.

1333
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:59,240
Congrats to Dark Sakura for finding yet another website to share with our listeners tonight.

1334
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:03,240
And this is the next to the last website of the week segment.

1335
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,240
Can you believe it?

1336
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,240
I know.

1337
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:11,120
I should say next week will be Dark Sakura's final website of the week because in the next

1338
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:14,520
series of episodes, starting with 250, she's going to be doing the classic game of the

1339
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:15,520
week.

1340
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,520
Yep.

1341
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,520
Which will be fun.

1342
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,520
So until then, though, she surfs the internet up and down, finding her last few websites

1343
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:21,600
to share with you.

1344
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,120
She's got one for you this week.

1345
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:26,720
Take it away, Miss Dark Sakura.

1346
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:31,020
The website of the week is actually one given to me by Sauce.

1347
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:32,020
It's retrojunk.com.

1348
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:33,020
R-E-T-R-O-J-U-N-E.

1349
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:34,020
Retrojunk.com.

1350
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:40,400
And this site is the best ever, ever.

1351
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:45,640
You have everything from old TV show intros to commercials, including video game commercials.

1352
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:51,720
Oh my God, Rob, I found out that a game that I love that was a PC game was actually on

1353
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:55,640
the Turbo Duo and now I have to find it even though it's 30 bucks on eBay.

1354
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:56,640
Dang.

1355
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:57,640
What game was that?

1356
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:58,640
Loom.

1357
01:14:58,640 --> 01:14:59,640
Loom is rad.

1358
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:00,640
I love Loom.

1359
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:01,640
Good choice.

1360
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:06,840
But there's, in fact, on their main page, I actually have an article about the Sega

1361
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:10,560
Master System, which I don't know if anyone knows, the Sega Master System was actually

1362
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:15,440
still going pretty strong in Brazil for a very long time with a lot of games that came

1363
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:22,280
out on 16-bit and later coming out over there on this 8-bit system.

1364
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,280
Lots of really cool stuff.

1365
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:30,480
I mean, just some of the TV intros listed on the main page is Danger Mouse and Voltron

1366
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,280
Hunter, Robocop.

1367
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:38,320
The commercials listed are old Nickelodeon commercials from 1982.

1368
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,320
That's awesome.

1369
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,320
Private Benjamin.

1370
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:43,960
And I'm sure YouTube just makes this shit even better now because everything's on YouTube

1371
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:44,960
now.

1372
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:48,600
Actually, all of this stuff, from what I understand, I don't think these are links out of YouTube

1373
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,120
but hosted on their own thing and all the...

1374
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,120
Oh, cool.

1375
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,880
As much of the stuff on there is actually pretty damn good quality.

1376
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:54,880
Nice.

1377
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,620
One thing that I was actually watching the Voltron went, oh my God, there's an article

1378
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:02,200
on here that's 80s movies you hate to love and it's got a picture of Shona from The Last

1379
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,200
Dragon.

1380
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,200
Shona.

1381
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,200
Who's the master?

1382
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,200
Shona.

1383
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:08,200
Yep.

1384
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:12,640
And some of the trailers on here is like The Brave Little Toaster and King Kong versus

1385
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,640
Godzilla.

1386
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:14,640
Wow.

1387
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:21,040
This is pretty cool and it has stuff dating back to the 60s, 70s, 80s, I think 60s but

1388
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:27,680
definitely the 70s, 80s, and 90s and lots of just really awesome retro stuff.

1389
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:28,680
Pretty fun.

1390
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:34,680
What I was trying to mention is that I went back to watch the Voltron one and it actually

1391
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:38,040
had the Go Lion intro and outro on it.

1392
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,240
A lot of the chat room seems...

1393
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:40,840
And David the Gnome, Logie.

1394
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:44,520
A lot of the chat room gives your website of the week their seal of approval.

1395
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,160
I'll be linking this in the chat room.

1396
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:50,400
Also, if anyone is curious, there also is a forum on here.

1397
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:54,120
It looks like they are talking about, oh, do you remember this?

1398
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,040
Do you want to see this?

1399
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,400
I'm trying to remember the name of this show.

1400
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,400
That type of thing.

1401
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,400
And there is one on here.

1402
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,480
This is which video game songs made you tear up.

1403
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,480
Aww.

1404
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:06,240
I had one that made me cry.

1405
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:07,240
What's that?

1406
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:08,240
It was Eyes On Me.

1407
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,240
Aww.

1408
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,240
Final Fantasy VIII.

1409
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:11,240
Whimp.

1410
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:12,240
Just kidding.

1411
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:13,240
I'm a girl.

1412
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,240
I'm allowed.

1413
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:15,240
No, I was getting...

1414
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,240
To bite my ass, Rob.

1415
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:17,440
I was getting a little choked up at Eternal Sonata.

1416
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,200
I didn't cry but I was getting a little choked up.

1417
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,200
I was getting va-clempt.

1418
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,200
Eternal Sonata...

1419
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,200
Talk amongst yourselves.

1420
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:25,360
Eternal Sonata made me a little va-clempt.

1421
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,360
Eternal Sonata.

1422
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:29,160
Neither Eternal nor Sonata.

1423
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,160
Disgust.

1424
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,160
555-4444.

1425
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:32,160
Anyhow.

1426
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:33,160
Yeah.

1427
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:38,600
Loki, please save this program.

1428
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,200
What is Africa?

1429
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:46,560
Sure, we know it's a continent in the world, but really, what is Africa the game?

1430
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:52,960
Well, it is a Pokemon Snap type of Jungle Safari game where you drive around and you

1431
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,280
take pictures of wildlife.

1432
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:55,280
That's awesome!

1433
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,280
Africa.

1434
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,560
No, I totally want to play that.

1435
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,280
So it's Africa Snap?

1436
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:01,280
Apparently, yeah.

1437
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,280
Rad!

1438
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:03,280
No, I totally...

1439
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:07,920
The only, only way I will play this game, and goddamn it, this better be possible, and

1440
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:12,760
I know it's won't be because they're going to pussy out, is if I can't drive my Jeep

1441
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:19,560
all over the savanna, destroying wildlife as it rolls underneath my tires.

1442
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:24,080
That is the only way I will play this game.

1443
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,960
They're going to put the fucking things on a track.

1444
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:26,960
You know it.

1445
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:27,960
Just like in Pokemon Snap.

1446
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:30,960
Because you would have tried to run over all the Pokemon, too.

1447
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:31,960
Yes.

1448
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:35,560
I'm totally going to play this game.

1449
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:38,800
I fished out money for the Cardcaptor Sakura game just because I thought it was like Pokemon

1450
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:39,800
Snap.

1451
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,440
That, and I wanted a clock and a plate.

1452
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,700
Pokemon Snap is fucking rad.

1453
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:44,400
It's like one of the most underrated games in my opinion.

1454
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,360
The Cardcaptor Sakura game, however, is not.

1455
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:50,120
But it comes with a clock and a plate, a knife, a fork, spoon, and...

1456
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,920
Does it have a little wand you can wave?

1457
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:53,920
No, and a pillowcase.

1458
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:57,200
It was on Dreamcast.

1459
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:03,160
Rama says the game should be like Jumbo Safari, and I agree, because Jumbo Safari is awesome.

1460
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:04,880
Let's see.

1461
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:09,040
Tiger Claw says, I'm more curious how the AI in the game is like.

1462
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:11,600
Like if you see a pride of lion, will it show them getting it on?

1463
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,600
Of course, mine doesn't...

1464
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,320
Well, it shows them eating something.

1465
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,000
I want to see blood in this game.

1466
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Eating smaller animals.

1467
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,480
I want M-rated Africa.

1468
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:26,560
We want monkeys flinging poo, lions doing it, and lots of carnivorous death.

1469
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:31,160
The Rob D. says, is Debbie Downer today saying, I don't think Africa is going to be a sandbox

1470
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:32,160
GTA game.

1471
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:36,400
I don't know why they're like making this out to be like a big game for the Playstation

1472
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,400
3.

1473
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,200
It's just like, it's going to be yet another disappointment.

1474
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:44,280
Yet another average game where it's like, look, it's the most realistic African safari

1475
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,280
ever!

1476
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,020
And then people will be like, so?

1477
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:48,520
We need people to actually get shot though.

1478
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:52,160
I'm not buying your fucking $600 system for an African safari.

1479
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,160
Fuck you.

1480
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:56,320
Mr. DeBucket says, Africa is a former Hot Shots Golf 5 minigame.

1481
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,440
You used to shoot gold balls at the animal.

1482
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,400
That must be weird.

1483
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:06,080
Someone, uh, GS68 was bringing up, uh, Let's Go Jungle, a rail shooter where you shoot

1484
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,080
the wildlife.

1485
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:12,240
If you want to join in the fun, chat.orangelandrager.com where we do take live on Sunday nights.

1486
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,280
I did not want to kill the animals.

1487
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:17,200
I wanted to see the animals killing other animals.

1488
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:18,200
That's right.

1489
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:21,320
Like I said, carnivorous death.

1490
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:25,760
They need, the monkeys need to be out, you know, picking each other's fleas and eating

1491
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,920
them.

1492
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:32,760
And the, all the animals need to be out doing it and giving birth and eating other animals.

1493
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:33,760
While I plan on...

1494
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:34,920
And they need evil giraffes.

1495
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:36,880
Here's the perfect way to derail the show.

1496
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,440
Screw Africa.

1497
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:43,520
It's all about laser cats to the game for Playstation 3.

1498
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,880
Where is my laser cats next gen game?

1499
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:51,480
I, I, can you, I mean, this lolcats thing on the internet, you know, the I can ass cheeseburgers

1500
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:54,680
of the world and all that stuff, the lolcats, has really become this little phenomenon.

1501
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:57,240
How come the video game industry is not cashing in on the lolcats?

1502
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:58,240
Oh, don't worry.

1503
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,240
They're a little bit behind.

1504
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:02,400
I mean, after all, they're making them with that stupid crazy frog racer thing.

1505
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:07,160
Well, I feel like Space Giraffe was the closest thing I got to a lolcats game because some

1506
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:09,120
of the comments it would make was like lolcats.

1507
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:12,240
I want a lolcats game.

1508
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:14,560
Mr. DeBucket says we need a ceiling cat game.

1509
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:15,560
Winner!

1510
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:16,560
It's a ceiling cat game.

1511
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:22,560
But, but, if you've been on cat macros on LiveJournal lately, it's all nothing but fucking

1512
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,880
ceiling cat lately.

1513
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:32,360
Everyone is picking any word that ends in eight and making a ceiling cat macro to it.

1514
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:36,360
Like ceiling cat is watching you masticate or fornicate or abbreviate.

1515
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:41,040
But my favorite one, someone, two people did this, they did one with Daleks and it says

1516
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,720
ceiling cat is watching you exterminate.

1517
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:47,000
That was great.

1518
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,500
There's one with Bill O'Reilly, ceiling cat is watching you bloviate.

1519
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:54,580
Um, let's see where's, there was one that was like, there were some of the older ones,

1520
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:56,760
one of these was like a marathon post.

1521
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:57,760
Yeah.

1522
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,260
It had like everything.

1523
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:03,720
And one of them is ceiling cat is watching you look for words that end in eight.

1524
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:08,200
Ceiling cat is watching you cogigate, ceiling cat is watching you regurgitate.

1525
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:11,880
Ceiling cat is watching you vegetate, ceiling cat is watching you spin a plate.

1526
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:14,280
Sealing Cat is watching you precipitate.

1527
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:17,160
Sealing Cat is watching you perm- permutate.

1528
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,720
Sealing Cat is watching you oblivious.

1529
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:22,320
With Harry Potter reference there, Sealing Cat is watching you percolate at a Starbucks

1530
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,320
there.

1531
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:25,720
Sealing Cat is watching you animate with The Simpsons.

1532
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:28,440
This is my favorite, the little truck.

1533
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,640
Sealing Cat is watching you compensate.

1534
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:35,080
Anyway, I'll link that in chat, because I'm sure the podcast answers are like.

1535
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,440
I like Sealing Cat is doing a figure eight.

1536
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:38,280
Dude, what the hell did I sign up for?

1537
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,300
Yeah, and Wunderdog Harold is right on.

1538
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:46,380
says it's like green eggs and ham for a new generation can you imagine that is

1539
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:51,940
untapped profit right there what the sues series no to make like children's

1540
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:57,500
books like with like internet with Lord yeah you know like ceiling cat you know

1541
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:00,580
the book for children you know could have like a whole thing to go along with

1542
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:10,380
it ceiling cat is watching this show suck no I didn't end at eight sorry well

1543
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:14,620
what can always what can save a show from going downhill is a good old story

1544
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:21,580
that relates to porn or in this sense erotic miss in World of Warcraft that's

1545
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:27,380
right an erotic role-playing guild that was spanned across two realms has been

1546
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:32,980
disabled by blizzard blizzard forcibly disbanded the guild but of course they

1547
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:37,460
just went and made it under a new name the guild abhorrent taboo is a horrid

1548
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:43,300
side RP guild on Ravenholtz a Ravenholt which is almost the name of the server I

1549
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:49,660
play on Ravencrest it had an alliance chapter on Blackwater Raiders here was

1550
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:54,380
their welcome message on their forums quote role-playing is legal even if you

1551
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:57,140
are role-playing something that wouldn't be considered deplorable and highly

1552
01:23:57,140 --> 01:24:00,580
illegal in real life it's still just role-playing it isn't subject to any

1553
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:04,460
form of disciplinary action negative publicity is still publicity make a dig

1554
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:07,700
or website about how sick we are reporters to perverted justice all it

1555
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:11,700
does is bring in more members in fact the dig guy on Ravenholt made us made

1556
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:15,460
about us was so effective several people signed up for a while just to be in our

1557
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:18,420
guild the bottom line is we're allowed to do what we want on any server we

1558
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:22,860
please and no one can do anything about it and those types of things by the way

1559
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:29,780
would be extreme sexual situations meaning sometimes with folks that are

1560
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:34,980
under 18 blah blah blah cetera cetera use your imagination here yeah but it's

1561
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:40,620
all in game it's all fake anyways so are you saying it's okay it's all in game

1562
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:43,820
they're not going out and actually having sex with like children or

1563
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:48,100
something like that unless if they are then that's you know wrong but it's all

1564
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:54,740
in game I mean let let them end up on an episode of like you know was it a date

1565
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:59,180
line or something like that yeah you know I'm kind of torn on this is that

1566
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:03,660
you know I do believe censorship is wrong at the same time there's probably

1567
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:06,860
some pretty I mean there might be some normal people that are trying to you

1568
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:09,180
know this gives a bad name to role players everywhere is what it really

1569
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:13,620
does but you know on the same time blizzard has the right to do whatever

1570
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:18,820
they want with their servers all they need to do is go second life I mean come

1571
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:24,740
on I mean way back away worse than what we're doing to which mr. de bucket says

1572
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:28,700
pedo bear is watching you play World of Warcraft I guess that's a play on

1573
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:34,420
ceiling cat I have no idea huh no pet a bear you don't get it and yeah yeah I

1574
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:38,820
get it I guess it's been going on for a while is that I you know I never noticed

1575
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:42,460
these guys in game but folks have been petitioning customer service and posting

1576
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:46,500
in the suggestion forms wanting people to do stuff about this extreme role play

1577
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:51,980
and finally this guild was forcibly disbanded and we'll see if there's a

1578
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:56,100
comment from blizzard here oh yes quote this matter is not one blizzard takes

1579
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:59,820
likely in air lightly in any way shape or form we do not wish to have this

1580
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:03,460
topic continue circulation let it finally be said that we appreciate those

1581
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:06,460
of you who brought this particular issue to our attention and it will continue to

1582
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:09,340
follow up with this matter in the future to ensure the safety of all parties is

1583
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:13,820
concerned by the way the guild is reformed their new name is vile and a

1584
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:20,140
FEMA anathema anathema I mean what does that even mean I don't know and it means

1585
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:28,860

1588
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:44,900
Zaku says Loki I'm sorry but speaking in a sexually suggestive manner to a minor

1589
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:51,060
is not protected speech by the way what dictionary definition a thing that is

1590
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:57,180
detested or loathed cursed or consigned to damnation or destruction at least they

1591
01:26:57,180 --> 01:27:02,500
have a sense of humor about it interesting well you know what I only

1592
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:05,500
blame the parents because they should be watching them what their kids are doing

1593
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:09,740
amen to that hmm good point all right I don't want to talk about this while

1596
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:26,660
nerf wireless controller I some I think it's actually dark test yeah I think

1597
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:30,640
posted a link in live journal about this and I want one so I can throw my

1598
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:33,860
controller at the screen and not break my spleen in my TV you know lots of

1599
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:39,460
people do that throw their controllers everywhere so art I mean seriously the

1600
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:44,840
to read the description on gamestop.com the nerf wireless controller from

1601
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:49,500
pelican allows gamers to play like a pro baller on their PlayStation 2 the

1602
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:52,700
controllers are made from soft pliable nerf material on the outside but feature

1603
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:57,340
legendary pelican performance on the inside legendary mass they are tough

1604
01:27:57,340 --> 01:28:01,380
enough to withstand hardcore squeezing throwing twisting spiking and feel like

1605
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:06,100
no other controller on the market and there's retail for $24.99 I thought

1606
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:10,900
those came out like a long time ago I don't know if they did but I want one

1607
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:15,420
maybe it's a new version or something who knows they're kind of ugly but

1608
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:24,420
adorable mm-hmm like an ugly baby all right and on that note I think we'll

1609
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:27,460
bring part a to a close we've gone long tonight on part a I guess we have a lot

1610
