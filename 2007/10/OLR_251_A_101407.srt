00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:26,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, October 14th, 2007, Nintendo unveils holiday news that includes a dreaded delay, Elder Scrolls Oblivion gets one last hurrah, and we're joined by members of Bizarre Creations to talk about Geometry Wars Galaxy.

2
00:00:32,386 --> 00:00:34,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody out there on the internet.

3
00:00:34,207 --> 00:00:36,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:42,151
[SPEAKER_04]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:47,974
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:51,021 --> 00:00:58,668
[SPEAKER_04]: If we sound a little dead, it's because this is now our third time trying to record the show, and Jamie has been... Wait, wait a minute.

7
00:00:58,848 --> 00:01:00,750
[SPEAKER_04]: This was empty a minute ago, and now it's full again.

8
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:05,454
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Mountain Dew Gamer Fuel that Chris brought for DarkSakura.

9
00:01:05,494 --> 00:01:06,335
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like cocaine.

10
00:01:06,795 --> 00:01:07,436
[SPEAKER_04]: What's it taste like?

11
00:01:07,796 --> 00:01:15,343
[SPEAKER_06]: The taste is sort of like orange cream soda, but the first taste of it is sort of like very orangey fruit punch, and the aftertaste of it is cream soda.

12
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:16,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

13
00:01:16,672 --> 00:01:18,333
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's fairly accurate, wouldn't you say?

14
00:01:18,594 --> 00:01:19,975
[SPEAKER_04]: It tastes like butt.

15
00:01:20,115 --> 00:01:20,555
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't know.

16
00:01:21,056 --> 00:01:22,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like it so much.

17
00:01:23,178 --> 00:01:23,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of.

18
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:27,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Also joining us tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

19
00:01:30,685 --> 00:01:33,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, since this mic cord does not reach.

20
00:01:34,389 --> 00:01:34,909
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's fine.

21
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,651
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just speak into two microphones.

22
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:38,933
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't need to speak into two microphones.

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, the problem we're having tonight, folks, is that we're down to two microphones.

24
00:01:43,623 --> 00:01:49,027
[SPEAKER_04]: The microphone that Loki usually uses died while we were trying to tape live here on this lovely Sunday evening.

25
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:51,149
[SPEAKER_04]: So Loki's mic is gone.

26
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:56,673
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we're having to share between the five people who are in studio tonight, two microphones.

27
00:01:56,874 --> 00:02:04,019
[SPEAKER_04]: So we apologize if there's any audio delays or audio slowing or other audio issues, but this is what happens when you do live radio, folks.

28
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,902
[SPEAKER_04]: When things break, you don't have much time to fix it.

29
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:08,883
[SPEAKER_04]: So Loki's over there.

30
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:09,684
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, DarkSakura.

31
00:02:10,365 --> 00:02:11,446
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

32
00:02:33,203 --> 00:02:34,164
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

33
00:03:02,802 --> 00:03:04,163
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Black Lab.

34
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:05,224
[SPEAKER_04]: What is your quest?

35
00:03:07,505 --> 00:03:08,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultimate power.

36
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:11,088
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the airspeed velocity of a swallow?

37
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,048
[SPEAKER_04]: No, forget it.

38
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:15,210
[SPEAKER_04]: God, you guys are crazy.

39
00:03:16,411 --> 00:03:19,513
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?

40
00:03:21,074 --> 00:03:22,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it African or European swallow?

41
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:23,316
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know that.

42
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:26,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

43
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:28,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's...

44
00:03:30,123 --> 00:03:32,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Also say hello to a very special guest.

45
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:33,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I was surprised.

46
00:03:33,444 --> 00:03:34,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even know she was coming tonight.

47
00:03:35,064 --> 00:03:36,104
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Chris, everybody.

48
00:03:36,765 --> 00:03:38,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Surprise, butt sex!

49
00:03:39,585 --> 00:03:40,366
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

50
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:40,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

51
00:03:40,626 --> 00:03:40,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

52
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:45,087
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to keep my voice down because it's the acoustics in this room.

53
00:03:45,147 --> 00:03:45,767
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

54
00:03:45,907 --> 00:03:46,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of interesting.

55
00:03:47,087 --> 00:03:50,068
[SPEAKER_04]: And Chris is one of the official lesbians of Orange Lounge Radio.

56
00:03:50,668 --> 00:03:57,810
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm actually surprised to see her back because I was thinking you were going to be flying to Wisconsin soon, right?

57
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, I...

58
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:02,512
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to GeekCon last week, but that was only for a week.

59
00:04:02,612 --> 00:04:05,974
[SPEAKER_05]: And in March, I am officially moving to Wisconsin for my school career.

60
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie's helping me.

61
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:08,455
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no.

62
00:04:08,655 --> 00:04:09,316
[SPEAKER_06]: I am leaving.

63
00:04:10,076 --> 00:04:12,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I am going in the U-Haul with Chris, and I'm leaving.

64
00:04:13,177 --> 00:04:14,198
[SPEAKER_06]: She's coming back.

65
00:04:14,638 --> 00:04:15,138
[SPEAKER_06]: I am not.

66
00:04:15,238 --> 00:04:15,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

67
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:16,779
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding.

68
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to be funny.

69
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

70
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:20,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

71
00:04:20,641 --> 00:04:21,381
[SPEAKER_05]: I failed at it.

72
00:04:22,302 --> 00:04:22,842
[SPEAKER_05]: I failed.

73
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:23,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Fail!

74
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:25,163
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not doing it right.

75
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:26,103
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not doing it right.

76
00:04:27,204 --> 00:04:29,125
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm trying to hang out with you guys as much as possible, so...

77
00:04:29,844 --> 00:04:30,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Ragnarokan

78
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,470
[SPEAKER_06]: It was lots of Ragnarok.

79
00:04:54,531 --> 00:05:00,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I deleted a character and restart one, and I got two of them past job 50, and I played a lot.

80
00:05:00,872 --> 00:05:03,993
[SPEAKER_06]: And I looked at your copy of Every Extend Extra and couldn't find the PSP.

81
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:05,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

82
00:05:05,814 --> 00:05:07,174
[SPEAKER_04]: You accomplished a lot.

83
00:05:07,294 --> 00:05:08,995
[SPEAKER_06]: And I bought a game, and I gave it to you.

84
00:05:09,615 --> 00:05:09,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

85
00:05:10,315 --> 00:05:10,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantasy Zone.

86
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,356
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I don't have an old-school Nintendo to play it on, but I will do one.

87
00:05:13,376 --> 00:05:13,916
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have three.

88
00:05:14,676 --> 00:05:14,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.

89
00:05:14,876 --> 00:05:15,676
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will lend you one.

90
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:16,237
Yay.

91
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:17,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe our top loader.

92
00:05:18,356 --> 00:05:19,356
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

93
00:05:47,836 --> 00:05:48,296
[SPEAKER_04]: So Halo.

94
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:49,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of Halo.

95
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo and WoW.

96
00:05:50,578 --> 00:05:51,719
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your kill ratio in Halo?

97
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, more than one.

98
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:55,362
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

99
00:05:55,642 --> 00:05:57,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine is less than .75.

100
00:05:57,784 --> 00:05:58,384
[SPEAKER_04]: That's bad.

101
00:05:59,225 --> 00:05:59,786
[SPEAKER_04]: That's bad.

102
00:06:00,246 --> 00:06:00,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm like 1.6.

103
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:04,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow, that's pretty good.

104
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:04,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

105
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:06,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not that good though.

106
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I still suck on occasion.

107
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:13,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well let's move on and Chris, how was your gaming week?

108
00:06:14,157 --> 00:06:14,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

109
00:06:15,138 --> 00:06:15,438
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun.

110
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:22,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Megzi finally caved in thanks to peer pressure to get World of Warcraft.

111
00:06:22,944 --> 00:06:29,388
[SPEAKER_05]: And she bought me an account for a month, so I've been kind of trying to use that up as much as possible to try to make it worth my while.

112
00:06:29,528 --> 00:06:35,772
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I've been playing a lot of that and dying a lot, which is always a favorite pastime.

113
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:40,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, honey, Mac... I'm working... So, Virtual PC.

114
00:06:40,927 --> 00:06:46,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Virtual PC doesn't like... I don't have... Well, it works on Mac, I just don't have that much room.

115
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,451
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that Ragnarok would run on a 486.

116
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:51,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it was probably created on one.

117
00:06:52,274 --> 00:06:55,756
[SPEAKER_05]: I like my dancing blood elves.

118
00:06:56,436 --> 00:06:56,937
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.

119
00:06:57,457 --> 00:06:58,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Dancing blood elves are fun.

120
00:06:58,938 --> 00:06:59,918
[SPEAKER_04]: And good for you being Horde.

121
00:06:59,938 --> 00:07:01,119
[SPEAKER_04]: For the Horde!

122
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,220
[SPEAKER_05]: For the Alliance!

123
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Diedrani.

124
00:07:03,761 --> 00:07:04,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Boo Alliance.

125
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Draenei are okay.

126
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do Draenei.

127
00:07:06,481 --> 00:07:07,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they speak like Russians.

128
00:07:07,921 --> 00:07:10,022
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool.

129
00:07:10,322 --> 00:07:13,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

130
00:07:14,064 --> 00:07:14,464
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good.

131
00:07:15,484 --> 00:07:18,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Halo 3.

132
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:21,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gotten a little bit further in Legendary.

133
00:07:21,147 --> 00:07:24,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm on the fifth chapter or whatever.

134
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:25,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Five out of ten.

135
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Halfway through the game.

136
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:27,489
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's doing pretty good.

137
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:32,611
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have no idea how the hell I'm going to finish the last part of the game because that's where the difficulty really ramped up.

138
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:37,338
[SPEAKER_02]: and then, let's see, of course, more Saints Row multiplayer.

139
00:07:37,578 --> 00:07:46,781
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fun now because we've been playing in the Ultradome and we've been trying to jump cars to the top tier and actually been quite successful at that.

140
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:52,324
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's who can get to the top tier the quickest and then try to survive without getting hit by rockets.

141
00:07:53,244 --> 00:07:53,744
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fun.

142
00:07:54,524 --> 00:08:02,968
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, let's see, I've also been playing Half-Life 2 The Orange Box, mainly Portal on that, and that's...

143
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hoping someone on the show called Orange Lounge Radio

144
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:37,285
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, just kind of playing through that a little bit.

145
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:46,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Then watching my wife play Puzzle Quest on the 360, which is just like Puzzle Quest on everything else.

146
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,996
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I played the Yaris game.

147
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:53,079
[SPEAKER_02]: God, what the fuck?

148
00:08:54,481 --> 00:08:55,321
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know.

149
00:08:56,022 --> 00:08:58,244
[SPEAKER_02]: It's free, but I feel like I'm being ripped off.

150
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,326
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, seriously...

151
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:07,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because it's... I understand why it's free, because there's no way anyone would pay for that shit.

152
00:09:08,662 --> 00:09:12,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I just... It reminded me of, like, was it Sonic the Hedgehog 2?

153
00:09:13,144 --> 00:09:14,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, the bonus stages and that?

154
00:09:14,865 --> 00:09:16,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Except really crappy and made no sense.

155
00:09:17,246 --> 00:09:18,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just stupid.

156
00:09:19,847 --> 00:09:20,568
[SPEAKER_02]: It was horrible.

157
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried playing that, too.

158
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:26,190
[SPEAKER_03]: I downloaded it and played, like, about ten minutes of it and got confused.

159
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:31,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's like, your car has, like, a tentacle that shoots lasers, and you have to shoot...

160
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:37,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Like flying box birds and toasters or something like that.

161
00:09:38,674 --> 00:09:41,034
[SPEAKER_06]: You said the best thing ever.

162
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Tentacles that shoot lasers.

163
00:09:44,955 --> 00:09:45,696
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know.

164
00:09:45,776 --> 00:09:47,676
[SPEAKER_04]: You would think this would be the perfect game, right?

165
00:09:47,956 --> 00:09:50,837
[SPEAKER_04]: A car with a tentacle that shoots laser beams at things.

166
00:09:51,337 --> 00:09:52,357
[SPEAKER_04]: How fucking rad is that?

167
00:09:52,597 --> 00:09:55,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet somehow this game manages to fuck it up for free!

168
00:09:57,239 --> 00:10:01,620
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I will not be buying a Yaris because of this game.

169
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:03,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just telling you that much.

170
00:10:04,507 --> 00:10:07,187
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had thought about that... See, this is the thing now.

171
00:10:07,227 --> 00:10:10,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time someone thinks about Yaris, they're going to think, man, that sucked.

172
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:12,429
[SPEAKER_02]: So, thank you.

173
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:15,090
[SPEAKER_02]: You have now associated suck with Yaris.

174
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they did that already.

175
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:19,591
[SPEAKER_02]: They've just driven that home now.

176
00:10:21,752 --> 00:10:22,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

177
00:10:22,972 --> 00:10:26,193
[SPEAKER_04]: So, thumbs down on the Yaris game.

178
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:28,153
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not worth free.

179
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:33,272
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely is not worth free.

180
00:10:33,372 --> 00:10:34,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I still want a priest.

181
00:10:34,512 --> 00:10:35,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I want my time back.

182
00:10:38,434 --> 00:10:38,734
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

183
00:10:39,394 --> 00:10:40,114
[SPEAKER_04]: My Gaming Week.

184
00:10:40,634 --> 00:10:43,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Folks, today was a good day.

185
00:10:43,635 --> 00:10:44,836
[SPEAKER_04]: You know why today was a good day?

186
00:10:46,176 --> 00:10:49,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I now have a level 70 druid in Warcraft.

187
00:10:50,678 --> 00:10:51,978
[SPEAKER_04]: I dinged 70 today.

188
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:52,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, everybody.

189
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:53,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I want my grats.

190
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:54,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

191
00:10:54,739 --> 00:10:55,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

192
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

193
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, where's my grats?

194
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

195
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Grats.

196
00:10:59,341 --> 00:10:59,861
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

197
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:00,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

198
00:11:01,496 --> 00:11:02,577
[SPEAKER_04]: God, you guys need training.

199
00:11:02,937 --> 00:11:03,237
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

200
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:05,739
[SPEAKER_04]: And you all call yourselves WoW players.

201
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,280
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a WoW player.

202
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck that shit.

203
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:10,342
[SPEAKER_04]: These two are.

204
00:11:11,623 --> 00:11:17,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I was forced into exile from my dead PC and my butthead husband who won't build me a new one.

205
00:11:17,787 --> 00:11:18,387
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know what?

206
00:11:18,467 --> 00:11:21,910
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm taking matters into my own hands, and I'm playing Guild Wars.

207
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:23,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Grats.

208
00:11:25,512 --> 00:11:25,792
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

209
00:11:25,812 --> 00:11:28,214
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm level 20.

210
00:11:28,674 --> 00:11:29,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, that's not bad.

211
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:30,896
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 is partway to 70.

212
00:11:30,936 --> 00:11:31,276
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway.

213
00:11:32,118 --> 00:11:32,279
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

214
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:42,211
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did that, hooray, I'm officially an addict, and then I also played Puzzle Quest on Xbox Live with the tiniest text ever.

215
00:11:42,831 --> 00:12:01,808
[SPEAKER_04]: You can definitely tell this game is a port from another system, namely the DS, and I don't know, for me, the mechanics of the game work a little well on the DS, but it is kind of fun to be able to play the game like humongous, the game itself, not the text, on the TV, just kind of kick back, you know, play on the TV, and it does have the Xbox Live element, which is kind of cool, but...

216
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,304
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

217
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Use the stylus to swap the bricks.

218
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:21,348
[SPEAKER_04]: It works a lot easier.

219
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:23,990
[SPEAKER_04]: But otherwise, Puzzle Quest itself is a great game.

220
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:29,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it took Bejeweled and made it like 100 times better by adding this whole competitive element to it.

221
00:12:29,073 --> 00:12:30,494
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was very happy with that.

222
00:12:30,534 --> 00:12:35,017
[SPEAKER_04]: But one thing to the Xbox Live's credit, it costs about half as much as the DS version.

223
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:40,721
[SPEAKER_04]: And for an arcade title, for an Xbox Live arcade title, especially considering it came out the same week as Yaris...

224
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,221
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely one of the better things you can download on Xbox Live Arcade.

225
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:48,843
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you don't have a DS and you like puzzlers at all, I definitely recommend you check out Puzzle Quest.

226
00:12:48,863 --> 00:12:56,106
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you have a DS, maybe it's worth it to pay the extra 10, 15 bucks so you can have the game on the go and have the better controls.

227
00:12:56,646 --> 00:12:58,167
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's Puzzle Quest in a nutshell.

228
00:12:58,387 --> 00:13:02,029
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I also played the Yaris game and I was like, WTF, LOL, BBQ.

229
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:04,930
[SPEAKER_04]: What else did you play, Chris?

230
00:13:05,464 --> 00:13:06,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I play Dungeons and Dragons.

231
00:13:07,068 --> 00:13:07,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Nerd.

232
00:13:07,749 --> 00:13:08,531
[SPEAKER_05]: I am a nerd.

233
00:13:08,912 --> 00:13:10,135
[SPEAKER_05]: And I converted nerds.

234
00:13:10,295 --> 00:13:11,417
[SPEAKER_04]: I attack the darkness.

235
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:14,823
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

236
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:22,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to GeekCon in Madison, Wisconsin last week, and they had a Dungeons & Dragons table in the RPG room.

237
00:13:22,728 --> 00:13:27,951
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was set for beginners, and I'm an experienced player, so I just wanted to go in there for the gameplay and maybe help out.

238
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:36,476
[SPEAKER_05]: The guy looked at me, brought in my three core books, my 75 characters, and he looked so intimidated at me.

239
00:13:36,496 --> 00:13:38,237
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, oh, you play.

240
00:13:39,558 --> 00:13:39,939
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, yeah.

241
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:40,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

242
00:13:41,593 --> 00:13:42,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's play Let's rock it

243
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,161
[SPEAKER_04]: D&D is kind of the roots of video gaming in a way.

244
00:14:02,281 --> 00:14:03,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, modern RPGs.

245
00:14:03,782 --> 00:14:11,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Meg Z's friends, I'm teaching them how to play, and they all have played all the RPGs, Final Fantasy, World of Warcraft, so they're really good at it.

246
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,408
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're still a hardcore nerd for being into that.

247
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:14,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

248
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:15,369
Damn.

249
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:16,122
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

250
00:14:16,963 --> 00:14:17,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to our chat room.

251
00:14:17,883 --> 00:14:18,683
[SPEAKER_05]: See that webcam?

252
00:14:18,763 --> 00:14:19,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn right.

253
00:14:19,764 --> 00:14:21,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

254
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:22,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Got dice right here.

255
00:14:22,485 --> 00:14:23,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Is where our chatters always are.

256
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:31,689
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start off tonight with NM64 says, Sky, if the text, speaking of Puzzle Quest, is a port of a DS version, how can the text be small?

257
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:34,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't it be like five times bigger along with the rest of the screen?

258
00:14:34,831 --> 00:14:35,511
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you'd think.

259
00:14:35,851 --> 00:14:39,413
[SPEAKER_04]: But for whatever reason, they, you know, certainly they upscaled the graphics.

260
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:41,374
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to look at, like, pixelated stuff, okay?

261
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,815
[SPEAKER_04]: It is HD graphics.

262
00:14:42,855 --> 00:14:45,016
[SPEAKER_04]: The game looks very nice and has a good art style.

263
00:14:45,256 --> 00:14:49,818
[SPEAKER_04]: But for whatever reason, they brought in text the size of the DS resolution.

264
00:14:49,918 --> 00:14:50,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea.

265
00:14:50,638 --> 00:14:56,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think that it would be a port of the PSP version since it's in a similar aspect ratio.

266
00:14:56,421 --> 00:14:57,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps it is.

267
00:14:57,422 --> 00:14:57,862
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

268
00:14:58,122 --> 00:15:00,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played the PSP version, so it's hard for me to say.

269
00:15:00,724 --> 00:15:01,464
[SPEAKER_04]: But that would make sense.

270
00:15:02,347 --> 00:15:07,752
[SPEAKER_04]: But I hope the text in the PSP version isn't that small, because then you need a monocle to read it.

271
00:15:07,812 --> 00:15:09,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, a magnifying glass is crazy.

272
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:11,035
[SPEAKER_04]: A fucking monocle.

273
00:15:11,055 --> 00:15:12,637
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, you need a fucking monocle.

274
00:15:13,217 --> 00:15:15,599
[SPEAKER_05]: The NDA 4.0 is going to suck.

275
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard they're making it like Warcraft.

276
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:19,463
[SPEAKER_05]: It is, and you know what the problem is?

277
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,184
[SPEAKER_05]: It's worse.

278
00:15:20,564 --> 00:15:27,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Because instead of them running around and doing stuff, it's little figures that you have on the mat, and they just move.

279
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Are Chinese people going to be farming for gold in D&D 4.0 as well?

280
00:15:33,624 --> 00:15:34,004
[SPEAKER_02]: No idea.

281
00:15:34,665 --> 00:15:34,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

282
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:38,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Those little figurines were cool when they were on their own separate game.

283
00:15:38,968 --> 00:15:41,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they had those D&D figurines for a few years now.

284
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:44,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to collect them for my roommates.

285
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:45,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that like Warhammer?

286
00:15:46,434 --> 00:15:46,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a nerd.

287
00:15:47,134 --> 00:15:48,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Are those like Warhammer things?

288
00:15:49,676 --> 00:15:50,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of.

289
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:54,580
[SPEAKER_06]: And you used the hex charts to move them around and all that crap?

290
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it wasn't a hex chart.

291
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:56,962
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just the squares.

292
00:15:56,982 --> 00:15:57,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

293
00:15:58,462 --> 00:16:00,403
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you had little characters.

294
00:16:00,503 --> 00:16:10,249
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy who runs our game actually uses... The guy who runs the game that I'm in actually uses a hex map and little figurines.

295
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that.

296
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,151
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, fuck the hex maps.

297
00:16:13,271 --> 00:16:17,194
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about, if they survive the fall down the stairs, they win.

298
00:16:17,574 --> 00:16:21,256
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, you just flick those little things off the stairs and they fly.

299
00:16:22,037 --> 00:16:23,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I have a suggestion.

300
00:16:23,738 --> 00:16:24,819
[SPEAKER_06]: How about we move off of D&D?

301
00:16:27,592 --> 00:16:37,221
[SPEAKER_04]: No disrespect, but we do want to move on with the show because thanks to all our audio problems that you didn't hear tonight if you weren't listening live, we're now 40 minutes into our program tonight and no news yet.

302
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:39,183
[SPEAKER_04]: So really quick, some housekeeping.

303
00:16:39,643 --> 00:16:46,050
[SPEAKER_04]: You can view a live webcam of our show in progress or an archived webcam of our show over operator11.com.

304
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,533
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see our smiling faces all looking at you, waving hello and doing this program.

306
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Smash Bros.

307
00:16:58,649 --> 00:16:59,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Brawl It's Delayed

308
00:17:28,444 --> 00:17:31,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Haha, no Smash Brothers for Christmas, Timmy.

309
00:17:31,805 --> 00:17:36,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, it's going to be coming out now in February on the 10th.

310
00:17:37,826 --> 00:17:40,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And other news, Sonic the Hedgehog's in there.

311
00:17:41,047 --> 00:17:43,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, that's like such a surprise.

312
00:17:43,768 --> 00:17:47,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, who would have thought that Sonic the Hedgehog would be on a Wii game?

313
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:49,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

314
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:50,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would have thought?

315
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:58,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, it's not like that they have, I don't know, Mario and Sonic at the Olympics and shit like that.

316
00:17:58,976 --> 00:18:00,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic is in there, it's pretty cool.

317
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:03,799
[SPEAKER_02]: What more can I say?

318
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I am not surprised.

319
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:11,203
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, this will be, I'm guessing, the first of many delays to come.

320
00:18:11,683 --> 00:18:22,148
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, we had heard, straight from Nintendo, Nintendo recently announced that there will be an additional 30 days added to most fourth quarter Wii releases due to production issues.

321
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:26,751
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll probably see a lot of Wii titles slipping by 30 days or so.

322
00:18:28,115 --> 00:18:28,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.

323
00:18:28,517 --> 00:18:29,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is this coming from?

324
00:18:30,324 --> 00:18:31,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo?

325
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:32,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

326
00:18:33,032 --> 00:18:34,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Mega Man

327
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:03,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Mega Man?

328
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody?

329
00:19:04,761 --> 00:19:05,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody?

330
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:05,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else think?

331
00:19:05,981 --> 00:19:06,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's not in there?

332
00:19:07,641 --> 00:19:08,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Or who's already in there?

333
00:19:08,802 --> 00:19:12,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

334
00:19:13,563 --> 00:19:17,305
[SPEAKER_06]: If they kept on the Sega route, I would actually put Knuckles in it.

335
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:30,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say to make, because now everybody's going like OMG Mario vs. Sonic, I would say to make the console wars of yesteryear complete, Bonk needs to be the third party character in the game, but we'll see.

336
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:36,540
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're like, okay, hooray, we're going to have Sonic in the game.

337
00:19:36,701 --> 00:19:40,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and by the way, we're going to release this game next year on February 10th.

338
00:19:41,804 --> 00:19:42,825
[SPEAKER_07]: They just ran out.

339
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:44,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Darth Vader, no, forget it.

340
00:19:48,641 --> 00:19:49,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Bad joke.

341
00:19:49,341 --> 00:19:50,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Joke gone wrong.

342
00:19:50,062 --> 00:19:56,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say, they probably just ran out of days, you know, to tease characters, you know, in the Smash Dojo.

343
00:19:56,604 --> 00:19:58,084
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're like, fuck, we need some more time.

344
00:19:58,304 --> 00:19:59,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just push the game back.

345
00:19:59,325 --> 00:19:59,745
[SPEAKER_02]: How about that?

346
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,106
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I like Saikun's suggestion of Bomberman.

347
00:20:02,726 --> 00:20:11,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's more... Because Bomberman was also one of the NEC, you know, Hudson main people.

348
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:14,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Tetsuya says Pyramid Head.

349
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,331
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome, but not going to happen.

350
00:20:16,371 --> 00:20:16,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

351
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:17,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

352
00:20:19,204 --> 00:20:20,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, we'll see.

353
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,712
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to be cooler than all your friends and play Super Smash Bros.

354
00:20:43,732 --> 00:20:48,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Brawl first, you've got to go to E4ALL, which is being held in L.A.

355
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:49,677
[SPEAKER_04]: next week.

356
00:20:50,577 --> 00:20:52,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting on October 18th at the L.A.

357
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:52,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Convention Center.

358
00:20:52,979 --> 00:20:57,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, this is the little band-aid because there was no real E3.

359
00:20:57,642 --> 00:20:59,243
[SPEAKER_04]: There was mini-E3 earlier this year.

360
00:21:00,004 --> 00:21:02,986
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is their throw to try and fill that void.

361
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:05,708
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, Sony and Microsoft are not going to be there.

362
00:21:06,252 --> 00:21:09,774
[SPEAKER_04]: However, Nintendo is, Nintendo said, we're going to be there and we're showing off all of these games.

363
00:21:09,794 --> 00:21:12,396
[SPEAKER_04]: We're showing off Super Mario Galaxy, Super Smash Bros.

364
00:21:12,456 --> 00:21:31,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Brawl, Donkey Kong Barrel Blast, Battalion Wars 2, Fire Emblem, Wii Zapper, Crossbow Training, Mario Song at the Olympics, Guitar Hero 3, Rayman Raving Rabbids 2, Resident Evil Umbrella, Ella, Ella, A, A, A, Chronicles, Medal of Honor Heroes 2, Ghost Squad, and on the DS, there's a lot of stuff.

365
00:21:32,108 --> 00:21:34,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Pokemon, Diamond and Pearl, wait, didn't that come out?

366
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Brain Age, wait, didn't that come out?

367
00:21:36,471 --> 00:21:37,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Brain Age 2, wait, that came out too.

368
00:21:39,093 --> 00:21:41,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Zelda Phantom Hourglass, actually that came out as well.

369
00:21:41,114 --> 00:21:43,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendogs, you know, that came out too.

370
00:21:43,155 --> 00:21:47,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Kart, you know, a lot of these games they're showing actually have already come out, I'm noticing.

371
00:21:47,517 --> 00:21:48,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Shh, they're new.

372
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:52,660
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're not new, they're new to you.

373
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,723
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, if you want to play them like they're new again, head on over to E4ALL.

374
00:21:57,763 --> 00:22:02,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Final Fantasy XII is going to be there, that little spin-off game on the DS, so there's some new stuff.

375
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,286
[SPEAKER_06]: They may not be new, but you'll think they are.

376
00:22:06,106 --> 00:22:07,367
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to try to fool you.

377
00:22:08,507 --> 00:22:17,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what is not new, and actually this does not completely surprise me at all, is that the Wii is not lowering price at all.

378
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,253
[SPEAKER_06]: It will stay at $249.

379
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:26,816
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's because the folks at Nintendo are saying that they're selling them as they make them.

380
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:31,578
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're having absolutely no trouble and see no point in lowering the price.

381
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,552
[SPEAKER_06]: On top of that, I mean, honestly, $249 is not bad for a system.

382
00:22:36,892 --> 00:22:41,794
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically Nintendo's saying, you know, well, you guys are still buying them, so what do we need to do any different?

383
00:22:41,914 --> 00:22:43,515
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, we're going to increase the price!

384
00:22:44,455 --> 00:22:44,856
[SPEAKER_04]: You know.

385
00:22:44,876 --> 00:22:45,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucka!

386
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:46,136
[SPEAKER_04]: They could.

387
00:22:46,596 --> 00:22:50,098
[SPEAKER_06]: The direct quote, I think it's funny that this guy's name is George Harrison.

388
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:58,482
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, who is one of the Nintendo reps, said that we'll stay at $249 for the foreseeable future.

389
00:22:58,902 --> 00:23:01,063
[SPEAKER_06]: We are still selling everything we can make.

390
00:23:02,273 --> 00:23:03,974
[SPEAKER_06]: So hey, you're making money.

391
00:23:04,054 --> 00:23:04,915
[SPEAKER_06]: You're still selling them.

392
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:05,675
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell?

393
00:23:06,235 --> 00:23:06,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I know one thing.

394
00:23:06,796 --> 00:23:09,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought George Harrison was leaving Nintendo and going back to being a dead beetle.

395
00:23:11,298 --> 00:23:11,639
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

396
00:23:12,219 --> 00:23:15,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard... No, I seriously heard he was leaving Nintendo.

397
00:23:15,221 --> 00:23:16,742
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's going on with that?

398
00:23:17,502 --> 00:23:19,363
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bad... Okay, that's the bad joke.

399
00:23:21,004 --> 00:23:21,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

400
00:23:21,585 --> 00:23:29,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say that this didn't make the show roll, but there was conspiracy theories going around that there...

401
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:38,466
[SPEAKER_02]: One, that they're either lowering production so that there's still a shortage going through the holidays to increase demand on the Wii.

402
00:23:40,327 --> 00:23:47,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, because this is also kind of being shown in their marketing campaign, or that they're just making the best of a bad situation.

403
00:23:47,611 --> 00:23:52,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, if you notice, their new set of commercials now, the very first thing that starts off is all, we got one.

404
00:23:53,313 --> 00:23:54,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's a big thing.

405
00:23:54,374 --> 00:23:55,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, we got one.

406
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:56,555
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, no, you know...

407
00:23:57,828 --> 00:24:02,231
[SPEAKER_02]: We stood up, we started playing, we had fun, we bonded, all this shit.

408
00:24:02,451 --> 00:24:04,172
[SPEAKER_02]: But the whole thing is like, we got one!

409
00:24:04,312 --> 00:24:05,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, celebration!

410
00:24:06,293 --> 00:24:08,494
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's the fucking thing, that's what they're doing.

411
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:10,996
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to market off of this shortage thing.

412
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:15,298
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether it's intentional or not, they're using it to their advantage.

413
00:24:15,918 --> 00:24:16,579
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

414
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:20,681
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably don't need to anyways, but it's probably a good marketing campaign.

415
00:24:21,161 --> 00:24:23,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's just going to increase hype, and really that's all that they care about.

416
00:24:25,544 --> 00:24:25,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Although...

417
00:24:27,629 --> 00:24:33,550
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a part in there that is a little disturbing with the mother and son.

418
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:41,012
[SPEAKER_02]: They're playing some game or something, and she's like holding his hand, and it's like, was it We Came Together?

419
00:24:41,352 --> 00:24:42,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Or something like that.

420
00:24:42,352 --> 00:24:43,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh!

421
00:24:44,372 --> 00:24:44,913
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

422
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:48,153
[SPEAKER_05]: God, only you people could think that.

423
00:24:48,713 --> 00:24:53,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the one that at the very end, the Japanese guys hand you the controller?

424
00:24:53,134 --> 00:24:55,735
[SPEAKER_07]: We would like to play!

425
00:24:58,593 --> 00:24:59,253
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really funny.

426
00:24:59,273 --> 00:25:11,220
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was in Wisconsin, Megzi's mother was entertaining some Japanese guests, and she's got a Wii, and they were looking at it, and Megzi was like, oh, yeah, it's a Wii.

427
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,181
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, we've never seen one.

428
00:25:15,142 --> 00:25:16,723
[SPEAKER_05]: They were from Chiba, so I don't know.

429
00:25:16,763 --> 00:25:21,085
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually have the chatroom reaction to Loki's little comment on We Came Together.

430
00:25:22,626 --> 00:25:25,428
We Came Together

431
00:25:31,639 --> 00:25:34,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

432
00:25:34,621 --> 00:25:36,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Way to have that clip queued up.

433
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:38,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize there was going to be like 15 seconds into it.

434
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:43,667
No!

435
00:25:45,268 --> 00:25:47,149
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we don't have a soundboard on the program, folks.

436
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:48,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

437
00:25:50,951 --> 00:25:58,696
[SPEAKER_02]: In other news, and more to get you up on your feet, Wii Fit's coming out to Japan on December 1st for 8,800 yen.

438
00:26:00,362 --> 00:26:28,500
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course I'll feature the Wii balance board that's approximately $75 US And yeah, no idea when it's coming out in the US though So you'll have to wait your fat asses until it comes out Actually those boards supposedly only hold up to like 300 pounds So if you're like one of those people on the Maury Povich show You may not even get to play this game at all Get two boards One for each hoof Wait, no

439
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:30,976
[SPEAKER_04]: How many yen was that?

440
00:26:31,897 --> 00:26:32,258
[SPEAKER_04]: It was 8,800.

441
00:26:32,338 --> 00:26:33,439
[SPEAKER_04]: 8,800 yen.

442
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:39,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Now if you're having difficulty imagining how much money 8,800 yen is, imagine one yen 8,800 times.

443
00:26:42,548 --> 00:26:44,890
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not over 9,000 though, so that's good.

444
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:45,631
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like 85 bucks.

445
00:26:47,453 --> 00:26:47,713
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

446
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:53,901
[SPEAKER_04]: However, what's coming out right now is the 3.1 update for the Wii.

447
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:57,883
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to have USB keyboard support for everything.

448
00:26:57,903 --> 00:27:01,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Because remember before, the Wii update only had the limited USB support.

449
00:27:02,005 --> 00:27:03,686
[SPEAKER_02]: And how long did it take them to do this shit?

450
00:27:03,726 --> 00:27:04,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, seriously.

451
00:27:04,787 --> 00:27:05,928
[SPEAKER_02]: This should have been in their...

452
00:27:07,737 --> 00:27:16,061
[SPEAKER_04]: and also with the new Wii update a brand new enhanced Everybody Votes channel and did they make the Everybody Votes channel interesting again?

453
00:27:16,522 --> 00:27:22,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly no, they just added the USB keyboard support to the Everybody Votes channel so if you're actually still voting

454
00:27:23,326 --> 00:27:35,153
[SPEAKER_04]: of which I can't imagine there's that many people still voting, but if you are, then, well, you get a new enhanced version and you can submit your questions now using the keyboard so you can annoy Nintendo even faster with your questions like, what's better, cake or pie?

455
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:36,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Cake or death?

456
00:27:38,675 --> 00:27:39,996
[SPEAKER_04]: What's a better way to die?

457
00:27:40,136 --> 00:27:41,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire, boat fire, you know?

458
00:27:43,258 --> 00:27:46,580
[SPEAKER_04]: And I encourage people to send their dumb questions to Nintendo because it's funny.

459
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,681
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really funny.

460
00:27:49,941 --> 00:27:50,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Funny!

461
00:27:51,345 --> 00:28:20,534
[SPEAKER_06]: funny haha or funny oh fuck well for our friends in the UK we have a few updates to virtual console we have Super Metroid dun dun dun and it is 800 points uh 560 or 8 euro what Rob's giving me this look I'm like what so yeah go play Super Metroid all of you now

462
00:28:22,392 --> 00:28:28,696
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you also get, that was on the NES, you get Protector Bot 2, Return of the Evil Forces.

463
00:28:29,436 --> 00:28:31,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Known to us as Super Contra.

464
00:28:31,297 --> 00:28:36,580
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a retarded name that they... Protector Bot.

465
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Contra came out of there as Protector Bot.

466
00:28:40,382 --> 00:28:40,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Protector Bot.

467
00:28:41,963 --> 00:28:43,284
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it had different sprites too.

468
00:28:44,404 --> 00:28:47,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, Contra is just awesome, so whatever.

469
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:49,047
[SPEAKER_06]: With blood.

470
00:28:51,108 --> 00:28:58,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to the chatroom, I was giggling because Nintendo Maniacs64 says, The best Everybody Votes channel question, what's better, the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3?

471
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:05,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, SSJ100Matt thinks the Mii's will be the last unlockable character in Super Smash Bros.

472
00:29:05,418 --> 00:29:05,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Brawl.

473
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:09,441
[SPEAKER_04]: VXChaseXP says, The Everybody Votes channel rules!

474
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:13,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I vote every day, says our loyal webmaster, VXChaseXP.

475
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:16,306
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just made fun of the guy that hosts our website for nothing.

476
00:29:16,567 --> 00:29:17,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, Rob.

477
00:29:18,311 --> 00:29:20,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought Jason had more of a life than that.

478
00:29:21,774 --> 00:29:22,114
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

479
00:29:22,154 --> 00:29:23,114
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just very democratic.

480
00:29:23,175 --> 00:29:24,295
[SPEAKER_04]: He wants his voice to be known.

481
00:29:24,576 --> 00:29:27,698
[SPEAKER_04]: He wants people to know who he thinks should win American Idol.

482
00:29:28,118 --> 00:29:30,540
[SPEAKER_04]: He wants people to know what color is better.

483
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,222
[SPEAKER_04]: What other kinds of dumbass things did they ask on there?

484
00:29:33,802 --> 00:29:38,626
[SPEAKER_04]: He wants people to know that he prefers winter over summer and all that crap.

485
00:29:39,106 --> 00:29:39,386
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

486
00:29:40,427 --> 00:29:44,049
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jason Oches commented, gotta love this like, puppy should die in a boat fire.

487
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:44,590
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

488
00:29:49,008 --> 00:30:14,839
[SPEAKER_02]: boat fire is okay at least there's water so finally it seems that Nintendo is going to be turning around this whole lack of stuff for Wii Online including of course they talked about the WiiWare service and they made some announcements of new titles that are going to be coming out for the WiiWare service including Pokemon Farm a Crystal Chronicles Yay!

489
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Pokemon Farm!

490
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:16,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up!

491
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,420
Don't just poke

492
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:42,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Crystal Chronicles game called The Young King and the Promised Land where you build your own country and let's see here also Star Soldier R and Dr. Mario Wii that's also going to be coming out as well of course no dates yet as far as when we're going to see them in the US or pretty much anywhere on Earth imagine next year at some point

493
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Other games announced as well.

494
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:49,326
[SPEAKER_02]: There was Mina de Puzzle Loop, which came out over here as Magnetica.

495
00:30:49,526 --> 00:30:50,667
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a ripoff of Zuma.

496
00:30:51,547 --> 00:30:58,671
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, of course, there was a game called Marubo Shikaku.

497
00:30:59,211 --> 00:31:05,854
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's some weird thing that involves screens displaying different patterns, circle, line, and square based.

498
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,755
[SPEAKER_02]: And no idea what the fuck that is.

499
00:31:10,023 --> 00:31:16,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, and of course, those are only kind of a little sampling of what's going to be coming.

500
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:21,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo says that there's going to be over 100 WiiWare games that have been proposed to them.

501
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,836
[SPEAKER_02]: And who knows?

502
00:31:23,996 --> 00:31:26,438
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see some good original content coming in 2008.

503
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:34,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say there was one other thing, too, that they showed off there real quick.

504
00:31:34,784 --> 00:31:35,404
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

505
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah, it's about fucking time.

506
00:32:33,143 --> 00:32:35,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I wish to understand that you have a mudkip.

507
00:32:35,965 --> 00:32:37,866
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to trade your mudkip for my pillup.

508
00:32:40,608 --> 00:32:43,090
Hey, that pillup turns into a big buttfucker penguin.

509
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:47,093
[SPEAKER_05]: That pillup turns into a big buttfucker penguin, to quote my girlfriend.

510
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:52,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, so WiiWare, lots of stuff coming out for the WiiWare.

511
00:32:53,216 --> 00:32:55,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, another game coming out, Wii Music.

512
00:32:55,398 --> 00:32:59,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, a lot of us saw this game at the very first time we saw the Wii at E3 2006.

513
00:33:00,102 --> 00:33:05,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember when, I think it was Miyamoto came out on stage, he's conducting the orchestra, da-da-da, what?

514
00:33:06,468 --> 00:33:11,012
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was Miyamoto on the thing, but I saw Koji Kondo playing, and got his autograph.

515
00:33:12,347 --> 00:33:12,927
[SPEAKER_04]: www.DarkSakura.com

516
00:33:27,894 --> 00:33:30,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a band that has a zither, a harmonica, a melodica...

517
00:33:57,526 --> 00:34:01,568
[SPEAKER_06]: an auto harp, and one snare drum.

518
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:08,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like Nintendo to know that if this game does not have a didgeridoo, it sucks.

519
00:34:09,691 --> 00:34:16,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, like, you better fucking have a didgeridoo in this game, because I want nothing to do with it if I cannot have my... A flugelhorn.

520
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:16,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway...

521
00:34:26,443 --> 00:34:27,104
[SPEAKER_05]: and a cowbell.

522
00:34:27,364 --> 00:34:28,705
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to have a cowbell.

523
00:34:31,648 --> 00:34:32,729
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to have a cowbell.

524
00:34:32,769 --> 00:34:45,541
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need a band with a didgeridoo, a zither, a cowbell, a flugelhorn, a sitar and a harmonica.

525
00:34:46,102 --> 00:34:48,324
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is why we don't let you guys make music.

526
00:34:48,718 --> 00:34:53,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Son of Dad would like there to be a skin flute in the game that you can play.

527
00:35:09,231 --> 00:35:11,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the sound of human screams.

528
00:35:11,433 --> 00:35:12,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that an instrument?

529
00:35:12,594 --> 00:35:13,334
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

530
00:35:13,774 --> 00:35:19,098
[SPEAKER_06]: If you need a game for that, then you need to do simple steps.

531
00:35:20,499 --> 00:35:21,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Stand up.

532
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:23,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to your door.

533
00:35:23,802 --> 00:35:24,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Open it.

534
00:35:24,482 --> 00:35:25,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Walk out.

535
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:26,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Closing the door is optional.

536
00:35:27,744 --> 00:35:30,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Go through the appropriate hallway to get to your front door.

537
00:35:30,566 --> 00:35:30,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Open it.

538
00:35:31,067 --> 00:35:31,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Step out.

539
00:35:31,787 --> 00:35:32,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Leave.

540
00:35:33,068 --> 00:35:34,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Experience nature.

541
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Real life.

542
00:35:38,312 --> 00:35:38,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Get

543
00:35:39,452 --> 00:35:42,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I highly recommend that.

544
00:35:42,053 --> 00:35:45,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this coming from the bitch who wants a sitar in Wii Music.

545
00:35:46,555 --> 00:35:49,636
[SPEAKER_06]: I want an electric sitar, because sitars are sexy.

546
00:35:50,636 --> 00:35:50,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

547
00:35:52,657 --> 00:35:54,117
[SPEAKER_05]: That's explicit on chat.

548
00:35:55,918 --> 00:35:58,679
[SPEAKER_06]: We were explicit from the moment you said surprise butt sex.

549
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:03,950
[SPEAKER_05]: I make the explicit tag come up.

550
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,270
[SPEAKER_06]: So, shall I continue?

551
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:18,373
[SPEAKER_06]: For anyone who's looking forward to the new Mario Kart, you are going to be able to play up to 12 players online on Mario Kart Wii, which will officially make it the biggest Mario Kart ever.

552
00:36:20,574 --> 00:36:21,334
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as you do it right.

553
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:28,856
[SPEAKER_04]: And as long as there's not two people on the car at the same time, because that's just going to be bad memories I don't want to revisit.

554
00:36:30,953 --> 00:36:32,354
[SPEAKER_04]: and also there's bikes now.

555
00:36:33,334 --> 00:36:34,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, so now it's like Project Gotham 4?

556
00:36:35,295 --> 00:36:35,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

557
00:36:35,715 --> 00:36:39,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I tried playing the motorbikes in Project Gotham 4, not pretty.

558
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:41,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really bad at Project Gotham racing.

559
00:36:42,098 --> 00:36:49,421
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, watching me race the motorbike in Project Gotham 4 was like watching me learn how to ride a bike for the first time.

560
00:36:49,461 --> 00:36:56,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I'm going left, I'm going right, and then left, right, and then I fall off and collapse in a big heap and my bike falls on top of me to add insult to injury.

561
00:36:57,385 --> 00:36:59,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Project Gotham, for making me feel like a bad driver.

562
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:07,219
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah, there will be bikes which, it's like why the fuck do you need bikes?

563
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:12,204
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the game was fine as Mario Kart it's not Mario Kart and stuff I mean, seriously

564
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:35,832
[SPEAKER_02]: um anyways so Mario and Sonic at the Olympics they've already announced a bunch of really cool characters that you can play as but fuck that let's play as myself because you can play as your own me in the game because you know hey fuck all the time that you know it takes to actually put these wonderful characters in the game let's just have some dick put his own stupid me in there and play as himself hooray

565
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:38,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that, I ain't buying the game anyways.

566
00:37:38,142 --> 00:37:39,083
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the fucking Olympics.

567
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,505
[SPEAKER_04]: You're gonna trick me this time.

568
00:37:40,565 --> 00:37:44,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I like this idea because now, like, we can find out who's better, me or Mario.

569
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:45,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Me.

570
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's faster, me or Sonic?

571
00:37:48,031 --> 00:37:48,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Me.

572
00:37:49,412 --> 00:37:54,597
[SPEAKER_04]: I can now prove that I'm the best thing ever with my me, right?

573
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:57,880
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about me.

574
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's all about me.

575
00:38:00,763 --> 00:38:01,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

576
00:38:03,269 --> 00:38:14,316
[SPEAKER_04]: One game that I'm glad my me cannot be put into is Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles because I would not want to die in this game or get shot or what have you or get my brains eaten by zombies.

577
00:38:14,837 --> 00:38:19,060
[SPEAKER_04]: But what you can get with the Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles is the Wii Zapper.

578
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:19,640
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

579
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,743
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually going to be a Wii Zapper combo coming out.

580
00:38:24,043 --> 00:38:27,866
[SPEAKER_04]: And although right now it looks like it's only coming out in Japan, you never know.

581
00:38:28,246 --> 00:38:31,288
[SPEAKER_04]: If you cross your fingers, hold your breath, it might come out over here on stateside.

582
00:38:31,328 --> 00:38:32,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Not gonna happen!

583
00:38:32,649 --> 00:38:33,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Why's that?

584
00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:34,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's not gonna happen.

585
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:35,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Japan gets all the cool shit.

586
00:38:36,131 --> 00:38:43,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well they also get with this cool shit called the Expert Package, a 28-page book called Wesker's Extra Report.

587
00:38:44,057 --> 00:38:45,097
[SPEAKER_04]: And they also get stickers.

588
00:38:45,117 --> 00:38:46,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Stickers!

589
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:48,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Because who doesn't love stickers?

590
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:51,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I love that it says zombie pew pew.

591
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway...

592
00:38:53,627 --> 00:39:05,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, one thing though about the special editions is that when we got, when Biohazard Code Veronica came out over here, well, we didn't get the big briefcase that had the Wesker's files and everything.

593
00:39:05,652 --> 00:39:06,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan and I were tempted to order it.

594
00:39:07,213 --> 00:39:15,977
[SPEAKER_06]: However, what they did after the fact was release the Wesker report as a special disc, like a free giveaway.

595
00:39:16,717 --> 00:39:18,358
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got like a bunch of them.

596
00:39:18,978 --> 00:39:22,060
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I think that we're going to get the stuff

597
00:39:22,782 --> 00:39:24,804
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not going to be in the cool-ass bundle.

598
00:39:25,124 --> 00:39:26,685
[SPEAKER_06]: So, anyway.

599
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:33,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that is happy yay face is... It's O-face.

600
00:39:34,191 --> 00:39:34,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

601
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:49,564
[SPEAKER_06]: If you get Contra 4, you are getting Contra... Not just that, you're getting Contra Super C and the Protector Bot from the UK version.

602
00:39:49,584 --> 00:39:49,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

603
00:39:51,297 --> 00:39:53,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, stop having Pikachu fuck!

604
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just entertaining our Op11 people before they get cut off, but I'm listening.

605
00:40:02,023 --> 00:40:12,309
[SPEAKER_06]: The Op11 feed limits us to 40 minutes of recording, so... Anyway, so, um... So you get... Stop it!

606
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:17,452
[SPEAKER_06]: So you get Contra, Super C, and you get the Protector Bot.

607
00:40:17,772 --> 00:40:18,953
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I bet you're happy.

608
00:40:19,699 --> 00:40:22,040
[SPEAKER_02]: and art galleries and comics and all that fun shit.

609
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about the comics, but fun shit.

610
00:40:26,361 --> 00:40:48,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so other things that you're going to get, including this week, lots of fun games coming out, including one game that's kind of infamous with this show, a certain game on the Xbox 360 to which you roll around a ball, we'll call it, and you roll over objects and you're, let's call them

[SPEAKER_02]: Victoria's Boxers.

617
00:41:20,529 --> 00:41:24,150
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're looking for an anime Mike Tyson's punch-out, maybe.

618
00:41:25,211 --> 00:41:26,871
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't sound very interesting at all.

619
00:41:27,372 --> 00:41:30,713
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like Victoria's secret is that she actually wears boxers.

620
00:41:31,914 --> 00:41:34,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Victorious, not Victoria boxers.

621
00:41:35,055 --> 00:41:36,335
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you said Victoria's.

622
00:41:36,876 --> 00:41:38,216
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's Victorious.

623
00:41:39,157 --> 00:41:39,457

635
00:42:19,882 --> 00:42:21,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Or actually, I think May on everything else.

636
00:42:22,224 --> 00:42:23,685
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sucked.

[SPEAKER_02]: Don't touch that game.

643
00:42:37,033 --> 00:42:37,834
[SPEAKER_02]: It's horrible.

644
00:42:39,955 --> 00:42:40,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

645
00:42:41,465 --> 00:42:44,948
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on PC, there's a whole bunch of crap.

646
00:42:45,308 --> 00:42:46,769
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, let's see here.

[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that looks like shit.

[SPEAKER_02]: Zoo Tycoon 2.

651
00:42:54,795 --> 00:42:57,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Because where would we be without a Tycoon game each week?

[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, let's see here.

653

[SPEAKER_02]: On the DS, Flash Focus Vision Training.

654
00:43:04,193 --> 00:43:09,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, another fucking training game that Nintendo's going to sucker you into buying because you're blind without it.

655
00:43:10,258 --> 00:43:14,281
[SPEAKER_02]: And Disney Princess Magical Jewels is going to be coming out on the DS.

656
00:43:15,582 --> 00:43:19,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not want to see the princess's magical jewels because that sounds just really wrong.

657
00:43:19,426 --> 00:43:22,048
[SPEAKER_02]: And this, I'm sure, will make a certain chatter happy.

658
00:43:22,888 --> 00:43:26,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Hannah Montana Music Jam on the DS.

659
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck the chatters, I'm happy!

660
00:43:31,801 --> 00:43:33,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you paying $2,000 for a concert ticket?

661
00:43:35,283 --> 00:43:36,623
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not stupid.

662
00:43:36,663 --> 00:43:37,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy, not stupid.

663
00:43:37,984 --> 00:43:38,984
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

664
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:40,124
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

665
00:43:41,725 --> 00:43:42,625
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a wonderful game.

666
00:43:42,725 --> 00:43:47,767
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like jam sessions, except, well, you can, I don't know.

667
00:43:50,077 --> 00:43:51,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie was asking me what.

668
00:43:52,358 --> 00:43:58,219
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it on CNN four times in the last month about how their concert tickets are getting sold by scalpers.

669
00:43:58,779 --> 00:44:05,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Real quick, though, and one other thing on the PC, Heroes of Might and Magic 5, Tribes of the East, that expansion is finally coming out as well.

670
00:44:06,001 --> 00:44:08,242
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is pretty much everything.

671
00:44:08,582 --> 00:44:12,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then let's go to Japan and see what our friends overseas are getting this week.

672
00:44:12,723 --> 00:44:16,344
[SPEAKER_04]: They are also getting a game you may have heard of on this program.

673
00:44:17,332 --> 00:44:18,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we had to get rid of it.

674
00:44:18,272 --> 00:44:23,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful Katamari Damacy ships in Japan on October 18th on the Xbox 360.

675
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:27,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Another game coming out on the Xbox 360, Zoids Alternative.

676
00:44:27,675 --> 00:44:29,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Not Zoinks, but Zoids Alternative.

677
00:44:29,816 --> 00:44:36,518
[SPEAKER_04]: And it kind of looks like a cyborg type game, but what I find very interesting is that the box art totally has Final Fantasy font.

678
00:44:36,979 --> 00:44:41,100
[SPEAKER_04]: But yet it has, like, it totally looks like a Final Fantasy game, but yet...

679
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:44,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing to do with Final Fantasy.

680
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:48,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed that it's a Takara game and Takara is responsible for Transformers over there.

681
00:44:48,933 --> 00:45:00,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Zoids is like a, I don't know, I call it a ripoff of like fucking, I don't know, like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers or maybe even like... Which was a ripoff on the Japanese franchise.

682
00:45:01,578 --> 00:45:05,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, and I'd say maybe even also a ripoff of Voltron a little bit.

683
00:45:07,231 --> 00:45:09,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Power Rangers destroyed my childhood.

684
00:45:09,852 --> 00:45:13,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Hitstun in our chatroom would like to remind us they've been making Zoids games since the NES.

685
00:45:15,394 --> 00:45:27,718
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also like to point out with all the ripping off thing and Rob bringing up the Final Fantasy font that it was Yoshitaka Amano who was in part responsible for us having the whole transforming team whatever mecha genre to begin with.

686
00:45:28,558 --> 00:45:30,519
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's responsible for the rape of my childhood.

687
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:33,960
[SPEAKER_06]: He did the character designs for Kagaki Ninja Tai Gatchaman.

688
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,721
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care what anyone says.

689
00:45:35,781 --> 00:45:36,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Trini was hot.

690
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:42,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Also hot is Tobey Maguire starring in Spider-Man 3 coming out on the PlayStation 3.

691
00:45:44,226 --> 00:45:46,188
[SPEAKER_04]: See how I took it right back on track?

692
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:47,208
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so cool.

693
00:45:47,288 --> 00:45:48,269
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the Japanese.

694
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:51,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, because it's the Japanese version.

695
00:45:51,271 --> 00:45:52,912
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why the box says Japanese writing.

696
00:45:52,952 --> 00:45:53,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Go figure.

697
00:45:54,853 --> 00:45:55,454
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting.

698
00:45:55,494 --> 00:45:56,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see that every day.

699
00:45:56,735 --> 00:45:57,315
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 3.

700
00:45:58,396 --> 00:45:59,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't panic.

701
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:00,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Seaman 2.

702
00:46:00,897 --> 00:46:06,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Notice that is a sea man, not the other thing.

703
00:46:06,061 --> 00:46:06,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

704
00:46:08,698 --> 00:46:09,439
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no.

705
00:46:09,879 --> 00:46:14,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan and I sat around with our Dreamcast talking to our Seaman for how long?

706
00:46:20,607 --> 00:46:22,088
[SPEAKER_04]: How often do you talk to Dan's Seaman?

707
00:46:23,409 --> 00:46:25,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan was the one who talked to our Seaman.

708
00:46:26,352 --> 00:46:27,973
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they turned into man-frogs and left.

709
00:46:33,376 --> 00:46:34,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Make it stop!

710
00:46:34,698 --> 00:46:36,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

711
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:40,505
[SPEAKER_04]: That sound you hear is millions of listeners across America throwing up into their mouths.

712
00:46:41,527 --> 00:46:41,987
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

713
00:46:46,551 --> 00:46:47,852
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true, Rob.

714
00:46:48,112 --> 00:46:50,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know you can import this into America?

715
00:46:50,632 --> 00:46:53,013
[SPEAKER_04]: The bundle for Seaman 2 for the PlayStation 2.

716
00:46:53,053 --> 00:46:58,275
[SPEAKER_04]: The full title, Seaman 2 Peking Engine Ikusi Kit is coming out this week.

717
00:46:58,335 --> 00:47:00,676
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to cost you 90 bucks if you want to import that sucker.

718
00:47:00,876 --> 00:47:03,677
[SPEAKER_04]: But that comes with a microphone so you can yell at your Seaman.

719
00:47:04,297 --> 00:47:04,697
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it?

720
00:47:05,017 --> 00:47:05,357
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

721
00:47:05,837 --> 00:47:06,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never played that.

722
00:47:08,118 --> 00:47:12,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Seaman, first of all, when it came out over here, it was narrated by Leonard Nimoy and that was really cool.

723
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,280
[SPEAKER_06]: You start off with these

724
00:47:15,279 --> 00:47:18,880
[SPEAKER_06]: These eggs, and you grow them into tadpoles, and they eventually grow human faces.

725
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:24,322
[SPEAKER_06]: And you... Wait a minute, wait a minute.

726
00:47:25,602 --> 00:47:27,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that kind of like the other kind of Seaman?

727
00:47:27,883 --> 00:47:28,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that too?

728
00:47:28,823 --> 00:47:30,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Allow me to continue.

729
00:47:31,204 --> 00:47:32,264
[SPEAKER_04]: I grant thee permission.

730
00:47:33,464 --> 00:47:35,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone take the mic away from Rob.

731
00:47:37,425 --> 00:47:40,826
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I like having two mics now, because I can tell Rob to STFU.

732
00:47:41,967 --> 00:47:42,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Continue, I want... Anyway.

733
00:47:43,187 --> 00:47:43,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

734
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:48,827
[SPEAKER_06]: So they speak this own little nonsense language and you talk to them.

735
00:47:49,728 --> 00:47:54,290
[SPEAKER_06]: And eventually they start talking back and they build their vocabulary as you talk to them.

736
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:57,952
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they start speaking in this distinguished sort of posh British accent.

737
00:48:00,233 --> 00:48:06,896
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have conversations with them and they ask you questions and then they remember the things that you've answered.

738
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:15,705
[SPEAKER_06]: and they ask you your birthday and you speak back and forth to them and you monitor their habitat, make sure that the water is right, feed them every day.

739
00:48:16,486 --> 00:48:17,886
[SPEAKER_06]: But eventually they start eating each other.

740
00:48:20,708 --> 00:48:23,170
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, it's fantastic.

741
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:25,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Or like one will die or something.

742
00:48:25,591 --> 00:48:28,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, okay, so it's like Pokemon and the Sims combined.

743
00:48:29,353 --> 00:48:30,154
[SPEAKER_06]: But you talk to them.

744
00:48:30,654 --> 00:48:32,956
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're teaching them to say damn fucking shit.

745
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:33,076
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

746
00:48:33,136 --> 00:48:33,256
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

747
00:48:34,342 --> 00:48:35,103
[SPEAKER_06]: They have everything.

748
00:48:35,143 --> 00:48:37,024
[SPEAKER_06]: It's programmed in, but it's very interesting.

749
00:48:37,144 --> 00:48:41,767
[SPEAKER_04]: How has this game not shown up on my radar in the years that we've been doing Orange Lounge Radio?

750
00:48:41,827 --> 00:48:43,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Five and a half years and I've never heard of this game.

751
00:48:43,828 --> 00:48:44,249
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell?

752
00:48:44,269 --> 00:48:44,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to borrow mine?

753
00:48:45,269 --> 00:48:45,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

754
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:47,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a working VMU?

755
00:48:49,152 --> 00:48:49,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I do.

756
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:50,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

757
00:48:50,813 --> 00:48:51,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have my chow.

758
00:48:51,654 --> 00:48:53,095
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the Dreamcast hooked up in the garage.

759
00:48:53,395 --> 00:48:54,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I can play Seaman all night long.

760
00:48:56,197 --> 00:48:56,697
[SPEAKER_06]: At any rate...

761
00:48:59,306 --> 00:49:02,208
[SPEAKER_06]: As you progress through the game, you have another tank that's a terrarium.

762
00:49:02,609 --> 00:49:09,775
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're actually growing another environment, and after a while, your seaman's going to start floundering around and start turning into a cocoon.

763
00:49:13,398 --> 00:49:14,679
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't stop laughing!

764
00:49:14,699 --> 00:49:17,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to take the mic from Rob!

765
00:49:18,803 --> 00:49:25,249
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you eventually move the cocoon into the terrarium, and it hatches into a frogman.

766
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,422
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he leaves, and the game is over.

767
00:49:30,943 --> 00:49:35,226
[SPEAKER_02]: See, and then in the sequel game, you actually, your guy turns into a caveman.

768
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:38,929
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, thus the cycle starts all over again.

769
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:40,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about it.

770
00:49:42,572 --> 00:49:45,174
[SPEAKER_05]: So he turns into a caveman, so he can do Geico commercials.

771
00:49:46,815 --> 00:49:48,856
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a series about that now.

772
00:49:49,297 --> 00:49:53,600
[SPEAKER_05]: And they sold that from Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer on Saturday Night Live.

773
00:49:53,956 --> 00:49:55,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Why'd y'all have to remind us about that show?

774
00:49:55,838 --> 00:49:57,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just when I purged it from my memory.

775
00:49:57,999 --> 00:49:59,100
[SPEAKER_06]: So, my turn, right?

776
00:49:59,581 --> 00:50:00,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you have more stuff?

777
00:50:00,221 --> 00:50:01,362
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I have more stuff, actually.

778
00:50:01,402 --> 00:50:02,883
[SPEAKER_04]: We got sidetracked by Seaman.

779
00:50:03,424 --> 00:50:05,485
[SPEAKER_04]: But the sequel to Seaman's coming out on the PlayStation 2.

780
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:10,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Galaxy Angel 2, Mugen Karunokagi is coming out.

781
00:50:10,349 --> 00:50:14,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea what the hell this game is, but you know it's cool because it's by a company called Broccoli.

782
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:18,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Broccoli did DigiCarrot.

783
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:19,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, very cool.

784
00:50:19,777 --> 00:50:20,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there you go.

785
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:22,639
[SPEAKER_04]: So, from the people who brought you DigiCarrot.

790
00:51:15,918 --> 00:51:16,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

00:51:24,284 --> 00:51:25,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't that already come out?

793
00:51:25,584 --> 00:51:28,306
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just getting Portal on Xbox 360?

794
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:29,606
Yeah.

795
00:51:29,626 --> 00:51:30,487
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just getting Portal.

796
00:51:31,027 --> 00:51:33,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just buy Portal and skip Half-Life altogether.

[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Tabula Rasa on PC, Team Fortress 2, The Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass, The Orange Box on Xbox 360.

798
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:45,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Why did they get an option of getting Portal?

799
00:51:46,474 --> 00:51:46,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

800
00:51:47,557 --> 00:51:48,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it might be a typo.

801
00:51:49,799 --> 00:51:52,280
[SPEAKER_04]: You can buy it standalone here, but only on the PC.

802

00:52:10,113 --> 00:52:10,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Yee.

809
00:52:11,534 --> 00:52:11,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

810
00:52:12,898 --> 00:52:22,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Something else that's coming out here pretty soon and unfortunately is the last in the long line of download content for Oblivion is the brand new Fighter Stronghold.

811
00:52:22,766 --> 00:52:30,212
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the same price as a Yaris Xbox Live Arcade game, but way better.

812
00:52:31,133 --> 00:52:38,859
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will be coming out, it's actually going to be free beginning on October 15th, but it's only free for a week.

813
00:52:39,879 --> 00:52:40,520
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to remember that.

814
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:41,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you download it.

815
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:49,254
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the last bit of download content you're going to see for Oblivion, so what a way to close it off for free.

816
00:52:50,594 --> 00:52:51,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here you go.

817
00:52:51,475 --> 00:52:57,838
[SPEAKER_04]: This show actually will go to its podcast form on the 15th, which is the way most people listen to the program, so go check Xbox Live.

818
00:52:57,858 --> 00:52:58,538
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be up now.

819
00:52:58,818 --> 00:53:00,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Friendly reminder from the folks here at OLR.

820
00:53:01,676 --> 00:53:06,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the other thing, here's some of the cool features, though, that the Fighter Stronghold comes with.

821
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:14,018
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get your own, I guess, Venter to create your own wines for you.

822
00:53:14,538 --> 00:53:19,059
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a combat trainer, a taxidermist to create trophies for your pad.

823
00:53:19,379 --> 00:53:20,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's cool.

824
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,280
[SPEAKER_02]: They also, I think there was some other stuff.

825
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:27,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you get this whole castle to run after you do a little quest to get.

826
00:53:28,181 --> 00:53:29,641
[SPEAKER_02]: So, fucking awesome.

827
00:53:30,049 --> 00:53:34,731
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be so cool to just fill my castle with a bunch of dead bears.

828
00:53:35,051 --> 00:53:37,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, how is Elder Scrolls V going to top Oblivion?

829
00:53:37,952 --> 00:53:38,492
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

830
00:53:38,652 --> 00:53:43,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like, Oblivion, I mean, this is literally saying, look, we're going to give you the kitchen sink in this game.

831
00:53:43,994 --> 00:53:44,894
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's everything.

832
00:53:45,054 --> 00:53:45,875
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.

833
00:53:46,175 --> 00:53:47,015
[SPEAKER_03]: It is amazing.

834
00:53:49,776 --> 00:53:50,616
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a video game, Chris.

835
00:53:50,636 --> 00:53:52,937
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't actually have to have real pets on your wall.

836
00:53:52,957 --> 00:53:55,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but it's only fun to kill the simpets.

837
00:53:57,279 --> 00:53:57,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris.

838
00:53:57,579 --> 00:53:58,560
[SPEAKER_03]: But still.

839
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,300
[SPEAKER_04]: You're so difficult to please.

840
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,220
[SPEAKER_03]: But in The Sims, you can't throw fireballs at things.

841
00:54:05,221 --> 00:54:06,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, look, I'll tell you what, Chris.

842
00:54:06,621 --> 00:54:10,682
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing funner in Oblivion than throwing fireballs at the sheep constantly.

843
00:54:11,323 --> 00:54:13,543
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they start to attack you.

844
00:54:14,243 --> 00:54:15,624
[SPEAKER_04]: They figure out you're a bad man.

845
00:54:16,564 --> 00:54:17,684
[SPEAKER_04]: If they live long enough.

846
00:54:18,144 --> 00:54:19,365
[SPEAKER_05]: That is awesome.

847
00:54:20,685 --> 00:54:21,985
[SPEAKER_05]: When sheep attack.

848
00:54:24,066 --> 00:54:24,866
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty bad.

849
00:54:25,566 --> 00:54:28,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, as was that joke.

850
00:54:31,063 --> 00:54:31,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

851
00:54:32,726 --> 00:54:36,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Sierra Online, also Vivendi Games, is part of that.

852
00:54:36,589 --> 00:54:42,454
[SPEAKER_04]: They have given us some more details about what is coming out on Xbox Live Arcade and PC through the rest of the year.

853
00:54:42,774 --> 00:54:47,399
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a third-person retro arcade shooter called Aces of the Galaxy.

854
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:50,061
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another title called Boogie Bunnies.

855
00:54:50,701 --> 00:54:54,445
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a game where players match rabbits in a match-three puzzle game.

856
00:54:54,785 --> 00:54:57,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are both coming out on the PC and Xbox Live Arcade.

857
00:54:57,828 --> 00:54:58,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Rabbit threesomes?

858
00:54:59,502 --> 00:55:01,984
[SPEAKER_04]: X-Box Live Arcade Shooter Assault Heroes Arcadian Warriors

859
00:55:19,808 --> 00:55:43,767
[SPEAKER_04]: and 33, Scar, Resurrection Ship, Exodus, and the one some people have been looking forward to or not looking forward to because it may bastardize what they know and love, Battlestar Galactica, where you can play as the humans or the Cylons, 16-player online gaming on the PC, 8 players on Xbox Live Arcade, even though the early reviews on that were mediocre at best, but, you know, they've had a long time since then.

860
00:55:43,787 --> 00:55:45,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that was an early version, so you never know.

861
00:55:45,929 --> 00:55:46,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, who knows?

862
00:55:46,789 --> 00:55:47,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be fair.

863
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:48,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Like time makes games better.

864
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:49,599
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't feel so bad now!

865
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:50,399
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have Doctor Who.

866
00:56:14,167 --> 00:56:20,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, anyone who cares, Speedball 2 is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade.

867
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:22,211
[SPEAKER_06]: I care, Jamie.

868
00:56:25,592 --> 00:56:32,275
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this is funny that it was referred to like this on Joystick, that it's like Calvin Ball.

869
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:34,856
[SPEAKER_06]: For anyone who reads Calvin and Hobbes.

870
00:56:35,817 --> 00:56:37,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Calvin Ball is the game where you make up your own rules.

871
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:39,418
[SPEAKER_06]: As you go.

872
00:56:39,779 --> 00:56:40,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I demand euphoria.

873
00:56:42,759 --> 00:57:10,785
[SPEAKER_02]: so yeah, Calvin Ball the game anyways let's see here for those who may not be into Calvin Ball there are some other tidbits on Xbox Live Marketplace that you might be interested in including a whole fucking ton of demos the Simpsons game is actually on there now definitely check it out I forgot I did play that this week awesome, awesome game if you're a Simpsons fan you're going to love it

874
00:57:11,422 --> 00:57:15,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Conan, which of course is based off the movie and comic series.

875
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:17,332
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's supposed to be very, very bloody.

876
00:57:17,653 --> 00:57:19,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't got a chance to play it yet.

877
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:19,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I will soon.

878
00:57:19,797 --> 00:57:20,278
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried it.

879
00:57:21,093 --> 00:57:23,234
[SPEAKER_03]: I could not understand the control system at all.

880
00:57:23,734 --> 00:57:24,394
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

881
00:57:24,654 --> 00:57:29,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I just hit, mash one button, swung my sword, and there was lots of blood, and I died a lot.

882
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:33,877
[SPEAKER_02]: But at least that's why they have demos, so you don't have to waste $60 to find that out.

883
00:57:34,917 --> 00:57:36,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Project Gotham Racing 4 is up there now.

884
00:57:37,117 --> 00:57:38,118
[SPEAKER_04]: I played that one.

885
00:57:38,218 --> 00:57:40,898
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty, it's fun, but I really suck at it.

886
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I cannot control the car for shit.

887
00:57:42,619 --> 00:57:47,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have not figured out, like, the only racing game I can control worth a damn besides Mario Kart is Burnout.

888
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:48,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, these other ones, I can't do it.

889
00:57:48,961 --> 00:57:50,081
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep crashing into walls.

890
00:57:50,561 --> 00:57:55,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I highly recommend, Rob, I swear you're going to love this game, Flat Out Ultimate Destruction.

891
00:57:55,985 --> 00:57:57,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I played the demo for that, too.

892
00:57:57,686 --> 00:57:57,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.

893
00:57:58,346 --> 00:58:00,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Based on your recommendation, I downloaded the demo for that.

894
00:58:00,347 --> 00:58:01,108
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of fun.

895
00:58:01,148 --> 00:58:07,392
[SPEAKER_04]: A little clunkier than Burnout for me, but I like the fact that when you ran people off the road, it actually told you who you just killed.

896
00:58:07,812 --> 00:58:08,493
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty fun.

897
00:58:08,573 --> 00:58:09,633
[SPEAKER_02]: And they get pissed off at you, too.

898
00:58:09,734 --> 00:58:09,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

899
00:58:10,374 --> 00:58:11,195
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was good.

900
00:58:11,315 --> 00:58:11,875
[SPEAKER_02]: That was good.

901
00:58:11,935 --> 00:58:13,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Ultimate Destruction.

902
00:58:13,236 --> 00:58:16,318
[SPEAKER_04]: And the majority of them were hot chicks that I was offing, so...

903
00:58:16,778 --> 00:58:17,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, babe.

904
00:58:17,139 --> 00:58:17,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Woohoo.

905
00:58:36,812 --> 00:58:45,315
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, Microsoft is cracking down on naughty, naughty, naughty, very naughty mottos that people have in their gamer tag.

906
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:50,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Not so much the tag itself, but you know how everybody on Xbox 360 gets a motto, a little line that they can have under their name?

907
00:58:51,477 --> 00:58:53,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for instance, mine is OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

908
00:58:54,158 --> 00:58:55,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to plug the site in very cheap ways.

909
00:58:55,959 --> 00:59:00,321
[SPEAKER_04]: So when people kick my ass at Halo, they'll go, hey, let's check out this guy's crappy podcast that he does with his friends.

910
00:59:00,821 --> 00:59:02,061
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, that's there.

911
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:03,302
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what you guys have for your mottos.

912
00:59:03,322 --> 00:59:04,362
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you have for your motto, Loki?

913
00:59:06,144 --> 00:59:06,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

914
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:07,866
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't remember?

915
00:59:08,487 --> 00:59:08,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

916
00:59:08,928 --> 00:59:10,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anybody... What's yours, puppy?

917
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:10,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember?

918
00:59:12,532 --> 00:59:13,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly... You know what?

919
00:59:13,694 --> 00:59:15,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I only made it a month ago and I don't remember it.

920
00:59:15,856 --> 00:59:17,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's really not important.

921
00:59:17,318 --> 00:59:20,662
[SPEAKER_02]: I think to be funny the first time, I think I had it so much fun.

922
00:59:21,163 --> 00:59:24,247
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think I just changed it to the website.

923
00:59:24,707 --> 00:59:24,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

924
00:59:25,419 --> 00:59:32,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one of our fellow independent podcasters found out the hard way that Microsoft is actually keeping an eye on those mottos.

925
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:37,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheapy D over at the CheapAssGamer, they're the guys that won the podcast award this year.

926
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:38,523
[SPEAKER_04]: So, good for them.

927
00:59:39,183 --> 00:59:44,764
[SPEAKER_04]: But they got banned from Xbox Live for a day for saying, Konichiwa, bitches, in their motto.

928
00:59:45,365 --> 00:59:53,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently Microsoft does not appreciate the word bitch, because poor Cheapy D. Yeah, they're offended by the word Konichiwa.

929
00:59:53,427 --> 00:59:53,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

930
00:59:56,155 --> 01:00:01,799
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's funny is that when I read that, I think of the Robins song, but maybe I'm just, I don't know, I'm crazy.

931
01:00:02,139 --> 01:00:08,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, also, another user on the site, an unnamed user, but I think I actually know who this might be if you listen to All Games Radio.

932
01:00:08,684 --> 01:00:11,946
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a person whose motto was, called the shit poop.

933
01:00:12,406 --> 01:00:13,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

934
01:00:36,064 --> 01:00:39,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my thing is I want to know what exactly does Microsoft consider offensive?

935
01:00:40,471 --> 01:00:42,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, the bans are just for a day.

936
01:00:42,654 --> 01:00:43,896
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's have a little fun with this.

937
01:00:43,916 --> 01:00:44,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's push the limits.

938
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:49,564
[SPEAKER_04]: So tonight I'm going to change my motto to fisting fan.

939
01:00:51,969 --> 01:00:56,052
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to see if anybody catches that that could be actually a pornographic thing.

940
01:00:56,272 --> 01:00:58,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I meant like karate fisting.

941
01:01:01,235 --> 01:01:06,159
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what happens.

942
01:01:07,459 --> 01:01:11,962
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to change my motto tonight to like I heart fisting or fisting fan or fan of fisting.

943
01:01:12,303 --> 01:01:14,464
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to see if that will get by the censors.

944
01:01:14,664 --> 01:01:15,465
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see what happens.

945
01:01:18,187 --> 01:01:21,649
[SPEAKER_06]: One of Dan's friends, his gamer tag

946
01:01:22,424 --> 01:01:29,026
[SPEAKER_06]: is, um, uh, okay, I have to think of how he has it, um, DuckMySock.

947
01:01:31,807 --> 01:01:43,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, apparently, um, one of the listeners over at All Games, Flaming Bozo is reporting, uh, one of the other listeners at All Games, Buck Fush, is his nickname, Buck Fush got banned for a day because his motto said Bush Plan 9-11.

948
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:46,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, that was a no-no.

949
01:01:46,711 --> 01:01:51,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

950
01:01:51,092 --> 01:01:51,432
Seriously, my girl?

951
01:01:52,987 --> 01:01:54,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, Microsoft, who cares?

952
01:01:55,068 --> 01:01:56,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Loki, a seat now, good.

953
01:01:57,089 --> 01:01:57,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this.

954
01:01:57,570 --> 01:02:02,152
[SPEAKER_04]: The chatroom is coming up with things that are questionably offensive for us to put in our mottos.

955
01:02:02,432 --> 01:02:05,114
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Loki, you're going to use this one from Takeo Rei, okay?

956
01:02:05,474 --> 01:02:07,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Dirty Sanchez is all around.

957
01:02:09,937 --> 01:02:12,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you change your motto to that and see if you get banned for a day?

958
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:14,299
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a day.

959
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:15,940
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just one day.

960
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:17,061
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go without Halo for a day.

961
01:02:17,081 --> 01:02:18,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get banned for other reasons, but...

962
01:02:20,134 --> 01:02:22,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Son of Dad's new motto says, Halo soaks cork.

963
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:37,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisbee says, buy a Wii.

964
01:02:38,766 --> 01:02:40,767
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have an Xbox in my garage.

965
01:02:40,787 --> 01:02:41,528
[SPEAKER_05]: This is on Xbox, right?

966
01:02:41,548 --> 01:02:41,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

967
01:02:42,168 --> 01:02:42,748
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's 360.

968
01:02:42,848 --> 01:02:43,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, 360, okay.

969
01:02:43,869 --> 01:02:46,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Megsie's got one, but she doesn't have time to play because she's stuttering for finals.

970
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:53,493
[SPEAKER_05]: But can someone in chat, for me, or anyone who's listening, like, who wants to actually participate, add something to the lesbian?

971
01:02:53,873 --> 01:02:55,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, like, I like dykes or something.

972
01:02:56,134 --> 01:02:56,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Carpet muncher.

973
01:02:56,974 --> 01:02:57,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Carpet muncher.

974
01:02:59,135 --> 01:02:59,675
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you know?

975
01:02:59,735 --> 01:03:00,636
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be my cat.

976
01:03:01,221 --> 01:03:01,481
That's true.

977
01:03:01,501 --> 01:03:02,881
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a special time, Rob.

978
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Color of Sakura is going to change his motto to save the rug doctor.

979
01:03:33,824 --> 01:03:34,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God, yes.

980
01:03:35,166 --> 01:03:36,027
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

981
01:03:37,068 --> 01:03:41,613
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to start a thread in the forums for questionable mottos that get caught by Microsoft.

982
01:03:41,913 --> 01:03:43,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that would be funny.

983
01:03:43,675 --> 01:03:46,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody start that up, orangejohnsradio.com, forums.

984
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:48,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Plug, plug.

985
01:03:48,578 --> 01:03:51,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, like, have one that says, like, I want a fag, or something like that.

986
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but fag means cigarette, right?

987
01:03:53,181 --> 01:03:53,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

988
01:03:53,681 --> 01:03:54,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here's the thing.

989
01:03:54,842 --> 01:03:58,004
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get banned for reels, like, permanently, though, you can't blame us, okay?

990
01:03:58,064 --> 01:04:02,988
[SPEAKER_04]: You're doing this at your own, because I don't want no, like, lawsuit, like, oh, those assholes on Oregon Radio told me to change my mind.

991
01:04:03,028 --> 01:04:04,449
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're doing it for yourself, okay?

992
01:04:05,189 --> 01:04:08,011
[SPEAKER_05]: But we really appreciate it, so give it to pure pleasure.

993
01:04:08,932 --> 01:04:10,453
[SPEAKER_04]: But only cool kids do it.

994
01:04:10,473 --> 01:04:11,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Segment.

995
01:04:14,015 --> 01:04:14,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, yes.

996
01:04:15,036 --> 01:04:15,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

997
01:04:15,696 --> 01:04:16,857
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a segment coming up now.

998
01:04:19,065 --> 01:04:21,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're over an hour now, so it's time for Part A to finish up.

999
01:04:21,686 --> 01:04:30,167
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know we like to close out Part A here at Orange Lounge Radio by respecting our elders and paying tribute to a classic video game.

1000
01:04:30,508 --> 01:04:33,528
[SPEAKER_04]: It's DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week.

1001
01:04:33,548 --> 01:04:37,549
[SPEAKER_04]: So DarkSakura, what game should all the kids be putting in their Gamefly queues right now?

1002
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:44,170
[SPEAKER_06]: The Classic Game of the Week.

1003
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:47,451
[SPEAKER_06]: For all of you awesome people who own a Saturn.

1004
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:55,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Magical Night's Dream Cotton Boomerang, which is a fantastic game.

1005
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Cotton Boomerang is actually...

1006
01:05:00,007 --> 01:05:01,888
[SPEAKER_06]: A Saturn port of Cotton 2.

1007
01:05:02,689 --> 01:05:09,954
[SPEAKER_06]: So actually, if you've got MAME, you can play the game on your emulator, and it'll run just fine.

1008
01:05:10,054 --> 01:05:17,579
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was basically going back to the original Cotton, the way that it worked, as being a side-scrolling shooter with extra fun.

1009
01:05:17,779 --> 01:05:20,641
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know I've talked about Panorama Cotton and Rainbow Cotton a lot.

1010
01:05:21,382 --> 01:05:26,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are sort of special in the series, in the fact that they are...

1011
01:05:27,003 --> 01:05:30,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Behind the Character View, and they're actually kind of hard to play.

1012
01:05:30,584 --> 01:05:44,448
[SPEAKER_06]: But Cotton Boomerang is completely side-scroller with lovely animation for the levels, but you also get pretty much unlimited magic, and you get all these different skill items that you can use in the game.

1013
01:05:44,888 --> 01:05:49,350
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite item in this game is this big ball of fire.

1014
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:53,671
[SPEAKER_06]: And what you do with the big ball of fire is you bounce it.

1015
01:05:54,777 --> 01:06:10,801
[SPEAKER_06]: and you actually will have lines of enemies that come at you and you can bounce the ball at and it'll just knock out completely lines of you know complete lines of enemies and the cool thing about the Cotton series though is that there was also this collector um thing that if you got different um

1016
01:06:11,937 --> 01:06:14,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Cotton Games, like Panorama Cotton was one.

1017
01:06:14,498 --> 01:06:19,561
[SPEAKER_06]: And keep in mind, they only made something about 600 copies in this game.

1018
01:06:20,121 --> 01:06:25,604
[SPEAKER_06]: And there were only 300 of these tea mugs, tea cups that they issued out.

1019
01:06:25,904 --> 01:06:29,126
[SPEAKER_06]: There was one with the original cotton version.

1020
01:06:29,746 --> 01:06:31,087
[SPEAKER_06]: There was the Panorama Cotton one.

1021
01:06:31,107 --> 01:06:35,509
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Cotton 2 cup, but they don't know how many of them are out in circulation.

1022
01:06:35,529 --> 01:06:37,670
[SPEAKER_06]: But these are like lots of money now, anyway.

1023
01:06:39,345 --> 01:06:48,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, for anyone who wants to play any of the Cotton games, if you've got a Neo Geo Pocket Color, and I think it actually came out on DS, I want to say.

1024
01:06:49,593 --> 01:06:51,134
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also a Super Nintendo version.

1025
01:06:51,154 --> 01:06:57,779
[SPEAKER_06]: They did release Cotton on a number of systems, but I'd have to say of the side scrollers, the best of them is Cotton 2.

1026
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:01,923
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just really, really a lot of fun.

1027
01:07:03,324 --> 01:07:05,946
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love that in the bonus stages, we pick up teacups.

1028
01:07:07,276 --> 01:07:11,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I just like the concept of a side-scrolling shooter game starring witches flying on brooms.

1029
01:07:11,881 --> 01:07:13,302
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just kind of rad and original.

1030
01:07:13,463 --> 01:07:20,970
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole story behind it is that Cotton is this little witch girl who's addicted to this candy called Willow that makes her throw up.

1031
01:07:22,832 --> 01:07:27,037
[SPEAKER_06]: And she rescues... Kind of like how I'm addicted to crack.

1032
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:28,879
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me throw up too.

1033
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:29,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

1034
01:07:30,513 --> 01:07:35,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, um, and she rescues this, um, fairy, oh, this fairy named Silk comes to get her help.

1035
01:07:35,776 --> 01:07:36,496
[SPEAKER_06]: That's her, by the way.

1036
01:07:37,437 --> 01:07:41,219
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a sexy mama that comes up there on the little stage selection screen.

1037
01:07:41,739 --> 01:07:43,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that Cotton's lesbian lover?

1038
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:44,140
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that?

1039
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:45,321
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the fairy Silk.

1040
01:07:46,181 --> 01:07:56,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, of course, there has to be some gratuitous... And the whole point of this game is that, and the whole reason that the character is participating in this adventure at all is because either she wants candy...

1041
01:07:57,967 --> 01:08:09,696
[SPEAKER_06]: or someone is threatening her supply of candy and she's only doing it for the candy, she could give a shit about the trials and tribulations of the land she's rescuing because she wants candy.

1042
01:08:09,996 --> 01:08:10,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Is she single?

1043
01:08:11,597 --> 01:08:13,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably.

1044
01:08:14,099 --> 01:08:15,180
[SPEAKER_04]: She's also a little girl.

1045
01:08:16,661 --> 01:08:19,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Cotton is a little girl.

1046
01:08:21,084 --> 01:08:22,245
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a very little girl.

1047
01:08:23,066 --> 01:08:24,587
[SPEAKER_05]: The graphics are just awesome.

1048
01:08:24,647 --> 01:08:26,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob's got something on YouTube.

1049
01:08:26,782 --> 01:08:32,344
[SPEAKER_05]: This, yeah, this, yeah, video one, and it's pretty much showing what the game is looking like.

1050
01:08:32,704 --> 01:08:34,345
[SPEAKER_05]: And the graphics, how old is this game?

1051
01:08:34,685 --> 01:08:35,866
[SPEAKER_06]: This came out on the Sega Saturn.

1052
01:08:35,906 --> 01:08:37,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I do believe, The graphics are awesome!

1053
01:08:37,906 --> 01:08:40,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I do, I do want to say that this game came out in 95?

1054
01:08:41,008 --> 01:08:44,089
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say.

1055
01:08:44,489 --> 01:08:44,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1056
01:08:44,689 --> 01:08:47,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, yeah, the Saturn in Japan came out when, 93, Rob?

1057
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:54,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, no, it came out in 94 because my, um, my, I had just started college, and my friend imported a Saturn that year.

1058
01:08:55,153 --> 01:08:55,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

1059
01:08:55,879 --> 01:09:04,274
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I want to say that Cotton Boomerang came out in 95, and it's, you know, for anyone who's a fan of 2D shooters, this game is gorgeous.

1060
01:09:04,655 --> 01:09:05,216
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, really.

1061
01:09:05,236 --> 01:09:05,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it really is.

1062
01:09:06,418 --> 01:09:07,741
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a ton of fun.

1063
01:09:08,533 --> 01:09:16,600
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd say anyone who's got MAME or the equivalent, if you want to play it on one of your emulators, you'll find it as Cotton 2.

1064
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,842
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you've got a Saturn, find this game if you can.

1065
01:09:19,902 --> 01:09:21,103
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really a ton of fun.

1066
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:26,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can say that I have played through Cotton 2, or Cotton Boomerang, and it's really great.

1067
01:09:26,608 --> 01:09:27,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't actually own it myself.

1068
01:09:28,549 --> 01:09:34,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Cotton Boomerang or Cotton 2 is the classic game of the week, as judged by DarkSakura.

1069
01:09:34,912 --> 01:09:35,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

1070
01:09:35,312 --> 01:09:36,033
[SPEAKER_04]: This game looks like fun.

1071
01:09:36,053 --> 01:09:38,035
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually thinking I want to check that out too at some point.

1072
01:09:38,095 --> 01:09:39,055
[SPEAKER_04]: So, very cool.

1073
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:40,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm liking this new segment.

1074
01:09:41,117 --> 01:09:41,838
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys think?

1075
01:09:41,898 --> 01:09:44,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to send us an email.

1076
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:50,284
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a suggestion, a game that Jamie needs to check out to consider for the segment, even though I think you have like your next month and a half already picked out.

1077
01:09:51,305 --> 01:09:55,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I make sure to pick them out ahead of time.

1078
01:09:56,297 --> 01:09:57,918
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dirtetsia, thank you.

1079
01:09:58,139 --> 01:10:03,403
[SPEAKER_06]: He posted a link to the Panorama Cotton Mega Drive one that has the teacup with it.

1080
01:10:03,823 --> 01:10:06,726
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually do know somebody who has a copy of Panorama Cotton.

1081
01:10:06,746 --> 01:10:14,832
[SPEAKER_06]: If anybody wants to have a headache, then go on YouTube and look at... Well, actually, Panorama Cotton, I've played on the Genesis Emulator, but my friend owns a legit copy.

1082
01:10:15,853 --> 01:10:19,036
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is fun, but Rainbow Cotton was really fun, too.

1083
01:10:19,116 --> 01:10:20,137
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the Dreamcast version.

1084
01:10:20,477 --> 01:10:21,758
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same type of game.

1085
01:10:22,419 --> 01:10:22,699
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1086
01:10:23,186 --> 01:10:26,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's going to do it for Orange Lounge Radio, this Part A of our podcast.

1087
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:35,020
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't worry, we're going to be right back with Part B. And in Part B tonight, we're being joined by Craig Howard and Ben Ward from Bizarre Creations.

1088
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,683
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be here to talk about Geometry Wars Galaxies.

1089
01:10:38,143 --> 01:10:41,327
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be right back with Part B of our show.

1090
01:10:45,029 --> 01:10:45,469
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1091
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:13,971
[SPEAKER_04]: I made a bad boo-boo when I was late.

1092
01:11:32,176 --> 01:11:44,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I made myself look very unprofessional, but I'll tell you more about that in part B. For those of you guys listening on OrangeLawnsRadio.com, you're getting some music, specifically tonight, some of the music from the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 3 soundtrack.

1093
01:11:44,982 --> 01:11:49,003
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't drive right now, because you might drive really, really fast to this music.

1094
01:11:49,023 --> 01:11:50,164
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be right back in about 10 minutes.
