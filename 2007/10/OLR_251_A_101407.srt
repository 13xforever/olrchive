Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Mojo!

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tonight, October 14th, 2007, Nintendo unveils holiday news that includes a dreaded delay,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Elder Scrolls Oblivion gets one last hurrah, and we're joined by members of Bizarre Creations

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
to talk about Geometry Wars Galaxy.

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We sound a little dead, it's because this is now our third time trying to record the show, and Jamie has-

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Wait, wait a minute, this was empty a minute ago and now it's full again.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This is Mountain Dew gamer feel that Chris brought for Dark Sakura.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's like cocaine.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What does it taste like?

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The taste is like sort of like orange cream soda, but the first taste of it is sort of like very orange-y fruit punch,

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and the aftertaste of it is cream soda.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Interesting.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's fairly accurate, wouldn't you say?

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It tastes like butt. No, I don't know, I didn't like it so much.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Kind of.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Also joining us tonight, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Hello, since his mic cord does not reach.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No, it's fine.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I think they're speaking in two microphones.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No, I don't need to speak in two microphones.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay, the problem we're having tonight, folks, is that we're down to two microphones.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The microphone that Loki usually uses died while we were trying to tape live here on this lovely Sunday evening,

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
so Loki's mic is gone.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So now we're having to share between the five people who are in studio tonight, two microphones.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So we apologize if there's any audio delays or audio slowing or other audio issues,

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
but this is what happens when you do live radio, folks.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
When things break, you don't have much time to fix it.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So Loki's over there.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So yes, Dark Sakura.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You should put on cam the thing that I gave you today.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I gave it to my room.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You're mean.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I will go get it during a story later, but it's Tengen Fantasy Zone on the NES, the classic Game of the Week last week.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Very good.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We'll all be seeing what Dark Sakura picked for her Game of the Week this week a little later.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't have $100, though, to buy you the game for this week.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's all right.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We'll get to that in a little bit.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Anyhow, let's introduce our guests who are here in studio for the madness tonight

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and the third time we're getting to our show.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Say hello once again to Puppy.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Hello.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And what's ironic is Puppy came back tonight because he didn't get to talk too much last week.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And now that we're down another microphone, he probably won't get to talk much tonight at all.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So give it up for Puppy while you can, everybody.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm an attention whore, so say hi to me or whatever.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Ask me questions.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Or talk to me.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What is your name?

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
My name is Black Lab.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What is your quest?

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Ultimate power.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What is the airspeed velocity of a swallow...

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
No, forget it.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
God, you guys are crazy.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Is it African or European swallow?

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I don't know that.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Wow.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Anyhow, let's also say hello to a very special guest.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I was surprised.

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I didn't even know she was coming tonight.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's Chris, everybody.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Surprise, butt sex!

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Wow.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Sorry, I got to keep my voice down because it's the acoustics in this room.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's all right.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Kind of interesting.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And Chris is one of the official lesbians of Orange Lounge Radio.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And I'm actually surprised to see her back because I was thinking you were going to be flying to Wisconsin soon, right?

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh, well, I went to GeekCon last week, but that was only for a week.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And in March I am officially moving to Wisconsin for my school career.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Jamie's helping me.

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I am leaving.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I am going into U-Haul with Chris and I'm leaving.

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
She's coming back.

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I am not. Shut up.

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm kidding.

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I was trying to be funny.

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Oh, okay.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm sorry. I failed at it.

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I failed.

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Fail!

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You're not doing it right.

90
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You're not doing it right.

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So I'm trying to hang out with you guys as much as possible.

92
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
All right.

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Well, it's all good. We're glad to have you here.

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And thank you to Chris for unlocking the explicit tag on tonight's program.

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Sorry.

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
There you go.

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
All right.

98
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I do that.

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
All right.

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Anyhow, let's start off with how was your gaming week and we'll take it over to DarkSakura.

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
How was your gaming week?

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It was Ragnarok and it was lots of Ragnarok.

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I deleted a character and restarted one and I got two of them past job 50 and I played a lot.

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And I looked at your copy of Every Extend Extra and couldn't find the PSP.

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Wow.

106
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You accomplished a lot.

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And I bought a game and I gave it to you.

108
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes.

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Fantasy Zone.

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And then I don't have an old school Nintendo to play it on.

111
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But I have three.

112
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Sweet.

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I will lend you one.

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yay.

115
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Maybe our top loader.

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That would be cool because then I won't have to go to get games to play.

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Oh, yeah.

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Damn it.

119
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
All right.

120
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Puppy, since you have the mic, how was your gaming week?

121
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
We'll have to do a different order because of the audio issues tonight.

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
How was your gaming week, Puppy?

123
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I spent too much time playing Halo again.

124
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But then I also spent the rest of it beta testing the new stuff on WoW that's coming

125
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
out in a couple weeks.

126
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Don't forget, even with that mic you had to get really close.

127
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
There you go.

128
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I have to watch the green lines.

129
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I want big lines.

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So, Halo.

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Lots of Halo.

132
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah.

133
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Halo and WoW.

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What's your ratio in Halo?

135
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
More than one.

136
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's good.

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Mine is less than 0.75.

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That's bad.

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I think I'm like 1.6.

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Oh, wow.

141
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That's pretty good.

142
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I know.

143
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm not that good, though.

144
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I still suck on occasion.

145
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
All right.

146
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Well, let's move on.

147
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Chris, how was your gaming week?

148
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Wow.

149
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It was fun.

150
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Megzi finally caved in thanks to peer pressure to get World of Warcraft.

151
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And she bought me an account for a month.

152
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So I've been kind of trying to use that up as much as possible to try to make it worth

153
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
my while.

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So I've been playing a lot of that and dying a lot, which is always a favorite pastime.

155
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Well, honey, Mac.

156
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So, virtual PC.

157
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Virtual PC doesn't let...

158
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't have...

159
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Well, it works on Mac.

160
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I just don't have that much room on my...

161
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I think that Ragnarok would run on a 486.

162
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Because it was probably created on one.

163
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I like my dancing blood elves.

164
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That's okay.

165
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Dancing blood elves are fun.

166
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And good for you being Horde.

167
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yes.

168
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
For the Horde.

169
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
For the Alliance.

170
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Do Draenei.

171
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Who Alliance?

172
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Draenei are okay.

173
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I can do Draenei.

174
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay.

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Because they speak like Russians.

176
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That's kind of cool.

177
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That's enough rage.

178
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Loki.

179
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

180
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It was good.

181
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I played...

182
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Let's see what I play here.

183
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Halo 3.

184
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I've gotten actually a little bit further in Legendary.

185
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Now I'm, I think, on the 5th chapter or whatever.

186
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
5 out of 10.

187
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Halfway through the game.

188
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So it's doing pretty good.

189
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I just have no idea how the hell I'm going to finish the last part of the game.

190
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Because that's where the difficulty really ramped up.

191
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And then, let's see.

192
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Of course, more Saints Row multiplayer.

193
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That's fun now because we've been playing in the Ultra Dome.

194
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And we've been trying to jump cars to the top tier.

195
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And actually have been quite successful at that.

196
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So now it's who can get to the top tier the quickest.

197
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And then try to survive without getting hit by rockets.

198
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's fun.

199
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And then, let's see.

200
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I've also been playing Half Life 2, the Orange Box.

201
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Mainly Portal on that.

202
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And that's pretty fun.

203
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I was hoping someone on the show called Orange Lounge Radio would have been playing the Orange Box this week.

204
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Because I know it wasn't me.

205
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Although I think I might have to get it.

206
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So how is Orange Box?

207
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's awesome.

208
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Does it give Orange a good name when we trash it constantly every week?

209
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It is the worst box art I've ever seen.

210
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But it's cool, I guess.

211
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I mean the game itself is pretty good.

212
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I haven't really touched much of the other parts of the game.

213
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You know, all other total 5 games on there.

214
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Just mainly Portal.

215
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But Portal is fun.

216
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And, I don't know.

217
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Just kind of playing through that a little bit.

218
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Then, watching my wife play Puzzle Quest on, you know, the 360.

219
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Which is, you know, just like Puzzle Quest on everything else.

220
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And then, I played the Yaris game.

221
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
God, what the fuck?

222
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't even know.

223
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's free, but I feel like I'm being ripped off.

224
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's, you know, seriously.

225
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Just because it's, I understand why it's free, because there's no way anyone would pay for that shit.

226
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I just, it was, it reminded me of like, was it Sonic the Hedgehog 2?

227
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Like the bonus stages and that.

228
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Except really crappy and made no sense.

229
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And it was just stupid.

230
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It was horrible.

231
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I tried playing that too.

232
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I downloaded it and played like about 10 minutes of it and got confused.

233
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Because it's like, your car has like a tentacle that shoots lasers.

234
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And you have to shoot like flying bird, box birds and toasters or something like that.

235
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You said the best thing ever.

236
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Tentacles that shoot lasers.

237
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
No, I know.

238
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You would think this would be the perfect game, right?

239
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
A car with a tentacle that shoots laser beams at things.

240
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
How fucking rad is that?

241
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yet, somehow this game manages to fuck it up for free.

242
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
By the way, I will not be buying a Yaris because of this game.

243
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm just telling you that much.

244
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
If I had thought about that, you know, see this is the thing now.

245
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Every time someone thinks about Yaris, they're going to think, man, that sucked.

246
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So, thank you, you have now associated suck with Yaris.

247
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I thought they did that already.

248
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
They've just driven that home now.

249
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Alright, so thumbs down on the Yaris game.

250
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yeah, it's not worth free.

251
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It definitely is not worth free.

252
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah, I still want a Prius.

253
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I want my time back.

254
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Alright, my gaming week.

255
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Folks, today, today was a good day.

256
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You know why today was a good day?

257
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I now have a level 70 druid in Warcraft.

258
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I dinged 70 today.

259
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Hold on, everybody.

260
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I want my grats.

261
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Here we go.

262
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Ding.

263
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Wait, where's my grats?

264
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Ding.

265
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Grats.

266
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
There you go.

267
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Thank you.

268
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
God, you guys need training.

269
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Alright.

270
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And you're going to call yourselves WoW players.

271
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm not a WoW player.

272
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Fuck that shit.

273
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
These two are.

274
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I was forced into exile from my dead PC and my butthead husband who won't build me a new one.

275
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So you know what, I'm taking matters into my own hands and I'm playing Guild Wars.

276
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Grats.

277
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Alright.

278
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So I hit.

279
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Hey, that's not bad.

280
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
20s part way 70.

281
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Alright, anyway.

282
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So I did that.

283
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Hooray.

284
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm officially an addict.

285
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And then I also played Puzzle Quest on Xbox Live with the tiniest text ever.

286
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You can definitely tell this game is a port from another system, namely the DS.

287
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And I don't know, for me, the mechanics of the game work a little well on the DS.

288
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But it is kind of fun to be able to play the game humongous, the game itself, not the text,

289
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
on the TV.

290
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Just kind of kick back, play on the TV.

291
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And it does have the Xbox Live element, which is kind of cool.

292
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But I do think the DS is a slightly better version if you're not going to be doing a

293
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
lot of the Xbox Live battling.

294
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Just because you can read the text a little better, the interface works better when you

295
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
don't have to use the control pad to move to the block you want and then hit the button

296
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
to switch.

297
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You can just use the stylus to swap the bricks.

298
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It works a lot easier.

299
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But otherwise, Puzzle Quest itself is a great game.

300
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It took Bejeweled and made it like 100 times better by adding this whole competitive element

301
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
to it.

302
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So I was very happy with that.

303
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But one thing to the Xbox Live's credit, it costs about half as much as the DS version.

304
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And for an arcade title, for an Xbox Live arcade title, especially considering it came

305
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
out the same week as Yaris, it's definitely one of the better things you can download

306
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
on Xbox Live Arcade.

307
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So if you don't have a DS and you like puzzlers at all, I definitely recommend you check out

308
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Puzzle Quest.

309
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
But if you have a DS, maybe it's worth it to pay the extra 10, 15 bucks so you can have

310
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
the game on the go and have the better controls.

311
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So that's Puzzle Quest in a nutshell.

312
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And then I also played the Yaris game and I was like, WTF.

313
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
LOL.

314
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
BBQ.

315
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
All right.

316
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What else did you play, Chris?

317
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I played Dungeons and Dragons.

318
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Nerd.

319
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And I converted nerd.

320
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I attacked the darkness.

321
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
No, no, no.

322
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I went to GeekCon in Madison, Wisconsin last week and they had a Dungeons and Dragons table

323
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
in the RPG room and it was said for beginners and I'm an experienced player, so I just wanted

324
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
to go in there for the gameplay and maybe help out.

325
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The guy looked at me, like brought in my three core books, my like 75 characters, and he

326
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
looked so intimidated at me.

327
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
He's like, oh, you play.

328
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm like, yeah.

329
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
This is the only D&D game in this entire convention.

330
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Let's play.

331
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
No, he didn't know.

332
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
He was like, uh.

333
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Let's rock it.

334
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And he basically, there were so many people that showed up to that game.

335
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
He's like, all right, can you run a game?

336
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm like, yeah.

337
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And I ended up converting like three other people.

338
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Cool.

339
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yeah, it was awesome.

340
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
D&D is kind of the roots of video gaming in a way.

341
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I mean, modern RPGs.

342
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah, Meg Z's friends.

343
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm teaching them how to play, and they all have played all the RPGs, Final Fantasy, World

344
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
of Warcraft, so they're really good at it.

345
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But you're still a hardcore nerd for being into that.

346
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

347
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Damn.

348
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
All right.

349
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Going to our chat room.

350
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
See that webcam?

351
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Damn right.

353
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Look at that dice right here.

354
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
This is where our chatters always are.

355
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We're going to start off tonight with NM64 says, Skye, if the text, speaking of Puzzle

356
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Quest, is a port of a DS version, how can the text be small?

357
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Wouldn't it be like five times bigger along with the rest of the screen?

358
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That's what you'd think, but for whatever reason they, you know, certainly they upscaled

359
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
the graphics.

360
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,800
You're not going to look at like pixelated stuff, okay?

361
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,940
It is HD graphics.

362
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,400
The game looks very nice and has a good art style.

363
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,880
But for whatever reason, they brought in text the size of the DS resolution.

364
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
I have no idea.

365
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,180
I would think that it would be a port of the PSP version since it's in a similar aspect

366
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,180
ratio.

367
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,180
Perhaps it is.

368
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,180
I don't know.

369
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,840
I haven't played the PSP version, so it's hard for me to say.

370
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,440
But that would make sense.

371
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,680
But I hope the text in the PSP version isn't that small because you need frickin', it was

372
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,760
like a monocle to read it.

373
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,760
I don't know.

374
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
A magnifying glass.

375
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,760
Crazy.

376
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
Fucking monocle.

377
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
That's right.

378
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,760
You need a fucking monocle.

379
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,760
All right.

380
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
The NDA 4.0 is going to suck.

381
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Why?

382
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,760
I heard they're making it like Warcraft.

383
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
It is.

384
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,760
And you know what the problem is?

385
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,760
It's worse.

386
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,800
Because instead of them like running around and doing stuff, it's little figures that

387
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,760
you have on the mat and they just move forward.

388
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,660
Are Chinese people going to be farming for gold in D&D 4.0 as well?

389
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,660
No idea.

390
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,660
All right.

391
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,320
Well, those little figurines were cool when they were on their own separate game because

392
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,080
they had those D&D figurines for a few years now.

393
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,800
I used to collect them for my roommates.

394
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,320
Is that like Warhammer?

395
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
I am a nerd.

396
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,960
Are those like Warhammer things?

397
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,960
Kind of.

398
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
But like the little figures?

399
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,640
And you used the hex charts to move them around and all that crap?

400
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,240
Well, it wasn't a hex chart, it was just little squares.

401
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,240
Squares.

402
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,520
You know, you had little characters.

403
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,560
The guy who runs our game actually uses...

404
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,920
The guy who runs the game that I'm in actually uses a hex map and little figurines.

405
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,920
Fuck that.

406
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,320
It's, you know, it's fuck the hex maps.

407
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,720
It's all about if they survive the fall down the stairs, they win.

408
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,760
That is, just flick those little things off the stairs and they fly and...

409
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,800
Well, I have a suggestion.

410
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,600
How about we move off of D&D?

411
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,760
No disrespect, but we do want to move on with the show, because thanks to all our audio

412
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,320
problems that you didn't hear tonight, if you weren't listening live, we're now 40 minutes

413
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,360
into our program tonight and no news yet.

414
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,680
So really quick, some housekeeping.

415
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,400
You can view a live webcam of our show in progress or an archived webcam of our show

416
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,080
over operator11.com.

417
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,880
You can see our smiling faces all looking at you, waving hello, and doing this program.

418
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,320
So operator11.com.

419
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,600
Also join our live journal and our MySpace, and if you swing this way, you can join our

420
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,120
Facebook communities, too.

421
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,640
We have a presence on all those sites, and we love having folks in our communities.

422
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,840
Also tonight's program, bringing back the interviews with the folks out there who make

423
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,840
the games.

424
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,200
A lot of you guys have given us feedback that you want to hear more interviews, and so we're

425
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,360
very happy tonight to have some representation from Bizarre Creations tonight.

426
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,320
We're going to talk about Geometry Wars Galaxies.

427
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:22,140
We'll get to that in Part B. For now, though, let's get into the gaming news.

428
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,960
So anyways, big news this week about Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

429
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,960
It's delayed.

430
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,720
Ha ha, no Smash Brothers for Christmas, Timmy.

431
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:40,000
Anyways, it's going to be coming out now in February on the 10th, and other news, Sonic

432
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
the Hedgehog's in there.

433
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,840
Oh my God, that's like such a surprise.

434
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,360
Like who would have thought that Sonic the Hedgehog would be on a Wii game?

435
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,360
Really?

436
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,760
Who would have thought?

437
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:56,600
I mean, you know, it's not like that they have, I don't know, Mario and Sonic at the

438
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Olympics and shit like that.

439
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,960
But anyways, Sonic is in there.

440
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,080
It's pretty cool.

441
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,320
What more can I say?

442
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,920
Although I am not surprised.

443
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:11,680
In fact, this will be, I'm guessing, the first of many delays to come.

444
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:16,280
In fact, we had heard, straight from Nintendo, Nintendo recently announced that there will

445
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:23,280
be an additional 30 days added to most 4th quarter Wii releases due to production issues.

446
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,400
So you'll probably see a lot of Wii titles slipping by 30 days or so.

447
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,360
Uh oh, where is this coming from?

448
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,360
Nintendo?

449
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,600
Oh, okay, sorry.

450
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,680
So okay, so they go and they announce that Sonic is going to actually be in the game,

451
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,520
which is like to no one's surprise, right?

452
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,800
We all figured, okay, they said there were going to be other third party stuff in the

453
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,840
game and so it's no surprise that Sonic is one of them, right?

454
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,080
So what do you guys think?

455
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,200
If that earlier quote is true that there are three third party characters that are going

456
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,980
to show up in the game, who do you think the third is going to be?

457
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,980
If it's true.

458
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,980
I think at this point, actually, it's not true.

459
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,160
I think Sonic's all you're going to get, but what would you think?

460
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
Mega Man?

461
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
Mega Man?

462
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,160
Anybody?

463
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,160
Anybody?

464
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,160
Anybody else think?

465
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,160
Who's not in there?

466
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,160
Or who's already in there?

467
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,600
Third party is only Snake and Sonic, meaning not Nintendo themselves.

468
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,160
If they kept on the Sega route, I would actually put Knuckles in it.

469
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:24,260
I would say to make, because now everybody's going like OMG Mario vs. Sonic, I would say

470
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:29,820
to make the console wars of yesteryear complete, Bonk needs to be the third party character

471
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,820
in the game.

472
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,820
But we'll see.

473
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,820
Sora.

474
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,560
So they're like, okay, hooray, we're going to have Sonic in the game.

475
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:41,840
Oh, and by the way, we're going to release this game next year on February 10th.

476
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:57,280
They just ran out of days to tease characters in the Smash dojo, so they're like, fuck,

477
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,280
we need some more time.

478
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,800
Let's just push the game back.

479
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:09,000
I think I like Cycoon's suggestion of Bomberman, because Bomberman was also one of the NEC,

480
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,120
you know, Hudson main people.

481
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,640
Dr. Tetsuya says Pyramid Head.

482
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,080
That would be awesome, but not going to happen.

483
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,080
I'm sorry.

484
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,080
I nominate Sora or Ash.

485
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:26,960
I can see them doing Bomberman since they've already had Bomberman Dream Mix TV, so that

486
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,120
pretty much had Snake as well.

487
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,120
Why not?

488
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,440
Yeah, but they can just rip all the fucking moves from that and just throw it in here,

489
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,440
I mean, shit, essentially it was a rip-off of Smash Bros. anyways.

490
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,400
All right, well, if you want to be cooler than all your friends and play Super Smash

491
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:50,840
Bros. Brawl first, you've got to go to E4ALL, which is being held in LA next week, starting

492
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,000
on October 18th at the LA Convention Center.

493
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,740
Of course, this is the little band-aid, because there was no real E3.

494
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,080
There was many E3s earlier this year.

495
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,960
So this is their throw to try and kind of fill that void.

496
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,120
And of course, Sony and Microsoft are not going to be there.

497
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,240
However, Nintendo is, and Nintendo said, we're going to be there and we're showing off all

498
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
of these games.

499
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,200
We're showing off Super Mario Galaxy, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Donkey Kong Barrel Blast,

500
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,960
Battalion Wars 2, Fire Emblem, Wii Zapper, Crossbow Training, Mario Song at the Olympics,

501
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:26,600
Guitar Hero 3, Rayman Raving Rabbids 2, Resident Evil Umbrella, Ella Ella AAA, Chronicles,

502
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,760
Medal of Honor Heroes 2, Ghost Squad, and on the DS, there's a lot of stuff.

503
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,000
Pokemon, Diamond and Pearl, wait, didn't that come out?

504
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,600
Brain Age, wait, didn't that come out?

505
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,000
Brain Age 2, wait, that came out too.

506
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,080
Zelda Found an Hourglass, actually, that came out.

507
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,200
Nintendogs, you know, that came out too.

508
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,320
Mario Kart, you know, a lot of these games they're showing actually have already come

509
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,320
out, I'm noticing.

510
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,880
They're new.

511
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,920
If they're not new, they're new to you.

512
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,720
But hey, if you want to play them like they're new again, head on over to E4ALL.

513
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,560
Hey, Final Fantasy XII is going to be there, that little spin-off game on the DS.

514
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,440
So there's some new stuff.

515
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,220
They may not be new, but you'll think they are.

516
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,320
They're going to try to fool you.

517
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:14,200
Well, what is not new, and actually this does not completely surprise me at all, is that

518
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,100
the Wii is not lowering price at all.

519
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,960
It will stay at $249.

520
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,720
And that's because the folks at Nintendo are saying that they're selling them as they make

521
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,720
them.

522
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,200
So they're having absolutely no trouble and seeing no point in lowering the price.

523
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,980
On top of that, I mean, honestly, $249 is not bad for a system.

524
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,760
So basically Nintendo's saying, you know, well, you guys are still buying them, so what

525
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760
do we need to do any different?

526
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,520
In fact, we're going to increase the price.

527
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,520
You know.

528
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,520
Sucka!

529
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,520
They could.

530
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,560
The direct quote, I think it's funny that this guy's name is George Harrison.

531
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:57,520
But anyway, who is one of the Nintendo reps, said that we'll stay at $249 for the first

532
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,920
sale of the future.

533
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,340
We are still selling everything we can make.

534
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,160
So hey, you're making money.

535
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,280
You're still selling them.

536
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,280
What the hell?

537
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,280
I know one thing.

538
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,320
I thought George Harrison was leaving Nintendo and going back to being a dead beetle.

539
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,320
What?

540
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,260
I heard, no, I heard, I seriously heard he was leaving Nintendo.

541
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,560
So what, what's going on with it?

542
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,800
It's a bad, okay.

543
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,800
That's the bad joke.

544
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:26,160
Anyway, look, I was going to say that, um, there, this didn't make the show roll, but

545
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:32,640
there was conspiracy theories going around that they're, um, one, that they're either,

546
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,040
you know, lowering production so that they're still a shortage going through the holidays

547
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:43,440
to increase demand on the Wii, um, or because this is also kind of being shown in their

548
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,880
marketing campaign or that they're just making the best of a bad situation.

549
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,880
Because if you notice, their new set of commercials now, the very first thing that starts off

550
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,000
as a, we got one, like it's a big thing, like we got one.

551
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,720
And now, no, you know, we stood up, we started playing, we had fun, you know, we bonded,

552
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,720
all this shit.

553
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,280
But the whole thing is like, we got one.

554
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,680
Oh my God, celebration.

555
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,900
See, that's the, that's the fucking thing.

556
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,900
That's what they're doing.

557
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,300
They're trying to market off of, you know, the shortage thing.

558
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:16,040
So whether it's intentional or not, they're using it, you know, to their advantage.

559
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,200
And you know what, they probably don't need to anyways, but it's probably a good marketing

560
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,720
campaign because it's just going to increase hype and really that's all that they care

561
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:32,280
about, although, although there is a part in there that is a little disturbing with

562
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,840
the mother and son.

563
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,880
They're playing some game or something and she's like holding his hand.

564
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:44,480
It's like, um, was it, uh, we came together or something like, like, oh no,

565
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:51,040
God, only you people can think that, is that the one that at the very end, the Japanese

566
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,760
guys like can do the controller.

567
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:03,720
It was really funny when I was, when I was in Wisconsin, um, Megzi's mother was entertaining

568
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,720
some Japanese guests and they looked at, and she's got a Wii and they were looking at it

569
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,480
and you know, Megzi was like, oh yeah, it's a Wii.

570
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,840
And he's like, we've never seen one.

571
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:20,040
We they were from Chiba, so we actually have the chat room reaction to Loki's little comment

572
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,840
on Wii came together.

573
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:36,400
Wait, wait to have that clip queued up.

574
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:45,400
I didn't realize it was going to be like 15 seconds into it.

575
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:50,960
That's why we don't have a soundboard on the program folks anyways.

576
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:57,440
In other news and more to get you up on your feet, Wii Fit's coming out to, um, Japan on

577
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,400
December 1st for 8,800 yen.

578
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,920
And of course I'll feature the Wii balance board.

579
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,080
That's approximately $75 US.

580
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,320
And um, yeah, no idea when it's coming out in the US though.

581
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,700
So you'll have to wait your fat asses until, you know, it comes out.

582
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,840
Actually those boards supposedly only hold up to like 300 pounds.

583
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,040
So if you're like, you know, one of those people on the Maury Povich show, uh, you may

584
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:27,080
not even get to play this game at all, two boards.

585
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,320
One for each hoof.

586
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,880
Wait now how, how many yen was that?

587
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,880
It was 8,800.

588
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,880
8,800 yen.

589
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,900
Now, if you're having difficulty, imagine how much money 8,800 yen is.

590
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:42,600
Imagine 1 yen 8,800 times.

591
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,920
It's not over 9,000 though, so that's good.

592
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,440
It's like 85 bucks.

593
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,440
Alright.

594
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:54,440
However, what's coming out right now is the 3.1 update for the Wii.

595
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,080
It's going to have USB keyboard support for everything.

596
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,060
Because remember before, the Wii update only had the limited USB support.

597
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,800
And how long did it take them to do this shit?

598
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,820
Come on, seriously, this should have been in there from the get-go?

599
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:13,180
And also with the new Wii update, a brand new enhanced everybody votes channel.

600
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:16,360
And did they make the everybody votes channel interesting again?

601
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,320
Sadly, no, they just added the USB keyboard support to the everybody votes channel.

602
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,040
So if you're actually still voting, of which I can't imagine there's that many people still

603
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:29,320
voting, but if you are, then, uh, well, you get a new enhanced version and you can submit

604
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,480
your questions now using the keyboard so you can annoy Nintendo even faster with your questions

605
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,680
like what's better, cake or pie?

606
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,840
Cake or death?

607
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,240
What's a better way to die?

608
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,240
Fire?

609
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,240
Boat fire?

610
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,300
You know?

611
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:47,960
And I encourage people to send their dumb questions to Nintendo because it's funny.

612
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,960
It's really funny.

613
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,520
Funny!

614
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,840
Funny haha or funny oh fuck.

615
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,880
Well for our friends in the UK, we have a few updates to Virtual Console.

616
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:12,200
You have Super Metroid, dun dun dun, and it is 800 points, uh, uh, 560 or 8 euro.

617
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,200
What?

618
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,840
Okay, Rob's giving me this look, I'm like what?

619
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:22,480
So yeah, go play Super Metroid, all of you, now!

620
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,080
And then you also get, um, those on the NES, you get Protector Bot 2, Return of the Evil

621
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:41,800
Forces, known to us as Super Contra, because, Contra came out over there as Protector Bot.

622
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,960
I think it had different sprites too.

623
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,480
Dude, Contra is just awesome, so whatever.

624
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
With blood.

625
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,680
Um, going to the chat, I was giggling because NintendoManiac64 says, the best everybody

626
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:59,160
votes channel question, what's better, the Xbox 360 or Playstation 3?

627
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:04,720
Uh, let's see, SSA100Matt thinks the Miis will be the last unlockable character in Super

628
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,760
Smash Bros. Brawl, uh, VXJsonXV says the everybody votes channel rules!

629
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,200
I vote every day, says our loyal webmaster, VXJsonXV, so I just made fun of the guy that

630
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,240
hosts our website for nothing, good job Rob.

631
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,840
I thought, I thought Jason had more of a life than that.

632
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,200
You know what, he's just very democratic.

633
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,600
He wants his voice to be known.

634
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,140
He wants people to know who he thinks should win American Idol.

635
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,320
He wants people to know what color is better.

636
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,800
What other kinds of dumbass things did they ask on there?

637
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:40,520
He wants people to know that he prefers winter over summer, and all that crap, alright.

638
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,640
And uh, Jason Ochs commented, gotta love this like, puppies should die in a boat fire.

639
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,720
I like puppies!

640
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,580
Well, boat fire is okay, at least there's water.

641
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:58,640
So finally, it seems that Nintendo's going to be turning around this whole lack of stuff

642
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:05,040
for Wii Online, including, of course they talked about the WiiWare service, and they

643
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,120
made some announcements of new titles that are going to be coming out for the WiiWare

644
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:21,560
service, including Pokemon Farm, uh, a Crystal Chronicles game called The Young King and

645
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:28,440
The Promised Land, where you build your own country, and let's see here, also Star Soldier

646
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:34,440
R, and Dr. Mario Wii, that's also going to be coming out as well.

647
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,740
Of course, no dates yet as far as when we're going to see them in the US, or pretty much

648
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,840
anywhere on Earth.

649
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,520
Imagine next year at some point.

650
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,400
Other games announced as well, um, there was Mina de Puzloop, which came out over here

651
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:55,760
as Magnetica, it's a rip-off of Zuma, and um, then also of course, there was a game

652
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:03,400
called Maruboushikaku, and that's um, some weird thing that involves screens displaying

653
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,640
uh, different patterns, circle, line, and square based, and no idea what the fuck that

654
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,640
is.

655
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:16,160
Ah, anyways, and of course, those are only um, kind of um, a little um, sampling of what's

656
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,600
going to be coming, Nintendo says that there is going to be over a hundred WiiWare games

657
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:26,160
that have been proposed to them, and who knows, we'll see some good original content coming

658
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,160
in 2008.

659
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:33,120
Um, I was going to say, there was one other thing too that they um, showed off there,

660
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,640
um, real quick, one of which of course was that um, was it the Wii Contest channel or

661
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,320
something like that, the you know, Me Is Your Me Hot or Not type shit, that was being shown

662
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,320
on there.

663
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,920
Also, there's going to be a DS um, download channel as well, but it's actually going to

664
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,280
be called like, I believe the Nintendo channel, where you can download DS demos to stream

665
00:31:54,280 --> 00:32:00,240
to your um, DS of course over the Wii, um, using the download play, and also they're

666
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:06,020
going to have videos and possibly later on, Wii game demos, so, fuck yeah, it's about

667
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,020
fucking time.

668
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:13,920
And uh, yeah I know, when they asked Nintendo how many WiiWare games would be available

669
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,840
next year, they said, OVER NINE THOUSAND!

670
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,880
I mean seriously, a hundred, that's a lot.

671
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,880
Um, let's see, uh, Color of Sakura in our chatroom says uh, maybe the channel should

672
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,240
be called My Pokemans, Let Me Show You Them, the My Pokemans, Let Me Show You Them channel.

673
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,240
I hear you like mudkips.

674
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,200
Yes, and we should understand that you have a mudkip, I don't like to trade your mudkip

675
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,200
from my pillup.

676
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:45,000
And that pillup turns into a big buttfucker penguin, but that pillup turns into a big

677
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,440
buttfucker penguin, to quote my girlfriend.

678
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:53,440
Anyhow, so WiiWare, lots of stuff coming out for the WiiWare.

679
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,440
Also another game coming out, Wii Music.

680
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,520
Now a lot of us saw this game at the very first time we saw the Wii at E3 2006, remember

681
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,780
that was, you know, remember when uh, I think it was Miyamoto came out on stage, he's conducting

682
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,920
the orchestra, da da da, what?

683
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:11,480
Uh, no, that was Miyamoto on the thing, but I saw um, Koji Kondo playing a guy's autograph.

684
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,440
Yeah, I mean, and throughout the show they had like the guy's drumming or whatever, well,

685
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,520
now it actually is going to be this fleshed out music title, it's called Wii Music, and

686
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,120
uh, actually they've released some screenshots, you can see here, here's a bunch of Miis playing

687
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,600
a variety of instruments like a xylophone, a guitar, a trumpet, all kind of standing

688
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,600
out in a field.

689
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,360
Um, so even though it was kind of a tech demo now, now there's this whole new, you know,

690
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,880
version of the concept.

691
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,360
Basically what you're going to be able to do, you can control up to six band members

692
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,280
and use both motions and button presses.

693
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,180
There's forty different types of instruments in the game and you can pretty much mix and

694
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,180
match your band.

695
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:48,980
Uh, supposedly the game's going to have a variety of different music styles and multiplayer

696
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,560
mode featuring four players.

697
00:33:51,560 --> 00:34:01,280
I want a band that has a zither, a harmonica, a melodica, um, an autoharp, and uh, one snare

698
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,720
drum.

699
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:09,400
I would like Nintendo to know that if this game does not have a didgeridoo, it sucks.

700
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,360
Seriously, like, you better fuckin' have a didgeridoo in this game, because I want

701
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,360
Nothing to do with it if I cannot have my

702
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,120
And and and a flugelhorn

703
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,680
Anyway

704
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:36,340
It has to have a cowbell so we need a band that with a didgeridoo a zither a

705
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:41,940
a cowbell a flugelhorn a sitar

706
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:48,340
And a harmonica and this is why we don't let you guys make music

707
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:54,300
Hey, I can play saxophone and clarinet. Hey, thanks to thanks to Mac

708
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,940
I am a certified musician with my garage band and iMovies

709
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:07,780
Oh, they caught that on camera too crap. Hey, I have a story son of dad would like there to be a skin flute in the game that you can play

710
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:12,180
Dude, you don't need a video round of human screams. Is that an instrument?

711
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:18,900
No, no, no, no, no, no if you need a game for that then you need to do if there's there's simple steps

712
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,100
Stand up

713
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:26,820
Go to your door open it walk out close the closing the doors optional

714
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:31,900
Go through the appropriate hallway to get to your front door open it step out leave

715
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,180
experience nature real life

716
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,940
Get laid I

717
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:45,220
Highly recommend. Okay this coming from the bitch who wants a sitar and we music

718
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,860
Well an electric sitar cuz the tars are sexy anyway

719
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,300
That's explicit on chat

720
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,940
You know, we've we were explicit from the moment. You said surprise butt sex. I

721
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,820
Think I make the explicit so shall I continue

722
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:10,740
For anyone who's looking forward to the new Mario Kart and you are going to be able to play up to

723
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:18,220
12 players online on Mario Kart Wii which will officially make it the biggest Mario Kart of ours

724
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:25,780
As long as you do it, right and as long as there's not two people on the car at the same time because that

725
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,700
That's just gonna be bad memories. I don't want to revisit

726
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,460
And also there's like

727
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:39,060
So now it's like project Gotham four. Yeah. Okay. I tried playing the motorbikes and project Gotham for not pretty

728
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:44,580
I'm really bad at project Gotham racing and like watching me race the motorbike

729
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:50,060
In project Gotham four it was like watching me learn how to ride a bike for the first time was I only left

730
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:56,940
Right and then I fall off and collapse in a big heap and my bike falls on top of me to add insult to injury

731
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,780
Thank You project Gotham for making me feel like a bad driver

732
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,260
But yeah, there will be bikes

733
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,500
which it's like

734
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:12,180
Why the fuck do you need bikes? I mean the game was fine as Mario Kart. It's not Mario Kart and stuff. I mean seriously

735
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,460
um

736
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,440
Anyways, so Mario and Sonic at the Olympics

737
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,660
They've already announced a bunch of really cool characters that you can play as but fuck that

738
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:24,980
Let's play as myself because you can play as your own me in the game because you know

739
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:29,560
Hey, fuck all the time that you know takes to actually put these wonderful characters in the game

740
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,620
Let's just have some dick put his own stupid me in there and play as himself

741
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,220
Hooray

742
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:40,340
Fuck that ain't buying the game. Anyways, it's the fucking Olympics. You're gonna trick me this time

743
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:48,340
Hey, I like this idea because now like we can find out who's better me or Mario me who's faster me or Sonic me. I

744
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:54,460
Can now prove that I'm the best thing ever with my me, right?

745
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,940
It's all about me yeah, that's all about me

746
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:08,040
Anyhow, if you're you know one game that I'm glad my me cannot be put into is a resin evil umbrella chronicles

747
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,720
Because I would not want to die in this game

748
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,240
Get shot or what have you or get my brains eaten by zombies

749
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,620
But what you can get with the resin evil umbrella chronicles is the Wii Zapper. That's right

750
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,340
There's actually going to be a Wii Zapper combo

751
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:26,760
Coming out and although right now it looks like it's only coming out in Japan

752
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,040
You never know if you cross your fingers hold your breath. It might come out over here on states

753
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,860
I'm not gonna happen. Why is that because it's not gonna happen. It's Japan gets all the cool shit

754
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,760
All right. Well, they also get with this cool shit called the expert package a

755
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,040
28-page book called Wesker's extra report and they also get stickers

756
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,760
Because who doesn't love stickers

757
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,320
Well, I love this in zombie pew pew

758
00:38:52,440 --> 00:39:00,240
Anyway, well one thing though about the special editions is that when we got one biohazard code Veronica came out over here

759
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:06,800
Well, we didn't get the big briefcase that had the Wesker's files and everything and Dan and I were tempted to order it

760
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,100
however, what they did after the fact was

761
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:18,280
Release the Wesker report as a special disk like a free giveaway and I got like a bunch of them

762
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:25,220
But you know, I think that we're gonna get the stuff. It's just not gonna be in the cool ass bundle. So

763
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,080
anyway

764
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,000
something that is happy a face is

765
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,440
It's it's O face anyway

766
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,840
is if you

767
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:43,520
get contra for you are getting contra not just that you're getting contra super C and

768
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:53,120
The protector bot from the UK version Rob stop having Pikachu fuck

769
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:59,200
I'm just entertaining our op 11 people before they get cut off, but I'm listening

770
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:07,240
The op 11 feed limits us to 40 minutes a recording so anyway, so

771
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,760
So you get

772
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,300
Stop it

773
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,120
so you get

774
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:21,840
Contra super C and you get the protector bot so I bet you're happy and our calories and comics and all that fun shit

775
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,840
I don't know about the comics but

776
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,160
fun shit

777
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,480
anyways

778
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,660
So other things that you're gonna get including this week lots of fun games coming out

779
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,880
including one game that's kind of infamous with this show a

780
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,360
certain game on the Xbox 360 to which you roll around a

781
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,880

782
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:52,880

00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,480
20 bucks that's not bad for that game

788
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:18,080
Um, guilty gear double X accent core. That should be pretty cool

789
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:24,040
Victoria's boxers. So if you're looking for like an anime Mike Tyson's punch-out, maybe

790
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,640
It sounds like Victoria's secret is that she actually wears boxers

791
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:38,160
Victoria's not Victoria boxers. I thought you said Victoria's no, I was thinking Tori is it's

792
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,200

Disney Princess magical jewels is gonna be coming out on the DS. I

813
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:21,920
Do not want to see the princesses magical jewels because that sounds just really wrong and this I'm sure will make a certain shatter happy

814
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:29,640
Hannah Montana music jam on the DS. Fuck the chatters. I'm happy

815

Are you paying $2,000 for a concert ticket? No, I'm not that I'm not stupid. I'm happy not stupid

816
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:47,720
What it's it's a wonderful game it's like jam sessions except well you can I don't know

817
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,720
I

818
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,560
See it like on CNN like four times

819
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,440
Concert tickets are getting sold by scalpers real quick though

820
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,180

822
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,120
They are also getting a game. You may have heard of on this program

823
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,240
Before we had to get rid of it

824
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:25,480
Beautiful Katamari Damacy ships in Japan on October 18th on the Xbox 360 another game coming out on the Xbox 360

825
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:32,200
Zoids alternative not zoinks but Zoids alternative and it kind of looks like a cyborg type game

826
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:36,400
But what I find very interesting is that the box art totally has Final Fantasy font

827
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:41,040
But yeah, it has like it totally looks like a Final Fantasy game yet

828
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:48,700
It's nothing to do with Final Fantasy Zoids is like it's a Takara game and Takara is responsible for transformers over there

829
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:53,700
Zoids is like a I don't know. I call it a ripoff of like fucking I

830
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,780
don't know like

831
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:58,200
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers or maybe even like

832
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,180
Exactly and I'd say maybe even also ripoff of Voltron a little bit

833
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:11,460
Which is also Japanese. Power Rangers destroyed my childhood. Hitstun in our chat room would like to remind us

834
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,140
They've been making Zoids games since the NES.

835
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:20,620
I would also like to point out with all the ripping off thing and Rob bringing up the Final Fantasy font that it was Yoshitaka

836
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:25,940
Amano who was in part responsible for us having the whole transforming team whatever mecha

837
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:30,460
Genre to begin with so he's responsible for the rape of my childhood

838
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:36,300
He did the character he did the character designs for a kagaki ninja taigachiman. I don't care what anyone says Trini was hot

839
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:42,420
Also hot is Tobey Maguire starring in spider-man 3 coming out on the PlayStation 3

840
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:51,240
See how I took it right back on track. I like the Japanese. Yes. Well because it's the Japanese version

841
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:57,540
That's why the box says Japanese writing go figure coming out. It's interesting. I don't see that every day PlayStation 3

842
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:04,420
I don't panic see man to notice that is a see man not

843
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,980
The other thing okay

844
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:14,240
No no no no Dan, and I sat around with our dreamcast talking to our C man for how long

845
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:24,920
How often do you talk to Dan C man Dan was the one who taught to our C man

846
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,520
And then they turned into in demand frogs

847
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,960
Make it stop Wow

848
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:40,320
Which that sound you hear is millions of listeners across America throwing up into their mouths

849
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:44,320
There you go all

850
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:53,040
Right well sure you do you know you can import this into America the bundle for C man to for the PlayStation 2

851
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:58,160
The full title C man to pay King Genjin. He could see kit is coming out this week

852
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,940
It's gonna cost you 90 bucks if you want to import that sucker, but that comes with a microphone

853
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:06,680
So you can you know yell at your C man? What is it? I'm sorry. I've never played that

854
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:12,120
C man first of all when it came out over here. It was narrated by Leonard Nimoy, and that was really cool

855
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,240
Um you you start off with these

856
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,600
These eggs, and you grow them into tadpoles, and they eventually grow human faces and you

857
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:31,920
Isn't that kind of like the other kind of C man does that to allow me to continue I grant the permission

858
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:40,760
And so I'm gonna take the mic away from Rob see I like having two mics now cuz he can tell Rob to SDF you

859
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:49,000
Anyway, so um they speak this own little like nonsense language, and you talk to them and

860
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,240
Eventually they start talking back and they build their vocabulary as you talk to them

861
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,900
And then they start speaking in this distinguished sort of posh British accent

862
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,960
and

863
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:07,040
then decide and then that you have conversations with them, and they ask you questions, and then they remember the things that you've answered and

864
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,880
You you know they ask you your birthday, and you speak back and forth to them

865
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:17,840
And you monitor their habitat make sure the water is right feed them every day, but eventually they start eating each other

866
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,080
Fantastic or like one will die or something

867
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:30,080
Okay, so it's like Pokemon in the Sims combined, but you talk to them

868
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,720
No

869
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,760
They they have every this program in that is very interesting

870
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,880
How is this game not shown up on my radar in the years?

871
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,700
So we've been doing orange lounge radio five and a half years, and I've never heard of this game

872
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:47,880
What the hell do you want to borrow mine? I think so. Do you have a working VMU I?

873
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,920
Actually, I do okay. I still have my child. I have the Dreamcast hooked up in the garage

874
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,920
I can play C man all night long

875
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,600
at any rate as

876
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,300
As you as you progress through the game you have another tank

877
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,200
That's a terrarium

878
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:09,620
So you're actually growing another environment and after a while your C man's gonna start floundering around and start turning into a cocoon

879
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:18,620
And

880
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:25,180
Then and then you you eventually move the cocoon into the terrarium and it hatches into a frog man

881
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:28,180
And then he leaves and the game is over

882
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:36,200
See and then in a sequel game you actually your your guy turns into a caveman and so

883
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,920
So, thus the cycle starts all over again.

884
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,920
Think about it.

885
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:45,800
So he turns into a caveman so he can do Geico commercials.

886
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,200
There's a series about that now.

887
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,200
Like an actual TV series.

888
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,560
And they stole that from Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer on Saturday Night Live.

889
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,800
Why did you all have to remind us about that show?

890
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,080
I mean, just when I purged it from my memory.

891
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,080
So, my turn, right?

892
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,080
Or do you have more stuff?

893
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,760
No, I have more stuff, actually.

894
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,400
We got sidetracked by C-Man, but the sequel to C-Man is coming out on the PlayStation

895
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,400
video.

896
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,400
Okay.

897
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,200
Galaxy Angel 2 Mugen Kairou no Kage is coming out.

898
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,360
I have no idea what the hell this game is, but you know it's cool because it's by a company

899
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,880
called Broccoli.

900
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,840
Broccoli did Digicarrot.

901
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,880
Ah, very cool.

902
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,880
Well there you go.

903
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,840
So, from the people who brought you Digicarrot.

904
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:31,340
So Sonic Rush Adventure is coming out on the Nintendo DS from Sega and also in Japan this

905
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:38,180
week on the PSP Riviera Yasuko No Chi Special Edition is coming out.

906
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:41,040
And it looks like another game based off an anime, surprise surprise.

907
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,240
That's it.

908
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,780
My turn.

909
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,960
And coming out over in the UK.

910
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:51,120
On the 16th, Warmonger Operation Downtown Destruction, 17th Speedball 2 Brutal Deluxe.

911
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,920
Everything else is coming out on the 19th.

912
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:59,180
Eternal Sonata for Xbox 360 Football Manager 2008, which by the way is real football and

913
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,560
not the shit we have in America.

914
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:07,480
Galactic Assault Half Life 2 Episode 2, King of Clubs, Lair, Life Science Hospital Affairs

915
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:13,880
Luminous Arc, Myst, Naruto Ultimate Ninja, Naruto Ultimate Ninja 2, like they get the

916
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:18,240
game and then they get the sequel the same day, why?

917
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:24,360
Portal on Xbox 360, Pursuit Force Extreme Justice, Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis.

918
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:29,760
Didn't that already come out?

919
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,960
They're just getting Portal.

920
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,160
I would just buy Portal and skip Half Life altogether.

921
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:41,520
Also Tabula Rasa on PC, Team Fortress 2, The Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass, The Orange

922
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:46,360
Box on Xbox 360, why did they get an option of getting Portal?

923
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,520
I don't know.

924
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,860
I think it might be a typo.

925
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,720
You can buy it standalone here but only on PC.

926
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,960
You can get it through Steam, bastards.

927
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:02,160
Thrillville Off the Rails also coming out on damn near everything else.

928
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:07,960
Oh yeah, I forgot Thrillville Off the Rails is also coming out in the US.

929
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,760
It's fun, you get to make people hurl.

930
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:15,920
Anyways, something else that's coming out here pretty soon and fortunately is the last

931
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:22,800
in the long line of download content for Oblivion is the brand new Fighter's Stronghold.

932
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:32,040
It is the same price as a Yaris Xbox Live Arcade game but way better and will be coming

933
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,040
out.

934
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:41,080
It's actually going to be free beginning on October 15th but it's only free for a week.

935
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,080
Make sure you download it.

936
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:47,040
It's the last bit of download content you're going to see for Oblivion so what a way to

937
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,960
close it off for free.

938
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,960
Here you go.

939
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,520
This show actually will go to its podcast form on the 15th which is the way most people

940
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,880
listen to the program so go check Xbox Live.

941
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,880
It should be up now.

942
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,040
Friendly reminder from the folks here at OLR.

943
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:06,120
Also the other thing, here's some of the cool features though that the Fighter's Stronghold

944
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,400
comes with.

945
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:14,600
You can get your own vinter to create your own wines for you.

946
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:21,960
You have a combat trainer, a taxidermist to create trophies for your pad.

947
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,960
I think there is some other stuff.

948
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:29,280
Basically you get this whole castle to run after you do a little quest to get so fucking

949
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,280
awesome.

950
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:34,920
That would be so cool to just fill my castle with a bunch of dead bears.

951
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,840
Seriously, how is Elder Scrolls V going to top Oblivion?

952
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,200
I don't know.

953
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:44,320
This is literally saying, look, we're going to give you the kitchen sink in this game.

954
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,320
It's everything.

955
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,320
It's amazing.

956
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,320
It is amazing.

957
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,840
I have all my cat on my wall.

958
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:50,840
It's a video game, Chris.

959
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,840
You don't actually have to have real pets on your wall.

960
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:57,640
I know, but it's only fun to kill the sim pets.

961
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:58,640
But still.

962
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,640
You're so difficult to please.

963
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:05,920
As a sim, you can't throw fireballs at things.

964
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,480
I'll tell you what, Chris, there's nothing funner in Oblivion than throwing fireballs

965
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,280
at the sheep constantly, and then they start to attack you.

966
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,600
They figure out you're a bad man.

967
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,920
If they live long enough.

968
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,800
That is awesome.

969
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,160
When sheep attack.

970
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,480
It's pretty bad.

971
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:31,200
All right, as was that joke.

972
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,800
Moving on.

973
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,600
Sierra Online, also Vivendi Games, is a part of that.

974
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,360
They have given us some more details about what is coming out on Xbox Live Arcade and

975
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,840
PC through the rest of the year.

976
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:48,280
There is a third person retro arcade shooter called Aces of the Galaxy.

977
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,720
There's another title called Boogie Bunnies.

978
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,840
This is a game where players match rabbits in a match three puzzle game.

979
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:58,040
Those are both coming out on the PC and Xbox Live Arcade.

980
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,040
Rabbit threesomes?

981
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,720
I don't even want to go there.

982
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:07,840
Coming from Wanako Studios, an Xbox Live arcade shooter, Assault Heroes, that of course I

983
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:11,420
believe was already on the Xbox Live Arcade.

984
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:17,140
It's going to retail shelves on the PC for $19.99.

985
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:25,080
Also coming out, Arcadian Warriors, and 33 Scar, Resurrection Ship, Exodus, and the one

986
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:28,800
some people have been looking forward to or not looking forward to because it may bastardize

987
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:34,040
what they know and love, Battlestar Galactica, where you can play as the humans or the Cylons.

988
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:39,280
Sixteen player online gaming on the PC, eight players on Xbox Live Arcade, even though the

989
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,760
early reviews on that were mediocre at best, but they've had a long time since then.

990
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,080
I'm sure that was an early version, so you never know in my head.

991
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,080
Who knows?

992
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,080
Let's be fair.

993
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,080
Time makes games better.

994
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,080
You never know.

995
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,080
You never know.

996
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,280
That's what we're all hoping with Smash Brothers Brawl, right?

997
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,280
Right?

998
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,280
Right.

999
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,280
We'll see.

1000
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,400
Speaking of a geek as I am, I never got into Battlestar Galactica.

1001
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,400
Well...

1002
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,400
Jamie, show me the way.

1003
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,400
Hang your head in shame.

1004
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,040
Actually, I haven't watched any at all Battlestar Galactica since the one from the 70s.

1005
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,040
Oh, okay.

1006
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,080
Well, I don't feel so bad now.

1007
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,080
But I have...

1008
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,080
Ladies, I have season one and two if you need it.

1009
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,000
But I has Doctor Who.

1010
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:21,400
Anyway, anyone who cares, Speedball 2 is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade.

1011
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:25,720
I care, Jamie.

1012
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:31,940
And I think this is funny that it was referred to like this on Joystiq, that it's like Calvin

1013
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:35,840
Ball for anyone who reads Calvin and Hobbes.

1014
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:39,720
Calvin Ball is the game where you make up your own rules as you go.

1015
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,820
I demand euphoria.

1016
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:45,960
So yeah, Calvin Ball the game.

1017
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,000
Anyways, let's see here.

1018
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:55,360
For those who may not be into Calvin Ball, there are some other tidbits on Xbox Live

1019
00:56:55,360 --> 00:57:00,780
Marketplace that you might be interested in, including a whole fucking ton of demos.

1020
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:04,320
The Simpsons game is actually on there now.

1021
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,320
Definitely check it out.

1022
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,320
I forgot I did play that this week.

1023
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,320
Awesome.

1024
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,320
Awesome game.

1025
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,280
If you're a Simpsons fan, you're going to love it.

1026
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,760
Which, of course, is based off the movie and comic series, and it's supposed to be very,

1027
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:17,760
very bloody.

1028
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,760
I haven't got a chance to play it yet.

1029
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,760
I tried it.

1030
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,760
I will soon.

1031
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,760
I tried it.

1032
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,800
I could not understand the control system at all.

1033
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,800
So I don't know.

1034
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:29,320
I just hit mash one button, swung my sword, and there was lots of blood, and I died a

1035
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,320
lot.

1036
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:35,080
At least that's why they have demos, so you don't have to waste $60 to find that out.

1037
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,080
Project Gotham Racing 4 is up there now.

1038
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,320
I played that one.

1039
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,320
It's pretty.

1040
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,320
It's fun.

1041
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,320
But I really suck at it.

1042
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,520
I cannot control the car for shit.

1043
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,040
I just have not figured out.

1044
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:47,640
The only racing game I can control worth a damn besides Mario Kart is Burnout.

1045
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,920
These other ones, I can't do it.

1046
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,440
I keep crashing into walls.

1047
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,040
I highly recommend, Rob.

1048
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,560
I swear you're going to love this game.

1049
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,960
Flat-out ultimate destruction.

1050
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,600
I played the demo for that, too.

1051
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,600
I did.

1052
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,360
Based on your recommendation, I downloaded the demo for that.

1053
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,360
It was kind of fun.

1054
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:05,380
A little clunkier than Burnout for me, but I like the fact that when you ran people off

1055
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:07,880
the road, it actually told you who you just killed.

1056
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,880
That was pretty fun.

1057
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,880
And they get pissed off at you, too.

1058
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,880
Yes.

1059
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:11,880
That was good.

1060
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:12,880
That was good.

1061
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:13,880
Yeah.

1062
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:14,880
Ultimate destruction.

1063
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,080
And the majority of them were hot chicks that I was offing.

1064
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:22,000
A lot of them look like the cast of The Fast and the Furious and shit, so it's funny.

1065
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Let's see.

1066
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,640
Fear Files, that's going to be coming up as well.

1067
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,520
And then finally, Virtua Fighter 5.

1068
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:31,520
Lots of demos.

1069
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,520
Check them out.

1070
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,520
More demos, I'm sure, this week.

1071
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,520
Woohoo.

1072
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:43,000
All right, well, Microsoft is cracking down on naughty, naughty, naughty, very naughty

1073
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,480
mottos that people have in their gamer tag.

1074
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:49,320
Not so much the tag itself, but you know how everybody on Xbox 360 gets a motto, a little

1075
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,680
line that they can have under their name?

1076
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:56,040
For instance, mine is OrangeLawnTrader.com, trying to plug the site in very cheap ways.

1077
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,920
So when people kick my ass at Halo, they'll go, hey, let's check out this guy's crappy

1078
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,860
podcast that he does with his friends.

1079
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:01,860
So yeah, that's there.

1080
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:03,200
I don't know what you guys have for your mottos.

1081
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,040
What do you have for your motto, Loki?

1082
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,040
I don't remember.

1083
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,040
You don't remember?

1084
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,040
No.

1085
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,040
Wow.

1086
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,040
Does anybody?

1087
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,040
What's yours, puppy?

1088
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,040
Do you remember?

1089
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,040
I honestly, you know what?

1090
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:17,240
I only made it a month ago, and I don't remember it, because it's really not important.

1091
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,040
I think it'd be funny the first time.

1092
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:24,960
I think I had, it's so much fun, and then I think I just changed it to the website.

1093
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:25,960
Nice.

1094
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,900
Well, one of our fellow independent podcasters found out the hard way that Microsoft is actually

1095
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:35,380
keeping an eye on those mottos, Cheepy D over at the Cheap Ass Gamer.

1096
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:39,840
They're the guys that won the podcast award this year, so good for them, but they got

1097
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:45,360
banned from Xbox Live for a day for saying, Konnichiwa, bitches, in their motto.

1098
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:51,980
Apparently Microsoft does not appreciate the word bitch, because poor Cheepy D, yeah, they're

1099
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:53,520
offended by the word Konnichiwa.

1100
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,520
Come on.

1101
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,520
They're racist.

1102
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:00,200
You know what's funny is that when I read that, I think of the Robins song, but maybe

1103
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,280
I'm just, I don't know, I'm crazy.

1104
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:06,600
Anyway, also another user on the site, an unnamed user, but I think I actually know

1105
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,760
who this might be if you listen to All Games Radio.

1106
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:13,920
There is a person whose motto was, called the shit poop, but they used a little wavy

1107
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:19,720
thing for the S and a little symbol for the P in poop, so it got past the little language

1108
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,720
filters.

1109
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,700
I'm thinking, you know, there's a guy on All Games called, he called the shit poop is actually

1110
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:26,480
his nickname, and I'm like, it must be the same guy.

1111
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,280
So these poor guys are getting booted for, well, they're not booted, but they're getting

1112
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:34,960
the ban for a day for their naughty mottos and getting a nasty email and all that stuff.

1113
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:39,960
Now here's my thing is I want to know what exactly does Microsoft consider offensive.

1114
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:44,000
I'm like, the bans are just for a day, so let's have a little fun with this.

1115
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,400
Let's push the limits.

1116
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:53,080
So tonight I'm going to change my motto to fisting fan, and I want to see if anybody

1117
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:57,120
catches that that could be actually a pornographic thing, and I'm like, I meant like, you know,

1118
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,560
I meant like karate, fisting.

1119
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:02,160
So we'll see what happens.

1120
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:07,480
The national term in karate, you have valleys, fisting.

1121
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:11,320
So I'm going to change my motto tonight to like, I heart fisting or fisting fan or fan

1122
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:18,200
of fisting, and I want to see if that will get by the censors, so we'll see what happens.

1123
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:32,000
One of Dan's friends, his gamer tag is, okay, I have to think of how he has it, DuckMySock.

1124
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,300
Apparently one of the listeners over at AllGames, Flaming Bozo is reporting, one of the other

1125
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:41,680
listeners at AllGames, Buck Fush, was his nickname, Buck Fush got banned for a day because

1126
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:44,080
his motto said Bush Plan 9-11.

1127
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:48,800
Apparently, that was a no-no.

1128
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,560
Who cares?

1129
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:55,040
Seriously, Microsoft, who cares?

1130
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,920
Okay, Loki, a seat now, good.

1131
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:57,920
I like this.

1132
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,560
The chat room is coming up with things that are questionably offensive for us to put in

1133
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,560
our mottos.

1134
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,520
So, Loki, you're going to use this one from Takeo Ray, okay?

1135
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:10,040
Dirty Sanchez is all around.

1136
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:13,440
Can you change your motto to that and see if you get banned for a day?

1137
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,440
It's just a day.

1138
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,040
It's just one day.

1139
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,040
You can go without Halo for a day.

1140
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:20,200
I can get banned for a whole other reasons, but...

1141
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,200
All right.

1142
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:26,720
Oh, Son of Dad is doing a little play on what there is there.

1143
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:27,720
My new...

1144
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:28,720
Oh, Son of Dad's...

1145
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:33,000
No, I guess Son of Dad's new motto says, Halo Soaks Cork.

1146
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,120
I like Frisbees.

1147
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,720
Frisbees says, buy a Wii.

1148
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,560
I don't have an Xbox in my...

1149
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:41,560
That's not an Xbox, sorry.

1150
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:42,560
I'm sorry.

1151
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:43,560
Oh, 360.

1152
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,560
Oh, 360.

1153
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:45,560
Okay.

1154
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:46,560
Well, Megsy's got one, but she doesn't have time to play.

1155
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:47,560
She's studying for finals.

1156
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:52,080
But can someone in chat, for me, or anyone who's listening, who wants to actually participate,

1157
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,520
add something to the lesbian, or like, I like dykes or something?

1158
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,520
Yeah.

1159
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:57,520
Carpet muncher.

1160
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,520
Carpet muncher.

1161
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:59,520
How do you know?

1162
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,520
That could be my cat.

1163
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,520
Sharmi used to do that.

1164
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,520
My cat does that too.

1165
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,520
Our witness says, I like box.

1166
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:11,520
My mom says, if I want to be a lesbian, I have to lick a lot of carpet.

1167
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,520
Pretty much.

1168
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:14,520
Anyway.

1169
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:16,920
It's really that simple.

1170
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,560
I make you an honorary lesbian.

1171
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:19,560
Damn it.

1172
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:25,680
All there is in this house are hardwood floors.

1173
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,680
That's true.

1174
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,880
I think it's a special time, Rob.

1175
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:33,840
Okay, Color of Sakura's going to change his motto to say, the rug doctor.

1176
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,920
Oh, God, yes.

1177
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,160
That's awesome.

1178
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:40,740
So we need to start a thread in the forums for questionable mottos that get caught by

1179
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:41,740
Microsoft.

1180
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:42,740
Yeah.

1181
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:43,740
That would be funny.

1182
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:49,680
Somebody start that up, orangetownsradio.com, forums, plug plug, or like have one that says,

1183
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,960
I want a fag, or something like that.

1184
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,320
Yeah, but fag means cigarette, right?

1185
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:54,320
Yeah, exactly.

1186
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,320
Okay, here's the thing.

1187
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:58,140
If you get banned for reals, like permanently though, you can't blame us, okay?

1188
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:01,320
You're doing this at your own, because I don't want no lawsuit, like, oh, those assholes

1189
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,040
on Orange Island Radio told me you changed my mottos.

1190
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,320
No, you're doing it for yourself, okay?

1191
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:09,000
But we really appreciate it, so give it to pure pleasure.

1192
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,640
The only cool kids do it.

1193
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,640
Segment.

1194
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,040
Ah, yes.

1195
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,760
I'm sorry.

1196
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:21,080
We have a segment coming up now, because we're over an hour now, so it's time for part A

1197
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,080
to finish up.

1198
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:26,960
And you know we like to close out part A here at Orange Lounge Radio by respecting our elders

1199
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,600
and paying tribute to a classic video game.

1200
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,640
It's Dark Sakura's classic game of the week.

1201
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:39,560
Dark Sakura, what game should all the kids be putting in their Gamefly cues right now?

1202
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:50,040
The classic game of the week for all of you awesome people who own a Saturn.

1203
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:57,520
Magical Night's Dream Cotton Boomerang, which is a fantastic game.

1204
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:04,760
And Boomerang is actually a Saturn port of Cotton 2, so actually if you've got BAME,

1205
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:11,160
you can play the game on your emulator, and it'll run just fine, but it was basically

1206
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:15,840
going back to the original Cotton the way that it worked as being a side-scrolling shooter

1207
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,840
with extra fun.

1208
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:21,680
And I know I've talked about Panorama Cotton and Rainbow Cotton a lot.

1209
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:27,960
Those are sort of special in the series in the fact that they are behind the character

1210
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,720
view, and they're actually kind of hard to play.

1211
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:37,460
But Cotton Boomerang is completely side-scroller with lovely animations and levels, but you

1212
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:43,800
also get pretty much unlimited magic, and you get all these different skills and items

1213
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,800
that you can use in the game.

1214
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:51,160
Like my favorite item in this game is this big ball of fire.

1215
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:55,920
And what you do with the big ball of fire is you bounce it, and you actually will have

1216
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:00,000
lines of enemies that come at you, and you can bounce the ball at, and it'll just knock

1217
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,400
out complete lines of enemies.

1218
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,800
And the cool thing about the Cotton series, though, is that there was also this collector

1219
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:14,800
thing that if you got different Cotton games, like Panorama Cotton was one, and keep in

1220
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:22,160
mind they only made something about 600 copies of this game, and there were only 300 of these

1221
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,960
tea cups that they issued out.

1222
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:29,840
There was one with the original Cotton version.

1223
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,200
There was the Panorama Cotton one.

1224
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:35,680
There's a Cotton 2 cup, but they don't know how many of them are out in circulation, but

1225
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:39,560
these are like lots of money now.

1226
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:45,840
For anyone who wants to play any of the Cotton games, if you've got a Neo Geo Pocket Color,

1227
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:50,760
and I think it actually came out on DS, I want to say, there's also a Super Nintendo

1228
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:51,760
version.

1229
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:56,760
They did release Cotton on a number of systems, but I'd have to say of the side-scrollers,

1230
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:03,440
the best of them is Cotton 2, it's just really, really a lot of fun.

1231
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:07,240
And I love that in the bonus stages we pick up tea cups.

1232
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:12,040
I just like the concept of a side-scrolling shooter game starring witches flying on brooms.

1233
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,480
That's just kind of rad and original.

1234
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:19,000
The whole story behind it is that Cotton is this little witch girl who is addicted to

1235
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,920
this candy called Willow that makes her throw up.

1236
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:27,960
And this, she rescues, kind of like how I'm addicted to crack.

1237
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,520
It makes me throw up too.

1238
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:30,520
Whatever.

1239
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:35,940
Anyway, and she rescues this fairy, this fairy named Silk comes to get her help.

1240
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:37,620
That's her, by the way.

1241
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:41,760
That's a sexy mama that comes up there on the little stage selection screen.

1242
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,400
Is that Cotton's lesbian lover?

1243
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:44,400
What is that?

1244
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,400
That's the fairy Silk.

1245
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:48,760
Well, of course, there has to be some gratuitous tea shot somewhere.

1246
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:52,160
And the whole point of this game is that, and the whole reason that the character is

1247
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:58,320
participating in this adventure at all is because either she wants candy, or someone

1248
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:03,700
is threatening her supply of candy, and she's only doing it for the candy, she could give

1249
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:09,240
a shit about the trials and tribulations of the land she's rescuing because she wants

1250
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,240
candy.

1251
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,240
Is she single?

1252
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:12,240
Probably.

1253
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,200
But I'd like to do her if I was.

1254
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,760
She's also a little girl.

1255
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,120
Oh, wow.

1256
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:21,200
Cotton is a little girl.

1257
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,200
She's a very little girl.

1258
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,560
Well, the graphics is just awesome.

1259
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:31,200
Rob's got something on YouTube that's, yeah, video one, and it's pretty much showing what

1260
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,720
the game is looking like, and the graphics.

1261
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:34,720
How old is this game?

1262
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,720
This came out on the Sega Saturn.

1263
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:37,720
The graphics are awesome.

1264
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:45,200
I do want to say that this game came out in 95, I want to say.

1265
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:48,200
The Saturn in Japan came out in 93, Rob.

1266
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:54,640
No, it came out in 94 because I had just started college and my friend imported a Saturn that

1267
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,640
year.

1268
01:08:55,640 --> 01:09:01,920
But, yeah, I want to say that Cotton Boomerang came out in 95, and it's, for anyone who's

1269
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:04,560
a fan of 2D shooters, this game is gorgeous.

1270
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,560
I mean, really.

1271
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:06,560
Yeah, it really is.

1272
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,560
And it's a ton of fun.

1273
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:12,920
So I'd say anyone who's got name or the equivalent, fine.

1274
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:17,840
If you want to play it on one of your emulators, you'll find it as Cotton 2, but if you've

1275
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:21,560
got a Saturn, find this game in Japan, it's really a ton of fun.

1276
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:26,480
And I can say that I have played through Cotton 2, or Cotton Boomerang, and it's really great.

1277
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:28,600
I don't actually own it myself.

1278
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:34,360
Cotton Boomerang, or Cotton 2, is the classic game of the week, as judged by Dark Sakura.

1279
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:35,360
Very cool.

1280
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:36,360
This game looks like fun.

1281
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:39,600
I'm actually thinking I want to check that out too at some point, so, very cool.

1282
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,200
I'm liking this new segment.

1283
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,200
What do you guys think?

1284
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,240
Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com if you want to send us an email.

1285
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:47,360
If you have a suggestion, a game that Jamie needs to check out to consider for the segment,

1286
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:50,600
even though I think you have your next month and a half already picked out.

1287
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:56,760
Actually, I make sure to pick them out ahead of time.

1288
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:02,040
And Dark Tetsuya, thank you, he posted a link to the PanoramaCotton Mega Drive one that

1289
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,880
has the teacup with it.

1290
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,760
And I actually do know somebody who has a copy of PanoramaCotton.

1291
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:11,640
If anybody wants to have a headache, then go on YouTube and look at, well actually,

1292
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:15,880
PanoramaCotton, I've played on the Genesis emulator, but my friend owns a legit copy.

1293
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:19,160
It really is fun, but Rainbow Cotton was really fun too.

1294
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:22,280
That was the Dreamcast version that's the same type of game.

1295
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,280
All right.

1296
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:27,000
Well, that's going to do it for Orange Lounge Radio, this part A of our podcast, but don't

1297
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
worry.

1298
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,000
We're going to be right back with part B, and in part B tonight, we're being joined

1299
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,920
by Craig Howard and Ben Ward from Bizarre Creations.

1300
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:39,680
They're going to be here to talk about Geometry Wars Galaxies, so we'll be right back with

1301
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:45,200
part B of our show.

1302
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:48,800
And for those of you guys listening live tonight, first off, I apologize for those audio issues

1303
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,200
because now it's already like 7.30, but that's okay.

1304
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,920
We'll just pretend part A was really long because it was.

1305
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,040
We're going to be right back in a little bit with part B of our show.

1306
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:59,680
If you're listening on AllGames.com, the Kirkpockin and Hendricks review is up next.

1307
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:02,080
It's sandwiched in between part A and B of our show.

1308
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:06,640
One guy from the US and one guy from the UK reviewing the exact same game.

1309
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,080
And speaking of folks from the UK, did you know, Dark Soccer, that Bizarre Creations

1310
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,080
is in the UK?

1311
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,080
Yes.

1312
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:16,760
So yeah, I actually had to get up at like six in the morning to interview these guys,

1313
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:17,760
so it's going to be cool.

1314
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:18,760
We're going to have them on.

1315
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,400
That would have been two o'clock in the afternoon there.

1316
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,400
Yep, sure was.

1317
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,680
They probably were well fed and well rested after lunch.

1318
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:26,800
Although there was some snafus with the time zone stuff, but I'll talk about that when

1319
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,120
we come back in part B. Remember, eight hour time difference.

1320
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:33,520
I made a bad boo-boo when I was late, so I made myself look very unprofessional.

1321
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:37,680
I'll tell you more about that in part B. For those of you guys listening on OrangeLawnsRadio.com,

1322
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:42,400
you're getting some music, specifically tonight, some of the music from the Wangan Midnight
