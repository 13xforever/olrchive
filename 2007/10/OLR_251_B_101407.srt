[SPEAKER_07]: www.orangeloungeradio.com

2
00:00:15,296 --> 00:00:19,080
[SPEAKER_07]: and now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:32,152 --> 00:00:33,813
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

4
00:01:00,971 --> 00:01:03,152
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's around the same time as the Euro version.

5
00:01:03,653 --> 00:01:07,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, same issues with the European model.

6
00:01:07,494 --> 00:01:09,475
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going to have backwards compatibility with PlayStation 2.

7
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,056
[SPEAKER_10]: And I stand corrected from what I said last week.

8
00:01:12,396 --> 00:01:14,937
[SPEAKER_10]: I was a little confused with the chips and what they did and shit.

9
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:21,160
[SPEAKER_10]: So, originally they had taken out the Emotion Engine, which dropped the backwards compatibility a little bit.

10
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Now they removed the second chip that did the rest of the backwards compatibility for PlayStation 2.

11
00:01:25,142 --> 00:01:25,262
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

12
00:01:26,465 --> 00:01:27,465
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a software thing.

13
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:28,906
[SPEAKER_10]: It is something that they're doing to save money.

14
00:01:28,926 --> 00:01:29,706
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still stupid, though.

15
00:01:30,147 --> 00:01:34,309
[SPEAKER_06]: They took out one of the biggest marketing things they had.

16
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:37,590
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they were totally doing it around that emotion.

17
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,231
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have to buy that version.

18
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:47,975
[SPEAKER_08]: You can spend $100 more and buy one that does play some... Basically, they removed its soul, or my soul, depending on how you want to look at it.

19
00:01:48,635 --> 00:01:53,037
[SPEAKER_10]: But hey, that's okay, because you'll buy a 40-gig PS3 if you're in Japan, because they're wiped.

20
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:57,059
[SPEAKER_08]: And that makes all the difference.

21
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,401
[SPEAKER_10]: They're available in white, as well as black.

22
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:02,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Any chance we might get the other colors over here?

23
00:02:04,364 --> 00:02:06,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Or do they say, well, are they going to be all Nintendo?

24
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:12,950
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't need to do different colors right now, even though we always do different colors, because the current consoles are still selling like crazy.

25
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,492
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't want to confuse people anymore, you know.

26
00:02:16,452 --> 00:02:16,813
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

27
00:02:17,193 --> 00:02:21,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Eventually, I'm sure there'll be different console colors, much like there is with the PS2.

28
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:27,200
[SPEAKER_10]: But PS2, they stuck with black for a long time until silver, which I think that was just this summer.

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,181
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, shit.

30
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:32,385
[SPEAKER_10]: They're a little late to the game with the colors for the PS2 as well.

31
00:02:32,946 --> 00:02:38,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, GS68 says, White PS3s?

32
00:02:38,832 --> 00:02:39,693
[SPEAKER_08]: I call racism.

33
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:44,378
Did anybody else do that ad?

34
00:02:44,638 --> 00:02:44,738
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

35
00:02:45,237 --> 00:02:47,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you guys already probably covered it.

36
00:02:47,138 --> 00:02:51,220
[SPEAKER_04]: It just reminded me of that ad for, I think, a PSP in Japan.

37
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,881
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a long time ago.

38
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:54,221
[SPEAKER_04]: It just reminded me of it.

39
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:55,142
[SPEAKER_04]: That white chick.

40
00:02:55,902 --> 00:03:01,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris the Lesbian, taking us back to the sounds of 2006 here on Orange Lounge Radio.

41
00:03:01,405 --> 00:03:01,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Love you, Chris.

42
00:03:02,806 --> 00:03:03,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Bite me.

43
00:03:05,447 --> 00:03:09,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so we know Sony has these white and black issues.

44
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:12,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not red?

45
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:16,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's the red love and the yellow love and the blue love and the purple love, huh?

46
00:03:16,589 --> 00:03:16,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Where is it?

47
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:18,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Native American love.

48
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:20,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you aren't going to get any love.

49
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,871
[SPEAKER_10]: You see those extra colors?

50
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:25,091
[SPEAKER_10]: That costs money.

51
00:03:25,531 --> 00:03:27,292
[SPEAKER_10]: And obviously they're trying to save money.

52
00:03:27,964 --> 00:03:28,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I take it back.

53
00:03:28,984 --> 00:03:30,345
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a red PlayStation 3.

54
00:03:30,985 --> 00:03:36,867
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they made like three of them because I seem to remember some Canadian contest where they were giving away like red PS3s in Canada.

55
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:39,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Or you can go on the internet and buy them in any color.

56
00:03:39,788 --> 00:03:41,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you can go to Target and get a can of spray paint.

57
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:43,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Just be careful.

58
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:44,770
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a Krylon touch.

59
00:03:47,431 --> 00:03:50,111
[SPEAKER_08]: But I have to have one that matches my carpet.

60
00:03:50,131 --> 00:03:51,772
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have any carpet.

61
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:53,613
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm being hypothetical.

62
00:03:54,253 --> 00:03:54,533
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

63
00:03:55,217 --> 00:04:02,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, speaking of the Sony PSP, at least Chris was able to take us on the right path and take us over to the PSP.

64
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:08,201
[SPEAKER_08]: And we want to talk about some first-party PSP titles that are coming in the year 2008.

65
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:12,802
[SPEAKER_08]: There's going to be seven first-party download titles coming to the PSP.

66
00:04:13,102 --> 00:04:13,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, how does that work?

67
00:04:13,723 --> 00:04:16,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I haven't downloaded anything on the PSP yet.

68
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:17,264
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't either.

69
00:04:17,844 --> 00:04:18,104
Okay.

70
00:04:20,376 --> 00:04:24,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess you take your PSP, connect to the Sony store, and you can download all of these.

71
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,083
[SPEAKER_10]: It's eventually going to be with the Sony store on PC or on the PS3.

72
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:31,667
[SPEAKER_10]: You just download it, and you transfer it to the memory stick.

73
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:41,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully it's a lot better than the stupid demos, because the demos you have to put in this fucking specific directory, and they have all these specific instructions.

74
00:04:41,436 --> 00:04:44,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead of, throw it in the games folder, and it will work.

75
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:46,080
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, something like that.

76
00:04:46,676 --> 00:04:51,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's going to be three action games, two music games, one shooter, and one racer.

77
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,961
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you were hoping I was going to name those seven titles, sorry.

78
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:56,282
[SPEAKER_08]: That story's in another castle.

79
00:04:56,322 --> 00:04:57,383
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, sorry.

80
00:04:58,183 --> 00:05:07,750
[SPEAKER_10]: This kind of brings me back to that WiiWare story that we did in Part A. But I remember there was also a Hudson karaoke game that's come in the WiiWare.

81
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Hudson's cool.

82
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:12,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Bomberman karaoke.

83
00:05:12,473 --> 00:05:15,715
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as I can sing Fergalicious...

84
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:19,973
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's okay.

85
00:05:20,294 --> 00:05:20,875
[SPEAKER_10]: No one can hear you.

86
00:05:22,397 --> 00:05:31,149
[SPEAKER_06]: So... So a new demo was announced for the PS3 store, which is Ratchet & Clank Tools of Destruction.

87
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:32,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

88
00:05:34,381 --> 00:05:48,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I think out for demo is NHL 2K8 and Conan, but Sony's recent update was also saying that they were also going to be putting up demos for Uncharted, Folklore, and Fallout 3.

89
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:53,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Demos, demos, demos.

90
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:54,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Finally.

91
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:55,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

92
00:05:56,168 --> 00:05:56,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Demos.

93
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:57,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Demos.

94
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:00,140
[SPEAKER_10]: When did EA become a contestant on Supermarket Sweep?

95
00:06:16,624 --> 00:06:17,805
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

96
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:46,602
[SPEAKER_10]: But who knows, Mass Effect 2, definitely going to be published by EA.

97
00:06:47,603 --> 00:06:47,883
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

98
00:06:49,705 --> 00:06:51,346
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's very interesting.

99
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:55,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do you think EA is trying to buy all these companies?

100
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,050
[SPEAKER_08]: What's their strategy?

101
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it just like a Monopoly type thing?

102
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:04,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Or are they just trying to grab the, I mean, because BioWare doing Mass Effect, I mean, are they just trying to foresee that, oh, this is going to be a huge title, we want part of that?

103
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:09,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Activision is bizarre, so, you know, they got a monkey see monkey do, I don't know.

104
00:07:11,112 --> 00:07:15,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Activision in like EA or in this pissing contest to who can make the best games.

105
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:20,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Hint to Activision, stay away from Spider-Man games.

106
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:22,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Not doing very good for you.

107
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:32,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I was looking up on YouTube some clips of Supermarket Suite, but I guess I wanted you all in the studio to know I'm not crazy.

108
00:07:32,407 --> 00:07:36,470
[SPEAKER_08]: This was a real badass TV show they used to have on the telly.

109
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you?

110
00:07:37,782 --> 00:07:41,285
[SPEAKER_05]: My granny used to watch it, and I'd have to watch it when I went to Dothan.

111
00:07:42,325 --> 00:07:43,926
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to make my grandma watch it.

112
00:07:45,908 --> 00:07:49,010
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to watch it all the time with, like, one of the early morning game shows.

113
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:52,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Back when I was, like, ten years old, all I watched was game shows.

114
00:07:53,693 --> 00:07:57,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, when I was ten years old, the things that we watched were reruns of Press Your Luck.

115
00:07:59,137 --> 00:08:00,939
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Ami, no, Ami, no, Ami, no, Ami, no, Ami, stop!

116
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:01,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop!

117
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:10,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, when I used to go shopping with my mom and I would put these random Nintendo magazines and candy in the cart, my mom would be all, how did that get there?

118
00:08:10,543 --> 00:08:12,404
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, I'm practicing to be on Supermarket Sweep.

119
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:15,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Innocent look.

120
00:08:16,188 --> 00:08:18,070
[SPEAKER_10]: White-eared 50 hams in our cart.

121
00:08:19,612 --> 00:08:19,992
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

122
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:20,813
[SPEAKER_08]: I like ham.

123
00:08:22,515 --> 00:08:23,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Christmas is coming.

124
00:08:23,776 --> 00:08:24,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't you get the memo?

125
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:32,515
[SPEAKER_08]: PlayStation Network is getting some updates, or actually got some updates.

126
00:08:32,855 --> 00:08:39,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only the Ratchet & Clank demo to which Jamie earlier mentioned, but also a title that a lot of folks have been looking forward to, Everyday Shooter.

127
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:46,217
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of cool that the PlayStation is now getting some kind of like, you know, indie-ish games you can't get other places.

128
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,018
[SPEAKER_08]: And Everyday Shooter is one of those games I've heard a lot of good things about.

129
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:50,579
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get arrested for that kind of stuff.

130
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:50,999
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

131
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:52,720
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're an everyday shooter.

132
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:57,461
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not talking about like going out and shooting people from a clock tower or whatever.

133
00:08:57,501 --> 00:09:01,663
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking about... Chris, your jaw just dropped and like hit the hardwood floor.

134
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:10,744
[SPEAKER_04]: While I was in Madison, I don't know the details, and you guys may have covered it, but some guy was going through one of the University of Wisconsin buildings.

135
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:24,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if he had a weapon with him, or I forgot what exactly the details were, but he ended up jumping out of a window, and the reason he was running around the building like he was shooting things, because he thought he was playing the video game Doom.

136
00:09:27,336 --> 00:09:27,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

137
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:32,117
[SPEAKER_10]: And people wonder why video games are being persecuted.

138
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:32,978
[SPEAKER_10]: See, that's the problem.

139
00:09:33,218 --> 00:09:35,100
[SPEAKER_10]: He was playing Doom still.

140
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,861
[SPEAKER_10]: He needs to really update his game.

141
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:38,803
[SPEAKER_10]: If we could ban him from Doom, we would.

142
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:41,385
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

143
00:09:42,846 --> 00:09:43,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Darwin Awards.

144
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:48,031
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a perfect candidate for the Darwin Awards.

145
00:09:50,478 --> 00:09:56,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Everyday Shooter will set you back $9.99, or to the rest of us, that's $10.

146
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:02,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, on the PlayStation Network, you can get some Everyday Shooter wallpaper, and the cost of that, free.

147
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:14,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Some movie trailers as well, Spiderwick Chronicles, Walk Hard, The Assassination of Jesse James, and some trailers for some video games, Fallout 3, Folklore, and I believe some things that were already mentioned previously in the show.

148
00:10:16,404 --> 00:10:18,085
[SPEAKER_06]: So that means you gotta tune in, yo.

149
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:19,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen to what we say.

150
00:10:20,945 --> 00:10:28,571
[SPEAKER_06]: So, for those who were all, you know, happy about SingStar coming out, prepare to be unhappy.

151
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:30,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Completely not happy.

152
00:10:31,654 --> 00:10:41,082
[SPEAKER_06]: It has been delayed past November 3rd, and it is hanging out, I guess, with Duke Nukem forever in Limbo Land.

153
00:10:42,123 --> 00:10:48,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Going, uh, I exist in theory, but will I release?

154
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:49,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no!

155
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:52,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no.

156
00:10:53,673 --> 00:10:56,594
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not giving a reason for the delay.

157
00:10:57,195 --> 00:11:01,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Although the theories are that it's licensing problems and PlayStation Network issues.

158
00:11:04,558 --> 00:11:07,459
[SPEAKER_06]: But the Euro version will be out on time.

159
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:21,026
[SPEAKER_08]: This kind of makes me sad because I was looking forward to that whole YouTube-y channel that they were going to be doing with SingStar and I was going to tape Loki and Secret singing Britney Spears or something and then put that up for the internet to see and they would have loved it.

160
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:26,653
[SPEAKER_08]: So, damn it, when we made the tingle bet, we should have made the tingle bet around SingStar.

161
00:11:27,013 --> 00:11:34,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of Loki setting an eye of judgment on fire in a match with Bobby, what we should have done is we should have made him do something on SingStar and then upload it to the network.

162
00:11:34,196 --> 00:11:36,217
[SPEAKER_08]: You know it would have been the number one video of all time.

163
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you know, we still have I'm Staying In.

164
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:42,220
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, but that's like last year's joke.

165
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:43,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, it's three years ago's joke.

166
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:44,562
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, though?

167
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:49,544
[SPEAKER_06]: At E3, I really liked SingStar because I had some random guy come up and we were singing...

168
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Motorhead at E3.

169
00:11:55,952 --> 00:11:57,353
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember.

170
00:11:57,373 --> 00:12:00,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they have the expandable store, so you could get probably tons of stuff there.

171
00:12:00,555 --> 00:12:02,316
[SPEAKER_06]: I think everyone can get their emo on.

172
00:12:02,676 --> 00:12:05,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I'm sure there's one of those bands you can get your emo on.

173
00:12:05,737 --> 00:12:09,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a video of Megzi singing that from her cell phone, so I think you would enjoy that.

174
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:11,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Megzi is very much now obsessed with My Chemical Romance.

175
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:14,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

176
00:12:15,462 --> 00:12:16,823
[SPEAKER_06]: She has the emo kid haircut now.

177
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:21,988
[SPEAKER_08]: She might be the first lesbian I've ever met who's obsessed with My Chemical Romance.

178
00:12:22,048 --> 00:12:25,149
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't... Usually, like... Oh, second lesbian.

179
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:25,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Chris.

180
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:31,250
[SPEAKER_08]: What about, like... I thought lesbians listened to, like, Melissa Etheridge and Katie Lang.

181
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,411
[SPEAKER_08]: And, yeah, that I Kissed a Girl song and Sarah McLachlan.

182
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:35,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

183
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,512
[SPEAKER_08]: What happened to Lilith Fair?

184
00:12:38,752 --> 00:12:44,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, most people think that a lot of gay guys don't play video games, Rob.

185
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:47,414
[SPEAKER_04]: And the webcam can catch that look.

186
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:51,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what can we say?

187
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:53,436
[SPEAKER_08]: We're special here at Orange Lounge Radio.

188
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:54,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Very special.

189
00:12:54,496 --> 00:13:02,279
[SPEAKER_08]: We are special because we're getting back into the interview habit and getting some people on our program coming on here and talking about the latest.

190
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:05,981
[SPEAKER_08]: As you know, we here at Orange Lounge Radio have a strange fascination with the lolcats.

191
00:13:06,421 --> 00:13:11,663
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you were listening a few weeks ago, you know that the advertisements for Geometry Wars Galaxies gave us a good laugh.

192
00:13:12,276 --> 00:13:16,920
[SPEAKER_08]: We knew we had to get them on the show to talk to them a little bit more about the ads and more importantly the game.

193
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,461
[SPEAKER_08]: And guess what?

194
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:18,001
[SPEAKER_08]: We got them.

195
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:25,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Craig Howard is a game manager for Bizarre Creations and worked on not only Geometry Wars Galaxies but Boom Boom Rocket.

196
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:30,252
[SPEAKER_08]: We were also joined during the interview by Ben Ward, Bizarre Creations community manager.

197
00:13:30,652 --> 00:13:37,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly they couldn't be here live due to the time delay because they're over in the UK but let's listen in on what they had to say earlier this week.

198
00:13:44,184 --> 00:13:45,144
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing out there, Craig?

199
00:13:46,665 --> 00:13:47,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm doing well, thanks.

200
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little bit cold at the moment.

201
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:52,646
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see you here as well as Ben Ward as well from Bazaar.

202
00:13:53,226 --> 00:13:53,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, great.

203
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:55,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, welcome, both of you guys, to the program.

204
00:13:56,267 --> 00:14:04,069
[SPEAKER_08]: And, of course, there's a little bit of a delay here since we are talking from such across a great distance because you guys are based out over there in the UK, right?

205
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it rained in Liverpool.

206
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,471
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do that at the moment.

207
00:14:09,591 --> 00:14:10,331
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just great.

208
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, who came up with that idea?

209
00:14:14,323 --> 00:14:14,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it Roger Sierra?

210
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:42,174
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just some crazy sort of idea that Sierra guys came up with, and it sort of went with the crazy commercial that we were running just before that.

211
00:14:42,194 --> 00:14:45,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see the TV advert with all the guys dressed up as drum tour shapes?

212
00:14:45,955 --> 00:14:49,056
[SPEAKER_08]: I did, and that's available on the internet, on the website, too.

213
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:54,417
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's one of my favorite songs you guys are using in the background for that advertisement.

214
00:14:54,457 --> 00:14:57,798
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a cover of a They Might Be Giants song, and so that's hilarious.

215
00:14:59,011 --> 00:14:59,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you got it.

216
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:10,975
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was just something that the guys at Sierra came up with and they literally just wanted to make it a little bit quirky and a little bit sort of unusual and pull the sort of audience in that you wouldn't normally get in a Drunk Toys game.

217
00:15:11,616 --> 00:15:18,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, we did, one of the good things is it's not just like a sci-fi style advertising campaign of the guys at Drunk Toys.

218
00:15:18,978 --> 00:15:19,999
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very interesting.

219
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:23,120
[SPEAKER_02]: It tries to get more people interested in looking at the game.

220
00:15:25,178 --> 00:15:33,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and it strangely seems to fit, you know, when you're hearing about Triangle Man and there actually are little, you know, triangle things that you're fighting in the game and everything, right?

221
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:35,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.

222
00:15:35,527 --> 00:15:40,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we couldn't really make it too serious because that's not really what John Troll is about.

223
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:45,276
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about having fun with your friends and sort of really getting stuck into a fun arcade game.

224
00:15:45,356 --> 00:15:51,461
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not about realistically fighting geometric shapes in outer space or something, you know, so it's all about having fun.

225
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:53,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely, I agree.

226
00:15:53,314 --> 00:15:54,414
[SPEAKER_08]: It is all about having fun.

227
00:15:54,915 --> 00:16:05,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me about, you know, Geometry Wars started as a part of Project Gotham Racing, turns into this spin-off game that's hugely successful on Xbox Live Arcade.

228
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:14,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Where did the decision come to take the game, the series, from the Xbox Live or the Xbox platform over to the Nintendo platform as a standalone series?

229
00:16:15,286 --> 00:16:20,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, one of the things with Geometry Wars is it's always kind of used to test code as well.

230
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:20,629
[SPEAKER_02]: And when...

231
00:16:21,991 --> 00:16:23,472
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the dev kits for Wii.

232
00:16:23,892 --> 00:16:25,592
[SPEAKER_02]: We started to have an experiment.

233
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:29,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, people started playing it and then our ideas were going.

234
00:16:30,314 --> 00:16:31,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Initially, there was no channel.

235
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:36,436
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no WiiWare or anything like that for the DS or Wii.

236
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:43,519
[SPEAKER_02]: So we thought if we were going to take it across into these platforms, what would we do?

237
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:47,601
[SPEAKER_02]: How would we get it to make it feel worthwhile on those platforms?

238
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:49,381
[SPEAKER_02]: It just seemed like a fun challenge.

239
00:16:49,961 --> 00:16:51,342
[SPEAKER_02]: The controls are interesting

240
00:16:52,026 --> 00:17:06,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people don't believe that it'll work well, but until you actually play the games and nunchuck, it just feels so much... It's different, but it still feels really good and fun and involved when you play the game.

241
00:17:06,595 --> 00:17:11,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it wasn't really sort of a eureka, hey, let's do Geometry Wars on the Wii or anything like that.

242
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:17,081
[SPEAKER_03]: It just sort of built up when we saw the new platforms and we saw what they were capable of, and somebody sort of said...

243
00:17:17,498 --> 00:17:19,758
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be kind of cool if we put Geometry Wars on here.

244
00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:27,700
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did, and then it built up and built up, and then we got the guys at Sierra involved, and they brought Kuju in, and it's just sort of built up into a full game over time.

245
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you guys put motion control in the game?

246
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,581
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't really been able to get a sense of that from what I've read initially.

247
00:17:33,641 --> 00:17:34,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there motion?

248
00:17:34,581 --> 00:17:36,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you guys incorporate the Wii motion controls in the game?

249
00:17:38,062 --> 00:17:44,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, what you do is you use the... You point with the wand, and you use the nunchuck to... to...

250
00:17:46,741 --> 00:17:48,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm full of a cold at the moment.

251
00:17:48,822 --> 00:17:52,403
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all very difficult to speak.

252
00:17:53,564 --> 00:17:55,345
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the controls working like that.

253
00:17:55,425 --> 00:18:00,046
[SPEAKER_02]: It works a little bit like a keyboard and mouse in the way that the controls work.

254
00:18:00,627 --> 00:18:01,587
[SPEAKER_02]: It does feel really nice.

255
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:03,688
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously on the DS we support the stylus.

256
00:18:05,736 --> 00:18:18,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool, alright, so you're kind of like aiming either with the Wiimote or the stylus in the case of the DS version and then moving with the nunchuck or the directional pad That's right, yeah

257
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,171
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, well, I mean, the DS obviously hasn't gone anything like that, and the amount of fans...

258
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:49,599
[SPEAKER_02]: come back and say they'd love to be able to play the game on the move.

259
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,220
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really high, so it made sense to work on the DS.

260
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,401
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii game, I mean, WiiWare still is quite a way off.

261
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:00,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's getting closer now.

262
00:19:00,962 --> 00:19:06,243
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the time, yeah, it was a way for... It was just a way to take the game across to new people.

263
00:19:06,343 --> 00:19:10,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're not going for full retail price.

264
00:19:10,485 --> 00:19:12,885
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going for competitive price as well.

265
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:15,386
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and you get a lot of gameplay there.

266
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:18,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, it's a whole new campaign, though, since you've

267
00:19:44,815 --> 00:19:47,256
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of like 60 versions of Geometry Wars.

268
00:19:48,557 --> 00:19:55,779
[SPEAKER_02]: New enemies, you've got different sort of grid shapes, which make a huge difference in the way you play certain levels and the strategies.

269
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,761
[SPEAKER_02]: You've also got a drone, which is one of the big new additions.

270
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:12,266
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got an autonomous drone who, over the game, you build experience on this drone, you can nurture it to get new skills that can give you more battle strategies when you play the game.

271
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,262
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot more there.

272
00:20:15,342 --> 00:20:18,985
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also got the original retro involved in there as well for fans of the game.

273
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:26,933
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the big one is we've got multiplayer as well, which is also a nice new addition to the series.

274
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:32,495
[SPEAKER_03]: We did sort of see those questions coming when we first sort of came up with this whole concept.

275
00:20:32,535 --> 00:20:38,897
[SPEAKER_03]: We did think that, hey, how are we going to justify charging however amount of money to buy this game?

276
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:43,098
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we've really thrown in a hell of a lot of gameplay to make it worthwhile for people.

277
00:20:43,338 --> 00:20:50,560
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want anyone to feel ripped off once they've bought the game, but I don't think they will because, as Craig says, there's absolutely loads of content in there.

278
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:53,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, if you have the

279
00:21:22,185 --> 00:21:26,186
[SPEAKER_02]: There's quite a few ways of interconnecting the two platforms work.

280
00:21:27,006 --> 00:21:35,648
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have both versions of the game, you can unlock an extra solar system within the game with new unique maps and battles.

281
00:21:36,388 --> 00:21:38,969
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a reward people have brought on both platforms.

282
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:48,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you've just got the Wii version or just the DS version, you can upload the whole retro evolved to your DS or your friend's DS.

283
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:52,243
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, again, a lot more people play in the game.

284
00:21:52,283 --> 00:21:54,023
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the theory behind all of this.

285
00:21:54,863 --> 00:22:02,265
[SPEAKER_02]: So, by doing that, you know, with one cartridge in the office, a lot of people can be playing multiplayer games.

286
00:22:02,925 --> 00:22:03,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Things like that.

287
00:22:03,985 --> 00:22:06,025
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to be as generous as we can with the game.

288
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:09,386
[SPEAKER_08]: And I noticed the Wi-Fi seal on the game too.

289
00:22:09,406 --> 00:22:12,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that mean you've got the online leaderboards and that too?

290
00:22:13,387 --> 00:22:14,067
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, yeah.

291
00:22:14,087 --> 00:22:15,647
[SPEAKER_02]: We support full online leaderboards.

292
00:22:16,108 --> 00:22:18,048
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the caveats to the game was we wouldn't

293
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:20,559
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't do it if we couldn't support online leaderboards.

294
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:25,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Because no matter how good you are, you want to see how good you are against your friends and against everyone else in the world.

295
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:27,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

296
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, where do you guys see Geometry Wars going in the future?

297
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:41,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think there's a possibility of something based on Geometry Wars waves if the Nintendo Wii version, DS versions are successful at continuing and growing the franchise on the Nintendo platforms?

298
00:22:42,503 --> 00:22:47,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, Geometry Wars is something that is its own beast and it's moving on in its own...

299
00:22:48,844 --> 00:22:55,349
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's definitely things that we're considering in the future and looking at at the moment.

300
00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:05,677
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great to be very careful with what he says because I'm sort of holding a hammer over his head at the moment saying, we haven't announced this yet!

301
00:23:05,697 --> 00:23:07,578
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always looking at expanding.

302
00:23:07,778 --> 00:23:15,224
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big fan base to the game and we listen to our fans and we're trying to set aside them and get more people playing the game.

303
00:23:16,164 --> 00:23:17,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, best of luck to you guys.

304
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:29,971
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope the cats sell tons and tons of copies of Geometry Wars, because it certainly is, you know, Geometry Wars Retro was one of, definitely my favorite Xbox Live download titles, and you gotta love the cats advertising the game.

305
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,952
[SPEAKER_08]: You definitely know you can trust them.

306
00:23:32,332 --> 00:23:39,115
[SPEAKER_08]: But I gotta ask you, since I understand, Craig, you're the game manager not only over Geometry Wars, but you also worked on Boom Boom Rocket, right?

307
00:23:39,892 --> 00:23:40,232
That's right, yeah.

308
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's more to come from the world of Boom Boom Rocket.

309
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:44,556
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know exactly what I can say, what I can't, but...

310
00:24:06,956 --> 00:24:10,720
[SPEAKER_03]: We've made additional content and hopefully it's going to be releasing.

311
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:17,346
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still all sorts of caveats that we need to sort out with the publisher and Xbox Live Marketplace and all that sort of stuff.

312
00:24:17,366 --> 00:24:22,491
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully there will be something but I don't want to commit to anything because I don't know the details to be honest.

313
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:25,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Understandable, I understand there's got to be secrets.

314
00:24:25,879 --> 00:24:33,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you guys so much for being on the show today, but before I let you guys go, we always ask all our guests that come on the program, we want to know, how is your gaming week?

315
00:24:33,861 --> 00:24:36,781
[SPEAKER_08]: What kind of video games have you been playing besides the ones at the office?

316
00:24:39,262 --> 00:24:41,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing Halo 3, obviously.

317
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:48,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo 3, and I've been playing Boarded Out on the Dreamcast, because it's a great show.

318
00:24:48,283 --> 00:24:51,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing Halo 3 as well.

319
00:24:52,137 --> 00:24:54,638
[SPEAKER_03]: and I've just finished World in Conflict on PC.

320
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:55,958
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an awesome game.

321
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:57,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, really love that.

322
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:06,842
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think Halo 3 and then when Gotham hits the shelves in the UK, I'll be playing that some more as well and beating all of our community on that or losing horribly to all our community on that.

323
00:25:07,762 --> 00:25:08,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds pretty awesome.

324
00:25:08,623 --> 00:25:11,704
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think the entire internet is playing Halo 3 right now.

325
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:14,585
[SPEAKER_08]: But I have to ask the question, definitive question on Halo 3.

326
00:25:15,145 --> 00:25:16,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you prefer co-op or competitive?

327
00:25:18,246 --> 00:25:18,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Co-op.

328
00:25:19,266 --> 00:25:19,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Competitive.

329
00:25:21,704 --> 00:25:25,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Just hope you keep checking our website and see the stuff we're announcing and

330
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:49,365
[SPEAKER_02]: www.bizarrecreations.com

331
00:26:14,594 --> 00:26:15,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks a lot.

332
00:26:15,596 --> 00:26:15,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Cheers.

333
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:37,570
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

334
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:41,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you very much to those folks from Bizarre Creations for joining us.

335
00:26:41,473 --> 00:26:43,134
[SPEAKER_08]: That was Craig Howard and Ben Ward.

336
00:26:43,154 --> 00:26:51,739
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have to actually kind of give a little bit of personal apologies because, you know, the whole time zone thing, I said I would interview them at 2 o'clock their time.

337
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:57,563
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought for some reason when I looked it up on the Internet, it said 7 a.m., but it actually ended up being 6 a.m.

338
00:26:57,603 --> 00:26:59,685
[SPEAKER_08]: So I roll out of bed at like 6.30 and I check my email.

339
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:00,925
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like, we're waiting for you to call.

340
00:27:00,965 --> 00:27:01,606
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, oh, no.

341
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:02,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

342
00:27:18,729 --> 00:27:19,769
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

343
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:47,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome!

344
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome, I get a mic.

345
00:28:15,976 --> 00:28:22,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, so yeah, some fun information other than bizarre stuff.

346
00:28:23,344 --> 00:28:24,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see here.

347
00:28:25,006 --> 00:28:30,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Our friends over at All Games, of course, they have some ties with G4 and stuff.

348
00:28:31,473 --> 00:28:34,716
[SPEAKER_10]: And this all goes back to, of course, Video Games Live.

349
00:28:35,457 --> 00:28:37,419
[SPEAKER_10]: And so Video Games Live, wonderful show.

350
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:37,780
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been...

351
00:28:38,712 --> 00:28:39,232
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

352
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:02,376
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty cool.

353
00:29:02,837 --> 00:29:07,479
[SPEAKER_10]: And, of course, it's a little bit different than, say, your usual concerts.

354
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:09,840
[SPEAKER_10]: All video game music, all done by an orchestra.

355
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool.

356
00:29:11,261 --> 00:29:15,383
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're in the area of one of those concerts, definitely worth checking out.

357
00:29:17,264 --> 00:29:17,744
[SPEAKER_08]: All righty.

358
00:29:18,268 --> 00:29:20,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know the game Rock Band?

359
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:32,878
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to have a concert of your own, you've got to get this game Rock Band because it's going to have the keyboards and the vocals and tambourines because you can use the microphone as a tambourine.

360
00:29:33,118 --> 00:29:37,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, unfortunately, the only way you're going to be able to get this game is in a bundle form.

361
00:29:37,802 --> 00:29:39,523
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be bundle only in the year 2007.

362
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:42,345
[SPEAKER_08]: You cannot get these separate peripherals separately.

363
00:29:42,665 --> 00:29:42,745
[SPEAKER_08]: E.A.

364
00:29:42,805 --> 00:29:44,747
[SPEAKER_08]: has been telling us that's what's been going on.

365
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:12,033
[SPEAKER_08]: And now it was confirmed for the public this week.

366
00:30:12,453 --> 00:30:17,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Now what I'm thinking, maybe there was like a third party, like are third party controllers going to be out and available?

367
00:30:17,117 --> 00:30:17,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Possibly.

368
00:30:17,477 --> 00:30:18,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, right?

369
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:18,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

370
00:30:18,978 --> 00:30:19,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so maybe that's what it is.

371
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:24,362
[SPEAKER_08]: But as far as the official first party peripherals, unfortunately those are not going to be out until 2008.

372
00:30:25,203 --> 00:30:26,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, guys.

373
00:30:27,465 --> 00:30:31,488
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's going to cost you $170 to play a rock band unless you want to use your existing guitars or microphones.

374
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:38,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this one's sort of interesting to me, although it's interesting in a quite different way than probably how they're listing it.

375
00:30:39,497 --> 00:30:57,487
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a group of graduate students that have mapped video game controllers onto different types of wearable fabrics where you can give massages while playing video games.

376
00:30:59,848 --> 00:31:04,891
[SPEAKER_06]: On their website, they give instructions on how to make one for yourself.

377
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:09,519
[SPEAKER_06]: But, and I want to watch the video on this, however it's not loaded up.

378
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:17,820
[SPEAKER_06]: And given that, you know, I am a massage therapist, I have definite reservations for how safe this is.

379
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:22,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know, from personal experience, if you do it wrong, you can fuck somebody up.

380
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:30,523
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's why we have to go to school for however many hours and learn how to do it right.

381
00:31:31,337 --> 00:31:35,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me ask your professional opinion, quote-unquote, since you have, you know, gone to the school, gone to the training and all that stuff.

382
00:31:36,098 --> 00:31:44,961
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of people, though, that give the casual massages, you know, like in the privacy of their own home, like, ooh, baby, I could really use a massage right now, you know, and no training and that stuff, right?

383
00:31:45,281 --> 00:31:52,263
[SPEAKER_08]: So as long as they're not applying a lot of pressure, though, as long as it's like a I don't know what I'm doing type massage, do you think it's okay?

384
00:31:52,724 --> 00:31:54,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, you can.

385
00:31:56,405 --> 00:31:58,485
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just going from what they said in school.

386
00:31:58,986 --> 00:32:00,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Touch is very important for people.

387
00:32:01,309 --> 00:32:23,460
[SPEAKER_06]: and even if it's really light there's still a lot of um emotion that you can bring out in another person um a lot of uh if they've got say that they have a circulatory issue you can actually cause problems with that lymphatic problems you can move um the lymph in their skin um

388
00:32:26,804 --> 00:32:27,745
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to be kind of careful.

389
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:31,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they actually have a full-on hospital-grade lymphatic massage.

390
00:32:31,687 --> 00:32:38,392
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, a lot of women who've had mastectomies, they remove a lot of the lymph nodes.

391
00:32:38,852 --> 00:32:44,876
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you'll see these deposits in their arms, under their armpits, from excess lymph drainage.

392
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:51,441
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you run into... Anyone who's not a professional...

393
00:32:52,353 --> 00:33:00,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Tries to give, and it seems to me that for, to use a controller like this, they'd have to be using a bit of pressure, don't you think?

394
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:01,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

395
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:11,044
[SPEAKER_06]: So, they run into a lot of risk with, especially it seems to me they're doing around the center back, you're dealing with problems dealing with the spine.

396
00:33:11,064 --> 00:33:11,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Mm-hmm.

397
00:33:12,379 --> 00:33:14,140
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get into some nerve damage.

398
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:24,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything, the way it connects, I would not agree with letting an unprofessional... I'm looking at the official website for this, massage-me.at is the official site for this.

399
00:33:24,244 --> 00:33:27,465
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see anything on the front page about doctor tests or anything.

400
00:33:27,686 --> 00:33:35,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Now granted, I have not, to this website's credit, because I don't want to misrepresent anything, I have not looked through and through all these different pages that are here, so I don't know if they have any type of...

401
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:37,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, the doctor says it's okay.

402
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,850
[SPEAKER_08]: But this looks like, you know, university students.

403
00:33:40,491 --> 00:33:44,632
[SPEAKER_08]: To me, I'm looking at this university students idea of, you know, something innovative.

404
00:33:45,052 --> 00:33:46,433
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yes, it's innovative.

405
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:50,054
[SPEAKER_08]: But could it be dangerous, possibly?

406
00:33:50,474 --> 00:33:50,854
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

407
00:33:50,874 --> 00:33:52,054
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm checking out their thanks.

408
00:33:52,455 --> 00:33:53,475
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to look at their blog.

409
00:33:53,555 --> 00:33:54,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, their thanks didn't say any doctor.

410
00:33:55,015 --> 00:34:00,417
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing on here about being an actual professional massage therapist.

411
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:01,798
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at...

412
00:34:04,165 --> 00:34:05,185
[SPEAKER_06]: They're very true.

413
00:34:05,786 --> 00:34:07,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Massage is very good for you.

414
00:34:07,387 --> 00:34:22,537
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this from experience, but at the same point, if they're not professional, they don't have anything on their listing, any kind of credentials, I would not condone having this type of thing.

415
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:27,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, you know, and to these guys' credit, you know, I don't want to, again, misrepresent it or whatever.

416
00:34:27,681 --> 00:34:36,364
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like a really interesting idea, and, you know, certainly they're thinking outside the box, but just for their own sake, I hope they've consulted a doctor on it, because I don't see anything on the website.

417
00:34:36,384 --> 00:34:39,205
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't really have to consult a doctor, just consult another massage therapist.

418
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:40,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm confused.

419
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:41,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you do the massage on somebody?

420
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:42,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

421
00:34:42,526 --> 00:34:43,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Or on the person?

422
00:34:43,106 --> 00:34:46,508
[SPEAKER_06]: They're wearing this jacket that has the contacts in it.

423
00:34:46,948 --> 00:34:47,028
Oh.

424
00:34:48,283 --> 00:34:49,704
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

425
00:35:08,476 --> 00:35:09,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Go through the jacket.

426
00:35:40,743 --> 00:35:41,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I would not.

427
00:35:43,324 --> 00:35:49,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, there's actually a list on here that's telling you how to do it, but they're not doing it right.

428
00:35:49,428 --> 00:35:50,408
[SPEAKER_06]: You're doing it wrong.

429
00:35:51,809 --> 00:35:53,310
[SPEAKER_06]: You're doing it wrong.

430
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:54,911
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

431
00:35:54,971 --> 00:35:58,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if you want more information on that, it's called Massage Me.

432
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:02,895
[SPEAKER_08]: So we don't want to take too much time talking about it because we're not a massage podcast.

433
00:36:03,075 --> 00:36:04,476
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not condone this.

434
00:36:04,536 --> 00:36:08,438
[SPEAKER_06]: And on top of that, I'm actually going to be referring this site to the director of my school.

435
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this is actually potentially very dangerous.

436
00:36:13,436 --> 00:36:13,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Narc.

437
00:36:14,577 --> 00:36:16,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways.

438
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:22,682
[SPEAKER_10]: So... Konami's made a little boo-boo.

439
00:36:23,043 --> 00:36:29,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Or somebody has made a little boo-boo as far as advertising the brand new Castlevania Dracula X Chronicles.

440
00:36:29,307 --> 00:36:32,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, the Belmonts have now become the Beaumonts.

441
00:36:33,229 --> 00:36:35,751
[SPEAKER_10]: So... I don't know.

442
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:37,932
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a different family that's destroying Dracula.

443
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:44,063
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, you know, quite a coincidence that their names are so close together.

444
00:36:44,864 --> 00:36:53,390
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, there's been, you know, mistakes in ads before, including an ad for Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam, which was advertised as being on the Sony Wii.

445
00:36:55,592 --> 00:36:57,894
[SPEAKER_10]: So... I don't know.

446
00:36:58,154 --> 00:36:58,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Mistakes happen.

447
00:37:00,115 --> 00:37:00,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Much like the show.

448
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:05,960
[SPEAKER_08]: The proofreaders out there are getting fired as we speak.

449
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,620
[SPEAKER_08]: What can we say?

450
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:07,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, um...

451
00:37:08,425 --> 00:37:13,148
[SPEAKER_08]: The Gods and Heroes MMO is on indefinite hiatus.

452
00:37:27,674 --> 00:37:28,295
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

453
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

454
00:38:25,362 --> 00:38:30,325
[SPEAKER_06]: FU goes to the security at my work for saying, oh, there's nothing we can do.

455
00:38:31,066 --> 00:38:32,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Which was bullshit.

456
00:38:32,987 --> 00:38:36,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Pure and utter stinky bullshit.

457
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:41,392
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am going to go back and take a photo of the license tag of that car.

458
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:43,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Say they can't find them?

459
00:38:43,673 --> 00:38:44,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fuck you.

460
00:38:45,635 --> 00:38:46,635
[SPEAKER_06]: I can find them easily.

461
00:38:46,795 --> 00:38:49,517
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw them just the other day, and I have a very good camera.

462
00:38:51,798 --> 00:38:53,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I am not going to stop.

463
00:38:53,379 --> 00:38:53,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop.

464
00:38:55,683 --> 00:38:56,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Until justice is served.

465
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Judge Jamie's on the case.

466
00:38:59,586 --> 00:39:08,333
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they decide to do nothing else, I'm going to address it with our CEO about how ineffectual our security is.

467
00:39:08,873 --> 00:39:10,054
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry to hear that follow-up.

468
00:39:10,074 --> 00:39:13,797
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a kind of screwed-up story you told last week on the show, so that's kind of unfortunate.

469
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:14,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yes.

470
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:15,839
[SPEAKER_08]: F that.

471
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:16,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yes.

472
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:17,680
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

473
00:39:18,121 --> 00:39:21,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Because remember, when I have my mindset to something, I get results.

474
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else?

475
00:39:24,245 --> 00:39:24,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else?

476
00:39:25,236 --> 00:39:26,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck a whole bunch of that shit!

477
00:39:27,097 --> 00:39:27,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

478
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:34,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Um... I guess, fuck you, the fact that there's not a lot of good games out right now.

479
00:39:34,483 --> 00:39:41,028
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's a bit of a lull until, like, next few weeks when there's a ton of shit coming out, so... I need more stuff to play.

480
00:39:42,029 --> 00:39:43,350
[SPEAKER_10]: I need more time to play it in, too.

481
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:48,650
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go next, and then we'll go to Puppy and Chris.

482
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:53,136
[SPEAKER_08]: My FU of the week obviously goes to the sad state of disrepair this show is in tonight.

483
00:39:53,456 --> 00:40:01,626
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea what's going on, but between the audio problems and now we have our internet problems that we don't have the live listeners right now, we're pretty much doing Part B for tape this week.

484
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:04,229
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like poltergeist is in the house tonight.

485
00:40:04,329 --> 00:40:05,651
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what the hell is going on.

486
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,151
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize to the listeners.

487
00:40:08,371 --> 00:40:09,091
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what's up.

488
00:40:09,351 --> 00:40:10,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Shit happens, though.

489
00:40:10,172 --> 00:40:10,552
[SPEAKER_08]: What can you expect?

490
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,953
[SPEAKER_08]: You get what you pay for, right?

491
00:40:12,033 --> 00:40:12,853
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a free program.

492
00:40:12,873 --> 00:40:13,413
[SPEAKER_08]: What can you say?

493
00:40:13,553 --> 00:40:14,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn straight.

494
00:40:14,174 --> 00:40:14,934
[SPEAKER_08]: We try our best.

495
00:40:15,354 --> 00:40:16,175
[SPEAKER_08]: We gotta keep it moving.

496
00:40:16,355 --> 00:40:17,375
[SPEAKER_09]: We do better than Yaris.

497
00:40:17,695 --> 00:40:18,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's true.

498
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:19,656
[SPEAKER_08]: We do a better job at it than Yaris.

499
00:40:19,696 --> 00:40:20,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Puppy, your FU's.

500
00:40:21,657 --> 00:40:22,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, let's see.

501
00:40:22,978 --> 00:40:26,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Comcast gets one for internet going down at my apartment earlier today.

502
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,542
[SPEAKER_09]: And... Wow, I... Otherwise, I had a good week.

503
00:40:32,883 --> 00:40:33,643
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a surprise.

504
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:38,582
[SPEAKER_08]: FU to you for having such a good week, bastard.

505
00:40:39,182 --> 00:40:40,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Sucks to be you, then.

506
00:40:41,003 --> 00:40:41,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris, your FU of the week.

507
00:40:42,423 --> 00:40:45,784
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week goes to my dad's girlfriend.

508
00:40:47,084 --> 00:40:52,206
[SPEAKER_04]: She needs to know that she's 33 now, and not 13.

509
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:57,267
[SPEAKER_04]: It needs to kind of take some responsibility for her fucking actions.

510
00:40:58,027 --> 00:41:01,188
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, this is the biggest one, needs to realize...

511
00:41:02,176 --> 00:41:08,320
[SPEAKER_04]: that if you cannot accept the consequences of having a child, then don't get knocked up in the first place.

512
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:15,264
[SPEAKER_04]: She literally told me, and I quote, because I told everyone that I'm moving to Wisconsin in March.

513
00:41:16,024 --> 00:41:18,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you cannot... She's Japanese, by the way.

514
00:41:18,386 --> 00:41:19,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not trying to make fun of her.

515
00:41:19,426 --> 00:41:20,767
[SPEAKER_04]: This is exactly how she sounds.

516
00:41:21,327 --> 00:41:25,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you cannot move to... You have to move here and take care of our babies.

517
00:41:27,391 --> 00:41:30,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Elise, it's the parents' job to take care of the babies.

518
00:41:31,966 --> 00:41:36,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, being a parent is a full-time job.

519
00:41:37,656 --> 00:41:38,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah!

520
00:41:38,197 --> 00:41:39,419
[SPEAKER_04]: No shit, Sherlock!

521
00:41:42,305 --> 00:41:42,845
[SPEAKER_04]: God!

522
00:41:42,865 --> 00:41:49,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I seriously thought, think, she thinks that I was going to stay there and take care of their little bundle of joy.

523
00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:52,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm going to be a big sister and all, but I ain't taking care of it.

524
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,070
[SPEAKER_04]: It ain't my responsibility.

525
00:41:54,651 --> 00:41:56,852
[SPEAKER_04]: She's just like, she seriously acts like she's 13.

526
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,993
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what my dad sees in her.

527
00:41:59,313 --> 00:42:00,794
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he's having a midlife crisis.

528
00:42:00,814 --> 00:42:01,154
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like 53.

529
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:06,641
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the level of stupid She got in a car crash the other week

530
00:42:32,108 --> 00:42:36,810
[SPEAKER_04]: and they, everyone who was involved in the car accident got her information, got everything they needed to get.

531
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,391
[SPEAKER_04]: She didn't get their names even.

532
00:42:39,611 --> 00:42:40,611
[SPEAKER_04]: She didn't get anything.

533
00:42:40,631 --> 00:42:44,773
[SPEAKER_04]: There was nothing that she took away from this car crash except excuses.

534
00:42:44,873 --> 00:42:47,734
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course it's her fault because she's the one who crashed into them.

535
00:42:50,996 --> 00:42:51,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn woman.

536
00:42:53,497 --> 00:42:53,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

537
00:42:53,897 --> 00:42:54,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done.

538
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:55,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

539
00:42:56,178 --> 00:42:57,358
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to do it for the FUs of the week.

540
00:42:57,398 --> 00:42:59,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, the Poltergeist is still affecting our network.

541
00:42:59,479 --> 00:43:00,379
[SPEAKER_08]: We're still not live.

542
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:01,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Bummer.

543
00:43:02,368 --> 00:43:03,369
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, it's like Halloween.

544
00:43:03,429 --> 00:43:05,090
[SPEAKER_08]: This place is haunted.

545
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:05,771
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

546
00:43:06,491 --> 00:43:07,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, thank you.

547
00:43:07,712 --> 00:43:09,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris got the little picture of the kitty.

548
00:43:09,193 --> 00:43:10,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, I'll fix it.

549
00:43:11,134 --> 00:43:11,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

550
00:43:12,315 --> 00:43:12,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

551
00:43:12,996 --> 00:43:13,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Just what I need.

552
00:43:15,836 --> 00:43:17,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, maybe the mailbag will fix it.

553
00:43:17,317 --> 00:43:20,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if this keeps up, unfortunately, we're not going to be able to get to Skype tonight.

554
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:22,200
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know some folks wanted to call in and do some game reviews.

555
00:43:22,581 --> 00:43:24,522
[SPEAKER_08]: But at least there's the old mailbag.

556
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:30,246
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you email us at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, it's practically the old-fashioned way of interacting with a podcast at this point.

557
00:43:30,266 --> 00:43:34,129
[SPEAKER_08]: But when the newfangled stuff breaks, we turn to the mailbag.

558
00:43:34,169 --> 00:43:35,410
[SPEAKER_08]: So mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

559
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:38,152
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura is going to open it up and pick some of her favorites right now.

560
00:43:39,012 --> 00:43:39,733
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm tangled up.

561
00:43:40,313 --> 00:43:41,394
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't do it by myself.

562
00:43:42,695 --> 00:43:44,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, listen.

563
00:43:46,337 --> 00:43:47,717
[SPEAKER_06]: It is time for the mailbag.

564
00:43:48,697 --> 00:43:52,038
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, first thing actually comes from Rob with two B's.

565
00:43:53,238 --> 00:43:58,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, he sent a link to a story, and this is very Darwin award-y.

566
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, in Moscow, a ten-year-old committed suicide after parents banned computer games.

567
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:10,381
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to, uh, his name was, um, Andrei Smirnoff, which, I'm not gonna say anything.

568
00:44:10,401 --> 00:44:10,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

569
00:44:14,817 --> 00:44:40,878
[SPEAKER_06]: who was a class 3 student jumped to his death after his parents were blaming his bad conduct in school and poor performance in class on video games and he had made a comment about it in his diary and then jumped out of a window so I'm like yeah that just means that your kid was fucked in the head also and to continue with his email

570
00:44:41,525 --> 00:44:47,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I loved your argument about microtransactions and other poorly named events.

571
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:54,810
[SPEAKER_06]: If you really want to draw a line objectively, a transaction, in quotes, is a payment in monetary units.

572
00:44:55,370 --> 00:45:02,093
[SPEAKER_06]: A microtransaction would be a one-one-thousandth of a transaction, or less than one penny.

573
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:09,976
[SPEAKER_06]: If you remember, the office space embezzlement scenario was based upon taking the money less than one cent off every transaction and adding them up.

574
00:45:11,895 --> 00:45:21,807
[SPEAKER_06]: So in that case, and if you are using pure terminology, a microtransaction would have to consist of less than one one-thousandth of a penny.

575
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:25,531
[SPEAKER_06]: So therefore, the term microtransaction is actually an incorrect term.

576
00:45:26,132 --> 00:45:26,872
[SPEAKER_06]: I was right.

577
00:45:27,053 --> 00:45:28,735
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to have this stupid argument again.

578
00:45:31,489 --> 00:45:38,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's my whole thing that I hate about modern language use is this whole let's just completely define everything but use really bad definitions.

579
00:45:39,032 --> 00:45:39,212
[SPEAKER_06]: LOL.

580
00:45:39,912 --> 00:45:40,912
[SPEAKER_06]: ROTFL.

581
00:45:41,253 --> 00:45:42,853
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's not what I'm talking about.

582
00:45:44,153 --> 00:45:44,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Preboarding.

583
00:45:46,974 --> 00:45:52,376
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, putting unnecessary prefixes to words.

584
00:45:55,117 --> 00:45:56,658
[SPEAKER_06]: George Carlin did point that out, didn't he?

585
00:45:56,678 --> 00:45:57,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

586
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:01,463
[SPEAKER_10]: But then again, there's also literal and, you know, applied means of things.

587
00:46:01,523 --> 00:46:05,646
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, micromachines were not one thousandth the size of a car.

588
00:46:06,307 --> 00:46:07,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I think that they were.

589
00:46:07,368 --> 00:46:09,049
[SPEAKER_10]: They were smaller.

590
00:46:09,529 --> 00:46:09,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

591
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:11,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that they were one thousandth.

592
00:46:11,911 --> 00:46:12,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

593
00:46:12,632 --> 00:46:13,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Shit.

594
00:46:13,592 --> 00:46:14,553
[SPEAKER_10]: They were smaller.

595
00:46:14,653 --> 00:46:15,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

596
00:46:15,114 --> 00:46:16,074
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all that matters.

597
00:46:16,134 --> 00:46:17,956
[SPEAKER_10]: No one's going to do the fucking scale shit.

598
00:46:17,976 --> 00:46:19,157
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not model building.

599
00:46:19,217 --> 00:46:19,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

600
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:21,198
[SPEAKER_08]: No fucking train sets here.

601
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:24,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you say this compares to how it works?

602
00:46:24,521 --> 00:46:27,123
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an item on the menu called the cheese quesadilla.

603
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:30,331
[SPEAKER_08]: When a quesadilla literally means, you know, cheese.

604
00:46:30,671 --> 00:46:34,893
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like you're ordering a peanut peanut butter sandwich or something.

605
00:46:36,254 --> 00:46:37,754
[SPEAKER_08]: You're ordering a cheese cheese sandwich.

606
00:46:37,774 --> 00:46:39,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Or it's like ordering chai tea.

607
00:46:39,695 --> 00:46:40,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Because chai means tea.

608
00:46:42,516 --> 00:46:47,258
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I think that it's more or less... You know, everybody in the world is stupid.

609
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:49,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's accommodate the language to everybody's stupidity.

610
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,640
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like to...

611
00:46:52,466 --> 00:46:53,606
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not like to live in a world where...

612
00:47:18,473 --> 00:47:25,199
[SPEAKER_06]: She did show me the one I have in my cubicle with a picture of Captain Kirk saying, James T. Kirk, I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of how awesome I am.

613
00:47:25,699 --> 00:47:25,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Emails?

614
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:27,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

615
00:47:27,641 --> 00:47:29,722
[SPEAKER_06]: This one comes from One Night Stands.

616
00:47:31,424 --> 00:47:38,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, I just recently started to listen to your podcast and I must say that I really like them as they don't bore me, except for the Onion Audio and Video podcast.

617
00:47:39,851 --> 00:47:45,576
[SPEAKER_06]: A few times on the show, Sky, I think I'm still trying to figure out the difference between the two guys, has mentioned that he's gay.

618
00:47:46,743 --> 00:48:01,094
[SPEAKER_06]: The first time I thought he was just joking and then I was listening to your most recent one where Skye and Jamie went to the movies and started talking about the sanctity of marriage and then running off to Vegas to get married to immediately divorce.

619
00:48:01,994 --> 00:48:03,295
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just something about being gay.

620
00:48:04,216 --> 00:48:07,999
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know it's tacky to dig into other people's lives and find out what their sexual orientation is.

621
00:48:08,459 --> 00:48:13,563
[SPEAKER_06]: I long for the days when people like Perez Hilton were branded with a scarlet letter, probably G for gossip.

622
00:48:14,043 --> 00:48:15,224
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been wondering, are you gay?

623
00:48:18,663 --> 00:48:21,266
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very happy to be on this program.

624
00:48:22,507 --> 00:48:25,330
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that it's great to hear that one of the three main people is.

625
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:27,211
[SPEAKER_06]: As a gay gamer, I think it's great to hear.

626
00:48:27,732 --> 00:48:32,196
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great to see celebrities being out and proud and know the fan base is not swayed by their sexual preference.

627
00:48:32,256 --> 00:48:33,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Sky, DarkSakura, Loki, keep up the good work.

628
00:48:34,098 --> 00:48:35,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that person insinuating I'm a celebrity?

629
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Rad!

630
00:48:38,061 --> 00:48:39,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, ego plus plus.

631
00:48:39,443 --> 00:48:41,865
[SPEAKER_06]: And I look forward to hearing your next podcast.

632
00:48:42,745 --> 00:48:43,146
[SPEAKER_06]: P.S.

633
00:48:43,206 --> 00:48:44,908
[SPEAKER_06]: My handle is a Simpsons reference.

634
00:48:45,409 --> 00:48:46,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone thinks it's a sex thing.

635
00:48:47,992 --> 00:48:48,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

636
00:48:48,633 --> 00:48:49,594
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one night stands.

637
00:48:49,855 --> 00:48:50,516
[SPEAKER_08]: One night stands.

638
00:48:52,105 --> 00:48:55,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that, usually that's what you'd find on gay.com, one night stands.

639
00:48:55,666 --> 00:49:02,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, I'm Sky, the voice you hear right now is, or Rob, I don't really, not a lot of people call me Sky anymore, but Rob, and yeah, I'm gay.

640
00:49:02,328 --> 00:49:03,829
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but that's not what the show's all about.

641
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:05,589
[SPEAKER_08]: The show's about video games, but I understand.

642
00:49:05,729 --> 00:49:07,130
[SPEAKER_08]: I totally understand where you're coming from.

643
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:21,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Because sometimes, I can kind of speak from experience, it's kind of hard to find, gay gamers are in an interesting niche, I think, because in gaming culture, you know, obviously thanks to the Xbox Lives of the world, where, you know, fag, fag, fag,

644
00:49:21,494 --> 00:49:21,794
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

645
00:49:36,505 --> 00:49:37,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Click, click, mute, warn.

646
00:49:37,867 --> 00:49:38,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Love Halo 3.

647
00:49:38,668 --> 00:49:40,210
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because Rob is an attention whore.

648
00:49:41,151 --> 00:49:42,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and then in the other side of it.

649
00:49:42,853 --> 00:49:47,279
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have the gaming culture frowns on gays to some extent.

650
00:49:47,399 --> 00:49:48,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously not everybody.

651
00:49:48,601 --> 00:49:50,083
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a few bad apples ruining the barrel.

652
00:49:50,323 --> 00:49:51,765
[SPEAKER_08]: But then you have in gay culture...

653
00:49:52,165 --> 00:49:57,467
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like, oh, you mean you don't shop at, you know, Nordstrom's and you don't listen to Madonna?

654
00:49:57,587 --> 00:49:58,787
[SPEAKER_08]: And why don't you go to the club with us?

655
00:49:58,827 --> 00:50:00,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do you have to stay home and play games?

656
00:50:00,868 --> 00:50:02,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, let's go out, you know.

657
00:50:03,509 --> 00:50:08,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go get Madonna tickets for $250 and, you know, let's do crack.

658
00:50:08,791 --> 00:50:11,032
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, you know.

659
00:50:11,072 --> 00:50:11,592
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not, again.

660
00:50:12,947 --> 00:50:21,590
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying all gays are like that, but unfortunately, you know, I felt that kind of judgment from some of those very superficial people that, you know, oh, you play games?

661
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:24,872
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like a, you know, that's a little kid thing, or that's not a gay thing.

662
00:50:24,892 --> 00:50:26,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, who's to say what is what?

663
00:50:26,712 --> 00:50:28,233
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, people like what they like.

664
00:50:28,613 --> 00:50:37,837
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, you know, and I don't like to usually advertise the fact I'm gay on the program because this is not the, oh my god, the really big gay podcast about video games!

665
00:50:40,015 --> 00:50:44,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay guys, I cannot wait to review Gears of War because that is hot.

666
00:50:44,996 --> 00:50:47,136
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you missed Rob singing show tunes last week.

667
00:50:48,417 --> 00:50:50,057
[SPEAKER_08]: We already busted out the show tunes last week.

668
00:50:50,077 --> 00:50:54,558
[SPEAKER_08]: But no, in all seriousness, again, it's just that, you know, it is what it is.

669
00:50:55,218 --> 00:51:00,699
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gay, but I also, I've been playing video games a lot longer than I've been dating men.

670
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:02,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's put it that way, I guess.

671
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:03,419
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

672
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:05,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris is a lesbian.

673
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm a very big dyke.

674
00:51:08,263 --> 00:51:09,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Dyke Power, Yo.

675
00:51:10,725 --> 00:51:11,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I like boobies.

676
00:51:11,786 --> 00:51:16,269
[SPEAKER_08]: But most of all, we like games, so that's what it really boils down to.

677
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:17,110
[SPEAKER_08]: And boobies.

678
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:22,134
[SPEAKER_08]: I like boobies too, so that's I guess something everybody... I think it's a unanimous vote in this room that boobies are great.

679
00:51:22,154 --> 00:51:22,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Boobies, yes.

680
00:51:23,295 --> 00:51:24,676
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, all in favor of boobies?

681
00:51:25,016 --> 00:51:25,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

682
00:51:26,177 --> 00:51:26,858
[SPEAKER_01]: All opposed?

683
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,082
[SPEAKER_10]: I was too late on the four boobies.

684
00:51:32,943 --> 00:51:33,203
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

685
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:34,264
[SPEAKER_01]: We have unanimous...

686
00:51:36,071 --> 00:51:38,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what else to say to that email.

687
00:51:39,152 --> 00:51:43,613
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to have to tell William that somebody couldn't figure it out.

688
00:51:43,933 --> 00:51:44,133
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

689
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:45,753
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kidding.

690
00:51:46,113 --> 00:51:47,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the thing, though.

691
00:51:47,673 --> 00:51:50,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Perez Hilton totally sold out.

692
00:51:50,114 --> 00:51:52,714
[SPEAKER_08]: He used to be cool a year ago, but totally sold out.

693
00:51:52,994 --> 00:51:54,615
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got to find some new blogs to read, dude.

694
00:51:54,955 --> 00:51:55,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

695
00:51:55,495 --> 00:51:56,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Perez Hilton kind of sold out.

696
00:51:57,335 --> 00:51:59,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Drawing coke coming out of people's noses isn't funny anymore, sorry to say.

697
00:52:00,876 --> 00:52:01,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Perez Hilton?

698
00:52:01,836 --> 00:52:02,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that website.

699
00:52:02,436 --> 00:52:03,777
[SPEAKER_08]: The Gossip Blogger.

700
00:52:04,477 --> 00:52:04,617
Oh!

701
00:52:04,697 --> 00:52:05,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

702
00:52:05,277 --> 00:52:05,557
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

703
00:52:05,936 --> 00:52:07,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, sorry.

704
00:52:07,277 --> 00:52:07,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Next email.

705
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:08,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Next email.

706
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:09,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, okay.

707
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,462
[SPEAKER_06]: God, this is such awful spelling.

708
00:52:11,522 --> 00:52:12,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, whoever you are.

709
00:52:13,744 --> 00:52:14,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Lycan.

710
00:52:14,505 --> 00:52:14,866
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

711
00:52:15,106 --> 00:52:17,188
[SPEAKER_08]: One more thing on the gay thing because I forgot to mention this.

712
00:52:17,749 --> 00:52:23,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Praise and happy thoughts and thank yous to the folks who make websites for the...

713
00:52:24,315 --> 00:52:25,055
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

714
00:52:47,301 --> 00:52:52,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Praise to those people that make the niches on the internet for those kind of people to find each other.

715
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:57,564
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just talking in general too, not just gay and gaming, but all types of minorities.

716
00:52:58,004 --> 00:53:00,085
[SPEAKER_08]: So, hooray.

717
00:53:00,185 --> 00:53:00,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we can move on.

718
00:53:01,025 --> 00:53:04,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey Orange Lounge, I'm kind of a new listener, but I already say you guys rock.

719
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:05,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have a question.

720
00:53:05,806 --> 00:53:14,169
[SPEAKER_06]: You talk about Final Fantasy a lot, but I've never heard you talk about Final Fantasy X. Is there a reason, as I've been playing it a lot recently, this is from Lycan.

721
00:53:14,557 --> 00:53:18,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, am I on crack or wasn't there an email last week where we talked about Final Fantasy X?

722
00:53:18,381 --> 00:53:20,182
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear to God it came up like last week or two weeks ago.

723
00:53:20,202 --> 00:53:28,630
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we did talk about Final Fantasy X. Maybe this person's behind in their podcast listening, so we'll give them a bye, but... That and Final Fantasy X's fucking old.

724
00:53:29,551 --> 00:53:32,393
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if we're on like Final Fantasy XII now.

725
00:53:32,814 --> 00:53:33,294
[SPEAKER_10]: No, seriously.

726
00:53:34,315 --> 00:53:35,476
[SPEAKER_10]: Played that game like years ago.

727
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:37,718
[SPEAKER_10]: It was an awesome game, but it was years ago.

728
00:53:37,738 --> 00:53:38,879
[SPEAKER_06]: X was great, but we've moved on.

729
00:53:38,919 --> 00:53:39,720
[SPEAKER_10]: X2, not so great.

730
00:53:40,481 --> 00:53:40,781
[SPEAKER_01]: We're with...

731
00:53:43,055 --> 00:53:44,916
[SPEAKER_06]: This fandom is still on seven.

732
00:53:45,136 --> 00:53:46,237
[SPEAKER_08]: The fandom for ten.

733
00:53:46,277 --> 00:53:53,241
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you go to any, you know, anime convention, guaranteed you're going to see a Tubby Yuna.

734
00:53:53,461 --> 00:53:53,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Somewhere.

735
00:53:54,362 --> 00:53:54,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Always.

736
00:53:56,223 --> 00:53:56,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Always.

737
00:53:56,663 --> 00:53:58,124
[SPEAKER_08]: So the fandom is never going to die.

738
00:53:59,104 --> 00:54:01,086
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, you know, a Waka with a pooch.

739
00:54:01,206 --> 00:54:08,070
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's... You know what really bothers me is the pregnant fetish fan art.

740
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:08,970
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

741
00:54:10,011 --> 00:54:10,831
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on DeviantArt.

742
00:54:11,031 --> 00:54:11,932
[SPEAKER_08]: All over DeviantArt.

743
00:54:11,992 --> 00:54:12,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

744
00:54:12,232 --> 00:54:12,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

745
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:17,903
[SPEAKER_08]: When I talked about the whole, like, minority subculture thing, maybe there are a few exceptions.

746
00:54:19,783 --> 00:54:26,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they have a big, big subculture of people who like, what is it, inflated art?

747
00:54:26,945 --> 00:54:28,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Where basically they make girls.

748
00:54:29,086 --> 00:54:29,746
[SPEAKER_04]: It's mostly girls.

749
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,187
[SPEAKER_04]: With boobs that are three times the size of their bodies?

750
00:54:32,467 --> 00:54:32,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

751
00:54:33,087 --> 00:54:37,909
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're, like, they're big, they're fat, like, way more physically than they should be.

752
00:54:38,329 --> 00:54:39,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, in any way, shape, or form.

753
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:42,030
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not physically possible for these people to breathe.

754
00:54:43,403 --> 00:54:45,724
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I need to rethink my argument on the counterculture thing.

755
00:54:45,764 --> 00:54:47,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I need to rethink those kudos a little bit.

756
00:54:48,726 --> 00:55:00,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so hypocritical because I sit there and I go, I don't have to look at that art, but then I see it on the favorites page and I just go, that shit should not be here.

757
00:55:01,505 --> 00:55:04,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's so fucking... You know, most of it is really bad, too.

758
00:55:04,848 --> 00:55:05,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, these people can't draw.

759
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:13,534
[SPEAKER_04]: But the only reason that it ends up on the favorite page is because some... There's a bunch of morons out there who are wanking to this.

760
00:55:13,674 --> 00:55:14,675
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's disgusting.

761
00:55:15,215 --> 00:55:18,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you sure they just aren't out of proportion just because they are bad artists?

762
00:55:18,638 --> 00:55:20,139
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, sometimes I wonder.

763
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:22,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they accidentally got it really big.

764
00:55:22,941 --> 00:55:24,242
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they draw fat very well.

765
00:55:24,462 --> 00:55:25,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can show you.

766
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:26,344
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really disgusting.

767
00:55:26,564 --> 00:55:27,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can draw fat.

768
00:55:27,585 --> 00:55:29,206
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a circle with a stick.

769
00:55:29,673 --> 00:55:32,535
[SPEAKER_09]: for leg, stick for arm, stick for neck, circle for head.

770
00:55:33,395 --> 00:55:40,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, like the chicken Willy Wonka when she ate the blueberry thing.

771
00:55:40,439 --> 00:55:44,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Next email, please.

772
00:55:45,142 --> 00:55:46,983
[SPEAKER_08]: From Final Fantasy X to snozzberries.

773
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:49,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, you're going to ask us a question like that, that's what you're going to get.

774
00:55:50,465 --> 00:55:52,025
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think of Final Fantasy X?

775
00:55:52,145 --> 00:55:52,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Snozzberries.

776
00:55:54,193 --> 00:55:55,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey OLR, it's Nintendo Maniac 64.

777
00:55:56,014 --> 00:56:01,579
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed something this week with the update for Kirby's Final Smash on the Smash Bros.

778
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:02,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Brawl site.

779
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:10,646
[SPEAKER_06]: If you compare the bottom of the Japanese webpage to the English or any other language page, you notice that the Japanese version has some kind of extra sound clip recording.

780
00:56:11,226 --> 00:56:12,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Any idea what this might be?

781
00:56:13,067 --> 00:56:18,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, since Rob's computer is the primary, we cannot correctly answer this question.

782
00:56:18,572 --> 00:56:19,052
[SPEAKER_06]: So next!

783
00:56:19,562 --> 00:56:23,145
[SPEAKER_08]: But I will hypothesize, since they're saying it's an audio thing, right?

784
00:56:23,205 --> 00:56:24,006
[SPEAKER_08]: I will hypothesize.

785
00:56:24,346 --> 00:56:29,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps it is a piece of work that has not been translated or brought over yet.

786
00:56:29,471 --> 00:56:30,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Or simply it was just an oversight.

787
00:56:30,812 --> 00:56:33,255
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's curvy, why would it have any words to it?

788
00:56:33,295 --> 00:56:33,855
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's true.

789
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:35,617
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's just an oversight then.

790
00:56:35,957 --> 00:56:37,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you're being a little tinfoil hat-ish.

791
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:38,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't worry just yet.

792
00:56:40,121 --> 00:56:41,823
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's just an oversight, so don't worry.

793
00:56:41,843 --> 00:56:43,124
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

794
00:56:43,144 --> 00:56:43,844
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an example.

795
00:56:43,904 --> 00:56:45,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my God!

796
00:56:47,634 --> 00:56:49,936
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell is that?

797
00:56:50,116 --> 00:56:59,925
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually a lot better than... There's a picture on DeviantArt, and it's on the favorites page, and it's actually a lot better than the most of the stuff.

798
00:57:00,025 --> 00:57:03,288
[SPEAKER_04]: At least this girl is somewhat in proportion, but Jesus Christ.

799
00:57:04,389 --> 00:57:05,770
[SPEAKER_08]: She looks like a walrus.

800
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:09,793
[SPEAKER_08]: She looks like she's about ready to go goo-goo-ka-choo, okay, for one.

801
00:57:10,874 --> 00:57:15,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, for B, did you ever see... And this is great radio, by the way, because I'm responding to a picture...

802
00:57:16,296 --> 00:57:20,439
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm totally being a hypocrite right now with this whole thing that I said, you know, oh, the countercultures are great.

803
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:21,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Not this.

804
00:57:22,501 --> 00:57:25,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything I said earlier, this is not a part of that.

805
00:57:25,403 --> 00:57:25,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Do not want.

806
00:57:26,064 --> 00:57:26,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Do not want.

807
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:27,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

808
00:57:27,625 --> 00:57:28,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the thing.

809
00:57:29,186 --> 00:57:33,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, did you ever see that face as a death where the guy had elephantitis of the balls?

810
00:57:33,729 --> 00:57:34,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

811
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:35,390
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what her tits look like.

812
00:57:37,252 --> 00:57:37,592
What?

813
00:57:39,593 --> 00:57:40,154
[SPEAKER_08]: What website?

814
00:57:40,314 --> 00:57:41,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it DeviantArt?

815
00:57:41,235 --> 00:57:41,595
[SPEAKER_08]: DeviantArt.

816
00:57:42,879 --> 00:57:44,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to have a fun time?

817
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:51,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to deviantart.com and in the search, type inflation and just watch the funny shit happen.

818
00:57:51,824 --> 00:57:55,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear, it's just like, people that should not be.

819
00:57:56,107 --> 00:58:01,270
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like a bunch of freaking world record tumors like I saw on Ripley's Believe It or Not.

820
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:02,031
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you know what?

821
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:03,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you know what?

822
00:58:04,072 --> 00:58:05,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't and go play video games instead.

823
00:58:05,753 --> 00:58:06,974
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll thank us later.

824
00:58:08,495 --> 00:58:08,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

825
00:58:09,155 --> 00:58:09,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no.

826
00:58:09,735 --> 00:58:10,276
[SPEAKER_08]: That can't be real.

827
00:58:10,316 --> 00:58:10,776
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to show me.

828
00:58:12,452 --> 00:58:14,173
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like somebody's Halloween costume.

829
00:58:14,193 --> 00:58:14,933
[SPEAKER_08]: See, now that's funny.

830
00:58:15,173 --> 00:58:20,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody looks like she has beach balls for titties.

831
00:58:23,497 --> 00:58:24,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Next email, please.

832
00:58:24,617 --> 00:58:25,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Do not want.

833
00:58:26,298 --> 00:58:27,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, I love the show.

834
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:30,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wanted to know if you've seen the masterpiece that is Dead Fantasy 1.

835
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,041
[SPEAKER_06]: If not, check it out now.

836
00:58:33,101 --> 00:58:34,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Congrats on another milestone.

837
00:58:34,921 --> 00:58:37,683
[SPEAKER_06]: 250 is certainly an accomplishment for an independent podcast.

838
00:58:38,023 --> 00:58:39,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Pat yourselves on the ass.

839
00:58:39,864 --> 00:58:40,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for reading this.

840
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,040
[SPEAKER_06]: That's from Resimo.

841
00:59:05,128 --> 00:59:06,749
[SPEAKER_10]: It has some really kick-ass stuff, though.

842
00:59:06,789 --> 00:59:12,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, they have a picture of, like, Cloud as a chick on a bike, and it looks really good.

843
00:59:12,533 --> 00:59:16,276
[SPEAKER_10]: But definitely check out, like, you know, the Haloid and Dead Fantasy stuff.

844
00:59:16,296 --> 00:59:19,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll have to show it in the studio after the show.

845
00:59:19,479 --> 00:59:26,764
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's seriously some kick-ass wire foo shit that a lot of it borrowed heavily from The Matrix.

846
00:59:26,864 --> 00:59:27,985
[SPEAKER_10]: But really awesome.

847
00:59:28,005 --> 00:59:28,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Check it out.

848
00:59:31,124 --> 00:59:32,104
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it for the emails.

849
00:59:32,164 --> 00:59:34,446
[SPEAKER_06]: How about something that has nothing to do with inflation?

850
00:59:34,506 --> 00:59:36,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris, put the inflation away.

851
00:59:38,287 --> 00:59:43,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Although seriously, part of me wants to make the album art for Orange Lounge Radio this week, one of those pictures.

852
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:46,171
[SPEAKER_08]: If there weren't copyright issues, I'd totally do it.

853
00:59:46,251 --> 00:59:48,852
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, let's move on.

854
00:59:48,912 --> 00:59:49,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout, Chris.

855
00:59:49,512 --> 00:59:50,373
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not looking at inflation.

856
00:59:50,393 --> 00:59:50,833
[SPEAKER_08]: It's his fault.

857
00:59:52,013 --> 00:59:52,294
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

858
00:59:53,154 --> 00:59:53,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

859
00:59:53,954 --> 00:59:54,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, it's your turn.

860
00:59:56,175 --> 01:00:00,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, let's get this train back in the tracks here.

861
01:00:00,743 --> 01:00:22,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, anyways, um, Games for Windows Live is getting an update in November as well, and of course, you know, normally Xbox Live, those are spring and fall updates, so it sounds around the, about around the time, um, we'll be seeing an update for Live as well on 360, but Games for Windows Live will become 1.2, and with that, there's gonna be some improvements to, um,

862
01:00:23,618 --> 01:00:24,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

863
01:00:54,455 --> 01:01:00,622
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

864
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:16,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

865
01:01:33,685 --> 01:01:46,015
[SPEAKER_08]: And according to the site this originally ran on, quote, it's stylistically and gameplay-wise, the game has abandoned the dark edginess of the last two titles in favor of a fantastical cross between the Sands of Time, Ico, and Zelda.

866
01:01:46,956 --> 01:01:50,038
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, when you put it that way, it sounds a little fanboyish to me, but you never know.

867
01:01:50,058 --> 01:01:54,422
[SPEAKER_10]: At the same time, though, that's about the time I think that the Prince of Persia movies are supposed to be coming out as well.

868
01:01:55,481 --> 01:01:58,163
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, obviously the Prince of Persia series is not a dead series.

869
01:01:58,363 --> 01:02:01,466
[SPEAKER_08]: So, big fat duh that there's another game coming out.

870
01:02:01,866 --> 01:02:04,107
[SPEAKER_08]: But is it a prequel?

871
01:02:04,148 --> 01:02:05,288
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be interesting.

872
01:02:05,609 --> 01:02:06,309
[SPEAKER_08]: And who knows?

873
01:02:06,369 --> 01:02:07,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's actually the movie version.

874
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:09,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Because maybe they're going in a different direction with the movie.

875
01:02:09,952 --> 01:02:13,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it isn't based on existing storyline and these games are there to support the movie.

876
01:02:14,315 --> 01:02:14,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

877
01:02:14,976 --> 01:02:16,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Theories abound everywhere.

878
01:02:16,977 --> 01:02:18,478
[SPEAKER_08]: But we don't know for sure until next year.

879
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is...

880
01:02:22,967 --> 01:02:26,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Fairly interesting as far as something that may or may not be.

881
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:35,876
[SPEAKER_06]: But one of SNK's, to me, one of the games that I like the best from them, Magician Lord, has an ESRB rating.

882
01:02:37,497 --> 01:02:41,579
[SPEAKER_06]: So it most likely will not be only for Japan.

883
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:46,002
[SPEAKER_06]: We could see it coming out on the virtual console for Wii very soon.

884
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:46,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck yeah.

885
01:02:47,343 --> 01:02:48,464
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I got to say about that.

886
01:02:49,528 --> 01:03:00,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, you go through all these different levels that can turn your character into different types of, I guess, elemental type characters.

887
01:03:01,381 --> 01:03:02,302
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's a pretty good game.

888
01:03:02,703 --> 01:03:04,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Magician Lord is pretty hardcore awesome.

889
01:03:07,368 --> 01:03:07,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

890
01:03:09,127 --> 01:03:11,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, other sorts of awesome.

891
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:16,954
[SPEAKER_10]: There was before a problem with the Bioshock PC version, of course.

892
01:03:17,014 --> 01:03:21,558
[SPEAKER_10]: People getting pissed off that you can only have three different activations available for that.

893
01:03:21,618 --> 01:03:26,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, now they have a brand new tool that's been released officially.

894
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:35,871
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an activation revoke tool and will allow you to revoke some of the activations that you have so that if you want to install on a different PC...

895
01:03:37,047 --> 01:03:37,607
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do that.

896
01:03:37,808 --> 01:03:51,034
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically allow you to race and reload copies of Bioshock onto your PC as many times as you want without using up one of your activation tokens provided you don't make any major changes to your current hardware.

897
01:03:51,954 --> 01:03:55,676
[SPEAKER_10]: And, of course, the tool is downloadable on the Cult of Rapture website.

898
01:03:57,097 --> 01:03:58,137
[SPEAKER_10]: So, awesome.

899
01:03:58,157 --> 01:03:59,738
[SPEAKER_10]: At least that they're trying to fix some stuff.

900
01:04:00,686 --> 01:04:01,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching.

901
01:04:01,407 --> 01:04:01,788
[SPEAKER_08]: See you next time.

902
01:04:13,343 --> 01:04:15,324
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

903
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:38,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I want to call in sometime, but I'm just not around on Sunday nights.

904
01:04:38,378 --> 01:04:39,098
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a bad time for me.

905
01:04:39,379 --> 01:04:42,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't forget, we have voicemail there at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

906
01:04:42,301 --> 01:04:46,704
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you wanted to call in tonight, call in and leave a voicemail, and we'll try to play it on next week's show.

907
01:04:46,984 --> 01:04:49,867
[SPEAKER_08]: The only reason we haven't been playing voicemails lately is because we haven't been getting a lot.

908
01:04:50,167 --> 01:04:51,788
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we get some good ones, we'll definitely play them.

909
01:04:52,028 --> 01:04:58,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Just my only advice, try to just keep it under two minutes because when you go on and ramble and ramble, it makes us want to play it less because, you know,

910
01:04:58,666 --> 01:05:00,127
[SPEAKER_08]: The show is for us to ramble and ramble.

911
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:00,307
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

912
01:05:00,867 --> 01:05:02,508
[SPEAKER_08]: We want you guys to definitely have a say as well.

913
01:05:02,548 --> 01:05:03,488
[SPEAKER_08]: So the Skype line is there.

914
01:05:03,568 --> 01:05:06,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Or our email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

915
01:05:06,809 --> 01:05:10,531
[SPEAKER_08]: And apologies to our live listeners who got cut off tonight.

916
01:05:10,951 --> 01:05:11,571
[SPEAKER_08]: What can I say?

917
01:05:11,671 --> 01:05:13,312
[SPEAKER_08]: The show was just all kinds of broken tonight.

918
01:05:13,632 --> 01:05:15,733
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like this whole year old now quit curse.

919
01:05:16,593 --> 01:05:17,494
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what else to say.

920
01:05:17,874 --> 01:05:20,975
[SPEAKER_08]: But we will go around and get some last minute stories, of which I'm sure Loki's got to have some.

921
01:05:21,355 --> 01:05:21,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

922
01:05:21,896 --> 01:05:22,436
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?

923
01:05:22,636 --> 01:05:23,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, let's see here.

924
01:05:23,857 --> 01:05:26,738
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some interesting pictures coming out from Postal 3.

925
01:05:28,249 --> 01:05:40,597
[SPEAKER_10]: One of which features a new gun, apparently, that's going to be in the game, which features a guy's hand up a badger's ass, and he's firing a badger gun, apparently.

926
01:05:40,797 --> 01:05:43,058
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like Laser Badger or something like that.

927
01:05:43,518 --> 01:05:47,481
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is, and I've got to show this in studio here real quick.

928
01:05:47,721 --> 01:05:48,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you don't have to.

929
01:05:49,062 --> 01:05:49,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I do.

930
01:05:49,742 --> 01:05:55,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Destructoid ran a little interview based on that, and I've got to say, I was already going to buy this game

931
01:05:56,758 --> 01:06:00,961
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm thinking I may buy two copies of this game because it's fucking awesome looking.

932
01:06:04,804 --> 01:06:06,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Go runny with scissors.

933
01:06:06,305 --> 01:06:09,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, they'll be on the badger's ass.

934
01:06:09,568 --> 01:06:14,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I got to respect the fact that they leave nothing to chance as far as offending people.

935
01:06:15,512 --> 01:06:18,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Good luck getting this past the ESRB, though.

936
01:06:18,054 --> 01:06:19,035
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I got to say.

937
01:06:20,796 --> 01:06:21,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Other fun stuff.

938
01:06:22,441 --> 01:06:25,644
[SPEAKER_10]: There's going to be a new tool that's... I can't... Hold on.

939
01:06:25,664 --> 01:06:34,312
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have to say I can't wait for the YouTube where somebody's going to film themselves doing this to the badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, mushroom, mushroom.

940
01:06:35,112 --> 01:06:39,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, seriously, let's take some over-unders on how long before those YouTubes show up.

941
01:06:40,878 --> 01:06:42,159
[SPEAKER_08]: I say they show up before the game.

942
01:06:42,279 --> 01:06:45,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that I've said that, somebody's going to take that picture and put it on YouTube.

943
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:46,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Send us the link when you get it done.

944
01:06:47,773 --> 01:06:52,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, also, Mac's console has some pictures up of a brand new device.

945
01:06:53,095 --> 01:06:59,898
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an adapter to let you use HDMI inputs on your first generation Xbox 360.

946
01:07:00,819 --> 01:07:02,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, the ones without HDMI.

947
01:07:02,739 --> 01:07:07,141
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is from the XCM 1080i HDMI.

948
01:07:07,241 --> 01:07:10,703
[SPEAKER_10]: It's shaped like a disc, and it plugs into the back of your...

949
01:07:12,928 --> 01:07:14,409
[SPEAKER_10]: 360, where the normal AV stuff goes.

950
01:07:14,969 --> 01:07:18,212
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll do HDMI out, and we'll also do DVI out.

951
01:07:18,332 --> 01:07:21,274
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's pretty fucking awesome that that's going to be available.

952
01:07:22,515 --> 01:07:27,619
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing, there's a Phantom Hourglass DS bundle that's appeared on internet retail sites.

953
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:36,686
[SPEAKER_10]: This is for the UK, so it's a nice silver color with, looks like some silk screens of Zelda...

954
01:07:37,865 --> 01:07:42,206
[SPEAKER_10]: from Phantom Hourglass and also the Zelda Phantom Hourglass logo.

955
01:07:42,786 --> 01:07:44,947
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kind of neat and that's probably coming soon.

956
01:07:45,607 --> 01:08:02,190
[SPEAKER_10]: And also if you are pre-ordering Super Mario Galaxy and you want a free pre-order coin, just make sure you pre-order your copies at Amazon, Circuit City, Fred Meyers, Fry's Electronics, Game Crazy GameStop, Kmart, and many others.

957
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:05,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much every single store out there, so

958
01:08:06,872 --> 01:08:08,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's awesome.

959
01:08:08,813 --> 01:08:30,744
[SPEAKER_10]: And finally, and I'm sure you're going to hear this about the time that this podcast is released, some wonderful information, which was going to be for our live listeners, but since they're not with us, I'll just save it for the Part B. There is, each year, the ESA does kind of a, I guess a...

960
01:08:32,495 --> 01:08:34,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Charity Drive with games.

961
01:08:34,976 --> 01:08:41,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Last year, Sony got together and put some games, a PlayStation 2 collection together with a couple games.

962
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:50,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, and this will be announced officially on Tuesday, and it's actually what's going to be is three games.

963
01:08:51,005 --> 01:08:53,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Robbie Bach of the ESA will announce the Holiday Bundle.

964
01:08:53,846 --> 01:08:58,949
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to feature three Xbox 360 games, including Cars, what was his...

965
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:03,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Car's Open Season and Fusion Frenzy 2, all for $29.99.

966
01:09:05,486 --> 01:09:11,593
[SPEAKER_10]: And the proceeds will go to basically helping the ESA.

967
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:14,501
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

968
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:47,347
[SPEAKER_10]: To deliver this program, the game publishers unite together to work through issues such as waiving royalties, packaging costs, etc.

969
01:09:47,407 --> 01:09:49,528
[SPEAKER_10]: in order to maximize charitable contribution.

970
01:09:49,568 --> 01:09:57,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Last year, Sony delivered a bundle for the ESA, and this year, Microsoft has agreed to create a three-game bundle to sell at retail with the proceeds going to the ESA charity.

971
01:10:00,877 --> 01:10:01,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

972
01:10:01,337 --> 01:10:03,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you'll probably see that in stores on the 23rd.

973
01:10:05,641 --> 01:10:05,941
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

974
01:10:06,516 --> 01:10:08,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess that's it for the show.

975
01:10:09,037 --> 01:10:10,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, our stream never came back up.

976
01:10:10,918 --> 01:10:14,279
[SPEAKER_08]: So if one of you that's still in chat, DarkSakura, I don't know, just let them know.

977
01:10:14,339 --> 01:10:15,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, we've wrapped the show.

978
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,940
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately, I'll just have to come back next week or download the show on Tuesday.

979
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:22,582
[SPEAKER_08]: But we thank them for sticking out, any of those folks that were still around, hoping we'd come back up.

980
01:10:23,002 --> 01:10:25,083
[SPEAKER_08]: But unfortunately, the computer is screwed up.

981
01:10:25,523 --> 01:10:27,644
[SPEAKER_08]: And now I have this dialog box on my screen that will not go away.

982
01:10:27,704 --> 01:10:29,564
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just, oh, my God.

983
01:10:31,805 --> 01:10:33,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody put a gun in this computer.

984
01:10:33,166 --> 01:10:33,526
[SPEAKER_08]: It's done.

985
01:10:33,866 --> 01:10:34,106
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

986
01:10:35,248 --> 01:10:40,330
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap up tonight's broken show.

987
01:10:54,906 --> 01:10:55,947
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about the other two games.

988
01:10:56,067 --> 01:10:56,327
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

989
01:10:56,367 --> 01:10:58,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

990
01:10:58,668 --> 01:11:02,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris, thank you very much for being here, even if now you think you're some type of bad luck charm.

991
01:11:03,011 --> 01:11:03,731
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't care.

992
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:04,892
[SPEAKER_08]: We still love having you here.

993
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:05,693
[SPEAKER_08]: And come back.

994
01:11:06,133 --> 01:11:06,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn it.

995
01:11:06,793 --> 01:11:07,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I am.

996
01:11:07,174 --> 01:11:07,794
[SPEAKER_08]: And I didn't tell you.

997
01:11:07,814 --> 01:11:08,895
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to Disneyland next week.

998
01:11:09,315 --> 01:11:10,015
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll be thinking of you.

999
01:11:10,135 --> 01:11:10,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Whore.

1000
01:11:10,656 --> 01:11:10,776
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1001
01:11:11,816 --> 01:11:13,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Get lots of pictures on the teacups.

1002
01:11:13,277 --> 01:11:13,558
[SPEAKER_08]: I will.

1003
01:11:14,058 --> 01:11:15,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Me and Extifer are going.

1004
01:11:15,399 --> 01:11:15,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw.

1005
01:11:15,719 --> 01:11:16,599
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be fun.

1006
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:18,240
[SPEAKER_08]: He hasn't been in a long, long time.

1007
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:21,202
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to make him go on that Ferris wheel that sways back and forth.

1008
01:11:21,242 --> 01:11:21,723
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going to cry.

1009
01:11:21,823 --> 01:11:22,183
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be fun.

1010
01:11:22,543 --> 01:11:23,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I won't go on that.

1011
01:11:24,004 --> 01:11:29,267
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, you're probably going to see a lot more of me until March because I'm going to be moving out there.

1012
01:11:30,048 --> 01:11:32,709
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully you'll be able to hear me on my podcast.

1013
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:38,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, which just goes to further prove everybody has a freaking podcast.

1014
01:11:39,013 --> 01:11:39,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1015
01:11:40,074 --> 01:11:40,654
[SPEAKER_08]: We were first.

1016
01:11:40,714 --> 01:11:41,254
[SPEAKER_08]: God damn it.

1017
01:11:42,115 --> 01:11:42,395
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1018
01:11:43,156 --> 01:11:44,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much for being here.

1019
01:11:44,136 --> 01:11:44,416
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

1020
01:11:44,436 --> 01:11:45,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Puppy, thanks for coming back.

1021
01:11:45,917 --> 01:11:50,440
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm glad you got to talk more this week, even if sort of, even though there was like

1022
01:11:51,608 --> 01:11:53,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Only two microphones, but what can you do?

1023
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,071
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like your shirt says, Booched.

1024
01:11:56,551 --> 01:11:57,532
[SPEAKER_08]: The show is Booched.

1025
01:11:58,092 --> 01:11:59,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that a Puzzle Pirates thing?

1026
01:11:59,032 --> 01:12:01,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is a Puzzle Pirates shirt.

1027
01:12:01,134 --> 01:12:02,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, what does Booched mean?

1028
01:12:03,095 --> 01:12:03,915
[SPEAKER_08]: You screwed up?

1029
01:12:04,035 --> 01:12:05,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's basically what it means.

1030
01:12:05,396 --> 01:12:07,557
[SPEAKER_09]: This is like the worst rating you get on a puzzle.

1031
01:12:08,518 --> 01:12:10,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

1032
01:12:10,619 --> 01:12:13,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that was a very appropriate shirt to wear to the show.

1033
01:12:14,001 --> 01:12:14,521
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to see.

1034
01:12:14,841 --> 01:12:18,604
[SPEAKER_10]: There was another article I was reading on Destructoid that they had...

1035
01:12:19,474 --> 01:12:26,320
[SPEAKER_10]: is this game called Animal Kaiser and it's basically where you can pit different animals against each other in like deathmatch in the arcade.

1036
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:30,483
[SPEAKER_10]: So they have snake versus black panther and Indian cobra.

1037
01:12:31,584 --> 01:12:34,866
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's awesome because you can just pick all sorts of different animals to fight each other.

1038
01:12:35,387 --> 01:12:38,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear to God, just pick a black mom, we'll yield one every time.

1039
01:12:38,589 --> 01:12:43,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear to God, there's like an entire video game craze that is just dead set on pissing PETA off.

1040
01:12:44,614 --> 01:12:46,356
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as I'm concerned, have at them.

1041
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:48,057
[SPEAKER_04]: PETA can kiss my ass.

1042
01:12:48,942 --> 01:12:51,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, PETA came back with Super Chick Sisters or whatever that was.

1043
01:12:51,684 --> 01:12:53,725
[SPEAKER_08]: It was actually kind of cute, I gotta say.

1044
01:12:54,646 --> 01:13:01,630
[SPEAKER_08]: But that was, again, I'm visiting... Oh, now what?

1045
01:13:02,471 --> 01:13:05,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, this will double as your final thought.

1046
01:13:06,293 --> 01:13:09,415
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a shark versus a lion.

1047
01:13:09,735 --> 01:13:11,997
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the coolest shit I have ever seen.

1048
01:13:12,017 --> 01:13:14,979
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta see this here.

1049
01:13:15,362 --> 01:13:18,204
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got to have this in the United States.

1050
01:13:18,364 --> 01:13:22,087
[SPEAKER_10]: I know this is one of those quirky... Okay.

1051
01:13:22,107 --> 01:13:22,747
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to see.

1052
01:13:22,767 --> 01:13:24,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1053
01:13:24,308 --> 01:13:25,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I gotta... Brother.

1054
01:13:35,694 --> 01:13:39,997
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a shark and a freaking lion.

1055
01:13:40,277 --> 01:13:43,879
[SPEAKER_04]: The shark is out of water and is kicking the lion's ass.

1056
01:13:44,199 --> 01:13:45,160
[SPEAKER_04]: How is that possible?

1057
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:47,221
[SPEAKER_04]: The fucking shark won!

1058
01:13:47,841 --> 01:13:49,002
[SPEAKER_08]: If this is why Smash Bros.

1059
01:13:49,022 --> 01:13:50,203
[SPEAKER_08]: got delayed, then I'm okay with it.

1060
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:54,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, the new third-party character is being announced.

1061
01:13:55,046 --> 01:13:58,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Shark and lion.

1062
01:13:59,148 --> 01:14:00,689
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

1063
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:03,711
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, everyone's still PMing me.

1064
01:14:05,342 --> 01:14:07,064
[SPEAKER_06]: on chat.

1065
01:14:08,927 --> 01:14:12,171
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is bitches.

1066
01:14:13,633 --> 01:14:13,913
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1067
01:14:13,953 --> 01:14:14,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Referring to work.

1068
01:14:15,495 --> 01:14:19,840
[SPEAKER_08]: And my final thought is sorry the show is broken tonight and you get what you pay for.

1069
01:14:19,901 --> 01:14:20,762
[SPEAKER_08]: But thank you anyway.

[SPEAKER_08]: What do you mean I'm doing it wrong?

1073
01:14:28,002 --> 01:14:29,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we just stop the show now?

1074
01:14:29,842 --> 01:14:30,142
