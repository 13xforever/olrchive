0	3000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	12000	We're your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Moloto.
13000	19000	Tonight, October 28th, 2007, a 360 fall update feature may have been leaked.
19000	25000	Smash Brothers lets you share instant replays, and could MySpace be the next great gaming outlet?
25000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	40000	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
40000	45000	My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me, as always, say hello to Dark Sakura.
45000	46000	Yo.
46000	47000	How you doing, Dark Sakura?
47000	48000	Been better.
48000	52000	Well, sorry to hear. But, you know, we have good days and not so good days.
52000	53000	Yep.
53000	56000	Not so good day as well. I'll tell you about that in a moment.
56000	58000	I have a beer now, and that makes everything better.
58000	60000	I have Fiji water, and that makes things okay.
60000	65000	Let me, ah, except now I dropped the cap. Now everything sucks again. I hate my life.
65000	67000	Don't cry, emo Rob.
67000	69000	Say hello to tech master, Loki.
69000	70000	Hello.
70000	71000	How you doing, Loki?
71000	72000	I'm fine.
72000	74000	Doing better than myself and Dark Sakura?
74000	75000	Probably.
75000	80000	Well, here's what happened, is that I kind of stage dived last night, but not on purpose.
80000	81000	Those of you guys have been listening...
81000	82000	I forgot that stuff for you.
82000	84000	Oh, that's all right. I'll live.
84000	90000	Those of you guys who have been listening to this show for a long time know that I'm involved with theatrical production of the Rocky Horror Picture Show,
90000	96000	which is, like, so different from what we do here on Orange Launch Radio, but, you know, hey, we all have a variety of different likes and stuff, right?
96000	105000	So last night was the big Halloween show, and I was performing the criminologist role, which is what I usually do for them now when I'm not emceeing the show.
105000	111000	And right at the end, I was dressed up in my Halloween garb, and my costume this year is Jack Skellington.
111000	116000	I'll have to go get my mask for the operator 11 people later so they can see, because it's actually a pretty rad costume.
116000	119000	But I was dressed up as Jack Skellington, but the problem was I had that mask on.
119000	124000	So as I was starting to exit the stage, I was walking down the steps, which have no handrail, mind you.
124000	126000	It's about six steps to get from the top to the bottom.
126000	129000	And the emcee for the night was running up the steps the other way.
129000	131000	Well, so I started to walk down. I put my right foot on the first step.
131000	135000	I put my left foot down where there was no step.
135000	138000	So I tumbled and fell, and it was really bad.
138000	141000	Luckily, I didn't break a bone, so it could have been worse.
141000	150000	But basically, I landed in this pretzel shape, and I basically kicked my shoe dug in to the upper part of my thigh.
150000	154000	And I would show you on the webcam, except that might be indecent, because it's right next to my booty.
154000	158000	So no webcam scars on that one.
158000	160000	But I also skinned my knee, too.
160000	165000	This does not deserve happy music. Why is happy music playing?
165000	167000	It's trying to cheer you up.
167000	169000	It's saying, don't cry, Rob.
169000	171000	Bad news over happy music.
171000	174000	It's saying, Rob, next time remember to hit the stop button when the intro's done.
174000	179000	Anyway, so that's why I'm a little bit in a foul mood tonight, because I'm in pain.
179000	182000	Ooh, do you have drugs for me?
182000	184000	I do. I'm going to give you three of them.
184000	185000	Awesomeness. Awesome.
185000	187000	Well, let's talk about...
187000	189000	You want some Vicodin, too? I have some of that.
189000	191000	No, I don't want Vicodin. Vicodin won't make me very sleepy.
191000	193000	All right. Anyway.
193000	195000	I can't have any because I have a beer.
195000	198000	I might really be documenting that you're giving me...
198000	201000	I'm giving you Ibuprofen. You could just pay for Advil.
201000	203000	Yes, Ibuprofen is exactly the same thing.
203000	204000	All right, anyhow.
204000	207000	Let's go to Dark Sakura with How Was Your Gaming Week?
207000	210000	Nobody cares about my ass anymore, so let's talk about our gaming weeks.
210000	211000	Dark Sakura.
211000	216000	I played horrendous amounts of Ragnarok online,
216000	219000	and I played a little guitar here of three today,
219000	222000	and my dumb butt husband...
222000	225000	I love my husband to death, but, man, I'm mad at him.
225000	229000	He was supposed to bring me Super Mario Galaxy on Thursday.
229000	231000	He didn't.
231000	234000	I cried because the game's not out for a little while,
234000	239000	and usually when the demos from Nintendo come, they're full versions.
239000	241000	I was going to say that's what I heard is that the demo
241000	245000	at GameStop and GameCrazy right now is the full version.
245000	248000	Yeah, and he was supposed to bring it home so that I could play it for great justice.
248000	250000	It's only a couple weeks away.
250000	253000	I don't care. Want.
253000	254000	Do want.
254000	256000	I'm impatient.
256000	258000	It's my right as a woman.
258000	263000	I'm thinking of modding my Wii to have a mod chip on it.
263000	267000	You know, for just modding stuff, not for piracy or anything.
267000	270000	You should put a spoiler on it and lower it.
270000	272000	It can't get much lower.
272000	278000	I mean, it's like the width of three DVDs, cases at least, but I don't know.
278000	280000	Eh, whatever.
280000	282000	All right.
282000	284000	So, no Super Mario Galaxy for Dark Soccer this week.
284000	285000	Sorry to hear it.
285000	286000	Sad face.
286000	287000	How about Ragnarok?
287000	289000	You still been active on the Ragnarok rack?
289000	291000	Oh, yeah, and I have a new obsession in that game.
291000	292000	What's that, Pray Tell?
292000	294000	That's buying old blue boxes.
294000	296000	Because you get something random every time,
296000	298000	and sometimes you get something really great,
298000	302000	and sometimes you get crap like a feather,
302000	304000	and then sometimes you get something really cool
304000	307000	like I got a funeral hat that looks like a brown bag.
307000	309000	I still love the SARS mask the best.
309000	310000	That was always my favorite.
310000	312000	They have a new SARS mask that's black.
312000	313000	Cool.
313000	314000	So I have one on my assassin now.
314000	315000	Nice.
315000	317000	And for anyone who doesn't know,
317000	321000	I'm playing on the Deliverance Ragnarok online server,
321000	324000	so don't find me.
324000	326000	I'll be making a guild for Orange Challenge later
326000	327000	if anyone wants to play with me.
327000	329000	Don't ask for heal, please.
329000	331000	Hey, I don't play support classes, okay?
331000	334000	The closest I come to support is I'm playing a dancer.
334000	335000	Nice.
335000	338000	Just so she can walk around like a hoochie with a whip.
338000	339000	For fun.
339000	340000	For fun.
340000	341000	I've got a gunslinger, though.
341000	342000	He's pretty cool.
342000	343000	He's wearing a pimp hat.
343000	344000	All right.
344000	345000	But, yeah, that's about it.
345000	346000	All right.
346000	347000	Well, Loki, how was your gaming week?
347000	349000	My gaming week was okay.
349000	351000	I didn't play as much as I thought I would be,
351000	355000	but I bought a copy of...
355000	358000	Basically, I was too lazy to cancel my pre-order
358000	361000	for Ratchet & Clank Future Tools of Destruction,
361000	364000	so now I have a copy of it.
364000	367000	And I haven't played it yet,
367000	369000	because I took the shrink wrap off of it and I'm like,
369000	372000	ooh, case, and put it down on the coffee table
372000	375000	and on my way doing other things.
375000	378000	I watched Nellie play Excite Truck because she's like,
378000	380000	hey, I want to play Excite Truck again,
380000	383000	so she's back into that again.
383000	385000	It's nice to see someone showing the Wii a little love
385000	386000	once in a while.
386000	388000	Dude, Excite Truck is awesome,
388000	392000	and it seriously is the best Wii game, I think.
392000	393000	And I don't give a shit about Zelda.
393000	395000	I don't give a shit about Metroid.
395000	397000	Excite Truck is where it's at.
397000	399000	If not the best game on the console,
399000	402000	it's definitely the best racing game, so whatever.
402000	407000	Anyways, I did play some Halo 3 multiplayer last night.
407000	408000	That was kind of fun.
408000	409000	We went to a Halloween party,
409000	412000	and so we did split screen and live multiplayer,
412000	415000	and that was fun.
415000	418000	And then I played some Orange Box,
418000	420000	played more Portal.
420000	424000	I'm playing more Conan, and that's an okay game.
424000	426000	It'll be fun to play through it,
426000	430000	but then after that, eh,
430000	432000	I won't be playing any more after that.
432000	435000	And then on the PSP,
435000	437000	I've been playing more of the Jackass game
437000	439000	so I can finish it and delete it.
439000	441000	I mean, sell it back.
441000	446000	And then what else?
446000	448000	Oh, Guitar Hero 3.
448000	449000	I tried a little bit of that.
449000	452000	It is Guitar Hero.
452000	454000	Fuck, there's not really much I can say about it.
454000	455000	It's not innovative or anything.
455000	458000	It's just I broke my guitar
458000	462000	because a lot of people might not remember
462000	465000	our Op 11 show that we did last week.
465000	469000	We showed that my guitar had the orange and blue buttons
469000	471000	out of order on there for some reason,
471000	475000	which is weird, so I tried to fix it.
475000	476000	I fixed it fine.
476000	478000	I took it apart just fine.
478000	480000	Unfortunately, it's designed slightly different
480000	484000	than, say, the retail Guitar Hero 3 guitars
484000	485000	because in the retail ones,
485000	490000	you're able to take off the entire top of the guitar
490000	492000	so you can change faceplates and whatnot.
492000	496000	Well, the wired version of it, or the demo kit,
496000	497000	has a screw in there
497000	499000	because they don't want you taking it off.
499000	500000	So I pulled the screw out,
500000	502000	and then I pulled it out,
502000	503000	and it really was stuck in there.
503000	505000	So I finally got it undone,
505000	506000	switched out the buttons,
506000	507000	put it back in there,
507000	508000	and forgot to put the faceplate on there,
508000	510000	so I had to pull it back out again.
510000	513000	Well, my second time pulling it out,
513000	516000	unfortunately, I ripped the ribbon cable in half,
516000	518000	so it's broken.
518000	519000	Nice, good job.
519000	523000	And I threw it away.
523000	524000	We're going to read some comments real quick
524000	525000	to our Gaming Weeks
525000	527000	and use this opportunity to introduce the chat room.
527000	529000	We always tape live on Sunday night,
529000	530000	and that allows us to interact with our listeners.
530000	532000	Chat.orangelandtrader.com
532000	535000	is the place to be Sunday at 6 p.m. Pacific when we tape.
535000	539000	Let's see, so we have JAP28 wants to know,
539000	541000	why not just paint them, Loki,
541000	542000	in regards to the switch buttons?
542000	544000	Because it wasn't that hard to take them apart
544000	545000	to switch out the buttons.
545000	548000	It's just that it's not designed to be taken apart,
548000	550000	because obviously they don't want
550000	552000	the top half of the guitar being stolen
552000	554000	by some dumbass playing the game,
554000	556000	so they put a ribbon cable through there
556000	559000	instead of an actual adapter to connect it to.
559000	561000	So it's just because it was stuck,
561000	562000	and it wasn't coming out,
562000	564000	so I had to pull harder on it,
564000	566000	and unfortunately it just all of a sudden let loose
566000	568000	and ripped the ribbon cable in half.
568000	572000	Had I remembered to put the faceplate on it
572000	574000	when I was putting it back together the first time,
574000	575000	we wouldn't have this issue.
575000	576000	It would be fine.
576000	578000	It's just, you know, who cares?
578000	580000	It's just, I've got another guitar already.
580000	582000	I don't play multiplayer at my house,
582000	584000	and when I do, it's only going to be in rock band anyways,
584000	586000	so whatever.
586000	588000	And yes, I do like to tinker with stuff,
588000	590000	as Blaze says in the chat room.
590000	593000	Gerardimo comments in our chat room,
593000	595000	well, Loki, Excite Truck is up against
595000	596000	the other launch racing game,
596000	598000	and that's really it.
598000	600000	There is more than just the one launch game.
600000	602000	I mean, there was Need for Speed Carbon,
602000	604000	there was a crappy GT racing game,
604000	607000	Monster 4x4 World Circuit.
607000	609000	And were any of those games particularly memorable?
609000	612000	No, I played all of them, and they sucked.
612000	616000	Especially the Monster 4x4 World Circuit and GT.
616000	617000	Excite Truck is awesome.
617000	619000	The problem is the company that's making it
619000	620000	doesn't really make anything else.
620000	622000	All they do is make racing games,
622000	626000	and before that it was some NASCAR Heat game
626000	627000	or something like that,
627000	629000	but get on it!
629000	631000	Make Excite Truck 2, come on!
631000	632000	I mean, seriously, just more of the same.
632000	634000	You don't need to fucking innovate it.
634000	635000	It was fine the way it was.
635000	637000	It just needed to be longer, have more tracks,
637000	639000	maybe some downloadable stuff once Nintendo figures out
639000	641000	this whole download service or whatever.
641000	643000	That would be kind of cool.
643000	645000	But until then, I'm trying to play
645000	647000	every other racing game on the platform
647000	651000	to see if there's something sort of similar to Excite Truck.
651000	653000	Then, of course, Mario Kart is going to be awesome,
653000	654000	but that's a different type of game.
654000	658000	I mean, Nelly's not going to like that game.
658000	661000	Going back to Dark Soccer's Gaming Week in chat,
661000	662000	Shadowslier says,
662000	664000	First thing I install after I get Windows?
664000	667000	Freaking Ragnarok, and it's all thanks to OLR.
667000	669000	It's because it's crack.
669000	670000	Ragnarok.
670000	671000	Yep.
671000	672000	All right.
672000	675000	Let's see, My Gaming Week, if you're all finished, Loki?
675000	677000	I think I'm done.
677000	678000	My Gaming Week, I started off the week
678000	680000	playing beautiful Katamari,
680000	683000	and I got to say, I'm a real big fan of the Katamari series.
683000	685000	I love the two games on PlayStation 2.
685000	687000	I don't like this one on Xbox 360,
687000	690000	because honestly, I feel like they phoned it in.
690000	694000	I feel like it's kind of the last PlayStation 2 game
694000	697000	with widescreen, some small enhancements.
697000	699000	I mean, I feel like a lot of the things you see
699000	701000	in a lot of the levels are very similar
701000	703000	to the stuff you see in PlayStation 2.
703000	705000	There's this one level with a playground
705000	706000	that seems really familiar,
706000	709000	and the racetrack doesn't seem that upgraded.
709000	711000	But here's what bugs me most of all,
711000	714000	and what makes me really feel like they phoned this one in.
714000	716000	The cinematics are completely disappeared,
716000	718000	which is part of what made the last game so great,
718000	720000	is you got those little cinematics in between every stage.
720000	722000	It was so weird.
722000	724000	Also, the King of Cosmos,
724000	726000	all the charm that he had in the last two games,
726000	729000	I really feel like is lost in this game.
729000	732000	I don't know if that's because of some type of up-ramping
732000	734000	in the difficulty curve,
734000	738000	but I noticed that this time in a lot of the stages,
738000	740000	the big trick is that the King wants you to grab
740000	741000	all of a certain item.
741000	743000	For instance, there's one level where he wants you
743000	745000	to grab Japanese things.
745000	748000	So you have to roll up as much sushi and fireworks
748000	750000	and flags as you can that are Japanese.
750000	752000	Or there's one level where you're supposed to roll up
752000	754000	nothing but hot things, which is kind of a cool level.
754000	756000	There wasn't anything like that in the last game.
756000	758000	Well, not a cool level, but a hot level.
758000	760000	There was something like that in the last game.
760000	762000	Yeah, there was the big fireball, huh?
762000	763000	The campfire.
763000	764000	That's right.
764000	765000	So see, a lot of it kind of seems like
765000	767000	you've sort of seen it before.
767000	768000	But here's the thing.
768000	770000	I will collect all of that item,
770000	771000	and then the King is like,
771000	773000	well, your katamari sucks.
773000	775000	Even though I got it the size he wanted,
775000	777000	everything's like, wow, your katamari sucks,
777000	779000	and it needs more of this item.
779000	780000	And you're kind of like,
780000	782000	dude, was this game bug-tested?
782000	783000	It needs more cowbell.
783000	785000	Do I really just suck this bad at katamari?
785000	787000	You just need to say when he asks you to do stuff,
787000	788000	you're like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
788000	789000	Roll over stuff.
789000	790000	That's all I do, you know?
790000	791000	Except for the fire thing,
791000	792000	because you have to be real careful with that.
792000	793000	Otherwise, you'll keep killing him.
793000	794000	Yeah, I pretty much just roll.
794000	795000	Yeah, that's how I beat the stages now,
795000	797000	like I was trying to be careful in the beginning,
797000	799000	but I do feel like the difficulty curve
799000	800000	went up a little bit in this game.
800000	802000	Because if you think about it,
802000	805000	each level that's themed after something like Japanese or whatever,
805000	807000	they're going to have tons of that item everywhere.
807000	810000	So all you have to do is just roll over everything,
810000	812000	and the majority of it will be that item,
812000	813000	and your katamari will be big.
813000	815000	So I'm sorry, katamari fans,
815000	817000	but this one's the worst game in the series so far.
817000	819000	Honestly, the only reason I would suggest...
819000	820000	Yeah, I would play the PSP version.
820000	822000	Well, yeah.
822000	824000	The only way I would suggest picking this game up
824000	826000	is if you don't have a PlayStation 2,
826000	828000	which I can't imagine there's that many people.
828000	829000	I mean, I know there's somebody.
829000	830000	We're going to get an email from somebody.
830000	832000	But I can't imagine there's that many people
832000	834000	that only own a 360 that don't own a PlayStation 2.
834000	837000	And honestly, just go back and play the first and second games again
837000	839000	because they're superior.
839000	840000	I'm sorry.
840000	842000	Yeah, I know there's Xbox Live modes,
842000	843000	but they're kind of shiny.
843000	844000	Lame.
844000	845000	Yeah.
845000	847000	And then there's this whole downloadable content,
847000	849000	which takes me on another rant for a moment.
849000	853000	And this is a call to all the other bloggers
853000	857000	and podcasters and media types that might listen to this program.
857000	861000	You know how the downloadable content on this game
861000	864000	has been discovered to simply be another unlock key
864000	866000	for items that are already on the disk.
866000	868000	And it's not like we haven't seen this before.
868000	870000	I mean, Dance Dance Revolution Universe comes to mind.
870000	871000	We had that.
871000	873000	Can you think of any others, Loki, that you downloaded keys?
873000	876000	Need for Speed, like practically every EA game
876000	878000	with the unlockable cheats and stuff.
878000	881000	We need to no longer call this downloadable content
881000	882000	because it's not.
882000	884000	It's not downloadable content.
884000	886000	The content is not what you're downloading.
886000	887000	What are you downloading?
887000	889000	You're downloading an unlock code.
889000	890000	So we need to start referring to this stuff
890000	893000	when we see it as pay to unlock content
893000	894000	because that's what it is.
894000	895000	It's pay to unlock content.
895000	899000	You know, in Ridge Racer, they had where you can unlock cars
899000	902000	and they call them keys, car key.
902000	905000	You know, this is a download key, whatever.
905000	906000	That makes sense to me to call it that.
906000	908000	So from here on out on this show
908000	909000	when we discover things like this,
909000	911000	we're no longer going to refer to it as downloadable content
911000	913000	when we talk about it, review it on the show,
913000	915000	it will now be referred to as pay to unlock content
915000	916000	because that's what it is.
916000	919000	Now, downloadable content, actual downloadable content
919000	922000	in my mind would be something like Elder Scrolls Oblivion.
922000	927000	The characters in Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
927000	929000	And you weren't just downloading a key for that?
929000	930000	Actually, I didn't play the game enough.
930000	932000	I think that you were actually downloading the full characters.
932000	933000	See, that's the hard thing.
933000	935000	They had to release a new version that already had them in it.
935000	936000	That's true, that's true.
936000	938000	That's going to be the hard thing about this
938000	940000	is that game companies are not up front
940000	942000	with this information usually.
942000	944000	So that's why, you know, we're just...
944000	945000	Well, they prefer it to be seamless to the customer.
945000	948000	We're just this tiny little show in somebody's, you know,
948000	950000	spare bedroom, independently run.
950000	952000	But I'm putting a call out there to all the bigger folks
952000	954000	who might happen to listen to this program.
954000	957000	I think we need to start asking developers
957000	958000	when they announce this content.
958000	961000	Is this downloadable content or is this pay to unlock content?
961000	965000	I'm not saying pay to unlock content is necessarily a bad thing,
965000	967000	but let's call it what it is.
967000	972000	Let's not, you know, if you're going to do it this way,
972000	974000	I think the consumers have a right to know what it is that they're buying.
974000	975000	And you know what?
975000	978000	I still bought the pay to unlock content in the realm of DDR.
978000	980000	I bought, you know, the song pack.
980000	982000	It's not going to stop me from buying it.
982000	984000	I'm not saying we have to boycott all pay to unlock content,
984000	987000	but I think we should be fair and call it what it is, pay to unlock content.
987000	989000	So there you have it.
989000	995000	And that even gets to the whole thing of why the fuck is it locked in anyways,
995000	999000	and why do I have to pay to unlock part of the game that I've already bought.
999000	1001000	That's stupid.
1001000	1002000	Let's see.
1002000	1005000	NM64 says one advantage to pay to unlock content
1005000	1008000	is that it doesn't fill your HDD, your hard drive.
1008000	1012000	Okay, fair, fair, but still it is pay to unlock content.
1012000	1017000	And you know, it's something that you've bought that now you're having to unlock.
1017000	1020000	You know, it's just, you know, it's a little bit janky.
1020000	1024000	I can understand like if you're saying, you know, in those EA games
1024000	1027000	or whatever where you want to cheat and like say, okay,
1027000	1030000	I want to unlock the cheat codes or something like that,
1030000	1032000	and I don't want to play through the game, I'm just going to buy them.
1032000	1035000	Okay, well that's fine if you want to do that because that's your choice.
1035000	1038000	But it's stuff that's in the game which I think caught on my eye
1038000	1042000	was too short anyways, and the fact that there was more levels in there,
1042000	1044000	that's kind of annoying.
1044000	1047000	I think that's why this one particularly stings
1047000	1050000	and why we need to put our foot down with this one
1050000	1053000	because I think a lot of people feel even for considering
1053000	1057000	it was a $40 game and not a $60 game, it was still a little too short.
1057000	1061000	And to have those unlock codes come out not even a week after the game is out
1061000	1064000	is a little bit of a punch to the gut, right?
1064000	1068000	Yeah, it's just like all the DDR unlocked songs, that's stupid too.
1068000	1070000	But I understand why they do that because of the licensing stuff,
1070000	1073000	yet at the same time I also think that they could probably, you know,
1073000	1077000	bundle in the licensing cost into the game
1077000	1081000	because I don't think that five extra songs are really going to cost
1081000	1084000	five extra dollars or something like that.
1084000	1089000	OL Army Blaze asks, is the $5 horse armor downloadable or unlock content?
1089000	1092000	It's downloadable, I mean granted it's shitty downloadable content,
1092000	1095000	but it is downloadable content.
1095000	1098000	I'm not saying that downloadable content,
1098000	1100000	there's a perfect example of where download content
1100000	1103000	may not actually be better than pay to unlock content.
1103000	1105000	But I'm just saying, let the consumer know what it really is
1105000	1106000	they're spending their money on.
1106000	1108000	Here's the other thing that people also forget,
1108000	1112000	and it's pretty easy to forget it, but if you go to retail kiosks,
1112000	1115000	a lot of this downloadable content that costs you money,
1115000	1117000	like themes and stuff, is actually available for free
1117000	1120000	if you bring your memory unit and you can download it straight off there.
1120000	1122000	I remember when Saints Row came out,
1122000	1125000	they had some downloadable clothes or something that you could get for it,
1125000	1126000	and it was all free on there.
1126000	1131000	It costs you money on live, but it was free from the retail kiosks.
1131000	1134000	So that's another option too, get one of those memory units
1134000	1135000	and check it every now and then.
1135000	1138000	That's what they're trying to do, but they don't advertise that shit,
1138000	1139000	which is annoying.
1139000	1144000	So from here on out, we'll start on this show calling it what it is,
1144000	1147000	and I beg of the O.L. Army and the listeners of this program,
1147000	1148000	spread the word.
1148000	1150000	Let's get it out there, let's put our foot down as gamers,
1150000	1154000	and demand the developers call their releases what they are.
1154000	1157000	And that whole microtransactions thing, we'll save that for another day,
1157000	1160000	because then you're getting into a whole other ballgame.
1160000	1163000	Anyhow, that's really pretty much it for my Gaming Week.
1163000	1165000	Well, I did play some of the Xbox Live.
1165000	1166000	I guess I should say real quickly,
1166000	1168000	I did play some of the Xbox Live arcade games.
1168000	1172000	I played Battlestar Galactica.
1172000	1176000	Man, I love Battlestar Galactica, the show,
1176000	1178000	but the game...
1178000	1180000	Yeah, it was over in about ten minutes.
1180000	1182000	I just couldn't get into it.
1182000	1183000	It was not good.
1183000	1186000	Exit, a little bit disappointing to me.
1186000	1189000	It was much slower paced than I thought it would be.
1189000	1191000	It was kind of a slow paced game, but I don't know.
1191000	1194000	To be honest, don't take that as my final word on the game yet,
1194000	1197000	because I didn't play it enough, so more to come on that later.
1197000	1200000	And I've still been playing every extend extra extreme,
1200000	1202000	kind of exploring all the modes and that.
1202000	1205000	And then lastly, I would say I just got Guitar Hero 3 today,
1205000	1206000	and cracked that open.
1206000	1208000	Haven't gotten to play it enough to give my full review,
1208000	1211000	but I will say this, I do love the way that the game
1211000	1215000	ties into the internet with the GuitarHero.com site,
1215000	1219000	and how you can link your Xbox 360, or from what I understand,
1219000	1223000	PlayStation 2 or 3, whatever versions to the website,
1223000	1226000	and you can have an online band and all this stuff,
1226000	1228000	and these online on the web leaderboards.
1228000	1230000	I really like that kind of functionality.
1230000	1233000	Is that that whole web 2.0 thing to an extent
1233000	1235000	that Sony was talking about before?
1235000	1236000	I like that kind of stuff.
1236000	1239000	Halo 3 does this extremely well, and it's part of the charm,
1239000	1241000	like with the pictures and everything.
1241000	1243000	So it's kind of cool seeing games and other genres
1243000	1244000	getting into this.
1244000	1246000	Now granted, the link code wouldn't work for me earlier today,
1246000	1248000	because I think everyone's hitting it.
1248000	1250000	But rest assured, sometime this week,
1250000	1252000	there will be an OL Army band that you all can join.
1252000	1254000	So keep an eye on our forums for that.
1254000	1259000	Rob, what did you think of the changes in interface during gameplay?
1259000	1261000	You know, it's not bad.
1261000	1265000	I was a little hesitant to hearing that harmonics
1265000	1268000	was not going to be behind it and it was going to be never soft,
1268000	1270000	but considering they built the whole thing from the ground up,
1270000	1271000	it's not bad.
1271000	1274000	I'm hearing things about some frame rate issues that people are having.
1274000	1277000	I haven't noticed it yet, but then again, keep in mind,
1277000	1279000	I've only really played like five songs so far.
1279000	1283000	I really like how it looks a lot better now.
1283000	1288000	The cool thing about them having built the thing from scratch
1288000	1291000	is that they didn't just up res something they had before,
1291000	1292000	as in the case of Guitar Hero 3.
1292000	1293000	It's really clean.
1293000	1294000	It's from the ground up.
1294000	1297000	And I love the cartoon stuff in between levels.
1297000	1298000	Yeah, that was great.
1298000	1299000	That's rad.
1299000	1301000	Dan was saying today, he's like, I love the bassist.
1301000	1304000	Yeah, honestly, this is kind of like the step up
1304000	1307000	that I think Guitar Hero 2 should have been in a way.
1307000	1308000	Not that I'm saying Guitar Hero 2 is bad,
1308000	1310000	but it's just kind of like there wasn't much there.
1310000	1312000	It was kind of a rehash of the first game of New Haunt Songs.
1312000	1315000	I think this is generally a step in the right direction,
1315000	1317000	but again, I need to spend a little more time with the game.
1317000	1321000	I haven't played it online at all, but I'm liking what I see so far.
1321000	1323000	So if chat room, you guys have some comments,
1323000	1328000	chat.orangelaunchradio.com and we'll be reading those.
1328000	1329000	I'm just trying to see what's going on.
1329000	1332000	A lot of folks were still commenting on the unlock,
1332000	1335000	pay to unlock stuff.
1335000	1338000	Kevin DDR says, pay to unlock is only fine, in my opinion,
1338000	1341000	when you have low or no price for the game.
1341000	1343000	Kind of like Xbox Live Arcade maybe,
1343000	1347000	but usually they don't really do much pay to unlock with Xbox Live Arcade.
1347000	1349000	Or free to unlock.
1349000	1353000	And the only thing you're paying is for the price of Xbox Live gold or silver.
1353000	1354000	Well, silver is free.
1354000	1357000	But I'm talking about the Dead Rising costumes were free, right?
1357000	1359000	But you had to be connected to live to download them.
1359000	1361000	I don't think many people have a problem with that
1361000	1363000	and that just kind of is an enhancement for those folks
1363000	1364000	that happen to be on the internet.
1364000	1365000	Rob.
1365000	1366000	Yes.
1366000	1367000	You know what's bullshit about Guitar Hero 3?
1367000	1368000	What?
1368000	1370000	They took out Pandora.
1370000	1371000	Did they? I didn't even notice.
1371000	1373000	They put in that stupid Midori.
1373000	1374000	I like Midori.
1374000	1375000	I hate her.
1375000	1376000	She's so stupid.
1376000	1377000	I unlocked her green hair.
1377000	1381000	I so miss Pandora because she was like the total goth rocker.
1381000	1382000	Pandora was pretty cool.
1382000	1383000	Maybe she's unlocked later.
1383000	1385000	No, she's not an unlockable.
1385000	1387000	She's completely not in it.
1387000	1388000	All right.
1388000	1390000	But we do have Slash now.
1390000	1391000	All right.
1391000	1394000	Let's get to some housekeeping tonight
1394000	1396000	and then we'll get into the gaming news.
1396000	1398000	Not a lot to say for housekeeping tonight.
1398000	1400000	I do want to encourage if you didn't check it out,
1400000	1403000	I mean now the game's kind of out there so it might not be as exciting.
1403000	1406000	But on Operator 11 we did do a Guitar Hero 3 retail unboxing
1406000	1407000	after the show last week
1407000	1409000	and we hope to bring you more stuff like that later.
1409000	1411000	The chat room was asking if maybe we'd play some Guitar Hero 3
1411000	1412000	after the show tonight.
1412000	1415000	I don't know because I'm kind of,
1415000	1417000	because of my injury and everything
1417000	1419000	and I don't know if we'll get to that tonight.
1419000	1422000	Just imagine Guitar Hero 2 with different songs.
1422000	1425000	I'm hoping that as the weeks go by,
1425000	1426000	we can do more of that,
1426000	1429000	especially if we're able to get our hands on things early and stuff.
1429000	1430000	We might be able to do some of that.
1430000	1432000	So we'll see as long as we're not violating NDAs
1432000	1433000	or any of that fun stuff.
1433000	1434000	But sometimes they'll send demos
1434000	1436000	and they don't care if people take screenshots or whatever.
1436000	1438000	So why not stream it live on the web?
1438000	1439000	We'll see what happens.
1439000	1440000	More to come on that.
1440000	1441000	In the meantime,
1441000	1444000	check out our Myspace at Orange Lounge Radio on Myspace,
1444000	1445000	our live journal community at Orange Lounge,
1445000	1449000	and soon, our band on Guitar Hero,
1449000	1451000	which I'm hoping to create as soon as it will link up.
1451000	1453000	So keep an eye on the forums for more information.
1453000	1454000	Let's get to the news.
1454000	1459000	Anyways, so the first thing also kind of ties in with Guitar Hero 3 here.
1459000	1462000	They've been doing some tests.
1462000	1466000	IGN actually did a little kind of testing of the Guitar Hero 3 guitars
1466000	1467000	and the Rock Band guitars
1467000	1470000	and the Guitar Hero 2 guitars, the Explorer,
1470000	1473000	to see whether they played nice with each other's games.
1473000	1479000	And it looks like that the Guitar Hero 3 guitar doesn't quite work with Rock Band
1479000	1484000	and the same goes with the Rock Band guitar on Guitar Hero 3.
1484000	1490000	But the Guitar Hero 2 Explorer model, at least on the 360,
1490000	1491000	does work with both,
1491000	1493000	so that's where you need to go.
1493000	1494000	Buy that one instead.
1494000	1501000	Now, of course, some speculation is, you know, why is it not working?
1501000	1506000	Well, it might be that Activision, in fact it does say on the box,
1506000	1509000	only official guitars will work with Guitar Hero 3.
1509000	1511000	And they've been known to do this in the past,
1511000	1515000	but they locked out guitars with Guitar Hero 2 on the PlayStation 2.
1515000	1520000	And I remember some of the stuff from the third-party guitars from Guitar Hero 1
1520000	1521000	weren't working with it.
1521000	1523000	And I'm not surprised that they're doing something like this
1523000	1525000	because they want to sell their guitars
1525000	1528000	and not allow third-party companies to make guitars.
1528000	1532000	But Rock Band, though, Harmonics has actually come out and said
1532000	1534000	they welcome any third-party software
1534000	1539000	or they support any third-party guitars or accessories.
1539000	1542000	You can't help but feel like, though,
1542000	1545000	that there's a little bit of, like, jabs going on here with this.
1545000	1546000	Oh, yeah.
1546000	1549000	I mean, I don't know if it's just an unfortunate coincidence for these guys,
1549000	1551000	but it does feel a little bit like you wonder if they're taking jabs at each other,
1551000	1553000	which is shit for the consumer.
1553000	1557000	I mean, you know, but I guess according to that quote or whatever I had heard,
1557000	1560000	they were saying, you know,
1560000	1564000	well, we base it off the standard Xbox Live, you know, blah, blah, blah,
1564000	1567000	and if people make their controllers to the Xbox Live specifications,
1567000	1569000	then everything ought to work.
1569000	1571000	But for whatever reason, it doesn't seem to be working in this case,
1571000	1573000	which sucks for us in the end.
1573000	1574000	Not for me, though.
1574000	1578000	I resisted buying the bundle because I already had the Guitar Hero 2 controller, so.
1578000	1581000	Well, there's a lot of, like, third-party adapters that they have out there
1581000	1585000	that require, like, for example, the ones that hook up a keyboard and mouse
1585000	1588000	via the USB, you have to have a wired controller plugged in
1588000	1593000	because it reads that identifier off of the wired controller
1593000	1595000	and thinks it's just a wired controller plugged in.
1595000	1598000	Otherwise, it wouldn't work either because that platform is not open.
1598000	1602000	It's just, you know, the third-party companies have to license that stuff,
1602000	1605000	so when the, you know, homebrew guys decide to make an adapter for it,
1605000	1607000	they have to kind of trick it,
1607000	1613000	and maybe, maybe someone will come up with an adapter for, say,
1613000	1616000	the Rock Band guitar, the Hook Up 2, the 360,
1616000	1618000	that also has, like, a wired controller plugged in
1618000	1620000	that will allow you to do this, kind of bootleg it.
1620000	1623000	Or, in my opinion, the bigger company will hot-fix their game
1623000	1625000	to just make it work.
1625000	1628000	They'll find the specifications of the other guitar and just make it work.
1628000	1629000	I don't know.
1629000	1630000	We'll see, though.
1630000	1633000	Meanwhile, if you are heading out to buy Guitar Hero 3,
1633000	1637000	a word of warning from some folks who have been picking up their game at Walmart.
1637000	1640000	Apparently, you know how the big thing about Xbox 360 is that,
1640000	1643000	woo, there's this new wireless controller for Guitar Hero 3.
1643000	1646000	Well, apparently, check the box at Walmart,
1646000	1648000	because that may not be the case,
1648000	1651000	and this is something that was posted to the Score Hero forums.
1651000	1653000	This user named Torchy has started a thread.
1653000	1656000	Warning to those buying Guitar Hero 3 at Walmart.
1656000	1659000	Check your bundles, packaging carefully before you purchase
1659000	1661000	to ensure the correct guitar isn't closed.
1661000	1663000	And they have included screenshots,
1663000	1665000	and yes, there are some bundles of Guitar Hero 3
1665000	1670000	that come with the classic red SG Guitar controller,
1670000	1673000	and there are screenshots all over this thread to prove that it's true.
1673000	1676000	Now, who knows where this is coming from,
1676000	1678000	because I would think, well, this box, I mean,
1678000	1682000	I don't think Walmart could have cooked these boxes up themselves,
1682000	1685000	so it seems to me like it's some type of agreement with the company, in a way,
1685000	1688000	for Walmart to stay the low-priced leader or whatever.
1688000	1690000	They have to take some things out.
1690000	1692000	They can sell it probably cheaper
1692000	1694000	and get rid of some of those older guitars.
1694000	1695000	So...
1695000	1697000	That's completely false advertising, though.
1697000	1698000	Not really.
1698000	1699000	Well, it says it right on the box.
1699000	1700000	I don't think it's false advertising.
1700000	1702000	Yeah, I wouldn't say it's false advertising,
1702000	1705000	except it's kind of misleading for those of us
1705000	1706000	that have been following this game on the internet,
1706000	1709000	because we never knew that Walmart was going to do, ha ha ha, switcheroo.
1709000	1713000	And unfortunately, some of these people who ran to the store at midnight,
1713000	1715000	picked up the first copy of Guitar Hero 3 on the shelves,
1715000	1716000	like, oh, I've got to get that, you know,
1716000	1718000	and they maybe didn't think to read the box first,
1718000	1720000	because they were just so excited, right?
1720000	1721000	You know, who can fault them?
1721000	1722000	Hey, but hey, here's one thing, though.
1722000	1723000	You can always take it back to Walmart,
1723000	1725000	because they'll take returns on almost anything.
1725000	1726000	That is a very good point.
1726000	1729000	Walmart also has a very liberal return policy,
1729000	1731000	and quite frankly, you ought to tell them,
1731000	1734000	this was not the game I was expecting to buy.
1734000	1736000	This is not the controller that you're looking for.
1736000	1737000	Exactly.
1737000	1739000	So, there you have it.
1739000	1742000	So, be careful.
1742000	1746000	A word of warning to those who are going to be buying their game at Walmart,
1746000	1750000	although maybe you ought to just go to, like, Target, Best Buy, GameStop,
1750000	1752000	one of the thousands of other places,
1752000	1755000	or Guitar Center, for God's sake, sells this game.
1755000	1758000	Well, how about a good game?
1758000	1759000	Let's go to Rock Band.
1759000	1760000	Ah, Rock Band.
1760000	1761000	Wait, I thought you liked Guitar Hero 3.
1761000	1763000	I do, but I'm going for better.
1763000	1764000	Oh, snap.
1764000	1765000	All right.
1765000	1767000	I have high expectations of Rock Band.
1767000	1768000	I hope you're not disappointed.
1768000	1771000	So, there is a price point of $169.99 on it,
1771000	1774000	with 58 songs being 45 licensed tracks,
1774000	1777000	and 13 more unlockable,
1777000	1779000	and we have a complete list of songs,
1779000	1781000	if anybody wants to know.
1781000	1784000	I would like to know.
1784000	1786000	I would like to know the highlights.
1786000	1788000	Read the songs that jump out at you as awesome inclusions.
1788000	1791000	Well, Rolling Stones Give Me Shelter,
1791000	1794000	and The Who Won't Get Fooled Again,
1794000	1797000	Boston Foreplay, Long Time,
1797000	1800000	David Bowie, Suffragette City.
1800000	1802000	Oh, this game has David Bowie in it, and I'm happy it wins.
1802000	1805000	There's a cover of Paranoid by Black Sabbath,
1805000	1807000	Don't Fear the Reaper,
1807000	1810000	Blitzkrieg Pop by The Ramones,
1810000	1813000	Detroit Rock City by Kiss, though, that makes me happy.
1813000	1816000	We've also got Rush's Tom Sawyer,
1816000	1818000	which is one of my favorite songs.
1818000	1820000	Faith No More Epic,
1820000	1823000	Pixies Wave of Mutilation.
1823000	1827000	This is my favorite REM song, Orange Crush.
1827000	1830000	And we've also got Learn to Fly by Foo Fighters,
1830000	1832000	Inner Sandman Metallica.
1832000	1834000	We've got Weezer Say It Ain't So,
1834000	1836000	Radiohead Creep, and I love Radiohead.
1836000	1840000	BC Boy Sabotage, Black Hole Sun, I Think I'm Paranoid,
1840000	1843000	Celebrity Skin.
1843000	1846000	And then for the more current stuff, we have
1846000	1848000	OK Go, Here It Goes Again,
1848000	1850000	Nine Inch Nails, The Hand That Feeds,
1850000	1853000	Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Danny California,
1853000	1855000	The Killers, When You Were Young.
1855000	1859000	And then one of the unlockable tracks is
1859000	1861000	Bing Camaro, with Pleasure.
1861000	1863000	Random ass thought here.
1863000	1865000	I mean, it's kind of interesting because two of those bands
1865000	1867000	that are in the game, Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails,
1867000	1869000	have been in the news a lot lately about
1869000	1872000	kind of their defiance of traditional record releasing.
1872000	1874000	You know, obviously Radiohead put out their album
1874000	1876000	in rainbows on the internet for people to pay
1876000	1878000	whatever they want for it, and Nine Inch Nails
1878000	1880000	basically declared their independence from a record label recently.
1880000	1882000	It kind of gets me thinking,
1882000	1885000	is this type of Guitar Hero rock band thing
1885000	1887000	a possible delivery method promotional tool
1887000	1889000	of new songs by these artists in the future?
1889000	1891000	Yep, they've already said they want to do that.
1891000	1892000	Wow, that's pretty rad.
1892000	1894000	They're going to be releasing whole albums
1894000	1897000	and they're going to be tying in stuff with MTV,
1897000	1900000	and that is definitely something that's going to happen with rock band.
1900000	1901000	You watch.
1901000	1903000	Very interesting little tie in there.
1903000	1905000	I'm pretty happy with the list though.
1905000	1906000	I do want to say this though.
1906000	1908000	Oh, I thought you had your hand raised.
1908000	1909000	You had something you wanted to say.
1909000	1910000	No.
1910000	1912000	Sorry, bad radio.
1912000	1913000	I will say this though.
1913000	1916000	Unfortunately, rock band did not have heart.
1916000	1917000	I know, that makes me sad.
1917000	1918000	That does make me a little sad
1918000	1919000	because Guitar Hero 3 did have Barracuda,
1919000	1920000	which is all kinds of awesome.
1920000	1922000	Because pre-'80s heart was the best.
1922000	1923000	That's right.
1923000	1925000	And they were still that folk rock.
1925000	1926000	Well, I don't know.
1926000	1927000	I mean, some post-'80s, you know.
1927000	1929000	Oh no, in the 80s they had Gem Hair.
1929000	1931000	They did have Alone too, which was like the best song.
1931000	1932000	They had Gem Hair.
1932000	1936000	Anyway, thank you for the report on rock band, Dark Soccer.
1936000	1937000	I think it's awesome.
1937000	1941000	I wish they would have like, I don't know, Prodigy or something in there.
1941000	1942000	That'd be pretty awesome.
1942000	1944000	Nine Inch Nails in there.
1944000	1946000	That's really sweet.
1946000	1947000	That's what I'm saying.
1947000	1948000	If like rock band does well,
1948000	1950000	I really hope they put out something,
1950000	1958000	like something to appease those of us that didn't get more Beatmania in the US.
1958000	1959000	And I know that's kind of a bit, you know,
1959000	1961000	a lot of the purists for Beatmania are probably going to go,
1961000	1962000	what?
1962000	1966000	But seriously, like I would like to see some type of like trance dance
1966000	1969000	using the Beatmania concept but improving on it.
1969000	1970000	I think it'd be a lot of fun.
1970000	1973000	But using songs that we know a little more over here maybe.
1973000	1976000	Not to say the songs in Beatmania were bad because they really weren't.
1976000	1979000	Although I do feel the series has gotten a little stale
1979000	1981000	now that we're on what, 13th, 14th game.
1981000	1983000	I would like to see stuff like Prodigy and all these other.
1983000	1985000	If they did something like that,
1985000	1988000	I mean there's still even a lot of trance music and stuff out there
1988000	1993000	that's not mainstream unless you go to like a lot of clubs and raves and stuff
1993000	1994000	or you're in the scene.
1994000	1998000	You wouldn't really recognize a lot of it and it's still good music.
1998000	2002000	But anyways, put out a game with Above and Beyond in it.
2002000	2003000	I swear to God I'm so there.
2003000	2007000	I'll pay 60 bucks, 80 bucks for Control or hands down I'm there.
2007000	2009000	So some other interesting things.
2009000	2013000	And this is kind of something we've talked about before with patents and stuff.
2013000	2017000	And why the hell isn't Konami suing these people for using...
2017000	2021000	Obviously since Guitar Freak's Drummania came out way long before
2021000	2024000	Rock Band or Guitar Hero even around.
2024000	2025000	So what's up?
2025000	2030000	Well apparently actually Harmonics and they've been licensing
2030000	2032000	the rights to use this stuff.
2032000	2038000	Including the patents for the guitars are being licensed from Konami.
2038000	2043000	However for the drums stuff they're not licensing it since that's actually being...
2043000	2045000	They're using patents from Drumscape.
2045000	2050000	If you remember that MTV arcade drum game that came out a long time ago.
2050000	2051000	Vaguely.
2051000	2053000	I think I like saw it once and thought it looked kind of dumb.
2053000	2054000	I never played it.
2054000	2056000	So that was pretty interesting.
2056000	2060000	And also of course Activision is also licensing the rights for guitars as well.
2060000	2064000	So, you know, Konami doesn't need to necessarily bring out the game here
2064000	2068000	because they're making money outside from the sales of these.
2068000	2069000	Gotta go to chat.
2069000	2071000	chat.orangelaunchradio.com
2071000	2073000	Legend of Zaku says, fuck you Sky.
2073000	2077000	Konami needs to do it, not Harmonics Red Octane in regards to Beatmania.
2077000	2080000	If they want to do it, great.
2080000	2083000	But I'm not going to sit around and wait.
2083000	2084000	You know what I mean?
2084000	2087000	Like, I would totally support Konami doing this.
2087000	2088000	I wish they would.
2088000	2090000	I think they could do an awesome job with it.
2090000	2091000	But they're not.
2091000	2092000	You know what I mean?
2092000	2098000	Yeah, they're testing 2DX Gold in America, but that's not going to do it.
2098000	2101000	For those of us that have been hardcore into Balmaini for a long time,
2101000	2102000	yeah, that's awesome news.
2102000	2107000	But where did Guitar Hero succeed where Guitar Freaks did not?
2107000	2111000	Guitar Hero brought songs everybody knew and everybody wanted to play
2111000	2115000	and people wanted to rock out in their living room to well-known songs.
2115000	2119000	Unless Konami is willing to invest a little money in a powerhouse song list,
2119000	2121000	not going to happen, I'm sorry.
2121000	2124000	To me, that's fact.
2124000	2127000	And that's based on the success of Guitar Hero.
2127000	2131000	But if Konami wants to step up their game on Beatmania, I totally support it
2131000	2135000	and I think they could kick some major ass and beat these other guys to the punch
2135000	2137000	and show us why Konami was first.
2137000	2138000	I don't think they should bring it over.
2138000	2139000	I don't think they will.
2139000	2141000	I don't think they should because to be honest,
2141000	2145000	Konami, especially in their Balmaini line,
2145000	2147000	has not been innovative in the last ten years.
2147000	2150000	Seriously, what have we seen come out of there?
2150000	2157000	I mean, Extreme and Supernova and the Universe series
2157000	2161000	and hell, Hottest Party, that shit is not innovative at all.
2161000	2164000	It's just fucking copying and pasting shit from other games.
2164000	2168000	I agree and I don't because I actually thought some of the single-player modes
2168000	2171000	in Ultramix, I love Ultramix too.
2171000	2173000	I'm not talking about Ultramix.
2173000	2178000	Ultramix is fine, but they innovated a little bit when they brought it to the Xbox.
2178000	2180000	But I'm talking about Universe.
2180000	2184000	Universe, they didn't do shit with it and it's very evident.
2184000	2186000	I mean, how many download packs were there for?
2186000	2188000	Oh yeah, one.
2188000	2189000	Paid unlock packs.
2189000	2191000	Paid unlock packs, my mistake.
2191000	2192000	One.
2192000	2194000	One is the only thing that they had for it.
2194000	2197000	I mean, later on they could have had different unlock packs and stuff, but no.
2197000	2201000	But they're going to just release another retail version of the game six months later
2201000	2202000	because you know what?
2202000	2203000	You can make money off of it.
2203000	2205000	A lot more than you would those download packs.
2205000	2208000	So, I mean, this is what they did with Karaoke Revolution.
2208000	2213000	I hear you and I don't because I feel like Guitar Hero 2 kind of did the same thing with the first Guitar Hero.
2213000	2214000	You know what I mean?
2214000	2215000	They did.
2215000	2216000	They did.
2216000	2218000	I mean, and they did it with the Rock the 80s thing.
2218000	2220000	I mean, they were just trying to make more money on the side.
2220000	2224000	And yeah, they haven't innovated either, but that's the thing.
2224000	2229000	And that's why Guitar Hero 3 is very encouraging to me so far because I see like this online thing.
2229000	2233000	And I see like, okay, this really feels like a step up.
2233000	2237000	Maybe Konami needs to take a page out of what's going on here, hand it off to some other developers.
2237000	2238000	But see, that's the thing though.
2238000	2245000	It's like I can get excited about their arcade releases because that's some cool stuff that they're doing there.
2245000	2250000	But when their home releases come out, you know, nowadays I don't give a shit.
2250000	2252000	It's like, ooh, another DDR game.
2252000	2253000	That's really cool.
2253000	2256000	I mean, but who cares?
2256000	2259000	It's not like something I'm running out to the store and going to buy.
2259000	2264000	I used to because it was really exciting to see all these new songs and stuff.
2264000	2269000	But now it's just so watered down, they just don't care anymore it seems like.
2269000	2271000	It's like whatever, you know, it's DDR.
2271000	2275000	People will buy it because you'll exercise to it and stuff.
2275000	2277000	And that's the crowd that they're going after.
2277000	2279000	They don't care about the people that like the game.
2279000	2280000	Tonight's show is very interesting.
2280000	2283000	This is the throwback to our old days, for those that may not know.
2283000	2285000	Check us out the first time.
2285000	2290000	The first three years of our show or so, we were all about strictly music-based games
2290000	2294000	and talking about the DDR community and tournaments and then other things going on.
2294000	2297000	So very interesting tonight that we have all this music gaming news.
2297000	2298000	It's been a real throwback to our heyday.
2298000	2302000	So if we sound really passionate about these issues, it's because we are.
2302000	2305000	Loki, myself, DarkSakura, you know how we met?
2305000	2306000	Golfland, DDR.
2306000	2308000	Road trips to Miggle in the Bay.
2308000	2310000	We should do that again.
2310000	2311000	To play B-Mania 2DX.
2311000	2313000	This is how we should.
2313000	2316000	Like a throwback road tour.
2316000	2319000	I want to make it a regular thing again.
2319000	2321000	It would be fun.
2321000	2325000	Anyhow, hey guess what, the music news does not stop there
2325000	2330000	because now we have DDR Universe 2 is coming out a little later this year,
2330000	2331000	before the end of the year.
2331000	2334000	And the song list for that was just recently released.
2334000	2338000	I'm going to give DDR Universe 2 a shot because I actually did enjoy Universe 1,
2338000	2340000	although there were some major, major flaws in it.
2340000	2343000	But I like the song list, which usually is the...
2343000	2345000	That's the core part of any DDR game.
2345000	2347000	If it has a shitty song list, you're not going to want to play it.
2347000	2351000	So make what you will of this song list for DDR Universe 2.
2351000	2354000	I'm not going to read the whole thing, but let me tell you some of the licenses.
2354000	2356000	Take Me Out by Franz Ferdinand.
2356000	2357000	The Way You Move by OutKast.
2357000	2359000	Walk Like an Egyptian by The Bangles.
2359000	2361000	Rocket by Herbie Hancock.
2361000	2363000	Safety Dance with Men Without Hats.
2363000	2366000	He's the Greatest Dancer by Sister Sledge.
2366000	2369000	We've got a lot of throwback songs in this one.
2369000	2372000	And let's see, Fire by Ferry Corston.
2374000	2376000	I'm trying to see what else is here on that list.
2376000	2380000	We also have some pretty cool Konami remixes
2380000	2385000	because we have a new Contra medley mix by Niko Jira.
2385000	2386000	It's going to be in there.
2386000	2389000	So pretty cool.
2389000	2392000	Oh, Jelly Kiss is going to be downloadable, it looks like.
2392000	2396000	They have also announced some of the songs that are going to be in the first download pack.
2396000	2400000	And I hope this isn't Pay to Unlock, we don't know yet.
2400000	2401000	Oh, I bet you it is.
2401000	2404000	I bet you it is too, because that's why we already have the songs for it.
2404000	2405000	But we'll see.
2405000	2409000	So we don't know what to call it yet, but there will be some additional content for the game
2409000	2412000	that include a lot of songs that were in the UltraMix series.
2412000	2413000	Oh, look at that!
2413000	2415000	Dynamite Rave is a download pack.
2415000	2417000	Or a download...
2417000	2419000	We don't know.
2419000	2420000	Pay to Unlock song.
2420000	2421000	Dynamite Rave.
2421000	2424000	Who cares?
2424000	2427000	Seriously.
2427000	2432000	SSJ100Matt says Konami will never get the great licenses that Rock Band and Guitar Hero have.
2432000	2434000	Well, they should.
2434000	2437000	It's not like they're broke, right?
2437000	2440000	They could if they wanted to, in my opinion.
2440000	2441000	I don't think they really need to.
2441000	2446000	And I think Guitar Hero should be a lesson in what happens when you don't do it.
2446000	2447000	I don't know.
2447000	2448000	Whatever.
2448000	2452000	Anyway, lots of hate throwback to the old days music gaming,
2452000	2455000	but there's other console-type news we want to get to, such as release dates.
2455000	2456000	Yes, Jamie?
2456000	2463000	Well, for our friends in the UK, on the 31st is Mutant Storm Empire on Xbox 360,
2463000	2467000	and Tony Hawk's Proving Ground on the 31st.
2467000	2473000	And then coming up on November 1st, we have Need for Speed Pro Street for the mobile phone.
2473000	2479000	We have on the 2nd, Avatar the Burning Earth on Xbox 360, Blade Storm the Hundred Years' War,
2479000	2488000	FIFA Manager 08, Hellgate London, Naruto Rise of the Ninja and Naruto Ultimate Ninja Heroes,
2488000	2493000	NASCAR 2008, Chase for the Cup, NBA 2K8, Sonic Rivals 2,
2493000	2497000	Syphon Filter Dark Mirror, Tabula Rasa on PC,
2497000	2500000	The Simpsons Game, Tony Hawk's Proving Ground,
2500000	2508000	Warriors of the Lost Empire, Sam & Max Episode 201, Ice Station Santa.
2508000	2511000	Oh wait, I'm getting ahead of myself because that's on the 8th.
2511000	2512000	So that's it.
2512000	2513000	Santa.
2513000	2514000	Santa.
2514000	2519000	Anyways, in the US, there's quite a bit of stuff coming out,
2519000	2523000	including the ever-controversial Manhunt 2,
2523000	2527000	finally making its way out on PlayStation 2, PSP, and the Wii.
2527000	2531000	I'm sure we'll see a lot of that in the news probably in the next few weeks.
2531000	2536000	Of course, today Guitar Hero 3 came out, so go pick that up.
2536000	2541000	Other platforms, Disgaea Afternoon of Darkness on PSP.
2541000	2544000	Let's see, we've also got Ben 10.
2544000	2546000	That's coming out on quite a few platforms.
2546000	2553000	PlayStation 2, PSP, Wii, and I believe the DS.
2553000	2558000	Also, there's Cars Mater National, which is a sequel to the Cars game that came out last year,
2558000	2559000	which sucked, by the way.
2559000	2566000	That was another one of those launch racing games that God knows blew for the Wii.
2566000	2568000	Anyways, let's see here.
2568000	2570000	Also on the Wii, Battalion Wars 2.
2570000	2572000	That one actually looks pretty good.
2572000	2574000	That's coming out this week.
2574000	2576000	And let's see, The Simpsons Game.
2576000	2578000	It's going to be out on almost everything.
2578000	2584000	PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, 360, the Wii, and DS.
2584000	2589000	Also on the PlayStation 3 this week, the Ever Delayed Stranglehold.
2589000	2593000	That's going to be coming out as well as the collector's edition.
2593000	2599000	And let's see, on PC we have Hellgate London.
2599000	2604000	That's going to be coming out as well as The Witcher.
2604000	2610000	And let's see, on DS, Barbie Island Princess.
2610000	2611000	Yay!
2611000	2614000	That's also coming out on the Wii, I believe, and PS2.
2614000	2617000	What exactly does Barbie do in Island Princess?
2617000	2619000	It's based off some DVD that came out.
2619000	2627000	Does she vote off her friends off the island one at a time in Who is the Prettiest Supremacy?
2627000	2629000	I don't know.
2629000	2630000	What else is coming out?
2630000	2631000	Assault Heroes.
2631000	2633000	That's also coming out on PC.
2633000	2636000	That was an Xbox Live Arcade title as well.
2636000	2639000	As seen with that Battlestar Galactica game.
2639000	2641000	That's also coming out.
2641000	2644000	The Command & Conquer Saga, also on PC.
2644000	2649000	That was the one that came with practically every single Command & Conquer game ever released.
2649000	2650000	That's pretty awesome.
2650000	2657000	And let's see here, I think that's it as far as PC goes.
2657000	2666000	And then this week, also Naruto, Rise of a Ninja on 360, Viva Pinata Party Animals on the Xbox 360.
2666000	2667000	Woohoo!
2667000	2669000	And then Virtua Fighter 5.
2669000	2670000	That's also coming out.
2670000	2673000	Oh, and Time Shipt on Xbox 360 as well.
2673000	2676000	Chat comments, GS68 says it's a fucking Barbie game.
2676000	2677000	Skip!
2677000	2679000	Frisbee says the tribe has spoken.
2679000	2681000	Ken, pack your bags.
2681000	2687000	Oh, and Ratatouille Food Frenzy on DS, which is a ripoff of Cooking Mama.
2687000	2692000	That may not necessarily be a bad thing, because now you're mixing Cooking Mama with Disney Pixar franchises.
2692000	2693000	That could be okay.
2693000	2695000	Pixar can do no wrong.
2695000	2696000	What?
2696000	2698000	Pixar can do no wrong.
2698000	2699000	I don't know.
2699000	2700000	I don't know.
2700000	2704000	In the video game realm, they've licensed their stuff out questionably before.
2704000	2705000	But Pixar didn't do it.
2705000	2706000	They just licensed it.
2706000	2707000	That's true.
2707000	2708000	Pixar themselves can do no wrong.
2708000	2710000	It's THQ they released it, so.
2710000	2712000	Well, THQ can do some wrong.
2712000	2713000	Yeah.
2713000	2714000	Hopefully they won't.
2714000	2715000	We'll have faith.
2715000	2717000	Going to Japanese release dates.
2717000	2718000	We're ready for those.
2718000	2719000	Japanese release dates.
2719000	2724000	Xbox 360 seeing a lot of games getting a price cut this week, and we'll find out why a little bit later.
2724000	2732000	But Dead or Alive 4, Dead Rising, Gears of War, The Idolmaster, Project Silpheed, a lot, a lot of games getting price cuts.
2732000	2739000	As far as new games go, you can check out Ace Combat 6, The Fires of Liberation, and Viva Pinata Party Animals coming out on the Xbox 360 in Japan.
2739000	2740000	This week.
2740000	2743000	Going to some other platforms on the Nintendo Wii.
2743000	2749000	Opuna is coming out in Japan on the 1st of November, as well as Super Mario Galaxy.
2749000	2750000	Opuna looked weird.
2750000	2753000	Wasn't that that one where you control the entire game with like the nunchuck?
2753000	2755000	I believe that is the game, yes.
2755000	2757000	I'll pull up more information.
2757000	2758000	I'll come back to that in a moment.
2758000	2765000	And read some other release dates, such as the PlayStation 3 is getting GI Jockey 4 2007.
2765000	2768000	We know that here is winning post 7.
2768000	2774000	And Railfan, Taiwan High Speed Rail.
2774000	2775000	Go Trainsims.
2775000	2776000	I guess, yeah, there you go.
2776000	2787000	High Speed Trainsim goes to Turbo Speed on the PlayStation 2 MotoGP07, another port of GI Jockey 4, and Super Robot Tyson Scramble Commander II.
2787000	2789000	Just what we need, more Robot Tyson.
2789000	2790000	That's right.
2790000	2791000	Oh my God.
2791000	2792000	They're in the anime series now too.
2792000	2793000	That's kind of cool.
2793000	2798000	I played one of the Robot Tyson games that had the EVA units in it.
2798000	2799000	It was pretty cool.
2799000	2801000	Oh, I forgot to mention a couple also in the US.
2801000	2803000	Disney's High School Musical, the game.
2803000	2805000	Let's get that for Shane.
2805000	2808000	High School Musical Sing It on PlayStation 2.
2808000	2810000	You know what I bought Shane for his birthday?
2810000	2811000	What?
2811000	2812000	Just going on a total tangent here.
2812000	2816000	I bought him tickets to see High School Musical on Ice here in Sacramento, and then he moved to Kansas.
2816000	2818000	So, I don't know.
2818000	2819000	I'll go with you.
2819000	2821000	Well, he has to send me the tickets because it's this weekend.
2821000	2823000	Oh, dude, tell him to send them back.
2823000	2824000	I think he still has the tickets.
2824000	2825000	Tell him to FedEx it.
2825000	2826000	I'll go with you.
2826000	2827000	Well, FedEx me your birthday present because Jamie and I are going.
2827000	2828000	I'll go.
2828000	2829000	I'll totally go.
2829000	2830000	You really want to go see High School Musical on Ice?
2830000	2831000	I just want to go do something.
2831000	2832000	I don't know.
2832000	2833000	It's just going to...
2833000	2835000	I've never been to see anything on Ice.
2835000	2839000	I know this is going to sound really wrong, but it just sounds so gay.
2839000	2840000	I want to go.
2840000	2845000	I petition that they have Manhunt 2 on Ice because that would be something I would like
2845000	2846000	to see.
2846000	2847000	Blood bounces.
2847000	2850000	I don't even think I could get my boyfriend to go see High School Musical on Ice with
2850000	2851000	me.
2851000	2852000	That's how gay it is.
2852000	2853000	That's, like, super gay.
2853000	2855000	That's like it's gay enough to like High School Musical.
2855000	2856000	I would go see it for the novelty.
2856000	2858000	And the fact that it's on Ice.
2858000	2861000	Why do people need to put things on Ice?
2861000	2863000	Stop encouraging ice skaters.
2863000	2865000	I mean, seriously, it's not a sport.
2865000	2866000	I love ice skating.
2866000	2867000	Ice skating is great.
2867000	2868000	It's horrible.
2868000	2869000	Ice skating is fun.
2869000	2872000	My mom used to be an amateur roller skater and did figure roller skating.
2872000	2873000	Roller skating is fine.
2873000	2875000	I still don't like the figure skating part.
2875000	2877000	Roller derby is cool, though.
2877000	2878000	Actually, it's kind of lame.
2878000	2882000	We have a roller derby team in Sacramento that they wanted me to audition for.
2882000	2883000	That's awesome.
2883000	2884000	I could punch people.
2884000	2885000	I'd be good at it.
2885000	2888000	You know, though, you totally reminded me of something I didn't mention in my gaming
2888000	2889000	week.
2889000	2890000	What?
2890000	2891000	We have Ace Combat 6 with a controller.
2891000	2892000	Oh, how's that going?
2892000	2895000	I get totally motion sick on it, but it's really cool.
2895000	2896000	Cool.
2896000	2898000	The controller is really nice.
2898000	2901000	You know how they could get more people to go to E for All next year?
2901000	2903000	Put it on Ice.
2903000	2904000	E for All on Ice.
2904000	2906000	I've never been ice skating, Rob.
2906000	2907000	Yeah.
2907000	2908000	I've never been ice skating.
2908000	2910000	Although, I hear E for All might get put on ice anyway.
2910000	2912000	You've never been ice skating at all?
2912000	2913000	Never.
2913000	2914000	We're going to go.
2914000	2915000	Okay.
2915000	2916000	We have to for this Christmas.
2916000	2918000	We're going to go because when my leg gets better, though.
2918000	2922000	We can't do it this week, but when my leg gets better, we'll go ice skating for sure.
2922000	2924000	Just in time for the holidays.
2924000	2926000	But I've been water skiing.
2926000	2927000	Good times.
2927000	2928000	Ice skating sucks.
2928000	2929000	I hate it.
2929000	2930000	I've tried it.
2930000	2931000	It's okay, but it's lame.
2931000	2933000	I'm really good at roller skating, though.
2933000	2935000	I used to be able to do all kinds of stuff.
2935000	2937000	Cardamo says roller skating on ice.
2937000	2939000	Tigerclaw says DDR on ice.
2939000	2940000	No.
2940000	2941000	There you have it.
2941000	2942000	Do not want.
2942000	2943000	GS68 says Mario Kart on ice.
2943000	2944000	Oh, wait.
2944000	2945000	They actually have those stages.
2945000	2947000	You want to play Mario Kart in real life?
2947000	2949000	Go to that RPM place that's near here.
2949000	2950000	That's lame.
2950000	2952000	That's like real life Mario Kart without the shells.
2952000	2955000	You can't pass people because their tracks are too small.
2955000	2956000	I had fun.
2956000	2958000	William and I went on a date once to go to the...
2958000	2959000	We had fun.
2959000	2960000	It was cool.
2960000	2962000	If the tracks were a lot bigger, I mean, hell yeah.
2962000	2964000	Because you can drift around those corners and stuff.
2964000	2965000	It's a good time.
2965000	2967000	But then some of those car tires are all fucked up.
2967000	2969000	I've never been kart racing right here.
2969000	2970000	I've got a membership there.
2970000	2973000	You wouldn't know the last time I did anything on a go-kart was Autopia at Disneyland.
2973000	2974000	My first time going.
2974000	2975000	Really?
2975000	2976000	And I haven't done Autopia since.
2976000	2977000	Wow.
2977000	2981000	And before that, it was at the Miracle Strip in Panama City, Florida, which they tore down
2981000	2982000	the Miracle Strip.
2982000	2983000	I never go on Autopia.
2983000	2984000	Isn't it on a track?
2984000	2985000	Isn't it on a lane?
2985000	2986000	Yeah, it is.
2986000	2989000	They had this thing that was called like...
2989000	2993000	It was another car type thing, but you could actually drive these little cars.
2993000	2996000	Like, you had a set path that they went on, but they weren't on a track.
2996000	2997000	So you could actually run into people.
2997000	2998000	It was great.
2998000	2999000	I'm sorry, internets.
2999000	3003680	We were talking about Japanese release dates, and suddenly we got into RPM motor racing
3003680	3006120	and all that stuff.
3006120	3007120	That's why they listened to us.
3007120	3010000	And the charity was still going into crap on ice.
3010000	3011000	Great.
3011000	3012000	Violent fight on ice.
3012000	3013600	Rama says Pokemon on ice.
3013600	3014600	Dude, I think they have that.
3014600	3015600	I think they've done that.
3015600	3016600	I think they've done that.
3016600	3017600	Yeah.
3017600	3018600	Did you see that picture on...
3018600	3019600	I'm never going to get these dates on.
3019600	3021820	Did you see that picture on Dig this week?
3021820	3027200	The whole thing, it was the picture of Pikachu, and it looked like he had a Vageen.
3027200	3031200	Okay, somebody in the chat room, please dig up that picture, because Loki and Dark Soccer
3031200	3032600	gave me blank stares right now.
3032600	3035240	I need to show them the Pikachu picture that was on Dig earlier this week.
3035240	3036240	It was so funny.
3036240	3037240	Did he have, like, camel toe?
3037240	3043440	No, but it was like a giant blow-up Pikachu, like at an amusement park, and all these kids
3043440	3045000	were going in, but it looked like...
3045000	3046240	They were going in his crotch.
3046240	3049240	They were going in a big pika-gina, pika-gina.
3049240	3057760	That was great, yeah, I think you can put that on your original Trauma Center on Ice
3057760	3058760	when...
3058760	3059760	I'm sorry, can we...
3059760	3060760	I need to finish the Japanese release dates.
3060760	3061760	I apologize.
3061760	3063200	That would help, Rob.
3063200	3068840	On the Nintendo DS this week in Japan, Dragon Tamer, Sound Spirits.
3068840	3069840	In the...
3069840	3071640	How in the hell am I supposed to pronounce this this week?
3071640	3080480	Zaiden Hojen Nippon Kanji Norioku Kenti Kyoukai Koshiki Soft 250 Manin no Kanken.
3080480	3084040	That is the biggest fucking game name I've ever seen.
3084040	3087640	It looks like it's some type of, like, brain training type game with, like, 250 different
3087640	3089720	little minigames in it.
3089720	3090720	Woof!
3090720	3095620	Wow, let's see, also of note, I want to go to PSP dates real quick, and then we can move
3095620	3097140	on with the rest of the show.
3097140	3104200	So in Japan, on the PSP, just movies, no games this week, but if you want to pick up Gremlins,
3104200	3105200	it's out this week.
3105200	3106200	Gremlins is the best movie ever!
3106200	3107440	Yes, I suggest you do.
3107440	3111940	I forgot something I played this week, and this is worth mentioning, sorry to derail
3111940	3117240	the whole show here, but I downloaded a CDI emulator.
3117240	3118240	What?
3118240	3123900	And they have a ROM online for Super Mario Wacky Worlds.
3123900	3127260	It was an unreleased game that is awful!
3127260	3128800	It was so horrible!
3128800	3131720	And I played it for about five minutes.
3131720	3132720	Here's the picture, Loki.
3132720	3134040	Oh, that's pretty bad.
3134040	3136600	What's the CDI should not, oh my god.
3136600	3140960	Yeah, so, yeah, the pan is on, oh my god, it was so horrible.
3140960	3145920	I mean, basically they just ripped the sprites and music out of Super Mario World and just
3145920	3148880	took a dump on it, and that's basically what it was.
3148880	3149880	Horrible.
3149880	3151920	SSJ100Matt asks, worse than Hotel Mario?
3151920	3153680	Yes, worse than Hotel Mario.
3153680	3154680	Well, maybe not.
3154680	3157560	GS68 says, you're just pissing in an ocean of piss.
3157560	3161720	I know.
3161720	3162720	By the way...
3162720	3165160	But they did have all the Zelda games on there too, if you want to play them.
3165160	3169480	I swear to god, we'll move on with the show just after I say that Upuna does look to be
3169480	3172360	that game I think you were thinking about, it's actually, wait, no, it's a role-playing
3172360	3173360	game.
3173360	3174360	It is a role-playing game.
3174360	3175360	You control the entire thing with the nunchucks.
3175360	3176360	But it looks cute.
3176360	3179400	I hope they release that over here, it's by Koei, and there's the little box art.
3179400	3181920	You know what Koei gave us, Rob?
3181920	3187600	They gave us that game with the girl riding a missile, KO Flying Squadron.
3187600	3192560	I could say something about girls riding missiles, but I won't in light of moving on with our
3192560	3193560	program.
3193560	3195560	Forza 2!
3195560	3200080	Downloadable content has a price cut because people bitched about it enough.
3200080	3209240	So the Twin Ring Motegi track is going to be decreased from 600 points to 400 points.
3209240	3212960	Please you're paying too much.
3212960	3218120	Funny because when we complained about the Guitar Hero download content, they didn't
3218120	3221240	seem to care.
3221240	3226900	We're selling plenty of it, shut up.
3226900	3230000	So an interesting rumor has come out this week.
3230000	3236500	Apparently someone who had gotten their 360 returned back from Microsoft after being repaired
3236500	3241920	noticed that there was a few additional options in their dashboard, including stuff for the
3241920	3250880	360's IPTV feature that was announced, I want to say a Tokyo Game Show, Consumer Electronics
3250880	3251880	Show, I think this year.
3251880	3254940	Is either that or Game Developers Conference.
3254940	3259200	One of those shows earlier this year, it was announced.
3259200	3260720	Good reporting, Loki.
3260720	3261720	Excellent reporting.
3261720	3262720	Awesome.
3262720	3267220	So apparently it's going to have different features including being able to pause and
3267220	3271920	record stuff being streamed off there.
3271920	3276080	Of course none of these features really worked on it, but it's interesting to see that that's
3276080	3284680	actually in his dashboard now, so most likely going to be included in the fall update.
3284680	3288180	Now what I want to know is how the hell did that happen in the first place?
3288180	3291120	How did some guy get this random update?
3291120	3295360	Because I guess if he shipped his Xbox back, did they just send him a new Xbox that were
3295360	3298440	meant to be held off until the update goes live or whatever?
3298440	3300480	Maybe because it doesn't look like it's the entire update.
3300480	3304760	Maybe they had an updated firmware or something like that that's going to be rolling out.
3304760	3307360	I don't know when exactly the fall update is rolling out.
3307360	3311160	It's probably within the next few weeks, so they're just probably getting it ready to
3311160	3312160	go.
3312160	3316000	What I would be curious of is that in light of this news, I wonder if other people that
3316000	3318860	are getting their consoles back from Microsoft are going to find the same thing.
3318860	3322000	One of my LiveJournal friends just had to send back their Xbox for Red Rings of Death,
3322000	3324160	so I wonder if his is going to come back with that.
3324160	3325160	Maybe.
3325160	3327760	I don't know.
3327760	3328760	It's interesting.
3328760	3333480	I can't wait to have the IPTV stuff because, shit, more shows to watch.
3333480	3337080	Although I'm not too familiar with Microsoft's IPTV service.
3337080	3338080	I haven't been able to stay on-
3338080	3343840	I'm actually very unhappy that my place I usually watch TV online is going away.
3343840	3345560	TVlinks.co.uk.
3345560	3346560	They got shut down?
3346560	3348160	Yeah, they're on their way.
3348160	3352200	They went the way of Oink, which was another huge news story this week.
3352200	3353200	Anyhow.
3353200	3358120	How else am I going to watch bullshit?
3358120	3359840	I don't know.
3359840	3360840	Mininova or something?
3360840	3361840	I don't know.
3361840	3366600	Anyway, going back to the Xbox Live Marketplace and other Xbox news, Blue Dragon, which is
3366600	3370800	a game I need to go back and finish, has some new content.
3370800	3376720	Apparently there is a new six-treasure pack for Blue Dragon.
3376720	3381520	You have to pay 200 points for it, but you get some new items that will allow you to
3381520	3383320	boost abilities.
3383320	3386520	It sounds like this is some pay-to-unlock content for me because you're going to get
3386520	3392520	a Whimsical Mind, which randomly enhances things by zero to four levels.
3392520	3396760	The Way of Thieves, a battle item that will automatically steal rare items possessed by
3396760	3398000	enemy creatures.
3398000	3402600	The DV Phonograph, which will let you listen to the DV tribe dance, which is so freaking
3402600	3403600	cute.
3403600	3405520	I actually want to get that song because I actually got to that part of the game.
3405520	3406920	It is a really cute song.
3406920	3413360	The Nothing Glasses, it visualizes all those points because you can search everywhere in
3413360	3414360	this game.
3414360	3418600	It will allow you to actually see the points that you can search with little star symbols
3418600	3421640	instead of just going around aimlessly.
3421640	3425160	The Shuffled Helmet that will adjust magical and speed parameters.
3425160	3430240	The Spring Wind Scarf, which will adjust HP and speed parameters by 20%.
3430240	3432860	Basically you're going to pay 200 points to make the game a lot easier, it sounds like
3432860	3435860	to me, which is interesting.
3435860	3441400	It kind of reminds me of the previous story we had a few weeks ago about the whole pay-to-get
3441400	3444720	things you will unlock yourself later in the game, except you're not actually going to
3444720	3445720	unlock the player, it just makes the game easier.
3445720	3450000	Well, the glass download content you paid to make the game harder, so now you have a
3450000	3452040	full range of stuff.
3452040	3453040	Interesting.
3453040	3458000	Also, I just want to mention real quick, Spider-Man 3 has a new unlock as well.
3458000	3462920	You get to download New Goblin, and this is notable because it was a Playstation 3 exclusive
3462920	3467420	feature, but now for 240 Microsoft points, you can have it on 360.
3467420	3469980	Which I heard by the way is lame.
3469980	3470980	I wouldn't know.
3470980	3476480	I try to avoid games based off of movies unless they're really good, which I can't even think
3476480	3477480	of any off the top of my head.
3477480	3480820	I don't know why you would still have Spider-Man 3 anyways, because I think that game really
3480820	3487000	sucked and so, you know, it's probably not worth anything right now anyways.
3487000	3493760	Well, for our friends in Japan, the Xbox 360 is getting a price cut.
3493760	3498000	Finally, we knew it would eventually happen.
3498000	3505800	The price cut is going to happen on November 1st, and it should be the equivalent of $243.
3505800	3508360	Wow, that's a big cut.
3508360	3509360	Yep.
3509360	3510360	Nice.
3510360	3513240	And this would be also why all those games I read earlier are getting a cut as well.
3513240	3514680	I'm sure this all ties in.
3514680	3520220	Make the Xbox 360 a little more cheap and maybe it can get a little steam in Japan.
3520220	3523120	I know there's a few 360 games that are going to be dropping in price.
3523120	3526760	I can't remember which ones, and I also know that there's some being discontinued.
3526760	3527760	Wow.
3527760	3529720	Like, Perfect Dark Zero is one of them.
3529720	3530720	I remember.
3530720	3533200	Good riddance, I'm sorry, but not a fan of Perfect Dark Zero.
3533200	3536000	Make way for Perfect Dark Zero 2.
3536000	3538200	Nah, please no.
3538200	3539720	Where you still can't jump.
3539720	3541120	Fucking hate that.
3541120	3542600	That's the thing.
3542600	3544560	Next-gen system, no jumping.
3544560	3549360	The one game you can jump quite far in, actually, is Burnout Paradise, which is going to be
3549360	3555880	coming to the US in January on the 22nd, and that is going to feature an open-world environment,
3555880	3558800	which is going to be kind of interesting, because I know none of the other games have
3558800	3564000	been like that, but you can basically drive around aimlessly really fast, smash into stuff,
3564000	3565920	jump through the air, explode.
3565920	3570240	All the fun stuff that you would be looking for in a Burnout game.
3570240	3574500	So it seems that publishers are starting to get a little smart in releasing stuff in these
3574500	3581360	slow months, like January and February and the entire summer, instead of just March and
3581360	3583840	November and October.
3583840	3588920	I'm liking this whole trend lately where it seems like game companies are learning there's
3588920	3590680	12 months in a year.
3590680	3592200	It's kind of exciting.
3592200	3597360	They need to seriously do that, because usually March, everything piles up there, because
3597360	3600920	that's the end of the fiscal year for a lot of the companies, and in November because
3600920	3602720	of the holidays.
3602720	3607040	I understand why you do the holiday push with the little kid games and the things that tie
3607040	3610660	into children's movies, like the Pixar movies and those like, I understand why you do that
3610660	3614520	for the holidays, because those are perfect games to get children that are into Santa
3614520	3616160	and all that stuff, right?
3616160	3620720	But games like Burnout Paradise, that caters to a crowd that's going to probably go out
3620720	3622960	and pick up a game whenever they damn well feel like it.
3622960	3626120	So I don't think they're going to take a loss by releasing this in January.
3626120	3631720	But it's good, though, that it's coming out in January and not like, say, November, when
3631720	3633240	there's a ton of shit coming out.
3633240	3637280	In January, I mean, January's actually looking pretty good game-wise so far.
3637280	3645520	They have NFL Tour, Devil May Cry 4, God knows what else, and then as well as this now.
3645520	3648520	If they put it in a month that there's really nothing coming out, people are going to buy
3648520	3652240	that game instead of saying, well, I'm going to buy this one instead and save my money,
3652240	3659000	and then later on they may just decide not to pick it up.
3659000	3661280	Well some other games that you might be able to play through the Christmas season, and
3661280	3664840	speaking of games that are geared at little kids, although I bet some big kids would like
3664840	3665840	this, too.
3665840	3669960	THQ has announced they are bringing four new games to Xbox Live Arcade, and some of these
3669960	3673520	are very notable because they tie into Nickelodeon licenses.
3673520	3680120	SpongeBob SquarePants UnderPants Slam is coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, and I have to admit,
3680120	3684040	you know, hate me, call me names if you want, I think SpongeBob's hilarious.
3684040	3686760	The movie was so funny, but in a stupid way.
3686760	3688420	It's stupid funny, right?
3688420	3692080	So I'm kind of curious to see what the game's like, because I worry, because it's not like
3692080	3695720	this is the first time there's been a SpongeBob game, and most of the games are made of suck
3695720	3700560	and lose, but this, you know, being an Xbox Live Arcade game, I imagine it's not going
3700560	3706200	to be that great, but it does kind of open up Xbox Live Arcade to being, you know, a
3706200	3710560	lot of times Microsoft takes some shit for not being very kid-friendly, and certainly
3710560	3714160	you know Microsoft's going to be pushing this, especially with their new Xbox 360 arcade
3714160	3718920	console really pushing the family thing when Cenet comes out and all that.
3718920	3722360	That's part of their marketing, they have a whole family marketing plan that includes
3722360	3729360	that, Cenet, DDR Universe, actually Guitar Hero 3, and then these titles as well, Viva
3729360	3735080	Piñata Party, and then of course the Xbox Live Arcade stuff, and I know they did some
3735080	3738520	other announcements about like cartoons and stuff, so.
3738520	3742960	By the way, the other games that THQ is going to be releasing, a game called Screw Jumper,
3742960	3745720	Elements of Destruction, and Rocket Riot.
3745720	3746720	SpongeBob and Screw Jumper.
3746720	3747720	Screw Jumper.
3747720	3751400	Yeah, it's kind of an odd name, but they are both scheduled for release next month, so
3751400	3752400	they'll be here in time for Christmas.
3752400	3754000	You know what the world needs less of?
3754000	3755000	Hmm.
3755000	3756000	SpongeBob.
3756000	3757000	Yeah, I love SpongeBob.
3757000	3760120	Elements of Destruction I know is coming out in the DS next year as well.
3760120	3764040	Screw Jumper, if you want to know what the hell that is, it's a vertical action racing
3764040	3766840	game, that's per an interview from the developers.
3766840	3771880	You have to destroy alien mining equipment and architecture while plummeting downward
3771880	3774720	in a continual rapid free-fall descent.
3774720	3778940	The objective of the game is to maximize score by crashing into and dynamiting as many alien
3778940	3783520	structures as possible on the way down the mine shaft, then to initiate a detonation
3783520	3786040	and race back to safety on the planet's surface.
3786040	3788300	So honestly, this sounds like it might not be bad.
3788300	3792040	It's got aliens, it's got explosions, it's fast, it's racing.
3792040	3794120	Screw Jumper might be pretty awesome, we'll see though.
3794120	3798120	But sometimes games that seem awesome in theory really suck, so we have to hold out until
3798120	3800340	the demo's out.
3800340	3801340	This November.
3801340	3802340	That's so disappointing.
3802340	3804200	What the hell did the alien miners do to you?
3804200	3806560	I mean seriously, why do you have to destroy their shit?
3806560	3808180	That's what I want to know.
3808180	3809180	They're mining communism.
3809180	3813000	Oh, well in that case, let's down with communism.
3813000	3814000	That's right.
3814000	3816360	I don't know where that came from.
3816360	3818220	I don't either.
3818220	3822320	It just seemed like the patriotic thing to say 40 years ago.
3822320	3823320	Yeah.
3823320	3827820	Drunami says, down with pants.
3827820	3829920	Isn't this SpongeBob SquarePants?
3829920	3830920	Maybe that's what they did.
3830920	3833080	Maybe the aliens brought us SpongeBob SquarePants, and that's why they have to pay.
3833080	3835000	Maybe the aliens are SpongeBob SquarePants.
3835000	3837320	Maybe they're mining underpants.
3837320	3838320	Underpants slam.
3838320	3840800	That sounds kind of dirty.
3840800	3841800	You know what?
3841800	3843440	Nobody likes dirty underpants.
3843440	3844440	You know what?
3844440	3845440	Unless you're some sick fetishist.
3845440	3846440	Yes, Jamie.
3846440	3849300	I like watching real stuff, so.
3849300	3850300	You know what?
3850300	3857920	I miss all the stuff from when I was a kid, because they expected kids to follow the story.
3857920	3858920	Imagination?
3858920	3859920	Yeah, imagination.
3859920	3861280	That's what the Muppet Babies was all about.
3861280	3862280	What the Babies is great.
3862280	3864240	Tell me that cartoon wasn't the shit.
3864240	3865240	That's what that was all about.
3865240	3867600	I'll tell you, though, what I've had a revival of lately.
3867600	3869040	Loki wants to make a joke.
3869040	3870920	Did you see Drawn Together Babies?
3870920	3874120	No, God, no, I didn't.
3874120	3876600	Drawn Together wasn't funny last season, so I've been watching it.
3876600	3880280	I've been having a revival of Count Duckula.
3880280	3881760	That's pretty awesome.
3881760	3882760	And Danger Mouse.
3882760	3888280	But I tried going back watching Banana Man, and my God, that was horrible.
3888280	3892040	I can't believe I liked Banana Man when I was 12.
3892040	3894040	So you like Banana Man?
3894040	3896480	I used to like Banana Man.
3896480	3898560	Very very weird little British tune.
3898560	3899560	Next story, please.
3899560	3901440	Yeah, Xbox 360 crap.
3901440	3902440	How about that?
3902440	3903440	Yay.
3903440	3908080	Toshiba is saying no comment, except they didn't actually say comment, they just said
3908080	3909080	no.
3909080	3913920	It's about the Xbox 360 HDTVT rumor.
3913920	3916200	So, wait a minute.
3916200	3923680	I mean, because, no, would you like to comment on the internal Xbox 360 HDTVT track?
3923680	3924680	No.
3924680	3929640	Toshiba said no to the new Xbox 360 HDTVT rumor.
3929640	3933160	But we pretty much all still think it's a rumor, so whatever.
3933160	3934160	You know why this is newsworthy?
3934160	3935160	We don't believe them.
3935160	3937000	Yeah, you know why this is newsworthy?
3937000	3939320	Because you know what they say about Microsoft rumors.
3939320	3940320	They're all true.
3940320	3941320	They're fucking all true.
3941320	3947880	If they don't have any, if they don't reek of fanboyism, they're usually true.
3947880	3953280	The fact that they said no comment instead of no we have nothing planned, you know, is...
3953280	3954280	Exactly.
3954280	3955280	No comment?
3955280	3956280	Fuck.
3956280	3957280	How'd they know?
3957280	3958280	Goddammit.
3958280	3968120	Anyways, one game I'm actually kind of excited to see coming to Xbox Live Arcade this week
3968120	3970560	is going to be Mutant Storm Empire.
3970560	3973960	And I loved the Mutant Storm Reloaded game when it came out, still one of my favorite
3973960	3974960	shooter games.
3974960	3978400	It was a little bit overlooked because it was too similar to Geometry Wars, I think,
3978400	3979800	and it's slower paced.
3979800	3980800	Yeah.
3980800	3981800	This one, though, looks really cool.
3981800	3983240	They have it set up a little bit different.
3983240	3987760	Some of the changes you'll see from Reloaded is that the stages now, you actually kind
3987760	3992920	of, it's one long stage, doors open up, and it's kind of almost like a cross between Geometry
3992920	3995040	Wars and Smash TV almost.
3995040	3997960	That's good, because one of the biggest complaints I heard about the last Mutant Storm game was
3997960	4002840	that load between the levels, like that little stupid effect it would do, like it sounds
4002840	4008080	like a dying cat, but not really, like between levels, as it's shifting, you know, that kind
4008080	4009400	of slowed the action down.
4009400	4011200	So you hear that it's one giant level, that's awesome.
4011200	4014400	Like the fucking Wayne's World camera effects or something like that, you know.
4014400	4015400	Yeah, exactly.
4015400	4017760	That would have been more entertaining.
4017760	4020520	But yeah, it's going to be coming out for 800 points.
4020520	4026400	It's due out this Wednesday, October 31st, and it's going to be awesome.
4026400	4035800	I hope since it's Halloween, we're going to get some cheesy Halloween tie-in on the Xbox
4035800	4036800	Live Marketplace.
4036800	4037800	Yaris 2!
4037800	4038800	Because it's scary.
4038800	4043760	That is pretty scary.
4043760	4049520	This time, not only does it have tentacles, but it has mech destroyer legs that the car
4049520	4052880	runs on.
4052880	4058120	The game will just evolve into something that's not even Yaris, it's just like, whatever.
4058120	4062160	I think for the next year, we should make every effort to make a Yaris joke every week
4062160	4063160	on the program.
4063160	4067740	Didn't that game remind you of like, the programmers of that After Dark screensaver decided to
4067740	4069760	make a game and this is what it was?
4069760	4071360	Guess what Jamie never played?
4071360	4072360	What?
4072360	4073360	Yaris.
4073360	4074360	Well, it's probably a good thing.
4074360	4075360	Yeah.
4075360	4077000	Consider yourself one of the lucky ones.
4077000	4078000	It's free.
4078000	4079000	Download me!
4079000	4080000	I'm free!
4080000	4084200	I know it's a free game, hey, if it sucks, whatever, it's free.
4084200	4085200	No, it's not worth it.
4085200	4089360	You pay in the time of your life that you spend, you will never get back.
4089360	4091840	You lose party for your soul after playing that game.
4091840	4093440	That's okay, I don't got much left.
4093440	4096860	In fact, I would like to actually open up our mailbag.
4096860	4100000	I would like to actually solicit- No, because I have to read that.
4100000	4102000	Well, too bad.
4102000	4103640	We got to make you work a little harder.
4103640	4107320	So I would like to solicit your best Yaris joke.
4107320	4108800	So I want to hear some Yaris.
4108800	4111120	It can be about the game, hell, it can be about the car, I don't care.
4111120	4112120	I was going to get one.
4112120	4114040	I want some Yaris jokes in the mailbag.
4114040	4117840	Not tonight, because we haven't gotten to the mailbag segment, we will, but for next
4117840	4121960	week's show, you know, as you guys are listening to the podcast later, I want some Yaris jokes.
4121960	4125280	Honestly though, how is this good advertising for the Yaris?
4125280	4130400	I mean, now when you associate Yaris, you're going to think, suck, I mean, that's not-
4130400	4133880	I wouldn't think that's a good thing that, you know, Yaris, oh yeah, that's right, that's
4133880	4137040	a, you know, car that had a crappy game made for it.
4137040	4141280	Or when I go shopping, and I like to see all the features of the Yaris, and they're like,
4141280	4145880	oh yes, well it has the built-in air conditioning and the GPS unit and the, you know, the leather
4145880	4146880	interior.
4146880	4149800	I'll be like, yes, but where is the tentacle gun?
4149800	4152000	Where's the giant death tentacle?
4152000	4156920	That the commercials and- Where the fuck did I come out from, the stupid tentacle thing?
4156920	4157920	That's weird.
4157920	4159640	Anyway, sorry, we need to move on with the news.
4159640	4160640	Sorry.
4160640	4161640	Can we please?
4161640	4162640	Yes, we may.
4162640	4163640	Please, please, please, please, please.
4163640	4164640	Yes, yes, yes, yes.
4164640	4167360	I'm very excited about Spore.
4167360	4171200	You know, we've always heard these things, like Spore is not going to be out until 2009,
4171200	4172200	holy shit.
4172200	4175880	Well, now they're saying that Spore is about six months away.
4175880	4176880	And how do we know that?
4176880	4180280	Because that's what Will Wright said to BBC's Radio 5.
4180280	4185080	Spore is in its final testing phases, and it's about six months away from release.
4185080	4186840	That's a rough date.
4186840	4190760	So it does kind of line up with the whole, we were thinking it wasn't going to be out
4190760	4193680	in April, or until April 2008 anyway.
4193680	4198440	So it kind of lines up with this, that it could be summer of 2008, you know, maybe late
4198440	4200040	spring is when you're going to see this game.
4200040	4201920	I would say it's probably going to be out summer of next year.
4201920	4203360	If it came out in April, that'd be perfect.
4203360	4209360	April is like the crappiest game for months, or game for the year, yeah, basically the
4209360	4210800	worst month for games.
4210800	4211980	So it's horrible.
4211980	4214800	It would definitely be a highlight in a low month.
4214800	4215800	Yeah.
4215800	4219440	Speaking of highlights, we love to read the emails from our listeners every week, don't
4219440	4220440	we, DarkSakura?
4220440	4221440	Yes, we do.
4221440	4222440	All right.
4222440	4225560	I had a gun to her head forcing her to say that.
4225560	4227960	No, we honestly do love hearing from the listeners.
4227960	4230120	We got some good emails this week, from what I understand.
4230120	4235800	So mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com is where you can send your emails.
4235800	4238720	And every week, DarkSakura jumps on in and pulls out a few of her favorites.
4238720	4241440	I don't think there's time to read them all tonight.
4241440	4242440	There's six.
4242440	4243440	Wow.
4243440	4244760	Well, let's get started.
4244760	4245760	Long segment tonight.
4245760	4250120	This one comes from Ace Savior, I guess.
4250120	4252600	He's an X instead of an S for Savior.
4252600	4255640	Hey guys, first I will admit that I am pretty new to the show.
4255640	4259960	I just found the show when I was looking for RSS feeds and podcasts on my PSP a couple
4259960	4260960	days ago.
4260960	4264360	I like the fact that you guys have a website made just for the PSP.
4264360	4266160	Sorry that I haven't updated it in years.
4266160	4267400	Too bad it never gets updated.
4267400	4268400	Hey.
4268400	4269400	Loki.
4269400	4274920	I was going to do OLRE and I kind of, I did not re-register the, our main website's all
4274920	4276960	kind of broken too, so anyway, whatever.
4276960	4281080	I really appreciate it, seeing as how my PSP is the closest thing I can get to a laptop
4281080	4282080	at the moment.
4282080	4286480	Anyway, even after only a few podcasts, I can honestly say this is the best video game
4286480	4290600	internet radio show ever and I'm looking forward to more podcasts to come.
4290600	4291600	Keep on gaming, guys.
4291600	4293160	And then he said I was hot.
4293160	4294160	Aww.
4294160	4295160	I'm not.
4295160	4298880	If there's something that happens to women when they get married, they lose their heart.
4298880	4299880	Oh, stop it.
4299880	4300880	Yeah.
4300880	4301880	Anyway.
4301880	4304320	You should see, I know DarkSakura's very shy, but you should see her outfit today.
4304320	4305320	She's very nice.
4305320	4307640	I'm wearing my pirate shirt that I got at Walmart.
4307640	4308640	I think it's cute.
4308640	4309640	With the skirt.
4309640	4310640	I like the skirt.
4310640	4314360	They sell the same shirt at Disneyland and it's a bright red and they charge 30 bucks
4314360	4318120	for it at Disneyland and I paid 12 at Walmart.
4318120	4319400	But what you're wearing today is darker.
4319400	4321740	It's Renaissance-y without being over the top.
4321740	4323120	It's Renaissance-y but modern.
4323120	4324120	If that makes sense.
4324120	4325960	I feel kind of like a rockabilly.
4325960	4327800	All right.
4327800	4328800	Anyhow.
4328800	4332280	Which actually ties into future news.
4332280	4333280	Super Arizona.
4333280	4334280	Ooh.
4334280	4335280	Next email.
4335280	4336280	Okay.
4336280	4340280	So, this one comes from Polinosis.
4340280	4341440	That's kind of a cool name.
4341440	4344160	I was reading this fascinating article the other day and I was wondering what you guys
4344160	4346880	think of this man's opinion and he also included a joke.
4346880	4349920	It says, why is the bicycle lying on its side?
4349920	4350920	Why?
4350920	4354840	Because it was too tired.
4354840	4360120	Cricket, cricket, cricket, cricket.
4360120	4362520	Did I accidentally invite jokes from the listeners last week?
4362520	4363520	I must have.
4363520	4365520	Good effort.
4365520	4370040	But, you know what?
4370040	4372960	This article is kind of long so instead what I'm going to do is I'm going to link it in
4372960	4373960	the chat room.
4373960	4374960	What's the topic?
4374960	4375960	I want to know if I read it.
4375960	4380000	It's about how reviews are phrased, I do believe so.
4380000	4385280	And saying, consider the following sentences.
4385280	4387120	This book has good book read.
4387120	4388740	This record has good record listen.
4388740	4391440	This movie has good movie watch.
4391440	4393080	This game has good game play, right?
4393080	4394080	Yes.
4394080	4395080	Uh-huh-huh.
4395080	4396080	Funny.
4396080	4409280	I do sort of understand that, like you could say it plays well, you know, but yeah, I kind
4409280	4417840	of in my attention to semantics I guess that I do sort of agree with that.
4417840	4420000	But we'll read it more and maybe respond to it next week.
4420000	4422000	I'm going to take that as a homework assignment.
4422000	4423600	I'm posting it in the chat room.
4423600	4424600	All right.
4424600	4426560	I'll take a look at it real quick.
4426560	4427560	Okay.
4427560	4429560	Ooh, Pirate Bay.
4429560	4433680	Anyway, moving forward.
4433680	4439280	We have one from Mark F. Says, hi Jamie.
4439280	4441920	And my name is spelled the other way, by the way, but that's okay.
4441920	4443880	You've been playing a lot of Ragnarok online.
4443880	4447040	I haven't confirmed, but I think R02 Beta is out.
4447040	4449080	Have you been playing that or the original RO?
4449080	4454160	So since you're an MMO girl, have you played World of Warcraft or Guild Wars?
4454160	4455160	Keep up the great work.
4455160	4456160	You guys are very entertaining.
4456160	4459560	I hope you bring back your extra guests from time to time.
4459560	4464240	Well, I know that the RO2 Beta was out in Korea and I tried to sign up for it, but they
4464240	4467320	needed me to sign up for like a social security number or some shit.
4467320	4468320	So I didn't do it.
4468320	4471740	However, it has been brought to my attention that the RO2 Beta is now out in the United
4471740	4478660	States and if my laptop is up to the task, I will be downloading that like a mofo and
4478660	4483760	playing it like crazy because I love Ragnarok, especially since it's a Beta, it'd have to
4483760	4484760	be free.
4484760	4485760	What?
4485760	4486760	Sorry.
4486760	4487760	Keep going.
4487760	4493120	So, um, to answer your question, yes, I played World of Warcraft and I have stopped playing
4493120	4496240	for World of Warcraft because number one, it's on my other computer and number two,
4496240	4498720	honestly, I didn't think it was that fun.
4498720	4503000	It was only fun if I was doing quests with like one other person.
4503000	4509080	Meanwhile, I spent Alltrack Valley weekend this weekend, racking up 6,800 honor points
4509080	4510400	so far.
4510400	4512720	I played Alltrack Valley a lot yesterday.
4512720	4515160	I have like 50 Alltrack Valley marks right now.
4515160	4517040	I do have a Guild Wars account.
4517040	4521600	It was purchased for me for my birthday, which I just got around to going through this whole
4521600	4525920	thing with NC, with the people at NCSoft are great.
4525920	4531940	They're just really on the ball and they've been able to replace my confirmation codes.
4531940	4537200	So I will be, hopefully sometime in the next week, getting back on Guild Wars.
4537200	4539140	I have a character that looks like the Doctor.
4539140	4541360	His name is John Smith.
4541360	4547400	I also have another character that was supposed to be in my friend's guild and she left the
4547400	4550520	guild so I have no idea what the hell's happening.
4550520	4555560	So I'll be on, you'll see me, I think.
4555560	4559120	And I also was thinking about getting into City of Heroes, but honestly, when do I have
4559120	4560120	the time?
4560120	4565960	Yeah, I played Rose online too.
4565960	4570400	One of my new friends, who I met through William, I believe is going to come on our show next
4570400	4574560	week and he's really into City of Heroes and the reason why I'm having him on next week
4574560	4577520	is he was in the Tabula Rasa beta, which is a game I'm pretty excited about.
4577520	4578520	I want to know more about it.
4578520	4579680	He was telling me about it.
4579680	4580680	It sounds really awesome.
4580680	4583800	He's going to show me the game this week to see if it's something I want to get into.
4583800	4588200	So we'll have him on next week probably and talking about some of the PC games we sometimes
4588200	4589200	overlook.
4589200	4591000	So I have another email from the same person.
4591000	4592000	Well, okay.
4592000	4593000	Okay.
4593000	4596120	Here are some of my comments for episode 252.
4596120	4598560	I love the 3D Street Fighter games.
4598560	4601560	It was a different playing style that made the Street Fighter characters almost real
4601560	4602560	because of the limitations.
4602560	4606000	I got tired of them jumping nine feet in the air and spinning around like tornadoes.
4606000	4608200	Sorry, you're alone in that one, buddy.
4608200	4613200	Well, at least he's not bringing up the motion capture game that was Street Fighter movie.
4613200	4615200	Oh, the movie, the game, or whatever?
4615200	4616200	Yeah.
4616200	4617200	True.
4617200	4621200	He has a better laptop sales and external USB D-pads controllers.
4621200	4624520	Keep up the great work.
4624520	4625800	Cool.
4625800	4629280	I liked the later EX games, honestly.
4629280	4633200	It was the first one that was kind of, well, bad.
4633200	4634400	But hey.
4634400	4640120	This one is from Spamoflauge, and I just think it has a cool name.
4640120	4641120	Bourgeois Daxacara.
4641120	4644680	Aw, that's French.
4644680	4648200	So here's my statement of the week, and I'd love to get your opinion since I consider
4648200	4649880	you as experts.
4649880	4653720	I've heard that Nintendo is selling lots of Wii systems, but no games.
4653720	4654720	Really?
4654720	4659520	What if occasional gamers turn out to be cheap bastards who don't buy games?
4659520	4660520	Three questions.
4660520	4661520	One, is my statement true?
4661520	4662760	Two, are Wii games not selling?
4662760	4665720	Three, where do you go to get the latest game sale figures?
4665720	4670800	I know I could just Google it, but I like hearing Dark Soccer read my emails.
4670800	4674160	Merci, Spamoflauge.
4674160	4680040	I know that you can find a lot of the sales sites out through Consumer Reports, too.
4680040	4685920	A lot of the new sites like Kotaku, what are the other ones?
4685920	4686920	Like Joystick and Destructo.
4686920	4692800	Yeah, they'll list game sales figures quarterly when they do the quarterly reports.
4692800	4696040	And then I also, a lot of my UK news I get from Eurogamer.
4696040	4697520	Loki, where do you get your sales figures?
4697520	4702000	Is that coming from your way of your internal sources at your day job?
4702000	4703000	NPD.
4703000	4704000	Oh.
4704000	4707680	So, when you talk about sales numbers on the show, is that numbers you're getting from
4707680	4708680	your work?
4708680	4712160	No, it's from NPD Group.
4712160	4714600	I had plenty of Wii games they're selling, trust me.
4714600	4719680	Maybe not all of the Wii games that they want, like I know Donkey Kong, Barrel Blast didn't
4719680	4725800	sell hotcakes, or maybe, I don't know.
4725800	4728840	But I imagine a lot of those Wii games, just based on what's out there, they're selling
4728840	4730160	to kids and families.
4730160	4734440	They're not necessarily selling to a hardcore gaming audience, which is probably why, when
4734440	4737400	you think about the Wii, you hear these things about, well, the Wii's selling, but the games
4737400	4738400	aren't.
4738400	4742800	Well, and also, a lot of people, they like Wii Sports, they're not going out and buying
4742800	4743800	other games.
4743800	4747520	A lot of stupid companies out there make games that are based off games and Wii Sports, like
4747520	4751400	bowling games and shit like that, and they're like, well, why is no one going to buy my
4751400	4752400	game?
4752400	4754640	Well, because their game comes for free with the system.
4754640	4759560	Also, there's a lot of games that are crappy ports of stuff, or just crappy controls and
4759560	4760560	whatever.
4760560	4761560	A lot of people get jaded by that.
4761560	4764880	It's like, well, shit, I don't know if I want to go spend $50 just to get a game that's
4764880	4766200	going to suck.
4766200	4769200	So maybe Wii buyers are a little more cautious.
4769200	4772760	Unfortunately, all the A-list titles on the Wii right now, too, are coming from Nintendo.
4772760	4777360	I can't think of a third-party, like, A or triple-A title on its way soon.
4777360	4781080	Sure, Chad will think of something, but I can't even think of anything.
4781080	4784960	Well, Manhunt 2, there's stuff from Capcom, Resident Evil, Umbrella Chronicles, Brothers
4784960	4785960	in Arms.
4785960	4786960	Okay, I'll give you Umbrella Chronicles.
4786960	4790000	Medal of Honor Heroes 2, it's going to be big.
4790000	4793680	Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3, from Atari.
4793680	4794680	I personally am not used to-
4794680	4795680	Magno 8.
4795680	4796680	Oh, okay, there you go.
4796680	4797680	Well, we'll see.
4797680	4798680	Mm.
4798680	4802160	Oh, Knights, says Gerardimo.
4802160	4803160	There you go.
4803160	4804160	Thank you.
4804160	4805160	Knights.
4805160	4806160	Okay, there you go.
4806160	4807720	Yeah, Beyonce, you may like Knights, but Knights, I don't think is going to be that
4807720	4808720	big of a game.
4808720	4810600	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
4810600	4813440	I am excited about Knights.
4813440	4815880	I think it's going to be fantastically huge.
4815880	4819100	I would totally believe, though, there's a lot of people just buying the Wii for Wii
4819100	4820280	Sports, and that's it.
4820280	4824000	There's a lot of families I bet are doing it, and totally fine with Wii Sports.
4824000	4825000	But you know what?
4825000	4828000	There are some companies that are getting smart about the games that they release, and
4828000	4833960	a lot of them are pre-budget games, like this AMF Bowling Pin Busters from Bethesda, I think.
4833960	4837100	I think it's Bethesda, I'm not sure.
4837100	4842440	It's coming out for 19 bucks, and it's a full-fledged bowling game for 20 bucks.
4842440	4846960	When I was younger, I was friends with a kid, and his family had a Nintendo, and they had
4846960	4851280	the Power Pad pack that had the triple game at Mario, Duck Hunt, and World Class Track
4851280	4853560	Meter, or whatever that game was that came with it.
4853560	4854940	That's all they had.
4854940	4856300	That's all they had.
4856300	4859160	And they played that stupid world-class thing all the time.
4859160	4860160	Exactly.
4860160	4862600	I mean, people like that shit.
4862600	4866000	Mario and Duck Hunt, I mean, what more do you need?
4866000	4867000	Seriously.
4867000	4868000	All right, sorry.
4868000	4869000	We can move on with emails now.
4869000	4873140	I'm actually reminded now that it's coming up about time that I have to start dusting
4873140	4874140	off the Saturn.
4874140	4876000	Why is that?
4876000	4878840	Christmas nights.
4878840	4883560	We've been about a year and a half, about two years out of our tradition, but we used
4883560	4891080	to, I've mentioned this before, but Dan and I bring out our Saturn every year and play
4891080	4894920	Christmas nights, and do the countdown right to Christmas.
4894920	4895920	Nice.
4895920	4898120	I love Christmas nights.
4898120	4899120	Anyway.
4899120	4901560	I love Christmas because I get presents.
4901560	4904560	My favorite holiday, though, is coming up in three days.
4904560	4905560	Halloween.
4905560	4906560	This is Halloween.
4906560	4908520	It's a religious holiday for me.
4908520	4909920	It's true.
4909920	4912160	It's a religious holiday.
4912160	4916040	Anyway, it's the end of the year.
4916040	4917680	So moving forward.
4917680	4923200	This one comes from Robert M. Two stupid things here.
4923200	4924760	This email, and no, I'm kidding.
4924760	4925760	I'm just teasing.
4925760	4930680	First of all, I'd like to, although I have participated in the fun myself, suggest that
4930680	4934420	we, after the whole Eye of Judgment bet is finished, drop the whole Loki as Tingle thing
4934420	4939000	and try something fresh, such as Loki as Murray the Hippo from Sly Cooper.
4939000	4940400	No idea why, just random.
4940400	4942080	I don't even know who the hell that is.
4942080	4944960	I know of the game, but I just don't know who that character is.
4944960	4949360	You know, I want to agree with this statement that maybe after the bet is lost, because
4949360	4952840	we all know it will be, that thing ain't selling a million units, that maybe we ought to drop
4952840	4954440	the whole Loki as Tingle thing.
4954440	4957640	I don't know, there's a part of me that says it's just never going to go away, like the
4957640	4959240	whole Death Cake.
4959240	4963800	Just because I did the voice one time, and I don't even remember how the voice was.
4963800	4969520	Seriously, how many years ago did Loki play Karaoke Revolution live on air?
4969520	4973840	It has scared him from doing karaoke permanently for the rest of his life.
4973840	4974840	That's the effect this show has.
4974840	4979120	No, it's just that we tried to duplicate the funny of it, and it's just you can't.
4979120	4981560	Yeah, the second time is never as good as the first.
4981560	4985280	Just like if Loki does actually have to dress up as Tingle for whatever reason, it will
4985280	4986480	only happen once.
4986480	4990680	Only then will we drop it, because we know now that if he does it again, it's just going
4990680	4991920	to be some weirdo in a suit.
4991920	4997600	I think that it's more fun to speculate, and then once, okay, what was that story written
4997600	4998600	by...
4998600	5002480	Oh god, no, I can't think of the guy who wrote The Great Gatsby.
5002480	5003480	F. Scott...
5003480	5004480	Yes, thank you.
5004480	5005480	Fitzgerald?
5005480	5006480	Was that his name?
5006480	5007480	Yes.
5007480	5008480	Okay.
5008480	5011640	He's the girl who said she was going to cut her hair, she's going to cut her hair, and
5011640	5015080	she's suddenly Miss Popular, and everyone loves her, and then when she does cut her
5015080	5020040	hair, everyone's like, oh, and then she leaves.
5020040	5023360	But seriously, he's going to set Eye of Judgment on fire.
5023360	5024360	That's going to be awesome.
5024360	5026360	That'll be fantastic.
5026360	5028160	I just made a classic literature reference.
5028160	5030560	I will fucking dance around and set an Eye of Judgment on fire.
5030560	5033000	I won't wear a suit.
5033000	5034000	That's okay.
5034000	5038960	So, to continue with this email, before we get all tangenty again.
5038960	5039960	Sorry.
5039960	5041520	Night of tangents tonight.
5041520	5046480	Second, I ran into someone I know who owns a DS Lite but isn't happy with the current
5046480	5051040	titles out there, and he told me, out of nowhere, that Nintendo should fire their game designers,
5051040	5052200	all of them.
5052200	5055480	When I asked why, he said that the company was following the bandwagon of rock band and
5055480	5061680	guitar hero and coming out with a game in which you strum a guitar and play chords,
5061680	5063720	which he considers to be just stupid.
5063720	5076440	Now, I don't care whether you don't like music games or whether you simply think a portable
5076440	5079880	guitar game simply wouldn't work compared to having the actual instrument hardware.
5079880	5083520	I can only think of two games right now that he could be talking about and to suggest that
5083520	5087840	Nintendo flat out abandoned over 20 years of first party development that is arguably
5087840	5092440	the only reason the company still has support because a different game developer on a completely
5092440	5096680	different continent is publishing a game that he doesn't care for on their system seems
5096680	5099560	dangerously ignorant and selfish to me.
5099560	5100560	Just venting, I guess.
5100560	5104960	Yeah, you need to fire your friend.
5104960	5109560	I think that you should point this out to your friend and go, now how do you feel?
5109560	5110800	No, here it is.
5110800	5114440	No, I don't think you should fire your friend, but your friend is misinformed on one huge
5114440	5115440	thing.
5115440	5117720	It sounds like your friend is assuming Nintendo makes all these decisions.
5117720	5118720	They don't.
5118720	5122680	When Nintendo makes the system, developers buy the kits to make games.
5122680	5127760	It's up to them what games they want to make, so when they make all these Imagine Babies
5127760	5132600	and whatever games are made, that's not Nintendo going, gosh, we really need someone to develop
5132600	5134040	a baby sim for our system.
5134040	5137680	No, they just kind of turn it loose out there, which in my mind is a good thing because a
5137680	5140360	lot of great ideas come from these third party developers.
5140360	5145880	Unfortunately, a lot of shitty ideas and cheap knockoffs come from them as well, but the
5145880	5149120	other problem is I would not call, I'm assuming the games he's referring to there are like
5149120	5153720	Jam Sessions and the Hannah Montana game, I would not call those knockoffs.
5153720	5154720	They're different.
5154720	5156440	I don't know.
5156440	5158360	Just because they all have music in common does not make them common.
5158360	5161280	Different is not necessarily bad.
5161280	5162560	Yeah.
5162560	5166040	So, your friend unfortunately is a little bit misinformed.
5166040	5167040	Hater!
5167040	5168040	Your friend's a hater.
5168040	5169040	Okay, I'm done.
5169040	5170040	All done with emails?
5170040	5171040	No more.
5171040	5172540	I said there were six.
5172540	5173540	I can't count tonight.
5173540	5174540	How many have we done?
5174540	5175540	Five?
5175540	5176540	Six.
5176540	5177540	Oh, we've done six?
5177540	5178540	Yes.
5178540	5179540	And we're done.
5179540	5180540	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
5180540	5186000	This segment is pushing an hour thirty, so let's wrap it up really quickly with a couple
5186000	5187000	more stories.
5187000	5188000	Loki.
5188000	5189000	All right.
5189000	5195560	Anyways, as most people in the US know, there's a lot of fire going on in the LA area there
5195560	5202360	and now of course wildfires in the San Diego area have forced Midway to evacuate their
5202360	5208320	San Diego office, but fear not, that will not delay Stranglehold any longer.
5208320	5213320	Actually most of the development happens in other places.
5213320	5218280	I think it's just their corporate office.
5218280	5223440	Don't worry, your Strangleholds and Unreal Tournament won't be delayed any further.
5223440	5228440	Well, Unreal Tournament might, but Stranglehold at least won't be.
5228440	5234080	That's a real shame what happened there with those fires and gosh, I hope none of our listeners,
5234080	5236920	I imagine some of our listeners had to have been affected by it.
5236920	5239200	I mean, they evacuated what, like a million people?
5239200	5243120	And that whole process of being evacuated is no fun at all.
5243120	5244720	I don't know how many y'all had to go through it.
5244720	5247600	I know when we had some bad flooding where I grew up, we got evacuated once.
5247600	5248600	This is scary.
5248600	5249600	The whole thing's scary.
5249600	5254200	And I hope, just in general, whether they were our listeners or not, just all those
5254200	5256680	people that lost their homes just going on like fires.
5256680	5257680	This is so sad.
5257680	5259400	I'm really sorry to hear it.
5259400	5267880	Anyhow, let's go back to games before we get too depressing here and talk about Netflix.
5267880	5271400	And Netflix is kind of trying to set their eyes on the future.
5271400	5275080	Of course, Netflix has really kind of turned themselves into the current right now.
5275080	5279680	I mean, hell, Ma and Pa video stores and even now Hollywood video is really being impacted
5279680	5282800	by some would say Netflix has been a huge part of this.
5282800	5289320	Well, Netflix has made an interesting comment and it came from the CEO, Reed Hastings.
5289320	5296600	And he said he's interested in enabling Netflix through, quote, Internet-connected game consoles.
5296600	5301000	So very interesting that Netflix kind of wants to put their feelers out there on what they
5301000	5302420	can do.
5302420	5307680	The other thing that should be noted about this is that back in March, Hastings actually
5307680	5309800	is now on the board of Microsoft.
5309800	5316720	So you kind of go, hmm, could this mean that a Microsoft Netflix deal is in the cards?
5316720	5322680	I hope so because I think the way the Xbox Live marketplace is set up now is not very
5322680	5325160	friendly to movies and finding movies.
5325160	5328800	However, Netflix, on the other hand, has an awesome system to find movies and has the
5328800	5329800	whole friends thing and everything.
5329800	5333020	I think Xbox Live is kind of clunky when it comes to their movie downloads.
5333020	5335960	So I think a partnership could be a step up for them.
5335960	5340680	That's a little bit of fanboyism and dreaming there, I think, in a sense.
5340680	5344600	That is a really big step because Microsoft kind of, they may think they don't need
5344600	5345600	Netflix.
5345600	5350000	You know, I talk about this every week and I probably sound like a broken record, but
5350000	5356120	Sony is going to have to step up really quick or a few major announcements and they're
5356120	5357120	going to be screwed.
5357120	5361400	I mean, a lot of stuff is going to happen too quick.
5361400	5365520	Microsoft already has a pretty strong download service for movies and stuff.
5365520	5370040	And if you add Netflix to that as well, where you can be able to pay a subscription per
5370040	5376760	month and download as much shit as you want, that's kind of scary.
5376760	5381600	I know Sony is talking about doing something as far as a download service, but they're
5381600	5382920	kind of behind.
5382920	5383920	But we don't know.
5383920	5386720	I mean, just because it's on the board of Microsoft doesn't mean that maybe Netflix
5386720	5390760	teams up with Sony and that could be a huge boost for Sony, who seems to be finding the
5390760	5394040	majority of their success right now as being a Blu-ray player.
5394040	5395720	It would actually be really good for them.
5395720	5398200	So we'll see if it happens.
5398200	5399200	Who knows?
5399200	5404480	Anyhow, it's about time we bring this segment to a close because we've been here for a
5404480	5405480	while now.
5405480	5410360	But before we bring this segment to a close, we have to wrap up by paying a little respect
5410360	5411360	to our elders.
5411360	5415700	And we like to do that through Dark Sakura's classic game of the week.
5415700	5420840	So Dark Sakura, why don't you tell us what game you picked for this week?
5420840	5424400	And I'm actually curious, because it's Halloween week, did you pick something a little Halloween
5424400	5425400	themed for us?
5425400	5431120	Sort of, but actually I was more paying tribute to the release of Dracula X Chronicles.
5431120	5435280	So I was picking one of my favorite games in the Castlevania series, which would be
5435280	5436280	Kid Dracula.
5436280	5438760	Oh, okay, Kid Dracula.
5438760	5445480	It was released in Japan as Akumajo Special Boku Dracula-kun, which translates to Demon
5445480	5450140	Castle Special, I'm Dracula-kun.
5450140	5455240	He's playing as Alucard, pretty much, only he's Kid Dracula in the game.
5455240	5461520	And it's all super cute, and he has some of the powers that he had in Symphony of the
5461520	5462520	Night.
5462520	5468280	Actually, the major bad guy in this game ended up being an enemy in Symphony of the Night.
5468280	5472440	So I love how they just tie in everything, I think it was really great.
5472440	5478780	But it's a fun little kid type platformer, it came out on the Famicom in Japan, also
5478780	5485280	on the Game Boy, and over here we got it on the Game Boy.
5485280	5489920	I actually own this game, I'm very happy.
5489920	5498160	It has the first level music, I don't know if you can hear it very well.
5498160	5506760	Let me wait for it to get to the part.
5506760	5510160	I missed this game when I was growing up, I never played this.
5510160	5513320	We didn't get it in America, we got it on Game Boy.
5513320	5516480	Oh yeah, I was going to say, I remember it on Game Boy, I remember it seeing it somewhere.
5516480	5527200	Yeah, but this is a remix of Beginning from Castlevania III, if anyone recognizes it.
5527200	5532920	The other cool thing about this game is that, and I love how Kami does this, is that Kid
5532920	5540040	Dracula was also a playable character in Gokujo Parodius, which I thought was pretty cool,
5540040	5545080	and he was also a hidden selectable character in Jiki o Shiberi Parodius, which is actually
5545080	5546240	my favorite of the Parodius series.
5546240	5552960	Well I also love chatting Parodius too, so I'll be covering the Parodius series somewhat
5552960	5553960	later.
5553960	5554960	Oh look, it has like the clocks.
5554960	5559320	Yeah, you go in the clock tower and everything, it has a lot of the classic levels that you
5559320	5565640	expect in the old Castlevania games, but it was so cute.
5565640	5570480	It actually was kind of hard, it got really difficult at times, just like you have the
5570480	5572320	swinging pendulum and everything too.
5572320	5577120	Very cool, a chat room is joining in on this, Escapist says, Kid Dracula made using an umbrella
5577120	5579960	as a weapon badass long before Kirby gave it a shot.
5579960	5580960	Yep.
5580960	5583600	Son of Dad says the music sounds very upbeat for a Castlevania game.
5583600	5590840	Well it was more of a parody style game, but it was actually pretty good for how it played,
5590840	5591840	I loved it.
5591840	5597680	I mean, we're talking about one of my top 20 games, I have to say.
5597680	5598680	Wow.
5598680	5602720	It has those little things that spin when you jump on them, lots of throwbacks to the
5602720	5603720	cast.
5603720	5604720	And the bridge?
5604720	5605720	Shoot.
5605720	5613440	This was actually a staple of my Game Boy collection for the longest time, and I really
5613440	5617560	can't say too many good things about it, it really was very fun.
5617560	5622480	Plus I just love his little expression the whole time, he has this like, toothy grin
5622480	5624320	the entire time.
5624320	5632120	I'm going to paste a copy of the logo in the chat room, just because it was adorable.
5632120	5636400	I'm going to post the one off of Wikipedia.
5636400	5640160	Gerardimo says Polka makes umbrella weapons best.
5640160	5643400	That's a Turtle Sonata reference right there.
5643400	5644400	Why is he fighting here?
5644400	5645400	A Klansman?
5645400	5646400	Oh my god, it is!
5646400	5647400	Like he has a swastika on his head!
5647400	5651120	I swear to god, look at his boss, he's fighting here at the end of stage one.
5651120	5652760	Look at this.
5652760	5653760	He's got a little swastika on his head.
5653760	5657680	I think it's supposed to be like, I don't think it's supposed to be Shaft, isn't it?
5657680	5660640	It looks like a Klansman!
5660640	5663720	That's crazy.
5663720	5664720	Maybe this is a...
5664720	5666200	Doing his part for racial equality.
5666200	5668840	I guess so, he made the Klansman cry and run away.
5668840	5671400	I'm hitting him too much, there you go.
5671400	5672400	Interesting.
5672400	5676640	Alright, so there you have it, Kid Dracula, your game of the week.
5676640	5677640	Yep.
5677640	5681440	And I'm probably one of these days going to cover Proteus, and I always say I'm going
5681440	5682440	to.
5682440	5683440	Don't give it away!
5683440	5685280	I didn't say when, I said eventually.
5685280	5686520	Now you're here next week, right?
5686520	5690280	You're still here next week, but it's two weeks that you leave for Alabama?
5690280	5694360	No, I leave, I'm actually taking a red eye on Thanksgiving.
5694360	5695360	Gotcha.
5695360	5697320	Okay, okay, so it's going to be a little later in the month.
5697320	5702360	I just wanted to warn the listeners, be careful, because when Dark Soccer is out of town, you're
5702360	5703360	done.
5703360	5704360	I'm going to record my game of the week.
5704360	5705560	Oh, you're going to record it?
5705560	5707640	I thought we got to pick, in your absence.
5707640	5708640	Ah, I'm sneaky.
5708640	5709640	You are sneaky.
5709640	5711640	What would you pick?
5711640	5715400	I would definitely go back to the Commodore 64 and dust something off from those archives.
5715400	5716400	I don't know yet.
5716400	5717400	I don't want to spoil it.
5717400	5718800	I do have a game in mind, right here.
5718800	5722680	If you're going to go in that direction, then how could I deny anybody that?
5722680	5723680	Alright.
5723680	5724680	Heart.
5724680	5725680	Ugh.
5725680	5726680	Alright.
5726680	5727960	Loki, on the other hand, I have no idea what he'd pick.
5727960	5730160	He'll pick Gals Panic or something.
5730160	5731640	I would not pick Gals Panic.
5731640	5732640	Or Miss World.
5732640	5733640	Dude.
5733640	5734640	I would not pick.
5734640	5735640	I would not pick that.
5735640	5736640	That's stupid.
5736640	5737640	Everybody move your body.
5737640	5741000	Rob made the heart and I threw out the horns.
5741000	5744960	Alright, anyhow, we really need to take a break here, because we were pushing almost
5744960	5747760	an hour forty now, so we still have half the show to go.

5755120	5756120	No.
5756120	5757120	I have to pee.
5757120	5758120	We are never covering Chill Einige.
5758120	5759120	Alright.
