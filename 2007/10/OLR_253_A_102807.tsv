13878	19980	Tonight, October 28, 2007, a 360 Fall Update feature may have been leaked, Smash Bros.
20000	24462	lets you share instant replays, and could Myspace be the next great gaming outlet?
32401	36344	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36384	40487	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
40547	41708	My name is Rob Roberts.
41788	44611	Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura.
45111	45411	Yo.
45711	46632	How you doing, DarkSakura?
47293	47713	Been better.
48153	48914	Well, sorry to hear.
49514	51456	But you know, we have good days and not so good days.
51956	52136	Yep.
52417	53838	I'm having a not so good day as well.
54879	55759	I'll tell you about that in a moment.
55779	57841	I have a beer now and that makes everything better.
58208	59968	I have Fiji water and that makes things okay.
60969	63089	Let me – I said now I dropped the cap.
63129	64369	Now everything sucks again.
64389	64969	I hate my life.
65810	66810	Don't cry, Emo Rob.
67370	69210	Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
69410	69570	Hello.
69590	70791	How are you doing, Loki?
71091	71431	Doing fine.
71751	73311	Doing better than myself and DarkSakura?
73891	74251	Probably.
74511	79412	Well, here's what happened is that I kind of stage dived last night but not on purpose.
80272	82893	Those of you guys have been listening – Oh, that's all right.
83053	83313	I'll live.
83720	96333	Those of you guys who have been listening to the show for a long time know that I'm involved with theatrical production of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, which is so different from what we do here on Orange Launch Radio, but we all have a variety of different likes and stuff, right?
98360	104622	Last night was the big Halloween show, and I was performing the criminologist role, which is what I usually do for them now when I'm not emceeing the show.
105262	111444	And right at the end, I was dressed up in my Halloween garb, and my costume this year is Jack Skellington.
111704	116325	I'll have to go get my mask for the operator 11 people a little later so they can see, because it's actually a pretty rad costume.
116625	119226	But I was dressed up as Jack Skellington, but the problem was I had that mask on.
119566	123887	So as I was starting to exit the stage, I was walking down the steps, which have no handrail, mind you.
123927	125688	It's about six steps to get from the top to the bottom.
126108	128790	The MC for the night was running up the steps the other way.
129091	130252	Well, so I started to walk down.
130292	131673	I put my right foot on the first step.
131713	134575	I put my left foot down where there was no step.
135236	138198	So I tumbled and fell, and it was really bad.
139079	140880	Luckily, I didn't break a bone, so it could have been worse.
140920	149847	But basically, I landed in kind of like this pretzel shape, and I basically kicked my shoe dug in to the upper part of my thigh.
150208	154271	And I would show you on the webcam, except that might be indecent because it's right next to my booty.
155264	157705	No webcam scars on that one.
157965	163207	But I also didn't... I skinned my knee, too, which kind of... This does not deserve happy music.
163227	164327	Why is happy music playing?
164947	165707	It's trying to cheer you up.
165747	166288	It's not a happy event.
167288	168248	It's saying, don't cry, Rob.
168668	170669	It's saying, Rob... Bad news over happy music.
171189	174250	It's saying, Rob, next time remember to hit the stop button when the intro's done.
174690	179012	Anyway, so that's why I'm a little bit in a foul mood tonight, because I'm in pain.
179972	180452	Ooh, do you have...
181451	182212	Drugs for me?
182532	182873	I do.
182973	184355	I'm going to give you three of them.
184715	184975	Awesome.
185276	188560	Well, let's talk about... You want some Vicodin too?
188620	189581	No, I don't want Vicodin.
189601	190843	Vicodin will make me very sleepy.
190883	191143	All right.
192591	193831	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
216187	225154	and I played a little Guitar Hero 3 today and my dumb butt husband, I love my husband to death but man, I'm mad at him.
225634	227956	He was supposed to bring me Super Mario Galaxy on Thursday.
229277	229777	He didn't.
231198	238304	I cried because the game's not out for a little while and usually when the demos from Nintendo come, they're full versions.
239484	244746	I was going to say, that's what I heard, is that the demo at GameStop and GameCrazy right now is the full version.
245186	248128	Yeah, and he was supposed to bring it home so that I could play it for great justice.
248428	249728	It's only a couple weeks away.
250028	250469	I don't care.
251409	251709	Want.
253210	253690	Do want.
253710	254310	I'm impatient.
256031	257131	It's my right as a woman.
257471	262813	I'm thinking of modding my Wii to have a mod chip on it.
263554	267095	You know, for just modding stuff, not for piracy or anything.
267115	268956	You should put a spoiler on it and lower it
270424	271625	It can't get much lower.
271645	273907	I mean, it's like the width of three DVDs.
274607	276989	You know, cases at least, but I don't know.
278651	279071	Eh, whatever.
280773	281113	Alright.
281613	284175	So, no Super Mario Galaxy for DarkSakura this week.
284235	284736	Sorry to hear it.
285196	285737	Sad face.
286277	286958	How about Ragnarok?
286978	288539	You still been active on the RagnarKrak?
289039	291161	Oh, yeah, and I have a new obsession in that game.
291702	292282	What's that, pray tell?
292302	293383	Buying old blue boxes.
294124	299428	Because you get something random every time, and sometimes you get something really great, and sometimes you get, like, crap, like, you know...
299967	302068	Don't ask for heel, please
329606	331587	Hey, I don't play support classes, okay?
331707	333708	The closest I come to support is when I'm playing a dancer.
334649	334729	Nice.
334749	337411	And that's just so, you know, she can walk around like a hoochie with a whip.
338732	339092	For fun.
339332	339633	For fun.
340073	341014	I've got a gunslinger, though.
341034	341514	He's pretty cool.
341954	342795	He's wearing a pimp hat.
343715	343976	Alright.
344316	345337	But, yeah, that's about it.
345777	347238	Alright, well, Loki, how was your gaming week?
347898	348999	My gaming week was okay.
349059	353282	It didn't play as much as I thought I would be, but I bought a copy of...
354827	370111	since basically I was too lazy to cancel my pre-order for Ratchet & Clank Future Tools of Destruction so now I have a copy of it and I haven't played it yet because I took the shrink wrap off of it and I'm like, ooh, case!
370651	373732	And put it down on the coffee table and went on my way doing other things.
375213	380494	I watched Nelly play Excite Truck because she's like, hey, I want to play Excite Truck again, so...
381778	383479	There's... She's back into that again.
383499	386042	It's nice to see someone showing the Wii a little love once in a while.
386422	388163	Dude, Excite Truck is awesome.
388564	391766	And it seriously is the best Wii game, I think.
392487	393668	And I don't give a shit about Zelda.
393728	394989	I don't give a shit about Metroid.
395369	396650	Excite Truck is where it's at.
397811	400473	If not the best game on the console, it's definitely the best racing game.
400934	401694	So, whatever.
402635	407019	Anyways, I did play some Halo 3 multiplayer last night.
407119	407739	That was kind of fun.
407779	409601	We went to a Halloween party and so we did
410256	413177	Split Screen, and Live Multiplayer, and that was fun.
415098	419499	And then I played some Orange Box, played more Portal.
420419	424120	I've been playing more Conan, and that's an okay game.
424520	431883	It'll be fun to play through it, but then after that, I won't be playing anymore after that.
432943	438665	And then on the PSP, I've been playing more of the Jackass game, so I can finish it and delete it.
439205	439425	I mean,
439986	464410	sell it back, and, um, then, what else, um, oh, Guitar Hero 3, I tried a little bit of that, and it's, you know, Guitar Hero, I mean, fuck, there's not really much I can say about it, it's not like innovative or anything, it's just, um, I broke my guitar, because, um, you know, a lot of people might not remember, um, our Op 11 show that we did last week, um,
465453	472096	We showed that my guitar had the orange and blue buttons out of order on there for some reason, which is weird.
472596	473776	So I tried to fix it.
475017	475757	I fixed it fine.
475797	477057	I took it apart just fine.
478518	492663	Unfortunately, it's designed slightly different than, say, the retail Guitar Hero 3 guitars because in the retail ones you're able to take off the entire top of the guitar so you can change faceplates and whatnot.
492783	494624	Well, the wired version of it
495523	496203	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
523257	527578	Let me read some comments real quick to our Gaming Weeks and use this opportunity to introduce the chat room.
527898	530719	We always tape live on Sunday night, and that allows us to interact with our listeners.
530839	534260	Chat.orangelawntrader.com is the place to be Sunday at 6 p.m.
534280	535141	Pacific when we tape.
535841	536161	Let's see.
536241	542083	So we have JAP28 wants to know, why not just paint them, Loki, in regards to the switch buttons?
542183	545364	Because it wasn't that hard to take them apart to switch out the buttons.
545424	548025	It's just that it's not designed to be taken apart.
548325	548665	You know, the...
549107	550048	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
571414	575776	Faceplate on it, when I was putting it back together the first time, we wouldn't have this issue, it would be fine.
576036	577557	It's just, you know, who cares?
577657	579698	It's just, I've got another guitar already.
580058	586260	I don't play multiplayer at my house, and when I do, it's only going to be in Rock Band anyways, so, whatever.
586641	589762	And yes, I do like to tinker with stuff, as Blaze says in the chatroom.
591082	596885	Gerardimo comments in our chatroom, Well, Loki, Excite Truck is up against the other launch racing game, and that's really it.
597875	599796	There was more than just the one launch game.
599836	605497	I mean, there was Need for Speed Carbon, there was the crappy GT racing game, Monster 4x4 World Circuit.
606637	609318	And were any of those games particularly memorable?
609518	611279	No, I played all of them and they sucked.
611739	614580	Especially the Monster 4x4 World Circuit and GT.
615800	617220	Excite Truck was awesome.
617540	620321	The problem is the company that's making it doesn't really make anything else.
620421	627243	All they do is make racing games and before that it was some NASCAR heat game or something like that, but
628746	629226	Get on it!
629266	630086	Make Excite Truck 2!
630346	630786	Come on!
630886	632367	I mean, seriously, just more of the same.
632407	633727	You don't need to fucking innovate it.
634107	635247	It was fine the way it was.
635527	641308	It just needed to be longer, have more tracks, maybe some downloadable stuff once Nintendo figures out this whole download service or whatever.
641648	642729	You know, that would be kind of cool.
643229	651390	But, um, until then, you know, I'm trying to play every other racing game on the platform to see if there's something sort of similar to, you know, Excite Truck.
651790	653411	Then, of course, Mario Kart's gonna be awesome.
653431	654391	But that's a different type of game.
654431	654791	I mean, that's...
656337	657358	Nelly's not going to like that game.
658480	667190	Going back to DarkSakura's Gaming Week in chat, Shadowslyer says, first thing I install after I get Windows, freaking Ragnarok, and it's all thanks to OLR.
667771	668993	It's because it's crack.
670014	670575	Ragnacrack.
671035	671255	Yep.
671456	671856	All right.
672957	674940	Let's see, my Gaming Week, if you're all finished, Loki.
676155	676816	Think I'm done.
702737	704018	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
729179	756032	and I don't know if that's because of a some type of like up ramping in the difficulty curve but I noticed that like the king this time in a lot of the stages the big trick is that the king wants you to grab all of a certain item for instance there's one level where he wants you to grab Japanese things so you have to roll up as much sushi and you know fireworks and flags as you can that are Japanese or there's one level where you're supposed to roll up nothing but hot things which was kind of a cool level there wasn't anything like that in the last game but um
757137	760180	Actually, there was something like that in the last game.
760200	761962	Yeah, there was the big fireball, huh?
761982	762543	The campfire.
762723	763303	That's right.
763624	766246	So see, a lot of it kind of seems like we've sort of seen it before.
767327	767928	But here's the thing.
768208	772973	I will collect all of that item, and then the king is like, well, your Katamari sucks.
773413	778799	Even though I got it the size you wanted, everything's like, wow, your Katamari sucks, and it needs more of this item.
779339	779960	And you're kind of like,
780427	781708	Dude, was this game bug tested?
781728	782929	It needs more Cowbell.
783049	785231	Do I really just suck this bad at Katamari?
785251	788773	You just need to say when he asks you to do stuff, you're like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, roll over stuff.
788833	790054	That's all I do, you know.
790434	792336	Except for the fire thing, because you have to be real careful with that.
792436	793937	Otherwise, you'll keep failing.
793957	795879	Yeah, that's how I beat the stages now.
795899	800322	I was trying to be careful in the beginning, but I do feel like the difficulty curve went up a little bit in this game.
801042	807327	Because if you think about it, each level that's themed after something like Japanese or whatever, they're going to have tons of that item everywhere.
807847	809929	So all you have to do is just roll over everything.
810310	811851	And the majority of it will be that item.
812051	813052	And your Katamari OBV.
813452	817575	So I'm sorry, Katamari fans, but this one's the worst game in the series so far.
817735	820577	Honestly, the only reason I would suggest... Yeah, I would play the PSP version.
821037	822258	Well, yeah.
822418	828481	The only way I would suggest picking this game up is if you don't have a PlayStation 2, which I can't imagine there's that many people.
828501	829302	I mean, I know there's somebody.
829322	830283	We're going to get an email from somebody.
830843	834886	But I can't imagine there's that many people that only own a 360 that don't own a PlayStation 2.
834966	838768	And honestly, just go back and play the first and second games again because they're superior.
840043	840504	I'm sorry.
841064	844168	Yeah, I know there's Xbox Live modes, but they're kind of shiny.
844729	844949	Yeah.
845390	849054	And then there's this whole downloadable content, which takes me on another rant for a moment.
849835	856444	And this is a call to all the other bloggers and podcasters and media types that might listen to this program.
857432	865940	You know how the downloadable content on this game has been discovered to simply be another unlock key for items that are already on the disc.
866361	867862	And it's not like we haven't seen this before.
867962	870765	I mean, Dance Dance Revolution Universe comes to mind.
870805	871205	We had that.
871225	872166	Can you think of any others, Loki?
873528	878112	Need for Speed, like practically every EA game with the unlockable cheats and stuff.
878412	882036	We need to no longer call this downloadable content because it's not.
882600	882980	DarkSakura.com
901892	904913	Car Key, you know, this is a download key, whatever.
904973	906493	That makes sense to me to call it that.
906653	911695	So, from here on out, on this show, when we discover things like this, we're no longer going to refer to it as downloadable content.
911755	916356	When we talk about it, review it on the show, it will now be referred to as pay-to-unlock content, because that's what it is.
916936	922178	Now, downloadable content, actual downloadable content in my mind would be something like Elder Scrolls Oblivion.
922338	926779	The characters in Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
928079	929440	and you weren't just downloading a key for that?
929460	932603	I think that you were actually downloading the full characters.
932763	933463	See, that's the hard thing.
933483	935625	Because they had to release a new version that already had them in it.
935685	936466	That's true, that's true.
936987	942411	That's going to be the hard thing about this is that game companies are not up front with this information usually.
942652	945574	Well, they prefer it to be seamless to the customer.
945814	950438	We're just this tiny little show in somebody's spare bedroom, independently run.
950498	954182	But I'm putting a call out there to all the bigger folks who might happen to listen to this program.
955007	958249	I think we need to start asking developers when they announce this content.
958609	961832	Is this downloadable content or is this pay to unlock content?
962352	967055	I'm not saying pay to unlock content is necessarily a bad thing, but let's call it what it is.
968430	974434	Let's not, you know, if you're going to do it this way, I think the consumers have a right to know what it is that they're buying.
974774	975294	And you know what?
975815	978676	I still bought the pay-to-unlock content in the realm of DDR.
978756	980377	I bought the song pack.
980738	981918	It's not going to stop me from buying it.
981938	987702	I'm not saying we have to boycott all pay-to-unlock content, but I think we should be fair and call it what it is, pay-to-unlock content.
988763	989303	So there you have it.
990464	995967	And that even gets to the whole thing of why the fuck is it locked in anyways and why –
996394	996935	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1018800	1019120	I don't know.
1019140	1019961	It's a little bit janky to me.
1019981	1032292	I can understand if you're saying, you know, in those EA games or whatever, where you want to cheat and say, okay, I want to unlock the cheat codes or something like that, and I don't want to play through the game, I'm just going to buy them.
1032612	1035195	Okay, well, that's fine if you want to do that, because that's your choice.
1035695	1043302	But it's stuff that's in the game, which I think Katamaru was too short anyways, and the fact that there was more levels in there, that's kind of funny.
1043709	1056692	I think that's why this one particularly stings and why we need to put our foot down with this one because I think a lot of people feel, even for considering it was a $40 game and not a $60 game, it was still a little too short.
1057252	1062874	And to have those unlock codes come out not even a week after the game is out is a little bit of a punch to the gut.
1064054	1064274	Right?
1064434	1066354	Yeah, it's just like all the DDR unlock songs.
1066374	1067235	That's stupid too.
1067975	1070355	But I understand why they do that because the licensing stuff.
1070535	1073316	Yet, at the same time, I also think that they could probably, you know,
1073886	1077408	Bundling the licensing cost into the game.
1077628	1082810	Because I don't think that five extra songs are really going to cost five extra dollars or something like that.
1083950	1088532	OLArmyBlaze asks, is the $5 horse armor downloadable or unlock content?
1088773	1090093	It's downloadable.
1090233	1094175	I mean, granted, it's shitty downloadable content, but it is downloadable content.
1096280	1102569	I'm not saying that downloadable content... There's a perfect example of where downloadable content may not actually be better than pay-to-unlock content.
1102889	1105613	But I'm just saying, let the consumer know what it really is they're spending their money on.
1105653	1107976	Here's the other thing that people also forget, and...
1109494	1117535	It's pretty easy to forget it, but if you go to retail kiosks, a lot of this downloadable content that costs you money, like themes and stuff, is actually available for free.
1117615	1120496	If you bring your memory unit, and you can download it straight off there.
1120516	1126157	I remember when Saints Row came out, they had some downloadable clothes or something that you could get for it, and it was all free on there.
1126357	1131218	It cost you money on live, but it was free from the retail kiosks.
1131338	1132758	So that's another option, too.
1132838	1135098	Get one of those memory units and check it every now and then.
1135438	1138719	That's what they're trying to do, but they don't advertise that shit, which is annoying.
1139898	1144140	So, from here on out, we'll start on this show, calling it what it is.
1144420	1148142	And I beg of the OL Army and the listeners of this program, spread the word.
1148562	1149463	Let's get it out there.
1149523	1153765	Let's put our foot down as gamers and demand the developers call their releases what they are.
1154205	1157307	And that whole microtransactions thing, we'll save that for another day.
1157327	1159588	Because then you're getting into a whole other ballgame.
1160788	1163390	Anyhow, that's really pretty much it for my gaming week.
1163430	1165031	Well, I did play some of the Xbox Live.
1165071	1167952	I guess I should say real quickly, I did play some of the Xbox Live Arcade games.
1168507	1168627	Exit
1184986	1186587	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1212711	1227745	with the GuitarHero.com site and how you can link your Xbox 360 or from what I understand Wii or PlayStation 2 or 3 whatever versions to the website and you can have like an online band and all this stuff and these online on the web leaderboards.
1227825	1229567	I really like that kind of functionality.
1229947	1232710	Is that that whole web 2.0 thing to an extent?
1233305	1235286	Rob, what did you think of the changes in interface during gameplay?
1259612	1260313	It's not bad.
1261354	1270661	I was a little hesitant to hearing that Harmonix was not going to be behind it and it was going to be a Neversoft, but considering they built the whole thing from the ground up, it's not bad.
1271401	1274223	I'm hearing things about some frame rate issues that people are having.
1274444	1279207	I haven't noticed it yet, but then again, keep in mind I've only really played like five songs so far.
1279908	1282770	I really like how it looks a lot better now.
1285576	1294041	The cool thing about them having built the thing from scratch is that they didn't just up-res something they had before, as in the case of Guitar Hero 3, it's from the ground up.
1295206	1297247	and I love the cartoon stuff in between levels.
1297267	1298068	Yeah, that was great.
1298729	1300630	Dan was saying today, he's like, I love the bassist.
1300930	1306955	Yeah, honestly, this is kind of like the step up that I think Guitar Hero 2 should have been in a way.
1307376	1310418	Not that I'm saying Guitar Hero 2 is bad, but it's just kind of like there wasn't much there.
1310438	1312360	It was kind of a rehash of the first game with new songs.
1313020	1317144	I think this is generally a step in the right direction, but again, I need to spend a little more time with the game.
1317184	1320767	I haven't played it online at all, but I'm liking what I see so far.
1321511	1327234	So if chat room, you guys have some comments, chat.orangeloungeradio.com and we'll be reading those.
1328455	1329475	I'm just trying to see what's going on.
1329495	1333938	A lot of folks were still commenting on the unlock, pay to unlock stuff.
1335398	1340581	Kevin DDR says, pay to unlock is only fine, in my opinion, when you have low or no price for the game.
1341021	1346584	Kind of like Xbox Live Arcade maybe, but usually they don't really do much pay to unlock with Xbox Live Arcade.
1346964	1348065	Or free to unlock.
1349020	1353285	and the only thing you're paying is for the price of Xbox Live Gold or Silver.
1353325	1354066	Well, Silver is free.
1354386	1357710	But like I'm talking about like the Dead Rising costumes were free, right?
1357730	1359472	But you had to be connected to Live to download them.
1359712	1364657	I don't think many people have a problem with that and that just kind of is an enhancement for those folks that happen to be on the internet.
1364737	1365138	Hey, Rob.
1365398	1365578	Yes.
1365859	1367560	You know what's bullshit about Guitar Hero 3?
1367641	1367801	What?
1368421	1369723	They took out Pandora.
1370600	1370940	Did they?
1370980	1371701	I didn't even notice.
1371741	1373343	They put in that stupid Midori.
1373463	1374324	I like Midori.
1374344	1375185	I hate her.
1375225	1376005	She's so stupid.
1376185	1377327	I unlocked her green hair.
1377347	1378047	It's awesome.
1378167	1381391	I so miss Pandora because she was like the total goth rocker.
1381431	1382371	Pandora was pretty cool.
1382391	1383573	Maybe she's unlocked later.
1384033	1384914	She's not an unlockable.
1385755	1387456	She's completely not in it.
1387917	1388197	All right.
1389138	1390059	But we do have Slash now.
1391132	1396257	All right, let's get to some housekeeping tonight, and then we'll get into the gaming news.
1396658	1398379	Not a lot to say for housekeeping tonight.
1398440	1409231	I do want to encourage, if you didn't check it out, I mean, now the game's kind of out there, so it might not be as exciting, but on Operator 11, we did do a Guitar Hero 3 retail unboxing after the show last week, and we hope to bring you more stuff like that later.
1409531	1412594	The chat room was asking if maybe we'd play some Guitar Hero 3 after the show tonight.
1413054	1414376	I don't know, because I'm kind of...
1415516	1415896	and DarkSakura.com.
1436943	1437983	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1460959	1462340	Guitar Hero 3 Guitar on Guitar Hero 3
1485424	1491387	But the Guitar Hero 2 Explorer model, at least on the 360, does work with both.
1491527	1493308	So that's where you need to go.
1493568	1494689	Buy that one instead.
1496570	1501473	Now, of course, some speculation is, you know, why is it not working?
1501653	1509377	Well, it might be that, you know, Activision's only, in fact, it does say on the box, only official guitars will, you know, work with Guitar Hero 3.
1509417	1510938	And they've been known to do this in the past.
1511357	1519783	But Rock Band though, Harmonix has actually come out and said they welcome any third-party software or they support any third-party guitars or accessories, so
1540148	1545852	You can't help but feel like, though, that there's a little bit of, like, jabs going on here with this.
1545912	1546232	Oh, yeah.
1546252	1553437	I mean, I don't know if it's just an unfortunate coincidence for these guys, but it does feel a little bit like you wonder if they're taking jabs at each other, which is shit for the consumer.
1553657	1568087	I mean, you know, but I guess according to that quote or whatever I had heard, they were saying, you know, well, we base it off the standard Xbox Live, you know, blah, blah, blah, and if people make their controllers to the Xbox Live specifications, then everything ought to work.
1568107	1568608	Yeah.
1569261	1573164	But for whatever reason, it doesn't seem to be working in this case, which sucks for us in the end.
1573904	1574545	Not for me, though.
1574605	1577527	I resisted buying the bundle because I already had the Guitar Hero 2 controller.
1578267	1586913	Well, there's a lot of third-party adapters that they have out there that require... Like, for example, the ones that hook up a keyboard and mouse via the USB.
1586933	1594918	You have to have a wired controller plugged in because it reads that identifier off of the wired controller and thinks it's just a wired controller plugged in.
1595018	1597920	Otherwise, it wouldn't work either because that platform is not open.
1598401	1598961	It's just...
1600264	1606827	The third-party companies have to license that stuff, so when the homebrew guys decide to make an adapter for it, they have to kind of trick it.
1607427	1620173	And maybe, maybe, someone will come up with an adapter for, say, the Rock Band guitar, the hookup to the 360 that also has a wired controller plugged in that will allow you to do this, kind of bootleg it.
1620473	1623995	Or, in my opinion, the bigger company will hotfix their game to just make it work.
1625175	1627737	They'll find the specifications of the other guitar and just make it work.
1628517	1628777	I don't know.
1629502	1629982	We'll see, though.
1651608	1653649	This user named Torchy has started a thread.
1653729	1656270	Warning to those buying Guitar Hero 3 at Walmart.
1656570	1661192	Check your bundles packaging carefully before you purchase to ensure the correct guitar is enclosed.
1661532	1663393	And they have included screenshots.
1663513	1669416	And yes, there are some bundles of Guitar Hero 3 that come with the classic red SG guitar controller.
1670114	1672795	And there's screenshots all over this thread to prove that it's true.
1673296	1676097	Now, who knows where this is coming from?
1676117	1681760	Because I would think, well, this box... I mean, I don't think Walmart could have cooked these boxes up themselves.
1682120	1688763	So it seems to me like it's some type of agreement with the company in a way for Walmart to stay the low-priced leader or whatever.
1688803	1690104	They have to take some things out.
1690144	1693225	They can sell it probably cheaper than getting rid of some of those older guitars.
1693445	1693906	That's right.
1694446	1694626	So...
1695208	1697029	That's completely false advertising, though.
1697409	1697769	Not really.
1697949	1699190	It says it right on the box.
1699230	1700410	I don't think it's false advertising.
1700671	1709335	Yeah, I wouldn't say it's false advertising, except it's kind of misleading for those of us that have been following this game on the internet, because we never knew that Walmart was going to do ha-ha-ha, switcheroo.
1709715	1716618	And unfortunately, some of these people who ran to the store at midnight, picked up the first copy of Guitar Hero 3 on the shelves, like, oh, I've got to get this.
1716658	1720200	And they maybe didn't think to read the box first, because they were just so excited, right?
1720440	1721080	Who can fault them?
1721260	1722581	Hey, but hey, here's one thing, though.
1722641	1725382	You can always take it back to Walmart, because they'll take returns on almost anything.
1725482	1726742	That is a very good point.
1726782	1733105	Walmart also has a very liberal return policy, and quite frankly, you ought to tell them, this was not the game I was expecting to buy.
1734205	1735826	This is not the controller that you're looking for.
1736566	1736926	Exactly.
1737326	1738407	So, there you have it.
1740707	1742328	So, be careful.
1742408	1745509	A word of warning to those who are going to be buying their game at Walmart.
1746310	1749931	Although, maybe you ought to just go to Target, Best Buy, GameStop,
1750740	1752061	Guitar Center, for God's sake, sells this game
1779804	1780884	If anybody wants to know.
1781905	1782885	I would like to know.
1784726	1786026	I would like to know the highlights.
1786266	1788567	Read the songs that jump out at you as awesome inclusions.
1788787	1799771	Well, Rolling Stones, Give Me Shelter, and The Who, Won't Get Fooled Again, Boston, Foreplay, Long Time, David Bowie, Suffragette City.
1800491	1802452	Oh, this game has David Bowie in it, and I'm happy it wins.
1802732	1805033	There's a cover of Paranoid by Black Sabbath.
1805803	1812768	Don't Fear the Reaper, Blitzkrieg Pop by The Ramones, Detroit Rock City by Kiss, though that makes me happy.
1813728	1817351	We've also got Rush's Tom Sawyer, which is one of my favorite songs.
1818191	1821874	Faith No More Epic, Pixie's Wave of Mutilation.
1823795	1824876	This is my favorite R.E.M.
1824896	1825676	song, Orange Crush.
1827658	1831260	And we've also got Learn to Fly by Foo Fighters, Inner Sandman, Metallica.
1831841	1835443	We've got Weezer's Say It Ain't So, Radiohead Creep, and I love Radiohead.
1836287	1860389	Beastie Boys Sabotage, Black Hole Sun, I Think I'm Paranoid, Celebrity Skin and then for the more current stuff we have OK Go, here it goes again, Nine Inch Nails, The Hand That Feeds Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Danny California, The Killers When You Were Young and then one of the unlockable tracks is Ben Camaro, With Pleasure
1861792	1862852	Random ass thought here.
1863033	1872356	I mean, it's kind of interesting because two of those bands you named that are in the game, Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails, have been in the news a lot lately about, you know, kind of their defiance of traditional record releasing.
1872576	1876938	You know, obviously Radiohead put out their album in rainbows on the internet for people to pay whatever they want for it.
1877238	1880120	And Nine Inch Nails basically declared their independence from record label recently.
1880180	1881120	It kind of gets me thinking.
1882541	1889424	Is this type of Guitar Hero Rock Band thing a possible delivery method, promotional tool of new songs by these artists in the future?
1889444	1891165	Yep, they've already said they want to do that.
1891185	1892006	Wow, that's pretty rad.
1892026	1899929	They're going to be releasing whole albums, and they're going to be tying in stuff with MTV, and that is definitely something that's going to happen with Rock Band.
1899949	1900430	You watch.
1900710	1902311	Very interesting little tie-in there.
1902811	1904171	I'm pretty happy with the list, though.
1904912	1905952	I do want to say this, though.
1905992	1907293	Oh, I thought you had your hand raised.
1908654	1909234	No.
1910074	1910735	Sorry, bad radio.
1912392	1913213	I will say this, though.
1913253	1915014	Unfortunately, Rock Band did not have Heart.
1915835	1916095	I know.
1916135	1916895	That makes me sad.
1916935	1920418	That does make me a little sad, because Guitar Hero 3 did have Barracuda, which was all kinds of awesome.
1920438	1922119	Because pre-'80s Heart was the best.
1922159	1922600	That's right.
1922720	1924681	When they were still that folk rock.
1924781	1925322	Well, I don't know.
1925362	1927003	I mean, some post-'80s, you know.
1927023	1927844	I don't know.
1927884	1929124	In the 80s, they had Gem Hair.
1929225	1931486	They did have Alone, too, which was, like, the best song ever.
1931506	1932107	They had Gem Hair.
1932527	1936310	Anyway, thank you for the report on Rock Band, DarkSakura.
1936350	1937070	I think it's awesome.
1937371	1939172	I wish they would have, like, I don't know.
1940250	1941451	Prodigy or something in there.
1941471	1942412	That'd be pretty awesome.
1942432	1944074	Nine Inch Nails in there.
1944114	1945416	That's really sweet.
1946057	1946577	That's what I'm saying.
1946617	1955067	If like Rock Band does well, I really hope they put out something like something to appease those of us that didn't
1955640	1957541	Get more Beatmania in the US.
1957961	1961863	And I know that's kind of a bit, you know, a lot of the purists for Beatmania are probably going to go, What?
1962303	1968706	But seriously, I would like to see some type of trance dance using the Beatmania concept but improving on it.
1968726	1969927	I think it would be a lot of fun.
1970287	1973628	But using songs that we know a little more over here maybe.
1973708	1976450	Not to say that songs in Beatmania were bad because they really weren't.
1976550	1980772	Although I do feel the series has gotten a little stale now that we're on, what, 13th, 14th game.
1981052	1983433	I would like to see stuff like Prodigy and all these other...
1983933	1986274	Put out a game with Above and Beyond in it, I swear to God I'm so there.
1986314	1988074	I'll pay $80 for controller, hands down, I'm there.
2007300	2023603	So some other interesting things, and this is kind of something we've talked about before with patents and stuff, and why the hell isn't Konami suing these people for using, obviously since Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania came out way long before Rock Band or Guitar Hero were even around.
2024183	2024643	So what's up?
2024903	2034985	Well, apparently actually Harmonix, and they've been licensing the rights to use this stuff, including the patents for the guitars,
2035866	2038427	are being licensed from Konami.
2038807	2050750	However, for the drum stuff, they're not licensing it since that's actually being, they're using patents from Drumscape, if you remember that MTV arcade drum game that came out a long time ago.
2050770	2051030	Vaguely.
2051050	2053351	I think I like saw it once and thought it looked kind of dumb.
2054131	2054711	I never played it.
2054771	2055952	So that was pretty interesting.
2055972	2060253	And also, of course, Activision is also licensing the rights for guitars as well.
2060633	2060793	So,
2062076	2068258	You know, Konami doesn't need to necessarily bring out the game here because they're making money outside from the sales of these.
2068678	2069378	Gotta go to chat.
2069458	2073059	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com Legend of Zaku says, Fuck you, Sky.
2073779	2077340	Konami needs to do it, not Harmonix Red Octane in regards to Beatmania.
2078521	2080281	If they want to do it, great.
2080601	2083262	But I'm not going to sit around and wait.
2083382	2083902	You know what I mean?
2083962	2087043	Like, I would totally support Konami doing this.
2087223	2088023	I wish they would.
2088083	2089904	I think they could do an awesome job with it.
2090244	2090884	But they're not.
2091678	2096739	Yeah, they're testing 2DX Gold in America, but that's not going to do it.
2098058	2101699	For those of us that have been hardcore into Balmani for a long time, yeah, that's awesome news.
2102099	2106401	But where did Guitar Hero succeed where Guitar Freaks did not?
2106761	2114724	Guitar Hero brought songs everybody knew and everybody wanted to play and people wanted to rock out in their living room to well-known songs.
2114824	2120006	Unless Konami is willing to invest a little money in a powerhouse song list, not going to happen.
2120026	2120526	I'm sorry.
2120766	2123267	That's just – to me, that's fact.
2123743	2126285	and that's based on the success of Guitar Hero.
2126626	2127006	You know what?
2127026	2136594	But if Konami wants to step up their game on Beatmania, I totally support it and I think they could kick some major ass and beat these other guys to the punch and show us why Konami was first.
2136714	2137755	I don't think they should bring it over.
2137775	2138276	I don't think they will.
2138296	2138836	I don't think they will.
2138936	2147183	I don't think they should because to be honest, Konami, especially in their, you know, Bimani, you know, line, has not been innovative in the last like 10 years.
2147563	2149885	Seriously, I mean, what have we seen come out of there?
2150006	2150266	I mean...
2151698	2160724	Extreme, and Supernova, and the Universe series, and hell, Hottest Party, that shit is not innovative at all.
2160784	2163346	It's just fucking copying and pasting shit from other games.
2164227	2171471	I agree and I don't, because I actually thought some of the single player modes in Ultramix, I love Ultramix too, that's my favorite freaking Ultramix ever.
2171491	2172312	I'm not talking about Ultramix.
2172312	2172712	Thanks for watching!
2187759	2188600	Pay to unlock packs.
2188980	2189900	Pay to unlock packs.
2190020	2190520	My mistake.
2191181	2191281	One.
2191861	2193402	One is the only thing that they had for it.
2193422	2196344	I mean, later on they could have had different unlock packs and stuff, but no.
2196684	2201706	Instead, they're going to just release another retail version of the game six months later because, you know what?
2201886	2205188	You can make money off of it a lot more than you would those download packs.
2205728	2208210	So, I mean, this is what they did with Karaoke Revolution.
2208930	2213492	I hear you and I don't because I feel like Guitar Hero 2 kind of did the same thing with the first Guitar Hero.
2213532	2213973	You know what I mean?
2213993	2214193	They did.
2214213	2214573	They did.
2214873	2215213	They did.
2215494	2217956	I mean, and they did it with the Rock the 80s thing.
2218196	2219938	I mean, they were just trying to make more money on the side.
2220038	2223741	And, yeah, they haven't innovated either, but that's the thing.
2224042	2229146	And that's why Guitar Hero 3 is very encouraging to me so far because I see, like, this online thing.
2230227	2232930	And I see, like, okay, this really feels like a step up.
2233330	2237214	Maybe Konami needs to take a page out of what's going on here, hand it off to some other developers.
2237234	2237934	But see, that's the thing, though.
2238035	2238335	It's like...
2238923	2244949	I can get excited about their arcade releases because that's some cool stuff that they're doing there.
2245269	2250594	But when their home releases come out, nowadays I don't give a shit.
2250634	2252455	It's like, ooh, another DDR game.
2252475	2253336	That's really cool.
2254617	2256519	But who cares?
2256679	2259402	It's not like something I'm running out to the store and going to buy.
2259962	2263986	I used to because it was really exciting to see all these new songs and stuff.
2264046	2264146	But
2264915	2269176	Now it's just so watered down, they just don't care anymore, it seems like.
2269277	2271177	It's like, whatever, you know, it's DDR.
2271237	2276819	People will buy it because you'll exercise to it and stuff, and that's the crowd that they're going after.
2276839	2278580	They don't care about the people that like the game.
2279080	2280320	Tonight's show is very interesting.
2280340	2281941	This is a throwback to our old days.
2282361	2284482	For those that may not know, check us out the first time.
2285402	2288523	The first three years of our show or so, we were all about strictly...
2289484	2293827	Music-based games and talking about the DDR community and tournaments and then other things going on.
2294347	2296729	So very interesting tonight that we have all this music gaming news.
2297089	2298710	It's been a real throwback to our heyday.
2298750	2301412	So if we sound really passionate about these issues, it's because we are.
2302053	2303934	Loki, myself, DarkSakura, you know how we met?
2305115	2306095	Golf Land, DDR.
2306736	2310458	Road trips to Miggle in the Bay to play Beatmania 2DX.
2311179	2312840	This is how we should.
2313660	2316282	Like a throwback road tour.
2316822	2319124	I want to make it a regular thing again.
2319890	2323432	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2343669	2345430	That's the core part of any DDR game.
2345450	2347251	If it has a shitty song list, you're not going to want to play it.
2347671	2350993	So make what you will of this song list for DDR Universe 2.
2351193	2353694	I'm not going to read the whole thing, but let me tell you some of the licenses.
2354134	2366000	Take Me Out by Franz Ferdinand, The Way You Move by Outkast, Walk Like an Egyptian by The Bangles, Rocket by Herbie Hancock, Safety Dance with Men Without Hats, He's the Greatest Dancer by Sister Sledge.
2366181	2368502	We've got a lot of throwback songs in this one.
2369142	2371583	And let's see, Fire by Ferry Corsten,
2374821	2376102	I'm trying to see what else is here on that list.
2376142	2384626	We also have some pretty cool Konami remixes because we have a new Contra medley mix by Niko Jira.
2385186	2386086	That's going to be in there.
2386767	2388227	So pretty cool.
2389188	2389968	Okay.
2390048	2392089	Oh, Jelly Kiss is going to be downloadable, it looks like.
2392429	2399033	They have also announced some of the songs that are going to be in the first download pack, and I hope this isn't pay to unlock.
2399073	2399853	We don't know yet.
2399973	2400753	Oh, I bet you it is.
2400793	2404095	I bet you it is, too, because that's why we already have the songs for it.
2404448	2405969	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2433857	2436339	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2456738	2464546	Mutant Storm Empire on Xbox 360, Tony Hawk's Proving Ground on the 31st, Need for Speed Pro Street for the mobile phone, Avatar the Burning Earth on Xbox 360,

2511605	2512045	So that's it.
2512826	2513366	Santa.
2513626	2514267	Santa.
2515068	2515328	Anyways.
2516849	2526197	In the U.S., there's quite a bit of stuff coming out, including the ever-controversial Manhunt 2, finally making its way out on PlayStation 2, PSP, and the Wii.
2527423	2530324	I'm sure we'll see a lot of that in the news probably in the next few weeks.
2531544	2535185	Of course, today Guitar Hero 3 came out, so go pick that up.
2536646	2540347	Other platforms, Disgaea, Afternoon of Darkness on PSP.
2541367	2543648	Let's see, we've also got Ben 10.
2544048	2546368	That's coming out on quite a few platforms.
2546408	2550970	PlayStation 2, PSP, Wii, and I believe the DS.
2553084	2559227	Also, there's Cars Mater National, which is a sequel to the Cars game that came out last year, which sucked, by the way.
2559427	2565690	That was another one of those launch racing games that, God knows, blew for the Wii.
2566450	2568231	Anyways, let's see here.
2568671	2569932	Also on the Wii, Battalion Wars 2.
2569992	2571373	That one actually looks pretty good.
2572413	2573274	That's coming out this week.
2574254	2575935	And let's see, the Simpsons game.
2576355	2577736	It's going to be out on almost everything.
2577796	2580077	PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, 360, the Wii, and DS.
2584377	2588421	Also on the PlayStation 3 this week, the ever-delayed Stranglehold.
2589121	2592023	That's going to be coming out as well as the collector's edition.
2593485	2598829	And let's see, on PC, we have Hellgate London.
2599649	2602131	That's going to be coming out as well as The Witcher.
2604553	2609277	And let's see, on DS, Barbie Island Princess.
2609297	2609357	Yes.
2610359	2610919	Yay!
2610999	2614361	That's also coming out on the Wii, I believe, and PS2.
2614681	2616802	What exactly does Barbie do in Island Princess?
2616882	2618803	It's based off some DVD that came out.
2618983	2622745	Does she vote off her friends off the island one at a time?
2623445	2626087	And who is the prettiest supremacy?
2627007	2627407	I don't know.
2629208	2630149	What else is coming out?
2630549	2631329	Assault Heroes.
2631369	2632670	That's also coming out on PC.
2632730	2635671	Remember that was an Xbox Live Arcade title as well.
2637092	2638993	Same with that Battlestar Galactica game.
2639500	2641942	PC, Naruto, Rise of a Ninja, Viva Piñata Party Animals
2664463	2692784	on the Xbox 360 woohoo and then Virtua Fighter 5 that's also coming out oh and Time Shipped on Xbox 360 as well chat comments GS68 says it's a fucking Barbie game skip Frisbee says the tribe has spoken Ken pack your bags oh and Ratatouille Food Frenzy on DS which is a rip off of Cooking Mama that may not necessarily be a bad thing because now you're mixing Cooking Mama with Disney Pixar franchises that could be okay
2693868	2695069	Pixar can do no wrong.
2695950	2696170	What?
2696451	2697592	Pixar can do no wrong.
2698313	2698773	I don't know.
2699114	2699514	I don't know.
2700435	2703839	In the video game realm, they've licensed their stuff out questionably before.
2704339	2705400	But Pixar didn't do it.
2705540	2706581	That's true.
2706622	2708143	Pixar themselves can do no wrong.
2708163	2709965	It's THQ that released it.
2710506	2711747	Well, THQ can do some wrong.
2712187	2713729	Hopefully they won't.
2714230	2714630	We'll have faith.
2715814	2715934	XBOX 360
2740857	2743261	Going to some other platforms on the Nintendo Wii.
2743782	2749152	Opuna is coming out in Japan on the 1st of November as well as Super Mario Galaxy.
2749172	2750374	Opuna looked weird.
2750414	2753279	Wasn't that that one where you control the entire game with like the nunchuck?
2754159	2755961	I believe that is the game, yes.
2756261	2757222	I'll pull up more information.
2757743	2758603	I'll come back to that in a moment.
2759945	2764089	And read some other release dates, such as the PlayStation 3 is getting G.I.
2764149	2764890	Jockey 4 2007.
2766491	2767672	We know that here is winning post 7.
2769094	2772177	And Railfan, Taiwan High Speed Rail.
2774239	2775019	Go Train Sims.
2775040	2775940	I guess, yeah, there you go.
2776301	2777542	High Speed Train Sims.
2778001	2779081	Go to TurboSpeed.
2779582	2783904	On the PlayStation 2, MotoGP07, another port of G.I.
2783944	2787425	Jockey 4, and Super Robot Taisen Scramble Commander II.
2787705	2789746	Just what we need, more Robot Taisen.
2789826	2790426	That's right.
2790646	2790866	Oh, my God.
2790887	2792127	They're making an anime series now, too.
2792527	2793207	That's kind of cool.
2794108	2796469	I played one of the Robot Taisen games that had the Eva...
2797230	2797730	Units in it.
2797931	2798491	It was pretty cool.
2798591	2801153	Oh, I forgot to mention a couple also in the U.S.
2801293	2803555	Disney's High School Musical, the game.
2804035	2805196	Let's give that for Shane.
2805956	2808018	High School Musical Sing It on PlayStation 2.
2808598	2810359	You know what I bought Shane for his birthday?
2810420	2810600	What?
2810640	2811740	Just going on a total tangent here.
2812141	2817525	I bought him tickets to see High School Musical on ice here in Sacramento, and then he moved to Kansas.
2817885	2818445	I'll go with you.
2818866	2819266	I don't know.
2819286	2821407	He has to send me the tickets because it's this weekend.
2821728	2822508	Oh, dude, tell him this in the back.
2822548	2823469	And I think he stole his tickets.
2823889	2825109	Tell them to FedEx it.
2825149	2825589	I'll go with you.
2825609	2827470	FedEx me your birthday present because Jamie and I are going.
2827490	2828050	I'll go.
2828270	2828850	I'll totally go.
2828870	2830771	You really want to go see a high school musical on ice?
2830811	2831771	I just want to go do something.
2831971	2832471	I don't know.
2832531	2836012	It's just going to... I've never been to see anything on ice.
2836372	2839312	I know this is going to sound really wrong, but it just sounds so gay.
2840033	2840653	I want to go.
2841013	2846034	I petition that they have Manhunt 2 on ice because that would be something I would like to see.
2846054	2846654	Blood bounces.
2847719	2851180	I don't even think I could get my boyfriend to go see a high school musical on ice with me.
2851200	2851860	That's how gay it is.
2868664	2872466	My mom used to be an amateur roller skater and did figure roller skating.
2872527	2873827	Roller skating is fine.
2874027	2875588	I still don't like the figure skating part.
2875648	2876849	Roller derby is cool, though.
2877009	2878430	Actually, it's kind of lame.
2878490	2881452	We have a roller derby team in Sacramento that they wanted me to audition for.
2882253	2882753	That's awesome.
2882853	2883653	I could punch people.
2883793	2884474	I'd be good at it.
2885274	2885735	You know what, though?
2885755	2888036	You totally reminded me of something I didn't mention in my gaming week.
2888156	2888316	What?
2888596	2890398	We have Ace Combat 6 with a controller.
2890598	2891858	Oh, how's that going?
2891918	2894200	I get totally motion sick on it, but it's really cool.
2895220	2895881	Cool.
2896201	2897462	The controller's really nice.
2898012	2900734	You know how they could get more people to go to E4ALL next year?
2901575	2902255	Put it on ice.
2903636	2904557	E4ALL on ice.
2904597	2905838	I've never been ice skating, Rob.
2905858	2906299	Yeah.
2906739	2907680	I've never been ice skating.
2907720	2909401	Although I hear E4ALL might get put on ice anyway.
2909421	2912303	You've never been ice skating at all?
2912443	2912664	Never.
2913084	2913644	We're going to go.
2914365	2914605	Okay.
2914625	2916446	We have to for this Christmas.
2916927	2917868	When my leg gets better, though.
2917888	2918708	We can't do it this week.
2918748	2921811	But when my leg gets better, we'll go ice skating for sure.
2922791	2923632	Just in time for the holidays.
2924172	2925153	But I've been water skiing.
2926214	2926634	Good times.
2926815	2927255	Skating sucks.
2927901	2928341	I hate it.
2928742	2929262	I've tried it.
2929763	2930303	It's okay.
2930723	2931304	But it's lame.
2931324	2932845	I'm really good at roller skating though.
2932985	2934607	I used to be able to do all kinds of stuff.
2934727	2936508	Gerardimo says roller skating on ice.
2936548	2938650	And Tigerclaw says DDR on ice.
2939110	2939311	No.
2939451	2939971	There you have it.
2940051	2940592	Do not want.
2940672	2942353	GS68 says Mario Kart on ice.
2942553	2942853	Oh wait.
2943054	2944155	They actually have those stages.
2944795	2945255	Thanks for watching!
2966890	2968611	I've never been kart racing out here.
2968851	2970152	I've got a membership there.
2970192	2974255	The last time I did anything on a go-kart was Autopia at Disneyland, my first time going.
2974436	2974736	Really?
2974796	2975957	And I haven't done Autopia since.
2976177	2976517	Wow.
2976657	2981521	And before that, it was at the Miracle Strip in Panama City, Florida, which they tore down the Miracle Strip.
2981901	2983102	I never go on Autopia.
2983182	2984043	Isn't it on a track?
2984183	2987566	Isn't it on a... Yeah, it is, but they had this thing that was called like...
2989368	2992129	It was another car type thing, but you could actually drive these little cars.
2992509	2995690	And you had a set path that they went on, but they weren't on a track.
2996130	2997250	So you could actually run into people.
2997290	2997870	It was great.
2998110	2998991	I'm sorry, internets.
2999111	3005072	We were talking about Japanese release dates, and suddenly we got into RPM motor racing and all that stuff.
3005952	3007073	That's why they listened to us.
3007173	3009633	And the chat room is still going into crap on ice.
3010333	3010633	Great.
3010754	3011854	Violent fight on ice.
3012134	3013594	Ranma says Pokemon on ice.
3013674	3014634	Dude, I think they have that.
3014714	3015355	I think they've done that.
3015415	3016575	I think they've done that, yeah.
3017253	3019236	Did you see that picture on... I'm never going to get these dates on.
3019256	3020999	Did you see that picture on Dig this week?
3021780	3026808	The whole thing with... It was the picture of Pikachu and it looked like he had a vagine.
3028094	3032456	Okay, somebody in the chat room, please dig up that picture, because Loki and DarkSakura are giving me blank stares right now.
3032776	3035198	I need to show them the Pikachu picture that was on Dig earlier this week.
3035218	3035718	It was so funny.
3035738	3037499	Did he have, like, camel toe?
3037759	3041821	No, but it was like a giant, like, blow-up Pikachu, like at an amusement park.
3041841	3042341	I've seen that one.
3042361	3046143	And all these kids were going in, but it looked like... They were going in his crotch.
3046183	3048944	They were going in a big Pikagina.
3052445	3053166	That was great.
3053206	3055187	Yeah, I think you put that on your... Do not want...
3056587	3058268	Trauma Center on Icewind.
3058368	3058688	I'm sorry.
3058768	3060649	I need to finish the Japanese release dates.
3060689	3061189	I apologize.
3061209	3062069	That would help, Rob.
3063170	3067171	On the Nintendo DS this week in Japan, Dragon Tamer, Sound Spirits.
3069392	3071353	How in the hell am I supposed to pronounce this this week?
3071773	3078195	Zaiden Hojen Nippon Kanji Noriyuku Kenti Kyokai Koshiki Soft 250 Manin no Kanken.
3081297	3081877	Thanks for watching!
3100731	3101371	Just movies.
3101651	3102412	No games this week.
3102492	3104774	But if you want to pick up Gremlins, it's out this week.
3104894	3106615	Gremlins is the best movie ever.
3106635	3107336	I suggest you do.
3107556	3109557	I forgot something I played this week.
3109998	3111158	And this is worth mentioning.
3111219	3117183	Sorry to derail the whole show here, but I downloaded a CDI emulator.
3117363	3117663	What?
3118204	3123808	And they have a ROM online for Super Mario Wacky Worlds.
3123908	3126830	It was an unreleased game that is awful.
3127270	3129052	It was so horrible.
3129835	3152666	and I played it for about 5 minutes here's the picture Loki oh that's pretty bad oh my god oh my god it was so horrible basically they just ripped the sprites and music out of Super Mario World and just took a dump on it and that's basically what it was horrible SSJ100Matt asks worse than Hotel Mario?
3152726	3157949	well maybe not GS68 says you're just pissing in an ocean of piss I know
3161845	3165046	They did have all the Zelda games on there too, if you want to play them.
3165247	3170950	I swear to God we'll move on with the show just after I say that Opuna does look to be that game I think you were thinking about.
3171050	3172411	Actually, wait, no, it's a role-playing game.
3172651	3173492	It is a role-playing game.
3174552	3175373	But it looks cute.
3175893	3176934	I hope they release that over here.
3176974	3179115	It's by Koei, and there's the little box art.
3179315	3180896	You know what Koei gave us, Rob?
3181877	3184078	They gave us that game with the girl riding a missile.
3184458	3185639	KO Flying Squadron.
3187642	3189843	I could say something about girls riding missiles, but I won't.
3189863	3191083	I know, that was the best game ever.
3191103	3192964	In light of moving on with our program.
3193424	3198866	Forza 2 downloadable content has a price cut because people bitched about it enough.
3200006	3210570	So the Twin Ring Motegi track is going to be decreased from 600 points to 400 points because you're paying too much.
3212751	3216772	Funny, because when we complained about the Guitar Hero download content,
3217783	3218883	They didn't seem to care.
3220984	3222264	Like, we're selling plenty of it.
3222364	3222744	Shut up.
3224885	3225985	Anyways.
3226845	3229386	So an interesting rumor has come out this week.
3230006	3245549	Apparently someone who had gotten their 360 returned back from Microsoft after being repaired noticed that there was a few additional options in their dashboard, including stuff for the 360's IPTV feature that was announced earlier.
3246220	3249066	I want to say Tokyo Game Sh... Not Tokyo Game Show, um...
3249895	3251656	Consumer Electronics Show, I think, this year.
3252096	3254117	It's either that or Game Developers Conference.
3254277	3257339	Oh, one of those shows earlier this year.
3258480	3259040	It was announced.
3259200	3260301	Good reporting, Loki.
3260461	3261001	Excellent reporting.
3261021	3261221	Awesome.
3261381	3261882	Yeah, anyways.
3262702	3270366	So apparently it's going to have different features, including being able to pause and record stuff being streamed off there.
3271907	3276570	Of course, none of these features really worked on it, but it's interesting to see that that's actually...
3277390	3282852	in his dashboard now, so most likely going to be included in the fall update.
3284633	3287214	Now, what I want to know is how the hell did that happen in the first place?
3287914	3290355	Like, how did some guy get this random update?
3290695	3297798	I mean, because I guess if he shipped his Xbox back, did they just send him a new Xbox that were meant to be held off until the update goes live or whatever?
3298118	3300299	Maybe, because it doesn't look like it's the entire update.
3300319	3303660	Maybe, like, they had an updated firmware or something like that that's
3305022	3307243	I don't know when exactly the fall update is rolling out.
3307283	3308825	It's probably within the next few weeks.
3309205	3311326	So they're just probably getting it ready to go.
3311947	3318552	What I would be curious of is that in light of this news, I wonder if other people that are getting their consoles back from Microsoft are going to find the same thing.
3318832	3323515	One of my LiveJournal friends just had to send back their Xbox for Red Rings of Death, so I wonder if his is going to come back with that.
3324356	3324676	Maybe.
3325177	3326518	I don't know.
3327679	3328299	It's interesting.
3328459	3330781	I can't wait to have the IPTV stuff because...
3331542	3332883	Shit, more shows to watch.
3333424	3342212	Although I'm not too familiar with Microsoft's IPTV service, so... I haven't been able to stay on... I'm actually very unhappy that my place that I usually watch TV online is going away.
3342952	3343272	Aww.
3343593	3346475	TVlinks.co.uk They got shut down?
3346936	3347997	Yeah, they're on their way.
3348117	3351640	They went the way of Oink, which was another big, huge news story this week.
3353562	3353862	Anyhow.
3355023	3356684	How else am I going to watch bullshit?
3358186	3358486	I don't know.
3359673	3360554	MiniNova or something?
3360574	3360875	I don't know.
3360935	3369467	Anyway, going back to the Xbox Live Marketplace and other Xbox news, Blue Dragon, which is a game I need to go back and finish, has some new content.
3370408	3372511	Apparently there is a new...
3374547	3376369	6 Treasure Pack for Blue Dragon.
3376629	3382533	You have to pay 200 points for it, but you get some new items that will allow you to boost abilities.
3383054	3389999	So it sounds like this is some pay to unlock content for me, because you're going to get a Whimsical Mind, which randomly enhances...
3390683	3393185	The Way of Thieves The DV Phonograph
3406833	3408014	The Nothing Glasses.
3408514	3413696	It visualizes all those points, because you can search everywhere in this game.
3413736	3420619	It will allow you to actually see the points that you can search with little star symbols, instead of just going around aimlessly.
3421579	3424780	The Shuffled Helmet, that will adjust magical and speed parameters.
3425020	3428782	And the Spring Wind Scarf, which will adjust HP and speed parameters by 20%.
3429482	3433164	So basically, you're going to pay 200 points to make the game a lot easier, it sounds like to me.
3433524	3433884	Which is...
3435043	3436304	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3453047	3457929	Also, I just want to mention real quick, Spider-Man 3 has a new unlock as well.
3457949	3466193	You get to download New Goblin, and this is notable because it was a PlayStation 3 exclusive feature, but now for 240 Microsoft points, you can have it on 360.
3467314	3468554	Which I heard, by the way, is lame.
3470075	3470575	I wouldn't know.
3470595	3477438	I try to avoid games based off of movies unless they're really good, which I can't even think of any off the top of my head.
3477478	3482441	I don't know why you would still have Spider-Man 3 anyways, because I think that game really sucked, and so...
3484267	3486048	It's probably not worth anything right now anyways.
3487149	3492733	Well, for our friends in Japan, the Xbox 360 is getting a price cut.
3494154	3494474	Finally.
3495214	3497396	We knew it would eventually happen.
3497976	3504841	The price cut is going to happen on November 1st, and it should be the equivalent of $243.
3504901	3505501	Wow, that's a big cut.
3505521	3505601	Yep.
3505622	3505742	Nice.
3505762	3505882	Nice.
3509679	3513220	And this would be also why all those games I read earlier are getting a cut as well.
3513240	3514360	I'm sure this all ties in.
3514780	3520101	Make the Xbox 360 a little more cheap and maybe it can get a little steam in Japan.
3520302	3522982	I know there's a few 360 games that are going to be dropping in price.
3523262	3524423	I can't remember which ones.
3524583	3526783	And I also know that there's some being discontinued.
3526803	3529564	Like Perfect Dark Zero is one of them.
3529844	3530284	I remember.
3530504	3531944	Good riddance, I'm sorry.
3533005	3536765	Make way for Perfect Dark Zero 2 now.
3536865	3537386	Please no.
3538126	3539126	Where you still can't jump.
3540384	3541064	I fucking hate that.
3541144	3541904	That's the thing.
3542464	3543865	Next-gen system, no jumping.
3544565	3550486	But one game you can jump quite far in, actually, is Burnout Paradise, which is going to be coming to the U.S.
3551046	3552967	in January, on the 22nd.
3553727	3559388	And that is going to feature an open-world environment, which is going to be kind of interesting, because I know none of the other games have been like that.
3559848	3568330	But you can basically drive around aimlessly, really fast, smash into stuff, jump through the air, explode, all the fun stuff that you would be looking for in a Burnout game.
3569030	3569170	And...
3570197	3582925	So it seems that publishers are starting to get a little smart in releasing stuff in these slow months like January and February and the entire summer instead of just March and November and October.
3583966	3590009	I'm liking this whole trend lately where it seems like game companies are learning there's 12 months in a year.
3591250	3592031	It's kind of exciting.
3592191	3593952	They need to seriously do that because...
3595017	3596158	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3618447	3622490	That caters to a crowd that's going to probably go out and pick up a game whenever they damn well feel like it.
3622930	3625932	So I don't think they're going to take a loss by releasing this in January.
3626052	3632957	But it's good, though, that it's coming out in January and not, like, say, you know, November when there's a ton of shit coming out.
3633197	3637219	In, like, January, I mean, January's actually looking pretty good game-wise so far.
3637239	3644124	They have NFL Tour, Devil May Cry 4, God knows what else, and then as well as, you know, this now.
3644642	3654615	I mean, if they put in a month that there's really nothing coming out, people are going to buy that game instead of saying, well, I'm going to buy this one instead and save my money and then later on they may just decide not to pick it up.
3655957	3656237	I don't know.
3658892	3661133	Well, some other games that you might be able to play through the Christmas season.
3661173	3665234	And speaking of games that are geared at little kids, although I bet some big kids would like this too.
3665634	3668934	THQ has announced they are bringing four new games to Xbox Live Arcade.
3669395	3673035	And some of these are very notable because they tie into Nickelodeon licenses.
3673436	3678197	SpongeBob SquarePants Underpants Slam is coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.
3678517	3679337	And I have to admit...
3680034	3681235	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3702981	3709226	It does kind of open up Xbox Live Arcade to being, you know, a lot of times Microsoft takes some shit for not being very kid-friendly.
3709666	3716571	And certainly, you know Microsoft's going to be pushing this, especially with their new Xbox 360 Arcade console, really pushing the family thing.
3716731	3718492	When Scenic comes out and all that.
3718752	3720093	That's part of their marketing.
3720133	3722455	They have a whole family marketing plan that includes that.
3722535	3732522	Scenic, DDR Universe, actually Guitar Hero 3, and then these titles as well, Viva Pinata Party, and then of course the Xbox Live Arcade stuff.
3733357	3737279	and I know they did some other announcements about cartoons and stuff.
3738499	3745002	By the way, the other games that THQ is going to be releasing, a game called Screwjumper, Elements of Destruction, and Rocket Riot.
3745242	3750744	Spongebob and Screwjumper, that's kind of an odd name, but they are both scheduled for release next month.
3751184	3752345	So they'll be here in time for Christmas.
3752365	3753545	You know what the world needs less of?
3754706	3755266	Spongebob.
3756731	3759613	Elements of Destruction I know is coming out in the DS next year as well.
3759893	3764135	Screwjumper, if you want to know what the hell that is, it's a vertical action racing game.
3764275	3766456	That's per an interview from the developers.
3766776	3774160	You have to destroy alien mining equipment and architecture while plummeting downward in a continual rapid freefall descent.
3774660	3785626	The objective of the game is to maximize score by crashing into and dynamiting as many alien structures as possible on the way down the mineshaft, then to initiate a detonation and race back to safety on the planet's surface.
3785966	3788147	So honestly, this sounds like it might not be bad.
3788207	3791569	It's got aliens, it's got explosions, it's fast, it's racing.
3791889	3793250	Screwjumper might be pretty awesome.
3793270	3793810	We'll see, though.
3794050	3796612	But sometimes games that seem awesome in theory really suck.
3796772	3800694	So we have to hold out until the demo's out this November.
3801417	3802058	Down with Pants
3827779	3828480	I like watching real stuff.
3849252	3849812	You know what?
3850172	3852613	I miss all the stuff from when I was a kid.
3853114	3857916	Because they expected kids to have, you know, follow the story.
3857936	3858496	Imagination?
3858676	3859596	Yeah, imagination.
3859636	3861417	That's what Muppet Babies was all about.
3861437	3862637	Muppet Babies is great.
3862657	3864078	Tell me that cartoon wasn't the shit.
3864098	3864958	That's what that was all about.
3864998	3867459	I'll tell you though, I've had a revival of lately.
3867619	3868440	Loki wants to make a joke.
3868940	3870381	Did you see Drawn Together Babies?
3871401	3871821	No.
3871941	3872581	God, no.
3873002	3873502	I didn't.
3874102	3876083	Drawn Together wasn't funny last season, so I haven't been watching it.
3876103	3876423	It's funny.
3877103	3878904	I've been having a revival of Count Duckula.
3880103	3880964	That's pretty awesome.
3881604	3882785	And Danger Mouse.
3883506	3888070	But I tried going back watching Banana Man, and my God, that was horrible.
3888510	3890392	I can't believe I liked Banana Man when I was 12.
3892013	3894035	So you like Banana Man?
3894115	3895216	I used to like Banana Man.
3896337	3898298	Very, very weird little British tune.
3898418	3899159	Next story, please.
3899499	3901041	Yeah, Xbox 360 crap.
3901381	3901921	How about that?
3902342	3902702	Yay.
3903303	3908227	Toshiba is saying no comment, except they didn't actually say comment, they just said no.
3909472	3913013	about the Xbox 360 HD DVD rumor.
3913893	3915274	So, wait a minute.
3915514	3923416	I mean, because... No, would you like to comment on the internal Xbox 360 HD DVD drive?
3923936	3924096	No.
3924576	3929477	Toshiba said no to the new Xbox 360 DVD HD DVD rumor.
3930338	3932798	But we pretty much all still think it's a rumor, so whatever.
3933098	3934079	You know why this is newsworthy?
3934099	3934799	We don't believe them!
3935079	3936459	Yeah, you know why this is newsworthy?
3936840	3938440	Because you know what they say about Microsoft rumors.
3939198	3940319	Thank you for watching!
3964456	3970020	One game I'm actually kind of excited to see coming to Xbox Live Arcade this week is going to be Mutant Storm Empire.
3970520	3974603	And I love the Mutant Storm Reloaded game when it came out, still one of my favorite shooter games.
3974743	3979486	It was a little bit overlooked because it was too similar to Geometry Wars, I think, and it's slower paced.
3979947	3981488	Yeah, this one though looks really cool.
3981508	3983189	They have it set up a little bit different.
3983209	3989213	Some of the changes you'll see from Reloaded is that the stages now, you actually kind of, it's one long stage.
3989653	3990594	Doors open up and
3991158	3993560	DeLilla, DeLilla That would have been more entertaining
4018694	4020275	It's going to be coming out for 800 points.
4020455	4022977	It's due out this Wednesday, October 31st.
4024438	4025298	It's going to be awesome.
4026699	4030141	Oh, and online co-op it's going to have as well.
4030241	4030642	Oh, nice.
4030782	4031342	That's cool.
4031582	4032002	Very cool.
4032563	4036505	I hope since it's Halloween we're going to get some cheesy Halloween tie-in on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
4036565	4037286	Yaris 2!
4038726	4039907	Because it's scary.
4039947	4040948	It's pretty scary.
4043638	4050181	This time, not only does it have tentacles, but it has mech destroyer legs that the car runs on.
4052842	4056724	The game will just evolve into something that's not even Yaris.
4056784	4057944	It's just like, whatever.
4058204	4062586	I think for the next year, we should make every effort to make a Yaris joke every week on the program.
4062606	4069529	Didn't that game remind you of the programmers of that After Dark screensaver decided to make a game and this is what it was?
4069749	4070950	Guess what Jamie never played?
4071210	4071410	What?
4071823	4072183	Yaris.
4072463	4073844	Well, it's probably a good thing.
4074464	4076425	Consider yourself one of the lucky ones.
4076886	4077606	It's free.
4077806	4079467	Download me!
4079707	4080447	I'm free!
4080588	4081108	I know it's tempting.
4081148	4082168	It's a free game.
4082388	4083829	Hey, if it sucks, whatever.
4083889	4084289	It's free.
4084309	4084910	No, it's not worth it.
4084930	4087551	You pay in the time of your life that you spent.
4087971	4089412	You will never get back.
4089432	4091833	You lose part of your soul after playing that game.
4091873	4092193	That's okay.
4092213	4093074	I don't got much left.
4093434	4096836	In fact, I would like to actually open up our mailbag.
4096896	4099677	I would like to actually solicit... No, because I have to read that.
4100037	4100538	Well, too bad.
4100758	4101058	Okay.
4101958	4103199	We've got to make you work a little harder.
4103579	4106641	So I would like to solicit your best Yaris joke.
4107261	4108702	So I want to hear some Yaris.
4108722	4109622	It can be about the game.
4109662	4110563	Hell, it can be about the car.
4110603	4110963	I don't care.
4111183	4111963	I was going to get one.
4112123	4113664	I want some Yaris jokes in the mailbag.
4113924	4117106	Not tonight because we haven't gotten to the mailbag segment.
4117146	4117386	We will.
4117406	4121708	But for next week's show, as you guys are listening to the podcast later, I want some Yaris jokes.
4121928	4125390	Honestly, though, how is this good advertising for the Yaris?
4125450	4128591	I mean, now when you associate Yaris, you're going to think suck.
4128791	4129712	I mean, that's not –
4130525	4137091	I wouldn't think that's a good thing that, you know, Yaris, oh yeah, that's right, that's that, you know, car that had a crappy game made for it.
4137111	4146280	Or when I go shopping, and I like to see all the features of the Yaris, and I'm like, oh yes, well it has the built-in air conditioning and the GPS unit and the, you know, the leather interior.
4146540	4148842	I'd be like, yes, but where is the tentacle gun?
4149683	4151024	Where's the giant death tentacle?
4151905	4153006	That the commercials and...
4154093	4155274	Where the fuck did that come out from?
4155314	4156694	The stupid tentacle thing.
4156714	4157334	This is weird.
4157595	4158175	Anyway, sorry.
4158215	4159455	We need to move on with the news.
4159676	4159916	Sorry.
4159936	4160476	Can we please?
4160636	4161076	Yes, we may.
4161096	4161756	Please, please, please, please.
4161777	4162697	Yes, yes, yes.
4163437	4166239	News about Spore, which I'm very excited about Spore.
4166439	4166999	Yay.
4167299	4168780	You know, we've always heard these things.
4168820	4169280	Spore is...
4169520	4170681	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4198082	4200043	Maybe late spring is when you're going to see this game.
4200103	4201944	I would say it's probably going to be out somewhere next year.
4201964	4203365	If it came out in April, that would be perfect.
4203465	4208408	April is the crappiest game for months, or game for the year.
4208988	4210089	Basically the worst month for games.
4211209	4211890	It's horrible.
4211990	4214251	It would definitely be a highlight in a low month.
4215312	4220134	Speaking of highlights, we love to read the emails from our listeners every week, don't we, DarkSakura?
4220535	4221975	Yes, we do.
4223296	4224997	I had a gun to her head forcing her to say that.
4225322	4225843	There's, um, six...
4242918	4244339	Wow, well let's get started.
4244679	4245339	Long segment tonight.
4245499	4249261	This one comes from AceSavior, I guess.
4250062	4251883	It's an X instead of an S for Savior.
4252503	4255565	Hey guys, first I will admit that I am pretty new to the show.
4255685	4260387	I just found the show when I was looking for RSS feeds and podcasts on my PSP a couple days ago.
4260908	4263489	I like the fact that you guys have a website made just for the PSP.
4264383	4266184	Sorry that I haven't updated it in years.
4266204	4267265	Too bad it never gets updated.
4267605	4267865	Hey!
4267925	4268265	Loki.
4268965	4276750	I was going to do OLRE and I kind of, I did not re-register the... Our main website's all kind of broken too, so anyway, whatever.
4276990	4281572	I really appreciate it seeing as how my PSP is the closest thing I can get to a laptop at the moment.
4282032	4290357	Anyway, even after only a few podcasts, I can honestly say this is the best video game internet radio show ever and I'm looking forward to more podcasts to come.
4290457	4291297	Keep on gaming, guys.
4291657	4292758	And then he said I was hot.
4293376	4294437	I'm not.
4295537	4297679	It's just something that happens to women when they get married.
4297739	4298599	They lose their heart.
4298900	4299540	Oh, stop it.
4301541	4301902	Yeah.
4301962	4304783	I know DarkSakura's very shy, but you should see her outfit today.
4304843	4305404	She's very nice.
4305544	4307565	I'm wearing my pirate shirt that I got at Walmart.
4307865	4308506	I think it's cute.
4308646	4309346	With the skirt.
4309386	4309907	I like the skirt.
4309927	4312829	They sell the same shirt at Disneyland, and it's a bright red.
4313249	4317291	And they charge $30 for it at Disneyland, and I paid $12 at Walmart.
4318032	4319293	But what you're wearing today is dark.
4319333	4321374	It's renaissance-y without being over the top.
4321654	4322735	It's renaissance-y but modern.
4323921	4325522	I feel kind of like a rockabilly.
4326883	4327604	Alright, anyhow.
4327684	4329305	Which actually ties into future news.
4332067	4332768	Super Arizona.
4333809	4334770	Ooh, next email.
4335410	4339994	So, this one comes from Polinosis.
4340214	4340995	That's kind of a cool name.
4341695	4345298	I was reading this fascinating article the other day and I was wondering what you guys think of this man's opinion.
4345378	4346639	And he also included a joke.
4347100	4349462	It says, why is the bicycle lying on its side?
4350763	4351023	Why?
4351203	4352104	Because it was too tired?
4352124	4352184	Why?
4356496	4357796	Cricket, cricket, cricket, cricket.
4359117	4362498	So, um... Did I accidentally invite jokes from the listeners last week?
4362538	4363058	I must have.
4363638	4364258	Good effort.
4367179	4369320	But, um... You know what?
4369920	4373421	This article is kind of long, so instead what I'm going to do is I'm going to link it in the chat room.
4373621	4374241	What's the topic?
4374281	4375021	I want to know if I read it.
4375281	4378262	It's about how reviews are phrased, I do believe so.
4378662	4378963	Huh.
4379883	4380283	And, um...
4382000	4384501	saying, consider the following sentences.
4384541	4386462	This book has good book read.
4387002	4388443	This record has good record listen.
4388603	4391044	This movie has good movie watch.
4391324	4392744	This game has good gameplay, right?
4392845	4393085	Yes.
4395586	4395866	Funny.
4396706	4398587	I do sort of understand that.
4398687	4400448	Like you could say, it plays well.
4401568	4401908	You know.
4402889	4406750	But... Yeah.
4408071	4408931	I kind of, in my...
4412105	4415567	Attention to semantics, I guess that I do sort of agree with that.
4417729	4419970	But we'll read it more and maybe respond to it next week.
4419990	4421971	We're going to take that as a homework assignment.
4422011	4422972	I'm posting it in the chat room.
4423232	4423492	All right.
4424693	4425773	I'll take a look at it real quick.
4426174	4426454	Okay.
4427474	4428235	Ooh, Pirate Bay.
4428395	4430536	Anyway, moving forward.
4433658	4438882	We have one from Mark F. Says, Hi, Jamie.
4439242	4441263	And my name is spelled the other way, by the way, but that's okay.
4441837	4443838	You've been playing a lot of Ragnarok Online.
4443858	4446500	I haven't confirmed, but I think RO2 Beta is out.
4446961	4448762	Have you been playing that or the original RO?
4448902	4453245	Also, since you're an MMO girl, have you played World of Warcraft or Guild Wars?
4454065	4454786	Keep up the great work.
4454806	4456047	You guys are very entertaining.
4456427	4458829	I hope you bring back your extra guests from time to time.
4460630	4467835	Well, I know that the RO2 Beta was out in Korea, and I tried to sign up for it, but they needed me to sign up for a social security number or some shit, so I didn't do it.
4468527	4482191	However, it has been brought to my attention that VR2 Beta is now out in the United States and if my laptop is up to the task, I will be downloading that like a mofo and playing it like crazy because I love Ragnarok.
4482411	4484132	Especially since it's a beta, it'd have to be free.
4485872	4486192	Sorry.
4486673	4487053	Keep going.
4488053	4497616	So, to answer your question, yes, I played World of Warcraft and I have stopped playing for World of Warcraft because number one, it's on my other computer and number two, honestly, I didn't think it was that fun.
4498863	4499223	AllTrackValley
4520900	4525644	Going through this whole thing with NC... The people at NCSoft are great.
4525844	4527125	They're just really on the ball.
4527746	4536493	And they've been able to replace my confirmation code, so I will be hopefully sometime in the next week getting back on Guild Wars.
4537314	4539055	I have a character that looks like the Doctor.
4539115	4540036	His name is John Smith.
4541497	4548003	I also have another character that was supposed to be in my friend's guild, and she left the guild, so...
4548703	4550686	I have no idea what the hell is happening, so.
4551807	4552348	I'll be on.
4552748	4553289	You'll see me.
4554050	4554351	I think.
4555512	4559537	And I also was thinking about getting into City of Heroes, but honestly, when do I have the time?
4561901	4562161	Yeehaw.
4563271	4565432	I played Rose online too.
4565912	4570654	One of my new friends who I met through William, I believe is going to come on our show next week.
4570774	4572215	And he's really into City of Heroes.
4572455	4577497	And the reason why I'm having him on next week is he was in the Tabula Rasa beta, which is a game I'm pretty excited about.
4577517	4578337	I want to know more about it.
4578938	4579638	He was telling me about it.
4579658	4580478	It sounds really awesome.
4580498	4583620	He's going to show me the game this week to see if it's something I want to get into.
4583740	4588502	So we'll have him on next week probably and talking about some of the PC games we sometimes overlook.
4589122	4590582	Well, I have another email from the same person.
4590823	4591323	Well, okay.
4591583	4591783	Okay.
4592698	4595622	Here are some of my comments for episode 252.
4596183	4597765	I love the 3D Street Fighter games.
4598546	4602652	It was different playing style that made the Street Fighter characters almost real because of the limitations.
4603032	4605856	I got tired of them jumping 9 feet in the air and spinning around like tornadoes.
4606497	4607819	Sorry, you're alone in that one, buddy.
4608319	4609982	Well, at least he's not bringing up the...
4611431	4621954	PC games are probably getting more love because of better laptop sales and external USB D-pads controllers.
4622414	4623055	Keep up the great work.
4624515	4624795	Cool.
4625875	4628496	I liked the later EX games, honestly.
4629276	4632197	It was the first one that was kind of, well, bad.
4633098	4633518	But, hey.
4634298	4637459	This one is from Spamouflage.
4638707	4639528	I just think that's a cool name.
4640028	4641329	Bonsoir, DarkSakura.
4641929	4643050	Oh, that's French.
4644631	4649414	So here's my statement of the week, and I'd love to get your opinion since I consider you as experts.
4650015	4653137	I've heard that Nintendo is selling lots of Wii systems but no games.
4653277	4653577	Really?
4654178	4658721	What if occasional gamers turn out to be cheap bastards who don't buy games?
4659457	4660118	Three questions.
4660318	4661319	One, is my statement true?
4661439	4662760	Two, are Wii games not selling?
4663080	4665142	Three, where do you go to get the latest game sale figures?
4665842	4669545	I know I could just Google it, but I like hearing DarkSakura read my emails.
4670306	4671587	Merci, spam a flash.
4672488	4678012	Um... I... You know that you can find a lot of the sales types through Consumer Reports, too.
4678813	4678893	Um...
4679716	4685401	Some of the, a lot of the just new sites like Kotaku, what are the other ones?
4685701	4687743	Oh, like Joystick and Destructoid are the big three probably.
4687763	4691946	Yeah, they'll list game sales figures quarterly when they do the quarterly reports.
4692747	4695890	And then I also, for a lot of my UK news, I get from Eurogamer.
4696210	4697611	Loki, where do you get your sales figures?
4697651	4701655	Is that coming from a way of your internal sources at your day job or?
4701995	4702495	MPD.
4702976	4703196	Oh, okay.
4704448	4708270	When you talk about sales numbers on the show, is that numbers you're getting from your work?
4708290	4709571	No, it's from MPD Group.
4710331	4712232	Oh, okay.
4712292	4713973	Plenty of Wii games are selling, trust me.
4714433	4716374	Maybe not all of the Wii games that they want.
4716434	4723378	Like, I know Donkey Kong Barrel Blast didn't sell hotcakes, or maybe... I don't know.
4725739	4730021	But I imagine a lot of those Wii games, just based on what's out there, they're selling to kids and families.
4730061	4732903	They're not necessarily selling to hardcore gaming audience, which is probably why...
4733413	4734694	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4755047	4761171	Also, there's a lot of games that are crappy ports and stuff, or just crappy control and whatever, and a lot of people get jaded by that.
4761491	4768916	It's like, well, shit, I don't know if I want to go spend $50 just to get a game that's going to suck, so maybe Wii buyers are a little more cautious.
4769216	4772778	Unfortunately, all the A-list titles on the Wii right now, too, are coming from Nintendo.
4772858	4777141	I can't think of a third-party A or AAA title on its way soon.
4778496	4780998	I'm sure Chad will think of something, but I can't even think of anything.
4781018	4785281	Well, Manhunt 2, there's stuff from Capcom, Resident Evil, Umbrella Chronicles, Brothers in Arms.
4785341	4786922	Okay, I'll give you Umbrella Chronicles.
4786962	4789304	Medal of Honor Heroes 2, it's going to be big.
4789984	4793187	Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tenkaichi 3 from Atari.
4793827	4795068	I personally am not really interested.
4795088	4795308	Madden 08.
4795708	4796369	Okay, there you go.
4797169	4797470	We'll see.
4800620	4802023	Oh, Nights, says Gerardimo.
4802063	4802504	There you go.
4802604	4803165	Thank you.
4803185	4803405	Nights.
4803465	4804307	Okay, there you go.
4804347	4808394	To be honest, though, you may like Nights, but Nights I don't think is going to be that big of a game.
4809296	4810478	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
4810878	4812161	I am excited about Nights.
4813499	4815641	I think it's going to be fantastically huge.
4816241	4820144	I would totally believe though there's a lot of people just buying the Wii for Wii Sports and that's it.
4820184	4823646	There's a lot of families I bet are doing it and totally fine with Wii Sports.
4823947	4824387	But you know what?
4824407	4833974	There are some companies that are getting smart about the games that are released and a lot of them are pretty budget games like this AMF Bowling Pinbusters from Bethesda I think.
4833994	4835195	I think it's Bethesda.
4835215	4835655	I'm not sure.
4837056	4837596	It's coming out for $19.
4837657	4839618	And you know it's a
4839997	4841398	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4866744	4868165	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4896178	4897139	I love Christmas nights.
4898160	4900641	Anyway... I love Christmas because I get presents.
4901542	4904104	My favorite holiday, though, is coming up in three days.
4904524	4905005	Halloween.
4905025	4906126	This is Halloween.
4906786	4908027	It's a religious holiday for me.
4909668	4910269	It's true.
4910329	4911150	It's a religious holiday.
4911970	4914572	Anyway, it's the end of the year.
4916013	4917054	So, moving forward.
4917595	4922258	This one comes from Robert M. Two stupid things here.
4923119	4924440	This email... No, I'm kidding.
4924460	4925781	I'm just teasing.
4926653	4938398	First of all, I'd like to, although I have participated in the fun myself, suggest that we, after the whole Eye of Judgment bet is finished, drop the whole Loki is Tingle thing and try something fresh, such as Loki as Maria the Hippo from Sly Cooper.
4938978	4940419	No idea why, just random.
4940439	4941859	I don't even know who the hell that is.
4942239	4944620	I mean, I know of the game, I just don't know who that character is.
4944941	4955725	You know, I want to agree with this statement that maybe after the bet is lost, because we all know it will be, that thing ain't selling a million units, that maybe we ought to drop the whole Loki is Tingle thing, but I don't know, there's a part of me that says,
4956257	4957237	It's just never going to go away.
4957457	4958477	Like the whole Death Cake.
4958978	4963278	Just because I did the voice one time, and I don't even remember how the voice was.
4964239	4969100	Seriously, how many years ago did Loki play Karaoke Revolution live on air?
4969500	4973200	It has scared him from doing karaoke permanently for the rest of his life.
4973481	4974781	I mean, that's the effect this show has.
4974981	4979142	No, it's just that we tried to duplicate the funny of it, and it's just you can't.
4979262	4980542	Yeah, second time's never as good as the first.
4981442	4986183	Just like if Loki does actually have to dress up as Tingle for whatever reason, it will only happen once.
4986363	4987504	Only then will we drop it.
4987784	4991965	Because we know now that if he does it again, it's just going to be some weirdo in a suit.
4991985	4994465	I think that it's more fun to speculate.
4995825	5002247	Okay, what was that story written by... Oh God, now I can't think of the guy who wrote The Great Gatsby.
5003667	5004267	Yes, thank you.
5004467	5005548	Fitzgerald, was that his name?
5006288	5006508	Yes.
5006748	5006908	Okay.
5008019	5010159	about the girl who said she was going to cut her hair.
5010179	5010900	She's going to cut her hair.
5011560	5013880	She's suddenly this popular and everyone loves her.
5014200	5015960	And then when she does cut her hair, everyone's like, oh.
5017421	5018201	And then she leaves.
5019981	5022962	But seriously, he's going to set Eye of Judgment on fire.
5023222	5024202	That's going to be awesome.
5024242	5025242	That'll be fantastic.
5026522	5028303	I just made a classic literature reference.
5028323	5030543	I will fucking dance around and set an Eye of Judgment on fire.
5030603	5031343	I won't wear a suit.
5032843	5033363	That's okay.
5034364	5036044	So to continue with this email.
5036284	5036424	Yes.
5037023	5038224	Night of Tangents
5059178	5059899	Thank you for watching!
5073247	5079793	I don't care whether you don't like music games or whether you simply think a portable guitar game simply wouldn't work compared to having the actual instrument hardware.
5080393	5089801	I can only think of two games right now that he could be talking about, and to suggest that Nintendo flat-out abandoned over 20 years of first-party development, that's arguably the only reason the company still has support.
5090281	5098367	Because a different game developer on a completely different continent is publishing a game that he doesn't care for on their system seems dangerously ignorant and selfish to me.
5099448	5100369	Just venting, I guess.
5101270	5101570	That's it.
5101991	5103151	Yeah, you need to fire your friend.
5105232	5109073	I think that you should point this out to your friend and go, now how do you feel?
5110014	5110614	No, here it is.
5110794	5112315	No, I don't think you should fire your friend.
5112415	5114595	But your friend is misinformed on one huge thing.
5114896	5117356	It sounds like your friend is assuming Nintendo makes all these decisions.
5117677	5118177	They don't.
5118457	5119597	Nintendo makes the system.
5119897	5122198	Developers buy the kits to make games.
5122598	5124139	It's up to them what games they want to make.
5124579	5130161	So when they make all these Imagine Babies and whatever games they're making, that's not Nintendo going...
5130541	5134003	Gosh, we really need someone to develop a baby sim for our system.
5134123	5140085	No, they just kind of turn it loose out there, which in my mind is a good thing because a lot of great ideas come from these third-party developers.
5140165	5144527	Unfortunately, a lot of shitty ideas and cheap knockoffs come from them as well.
5144787	5150790	But the other problem is I would not call – I'm assuming the games he's referring to there are like Jam Sessions and the Hannah Montana game.
5151110	5152290	I would not call those knockoffs.
5154171	5154691	They're different.
5155672	5155952	I don't know.
5156294	5158456	Just because they all have music in common does not mean they're in common.
5158476	5160839	Different is not necessarily bad.
5161279	5161459	Yeah.
5162981	5165663	So, your friend, unfortunately, is a little bit misinformed.
5166504	5167225	Your friend's a hater.
5168046	5168606	Okay, I'm done.
5169407	5170308	All done with emails?
5170488	5170808	No more.
5170848	5171970	I said there were six.
5172190	5173451	I can't count tonight.
5173551	5174152	How many have we done?
5174772	5175033	Five?
5175413	5175673	Six.
5176134	5176794	Oh, we've done six?
5176994	5177215	Yes.
5177315	5177815	Then we're done.
5179117	5180458	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com
5181448	5186590	The segment's pushing an hour 30, so let's wrap it up really quickly with a couple more stories.
5186670	5186930	Loki.
5187430	5187790	All right.
5188070	5190711	Anyways, as most people in the U.S.
5190851	5194653	know, there's a lot of fire going on in the L.A.
5194833	5195373	area there.
5195773	5203376	And now, of course, wildfires in the San Diego area have forced Midway to evacuate their San Diego office.
5203436	5206777	But fear not, that will not delay Stranglehold any longer.
5208057	5209818	Actually, most of the development...
5211752	5212892	It happens in other places.
5213153	5215494	I think it's just their corporate office.
5218155	5218615	Don't worry.
5218895	5223117	Your strangleholds in Unreal Tournament won't be delayed any further.
5224057	5227099	Well, Unreal Tournament might, but strangleholds at least won't be.
5228319	5231480	That's a real shame what happened there with those fires.
5232201	5236943	Gosh, I hope none of our listeners... I imagine some of our listeners had to have been affected by it.
5236963	5238383	They evacuated, what, like a million people?
5239084	5239204	And...
5240236	5240836	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5267742	5271324	and Netflix is kind of trying to set their eyes on the future.
5271344	5275046	Of course, Netflix has really kind of turned themselves into the current right now.
5275066	5282270	I mean, hell, Ma and Pa Video Stores and even now Hollywood Video is really being impacted by, some would say, Netflix has been a huge part of this.
5282630	5283631	Well, Netflix...
5285549	5286710	has made an interesting comment.
5286750	5288710	It came from the CEO, Reed Hastings.
5289230	5295892	And he said he's interested in enabling Netflix through, quote, internet-connected game consoles.
5296532	5301354	So very interesting that Netflix kind of wants to put their feelers out there on what they can do.
5302374	5310156	The other thing that should be noted about this is that back in March, Hastings actually is now on the board of Microsoft, right?
5310655	5316163	So you kind of go, hmm, could this mean that a Microsoft Netflix deal is in the cards?
5316830	5324852	I hope so because I think the way the Xbox Live marketplace is set up now is not very friendly to movies and finding movies.
5325172	5329633	However, Netflix on the other hand has an awesome system to find movies and has the whole friends thing and everything.
5329913	5332394	I think Xbox Live is kind of clunky when it comes to their movie downloads.
5332954	5335515	So I think a partnership could be a step up for them.
5335855	5340156	But that's a little bit of fanboyism and dreaming there I think in a sense.
5340576	5345057	That is a really big step because Microsoft kind of – they may think they don't need Netflix.
5345117	5356906	You know, I talk about this every week, and I probably sound like a broken record, but Sony's gonna have to step up really quick, or, you know, a few major announcements, and they're gonna be screwed.
5357707	5360889	I mean, it's gonna, a lot of stuff is gonna happen too quick.
5361089	5373279	You know, Microsoft already has a pretty strong download service for movies and stuff, and if you add Netflix to that as well, where you can be able to pay a subscription per month and download as much shit as you want, um,
5374349	5375710	That's kind of scary.
5376831	5382615	I know Sony's talking about doing something as far as a download service, but they're kind of behind.
5382835	5383896	But we don't know.
5383936	5387579	Just because it's on the board of Microsoft doesn't mean that maybe Netflix teams up with Sony.
5387759	5393463	And that could be a huge boost for Sony, who seems to be finding the majority of their success right now as being a Blu-ray player.
5394063	5395584	It would actually be really good for them.
5396245	5397826	We'll see if it happens.
5398166	5398506	Who knows?
5400408	5400708	Anyhow.
5401254	5405015	It's about time we bring this segment to a close because we've been here for a while now.
5405395	5411236	But before we bring this segment to a close, we have to wrap up by paying a little respect to our elders.
5411276	5415216	And we like to do that through DarkSakura's classic game of the week.
5415656	5420917	So, DarkSakura, why don't you tell us what game you've picked for this week?
5420937	5422758	And I'm actually curious because it's Halloween week.
5422778	5425058	Did you pick something a little Halloween themed for us?
5425418	5429959	Sort of, but actually I was more paying tribute to the release of Dracula X Chronicles.
5430559	5430639	Ah.
5431067	5435910	So I was picking one of my favorite games in the Castlevania series, which would be Kid Dracula.
5436930	5438011	Ah, okay, Kid Dracula.
5438771	5446375	It was released in Japan as Akumajo Special Boku Dracula-kun, which translates to Demon Castle Special.
5446735	5448636	Demon Castle Special, I'm Dracula-kun.
5450097	5454419	He's playing as Alucard, pretty much, only he's Kid Dracula in the game.
5455119	5459942	And it's all super cute, and he has some of the powers that he had in...
5461104	5461884	Symphony of the Night.
5462305	5467387	Actually, the major bad guy in this game ended up being an enemy in Symphony of the Night.
5468228	5471009	So, I love how they just tie in everything.
5471049	5471890	I think it was really great.
5472350	5475631	But it's a fun little, you know, little kid-type platformer.
5475651	5477352	It came out on the Famicom in Japan.
5478573	5483495	Also on the Game Boy.
5483696	5485336	And over here we got it on the Game Boy.
5485356	5486437	I actually own this game.
5486497	5487137	I'm very happy.
5488258	5488338	Um...
5489873	5491214	It has the first level music.
5491234	5493595	I don't know if you can hear it very well.
5498078	5499619	Let me wait for it to get to the part.
5506843	5508264	I missed this game when I was growing up.
5508304	5508904	I never played this.
5510150	5512111	We didn't get it in America.
5512472	5513312	We got it on Game Boy.
5513552	5515094	Oh yeah, I was going to say, I remember it on Game Boy.
5515134	5516174	I remember seeing it somewhere.
5516235	5526062	Yeah, but this is a remix of Beginning from Castlevania III, if anyone recognizes it.
5527163	5529445	The other cool thing about this game is that
5529901	5539952	And I love how Konami does this, is that, um, Kid Dracula was also, um, a playable character, um, in, uh, Gokujo Parodius, which I thought was pretty cool.
5540333	5546300	He was also a hidden selectable character in Jikyo Shiberi Parodius, which is actually my favorite of the Parodius series.
5546540	5548322	Well, I also love chatting Parodius, too, but, um,
5549528	5553211	So, uh, you know, I'll be covering the Proteus series somewhat later.
5553231	5555312	Oh, look, it has, like, the clocks, like, just like Castlevania does.
5555332	5556273	Yeah, you go in the clock tower and everything.
5556313	5564018	It has all of the, a lot of the classic levels that you expect in the old, um, uh, Castlevania games.
5564058	5565179	But it was so cute.
5565599	5566840	It actually was kind of hard.
5567281	5568722	It got really difficult at times.
5568862	5572004	Just like, uh, you know, you have the swinging pendulum and everything, too.
5572765	5573025	Very cool.
5573065	5574246	A chatroom's joining in on this.
5574306	5579469	Escapist says, Kid Dracula made using an umbrella as a weapon badass long before Kirby gave it a shot.
5579930	5580150	Yep.
5580470	5583312	Son of Dad says, the music sounds very upbeat for a Castlevania game.
5583472	5590837	Well, it was more of a parody-style game, but it was actually pretty good for how it played.
5590897	5591397	I loved it.
5591977	5597261	I mean, we're talking about one of my top 20 games, I have to say.
5597701	5597921	Wow.
5598302	5598682	Easy.
5599417	5600058	Thanks for watching!
5620242	5623384	He has this toothy grin the entire time.
5624385	5632049	I'm going to paste a copy of the logo in the chatroom, just because it was adorable.
5633030	5635692	I'm going to post the one off of Wikipedia.
5636432	5638854	Gerardimo says, Polka makes umbrella weapons best.
5639974	5641735	That's a Turtle Sonata reference right there.
5643276	5644937	What is he fighting here, a Klansman?
5645398	5646198	Oh my god, it is!
5646418	5647519	He has a swastika on his head!
5648194	5650615	I swear to God, look at this boss he's fighting here at the end of stage one.
5651255	5651695	Look at this.
5652656	5653636	He's got a little swastika on his head.
5653676	5657378	I think it's supposed to be like... I don't think this is supposed to be Shaft, wasn't it?
5657618	5658658	It looks like a Klansman.
5660459	5661099	That's crazy.
5663540	5666162	Maybe this is a... Doing his part for racial equality.
5666342	5667042	I guess so.
5667082	5668523	He made the Klansman cry and run away.
5668943	5669743	I'm hitting him too much.
5669823	5670223	There you go.
5671944	5672284	Interesting.
5672304	5673345	All right, so there you have it.
5674125	5676126	Kid Dracula, your game of the week.
5676686	5676826	Yep.
5677373	5679814	and I'm probably one of these days going to cover Proteus.
5680434	5681555	And I always say I'm going to.
5681595	5682175	Don't give it away.
5682935	5683796	I didn't say when.
5683976	5684896	I said eventually.
5685236	5686457	Now you're here next week, right?
5686477	5687417	You're still here next week?
5687677	5690338	But it's two weeks that you leave for Alabama?
5690398	5694240	No, I leave actually taking a red eye on Thanksgiving.
5694440	5694760	Gotcha.
5695240	5695781	Okay, okay.
5695801	5697161	So it's going to be a little later in the month.
5697401	5704024	I just wanted to warn the listeners, be careful because when DarkSakura is out of town... I'm going to record my Game of the Week.
5704548	5705568	All you're going to record it?
5705588	5707489	I thought we got to pick in your absence.
5708830	5709550	I'm sneaky.
5710770	5711531	What would you pick?
5711751	5715352	I would definitely go back to the Commodore 64 and dust something off from those archives.
5715432	5715992	I don't know yet.
5716232	5716992	I don't want to spoil it.
5717373	5718713	I do have a game in mind right here.
5718773	5722134	If you're going to go in that direction, then how could I deny anybody that?
