Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Mojo!

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, October 14th, 2007, Nintendo unveils holiday news that includes a dreaded delay,

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
Elder Scrolls Oblivion gets one last hurrah, and we're joined by members of Bizarre Creations

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
to talk about Geometry Wars Galaxy.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.000 --> 00:49.000
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:49.000 --> 00:58.000
We sound a little dead, it's because this is now our third time trying to record the show, and Jamie has-

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Wait, wait a minute, this was empty a minute ago and now it's full again.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
This is Mountain Dew gamer feel that Chris brought for Dark Sakura.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
It's like cocaine.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
What does it taste like?

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
The taste is like sort of like orange cream soda, but the first taste of it is sort of like very orange-y fruit punch,

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
and the aftertaste of it is cream soda.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Interesting.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
It's fairly accurate, wouldn't you say?

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
It tastes like butt. No, I don't know, I didn't like it so much.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Kind of.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Also joining us tonight, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
Hello, since his mic cord does not reach.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
No, it's fine.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
I think they're speaking in two microphones.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
No, I don't need to speak in two microphones.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
Okay, the problem we're having tonight, folks, is that we're down to two microphones.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
The microphone that Loki usually uses died while we were trying to tape live here on this lovely Sunday evening,

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
so Loki's mic is gone.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
So now we're having to share between the five people who are in studio tonight, two microphones.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
So we apologize if there's any audio delays or audio slowing or other audio issues,

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
but this is what happens when you do live radio, folks.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
When things break, you don't have much time to fix it.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
So Loki's over there.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
So yes, Dark Sakura.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
You should put on cam the thing that I gave you today.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
I gave it to my room.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
You're mean.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
I will go get it during a story later, but it's Tengen Fantasy Zone on the NES, the classic Game of the Week last week.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Very good.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
We'll all be seeing what Dark Sakura picked for her Game of the Week this week a little later.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
I don't have $100, though, to buy you the game for this week.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
That's all right.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
We'll get to that in a little bit.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Anyhow, let's introduce our guests who are here in studio for the madness tonight

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
and the third time we're getting to our show.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Say hello once again to Puppy.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Hello.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
And what's ironic is Puppy came back tonight because he didn't get to talk too much last week.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
And now that we're down another microphone, he probably won't get to talk much tonight at all.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
So give it up for Puppy while you can, everybody.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
I'm an attention whore, so say hi to me or whatever.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Ask me questions.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Or talk to me.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
What is your name?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
My name is Black Lab.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
What is your quest?

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Ultimate power.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
What is the airspeed velocity of a swallow...

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
No, forget it.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
God, you guys are crazy.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Is it African or European swallow?

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
I don't know that.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Wow.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
Anyhow, let's also say hello to a very special guest.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
I was surprised.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
I didn't even know she was coming tonight.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
It's Chris, everybody.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Surprise, butt sex!

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Wow.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
Sorry, I got to keep my voice down because it's the acoustics in this room.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
That's all right.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Kind of interesting.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
And Chris is one of the official lesbians of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:50.000 --> 03:58.000
And I'm actually surprised to see her back because I was thinking you were going to be flying to Wisconsin soon, right?

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
Oh, well, I went to GeekCon last week, but that was only for a week.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
And in March I am officially moving to Wisconsin for my school career.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Jamie's helping me.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I am leaving.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
I am going into U-Haul with Chris and I'm leaving.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
She's coming back.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
I am not. Shut up.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
I'm kidding.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
I was trying to be funny.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Oh, okay.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
I'm sorry. I failed at it.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
I failed.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Fail!

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
You're not doing it right.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
You're not doing it right.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
So I'm trying to hang out with you guys as much as possible.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
All right.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Well, it's all good. We're glad to have you here.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
And thank you to Chris for unlocking the explicit tag on tonight's program.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Sorry.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
There you go.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
All right.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I do that.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
All right.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
Anyhow, let's start off with how was your gaming week and we'll take it over to DarkSakura.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
How was your gaming week?

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
It was Ragnarok and it was lots of Ragnarok.

04:54.000 --> 05:01.000
I deleted a character and restarted one and I got two of them past job 50 and I played a lot.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
And I looked at your copy of Every Extend Extra and couldn't find the PSP.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Wow.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
You accomplished a lot.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
And I bought a game and I gave it to you.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Yes.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Fantasy Zone.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
And then I don't have an old school Nintendo to play it on.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
But I have three.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Sweet.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
I will lend you one.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Yay.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Maybe our top loader.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
That would be cool because then I won't have to go to get games to play.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Oh, yeah.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Damn it.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
All right.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Puppy, since you have the mic, how was your gaming week?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
We'll have to do a different order because of the audio issues tonight.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
How was your gaming week, Puppy?

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
I spent too much time playing Halo again.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
But then I also spent the rest of it beta testing the new stuff on WoW that's coming

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
out in a couple weeks.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Don't forget, even with that mic you had to get really close.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
There you go.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
I have to watch the green lines.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
I want big lines.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
So, Halo.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Lots of Halo.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Yeah.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Halo and WoW.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
What's your ratio in Halo?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
More than one.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
That's good.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Mine is less than 0.75.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
That's bad.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
I think I'm like 1.6.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Oh, wow.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
That's pretty good.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
I know.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I'm not that good, though.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
I still suck on occasion.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
All right.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Well, let's move on.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Chris, how was your gaming week?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Wow.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
It was fun.

06:16.000 --> 06:23.000
Megzi finally caved in thanks to peer pressure to get World of Warcraft.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
And she bought me an account for a month.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
So I've been kind of trying to use that up as much as possible to try to make it worth

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
my while.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
So I've been playing a lot of that and dying a lot, which is always a favorite pastime.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Well, honey, Mac.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
So, virtual PC.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Virtual PC doesn't let...

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
I don't have...

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Well, it works on Mac.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I just don't have that much room on my...

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I think that Ragnarok would run on a 486.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
Because it was probably created on one.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
I like my dancing blood elves.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
That's okay.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Dancing blood elves are fun.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
And good for you being Horde.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Yes.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
For the Horde.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
For the Alliance.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Do Draenei.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Who Alliance?

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Draenei are okay.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
I can do Draenei.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Okay.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Because they speak like Russians.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
That's kind of cool.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
That's enough rage.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Loki.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
It was good.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
I played...

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Let's see what I play here.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Halo 3.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
I've gotten actually a little bit further in Legendary.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Now I'm, I think, on the 5th chapter or whatever.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
5 out of 10.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Halfway through the game.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
So it's doing pretty good.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
I just have no idea how the hell I'm going to finish the last part of the game.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
Because that's where the difficulty really ramped up.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
And then, let's see.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Of course, more Saints Row multiplayer.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
That's fun now because we've been playing in the Ultra Dome.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
And we've been trying to jump cars to the top tier.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
And actually have been quite successful at that.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
So now it's who can get to the top tier the quickest.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
And then try to survive without getting hit by rockets.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
That's fun.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
And then, let's see.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
I've also been playing Half Life 2, the Orange Box.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Mainly Portal on that.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
And that's pretty fun.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
I was hoping someone on the show called Orange Lounge Radio would have been playing the Orange Box this week.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Because I know it wasn't me.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Although I think I might have to get it.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
So how is Orange Box?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
It's awesome.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Does it give Orange a good name when we trash it constantly every week?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
It is the worst box art I've ever seen.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
But it's cool, I guess.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
I mean the game itself is pretty good.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
I haven't really touched much of the other parts of the game.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
You know, all other total 5 games on there.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Just mainly Portal.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
But Portal is fun.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
And, I don't know.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Just kind of playing through that a little bit.

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
Then, watching my wife play Puzzle Quest on, you know, the 360.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
Which is, you know, just like Puzzle Quest on everything else.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
And then, I played the Yaris game.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
God, what the fuck?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
I don't even know.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
It's free, but I feel like I'm being ripped off.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
It's, you know, seriously.

09:02.000 --> 09:08.000
Just because it's, I understand why it's free, because there's no way anyone would pay for that shit.

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
I just, it was, it reminded me of like, was it Sonic the Hedgehog 2?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Like the bonus stages and that.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Except really crappy and made no sense.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
And it was just stupid.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
It was horrible.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I tried playing that too.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
I downloaded it and played like about 10 minutes of it and got confused.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
Because it's like, your car has like a tentacle that shoots lasers.

09:30.000 --> 09:38.000
And you have to shoot like flying bird, box birds and toasters or something like that.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
You said the best thing ever.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Tentacles that shoot lasers.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
No, I know.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
You would think this would be the perfect game, right?

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
A car with a tentacle that shoots laser beams at things.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
How fucking rad is that?

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
Yet, somehow this game manages to fuck it up for free.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
By the way, I will not be buying a Yaris because of this game.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
I'm just telling you that much.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
If I had thought about that, you know, see this is the thing now.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
Every time someone thinks about Yaris, they're going to think, man, that sucked.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
So, thank you, you have now associated suck with Yaris.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
I thought they did that already.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
They've just driven that home now.

10:21.000 --> 10:27.000
Alright, so thumbs down on the Yaris game.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
Yeah, it's not worth free.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
It definitely is not worth free.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Yeah, I still want a Prius.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
I want my time back.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Alright, my gaming week.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Folks, today, today was a good day.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
You know why today was a good day?

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
I now have a level 70 druid in Warcraft.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
I dinged 70 today.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Hold on, everybody.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
I want my grats.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Here we go.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Ding.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Wait, where's my grats?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Ding.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Grats.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
There you go.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Thank you.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
God, you guys need training.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Alright.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
And you're going to call yourselves WoW players.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
I'm not a WoW player.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Fuck that shit.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
These two are.

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
I was forced into exile from my dead PC and my butthead husband who won't build me a new one.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
So you know what, I'm taking matters into my own hands and I'm playing Guild Wars.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Grats.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Alright.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
So I hit.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Hey, that's not bad.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
20s part way 70.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Alright, anyway.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
So I did that.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Hooray.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
I'm officially an addict.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
And then I also played Puzzle Quest on Xbox Live with the tiniest text ever.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
You can definitely tell this game is a port from another system, namely the DS.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
And I don't know, for me, the mechanics of the game work a little well on the DS.

11:51.000 --> 11:56.000
But it is kind of fun to be able to play the game humongous, the game itself, not the text,

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
on the TV.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Just kind of kick back, play on the TV.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
And it does have the Xbox Live element, which is kind of cool.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
But I do think the DS is a slightly better version if you're not going to be doing a

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
lot of the Xbox Live battling.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
Just because you can read the text a little better, the interface works better when you

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
don't have to use the control pad to move to the block you want and then hit the button

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
to switch.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
You can just use the stylus to swap the bricks.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
It works a lot easier.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
But otherwise, Puzzle Quest itself is a great game.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
It took Bejeweled and made it like 100 times better by adding this whole competitive element

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
to it.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
So I was very happy with that.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
But one thing to the Xbox Live's credit, it costs about half as much as the DS version.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
And for an arcade title, for an Xbox Live arcade title, especially considering it came

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
out the same week as Yaris, it's definitely one of the better things you can download

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
on Xbox Live Arcade.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
So if you don't have a DS and you like puzzlers at all, I definitely recommend you check out

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Puzzle Quest.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
But if you have a DS, maybe it's worth it to pay the extra 10, 15 bucks so you can have

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
the game on the go and have the better controls.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
So that's Puzzle Quest in a nutshell.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
And then I also played the Yaris game and I was like, WTF.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
LOL.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
BBQ.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
All right.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
What else did you play, Chris?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
I played Dungeons and Dragons.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Nerd.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
And I converted nerd.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
I attacked the darkness.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
No, no, no.

13:14.000 --> 13:21.000
I went to GeekCon in Madison, Wisconsin last week and they had a Dungeons and Dragons table

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
in the RPG room and it was said for beginners and I'm an experienced player, so I just wanted

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
to go in there for the gameplay and maybe help out.

13:28.000 --> 13:34.000
The guy looked at me, like brought in my three core books, my like 75 characters, and he

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
looked so intimidated at me.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
He's like, oh, you play.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
I'm like, yeah.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
This is the only D&D game in this entire convention.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Let's play.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
No, he didn't know.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
He was like, uh.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Let's rock it.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
And he basically, there were so many people that showed up to that game.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
He's like, all right, can you run a game?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
I'm like, yeah.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
And I ended up converting like three other people.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Cool.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Yeah, it was awesome.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
D&D is kind of the roots of video gaming in a way.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
I mean, modern RPGs.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Yeah, Meg Z's friends.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
I'm teaching them how to play, and they all have played all the RPGs, Final Fantasy, World

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
of Warcraft, so they're really good at it.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
But you're still a hardcore nerd for being into that.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Damn.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
All right.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Going to our chat room.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
See that webcam?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Damn right.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Look at that dice right here.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
This is where our chatters always are.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
We're going to start off tonight with NM64 says, Skye, if the text, speaking of Puzzle

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
Quest, is a port of a DS version, how can the text be small?

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
Wouldn't it be like five times bigger along with the rest of the screen?

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
That's what you'd think, but for whatever reason they, you know, certainly they upscaled

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
the graphics.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.800
You're not going to look at like pixelated stuff, okay?

14:41.800 --> 14:42.940
It is HD graphics.

14:42.940 --> 14:45.400
The game looks very nice and has a good art style.

14:45.400 --> 14:49.880
But for whatever reason, they brought in text the size of the DS resolution.

14:49.880 --> 14:50.880
I have no idea.

14:50.880 --> 14:56.180
I would think that it would be a port of the PSP version since it's in a similar aspect

14:56.180 --> 14:57.180
ratio.

14:57.180 --> 14:58.180
Perhaps it is.

14:58.180 --> 14:59.180
I don't know.

14:59.180 --> 15:00.840
I haven't played the PSP version, so it's hard for me to say.

15:00.840 --> 15:02.440
But that would make sense.

15:02.440 --> 15:06.680
But I hope the text in the PSP version isn't that small because you need frickin', it was

15:06.680 --> 15:07.760
like a monocle to read it.

15:07.760 --> 15:08.760
I don't know.

15:08.760 --> 15:09.760
A magnifying glass.

15:09.760 --> 15:10.760
Crazy.

15:10.760 --> 15:11.760
Fucking monocle.

15:11.760 --> 15:12.760
That's right.

15:12.760 --> 15:13.760
You need a fucking monocle.

15:13.760 --> 15:14.760
All right.

15:14.760 --> 15:15.760
The NDA 4.0 is going to suck.

15:15.760 --> 15:16.760
Why?

15:16.760 --> 15:17.760
I heard they're making it like Warcraft.

15:17.760 --> 15:18.760
It is.

15:18.760 --> 15:19.760
And you know what the problem is?

15:19.760 --> 15:20.760
It's worse.

15:20.760 --> 15:24.800
Because instead of them like running around and doing stuff, it's little figures that

15:24.800 --> 15:28.760
you have on the mat and they just move forward.

15:28.760 --> 15:33.660
Are Chinese people going to be farming for gold in D&D 4.0 as well?

15:33.660 --> 15:34.660
No idea.

15:34.660 --> 15:35.660
All right.

15:35.660 --> 15:39.320
Well, those little figurines were cool when they were on their own separate game because

15:39.320 --> 15:42.080
they had those D&D figurines for a few years now.

15:42.080 --> 15:44.800
I used to collect them for my roommates.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.320
Is that like Warhammer?

15:46.320 --> 15:47.320
I am a nerd.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.960
Are those like Warhammer things?

15:49.960 --> 15:50.960
Kind of.

15:50.960 --> 15:51.960
But like the little figures?

15:51.960 --> 15:54.640
And you used the hex charts to move them around and all that crap?

15:54.640 --> 15:57.240
Well, it wasn't a hex chart, it was just little squares.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.240
Squares.

15:58.240 --> 16:00.520
You know, you had little characters.

16:00.520 --> 16:05.560
The guy who runs our game actually uses...

16:05.560 --> 16:10.920
The guy who runs the game that I'm in actually uses a hex map and little figurines.

16:10.920 --> 16:11.920
Fuck that.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.320
It's, you know, it's fuck the hex maps.

16:13.320 --> 16:17.720
It's all about if they survive the fall down the stairs, they win.

16:17.720 --> 16:21.760
That is, just flick those little things off the stairs and they fly and...

16:21.760 --> 16:23.800
Well, I have a suggestion.

16:23.800 --> 16:27.600
How about we move off of D&D?

16:27.600 --> 16:30.760
No disrespect, but we do want to move on with the show, because thanks to all our audio

16:30.760 --> 16:35.320
problems that you didn't hear tonight, if you weren't listening live, we're now 40 minutes

16:35.320 --> 16:37.360
into our program tonight and no news yet.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.680
So really quick, some housekeeping.

16:39.680 --> 16:44.400
You can view a live webcam of our show in progress or an archived webcam of our show

16:44.400 --> 16:46.080
over operator11.com.

16:46.080 --> 16:49.880
You can see our smiling faces all looking at you, waving hello, and doing this program.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.320
So operator11.com.

16:51.320 --> 16:56.600
Also join our live journal and our MySpace, and if you swing this way, you can join our

16:56.600 --> 16:58.120
Facebook communities, too.

16:58.120 --> 17:02.640
We have a presence on all those sites, and we love having folks in our communities.

17:02.640 --> 17:06.840
Also tonight's program, bringing back the interviews with the folks out there who make

17:06.840 --> 17:07.840
the games.

17:07.840 --> 17:11.200
A lot of you guys have given us feedback that you want to hear more interviews, and so we're

17:11.200 --> 17:15.360
very happy tonight to have some representation from Bizarre Creations tonight.

17:15.360 --> 17:17.320
We're going to talk about Geometry Wars Galaxies.

17:17.320 --> 17:22.140
We'll get to that in Part B. For now, though, let's get into the gaming news.

17:22.140 --> 17:26.960
So anyways, big news this week about Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

17:26.960 --> 17:27.960
It's delayed.

17:27.960 --> 17:31.720
Ha ha, no Smash Brothers for Christmas, Timmy.

17:31.720 --> 17:40.000
Anyways, it's going to be coming out now in February on the 10th, and other news, Sonic

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
the Hedgehog's in there.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.840
Oh my God, that's like such a surprise.

17:43.840 --> 17:48.360
Like who would have thought that Sonic the Hedgehog would be on a Wii game?

17:48.360 --> 17:49.360
Really?

17:49.360 --> 17:50.760
Who would have thought?

17:50.760 --> 17:56.600
I mean, you know, it's not like that they have, I don't know, Mario and Sonic at the

17:56.600 --> 17:58.600
Olympics and shit like that.

17:58.600 --> 17:59.960
But anyways, Sonic is in there.

17:59.960 --> 18:03.080
It's pretty cool.

18:03.080 --> 18:04.320
What more can I say?

18:04.320 --> 18:05.920
Although I am not surprised.

18:05.920 --> 18:11.680
In fact, this will be, I'm guessing, the first of many delays to come.

18:11.680 --> 18:16.280
In fact, we had heard, straight from Nintendo, Nintendo recently announced that there will

18:16.280 --> 18:23.280
be an additional 30 days added to most 4th quarter Wii releases due to production issues.

18:23.280 --> 18:27.400
So you'll probably see a lot of Wii titles slipping by 30 days or so.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.360
Uh oh, where is this coming from?

18:30.360 --> 18:31.360
Nintendo?

18:31.360 --> 18:34.600
Oh, okay, sorry.

18:34.600 --> 18:38.680
So okay, so they go and they announce that Sonic is going to actually be in the game,

18:38.680 --> 18:40.520
which is like to no one's surprise, right?

18:40.520 --> 18:44.800
We all figured, okay, they said there were going to be other third party stuff in the

18:44.800 --> 18:48.840
game and so it's no surprise that Sonic is one of them, right?

18:48.840 --> 18:50.080
So what do you guys think?

18:50.080 --> 18:54.200
If that earlier quote is true that there are three third party characters that are going

18:54.200 --> 18:56.980
to show up in the game, who do you think the third is going to be?

18:56.980 --> 18:57.980
If it's true.

18:57.980 --> 18:58.980
I think at this point, actually, it's not true.

18:58.980 --> 19:02.160
I think Sonic's all you're going to get, but what would you think?

19:02.160 --> 19:03.160
Mega Man?

19:03.160 --> 19:04.160
Mega Man?

19:04.160 --> 19:05.160
Anybody?

19:05.160 --> 19:06.160
Anybody?

19:06.160 --> 19:07.160
Anybody else think?

19:07.160 --> 19:08.160
Who's not in there?

19:08.160 --> 19:09.160
Or who's already in there?

19:09.160 --> 19:13.600
Third party is only Snake and Sonic, meaning not Nintendo themselves.

19:13.600 --> 19:19.160
If they kept on the Sega route, I would actually put Knuckles in it.

19:19.160 --> 19:24.260
I would say to make, because now everybody's going like OMG Mario vs. Sonic, I would say

19:24.260 --> 19:29.820
to make the console wars of yesteryear complete, Bonk needs to be the third party character

19:29.820 --> 19:30.820
in the game.

19:30.820 --> 19:31.820
But we'll see.

19:31.820 --> 19:32.820
Sora.

19:32.820 --> 19:36.560
So they're like, okay, hooray, we're going to have Sonic in the game.

19:36.560 --> 19:41.840
Oh, and by the way, we're going to release this game next year on February 10th.

19:41.840 --> 19:57.280
They just ran out of days to tease characters in the Smash dojo, so they're like, fuck,

19:57.280 --> 19:58.280
we need some more time.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.800
Let's just push the game back.

19:59.800 --> 20:09.000
I think I like Cycoon's suggestion of Bomberman, because Bomberman was also one of the NEC,

20:09.000 --> 20:12.120
you know, Hudson main people.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.640
Dr. Tetsuya says Pyramid Head.

20:14.640 --> 20:17.080
That would be awesome, but not going to happen.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.080
I'm sorry.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.080
I nominate Sora or Ash.

20:19.080 --> 20:26.960
I can see them doing Bomberman since they've already had Bomberman Dream Mix TV, so that

20:26.960 --> 20:30.120
pretty much had Snake as well.

20:30.120 --> 20:31.120
Why not?

20:31.120 --> 20:35.440
Yeah, but they can just rip all the fucking moves from that and just throw it in here,

20:35.440 --> 20:39.440
I mean, shit, essentially it was a rip-off of Smash Bros. anyways.

20:39.440 --> 20:43.400
All right, well, if you want to be cooler than all your friends and play Super Smash

20:43.400 --> 20:50.840
Bros. Brawl first, you've got to go to E4ALL, which is being held in LA next week, starting

20:50.840 --> 20:53.000
on October 18th at the LA Convention Center.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.740
Of course, this is the little band-aid, because there was no real E3.

20:57.740 --> 21:00.080
There was many E3s earlier this year.

21:00.080 --> 21:03.960
So this is their throw to try and kind of fill that void.

21:03.960 --> 21:06.120
And of course, Sony and Microsoft are not going to be there.

21:06.120 --> 21:09.240
However, Nintendo is, and Nintendo said, we're going to be there and we're showing off all

21:09.240 --> 21:10.240
of these games.

21:10.240 --> 21:14.200
We're showing off Super Mario Galaxy, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Donkey Kong Barrel Blast,

21:14.200 --> 21:19.960
Battalion Wars 2, Fire Emblem, Wii Zapper, Crossbow Training, Mario Song at the Olympics,

21:19.960 --> 21:26.600
Guitar Hero 3, Rayman Raving Rabbids 2, Resident Evil Umbrella, Ella Ella AAA, Chronicles,

21:26.600 --> 21:31.760
Medal of Honor Heroes 2, Ghost Squad, and on the DS, there's a lot of stuff.

21:31.760 --> 21:35.000
Pokemon, Diamond and Pearl, wait, didn't that come out?

21:35.000 --> 21:36.600
Brain Age, wait, didn't that come out?

21:36.600 --> 21:39.000
Brain Age 2, wait, that came out too.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.080
Zelda Found an Hourglass, actually, that came out.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.200
Nintendogs, you know, that came out too.

21:43.200 --> 21:46.320
Mario Kart, you know, a lot of these games they're showing actually have already come

21:46.320 --> 21:48.320
out, I'm noticing.

21:48.320 --> 21:50.880
They're new.

21:50.880 --> 21:52.920
If they're not new, they're new to you.

21:52.920 --> 21:57.720
But hey, if you want to play them like they're new again, head on over to E4ALL.

21:57.720 --> 22:01.560
Hey, Final Fantasy XII is going to be there, that little spin-off game on the DS.

22:01.560 --> 22:03.440
So there's some new stuff.

22:03.440 --> 22:06.220
They may not be new, but you'll think they are.

22:06.220 --> 22:08.320
They're going to try to fool you.

22:08.320 --> 22:14.200
Well, what is not new, and actually this does not completely surprise me at all, is that

22:14.200 --> 22:18.100
the Wii is not lowering price at all.

22:18.100 --> 22:21.960
It will stay at $249.

22:21.960 --> 22:26.720
And that's because the folks at Nintendo are saying that they're selling them as they make

22:26.720 --> 22:27.720
them.

22:27.720 --> 22:32.200
So they're having absolutely no trouble and seeing no point in lowering the price.

22:32.200 --> 22:36.980
On top of that, I mean, honestly, $249 is not bad for a system.

22:36.980 --> 22:40.760
So basically Nintendo's saying, you know, well, you guys are still buying them, so what

22:40.760 --> 22:41.760
do we need to do any different?

22:41.760 --> 22:44.520
In fact, we're going to increase the price.

22:44.520 --> 22:45.520
You know.

22:45.520 --> 22:46.520
Sucka!

22:46.520 --> 22:47.520
They could.

22:47.520 --> 22:50.560
The direct quote, I think it's funny that this guy's name is George Harrison.

22:50.560 --> 22:57.520
But anyway, who is one of the Nintendo reps, said that we'll stay at $249 for the first

22:57.520 --> 22:58.920
sale of the future.

22:58.920 --> 23:02.340
We are still selling everything we can make.

23:02.340 --> 23:04.160
So hey, you're making money.

23:04.160 --> 23:05.280
You're still selling them.

23:05.280 --> 23:06.280
What the hell?

23:06.280 --> 23:07.280
I know one thing.

23:07.280 --> 23:10.320
I thought George Harrison was leaving Nintendo and going back to being a dead beetle.

23:10.320 --> 23:11.320
What?

23:11.320 --> 23:15.260
I heard, no, I heard, I seriously heard he was leaving Nintendo.

23:15.260 --> 23:17.560
So what, what's going on with it?

23:17.560 --> 23:18.800
It's a bad, okay.

23:18.800 --> 23:19.800
That's the bad joke.

23:19.800 --> 23:26.160
Anyway, look, I was going to say that, um, there, this didn't make the show roll, but

23:26.160 --> 23:32.640
there was conspiracy theories going around that they're, um, one, that they're either,

23:32.640 --> 23:37.040
you know, lowering production so that they're still a shortage going through the holidays

23:37.040 --> 23:43.440
to increase demand on the Wii, um, or because this is also kind of being shown in their

23:43.440 --> 23:47.880
marketing campaign or that they're just making the best of a bad situation.

23:47.880 --> 23:51.880
Because if you notice, their new set of commercials now, the very first thing that starts off

23:51.880 --> 23:56.000
as a, we got one, like it's a big thing, like we got one.

23:56.000 --> 24:01.720
And now, no, you know, we stood up, we started playing, we had fun, you know, we bonded,

24:01.720 --> 24:02.720
all this shit.

24:02.720 --> 24:04.280
But the whole thing is like, we got one.

24:04.280 --> 24:05.680
Oh my God, celebration.

24:05.680 --> 24:07.900
See, that's the, that's the fucking thing.

24:07.900 --> 24:08.900
That's what they're doing.

24:08.900 --> 24:11.300
They're trying to market off of, you know, the shortage thing.

24:11.300 --> 24:16.040
So whether it's intentional or not, they're using it, you know, to their advantage.

24:16.040 --> 24:20.200
And you know what, they probably don't need to anyways, but it's probably a good marketing

24:20.200 --> 24:23.720
campaign because it's just going to increase hype and really that's all that they care

24:23.720 --> 24:32.280
about, although, although there is a part in there that is a little disturbing with

24:32.280 --> 24:33.840
the mother and son.

24:33.840 --> 24:37.880
They're playing some game or something and she's like holding his hand.

24:37.880 --> 24:44.480
It's like, um, was it, uh, we came together or something like, like, oh no,

24:44.480 --> 24:51.040
God, only you people can think that, is that the one that at the very end, the Japanese

24:51.040 --> 24:54.760
guys like can do the controller.

24:54.760 --> 25:03.720
It was really funny when I was, when I was in Wisconsin, um, Megzi's mother was entertaining

25:03.720 --> 25:08.720
some Japanese guests and they looked at, and she's got a Wii and they were looking at it

25:08.720 --> 25:11.480
and you know, Megzi was like, oh yeah, it's a Wii.

25:11.480 --> 25:14.840
And he's like, we've never seen one.

25:14.840 --> 25:20.040
We they were from Chiba, so we actually have the chat room reaction to Loki's little comment

25:20.040 --> 25:23.840
on Wii came together.

25:23.840 --> 25:36.400
Wait, wait to have that clip queued up.

25:36.400 --> 25:45.400
I didn't realize it was going to be like 15 seconds into it.

25:45.400 --> 25:50.960
That's why we don't have a soundboard on the program folks anyways.

25:50.960 --> 25:57.440
In other news and more to get you up on your feet, Wii Fit's coming out to, um, Japan on

25:57.440 --> 26:00.400
December 1st for 8,800 yen.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.920
And of course I'll feature the Wii balance board.

26:02.920 --> 26:06.080
That's approximately $75 US.

26:06.080 --> 26:10.320
And um, yeah, no idea when it's coming out in the US though.

26:10.320 --> 26:15.700
So you'll have to wait your fat asses until, you know, it comes out.

26:15.700 --> 26:18.840
Actually those boards supposedly only hold up to like 300 pounds.

26:18.840 --> 26:22.040
So if you're like, you know, one of those people on the Maury Povich show, uh, you may

26:22.040 --> 26:27.080
not even get to play this game at all, two boards.

26:27.080 --> 26:28.320
One for each hoof.

26:28.320 --> 26:31.880
Wait now how, how many yen was that?

26:31.880 --> 26:32.880
It was 8,800.

26:32.880 --> 26:33.880
8,800 yen.

26:33.880 --> 26:37.900
Now, if you're having difficulty, imagine how much money 8,800 yen is.

26:37.900 --> 26:42.600
Imagine 1 yen 8,800 times.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.920
It's not over 9,000 though, so that's good.

26:44.920 --> 26:47.440
It's like 85 bucks.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.440
Alright.

26:48.440 --> 26:54.440
However, what's coming out right now is the 3.1 update for the Wii.

26:54.440 --> 26:58.080
It's going to have USB keyboard support for everything.

26:58.080 --> 27:02.060
Because remember before, the Wii update only had the limited USB support.

27:02.060 --> 27:03.800
And how long did it take them to do this shit?

27:03.800 --> 27:07.820
Come on, seriously, this should have been in there from the get-go?

27:07.820 --> 27:13.180
And also with the new Wii update, a brand new enhanced everybody votes channel.

27:13.180 --> 27:16.360
And did they make the everybody votes channel interesting again?

27:16.360 --> 27:20.320
Sadly, no, they just added the USB keyboard support to the everybody votes channel.

27:20.320 --> 27:25.040
So if you're actually still voting, of which I can't imagine there's that many people still

27:25.040 --> 27:29.320
voting, but if you are, then, uh, well, you get a new enhanced version and you can submit

27:29.320 --> 27:33.480
your questions now using the keyboard so you can annoy Nintendo even faster with your questions

27:33.480 --> 27:35.680
like what's better, cake or pie?

27:35.680 --> 27:38.840
Cake or death?

27:38.840 --> 27:40.240
What's a better way to die?

27:40.240 --> 27:41.240
Fire?

27:41.240 --> 27:42.240
Boat fire?

27:42.240 --> 27:43.300
You know?

27:43.300 --> 27:47.960
And I encourage people to send their dumb questions to Nintendo because it's funny.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.960
It's really funny.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.520
Funny!

27:51.520 --> 27:55.840
Funny haha or funny oh fuck.

27:55.840 --> 28:01.880
Well for our friends in the UK, we have a few updates to Virtual Console.

28:01.880 --> 28:12.200
You have Super Metroid, dun dun dun, and it is 800 points, uh, uh, 560 or 8 euro.

28:12.200 --> 28:13.200
What?

28:13.200 --> 28:16.840
Okay, Rob's giving me this look, I'm like what?

28:16.840 --> 28:22.480
So yeah, go play Super Metroid, all of you, now!

28:22.480 --> 28:28.080
And then you also get, um, those on the NES, you get Protector Bot 2, Return of the Evil

28:28.080 --> 28:41.800
Forces, known to us as Super Contra, because, Contra came out over there as Protector Bot.

28:41.800 --> 28:43.960
I think it had different sprites too.

28:43.960 --> 28:48.480
Dude, Contra is just awesome, so whatever.

28:48.480 --> 28:49.480
With blood.

28:49.480 --> 28:54.680
Um, going to the chat, I was giggling because NintendoManiac64 says, the best everybody

28:54.680 --> 28:59.160
votes channel question, what's better, the Xbox 360 or Playstation 3?

28:59.160 --> 29:04.720
Uh, let's see, SSA100Matt thinks the Miis will be the last unlockable character in Super

29:04.720 --> 29:09.760
Smash Bros. Brawl, uh, VXJsonXV says the everybody votes channel rules!

29:09.760 --> 29:15.200
I vote every day, says our loyal webmaster, VXJsonXV, so I just made fun of the guy that

29:15.200 --> 29:18.240
hosts our website for nothing, good job Rob.

29:18.240 --> 29:21.840
I thought, I thought Jason had more of a life than that.

29:21.840 --> 29:23.200
You know what, he's just very democratic.

29:23.200 --> 29:24.600
He wants his voice to be known.

29:24.600 --> 29:28.140
He wants people to know who he thinks should win American Idol.

29:28.140 --> 29:31.320
He wants people to know what color is better.

29:31.320 --> 29:33.800
What other kinds of dumbass things did they ask on there?

29:33.800 --> 29:40.520
He wants people to know that he prefers winter over summer, and all that crap, alright.

29:40.520 --> 29:44.640
And uh, Jason Ochs commented, gotta love this like, puppies should die in a boat fire.

29:44.640 --> 29:47.720
I like puppies!

29:47.720 --> 29:51.580
Well, boat fire is okay, at least there's water.

29:51.580 --> 29:58.640
So finally, it seems that Nintendo's going to be turning around this whole lack of stuff

29:58.640 --> 30:05.040
for Wii Online, including, of course they talked about the WiiWare service, and they

30:05.040 --> 30:08.120
made some announcements of new titles that are going to be coming out for the WiiWare

30:08.120 --> 30:21.560
service, including Pokemon Farm, uh, a Crystal Chronicles game called The Young King and

30:21.560 --> 30:28.440
The Promised Land, where you build your own country, and let's see here, also Star Soldier

30:28.440 --> 30:34.440
R, and Dr. Mario Wii, that's also going to be coming out as well.

30:34.440 --> 30:38.740
Of course, no dates yet as far as when we're going to see them in the US, or pretty much

30:38.740 --> 30:41.840
anywhere on Earth.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.520
Imagine next year at some point.

30:43.520 --> 30:48.400
Other games announced as well, um, there was Mina de Puzloop, which came out over here

30:48.400 --> 30:55.760
as Magnetica, it's a rip-off of Zuma, and um, then also of course, there was a game

30:55.760 --> 31:03.400
called Maruboushikaku, and that's um, some weird thing that involves screens displaying

31:03.400 --> 31:07.640
uh, different patterns, circle, line, and square based, and no idea what the fuck that

31:07.640 --> 31:08.640
is.

31:08.640 --> 31:16.160
Ah, anyways, and of course, those are only um, kind of um, a little um, sampling of what's

31:16.160 --> 31:20.600
going to be coming, Nintendo says that there is going to be over a hundred WiiWare games

31:20.600 --> 31:26.160
that have been proposed to them, and who knows, we'll see some good original content coming

31:26.160 --> 31:27.160
in 2008.

31:27.160 --> 31:33.120
Um, I was going to say, there was one other thing too that they um, showed off there,

31:33.120 --> 31:38.640
um, real quick, one of which of course was that um, was it the Wii Contest channel or

31:38.640 --> 31:44.320
something like that, the you know, Me Is Your Me Hot or Not type shit, that was being shown

31:44.320 --> 31:45.320
on there.

31:45.320 --> 31:49.920
Also, there's going to be a DS um, download channel as well, but it's actually going to

31:49.920 --> 31:54.280
be called like, I believe the Nintendo channel, where you can download DS demos to stream

31:54.280 --> 32:00.240
to your um, DS of course over the Wii, um, using the download play, and also they're

32:00.240 --> 32:06.020
going to have videos and possibly later on, Wii game demos, so, fuck yeah, it's about

32:06.020 --> 32:08.020
fucking time.

32:08.020 --> 32:13.920
And uh, yeah I know, when they asked Nintendo how many WiiWare games would be available

32:13.920 --> 32:18.840
next year, they said, OVER NINE THOUSAND!

32:18.840 --> 32:20.880
I mean seriously, a hundred, that's a lot.

32:20.880 --> 32:25.880
Um, let's see, uh, Color of Sakura in our chatroom says uh, maybe the channel should

32:25.880 --> 32:30.240
be called My Pokemans, Let Me Show You Them, the My Pokemans, Let Me Show You Them channel.

32:30.240 --> 32:32.240
I hear you like mudkips.

32:32.240 --> 32:37.200
Yes, and we should understand that you have a mudkip, I don't like to trade your mudkip

32:37.200 --> 32:38.200
from my pillup.

32:38.200 --> 32:45.000
And that pillup turns into a big buttfucker penguin, but that pillup turns into a big

32:45.000 --> 32:48.440
buttfucker penguin, to quote my girlfriend.

32:48.440 --> 32:53.440
Anyhow, so WiiWare, lots of stuff coming out for the WiiWare.

32:53.440 --> 32:55.440
Also another game coming out, Wii Music.

32:55.440 --> 33:00.520
Now a lot of us saw this game at the very first time we saw the Wii at E3 2006, remember

33:00.520 --> 33:03.780
that was, you know, remember when uh, I think it was Miyamoto came out on stage, he's conducting

33:03.780 --> 33:05.920
the orchestra, da da da, what?

33:05.920 --> 33:11.480
Uh, no, that was Miyamoto on the thing, but I saw um, Koji Kondo playing a guy's autograph.

33:11.480 --> 33:15.440
Yeah, I mean, and throughout the show they had like the guy's drumming or whatever, well,

33:15.440 --> 33:19.520
now it actually is going to be this fleshed out music title, it's called Wii Music, and

33:19.520 --> 33:23.120
uh, actually they've released some screenshots, you can see here, here's a bunch of Miis playing

33:23.120 --> 33:26.600
a variety of instruments like a xylophone, a guitar, a trumpet, all kind of standing

33:26.600 --> 33:27.600
out in a field.

33:27.600 --> 33:32.360
Um, so even though it was kind of a tech demo now, now there's this whole new, you know,

33:32.360 --> 33:33.880
version of the concept.

33:33.880 --> 33:37.360
Basically what you're going to be able to do, you can control up to six band members

33:37.360 --> 33:40.280
and use both motions and button presses.

33:40.280 --> 33:44.180
There's forty different types of instruments in the game and you can pretty much mix and

33:44.180 --> 33:45.180
match your band.

33:45.180 --> 33:48.980
Uh, supposedly the game's going to have a variety of different music styles and multiplayer

33:48.980 --> 33:51.560
mode featuring four players.

33:51.560 --> 34:01.280
I want a band that has a zither, a harmonica, a melodica, um, an autoharp, and uh, one snare

34:01.280 --> 34:02.720
drum.

34:02.720 --> 34:09.400
I would like Nintendo to know that if this game does not have a didgeridoo, it sucks.

34:09.400 --> 34:13.360
Seriously, like, you better fuckin' have a didgeridoo in this game, because I want

34:13.360 --> 34:15.360
Nothing to do with it if I cannot have my

34:19.000 --> 34:22.120
And and and a flugelhorn

34:24.680 --> 34:26.680
Anyway

34:31.160 --> 34:36.340
It has to have a cowbell so we need a band that with a didgeridoo a zither a

34:36.340 --> 34:41.940
a cowbell a flugelhorn a sitar

34:44.060 --> 34:48.340
And a harmonica and this is why we don't let you guys make music

34:49.220 --> 34:54.300
Hey, I can play saxophone and clarinet. Hey, thanks to thanks to Mac

34:54.300 --> 34:57.940
I am a certified musician with my garage band and iMovies

34:57.940 --> 35:07.780
Oh, they caught that on camera too crap. Hey, I have a story son of dad would like there to be a skin flute in the game that you can play

35:08.580 --> 35:12.180
Dude, you don't need a video round of human screams. Is that an instrument?

35:12.180 --> 35:18.900
No, no, no, no, no, no if you need a game for that then you need to do if there's there's simple steps

35:20.300 --> 35:22.100
Stand up

35:22.100 --> 35:26.820
Go to your door open it walk out close the closing the doors optional

35:26.820 --> 35:31.900
Go through the appropriate hallway to get to your front door open it step out leave

35:33.140 --> 35:36.180
experience nature real life

35:37.940 --> 35:39.940
Get laid I

35:41.020 --> 35:45.220
Highly recommend. Okay this coming from the bitch who wants a sitar and we music

35:46.740 --> 35:50.860
Well an electric sitar cuz the tars are sexy anyway

35:52.300 --> 35:54.300
That's explicit on chat

35:54.300 --> 35:58.940
You know, we've we were explicit from the moment. You said surprise butt sex. I

36:01.700 --> 36:04.820
Think I make the explicit so shall I continue

36:05.860 --> 36:10.740
For anyone who's looking forward to the new Mario Kart and you are going to be able to play up to

36:11.180 --> 36:18.220
12 players online on Mario Kart Wii which will officially make it the biggest Mario Kart of ours

36:18.220 --> 36:25.780
As long as you do it, right and as long as there's not two people on the car at the same time because that

36:25.980 --> 36:28.700
That's just gonna be bad memories. I don't want to revisit

36:30.460 --> 36:32.460
And also there's like

36:33.160 --> 36:39.060
So now it's like project Gotham four. Yeah. Okay. I tried playing the motorbikes and project Gotham for not pretty

36:39.060 --> 36:44.580
I'm really bad at project Gotham racing and like watching me race the motorbike

36:44.580 --> 36:50.060
In project Gotham four it was like watching me learn how to ride a bike for the first time was I only left

36:51.060 --> 36:56.940
Right and then I fall off and collapse in a big heap and my bike falls on top of me to add insult to injury

36:57.060 --> 36:59.780
Thank You project Gotham for making me feel like a bad driver

37:01.260 --> 37:03.260
But yeah, there will be bikes

37:03.860 --> 37:05.500
which it's like

37:05.500 --> 37:12.180
Why the fuck do you need bikes? I mean the game was fine as Mario Kart. It's not Mario Kart and stuff. I mean seriously

37:12.180 --> 37:13.460
um

37:13.460 --> 37:16.440
Anyways, so Mario and Sonic at the Olympics

37:16.440 --> 37:19.660
They've already announced a bunch of really cool characters that you can play as but fuck that

37:19.660 --> 37:24.980
Let's play as myself because you can play as your own me in the game because you know

37:24.980 --> 37:29.560
Hey, fuck all the time that you know takes to actually put these wonderful characters in the game

37:29.580 --> 37:33.620
Let's just have some dick put his own stupid me in there and play as himself

37:34.940 --> 37:36.220
Hooray

37:36.220 --> 37:40.340
Fuck that ain't buying the game. Anyways, it's the fucking Olympics. You're gonna trick me this time

37:40.340 --> 37:48.340
Hey, I like this idea because now like we can find out who's better me or Mario me who's faster me or Sonic me. I

37:49.140 --> 37:54.460
Can now prove that I'm the best thing ever with my me, right?

37:56.940 --> 37:58.940
It's all about me yeah, that's all about me

38:00.500 --> 38:08.040
Anyhow, if you're you know one game that I'm glad my me cannot be put into is a resin evil umbrella chronicles

38:08.040 --> 38:10.720
Because I would not want to die in this game

38:10.840 --> 38:14.240
Get shot or what have you or get my brains eaten by zombies

38:14.400 --> 38:19.620
But what you can get with the resin evil umbrella chronicles is the Wii Zapper. That's right

38:19.620 --> 38:22.340
There's actually going to be a Wii Zapper combo

38:22.940 --> 38:26.760
Coming out and although right now it looks like it's only coming out in Japan

38:26.760 --> 38:31.040
You never know if you cross your fingers hold your breath. It might come out over here on states

38:31.040 --> 38:35.860
I'm not gonna happen. Why is that because it's not gonna happen. It's Japan gets all the cool shit

38:35.860 --> 38:39.760
All right. Well, they also get with this cool shit called the expert package a

38:40.400 --> 38:45.040
28-page book called Wesker's extra report and they also get stickers

38:46.760 --> 38:48.760
Because who doesn't love stickers

38:49.320 --> 38:51.320
Well, I love this in zombie pew pew

38:52.440 --> 39:00.240
Anyway, well one thing though about the special editions is that when we got one biohazard code Veronica came out over here

39:00.240 --> 39:06.800
Well, we didn't get the big briefcase that had the Wesker's files and everything and Dan and I were tempted to order it

39:07.040 --> 39:10.100
however, what they did after the fact was

39:11.200 --> 39:18.280
Release the Wesker report as a special disk like a free giveaway and I got like a bunch of them

39:18.560 --> 39:25.220
But you know, I think that we're gonna get the stuff. It's just not gonna be in the cool ass bundle. So

39:26.080 --> 39:28.080
anyway

39:28.080 --> 39:31.000
something that is happy a face is

39:32.440 --> 39:34.440
It's it's O face anyway

39:35.000 --> 39:36.840
is if you

39:36.840 --> 39:43.520
get contra for you are getting contra not just that you're getting contra super C and

39:46.120 --> 39:53.120
The protector bot from the UK version Rob stop having Pikachu fuck

39:53.120 --> 39:59.200
I'm just entertaining our op 11 people before they get cut off, but I'm listening

40:01.560 --> 40:07.240
The op 11 feed limits us to 40 minutes a recording so anyway, so

40:08.760 --> 40:10.760
So you get

40:11.440 --> 40:13.300
Stop it

40:13.300 --> 40:15.120
so you get

40:15.120 --> 40:21.840
Contra super C and you get the protector bot so I bet you're happy and our calories and comics and all that fun shit

40:21.840 --> 40:23.840
I don't know about the comics but

40:24.200 --> 40:26.160
fun shit

40:26.160 --> 40:27.480
anyways

40:27.480 --> 40:32.660
So other things that you're gonna get including this week lots of fun games coming out

40:33.960 --> 40:37.880
including one game that's kind of infamous with this show a

40:38.440 --> 40:42.360
certain game on the Xbox 360 to which you roll around a

40:42.880 --> 40:44.880
ball will call it and

40:44.880 --> 40:52.880
You roll over objects and you're let's call them the prints and yeah, so beautiful katamari is coming out on Xbox 360

40:53.760 --> 40:55.560
hooray

40:55.560 --> 40:59.440
Of course other things coming out this week. There's gonna be

41:00.960 --> 41:05.960
Some interesting stuff on the Wii including rock stars table tennis

41:06.440 --> 41:10.560
Which I heard really sucked on the Wii Mercury meltdown revolution

41:11.280 --> 41:13.480
20 bucks that's not bad for that game

41:13.480 --> 41:18.080
Um, guilty gear double X accent core. That should be pretty cool

41:19.040 --> 41:24.040
Victoria's boxers. So if you're looking for like an anime Mike Tyson's punch-out, maybe

41:26.840 --> 41:30.640
It sounds like Victoria's secret is that she actually wears boxers

41:32.120 --> 41:38.160
Victoria's not Victoria boxers. I thought you said Victoria's no, I was thinking Tori is it's

41:39.200 --> 41:41.200
anyways

41:41.200 --> 41:48.720
So, um other stuff coming out Tony Hawk's proving ground on almost everything, you know, PlayStation 2 360 we PlayStation 3

41:49.760 --> 41:51.720

Avatar the burning earth that's coming out on almost everything as well

41:56.920 --> 41:58.680
Elder Scrolls oblivion

41:58.680 --> 42:05.520
The shivering Alice expansions coming out on like a disc version for Xbox 360 as well as oblivion the game of the year edition is

42:15.000 --> 42:20.160
For those who don't remember the game originally came out back in June on everything else or actually

42:20.160 --> 42:22.680
I think may on everything else and it sucked

42:23.920 --> 42:27.400
Let's see SWAT target liberties coming down PSP as well

42:28.120 --> 42:31.240
Crash of the Titans is finally getting its PSP version coming out

42:31.240 --> 42:37.800
Uh, let's see here backyard football 2008. Don't touch that game. It's horrible

42:39.520 --> 42:43.600
Let's see here and then on PC there's a whole bunch of

42:44.200 --> 42:48.800
Crap, and then let's see here theories coming out. So that's gonna be pretty cool

42:50.760 --> 42:57.880
Flight deck five, you know, it looks like shit zoo tycoon too because where would we be without a tycoon game each week and

42:57.880 --> 43:04.080
And finally, let's see here on the DS world with drafts flash focus vision training

43:04.080 --> 43:09.800
yes, another fucking training game that Nintendo is gonna sucker you into buying because you're blind without it and

43:10.440 --> 43:14.440
Disney Princess magical jewels is gonna be coming out on the DS. I

43:15.200 --> 43:21.920
Do not want to see the princesses magical jewels because that sounds just really wrong and this I'm sure will make a certain shatter happy

43:21.920 --> 43:29.640
Hannah Montana music jam on the DS. Fuck the chatters. I'm happy

43:31.280 --> 43:37.200
Are you paying $2,000 for a concert ticket? No, I'm not that I'm not stupid. I'm happy not stupid

43:39.400 --> 43:47.720
What it's it's a wonderful game it's like jam sessions except well you can I don't know

43:47.720 --> 43:49.720
I

43:52.560 --> 43:54.560
See it like on CNN like four times

43:55.960 --> 43:59.440
Concert tickets are getting sold by scalpers real quick though

43:59.440 --> 44:05.180
And one other thing on the PC heroes of might and magic five tribes of the East that expansions finally coming out as well

44:05.640 --> 44:12.160
So that is pretty much everything. Well, then let's go to Japan and see what our friends overseas are getting this week

44:12.280 --> 44:16.120
They are also getting a game. You may have heard of on this program

44:16.120 --> 44:18.240
Before we had to get rid of it

44:18.240 --> 44:25.480
Beautiful Katamari Damacy ships in Japan on October 18th on the Xbox 360 another game coming out on the Xbox 360

44:26.040 --> 44:32.200
Zoids alternative not zoinks but Zoids alternative and it kind of looks like a cyborg type game

44:32.200 --> 44:36.400
But what I find very interesting is that the box art totally has Final Fantasy font

44:36.560 --> 44:41.040
But yeah, it has like it totally looks like a Final Fantasy game yet

44:41.040 --> 44:48.700
It's nothing to do with Final Fantasy Zoids is like it's a Takara game and Takara is responsible for transformers over there

44:48.700 --> 44:53.700
Zoids is like a I don't know. I call it a ripoff of like fucking I

44:54.300 --> 44:55.780
don't know like

44:55.780 --> 44:58.200
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers or maybe even like

45:01.500 --> 45:05.180
Exactly and I'd say maybe even also ripoff of Voltron a little bit

45:05.180 --> 45:11.460
Which is also Japanese. Power Rangers destroyed my childhood. Hitstun in our chat room would like to remind us

45:11.460 --> 45:14.140
They've been making Zoids games since the NES.

45:15.060 --> 45:20.620
I would also like to point out with all the ripping off thing and Rob bringing up the Final Fantasy font that it was Yoshitaka

45:20.620 --> 45:25.940
Amano who was in part responsible for us having the whole transforming team whatever mecha

45:26.660 --> 45:30.460
Genre to begin with so he's responsible for the rape of my childhood

45:30.460 --> 45:36.300
He did the character he did the character designs for a kagaki ninja taigachiman. I don't care what anyone says Trini was hot

45:37.660 --> 45:42.420
Also hot is Tobey Maguire starring in spider-man 3 coming out on the PlayStation 3

45:43.820 --> 45:51.240
See how I took it right back on track. I like the Japanese. Yes. Well because it's the Japanese version

45:51.240 --> 45:57.540
That's why the box says Japanese writing go figure coming out. It's interesting. I don't see that every day PlayStation 3

45:57.540 --> 46:04.420
I don't panic see man to notice that is a see man not

46:04.980 --> 46:06.980
The other thing okay

46:08.260 --> 46:14.240
No no no no Dan, and I sat around with our dreamcast talking to our C man for how long

46:14.240 --> 46:24.920
How often do you talk to Dan C man Dan was the one who taught to our C man

46:27.200 --> 46:29.520
And then they turned into in demand frogs

46:32.960 --> 46:34.960
Make it stop Wow

46:35.400 --> 46:40.320
Which that sound you hear is millions of listeners across America throwing up into their mouths

46:40.320 --> 46:44.320
There you go all

46:46.120 --> 46:53.040
Right well sure you do you know you can import this into America the bundle for C man to for the PlayStation 2

46:53.120 --> 46:58.160
The full title C man to pay King Genjin. He could see kit is coming out this week

46:58.160 --> 47:01.940
It's gonna cost you 90 bucks if you want to import that sucker, but that comes with a microphone

47:01.940 --> 47:06.680
So you can you know yell at your C man? What is it? I'm sorry. I've never played that

47:06.680 --> 47:12.120
C man first of all when it came out over here. It was narrated by Leonard Nimoy, and that was really cool

47:12.120 --> 47:14.240
Um you you start off with these

47:14.880 --> 47:19.600
These eggs, and you grow them into tadpoles, and they eventually grow human faces and you

47:25.280 --> 47:31.920
Isn't that kind of like the other kind of C man does that to allow me to continue I grant the permission

47:31.920 --> 47:40.760
And so I'm gonna take the mic away from Rob see I like having two mics now cuz he can tell Rob to SDF you

47:42.880 --> 47:49.000
Anyway, so um they speak this own little like nonsense language, and you talk to them and

47:49.800 --> 47:54.240
Eventually they start talking back and they build their vocabulary as you talk to them

47:54.240 --> 47:57.900
And then they start speaking in this distinguished sort of posh British accent

47:58.960 --> 47:59.960
and

47:59.960 --> 48:07.040
then decide and then that you have conversations with them, and they ask you questions, and then they remember the things that you've answered and

48:07.720 --> 48:10.880
You you know they ask you your birthday, and you speak back and forth to them

48:10.880 --> 48:17.840
And you monitor their habitat make sure the water is right feed them every day, but eventually they start eating each other

48:22.640 --> 48:25.080
Fantastic or like one will die or something

48:25.080 --> 48:30.080
Okay, so it's like Pokemon in the Sims combined, but you talk to them

48:32.720 --> 48:33.720
No

48:33.720 --> 48:36.760
They they have every this program in that is very interesting

48:36.760 --> 48:39.880
How is this game not shown up on my radar in the years?

48:39.880 --> 48:43.700
So we've been doing orange lounge radio five and a half years, and I've never heard of this game

48:43.700 --> 48:47.880
What the hell do you want to borrow mine? I think so. Do you have a working VMU I?

48:48.720 --> 48:52.920
Actually, I do okay. I still have my child. I have the Dreamcast hooked up in the garage

48:52.920 --> 48:54.920
I can play C man all night long

48:55.600 --> 48:57.600
at any rate as

48:58.280 --> 49:01.300
As you as you progress through the game you have another tank

49:01.300 --> 49:02.200
That's a terrarium

49:02.200 --> 49:09.620
So you're actually growing another environment and after a while your C man's gonna start floundering around and start turning into a cocoon

49:09.620 --> 49:18.620
And

49:18.620 --> 49:25.180
Then and then you you eventually move the cocoon into the terrarium and it hatches into a frog man

49:25.180 --> 49:28.180
And then he leaves and the game is over

49:30.580 --> 49:36.200
See and then in a sequel game you actually your your guy turns into a caveman and so

49:36.200 --> 49:39.920
So, thus the cycle starts all over again.

49:39.920 --> 49:40.920
Think about it.

49:40.920 --> 49:45.800
So he turns into a caveman so he can do Geico commercials.

49:45.800 --> 49:49.200
There's a series about that now.

49:49.200 --> 49:50.200
Like an actual TV series.

49:50.200 --> 49:53.560
And they stole that from Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer on Saturday Night Live.

49:53.560 --> 49:55.800
Why did you all have to remind us about that show?

49:55.800 --> 49:58.080
I mean, just when I purged it from my memory.

49:58.080 --> 49:59.080
So, my turn, right?

49:59.080 --> 50:00.080
Or do you have more stuff?

50:00.080 --> 50:01.760
No, I have more stuff, actually.

50:01.760 --> 50:05.400
We got sidetracked by C-Man, but the sequel to C-Man is coming out on the PlayStation

50:05.400 --> 50:06.400
video.

50:06.400 --> 50:07.400
Okay.

50:07.400 --> 50:10.200
Galaxy Angel 2 Mugen Kairou no Kage is coming out.

50:10.200 --> 50:13.360
I have no idea what the hell this game is, but you know it's cool because it's by a company

50:13.360 --> 50:15.880
called Broccoli.

50:15.880 --> 50:17.840
Broccoli did Digicarrot.

50:17.840 --> 50:19.880
Ah, very cool.

50:19.880 --> 50:20.880
Well there you go.

50:20.880 --> 50:23.840
So, from the people who brought you Digicarrot.

50:23.840 --> 50:31.340
So Sonic Rush Adventure is coming out on the Nintendo DS from Sega and also in Japan this

50:31.340 --> 50:38.180
week on the PSP Riviera Yasuko No Chi Special Edition is coming out.

50:38.180 --> 50:41.040
And it looks like another game based off an anime, surprise surprise.

50:41.040 --> 50:42.240
That's it.

50:42.240 --> 50:43.780
My turn.

50:43.780 --> 50:45.960
And coming out over in the UK.

50:45.960 --> 50:51.120
On the 16th, Warmonger Operation Downtown Destruction, 17th Speedball 2 Brutal Deluxe.

50:51.120 --> 50:53.920
Everything else is coming out on the 19th.

50:53.920 --> 50:59.180
Eternal Sonata for Xbox 360 Football Manager 2008, which by the way is real football and

50:59.180 --> 51:01.560
not the shit we have in America.

51:01.560 --> 51:07.480
Galactic Assault Half Life 2 Episode 2, King of Clubs, Lair, Life Science Hospital Affairs

51:07.480 --> 51:13.880
Luminous Arc, Myst, Naruto Ultimate Ninja, Naruto Ultimate Ninja 2, like they get the

51:13.880 --> 51:18.240
game and then they get the sequel the same day, why?

51:18.240 --> 51:24.360
Portal on Xbox 360, Pursuit Force Extreme Justice, Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis.

51:24.360 --> 51:29.760
Didn't that already come out?

51:29.760 --> 51:30.960
They're just getting Portal.

51:30.960 --> 51:35.160
I would just buy Portal and skip Half Life altogether.

51:35.160 --> 51:41.520
Also Tabula Rasa on PC, Team Fortress 2, The Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass, The Orange

51:41.520 --> 51:46.360
Box on Xbox 360, why did they get an option of getting Portal?

51:46.360 --> 51:47.520
I don't know.

51:47.520 --> 51:49.860
I think it might be a typo.

51:49.860 --> 51:52.720
You can buy it standalone here but only on PC.

51:52.720 --> 51:57.960
You can get it through Steam, bastards.

51:57.960 --> 52:02.160
Thrillville Off the Rails also coming out on damn near everything else.

52:02.160 --> 52:07.960
Oh yeah, I forgot Thrillville Off the Rails is also coming out in the US.

52:07.960 --> 52:10.760
It's fun, you get to make people hurl.

52:10.760 --> 52:15.920
Anyways, something else that's coming out here pretty soon and fortunately is the last

52:15.920 --> 52:22.800
in the long line of download content for Oblivion is the brand new Fighter's Stronghold.

52:22.800 --> 52:32.040
It is the same price as a Yaris Xbox Live Arcade game but way better and will be coming

52:32.040 --> 52:33.040
out.

52:33.040 --> 52:41.080
It's actually going to be free beginning on October 15th but it's only free for a week.

52:41.080 --> 52:42.080
Make sure you download it.

52:42.080 --> 52:47.040
It's the last bit of download content you're going to see for Oblivion so what a way to

52:47.040 --> 52:50.960
close it off for free.

52:50.960 --> 52:51.960
Here you go.

52:51.960 --> 52:55.520
This show actually will go to its podcast form on the 15th which is the way most people

52:55.520 --> 52:57.880
listen to the program so go check Xbox Live.

52:57.880 --> 52:58.880
It should be up now.

52:58.880 --> 53:01.040
Friendly reminder from the folks here at OLR.

53:01.040 --> 53:06.120
Also the other thing, here's some of the cool features though that the Fighter's Stronghold

53:06.120 --> 53:07.400
comes with.

53:07.400 --> 53:14.600
You can get your own vinter to create your own wines for you.

53:14.600 --> 53:21.960
You have a combat trainer, a taxidermist to create trophies for your pad.

53:21.960 --> 53:23.960
I think there is some other stuff.

53:23.960 --> 53:29.280
Basically you get this whole castle to run after you do a little quest to get so fucking

53:29.280 --> 53:30.280
awesome.

53:30.280 --> 53:34.920
That would be so cool to just fill my castle with a bunch of dead bears.

53:34.920 --> 53:37.840
Seriously, how is Elder Scrolls V going to top Oblivion?

53:37.840 --> 53:40.200
I don't know.

53:40.200 --> 53:44.320
This is literally saying, look, we're going to give you the kitchen sink in this game.

53:44.320 --> 53:45.320
It's everything.

53:45.320 --> 53:46.320
It's amazing.

53:46.320 --> 53:47.320
It is amazing.

53:47.320 --> 53:49.840
I have all my cat on my wall.

53:49.840 --> 53:50.840
It's a video game, Chris.

53:50.840 --> 53:52.840
You don't actually have to have real pets on your wall.

53:52.840 --> 53:57.640
I know, but it's only fun to kill the sim pets.

53:57.640 --> 53:58.640
But still.

53:58.640 --> 53:59.640
You're so difficult to please.

53:59.640 --> 54:05.920
As a sim, you can't throw fireballs at things.

54:05.920 --> 54:09.480
I'll tell you what, Chris, there's nothing funner in Oblivion than throwing fireballs

54:09.480 --> 54:14.280
at the sheep constantly, and then they start to attack you.

54:14.280 --> 54:16.600
They figure out you're a bad man.

54:16.600 --> 54:17.920
If they live long enough.

54:17.920 --> 54:20.800
That is awesome.

54:20.800 --> 54:24.160
When sheep attack.

54:24.160 --> 54:25.480
It's pretty bad.

54:25.480 --> 54:31.200
All right, as was that joke.

54:31.200 --> 54:32.800
Moving on.

54:32.800 --> 54:36.600
Sierra Online, also Vivendi Games, is a part of that.

54:36.600 --> 54:40.360
They have given us some more details about what is coming out on Xbox Live Arcade and

54:40.360 --> 54:42.840
PC through the rest of the year.

54:42.840 --> 54:48.280
There is a third person retro arcade shooter called Aces of the Galaxy.

54:48.280 --> 54:50.720
There's another title called Boogie Bunnies.

54:50.720 --> 54:54.840
This is a game where players match rabbits in a match three puzzle game.

54:54.840 --> 54:58.040
Those are both coming out on the PC and Xbox Live Arcade.

54:58.040 --> 54:59.040
Rabbit threesomes?

54:59.040 --> 55:01.720
I don't even want to go there.

55:01.720 --> 55:07.840
Coming from Wanako Studios, an Xbox Live arcade shooter, Assault Heroes, that of course I

55:07.840 --> 55:11.420
believe was already on the Xbox Live Arcade.

55:11.420 --> 55:17.140
It's going to retail shelves on the PC for $19.99.

55:17.140 --> 55:25.080
Also coming out, Arcadian Warriors, and 33 Scar, Resurrection Ship, Exodus, and the one

55:25.080 --> 55:28.800
some people have been looking forward to or not looking forward to because it may bastardize

55:28.800 --> 55:34.040
what they know and love, Battlestar Galactica, where you can play as the humans or the Cylons.

55:34.040 --> 55:39.280
Sixteen player online gaming on the PC, eight players on Xbox Live Arcade, even though the

55:39.280 --> 55:43.760
early reviews on that were mediocre at best, but they've had a long time since then.

55:43.760 --> 55:46.080
I'm sure that was an early version, so you never know in my head.

55:46.080 --> 55:47.080
Who knows?

55:47.080 --> 55:48.080
Let's be fair.

55:48.080 --> 55:49.080
Time makes games better.

55:49.080 --> 55:50.080
You never know.

55:50.080 --> 55:51.080
You never know.

55:51.080 --> 55:53.280
That's what we're all hoping with Smash Brothers Brawl, right?

55:53.280 --> 55:54.280
Right?

55:54.280 --> 55:55.280
Right.

55:55.280 --> 55:56.280
We'll see.

55:56.280 --> 55:59.400
Speaking of a geek as I am, I never got into Battlestar Galactica.

55:59.400 --> 56:00.400
Well...

56:00.400 --> 56:01.400
Jamie, show me the way.

56:01.400 --> 56:02.400
Hang your head in shame.

56:02.400 --> 56:06.040
Actually, I haven't watched any at all Battlestar Galactica since the one from the 70s.

56:06.040 --> 56:07.040
Oh, okay.

56:07.040 --> 56:10.080
Well, I don't feel so bad now.

56:10.080 --> 56:11.080
But I have...

56:11.080 --> 56:12.080
Ladies, I have season one and two if you need it.

56:12.080 --> 56:14.000
But I has Doctor Who.

56:14.000 --> 56:21.400
Anyway, anyone who cares, Speedball 2 is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade.

56:21.400 --> 56:25.720
I care, Jamie.

56:25.720 --> 56:31.940
And I think this is funny that it was referred to like this on Joystiq, that it's like Calvin

56:31.940 --> 56:35.840
Ball for anyone who reads Calvin and Hobbes.

56:35.840 --> 56:39.720
Calvin Ball is the game where you make up your own rules as you go.

56:39.720 --> 56:42.820
I demand euphoria.

56:42.820 --> 56:45.960
So yeah, Calvin Ball the game.

56:45.960 --> 56:49.000
Anyways, let's see here.

56:49.000 --> 56:55.360
For those who may not be into Calvin Ball, there are some other tidbits on Xbox Live

56:55.360 --> 57:00.780
Marketplace that you might be interested in, including a whole fucking ton of demos.

57:00.780 --> 57:04.320
The Simpsons game is actually on there now.

57:04.320 --> 57:05.320
Definitely check it out.

57:05.320 --> 57:07.320
I forgot I did play that this week.

57:07.320 --> 57:08.320
Awesome.

57:08.320 --> 57:09.320
Awesome game.

57:09.320 --> 57:12.280
If you're a Simpsons fan, you're going to love it.

57:12.280 --> 57:16.760
Which, of course, is based off the movie and comic series, and it's supposed to be very,

57:16.760 --> 57:17.760
very bloody.

57:17.760 --> 57:18.760
I haven't got a chance to play it yet.

57:18.760 --> 57:19.760
I tried it.

57:19.760 --> 57:20.760
I will soon.

57:20.760 --> 57:21.760
I tried it.

57:21.760 --> 57:23.800
I could not understand the control system at all.

57:23.800 --> 57:24.800
So I don't know.

57:24.800 --> 57:29.320
I just hit mash one button, swung my sword, and there was lots of blood, and I died a

57:29.320 --> 57:30.320
lot.

57:30.320 --> 57:35.080
At least that's why they have demos, so you don't have to waste $60 to find that out.

57:35.080 --> 57:37.080
Project Gotham Racing 4 is up there now.

57:37.080 --> 57:38.320
I played that one.

57:38.320 --> 57:39.320
It's pretty.

57:39.320 --> 57:40.320
It's fun.

57:40.320 --> 57:41.320
But I really suck at it.

57:41.320 --> 57:42.520
I cannot control the car for shit.

57:42.520 --> 57:44.040
I just have not figured out.

57:44.040 --> 57:47.640
The only racing game I can control worth a damn besides Mario Kart is Burnout.

57:47.640 --> 57:48.920
These other ones, I can't do it.

57:48.920 --> 57:50.440
I keep crashing into walls.

57:50.440 --> 57:52.040
I highly recommend, Rob.

57:52.040 --> 57:54.560
I swear you're going to love this game.

57:54.560 --> 57:55.960
Flat-out ultimate destruction.

57:55.960 --> 57:57.600
I played the demo for that, too.

57:57.600 --> 57:58.600
I did.

57:58.600 --> 58:00.360
Based on your recommendation, I downloaded the demo for that.

58:00.360 --> 58:01.360
It was kind of fun.

58:01.360 --> 58:05.380
A little clunkier than Burnout for me, but I like the fact that when you ran people off

58:05.380 --> 58:07.880
the road, it actually told you who you just killed.

58:07.880 --> 58:08.880
That was pretty fun.

58:08.880 --> 58:09.880
And they get pissed off at you, too.

58:09.880 --> 58:10.880
Yes.

58:10.880 --> 58:11.880
That was good.

58:11.880 --> 58:12.880
That was good.

58:12.880 --> 58:13.880
Yeah.

58:13.880 --> 58:14.880
Ultimate destruction.

58:14.880 --> 58:17.080
And the majority of them were hot chicks that I was offing.

58:17.080 --> 58:22.000
A lot of them look like the cast of The Fast and the Furious and shit, so it's funny.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
Let's see.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.640
Fear Files, that's going to be coming up as well.

58:26.640 --> 58:30.520
And then finally, Virtua Fighter 5.

58:30.520 --> 58:31.520
Lots of demos.

58:31.520 --> 58:32.520
Check them out.

58:32.520 --> 58:34.520
More demos, I'm sure, this week.

58:34.520 --> 58:35.520
Woohoo.

58:35.520 --> 58:43.000
All right, well, Microsoft is cracking down on naughty, naughty, naughty, very naughty

58:43.000 --> 58:45.480
mottos that people have in their gamer tag.

58:45.480 --> 58:49.320
Not so much the tag itself, but you know how everybody on Xbox 360 gets a motto, a little

58:49.320 --> 58:51.680
line that they can have under their name?

58:51.680 --> 58:56.040
For instance, mine is OrangeLawnTrader.com, trying to plug the site in very cheap ways.

58:56.040 --> 58:58.920
So when people kick my ass at Halo, they'll go, hey, let's check out this guy's crappy

58:58.920 --> 59:00.860
podcast that he does with his friends.

59:00.860 --> 59:01.860
So yeah, that's there.

59:01.860 --> 59:03.200
I don't know what you guys have for your mottos.

59:03.200 --> 59:06.040
What do you have for your motto, Loki?

59:06.040 --> 59:07.040
I don't remember.

59:07.040 --> 59:08.040
You don't remember?

59:08.040 --> 59:09.040
No.

59:09.040 --> 59:10.040
Wow.

59:10.040 --> 59:11.040
Does anybody?

59:11.040 --> 59:12.040
What's yours, puppy?

59:12.040 --> 59:13.040
Do you remember?

59:13.040 --> 59:14.040
I honestly, you know what?

59:14.040 --> 59:17.240
I only made it a month ago, and I don't remember it, because it's really not important.

59:17.240 --> 59:19.040
I think it'd be funny the first time.

59:19.040 --> 59:24.960
I think I had, it's so much fun, and then I think I just changed it to the website.

59:24.960 --> 59:25.960
Nice.

59:25.960 --> 59:29.900
Well, one of our fellow independent podcasters found out the hard way that Microsoft is actually

59:29.900 --> 59:35.380
keeping an eye on those mottos, Cheepy D over at the Cheap Ass Gamer.

59:35.380 --> 59:39.840
They're the guys that won the podcast award this year, so good for them, but they got

59:39.840 --> 59:45.360
banned from Xbox Live for a day for saying, Konnichiwa, bitches, in their motto.

59:45.360 --> 59:51.980
Apparently Microsoft does not appreciate the word bitch, because poor Cheepy D, yeah, they're

59:51.980 --> 59:53.520
offended by the word Konnichiwa.

59:53.520 --> 59:54.520
Come on.

59:54.520 --> 59:55.520
They're racist.

59:55.520 --> 01:00:00.200
You know what's funny is that when I read that, I think of the Robins song, but maybe

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.280
I'm just, I don't know, I'm crazy.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:06.600
Anyway, also another user on the site, an unnamed user, but I think I actually know

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.760
who this might be if you listen to All Games Radio.

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:13.920
There is a person whose motto was, called the shit poop, but they used a little wavy

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:19.720
thing for the S and a little symbol for the P in poop, so it got past the little language

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:20.720
filters.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:23.700
I'm thinking, you know, there's a guy on All Games called, he called the shit poop is actually

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:26.480
his nickname, and I'm like, it must be the same guy.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:30.280
So these poor guys are getting booted for, well, they're not booted, but they're getting

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:34.960
the ban for a day for their naughty mottos and getting a nasty email and all that stuff.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:39.960
Now here's my thing is I want to know what exactly does Microsoft consider offensive.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:44.000
I'm like, the bans are just for a day, so let's have a little fun with this.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.400
Let's push the limits.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:53.080
So tonight I'm going to change my motto to fisting fan, and I want to see if anybody

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:57.120
catches that that could be actually a pornographic thing, and I'm like, I meant like, you know,

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.560
I meant like karate, fisting.

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.160
So we'll see what happens.

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:07.480
The national term in karate, you have valleys, fisting.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:11.320
So I'm going to change my motto tonight to like, I heart fisting or fisting fan or fan

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:18.200
of fisting, and I want to see if that will get by the censors, so we'll see what happens.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:32.000
One of Dan's friends, his gamer tag is, okay, I have to think of how he has it, DuckMySock.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.300
Apparently one of the listeners over at AllGames, Flaming Bozo is reporting, one of the other

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:41.680
listeners at AllGames, Buck Fush, was his nickname, Buck Fush got banned for a day because

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:44.080
his motto said Bush Plan 9-11.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:48.800
Apparently, that was a no-no.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.560
Who cares?

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:55.040
Seriously, Microsoft, who cares?

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.920
Okay, Loki, a seat now, good.

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:57.920
I like this.

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:01.560
The chat room is coming up with things that are questionably offensive for us to put in

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:02.560
our mottos.

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.520
So, Loki, you're going to use this one from Takeo Ray, okay?

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:10.040
Dirty Sanchez is all around.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:13.440
Can you change your motto to that and see if you get banned for a day?

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:14.440
It's just a day.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.040
It's just one day.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.040
You can go without Halo for a day.

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:20.200
I can get banned for a whole other reasons, but...

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.200
All right.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:26.720
Oh, Son of Dad is doing a little play on what there is there.

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:27.720
My new...

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:28.720
Oh, Son of Dad's...

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:33.000
No, I guess Son of Dad's new motto says, Halo Soaks Cork.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.120
I like Frisbees.

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.720
Frisbees says, buy a Wii.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:40.560
I don't have an Xbox in my...

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:41.560
That's not an Xbox, sorry.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:42.560
I'm sorry.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:43.560
Oh, 360.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:44.560
Oh, 360.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.560
Okay.

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:46.560
Well, Megsy's got one, but she doesn't have time to play.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:47.560
She's studying for finals.

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:52.080
But can someone in chat, for me, or anyone who's listening, who wants to actually participate,

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:55.520
add something to the lesbian, or like, I like dykes or something?

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:56.520
Yeah.

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:57.520
Carpet muncher.

01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.520
Carpet muncher.

01:02:58.520 --> 01:02:59.520
How do you know?

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:00.520
That could be my cat.

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.520
Sharmi used to do that.

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.520
My cat does that too.

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:03.520
Our witness says, I like box.

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:11.520
My mom says, if I want to be a lesbian, I have to lick a lot of carpet.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.520
Pretty much.

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.520
Anyway.

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:16.920
It's really that simple.

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:18.560
I make you an honorary lesbian.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.560
Damn it.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:25.680
All there is in this house are hardwood floors.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.680
That's true.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:29.880
I think it's a special time, Rob.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:33.840
Okay, Color of Sakura's going to change his motto to say, the rug doctor.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:35.920
Oh, God, yes.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:37.160
That's awesome.

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.740
So we need to start a thread in the forums for questionable mottos that get caught by

01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:41.740
Microsoft.

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:42.740
Yeah.

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:43.740
That would be funny.

01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:49.680
Somebody start that up, orangetownsradio.com, forums, plug plug, or like have one that says,

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.960
I want a fag, or something like that.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.320
Yeah, but fag means cigarette, right?

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.320
Yeah, exactly.

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.320
Okay, here's the thing.

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:58.140
If you get banned for reals, like permanently though, you can't blame us, okay?

01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:01.320
You're doing this at your own, because I don't want no lawsuit, like, oh, those assholes

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.040
on Orange Island Radio told me you changed my mottos.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.320
No, you're doing it for yourself, okay?

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:09.000
But we really appreciate it, so give it to pure pleasure.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.640
The only cool kids do it.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:12.640
Segment.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.040
Ah, yes.

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.760
I'm sorry.

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:21.080
We have a segment coming up now, because we're over an hour now, so it's time for part A

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.080
to finish up.

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:26.960
And you know we like to close out part A here at Orange Lounge Radio by respecting our elders

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:30.600
and paying tribute to a classic video game.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.640
It's Dark Sakura's classic game of the week.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:39.560
Dark Sakura, what game should all the kids be putting in their Gamefly cues right now?

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:50.040
The classic game of the week for all of you awesome people who own a Saturn.

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:57.520
Magical Night's Dream Cotton Boomerang, which is a fantastic game.

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:04.760
And Boomerang is actually a Saturn port of Cotton 2, so actually if you've got BAME,

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:11.160
you can play the game on your emulator, and it'll run just fine, but it was basically

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:15.840
going back to the original Cotton the way that it worked as being a side-scrolling shooter

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.840
with extra fun.

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:21.680
And I know I've talked about Panorama Cotton and Rainbow Cotton a lot.

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:27.960
Those are sort of special in the series in the fact that they are behind the character

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:30.720
view, and they're actually kind of hard to play.

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:37.460
But Cotton Boomerang is completely side-scroller with lovely animations and levels, but you

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:43.800
also get pretty much unlimited magic, and you get all these different skills and items

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:44.800
that you can use in the game.

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:51.160
Like my favorite item in this game is this big ball of fire.

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:55.920
And what you do with the big ball of fire is you bounce it, and you actually will have

01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:00.000
lines of enemies that come at you, and you can bounce the ball at, and it'll just knock

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.400
out complete lines of enemies.

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.800
And the cool thing about the Cotton series, though, is that there was also this collector

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:14.800
thing that if you got different Cotton games, like Panorama Cotton was one, and keep in

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:22.160
mind they only made something about 600 copies of this game, and there were only 300 of these

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.960
tea cups that they issued out.

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:29.840
There was one with the original Cotton version.

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:31.200
There was the Panorama Cotton one.

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:35.680
There's a Cotton 2 cup, but they don't know how many of them are out in circulation, but

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:39.560
these are like lots of money now.

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:45.840
For anyone who wants to play any of the Cotton games, if you've got a Neo Geo Pocket Color,

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:50.760
and I think it actually came out on DS, I want to say, there's also a Super Nintendo

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.760
version.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:56.760
They did release Cotton on a number of systems, but I'd have to say of the side-scrollers,

01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:03.440
the best of them is Cotton 2, it's just really, really a lot of fun.

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:07.240
And I love that in the bonus stages we pick up tea cups.

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:12.040
I just like the concept of a side-scrolling shooter game starring witches flying on brooms.

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.480
That's just kind of rad and original.

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:19.000
The whole story behind it is that Cotton is this little witch girl who is addicted to

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.920
this candy called Willow that makes her throw up.

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:27.960
And this, she rescues, kind of like how I'm addicted to crack.

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.520
It makes me throw up too.

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:30.520
Whatever.

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:35.940
Anyway, and she rescues this fairy, this fairy named Silk comes to get her help.

01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:37.620
That's her, by the way.

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:41.760
That's a sexy mama that comes up there on the little stage selection screen.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.400
Is that Cotton's lesbian lover?

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.400
What is that?

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:45.400
That's the fairy Silk.

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:48.760
Well, of course, there has to be some gratuitous tea shot somewhere.

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:52.160
And the whole point of this game is that, and the whole reason that the character is

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:58.320
participating in this adventure at all is because either she wants candy, or someone

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:03.700
is threatening her supply of candy, and she's only doing it for the candy, she could give

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:09.240
a shit about the trials and tribulations of the land she's rescuing because she wants

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.240
candy.

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.240
Is she single?

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.240
Probably.

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:14.200
But I'd like to do her if I was.

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.760
She's also a little girl.

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:18.120
Oh, wow.

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:21.200
Cotton is a little girl.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.200
She's a very little girl.

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:24.560
Well, the graphics is just awesome.

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:31.200
Rob's got something on YouTube that's, yeah, video one, and it's pretty much showing what

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.720
the game is looking like, and the graphics.

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:34.720
How old is this game?

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:36.720
This came out on the Sega Saturn.

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:37.720
The graphics are awesome.

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:45.200
I do want to say that this game came out in 95, I want to say.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:48.200
The Saturn in Japan came out in 93, Rob.

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:54.640
No, it came out in 94 because I had just started college and my friend imported a Saturn that

01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:55.640
year.

01:08:55.640 --> 01:09:01.920
But, yeah, I want to say that Cotton Boomerang came out in 95, and it's, for anyone who's

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:04.560
a fan of 2D shooters, this game is gorgeous.

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:05.560
I mean, really.

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:06.560
Yeah, it really is.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.560
And it's a ton of fun.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:12.920
So I'd say anyone who's got name or the equivalent, fine.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:17.840
If you want to play it on one of your emulators, you'll find it as Cotton 2, but if you've

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:21.560
got a Saturn, find this game in Japan, it's really a ton of fun.

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:26.480
And I can say that I have played through Cotton 2, or Cotton Boomerang, and it's really great.

01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:28.600
I don't actually own it myself.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:34.360
Cotton Boomerang, or Cotton 2, is the classic game of the week, as judged by Dark Sakura.

01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:35.360
Very cool.

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:36.360
This game looks like fun.

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:39.600
I'm actually thinking I want to check that out too at some point, so, very cool.

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.200
I'm liking this new segment.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.200
What do you guys think?

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:44.240
Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com if you want to send us an email.

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:47.360
If you have a suggestion, a game that Jamie needs to check out to consider for the segment,

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:50.600
even though I think you have your next month and a half already picked out.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:56.760
Actually, I make sure to pick them out ahead of time.

01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:02.040
And Dark Tetsuya, thank you, he posted a link to the PanoramaCotton Mega Drive one that

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:03.880
has the teacup with it.

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:06.760
And I actually do know somebody who has a copy of PanoramaCotton.

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:11.640
If anybody wants to have a headache, then go on YouTube and look at, well actually,

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:15.880
PanoramaCotton, I've played on the Genesis emulator, but my friend owns a legit copy.

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:19.160
It really is fun, but Rainbow Cotton was really fun too.

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:22.280
That was the Dreamcast version that's the same type of game.

01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:23.280
All right.

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:27.000
Well, that's going to do it for Orange Lounge Radio, this part A of our podcast, but don't

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000
worry.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000
We're going to be right back with part B, and in part B tonight, we're being joined

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.920
by Craig Howard and Ben Ward from Bizarre Creations.

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:39.680
They're going to be here to talk about Geometry Wars Galaxies, so we'll be right back with

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:45.200
part B of our show.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:48.800
And for those of you guys listening live tonight, first off, I apologize for those audio issues

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.200
because now it's already like 7.30, but that's okay.

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.920
We'll just pretend part A was really long because it was.

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:56.040
We're going to be right back in a little bit with part B of our show.

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:59.680
If you're listening on AllGames.com, the Kirkpockin and Hendricks review is up next.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:02.080
It's sandwiched in between part A and B of our show.

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:06.640
One guy from the US and one guy from the UK reviewing the exact same game.

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:10.080
And speaking of folks from the UK, did you know, Dark Soccer, that Bizarre Creations

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.080
is in the UK?

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:12.080
Yes.

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:16.760
So yeah, I actually had to get up at like six in the morning to interview these guys,

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:17.760
so it's going to be cool.

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:18.760
We're going to have them on.

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:20.400
That would have been two o'clock in the afternoon there.

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.400
Yep, sure was.

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:23.680
They probably were well fed and well rested after lunch.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:26.800
Although there was some snafus with the time zone stuff, but I'll talk about that when

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.120
we come back in part B. Remember, eight hour time difference.

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:33.520
I made a bad boo-boo when I was late, so I made myself look very unprofessional.

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:37.680
I'll tell you more about that in part B. For those of you guys listening on OrangeLawnsRadio.com,

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:42.400
you're getting some music, specifically tonight, some of the music from the Wangan Midnight

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:45.060
Maximum Tune 3 soundtrack.

01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:48.920
So don't drive right now, because you might drive really, really fast through this music.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:12:15.280
We'll be right back in about ten minutes.
