00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,960
Tonight, October 21st, 2007, Street Fighter is back for more in SF4, Sega brings its characters

2
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,120
to a new tennis game, and a classic video game movie returns to at least one big screen.

3
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,640
Orange Lounge Radio

4
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,560
Hello everybody out there on the Internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,640
We are that podcast on the Internet dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer

6
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,800
lifestyle.

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,800
My name is Rob Roberts.

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,520
Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,520
Hi.

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,520
How are you doing, Jamie?

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,520
I'm here.

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,520
You're here?

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,520
I'm here too.

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,920
And we're here to talk about games.

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,520
So joining us, the one and only Loki.

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,520
Hello.

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,160
How are you doing, Loki?

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,160
I'm doing fine.

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,200
Now, I notice, and probably the folks on the operator 11 feet are noticing too, unless my

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,920
big old butt's blocking the way, that you actually have a little Guitar Hero 3 box laid

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
out here.

22
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,920
Tell us the story.

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,920
What's going on here?

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,880
I have a Guitar Hero 3 demo kit that retailers would be getting and anybody that has the

25
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,600
Guitar Hero 3 game playing in their store would be getting one of these.

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,240
And inside is the brand new guitar for Guitar Hero 3 for the 360, except it's kind of rare

27
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,720
because it is a wired version instead of wireless.

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,720
Interesting.

29
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,480
Not that I really give a damn if it's wireless or not, I mean, because that's one less battery

30
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,480
I need, so.

31
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,400
Now, are we going to be unboxing that on operator 11 a little later?

32
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Yeah, sure, why not?

33
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,400
All right, sounds good.

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
So check that out.

35
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,440
Remember, we do always webcam our show as well on operator11.com.

36
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,200
Usually it's pretty boring, but just sitting here watching our big talking faces doing

37
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,880
the show, but now we have little cool things like this to show you guys, and we'll talk

38
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,760
about that later, and show you guys the interchangeable face plate on the guitar, which I thought

39
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
was pretty neat.

40
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,040
I still haven't figured out how to take that off completely, I'm afraid I'm going to break

41
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,760
it and I don't want to, but they do have face plates that they're going to be selling.

42
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,920
I've seen them, they're kind of ugly, but hey, they're face plates.

43
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,920
All right.

44
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,880
Well, let's start off the show talking about our gaming week, so we'll go over to Dark

45
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,880
Soccer.

46
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,040
How was your gaming week, Dark Soccer?

47
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,160
It was very singular.

48
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,120
Meaning you only showed love to one game?

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
Ragnarok.

50
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
Of course, Ragnarok.

51
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,760
How was the Ragnarok addiction going?

52
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,040
It was great.

53
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,500
I've got another character up to the second job level now.

54
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,020
What exactly does that mean in English?

55
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,880
It means you have a first job level and a second job level, and I hit the second job

56
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,040
level.

57
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,640
So what are your jobs?

58
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,760
Are you still that one where you kick people in the face?

59
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,460
Well, yeah, I've got that one.

60
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,960
She's on the second part of kicking people in the face.

61
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,400
Like first you learn how to kick people in the face with your right foot, and then you

62
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,400
learn about your left foot?

63
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Is that how it works?

64
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,200
Actually, I'm working on a merchant to blacksmith now, and I have, what do I have now?

65
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:06,440
I have two crusaders, a blacksmith, a fire mage, who I'm building up to sage.

66
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,760
I have two assassins, one of them hit level 91 this week.

67
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,840
I have a dancer who looks like a hoochie.

68
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,840
Fun.

69
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,840
Yeah.

70
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,840
All right.

71
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
Well, enjoy your Korean MMOs.

72
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,240
Of course, we'll go over to the chat room.

73
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,440
Our always present fourth guest on the program, chat.orangelongeradio.com, especially tonight

74
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,280
because unlike weeks past, we're actually kind of quiet here in studio tonight.

75
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,800
It's just the three of us, so we have to show a little love to our chat room.

76
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,760
We always love the comments, and we'll start off tonight with Wetu says, of course, dark

77
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,880
Sakura and Korean MMOs, of course.

78
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,740
Loki, how was your gaming week?

79
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,480
My gaming week was pretty filled.

80
00:03:48,480 --> 00:04:00,680
I would say, God, let me start off with I played Conan on Xbox 360, and it's interesting.

81
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,440
It's actually very much of a rip off of God of War, but that's not a bad thing.

82
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,880
It's still a pretty good game.

83
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,200
And let's see, I also tried, of course, Beautiful Katamari, and I actually finished that game

84
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,240
because it's very short.

85
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:22,920
I tried the, what else did I play here, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.

86
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,480
I tried the demo for that.

87
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,640
You know, it's a good looking game.

88
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,920
The cars look good.

89
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,680
The track that they picked, though, to showcase it, I wouldn't have picked that one, just

90
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,960
because it really doesn't look that great, and you know, minor complaints, and I know

91
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,320
this is kind of nitpicking, but the rear view mirrors on your car, for example, the side

92
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,360
rear view mirror lacks a lot of the detail that's in like your center rear view mirror,

93
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,320
so it makes no sense why they couldn't just have the same level of detail on that stuff.

94
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,240
Also, the crowds still are like little, you know, canned animation things, and I know

95
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
that Project...

96
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Paper dolls?

97
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,440
Which, I know Project Gotham does the same thing, but you know what, Project Gotham looks

98
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,240
way better, and you know, this isn't really a huge deal right now because Project Gotham

99
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,200
is only on 360, but come, you know, a year from now when Project Gotham Racing 5 is probably

100
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,720
going to be coming out, and Gran Turismo 5 is coming out at the same time, sadly enough,

101
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,560
I think a lot of people are going to buy Project Gotham over in Gran Turismo.

102
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,160
Wait, back up, though, doesn't Microsoft own the Project Gotham?

103
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,560
They just sent it out to Bazaar to do it, so...

104
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,760
Yeah, but I don't know if that, if they own the rights to the game or not.

105
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,280
It might be just Bazaar's game.

106
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,560
I'm pretty sure Project Gotham is a Microsoft IP.

107
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,800
I know you told me about this for the show, but now it's like, I'm pretty sure, unlike

108
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,480
Mass Effect, Project Gotham Racing is a Microsoft IP that they gave to Bazaar Creations.

109
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:52,680
Let me put it this way, I mean, your choices for sim racing games on the Playstation 3,

110
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,840
or even the Playstation 2, were pretty much limited to Gran Turismo, and that's it.

111
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,680
If you don't want, if you're looking for a sim racing game, that was your only choice,

112
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,800
for the most part.

113
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,820
So probably at the Playstation 3, it's going to be the same deal.

114
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,720
I'm just saying, you know, for them, putting all this hype behind it, and trying to even

115
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,240
sell this kind of demo of a game before it comes out, you know, officially, I don't know,

116
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,240
it's not, it's not that great.

117
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,640
But if you're really dying to play some Gran Turismo, I highly recommend checking out the

118
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,600
demo first, and then judging it based off that, see if you want to buy it or not.

119
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,720
It looks good, but I just, you know, after seeing the video, the video of it looked really,

120
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,720
really nice, but when you're playing the game, it's not as nice, so I don't know.

121
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,600
I'm trying to think if there's anything else that I played that was really awesome.

122
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,640
I think that's pretty much it, other than, you know, Saints Row, because I've always

123
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,360
been playing Saints Row now.

124
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
Always.

125
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,720
My gaming week, yeah, I spent a large part of my week in Southern California, no, I did

126
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,000
not go to E for All, actually.

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,480
I decided instead of going to E for All, I was going to go to Disneyland, because, and

128
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,160
I think I've said this on the show before, I felt like if I was going to go to E for

129
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,080
All, I was going to end up working, quote unquote, the whole time, and honestly, I just

130
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,400
felt that the games to see at E for All, there was just going to be huge crowds for all that

131
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,280
stuff, and the media invites I was getting, not a lot of real wowing kind of stuff, so

132
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,720
I said, you know what, I'm going to just take a real vacation from both of my jobs, Orange

133
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,160
Orange Radio and my day job, and I'm going to go to Disneyland, so I spent the week playing

134
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,120
Buzz Lightyear once again, and I got the number 17 high score for the day one time I played,

135
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,160
I have a picture to prove it, heh heh, anyway, no, but seriously, other video games I've

136
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,280
been playing, I did play Typing of the Dead before I left, because I remember we had this

137
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,200
story on the show a couple weeks ago, where we were talking about how they added Typing

138
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,120
of the Dead to GameTap, I'm like, I've got to go play that, and it's still as wonderful

139
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,440
as I remember it, and it runs great on the computer, so I was very happy about that.

140
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,640
Even though it is the PC version that GameTap is emulating, not the Dreamcast version, but

141
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,000
they still do have the Dreamcast strapped to their backs, and that's, you know, the

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,440
part we all know and love.

143
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:08,160
Also, a large majority of my gaming week otherwise was spent playing E4, the other E4, not the

144
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,080
Expo, but every Xtend Xtra Xtreme, which came out on Xbox Live this week, which I think

145
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,440
the game has a lot more depth than you might realize at first, because there is the main

146
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,640
game mode, which, I don't even know how to explain this, is basically a game of setting

147
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,520
off chain reactions.

148
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,440
Basically you explode your ship, and you're trying to set off chain reactions with other

149
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,520
things that are floating around the screen, but there's a catch.

150
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,280
Even though your ship regenerates once the chain reaction is done, your shields are only

151
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,440
on for about two seconds once you regenerate.

152
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,280
After those two seconds are up, anything on the screen can kill you, so you want to commit

153
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,600
suicide before something on the screen kills you, because if something on the screen kills

154
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,800
you, you basically have to go back to start.

155
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,520
The game time is limited to three minutes, but you can collect power-ups throughout the

156
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
game.

157
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,240
You can collect a power-up to extend your game time, a power-up to extend your shield

158
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,120
time, a power-up to make things float on the screen faster and increase the beats of the

159
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,720
song, that's what they call the quicken, or you can pick a power-up that increases your

160
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,640
bonus multiplier.

161
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,220
Basically that's essentially the core component of the game, so you get higher and higher

162
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,080
bonuses if you actually detonate your ship in time to the music.

163
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:23,160
It's a game by Tetsuya Mizuguchi who did Luminous and a bunch of other stuff I love, and I played

164
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,520
every Sin Extra on the PSP, so I knew I was going to like this game, and I do.

165
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,320
The game has a lot of depth, it has the regular game mode, and then it has a shooter mode,

166
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,320
it's called the revenge mode, where you can go around and actually, it's just a shooter,

167
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,520
it doesn't even bother with the music or the exploding, it just shoots things.

168
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,680
So that was kind of interesting, but then there's another mode, and it's pretty intricate

169
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,080
the way they set it up, but you can actually, using the whole media center and doing the

170
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,480
MP3s on your Xbox 360 through the network, you can actually configure every Sin Extra

171
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,440
Extreme to read those songs, and you can work with the game to either auto-detect the BPM

172
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,240
or set the BPM by button-tapping or whatever, so you can use your own songs in the game,

173
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,180
which is kind of cool, it's kind of fun to be able to play the game with your own songs.

174
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,320
So that being said, the game has a lot of depth, and I think it is worth the $10, but

175
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,920
the game has some really major flaws, I think, and one is the fact that I managed to keep

176
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,600
a game going for 70 minutes the other day, and I found that I was getting very bored

177
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,560
of the default songs, so I was very surprised that unlike the PSP version, the game did

178
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,860
not increment in stages, and I realized maybe that's a different game, this wasn't necessarily

179
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,120
supposed to be a direct port of the PSP version, but I kind of liked that better when there

180
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,240
was that more sense of accomplishment as opposed to the fact of, I've survived for 70 minutes

181
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,200
now and my thumbs are getting numb, so I'm just going to suicide, which is what I ended

182
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,920
up doing.

183
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,480
The other thing that actually kind of makes me wonder why they chose to do this in the

184
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,840
game is that the graphics aren't that good, and I was kind of surprised, like compared

185
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,300
to the PSP version, which has these very bright visuals and different types of backgrounds

186
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:08,120
and different skins, I kind of felt that this game just had white on black, and the types

187
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,440
of objects that would float around the screen would change depending on what stage you were

188
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,800
playing, and the little ships that get into it as well, that's really about it, like the

189
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,880
backgrounds don't change too much, granted when you set off big combos, you get some

190
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,680
different rainbow patterns like the familiar cover looking chick and the rainbow circles

191
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:33,000
and stuff, but there wasn't the amazing seizure-inducing backgrounds of the PSP version, and I kind

192
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,180
of was disappointed, like I was expecting a little more from the game graphically, especially

193
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,240
with such a vibrant game like Luminous, and I understand the game relies on the chains

194
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,300
and the explosions to kind of give that vibrance, but I don't know, I kind of felt it was boring,

195
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,620
there wasn't a lot to entertain me after 70 minutes of playing one round of this game,

196
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,780
so it kind of didn't add up to a lot, so that was a bit of a disappointment, but overall

197
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,360
I think it is a good value for money, especially if you're not a PSP owner, I think it is a

198
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,360
fun game.

199
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,080
I did play a little bit of Luminous because they have the new content, I neglected to

200
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,740
download the holiday pack, but I did download the new Genkai Rocket song, Breeze, mediocre

201
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,200
at best, I did not enjoy Breeze, which is sad because I love love love love love Heavenly

202
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:20,140
Star and I love the video, but Breeze is basically the same concept for the video, the cartoon

203
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:25,080
Asian girl bouncing around, which makes sense because Genkai Rockets is supposed to be like

204
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:30,560
a, sorry, it's supposed to be like a cartoony band or whatever it is, you know, I don't

205
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,560
know.

206
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,040
Cartoon Heroes did it.

207
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,440
So did Gorillaz, but you know, it's just, at least, Gorillaz did it best, but there's

208
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,440
different, well you're a fangirl, there's different, there's variance in the Gorillaz

209
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,600
videos, you know what I mean, like their videos are all different, say what you will, like,

210
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,080
dislike, all the videos are different.

211
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,040
Actually actually actually, the videos only got different when you got to Demon Days,

212
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,680
the first album ones were not different.

213
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,680
They need to vary it up a little bit.

214
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,720
Well, I mean, they couldn't keep that level of, you know, I mean, Heavenly Star and, you

215
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,960
know, Shining were both really good, and, you know, eventually they're going to have

216
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,560
to have a mediocre song.

217
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,960
All right, going to chat room for some comments, chat.orangelandradio.com, pikaruno says, the

218
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,680
new seasonal luminous life pack is awesome and you should buy it right now.

219
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,880
I've heard good things about it, so I'm contemplating buying it, we'll see.

220
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,400
As long as I don't have any speed mixes of fucking Christmas songs.

221
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
Oh, yes, please no.

222
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,640
I'm looking at you, DanceMania, I'm looking at you.

223
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,120
Gerardimo says, they're trying to set you up with microtransactions like in Luminous,

224
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,480
who knows, maybe, maybe that's where my backgrounds are, there are going to be microtransactions

225
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,480
later on.

226
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,600
Well, I refuse, I'm putting my foot down this time on the microtransactions, damn it.

227
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,200
So you're paying less than a penny?

228
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:49,640
Well, look, it's, I know we've had this discussion about micro and macrotransactions, but that's,

229
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,480
you know, despite, it's still what people call it.

230
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,400
Gerardimo is also still having fun with the E4 demo.

231
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,960
Darktids Studio says, Loki, what, speed mix of Jingle Bells doesn't do it for you?

232
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,960
No, it doesn't.

233
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,960
It doesn't.

234
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,960
All right.

235
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,680
Oh, GS68 would also like to point out, speeding up a song does not equal a remix.

236
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,680
Good point.

237
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,360
All right, well, that's going to do it for our gaming weeks.

238
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,360
So adding heavy synth to it does make it Eurobeat.

239
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,360
It might.

240
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,880
And, you know, having some guy singing about fire, whatever, if I just insert blank of

241
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,280
fire and it's instant Eurobeat.

242
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,440
Oh, we'll get into remix stuff later on.

243
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,360
I have some complaints with certain artists out there.

244
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,360
Oh my.

245
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,360
All right.

246
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,120
Did I mention that Luminous does have, or I'm sorry, not Luminous, Every Sin Extra Extreme

247
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,280
does have a remix of Heavenly Star in it.

248
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,280
It's not that great.

249
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,280
I'm sorry to say.

250
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,280
You probably have already heard it, too.

251
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Maybe.

252
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
All right.

253
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,040
Let's go into tonight's news.

254
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,280
We don't have a lot of housekeeping tonight.

255
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,120
I will then, therefore, use the opportunity to plug our communities.

256
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,840
Myspace.com slash OrangeLoungeTrader.

257
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,640
Add us as your friend on Myspace.

258
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,480
We post bulletins with extra stuff.

259
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,440
We actually did a whole bonus show last week because of our outage after the show, and

260
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,800
so we posted it to our Myspace people and the live journal people at Orange Lounge.

261
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,400
We also have a community on Facebook, but I've been irritated with Facebook lately because

262
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,940
I'm getting sick of getting the invites for, so and so wants you to be on their team for

263
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,040
quiz show.

264
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,080
So and so wants you to join them in the battle of ninjas versus pirates.

265
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,840
I'm like, this so and so doesn't give two shits and is thinking about deleting his account.

266
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,480
Did you hear that the Mass Effect characters are now on Facebook looking for friends?

267
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,560
I could give a shit, honestly.

268
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,120
I hope they find no friends on Facebook.

269
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,600
I am not happy with Facebook.

270
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,440
Facebook was cool like six months ago before they started adding all the, like you would

271
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:46,520
think usually like user created mods are a good thing for almost everything you can think

272
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
of.

273
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,520
No.

274
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,880
Not Facebook.

275
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,200
Facebook has somehow proven that, you know, user enabled created mods can single handedly

276
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,560
make your site suck balls.

277
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,920
Just like user created themes for Myspace.

278
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,080
Now everybody's yelling at me to just block the applications.

279
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,760
Can I block everything?

280
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,960
Can I just put, is there like a box, block everything?

281
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,360
Maybe I'll do that.

282
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,520
I didn't even know that was a feature.

283
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,440
See, this is why I love chat.

284
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
Chat educates me.

285
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,380
In fact, I will check Facebook right now while we get into some gaming news.

286
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,680
So let's start off.

287
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,560
So during this week there was a wonderful event in London, Capcom's Gamers' Day, and

288
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,360
of course their bombshell announcement for that event would be Street Fighter IV.

289
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,200
Oh my God, it's coming.

290
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,680
I mean I'm not too surprised that there's a Street Fighter IV, that's like saying there's

291
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,160
not going to be a Halo 4 or something like that, I mean come on.

292
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,380
But okay, it is Street Fighter IV, it's supposed to continue with the 2D series, it's not going

293
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,400
to be 3D, so far at least.

294
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
Thank God.

295
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
That's a good thing.

296
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,400
That is a good thing.

297
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,760
And it doesn't have, you know, any other funky titles.

298
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,240
Although they didn't really show too much, they did have a nice teaser video showing

299
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,080
both Ken and Ryu fighting.

300
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,600
It was, I'm sorry, the teaser video was lame.

301
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,580
I mean it was nothing more than like a hype the crowd type thing when I'm sitting there

302
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,840
watching it on the computer, I'm thinking, show me the game.

303
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,560
I hate these stupid cinematic, like teasers that are nothing but cinematics, the CGI rendering.

304
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,360
We're in a day and an age of gaming where we know that's just all the BS cut scenes.

305
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,160
Like I want to see some actual game.

306
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,480
It would be awesome though if it was in that art style, because it was kind of like a water

307
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,880
colored type thing, but no.

308
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,520
So Street Fighter IV, it's going to be a fighting game, it'll probably be awesome, and out sometime

309
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
someday.

310
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,520
Yay!

311
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:40,920
Now let's see, GS68 says, nobody will play Street Fighter IV, arcade scene has been reduced

312
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,480
down to initial D4, and when, again, midnight, maximum 2 and 3.

313
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,200
Oh, people will play Street Fighter IV.

314
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,320
Well, because they're not going to gun for the arcades necessarily.

315
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,280
They're going to use Xbox Live and PlayStation Network to get people to play.

316
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,280
People still play the damn arcades.

317
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,840
I mean, come on, people still play Tekken there.

318
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,840
People still go to the arcades.

319
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,360
But there's still arcades out there.

320
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,000
There's not as many arcades, because arcade games have gotten more expensive, and if you

321
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,160
don't have the foot traffic, you're not going to be able to pay for your $6,000 game.

322
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,840
So that's why arcades are failing.

323
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:16,360
It's not because people stopped going to them, it's just that games got more expensive.

324
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,240
Out of curiosity, why would I bother to go to an arcade if I can just plug it in on my

325
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,920
Xbox 360 and sign into Live and play?

326
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,720
Because the D-pad sucks on Xbox 360.

327
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,360
Ouch, good point.

328
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
Touche.

329
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,160
What can ever replace the arcade experience?

330
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,160
That's true.

331
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,800
I know this is interesting coming from me on this program when you consider the three

332
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,480
of us all met, Hal, at an arcade, right?

333
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,200
But you know, arcades, they're saying in chat, they really have become nothing but gambling

334
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
for children and the ticket spitters.

335
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,600
It's sad.

336
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,340
Every good arcade I've ever known is gone or replaced with something that is under the

337
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:58,460
disguise of a good arcade, but it's not, I don't know, I'm sad.

338
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,960
So are you excited, I know you're a Capcom fighting girl fan, Dark Sakura, are you excited

339
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,960
about Street Fighter IV?

340
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
Hell yeah!

341
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,340
What do you hope they do differently this time?

342
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,340
Take out Chun-Li.

343
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,680
No, they can't do that!

344
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,220
And put in Sakura.

345
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,440
Why would, they would never take out Chun-Li, why would they do that?

346
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,860
Because I'm sick of all of the fanboyism, seriously.

347
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:26,920
It's like, okay, her moves are all, she's like, I'm trying to, after a while, you know,

348
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,440
a character is in a game and you kind of like him at first, and then you just get so sick

349
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,760
of seeing them all the time, that you just want something fresh.

350
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,480
If they're gonna do, I would love to see Sakura in the game, older.

351
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,160
I would like to see Ibuki come back, because Ibuki was my Street Fighter III person.

352
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:51,200
And I want to see the guy with one arm taken out, what was his name, Oro?

353
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,120
He needs to leave.

354
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,120
And they need to...

355
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,200
He needs to come back, but missing another arm, or a leg or something.

356
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,200
That'd be awesome.

357
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
The joke will continue.

358
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,240
Because then he'd be Elena, and fight with his legs.

359
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,040
She was cool too, she needs to come back.

360
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:11,920
And they need to actually have, you know, do they have any characters in the game who

361
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
use Taekwondo?

362
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:19,000
Uh, Footy Monster says, Dark Sakura, fuck you, leave my beautiful thunder thighs alone.

363
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,160
Hey, I have a kick power, thank you.

364
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,600
I think that they should take Street Fighter IV and actually add other Capcom characters

365
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,840
into it, instead of just this Capcom versus shit.

366
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,640
Then you'd have Puzzle Fighter.

367
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,240
Not Puzzle Fighter, but Pocket Fighter.

368
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,360
I'm all fine with them putting in new characters.

369
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,520
You know, why not have some new characters to sell?

370
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,680
Like, you know, Soul Calibur III kind of did it.

371
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,520
They had the guy with the big old sickle and stuff, you know, they were able to sell out

372
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,520
new characters.

373
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,400
Seriously, don't follow the route of Tekken 6, I mean, because Bob, the fat guy that sort

374
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,860
of looks like Mario, and no, that's not a cool character.

375
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,720
You know what I would like to see?

376
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,860
I would like to see a tag mode.

377
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,560
Like the versus games.

378
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,560
I think that would be cool.

379
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:15,780
I also really wouldn't mind just another Capcom versus game that isn't like, what was it,

380
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,780
Fighting Evolution.

381
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:21,880
I want them to go back to the Marvel versus Capcom style that they did, because that was

382
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,160
probably one of their most solid fighting games.

383
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,760
But I wanted to have like a, you know what they need to do?

384
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Instead of doing Street Fighter IV, we need another freaking CyberBots.

385
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,640
Blaze in our chat room is getting in on the Capcom crossover madness.

386
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,600
He says Phoenix Wright and Miles Edgeworth in Street Fighter IV.

387
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,680
Objection.

388
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:46,480
They should just do a new game series called Capcom versus and then do like a new installment

389
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,480
each year.

390
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,840
No, I think they should focus on Street Fighter IV and making it good, and I don't think they

391
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,720
should do any of this crossover bullshit.

392
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,800
I think they should focus on making a new original fun game.

393
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:02,100
To talk to Son of Dad for a moment, they, first of all, the Final Fight characters were

394
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,240
in the Alpha series, and that is, it's a different type of game.

395
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,080
It plays different than How 3 was.

396
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,400
I mean, I kind of liked How 3 was with the parrying system.

397
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,560
I thought that was cool and that needs to stay.

398
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,800
Especially because I have one time parried a Shoryuken, so that was really cool.

399
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,640
That was my awesome moment.

400
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,120
But I think that they need to have a few more unique styles.

401
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,120
I thought it was really good.

402
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,180
They had a boxer in there.

403
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:34,320
They had, you know, the stupid one-armed guy that kind of grossed me out that would have

404
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,320
the style.

405
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,320
They need a luchador.

406
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,320
They need a luchador.

407
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,320
No, they had one.

408
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,320
They had Vega.

409
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,320
He wasn't really a luchador, though.

410
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,320
No, not a luchador.

411
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,320
I'm thinking Matador.

412
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,680
No, they do need a luchador.

413
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,680
They need Mexican wrestling.

414
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,440
That'd be cool.

415
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,920
They need, well, there was Armeika in there.

416
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,720
In fact, Screw just a luchador.

417
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,760
They just need Santo in there.

418
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:08,840
No, they need to, oh god, they need a, well, not like a wrestler wrestler, but they need

419
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,720
like a big brawler.

420
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,240
Not like Zangief was, but just like this brute character.

421
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,240
Like T-Hawk?

422
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,640
No, T-Hawk was a wrestler.

423
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:25,840
They need this, just like the slow punch, like, oh god, who was it in Darkstalker?

424
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,880
Suddenly this game is turning into Saturday Night Slammasters.

425
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,360
The mummy guy?

426
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,360
Yeah, they need something like that, where they're slow and tough, but, you know, that's

427
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,440
just the thing.

428
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,520
They're slow and tough, and that's what's frustrating about them.

429
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
Do another Darkstalkers game.

430
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,520
That'd be kinda cool.

431
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,440
They need a, we need a good Darkstalkers game.

432
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,080
Okay, I love these comments from chat rooms on the crossover games.

433
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,760
GS68 says, fuck crossovers.

434
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,200
Stop feeding the fanboys.

435
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,680
Sephiroth1215 says, Street Fighter is only for Street Fighter characters.

436
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,080
You want other Capcom characters?

437
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,960
Play the Wacky Versus series.

438
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,760
Hey, I was hoping they'd come out with that other, another Sega Versus series, you know.

439
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,920
All I have to say is, thank god they're sticking with 2D, because I seem to remember there

440
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,520
was a 3D Street Fighter game, like, Roselle Golfland had it, didn't they?

441
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
And it was, oh god.

442
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,520
There was a 3D.

443
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,520
It was so horrible.

444
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,680
See, Son of Dad is saying exactly what I was thinking, that they need more unique styles

445
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,780
in the game.

446
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:23,000
And also, just to talk to hitson, I actually like Darkstalkers 3, and I've actually played

447
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,720
it where all the sprites on the screen, the character sprites on the screen were missing

448
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,480
because my employer at the time when I worked for an arcade was fixing it while I was playing

449
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,840
it, and beat the game that way.

450
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,600
But um, Fighters Megamix 2, that's a good idea.

451
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,840
Oh, thank you.

452
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,960
The chat room reminded me, I'm thinking of the EX series.

453
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,280
Those were the 3D ones.

454
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,360
Yeah, and Dark Knight reminds me that Capcom didn't do the 3D ones.

455
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,360
No.

456
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:51,760
Well, they should, like, sue whoever did it, again, just because people actually remember

457
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,360
how horrible those games are, so they should sue them again if they haven't already.

458
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,160
You know what game that I would like for them to make?

459
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:02,120
And this is what I would totally call it, too, is Capcom Fighting Universe.

460
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,160
Just a big clusterfuck of every character ever, or something?

461
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,680
You have your Rival Schools characters.

462
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
Oh, lordy.

463
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,640
You have your Alpha characters, you have your She-Fighter 3, you have your Cyberbot.

464
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,640
They did something like that, though.

465
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,640
They did that one.

466
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,640
Fangirl alert.

467
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,640
Fangirl alert.

468
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,680
I think that was, like, Capcom Fighting Evolution or something like that.

469
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,680
Yeah, but that game sucked.

470
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,160
Capcom Fighting Evolution sucked.

471
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,200
They need to just do...

472
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,280
You get the wolf from Okami, you get, you know, the guy from Dead Rising.

473
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,960
You choose your mode at the beginning of the game, and everyone fights in the same mode.

474
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,620
Alright, too much fanboy stuff for me.

475
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,680
We gotta move on with the other Capcom news, and speaking of the wolf from Okami, Okami

476
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,160
for the Wii has been confirmed.

477
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,100
Okami is coming to the Nintendo Wii in the spring of 2008.

478
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,720
If you've played Okami, it's the kind of game that really could benefit from some motion

479
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,160
controls, and certainly the game will be making use of the Wii-mote controls.

480
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,320
The motion controls will be used primarily for the Celestial Brush.

481
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,160
I'm actually excited about this because Okami's kind of one of those games everybody said

482
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,400
I should play and I didn't really get to play enough of, like, there was just so many games

483
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,000
coming out around that time, so this kind of allows a lot of people like me to take

484
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,500
a second look, just like when Resident Evil 4 came out for the Wii.

485
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,500
Same thing.

486
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,100
I think it's a good choice for them to bring it there.

487
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,640
I think it's an excellent choice, so I'm definitely looking forward to checking that out, Okami

488
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
on the Wii.

489
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,160
I don't know, and this is kind of off the subject a little bit, but I'm surprised they

490
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,320
even brought Viewtiful Joe to the Wii, but then that made me think, how much do you want

491
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,360
to bet that there might be a character announced that's Viewtiful Joe for Super Smash Bros.?

492
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,360
Interesting.

493
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,360
I don't know.

494
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,560
Because they did have that game that was sort of like Smash Bros. with Viewtiful Joe, but...

495
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,160
I think Viewtiful Joe's on ice for a little bit, and that's just fine, because, like...

496
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
It sucked.

497
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,880
Well, it started good, but then it was one of those, like, saturation...

498
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,120
It was a really good concept.

499
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,760
But it got too oversaturated, so I think Capcom's doing the smart thing right now, and Viewtiful

500
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,360
Joe, at least it seems to me anyway, is on ice for a little while, and that's just fine

501
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
by me.

502
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,360
The series needs to be on ice.

503
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,880
Well, there is a little bit more good Capcom news.

504
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:09,840
They have released word about a game called Dark Void that will be out next winter, developed

505
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:16,640
by Airtight Games, and they gave us Crimson Skies Hyrule to Revenge, so it is supposed

506
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:23,520
to be mid-air and on foot, and they haven't said what it's going to be on, although they're

507
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:30,620
thinking PS3 and Xbox 360, so it's a game where you go against these...

508
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:34,760
They're called the Watchers, and they've been watching, and now they stopped watching and

509
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,760
are doing...

510
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,240
What have they been watching me do?

511
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,240
Porn.

512
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,240
They watch...

513
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,240
Oh, noes.

514
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,240
Ceiling Watchers are watching you fap.

515
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,080
Oh, noes.

516
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,160
Well, hooray for original ideas, right, because this is a whole new IP for them, right?

517
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,160
Yeah.

518
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,160
It's a new world.

519
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,160
Well, good.

520
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:59,280
Well, folks that may have owned a PS3 and not a 360 may have missed out on the Lost

521
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Planet series.

522
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,280
Well, fear not.

523
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,280
Capcom...

524
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,280
Unless you owned a computer.

525
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,600
Unless you owned a PC, but who owns a PC nowadays?

526
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,680
I mean, seriously, nobody.

527
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,680
Totally.

528
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,280
Yeah, nobody owns a computer.

529
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,040
Who plays games on PCs anymore?

530
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,760
That's just ridiculous talk.

531
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,760
Anyways.

532
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,520
No, but seriously, Lost Planet is coming to the PS3.

533
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,200
They're going to have all the features and download content that was available for the

534
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,320
PC and Xbox 360 versions.

535
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,560
It's supposed to come out in the spring, so hooray!

536
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:34,920
You get your Lost Planet in almost a year later.

537
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,620
Are they doing anything extra for it?

538
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,620
Extra levels?

539
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,620
Extra characters?

540
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,620
Extra...

541
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,620
Just the download content.

542
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,620
That's pretty much it.

543
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:48,000
I mean, it's not really that extra, I guess.

544
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,520
There's all the bonus stuff that was available already.

545
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,080
No dress-up mode?

546
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,080
No.

547
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,080
No.

548
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,080
That's too bad.

549
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,160
It says apparently now that it can fit all that stuff on the Blu-ray disc, so that's

550
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,040
why it wasn't downloading content now.

551
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,920
I like Son of Dad's comment in chat.

552
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:07,440
Son of Dad says in chat, chat.orange.onnashray.com, Lost Planet PlayStation 3?

553
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,440
No.

554
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,640
Dead Rising PlayStation 3?

555
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,120
Yes.

556
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,120
That would be sweet.

557
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,800
And honestly, if they're looking for a game that would take advantage of their little

558
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:23,440
shaker controller-like-an-idiot function, then Dead Rising would be a good one to eat

559
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,440
too.

560
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,840
But here's the thing, and this is kind of good news for you guys, because if you think

561
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,720
about it, I would think that they would pick Dead Rising over Lost Planet anyways, because

562
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,160
I think Dead Rising sold more anyways.

563
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:41,760
So that means, to me, that means that they're making a sequel, so instead of porting the

564
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,600
original, they're just going to make a sequel for both platforms.

565
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,680
Well duh, they've got to be making a sequel.

566
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,600
How could they not be making a sequel to Dead Rising?

567
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,600
That game exceeded expectations.

568
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,320
Please God, fix the damn save system, because that was horrible.

569
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,920
I stopped playing the game because of that, sadly.

570
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,040
That and the fact that my monitor sucked at the time, so I couldn't see anything in the

571
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
dark.

572
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,240
But, um, fix the save system.

573
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:10,160
Well, also coming out of Capcom Gamers' Day, lots of news from Gamers' Day this week, Super

574
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,520
Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix was playable at the show.

575
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,820
Only Ken and Ryu were actually selectable in the game, but that didn't prevent some

576
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,320
crappy YouTube video from going up, and folks could actually kind of see the game in motion.

577
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,760
We'll also announce there are some changes that we hadn't heard yet for what we have

578
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,520
in store for the game.

579
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,800
The HD Remix, of course, supports widescreen, you know, we kind of figured that would happen.

580
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,200
The music has all been completely remixed for the game, which doesn't actually surprise

581
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,340
me too much, I think we needed that too.

582
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:47,280
There will also be, however, not just the HD version, but an arcade mirror of the Super

583
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,420
Street Fighter II Turbo arcade version, so if you want your purest version, that will

584
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,400
be included in the game.

585
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:58,080
Also, apparently, some balancing has gone into effect, some rebalancing, I'm not sure

586
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,400
if that means some attacks do more damages or some characters' movements are different

587
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,500
or what have you, but there has been some rebalancing done.

588
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,940
Not the first time Capcom's gone back and rebalanced one of their games, just take a

589
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:14,640
look at Puzzle Fighter II, had some rebalancing going on with the drops, but if you wanted

590
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,800
to, you could also play in your arcade perfect nothing has been changed mode, which I think

591
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,760
is the way to do it in this day and age when you revisit your retro classics, yes?

592
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,760
Yeah.

593
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
All right.

594
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,960
I'm looking forward to that, even though I am still a little bitter, I've bought Street

595
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,360
Fighter II on Xbox once, you have to kind of think, all right, the same thing happens

596
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:41,160
with over-the-counter games, this is just kind of like getting number two in the series

597
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,800
or whatever, I don't know how else to phrase it.

598
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:53,240
Well, one other thing that I think is very, very, very cool, and I'm very, very, very

599
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:59,800
excited about this, is that Bionic Commando is getting a remake.

600
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,400
Fuck yeah, it's about fucking time.

601
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
Fuck yes.

602
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,400
This is an amazing game.

603
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,200
I wonder if you still get to kill Hitler in it.

604
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,680
No, but it still looks awesome if you've seen the video for it.

605
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:13,640
I've only seen the little preview that showed the screenshots, I've not seen the game in

606
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,640
motion.

607
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,640
No, the video is, oh yeah.

608
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:20,240
Because I was a little nervous about the 3D looking, I mean.

609
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,360
Well, at any rate, it's going to be on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

610
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:31,080
You know, I'm noticing that we're getting a lot more, what would have been usually a

611
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:36,360
console or only game on the PC now, there's a lot more love for PC gamers.

612
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:41,040
I don't know why, no one plays games on the PC anymore, seriously, nobody.

613
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,440
You know you just got yelled at by several people in chat.

614
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,420
I beat sarcastic people, shit, come on.

615
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,480
Are you that dumb?

616
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,480
Of course people play games on a PC.

617
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,120
How many million people play WoW?

618
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,680
That would mainly get our first person shooters on PC, but now we're seeing more and more

619
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:02,120
of them on consoles, and we're seeing more and more platformers come out for PC.

620
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,720
So it's like, the whole gaming community is now sort of banding together.

621
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,320
Well remember folks, the PlayStation 3 is a computer, remember?

622
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,320
No it's not.

623
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:16,400
No, but according to the marketing, that's a little more accurate.

624
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,400
Yes it is, no it's not.

625
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,400
Yes it is, no it's not.

626
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:26,280
Well at any rate, Capcom is working with Grin, they did a Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter

627
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:35,720
PC, and it also, they have not announced a Wii release.

628
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:42,240
And Tigerclaw in our chat room has something to say about the lack of a Wii buy on a Commando.

629
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,040
Surprisingly, no Wii version.

630
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,740
The game looks like something perfect for the Wii mode, and it's surprising that they're

631
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,120
not making it for it.

632
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,200
Nintendo could have cashed in on it by re-releasing the original NES version on the Virtual Console.

633
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,120
Well they'll probably still try to cash in on it anyways, but here's the problem though

634
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,320
with the Wii.

635
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,220
It can't handle the game!

636
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:05,600
Just because it has the little waggle controls and stuff that would be perfect for this.

637
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,480
Unfortunately Nintendo decided, hey you know what, we don't really care about graphics,

638
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,280
so sorry, can't make that.

639
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,560
However if they had ported it to the PlayStation 2, yeah we could port that pretty easy.

640
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,600
But wait a minute though, ultimately that was Capcom's decision to say we're going

641
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:28,720
to go for the highest quality in looks and sound department as opposed to incorporating

642
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,720
the wiggle waggles.

643
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:34,720
You have to understand that people on the PlayStation 3 and 360 love action games, much

644
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:41,640
like Dead Rising, Lost Planet, the new Bionic Commando game and stuff like that.

645
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:47,360
Wii gamers only like Zack and Wiki Quest for Rose Treasure.

646
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,600
That's the only thing that they can handle.

647
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,400
Oh yeah, that's my favorite fucking game right there.

648
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,400
That and Resident Evil 4.

649
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,040
It's a little mixed up there, but you know.

650
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:02,320
I think that Capcom could do something if they were willing to focus on gameplay more.

651
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,920
Then again, one of the things I've always enjoyed about many Capcom games is that they

652
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,420
do tend to have really good gameplay.

653
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,840
Fuck that, maybe some more Mega Man Legends.

654
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,840
I can go on the Wii.

655
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,840
Perfect.

656
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,840
Done.

657
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
That's a series that needs to die.

658
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,840
And M64 wants to remind you also on the Wii, mini games.

659
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,840
My mistake.

660
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,840
Lots of mini games.

661
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,840
Bionic Commando mini games.

662
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,840
Oh look, pop the bubbles.

663
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,840
Kill Hitler again and again.

664
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
Wii.

665
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,840
Oh yeah.

666
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,840
Who knows.

667
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
Wii.

668
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:36,280
Dapho in the chat room would like to say Zack and Wiki looks awesome, how dare that be bashed.

669
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,120
How dare you Loki on this program.

670
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:44,080
On this show, there's not much that we don't dare to do at different times.

671
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,800
Son of Dad would like to remind us all that Okami's being ported to the Wii and not to

672
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,880
next gen with sharp graphics.

673
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,880
So the Wii is getting kind of something that.

674
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,240
I think it's been proven that the Wii can handle cel shading fairly well.

675
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,760
Isn't Okami cel shaded?

676
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,960
I'm just awfully surprised that Wii's getting yet another PlayStation 2 port.

677
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,720
That's surprising with Resident Evil 4 and all those other fucking games that PlayStation

678
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,120
2, Xbox 360 ports, or Xbox ports.

679
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:16,800
Ryoma says if you're going to do the Bionic Commando mini games, pick Hitler's nose.

680
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,040
Like that one game in WarioWare.

681
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,560
This just in on the Smash dojo.

682
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,640
Hitler, the new character.

683
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,880
I don't know about that one.

684
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,120
I don't think so.

685
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:41,720
And M64 reminds you very subtly, but not really, that RE4 was a GameCube port, not a PS2 port.

686
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,620
I believe it was a PlayStation 2 port for this one because it had the upgraded graphics

687
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,680
from the PlayStation 2 and the additional features.

688
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,040
But yeah, it was on the GameCube too.

689
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,620
So they could have hybrid, you know, some bastard child of the GameCube and PlayStation

690
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,620
2 versions.

691
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,120
So what you're basically trying to say is I'm right and you're wrong.

692
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,120
Yes!

693
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:03,120
That's exact, thank you for nailing home my point there.

694
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,120
You're welcome.

695
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,120
That's what I do here.

696
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:09,560
All right, since these games won't be out until next year at the earliest, let's talk

697
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,400
about some stuff you can get right now, this week.

698
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,320
Definitely, and there's going to be lots of fun stuff coming out this week.

699
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:25,880
Some stuff, I don't know, people, why you want them or not, but of the many things the

700
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,320
ever controversial Eye of Judgment is coming out this week on PlayStation 3.

701
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:37,840
Yes, you will be able to play your Magic the Gathering type of crap with the eye, the PlayStation

702
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
Eye.

703
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,280
And remember folks, if one million copies of this game sell, Loki will dress up in a

704
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,240
tingle outfit and set an Eye of Judgment on fire for your very pleasure.

705
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,660
He should dance around it.

706
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,000
I think you should do this anyway because it'll be so fun.

707
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,520
I'm not going to do that.

708
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,520
You should burn it.

709
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,520
Stop trying to cop out.

710
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,680
Okay, if it doesn't sell a million though, while we will not require you to dress as

711
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,120
tingle, you need to at least wear the hat and burn it.

712
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,720
What hat?

713
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,520
Can we negotiate that maybe if they can sell 50,000 units, you'll just wear the little

714
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,400
green hat and set it on fire?

715
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,920
I'm not doing that.

716
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,560
It's all or nothing.

717
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,560
Damn it.

718
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,360
Will you at least set one on fire?

719
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,720
Maybe if someone sends me one for free, I'll set one on fire.

720
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,760
We should dance around it.

721
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,560
I'm not going to buy one to set one on fire.

722
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,560
That's stupid.

723
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,560
Let's see.

724
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,840
If we all put in 20 bucks, we could buy one to set on fire.

725
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,840
Come on.

726
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,840
Anyways.

727
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,840
BurnMyEyeOfJudgment.com.

728
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:39,800
Ace Combat 6 is coming out on Xbox 360, so that's pretty interesting.

729
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
I don't know.

730
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,960
It's a good game.

731
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,320
Client Marker's Jericho is coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

732
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,440
It's a horror first person shooter game.

733
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:53,680
Conan also coming out in both systems as well, and as I reviewed it, it's pretty good, so

734
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,880
definitely worth checking it out.

735
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,880
Let's see.

736
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,280
King of Fighters XI on PlayStation 2.

737
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,320
And that's a really budget game too, $14.99 if I remember correctly.

738
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,240
Dancing with the Stars on the Wii and PlayStation 2.

739
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,240
And you know what?

740
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,240
Yippee.

741
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,240
That sounds fun.

742
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,240
Actually, it's only on the Wii this week.

743
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,940
PlayStation 2 is coming out later, but sadly enough, it doesn't look that bad.

744
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:21,720
The models in it look pretty decent, and the game's kind of a rhythm music game.

745
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,000
Do you have the professional dancers that are on the show?

746
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,280
Yeah, the show dancers, whoever's on the show.

747
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,280
I don't watch the show.

748
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,440
But are there celebrities programmed in?

749
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,440
Yeah, there's celebrities in there, but they move pretty smooth from the video I saw.

750
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,080
I'm not buying it, but hey.

751
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,560
Well, I think it would be a good idea if they used the X-Tango engine.

752
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,160
It might be cool to rent it.

753
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,720
I don't know if it's the X-Tango engine.

754
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,720
Hold on.

755
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,200
Are you guys actually hyping the Dancing with the Stars video game?

756
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,200
I would do it.

757
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,900
Dude, it's like 20 bucks, okay?

758
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,360
I like Dancing with the Stars.

759
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,360
I like X-Tango.

760
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,640
I guess I'll give you that.

761
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,640
Hey, hey.

762
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,440
I'm not saying this game is X-Tango, okay, because we're not going to dirty the X-Tango

763
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,440
name with this game.

764
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
Sorry.

765
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,440
My bad.

766
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,440
Apologies to the folks behind X-Tango.

767
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,480
Actually, I do like Dancing with the Stars, Rob.

768
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,480
Really?

769
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,480
But you don't watch TV, I thought.

770
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:15,280
I watch the dances on YouTube, because it was all about the Stacey Keebler series.

771
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,280
Okay.

772
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,160
PlayStation 3 is getting quite a few games here.

773
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,840
Juice 2, Hot Import Nights, yeah, you're finally getting that now.

774
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,600
Ratchet and Clank, Future Tools of Destruction, that should be pretty awesome.

775
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,040
Ratatouille, that's coming out.

776
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,840
And let's see here.

777
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:38,360
On the Wii, actually in PlayStation 2 as well, Nicktoons Attack of the Toy Bots.

778
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,240
This week also, the game I was just making fun of, Zack and Wiki, the Quest for Barbaros

779
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,180
Treasure is also coming out.

780
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,180
How dare you.

781
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:50,640
Namco Museum Remix, hooray, that's also coming out on the Wii.

782
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,640
And then let's see here.

783
00:40:52,640 --> 00:41:01,640
Of course, on PSP, Castlevania Dracula X Chronicles, Warriors of the Lost Empires, I have no idea

784
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:09,320
what that is, and then see Spongebob Atlantis Squarepantis also coming out as well.

785
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:19,760
And on the DS, Phoenix Wright Trials and Tribulations, Mega Man X, or Mega Man ZX Advent, and Spanish

786
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,120
for Everyone, Naruto Path of the Ninja.

787
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,840
Wait, is that the name of a game, Spanish for Everyone?

788
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,840
Spanish for Everyone.

789
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,640
I want to say there's- What do you do in Spanish for Everyone?

790
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,640
You learn Spanish.

791
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,760
Oh.

792
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:44,480
Let's see here, Chess Master, The Art of Learning, that's what it's called, Imagine Master Chef.

793
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,760
I think the rest of the Imagine games are coming out this week.

794
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,760
Oh, that's right.

795
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,360
Imagine Animal Doctor is also coming out.

796
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,600
Imagine Babies.

797
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,960
Imagine Fashion Designer and Imagine Master Chef.

798
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,240
Finally, Imagine Babies.

799
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,240
You know what I want?

800
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,280
I want Imagine Sniper.

801
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,640
Sorry.

802
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,080
Unfortunately, Sniper's not that popular with little girls.

803
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,080
I wanted to be a sniper.

804
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:09,240
When it does become popular, they will have Imagine Snipers, but unfortunately, they don't

805
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,240
right now.

806
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,840
GS68 says, Imagine John Lennon.

807
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:17,280
Imagine, or I'm sorry, Pocket Pets, which is yet another pet raising sim, and apparently,

808
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,560
judging by the cover, it features bunnies, kittens, and little birdies.

809
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,080
Yay.

810
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,280
Where's the hippopotamuses, or hippopotami?

811
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,660
Tiger Claws says, Imagine OLR, by the way.

812
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:38,040
And then, I was going to say also, Naruto Clash of Ninja Revolution on Wii, and finally

813
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,480
just a small little game, of course, on almost everything.

814
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:46,720
PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, 360, Wii, and maybe the PC this week.

815
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,760
And actually, a week from now, Guitar Hero 3 will be making its way out.

816
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,760
So.

817
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,760
Excellent.

818
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,760
On a Sunday.

819
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,920
Wait, is that out this Tuesday?

820
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,920
It's out on next Sunday.

821
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,920
Oh, it's on Sunday.

822
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,760
On the 28th.

823
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,840
Because they have to be so cool Sunday.

824
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,560
This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, Guitar Hero 3, for everybody.

825
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,560
Let's see here.

826
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,640
I was going to say, I'm looking real quick on the PC stuff.

827
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:16,600
Oh, there are some interesting PC games I was going to mention real quick.

828
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:21,720
Dream Day Honeymoon, which I have no idea what that is, but I want to take a look here

829
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,720
real quick.

830
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,480
You want to go on a Dream Day Honeymoon?

831
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,480
Dream Day Honeymoon.

832
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,080
Actually, there's no information for that whatsoever, but that is available if you're

833
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,200
curious.

834
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:34,480
And some Agatha Christie game.

835
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,480
That's it.

836
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,800
Alright, let's travel over to Japan and see what our friends overseas in Japan are picking

837
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,800
up this week.

838
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:48,080
You can get on the Xbox 360, Bladestorm, the 100 Years War is coming out on the Xbox 360.

839
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:53,000
That's from Koei, who I believe brought you Dynasty Wars.

840
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,840
And oh, I forgot to mention, US Tomb Raider Anniversary on the 360.

841
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,840
It's my turn now.

842
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,840
My turn.

843
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,840
I'm done.

844
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,840
I'm done.

845
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,840
Alright.

846
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,400
Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party.

847
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:10,000
You Bimani fans over in Japan get a chance now with the Wii version of DDR, the latest

848
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,760
title finally hitting Japanese shelves this week.

849
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,920
I remember back in the day, it used to be the other way around.

850
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,920
Japan would get these games years before we would get them, and now it seems like we get

851
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,920
a few of these first.

852
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,620
Because I think the same thing happened with Supernova 2, I don't remember.

853
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:31,340
Also on the Nintendo Wii, Ghost Squad is coming out from Sega in Japan.

854
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:34,840
Also coming out on the Wii, the Simple Wii series.

855
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:41,480
There's volume 1, the Mina de Kart Race, and there's volume 2, the Mina de Basuri Takai

856
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,720
is coming out.

857
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,480
So I'm assuming that's like fishing and kart racing?

858
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,880
It's like a Mario Kart game.

859
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,880
Yeah.

860
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,560
That's fucking awesome that the Simple series is coming to the Wii.

861
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,560
Interesting.

862
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,480
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, a game from Sega, it's an action-adventure game, it looks

863
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,600
kind of scary.

864
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,840
It's called Imabe Kisu.

865
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,640
Do we have this game over here, or is this something that's coming out, being ported

866
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,640
over here?

867
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,440
I have not heard of this game, and I don't see screenshots.

868
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,440
No.

869
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,440
Let me see if I can find it.

870
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,440
What was it?

871
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,440
PlayStation 3, you said?

872
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,440
Yeah, it's on PlayStation 3.

873
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,620
I think it's done by the guy who did the Ring series and stuff like that.

874
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,620
It's kind of like that.

875
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:17,440
It's kind of a horror type of game.

876
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,480
That might be kind of fun.

877
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,720
Cool.

878
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,280
Also coming out on the PlayStation 3, you've been waiting for this one.

879
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,740
Let's make sure it sells a million copies.

880
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:29,320
The Eye of Judgment comes out on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.

881
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:34,480
Also coming out in Japan on the PlayStation 2, hey, God of War 2, the end begins.

882
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,920
Finally making its way with a Japanese translation this week.

883
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:43,580
Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, Itsuka Todoku Anosora Ni is coming out.

884
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:48,320
That's an adventure game that looks to be based on yet another anime starring cute little

885
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,360
girls in schoolgirl outfits.

886
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:56,280
Also coming out on the PlayStation 3, Baldur Bullet Equilibrium coming from Alchemist.

887
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,920
It looks like another mech warrior type game.

888
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:07,080
On the Nintendo DS, Dungeon Maker, Mahou no Shovel Tu Chisa Na Yuusha.

889
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,600
It's a role playing game, but hence the title, Dungeon Maker.

890
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,420
Some of you guys like to customize your own stuff, you'll probably enjoy that.

891
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:20,680
Also coming out on the Nintendo DS, Final Fantasy Tactics A2, hooray, I know a lot of

892
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,400
folks have been waiting for the next tactics game on the DS.

893
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,520
If you haven't played the one on the PSP yet, which I've heard a lot of good things about,

894
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,200
although I have not unfortunately picked this title up myself yet.

895
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:36,000
And lastly but not leastly, I love this title on the Nintendo DS, this is a great title,

896
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,300
The Frog Man Show comes out.

897
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,500
That's the best ever.

898
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,280
On the Nintendo DS.

899
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:48,520
And it looks to be, they say it's an action game, but it looks like kind of like a bunch

900
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,520
of different little mini games.

901
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,080
It looks like another one of those types of games.

902
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,280
We should have action mini games.

903
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,080
Action based mini games.

904
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,520
That's it for Japanese releases.

905
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:01,560
Well, moving over to the UK, we have some stuff.

906
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:06,800
On the 23rd, Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney, Trials and Tribulations, 26 Aqua Team Hunger

907
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:12,800
4 Zombie Ninja Pro-Am, I think that's the best name ever.

908
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:19,800
On the 26th, Castlevania, The Dracula X Chronicles, Clive Barker's Jericho, Coded Arms Contagion,

909
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:26,400
Escape from Paradise City on PC, I'm sorry on PSP, Escape from Paradise City on PC, Jackass

910
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:32,080
the Game on PSP, Juice 2, Hot in Fortnite, King of Clubs, Metroid Prime 3, Corruption

911
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:40,040
on Wii, NBA 2K8, NBA Live 08, NHL 2K8, Paint by DS, Portal on Playstation 3, Pro Evolution

912
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:46,960
Soccer 2008 on a bunch of stuff, Stranglehold, Siphon Filter Dark Mirror, Team Fortress 2,

913
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:54,240
The Sims 2 Castaway, The Witcher on PC, Retro Fighter 5, Who the Hell Cares, Wipe Out Pulse

914
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,920
on PSP, and Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 on PSP.

915
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,560
All right, awesome.

916
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:09,920
Well, in un-gaming release news, apparently this week they've been having some interesting

917
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,640
guests on The Morning Show here in the U.S. and...

918
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,200
Okay, first off, what the hell's The Morning Show?

919
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,200
I've never heard of that.

920
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,200
Is that like a...

921
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,080
That's not The Today Show or anything.

922
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,640
No, it's The Morning Show.

923
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,640
I've never heard of it.

924
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,640
I've never heard of it either.

925
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,640
All right.

926
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,820
Anyways, apparently The Morning Show, I have no idea who that is, features such wonderful

927
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:37,200
guests as Voldemort and apparently this wonderful woman who goes to bash Halo 3, and actually

928
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:42,560
I guess just violent games in general, Susan Bartell, she apparently says, when kids play

929
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:48,280
violent video games, we can see that their brains are different than when they play non-violent

930
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,280
games.

931
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,800
We can see a very big difference in their brains, which tells us how dangerous these

932
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:59,440
games can be.

933
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,520
Just an FYI, according to Wikipedia, The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet is mostly on Fox

934
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,720
and my network TV stations.

935
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,160
It's syndicated.

936
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,280
Yay!

937
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:17,520
So basically, they're saying that, I guess she wrapped the whole segment up by saying

938
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:23,960
they're going to react in the same highly aroused, angry way that we saw what happened

939
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,960
yesterday.

940
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,040
Of course, they were talking about a school shooting that happened in Cleveland that she

941
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,440
was referencing back to that.

942
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:35,400
Well, here's the interesting thing about that though, you see, because Game Politics

943
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:40,640
actually went and asked her about that because they had some issues with it.

944
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:47,640
One of the things that they found concerning, I guess, was a comment when they saw the Indiana

945
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:52,680
University brain scan pick five minutes before the airing of the show.

946
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:58,600
So she had looked at basically the brain scan image literally minutes before the show started

947
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:03,960
and they're saying, well, how can you base your professional opinion on just a brief

948
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,460
glance at it?

949
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:12,840
And she was saying, well, it's not concrete proof, but that doesn't change anything, blah,

950
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,840
blah, blah.

951
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:20,160
And they're saying that maybe it was a little bit sensationalized because it's on TV and

952
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,160
stuff.

953
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:25,120
So they understand how you feel, there's an element of sensationalism to it, I suppose.

954
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:30,440
I couldn't five minutes before going on air say, sorry, I won't do it.

955
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,480
I don't have enough background information about this brain scan.

956
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,480
I'm not that much of a purist.

957
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,840
So basically she was talking out of her ass.

958
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,840
Awesome.

959
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:45,600
And then the follow up with the whole thing, Game Politics, also ran another story about,

960
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:52,240
I guess is being reported in Scientific America, Richard Tremblay, a professor of pediatrics,

961
00:50:52,240 --> 00:51:00,320
psychiatry and psychology said that kids were aggressive before modern media came along.

962
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:04,320
So we can't blame modern media for kids being aggressive.

963
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:11,560
Well, then again, wasn't there the study on how underage crime decreased?

964
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,680
People just want to blame something because they don't want to cop up to shit.

965
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,780
That's all it is.

966
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:20,000
And I hate when they get these experts out there that start blah, blah, blah, blah.

967
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
They tell someone what they want to hear and then they invite them on all these shows.

968
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
All right.

969
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,680
You know I got to get some chat room feedback because you know they are lit up on this story.

970
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:33,360
Kiki says, I did a report on video games and violence for school and in my research found

971
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:37,600
that only violent kids get violent in games.

972
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,960
Blaze says, couldn't various games cause the same brain scan read?

973
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:48,120
Darkshy wants to know why are all school shootings blamed on video games and GS68 is wondering

974
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:53,080
since we call Tack Jompson because we don't want to call him by name and he's effectively

975
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,640
banned from the show, since we call him Lord Voldemort, just in case you're first time

976
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:01,160
listening and you wonder who the hell is Voldemort, it's you know that guy, that lawyer guy that

977
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:07,400
needs to SDF you, GS68 is wondering should we call this lady Bellatrix Lestrange?

978
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:15,820
To be honest, I don't think she's going to be randomly posting on different websites

979
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:21,200
about shit making threats and acting purely crazy.

980
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,040
So I don't think we really need to worry about calling her anything else since obviously

981
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,000
she's going to be out of the news.

982
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
We should call her loser.

983
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,720
You know what, I agree with what Shadow Charlie said and honestly I think this just pretty

984
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,840
much sums up our feedback.

985
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:38,400
Shadow Charlie in our chatroom says she can shut the fuck up.

986
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:44,980
She really can and you know people like this just get our anger going and our blood boiling.

987
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:49,360
You knew, you knew when you read this story on Game Politics or wherever you might have

988
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:53,840
seen it earlier this week, you knew that on this program, this segment would be following

989
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,620
a story about this stupid, stupid woman.

990
00:52:56,620 --> 00:53:13,680
It's the FUs of the week.

991
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:21,700
My FU of the week goes towards certain things at my place of employment without getting

992
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:30,680
into too much detail about what I do for a living, I work a job that they assign tasks

993
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:35,800
to me that I'm supposed to have done within a certain number of days, right?

994
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,200
And on average I do about 70 to 80 a day.

995
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:47,040
So I come in one day and there's 600 and something of them and so I closed 110 that day which

996
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,040
is a lot more than I usually do.

997
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,640
I came back the next day, there were 704.

998
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,940
I closed 90 that day.

999
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:58,200
I came back in, there were 780.

1000
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,520
So yeah.

1001
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:07,640
I have a right to complain about this because if I don't finish enough of it within my turnaround

1002
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:10,560
time then it comes back and I get dinged for it.

1003
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:20,440
So don't be surprised when certain things happen, is all I'm going to say.

1004
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:24,360
Oh yeah and every time I try to apply for another position at work I'm written up for

1005
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,360
something.

1006
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,360
Hmm.

1007
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:30,680
Alright, Loki, let loose, FUs of the week.

1008
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:36,160
Fuck you to Kanye West for ruining Harder Better Faster Stronger by Daft Punk and trying

1009
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:42,440
to claim, I guess make his own song by sampling that entire thing.

1010
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,640
He's awful as an artist to begin with and I also watched Saturday Night Live, they had

1011
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,280
another song that he did where he sampled Pretty Young Thing from Michael Jackson.

1012
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,480
Once again an unoriginal bastard who needs to fucking die.

1013
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:59,180
I mean he has no talent and I hate people that fucking sample shit, you know.

1014
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:05,900
Also looking at you Black Eyed Peas, you fucking suck too so FU the both of them.

1015
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:12,160
My FU of the week goes to children that go to Disneyland because kids ruin Disneyland

1016
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,160
seriously.

1017
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:17,520
Let's see what else, so what if supposedly Disneyland is for them.

1018
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,200
I say they ruin it.

1019
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:24,380
Also FU to the blaring hot sun, it's like October and in LA the sun was shining like

1020
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:30,240
so horribly, it was horrible, so I want to say FU to that and FU to the fact that my

1021
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,560
vacation is over and I have to go back to work tomorrow.

1022
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,400
That sucks.

1023
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,480
That's it though for the FUs of the week.

1024
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:44,360
Let's get back into some news and I'll start it off with a story about Nintendo and guess

1025
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:51,120
what Nintendo has decided that much like Sega's done recently with the Dreamcast, Nintendo

1026
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:57,480
will be ending all hardware support for the Famicom, Super Famicom, Nintendo 64, Game

1027
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,240
Boy and Game Boy Pocket.

1028
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:05,360
The reason they're citing, rarity and scarcity of repair parts.

1029
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:10,120
Now when I first read this I was actually surprised, they've still been repairing Famicoms

1030
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:15,760
this long, but apparently they were and unfortunately now it is over.

1031
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:20,860
Again this is just Nintendo of Japan but still, you know, dude seriously if you have a broken

1032
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:25,320
Nintendo now go out and buy something else, I mean seriously, why are you still playing

1033
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,320
Nintendo?

1034
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,600
Bad news for retro collectors though.

1035
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,840
I wonder though if, well you know that means that the prices of these systems are going

1036
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:38,360
to go up because to use pinball as a comparison, for machines that start seeing revivals when

1037
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:43,600
you can start getting parts for them again, the price of the tables goes down but when

1038
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:49,040
they stop making the replacement plastics and stuff for some of the other tables, the

1039
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,440
value jumps up by at least $5,000.

1040
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,880
To be honest a lot of people that are collecting these retro systems anyways probably know

1041
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:58,600
how to fix them or if they don't know how to fix them, know of somebody who can fix

1042
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,600
them.

1043
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,560
There are other websites or have extras or there are other people out there that know

1044
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,640
how to fix these systems, it's not just Nintendo.

1045
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,160
Here's a thought, I bet this is why they're ending the support now.

1046
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:15,360
Why would they want to encourage people to buy the games at garage sales and stuff on

1047
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:19,160
these old systems when they have this brand spanking new virtual console that's delivering

1048
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,840
all the games from these old consoles?

1049
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,880
This is why they're ending support now, I'll bet you.

1050
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,880
Just a thought.

1051
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,680
I think it's just because of what they actually said.

1052
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,440
No I think I'm right and you're wrong.

1053
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,240
Well I mean Game Boy Color, we don't see any Game Boy Color stuff on fucking...

1054
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,240
Yet.

1055
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,240
Yet.

1056
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,240
Oh come on.

1057
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,240
It would look like shit.

1058
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:45,140
This is my theory behind it, why waste manpower on something the company itself has decided

1059
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:52,280
was obsolete when they can focus towards their current thing and it's sort of like paying

1060
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,960
somebody to fix a Betamax, you know?

1061
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:00,600
I kind of buy that, that makes sense to me, but at the same time, why didn't they do that

1062
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,360
ten years ago with the Famicom?

1063
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,360
You know?

1064
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,840
I mean Famicom's been out like twenty years.

1065
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:08,120
But ten years ago I think that they still had a big enough user base, because ten years

1066
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,520
ago, what was it that we were seeing out?

1067
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:15,320
I was still playing my Super Nintendo, I think the N64 had just been out.

1068
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,560
Because the Famicom's still probably outselling the PlayStation 3?

1069
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:22,680
And on top of that, the only way you could get any of your retro games is to either own

1070
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,600
the old system or to play on emulators.

1071
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:30,960
But now we have it to where all these games are being re-released on, you know, we have

1072
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:37,680
Virtual Console, we have Xbox Live Arcade, and so they're looking at it as progress.

1073
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:43,200
What's the point now when they can get the same thing on one of our more up-to-date systems?

1074
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,040
So why should they waste the support and manpower and product?

1075
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:51,080
Well if they make some systems actually put on the market, you know, so we can buy them

1076
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,320
to replace our broken Famicom.

1077
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:58,000
Maybe that's why they gotta pull the old support, get some people on the assembly line.

1078
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:04,840
And to go back to my, I guess, analogy to the Betamax, you know, you can't get Sony

1079
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:08,120
to replace your Betamax machine, but you can go to specialty repair shops and they'll do

1080
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,120
it.

1081
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,120
It's gonna be the same way with old systems.

1082
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,120
Alright.

1083
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:15,600
Wow, I didn't think we'd have this much conversation over this story, this was just supposed to

1084
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,280
be a little niche piece, but very interesting.

1085
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:22,320
I guess we all in the room feel very passionately about retro gaming, especially Dark Soccer

1086
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,680
of course, we've got our classic game of the week coming up in just a little bit.

1087
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,680
But first, more news!

1088
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:33,760
Probably five people have heard of, anyway, virtual console stuff for the UK, wee!

1089
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:40,320
So what we are seeing out this time is World Heroes, which was a Neo Geo game.

1090
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:45,880
Not really one of my favorite fighters, but it was pretty, pretty good, and it's 900 points.

1091
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:51,440
And then coming up is a Gate of Thunder from the TurboGrafx-16.

1092
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:57,980
It was made by Hudson, and that was a pretty damn good game, where you have your ship called

1093
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:02,280
the Hunting Dog, and you are saving the starlight power.

1094
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:06,800
But I think that it's cool because the planet referred to as planet Ares, and I'm an Ares,

1095
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:07,800
so that's cool.

1096
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:08,800
It's 800 points.

1097
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:14,580
And, and then, and for anyone who watches the Angry Nintendo Nerd, you'll know where

1098
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:17,760
my frustration with this game comes from for exactly the same reason he did.

1099
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:24,400
Castlevania II, Simon's Quest for the NES, where, you know, it turns night time, and

1100
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,400
then it turns day time, and then you can't save your game, and you have to start over

1101
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,600
from the beginning, and you lose all your shit, and oh my god that game is frustrating,

1102
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,400
and then Dracula's like, butt easy.

1103
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,480
Yeah, I remember that too, that was crazy.

1104
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:42,000
Now wait, since she's doing dates in the UK, I don't recall we've gotten Simon's Quest

1105
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
in the US yet, right?

1106
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:50,360
I don't think, that's a frickin' awesome game though, despite the frustration, I love the

1107
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:55,400
game, and honestly, the music is half of what makes that game, so I'm hoping it's over here

1108
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,640
on Monday.

1109
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:01,120
I would like to see us get the Japanese version of Castlevania III.

1110
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,080
What was the difference between that and this one, I don't...

1111
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:07,440
It was certain gameplay factions that they took out, like for example, if you use the,

1112
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,360
oh god I can't remember his name now, the guy who used the dagger?

1113
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:11,360
Grant.

1114
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,360
Grant, yes.

1115
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:16,200
In the Japanese version, he would throw the dagger, and so it gave you range of attack

1116
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,200
with him.

1117
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,200
Hmm.

1118
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,280
Yeah, that's just one of the things I remember.

1119
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:24,520
I always like to use Alucard, because he can turn into the bat.

1120
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,200
I like Grant, because he can climb on walls.

1121
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,760
I guess that's true, and then there was the guy that had the orbs, right?

1122
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:29,760
I don't even remember.

1123
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:30,760
That was Saifa.

1124
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:31,760
Wow.

1125
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,760
That's old school.

1126
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,760
Yeah.

1127
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:34,760
Alright.

1128
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,960
Oh, by the way, that's 500 points.

1129
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,960
Tigerclaw would like to point out Dark Sakura, also the fact that it had two different endings,

1130
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,800
and one of them, Simon Belmont, dies.

1131
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,800
Yes.

1132
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,800
That was the other thing.

1133
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:50,560
I've played the disc version of it, luckily I've played a disc version of it, and the

1134
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:53,880
music was also a little bit different, but then again, the disc games had a different

1135
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:54,880
music processor.

1136
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,800
I was going to say, didn't they have an extra sound channel in Japan?

1137
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,800
Yeah.

1138
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:58,800
For that stuff?

1139
01:01:58,800 --> 01:01:59,800
Yeah.

1140
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,200
I think I remember one of my old roommates, who was really into collecting games, had

1141
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:05,240
the old, old Castlevania III, and that was part of the reason.

1142
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,600
That was the first time I had played it, though.

1143
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:11,680
I played a disc one later on than that, but he brought it over to my house.

1144
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:12,680
Ah.

1145
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:13,680
I never played it.

1146
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:14,680
Yeah.

1147
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:15,680
Yep.

1148
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:16,680
Alright.

1149
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:22,240
Well, soon enough, GameTap will be hitting 1,000 games, and they're supposed to hit this

1150
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:27,320
wonderful landmark achievement on November 15th.

1151
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:31,160
But in the meantime, they will be getting some pretty cool stuff this week, including

1152
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,760
Clive Barker's Jericho.

1153
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,760
And the Sam & Max Season 2 will be starting here pretty soon, on November 8th, with Ice

1154
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:47,640
Station Santa, and I guess Season 1's episode, Abe Lincoln Must Die, I guess is available

1155
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,440
free right now.

1156
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:56,440
Mr. Uru Online's final episode in the Season 1 story arc will begin the 1st of November,

1157
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:02,040
and let's see here, I guess now the first three Hitman games will be free to play for

1158
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:07,080
the non-subscribers, as that part of kind of a free game sampling that they have there

1159
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,080
that's ad-supported.

1160
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:15,280
And I guess a new season of Revisioned, which before was looking at Lara Croft, Davin said

1161
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:20,720
which character we're going to do this time, or which series, and then game trailers for

1162
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:21,720
various games.

1163
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:22,720
Alright.

1164
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:23,720
Sounds like fun.

1165
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:29,400
I keep neglecting to go back to GameTap and checking out some of those other new games

1166
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,400
that they have, like Blast Miner.

1167
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,600
I wanted to check, because now they're starting to put out the indie games, too, and I'm pretty

1168
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:37,640
sure Blast Miner finally made its way to GameTap, so I gotta check out some of the indie stuff

1169
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,400
they have on there.

1170
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:44,240
I still wish, though, they have Civilization III up in their archives, but they don't have

1171
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,600
Civ I.

1172
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:49,040
And I, for whatever reason, and I know I've gone into this tirade on the show before,

1173
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:54,440
so I'll keep it short tonight, but I prefer Civilization I, the old school one, compared

1174
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:57,080
to any other Civ they've released since then.

1175
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:02,720
So Sid Meier, if you happen to be listening, please let them have Civilization on GameTap.

1176
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,980
Also I would love you if you'd let them have Covert Action, because that was like my favorite

1177
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:10,960
Sid Meier game ever, and probably nobody's ever heard of it.

1178
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:19,280
Anyhow, speaking of games that you can download quickly, of course we all know the WiiWare

1179
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:23,320
is coming out very soon, and one game people are very excited about on the WiiWare is the

1180
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,320
Final Fantasy game.

1181
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:29,600
It's the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Little King in the Promised Country.

1182
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:35,880
This game is going to be out March 2008 in Japan, and it's going to be priced at 1,500

1183
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:39,760
Wii Points, which of course would be $15 here in the US.

1184
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,320
So at least this gives you some type of idea to what kind of pricing you're probably going

1185
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:46,900
to see for the WiiWare, although not too much of a surprise.

1186
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:50,880
This is pretty competitive with the Xbox Live pricing, because you consider a game like

1187
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:55,960
Luminous was also $15, a Final Fantasy game is going to be definitely an A-list title

1188
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:00,080
for the service, so it's not too surprising that they're going to want to charge $15 for

1189
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,080
that.

1190
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,560
Although actually Luminous got a price cut recently, didn't it?

1191
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:03,560
It's only $10 now.

1192
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:04,560
Not this week.

1193
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,560
Yeah.

1194
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:07,560
So there you have it.

1195
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:10,800
Looking forward to getting more information on the game, all we know so far is that there

1196
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:16,060
is a main character named the Little King, and he creates towns to basically build up

1197
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:17,060
a new country.

1198
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:22,640
He uses special powers to make elemental skills, and basically this is all used to develop

1199
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:23,640
the land.

1200
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:26,480
So it almost sounds like it's some type of sim game, because you get...

1201
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,320
It's like one half of Actraiser.

1202
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,320
Dirty work.

1203
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,720
Hey, no problem with that.

1204
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:31,720
I freaking love Actraiser.

1205
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:32,720
You know what?

1206
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,480
I think if I had a kid, I'd name him Little King.

1207
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,680
Son of Dad says, Wii needs a hard drive bad.

1208
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:44,680
Yeah, I am curious how, yeah, I am also curious how the Wii is going to fit all this stuff

1209
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:45,680
in here.

1210
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,120
I wouldn't be surprised, Nintendo's going to come out sometime next year.

1211
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:50,280
That's what the SD cards are for.

1212
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,280
Not just that.

1213
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,880
They're going to come out at some point, and they're going to say, we have this super hidden

1214
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:59,160
expansion port thing, and we're bringing out this thing.

1215
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:03,920
If you invert your Wii, you'll find the port hidden somewhere on the system of the board.

1216
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:07,160
Well, there are expansion ports that aren't being used on there right now, right?

1217
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,160
Or USB, right?

1218
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,160
Hell, if you...

1219
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,160
It's got USB connections.

1220
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,160
Yeah, it does have USB.

1221
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:14,520
Hell, if you even wanted to get crazy with it, you could have something that plugs into

1222
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:19,240
like the memory card slots and the controller ports or something, and it just expands on

1223
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:22,480
the top where the GameCube stuff is, plugs in that, and has additional storage.

1224
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,480
I don't know.

1225
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,480
Whatever.

1226
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,480
They can get crazy.

1227
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,480
It'd probably be USB.

1228
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,480
That would be the change.

1229
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,480
I'm kind of irritated because they have all these hard drives that run on USB now, right?

1230
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,960
I mean, like, I think I saw one at Target the other day.

1231
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:37,120
Yeah, yeah, Jamie has one, but I've seen, now they even have new ones that are 500 gigabytes.

1232
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,040
Five hundred gigabyte USB drive.

1233
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,040
Mine's 500 gigabytes.

1234
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,040
Is it really?

1235
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,040
I thought you said it had like a 300 or something.

1236
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,040
I paid 120 for it.

1237
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,040
Oh, my God.

1238
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,040
Oh, my gosh.

1239
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:49,240
500 gigabytes for one of those things, and I can't, it's USB, but I can't hook it up

1240
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:53,320
to my Wii, or I can't hook it up to my 360, and I can't, I mean, because of...

1241
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:57,000
Because you know they're going to want you to use anything with their name on it so they

1242
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,440
can market it and make money on it.

1243
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,600
And I'm just saying that sucks.

1244
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,080
Because seriously, what else am I going to fill up the 500 gigabytes with besides lots

1245
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:06,200
of pornography, lots and lots of pornography?

1246
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,200
They're going to find a way.

1247
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,200
They're going to find a way.

1248
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,200
Lots and lots.

1249
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,200
I don't know.

1250
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:14,240
It's quite a few Xbox 360 games quite easily.

1251
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,240
In theory.

1252
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,760
Next story, please.

1253
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:21,960
Well, Mad Cats has decided that they're going to give their support to the National Breast

1254
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:32,880
Cancer Foundation and release a pink tech pack for the DS Lite.

1255
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:39,080
It will have accessories that have like a carry case, a power adapter for your car,

1256
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:46,440
USB charge cable, two game cases, and two of the stylus pens.

1257
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,720
So that's pretty cool.

1258
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:54,200
And there's going to be a percentage from the purchase of this that's going to go toward,

1259
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:58,160
you know, like I said, the National Breast Cancer Foundation and retail for $19.99.

1260
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:02,040
Well, good for gaming and fundraising colliding.

1261
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,040
That's a good thing.

1262
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:07,280
Going back to the previous story in our chat room, chat.ownerswansradio.com, Rama is pointing

1263
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:12,840
out you can get a one terabyte, that's 1,000 gigabytes, drive for $399.

1264
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:16,480
And Sephiroth1215 says, yeah, I know someone who has a one terabyte drive.

1265
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,440
What do you put on that?

1266
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:20,960
I mean, that's a lot of porn.

1267
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:21,960
That's a lot.

1268
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,680
That's like a week's worth of porn.

1269
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,680
That's what I was looking to buy was a terabyte.

1270
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,320
They sell them at Fry's.

1271
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,320
HD porn, even.

1272
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:33,000
Do you know how much HD porn you could fit on a terabyte drive?

1273
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
That's a lot.

1274
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,720
The terabyte drives are something like 300 to 400 bucks, but iOmega makes one.

1275
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,040
That's 300 to 400 hours of porn.

1276
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,040
That's amazing.

1277
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,120
Problem is, though, downloading that amount of porn, it would take lots of time.

1278
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,120
That's true.

1279
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:51,520
Well, the whole reason I bought mine was because, and now that it's happened, you know, like

1280
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:58,080
I saw it coming, my PC was dying, so I bought my hard drive to save all my crap.

1281
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:01,620
Zappy24 in chat says, a terabyte isn't as much as it seems.

1282
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:02,840
It fills fast.

1283
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:05,440
So you know who's been downloading the HD porn.

1284
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:06,440
Just teasing.

1285
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:07,440
Just teasing.

1286
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:12,900
Actually, what was taking up most of mine was, I was, I have entire seasons of Doctor

1287
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:18,420
Who and Stargate, because, you know, I don't watch TV.

1288
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:25,400
Which is borderline porn for you, because every time you see David Tennant, like, you

1289
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:28,000
get a fem boner or whatever they're called.

1290
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Fan-gasm.

1291
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Sure, a fan-gasm.

1292
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Fan-gasm.

1293
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Okay.

1294
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
A girl boner.

1295
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,440
A girl boner.

1296
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,880
So one thing that really shouldn't collide, but for some reason this year has been colliding

1297
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:44,200
more than I would like, would be baby raising sims for the DS.

1298
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:48,220
And yet another one has come along, Crave Entertainment's Baby Pals, which should be

1299
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:55,360
coming out in November, if I remember correctly, is a baby washing, dressing, and patty caking

1300
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,360
sim.

1301
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:00,320
It's basically Nintendogs with babies.

1302
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:05,600
You have to adopt a pet human, then feed it, bathe it, dress it in funny clothes.

1303
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:13,200
You can even teach it to walk, talk, though if you do, was that the first thing?

1304
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:17,160
This is also from another article here, their comment was, though if you get them to do

1305
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:22,100
these things, they're probably saying, why the hell am I wearing these funny clothes?

1306
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:26,680
One thing though they're asking in this article, which is kind of funny, is, so if you ignore

1307
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:30,520
your Nintendogs, they run away and stuff.

1308
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,760
The babies run away.

1309
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:35,960
A baby's hitchhiking to Texas.

1310
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:43,440
If you ignore your baby, does virtual social services rep come and take them away?

1311
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:48,240
If you ignore your baby, then Child Protective Services comes and takes your baby away?

1312
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,240
That was their joke.

1313
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:50,520
I don't think that's actually what's going to happen.

1314
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,520
Oh my God, I wish.

1315
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,040
How would that be any different than the reality for some people?

1316
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,920
I was going to say, if you're Britney Spears, you might be able to benefit from this game.

1317
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:03,960
I love the picture they have on this, this Wired blog thing, it says, baby spotted you.

1318
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:04,960
It's creepy looking.

1319
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:10,480
But yeah, baby pals will be coming out for the DS in November, in a big block of stuff

1320
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:14,140
that they have, like all the Pet Series and Sim Raising shit.

1321
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:18,000
So there's Imagine Babies and Baby Pals so far, and I'm pretty sure there's going to

1322
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
be another one.

1323
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,500
Now, Loki, I know you've said you and the wife are thinking about having a baby in the

1324
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,160
not too distant future, right?

1325
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:26,880
So are you going to use this game as like a training?

1326
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:27,880
Is this something maybe you can...

1327
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:28,960
I should make her play this.

1328
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:33,680
You should buy it for Nellie, because I don't know where you're at on that one and have

1329
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:34,720
a baby thing.

1330
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:38,960
But if maybe you want to hold off a little bit, I say buy this game for Nellie and make

1331
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,280
sure that Child Protective Services doesn't take her Nintendbaby away.

1332
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:44,240
I just want to buy this.

1333
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:50,880
To me, this game poses the challenge of the Sims.

1334
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,680
The Sims, you're supposed to make the family thrive and yadda, yadda, yadda, but all I

1335
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:57,200
want to do in the Sims is try to kill them.

1336
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:03,200
So in Baby Pals, it's like, how can I possibly abuse these Sim babies?

1337
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:08,760
I mean, just like in Nintendogs, you can kind of like, I don't know, throw the Frisbee at

1338
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,880
their head and stuff.

1339
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,880
It'd be fun.

1340
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:18,040
Kiki just recently had a baby, apparently, and is saying, uh-huh, oh, she's born and

1341
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:20,520
sitting on my lap listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1342
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,520
Be careful.

1343
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,700
That could be minus points for the baby.

1344
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:29,200
That may be one step closer to CPS coming down, no, I'm just kidding.

1345
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,600
Congratulations though, seriously.

1346
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,760
New babies are fun.

1347
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,080
When they're real babies, they're good things.

1348
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:38,800
When they're Sim babies, they're stupid.

1349
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,440
I have to say, I've met a good baby.

1350
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,440
Yeah.

1351
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:45,320
My friend Becky, her baby, quiet.

1352
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,320
Well-behaved.

1353
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:53,720
Yeah, Brihoma says the baby's going to ask, Mommy, what's a girl boner?

1354
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:54,720
Wow.

1355
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,720
Oh, cool, Deakman.

1356
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:02,760
Oh, it's Deakman, okay, it's Deakman's partner.

1357
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,400
Kiki's my girlfriend and that's my baby.

1358
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,400
Oh, okay.

1359
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,680
Oh, the whole family's listening to OLR together.

1360
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:12,960
That's so- One, two, three, aww.

1361
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,960
Wow.

1362
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,720
Message to the baby, stop crying so much.

1363
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:20,900
Mommy and Daddy value their sleep.

1364
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:21,900
Just kidding.

1365
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:24,840
All right, let's move on with some news.

1366
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:28,600
Moving on to a completely different field here, MMOs.

1367
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:31,440
You know, people love their MMOs.

1368
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:35,800
The World of Warcraft is still dominating as always, but there's some other MMOs you

1369
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,880
may not have heard about.

1370
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:45,480
RF Online is creating an MMO and the MMO is called- I'm sorry, RF Online is the game.

1371
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:49,160
It's actually being made by Codemasters.

1372
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:52,900
RF Online is now a free game.

1373
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:58,240
The game came out back in 2006, didn't really get noticed by a lot of people, but the game

1374
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:03,880
is now completely free to download and play, no monthly subscription, and there is actually

1375
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:06,160
a new content update with the game.

1376
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:12,800
It's episode two, Pioneers of Novus, so they made the game completely free.

1377
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:16,360
If you want to check this game out, I don't know, look at the screenshot, it looks a little

1378
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:21,120
bit like Phantasy Star-ish to me because it looks like it's the real-time fighting, but

1379
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:25,640
I couldn't tell you because I haven't played the game myself yet, but now that it's free,

1380
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:28,300
I might just have the incentive to do that.

1381
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:33,400
So check that out, it's RF-OnlineGame.com if you want more information.

1382
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:39,080
Well, I have a little bit of information that will make lots and lots of people happy.

1383
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:41,400
It makes me happy.

1384
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:45,640
Nights has a date.

1385
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:51,880
December 18th is going to be the release date for Night's Journey of Dreams, and in the

1386
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:56,760
UK, well, actually it just says Europe in general, will be January is when the release

1387
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:01,040
is, though there's not a specific date.

1388
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:05,260
So sorry, Nights fans, but no Christmas for you overseas.

1389
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:08,320
Did you watch the demo play for Nights?

1390
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,080
I saw some screens, but I didn't watch the demo.

1391
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:13,960
It's very, very, very cool.

1392
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:16,440
I know you're a big fan of Nights.

1393
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:19,560
Are you the one that told me Christmas Nights is one of your favorite games ever?

1394
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:23,520
Well, we have a tradition in my house around Christmas, we break out the Saturn, make sure

1395
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,120
the battery works.

1396
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:29,040
Yeah, I lost all of my Symphony of the Night data.

1397
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,480
I bet you were happy.

1398
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,000
After I maxed out everything you can with Maria.

1399
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,720
I bet you were very happy with that.

1400
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:35,720
Oh, no.

1401
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:40,880
But we play Christmas Nights every year, and we break out the Saturn in December, and we

1402
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:45,360
play all the way through the dates, and the closer you get to Christmas, I think it's

1403
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:51,000
really cool that certain, they change textures in it, they change the music, it starts snowing,

1404
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:55,600
you get snow effects on the ground the closer you get to Christmas Day, and it's really

1405
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:56,600
cool.

1406
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:57,600
All right.

1407
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,600
Well, maybe they'll do something like that with this.

1408
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:00,600
And presents.

1409
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:01,600
Maybe they'll do that here.

1410
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,600
You can play memory.

1411
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:03,600
All right.

1412
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,600
Anyhow.

1413
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:07,240
Anyways, so something really cool is actually kind of going on here.

1414
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:13,720
The folks over at Ain't It Cool News are putting together a reunion screening for what they

1415
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:19,400
call the greatest video game related yet not a video game based film of all time.

1416
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:22,300
And of course that film is The Wizard.

1417
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:29,640
It is going to be shown at Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, Texas on December 7th.

1418
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:32,580
Tickets go on sale on November 5th.

1419
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:40,300
And are available on the Alamo Drafthouse's website or www.drafthouse.com.

1420
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:44,600
If you're in the area and want to go to the screen, be sure to pick up a ticket.

1421
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:50,520
In attendance will be, let's see here, Fred Savage, director Todd Holland.

1422
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:51,840
Wow.

1423
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:57,760
And let's see, Luke Edwards also will be there.

1424
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:02,840
And apparently the guy that played Lucas will not be there.

1425
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:06,960
I love the Power Glove.

1426
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,960
It's so bad.

1427
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:16,080
Yeah, well, just keep your Power Gloves off her, pal, huh?

1428
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,760
Why is it that America loves The Wizard?

1429
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,800
He grew up cute.

1430
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:21,800
Fred Savage?

1431
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:22,800
Yeah.

1432
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,040
Didn't you see he was in the doctor...

1433
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,320
He still has the same face.

1434
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:27,880
He was in the Austin Powers movie as the mole.

1435
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:34,640
He had a sitcom on NBC a while ago, too, so anyway.

1436
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:39,040
What is it about The Wizard that people still love to this day?

1437
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,600
It's just The Wizard.

1438
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:45,840
I think it has a very Rocky Horror-ish element to it with the video game crowd, because of

1439
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,840
course, those that know me know that I still love me some Rocky Horror Picture Show, and

1440
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:52,600
part of that is because the whole crowd gets into it and has fun with it.

1441
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:55,940
And I think that's kind of where The Wizard is headed, not that I'm saying people are

1442
01:17:55,940 --> 01:18:00,200
going to dress up and act out the thing, although they might, I mean, I don't know.

1443
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:05,000
But I could imagine that when this scene comes up in the movie, people are going to start

1444
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,600
cheering and they're going to yell back, and all the girls are going to scream at that,

1445
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:13,040
oh, he touched my breast part, and all that stuff.

1446
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:16,440
It just has that campiness to it that's very fun.

1447
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:20,200
But I'm glad to hear that Fred Savage is going and has a good sense of humor about it.

1448
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:24,040
I wish they were doing this in more places than just Austin.

1449
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:29,040
If they can do midnight showings of Showgirls, surely they could put The Wizard in San Francisco

1450
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,040
for one night and people would come out.

1451
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:32,040
Could you imagine having a shadow cast for The Wizard?

1452
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:35,480
I don't even want to think about it.

1453
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:38,640
There's other movies I'd rather see that done to.

1454
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:43,960
Tiger Claw says, people love The Wizard because it's filled with so much Nintendo propaganda.

1455
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:48,240
Rama in chat says, The Wizard ranks right up there with UHF, it's a cult classic.

1456
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:51,920
UHF is what I was proposed to over.

1457
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,280
Rama said also, it's a cult classic.

1458
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:58,440
It's when they revealed Super Mario Brothers 3, and I think a lot of us remember that from

1459
01:18:58,440 --> 01:18:59,440
our childhood.

1460
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:03,880
Like, a lot of us went to go see the movie just to freakin' see Mario 3.

1461
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:04,880
Me too.

1462
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:05,880
Wow.

1463
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:06,880
That's hardcore.

1464
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:09,840
I'm providing a shopping service for our listeners in the chat room.

1465
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:10,840
What shopping service?

1466
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:14,080
Yeah, people saying, I want a Saturn, and I was like, you want a Saturn?

1467
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,880
You can buy one off eBay.

1468
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,600
Use your hard-earned money to buy something off eBay right now.

1469
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,600
I have two Saturns.

1470
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,080
If you want something bad enough, you'll make it happen.

1471
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:27,520
I have a Saturn that I'm willing to get rid of because it has no controllers and no cords

1472
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:28,520
or anything.

1473
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:29,520
I'll take it.

1474
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,520
I've got a bajillion controllers and cords.

1475
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:31,520
Wow.

1476
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,720
That'll be three Saturns in my house.

1477
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:34,720
I need a Saturn.

1478
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:37,720
I've never, I've barely played any Saturn games in my life.

1479
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,200
That's what I need to play on a Saturn.

1480
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,200
I think I have that.

1481
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,200
The stall is awesome.

1482
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:44,520
Do you want to just borrow an extra set of controllers and cords for me?

1483
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:47,760
Well, I have, I have, my first Saturn has all the stuff for it.

1484
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:48,760
Oh.

1485
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:49,760
You don't have the second one.

1486
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:50,760
Yeah.

1487
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:54,160
Because I went to Denio's, you know, local flea market over here, and the first one I

1488
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:58,840
saw was the Saturn without anything because the guy was selling it for like 20 bucks.

1489
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,160
I'm like, okay, I'll take it.

1490
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,160
You went to Trader Dan's, right?

1491
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:04,960
I don't remember, but then I went somewhere else and I found a Saturn with everything.

1492
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,960
I'm like, okay, well, I'll just have a spare one, get parts or something.

1493
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:08,960
Yeah.

1494
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,520
Of course, you have to replace your battery every month.

1495
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:12,520
Wow.

1496
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:17,760
Well, now we're getting all nostalgic, and what better time than to bring out Dark Sakura's

1497
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,520
classic game of the week.

1498
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,520
Yes, that's right.

1499
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:24,320
Part A is coming to an end, and this is the part of the show where we like to let Dark

1500
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:29,040
Sakura reminisce a little bit about games you may have missed, and I honestly think

1501
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:32,160
damn near everyone missed this game Dark Sakura's going to do this week.

1502
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:36,720
I'm kind of excited to hear a little more about it, so I will stop the suspense, cue

1503
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:41,480
the music, and let Dark Sakura take it away.

1504
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:53,200
Today's classic game slash obscure slash whatever game I pick of the week is Magical Fantasy

1505
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,800
Adventure Popful Mail.

1506
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,080
Wow, that's a mouthful.

1507
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:58,080
Yeah.

1508
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:09,120
It was released originally on the PC-98 and PC-88 system in Japan, and it's sort of like

1509
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:14,080
Ys, you side scroll adventure, it has RPG elements, you can change out your weapons,

1510
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:20,320
you can change out your items, and talk to people, and all the stuff.

1511
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:27,080
It was released in Japan afterwards on Super Famicom, on PC Engine CD, and on the Mega

1512
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:32,120
CD, and over here we actually got the Sega CD version thanks to working delays, I mean

1513
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,400
working designs.

1514
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:41,240
Working designs are also the lovely people that brought Silhouette Mirage, the Grow Lancer

1515
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:48,720
series, Lunar, they were very, very good to us.

1516
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:54,320
So in this game you were playing a little busty elven girl called Popful, no, called

1517
01:21:54,320 --> 01:22:04,400
Mail, and you play as her friends, and you go around trying to, you know, save things,

1518
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:08,600
her friend the sorcerer Tat, and the little dragon guy named Gal, and you fight bad guys

1519
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:12,480
called Nutscracker and Muttonhead.

1520
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:13,480
There's a guy named Nutscracker?

1521
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:14,480
Nutscracker.

1522
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:17,640
I don't know if I like this guy.

1523
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,440
And it's a pretty cool game.

1524
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:24,000
Who's this that Mail's talking to right now in our little clip we're playing in the background?

1525
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:29,000
This is like the very start of the game, someone who's just cutting it out.

1526
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:33,960
Say, why don't you take me with you, I bet you have lots of adventures, why else would

1527
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:34,960
you have such a huge soul?

1528
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,440
I love the huge anime eyes and smile.

1529
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,440
Excuse me?

1530
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:41,040
I'm so hungry, I can eat an okra.

1531
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:44,520
I think you're confused, I'm a bounty hunter, not a baby cheer bub.

1532
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:50,240
Well the old CD games never had good music with them, or I mean good voice acting music

1533
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,240
was really good.

1534
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:55,080
Actually the voice acting wasn't really too bad, they at least tried.

1535
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:59,240
The problem I had with working designs is that they would put stuff into the game that

1536
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:04,520
just was not there and usually kind of crass humor, like with Rayearth.

1537
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:10,000
Now they actually made improvements when they brought out Rayearth on Saturn, but they took

1538
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:16,000
out the fact that they speak dialogue every time you touch an item, which cut down on

1539
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,360
the, it had intense loading time on the game.

1540
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:27,920
But they put in all these jokes like there was one about Harry Palms, but this was a

1541
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,920
fun game, it was a lot of fun.

1542
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:40,720
And it had the classic cut scenes and it's just very mid 90s game fun, that's all I can

1543
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:41,720
say it is.

1544
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:46,720
And I actually was surprised with my copy because I had played it back in the day when

1545
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:51,000
a friend of mine had imported it.

1546
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,500
And then it got its US release and I never, I didn't have a Sega CD at the time so I never

1547
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,000
actually got it.

1548
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:02,340
And one day Dan came home with this huge box for me to open at Christmas and inside this

1549
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:08,880
huge box, it was supposed to be like a space heater, was my game at the bottom of the box.

1550
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:09,880
How funny.

1551
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:12,320
I actually own an original Popple meal now.

1552
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,320
Awesome.

1553
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,960
Well that's a good game of the week because I bet a lot of people miss that one, but some

1554
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:18,720
folks in chat seem to recognize it and applaud that pick of the week.

1555
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:22,100
Popple meal is your classic game of the week.

1556
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:26,400
And with that part A comes to a close, but fear not, we'll be back in just a little bit

1557
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:31,440
with part B. So stay tuned and thanks for downloading Orange Lounge Radio.
