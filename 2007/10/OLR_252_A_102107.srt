00:00:13,945 --> 00:00:26,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, October 21st, 2007, Street Fighter is back for more in SF4, Sega brings its characters to a new tennis game, and a classic video game movie returns to at least one big screen.

2
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:36,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,488 --> 00:00:42,312
[SPEAKER_08]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:42,732 --> 00:00:43,753
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:48,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:48,656 --> 00:00:48,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

7
00:00:49,336 --> 00:00:50,017
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing, Jamie?

8
00:00:50,497 --> 00:00:50,757
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here.

9
00:00:51,258 --> 00:00:51,618
[SPEAKER_08]: You're here.

10
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:52,718
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm here too.

11
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:54,520
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're here to talk about games.

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Also joining us, the one and only Loki.

13
00:00:57,421 --> 00:00:57,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

14
00:00:57,562 --> 00:00:58,942
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing, Loki?

15
00:00:59,203 --> 00:00:59,903
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing fine.

16
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:00,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Guitar Hero 3 Demo Kit

17
00:01:22,113 --> 00:01:27,677
[SPEAKER_06]: for Guitar Hero 360, except it's kind of rare because it is a wired version instead of wireless.

18
00:01:27,897 --> 00:01:28,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

19
00:01:28,518 --> 00:01:33,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that I really give a damn if it's wireless or not, I mean, because that's one less battery I need, so.

20
00:01:33,722 --> 00:01:36,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, are we going to be unboxing that on Operator 11 a little later?

21
00:01:36,404 --> 00:01:36,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sure why not.

22
00:01:36,924 --> 00:01:37,605
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, sounds good.

23
00:01:38,174 --> 00:01:39,375
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Luke, Carameldansen

24
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:10,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Ragnarok What exactly does that mean in English?

25
00:02:33,906 --> 00:02:35,907
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

26
00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:05,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire Mage, who I'm building up to Sage.

27
00:03:06,493 --> 00:03:07,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I have two Assassins.

28
00:03:08,195 --> 00:03:11,317
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them hit level 91 this week.

29
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:13,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a bunch of other people.

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I have a Dancer who looks like a Hoochie.

31
00:03:17,162 --> 00:03:17,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Fun.

32
00:03:17,783 --> 00:03:18,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

33
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,080
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura and Korean MMOs

34
00:03:48,618 --> 00:03:59,881
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say, God, let me start off with, I played Conan on Xbox 360, and it's interesting.

35
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:05,302
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually very much of a ripoff of God of War, but that's not a bad thing.

36
00:04:05,342 --> 00:04:06,622
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still a pretty good game.

37
00:04:07,603 --> 00:04:13,244
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see, I also tried, of course, Beautiful Katamari, and I actually finished that game because it's very short.

38
00:04:14,451 --> 00:04:18,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I tried the, what else did I play here?

39
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:22,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.

40
00:04:23,058 --> 00:04:24,519
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried the demo for that.

41
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,623
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's a good looking game.

42
00:04:29,624 --> 00:04:30,484
[SPEAKER_06]: The cars look good.

43
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:35,068
[SPEAKER_06]: The track that they picked though to showcase it, I wouldn't have picked that one.

44
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:35,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Paper Dolls

45
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:05,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Project Gotham does the same thing, but you know what?

46
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:07,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Project Gotham looks way better.

47
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:20,130
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't really a huge deal right now because Project Gotham is only on 360, but a year from now when Project Gotham Racing 5 is probably going to be coming out and Gran Turismo 5 is coming out at the same time,

48
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Project Gotham is a Microsoft IP Unlike Mass Effect

49
00:05:42,304 --> 00:05:43,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Project Gotham Racing

50
00:06:03,732 --> 00:06:06,674
[SPEAKER_06]: So, probably the PlayStation 3, it's going to be the same deal.

51
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:17,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying, you know, for them putting all this hype behind it and trying to even sell this kind of demo of a game before it comes out, you know, officially, I don't know.

52
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:19,102
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that great.

53
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:27,308
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're really dying to play some Gran Turismo, I highly recommend checking out the demo first and then judging it based off that, see if you want to buy it or not.

54
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:28,989
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks good, but I just...

55
00:06:29,853 --> 00:06:37,241
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, after seeing the video, the video of it looked really, really nice, but when you're playing the game, it's not as nice, so I don't know.

56
00:06:39,202 --> 00:06:42,706
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to think if there's anything else I played that was really awesome.

57
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:48,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's pretty much it, other than, you know, Saints Row, because I've always been playing Saints Row now.

58
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,741
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

59
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:18,769
[SPEAKER_08]: There was just going to be huge crowds for all that stuff, and the media invites I was getting, not a lot of real wowing kind of stuff.

60
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:25,851
[SPEAKER_08]: So I said, you know what, I'm going to just take a real vacation from both of my jobs, Orange Lounge Radio, my day job, and I'm going to go to Disneyland.

61
00:07:26,171 --> 00:07:32,092
[SPEAKER_08]: So I spent the week playing Buzz Lightyear once again, and I got the number 17 high score for the day one time I played.

62
00:07:32,112 --> 00:07:32,852
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a picture to prove it.

63
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:36,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, no, but seriously, other video games I've been playing,

64
00:07:37,446 --> 00:07:44,012
[SPEAKER_08]: I did play Typing of the Dead before I left because I remember we had this story on the show a couple weeks ago where we were talking about how they added Typing of the Dead to GameTap.

65
00:07:44,032 --> 00:07:45,053
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, I've got to go play that.

66
00:07:45,574 --> 00:07:48,857
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's still as wonderful as I remember it.

67
00:07:48,897 --> 00:07:51,580
[SPEAKER_08]: It runs great on the computer, so I was very happy about that.

68
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:58,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though it is the PC version that GameTap is emulating, not the Dreamcast version, but they still do have the Dreamcast strapped to their backs.

69
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:01,069
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the part we all know and love.

70
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:11,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, a large majority of my gaming week otherwise was spent playing E4, the other E4, not the Expo, but Every Extend Extra Extreme, which came out on Xbox Live this week.

71
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,071
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

72
00:08:35,172 --> 00:08:38,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Your shields are only on for about two seconds once you regenerate.

73
00:08:39,254 --> 00:08:42,015
[SPEAKER_08]: After those two seconds are up, anything on the screen can kill you.

74
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,156
[SPEAKER_08]: So you want to commit suicide before something on the screen kills you.

75
00:08:45,456 --> 00:08:48,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if something on the screen kills you, you basically have to go back to start.

76
00:08:48,758 --> 00:08:53,560
[SPEAKER_08]: The game time is limited to three minutes, but you can collect power-ups throughout the game.

77
00:08:53,880 --> 00:09:03,484
[SPEAKER_08]: You can collect a power-up to extend your game time, a power-up to extend your shield time, a power-up to make things float on the screen faster and increase the beats of the song.

78
00:09:03,504 --> 00:09:04,484
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what they call the quicken.

79
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:17,709
[SPEAKER_08]: or you can pick a power up that increases your bonus multiplier and basically that's essentially the core component of the game so you know you get higher and higher bonuses if you actually detonate your ship in time to the music now it's a game by

80
00:09:18,502 --> 00:09:21,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Tetsuya Mizuguchi, who did Luminous and a bunch of other stuff I love.

81
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:27,448
[SPEAKER_08]: And I played every cent extra on the PSP, so I knew I was going to like this game, and I do.

82
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:28,388
[SPEAKER_08]: The game has a lot of depth.

83
00:09:28,408 --> 00:09:31,210
[SPEAKER_08]: It has the regular game mode, and then it has a shooter mode.

84
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:35,213
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called the Revenge mode, where you can go around and actually just... It's just a shooter.

85
00:09:35,713 --> 00:09:37,774
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't even bother with the music or the exploding.

86
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:38,975
[SPEAKER_08]: It just shoots things.

87
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,376
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was kind of interesting.

88
00:09:40,736 --> 00:09:41,757
[SPEAKER_08]: But then there's another mode.

89
00:09:42,521 --> 00:10:06,328
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty intricate the way they set it up, but you can actually, using the whole media center and doing the MP3s on your Xbox 360 through the network, you can actually configure Every Extent Extra Extreme to read those songs, and you can work with the game to either auto-detect the BPM or set the BPM by button tapping or whatever, so you can use your own songs in the game, which is kind of cool.

90
00:10:06,348 --> 00:10:08,649
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of fun to be able to play the game with your own songs.

91
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:09,730
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

92
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:33,191
[SPEAKER_08]: The game did not increment in stages, and I realized maybe that's a different game.

93
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:44,654
[SPEAKER_08]: This wasn't necessarily supposed to be a direct port of the PSP version, but I kind of liked that better when there was that more sense of accomplishment as opposed to the fact of, I've survived for 70 minutes now and my thumbs are getting numb, so I'm just going to suicide, which is what I ended up doing.

94
00:10:46,894 --> 00:10:53,856
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing that actually kind of makes me wonder why they chose to do this in the game is that the graphics aren't that good.

95
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,263
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was kind of surprised.

96
00:10:56,403 --> 00:11:06,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, compared to the PSP version, which has these very bright visuals and different types of backgrounds and different skins, eh, I kind of felt that this game just had white on black.

97
00:11:06,847 --> 00:11:12,229
[SPEAKER_08]: And the types of objects that would float around the screen would change depending on what stage you were playing.

98
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,091
[SPEAKER_08]: And the little ships that, you know, get into it as well.

99
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:17,591
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really about it.

100
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:19,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, the backgrounds don't change too much.

101
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, when you set off big combos...

102
00:11:21,553 --> 00:11:22,434
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

103
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,071
[SPEAKER_08]: After 70 minutes of playing one round of this game.

104
00:11:51,551 --> 00:11:53,312
[SPEAKER_08]: So it kind of didn't add up to a lot.

105
00:11:53,332 --> 00:11:54,613
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was a bit of a disappointment.

106
00:11:55,113 --> 00:11:58,515
[SPEAKER_08]: But overall, I think it is a good value for money, especially if you're not a PSP owner.

107
00:11:58,896 --> 00:11:59,856
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it is a fun game.

108
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:03,279
[SPEAKER_08]: I did play a little bit of Luminous because they have the new content.

109
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:08,222
[SPEAKER_08]: I neglected to download the holiday pack, but I did download the new Genkai Rocket song, Breeze.

110
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:10,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Mediocre at best.

111
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:25,907
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not enjoy Breeze, which is sad because I love, love, love, love, love Heavenly Star and I love the video, but Breeze is basically the same concept for the video, the cartoon Asian girl bouncing around, which makes sense because Genkai Rockets is supposed to be like a... Genki.

112
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:26,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Genki, sorry.

113
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,588
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be like a cartoony band or whatever it is.

114
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:30,708
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't know.

115
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:32,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Cartoon heroes did it.

116
00:12:33,988 --> 00:12:36,949
[SPEAKER_08]: So did Gorillaz, but you know, it's just, at least, Gorillaz did it best.

117
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,029
[SPEAKER_08]: There's different, well, you're a fangirl.

118
00:12:39,289 --> 00:12:42,610
[SPEAKER_08]: There's different, there's variants in the Gorillaz videos.

119
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,251
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

120
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, their videos are all different.

121
00:12:45,511 --> 00:12:47,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Say what you will, like, dislike, all the videos are different.

122
00:12:47,572 --> 00:12:51,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, actually, actually, the videos only got different when you got to Demon Days.

123
00:12:52,393 --> 00:12:54,214
[SPEAKER_04]: The first album ones were not different.

124
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they need to vary it up a little bit.

125
00:12:56,674 --> 00:13:03,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, they couldn't keep that level of, you know, I mean, Heavenly Star and, you know, Shinen were both really good, and, you know,

126
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:06,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Eventually, they're going to have to have a mediocre song.

127
00:13:07,499 --> 00:13:09,140
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, going to chat room for some comments.

128
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

129
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Picaruno says, the new seasonal Luminous Life Pack is awesome and you should buy it right now.

130
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:18,563
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard good things about it, so I'm contemplating buying it.

131
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:18,843
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

132
00:13:18,884 --> 00:13:22,465
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as I don't have any speed mixes of fucking Christmas songs.

133
00:13:22,965 --> 00:13:23,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yes, please no.

134
00:13:23,665 --> 00:13:24,786
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at you, Dance Mania.

135
00:13:24,806 --> 00:13:26,086
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at you.

136
00:13:26,686 --> 00:13:30,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Gerardimo says, they're trying to set you up with microtransactions like in Luminous.

137
00:13:31,108 --> 00:13:31,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

138
00:13:31,848 --> 00:13:33,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that's where my backgrounds are.

139
00:13:34,087 --> 00:13:35,968
[SPEAKER_08]: There are going to be microtransactions later on.

140
00:13:35,988 --> 00:13:36,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I refuse.

141
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:39,230
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm putting my foot down this time on the microtransactions, damn it.

142
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,791
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're paying less than a penny?

143
00:13:44,473 --> 00:13:52,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, look, I know we've had this discussion about micro and macrotransactions, but that's, you know, despite, it's still what people call it.

144
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:56,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Gerardimo's also still having fun with the E4 demo.

145
00:13:58,401 --> 00:13:59,882
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkTetsuya says, Loki, what?

146
00:13:59,962 --> 00:14:01,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Speed Mix of Jingle Bells doesn't do it for you?

147
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:02,624
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it doesn't.

148
00:14:03,044 --> 00:14:03,364
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't.

149
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:09,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, oh, GS68 would also like to point out, speeding up a song does not equal a remix.

150
00:14:10,572 --> 00:14:11,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Good point.

151
00:14:12,313 --> 00:14:14,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well that's going to do it for our gaming weeks.

152
00:14:14,774 --> 00:14:17,655
[SPEAKER_04]: But adding heavy synth to it does make it Eurobeat.

153
00:14:18,335 --> 00:14:18,696
[SPEAKER_08]: It might.

154
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:22,017
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, having some guy singing about fire.

155
00:14:22,177 --> 00:14:25,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever a fire, just insert blank of fire and it's instant Eurobeat.

156
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we'll get into remix stuff later on.

157
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,221
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some complaints with certain artists out there.

158
00:14:31,381 --> 00:14:32,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my, alright.

159
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:38,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I mention that Luminous does have, or I'm sorry, not Luminous, Every Stand Extra Extreme does have a remix of Heavenly Star in it.

160
00:14:40,207 --> 00:14:40,828
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that great.

161
00:14:41,168 --> 00:14:41,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry to say.

162
00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:42,949
[SPEAKER_06]: You probably have already heard it too.

163
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:43,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

164
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:44,571
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

165
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:48,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go into tonight's news.

166
00:14:48,194 --> 00:14:49,595
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have a lot of housekeeping tonight.

167
00:14:50,353 --> 00:14:53,114
[SPEAKER_08]: I will therefore use the opportunity to plug our communities.

168
00:14:53,614 --> 00:14:55,695
[SPEAKER_08]: MySpace.com slash OrangeLaunchRadio.

169
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:57,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Add us as your friend on MySpace.

170
00:14:57,595 --> 00:14:59,216
[SPEAKER_08]: We post bulletins with extra stuff.

171
00:14:59,436 --> 00:15:07,338
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually did a whole bonus show last week because of our outage after the show, and so we posted it to our MySpace people and the LiveJournal people at Orange Lounge.

172
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:17,647
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have a community on Facebook, but I've been irritated with Facebook lately because I'm getting sick of getting the invites for So-and-so wants you to be on their team for quiz show.

173
00:15:18,007 --> 00:15:21,050
[SPEAKER_08]: So-and-so wants you to join them in the battle of ninjas versus pirates.

174
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:25,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, this so-and-so doesn't give two shits and is thinking about deleting his account.

175
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:29,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you hear that the Mass Effect characters are now on Facebook looking for friends?

176
00:15:29,776 --> 00:15:32,238
[SPEAKER_08]: I could give a shit, honestly.

177
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:34,320
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope they find no friends on Facebook.

178
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,435
[SPEAKER_08]: I am not happy with Facebook.

179
00:15:36,455 --> 00:15:46,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook was cool like six months ago before they started adding all the... Like, you would think usually user-created mods are a good thing for almost everything you can think of.

180
00:15:47,362 --> 00:15:48,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Not Facebook.

181
00:15:49,755 --> 00:15:56,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook is somehow proven that user-enabled created mods can single-handedly make your site suck balls.

182
00:15:56,398 --> 00:15:59,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like user-created themes for Myspace.

183
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Now everybody's yelling at me to just block the applications.

184
00:16:02,981 --> 00:16:04,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I block everything?

185
00:16:04,682 --> 00:16:07,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just put, is there like a box, block everything?

186
00:16:07,563 --> 00:16:08,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I'll do that.

187
00:16:08,424 --> 00:16:09,564
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't even know that was a feature.

188
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:10,825
[SPEAKER_08]: See, this is why I love chat.

189
00:16:11,245 --> 00:16:12,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat educates me.

190
00:16:12,526 --> 00:16:15,867
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, I will check Facebook right now while we get into some gaming news.

191
00:16:16,348 --> 00:16:16,988
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's start off.

192
00:16:17,637 --> 00:16:23,761
[SPEAKER_06]: So during this week, there was a wonderful event in London, Capcom's Gamers Day.

193
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:29,565
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, their bombshell announcement for that event would be Street Fighter 4.

194
00:16:29,765 --> 00:16:31,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, it's coming.

195
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:34,849
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm not too surprised that there's a Street Fighter 4.

196
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:37,911
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like saying there's not going to be a Halo 4 or something like that.

197
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:38,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

198
00:16:38,992 --> 00:16:40,873
[SPEAKER_06]: But, okay, it is Street Fighter 4.

199
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,695
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to continue with the 2D series.

200
00:16:43,995 --> 00:16:46,317
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to be 3D, so far at least.

201
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:47,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank God.

202
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:48,674
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good thing.

203
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:02,291
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, I'm sorry, the teaser video was lame.

204
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:07,755
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it was nothing more than like a hype the crowd type thing where I'm sitting there watching it on the computer.

205
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:09,456
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking, show me the game.

206
00:17:09,977 --> 00:17:14,220
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate these stupid cinematic, like teasers that are nothing but cinematics, the CGI rendering.

207
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,963
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in a day and an age of gaming where we know that's just all the BS cut scenes.

208
00:17:18,283 --> 00:17:20,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I want to see some actual game.

209
00:17:20,145 --> 00:17:25,589
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be awesome though if it was in that art style because it was kind of like a watercolor type thing, but no.

210
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:26,990
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

211
00:17:27,403 --> 00:17:29,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Street Fighter 4, it's going to be a fighting game.

212
00:17:29,488 --> 00:17:33,518
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll probably be awesome and out sometime, someday.

213
00:17:34,681 --> 00:17:35,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

214
00:17:36,235 --> 00:17:39,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Now let's see, GS68 says nobody will play Street Fighter 4.

215
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:42,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Arcade scene has been reduced down to initial D4.

216
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,000
[SPEAKER_08]: And when?

217
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, Midnight Maximum 2 and 3.

218
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:46,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, people will play Street Fighter 4.

219
00:17:46,342 --> 00:17:49,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, because they're not going to gun for the arcades necessarily.

220
00:17:49,224 --> 00:17:52,226
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to use Xbox Live and PlayStation Network to get people to play.

221
00:17:52,246 --> 00:17:53,367
[SPEAKER_06]: People will still play the damn arcades.

222
00:17:53,387 --> 00:17:53,908
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

223
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,369
[SPEAKER_06]: People still play tech in there.

224
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:56,670
[SPEAKER_06]: People still go to the arcades.

225
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,211
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why there's still arcades out there.

226
00:17:58,231 --> 00:18:01,433
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not as many arcades because arcade games have gotten more expensive.

227
00:18:01,753 --> 00:18:04,675
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you don't have the foot traffic, you're not going to be able to pay for your $6,000 game.

228
00:18:06,096 --> 00:18:09,358
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's why arcades are failing.

229
00:18:09,758 --> 00:18:15,441
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not because, you know, people stopped going to them, it's just that games got more expensive.

230
00:18:16,342 --> 00:18:22,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Out of curiosity, why would I bother to go to an arcade if I can just plug it in on my Xbox 360 and sign into live and play?

231
00:18:22,545 --> 00:18:25,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the D-pad sucks on Xbox 360.

232
00:18:25,786 --> 00:18:26,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Ouch, good point.

233
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:28,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Touche.

234
00:18:28,268 --> 00:18:30,149
[SPEAKER_04]: What can ever replace the arcade experience?

235
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:31,556
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

236
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:36,938
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know this is interesting coming from me on this program when you consider the three of us all met, how?

237
00:18:37,078 --> 00:18:37,938
[SPEAKER_08]: At an arcade, right?

238
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:45,841
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, arcades, as they're saying in chat, they really have become nothing but gambling for children and the ticket spitters.

239
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:46,701
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sad.

240
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:54,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Like every good arcade I've ever known is gone or replaced with something that is under the disguise of a good arcade, but it's not.

241
00:18:55,824 --> 00:18:56,165
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

242
00:18:57,045 --> 00:18:57,465
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sad.

243
00:18:58,393 --> 00:18:59,013
[SPEAKER_08]: So are you excited?

244
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:02,456
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you're a Capcom Fighting Girl fan, DarkSakura.

245
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:03,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you excited about Street Fighter 4?

246
00:19:04,157 --> 00:19:04,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah!

247
00:19:04,938 --> 00:19:06,859
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you hope they do differently this time?

248
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Take out Chun-Li.

249
00:19:09,141 --> 00:19:10,382
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they can't do that!

250
00:19:10,642 --> 00:19:11,403
[SPEAKER_04]: And put in Sakura.

251
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:14,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would... They would never take out Chun-Li.

252
00:19:14,145 --> 00:19:14,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would they do that?

253
00:19:15,186 --> 00:19:17,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm sick of all of the fanboyism.

254
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:18,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

255
00:19:18,808 --> 00:19:24,933
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like... Okay, her moves are all... She's like... I'm trying to...

256
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:26,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Oro He needs to leave

257
00:19:53,164 --> 00:19:55,585
[SPEAKER_06]: He needs to come back but missing another arm.

258
00:19:55,985 --> 00:19:56,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Or a leg or something.

259
00:19:57,065 --> 00:19:58,365
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be awesome.

260
00:19:58,385 --> 00:19:59,285
[SPEAKER_06]: The joke will continue.

261
00:19:59,305 --> 00:20:00,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Because then he'd be Elena.

262
00:20:01,906 --> 00:20:02,546
[SPEAKER_04]: And fight with his legs.

263
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:03,907
[SPEAKER_04]: She was cool too.

264
00:20:04,007 --> 00:20:04,787
[SPEAKER_04]: She needs to come back.

265
00:20:05,947 --> 00:20:13,069
[SPEAKER_04]: And they need to actually have... Do they have any characters in the game who use Taekwondo?

266
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:16,349
[SPEAKER_08]: FootyMonster says, DarkSakura, fuck you.

267
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Leave my beautiful thunder thighs alone.

268
00:20:20,424 --> 00:20:22,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I have kick power, thank you.

269
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:29,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that they should take Street Fighter 4 and actually add other Capcom characters into it instead of just this Capcom versus shit.

270
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:32,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you'd have Puzzle Fighter.

271
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:36,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Puzzle Fighter, but Pocket Fighter.

272
00:20:37,578 --> 00:20:40,900
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm all fine with them putting in new characters.

273
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not have some new characters to sell?

274
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:45,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Soul Calibur 3 kind of did it.

275
00:20:45,642 --> 00:20:48,824
[SPEAKER_08]: They had the guy with the big old sickle and stuff.

276
00:20:49,464 --> 00:20:50,785
[SPEAKER_08]: They're able to sell out new characters.

277
00:20:51,045 --> 00:20:53,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, don't follow the route of Tekken 6.

278
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:57,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Bob, the fat guy that sort of looks like Mario.

279
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:00,390
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's not a cool character.

280
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,951
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I would like to see?

281
00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:04,112
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see a tag mode.

282
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the versus games.

283
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:09,641
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be cool.

284
00:21:09,661 --> 00:21:16,464
[SPEAKER_04]: I also really wouldn't mind just another Capcom versus game that isn't like, what was it, Fighting Evolution.

285
00:21:16,604 --> 00:21:25,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I want them to go back to the Marvel versus Capcom style that they did because that was probably one of their most solid fighting games.

286
00:21:25,247 --> 00:21:27,588
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wanted to have like a, you know what they need to do?

287
00:21:28,628 --> 00:21:30,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of doing Street Fighter 4, we need another freaking Cyberbots.

288
00:21:32,715 --> 00:21:35,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Blaze in our chatroom is getting in on the Capcom crossover madness.

289
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,896
[SPEAKER_08]: He says, Phoenix Wright and Miles Edgeworth in Street Fighter 4.

290
00:21:40,117 --> 00:21:40,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Objection.

291
00:21:40,637 --> 00:21:46,978
[SPEAKER_06]: They should just do a new game series called Capcom Versus and then do a new installment each year.

292
00:21:47,198 --> 00:21:50,679
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think they should focus on Street Fighter 4 and making it good.

293
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,740
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think they should do any of this crossover bullshit.

294
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,880
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they should focus on making a new, original, fun game.

295
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,461
[SPEAKER_04]: To talk to Son of Dad for a moment...

296
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:06,204
[SPEAKER_04]: They, first of all, the Final Fight characters were in the Alpha series and that is, it's a different type of game.

297
00:22:06,244 --> 00:22:08,105
[SPEAKER_04]: It plays different than how 3 was.

298
00:22:08,145 --> 00:22:11,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I kind of liked how 3 was with the parrying system.

299
00:22:11,406 --> 00:22:12,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was cool and that needs to stay.

300
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:19,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially because I have one time parried a Shoryuken, so that was really cool.

301
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,651
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my awesome moment.

302
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:26,914
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that they need to have a few more unique styles.

303
00:22:27,214 --> 00:22:27,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was really good.

304
00:22:27,934 --> 00:22:29,115
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a boxer in there.

305
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:29,615
[SPEAKER_04]: They had

306
00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:33,878
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the stupid one-armed guy that kind of grossed me out.

307
00:22:33,918 --> 00:22:35,418
[SPEAKER_04]: They need a luchador.

308
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:36,719
[SPEAKER_04]: They need a luchador.

309
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:37,999
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they had one.

310
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,440
[SPEAKER_04]: They had Vega.

311
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,421
[SPEAKER_06]: He wasn't really a luchador, though.

312
00:22:41,501 --> 00:22:42,001
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not luchador.

313
00:22:42,021 --> 00:22:44,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking Matador.

314
00:22:44,222 --> 00:22:45,643
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they do need a luchador.

315
00:22:45,663 --> 00:22:47,103
[SPEAKER_04]: They need Mexican wrestling.

316
00:22:48,424 --> 00:22:48,944
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be cool.

317
00:22:50,405 --> 00:22:50,765
[SPEAKER_04]: They need...

318
00:22:51,445 --> 00:22:57,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there was Armika in... In fact, Scrooge is a luchador.

319
00:22:57,946 --> 00:22:59,026
[SPEAKER_06]: They just need Santo in there.

320
00:23:00,387 --> 00:23:10,388
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they need to... Oh, God, they need a... Well, not like a wrestler-wrestler, but they need like a big brawler.

321
00:23:10,608 --> 00:23:14,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Not like Zangief was, but just like this brute character.

322
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:15,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Like T-Hawk?

323
00:23:16,489 --> 00:23:17,390
[SPEAKER_04]: No, T-Hawk was a wrestler.

324
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:17,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

325
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,250
[SPEAKER_04]: They need this...

326
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:25,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like the slow, like, oh god, who was it in Darkstalkers?

327
00:23:25,785 --> 00:23:28,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Suddenly this game's turning into Saturday Night Slammasters.

328
00:23:29,342 --> 00:23:35,006
[SPEAKER_04]: They need something like that, where they're slow and tough, but that's just the thing.

329
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,388
[SPEAKER_04]: They're slow and tough, and that's what's frustrating about them.

330
00:23:37,408 --> 00:23:38,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Do another Darkstalkers game.

331
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:39,490
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be kind of cool.

332
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,311
[SPEAKER_04]: We need a good Darkstalkers game.

333
00:23:41,351 --> 00:23:44,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I love these comments from chat rooms on the crossover games.

334
00:23:44,894 --> 00:23:46,556
[SPEAKER_08]: GS68 says, Fuck crossovers.

335
00:23:46,616 --> 00:23:47,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop feeding the fanboys.

336
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:51,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Sephiroth1215 says, Street Fighter is only for Street Fighter characters.

337
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,941
[SPEAKER_08]: You want other Capcom characters?

338
00:23:53,001 --> 00:23:54,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Play the Wacky Versus series.

339
00:23:55,714 --> 00:23:59,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I was hoping they'd come out with another Sega Versus series.

340
00:24:00,695 --> 00:24:03,417
[SPEAKER_08]: All I have to say is thank God they're sticking with 2D.

341
00:24:03,717 --> 00:24:08,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I seem to remember there was a 3D Street Fighter game, like Rosal Golfland had it, didn't they?

342
00:24:08,461 --> 00:24:11,444
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was, oh God, it was so horrible.

343
00:24:11,804 --> 00:24:16,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Son of Dad is saying exactly what I was thinking, that they need more unique styles in the game.

344
00:24:16,728 --> 00:24:29,658
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, just to talk to Hitson, I actually like Darkstalkers 3, and I've actually played it where all the character sprites on the screen were missing because my employer at the time when I worked for an arcade was fixing it while I was playing it.

345
00:24:30,766 --> 00:24:31,867
[SPEAKER_04]: and be the game that way.

346
00:24:32,648 --> 00:24:36,292
[SPEAKER_04]: But... Fighters Megamix 2.

347
00:24:36,453 --> 00:24:37,133
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good idea.

348
00:24:37,774 --> 00:24:38,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, thank you.

349
00:24:38,415 --> 00:24:39,716
[SPEAKER_08]: The chat reminded me.

350
00:24:39,756 --> 00:24:41,098
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking of the EX series.

351
00:24:41,138 --> 00:24:42,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were the 3D ones.

352
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:45,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and Dark Knight reminds me that Capcom didn't do the 3D ones.

353
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:45,643
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

354
00:24:45,823 --> 00:24:47,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they should sue whoever did it.

355
00:24:48,526 --> 00:24:48,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Again.

356
00:24:49,628 --> 00:24:55,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because people actually remember how horrible those games are, so they should sue them again if they haven't already.

357
00:24:55,292 --> 00:25:00,616
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what game that I would like for them to make, and this is what I would totally call it too, is Capcom Fighting Universe.

358
00:25:02,057 --> 00:25:03,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a big clusterfuck of every character ever?

359
00:25:04,118 --> 00:25:05,539
[SPEAKER_04]: You have your Rival Schools characters.

360
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:06,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh lordy.

361
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:10,603
[SPEAKER_04]: You have your Alpha characters, you have your She-Fighter 3, you have your Cyberbots.

362
00:25:10,623 --> 00:25:12,784
[SPEAKER_06]: They did something like that though.

363
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Fan girl alert, fan girl alert.

364
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:17,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was like Capcom Fighting Evolution or something like that.

365
00:25:17,528 --> 00:25:18,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but that game sucked.

366
00:25:18,328 --> 00:25:18,989
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't the best of.

367
00:25:19,594 --> 00:25:20,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Capcom Fighting Evolution sucked.

368
00:25:22,137 --> 00:25:28,063
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to just do... Get the wolf from Akami, get the guy from Dead Rising.

369
00:25:28,243 --> 00:25:31,607
[SPEAKER_04]: You choose your mode at the beginning of the game and everyone fights in the same mode.

370
00:25:32,321 --> 00:25:34,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, too much fanboy stuff for me.

371
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:36,362
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to move on with the other Capcom news.

372
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:40,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of the wolf from Okami, Okami for the Wii has been confirmed.

373
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:43,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Okami is coming to the Nintendo Wii in the spring of 2008.

374
00:25:45,084 --> 00:25:49,204
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've played Okami, it's the kind of game that really could benefit from some motion controls.

375
00:25:49,705 --> 00:25:52,825
[SPEAKER_08]: And certainly the game will be making use of the Wiimote controls.

376
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:56,746
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion controls will be used primarily for the Celestial Brush game.

377
00:25:57,435 --> 00:26:03,379
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually excited about this because Okami's kind of one of those games everybody said I should play and I didn't really get to play enough of.

378
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:08,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, there was just so many games coming out around that time, so this kind of allows a lot of people like me to take a second look.

379
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like when Resident Evil 4 came out for the Wii.

380
00:26:11,365 --> 00:26:11,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Same thing.

381
00:26:11,906 --> 00:26:13,427
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a good choice for them to bring it there.

382
00:26:14,187 --> 00:26:17,290
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's an excellent choice, so I'm definitely looking forward to checking that out.

383
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Okami on the Wii.

384
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:21,873
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and this is kind of off the subject a little bit, but...

385
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:32,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised they haven't brought Beautiful Joe to the Wii, but then that made me think, how much do you want to bet that there might be a character announced that's Beautiful Joe for Super Smash Bros.?

386
00:26:34,448 --> 00:26:34,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

387
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:35,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

388
00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:38,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they did have that game that was sort of like Smash Bros.

389
00:26:38,171 --> 00:26:43,575
[SPEAKER_08]: with Beautiful Joe, but... I think Beautiful Joe's on ice for a little bit, and that's just fine, because, like... It sucked.

390
00:26:43,795 --> 00:26:48,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it started good, but then it was one of those, like, saturation...

391
00:26:49,406 --> 00:26:51,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but it got too oversaturated.

392
00:26:51,427 --> 00:26:56,388
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think Capcom's doing the smart thing right now, and Beautiful Joe, at least it seems to me anyway, is on ice for a little while.

393
00:26:56,788 --> 00:26:57,688
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's just fine by me.

394
00:26:58,328 --> 00:26:59,229
[SPEAKER_08]: The series needs to be on ice.

395
00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:02,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there is a little bit more good Capcom news.

396
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:10,992
[SPEAKER_04]: They have released word about a game called Dark Void that will be out next winter, developed by Airtight Games.

397
00:27:11,392 --> 00:27:13,853
[SPEAKER_04]: They gave us Crimson Skies, High Road to Revenge.

398
00:27:14,573 --> 00:27:17,134
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is supposed to be...

399
00:27:18,456 --> 00:27:19,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Midair and On Foot.

400
00:27:21,158 --> 00:27:25,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And they haven't said what it's going to be on, although they're thinking PS3 and Xbox 360.

401
00:27:26,682 --> 00:27:31,646
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a game where you go against these... They're called the Watchers.

402
00:27:32,547 --> 00:27:33,407
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've been watching.

403
00:27:33,728 --> 00:27:36,750
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they stopped watching and are doing... What have they been watching me do?

404
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:37,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Porn.

405
00:27:38,471 --> 00:27:38,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, noes.

406
00:27:39,592 --> 00:27:41,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Ceiling Watchers are watching you fap.

407
00:27:43,035 --> 00:27:43,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, noes.

408
00:27:45,888 --> 00:27:47,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hooray for original ideas, right?

409
00:27:47,469 --> 00:27:49,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Because this is a whole new IP for them, right?

410
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a new world.

411
00:27:51,991 --> 00:27:52,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, good.

412
00:27:53,391 --> 00:28:00,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, folks that may have owned a PS3 and not a 360 have missed out on the Lost Planet series.

413
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:00,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, fear not.

414
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:02,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Capcom... Unless you owned a computer.

415
00:28:04,076 --> 00:28:05,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you owned a PC.

416
00:28:05,457 --> 00:28:07,518
[SPEAKER_06]: But who owns a PC nowadays?

417
00:28:07,578 --> 00:28:08,378
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously.

418
00:28:08,898 --> 00:28:09,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody.

419
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody owns a computer.

420
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Who plays games on PCs anymore?

421
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,221
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just ridiculous talk.

422
00:28:16,084 --> 00:28:16,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways.

423
00:28:17,044 --> 00:28:19,425
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but seriously, Lost Planet's coming to the PS3.

424
00:28:19,445 --> 00:28:26,647
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have all the features and download content that was available for the PC and Xbox 360 versions.

425
00:28:27,027 --> 00:28:29,388
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to come out in the spring, so... Hooray!

426
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:31,609
[SPEAKER_06]: You get your Lost Planet almost a year later.

427
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they doing anything extra for it?

428
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,031
[SPEAKER_08]: Extra levels?

429
00:28:37,131 --> 00:28:37,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Extra characters?

430
00:28:37,931 --> 00:28:39,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Extra... Just the download content.

431
00:28:39,531 --> 00:28:40,192
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much it.

432
00:28:40,212 --> 00:28:41,632
[SPEAKER_06]: The stuff that was available later on.

433
00:28:41,912 --> 00:28:42,292
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean... So...

434
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,940
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not really that extra, I guess.

435
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,141
[SPEAKER_06]: It was all the bonus stuff that was available already.

436
00:28:50,481 --> 00:28:51,441
[SPEAKER_08]: No dress-up mode?

437
00:28:52,362 --> 00:28:52,502
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

438
00:28:53,282 --> 00:28:53,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing.

439
00:28:53,962 --> 00:28:54,402
[SPEAKER_08]: That's too bad.

440
00:28:54,462 --> 00:28:59,704
[SPEAKER_06]: It says apparently now that it can fit all that stuff on the Blu-ray disc, so that's why it wasn't downloaded content now.

441
00:29:00,184 --> 00:29:01,824
[SPEAKER_08]: I like SonOfDad's comment in chat.

442
00:29:01,864 --> 00:29:06,386
[SPEAKER_08]: SonOfDad says in chat, chat.orangeonjuray.com, Lost Planet PlayStation 3?

443
00:29:07,206 --> 00:29:07,606
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

444
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:09,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Dead Rising PlayStation 3?

445
00:29:09,487 --> 00:29:09,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

446
00:29:12,008 --> 00:29:12,968
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be sweet.

447
00:29:13,388 --> 00:29:24,310
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, if they're looking for a game that would take advantage of their little Shaker controller like an idiot function, then Dead Rising would be a good one to look at.

448
00:29:24,651 --> 00:29:26,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing, and this is kind of good news for you guys.

449
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:34,412
[SPEAKER_06]: If you think about it, I would think that they would pick Dead Rising over Lost Planet anyways because I think Dead Rising sold more anyways.

450
00:29:36,093 --> 00:29:36,773
[SPEAKER_06]: So that means...

451
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:44,525
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, that means that they're making a sequel, so instead of porting the original, they're just going to make a sequel for both platforms.

452
00:29:44,545 --> 00:29:46,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, duh, they've got to be making a sequel.

453
00:29:46,466 --> 00:29:48,666
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, how could they not be making a sequel to Dead Rising?

454
00:29:48,986 --> 00:29:53,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, please God, fix the damn save system, because that was horrible.

455
00:29:53,388 --> 00:29:56,169
[SPEAKER_06]: I stopped playing the game because of that, sadly.

456
00:29:56,789 --> 00:30:00,290
[SPEAKER_06]: That and the fact that my monitor sucked at the time, so I couldn't see anything in the dark.

457
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:03,751
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, fix the save system.

458
00:30:04,656 --> 00:30:08,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix

459
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,031
[SPEAKER_08]: The HD remix, of course, supports widescreen.

460
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:32,491
[SPEAKER_08]: We kind of figured that would happen.

461
00:30:32,771 --> 00:30:37,753
[SPEAKER_08]: The music has all been completely remixed for the game, which doesn't actually surprise me too much.

462
00:30:37,793 --> 00:30:38,873
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we needed that, too.

463
00:30:40,273 --> 00:30:49,216
[SPEAKER_08]: There will also be, however, not just the HD version, but an arcade mirror of the Super Street Fighter II Turbo arcade version.

464
00:30:49,256 --> 00:30:52,837
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you want your purist version, that will be included in the game.

465
00:30:53,697 --> 00:30:57,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, apparently, some balancing has gone into effect, some rebalancing.

466
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:05,986
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if that means some attacks do more damages, or some characters' movements are different, or what have you, but there has been some rebalancing done.

467
00:31:06,367 --> 00:31:09,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Not the first time Capcom's gone back and rebalanced one of their games.

468
00:31:09,549 --> 00:31:13,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Just take a look at Puzzle Fighter 2, had some rebalancing going on with the drops.

469
00:31:14,112 --> 00:31:18,816
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you wanted to, you could also play in your arcade-perfect-nothing-has-been-changed mode.

470
00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:19,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, um,

471
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:58,923
[SPEAKER_04]: One other thing that I think is very, very, very cool, and I'm very, very, very excited about this, is that Bionic Commando is getting a remake.

472
00:31:59,644 --> 00:32:01,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck yeah, it's about fucking time.

473
00:32:01,244 --> 00:32:02,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck yes.

474
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,465
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if you still get to kill Hitler in it.

475
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:08,521
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but it still looks awesome if you've seen the video for it.

476
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:12,485
[SPEAKER_08]: I've only seen the little preview that showed the screenshots.

477
00:32:12,525 --> 00:32:13,646
[SPEAKER_08]: I've not seen the game in motion.

478
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:15,007
[SPEAKER_08]: No, the video is all here.

479
00:32:15,087 --> 00:32:18,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I was a little nervous about the 3D looking.

480
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:25,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean... Well, at any rate, it's going to be on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

481
00:32:26,338 --> 00:32:28,720
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm noticing that we're getting a lot more...

482
00:32:29,802 --> 00:32:33,906
[SPEAKER_04]: What would have been usually a console or only game on the PC now?

483
00:32:34,346 --> 00:32:36,588
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot more love for PC gamers.

484
00:32:36,668 --> 00:32:37,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why.

485
00:32:37,229 --> 00:32:38,690
[SPEAKER_04]: No one plays games on the PC anymore.

486
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

487
00:32:40,111 --> 00:32:40,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody.

488
00:32:41,012 --> 00:32:43,194
[SPEAKER_08]: You know you just got yelled at by several people in chat.

489
00:32:43,214 --> 00:32:44,435
[SPEAKER_06]: I beat sarcastic people.

490
00:32:44,535 --> 00:32:44,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit.

491
00:32:44,995 --> 00:32:45,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

492
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:47,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you that dumb?

493
00:32:47,497 --> 00:32:49,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course people play games on a PC.

494
00:32:49,459 --> 00:32:50,720
[SPEAKER_04]: How many million people play WoW?

495
00:32:50,740 --> 00:33:01,269
[SPEAKER_04]: It used to be that we'd mainly get our first person shooters on PC, but now we're seeing more and more of them on consoles, and we're seeing more and more platformers come out for PC.

496
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:06,694
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like the whole gaming community is now sort of banding together.

497
00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:10,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, remember folks, the PlayStation 3 is a computer, remember?

498
00:33:10,317 --> 00:33:11,038
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not.

499
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:16,001
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but according to the marketing, that's a little more accurate.

500
00:33:16,302 --> 00:33:16,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it is.

501
00:33:16,802 --> 00:33:17,263
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not.

502
00:33:17,303 --> 00:33:17,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it is.

503
00:33:17,783 --> 00:33:18,224
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not.

504
00:33:18,324 --> 00:33:22,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at any rate, Capcom is working with Grin.

505
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,692
[SPEAKER_04]: They did a Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter PC.

506
00:33:27,853 --> 00:33:34,940
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also, they have not announced a Wii release.

507
00:33:35,641 --> 00:33:36,621
[SPEAKER_08]: And Tigerclaw on our chat.

508
00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:37,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a release date.

509
00:33:37,591 --> 00:33:41,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Tigerclaw in our chatroom has something to say about the lack of a Wii Bionic Commando.

510
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:43,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Surprisingly, no Wii version.

511
00:33:44,013 --> 00:33:48,814
[SPEAKER_08]: The game looks like something perfect for the Wiimote, and it's surprising that they're not making it for it.

512
00:33:49,134 --> 00:33:53,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo could have cashed in on it by re-releasing the original NES version on the Virtual Console.

513
00:33:54,095 --> 00:33:58,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they'll probably still try to cash in on it anyways, but here's the problem, though, with the Wii.

514
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,737
[SPEAKER_06]: It can't handle the game.

515
00:34:01,098 --> 00:34:05,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because it has the little waggle controls and stuff that would be perfect for this.

516
00:34:05,581 --> 00:34:07,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, Nintendo decided, hey, you know what?

517
00:34:08,043 --> 00:34:10,726
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't really care about graphics, so sorry.

518
00:34:11,286 --> 00:34:11,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't make that.

519
00:34:12,247 --> 00:34:15,469
[SPEAKER_06]: However, if they had ported it to the PlayStation 2, yeah, we could port that pretty easy.

520
00:34:15,509 --> 00:34:16,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, but wait a minute, though.

521
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:22,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately, that was Capcom's decision to say, we're going to go for, you know, the highest quality.

522
00:34:22,657 --> 00:34:29,638
[SPEAKER_08]: quality in looks and, you know, sound department as opposed to incorporating the wiggle waggles.

523
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:40,361
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to understand that people on the PlayStation 3 and 360 love action games, you know, much like, you know, Dead Rising, Lost Planet, you know, the new Bionic Commando game and stuff like that.

524
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:46,762
[SPEAKER_06]: We gamers only like Zack and Wiki, Quest for Rose Treasure.

525
00:34:47,202 --> 00:34:48,602
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only thing that they can have.

526
00:34:48,622 --> 00:34:50,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, that's my favorite fucking game right there.

527
00:34:51,283 --> 00:34:52,023
[SPEAKER_06]: That and Resident Evil 4.

528
00:34:52,637 --> 00:34:54,018
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little mix up there, but yeah.

529
00:34:55,478 --> 00:35:02,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that Capcom could do something if they were willing to, you know, focus on gameplay more.

530
00:35:03,621 --> 00:35:08,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Then again, one of the things I've always enjoyed about many Capcom games is that they do tend to have really good gameplay.

531
00:35:09,344 --> 00:35:10,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck that, make me some more Mega Man Legends.

532
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:11,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I can go on the Wii.

533
00:35:11,725 --> 00:35:12,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.

534
00:35:12,025 --> 00:35:12,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Done.

535
00:35:12,465 --> 00:35:12,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Done.

536
00:35:13,555 --> 00:35:14,815
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a series that needs to die.

537
00:35:15,235 --> 00:35:18,236
[SPEAKER_08]: NM64 wants to remind you also on the Wii, minigames.

538
00:35:18,756 --> 00:35:19,256
[SPEAKER_08]: My mistake.

539
00:35:19,276 --> 00:35:19,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of minigames.

540
00:35:20,256 --> 00:35:21,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Bionic Commando minigames.

541
00:35:21,497 --> 00:35:22,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, look, pop the bubbles.

542
00:35:23,657 --> 00:35:24,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Kill Hitler again and again.

543
00:35:27,618 --> 00:35:28,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Wii.

544
00:35:29,238 --> 00:35:29,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

545
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:34,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Dafo in the chat room would like to say, Zack and Wiki looks awesome.

546
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:35,620
[SPEAKER_08]: How dare that be bashed?

547
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,800
[SPEAKER_08]: How dare you, Loki, on this program?

548
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,001
[SPEAKER_04]: On this show, there's not much that we don't dare to do.

549
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:43,883
[SPEAKER_04]: at different times.

550
00:35:44,044 --> 00:35:49,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Son of Dad would like to remind us all that Okami's being ported to the Wii and not to next-gen with sharp graphics.

551
00:35:49,827 --> 00:35:55,170
[SPEAKER_08]: So the Wii is getting kind of something that... I think it's been proven that the Wii can handle cell shading fairly well.

552
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't Okami cell shaded?

553
00:35:56,891 --> 00:36:00,313
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just awfully surprised that Wii's getting yet another PlayStation 2 port.

554
00:36:00,353 --> 00:36:01,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm, that's surprising.

555
00:36:02,214 --> 00:36:07,997
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, with Resident Evil 4 and all those other fucking games that PlayStation 2, Xbox 360 port, or Xbox ports...

556
00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:15,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Ryoma says, if you're going to do the Bionic Commando minigames, pick Hitler's nose.

557
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that one game in WarioWare.

558
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:22,460
[SPEAKER_06]: This just in on the Smash Dojo.

559
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Hitler, the new character.

560
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,844
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about that one.

561
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

562
00:36:31,994 --> 00:36:40,137
[SPEAKER_04]: and M64 reminds you very subtly, but not really, that RE4 was a GameCube port, not a PS2 port.

563
00:36:41,778 --> 00:36:46,960
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it was a PlayStation 2 port for this one because it had the upgraded graphics from the PlayStation 2 and the additional features.

564
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,860
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it was on the GameCube too.

565
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:55,023
[SPEAKER_06]: So they could have hybrid, you know, some bastard child of the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions.

566
00:36:55,043 --> 00:36:57,343
[SPEAKER_08]: So what you're basically trying to say is I'm right and you're wrong.

567
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:01,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's exact... Thank you for...

568
00:37:01,815 --> 00:37:02,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Nailing home my point there.

569
00:37:03,196 --> 00:37:04,577
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome, that's what I do here.

570
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:12,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, since these games won't be out until next year at the earliest, let's talk about some stuff you can get right now, this week.

571
00:37:12,584 --> 00:37:16,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely, and there's going to be lots of fun stuff coming out this week.

572
00:37:17,188 --> 00:37:27,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Some stuff, I don't know, people, why you want them or not, but of the many things, the ever-controversial...

573
00:37:28,175 --> 00:37:31,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Eye of Judgment is coming out this week on PlayStation 3.

574
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:36,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you'll be able to play your Magic the Gathering type of crap with the eye.

575
00:37:37,145 --> 00:37:38,206
[SPEAKER_06]: The PlayStation Eye.

576
00:37:38,426 --> 00:37:47,191
[SPEAKER_08]: And remember, folks, if one million copies of this game sell, Loki will dress up in a Tingle outfit and set an eye of judgment on fire for your viewing pleasure.

577
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:48,252
[SPEAKER_04]: He should dance around it.

578
00:37:48,712 --> 00:37:51,234
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you should do this anyway, because it would be so funny.

579
00:37:51,254 --> 00:37:52,214
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to do that.

580
00:37:52,495 --> 00:37:53,015
[SPEAKER_04]: You can burn it.

581
00:37:53,035 --> 00:37:54,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop trying to cop out.

582
00:37:54,776 --> 00:38:00,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, if it doesn't sell a million, though, while we will not require you to dress as Tingle, you need to at least wear the hat and burn it.

583
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,481
[SPEAKER_08]: What hat?

584
00:38:03,201 --> 00:38:10,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we negotiate that maybe if they can sell 50,000 units, you'll just wear the little green hat and set it on fire?

585
00:38:10,225 --> 00:38:11,386
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not doing that.

586
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:13,387
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all or nothing.

587
00:38:14,568 --> 00:38:14,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn it.

588
00:38:15,689 --> 00:38:17,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Will you at least set one on fire?

589
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, if someone sends me one for free, I'll set one on fire.

590
00:38:20,692 --> 00:38:21,652
[SPEAKER_06]: We should dance around it.

591
00:38:22,773 --> 00:38:24,374
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to buy one to set one on fire.

592
00:38:24,414 --> 00:38:25,355
[SPEAKER_06]: That's stupid.

593
00:38:25,455 --> 00:38:27,716
[SPEAKER_08]: If we all put in 20 bucks, we could buy one to set on fire.

594
00:38:27,776 --> 00:38:28,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

595
00:38:28,436 --> 00:38:28,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways.

596
00:38:29,497 --> 00:38:30,598
[SPEAKER_08]: BurnMyEyeOfJudgment.com

597
00:38:32,725 --> 00:38:36,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Ace Combat 6 is coming out on Xbox 360.

598
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:39,808
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty interesting.

599
00:38:40,248 --> 00:38:41,029
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it's a good game.

600
00:38:41,909 --> 00:38:44,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Clive Barker's Jericho is coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

601
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:47,311
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a horror first-person shooter game.

602
00:38:48,352 --> 00:38:52,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Conan, also coming out in both systems as well, and as I reviewed it, it's pretty good.

603
00:38:53,154 --> 00:38:54,794
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely worth checking it out.

604
00:38:56,775 --> 00:38:58,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, King of Fighters 11 on PlayStation 2.

605
00:39:00,189 --> 00:39:02,690
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a really budget game, too.

606
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,870
[SPEAKER_06]: $14.99, if I remember correctly.

607
00:39:04,311 --> 00:39:07,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Dancing with the Stars on the Wii and PlayStation 2.

608
00:39:08,152 --> 00:39:08,732
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

609
00:39:08,752 --> 00:39:09,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Yippee.

610
00:39:09,132 --> 00:39:10,253
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds fun.

611
00:39:10,313 --> 00:39:11,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, it's only on the Wii this week.

612
00:39:11,713 --> 00:39:12,814
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 2 is coming out later.

613

[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

614
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:38,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not buying it, but, you know, hey.

615
00:39:38,606 --> 00:39:41,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think it would be a good idea if they used the X-Tango engine.

616
00:39:41,567 --> 00:39:42,868
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be cool to rent it.

617
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:44,648
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's the X-Tango engine.

618
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:46,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, am I in Bizarro World?

619
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:49,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you guys actually hyping the Dancing with the Stars video game?

620
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:49,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I would play it.

621
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,371
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like 20 bucks, okay?

622
00:39:51,991 --> 00:39:53,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Dancing with the Stars.

623
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,492
[SPEAKER_08]: I like X-Tango.

624
00:39:54,532 --> 00:39:55,332
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I'll give you that.

625
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:58,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey, I'm not seeing this game as X-Tango, okay?

626
00:39:58,974 --> 00:39:59,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Because...

627
00:39:59,881 --> 00:40:02,543
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to dirty the Xtango name with this game.

628
00:40:02,643 --> 00:40:03,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, my bad.

629
00:40:03,223 --> 00:40:04,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Apologies to the folks behind Xtango.

630
00:40:04,684 --> 00:40:07,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I do like Dancing with the Stars, Rob.

631
00:40:07,945 --> 00:40:08,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

632
00:40:08,246 --> 00:40:09,446
[SPEAKER_08]: But you don't watch TV, I thought.

633
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I watch the dances on YouTube.

634
00:40:12,508 --> 00:40:12,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

635
00:40:12,608 --> 00:40:15,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was all about the Stacey Keebler series.

636
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

637
00:40:17,811 --> 00:40:20,092
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 3 is getting quite a few games here.

638
00:40:20,132 --> 00:40:21,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Juice 2, Hot Import Nights.

[SPEAKER_06]: Ratchet & Clank Future, Tools of Destruction.

641
00:40:25,155 --> 00:40:26,075

00:40:26,575 --> 00:40:29,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Ratatouille, that's coming out.

643
00:40:29,944 --> 00:40:31,925

[SPEAKER_06]: Namco Museum Remix, hooray, that's also coming out on the Wii.

00:40:50,613 --> 00:40:51,473

00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:25,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Spanish for Everyone?

00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,621

[SPEAKER_06]: Chess Master, The Art of Learning, that's what it's called.

658
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:41,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine Master Chef.

659
00:41:42,598 --> 00:41:42,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

660
00:41:44,518 --> 00:41:46,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the rest of the Imagine games are coming out this week.

661
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,260

00:41:55,948 --> 00:41:57,109
[SPEAKER_04]: I want Imagine Sniper.

668
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:58,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

669
00:41:59,651 --> 00:42:03,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, you know, snipers, not that popular with little girls.

670
00:42:04,175 --> 00:42:05,476
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to be a sniper when I was growing up.

671
00:42:05,496 --> 00:42:07,798
[SPEAKER_06]: But when it does become popular, they will have Imagine Snipers.

672
00:42:08,198 --> 00:42:09,579
[SPEAKER_06]: But unfortunately, they don't right now.

673
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:11,521
[SPEAKER_04]: GS68 says Imagine John Lennon.

674
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:21,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine, or, I'm sorry, Pocket Pets, which is yet another pet-raising sim, and apparently, judging by the cover, it features bunnies, kittens, and little birdies.

675
00:42:22,463 --> 00:42:23,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

676
00:42:24,984 --> 00:42:26,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's the hippopotamuses?

677
00:42:26,765 --> 00:42:27,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Or hippopotami?

678
00:42:27,425 --> 00:42:29,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiger Claw says Imagine OLR, by the way.

679
00:42:31,261 --> 00:42:36,604
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I was going to say also Naruto Clash of the Ninja Revolution on Wii.

680
00:42:37,544 --> 00:42:41,306
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally just a small little game, of course, on almost everything.

681
00:42:41,366 --> 00:42:45,427
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, 360, Wii, and maybe the PC this week.

682
00:42:46,248 --> 00:42:50,170
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually a week from now, Guitar Hero 3 will be making its way out.

683
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:52,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

684
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:53,271
[SPEAKER_06]: On a Sunday.

685
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:54,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, is that out this Tuesday?

686
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:55,932
[SPEAKER_06]: It's out on next Sunday.

687
00:42:55,952 --> 00:42:56,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's on Sunday.

688
00:42:57,053 --> 00:42:57,333
[SPEAKER_06]: On the 28th.

689
00:42:58,547 --> 00:43:01,449
[SPEAKER_06]: because they have to be so cool Sunday.

690
00:43:02,689 --> 00:43:06,091
[SPEAKER_08]: This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, Guitar Hero 3 for everybody.

691
00:43:06,432 --> 00:43:07,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see here.

692
00:43:07,072 --> 00:43:09,914
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, I'm looking real quick on the PC stuff.

693
00:43:11,635 --> 00:43:14,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there are some interesting PC games I was going to mention real quick.

694
00:43:16,378 --> 00:43:22,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Dream Day Honeymoon, which I have no idea what that is, but I want to take a look here real quick.

695
00:43:22,581 --> 00:43:23,922
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to go on a Dream Day Honeymoon?

696
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:25,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Dream Day Honeymoon.

697
00:43:25,276 --> 00:43:28,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, there's no information for that whatsoever, but that is available if you're curious.

698
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:32,942
[SPEAKER_06]: And some Agatha Christie game.

699
00:43:34,343 --> 00:43:34,643
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

700
00:43:35,544 --> 00:43:35,844
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

701
00:43:36,244 --> 00:43:40,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's travel over to Japan and see what our friends overseas in Japan are picking up this week.

702
00:43:41,488 --> 00:43:44,831
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get on the Xbox 360, Bladestorm.

703
00:43:44,911 --> 00:43:47,573
[SPEAKER_08]: The Hundred Years War is coming out on the Xbox 360.

704
00:43:47,973 --> 00:43:51,776
[SPEAKER_08]: That's from Koei, who I believe brought you Dynasty Wars.

705
00:43:51,816 --> 00:43:51,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

706
00:43:53,348 --> 00:43:54,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I forgot to mention, U.S.

707
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:57,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Tomb Raider Anniversary on the 360th.

708
00:43:57,772 --> 00:43:58,433
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my turn now.

709
00:43:59,114 --> 00:43:59,494
[SPEAKER_07]: My turn.

710
00:43:59,634 --> 00:44:01,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done.

711
00:44:01,936 --> 00:44:03,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party!

712
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:12,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Yubamani fans over in Japan get a chance now with the Wii version of DDR, the latest title, finally hitting Japanese shelves this week.

713
00:44:13,127 --> 00:44:13,368
[SPEAKER_08]: That's...

714
00:44:14,498 --> 00:44:16,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually, I remember back in the day, it used to be the other way around.

715
00:44:16,939 --> 00:44:21,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Japan would get these games like years before we would get them, and now it seems like we get a few of these first.

716
00:44:22,141 --> 00:44:23,582
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the same thing happened with Supernova 2.

717
00:44:23,922 --> 00:44:24,382
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember.

718
00:44:25,422 --> 00:44:30,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Also on the Nintendo Wii, Ghost Squad is coming out from Sega in Japan.

719
00:44:31,165 --> 00:44:34,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Also coming out on the Wii, the simple Wii series.

720
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:42,189
[SPEAKER_08]: There's Volume 1, the Mina de Kart Race, and there's Volume 2, the Mina de Basuri Takai is coming out.

721
00:44:42,689 --> 00:44:44,030
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm assuming that's like

722
00:44:44,887 --> 00:44:46,728
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a Mario Kart game.

723
00:45:09,133 --> 00:45:10,434
[SPEAKER_06]: The Eye of Judgment God of War 2 The End Begins

724
00:45:37,783 --> 00:45:43,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, Itsuka Todoku Ano Sora Ni is coming out.

725
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:50,238
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an adventure game that looks to be based on yet another anime starring cute little girls in schoolgirl outfits.

726
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:55,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Also coming out on the PlayStation 3, Baldur Bullet Equilibrium coming from Alchemist.

727
00:45:56,284 --> 00:45:58,447
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like another mech warrior type game.

728
00:45:59,793 --> 00:46:00,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Dungeon Maker Final Fantasy Tactics A2

729
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Frogman Show Action Minigames

730
00:46:53,089 --> 00:46:54,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Action-based minigames.

731
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:56,050
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it for Japanese releases.

732
00:47:18,112 --> 00:47:44,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Coded Arms Contagion, Escape from Paradise City on PSP, Escape from Paradise City on PC, Jackass the Game on PSP, Juice 2, Hot Import Nights, King of Clubs, Metroid Prime 3, Corruption on Wii, NBA 2K8, NBA Live 08, NHL 2K8, Paint by DS, Portal on PlayStation 3, Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 on a bunch of stuff, Stranglehold, Syphon Filter, Dark Mirror,

733
00:47:46,085 --> 00:47:57,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Team Fortress 2, The Sims 2, Castaway, The Witcher on PC, Virtua Fighter 5, Who the Hell Cares, Wipeout Pulse on PSP, and Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 on PSP.

734
00:47:58,755 --> 00:47:59,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, awesome.

735
00:48:00,717 --> 00:48:13,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in un-gaming release news, apparently this week they've been having some interesting guests on the morning show here in the US, and

736
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:14,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Susan Bartel

737
00:48:41,053 --> 00:48:48,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Supergirl in the show says, when kids play violent video games, we can see that their brains are different than when they play non-violent games.

738
00:48:49,017 --> 00:48:55,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Going on to say, we can see a very big difference in their brains, which tells us how dangerous these games can be.

739
00:48:57,882 --> 00:49:06,627
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know... Just an FYI, according to Wikipedia, the morning show with Mike and Juliet is mostly on Fox and My Network TV stations.

740
00:49:06,687 --> 00:49:07,267
[SPEAKER_08]: It's syndicated.

741
00:49:08,688 --> 00:49:09,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

742
00:49:10,229 --> 00:49:10,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

743
00:49:11,221 --> 00:49:24,291
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, they're saying that, I guess she wrapped the whole segment up by saying they're going to react in the same highly aroused, angry way that we saw what happened yesterday.

744
00:49:24,331 --> 00:49:30,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, they were talking about a school shooting that happened in Cleveland that she was referencing back to that.

745
00:49:30,456 --> 00:49:38,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the interesting thing about that, though, you see, because Game Politics actually went and asked her about that.

746
00:49:38,763 --> 00:49:40,444
[SPEAKER_06]: because they had some issues with it.

747
00:49:40,584 --> 00:49:52,154
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that they found, I guess, concerning, I guess, was a comment when they saw the Indiana University brain scan pic five minutes before the airing of the show.

748
00:49:52,654 --> 00:50:04,704
[SPEAKER_06]: So she had looked at, basically, the brain scan image literally minutes before the show started, and they were saying, well, how can you base your professional opinion on just a brief glance at it?

749
00:50:05,364 --> 00:50:07,246
[SPEAKER_06]: And she was saying, well, it's, you know...

750
00:50:08,836 --> 00:50:14,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Not concrete proof, but that doesn't change anything.

751
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:20,462
[SPEAKER_06]: She's saying that maybe it's a little bit sensationalized because it's on TV and stuff.

752
00:50:20,682 --> 00:50:22,083
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, I understand how you feel.

753
00:50:22,123 --> 00:50:24,644
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an element of sensationalism to it, I suppose.

754
00:50:25,224 --> 00:50:29,567
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't, five minutes before going on air, say, sorry, I won't do it.

755
00:50:30,507 --> 00:50:33,329
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have enough background information about this brain scan.

756
00:50:33,389 --> 00:50:35,610
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not that much of a purist.

757
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:37,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, she's talking out of her ass.

758
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:39,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

759
00:50:39,920 --> 00:51:04,220
[SPEAKER_06]: And then to follow up with the whole thing, Game Politics also ran another story about, I guess it was being reported in Scientific America, Richard Tremblay, a professor of pediatrics, psychiatry, and psychology, said that kids were aggressive before modern media came along, so we can't blame modern media for kids being aggressive.

760
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then again, wasn't there the study on how...

761
00:51:08,152 --> 00:51:09,353
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

762
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Blaze says, couldn't various games cause the same brain scan read?

763
00:51:41,945 --> 00:51:45,150
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkShy wants to know, why are all school shootings blamed on video games?

764
00:51:46,161 --> 00:51:58,386
[SPEAKER_08]: and GS68 is wondering, since we call Tack Johnson, because we don't want to call him by name and he's effectively banned from the show, since we call him Lord Voldemort, just in case you're first time listening and you wonder, who the hell is Voldemort?

765
00:51:58,766 --> 00:52:02,267
[SPEAKER_08]: It's that guy, that lawyer guy that needs to STFU.

766
00:52:03,168 --> 00:52:07,329
[SPEAKER_08]: GS68 is wondering, should we call this lady Bellatrix Lestrange?

767
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,451
[SPEAKER_01]: She had an unhealthy obsession with...

768
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:19,393
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest, I don't think she's going to be randomly posting on different websites about shit, making threats, and acting purely crazy.

769
00:52:21,134 --> 00:52:26,136
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't think we really need to worry about calling her anything else, since obviously she's going to be out of the news.

770
00:52:27,456 --> 00:52:28,517
[SPEAKER_04]: We should call her Loser.

771
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:33,819
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, I agree with what Shadow Charlie said, and honestly, I think this just pretty much sums up our feedback.

772
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:36,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Shadow Charlie in our chatroom says, she can shut the fuck up.

773
00:52:38,303 --> 00:52:39,124
[SPEAKER_08]: She really can.

774
00:52:39,645 --> 00:52:45,431
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, people like this just get our anger going and our blood boiling.

775
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:56,083
[SPEAKER_08]: You knew when you read this story on Game Politics or wherever you might have seen it earlier this week, you knew that on this program, this segment would be following a story about this stupid, stupid woman.

776
00:52:56,544 --> 00:52:57,465
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the FUs of the Week.

777
00:53:13,636 --> 00:53:19,438
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week goes towards certain things at my place of employment.

778
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:34,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Without getting into too much detail about what I do for a living, I work a job that they assign tasks to me that I'm supposed to have done within a certain number of days, right?

779
00:53:35,723 --> 00:53:38,384
[SPEAKER_04]: And on average, I do about 70 to 80 a day.

780
00:53:39,144 --> 00:53:41,885
[SPEAKER_04]: So I come in one day and there's 600 and something of them.

781
00:53:42,924 --> 00:53:45,626
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, I closed 110 that day.

782
00:53:46,947 --> 00:53:48,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is a lot more than I usually do.

783
00:53:49,108 --> 00:53:51,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I came back the next day, there were 704.

784
00:53:52,711 --> 00:53:53,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I closed 90 that day.

785
00:53:54,011 --> 00:53:55,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I came back in, there were 780.

786
00:53:58,154 --> 00:53:59,335
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

787
00:53:59,995 --> 00:54:09,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I have a right to complain about this because, um, if I don't finish enough of it within my turnaround time, then it comes back and I get dinged for it.

788
00:54:10,503 --> 00:54:11,083
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um,

789
00:54:11,937 --> 00:54:20,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be surprised when certain things happen, is all I'm going to say.

790
00:54:20,541 --> 00:54:24,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, and every time I try to apply for another position at work, I'm written up for something.

791
00:54:25,584 --> 00:54:26,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

792
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:29,326
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Loki, let loose.

793
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:30,066
[SPEAKER_08]: F yous of the week.

794
00:54:30,547 --> 00:54:40,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you to Kanye West for ruining Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger by the Daft Punk and trying to claim, I guess, make his own song by sampling that entire thing.

795
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:44,316
[SPEAKER_06]: He's awful as an artist to begin with.

796
00:54:44,616 --> 00:54:46,318
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also watched Saturday Night Live.

797
00:54:46,458 --> 00:54:49,920
[SPEAKER_06]: They had another song that he did where he sampled Pretty Young Thing from Michael Jackson.

798
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, an unoriginal bastard who needs to fucking die.

799
00:54:53,542 --> 00:54:55,043
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he has no talent.

800
00:54:55,423 --> 00:54:57,445
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hate people that fucking sample shit.

801
00:54:59,006 --> 00:55:00,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Also looking at you, Black Eyed Peas.

802
00:55:00,567 --> 00:55:01,547
[SPEAKER_06]: You fucking suck too.

803
00:55:01,647 --> 00:55:03,108
[SPEAKER_06]: So, F you to both of them.

804
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:09,072
[SPEAKER_08]: My F you of the week goes to Children That Go To Disneyland.

805
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:10,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get back into some news.

806
00:55:40,472 --> 00:55:43,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Game Boy and Game Boy Pocket Rarity and Scarcity of Repair Parts

807
00:56:05,274 --> 00:56:08,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, when I first read this, I was actually surprised.

808
00:56:08,315 --> 00:56:10,755
[SPEAKER_08]: They've still been repairing Famicoms this long?

809
00:56:11,635 --> 00:56:11,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

810
00:56:12,055 --> 00:56:15,156
[SPEAKER_08]: But apparently they were, and unfortunately now it is over.

811
00:56:15,536 --> 00:56:19,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, this is just Nintendo of Japan, but still, you know.

812
00:56:19,337 --> 00:56:22,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, seriously, if you have a broken Nintendo, don't go out and buy something else.

813
00:56:22,457 --> 00:56:25,518
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously, why are you still playing Nintendo?

814
00:56:25,538 --> 00:56:26,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Bad news for retro collectors, though.

815
00:56:26,978 --> 00:56:27,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

816
00:56:27,678 --> 00:56:31,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder, though, if, well, you know, that means that the prices of these systems are going to go up.

817
00:56:32,025 --> 00:56:42,768
[SPEAKER_04]: because to use pinball as a comparison, for machines that start seeing revivals when you can start getting parts for them again, the price of the tables goes down.

818
00:56:43,268 --> 00:56:49,990
[SPEAKER_04]: But when they stop making the replacement plastics and stuff for some of the other tables, the value jumps up by at least $5,000.

819
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:58,912
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest, a lot of people that are collecting these retro systems anyways probably know how to fix them, or if they don't know how to fix them, know of somebody who can fix them.

820
00:56:59,352 --> 00:57:00,713
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there are other websites other than...

821
00:57:01,953 --> 00:57:04,775
[SPEAKER_06]: or there are other people out there that know how to fix these systems.

822
00:57:04,855 --> 00:57:06,136
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just Nintendo.

823
00:57:06,496 --> 00:57:07,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a thought.

824
00:57:07,297 --> 00:57:09,538
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet this is why they're ending the support now.

825
00:57:10,139 --> 00:57:20,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would they want to encourage people to buy the games at garage sales and stuff on these old systems when they have this brand spanking new virtual console that's delivering all the games from these old consoles?

826
00:57:20,766 --> 00:57:22,267
[SPEAKER_08]: This is why they're ending support now.

827
00:57:23,387 --> 00:57:24,928
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll bet you.

828
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:27,410
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just because of what they actually said.

829
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:28,771
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think I'm right and you're wrong.

830
00:57:29,301 --> 00:57:30,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, Game Boy Color.

831
00:57:30,582 --> 00:57:34,504
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't see any Game Boy Color stuff on fucking... Yet.

832
00:57:35,265 --> 00:57:36,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, come on.

833
00:57:36,145 --> 00:57:37,586
[SPEAKER_06]: It would look like shit.

834
00:57:38,167 --> 00:57:39,408
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my theory behind it.

835
00:57:40,849 --> 00:57:49,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Why waste manpower on something the company itself has decided was obsolete when they can focus towards their current thing?

836
00:57:50,815 --> 00:57:53,837
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sort of like paying somebody to fix a Betamax.

837
00:57:55,058 --> 00:57:55,318
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?

838
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:57,637
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of buy that.

839
00:57:57,697 --> 00:57:58,657
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes sense to me.

840
00:57:58,697 --> 00:58:01,880
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, why didn't they do that 10 years ago with the Famicom?

841
00:58:02,881 --> 00:58:04,603
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Famicom has been out like 20 years.

842
00:58:05,143 --> 00:58:10,609
[SPEAKER_04]: But 10 years ago, I think that they still had a big enough user base because 10 years ago, what was it that we were seeing out?

843
00:58:10,649 --> 00:58:12,050
[SPEAKER_04]: I was still playing my Super Nintendo.

844
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:14,112
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the N64 had just been out.

845
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:17,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the Famicom is still probably outselling the PlayStation 3.

846
00:58:17,441 --> 00:58:25,008
[SPEAKER_04]: And on top of that, the only way you could get any of your retro games is to either own the old system or to play on emulators.

847
00:58:25,548 --> 00:58:33,555
[SPEAKER_04]: But now we have it to where all these games are being re-released on, you know, we have Virtual Console, we have Xbox Live Arcade.

848
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:37,038
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're looking at it as progress.

849
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:42,223
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the point now when they can get the same thing on one of our more up-to-date systems?

850
00:58:43,146 --> 00:58:45,868
[SPEAKER_04]: So why should they waste the support, manpower, and product?

851
00:58:45,968 --> 00:58:53,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if they make some systems actually put on the market, you know, so we can buy them to replace our broken Famicom.

852
00:58:53,034 --> 00:58:53,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe that's why.

853
00:58:53,895 --> 00:58:54,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, okay.

854
00:58:54,495 --> 00:58:56,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, maybe that's why they've got to pull the old support.

855
00:58:56,397 --> 00:58:57,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Get some people on the assembly line.

856
00:58:57,918 --> 00:59:08,146
[SPEAKER_04]: And to go back to my, I guess, analogy to the Betamax, you know, you can't get Sony to replace your Betamax machine, but you can go to specialty repair shops and they'll do it.

857
00:59:08,446 --> 00:59:09,867
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be the same way with old systems.

858
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:11,829
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

859
00:59:12,537 --> 00:59:13,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Virtual Console Stuff for the UK!

860
00:59:33,687 --> 00:59:39,628
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we are seeing out this time is World Heroes, which was a Neo Geo game.

861
00:59:40,188 --> 00:59:44,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really one of my favorite fighters, but it was pretty, pretty good, and it's 900 points.

862
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:50,531
[SPEAKER_04]: And then coming up is Gate of Thunder from the TurboGrafx-16.

863
00:59:51,431 --> 01:00:02,053
[SPEAKER_04]: It was made by Hudson, and that was a pretty damn good game, where you have your ship called the Hunting Dog, and you are saving the starlight power.

864
01:00:03,228 --> 01:00:07,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's cool because the planet referred to as Planet Ares and I'm an Ares, so that's cool.

865
01:00:07,592 --> 01:00:08,213
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 800 points.

866
01:00:08,914 --> 01:00:17,302
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and then, and for anyone who watches the Angry Nintendo Nerd, you'll know where my frustration with this game comes from for exactly the same reason he did.

867
01:00:17,743 --> 01:00:22,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Castlevania II, Simon's Quest for the NES, where, you know...

868
01:00:22,984 --> 01:00:24,305
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

869
01:00:44,179 --> 01:00:46,181
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I haven't played a virtual console in a while.

870
01:00:46,221 --> 01:00:48,603
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a freaking awesome game, though.

871
01:00:48,623 --> 01:00:50,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Despite the frustration, I love the game.

872
01:00:50,424 --> 01:00:52,786
[SPEAKER_08]: And honestly, the music is half of what makes that game.

873
01:00:54,347 --> 01:00:55,848
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping it's over here on Monday.

874
01:00:56,729 --> 01:00:59,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see us get the Japanese version of Castlevania III.

875
01:01:01,013 --> 01:01:02,714
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the difference between that and this one?

876
01:01:02,754 --> 01:01:05,816
[SPEAKER_04]: It was certain gameplay factions that they took out.

877
01:01:05,876 --> 01:01:08,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for example, if you use the... Oh, God, I can't remember his name now.

878
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:09,679
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy who used the dagger?

879
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:10,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Grant?

880
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:11,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Grant, yes.

881
01:01:11,441 --> 01:01:11,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

882
01:01:12,172 --> 01:01:13,873
[SPEAKER_04]: In the Japanese version, he would throw the dagger.

883
01:01:14,914 --> 01:01:16,574
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it gave you ranged attack with him.

884
01:01:18,355 --> 01:01:20,276
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just one of the things I remember.

885
01:01:20,316 --> 01:01:22,337
[SPEAKER_08]: I always liked to use Alucard because he could turn into the bat.

886
01:01:24,538 --> 01:01:26,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Grant because he can climb on walls.

887
01:01:26,679 --> 01:01:27,100
[SPEAKER_08]: This is true.

888
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,880
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there was the guy that had the orbs, right?

889
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:29,621
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even remember.

890
01:01:29,821 --> 01:01:30,881
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Saifa.

891
01:01:31,402 --> 01:01:31,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

892
01:01:32,202 --> 01:01:32,802
[SPEAKER_08]: That's old school.

893
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:33,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

894
01:01:33,983 --> 01:01:34,363
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

895
01:01:34,963 --> 01:01:35,564
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, that's 500 points.

896
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:42,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Tiger Claw would like to point out DarkSakura, also the fact that it had two different endings, and in one of them, Simon Belmont dies.

897
01:01:42,534 --> 01:01:43,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that was the other thing.

898
01:01:44,856 --> 01:01:47,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I've played the disc version of it.

899
01:01:48,198 --> 01:01:54,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Luckily, I've played a disc version of it, and the music was also a little bit different, but then again, the disc games had a different music processor.

900
01:01:54,562 --> 01:01:57,524
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, didn't they have an extra sound channel in Japan for that stuff?

901
01:01:58,065 --> 01:01:58,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

902
01:01:58,786 --> 01:02:03,889
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I remember one of my old roommates who was really into collecting games had the old, old Castlevania III.

903
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:04,610
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I played it.

904
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:05,410
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was part of the reason.

905
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:06,831
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the first time I played it, though.

906
01:02:07,672 --> 01:02:10,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I played a disc one later on than that, but he brought it over to my house.

907
01:02:11,975 --> 01:02:12,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah.

908
01:02:12,615 --> 01:02:13,176
[SPEAKER_07]: I never played it.

909
01:02:13,576 --> 01:02:14,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

910
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:15,157
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

911
01:02:15,917 --> 01:02:25,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, soon enough, GameTap will be hitting 1,000 games, and they're supposed to hit this wonderful landmark achievement on November 15th.

912
01:02:27,089 --> 01:02:31,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Ice Station Santa Abe Lincoln Must Die Missed Uru Online's final episode in the Season 1 story arc will begin the 1st of November

913
01:02:56,279 --> 01:02:57,220
[SPEAKER_06]: and let's see here.

914
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:08,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess now the first three Hitman games will be free to play for the non-subscribers as that part of kind of a free game sampling that they have there that's ad-supported.

915
01:03:08,987 --> 01:03:14,270
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess a new season of Revisioned, which before was looking at Lord Croft.

916
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:17,972
[SPEAKER_06]: They haven't said which character they're going to do this time or which series.

917
01:03:18,532 --> 01:03:21,254
[SPEAKER_06]: And then game trailers for various games.

918
01:03:23,295 --> 01:03:23,635
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

919
01:03:24,471 --> 01:03:24,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds like fun.

920
01:03:25,632 --> 01:03:31,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I keep neglecting to go back to GameTap and checking out some of those other new games that they have, like BlastMiner.

921
01:03:31,617 --> 01:03:38,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Now they're starting to put out the indie games, too, and I'm pretty sure BlastMiner finally made its way to GameTap, so I've got to check out some of the indie stuff they have on there.

922
01:03:39,511 --> 01:03:44,653
[SPEAKER_08]: I still wish though, they have Civilization 3 up in their archives, but they don't have Civ 1.

923
01:03:44,973 --> 01:03:56,457
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, for whatever reason, and I know I've gone into this tirade on the show before, so I'll keep it short tonight, but I prefer Civilization 1, the old school one, compared to any other Civ they've released since then.

924
01:03:56,997 --> 01:04:02,059
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Sid Meier, if you happen to be listening, please let them have Civilization on GameTap.

925
01:04:02,479 --> 01:04:04,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I would love you if you'd let them have Covert Action.

926
01:04:05,336 --> 01:04:09,304
[SPEAKER_08]: because that was like my favorite Sid Meier game ever and probably nobody's ever heard of it.

927
01:04:10,507 --> 01:04:12,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, speaking of...

928
01:04:14,045 --> 01:04:14,865
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

929
01:04:36,815 --> 01:04:37,676
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

930
01:05:07,346 --> 01:05:09,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Looking forward to getting more information on the game.

931
01:05:09,767 --> 01:05:16,750
[SPEAKER_08]: All we know so far is that there is a main character named the Little King, and he creates towns to basically build up a new country.

932
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:23,112
[SPEAKER_08]: He uses special powers to make elemental skills, and basically this is all used to develop the land.

933
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:25,373
[SPEAKER_08]: So it almost sounds like it's some type of sim game.

934
01:05:25,894 --> 01:05:28,895
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like one half of Actraiser.

935
01:05:28,935 --> 01:05:30,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, no problem with that.

936
01:05:30,675 --> 01:05:31,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I freaking love Actraiser.

937
01:05:32,116 --> 01:05:32,416
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

938
01:05:32,436 --> 01:05:34,377
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if I had a kid, I'd name him Little King.

939
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:39,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Son of Dad says Wii needs a hard drive bad.

940
01:05:40,456 --> 01:05:46,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm also curious how the Wii is going to fit all this stuff in here, but I wouldn't be surprised.

941
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo's going to come out sometime next year.

942
01:05:48,261 --> 01:05:49,842
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the SD cards are for.

943
01:05:50,722 --> 01:05:58,207
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to come out at some point, and they're going to say, we have this super hidden expansion port thing, and we're bringing out this thing.

944
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:03,770
[SPEAKER_04]: If you invert your Wii, you'll find the port hidden somewhere on the system motherboard.

945
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:06,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there are expansion ports that aren't being used on there right now, right?

946
01:06:06,752 --> 01:06:07,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Or USB, right?

947
01:06:07,132 --> 01:06:07,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

948
01:06:08,574 --> 01:06:09,717
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got USB connections.

949
01:06:09,797 --> 01:06:10,760
[SPEAKER_06]: It does have USB.

950
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:14,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell, if you even wanted to get like crazy with it, you could have something that plugs into like

951
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:18,282
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of irritated because they have all these hard drives that run on USB now, right?

952
01:06:18,342 --> 01:06:20,222
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like, I think I saw one at Target the other day.

953
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:22,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, Jamie has one, but I've seen, now they even have new ones that are 500 gigabytes.

954
01:06:22,983 --> 01:06:23,443
[SPEAKER_06]: 500 gigabyte USB drive.

955
01:06:23,463 --> 01:06:23,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine's 500 gigabytes.

956
01:06:24,003 --> 01:06:24,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it really?

957
01:06:24,344 --> 01:06:25,264
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you said like a 300 something.

958
01:06:25,284 --> 01:06:25,864
[SPEAKER_08]: I paid $120 for it.

959
01:06:43,909 --> 01:06:44,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.

960
01:06:44,629 --> 01:06:46,210
[SPEAKER_08]: 500 gigabytes for one of those things.

961
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:49,750
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can't... It's USB, but I can't hook it up to my Wii.

962
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:51,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Or I can't hook it up to my 360.

963
01:06:52,051 --> 01:06:58,472
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't... I mean, because of... Because you know they're going to want you to use anything with their name on it so they can market it and make money on it.

964
01:06:58,492 --> 01:06:59,892
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just saying that sucks.

965
01:07:00,412 --> 01:07:05,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Because seriously, what else am I going to fill up the 500 gigabytes with besides lots of pornography?

966
01:07:05,033 --> 01:07:05,734
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to find a way.

967
01:07:05,754 --> 01:07:06,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots and lots of pornography.

968
01:07:06,954 --> 01:07:07,814
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to find a way.

969
01:07:07,834 --> 01:07:09,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

970
01:07:09,094 --> 01:07:12,835
[SPEAKER_06]: My USB hard drive fits quite a few Xbox 360 games quite easily.

971
01:07:14,205 --> 01:07:14,786
[SPEAKER_06]: In theory.

972
01:07:14,946 --> 01:07:16,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Next story, please.

973
01:07:16,787 --> 01:07:31,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, MadCatz has decided that they are going to give their support to the National Breast Cancer Foundation and release a pink tech pack for the DS Lite.

974
01:07:32,898 --> 01:07:42,785
[SPEAKER_04]: It will have accessories that have a carry case, a power adapter for your car, USB charge cable, two game cases, and two...

975
01:07:44,488 --> 01:07:45,769
[SPEAKER_04]: to the stylus pens.

976
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:47,130
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty cool.

977
01:07:48,591 --> 01:07:57,458
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's going to be a percentage from the purchase of this that's going to go toward, like I said, the National Breast Cancer Foundation and retail for $19.99.

978
01:07:59,807 --> 01:08:01,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, good for gaming and fundraising colliding.

979
01:08:01,888 --> 01:08:02,849
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good thing.

980
01:08:03,469 --> 01:08:11,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Going back to the previous story in our chat room, chat.org.com, Ranma's pointing out you can get a 1 terabyte, that's 1,000 gigabytes, drive for $399.

981
01:08:11,574 --> 01:08:16,057
[SPEAKER_08]: And Sephiroth1215 says, yeah, I know someone who has a 1 terabyte drive.

982
01:08:16,397 --> 01:08:18,498
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you put on that?

983
01:08:18,538 --> 01:08:20,419
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's a lot of porn.

984
01:08:20,859 --> 01:08:21,700
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a lot.

985
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:23,501
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like weeks worth of porn.

986
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:25,622
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was looking to buy was a terabyte.

987
01:08:25,662 --> 01:08:26,583
[SPEAKER_04]: They sell them at Fry's.

988
01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:28,870
[SPEAKER_08]: HD porn even.

989
01:08:28,890 --> 01:08:32,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know how much HD porn you could fit on a terabyte drive?

990
01:08:34,294 --> 01:08:34,995
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot.

991
01:08:35,035 --> 01:08:36,816
[SPEAKER_04]: The terabyte drives are something like $300 to $400.

992
01:08:38,177 --> 01:08:39,238
[SPEAKER_04]: But iOmega makes one.

993
01:08:39,479 --> 01:08:41,720
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's 300 to 400 hours of porn.

994
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:42,541
[SPEAKER_08]: That's amazing.

995
01:08:42,561 --> 01:08:46,304
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is, though, downloading that amount of porn would take lots of time.

996
01:08:47,084 --> 01:08:52,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the whole reason I bought mine was because, and now that it's happened, I saw it coming.

997
01:08:53,349 --> 01:08:56,672
[SPEAKER_04]: My PC was dying, so I bought my hard drive to save all my crap.

998
01:08:58,197 --> 01:09:01,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Zappy24 in chat says, a terabyte isn't as much as it seems.

999
01:09:01,599 --> 01:09:02,399
[SPEAKER_08]: It fills fast.

1000
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:04,760
[SPEAKER_08]: So you know who's been downloading the HD porn.

1001
01:09:05,281 --> 01:09:06,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Just teasing.

1002
01:09:06,321 --> 01:09:06,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Just teasing.

1003
01:09:07,722 --> 01:09:18,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, what was taking up most of mine was I have entire seasons of Doctor Who and Stargate because, you know, I don't watch TV.

1004
01:09:18,327 --> 01:09:22,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is borderline porn for you because every time you see... I have a fangasm.

1005
01:09:22,549 --> 01:09:25,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, every time you see David Tennant, like, you get a

1006
01:09:26,167 --> 01:09:27,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Femboner or whatever they're called.

1007
01:09:29,009 --> 01:09:30,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, a fangasm.

1008
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:32,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a girlboner.

1009
01:09:32,811 --> 01:09:33,371
[SPEAKER_08]: A girlboner.

1010
01:09:34,392 --> 01:09:43,677
[SPEAKER_06]: So one thing that really shouldn't collide, but for some reason this year has been colliding more than I would like, would be baby-raising sims for the DS.

1011
01:09:44,157 --> 01:09:55,403
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet another one has come along, Crave Entertainment's Baby Pals, which should be coming out in November if I remember correctly, is a baby-washing, dressing, and patty-caking sim.

1012
01:09:56,308 --> 01:09:58,509
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically Nintendogs with babies.

1013
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:05,093
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to adopt a pet human, then feed it, bathe it, dress it in funny clothes.

1014
01:10:05,573 --> 01:10:11,136
[SPEAKER_06]: You can even teach it to walk, talk, though if you do... Was that the first thing?

1015
01:10:13,117 --> 01:10:14,838
[SPEAKER_06]: This is also from another article here.

1016
01:10:15,238 --> 01:10:19,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Their comment was, if you get them to do these things, they're probably saying, why the hell am I wearing these funny clothes?

1017
01:10:20,841 --> 01:10:20,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1018
01:10:22,069 --> 01:10:29,956
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing, though, they're asking in this article, which is kind of funny, is, so if you ignore your, you know, Nintendogs, you know, they run away and stuff.

1019
01:10:30,556 --> 01:10:31,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Do the babies run away?

1020
01:10:33,919 --> 01:10:35,981
[SPEAKER_06]: A baby's hitchhiking to Texas.

1021
01:10:36,881 --> 01:10:41,145
[SPEAKER_06]: If you ignore your baby, does virtual social services rep come and take them away?

1022
01:10:41,165 --> 01:10:41,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait!

1023
01:10:43,408 --> 01:10:47,951
[SPEAKER_08]: If you ignore your baby, then Child Protective Services comes and takes your baby away?

1024
01:10:48,032 --> 01:10:48,912
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was her joke.

1025
01:10:48,932 --> 01:10:49,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh.

1026
01:10:49,332 --> 01:10:50,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that's actually what's going to happen.

1027
01:10:50,593 --> 01:10:51,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my God.

1028
01:10:51,234 --> 01:10:51,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I wish.

1029
01:10:51,754 --> 01:10:53,995
[SPEAKER_04]: How would that be any different than the reality for some people?

1030
01:10:54,015 --> 01:10:56,917
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, if you're Britney Spears, you might be able to benefit from this game.

1031
01:10:56,937 --> 01:11:00,320
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the picture that they have on this Wired blog thing.

1032
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,221
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, Baby Spotted You.

1033
01:11:03,888 --> 01:11:04,749
[SPEAKER_06]: It's creepy looking.

1034
01:11:05,049 --> 01:11:08,971
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, Baby Pals will be coming out for the DS in November.

1035
01:11:09,312 --> 01:11:13,795
[SPEAKER_06]: In a big block of stuff that they have like all the pet series and sim raising shit.

1036
01:11:14,075 --> 01:11:18,458
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's Imagine Babies and Baby Pals so far and I'm pretty sure there's going to be another one.

1037
01:11:19,099 --> 01:11:23,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, Loki, I know you've said you and the wife are thinking about having a baby in the not-too-distant future, right?

1038
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:26,160
[SPEAKER_08]: So are you going to use this game as, like, a training?

1039
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,881
[SPEAKER_06]: I should make her play this.

1040
01:11:28,921 --> 01:11:30,381
[SPEAKER_08]: You should buy it for Nelly.

1041
01:11:30,781 --> 01:11:34,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't know where you're at on that one and have a baby thing.

1042
01:11:34,662 --> 01:11:42,263
[SPEAKER_08]: But if maybe you want to hold off a little bit, I say buy this game for Nelly and make sure that Child Protective Services doesn't take her Ninten baby away.

1043
01:11:42,283 --> 01:11:43,363
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to buy this.

1044
01:11:44,243 --> 01:11:48,264
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, this game poses the challenge of, like...

1045
01:11:49,341 --> 01:11:49,942
[SPEAKER_06]: The Sims.

1046
01:11:50,862 --> 01:11:56,388
[SPEAKER_06]: The Sims, you're supposed to make the family thrive and yada yada yada, but all I want to do in The Sims is try to kill them.

1047
01:11:57,168 --> 01:12:03,274
[SPEAKER_06]: So in Baby Pals, you know, it's like, how can I possibly abuse these Sim babies?

1048
01:12:03,394 --> 01:12:09,880
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, just like in Nintendogs, you can kind of like, I don't know, throw the frisbee at their head and stuff.

1049
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:12,082
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be fun.

1050
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:20,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Kiki just recently had a baby apparently and is saying, uh-huh, oh, she's born and sitting on my lap listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1051
01:12:20,516 --> 01:12:21,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Be careful.

1052
01:12:21,176 --> 01:12:22,857
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be minus points for the baby.

1053
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:28,020
[SPEAKER_08]: That may be one step closer to CPS coming down.

1054
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:28,721
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just kidding.

1055
01:12:29,181 --> 01:12:30,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations, though.

1056
01:12:30,122 --> 01:12:30,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously.

1057
01:12:31,622 --> 01:12:32,523
[SPEAKER_08]: New babies are fun.

1058
01:12:32,703 --> 01:12:34,904
[SPEAKER_08]: When they're real babies, they're good things.

1059
01:12:35,064 --> 01:12:39,207
[SPEAKER_08]: When they're sim babies, they're stupid.

1060
01:12:39,227 --> 01:12:41,048
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say I've met a good baby.

1061
01:12:42,133 --> 01:12:45,815
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend Becky, her baby, quiet, well-behaved.

1062
01:12:47,475 --> 01:12:53,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Ryoma says the baby's going to ask, Mommy, what's a girl boner?

1063
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:56,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1064
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:58,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, cool, Deakman.

1065
01:12:59,060 --> 01:12:59,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's Deakman.

1066
01:13:00,041 --> 01:13:02,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, it's Deakman's partner.

1067
01:13:02,522 --> 01:13:04,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Kiki's my girlfriend, and that's my baby.

1068
01:13:04,903 --> 01:13:05,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1069
01:13:05,503 --> 01:13:07,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the whole family's listening to OLR together.

1070
01:13:07,544 --> 01:13:09,284
[SPEAKER_08]: That's so... One, two, three.

1071
01:13:09,624 --> 01:13:10,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Aww.

1072
01:13:10,545 --> 01:13:10,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Aww.

1073
01:13:12,924 --> 01:13:13,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1074
01:13:15,947 --> 01:13:17,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Message to the baby, stop crying so much.

1075
01:13:18,589 --> 01:13:20,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Mommy and daddy value their sleep.

1076
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:21,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kidding.

1077
01:13:22,172 --> 01:13:23,893
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's move on with some news.

1078
01:13:24,714 --> 01:13:28,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on to a completely different field here, MMOs.

1079
01:13:28,544 --> 01:13:30,586
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, people love their MMOs.

1080
01:13:31,467 --> 01:13:34,189
[SPEAKER_08]: The World of Warcraft is still dominating as always.

1081
01:13:34,249 --> 01:13:36,991
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's some other MMOs you may not have heard about.

1082
01:13:37,892 --> 01:13:41,075
[SPEAKER_08]: RF Online is creating an MMO.

1083
01:13:41,656 --> 01:13:45,399
[SPEAKER_08]: And the MMO is called... I'm sorry, RF Online is the game.

1084
01:13:45,439 --> 01:13:48,221
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually being made by Codemasters.

1085
01:13:49,202 --> 01:13:52,265
[SPEAKER_08]: RF Online is now a free game.

1086
01:13:52,905 --> 01:13:54,707
[SPEAKER_08]: The game came out back in 2006.

1087
01:13:56,121 --> 01:13:56,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1088
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:27,468
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to check this game out, it looks, I don't know, I look at the screenshot, it looks a little bit like Phantasy Star-ish to me, because it looks like it's the real-time fighting, but I couldn't tell you, because I haven't played the game myself yet, but now that it's free, I might just have the incentive to do that.

1089
01:14:28,268 --> 01:14:29,068
[SPEAKER_08]: So, check that out.

1090
01:14:29,128 --> 01:14:32,390
[SPEAKER_08]: It's rf-onlinegame.com if you want more information.

1091
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:38,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have a little bit of information that will make lots and lots of people happy.

1092
01:14:39,052 --> 01:14:39,833
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me happy.

1093
01:14:40,673 --> 01:14:40,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

1094
01:14:41,397 --> 01:14:42,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Night's has a date.

1095
01:14:45,579 --> 01:14:49,980
[SPEAKER_04]: December 18th is going to be the release date for Night's Journey of Dreams.

1096
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:58,463
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the UK, well, actually, it just says Europe in general, will be January is when the release is, though there's not a specific date.

1097
01:15:00,984 --> 01:15:04,846
[SPEAKER_08]: So sorry, Night's fans, but no Christmas for you overseas.

1098
01:15:05,186 --> 01:15:08,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you watch the demo play for Night's?

1099
01:15:08,942 --> 01:15:10,743
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw some screens, but I didn't watch the demo.

1100
01:15:10,983 --> 01:15:13,864
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very, very, very cool.

1101
01:15:14,045 --> 01:15:16,226
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you're a big fan of Nights.

1102
01:15:16,446 --> 01:15:19,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you the one that told me Christmas Nights is one of your favorite games ever?

1103
01:15:19,607 --> 01:15:22,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we have a tradition in my house around Christmas.

1104
01:15:22,389 --> 01:15:24,550
[SPEAKER_04]: We break out the Saturn, make sure the battery works.

1105
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:28,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I lost all of my Symphony of the Night data.

1106
01:15:29,252 --> 01:15:29,972
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you were happy.

1107
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:32,834
[SPEAKER_04]: After I maxed out everything you can with Maria.

1108
01:15:33,094 --> 01:15:34,014
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you were very happy.

1109
01:15:34,295 --> 01:15:34,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.

1110
01:15:35,195 --> 01:15:36,876
[SPEAKER_04]: But we play Christmas Nights every year.

1111
01:15:38,349 --> 01:15:42,352
[SPEAKER_04]: We break out the Saturn in December and we play all the way through the dates.

1112
01:15:42,932 --> 01:15:48,657
[SPEAKER_04]: The closer you get to Christmas, I think it's really cool that they change textures in it.

1113
01:15:48,697 --> 01:15:49,657
[SPEAKER_04]: They change the music.

1114
01:15:49,958 --> 01:15:50,898
[SPEAKER_04]: It starts snowing.

1115
01:15:50,958 --> 01:15:53,420
[SPEAKER_04]: You get snow effects on the ground the closer you get to Christmas Day.

1116
01:15:54,861 --> 01:15:55,962
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really cool.

1117
01:15:57,784 --> 01:15:59,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they'll do something like that with this.

1118
01:15:59,945 --> 01:16:00,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they'll do that here.

1119
01:16:01,146 --> 01:16:01,627
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fun.

1120
01:16:01,647 --> 01:16:01,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

1121
01:16:03,516 --> 01:16:05,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, Texas

1122
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:29,390
[SPEAKER_06]: on December 7th.

1123
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:39,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Tickets go on sale on November 5th and are available on the Alamo Drafthouse's website or www.drafthouse.com.

1124
01:16:40,293 --> 01:16:44,335
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're in the area and want to go to the screen, be sure to pick up a ticket.

1125
01:16:44,575 --> 01:16:56,018
[SPEAKER_06]: In attendance will be, let's see here, Fred Savage, Director Todd Holland, and let's see, Luke Edwards also will be there.

1126
01:16:57,602 --> 01:17:04,767
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the Power Glove.

1127
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:07,629
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so bad.

1128
01:17:10,311 --> 01:17:13,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, uh, just keep your Power Gloves off her, pal, huh?

1129
01:17:15,995 --> 01:17:17,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is it that America loves the Wizard?

1130
01:17:18,716 --> 01:17:19,417
[SPEAKER_03]: He grew up cute.

1131
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:21,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Fred Savage?

1132
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:26,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, didn't you see... He still has the same face.

1133
01:17:26,782 --> 01:17:30,744
[SPEAKER_08]: He had a sitcom on NBC a while ago, too.

1134
01:17:34,545 --> 01:17:37,766
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it about The Wizard that people still love to this day?

1135
01:17:38,927 --> 01:17:40,127
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just The Wizard.

1136
01:17:40,871 --> 01:17:41,672
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't know.

1137
01:17:59,711 --> 01:18:02,392
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish they were doing this in more places than just Austin.

1138
01:18:23,556 --> 01:18:30,081
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if they can do midnight showings of Showgirls, surely, surely they could put The Wizard in San Francisco for one night and people would come out.

1139
01:18:30,101 --> 01:18:31,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you imagine having a shadow cast for The Wizard?

1140
01:18:32,163 --> 01:18:33,204
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even want to think about it.

1141
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:34,185
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1142
01:18:35,366 --> 01:18:37,047
[SPEAKER_04]: There's other movies I would rather see that done, too.

1143
01:18:38,628 --> 01:18:43,272
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw says, people love The Wizard because it's filled with so much Nintendo propaganda.

1144
01:18:43,953 --> 01:18:46,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Rama in chat says, The Wizard ranks right up there with UHF.

1145
01:18:46,975 --> 01:18:47,896
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a cult classic.

1146
01:18:48,877 --> 01:18:50,398
[SPEAKER_04]: UHF is what I was proposed to over.

1147
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:53,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Ramma said also, it's a cult classic.

1148
01:18:54,212 --> 01:18:56,495
[SPEAKER_08]: It's when they revealed Super Mario Bros.

1149
01:18:56,935 --> 01:18:56,495
3.

1150
01:18:56,975 --> 01:18:59,077
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think a lot of us remember that from our childhood.

1151
01:18:59,117 --> 01:19:01,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, a lot of us went to go see the movie just to freaking see Mario 3.

1152
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:03,862
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of the reasons, yeah, that I went and saw it.

1153
01:19:03,882 --> 01:19:04,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Me too.

1154
01:19:05,043 --> 01:19:05,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1155
01:19:06,084 --> 01:19:06,764
[SPEAKER_08]: That's hardcore.

1156
01:19:06,804 --> 01:19:09,607
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm providing a shopping service for our listeners in the chat room.

1157
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:10,548
[SPEAKER_08]: What shopping service?

1158
01:19:10,568 --> 01:19:11,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Shopping service?

1159
01:19:11,349 --> 01:19:13,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, people saying, I want a Saturn.

1160
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:14,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, you want a Saturn?

1161
01:19:14,111 --> 01:19:15,212
[SPEAKER_04]: You can buy one off eBay.

1162
01:19:15,232 --> 01:19:15,733
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some eBay...

1163
01:19:16,836 --> 01:19:19,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Use your hard-earned money to buy something off eBay right now.

1164
01:19:19,719 --> 01:19:20,719
[SPEAKER_06]: I have two Saturns.

1165
01:19:20,739 --> 01:19:23,081
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want something bad enough, you'll make it happen.

1166
01:19:23,121 --> 01:19:28,005
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a Saturn that I'm willing to get rid of because it has no controllers and no cords or anything.

1167
01:19:28,045 --> 01:19:28,566
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take it.

1168
01:19:28,646 --> 01:19:30,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a bajillion controllers and cords.

1169
01:19:30,747 --> 01:19:30,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1170
01:19:30,987 --> 01:19:32,389
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be three Saturns in my house.

1171
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:34,830
[SPEAKER_08]: I need a Saturn.

1172
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:37,433
[SPEAKER_08]: I've barely played any Saturn games in my life.

1173
01:19:37,453 --> 01:19:39,034
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I need to play on a Saturn.

1174
01:19:39,434 --> 01:19:40,115
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have that.

1175
01:19:40,515 --> 01:19:41,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Stahl is awesome.

1176
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:42,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to just borrow an extra set of...

1177
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,536
[SPEAKER_01]: controllers, of course.

1178
01:19:44,716 --> 01:19:46,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I have my first Saturn.

1179
01:19:46,397 --> 01:19:47,597
[SPEAKER_06]: It has all the stuff for it.

1180
01:19:48,038 --> 01:19:49,499
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't have the second one.

1181
01:19:49,539 --> 01:19:58,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I went to Denio's, a local flea market over here, and the first one I saw was the Saturn without anything because the guy was selling it for like $20.

1182
01:19:58,604 --> 01:19:59,965
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, okay, I'll take it.

1183
01:20:00,125 --> 01:20:01,106
[SPEAKER_04]: You went to Trader Dan's, right?

1184
01:20:01,626 --> 01:20:05,168
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember, but then I went somewhere else and I found a Saturn with everything.

1185
01:20:05,208 --> 01:20:08,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, okay, well, I'll just have a spare one in case it parts or something.

1186
01:20:08,150 --> 01:20:08,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1187
01:20:09,111 --> 01:20:10,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, you have to replace your battery every month.

1188
01:20:11,906 --> 01:20:19,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, well now we're getting all nostalgic and what better time than to bring out DarkSakura's classic game of the week.

1189
01:20:19,532 --> 01:20:31,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's right, part A is coming to an end and this is the part of the show where we like to let DarkSakura reminisce a little bit about games you may have missed and I honestly think damn near everyone missed this game DarkSakura is going to do this week.

1190
01:20:32,201 --> 01:20:38,466
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of excited to hear a little more about it so I will stop the suspense, cue the music and let DarkSakura take it away.

1191
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:54,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Today's classic game slash obscure slash whatever game I pick of the week is Magical Fantasy Adventure Popful Mail.

1192
01:20:55,563 --> 01:20:56,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, that's a mouthful.

1193
01:20:56,784 --> 01:20:57,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1194
01:20:57,985 --> 01:21:04,371
[SPEAKER_04]: It was released originally on the PC-98 and PC-88 system in Japan.

1195
01:21:05,492 --> 01:21:08,815
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's sort of like Ys.

1196
01:21:09,915 --> 01:21:11,716
[SPEAKER_04]: You side-scroll adventure.

1197
01:21:11,736 --> 01:21:12,776
[SPEAKER_04]: It has RPG elements.

1198
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:14,037
[SPEAKER_04]: You can change out your weapons.

1199
01:21:14,057 --> 01:21:19,060
[SPEAKER_04]: You can change out your items and talk to people and all the stuff.

1200
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:27,424
[SPEAKER_04]: It was released in Japan afterwards on Super Famicom, on PC Engine CD, and on the Mega CD.

1201
01:21:27,944 --> 01:21:31,906
[SPEAKER_04]: And over here, we actually got the Sega CD version thanks to Working Delays.

1202
01:21:32,006 --> 01:21:32,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Working Designs.

1203
01:21:34,207 --> 01:21:38,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Working Designs are also the lovely people that brought Silhouette Mirage, the...

1204
01:21:40,624 --> 01:21:43,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Growlancer series, Lunar.

1205
01:21:44,367 --> 01:21:47,129
[SPEAKER_04]: They were very, very good to us.

1206
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:54,795
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this game you were playing a little busty elven girl called Popple, no, called Mail.

1207
01:21:55,775 --> 01:22:03,261
[SPEAKER_04]: And you play as her friends and you go around trying to, you know, save things.

1208
01:22:03,321 --> 01:22:06,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Her friend the sorcerer Tat and the little dragon guy named Gaul.

1209
01:22:07,484 --> 01:22:09,666
[SPEAKER_04]: And you fight bad guys called Nutscracker.

1210
01:22:10,638 --> 01:22:11,579
[SPEAKER_04]: and Muttonhead.

1211
01:22:12,379 --> 01:22:13,780
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a guy named Nutzcracker.

1212
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:14,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Nutzcracker.

1213
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,561
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I like this guy.

1214
01:22:17,522 --> 01:22:22,705
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a pretty... Who's this that Mail's talking to right now in our little clip we're playing in the background?

1215
01:22:22,765 --> 01:22:26,106
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just like the very start of the game.

1216
01:22:26,126 --> 01:22:28,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone who's just going to help out.

1217
01:22:29,308 --> 01:22:31,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Say, why do you take me with you?

1218
01:22:31,589 --> 01:22:33,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you have lots of adventures.

1219
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:37,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Why else would you have such a huge... I love the huge anime eyes and smile.

1220
01:22:37,492 --> 01:22:38,313
[SPEAKER_08]: It's you?

1221
01:22:38,946 --> 01:22:41,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so hungry, I can eat an okra!

1222
01:22:41,167 --> 01:22:43,988
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it sounds like.

1223
01:22:44,548 --> 01:22:48,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the old CD games never had good music with them.

1224
01:22:48,689 --> 01:22:49,990
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, good voice acting.

1225
01:22:50,010 --> 01:22:51,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Music was really good.

1226
01:22:51,390 --> 01:22:53,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, the voice acting wasn't really too bad.

1227
01:22:53,171 --> 01:22:55,031
[SPEAKER_04]: They at least tried.

1228
01:22:55,051 --> 01:23:01,573
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem I had with working designs is that they would put stuff into the game that just was not there and usually kind of crass humor.

1229
01:23:02,233 --> 01:23:03,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Like with Rayearth.

1230
01:23:04,534 --> 01:23:07,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, they actually made improvements when they brought out Rayearth on Saturn.

1231
01:23:08,274 --> 01:23:18,721
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, like, they took out the fact that they speak dialogue every time you touch an item, which cut down on the, uh, it had intense loading time on the game.

1232
01:23:19,301 --> 01:23:24,725
[SPEAKER_04]: But they put in all these jokes, like there was one about, you know, Harry Palms.

1233
01:23:24,825 --> 01:23:25,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

1234
01:23:25,566 --> 01:23:28,968
[SPEAKER_04]: But, this was a fun game.

1235
01:23:29,048 --> 01:23:30,089
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a lot of fun.

1236
01:23:30,869 --> 01:23:36,113
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, you know, it had the classic cutscenes and, you know, it's just very...

1237
01:23:37,372 --> 01:23:40,093
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, mid-90s game fun.

1238
01:23:40,133 --> 01:23:41,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's all I can say it is.

1239
01:23:41,714 --> 01:23:49,537
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually was surprised with my copy because I had played it back in the day when a friend of mine had imported it.

1240
01:23:50,977 --> 01:23:52,698
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, it got its U.S.

1241
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:56,379
[SPEAKER_04]: release, and I didn't have a Sega CD at the time, so I never actually got it.

1242
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:01,221
[SPEAKER_04]: And one day, Dan came home with this huge box for me to open at Christmas.

1243
01:24:01,761 --> 01:24:05,383
[SPEAKER_04]: And inside this huge box, it was supposed to be like a space heater.

1244
01:24:06,326 --> 01:24:07,828
[SPEAKER_04]: was my game at the bottom of the box.

1245
01:24:08,849 --> 01:24:09,289
[SPEAKER_08]: How funny.

1246
01:24:09,729 --> 01:24:12,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually own an original Popful Mail now.

1247
01:24:12,532 --> 01:24:12,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

1248
01:24:12,853 --> 01:24:18,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's a good game of the week because I bet a lot of people missed that one, but some folks in chat seem to recognize it and applaud that pick of the week.

1249
01:24:18,718 --> 01:24:21,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Popful Mail is your classic game of the week.

1250
01:24:22,066 --> 01:24:30,772
[SPEAKER_08]: And with that, Part A comes to a close, but fear not, we'll be back in just a little bit with Part B. So stay tuned, and thanks for downloading Orange Lounge Radio.
