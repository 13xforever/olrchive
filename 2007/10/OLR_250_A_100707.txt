Tonight, October 7th, 2007, Bungie and Microsoft file for divorce, World of Warcraft celebrates alcohol, and Nintendo gives something away to all Wii owners.
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that program on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
I'm starting Oktoberfest early.
Are you?
Yes I am, with British ale.
Enjoy.
What are you drinking tonight?
Newcastle.
Yummy.
Best ever.
Also joining us tonight, say hello to Loki.
I'm drinking watered down coke from McDonald's.
You sure know how to party.
I'm very disappointed in your German-ness.
Their fries sucked.
And also say hello, joining us tonight, this somebody has not been on our program in a damn long time, but he's here tonight.
Say hello to Black Lab, a.k.a.
Puppy.
I made it out of Davis alive, thank God.
Yes, you used to be our correspondent for the People's Republic of Davis, which if you live where our show is taped, Sacramento, you understand why that joke is funny.
But if you're an international or national listener, you have no clue what we're talking about.
But just trust us, it's funny.
But you're free from the perils of Davis now.
Yes, I am.
And you're living on your own.
Yes, actually.
They've let you out of the prisoner camp.
So rule number one of living on your own, make sure the mic is real close to your mouth because you're not very sensitive.
Okay.
Just don't eat it.
So what have you been up to since you've been on the show last?
How long has it been?
It's been like at least a year now.
Aren't we in double digits?
I think so, first time he was here.
Well, Puppy, you used to work in an arcade, and that's one thing you used to kind of come on the show and talk to us about.
What arcade did you used to work at a long time ago?
Castro Valley Golf Land.
And what kinds of big popular machines were there at Castro Valley Golf Land?
Oh, I think
One of them dancing machines, I think.
Oh, the dance game?
Oh, they had Time Crisis 3.
That was pretty popular.
That all the dancing fools played?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think I was one of them.
All right.
So would you say that the skills that you learned working in an arcade have helped you in the real world?
No.
No.
You didn't learn anything there, huh?
Not a damn thing.
Except that I hate kids.
It was one step above flipping burgers, yes?
Yes.
I still had to serve pizza on weekends for parties.
Or in retrospect, would you rather have been frying french fries incorrectly at McDonald's?
I would know how to fry something at McDonald's because I would actually understand the instructional videos.
There was one time that people got pissed off at McDonald's because I was sitting in the middle of the lobby with a chair that I pulled out from a table.
and sitting there talking because my friends are all talking and just sitting there and talking or basically standing there and talking and I got tired to stand there so I pulled over a chair and sat down next to everybody and then the manager comes over and he's like what the fuck is that chair doing in the middle of this lobby?
Meanwhile, I mean, it's like they're like almost closed anyways and there's no one there.
Is that how they really talk?
What a bunch of potty mouths.
Well, he was a stoner so...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Hey, we're going to pizza your face.
I don't know.
I got to operate a large knife.
Really, no, I didn't go around going, hey, we're part of the Roundtable gang.
No, we worked at Roundtable.
We're a commune of Roundtable people.
Well, folks, you'll notice there's two empty chairs back here if you're watching on our Operator 11 live webcam or our archive.
There's two empty chairs back here.
That's because Rice Princess and Casper the Gay or whatever his name is are joining us tonight, but they're late.
Target, Target, Target
I don't need a table because there would be no room for a table in here.
Thanks for the beer.
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio.
No, not that.
That'll have to be an edit.
DarkSakura
I'm gonna go sit in the chairs, because I feel bad that the Op 11 people are looking at nothing.
So I'll sit in the chairs.
I'm looking at my laptop, apparently.
Alright.
So, this week, I played a shit ton of Ragnarok.
And I'm not talking about my regular, you know, buttload.
I'm talking about a shit ton of Ragnarok.
So it's like a shit ton, is that like metric?
It's metric.
Or if I was going to go with the Don French description, it would be crock shits of Ragnarok.
Or like shit kilo, you know.
So, um, I have been, I decided to start a new class.
I started it last night.
It's called the Taekwon Girl.
And, um, you don't get weapons, you just kick things in the face.
You just kick them in the face.
Can we get a live demonstration?
Puppy, lie down.
No.
I don't think so.
And then I, um, I started the character last night, and I'm playing today.
Got her up to a Star Gladiator, which was actually kind of a really weird game earlier.
So I now have her at level 70, and I started her yesterday.
Last night.
Go Pirate Servers!
Awesome job.
And I don't have to work tomorrow, so I'm going to play more games tomorrow.
Good job.
Well, sounds good.
Well, let's keep right on moving along.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
My gaming week was fun.
I've been continuing playing Halo on Legendary.
Finally got past the part that I was stuck because I realized, hey, I can go backtrack and there's a ton of weapons back there.
Holy shit, forgot all about that stuff.
And so you can play with the AI because they won't go past a certain part.
They'll chase after you and stuff and be like, ha, I'm in the safe zone or some shit.
You can't attack me and they'll run back.
It's funny.
The AI is kind of dumb.
Have you done the confetti head thing?
No, I'm playing through just by myself.
DarkSakura's husband showed me the headshot confetti thing.
That is hilarious.
It makes, like, you shoot off the thing and it makes this little, I think we have the exact same noise in our audio library.
It has these little kids cheering when you do it.
I'm looking for the... Keep going.
I'll imitate them anyways.
So, other stuff I've been playing.
I actually bought... What was it?
Flat Out Ultimate Carnage.
That game is fucking awesome.
It's just lots of driving, crashing into things.
I played the Ragdoll Olympics stuff for quite a while, so I was launching my character through windshields and flinging them down a ski slope.
Stuff like that.
Real fun game, though.
And...
Food Network is great.
And how is Halo going?
You a big fan of the Halo?
Yeah, I am, sadly.
I'm still confused by some things in the plot, and other than that, I just shoot things.
And I like the little grunt head explosions.
Yes, I found the sound effect.
So when you shoot them in the head, you get this.
It makes that little sound effect.
A little confetti blows up everywhere.
It's awesome.
It's fun when you turn up the explosions on that, too, so that when you shoot one in the head, all the ones around them go off, too, and explode.
Dan was going around punching people in the head with a skull.
Good times.
That was pretty cool.
Good times.
So that's it for your gaming week?
Yeah, pretty much.
I was playing WoW for a while, but ever since Halo 3 came out, I pretty much stopped.
All right.
Well, finally joining us, they're a little bit late tonight, so you guys are so fired, but they're here in studio.
Say hello to Rice Princess, and what are we calling you now, Casper?
Casper the Game.
All right, I can never remember.
He's Eddie to me.
He'll always be Eddie.
All right.
So Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?
What have you been playing?
Wow.
Does it ever change, really?
I mean, that's pretty much it.
Hey, you have my sweater.
I'm so glad.
Yes, you left your sweater here.
My Alliance sweater.
What's hilarious is that the only way we knew who it belonged to is that we saw that it was an Alliance sweatshirt that you left here, and we were like, who the fuck plays Alliance?
Yeah.
Only cool people do.
And we were like, oh, it must be Rice Princess.
So please take this thing out of my house.
I have an Alliance character, at least she's sort of evil.
The only reason worth playing Alliance is for the J'nai.
But it gets old.
Whatever.
And if you want to play with 12-year-olds.
You can play a Warlock.
And if you want to play a cool side.
You can play Warlocks on Horde's side.
They're much cooler.
Warlocks are much better.
Warlocks are lame.
You're lame.
Anyway, before we turn into the WoWcast, is there anything else you want to share for your gaming week?
No.
Alright, then Casper, how was your gaming week?
It was awesome.
I got Phantom Hourglass, the new Zelda game for DS.
It was really good.
Yeah, it's really good.
Finally, they get to not make you fumble between the D-pad and the buttons and the stylus all at the same time.
It's all stylus and it's very smooth.
It's a very cool control style.
So tell me a little more about it, because I'm contemplating if I want to buy it or not.
So how does it play compared to the other Zeldas?
Is it more Wind Waker?
Is it more Super Nintendo Zelda?
Well, it's a direct sequel to Wind Waker.
It takes place right after the end of Wind Waker.
Same style.
It's like that cel shading.
A little downplayed for the DS, but it still looks pretty good.
And, you know, just really cool.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
All right.
And GS68 in our chat room is screaming, no spoilers.
So please, no spoilers.
I'm not that far, so I really can't spoil anything.
No spoilers until Eris gets it.
So go ahead and spoil.
I don't care.
Link dies.
Yeah, Link dies at the end.
All right.
Anyhow, my gaming week.
I've also been playing World of Warcraft.
I got to level 68, so I have a flying mount now.
I am a flying mount because I play a druid.
Oh, you so?
Yeah, so I get a free flying mount.
Or if it's not free, it costs me eight gold.
Woo-hoo!
Anyhow.
And I ran instances.
As a guild, we ran under Bog and Slave pens.
And that's how I leveled.
I feel like this week's episode of the Sarah Silverman program, all of a sudden, where they're playing D&D for 24 hours straight.
I've done that.
You're the hardcore-est of the nerds.
You're queen of the nerd people.
She's just a princess.
You're the queen.
Uh, let's see.
So, also my gaming week, I played Tetris Splash.
I actually bought the new Tetris Splash, which was the Xbox Live Arcade game of the week.
And Tetris Splash is okay.
I mean, it's Tetris, and it has its competitive mode, which plays really smoothly on Xbox Live, I gotta say.
And it seems like the audience of people playing the game, not a lot of jerks, which is good.
You get some pretty good people.
And some people who are really skilled at Tetris.
I got my butt whooped in a ranked match by some people who are really good at Tetris, and I'm not so good at Tetris.
Tetris is fun.
They have that on DS, and it was like, it's crazy.
I'm like, Tetris, oh, but it's fun.
Here's why Tetris Splash pissed me off, though, is it just made the fact that I actually bought Tetris Evolution even more salt in the wound.
Because that game was like $30 on Xbox 360, and I never used this $10 version.
I'm so mad.
Like, why did they do that?
Why?
They didn't even wait, like, six months.
Tetris Evolution came out, like, three months ago, and now we have an even, a slightly, I don't know if you'd say better version.
I think it is kind of a better version.
It doesn't have the HD videos.
It has that stupid aquarium.
It looks like a, it looks like a screensaver from After Dark.
But, here's the thing that pissed me off about that is, have you heard about the microtransactions with this?
No.
The day they released Tetris,
The day they released Tetris Splash on Xbox Live Arcade, they released 15 different download packs for Tetris Splash.
No, maybe it's like 11.
But it's more than 10.
Between 80 and 150 points per download.
And you know what these things are?
They're just new fish for your tank.
Or new tanks to put the fish in.
Now let me ask you, do you play Tetris to stare at the background?
No.
So what's the point of downloading fish and fish tanks?
Then don't buy it.
There's a sucker born every second.
How about this?
It's either that or they could have made the game more expensive and threw them in there for free, which I think would have been a better move to make the money.
I think a better move would have been...
What they were starting to do, which is you unlock more fish as you unlock more achievements, or you get lines in the game.
You and your logic and your critical thinking.
I mean, I could not believe that.
If you buy this stuff, you're a sucker.
You're an absolute sucker.
If you buy this stuff, I got some Guitar Hero download packs for you.
I love Tetris, which is why this makes me mad.
I feel like Tetris on the 360 is fucked beyond belief between this whole evolution and now microtransaction fish tank thing.
By the way, Rob, I hate the word microtransaction.
Well, that's what it is.
A transaction is a transaction no matter how big or small.
Well, that's what they call it.
Why don't you write a letter to EA and all those people?
I have the same problem with pre-boarding because you're not really pre-boarding, you're just boarding.
Early.
Why you gotta derail my segment, huh?
Well, technically, a microtransaction is an accurate description.
It's a transaction that is small, hence micro.
So if I were a Jolly Rancher for five cents, would that be a microtransaction?
Yes, it would be a microtransaction.
That would.
What defines micro or macro?
This is a suck transaction, because if you buy this, you suck.
If I buy a computer, is it a microtransaction?
If you support this, you suck.
A microtransaction would be, for example...
Let's say Oblivion.
When you buy the retail copy of Oblivion, that would be a macro transaction.
When you buy add-on content that is cheaper than the purchase of the game, that is a micro transaction.
See, I would think that buying the system would be the macro transaction.
I cannot believe we're having an argument.
Buying the game would be a neutral transaction.
Round two.
Fight!
This is the semantics webcast.
GS68 in our chatroom says, Buying a PS3 equals a macro transaction.
Suck Transaction
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't know, that's too much ego.
Like, once a year is acceptable, and we did that with our five-year anniversary show, but if we were to kind of, like, promote, hey, it's episode 250, everybody should congratulate us again.
That's like celebrating your anniversaries with your spouse or something every month or something.
It's like, our 13-month anniversary!
Yeah, awesome.
Exactly, that's what it is.
After a while, it's just like, eh, whatever.
So, yeah, this is just an eh, whatever episode of Orange Laundry.
But we do have some special stuff tonight.
We actually have Insanist is one of our correspondents in Seattle.
He's actually, since he lives in Seattle, he's at the World Cyber Games this weekend.
And he actually called us a little earlier today to say this.
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio.
This is Insanist reporting live from Seattle, Washington here Sunday, October 7th, 2007.
I'm calling to let you know that you missed out on some extraordinary goings on here at the World Cyber Games.
For those of you not familiar, the Olympics of video games.
There were people from 74 countries, 700 gamers playing 12 different games, ranging from Command & Conquer 3 all the way to a huge favorite, StarCraft.
Lots of huge upsets, which my partner in crime, DJ Tyrant, will get to you later about.
I'm telling you that this is something you don't ever want to miss.
It's one of a kind event
meeting people from all sorts of countries at the press event, at press tournaments, everything.
I actually, probably the funniest thing, any sort of tournament or competition I tried to enter, I lost to somebody from another country every single time.
But just being able to take in all the cultural aspects, but just being here as one, all as gamers, just having a good time,
was great.
Seeing people play rock bands from different countries, and yes, I did hear somebody from China try to sing Black Hole Sun, and it was kind of funny, but that's very mean, but it was a great, great event.
The next one is in Cologne, Germany, so any new European listeners that aren't on the radio, I recommend you take the trip out and go.
DJ Tyrant and I are actually thinking about going, so maybe we'll see you there.
But more
Excuse me, I'm walking about downtown Seattle as I do this.
But for Orange Lounge Radio, I'm Insanus.
To hear more about this, listen to our show, The Insanus Hour, featuring SPFU, every Thursday at 7.30 Pacific Time.
Until then, I'm Insanus.
Take care.
Thank you very much, Insanus, for your little report there from the World Cyber Games.
He was raving about it.
He was calling me literally every day about something that was going on.
He called me the other day.
He was like, hey, Rob, I got to play one of the other all-game shows in some press competition, and I beat them.
And I was like, go.
You sound like you're having a lot of fun.
Hopefully one of those games is Chromehounds because I stole that in my copy.
I think it was Madden.
I don't think he was actually playing all-games interactive.
I think he was playing one of the other shows there.
I want to say it was Game Addict Hotline.
Really, the real losers of Chromehounds would be anyone that bought the game, unfortunately.
Now, Loki, if I heard you right during the tape segment there, you were dissing World Cyber Games a little bit.
What's your issue?
I think it's stupid.
Why?
It's cool that, I guess, a bunch of people come together, but don't refer to it as the fucking Olympics or anything like that.
I mean, seriously.
To me, the World Cyber Games kind of reminds me of the professional gaming leagues and shit like that.
I fucking hate those.
I really do.
That's like trying to launch the fucking XFL.
I mean, it's retarded.
No one's going to want to watch you play games.
That's funny.
Don't broadcast it.
It's boring.
The XFL was actually kind of fun.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It was the most boring thing to watch.
Well, the problem was the way they put it together.
They picked up kids off the street and tried to make it all rad.
Well, the problem is, if they're going to do something like this, they need to design games that are meant for this type of gameplay or anything like that, like Unreal Tournament or something, where you could actually set it up, film it like you're doing an actual football or sporting event type of game.
Just...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
If you watch it on TV, you can turn it off.
It doesn't take much to go, you know, ooh, look at me, I'm fast at the reflexes, you know, who cares?
I mean, it doesn't take much to really build yourself up.
I know a lot of people that are fascinated with watching people play video games.
We've all got that friend that's like, hey, you want to play?
No, I'll just watch.
You know, it's like, okay.
And they're like having a good time watching you.
Like Rice Princess, she's always like, I'm going to watch you.
Spoilers.
That's like my roommate.
He doesn't really play video games, but he's always kind of like, hey, aren't you going to play Eternal Sonata again?
Like, I kind of want to know what happens.
Why'd you quit at Chapter 5?
I like doing cooperative gaming.
Not like where both of you are actually playing the game, but like what Dan and I used to do.
Where, um...
He would, like, when we played Resident Evil, he would play through the game and I would go off the strategy guide or tell him where to go.
Aw, bonding time.
Yeah, but see, that's all storyline stuff.
You want to know what happens in the storyline and stuff like that.
That's a little different than saying, oh, I want to watch it because you're so lead at fucking Halo.
You know what I mean?
I don't, that's a little different.
It's not like... I was watching Halo for the storyline, but then it stopped making sense.
I mean, seriously, it's different.
Is there even a storyline?
Yeah.
You're tuning in for, like, the story and not for the actual gameplay.
Like, I don't know why Halo 3 bothered with the story, for real, because, like, I was playing co-op mode the other day, and, like, you know, we're walking through and what have you, and we're shooting aliens, we're having a fun time.
I'll tell you what, Halo 3 co-op mode is awesome.
We're going through, and then suddenly Cortana's like, find me, you gotta find me.
I'm like, bitch, get off the screen!
I'm trying to kill things!
Wow, you got like so straight for a second there, that was like scary.
And here's the funny thing about that, Rob, since I haven't played any of the other games, I don't understand the significance of finding her in the first place.
I'm like, it's just a fucking computer, just let it go, come on, seriously.
I thought she got exploded.
By a new chick, I mean, seriously.
I don't know.
See, I lost a little something for not playing the other games, but I digress.
Alright, so anyway, wow.
Really quickly though, people, what about the calls where people are like, I want to see DDR in the Olympics?
No!
You are stupid!
Hold on, hold on.
What about this as an outlet for those people that want to see that?
I mean, there are people that want to do gaming as a competitive sport, and people that feel that, you know, why should gaming be any different from other sports that are outdoors?
You know what?
If you want to have gaming as a competitive sport, just do PvP mode on Ragnarok.
End of story.
Congratulations, everybody.
DarkSakura has leveled down the show.
Good job.
Hard times.
Yes.
Oh, I got the finger.
Why don't you put that finger up so the Op-11 people can see it on the cam.
There you go.
All right.
Going to the chat room, because, God, we haven't been paying attention to chat.
I'm so sorry, folks.
Chat.orangeandredo.com.
Macman baby kicker.
I don't know.
Why would you kick babies?
Okay, Shane.
Why?
Macman says Cortana is significantly less hot in Halo 3, so therefore she doesn't deserve to be saved, apparently.
She wasn't hot in the first Halo.
It's not real!
No!
DDRDollarBill says, no DDR in the Olympics.
I found that ironic.
If she was a real chick or something, it might make more sense that you're trying to save her, but she's a fucking computer program.
Make a copy!
Hey, don't copy that floppy.
Tigerclaw says, video games are becoming a spectator sport.
SonofDad says, didn't they broadcast some of the fighting game championships recently in Japan?
See, that's Japan.
They put weird shit on their TV.
And you know what, though?
I respect them for that, because there's some cool shit on there.
If only they'd fucking fill G4 full of all that cool shit in Japan, I might be willing to watch that channel.
They try, but they fail.
Anyways, so, yeah, I mean, okay.
DarkShy brings up a good point.
Yes, please.
I've seen King of Kong.
It's very interesting.
Yeah, DarkShy says they had a movie called King of Kong, by the way.
Yeah.
Well, it was about the...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and it was this big drama.
Actually, I would suggest to everybody watch through King of Kong.
Well, see, now, that's a good example because people got really into that.
Now, I haven't seen the movie yet, but from what I've heard, people really get into it and are like rooting for one guy over the other guy.
You know, what about that for your whole argument where people don't want to... It's like Tommy.
Now, to E. Kim in the chat room, the DDR show did not count.
Hold on, you've got to read what they said before you respond to it.
Hello, Radio 101.
Ecom in the chat says, what did he say?
No, I lost it.
Oh, yes.
Do I need to remind you of that crap DDR show on TV?
To which you say, it doesn't count.
Why not?
Because at first it was called Dance Revolution, and all it was was just fucking Mickey Mouse Club ripoff with the slumber party girls.
Where are they now?
Oh, that's right.
No one's listening to them.
Aw, how sad.
So sad.
Yet another girl group gone.
Aw.
All right.
Anyhow, other housekeeping real quick.
I've got to say this.
Remember how last week we got a lot of phone calls on Digital Life?
I even had to hang up on one caller over drama and all that stuff.
Well, SSJ, Matt, one of our listeners, was kind enough to send us a care package from Digital Life.
So we got stuff from Digital Life.
Yeah, we have this little squeeze brain.
I have like 50 of those.
Well, then Eddie seemed to be interested in that.
So there you go, Eddie.
Let's see what we have here.
We have a seven-day free trial of Lord of the Rings Online.
You want that?
I don't have an Xbox.
I don't think it works.
I have my battery.
Non-working flashlight.
Hello.
Look at this.
All these V-Rares for DDR Universe.
I'll take one.
Wait, is that the original universe or second one?
No, it's the original universe.
DDR Universe.
I'll take one anyways.
I think I might have one, but I'd take one anyway.
Well, here you go.
And there you go.
This is exciting radio.
Look at this.
Party gift for us.
I was going to joke.
And here they are.
Now this I might keep and give away at some point because this is old.
This is a DDR Max sampler from Toys R Us.
I don't think they even make these anymore.
So we'll hang on to that.
Did you want a universe sampler, puppy?
All right, there you go.
Everybody wins here at Orange Launch Radio.
I got a brain.
Let's see.
What else do we have here?
Oh, Loki's gonna love this.
No, there's no money.
Look at this.
Here it is.
Authentic Eye of Judgment cards.
Look at this.
This is a card for the Biolith Bomber from the Eye of Judgment.
Check that shit out right there.
It even says right on the back, the Eye of Judgment.
Wait, wait, wait.
What?
I'm gonna make a copy of this.
Alright, you do that.
Oh my god!
That would be so impossible to copy.
Oh wait, no it won't be.
A little doggy keychain there from Sirius Satellite Radio.
A puppy should have that.
Yeah, it is a puppy.
So a puppy gets the puppy keychain.
There you go.
And let's see.
Oh, some post-it notes from Newegg.
Who wants post-it notes from Newegg?
DarkSakura does.
Posties.
There you go.
And, oh, I like this.
What is this?
This is a little, what is this, an iPod mini skin?
I don't know what this is.
I can't tell.
Is it an eraser?
What is it?
It looks like an eraser.
Okay.
And last but not least, last but not least, a lollipop with a ghost on it from Pac-Man.
There you go.
Oh, that's adorable.
Don't anybody eat that.
We'll just keep it forever and ever.
It's our new mascot.
There you go.
It is, totally.
Thank you, SSJ100Map, for the fabulous gifts and prizes.
Appreciate it.
Thank you.
There is no way that these things will not be able to, you know,
I think it's an advertisement for one other company that makes iPod skins called Jealous Skins but they didn't actually put a real one on there.
It's just a piece of plastic that looks like an iPod with a fake one around it and something on the back that says take this to the booth and get two for one or something.
Well somebody forgot to take it to the booth so we get it now here in studio.
Thank you for the prizes from Digital Life.
We appreciate it.
I think I'm going to peel this off.
All right.
What are you?
Oh, all right.
Anyway.
I guess that's it for housekeeping tonight.
Finally.
I think we're only about 35 minutes into tonight's show.
We can finally get into some gaming news.
All right.
We're starting with Ding.
Anyways, so there is some interesting rumors going around about a brand new Wii SKU and everyone's all like, oh my god, what is this?
It's DVD or something?
It's going to be playing?
No, don't get excited.
It's really nothing, actually.
The brand new UPC or new pack, as it's being dubbed, all it really is, and I've seen this happen on a few different consoles...
It's just them changing the box art.
Basically, you know, those launch games, they're a little old and dusty right now.
Time to put the new shit on there, you know, to get people excited.
That's all it is.
Ooh, box art!
Oh my god!
Because they did the exact same thing in September with the PS2 Slim.
They did the same thing with the PSP, the fat system, back in like June.
And it's... It happens all the time.
So just...
Don't get excited.
Calm down.
If you're getting excited, you're like, oh my god, they're finally going to release the pink Wii.
You're like, get over it.
Trust me, they're not releasing any more colors because they're still not having trouble selling the original system.
They can't make enough.
When it starts to slow down and people stop buying them, that's when the new colors will come.
That's like a GameStop, like if you buy a new DS, they're giving away a Zelda frame that's made of cardboard.
And I'm like, I have a DS.
And he's like, but it's super rare.
And I'm like, so are the $120 to buy a new DS.
I mean, it's like, good times.
Not really.
You wanted to punch him, didn't you?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura actually got the thing off of the iPod.
Now it's just a piece of plastic.
I didn't get anything.
I'm mixing up the fake radio names, sorry.
I think this is like duct tape.
It's printed duct tape.
This is wonderful radio, you taking apart one of our three little things.
Awesome sounds there, doing that.
Well, hey, you know, since, Eddie, you're very sad that you can't get anything free from buying Zelda, you can get this as a Wii owner.
Nintendo is now giving away a Wii Remote Jacket.
That's right, this week Nintendo put out a press release that now there's this new sleeve that's coming out for the Wiimotes.
And let me start off by saying it's really ugly.
You know what's better?
Because Nerf did the same thing, and Nerf actually looks cool.
It basically makes your Wiimote look like an Egyptian mummy.
I don't know, I'd say it looks more like they're trying to... Except they didn't have plastic in ancient Egypt, Rob.
They're trying to retard-proof the controller.
Yeah, basically this is so that when you accidentally throw it at your TV because you're an idiot, it will bounce.
Or somebody else is like, so you don't hit people in the head with it.
I'm like, what? !
Well, I noticed all the padding's on the front of it, so obviously it's for projectiles flying against stuff.
Wow, you'll wee your eye out.
These are going to be shipped with all new Wii consoles, Wii remotes, and of course copies of Wii Play, because the Wiimotes come with them, starting October 2nd.
And so that means they should be on shelves by October 15th.
Well, maybe that's what the new SKU is then, since it was for October 2nd.
You can go to Nintendo.com too and get your own free one.
And then maybe that's the new box art is on the box that says, Now with free Egyptian tombs.
No, here's going to be the best part, though, about it.
If it does ship with the Wii console and stuff like that, who's to say someone actually is going to put it on their Wii remote?
Little shot there of Tootin' Common playing Wii Tennis.
And you know what?
That pretty much killed the market for those stupid Wii gloves now.
Son of Dad wants to know, do the Wii condoms have lubricant on them?
Yes.
No, but they are ribbed for her pleasure.
Have these Wiimotes inspired some type of new sick fetish?
That's disgusting.
What's wrong with you people?
Neoprenism Make sure to ask for them to be ribbed for her pleasure I want them ribbed for my pleasure, please
Hold on a minute here.
Can somebody go grab my Wii so I can get that serial number off it?
I don't know if anybody's actually going to answer.
Thank you for calling Nintendo's Wii Remote Jacket Accessory Offer Line.
For assistance in English, press 1.
Thank you for calling Nintendo's Wii Remote Jacket Accessory Offer Line.
For assistance in English, press 1.
Where's my number pad?
Where's my keypad?
There we go.
Thank you for calling Nintendo Consumer Services.
This is ***.
How may I help you?
Yeah, I wanted to order the Wiimote jackets for my Wii.
Did you already go online and try, or is this your first attempt?
This is my first attempt.
It said I could call the number.
I was just checking because we have quite a few people who tried online and had some difficulties.
That's why I was... Ah, forget it.
I'm not going to bother with her.
That's so mean.
Just go put this back.
I mean, was she just going to belittle me?
Well, sir, I... I'm kind of like the stupid type, so... What's wrong with you, fool?
What's wrong with you, moron?
Why don't you go on the website?
At least we know it works, though.
The whole chat room.
Let's see.
Drew Nami says, don't fucking disrespect the call center rep.
I'm not.
Okay.
You know what, Rob?
What?
I worked in a call center for five years.
Yes.
Yeah.
What's the point if you tried online or not?
Did you try online?
Because really, I don't want to help you right now.
If you could just try online, that would make my life a whole lot easier.
So I wouldn't have to do my job.
I often do stuff like that because when you work in a call center, you usually have a time limit on how long you can take a call or else you get written up.
All right.
Wonder.Carol said that call center rep was actually nice.
She was, but she was told... Well, she gave you an explanation.
They probably make her ask that.
It was scripted.
You can tell what scripting sounds like.
Yeah.
All right.
All right, let's just move on with the show already.
First of all, Rob, never give me kettle corn again.
It's got cocaine in it.
So anyway...
Virtual Console for the UK.
If anyone's interested.
And the first one makes me just totally go WTF.
Even though I actually own the original of this game.
Fatal Fury for Neo Geo.
900 Wii Points.
Translates to 9 euro, 675 pound.
Yeah, it's the Neo Geo game.
It's Fatal Fury.
Next.
Hey look, Streets of Rage 3.
Which is actually a pretty good game.
I miss the old beat-em-up games like that.
Although nothing was ever as awesome as Battletoads and Double Dragon.
And moving forward, as soon as it decides to load, Golden Axe 3 at 800 Wii points, which was also, as it was known in the UK, Sega Mega Drive, which for us was the Genesis.
And remember, Genesis does what Nintendo don't.
And also, another Mega Drive game for 800 Wii Points, Super Thunder Blade, which actually wasn't all that fun.
And last but not least, Landstalker, The Treasure of the King Gnoll.
No, Treasure of King Gnoll, another Mega Drive game, which I don't actually think was fun either.
End of story.
Alright, anyways.
So, someday, there will be some more titles for the WiiWare service, because right now all there is is a couple channels for the Wii, but one title promised for early 2008 is going to be a game called Gravitronics.
It's being put out by developer Metaverse, and it's going to be a game, I guess, supporting up to eight players, and I guess it's going to be assaulting enemy territories using shapes.
Sweet.
So, death by shapes.
What is the deal with that whole, because I'm, speaking as a Nintendo fanboy, they were supposed to, like, have all this stuff, like, ready to go at launch.
And it's, like, a year later, they're still doing three games a week, and there's, like, literally hundreds of games between these three systems.
Or, Eddie, did you try going online and filling out the form to ask the question?
Because, you know.
I should, huh?
I should, like, call them up and be like, bitch.
Well, okay.
Here's one thing that.
A lot of the games, first off, weren't rated by the ESRB, so a lot of those had to go through that again.
A lot of them also, they have to be made to work with the emulators.
Okay, and stuff like that.
And then also, they don't give a fuck what you care!
They're just like, we're fucking Nintendo, you can't buy our fucking system.
Why the fuck do you want to get online anyways?
You need to get your fucking system first before you can get fucking online.
No, I know the semantics, but...
Nintendo Online?
It's such a scary world, that online out there.
You know, the Opera browser is awesome.
I like doing that on my TV, but there's really nothing else for Nintendo Online.
I mean, there should be.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and then, oh my god, Nintendo caused the kid to get raped.
Oh no.
Just like the fucking Wii Jacket shit.
I mean, there's no reason that they need to improve stuff.
It's obviously idiotic people throwing shit through their goddamn TV and now you have this, like, stupid, like, foam shit on the, like, fucking remote that's gonna...
I guess Protector TV.
No.
The hell it will.
People will find more ways to do this.
Until this stupid thing that the Wii is going to sit in, the remote, it's going to be like this giant foam protective thing that's going to look like you're waving around a giant retarded glove or something.
I mean, seriously.
They're idiotic people.
They just need to get over that fact and just...
Start making better shit.
How should Nintendo be responsible for somebody else's idiocy?
There's no amount of protection that they're going to be able to give for these remotes to cause people not to play.
You should actually hold on to the Wiimote.
Even if somebody does...
You know, completely disregard an instruction that is blatantly written on the product.
Like five minutes before every game starts, it's like, be careful, the Wiimote.
Well, I have an example for you, and this doesn't necessarily have to do with a video game, but this is a primary example of how somebody can still basically bypass an entire law to get money out of a company.
I studied this in my business law class, so this is back to business law.
This person had a weed whacker.
and it said children under the age of so and such should not be allowed anywhere near it.
Do not swing it back.
Do not do this.
The company is not responsible if this is the circumstance.
Well, this kid was following his uncle around following this weed whacker and it bounced off of a rock which was not a fault of the machine.
It was physics.
Reach back and cut off this kid's leg.
What?
All of the things led up that it was operator error.
It was full operator error.
It was not the fault of the product, and they disregarded all the things.
However, they managed to get somewhere close to $2 million out of the company.
And so I use that as my primary example.
If Nintendo wants to be careful, then more power to them, because they're going to find ways to bleed them dry if something like that happened.
All right.
In the interest of keeping the show under four hours tonight, we've got to move on to the next story.
Lots of good points tonight, but we've got to keep it moving.
Halo DS Halo DS
Now, here's the thing, though, is that actually what happened is that apparently somebody was actually modifying an engine of another game to show that Halo DS could be done and Halo DS could be ported, and it was something that had come as an idea, like, hey, why don't you let us develop a DS port of Halo, to which the answer was a resounding no.
And Halo's boring.
Yeah.
If it had Wi-Fi network, it might be pretty cool and have the same multiplayer capabilities.
That's what I think, although honestly, you know, I just wish for Duke Nukem 3D on DS.
Heck yeah.
Along with the text, with the voice macros.
No, they do not need Duke Nukem 3D on the DS.
You need to fucking finish Duke Nukem Forever.
And now we're getting Ike.
Lucas, Mother 3, and The Wizard
As long as Lucas still has the ability to do PK Fire and PK Cross and all that cheap bullshit, then I'll be very happy.
You know, they should build one of those wireless communicators with Super Master.
Your mic is going crazy, Eddie, so we're going to unplug it, and you're going to have to borrow one of the other mics from now on, because the chat room is complaining about you.
Yeah, it's cutting in and out.
They can't hear it.
They can't hear it.
You have to use another mic.
It's on.
This is on a commission.
Oh, darn.
Sorry, Eddie.
Anyways.
In other news, the Wii is not going to meet the demand for this holiday.
So in case you were waiting for some magical delivery of Wii systems that was going to be able to put out millions and millions of units in the United States, think again.
It's not going to happen.
Reggie actually kind of originally claimed that there was going to be...
Plenty of units out there, but then went back to retract that statement.
And, of course, they're trying to up the quantities coming to the United States, but still they're not going to be able to make it.
I mean, I guess that's good that they're selling units.
I think it's still crappy, though, that after a year being out, they can't fucking produce more of these.
I mean, I don't think that there's anything in them that's really that revolutionary.
I don't know.
If you can find one, buy one.
That's probably the recommendation.
Especially if you want to get one for Christmas.
Alrighty.
Well, good luck.
Hopefully there won't be all the camping out and everything that people have to do again this time.
That would be kind of sucky.
I don't know.
Alright, well, there's been some titles announced for the Neo Geo
Yeah, but then again I paid about $100 for the cart, so...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I said, and her boobs come out when you knock her out.
Well, other potential title coming out on the virtual console, at least the ESRB's put out ratings for it, is we have Echo Jr.
and Eternal Champions, which I love Eternal Champions, but I like Eternal Champions CD better, with the CineKills.
Those are so great.
Sonic 3D Blast and Light Crusader also have ratings out on them.
So yeah.
Hooray!
I want Vectorman.
Well, there's plenty of other stuff coming out in the U.S.
this week.
This week, we're going to see releases of such wonderfully average games as Looney Tunes Acme Arsenal coming out on PlayStation 2, 360, and the Wii.
Looney Tunes Duck Amok on the DS.
Mountain Bike Adrenaline, a game that's attempting to make mountain biking extreme or something.
It's coming out on PlayStation 2.
Honda SBK07, Superbike, also coming out on PlayStation 2.
And Backyard Football 2008.
Why the fuck do they still make more of those games?
Because they all suck.
Um...
Also coming out this week on the DS, Jackass, which I recommend that one because it's awesome.
FIFA Soccer 08 coming out on almost every single platform.
On Xbox 360, Half-Life 2, the orange box is going to be making its way out.
And also on the PC, that will be coming out as well.
Sega Rally Revo on Xbox 360, PS3, and PSP.
Bleach, The Shattered Blade, Bleach No, Flipper Critters, Touch Detective 2.5, Thrillville Off The Rails,
and on, let's see here, the Wii Mercury Meltdown Revolution.
I believe that's everything.
Oh, Folklore on the PS3.
That one's actually looking like a pretty good game.
It's gotten some pretty decent reviews as well.
And Final Fantasy Tactics, War of the Lions coming out on the PSP.
Ooh, that's supposed to be a good one.
I'm looking forward to that.
And then the last one, let's see here.
Star Wars Battlefront Renegade Squadron on PSP as well
Also on the PlayStation 3, The Godfather, The Dawns Edition.
So if you're a fan of The Godfather in Japan, you get that.
You gotta love this on the PlayStation 2, Colorful Aquarium, My Little Mermaid.
Yay!
This is not... Dating sim!
Yeah, this looks like some type of dating sim or something.
This is not some aquarium like Tetris Splash or whatever.
It's just a bunch of... It's a maid fetish game.
Yeah, it's anime girls in maid costumes.
There you go.
With kitty ears.
Exactly.
It's just, you know...
Otaku, Boys, Fapaway We need another Tokimeki Memorial Well maybe you will someday Coming out on the DS, Namco Museum DS with the letter N Do you want?
With the letter N How many freaking Namco Museum things do you have?
Do you need another one on the DS?
Yes They need to come out with like a DVD of these that's like every single Namco game ever made For real, looks like there's kind of a cool new version of Pac-Man on there I don't know if that's Pac-Man Versus or what the hell it is It is Pac-Man Versus Is that really?
Look at that, that's all right there on the Namco Museum on the DS Good times
Also coming out on the DS, Tecmo is putting this game out and it looks like, I don't know, some type of like spy game or something there.
I don't know if it's a point and click.
Yeah, it might be a point and clicker.
I'm not sure, but here's the name of it.
DS Nishimura Kaitoro Suspense Shintante Series Kyoto Atami Zekai no Koutou Satsui no Wana.
I know one of that game.
Yeah, I was looking at that and thinking of Snatcher.
I don't know if it takes longer to beat the game or pronounce the title, so it's all right there.
And on the Sony PSP, some movies come out for those of you guys.
They're still in the UMDs in Japan, and you can buy this week on October 12th, Lady in the Water.
Yes, the M. Night Shyamalan classic, and you can oogle those scrunts right there on the PlayStation 3.
Hey, how about somewhere else?
That's the sound I make when I'm taking a lady in the water.
Leaving sacrifices for the lady in the water.
Wow.
So shall I continue with the UK releases?
Actually, really quickly, Alpha Canogram says, Sky, that is the Pac-Man that Miyamoto helped work on.
So that's like the, I guess, newer Pac-Man.
Oh, in that case, let me buy another Pac-Man game.
That ain't stopped us.
So on the 12th in the UK, Blitzkrieg 2 Liberation on PC, Crash of the Titans on Xbox 360, Deadhead Fred on PSP, Donkey Kong Jungle Climber on DS, Folklore on PlayStation 3, Half-Life 2 Episode 2, Heroes of Might and Magic 5 Tribes of the East, NBA Live 08, Portal, Project Gotham Racing 4, Race 07 the official WTCC game, whatever that is.
Skate on PlayStation 3, Spider-Man Friend or Foe, which I'm actually kind of looking forward to, Star Wars Battlefront Renegade Squadron on PSP, Tar Chronicles on PC, Team Fortress 2, and the Orange Box.
I think I forgot to mention one.
I think this week also Donkey Kong Bongo Blast is coming out on the Wii.
I don't know if anyone should get excited about a game that was supposed to be on the GameCube featuring the bongos and now is on the Wii because we need another Wii game and it's a racing game.
I'm excited.
I tried.
I tried, guys.
I tried.
No, seriously though, there are some other interesting things happening, including more Guitar Hero tracks being revealed.
I swear to God, there's no surprise when you go play Guitar Hero 3 nowadays.
Which, by the way, this is how Activision keeps Guitar Hero in the news every week, and it's worked successfully.
Every week there's some damn Guitar Hero 3 update.
Well, there's only a couple more weeks until this game comes out.
But there is some good stuff being announced.
When You Were Young by The Killers...
Same Old Song and Dance by Aerosmith, Helicopter by Block Party, Stricken by Disturbed, Devil Went Down to Georgia, Black Magic Woman by Santana, Hit Me With Your Best Shot by Pat Benatar,
and The Seeker by The Who and some other shit.
Hit me with a wet sock.
Come on!
I don't know.
It's how we used to sing it at karaoke.
Me and my imaginary... Irene, don't say things if you don't have a microphone.
Seriously, you ruin the experience for the podcast listeners.
Us as studio are amused.
Anything else you want to announce on Guitar Hero 3?
Nope.
It's coming out on the 28th, in case you haven't heard, and that's a Sunday.
Hooray.
No, but seriously, though, they're going to have to keep all the attention they can possibly get, because about a month after that is when Rock Band comes out, and then, I don't know.
You know, a friend of mine used to sing it on stage once.
Whip me with your big cock.
Come on!
No, that was not my grandma, you fucking bastard.
Alright.
Alright.
Anyhow.
Moving on.
I will probably not be playing too much of Guitar Hero 3 because I'm too busy being addicted to MMOs.
and one MMO that maybe I should really check out sometime because I've heard a lot of things about it.
City of Heroes.
City of Heroes is actually going to be getting a new update called A Stitch in Time where the heroes will get to go into a new universe and get to relive some of the major events that have happened in the past to shape Paragon City, which is where all the City Heroes folks live.
Oh my god, such a ripoff of Final Fantasy XI.
Not really.
No, no.
I say no because this is letting them relive events that, you know, these games have been out for years.
I'm just kidding.
I'm not serious.
Both of the ideas suck.
Yeah, like they're the first people to ever think of, you know, going back in time.
Seriously.
Well, there will be new power sets including dual blades and willpower, new customization, weapons, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
City of Heroes fans are excited, I'm sure.
However, I still have not checked out City of Heroes, but I've heard good things about chat.
Chat room, tell me about City of Heroes.
Any of you guys play it?
If so, what am I missing?
I know a few people who do.
I think that it's got this thing where I think it has some sort of rotating experience thing.
I don't know.
I think the best part of that game would be creating your character.
I could see myself sitting there for an hour in the create your character mode and then that's it.
And then at the end, Stan Lee remakes your costume.
Exactly.
And I get dismissed.
I have to throw away my costume because I'm not a true superhero because I tried to kick the baby.
Well, in other MMORPG news, and we all know that MMORPG means many men online roleplaying girls, for those who are playing World of Warcraft, which I am not numbered among you since my computer died, I am playing better games, well, they have done their own version of Oktoberfest in World of Warcraft.
Brewfest.
Which is really what Oktoberfest should be called anyway, don't you think?
Where you can run around and lederhosen!
And eat pretzels.
In game.
And listen to German polka, which is awesome.
You know what makes it even better is if you actually have significant amounts of alcohol there with you at your computer.
You can actually get these things in little brew fest vendors, and if you drink them, they actually give you buffs, they're useful items, but then they make your screen all wavy, and like, it fucks with you.
Like, if you have a, you know, if, what?
Oh god, here comes Irene.
How long have you been playing WoW?
Because they have alcoholic drinks, like, from the end.
No, but this one's different.
Like, instead of making your screen blurry, this one made my screen, like, pulsate.
It was really weird.
Like, I've only ever drank the alcoholic drinks that make the screen blurry.
And then they blur more and more as you drink them.
Isn't that kind of sad?
People that, like, drink alcohol in-game.
It's like, I'm too scared to try it.
Well, everybody tries it once.
I mean, come on.
In-game.
Well, yeah, because you want to see what your character's like drunk.
Like, is this what it's really like?
I'm never drinking ever again.
Like, it's pretty sad.
Someone take the mic.
No, I'll tell you what happens when you really drink in real life, is you get a bright idea to form an internet radio program with your friends, and then you can't escape it for over 250 weekly episodes.
No, Rob, that's when you're bored on the bart.
No, when you get drunk, you marry Irene.
No, no, no, that's a joke.
Eddie tells a funny joke and gets a 10-day resort job.
That's a joke from a party.
Well, that's just funny after a conversation.
No, Irene got married at a party when this guy was drunk, so... Yeah, his name's William.
Okay.
And John.
Yeah, my roommate, John.
We were all in the car, and we were talking about going to Vegas and wanting to go to Vegas.
And we were talking about wanting to talk about – because you know how everybody's – I think the topic of Britney Spears came up.
But you know how everybody's always talking about, oh, the sanctity of marriage.
No, we were talking about the sanctity of marriage, and we were bringing up examples of why there's no sanctity.
And those laws – and I don't mean to be political, but whatever.
The laws in those states pass.
Marriage should only be a man and a woman to protect the sanctity of marriage.
and then we talk about Britney Spears gets married in an old within 48 hours.
Excellent example of the sanctity of marriage at work, right?
So we're talking about who would you go to Vegas and get married and then divorce right away?
Like we were talking, let's go to, since we can't, since like, you know, us being gay, we can't marry each other.
Well, Jamie's already married.
She can't remarry.
But the rest of us are all gay.
We can't marry each other.
I can pretend.
So we're going to marry women and go to Vegas and just get married to a woman and then divorce.
So they were saying, who should I marry?
And then your name came up, Irene, as to somebody I should marry.
and I was like, no!
I don't even want to be married to her for an hour.
Why do you look so sad?
You can marry Eddie or something.
I would marry Eddie.
We're going to get married when we're 30.
Why did you look so shocked that I wouldn't marry you?
Because you don't want to marry me.
It would be a dysfunctional marriage.
It would be really bad.
Everybody wants to marry me.
I had the bright idea of having a group wedding and then a group annulment.
That's a great idea.
We should do that right now.
Forget the show.
Rob, Irene's already married to somebody that you know, so.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Oh, did she marry my boyfriend when I wasn't with him?
Yeah, exactly.
Good job.
And he does crazy things to her all the time.
Are you putting out?
According to him, she is.
Do you see the pictures on my MySpace?
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
I mean, there's no pictures.
What?
Huh?
I don't really know what it... Maybe it's because I've been drinking a little bit here in studio tonight, but yeah, that had nothing to do with games.
Yeah, Irene... Loki's sitting over there doing like the... Either the I've got to go to the bathroom dance or goddammit, can we talk about video games?
No, Irene makes chocolate something that was on his shirt.
I like grapes.
Eddie brings the show to a screeching halt.
10 gamers score.
Anyways... I also like beer.
Beer is great.
Beer makes this show possible.
This mystical new 40GB PlayStation 3 SKU, which we had no idea was going to come out, is now made official.
And, you know, earlier this week there was rumors saying, oh, it's not going to be backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 games at all.
And then people were like, oh, no, of course it will be because, you know, they do it all via software emulation and that kind of stuff.
Well, come to find out, guess what?
It isn't backwards compatible with any PlayStation 2 games.
So they removed, essentially, a free part of the PlayStation 3 just to fuck you all over again.
Um...
So it is official for Europe.
It's going to be coming out here pretty soon.
It is not backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 titles at all.
It will be coming out on October 10th for a price of €399.
And it will only have two USB ports instead of four, which is not a huge deal.
And none of the multi-memory card ports, which is also not a real big deal.
But come on!
No backwards compatibility PlayStation 2 games?
I mean...
Yeah, I'm sure that they'll be busy playing your entire library of games for the PlayStation 3.
Why do you need PlayStation 2 games when you have Motorstorm and Lair?
Oh, well, my mistake.
Oh, you know, forgive me.
So it's not even backwards compatible with patches on the hard drive?
No, not at all.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, why is it such a big deal when you have a PlayStation 2 right there on the shelf?
Do you really need it to play PlayStation 2 games?
I say yes, because A, I know people who don't own PlayStation 2s.
Imports.
And B, PlayStation 2s sometimes break a while later.
Well, but you can't play PlayStation 2 imports.
They're not region free.
I've seen them.
On a Japanese PlayStation 3, you can.
Nope.
No, you cannot play... There's video proof out there, I'll tell you.
You cannot play Japanese games on PlayStation 2s or PlayStation 3s of other regions.
Only PlayStation 3 games are region-free.
Then the game might not have been coded.
You know, it's just... It's really, really stupid.
I don't know what the hell they were thinking, but... Hey, if you want to, you know...
Buy one of these.
It will be available.
I mean, save yourself some money, I guess.
Maybe it's because they don't really want to cut the price on these.
And this is their way of, I don't know, getting people to buy the more expensive... I don't know.
The whole thing is they're like, well, we're offering these cheaper SKUs, but it's... Even starting with the 20GB PS3, it's like, well, we have this cheaper SKU, but it's kind of, you know, a little bit gimped.
So maybe just spend the extra $100 or whatever and buy the better one.
It's kind of what they've been doing.
It's like we're throwing out this crap car.
It's like you can either choose this car with no wheels, no steering wheel, no airbags, and no gas tank, or you could buy this Ferrari.
Which would you like?
I love this comment in the chat room from Escapist at chat.orangelaunchradio.com says, Reactions to criticism.
Nintendo gets angry.
Microsoft is sorry and tries to fix the problem.
Sony goes and pleasures itself in the corner while singing show tunes.
Clang, clang, clang goes the trolley
Let me put it this way.
If you're really serious on getting the PlayStation 3, and you're waiting for Metal Gear Solid 4, Grand Theft Auto 4, Final Fantasy XIII, I suggest you purchase the console closer to the time when these games come out.
Because by then, they're going to have about four other SKUs that will have varying degrees of crippled
DarkSakura.com
I don't get it.
I don't get why you would remove something that's free.
It boggles my mind.
I don't understand.
I'm just a girl who can't say no.
I'm in a terrible fix.
I'm singing in the rain.
This is great radio you have.
Too bad, is the camera on?
No, the camera shut off after 40 minutes.
Anyway.
But you know, I hear that there's going to be a new SKU or something coming out over here with Spider-Man 3 bundled with it, so hey, at least you have a fucking Blu-ray player.
There you go.
Well, obviously, needless to say, this news makes us a little bit agitated.
Especially for those of us that were hoping to clear the space on the shelves.
Or maybe see some upscaled PlayStation 2.
You know, that would have been kind of cool too.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry to interrupt you real quick.
I forgot to add Sony's official comment to explain why they decided not to put backwards compatibility in there.
It says...
Let's see here.
There is sufficient choice in the marketplace, and we're still better off using that money that we put into backwards compatibility, either investing in new games or using that money to help support bringing the price down.
We have made it clear on many occasions that our priority is on developing innovative new features and services for the PlayStation 3, not on backwards compatibility.
Okay, but...
They have it built into the firmware right now.
Why remove it?
Because that's just being a dick.
That's what it is.
When you're a gent, you know you're a gent.
Needless to say...
This is the show tunes hour on Orange Lounge Radio.
I would like to remind you guys that Phil Harrison, about a year ago, said, Backwards compatibility, as you know from PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2, is a core value of what we believe we should offer.
And access to a library of content people have created...
All the game developers copied their controller design, forgetting that they copied theirs from Super Nintendo, so, you know.
Whatever.
Let's continue.
Sigh.
Well, actually, Sony actually released an official statement on the matter.
What is that song?
You can't stop PS3, you can't stop it, you can't, can't stop the PS3.
They probably think they're winning right now.
We are winning!
You can't buy a PS3 anywhere!
Sorry!
I mean, but seriously.
Every week it's a fucking story like this.
I mean...
Who the fuck is running their company?
I mean, how do they make these decisions?
Hey, let's have a... Chimpanzees.
I mean, who thinks up this shit?
I swear to God.
I made the joke earlier this week.
There's some guy on their advertising or marketing strategies team or whatever that's trying to get fired and come up with the stupidest fucking ideas and wanting to get himself fired.
And they're like, hey, that's a great idea.
Let's run with that.
And it's like, my God.
I mean, who...
Who thinks this is crazy?
You know what?
I think what they do is that they have those magnets, you know, that you make your own poetry out of on their phone.
And so they just, they reach in and grab like six of them and put them in order and that's their new marketing plan.
And it's not people that are picking them out, they're trained monkeys.
They're poorly trained monkeys.
And sometimes they have to wipe the poo off of them that they fling as they make it.
Kutaragi, here I go again My, my, crayons are delicious Kutaragi, here we go again No backwards compatibility on PS3 Hey, I need work So how many beers did you have, Rob?
Just one, amazingly
Now's a good time for the FUs of the Week, as our chat room is just, all I'm seeing in chat room is like dot, dot, dot, just right on down the screen.
Let's get into the FUs of the Week.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have some brand new old FU music.
We're bringing back an old FU tonight, and let's kick it off.
This is the part of the show where we get angsty, and obviously this news about the removed backwards compatibility, which seems to be a step backwards, makes us a little angry.
And if you disagree, send us an email, mailbag at orangehauntrader.com.
But I don't read it.
The FUs of the Week.
So, my FU of the week goes toward bitches.
Stupid, petty bitches.
But Jamie, then you're screwing yourself.
Thank you.
Okay.
This is what happened at work.
Now, people know that I like to leave detailed diagrams on how people should park in a parking lot.
I didn't do that this time.
I was pulling into one of the last parking spots at work, and there was this car that was double parked, and I nearly ran into their driver's side rearview mirror.
So, I back out, park properly in the spot, and leave them a note that says, Please do not double park.
I even said please.
It was either that or call security and get them a ticket.
And if they get ticketed enough, then they have to park outside the parking lot.
We have a gate in the parking lot.
So, I go back in, and I go out, and these girls are standing around my car, kneeling down by my tires, and I can hear these loud, echoing voices, and hear tire, and note, and this, and then my mother calls me.
I'm like, crap, mom.
So I'm talking to my mom, standing by the back door, watching them do shit to my car.
I have no idea what they're doing.
And then they get in their car and drive past, and then I hear, Oh, there she is!
Like that.
So I'm on the phone with my mother.
And you don't want to get into a fight with loud people when you're on the phone with your mother.
Although my mom would probably be very proud of me.
Not really.
Question from chat real quick.
SSJ100Matt asks, Where was youparklikeanasshole.com in this moment?
I didn't have any of the stickers on me.
So I go back inside, wait five minutes, go back out after I'm off to film my mom, and they're gone.
So I go back to my car, and I go about my business, everything seems fine.
You know, I have a magnet on my car that's a little rainbow heart, and I thought that they stole it, but it turned out that my husband took it off when he was driving my car when he was fixing it.
So I get back, and my tires have been low for a couple weeks, so I said, you know, I'm getting gas today, I'll go ahead and fill my tires.
And I tried to get the caps off on the passenger side, and the caps wouldn't come off on my valve stems on my tires.
But the other side was just fine.
So I ended up going to Bridgestone the next day, and they had these two wrenches to get the caps off, and it turned out that they put nail glue, like super glue, in the caps on my tires.
So now...
See, I think it would have been much better for them to be a little peeved about a little note than be fired for vandalism and harassment.
Because that's what's going to happen to them.
I have the exact time of day that they drove out of the parking lot, and we have cameras that record all license plates as they go in and out.
When you're hired by the place, when you get your new badge, you are required to give your license plate number to security.
They're going to be very fired, all four of them, and I am going to laugh my ass off.
Wow, I didn't know we had applause.
There's an applause light in here, apparently.
Alright, moving on.
No, no, no, because see, this is what I mean.
You don't fuck with me.
Loki, follow that.
F.E.
McDonald's for not knowing how to fucking cook french fries.
You just put them in the fucking fryer and push a button.
How hard is that?
But yet you fucking find a way to screw it up every single time.
I mean, seriously, fries should taste the same every single time.
Every time.
Because it's a button that you push.
How the fuck do you fuck up a button?
I mean, really?
Fuck that.
My FU of the week.
Oh, it's a pot.
Showing signs of support tonight.
I'm going to keep my FU brief tonight because the others were a little long.
Not that that's a problem.
My FU is brief tonight.
I'm going to give an FU to show tunes.
Enough said.
Papi, you're up next.
I give an F you to the California DMV for being slow as fuck, even online.
I paid my registration for my car two and a half weeks ago.
They still have not sent me my new tax.
And it's pissing me off.
And I'm waiting to get pulled over for it.
And it's going to suck.
Hold your... Hold... Okay, now you can applaud.
Yay!
How can you recant something that you never said in the first game?
Yeah, I did.
A couple weeks ago.
Rice Princess, your turn.
F you to recanting stuff that you never said in the first place.
Yay!
I'm sort of trying to clap.
Back to the show.
From angst and F yous to Harvest Moon!
Yay!
Harvest Moon, if you are a fan of farming, and actually I know there's some fans of Harvest Moon because I...
I dared to make fun of Harvest Moon.
Well, what else do you do on Harvest Moon?
I know we have some fans of Harvest Moon because I got yelled at by one one week in an email.
You're a fan of Harvest Moon, right?
Okay, well then good.
This ought to be good news.
The Harvest Moon creator, Yashuro Wada, has announced that the next Harvest Moon game is going to be online.
Meaning that between two and eight players can actually visit a town.
The only trick, we don't know what platform the game's on yet.
But the next Harvest Moon game will be online.
And it won't be Nintendo.
Well, not necessarily.
It could be DS.
That could be a very DS thing.
What are you going to do?
Have competitive cow milking?
Stop releasing so many damn Harvest Moon games.
There's been like four this year already, and there's still more coming.
Well, no, I'm serious.
What are you going to do?
Have competing farms or some shit?
Or go visit other people's cows?
What the hell did you do in Animal Crossing?
You ran to towns and hit people with bug nets, and it was funny.
Or buried things in holes.
And you sent dirty letters to their townsfolk.
That's right, and you buried pitfalls in front of people's houses.
No, I'll tell you what you do in Animal Crossing.
You play the game with your best friend, only to have him backstab you and get the trophy first.
Did you forget, Rob, so easily?
Yeah, actually, I did forget.
Somebody's got some...
Hey, you know what?
It hurt.
Wait, you're seriously mad that I went and got the gold villager?
I was mad for like two minutes.
I was like, stupid motherfucker.
It's been a little longer than two minutes.
It's been like two and a half years.
Well, you know what?
I thought about it again, okay?
Jeez, work with me on this.
You know what?
I want factory moon.
Instead of having a cow on a farm.
You have a cow factory?
You have like a, you know, Cowschwitz.
Yeah, I was going to say, all they need to do is put a slaughterhouse in Harvest Moon and the game will be like ten times cooler.
Well, they do have... PETA will protest.
They do have Innocent Life, a futuristic Harvest Moon, which takes farming to the future.
Guess what?
It's just the same as farming now, except it's in the future.
Hurrah.
Let's go on to the next story.
I don't think there's anything more we can say on Harvest Moon.
Except that it's Harvest Moon.
So, this is actually pretty... And I love stuff like this, where they do studies about how video games improve your intelligence and your skills and shit.
They're saying now that action games improve women's spatial abilities.
Okay.
Because they didn't have any to begin with?
I'm asking a hypothetical question.
It says that it helps improve skills like geometry, technical drawings, reading maps.
Anything that has to do with space and how... Not that a woman would ever admit to doing that.
Why do you need geometry for shopping anyway?
Geometry?
What is that?
Geometry?
What?
I'm just kidding.
Here, take this back.
But it's more or less the cognitive function of how things fit, how things are laid out, space, judging distances, that type of thing.
But I look at it this way, that anything that you do that makes you use that skill should improve it.
So really, a video game could help with that, but so could actually...
practicing topography or, you know, spending time drawing or... Raising cows.
No, not raising cows.
So which one of those abilities focuses on using the turn signal when switching lanes?
You know what?
I have actually run across more male drivers.
I was trying very hard to refrain from the driving joke.
You should be very proud of me.
I'm very hard not to say, but will it make them better drivers?
I was doing very...
Very good.
You know what?
Gender has absolutely nothing to do with bad driving.
It's overall intelligence, and I've run across more male drivers who are worse drivers than women.
Okay, well, then this begs the point, why just women?
Why doesn't it give men better spatial abilities?
Because I think that they've just did the study on women.
Because we're uber awesome?
No.
Because I know that the majority of people in this room are male, but I'm sorry, testosterone makes you stupid.
Oh, snap.
No, no, no, no.
This is Rob's party.
What are you talking about testosterone?
I don't mean it like that, but I think that having a higher tendency toward aggression usually leads to less common sense.
Now JV Mon in chat room gives a comment that makes it all make sense.
JV Mon says men get better spatial ability from masturbating.
So you know how much clearance you need?
There you go.
See, I don't really think that men have, I don't really think, after living in a house and having my husband and all of his friends over, I don't think that, from that sample, I don't think that all men have good spatial ability or else they wouldn't pee on the seat.
And would learn how to close the seat when they're done.
Hey, you know what?
Some things are skill, some things are luck, okay?
Sinkstar R&B has been announced.
God damn, there hasn't been enough SingStar games this year yet.
But apparently a wonderful track list is coming out as well, including all sorts of fun stuff.
Black Eyed Peas, Pump It, Destiny's Child, Bootylicious, DJ Jazzy Jeff and the French Prince, Summertime.
That's pretty awesome.
Gwen Stefani, Hollaback Girl, and let's see here.
Luther Vandross, Never Too Much, Outcast, Idlewild Blue, Don't You Worry About Me, and Whitney Houston, Your Love Is My Love, among others.
And I knew it would take merely seconds for someone to make this comment, but Hippolytus in our chatroom says, Black Eyed Peas is not R&B.
That would take five seconds for someone to say that.
Don't tell my mother about this game, because she loves Luther.
Andros.
She really does.
And if you know my mother, she's... I think she likes both.
Well, neither... I don't think Hall of Batgirls R&B either, but, you know, whatever.
That's true, too.
Well, I don't know.
A little bit.
All right.
Anyway, let's go on to a brand new segment, which is going to be our last segment of Part A tonight.
Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week
I have the same old music.
I know, because the chat room was really like the old music.
It didn't want to see it go away, so we had to keep it.
So, DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
The classic game of the week is Fantasy Zone, which is my second favorite video game ever.
Fantasy Zone is a game where you play as a little ship called the Opa Opa.
It's this little red ship with a window on it.
It has wings, but when it's on the ground, it walks.
And...
Listen to the music.
It's got the best music ever.
It plays a lot like Defender.
It is.
It's Chibi Defender, basically.
Anyway, you can keep reading.
We'll let this play in the background.
Good times.
I like how the ship has feet.
There was, and I actually have the other versions.
I have Fantasy Zone on Master System and Super Nintendo.
Fantasy Zone 2 on both.
I have, now Space Fantasy Zone was one that came out.
Well, it was a prototype only.
It was supposed to be out on the TurboGrafx Duo.
And I have a burn of it, but I haven't actually sat down and played it yet.
And then there was the Super Fantasy Zone.
Also, for anyone who's a fan of import and cast games, some of the enemies from Fantasy Zone 2 were in the final boss for the game, Segagaga.
But it's a fun little game, and also the Fantasy Zone is the same universe that Space Harrier was set in.
And you actually have a later level in Fantasy Zone that's the Space Harrier level.
Yes, currently our little ship, the Opa Opa, is fighting a big tree that's spitting leaves.
A tree trunk.
But it's cute.
It's cute.
It's okay.
Well, in the Space Harrier level, you actually fight low-eye heads.
But, um... Also, another thing, for anyone who was collecting the Sega Ages 2900 collection, they redid the whole thing in 3D, but it was still side-scrolling.
But when you did your, um...
Your bonus level where you have to go catch all these coins, it was in first person.
So, Rob, you played my copy.
Yes, it was kind of neat.
But it was probably one of the best Sega games ever, I think.
Alright.
And you can also go in shops and buy, like, anvils.
and Wings and Fairy Wings for your ship.
And you can buy Wings and you can buy extra boosters and different types of rockets.
But I just like you buy this big thing that's like the one ton thing that they drop in the Looney Tunes cartoons and just drop it on ships.
It was great.
Good times.
All right.
Well, Fantasy Zone is the classic game of the week.
So check it out at your local swap meet.
Or, you know, there's other ways you can go about finding a ROM of Fantasy Zone.
Two dollars on eBay.
All right.
All right, well, that's going to bring to a close Part A of our podcast.
But fear not, there's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come, like it or not, in Part B. And coming up tonight in Part B, since it is Episode 250, we have to do one of our very favorite segments, Match Game, coming up tonight.
That's right.
Applause.
Our new applause light is flashing, apparently.
Woo!
All right, so the match game will be up in just a little bit.
We'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.
Which, by the way, oh, I need to say one more thing about the show.
The show is now going to be released on, due to popular demand, instead of making it wait until Wednesday, you now get Part B on Tuesday on the feed.
I thought you were saying we were going to release it on Betamax.
Maybe we could, actually.
Dude, that would be cool.
We could actually find a working beta machine.
We'll have to go to the TV station to find that.
It'll be released on Laserdisc and Betamax.
Alright, and hopefully we will try very hard to keep Part B show tunes free.
Alright, we'll see, maybe.
Alright, we'll be back right after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
