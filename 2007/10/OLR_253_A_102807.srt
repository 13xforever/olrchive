00:00:13,878 --> 00:00:19,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, October 28, 2007, a 360 Fall Update feature may have been leaked, Smash Bros.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,462
[SPEAKER_00]: lets you share instant replays, and could Myspace be the next great gaming outlet?

3
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:36,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:36,384 --> 00:00:40,487
[SPEAKER_03]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:40,547 --> 00:00:41,708
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:44,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura.

7
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:45,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo.

8
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:46,632
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, DarkSakura?

9
00:00:47,293 --> 00:00:47,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Been better.

10
00:00:48,153 --> 00:00:48,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, sorry to hear.

11
00:00:49,514 --> 00:00:51,456
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, we have good days and not so good days.

12
00:00:51,956 --> 00:00:52,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

13
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:53,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm having a not so good day as well.

14
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:55,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you about that in a moment.

15
00:00:55,779 --> 00:00:57,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a beer now and that makes everything better.

16
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Fiji water and that makes things okay.

17
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:03,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me – I said now I dropped the cap.

18
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Now everything sucks again.

19
00:01:04,389 --> 00:01:04,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate my life.

20
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:06,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't cry, Emo Rob.

21
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to Tech Master Loki.

22
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:09,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

23
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,791
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, Loki?

24
00:01:11,091 --> 00:01:11,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing fine.

25
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:13,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing better than myself and DarkSakura?

26
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:14,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

27
00:01:14,511 --> 00:01:19,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's what happened is that I kind of stage dived last night but not on purpose.

28
00:01:20,272 --> 00:01:22,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Those of you guys have been listening – Oh, that's all right.

29
00:01:23,053 --> 00:01:23,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll live.

30
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:36,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Those of you guys who have been listening to the show for a long time know that I'm involved with theatrical production of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, which is so different from what we do here on Orange Launch Radio, but we all have a variety of different likes and stuff, right?

31
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:44,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Last night was the big Halloween show, and I was performing the criminologist role, which is what I usually do for them now when I'm not emceeing the show.

32
00:01:45,262 --> 00:01:51,444
[SPEAKER_03]: And right at the end, I was dressed up in my Halloween garb, and my costume this year is Jack Skellington.

33
00:01:51,704 --> 00:01:56,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to go get my mask for the operator 11 people a little later so they can see, because it's actually a pretty rad costume.

34
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:59,226
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was dressed up as Jack Skellington, but the problem was I had that mask on.

35
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:03,887
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I was starting to exit the stage, I was walking down the steps, which have no handrail, mind you.

36
00:02:03,927 --> 00:02:05,688
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about six steps to get from the top to the bottom.

37
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:08,790
[SPEAKER_03]: The MC for the night was running up the steps the other way.

38
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:10,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so I started to walk down.

39
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:11,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I put my right foot on the first step.

40
00:02:11,713 --> 00:02:14,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I put my left foot down where there was no step.

41
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:18,198
[SPEAKER_03]: So I tumbled and fell, and it was really bad.

42
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily, I didn't break a bone, so it could have been worse.

43
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:29,847
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically, I landed in kind of like this pretzel shape, and I basically kicked my shoe dug in to the upper part of my thigh.

44
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:34,271
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would show you on the webcam, except that might be indecent because it's right next to my booty.

45
00:02:35,264 --> 00:02:37,705
[SPEAKER_03]: No webcam scars on that one.

46
00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:43,207
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also didn't... I skinned my knee, too, which kind of... This does not deserve happy music.

47
00:02:43,227 --> 00:02:44,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is happy music playing?

48
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:45,707
[SPEAKER_05]: It's trying to cheer you up.

49
00:02:45,747 --> 00:02:46,288
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a happy event.

50
00:02:47,288 --> 00:02:48,248
[SPEAKER_05]: It's saying, don't cry, Rob.

51
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,669
[SPEAKER_01]: It's saying, Rob... Bad news over happy music.

52
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:54,250
[SPEAKER_03]: It's saying, Rob, next time remember to hit the stop button when the intro's done.

53
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so that's why I'm a little bit in a foul mood tonight, because I'm in pain.

54
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:00,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, do you have...

55
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:02,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Drugs for me?

56
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:02,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

57
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:04,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to give you three of them.

58
00:03:04,715 --> 00:03:04,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

59
00:03:05,276 --> 00:03:08,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's talk about... You want some Vicodin too?

60
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,581
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't want Vicodin.

61
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:10,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Vicodin will make me very sleepy.

62
00:03:10,883 --> 00:03:11,143
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

63
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:13,831
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

64
00:03:36,187 --> 00:03:45,154
[SPEAKER_05]: and I played a little Guitar Hero 3 today and my dumb butt husband, I love my husband to death but man, I'm mad at him.

65
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:47,956
[SPEAKER_05]: He was supposed to bring me Super Mario Galaxy on Thursday.

66
00:03:49,277 --> 00:03:49,777
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't.

67
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:58,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I cried because the game's not out for a little while and usually when the demos from Nintendo come, they're full versions.

68
00:03:59,484 --> 00:04:04,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, that's what I heard, is that the demo at GameStop and GameCrazy right now is the full version.

69
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:08,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and he was supposed to bring it home so that I could play it for great justice.

70
00:04:08,428 --> 00:04:09,728
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only a couple weeks away.

71
00:04:10,028 --> 00:04:10,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

72
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:11,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Want.

73
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:13,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Do want.

74
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm impatient.

75
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:17,131
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my right as a woman.

76
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:22,813
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking of modding my Wii to have a mod chip on it.

77
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:27,095
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for just modding stuff, not for piracy or anything.

78
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:28,956
[SPEAKER_05]: You should put a spoiler on it and lower it

79
00:04:30,424 --> 00:04:31,625
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't get much lower.

80
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:33,907
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's like the width of three DVDs.

81
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,989
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, cases at least, but I don't know.

82
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:39,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Eh, whatever.

83
00:04:40,773 --> 00:04:41,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

84
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:44,175
[SPEAKER_03]: So, no Super Mario Galaxy for DarkSakura this week.

85
00:04:44,235 --> 00:04:44,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to hear it.

86
00:04:45,196 --> 00:04:45,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Sad face.

87
00:04:46,277 --> 00:04:46,958
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Ragnarok?

88
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:48,539
[SPEAKER_03]: You still been active on the RagnarKrak?

89
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, and I have a new obsession in that game.

90
00:04:51,702 --> 00:04:52,282
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that, pray tell?

91
00:04:52,302 --> 00:04:53,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Buying old blue boxes.

92
00:04:54,124 --> 00:04:59,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you get something random every time, and sometimes you get something really great, and sometimes you get, like, crap, like, you know...

93
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't ask for heel, please

94
00:05:29,606 --> 00:05:31,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I don't play support classes, okay?

95
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,708
[SPEAKER_05]: The closest I come to support is when I'm playing a dancer.

96
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:34,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

97
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:37,411
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just so, you know, she can walk around like a hoochie with a whip.

98
00:05:38,732 --> 00:05:39,092
[SPEAKER_03]: For fun.

99
00:05:39,332 --> 00:05:39,633
[SPEAKER_05]: For fun.

100
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a gunslinger, though.

101
00:05:41,034 --> 00:05:41,514
[SPEAKER_05]: He's pretty cool.

102
00:05:41,954 --> 00:05:42,795
[SPEAKER_05]: He's wearing a pimp hat.

103
00:05:43,715 --> 00:05:43,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

104
00:05:44,316 --> 00:05:45,337
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, that's about it.

105
00:05:45,777 --> 00:05:47,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well, Loki, how was your gaming week?

106
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:48,999
[SPEAKER_01]: My gaming week was okay.

107
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:53,282
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't play as much as I thought I would be, but I bought a copy of...

108
00:05:54,827 --> 00:06:10,111
[SPEAKER_01]: since basically I was too lazy to cancel my pre-order for Ratchet & Clank Future Tools of Destruction so now I have a copy of it and I haven't played it yet because I took the shrink wrap off of it and I'm like, ooh, case!

109
00:06:10,651 --> 00:06:13,732
[SPEAKER_01]: And put it down on the coffee table and went on my way doing other things.

110
00:06:15,213 --> 00:06:20,494
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched Nelly play Excite Truck because she's like, hey, I want to play Excite Truck again, so...

111
00:06:21,778 --> 00:06:23,479
[SPEAKER_01]: There's... She's back into that again.

112
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:26,042
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to see someone showing the Wii a little love once in a while.

113
00:06:26,422 --> 00:06:28,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, Excite Truck is awesome.

114
00:06:28,564 --> 00:06:31,766
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seriously is the best Wii game, I think.

115
00:06:32,487 --> 00:06:33,668
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't give a shit about Zelda.

116
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:34,989
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a shit about Metroid.

117
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:36,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Excite Truck is where it's at.

118
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:40,473
[SPEAKER_01]: If not the best game on the console, it's definitely the best racing game.

119
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:41,694
[SPEAKER_01]: So, whatever.

120
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:47,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, I did play some Halo 3 multiplayer last night.

121
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:47,739
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of fun.

122
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:49,601
[SPEAKER_01]: We went to a Halloween party and so we did

123
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:53,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Split Screen, and Live Multiplayer, and that was fun.

124
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:59,499
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I played some Orange Box, played more Portal.

125
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:04,120
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing more Conan, and that's an okay game.

126
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:11,883
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be fun to play through it, but then after that, I won't be playing anymore after that.

127
00:07:12,943 --> 00:07:18,665
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the PSP, I've been playing more of the Jackass game, so I can finish it and delete it.

128
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:19,425
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean,

129
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:44,410
[SPEAKER_01]: sell it back, and, um, then, what else, um, oh, Guitar Hero 3, I tried a little bit of that, and it's, you know, Guitar Hero, I mean, fuck, there's not really much I can say about it, it's not like innovative or anything, it's just, um, I broke my guitar, because, um, you know, a lot of people might not remember, um, our Op 11 show that we did last week, um,

130
00:07:45,453 --> 00:07:52,096
[SPEAKER_01]: We showed that my guitar had the orange and blue buttons out of order on there for some reason, which is weird.

131
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:53,776
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried to fix it.

132
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:55,757
[SPEAKER_01]: I fixed it fine.

133
00:07:55,797 --> 00:07:57,057
[SPEAKER_01]: I took it apart just fine.

134
00:07:58,518 --> 00:08:12,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, it's designed slightly different than, say, the retail Guitar Hero 3 guitars because in the retail ones you're able to take off the entire top of the guitar so you can change faceplates and whatnot.

135
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the wired version of it

136
00:08:15,523 --> 00:08:16,203
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

137
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:47,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me read some comments real quick to our Gaming Weeks and use this opportunity to introduce the chat room.

138
00:08:47,898 --> 00:08:50,719
[SPEAKER_03]: We always tape live on Sunday night, and that allows us to interact with our listeners.

139
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:54,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.orangelawntrader.com is the place to be Sunday at 6 p.m.

140
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Pacific when we tape.

141
00:08:55,841 --> 00:08:56,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

142
00:08:56,241 --> 00:09:02,083
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have JAP28 wants to know, why not just paint them, Loki, in regards to the switch buttons?

143
00:09:02,183 --> 00:09:05,364
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it wasn't that hard to take them apart to switch out the buttons.

144
00:09:05,424 --> 00:09:08,025
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that it's not designed to be taken apart.

145
00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:08,665
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the...

146
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:10,048
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

147
00:09:31,414 --> 00:09:35,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Faceplate on it, when I was putting it back together the first time, we wouldn't have this issue, it would be fine.

148
00:09:36,036 --> 00:09:37,557
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you know, who cares?

149
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:39,698
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, I've got another guitar already.

150
00:09:40,058 --> 00:09:46,260
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't play multiplayer at my house, and when I do, it's only going to be in Rock Band anyways, so, whatever.

151
00:09:46,641 --> 00:09:49,762
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, I do like to tinker with stuff, as Blaze says in the chatroom.

152
00:09:51,082 --> 00:09:56,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Gerardimo comments in our chatroom, Well, Loki, Excite Truck is up against the other launch racing game, and that's really it.

153
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,796
[SPEAKER_01]: There was more than just the one launch game.

154
00:09:59,836 --> 00:10:05,497
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there was Need for Speed Carbon, there was the crappy GT racing game, Monster 4x4 World Circuit.

155
00:10:06,637 --> 00:10:09,318
[SPEAKER_01]: And were any of those games particularly memorable?

156
00:10:09,518 --> 00:10:11,279
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I played all of them and they sucked.

157
00:10:11,739 --> 00:10:14,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially the Monster 4x4 World Circuit and GT.

158
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Excite Truck was awesome.

159
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,321
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is the company that's making it doesn't really make anything else.

160
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:27,243
[SPEAKER_01]: All they do is make racing games and before that it was some NASCAR heat game or something like that, but

161
00:10:28,746 --> 00:10:29,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Get on it!

162
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:30,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Make Excite Truck 2!

163
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:30,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on!

164
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:32,367
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, seriously, just more of the same.

165
00:10:32,407 --> 00:10:33,727
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to fucking innovate it.

166
00:10:34,107 --> 00:10:35,247
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fine the way it was.

167
00:10:35,527 --> 00:10:41,308
[SPEAKER_01]: It just needed to be longer, have more tracks, maybe some downloadable stuff once Nintendo figures out this whole download service or whatever.

168
00:10:41,648 --> 00:10:42,729
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that would be kind of cool.

169
00:10:43,229 --> 00:10:51,390
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, until then, you know, I'm trying to play every other racing game on the platform to see if there's something sort of similar to, you know, Excite Truck.

170
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, of course, Mario Kart's gonna be awesome.

171
00:10:53,431 --> 00:10:54,391
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a different type of game.

172
00:10:54,431 --> 00:10:54,791
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's...

173
00:10:56,337 --> 00:10:57,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Nelly's not going to like that game.

174
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:07,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Going back to DarkSakura's Gaming Week in chat, Shadowslyer says, first thing I install after I get Windows, freaking Ragnarok, and it's all thanks to OLR.

175
00:11:07,771 --> 00:11:08,993
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because it's crack.

176
00:11:10,014 --> 00:11:10,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Ragnacrack.

177
00:11:11,035 --> 00:11:11,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

178
00:11:11,456 --> 00:11:11,856
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

179
00:11:12,957 --> 00:11:14,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, my Gaming Week, if you're all finished, Loki.

180
00:11:16,155 --> 00:11:16,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Think I'm done.

181
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:44,018
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

182
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:36,032
[SPEAKER_03]: and I don't know if that's because of a some type of like up ramping in the difficulty curve but I noticed that like the king this time in a lot of the stages the big trick is that the king wants you to grab all of a certain item for instance there's one level where he wants you to grab Japanese things so you have to roll up as much sushi and you know fireworks and flags as you can that are Japanese or there's one level where you're supposed to roll up nothing but hot things which was kind of a cool level there wasn't anything like that in the last game but um

183
00:12:37,137 --> 00:12:40,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, there was something like that in the last game.

184
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there was the big fireball, huh?

185
00:12:41,982 --> 00:12:42,543
[SPEAKER_01]: The campfire.

186
00:12:42,723 --> 00:12:43,303
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

187
00:12:43,624 --> 00:12:46,246
[SPEAKER_03]: So see, a lot of it kind of seems like we've sort of seen it before.

188
00:12:47,327 --> 00:12:47,928
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the thing.

189
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:52,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I will collect all of that item, and then the king is like, well, your Katamari sucks.

190
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:58,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I got it the size you wanted, everything's like, wow, your Katamari sucks, and it needs more of this item.

191
00:12:59,339 --> 00:12:59,960
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're kind of like,

192
00:13:00,427 --> 00:13:01,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, was this game bug tested?

193
00:13:01,728 --> 00:13:02,929
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs more Cowbell.

194
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I really just suck this bad at Katamari?

195
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,773
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need to say when he asks you to do stuff, you're like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, roll over stuff.

196
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,054
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I do, you know.

197
00:13:10,434 --> 00:13:12,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Except for the fire thing, because you have to be real careful with that.

198
00:13:12,436 --> 00:13:13,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, you'll keep failing.

199
00:13:13,957 --> 00:13:15,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's how I beat the stages now.

200
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:20,322
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to be careful in the beginning, but I do feel like the difficulty curve went up a little bit in this game.

201
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:27,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you think about it, each level that's themed after something like Japanese or whatever, they're going to have tons of that item everywhere.

202
00:13:27,847 --> 00:13:29,929
[SPEAKER_01]: So all you have to do is just roll over everything.

203
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,851
[SPEAKER_01]: And the majority of it will be that item.

204
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:33,052
[SPEAKER_01]: And your Katamari OBV.

205
00:13:33,452 --> 00:13:37,575
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sorry, Katamari fans, but this one's the worst game in the series so far.

206
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:40,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, the only reason I would suggest... Yeah, I would play the PSP version.

207
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:42,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.

208
00:13:42,418 --> 00:13:48,481
[SPEAKER_03]: The only way I would suggest picking this game up is if you don't have a PlayStation 2, which I can't imagine there's that many people.

209
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:49,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know there's somebody.

210
00:13:49,322 --> 00:13:50,283
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get an email from somebody.

211
00:13:50,843 --> 00:13:54,886
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can't imagine there's that many people that only own a 360 that don't own a PlayStation 2.

212
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:58,768
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, just go back and play the first and second games again because they're superior.

213
00:14:00,043 --> 00:14:00,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

214
00:14:01,064 --> 00:14:04,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know there's Xbox Live modes, but they're kind of shiny.

215
00:14:04,729 --> 00:14:04,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

216
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:09,054
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's this whole downloadable content, which takes me on another rant for a moment.

217
00:14:09,835 --> 00:14:16,444
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a call to all the other bloggers and podcasters and media types that might listen to this program.

218
00:14:17,432 --> 00:14:25,940
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how the downloadable content on this game has been discovered to simply be another unlock key for items that are already on the disc.

219
00:14:26,361 --> 00:14:27,862
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not like we haven't seen this before.

220
00:14:27,962 --> 00:14:30,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Dance Dance Revolution Universe comes to mind.

221
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:31,205
[SPEAKER_03]: We had that.

222
00:14:31,225 --> 00:14:32,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you think of any others, Loki?

223
00:14:33,528 --> 00:14:38,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Need for Speed, like practically every EA game with the unlockable cheats and stuff.

224
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:42,036
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to no longer call this downloadable content because it's not.

225
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:42,980
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

226
00:15:01,892 --> 00:15:04,913
[SPEAKER_01]: Car Key, you know, this is a download key, whatever.

227
00:15:04,973 --> 00:15:06,493
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense to me to call it that.

228
00:15:06,653 --> 00:15:11,695
[SPEAKER_03]: So, from here on out, on this show, when we discover things like this, we're no longer going to refer to it as downloadable content.

229
00:15:11,755 --> 00:15:16,356
[SPEAKER_03]: When we talk about it, review it on the show, it will now be referred to as pay-to-unlock content, because that's what it is.

230
00:15:16,936 --> 00:15:22,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, downloadable content, actual downloadable content in my mind would be something like Elder Scrolls Oblivion.

231
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:26,779
[SPEAKER_05]: The characters in Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

232
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,440
[SPEAKER_03]: and you weren't just downloading a key for that?

233
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that you were actually downloading the full characters.

234
00:15:32,763 --> 00:15:33,463
[SPEAKER_05]: See, that's the hard thing.

235
00:15:33,483 --> 00:15:35,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they had to release a new version that already had them in it.

236
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,466
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true, that's true.

237
00:15:36,987 --> 00:15:42,411
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be the hard thing about this is that game companies are not up front with this information usually.

238
00:15:42,652 --> 00:15:45,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they prefer it to be seamless to the customer.

239
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:50,438
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just this tiny little show in somebody's spare bedroom, independently run.

240
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:54,182
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm putting a call out there to all the bigger folks who might happen to listen to this program.

241
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:58,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need to start asking developers when they announce this content.

242
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:01,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this downloadable content or is this pay to unlock content?

243
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:07,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying pay to unlock content is necessarily a bad thing, but let's call it what it is.

244
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:14,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not, you know, if you're going to do it this way, I think the consumers have a right to know what it is that they're buying.

245
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:15,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

246
00:16:15,815 --> 00:16:18,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I still bought the pay-to-unlock content in the realm of DDR.

247
00:16:18,756 --> 00:16:20,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought the song pack.

248
00:16:20,738 --> 00:16:21,918
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to stop me from buying it.

249
00:16:21,938 --> 00:16:27,702
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying we have to boycott all pay-to-unlock content, but I think we should be fair and call it what it is, pay-to-unlock content.

250
00:16:28,763 --> 00:16:29,303
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you have it.

251
00:16:30,464 --> 00:16:35,967
[SPEAKER_01]: And that even gets to the whole thing of why the fuck is it locked in anyways and why –

252
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:36,935
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

253
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

254
00:16:59,140 --> 00:16:59,961
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit janky to me.

255
00:16:59,981 --> 00:17:12,292
[SPEAKER_01]: I can understand if you're saying, you know, in those EA games or whatever, where you want to cheat and say, okay, I want to unlock the cheat codes or something like that, and I don't want to play through the game, I'm just going to buy them.

256
00:17:12,612 --> 00:17:15,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, that's fine if you want to do that, because that's your choice.

257
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:23,302
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's stuff that's in the game, which I think Katamaru was too short anyways, and the fact that there was more levels in there, that's kind of funny.

258
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:36,692
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's why this one particularly stings and why we need to put our foot down with this one because I think a lot of people feel, even for considering it was a $40 game and not a $60 game, it was still a little too short.

259
00:17:37,252 --> 00:17:42,874
[SPEAKER_03]: And to have those unlock codes come out not even a week after the game is out is a little bit of a punch to the gut.

260
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:44,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

261
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:46,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just like all the DDR unlock songs.

262
00:17:46,374 --> 00:17:47,235
[SPEAKER_01]: That's stupid too.

263
00:17:47,975 --> 00:17:50,355
[SPEAKER_01]: But I understand why they do that because the licensing stuff.

264
00:17:50,535 --> 00:17:53,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet, at the same time, I also think that they could probably, you know,

265
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:57,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Bundling the licensing cost into the game.

266
00:17:57,628 --> 00:18:02,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't think that five extra songs are really going to cost five extra dollars or something like that.

267
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,532
[SPEAKER_03]: OLArmyBlaze asks, is the $5 horse armor downloadable or unlock content?

268
00:18:08,773 --> 00:18:10,093
[SPEAKER_03]: It's downloadable.

269
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:14,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, granted, it's shitty downloadable content, but it is downloadable content.

270
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:22,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying that downloadable content... There's a perfect example of where downloadable content may not actually be better than pay-to-unlock content.

271
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:25,613
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm just saying, let the consumer know what it really is they're spending their money on.

272
00:18:25,653 --> 00:18:27,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the other thing that people also forget, and...

273
00:18:29,494 --> 00:18:37,535
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty easy to forget it, but if you go to retail kiosks, a lot of this downloadable content that costs you money, like themes and stuff, is actually available for free.

274
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:40,496
[SPEAKER_01]: If you bring your memory unit, and you can download it straight off there.

275
00:18:40,516 --> 00:18:46,157
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when Saints Row came out, they had some downloadable clothes or something that you could get for it, and it was all free on there.

276
00:18:46,357 --> 00:18:51,218
[SPEAKER_01]: It cost you money on live, but it was free from the retail kiosks.

277
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,758
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another option, too.

278
00:18:52,838 --> 00:18:55,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Get one of those memory units and check it every now and then.

279
00:18:55,438 --> 00:18:58,719
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they're trying to do, but they don't advertise that shit, which is annoying.

280
00:18:59,898 --> 00:19:04,140
[SPEAKER_03]: So, from here on out, we'll start on this show, calling it what it is.

281
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,142
[SPEAKER_03]: And I beg of the OL Army and the listeners of this program, spread the word.

282
00:19:08,562 --> 00:19:09,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get it out there.

283
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:13,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's put our foot down as gamers and demand the developers call their releases what they are.

284
00:19:14,205 --> 00:19:17,307
[SPEAKER_03]: And that whole microtransactions thing, we'll save that for another day.

285
00:19:17,327 --> 00:19:19,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Because then you're getting into a whole other ballgame.

286
00:19:20,788 --> 00:19:23,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, that's really pretty much it for my gaming week.

287
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I did play some of the Xbox Live.

288
00:19:25,071 --> 00:19:27,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I should say real quickly, I did play some of the Xbox Live Arcade games.

289
00:19:28,507 --> 00:19:28,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Exit

290
00:19:44,986 --> 00:19:46,587
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

291
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:27,745
[SPEAKER_03]: with the GuitarHero.com site and how you can link your Xbox 360 or from what I understand Wii or PlayStation 2 or 3 whatever versions to the website and you can have like an online band and all this stuff and these online on the web leaderboards.

292
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:29,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like that kind of functionality.

293
00:20:29,947 --> 00:20:32,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that that whole web 2.0 thing to an extent?

294
00:20:33,305 --> 00:20:35,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, what did you think of the changes in interface during gameplay?

295
00:20:59,612 --> 00:21:00,313
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not bad.

296
00:21:01,354 --> 00:21:10,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little hesitant to hearing that Harmonix was not going to be behind it and it was going to be a Neversoft, but considering they built the whole thing from the ground up, it's not bad.

297
00:21:11,401 --> 00:21:14,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hearing things about some frame rate issues that people are having.

298
00:21:14,444 --> 00:21:19,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't noticed it yet, but then again, keep in mind I've only really played like five songs so far.

299
00:21:19,908 --> 00:21:22,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like how it looks a lot better now.

300
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:34,041
[SPEAKER_03]: The cool thing about them having built the thing from scratch is that they didn't just up-res something they had before, as in the case of Guitar Hero 3, it's from the ground up.

301
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:37,247
[SPEAKER_03]: and I love the cartoon stuff in between levels.

302
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:38,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was great.

303
00:21:38,729 --> 00:21:40,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan was saying today, he's like, I love the bassist.

304
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:46,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, honestly, this is kind of like the step up that I think Guitar Hero 2 should have been in a way.

305
00:21:47,376 --> 00:21:50,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I'm saying Guitar Hero 2 is bad, but it's just kind of like there wasn't much there.

306
00:21:50,438 --> 00:21:52,360
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of a rehash of the first game with new songs.

307
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is generally a step in the right direction, but again, I need to spend a little more time with the game.

308
00:21:57,184 --> 00:22:00,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played it online at all, but I'm liking what I see so far.

309
00:22:01,511 --> 00:22:07,234
[SPEAKER_03]: So if chat room, you guys have some comments, chat.orangeloungeradio.com and we'll be reading those.

310
00:22:08,455 --> 00:22:09,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to see what's going on.

311
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:13,938
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of folks were still commenting on the unlock, pay to unlock stuff.

312
00:22:15,398 --> 00:22:20,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Kevin DDR says, pay to unlock is only fine, in my opinion, when you have low or no price for the game.

313
00:22:21,021 --> 00:22:26,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of like Xbox Live Arcade maybe, but usually they don't really do much pay to unlock with Xbox Live Arcade.

314
00:22:26,964 --> 00:22:28,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Or free to unlock.

315
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,285
[SPEAKER_03]: and the only thing you're paying is for the price of Xbox Live Gold or Silver.

316
00:22:33,325 --> 00:22:34,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Silver is free.

317
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:37,710
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I'm talking about like the Dead Rising costumes were free, right?

318
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,472
[SPEAKER_03]: But you had to be connected to Live to download them.

319
00:22:39,712 --> 00:22:44,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think many people have a problem with that and that just kind of is an enhancement for those folks that happen to be on the internet.

320
00:22:44,737 --> 00:22:45,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Rob.

321
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:45,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

322
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:47,560
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's bullshit about Guitar Hero 3?

323
00:22:47,641 --> 00:22:47,801
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

324
00:22:48,421 --> 00:22:49,723
[SPEAKER_05]: They took out Pandora.

325
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:50,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they?

326
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even notice.

327
00:22:51,741 --> 00:22:53,343
[SPEAKER_05]: They put in that stupid Midori.

328
00:22:53,463 --> 00:22:54,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Midori.

329
00:22:54,344 --> 00:22:55,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate her.

330
00:22:55,225 --> 00:22:56,005
[SPEAKER_05]: She's so stupid.

331
00:22:56,185 --> 00:22:57,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I unlocked her green hair.

332
00:22:57,347 --> 00:22:58,047
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

333
00:22:58,167 --> 00:23:01,391
[SPEAKER_05]: I so miss Pandora because she was like the total goth rocker.

334
00:23:01,431 --> 00:23:02,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Pandora was pretty cool.

335
00:23:02,391 --> 00:23:03,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe she's unlocked later.

336
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:04,914
[SPEAKER_05]: She's not an unlockable.

337
00:23:05,755 --> 00:23:07,456
[SPEAKER_05]: She's completely not in it.

338
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:08,197
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

339
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,059
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do have Slash now.

340
00:23:11,132 --> 00:23:16,257
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's get to some housekeeping tonight, and then we'll get into the gaming news.

341
00:23:16,658 --> 00:23:18,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a lot to say for housekeeping tonight.

342
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:29,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to encourage, if you didn't check it out, I mean, now the game's kind of out there, so it might not be as exciting, but on Operator 11, we did do a Guitar Hero 3 retail unboxing after the show last week, and we hope to bring you more stuff like that later.

343
00:23:29,531 --> 00:23:32,594
[SPEAKER_03]: The chat room was asking if maybe we'd play some Guitar Hero 3 after the show tonight.

344
00:23:33,054 --> 00:23:34,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, because I'm kind of...

345
00:23:35,516 --> 00:23:35,896
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com.

346
00:23:56,943 --> 00:23:57,983
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

347
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Guitar Hero 3 Guitar on Guitar Hero 3

348
00:24:45,424 --> 00:24:51,387
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Guitar Hero 2 Explorer model, at least on the 360, does work with both.

349
00:24:51,527 --> 00:24:53,308
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where you need to go.

350
00:24:53,568 --> 00:24:54,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy that one instead.

351
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:01,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, some speculation is, you know, why is it not working?

352
00:25:01,653 --> 00:25:09,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it might be that, you know, Activision's only, in fact, it does say on the box, only official guitars will, you know, work with Guitar Hero 3.

353
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:10,938
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've been known to do this in the past.

354
00:25:11,357 --> 00:25:19,783
[SPEAKER_01]: But Rock Band though, Harmonix has actually come out and said they welcome any third-party software or they support any third-party guitars or accessories, so

355
00:25:40,148 --> 00:25:45,852
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't help but feel like, though, that there's a little bit of, like, jabs going on here with this.

356
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:46,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

357
00:25:46,252 --> 00:25:53,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know if it's just an unfortunate coincidence for these guys, but it does feel a little bit like you wonder if they're taking jabs at each other, which is shit for the consumer.

358
00:25:53,657 --> 00:26:08,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, but I guess according to that quote or whatever I had heard, they were saying, you know, well, we base it off the standard Xbox Live, you know, blah, blah, blah, and if people make their controllers to the Xbox Live specifications, then everything ought to work.

359
00:26:08,107 --> 00:26:08,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

360
00:26:09,261 --> 00:26:13,164
[SPEAKER_03]: But for whatever reason, it doesn't seem to be working in this case, which sucks for us in the end.

361
00:26:13,904 --> 00:26:14,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Not for me, though.

362
00:26:14,605 --> 00:26:17,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I resisted buying the bundle because I already had the Guitar Hero 2 controller.

363
00:26:18,267 --> 00:26:26,913
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a lot of third-party adapters that they have out there that require... Like, for example, the ones that hook up a keyboard and mouse via the USB.

364
00:26:26,933 --> 00:26:34,918
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a wired controller plugged in because it reads that identifier off of the wired controller and thinks it's just a wired controller plugged in.

365
00:26:35,018 --> 00:26:37,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, it wouldn't work either because that platform is not open.

366
00:26:38,401 --> 00:26:38,961
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just...

367
00:26:40,264 --> 00:26:46,827
[SPEAKER_01]: The third-party companies have to license that stuff, so when the homebrew guys decide to make an adapter for it, they have to kind of trick it.

368
00:26:47,427 --> 00:27:00,173
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe, maybe, someone will come up with an adapter for, say, the Rock Band guitar, the hookup to the 360 that also has a wired controller plugged in that will allow you to do this, kind of bootleg it.

369
00:27:00,473 --> 00:27:03,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, in my opinion, the bigger company will hotfix their game to just make it work.

370
00:27:05,175 --> 00:27:07,737
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll find the specifications of the other guitar and just make it work.

371
00:27:08,517 --> 00:27:08,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

372
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:09,982
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see, though.

373
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,649
[SPEAKER_03]: This user named Torchy has started a thread.

374
00:27:33,729 --> 00:27:36,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Warning to those buying Guitar Hero 3 at Walmart.

375
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:41,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Check your bundles packaging carefully before you purchase to ensure the correct guitar is enclosed.

376
00:27:41,532 --> 00:27:43,393
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have included screenshots.

377
00:27:43,513 --> 00:27:49,416
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, there are some bundles of Guitar Hero 3 that come with the classic red SG guitar controller.

378
00:27:50,114 --> 00:27:52,795
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's screenshots all over this thread to prove that it's true.

379
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:56,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, who knows where this is coming from?

380
00:27:56,117 --> 00:28:01,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I would think, well, this box... I mean, I don't think Walmart could have cooked these boxes up themselves.

381
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:08,763
[SPEAKER_03]: So it seems to me like it's some type of agreement with the company in a way for Walmart to stay the low-priced leader or whatever.

382
00:28:08,803 --> 00:28:10,104
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to take some things out.

383
00:28:10,144 --> 00:28:13,225
[SPEAKER_01]: They can sell it probably cheaper than getting rid of some of those older guitars.

384
00:28:13,445 --> 00:28:13,906
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

385
00:28:14,446 --> 00:28:14,626
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

386
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:17,029
[SPEAKER_05]: That's completely false advertising, though.

387
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:17,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.

388
00:28:17,949 --> 00:28:19,190
[SPEAKER_01]: It says it right on the box.

389
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,410
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's false advertising.

390
00:28:20,671 --> 00:28:29,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I wouldn't say it's false advertising, except it's kind of misleading for those of us that have been following this game on the internet, because we never knew that Walmart was going to do ha-ha-ha, switcheroo.

391
00:28:29,715 --> 00:28:36,618
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, some of these people who ran to the store at midnight, picked up the first copy of Guitar Hero 3 on the shelves, like, oh, I've got to get this.

392
00:28:36,658 --> 00:28:40,200
[SPEAKER_03]: And they maybe didn't think to read the box first, because they were just so excited, right?

393
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Who can fault them?

394
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, but hey, here's one thing, though.

395
00:28:42,641 --> 00:28:45,382
[SPEAKER_01]: You can always take it back to Walmart, because they'll take returns on almost anything.

396
00:28:45,482 --> 00:28:46,742
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a very good point.

397
00:28:46,782 --> 00:28:53,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Walmart also has a very liberal return policy, and quite frankly, you ought to tell them, this was not the game I was expecting to buy.

398
00:28:54,205 --> 00:28:55,826
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not the controller that you're looking for.

399
00:28:56,566 --> 00:28:56,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

400
00:28:57,326 --> 00:28:58,407
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there you have it.

401
00:29:00,707 --> 00:29:02,328
[SPEAKER_03]: So, be careful.

402
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:05,509
[SPEAKER_03]: A word of warning to those who are going to be buying their game at Walmart.

403
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:09,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, maybe you ought to just go to Target, Best Buy, GameStop,

404
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Center, for God's sake, sells this game

405
00:29:39,804 --> 00:29:40,884
[SPEAKER_05]: If anybody wants to know.

406
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:42,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to know.

407
00:29:44,726 --> 00:29:46,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to know the highlights.

408
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:48,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Read the songs that jump out at you as awesome inclusions.

409
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:59,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Rolling Stones, Give Me Shelter, and The Who, Won't Get Fooled Again, Boston, Foreplay, Long Time, David Bowie, Suffragette City.

410
00:30:00,491 --> 00:30:02,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this game has David Bowie in it, and I'm happy it wins.

411
00:30:02,732 --> 00:30:05,033
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a cover of Paranoid by Black Sabbath.

412
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:12,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't Fear the Reaper, Blitzkrieg Pop by The Ramones, Detroit Rock City by Kiss, though that makes me happy.

413
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:17,351
[SPEAKER_05]: We've also got Rush's Tom Sawyer, which is one of my favorite songs.

414
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:21,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Faith No More Epic, Pixie's Wave of Mutilation.

415
00:30:23,795 --> 00:30:24,876
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my favorite R.E.M.

416
00:30:24,896 --> 00:30:25,676
[SPEAKER_05]: song, Orange Crush.

417
00:30:27,658 --> 00:30:31,260
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've also got Learn to Fly by Foo Fighters, Inner Sandman, Metallica.

418
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:35,443
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got Weezer's Say It Ain't So, Radiohead Creep, and I love Radiohead.

419
00:30:36,287 --> 00:31:00,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Beastie Boys Sabotage, Black Hole Sun, I Think I'm Paranoid, Celebrity Skin and then for the more current stuff we have OK Go, here it goes again, Nine Inch Nails, The Hand That Feeds Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Danny California, The Killers When You Were Young and then one of the unlockable tracks is Ben Camaro, With Pleasure

420
00:31:01,792 --> 00:31:02,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Random ass thought here.

421
00:31:03,033 --> 00:31:12,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's kind of interesting because two of those bands you named that are in the game, Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails, have been in the news a lot lately about, you know, kind of their defiance of traditional record releasing.

422
00:31:12,576 --> 00:31:16,938
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, obviously Radiohead put out their album in rainbows on the internet for people to pay whatever they want for it.

423
00:31:17,238 --> 00:31:20,120
[SPEAKER_03]: And Nine Inch Nails basically declared their independence from record label recently.

424
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,120
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of gets me thinking.

425
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:29,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this type of Guitar Hero Rock Band thing a possible delivery method, promotional tool of new songs by these artists in the future?

426
00:31:29,444 --> 00:31:31,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, they've already said they want to do that.

427
00:31:31,185 --> 00:31:32,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's pretty rad.

428
00:31:32,026 --> 00:31:39,929
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be releasing whole albums, and they're going to be tying in stuff with MTV, and that is definitely something that's going to happen with Rock Band.

429
00:31:39,949 --> 00:31:40,430
[SPEAKER_01]: You watch.

430
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting little tie-in there.

431
00:31:42,811 --> 00:31:44,171
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty happy with the list, though.

432
00:31:44,912 --> 00:31:45,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to say this, though.

433
00:31:45,992 --> 00:31:47,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I thought you had your hand raised.

434
00:31:48,654 --> 00:31:49,234
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

435
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:50,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, bad radio.

436
00:31:52,392 --> 00:31:53,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say this, though.

437
00:31:53,253 --> 00:31:55,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, Rock Band did not have Heart.

438
00:31:55,835 --> 00:31:56,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

439
00:31:56,135 --> 00:31:56,895
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes me sad.

440
00:31:56,935 --> 00:32:00,418
[SPEAKER_03]: That does make me a little sad, because Guitar Hero 3 did have Barracuda, which was all kinds of awesome.

441
00:32:00,438 --> 00:32:02,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Because pre-'80s Heart was the best.

442
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:02,600
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

443
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,681
[SPEAKER_05]: When they were still that folk rock.

444
00:32:04,781 --> 00:32:05,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.

445
00:32:05,362 --> 00:32:07,003
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, some post-'80s, you know.

446
00:32:07,023 --> 00:32:07,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

447
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,124
[SPEAKER_05]: In the 80s, they had Gem Hair.

448
00:32:09,225 --> 00:32:11,486
[SPEAKER_03]: They did have Alone, too, which was, like, the best song ever.

449
00:32:11,506 --> 00:32:12,107
[SPEAKER_03]: They had Gem Hair.

450
00:32:12,527 --> 00:32:16,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, thank you for the report on Rock Band, DarkSakura.

451
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,070
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's awesome.

452
00:32:17,371 --> 00:32:19,172
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish they would have, like, I don't know.

453
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Prodigy or something in there.

454
00:32:21,471 --> 00:32:22,412
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be pretty awesome.

455
00:32:22,432 --> 00:32:24,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Nine Inch Nails in there.

456
00:32:24,114 --> 00:32:25,416
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really sweet.

457
00:32:26,057 --> 00:32:26,577
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.

458
00:32:26,617 --> 00:32:35,067
[SPEAKER_03]: If like Rock Band does well, I really hope they put out something like something to appease those of us that didn't

459
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Get more Beatmania in the US.

460
00:32:37,961 --> 00:32:41,863
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that's kind of a bit, you know, a lot of the purists for Beatmania are probably going to go, What?

461
00:32:42,303 --> 00:32:48,706
[SPEAKER_03]: But seriously, I would like to see some type of trance dance using the Beatmania concept but improving on it.

462
00:32:48,726 --> 00:32:49,927
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be a lot of fun.

463
00:32:50,287 --> 00:32:53,628
[SPEAKER_03]: But using songs that we know a little more over here maybe.

464
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:56,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to say that songs in Beatmania were bad because they really weren't.

465
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:00,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I do feel the series has gotten a little stale now that we're on, what, 13th, 14th game.

466
00:33:01,052 --> 00:33:03,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to see stuff like Prodigy and all these other...

467
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:06,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Put out a game with Above and Beyond in it, I swear to God I'm so there.

468
00:33:06,314 --> 00:33:08,074
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pay $80 for controller, hands down, I'm there.

469
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:43,603
[SPEAKER_01]: So some other interesting things, and this is kind of something we've talked about before with patents and stuff, and why the hell isn't Konami suing these people for using, obviously since Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania came out way long before Rock Band or Guitar Hero were even around.

470
00:33:44,183 --> 00:33:44,643
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's up?

471
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:54,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, apparently actually Harmonix, and they've been licensing the rights to use this stuff, including the patents for the guitars,

472
00:33:55,866 --> 00:33:58,427
[SPEAKER_01]: are being licensed from Konami.

473
00:33:58,807 --> 00:34:10,750
[SPEAKER_01]: However, for the drum stuff, they're not licensing it since that's actually being, they're using patents from Drumscape, if you remember that MTV arcade drum game that came out a long time ago.

474
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:11,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Vaguely.

475
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,351
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I like saw it once and thought it looked kind of dumb.

476
00:34:14,131 --> 00:34:14,711
[SPEAKER_01]: I never played it.

477
00:34:14,771 --> 00:34:15,952
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was pretty interesting.

478
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:20,253
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, of course, Activision is also licensing the rights for guitars as well.

479
00:34:20,633 --> 00:34:20,793
[SPEAKER_01]: So,

480
00:34:22,076 --> 00:34:28,258
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Konami doesn't need to necessarily bring out the game here because they're making money outside from the sales of these.

481
00:34:28,678 --> 00:34:29,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta go to chat.

482
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:33,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com Legend of Zaku says, Fuck you, Sky.

483
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:37,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Konami needs to do it, not Harmonix Red Octane in regards to Beatmania.

484
00:34:38,521 --> 00:34:40,281
[SPEAKER_03]: If they want to do it, great.

485
00:34:40,601 --> 00:34:43,262
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not going to sit around and wait.

486
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:43,902
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

487
00:34:43,962 --> 00:34:47,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I would totally support Konami doing this.

488
00:34:47,223 --> 00:34:48,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish they would.

489
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:49,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they could do an awesome job with it.

490
00:34:50,244 --> 00:34:50,884
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're not.

491
00:34:51,678 --> 00:34:56,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're testing 2DX Gold in America, but that's not going to do it.

492
00:34:58,058 --> 00:35:01,699
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of us that have been hardcore into Balmani for a long time, yeah, that's awesome news.

493
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:06,401
[SPEAKER_03]: But where did Guitar Hero succeed where Guitar Freaks did not?

494
00:35:06,761 --> 00:35:14,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Hero brought songs everybody knew and everybody wanted to play and people wanted to rock out in their living room to well-known songs.

495
00:35:14,824 --> 00:35:20,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless Konami is willing to invest a little money in a powerhouse song list, not going to happen.

496
00:35:20,026 --> 00:35:20,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

497
00:35:20,766 --> 00:35:23,267
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just – to me, that's fact.

498
00:35:23,743 --> 00:35:26,285
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's based on the success of Guitar Hero.

499
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:27,006
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

500
00:35:27,026 --> 00:35:36,594
[SPEAKER_03]: But if Konami wants to step up their game on Beatmania, I totally support it and I think they could kick some major ass and beat these other guys to the punch and show us why Konami was first.

501
00:35:36,714 --> 00:35:37,755
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they should bring it over.

502
00:35:37,775 --> 00:35:38,276
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they will.

503
00:35:38,296 --> 00:35:38,836
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they will.

504
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:47,183
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they should because to be honest, Konami, especially in their, you know, Bimani, you know, line, has not been innovative in the last like 10 years.

505
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:49,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, I mean, what have we seen come out of there?

506
00:35:50,006 --> 00:35:50,266
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean...

507
00:35:51,698 --> 00:36:00,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Extreme, and Supernova, and the Universe series, and hell, Hottest Party, that shit is not innovative at all.

508
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:03,346
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just fucking copying and pasting shit from other games.

509
00:36:04,227 --> 00:36:11,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree and I don't, because I actually thought some of the single player modes in Ultramix, I love Ultramix too, that's my favorite freaking Ultramix ever.

510
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:12,312
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not talking about Ultramix.

511
00:36:12,312 --> 00:36:12,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

512
00:36:27,759 --> 00:36:28,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay to unlock packs.

513
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay to unlock packs.

514
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:30,520
[SPEAKER_01]: My mistake.

515
00:36:31,181 --> 00:36:31,281
[SPEAKER_01]: One.

516
00:36:31,861 --> 00:36:33,402
[SPEAKER_01]: One is the only thing that they had for it.

517
00:36:33,422 --> 00:36:36,344
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, later on they could have had different unlock packs and stuff, but no.

518
00:36:36,684 --> 00:36:41,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, they're going to just release another retail version of the game six months later because, you know what?

519
00:36:41,886 --> 00:36:45,188
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make money off of it a lot more than you would those download packs.

520
00:36:45,728 --> 00:36:48,210
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, this is what they did with Karaoke Revolution.

521
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:53,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear you and I don't because I feel like Guitar Hero 2 kind of did the same thing with the first Guitar Hero.

522
00:36:53,532 --> 00:36:53,973
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

523
00:36:53,993 --> 00:36:54,193
[SPEAKER_03]: They did.

524
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:54,573
[SPEAKER_01]: They did.

525
00:36:54,873 --> 00:36:55,213
[SPEAKER_01]: They did.

526
00:36:55,494 --> 00:36:57,956
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and they did it with the Rock the 80s thing.

527
00:36:58,196 --> 00:36:59,938
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they were just trying to make more money on the side.

528
00:37:00,038 --> 00:37:03,741
[SPEAKER_01]: And, yeah, they haven't innovated either, but that's the thing.

529
00:37:04,042 --> 00:37:09,146
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why Guitar Hero 3 is very encouraging to me so far because I see, like, this online thing.

530
00:37:10,227 --> 00:37:12,930
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see, like, okay, this really feels like a step up.

531
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:17,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Konami needs to take a page out of what's going on here, hand it off to some other developers.

532
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:17,934
[SPEAKER_03]: But see, that's the thing, though.

533
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:18,335
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like...

534
00:37:18,923 --> 00:37:24,949
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get excited about their arcade releases because that's some cool stuff that they're doing there.

535
00:37:25,269 --> 00:37:30,594
[SPEAKER_01]: But when their home releases come out, nowadays I don't give a shit.

536
00:37:30,634 --> 00:37:32,455
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, ooh, another DDR game.

537
00:37:32,475 --> 00:37:33,336
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.

538
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:36,519
[SPEAKER_01]: But who cares?

539
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:39,402
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like something I'm running out to the store and going to buy.

540
00:37:39,962 --> 00:37:43,986
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to because it was really exciting to see all these new songs and stuff.

541
00:37:44,046 --> 00:37:44,146
[SPEAKER_01]: But

542
00:37:44,915 --> 00:37:49,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's just so watered down, they just don't care anymore, it seems like.

543
00:37:49,277 --> 00:37:51,177
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, whatever, you know, it's DDR.

544
00:37:51,237 --> 00:37:56,819
[SPEAKER_01]: People will buy it because you'll exercise to it and stuff, and that's the crowd that they're going after.

545
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:58,580
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't care about the people that like the game.

546
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight's show is very interesting.

547
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,941
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a throwback to our old days.

548
00:38:02,361 --> 00:38:04,482
[SPEAKER_03]: For those that may not know, check us out the first time.

549
00:38:05,402 --> 00:38:08,523
[SPEAKER_03]: The first three years of our show or so, we were all about strictly...

550
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:13,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Music-based games and talking about the DDR community and tournaments and then other things going on.

551
00:38:14,347 --> 00:38:16,729
[SPEAKER_03]: So very interesting tonight that we have all this music gaming news.

552
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:18,710
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a real throwback to our heyday.

553
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:21,412
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we sound really passionate about these issues, it's because we are.

554
00:38:22,053 --> 00:38:23,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, myself, DarkSakura, you know how we met?

555
00:38:25,115 --> 00:38:26,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Golf Land, DDR.

556
00:38:26,736 --> 00:38:30,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Road trips to Miggle in the Bay to play Beatmania 2DX.

557
00:38:31,179 --> 00:38:32,840
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how we should.

558
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a throwback road tour.

559
00:38:36,822 --> 00:38:39,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to make it a regular thing again.

560
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:43,432
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

561
00:39:03,669 --> 00:39:05,430
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the core part of any DDR game.

562
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,251
[SPEAKER_03]: If it has a shitty song list, you're not going to want to play it.

563
00:39:07,671 --> 00:39:10,993
[SPEAKER_03]: So make what you will of this song list for DDR Universe 2.

564
00:39:11,193 --> 00:39:13,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to read the whole thing, but let me tell you some of the licenses.

[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know yet.

576

[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I bet you it is.

577
00:40:00,793 --> 00:40:04,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you it is, too, because that's why we already have the songs for it.

[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there's Cars Mater National, which is a sequel to the Cars game that came out last year, which sucked, by the way.

595
00:42:39,427 --> 00:42:45,690
[SPEAKER_01]: That was another one of those launch racing games that, God knows, blew for the Wii.

611
00:43:34,681 --> 00:43:36,802
[SPEAKER_03]: What exactly does Barbie do in Island Princess?

612
00:43:36,882 --> 00:43:38,803
[SPEAKER_01]: It's based off some DVD that came out.

613
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:42,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Does she vote off her friends off the island one at a time?

614
00:43:43,445 --> 00:43:46,087
[SPEAKER_03]: And who is the prettiest supremacy?

623
00:44:53,868 --> 00:44:55,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Pixar can do no wrong.

624
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:56,170
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

625
00:44:56,451 --> 00:44:57,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Pixar can do no wrong.

00:44:58,313 --> 00:44:58,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

627
00:44:59,114 --> 00:44:59,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

628
00:45:00,435 --> 00:45:03,839
[SPEAKER_03]: In the video game realm, they've licensed their stuff out questionably before.

629
00:45:04,339 --> 00:45:05,400
[SPEAKER_05]: But Pixar didn't do it.

630
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,581
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

631
00:45:06,622 --> 00:45:08,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Pixar themselves can do no wrong.

632
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,965
[SPEAKER_03]: It's THQ that released it.

633
00:45:10,506 --> 00:45:11,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, THQ can do some wrong.

634
00:45:12,187 --> 00:45:13,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully they won't.

635
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:14,630
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have faith.

636
00:45:15,814 --> 00:45:15,934
[SPEAKER_03]: XBOX 360

00:45:40,857 --> 00:45:43,261

[SPEAKER_03]: Opuna is coming out in Japan on the 1st of November as well as Super Mario Galaxy.

639
00:45:49,172 --> 00:45:50,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Opuna looked weird.

640
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:53,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't that that one where you control the entire game with like the nunchuck?

641
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:55,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that is the game, yes.

642
00:45:56,261 --> 00:45:57,222
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll pull up more information.

643
00:45:57,743 --> 00:45:58,603

00:46:29,826 --> 00:46:30,426
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

656
00:46:30,646 --> 00:46:30,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

657
00:46:30,887 --> 00:46:32,127
[SPEAKER_01]: They're making an anime series now, too.

658
00:46:32,527 --> 00:46:33,207
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of cool.

659
00:46:34,108 --> 00:46:36,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I played one of the Robot Taisen games that had the Eva...

660
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:37,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Units in it.

661
00:46:37,931 --> 00:46:38,491
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty cool.

662
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:41,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I forgot to mention a couple also in the U.S.

663

[SPEAKER_01]: Disney's High School Musical, the game.

664

[SPEAKER_01]: Let's give that for Shane.

00:46:45,956 --> 00:46:48,018
[SPEAKER_01]: High School Musical Sing It on PlayStation 2.

666
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:50,359
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I bought Shane for his birthday?

667
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:50,600
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

668
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Just going on a total tangent here.

669
00:46:52,141 --> 00:46:57,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought him tickets to see High School Musical on ice here in Sacramento, and then he moved to Kansas.

670
00:46:57,885 --> 00:46:58,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go with you.

671
00:46:58,866 --> 00:46:59,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

672
00:46:59,286 --> 00:47:01,407
[SPEAKER_03]: He has to send me the tickets because it's this weekend.

673
00:47:01,728 --> 00:47:02,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, dude, tell him this in the back.

674
00:47:02,548 --> 00:47:03,469
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think he stole his tickets.

675
00:47:03,889 --> 00:47:05,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell them to FedEx it.

676
00:47:05,149 --> 00:47:05,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go with you.

677
00:47:05,609 --> 00:47:07,470
[SPEAKER_03]: FedEx me your birthday present because Jamie and I are going.

678
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:08,050
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go.

679
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:08,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll totally go.

680
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:10,771
[SPEAKER_03]: You really want to go see a high school musical on ice?

681
00:47:10,811 --> 00:47:11,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to go do something.

682
00:47:11,971 --> 00:47:12,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

683
00:47:12,531 --> 00:47:16,012
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just going to... I've never been to see anything on ice.

684
00:47:16,372 --> 00:47:19,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this is going to sound really wrong, but it just sounds so gay.

685
00:47:20,033 --> 00:47:20,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go.

686
00:47:21,013 --> 00:47:26,034
[SPEAKER_01]: I petition that they have Manhunt 2 on ice because that would be something I would like to see.

687
00:47:26,054 --> 00:47:26,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Blood bounces.

688
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:31,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even think I could get my boyfriend to go see a high school musical on ice with me.

689
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:31,860
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how gay it is.

690
00:47:48,664 --> 00:47:52,466
[SPEAKER_05]: My mom used to be an amateur roller skater and did figure roller skating.

691
00:47:52,527 --> 00:47:53,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Roller skating is fine.

692
00:47:54,027 --> 00:47:55,588
[SPEAKER_01]: I still don't like the figure skating part.

693
00:47:55,648 --> 00:47:56,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Roller derby is cool, though.

694
00:47:57,009 --> 00:47:58,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it's kind of lame.

695
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:01,452
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a roller derby team in Sacramento that they wanted me to audition for.

696
00:48:02,253 --> 00:48:02,753
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.

697
00:48:02,853 --> 00:48:03,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I could punch people.

698
00:48:03,793 --> 00:48:04,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be good at it.

699
00:48:05,274 --> 00:48:05,735
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, though?

700
00:48:05,755 --> 00:48:08,036
[SPEAKER_05]: You totally reminded me of something I didn't mention in my gaming week.

701
00:48:08,156 --> 00:48:08,316
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

702
00:48:08,596 --> 00:48:10,398
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Ace Combat 6 with a controller.

703
00:48:10,598 --> 00:48:11,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, how's that going?

704
00:48:11,918 --> 00:48:14,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I get totally motion sick on it, but it's really cool.

705
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:15,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

706
00:48:16,201 --> 00:48:17,462
[SPEAKER_05]: The controller's really nice.

707
00:48:18,012 --> 00:48:20,734
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how they could get more people to go to E4ALL next year?

708
00:48:21,575 --> 00:48:22,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Put it on ice.

709
00:48:23,636 --> 00:48:24,557
[SPEAKER_03]: E4ALL on ice.

710
00:48:24,597 --> 00:48:25,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never been ice skating, Rob.

711
00:48:25,858 --> 00:48:26,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

712
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:27,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never been ice skating.

713
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I hear E4ALL might get put on ice anyway.

714
00:48:29,421 --> 00:48:32,303
[SPEAKER_03]: You've never been ice skating at all?

715
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:32,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Never.

716
00:48:33,084 --> 00:48:33,644
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go.

717
00:48:34,365 --> 00:48:34,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

718
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:36,446
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to for this Christmas.

719
00:48:36,927 --> 00:48:37,868
[SPEAKER_03]: When my leg gets better, though.

720
00:48:37,888 --> 00:48:38,708
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't do it this week.

721
00:48:38,748 --> 00:48:41,811
[SPEAKER_03]: But when my leg gets better, we'll go ice skating for sure.

722
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:43,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in time for the holidays.

723
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:45,153
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've been water skiing.

724
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:46,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times.

725
00:48:46,815 --> 00:48:47,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Skating sucks.

726
00:48:47,901 --> 00:48:48,341
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate it.

727
00:48:48,742 --> 00:48:49,262
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried it.

728
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:50,303
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.

729
00:48:50,723 --> 00:48:51,304
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's lame.

730
00:48:51,324 --> 00:48:52,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really good at roller skating though.

731
00:48:52,985 --> 00:48:54,607
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to be able to do all kinds of stuff.

732
00:48:54,727 --> 00:48:56,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Gerardimo says roller skating on ice.

733
00:48:56,548 --> 00:48:58,650
[SPEAKER_03]: And Tigerclaw says DDR on ice.

734
00:48:59,110 --> 00:48:59,311
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

735
00:48:59,451 --> 00:48:59,971
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it.

736
00:49:00,051 --> 00:49:00,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not want.

737
00:49:00,672 --> 00:49:02,353
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says Mario Kart on ice.

738
00:49:02,553 --> 00:49:02,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait.

739
00:49:03,054 --> 00:49:04,155
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually have those stages.

740
00:49:04,795 --> 00:49:05,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

741
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:28,611
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never been kart racing out here.

742
00:49:28,851 --> 00:49:30,152
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a membership there.

743
00:49:30,192 --> 00:49:34,255
[SPEAKER_05]: The last time I did anything on a go-kart was Autopia at Disneyland, my first time going.

744
00:49:34,436 --> 00:49:34,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

745
00:49:34,796 --> 00:49:35,957
[SPEAKER_05]: And I haven't done Autopia since.

746
00:49:36,177 --> 00:49:36,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

747
00:49:36,657 --> 00:49:41,521
[SPEAKER_05]: And before that, it was at the Miracle Strip in Panama City, Florida, which they tore down the Miracle Strip.

748
00:49:41,901 --> 00:49:43,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I never go on Autopia.

749
00:49:43,182 --> 00:49:44,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it on a track?

750
00:49:44,183 --> 00:49:47,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it on a... Yeah, it is, but they had this thing that was called like...

751
00:49:49,368 --> 00:49:52,129
[SPEAKER_05]: It was another car type thing, but you could actually drive these little cars.

752
00:49:52,509 --> 00:49:55,690
[SPEAKER_05]: And you had a set path that they went on, but they weren't on a track.

753
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:57,250
[SPEAKER_05]: So you could actually run into people.

754
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:57,870
[SPEAKER_05]: It was great.

755
00:49:58,110 --> 00:49:58,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, internets.

756
00:49:59,111 --> 00:50:05,072
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about Japanese release dates, and suddenly we got into RPM motor racing and all that stuff.

757
00:50:05,952 --> 00:50:07,073
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why they listened to us.

758
00:50:07,173 --> 00:50:09,633
[SPEAKER_05]: And the chat room is still going into crap on ice.

759
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:10,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

760
00:50:10,754 --> 00:50:11,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Violent fight on ice.

761
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma says Pokemon on ice.

762
00:50:13,674 --> 00:50:14,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I think they have that.

763
00:50:14,714 --> 00:50:15,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they've done that.

764
00:50:15,415 --> 00:50:16,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they've done that, yeah.

765
00:50:17,253 --> 00:50:19,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see that picture on... I'm never going to get these dates on.

766
00:50:19,256 --> 00:50:20,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see that picture on Dig this week?

767
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:26,808
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole thing with... It was the picture of Pikachu and it looked like he had a vagine.

768
00:50:28,094 --> 00:50:32,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, somebody in the chat room, please dig up that picture, because Loki and DarkSakura are giving me blank stares right now.

769
00:50:32,776 --> 00:50:35,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to show them the Pikachu picture that was on Dig earlier this week.

770
00:50:35,218 --> 00:50:35,718
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so funny.

771
00:50:35,738 --> 00:50:37,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Did he have, like, camel toe?

772
00:50:37,759 --> 00:50:41,821
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but it was like a giant, like, blow-up Pikachu, like at an amusement park.

773
00:50:41,841 --> 00:50:42,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen that one.

774
00:50:42,361 --> 00:50:46,143
[SPEAKER_03]: And all these kids were going in, but it looked like... They were going in his crotch.

775
00:50:46,183 --> 00:50:48,944
[SPEAKER_03]: They were going in a big Pikagina.

776
00:50:52,445 --> 00:50:53,166
[SPEAKER_05]: That was great.

777
00:50:53,206 --> 00:50:55,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think you put that on your... Do not want...

778
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:58,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Trauma Center on Icewind.

779
00:50:58,368 --> 00:50:58,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

780
00:50:58,768 --> 00:51:00,649
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to finish the Japanese release dates.

781
00:51:00,689 --> 00:51:01,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.

782
00:51:01,209 --> 00:51:02,069
[SPEAKER_03]: That would help, Rob.

783
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:07,171
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Nintendo DS this week in Japan, Dragon Tamer, Sound Spirits.

784
00:51:09,392 --> 00:51:11,353
[SPEAKER_03]: How in the hell am I supposed to pronounce this this week?

785
00:51:11,773 --> 00:51:18,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Zaiden Hojen Nippon Kanji Noriyuku Kenti Kyokai Koshiki Soft 250 Manin no Kanken.

786
00:51:21,297 --> 00:51:21,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

787
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:41,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Just movies.

788
00:51:41,651 --> 00:51:42,412
[SPEAKER_03]: No games this week.

789
00:51:42,492 --> 00:51:44,774
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you want to pick up Gremlins, it's out this week.

790
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:46,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Gremlins is the best movie ever.

791
00:51:46,635 --> 00:51:47,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I suggest you do.

792
00:51:47,556 --> 00:51:49,557
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot something I played this week.

793
00:51:49,998 --> 00:51:51,158
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is worth mentioning.

794
00:51:51,219 --> 00:51:57,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to derail the whole show here, but I downloaded a CDI emulator.

795
00:51:57,363 --> 00:51:57,663
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

796
00:51:58,204 --> 00:52:03,808
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have a ROM online for Super Mario Wacky Worlds.

797
00:52:03,908 --> 00:52:06,830
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an unreleased game that is awful.

798
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:09,052
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so horrible.

799
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:32,666
[SPEAKER_01]: and I played it for about 5 minutes here's the picture Loki oh that's pretty bad oh my god oh my god it was so horrible basically they just ripped the sprites and music out of Super Mario World and just took a dump on it and that's basically what it was horrible SSJ100Matt asks worse than Hotel Mario?

800
00:52:32,726 --> 00:52:37,949
[SPEAKER_03]: well maybe not GS68 says you're just pissing in an ocean of piss I know

801
00:52:41,845 --> 00:52:45,046
[SPEAKER_03]: They did have all the Zelda games on there too, if you want to play them.

802
00:52:45,247 --> 00:52:50,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God we'll move on with the show just after I say that Opuna does look to be that game I think you were thinking about.

803
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:52,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, wait, no, it's a role-playing game.

804
00:52:52,651 --> 00:52:53,492
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a role-playing game.

805
00:52:54,552 --> 00:52:55,373
[SPEAKER_03]: But it looks cute.

806
00:52:55,893 --> 00:52:56,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they release that over here.

807
00:52:56,974 --> 00:52:59,115
[SPEAKER_03]: It's by Koei, and there's the little box art.

808
00:52:59,315 --> 00:53:00,896
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what Koei gave us, Rob?

809
00:53:01,877 --> 00:53:04,078
[SPEAKER_05]: They gave us that game with the girl riding a missile.

810
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:05,639
[SPEAKER_05]: KO Flying Squadron.

811
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:09,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I could say something about girls riding missiles, but I won't.

812
00:53:09,863 --> 00:53:11,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, that was the best game ever.

813
00:53:11,103 --> 00:53:12,964
[SPEAKER_03]: In light of moving on with our program.

814
00:53:13,424 --> 00:53:18,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Forza 2 downloadable content has a price cut because people bitched about it enough.

815
00:53:20,006 --> 00:53:30,570
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Twin Ring Motegi track is going to be decreased from 600 points to 400 points because you're paying too much.

816
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:36,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Funny, because when we complained about the Guitar Hero download content,

817
00:53:37,783 --> 00:53:38,883
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't seem to care.

818
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:42,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, we're selling plenty of it.

819
00:53:42,364 --> 00:53:42,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up.

820
00:53:44,885 --> 00:53:45,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways.

821
00:53:46,845 --> 00:53:49,386
[SPEAKER_01]: So an interesting rumor has come out this week.

822
00:53:50,006 --> 00:54:05,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently someone who had gotten their 360 returned back from Microsoft after being repaired noticed that there was a few additional options in their dashboard, including stuff for the 360's IPTV feature that was announced earlier.

823
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:09,066
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say Tokyo Game Sh... Not Tokyo Game Show, um...

824
00:54:09,895 --> 00:54:11,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumer Electronics Show, I think, this year.

825
00:54:12,096 --> 00:54:14,117
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either that or Game Developers Conference.

826
00:54:14,277 --> 00:54:17,339
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, one of those shows earlier this year.

827
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,040
[SPEAKER_01]: It was announced.

828
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Good reporting, Loki.

829
00:54:20,461 --> 00:54:21,001
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent reporting.

830
00:54:21,021 --> 00:54:21,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

831
00:54:21,381 --> 00:54:21,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, anyways.

832
00:54:22,702 --> 00:54:30,366
[SPEAKER_01]: So apparently it's going to have different features, including being able to pause and record stuff being streamed off there.

833
00:54:31,907 --> 00:54:36,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, none of these features really worked on it, but it's interesting to see that that's actually...

834
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:42,852
[SPEAKER_01]: in his dashboard now, so most likely going to be included in the fall update.

835
00:54:44,633 --> 00:54:47,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what I want to know is how the hell did that happen in the first place?

836
00:54:47,914 --> 00:54:50,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, how did some guy get this random update?

837
00:54:50,695 --> 00:54:57,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because I guess if he shipped his Xbox back, did they just send him a new Xbox that were meant to be held off until the update goes live or whatever?

838
00:54:58,118 --> 00:55:00,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, because it doesn't look like it's the entire update.

839
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:03,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, like, they had an updated firmware or something like that that's

840
00:55:05,022 --> 00:55:07,243
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know when exactly the fall update is rolling out.

841
00:55:07,283 --> 00:55:08,825
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably within the next few weeks.

842
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:11,326
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're just probably getting it ready to go.

843
00:55:11,947 --> 00:55:18,552
[SPEAKER_03]: What I would be curious of is that in light of this news, I wonder if other people that are getting their consoles back from Microsoft are going to find the same thing.

844
00:55:18,832 --> 00:55:23,515
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my LiveJournal friends just had to send back their Xbox for Red Rings of Death, so I wonder if his is going to come back with that.

845
00:55:24,356 --> 00:55:24,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

846
00:55:25,177 --> 00:55:26,518
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

847
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:28,299
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting.

848
00:55:28,459 --> 00:55:30,781
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to have the IPTV stuff because...

849
00:55:31,542 --> 00:55:32,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, more shows to watch.

850
00:55:33,424 --> 00:55:42,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I'm not too familiar with Microsoft's IPTV service, so... I haven't been able to stay on... I'm actually very unhappy that my place that I usually watch TV online is going away.

851
00:55:42,952 --> 00:55:43,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Aww.

852
00:55:43,593 --> 00:55:46,475
[SPEAKER_05]: TVlinks.co.uk They got shut down?

853
00:55:46,936 --> 00:55:47,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're on their way.

854
00:55:48,117 --> 00:55:51,640
[SPEAKER_03]: They went the way of Oink, which was another big, huge news story this week.

855
00:55:53,562 --> 00:55:53,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

856
00:55:55,023 --> 00:55:56,684
[SPEAKER_05]: How else am I going to watch bullshit?

857
00:55:58,186 --> 00:55:58,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

858
00:55:59,673 --> 00:56:00,554
[SPEAKER_03]: MiniNova or something?

859
00:56:00,574 --> 00:56:00,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

860
00:56:00,935 --> 00:56:09,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, going back to the Xbox Live Marketplace and other Xbox news, Blue Dragon, which is a game I need to go back and finish, has some new content.

861
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently there is a new...

862
00:56:14,547 --> 00:56:16,369
[SPEAKER_03]: 6 Treasure Pack for Blue Dragon.

863
00:56:16,629 --> 00:56:22,533
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to pay 200 points for it, but you get some new items that will allow you to boost abilities.

864
00:56:23,054 --> 00:56:29,999
[SPEAKER_03]: So it sounds like this is some pay to unlock content for me, because you're going to get a Whimsical Mind, which randomly enhances...

865
00:56:30,683 --> 00:56:33,185
[SPEAKER_03]: The Way of Thieves The DV Phonograph

866
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:48,014
[SPEAKER_03]: The Nothing Glasses.

867
00:56:48,514 --> 00:56:53,696
[SPEAKER_03]: It visualizes all those points, because you can search everywhere in this game.

868
00:56:53,736 --> 00:57:00,619
[SPEAKER_03]: It will allow you to actually see the points that you can search with little star symbols, instead of just going around aimlessly.

869
00:57:01,579 --> 00:57:04,780
[SPEAKER_03]: The Shuffled Helmet, that will adjust magical and speed parameters.

870
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:08,782
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Spring Wind Scarf, which will adjust HP and speed parameters by 20%.

871
00:57:09,482 --> 00:57:13,164
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, you're going to pay 200 points to make the game a lot easier, it sounds like to me.

872
00:57:13,524 --> 00:57:13,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is...

873
00:57:15,043 --> 00:57:16,304
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

874
00:57:33,047 --> 00:57:37,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I just want to mention real quick, Spider-Man 3 has a new unlock as well.

875
00:57:37,949 --> 00:57:46,193
[SPEAKER_03]: You get to download New Goblin, and this is notable because it was a PlayStation 3 exclusive feature, but now for 240 Microsoft points, you can have it on 360.

876
00:57:47,314 --> 00:57:48,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I heard, by the way, is lame.

877
00:57:50,075 --> 00:57:50,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't know.

878
00:57:50,595 --> 00:57:57,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to avoid games based off of movies unless they're really good, which I can't even think of any off the top of my head.

879
00:57:57,478 --> 00:58:02,441
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why you would still have Spider-Man 3 anyways, because I think that game really sucked, and so...

880
00:58:04,267 --> 00:58:06,048
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably not worth anything right now anyways.

881
00:58:07,149 --> 00:58:12,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for our friends in Japan, the Xbox 360 is getting a price cut.

882
00:58:14,154 --> 00:58:14,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally.

883
00:58:15,214 --> 00:58:17,396
[SPEAKER_05]: We knew it would eventually happen.

884
00:58:17,976 --> 00:58:24,841
[SPEAKER_05]: The price cut is going to happen on November 1st, and it should be the equivalent of $243.

885
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:25,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that's a big cut.

886
00:58:25,521 --> 00:58:25,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

887
00:58:25,622 --> 00:58:25,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

888
00:58:25,762 --> 00:58:25,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

889
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:33,220
[SPEAKER_03]: And this would be also why all those games I read earlier are getting a cut as well.

890
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,360
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure this all ties in.

891
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:40,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Make the Xbox 360 a little more cheap and maybe it can get a little steam in Japan.

892
00:58:40,302 --> 00:58:42,982
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a few 360 games that are going to be dropping in price.

893
00:58:43,262 --> 00:58:44,423
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember which ones.

894
00:58:44,583 --> 00:58:46,783
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also know that there's some being discontinued.

895
00:58:46,803 --> 00:58:49,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Perfect Dark Zero is one of them.

896
00:58:49,844 --> 00:58:50,284
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember.

897
00:58:50,504 --> 00:58:51,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Good riddance, I'm sorry.

898
00:58:53,005 --> 00:58:56,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Make way for Perfect Dark Zero 2 now.

899
00:58:56,865 --> 00:58:57,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Please no.

900
00:58:58,126 --> 00:58:59,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you still can't jump.

901
00:59:00,384 --> 00:59:01,064
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking hate that.

902
00:59:01,144 --> 00:59:01,904
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing.

903
00:59:02,464 --> 00:59:03,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Next-gen system, no jumping.

904
00:59:04,565 --> 00:59:10,486
[SPEAKER_01]: But one game you can jump quite far in, actually, is Burnout Paradise, which is going to be coming to the U.S.

905
00:59:11,046 --> 00:59:12,967
[SPEAKER_01]: in January, on the 22nd.

906
00:59:13,727 --> 00:59:19,388
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is going to feature an open-world environment, which is going to be kind of interesting, because I know none of the other games have been like that.

907
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:28,330
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can basically drive around aimlessly, really fast, smash into stuff, jump through the air, explode, all the fun stuff that you would be looking for in a Burnout game.

908
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:29,170
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

909
00:59:30,197 --> 00:59:42,925
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems that publishers are starting to get a little smart in releasing stuff in these slow months like January and February and the entire summer instead of just March and November and October.

910
00:59:43,966 --> 00:59:50,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm liking this whole trend lately where it seems like game companies are learning there's 12 months in a year.

911
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:52,031
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of exciting.

912
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,952
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to seriously do that because...

913
00:59:55,017 --> 00:59:56,158
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

914
01:00:18,447 --> 01:00:22,490
[SPEAKER_03]: That caters to a crowd that's going to probably go out and pick up a game whenever they damn well feel like it.

915
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:25,932
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think they're going to take a loss by releasing this in January.

916
01:00:26,052 --> 01:00:32,957
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's good, though, that it's coming out in January and not, like, say, you know, November when there's a ton of shit coming out.

917
01:00:33,197 --> 01:00:37,219
[SPEAKER_01]: In, like, January, I mean, January's actually looking pretty good game-wise so far.

918
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:44,124
[SPEAKER_01]: They have NFL Tour, Devil May Cry 4, God knows what else, and then as well as, you know, this now.

919
01:00:44,642 --> 01:00:54,615
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if they put in a month that there's really nothing coming out, people are going to buy that game instead of saying, well, I'm going to buy this one instead and save my money and then later on they may just decide not to pick it up.

920
01:00:55,957 --> 01:00:56,237
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

921
01:00:58,892 --> 01:01:01,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, some other games that you might be able to play through the Christmas season.

922
01:01:01,173 --> 01:01:05,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And speaking of games that are geared at little kids, although I bet some big kids would like this too.

923
01:01:05,634 --> 01:01:08,934
[SPEAKER_03]: THQ has announced they are bringing four new games to Xbox Live Arcade.

924
01:01:09,395 --> 01:01:13,035
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of these are very notable because they tie into Nickelodeon licenses.

925
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:18,197
[SPEAKER_03]: SpongeBob SquarePants Underpants Slam is coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.

926
01:01:18,517 --> 01:01:19,337
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to admit...

927
01:01:20,034 --> 01:01:21,235
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

928
01:01:42,981 --> 01:01:49,226
[SPEAKER_03]: It does kind of open up Xbox Live Arcade to being, you know, a lot of times Microsoft takes some shit for not being very kid-friendly.

929
01:01:49,666 --> 01:01:56,571
[SPEAKER_03]: And certainly, you know Microsoft's going to be pushing this, especially with their new Xbox 360 Arcade console, really pushing the family thing.

930
01:01:56,731 --> 01:01:58,492
[SPEAKER_03]: When Scenic comes out and all that.

931
01:01:58,752 --> 01:02:00,093
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of their marketing.

932
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,455
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a whole family marketing plan that includes that.

933
01:02:02,535 --> 01:02:12,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Scenic, DDR Universe, actually Guitar Hero 3, and then these titles as well, Viva Pinata Party, and then of course the Xbox Live Arcade stuff.

934
01:02:13,357 --> 01:02:17,279
[SPEAKER_01]: and I know they did some other announcements about cartoons and stuff.

935
01:02:18,499 --> 01:02:25,002
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, the other games that THQ is going to be releasing, a game called Screwjumper, Elements of Destruction, and Rocket Riot.

936
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:30,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Spongebob and Screwjumper, that's kind of an odd name, but they are both scheduled for release next month.

937
01:02:31,184 --> 01:02:32,345
[SPEAKER_03]: So they'll be here in time for Christmas.

938
01:02:32,365 --> 01:02:33,545
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what the world needs less of?

939
01:02:34,706 --> 01:02:35,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Spongebob.

940
01:02:36,731 --> 01:02:39,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Elements of Destruction I know is coming out in the DS next year as well.

941
01:02:39,893 --> 01:02:44,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Screwjumper, if you want to know what the hell that is, it's a vertical action racing game.

942
01:02:44,275 --> 01:02:46,456
[SPEAKER_03]: That's per an interview from the developers.

943
01:02:46,776 --> 01:02:54,160
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to destroy alien mining equipment and architecture while plummeting downward in a continual rapid freefall descent.

944
01:02:54,660 --> 01:03:05,626
[SPEAKER_03]: The objective of the game is to maximize score by crashing into and dynamiting as many alien structures as possible on the way down the mineshaft, then to initiate a detonation and race back to safety on the planet's surface.

945
01:03:05,966 --> 01:03:08,147
[SPEAKER_03]: So honestly, this sounds like it might not be bad.

946
01:03:08,207 --> 01:03:11,569
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got aliens, it's got explosions, it's fast, it's racing.

947
01:03:11,889 --> 01:03:13,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Screwjumper might be pretty awesome.

948
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:13,810
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see, though.

949
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:16,612
[SPEAKER_03]: But sometimes games that seem awesome in theory really suck.

950
01:03:16,772 --> 01:03:20,694
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to hold out until the demo's out this November.

951
01:03:21,417 --> 01:03:22,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Down with Pants

952
01:03:47,779 --> 01:03:48,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I like watching real stuff.

953
01:04:09,252 --> 01:04:09,812
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

954
01:04:10,172 --> 01:04:12,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss all the stuff from when I was a kid.

955
01:04:13,114 --> 01:04:17,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they expected kids to have, you know, follow the story.

956
01:04:17,936 --> 01:04:18,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagination?

957
01:04:18,676 --> 01:04:19,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, imagination.

958
01:04:19,636 --> 01:04:21,417
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Muppet Babies was all about.

959
01:04:21,437 --> 01:04:22,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Muppet Babies is great.

960
01:04:22,657 --> 01:04:24,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me that cartoon wasn't the shit.

961
01:04:24,098 --> 01:04:24,958
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what that was all about.

962
01:04:24,998 --> 01:04:27,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you though, I've had a revival of lately.

963
01:04:27,619 --> 01:04:28,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki wants to make a joke.

964
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:30,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see Drawn Together Babies?

965
01:04:31,401 --> 01:04:31,821
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

966
01:04:31,941 --> 01:04:32,581
[SPEAKER_03]: God, no.

967
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:33,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't.

968
01:04:34,102 --> 01:04:36,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Drawn Together wasn't funny last season, so I haven't been watching it.

969
01:04:36,103 --> 01:04:36,423
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny.

970
01:04:37,103 --> 01:04:38,904
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been having a revival of Count Duckula.

971
01:04:40,103 --> 01:04:40,964
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty awesome.

972
01:04:41,604 --> 01:04:42,785
[SPEAKER_03]: And Danger Mouse.

973
01:04:43,506 --> 01:04:48,070
[SPEAKER_05]: But I tried going back watching Banana Man, and my God, that was horrible.

974
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,392
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe I liked Banana Man when I was 12.

975
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,035
[SPEAKER_03]: So you like Banana Man?

976
01:04:54,115 --> 01:04:55,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to like Banana Man.

977
01:04:56,337 --> 01:04:58,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very weird little British tune.

978
01:04:58,418 --> 01:04:59,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Next story, please.

979
01:04:59,499 --> 01:05:01,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Xbox 360 crap.

980
01:05:01,381 --> 01:05:01,921
[SPEAKER_05]: How about that?

981
01:05:02,342 --> 01:05:02,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

982
01:05:03,303 --> 01:05:08,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Toshiba is saying no comment, except they didn't actually say comment, they just said no.

983
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:13,013
[SPEAKER_05]: about the Xbox 360 HD DVD rumor.

984
01:05:13,893 --> 01:05:15,274
[SPEAKER_01]: So, wait a minute.

985
01:05:15,514 --> 01:05:23,416
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because... No, would you like to comment on the internal Xbox 360 HD DVD drive?

986
01:05:23,936 --> 01:05:24,096
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

987
01:05:24,576 --> 01:05:29,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Toshiba said no to the new Xbox 360 DVD HD DVD rumor.

988
01:05:30,338 --> 01:05:32,798
[SPEAKER_05]: But we pretty much all still think it's a rumor, so whatever.

989
01:05:33,098 --> 01:05:34,079
[SPEAKER_03]: You know why this is newsworthy?

990
01:05:34,099 --> 01:05:34,799
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't believe them!

991
01:05:35,079 --> 01:05:36,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know why this is newsworthy?

992
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know what they say about Microsoft rumors.

993
01:05:39,198 --> 01:05:40,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

994
01:06:04,456 --> 01:06:10,020
[SPEAKER_01]: One game I'm actually kind of excited to see coming to Xbox Live Arcade this week is going to be Mutant Storm Empire.

995
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:14,603
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love the Mutant Storm Reloaded game when it came out, still one of my favorite shooter games.

996
01:06:14,743 --> 01:06:19,486
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little bit overlooked because it was too similar to Geometry Wars, I think, and it's slower paced.

997
01:06:19,947 --> 01:06:21,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this one though looks really cool.

998
01:06:21,508 --> 01:06:23,189
[SPEAKER_01]: They have it set up a little bit different.

999
01:06:23,209 --> 01:06:29,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the changes you'll see from Reloaded is that the stages now, you actually kind of, it's one long stage.

1000
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:30,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Doors open up and

1001
01:06:31,158 --> 01:06:33,560
[SPEAKER_01]: DeLilla, DeLilla That would have been more entertaining

1002
01:06:58,694 --> 01:07:00,275
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be coming out for 800 points.

1003
01:07:00,455 --> 01:07:02,977
[SPEAKER_01]: It's due out this Wednesday, October 31st.

1004
01:07:04,438 --> 01:07:05,298
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be awesome.

1005
01:07:06,699 --> 01:07:10,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and online co-op it's going to have as well.

1006
01:07:10,241 --> 01:07:10,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.

1007
01:07:10,782 --> 01:07:11,342
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

1008
01:07:11,582 --> 01:07:12,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

1009
01:07:12,563 --> 01:07:16,505
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope since it's Halloween we're going to get some cheesy Halloween tie-in on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

1010
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:17,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Yaris 2!

1011
01:07:18,726 --> 01:07:19,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's scary.

1012
01:07:19,947 --> 01:07:20,948
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty scary.

1013
01:07:23,638 --> 01:07:30,181
[SPEAKER_02]: This time, not only does it have tentacles, but it has mech destroyer legs that the car runs on.

1014
01:07:32,842 --> 01:07:36,724
[SPEAKER_01]: The game will just evolve into something that's not even Yaris.

1015
01:07:36,784 --> 01:07:37,944
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, whatever.

1016
01:07:38,204 --> 01:07:42,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I think for the next year, we should make every effort to make a Yaris joke every week on the program.

1017
01:07:42,606 --> 01:07:49,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't that game remind you of the programmers of that After Dark screensaver decided to make a game and this is what it was?

1018
01:07:49,749 --> 01:07:50,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what Jamie never played?

1019
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:51,410
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

1020
01:07:51,823 --> 01:07:52,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Yaris.

1021
01:07:52,463 --> 01:07:53,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's probably a good thing.

1022
01:07:54,464 --> 01:07:56,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Consider yourself one of the lucky ones.

1023
01:07:56,886 --> 01:07:57,606
[SPEAKER_01]: It's free.

1024
01:07:57,806 --> 01:07:59,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Download me!

1025
01:07:59,707 --> 01:08:00,447
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm free!

1026
01:08:00,588 --> 01:08:01,108
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's tempting.

1027
01:08:01,148 --> 01:08:02,168
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a free game.

1028
01:08:02,388 --> 01:08:03,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, if it sucks, whatever.

1029
01:08:03,889 --> 01:08:04,289
[SPEAKER_01]: It's free.

1030
01:08:04,309 --> 01:08:04,910
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not worth it.

1031
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:07,551
[SPEAKER_05]: You pay in the time of your life that you spent.

1032
01:08:07,971 --> 01:08:09,412
[SPEAKER_05]: You will never get back.

1033
01:08:09,432 --> 01:08:11,833
[SPEAKER_01]: You lose part of your soul after playing that game.

1034
01:08:11,873 --> 01:08:12,193
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.

1035
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:13,074
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't got much left.

1036
01:08:13,434 --> 01:08:16,836
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I would like to actually open up our mailbag.

1037
01:08:16,896 --> 01:08:19,677
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to actually solicit... No, because I have to read that.

1038
01:08:20,037 --> 01:08:20,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, too bad.

1039
01:08:20,758 --> 01:08:21,058
Okay.

1040
01:08:21,958 --> 01:08:23,199
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to make you work a little harder.

1041
01:08:23,579 --> 01:08:26,641
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would like to solicit your best Yaris joke.

1042
01:08:27,261 --> 01:08:28,702
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to hear some Yaris.

1043
01:08:28,722 --> 01:08:29,622
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be about the game.

1044
01:08:29,662 --> 01:08:30,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell, it can be about the car.

1045
01:08:30,603 --> 01:08:30,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

1046
01:08:31,183 --> 01:08:31,963
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to get one.

1047
01:08:32,123 --> 01:08:33,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I want some Yaris jokes in the mailbag.

1048
01:08:33,924 --> 01:08:37,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Not tonight because we haven't gotten to the mailbag segment.

1049
01:08:37,146 --> 01:08:37,386
[SPEAKER_03]: We will.

1050
01:08:37,406 --> 01:08:41,708
[SPEAKER_03]: But for next week's show, as you guys are listening to the podcast later, I want some Yaris jokes.

1051
01:08:41,928 --> 01:08:45,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, though, how is this good advertising for the Yaris?

1052
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:48,591
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, now when you associate Yaris, you're going to think suck.

1053
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:49,712
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's not –

1054
01:08:50,525 --> 01:08:57,091
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't think that's a good thing that, you know, Yaris, oh yeah, that's right, that's that, you know, car that had a crappy game made for it.

1055
01:08:57,111 --> 01:09:06,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Or when I go shopping, and I like to see all the features of the Yaris, and I'm like, oh yes, well it has the built-in air conditioning and the GPS unit and the, you know, the leather interior.

1056
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:08,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be like, yes, but where is the tentacle gun?

1057
01:09:09,683 --> 01:09:11,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the giant death tentacle?

1058
01:09:11,905 --> 01:09:13,006
[SPEAKER_01]: That the commercials and...

1059
01:09:14,093 --> 01:09:15,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the fuck did that come out from?

1060
01:09:15,314 --> 01:09:16,694
[SPEAKER_01]: The stupid tentacle thing.

1061
01:09:16,714 --> 01:09:17,334
[SPEAKER_01]: This is weird.

1062
01:09:17,595 --> 01:09:18,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, sorry.

1063
01:09:18,215 --> 01:09:19,455
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to move on with the news.

1064
01:09:19,676 --> 01:09:19,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1065
01:09:19,936 --> 01:09:20,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we please?

1066
01:09:20,636 --> 01:09:21,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we may.

1067
01:09:21,096 --> 01:09:21,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, please, please, please.

1068
01:09:21,777 --> 01:09:22,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes, yes.

1069
01:09:23,437 --> 01:09:26,239
[SPEAKER_03]: News about Spore, which I'm very excited about Spore.

1070
01:09:26,439 --> 01:09:26,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

1071
01:09:27,299 --> 01:09:28,780
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've always heard these things.

1072
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:29,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Spore is...

1073
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,681
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1074
01:09:58,082 --> 01:10:00,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe late spring is when you're going to see this game.

1075
01:10:00,103 --> 01:10:01,944
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say it's probably going to be out somewhere next year.

1076
01:10:01,964 --> 01:10:03,365
[SPEAKER_01]: If it came out in April, that would be perfect.

1077
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:08,408
[SPEAKER_01]: April is the crappiest game for months, or game for the year.

1078
01:10:08,988 --> 01:10:10,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically the worst month for games.

1079
01:10:11,209 --> 01:10:11,890
[SPEAKER_03]: It's horrible.

1080
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:14,251
[SPEAKER_03]: It would definitely be a highlight in a low month.

1081
01:10:15,312 --> 01:10:20,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of highlights, we love to read the emails from our listeners every week, don't we, DarkSakura?

1082
01:10:20,535 --> 01:10:21,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we do.

1083
01:10:23,296 --> 01:10:24,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a gun to her head forcing her to say that.

1084
01:10:25,322 --> 01:10:25,843
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, um, six...

1085
01:10:42,918 --> 01:10:44,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, well let's get started.

1086
01:10:44,679 --> 01:10:45,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Long segment tonight.

1087
01:10:45,499 --> 01:10:49,261
[SPEAKER_05]: This one comes from AceSavior, I guess.

1088
01:10:50,062 --> 01:10:51,883
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an X instead of an S for Savior.

1089
01:10:52,503 --> 01:10:55,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, first I will admit that I am pretty new to the show.

1090
01:10:55,685 --> 01:11:00,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I just found the show when I was looking for RSS feeds and podcasts on my PSP a couple days ago.

1091
01:11:00,908 --> 01:11:03,489
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the fact that you guys have a website made just for the PSP.

1092
01:11:04,383 --> 01:11:06,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry that I haven't updated it in years.

1093
01:11:06,204 --> 01:11:07,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Too bad it never gets updated.

1094
01:11:07,605 --> 01:11:07,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey!

1095
01:11:07,925 --> 01:11:08,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki.

1096
01:11:08,965 --> 01:11:16,750
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to do OLRE and I kind of, I did not re-register the... Our main website's all kind of broken too, so anyway, whatever.

1097
01:11:16,990 --> 01:11:21,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I really appreciate it seeing as how my PSP is the closest thing I can get to a laptop at the moment.

1098
01:11:22,032 --> 01:11:30,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, even after only a few podcasts, I can honestly say this is the best video game internet radio show ever and I'm looking forward to more podcasts to come.

1099
01:11:30,457 --> 01:11:31,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep on gaming, guys.

1100
01:11:31,657 --> 01:11:32,758
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he said I was hot.

1101
01:11:33,376 --> 01:11:34,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not.

1102
01:11:35,537 --> 01:11:37,679
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just something that happens to women when they get married.

1103
01:11:37,739 --> 01:11:38,599
[SPEAKER_05]: They lose their heart.

1104
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:39,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, stop it.

1105
01:11:41,541 --> 01:11:41,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1106
01:11:41,962 --> 01:11:44,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I know DarkSakura's very shy, but you should see her outfit today.

1107
01:11:44,843 --> 01:11:45,404
[SPEAKER_03]: She's very nice.

1108
01:11:45,544 --> 01:11:47,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wearing my pirate shirt that I got at Walmart.

1109
01:11:47,865 --> 01:11:48,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's cute.

1110
01:11:48,646 --> 01:11:49,346
[SPEAKER_03]: With the skirt.

1111
01:11:49,386 --> 01:11:49,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the skirt.

1112
01:11:49,927 --> 01:11:52,829
[SPEAKER_05]: They sell the same shirt at Disneyland, and it's a bright red.

1113
01:11:53,249 --> 01:11:57,291
[SPEAKER_05]: And they charge $30 for it at Disneyland, and I paid $12 at Walmart.

1114
01:11:58,032 --> 01:11:59,293
[SPEAKER_03]: But what you're wearing today is dark.

1115
01:11:59,333 --> 01:12:01,374
[SPEAKER_03]: It's renaissance-y without being over the top.

1116
01:12:01,654 --> 01:12:02,735
[SPEAKER_03]: It's renaissance-y but modern.

1117
01:12:03,921 --> 01:12:05,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel kind of like a rockabilly.

1118
01:12:06,883 --> 01:12:07,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyhow.

1119
01:12:07,684 --> 01:12:09,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Which actually ties into future news.

1120
01:12:12,067 --> 01:12:12,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Arizona.

1121
01:12:13,809 --> 01:12:14,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, next email.

1122
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:19,994
[SPEAKER_05]: So, this one comes from Polinosis.

1123
01:12:20,214 --> 01:12:20,995
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of a cool name.

1124
01:12:21,695 --> 01:12:25,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I was reading this fascinating article the other day and I was wondering what you guys think of this man's opinion.

1125
01:12:25,378 --> 01:12:26,639
[SPEAKER_05]: And he also included a joke.

1126
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:29,462
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, why is the bicycle lying on its side?

1127
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:31,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

1128
01:12:31,203 --> 01:12:32,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it was too tired?

1129
01:12:32,124 --> 01:12:32,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

1130
01:12:36,496 --> 01:12:37,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Cricket, cricket, cricket, cricket.

1131
01:12:39,117 --> 01:12:42,498
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um... Did I accidentally invite jokes from the listeners last week?

1132
01:12:42,538 --> 01:12:43,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I must have.

1133
01:12:43,638 --> 01:12:44,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Good effort.

1134
01:12:47,179 --> 01:12:49,320
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um... You know what?

1135
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:53,421
[SPEAKER_05]: This article is kind of long, so instead what I'm going to do is I'm going to link it in the chat room.

1136
01:12:53,621 --> 01:12:54,241
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the topic?

1137
01:12:54,281 --> 01:12:55,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know if I read it.

1138
01:12:55,281 --> 01:12:58,262
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about how reviews are phrased, I do believe so.

1139
01:12:58,662 --> 01:12:58,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

1140
01:12:59,883 --> 01:13:00,283
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um...

1141
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,501
[SPEAKER_05]: saying, consider the following sentences.

1142
01:13:04,541 --> 01:13:06,462
[SPEAKER_05]: This book has good book read.

1143
01:13:07,002 --> 01:13:08,443
[SPEAKER_05]: This record has good record listen.

1144
01:13:08,603 --> 01:13:11,044
[SPEAKER_05]: This movie has good movie watch.

1145
01:13:11,324 --> 01:13:12,744
[SPEAKER_03]: This game has good gameplay, right?

1146
01:13:12,845 --> 01:13:13,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1147
01:13:15,586 --> 01:13:15,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny.

1148
01:13:16,706 --> 01:13:18,587
[SPEAKER_05]: I do sort of understand that.

1149
01:13:18,687 --> 01:13:20,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you could say, it plays well.

1150
01:13:21,568 --> 01:13:21,908
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.

1151
01:13:22,889 --> 01:13:26,750
[SPEAKER_05]: But... Yeah.

1152
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:28,931
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of, in my...

1153
01:13:32,105 --> 01:13:35,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Attention to semantics, I guess that I do sort of agree with that.

1154
01:13:37,729 --> 01:13:39,970
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll read it more and maybe respond to it next week.

1155
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:41,971
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take that as a homework assignment.

1156
01:13:42,011 --> 01:13:42,972
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm posting it in the chat room.

1157
01:13:43,232 --> 01:13:43,492
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1158
01:13:44,693 --> 01:13:45,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take a look at it real quick.

1159
01:13:46,174 --> 01:13:46,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1160
01:13:47,474 --> 01:13:48,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, Pirate Bay.

1161
01:13:48,395 --> 01:13:50,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, moving forward.

1162
01:13:53,658 --> 01:13:58,882
[SPEAKER_05]: We have one from Mark F. Says, Hi, Jamie.

1163
01:13:59,242 --> 01:14:01,263
[SPEAKER_05]: And my name is spelled the other way, by the way, but that's okay.

1164
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:03,838
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been playing a lot of Ragnarok Online.

1165
01:14:03,858 --> 01:14:06,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't confirmed, but I think RO2 Beta is out.

1166
01:14:06,961 --> 01:14:08,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you been playing that or the original RO?

1167
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:13,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, since you're an MMO girl, have you played World of Warcraft or Guild Wars?

1168
01:14:14,065 --> 01:14:14,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep up the great work.

1169
01:14:14,806 --> 01:14:16,047
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are very entertaining.

1170
01:14:16,427 --> 01:14:18,829
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you bring back your extra guests from time to time.

1171
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:27,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I know that the RO2 Beta was out in Korea, and I tried to sign up for it, but they needed me to sign up for a social security number or some shit, so I didn't do it.

1172
01:14:28,527 --> 01:14:42,191
[SPEAKER_05]: However, it has been brought to my attention that VR2 Beta is now out in the United States and if my laptop is up to the task, I will be downloading that like a mofo and playing it like crazy because I love Ragnarok.

1173
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:44,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially since it's a beta, it'd have to be free.

1174
01:14:45,872 --> 01:14:46,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

1175
01:14:46,673 --> 01:14:47,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep going.

1176
01:14:48,053 --> 01:14:57,616
[SPEAKER_05]: So, to answer your question, yes, I played World of Warcraft and I have stopped playing for World of Warcraft because number one, it's on my other computer and number two, honestly, I didn't think it was that fun.

1177
01:14:58,863 --> 01:14:59,223
[SPEAKER_05]: AllTrackValley

1178
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:25,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Going through this whole thing with NC... The people at NCSoft are great.

1179
01:15:25,844 --> 01:15:27,125
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just really on the ball.

1180
01:15:27,746 --> 01:15:36,493
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've been able to replace my confirmation code, so I will be hopefully sometime in the next week getting back on Guild Wars.

1181
01:15:37,314 --> 01:15:39,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a character that looks like the Doctor.

1182
01:15:39,115 --> 01:15:40,036
[SPEAKER_05]: His name is John Smith.

1183
01:15:41,497 --> 01:15:48,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I also have another character that was supposed to be in my friend's guild, and she left the guild, so...

1184
01:15:48,703 --> 01:15:50,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea what the hell is happening, so.

1185
01:15:51,807 --> 01:15:52,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be on.

1186
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:53,289
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see me.

1187
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:54,351
[SPEAKER_05]: I think.

1188
01:15:55,512 --> 01:15:59,537
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also was thinking about getting into City of Heroes, but honestly, when do I have the time?

1189
01:16:01,901 --> 01:16:02,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeehaw.

1190
01:16:03,271 --> 01:16:05,432
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Rose online too.

1191
01:16:05,912 --> 01:16:10,654
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my new friends who I met through William, I believe is going to come on our show next week.

1192
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:12,215
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's really into City of Heroes.

1193
01:16:12,455 --> 01:16:17,497
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why I'm having him on next week is he was in the Tabula Rasa beta, which is a game I'm pretty excited about.

1194
01:16:17,517 --> 01:16:18,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know more about it.

1195
01:16:18,938 --> 01:16:19,638
[SPEAKER_03]: He was telling me about it.

1196
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:20,478
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds really awesome.

1197
01:16:20,498 --> 01:16:23,620
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to show me the game this week to see if it's something I want to get into.

1198
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:28,502
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll have him on next week probably and talking about some of the PC games we sometimes overlook.

1199
01:16:29,122 --> 01:16:30,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have another email from the same person.

1200
01:16:30,823 --> 01:16:31,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, okay.

1201
01:16:31,583 --> 01:16:31,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1202
01:16:32,698 --> 01:16:35,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Here are some of my comments for episode 252.

1203
01:16:36,183 --> 01:16:37,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the 3D Street Fighter games.

1204
01:16:38,546 --> 01:16:42,652
[SPEAKER_05]: It was different playing style that made the Street Fighter characters almost real because of the limitations.

1205
01:16:43,032 --> 01:16:45,856
[SPEAKER_05]: I got tired of them jumping 9 feet in the air and spinning around like tornadoes.

1206
01:16:46,497 --> 01:16:47,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, you're alone in that one, buddy.

1207
01:16:48,319 --> 01:16:49,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at least he's not bringing up the...

1208
01:16:51,431 --> 01:17:01,954
[SPEAKER_05]: PC games are probably getting more love because of better laptop sales and external USB D-pads controllers.

1209
01:17:02,414 --> 01:17:03,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep up the great work.

1210
01:17:04,515 --> 01:17:04,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

1211
01:17:05,875 --> 01:17:08,496
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked the later EX games, honestly.

1212
01:17:09,276 --> 01:17:12,197
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the first one that was kind of, well, bad.

1213
01:17:13,098 --> 01:17:13,518
[SPEAKER_05]: But, hey.

1214
01:17:14,298 --> 01:17:17,459
[SPEAKER_05]: This one is from Spamouflage.

1215
01:17:18,707 --> 01:17:19,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think that's a cool name.

1216
01:17:20,028 --> 01:17:21,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Bonsoir, DarkSakura.

1217
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:23,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's French.

1218
01:17:24,631 --> 01:17:29,414
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's my statement of the week, and I'd love to get your opinion since I consider you as experts.

1219
01:17:30,015 --> 01:17:33,137
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard that Nintendo is selling lots of Wii systems but no games.

1220
01:17:33,277 --> 01:17:33,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1221
01:17:34,178 --> 01:17:38,721
[SPEAKER_05]: What if occasional gamers turn out to be cheap bastards who don't buy games?

1222
01:17:39,457 --> 01:17:40,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Three questions.

1223
01:17:40,318 --> 01:17:41,319
[SPEAKER_05]: One, is my statement true?

1224
01:17:41,439 --> 01:17:42,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Two, are Wii games not selling?

1225
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Three, where do you go to get the latest game sale figures?

1226
01:17:45,842 --> 01:17:49,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I could just Google it, but I like hearing DarkSakura read my emails.

1227
01:17:50,306 --> 01:17:51,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Merci, spam a flash.

1228
01:17:52,488 --> 01:17:58,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Um... I... You know that you can find a lot of the sales types through Consumer Reports, too.

1229
01:17:58,813 --> 01:17:58,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1230
01:17:59,716 --> 01:18:05,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the, a lot of the just new sites like Kotaku, what are the other ones?

1231
01:18:05,701 --> 01:18:07,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, like Joystick and Destructoid are the big three probably.

1232
01:18:07,763 --> 01:18:11,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they'll list game sales figures quarterly when they do the quarterly reports.

1233
01:18:12,747 --> 01:18:15,890
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I also, for a lot of my UK news, I get from Eurogamer.

1234
01:18:16,210 --> 01:18:17,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, where do you get your sales figures?

1235
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:21,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that coming from a way of your internal sources at your day job or?

1236
01:18:21,995 --> 01:18:22,495
[SPEAKER_03]: MPD.

1237
01:18:22,976 --> 01:18:23,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

1238
01:18:24,448 --> 01:18:28,270
[SPEAKER_03]: When you talk about sales numbers on the show, is that numbers you're getting from your work?

1239
01:18:28,290 --> 01:18:29,571
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's from MPD Group.

1240
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:32,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

1241
01:18:32,292 --> 01:18:33,973
[SPEAKER_01]: Plenty of Wii games are selling, trust me.

1242
01:18:34,433 --> 01:18:36,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not all of the Wii games that they want.

1243
01:18:36,434 --> 01:18:43,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I know Donkey Kong Barrel Blast didn't sell hotcakes, or maybe... I don't know.

1244
01:18:45,739 --> 01:18:50,021
[SPEAKER_03]: But I imagine a lot of those Wii games, just based on what's out there, they're selling to kids and families.

1245
01:18:50,061 --> 01:18:52,903
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not necessarily selling to hardcore gaming audience, which is probably why...

1246
01:18:53,413 --> 01:18:54,694
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1247
01:19:15,047 --> 01:19:21,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there's a lot of games that are crappy ports and stuff, or just crappy control and whatever, and a lot of people get jaded by that.

1248
01:19:21,491 --> 01:19:28,916
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, shit, I don't know if I want to go spend $50 just to get a game that's going to suck, so maybe Wii buyers are a little more cautious.

1249
01:19:29,216 --> 01:19:32,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, all the A-list titles on the Wii right now, too, are coming from Nintendo.

1250
01:19:32,858 --> 01:19:37,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't think of a third-party A or AAA title on its way soon.

1251
01:19:38,496 --> 01:19:40,998
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure Chad will think of something, but I can't even think of anything.

1252
01:19:41,018 --> 01:19:45,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Manhunt 2, there's stuff from Capcom, Resident Evil, Umbrella Chronicles, Brothers in Arms.

1253
01:19:45,341 --> 01:19:46,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'll give you Umbrella Chronicles.

1254
01:19:46,962 --> 01:19:49,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Medal of Honor Heroes 2, it's going to be big.

1255
01:19:49,984 --> 01:19:53,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tenkaichi 3 from Atari.

1256
01:19:53,827 --> 01:19:55,068
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally am not really interested.

1257
01:19:55,088 --> 01:19:55,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Madden 08.

1258
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:56,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there you go.

1259
01:19:57,169 --> 01:19:57,470
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

1260
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:02,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Nights, says Gerardimo.

1261
01:20:02,063 --> 01:20:02,504
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

1262
01:20:02,604 --> 01:20:03,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1263
01:20:03,185 --> 01:20:03,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Nights.

1264
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:04,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, there you go.

1265
01:20:04,347 --> 01:20:08,394
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, though, you may like Nights, but Nights I don't think is going to be that big of a game.

1266
01:20:09,296 --> 01:20:10,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1267
01:20:10,878 --> 01:20:12,161
[SPEAKER_05]: I am excited about Nights.

1268
01:20:13,499 --> 01:20:15,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's going to be fantastically huge.

1269
01:20:16,241 --> 01:20:20,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I would totally believe though there's a lot of people just buying the Wii for Wii Sports and that's it.

1270
01:20:20,184 --> 01:20:23,646
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of families I bet are doing it and totally fine with Wii Sports.

1271
01:20:23,947 --> 01:20:24,387
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what?

1272
01:20:24,407 --> 01:20:33,974
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some companies that are getting smart about the games that are released and a lot of them are pretty budget games like this AMF Bowling Pinbusters from Bethesda I think.

1273
01:20:33,994 --> 01:20:35,195
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's Bethesda.

1274
01:20:35,215 --> 01:20:35,655
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.

1275
01:20:37,056 --> 01:20:37,596
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming out for $19.

1276
01:20:37,657 --> 01:20:39,618
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know it's a

1277
01:20:39,997 --> 01:20:41,398
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1278
01:21:06,744 --> 01:21:08,165
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1279
01:21:36,178 --> 01:21:37,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Christmas nights.

1280
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:40,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway... I love Christmas because I get presents.

1281
01:21:41,542 --> 01:21:44,104
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorite holiday, though, is coming up in three days.

1282
01:21:44,524 --> 01:21:45,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Halloween.

1283
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:46,126
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Halloween.

1284
01:21:46,786 --> 01:21:48,027
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a religious holiday for me.

1285
01:21:49,668 --> 01:21:50,269
[SPEAKER_05]: It's true.

1286
01:21:50,329 --> 01:21:51,150
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a religious holiday.

1287
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:54,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, it's the end of the year.

1288
01:21:56,013 --> 01:21:57,054
[SPEAKER_05]: So, moving forward.

1289
01:21:57,595 --> 01:22:02,258
[SPEAKER_05]: This one comes from Robert M. Two stupid things here.

1290
01:22:03,119 --> 01:22:04,440
[SPEAKER_05]: This email... No, I'm kidding.

1291
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:05,781
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just teasing.

1292
01:22:06,653 --> 01:22:18,398
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, I'd like to, although I have participated in the fun myself, suggest that we, after the whole Eye of Judgment bet is finished, drop the whole Loki is Tingle thing and try something fresh, such as Loki as Maria the Hippo from Sly Cooper.

1293
01:22:18,978 --> 01:22:20,419
[SPEAKER_05]: No idea why, just random.

1294
01:22:20,439 --> 01:22:21,859
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know who the hell that is.

1295
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:24,620
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know of the game, I just don't know who that character is.

1296
01:22:24,941 --> 01:22:35,725
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I want to agree with this statement that maybe after the bet is lost, because we all know it will be, that thing ain't selling a million units, that maybe we ought to drop the whole Loki is Tingle thing, but I don't know, there's a part of me that says,

1297
01:22:36,257 --> 01:22:37,237
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just never going to go away.

1298
01:22:37,457 --> 01:22:38,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the whole Death Cake.

1299
01:22:38,978 --> 01:22:43,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because I did the voice one time, and I don't even remember how the voice was.

1300
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:49,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, how many years ago did Loki play Karaoke Revolution live on air?

1301
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:53,200
[SPEAKER_03]: It has scared him from doing karaoke permanently for the rest of his life.

1302
01:22:53,481 --> 01:22:54,781
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's the effect this show has.

1303
01:22:54,981 --> 01:22:59,142
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's just that we tried to duplicate the funny of it, and it's just you can't.

1304
01:22:59,262 --> 01:23:00,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, second time's never as good as the first.

1305
01:23:01,442 --> 01:23:06,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like if Loki does actually have to dress up as Tingle for whatever reason, it will only happen once.

1306
01:23:06,363 --> 01:23:07,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Only then will we drop it.

1307
01:23:07,784 --> 01:23:11,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we know now that if he does it again, it's just going to be some weirdo in a suit.

1308
01:23:11,985 --> 01:23:14,465
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that it's more fun to speculate.

1309
01:23:15,825 --> 01:23:22,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what was that story written by... Oh God, now I can't think of the guy who wrote The Great Gatsby.

1310
01:23:23,667 --> 01:23:24,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you.

1311
01:23:24,467 --> 01:23:25,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Fitzgerald, was that his name?

1312
01:23:26,288 --> 01:23:26,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1313
01:23:26,748 --> 01:23:26,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1314
01:23:28,019 --> 01:23:30,159
[SPEAKER_05]: about the girl who said she was going to cut her hair.

1315
01:23:30,179 --> 01:23:30,900
[SPEAKER_05]: She's going to cut her hair.

1316
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,880
[SPEAKER_05]: She's suddenly this popular and everyone loves her.

1317
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,960
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when she does cut her hair, everyone's like, oh.

1318
01:23:37,421 --> 01:23:38,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And then she leaves.

1319
01:23:39,981 --> 01:23:42,962
[SPEAKER_03]: But seriously, he's going to set Eye of Judgment on fire.

1320
01:23:43,222 --> 01:23:44,202
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be awesome.

1321
01:23:44,242 --> 01:23:45,242
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be fantastic.

1322
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:48,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I just made a classic literature reference.

1323
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:50,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I will fucking dance around and set an Eye of Judgment on fire.

1324
01:23:50,603 --> 01:23:51,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't wear a suit.

1325
01:23:52,843 --> 01:23:53,363
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.

1326
01:23:54,364 --> 01:23:56,044
[SPEAKER_05]: So to continue with this email.

1327
01:23:56,284 --> 01:23:56,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1328
01:23:57,023 --> 01:23:58,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Night of Tangents

1329
01:24:19,178 --> 01:24:19,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1330
01:24:33,247 --> 01:24:39,793
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care whether you don't like music games or whether you simply think a portable guitar game simply wouldn't work compared to having the actual instrument hardware.

1331
01:24:40,393 --> 01:24:49,801
[SPEAKER_05]: I can only think of two games right now that he could be talking about, and to suggest that Nintendo flat-out abandoned over 20 years of first-party development, that's arguably the only reason the company still has support.

1332
01:24:50,281 --> 01:24:58,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Because a different game developer on a completely different continent is publishing a game that he doesn't care for on their system seems dangerously ignorant and selfish to me.

1333
01:24:59,448 --> 01:25:00,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Just venting, I guess.

1334
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:01,570
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1335
01:25:01,991 --> 01:25:03,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you need to fire your friend.

1336
01:25:05,232 --> 01:25:09,073
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that you should point this out to your friend and go, now how do you feel?

1337
01:25:10,014 --> 01:25:10,614
[SPEAKER_03]: No, here it is.

1338
01:25:10,794 --> 01:25:12,315
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think you should fire your friend.

1339
01:25:12,415 --> 01:25:14,595
[SPEAKER_03]: But your friend is misinformed on one huge thing.

1340
01:25:14,896 --> 01:25:17,356
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like your friend is assuming Nintendo makes all these decisions.

1341
01:25:17,677 --> 01:25:18,177
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't.

1342
01:25:18,457 --> 01:25:19,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo makes the system.

1343
01:25:19,897 --> 01:25:22,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Developers buy the kits to make games.

1344
01:25:22,598 --> 01:25:24,139
[SPEAKER_03]: It's up to them what games they want to make.

1345
01:25:24,579 --> 01:25:30,161
[SPEAKER_03]: So when they make all these Imagine Babies and whatever games they're making, that's not Nintendo going...

1346
01:25:30,541 --> 01:25:34,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Gosh, we really need someone to develop a baby sim for our system.

1347
01:25:34,123 --> 01:25:40,085
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they just kind of turn it loose out there, which in my mind is a good thing because a lot of great ideas come from these third-party developers.

1348
01:25:40,165 --> 01:25:44,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, a lot of shitty ideas and cheap knockoffs come from them as well.

1349
01:25:44,787 --> 01:25:50,790
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other problem is I would not call – I'm assuming the games he's referring to there are like Jam Sessions and the Hannah Montana game.

1350
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:52,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not call those knockoffs.

1351
01:25:54,171 --> 01:25:54,691
[SPEAKER_03]: They're different.

1352
01:25:55,672 --> 01:25:55,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1353
01:25:56,294 --> 01:25:58,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because they all have music in common does not mean they're in common.

1354
01:25:58,476 --> 01:26:00,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Different is not necessarily bad.

1355
01:26:01,279 --> 01:26:01,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1356
01:26:02,981 --> 01:26:05,663
[SPEAKER_03]: So, your friend, unfortunately, is a little bit misinformed.

1357
01:26:06,504 --> 01:26:07,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Your friend's a hater.

1358
01:26:08,046 --> 01:26:08,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm done.

1359
01:26:09,407 --> 01:26:10,308
[SPEAKER_03]: All done with emails?

1360
01:26:10,488 --> 01:26:10,808
[SPEAKER_03]: No more.

1361
01:26:10,848 --> 01:26:11,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I said there were six.

1362
01:26:12,190 --> 01:26:13,451
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't count tonight.

1363
01:26:13,551 --> 01:26:14,152
[SPEAKER_03]: How many have we done?

1364
01:26:14,772 --> 01:26:15,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Five?

1365
01:26:15,413 --> 01:26:15,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Six.

1366
01:26:16,134 --> 01:26:16,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we've done six?

1367
01:26:16,994 --> 01:26:17,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1368
01:26:17,315 --> 01:26:17,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we're done.

1369
01:26:19,117 --> 01:26:20,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com

1370
01:26:21,448 --> 01:26:26,590
[SPEAKER_03]: The segment's pushing an hour 30, so let's wrap it up really quickly with a couple more stories.

1371
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:26,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1372
01:26:27,430 --> 01:26:27,790
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1373
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:30,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, as most people in the U.S.

1374
01:26:30,851 --> 01:26:34,653
[SPEAKER_01]: know, there's a lot of fire going on in the L.A.

1375
01:26:34,833 --> 01:26:35,373
[SPEAKER_01]: area there.

1376
01:26:35,773 --> 01:26:43,376
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, of course, wildfires in the San Diego area have forced Midway to evacuate their San Diego office.

1377
01:26:43,436 --> 01:26:46,777
[SPEAKER_01]: But fear not, that will not delay Stranglehold any longer.

1378
01:26:48,057 --> 01:26:49,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, most of the development...

1379
01:26:51,752 --> 01:26:52,892
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens in other places.

1380
01:26:53,153 --> 01:26:55,494
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just their corporate office.

1381
01:26:58,155 --> 01:26:58,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.

1382
01:26:58,895 --> 01:27:03,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Your strangleholds in Unreal Tournament won't be delayed any further.

1383
01:27:04,057 --> 01:27:07,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Unreal Tournament might, but strangleholds at least won't be.

1384
01:27:08,319 --> 01:27:11,480
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a real shame what happened there with those fires.

1385
01:27:12,201 --> 01:27:16,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Gosh, I hope none of our listeners... I imagine some of our listeners had to have been affected by it.

1386
01:27:16,963 --> 01:27:18,383
[SPEAKER_03]: They evacuated, what, like a million people?

1387
01:27:19,084 --> 01:27:19,204
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

1388
01:27:20,236 --> 01:27:20,836
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1389
01:27:47,742 --> 01:27:51,324
[SPEAKER_03]: and Netflix is kind of trying to set their eyes on the future.

1390
01:27:51,344 --> 01:27:55,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, Netflix has really kind of turned themselves into the current right now.

1391
01:27:55,066 --> 01:28:02,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, hell, Ma and Pa Video Stores and even now Hollywood Video is really being impacted by, some would say, Netflix has been a huge part of this.

1392
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:03,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Netflix...

1393
01:28:05,549 --> 01:28:06,710
[SPEAKER_03]: has made an interesting comment.

1394
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:08,710
[SPEAKER_03]: It came from the CEO, Reed Hastings.

1395
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:15,892
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said he's interested in enabling Netflix through, quote, internet-connected game consoles.

1396
01:28:16,532 --> 01:28:21,354
[SPEAKER_03]: So very interesting that Netflix kind of wants to put their feelers out there on what they can do.

1397
01:28:22,374 --> 01:28:30,156
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing that should be noted about this is that back in March, Hastings actually is now on the board of Microsoft, right?

1398
01:28:30,655 --> 01:28:36,163
[SPEAKER_03]: So you kind of go, hmm, could this mean that a Microsoft Netflix deal is in the cards?

1399
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:44,852
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so because I think the way the Xbox Live marketplace is set up now is not very friendly to movies and finding movies.

1400
01:28:45,172 --> 01:28:49,633
[SPEAKER_03]: However, Netflix on the other hand has an awesome system to find movies and has the whole friends thing and everything.

1401
01:28:49,913 --> 01:28:52,394
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Xbox Live is kind of clunky when it comes to their movie downloads.

1402
01:28:52,954 --> 01:28:55,515
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think a partnership could be a step up for them.

1403
01:28:55,855 --> 01:29:00,156
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a little bit of fanboyism and dreaming there I think in a sense.

1404
01:29:00,576 --> 01:29:05,057
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a really big step because Microsoft kind of – they may think they don't need Netflix.

1405
01:29:05,117 --> 01:29:16,906
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I talk about this every week, and I probably sound like a broken record, but Sony's gonna have to step up really quick, or, you know, a few major announcements, and they're gonna be screwed.

1406
01:29:17,707 --> 01:29:20,889
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's gonna, a lot of stuff is gonna happen too quick.

1407
01:29:21,089 --> 01:29:33,279
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Microsoft already has a pretty strong download service for movies and stuff, and if you add Netflix to that as well, where you can be able to pay a subscription per month and download as much shit as you want, um,

1408
01:29:34,349 --> 01:29:35,710
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of scary.

1409
01:29:36,831 --> 01:29:42,615
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Sony's talking about doing something as far as a download service, but they're kind of behind.

1410
01:29:42,835 --> 01:29:43,896
[SPEAKER_03]: But we don't know.

1411
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:47,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because it's on the board of Microsoft doesn't mean that maybe Netflix teams up with Sony.

1412
01:29:47,759 --> 01:29:53,463
[SPEAKER_03]: And that could be a huge boost for Sony, who seems to be finding the majority of their success right now as being a Blu-ray player.

1413
01:29:54,063 --> 01:29:55,584
[SPEAKER_03]: It would actually be really good for them.

1414
01:29:56,245 --> 01:29:57,826
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see if it happens.

1415
01:29:58,166 --> 01:29:58,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

1416
01:30:00,408 --> 01:30:00,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

1417
01:30:01,254 --> 01:30:05,015
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about time we bring this segment to a close because we've been here for a while now.

1418
01:30:05,395 --> 01:30:11,236
[SPEAKER_03]: But before we bring this segment to a close, we have to wrap up by paying a little respect to our elders.

1419
01:30:11,276 --> 01:30:15,216
[SPEAKER_03]: And we like to do that through DarkSakura's classic game of the week.

1420
01:30:15,656 --> 01:30:20,917
[SPEAKER_03]: So, DarkSakura, why don't you tell us what game you've picked for this week?

1421
01:30:20,937 --> 01:30:22,758
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm actually curious because it's Halloween week.

1422
01:30:22,778 --> 01:30:25,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you pick something a little Halloween themed for us?

1423
01:30:25,418 --> 01:30:29,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Sort of, but actually I was more paying tribute to the release of Dracula X Chronicles.

1424
01:30:30,559 --> 01:30:30,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah.

1425
01:30:31,067 --> 01:30:35,910
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was picking one of my favorite games in the Castlevania series, which would be Kid Dracula.

1426
01:30:36,930 --> 01:30:38,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, okay, Kid Dracula.

1427
01:30:38,771 --> 01:30:46,375
[SPEAKER_05]: It was released in Japan as Akumajo Special Boku Dracula-kun, which translates to Demon Castle Special.

1428
01:30:46,735 --> 01:30:48,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Demon Castle Special, I'm Dracula-kun.

1429
01:30:50,097 --> 01:30:54,419
[SPEAKER_05]: He's playing as Alucard, pretty much, only he's Kid Dracula in the game.

1430
01:30:55,119 --> 01:30:59,942
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all super cute, and he has some of the powers that he had in...

1431
01:31:01,104 --> 01:31:01,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Symphony of the Night.

1432
01:31:02,305 --> 01:31:07,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, the major bad guy in this game ended up being an enemy in Symphony of the Night.

1433
01:31:08,228 --> 01:31:11,009
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I love how they just tie in everything.

1434
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:11,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was really great.

1435
01:31:12,350 --> 01:31:15,631
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a fun little, you know, little kid-type platformer.

1436
01:31:15,651 --> 01:31:17,352
[SPEAKER_05]: It came out on the Famicom in Japan.

1437
01:31:18,573 --> 01:31:23,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Also on the Game Boy.

1438
01:31:23,696 --> 01:31:25,336
[SPEAKER_05]: And over here we got it on the Game Boy.

1439
01:31:25,356 --> 01:31:26,437
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually own this game.

1440
01:31:26,497 --> 01:31:27,137
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very happy.

1441
01:31:28,258 --> 01:31:28,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1442
01:31:29,873 --> 01:31:31,214
[SPEAKER_05]: It has the first level music.

1443
01:31:31,234 --> 01:31:33,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you can hear it very well.

1444
01:31:38,078 --> 01:31:39,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me wait for it to get to the part.

1445
01:31:46,843 --> 01:31:48,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed this game when I was growing up.

1446
01:31:48,304 --> 01:31:48,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I never played this.

1447
01:31:50,150 --> 01:31:52,111
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't get it in America.

1448
01:31:52,472 --> 01:31:53,312
[SPEAKER_05]: We got it on Game Boy.

1449
01:31:53,552 --> 01:31:55,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I was going to say, I remember it on Game Boy.

1450
01:31:55,134 --> 01:31:56,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember seeing it somewhere.

1451
01:31:56,235 --> 01:32:06,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but this is a remix of Beginning from Castlevania III, if anyone recognizes it.

1452
01:32:07,163 --> 01:32:09,445
[SPEAKER_05]: The other cool thing about this game is that

1453
01:32:09,901 --> 01:32:19,952
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love how Konami does this, is that, um, Kid Dracula was also, um, a playable character, um, in, uh, Gokujo Parodius, which I thought was pretty cool.

1454
01:32:20,333 --> 01:32:26,300
[SPEAKER_05]: He was also a hidden selectable character in Jikyo Shiberi Parodius, which is actually my favorite of the Parodius series.

1455
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:28,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I also love chatting Parodius, too, but, um,

1456
01:32:29,528 --> 01:32:33,211
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, you know, I'll be covering the Proteus series somewhat later.

1457
01:32:33,231 --> 01:32:35,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, look, it has, like, the clocks, like, just like Castlevania does.

1458
01:32:35,332 --> 01:32:36,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you go in the clock tower and everything.

1459
01:32:36,313 --> 01:32:44,018
[SPEAKER_05]: It has all of the, a lot of the classic levels that you expect in the old, um, uh, Castlevania games.

1460
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:45,179
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was so cute.

1461
01:32:45,599 --> 01:32:46,840
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually was kind of hard.

1462
01:32:47,281 --> 01:32:48,722
[SPEAKER_05]: It got really difficult at times.

1463
01:32:48,862 --> 01:32:52,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like, uh, you know, you have the swinging pendulum and everything, too.

1464
01:32:52,765 --> 01:32:53,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

1465
01:32:53,065 --> 01:32:54,246
[SPEAKER_03]: A chatroom's joining in on this.

1466
01:32:54,306 --> 01:32:59,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Escapist says, Kid Dracula made using an umbrella as a weapon badass long before Kirby gave it a shot.

1467
01:32:59,930 --> 01:33:00,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1468
01:33:00,470 --> 01:33:03,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Son of Dad says, the music sounds very upbeat for a Castlevania game.

1469
01:33:03,472 --> 01:33:10,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was more of a parody-style game, but it was actually pretty good for how it played.

1470
01:33:10,897 --> 01:33:11,397
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved it.

1471
01:33:11,977 --> 01:33:17,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we're talking about one of my top 20 games, I have to say.

1472
01:33:17,701 --> 01:33:17,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1473
01:33:18,302 --> 01:33:18,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Easy.

1474
01:33:19,417 --> 01:33:20,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1475
01:33:40,242 --> 01:33:43,384
[SPEAKER_05]: He has this toothy grin the entire time.

1476
01:33:44,385 --> 01:33:52,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to paste a copy of the logo in the chatroom, just because it was adorable.

1477
01:33:53,030 --> 01:33:55,692
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to post the one off of Wikipedia.

1478
01:33:56,432 --> 01:33:58,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Gerardimo says, Polka makes umbrella weapons best.

1479
01:33:59,974 --> 01:34:01,735
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a Turtle Sonata reference right there.

1480
01:34:03,276 --> 01:34:04,937
[SPEAKER_03]: What is he fighting here, a Klansman?

1481
01:34:05,398 --> 01:34:06,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, it is!

1482
01:34:06,418 --> 01:34:07,519
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a swastika on his head!

1483
01:34:08,194 --> 01:34:10,615
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God, look at this boss he's fighting here at the end of stage one.

1484
01:34:11,255 --> 01:34:11,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this.

1485
01:34:12,656 --> 01:34:13,636
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a little swastika on his head.

1486
01:34:13,676 --> 01:34:17,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's supposed to be like... I don't think this is supposed to be Shaft, wasn't it?

1487
01:34:17,618 --> 01:34:18,658
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a Klansman.

1488
01:34:20,459 --> 01:34:21,099
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.

1489
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:26,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this is a... Doing his part for racial equality.

1490
01:34:26,342 --> 01:34:27,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess so.

1491
01:34:27,082 --> 01:34:28,523
[SPEAKER_03]: He made the Klansman cry and run away.

1492
01:34:28,943 --> 01:34:29,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hitting him too much.

1493
01:34:29,823 --> 01:34:30,223
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1494
01:34:31,944 --> 01:34:32,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

1495
01:34:32,304 --> 01:34:33,345
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so there you have it.

1496
01:34:34,125 --> 01:34:36,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Kid Dracula, your game of the week.

1497
01:34:36,686 --> 01:34:36,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

1498
01:34:37,373 --> 01:34:39,814
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm probably one of these days going to cover Proteus.

1499
01:34:40,434 --> 01:34:41,555
[SPEAKER_05]: And I always say I'm going to.

1500
01:34:41,595 --> 01:34:42,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't give it away.

1501
01:34:42,935 --> 01:34:43,796
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't say when.

1502
01:34:43,976 --> 01:34:44,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I said eventually.

1503
01:34:45,236 --> 01:34:46,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're here next week, right?

1504
01:34:46,477 --> 01:34:47,417
[SPEAKER_03]: You're still here next week?

1505
01:34:47,677 --> 01:34:50,338
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's two weeks that you leave for Alabama?

1506
01:34:50,398 --> 01:34:54,240
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I leave actually taking a red eye on Thanksgiving.

1507
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:54,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

1508
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:55,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay.

1509
01:34:55,801 --> 01:34:57,161
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to be a little later in the month.

1510
01:34:57,401 --> 01:35:04,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to warn the listeners, be careful because when DarkSakura is out of town... I'm going to record my Game of the Week.

1511
01:35:04,548 --> 01:35:05,568
[SPEAKER_03]: All you're going to record it?

1512
01:35:05,588 --> 01:35:07,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought we got to pick in your absence.

1513
01:35:08,830 --> 01:35:09,550
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sneaky.

1514
01:35:10,770 --> 01:35:11,531
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you pick?

1515
01:35:11,751 --> 01:35:15,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I would definitely go back to the Commodore 64 and dust something off from those archives.

1516
01:35:15,432 --> 01:35:15,992
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know yet.

1517
01:35:16,232 --> 01:35:16,992
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to spoil it.

1518
01:35:17,373 --> 01:35:18,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a game in mind right here.

1519
01:35:18,773 --> 01:35:22,134
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're going to go in that direction, then how could I deny anybody that?

1520
01:35:22,514 --> 01:35:22,815
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1521
01:35:23,815 --> 01:35:24,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Heart.

1522
01:35:24,953 --> 01:35:25,314
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1523
01:35:25,815 --> 01:35:27,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki on the other hand, I have no idea what he'd pick.

1524
01:35:27,918 --> 01:35:29,841
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll pick Gals Panic or something.

1525
01:35:30,261 --> 01:35:31,643
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not pick Gals Panic.

1526
01:35:31,663 --> 01:35:32,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Or Miss World nude.

1527
01:35:34,307 --> 01:35:35,349
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not pick that.

1528
01:35:35,710 --> 01:35:38,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody didn't move your body.

1529
01:35:38,754 --> 01:35:40,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob made the heart and I threw up the horns.

1530
01:35:41,826 --> 01:35:42,046
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1531
01:35:42,086 --> 01:35:45,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, we really need to take a break here because we are pushing almost an hour 40 now.

1532
01:35:46,009 --> 01:35:47,650
[SPEAKER_03]: And we still have half the show to go.

1533
01:35:47,670 --> 01:35:48,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

1534
01:35:48,650 --> 01:35:51,972
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTesia points out Chill Einigi.

1535
01:35:52,212 --> 01:35:52,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.

1536
01:35:53,073 --> 01:35:53,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1537
01:35:53,753 --> 01:35:54,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.

1538
01:35:54,094 --> 01:35:54,894
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to take a break.

1539
01:35:55,054 --> 01:35:55,294
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1540
01:35:55,454 --> 01:35:55,935
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to pee.

1541
01:35:55,955 --> 01:35:58,877
[SPEAKER_05]: We are never covering Chill Einigi.

1542
01:35:59,037 --> 01:35:59,277
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1543
01:35:59,517 --> 01:35:59,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1544
01:35:59,957 --> 01:36:00,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Break time.

1545
01:36:00,678 --> 01:36:02,919
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back right after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1546
01:36:02,939 --> 01:36:04,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Real quick break for those of you guys on the podcast.

1547
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:05,881
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you in a couple days.
