00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We're your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Moloto.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, October 28th, 2007, a 360 fall update feature may have been leaked.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Smash Brothers lets you share instant replays, and could MySpace be the next great gaming outlet?

Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me, as always, say hello to Dark Sakura.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yo.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
How you doing, Dark Sakura?

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Been better.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, sorry to hear. But, you know, we have good days and not so good days.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yep.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Not so good day as well. I'll tell you about that in a moment.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I have a beer now, and that makes everything better.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I have Fiji water, and that makes things okay.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Let me, ah, except now I dropped the cap. Now everything sucks again. I hate my life.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Don't cry, emo Rob.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Say hello to tech master, Loki.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hello.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How you doing, Loki?

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm fine.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Doing better than myself and Dark Sakura?

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Probably.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Well, here's what happened, is that I kind of stage dived last night, but not on purpose.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Those of you guys have been listening...

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I forgot that stuff for you.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, that's all right. I'll live.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Those of you guys who have been listening to this show for a long time know that I'm involved with theatrical production of the Rocky Horror Picture Show,

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
which is, like, so different from what we do here on Orange Launch Radio, but, you know, hey, we all have a variety of different likes and stuff, right?

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So last night was the big Halloween show, and I was performing the criminologist role, which is what I usually do for them now when I'm not emceeing the show.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And right at the end, I was dressed up in my Halloween garb, and my costume this year is Jack Skellington.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'll have to go get my mask for the operator 11 people later so they can see, because it's actually a pretty rad costume.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But I was dressed up as Jack Skellington, but the problem was I had that mask on.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So as I was starting to exit the stage, I was walking down the steps, which have no handrail, mind you.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's about six steps to get from the top to the bottom.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And the emcee for the night was running up the steps the other way.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Well, so I started to walk down. I put my right foot on the first step.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I put my left foot down where there was no step.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So I tumbled and fell, and it was really bad.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Luckily, I didn't break a bone, so it could have been worse.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But basically, I landed in this pretzel shape, and I basically kicked my shoe dug in to the upper part of my thigh.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And I would show you on the webcam, except that might be indecent, because it's right next to my booty.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So no webcam scars on that one.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But I also skinned my knee, too.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This does not deserve happy music. Why is happy music playing?

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's trying to cheer you up.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's saying, don't cry, Rob.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Bad news over happy music.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's saying, Rob, next time remember to hit the stop button when the intro's done.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Anyway, so that's why I'm a little bit in a foul mood tonight, because I'm in pain.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Ooh, do you have drugs for me?

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I do. I'm going to give you three of them.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Awesomeness. Awesome.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Well, let's talk about...

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You want some Vicodin, too? I have some of that.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No, I don't want Vicodin. Vicodin won't make me very sleepy.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
All right. Anyway.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I can't have any because I have a beer.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I might really be documenting that you're giving me...

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm giving you Ibuprofen. You could just pay for Advil.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yes, Ibuprofen is exactly the same thing.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
All right, anyhow.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Let's go to Dark Sakura with How Was Your Gaming Week?

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Nobody cares about my ass anymore, so let's talk about our gaming weeks.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Dark Sakura.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I played horrendous amounts of Ragnarok online,

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and I played a little guitar here of three today,

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and my dumb butt husband...

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I love my husband to death, but, man, I'm mad at him.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He was supposed to bring me Super Mario Galaxy on Thursday.

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He didn't.

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I cried because the game's not out for a little while,

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and usually when the demos from Nintendo come, they're full versions.

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I was going to say that's what I heard is that the demo

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
at GameStop and GameCrazy right now is the full version.

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah, and he was supposed to bring it home so that I could play it for great justice.

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's only a couple weeks away.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't care. Want.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Do want.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm impatient.

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's my right as a woman.

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm thinking of modding my Wii to have a mod chip on it.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You know, for just modding stuff, not for piracy or anything.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You should put a spoiler on it and lower it.

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It can't get much lower.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I mean, it's like the width of three DVDs, cases at least, but I don't know.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Eh, whatever.

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
All right.

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So, no Super Mario Galaxy for Dark Soccer this week.

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Sorry to hear it.

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Sad face.

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
How about Ragnarok?

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You still been active on the Ragnarok rack?

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Oh, yeah, and I have a new obsession in that game.

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What's that, Pray Tell?

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's buying old blue boxes.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Because you get something random every time,

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and sometimes you get something really great,

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and sometimes you get crap like a feather,

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and then sometimes you get something really cool

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
like I got a funeral hat that looks like a brown bag.

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I still love the SARS mask the best.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That was always my favorite.

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
They have a new SARS mask that's black.

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Cool.

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So I have one on my assassin now.

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Nice.

109
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And for anyone who doesn't know,

110
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm playing on the Deliverance Ragnarok online server,

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
so don't find me.

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll be making a guild for Orange Challenge later

113
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
if anyone wants to play with me.

114
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Don't ask for heal, please.

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Hey, I don't play support classes, okay?

116
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The closest I come to support is I'm playing a dancer.

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Nice.

118
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Just so she can walk around like a hoochie with a whip.

119
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
For fun.

120
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
For fun.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I've got a gunslinger, though.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He's pretty cool.

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He's wearing a pimp hat.

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
All right.

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But, yeah, that's about it.

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
All right.

127
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Well, Loki, how was your gaming week?

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
My gaming week was okay.

129
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I didn't play as much as I thought I would be,

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
but I bought a copy of...

131
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Basically, I was too lazy to cancel my pre-order

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
for Ratchet & Clank Future Tools of Destruction,

133
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
so now I have a copy of it.

134
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And I haven't played it yet,

135
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
because I took the shrink wrap off of it and I'm like,

136
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
ooh, case, and put it down on the coffee table

137
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and on my way doing other things.

138
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I watched Nellie play Excite Truck because she's like,

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
hey, I want to play Excite Truck again,

140
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
so she's back into that again.

141
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's nice to see someone showing the Wii a little love

142
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
once in a while.

143
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Dude, Excite Truck is awesome,

144
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
and it seriously is the best Wii game, I think.

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And I don't give a shit about Zelda.

146
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't give a shit about Metroid.

147
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Excite Truck is where it's at.

148
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
If not the best game on the console,

149
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
it's definitely the best racing game, so whatever.

150
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Anyways, I did play some Halo 3 multiplayer last night.

151
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That was kind of fun.

152
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
We went to a Halloween party,

153
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and so we did split screen and live multiplayer,

154
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
and that was fun.

155
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And then I played some Orange Box,

156
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
played more Portal.

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm playing more Conan, and that's an okay game.

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It'll be fun to play through it,

159
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
but then after that, eh,

160
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I won't be playing any more after that.

161
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And then on the PSP,

162
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I've been playing more of the Jackass game

163
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
so I can finish it and delete it.

164
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I mean, sell it back.

165
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And then what else?

166
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Oh, Guitar Hero 3.

167
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I tried a little bit of that.

168
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It is Guitar Hero.

169
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Fuck, there's not really much I can say about it.

170
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's not innovative or anything.

171
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's just I broke my guitar

172
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
because a lot of people might not remember

173
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
our Op 11 show that we did last week.

174
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We showed that my guitar had the orange and blue buttons

175
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
out of order on there for some reason,

176
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
which is weird, so I tried to fix it.

177
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I fixed it fine.

178
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I took it apart just fine.

179
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Unfortunately, it's designed slightly different

180
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
than, say, the retail Guitar Hero 3 guitars

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
because in the retail ones,

182
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
you're able to take off the entire top of the guitar

183
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
so you can change faceplates and whatnot.

184
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Well, the wired version of it, or the demo kit,

185
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
has a screw in there

186
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
because they don't want you taking it off.

187
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So I pulled the screw out,

188
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and then I pulled it out,

189
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and it really was stuck in there.

190
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So I finally got it undone,

191
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
switched out the buttons,

192
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
put it back in there,

193
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and forgot to put the faceplate on there,

194
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
so I had to pull it back out again.

195
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Well, my second time pulling it out,

196
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
unfortunately, I ripped the ribbon cable in half,

197
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
so it's broken.

198
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Nice, good job.

199
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And I threw it away.

200
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We're going to read some comments real quick

201
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
to our Gaming Weeks

202
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and use this opportunity to introduce the chat room.

203
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
We always tape live on Sunday night,

204
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and that allows us to interact with our listeners.

205
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Chat.orangelandtrader.com

206
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
is the place to be Sunday at 6 p.m. Pacific when we tape.

207
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Let's see, so we have JAP28 wants to know,

208
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
why not just paint them, Loki,

209
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
in regards to the switch buttons?

210
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Because it wasn't that hard to take them apart

211
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
to switch out the buttons.

212
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's just that it's not designed to be taken apart,

213
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
because obviously they don't want

214
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
the top half of the guitar being stolen

215
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
by some dumbass playing the game,

216
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
so they put a ribbon cable through there

217
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
instead of an actual adapter to connect it to.

218
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So it's just because it was stuck,

219
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and it wasn't coming out,

220
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
so I had to pull harder on it,

221
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and unfortunately it just all of a sudden let loose

222
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and ripped the ribbon cable in half.

223
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Had I remembered to put the faceplate on it

224
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
when I was putting it back together the first time,

225
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
we wouldn't have this issue.

226
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It would be fine.

227
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's just, you know, who cares?

228
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's just, I've got another guitar already.

229
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't play multiplayer at my house,

230
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
and when I do, it's only going to be in rock band anyways,

231
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
so whatever.

232
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And yes, I do like to tinker with stuff,

233
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
as Blaze says in the chat room.

234
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Gerardimo comments in our chat room,

235
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
well, Loki, Excite Truck is up against

236
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
the other launch racing game,

237
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and that's really it.

238
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
There is more than just the one launch game.

239
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I mean, there was Need for Speed Carbon,

240
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
there was a crappy GT racing game,

241
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Monster 4x4 World Circuit.

242
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And were any of those games particularly memorable?

243
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
No, I played all of them, and they sucked.

244
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Especially the Monster 4x4 World Circuit and GT.

245
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Excite Truck is awesome.

246
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The problem is the company that's making it

247
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
doesn't really make anything else.

248
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
All they do is make racing games,

249
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
and before that it was some NASCAR Heat game

250
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
or something like that,

251
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
but get on it!

252
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Make Excite Truck 2, come on!

253
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I mean, seriously, just more of the same.

254
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You don't need to fucking innovate it.

255
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It was fine the way it was.

256
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It just needed to be longer, have more tracks,

257
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
maybe some downloadable stuff once Nintendo figures out

258
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
this whole download service or whatever.

259
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That would be kind of cool.

260
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But until then, I'm trying to play

261
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
every other racing game on the platform

262
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
to see if there's something sort of similar to Excite Truck.

263
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Then, of course, Mario Kart is going to be awesome,

264
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
but that's a different type of game.

265
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I mean, Nelly's not going to like that game.

266
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Going back to Dark Soccer's Gaming Week in chat,

267
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Shadowslier says,

268
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
First thing I install after I get Windows?

269
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Freaking Ragnarok, and it's all thanks to OLR.

270
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's because it's crack.

271
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Ragnarok.

272
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yep.

273
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
All right.

274
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Let's see, My Gaming Week, if you're all finished, Loki?

275
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I think I'm done.

276
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
My Gaming Week, I started off the week

277
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
playing beautiful Katamari,

278
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and I got to say, I'm a real big fan of the Katamari series.

279
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I love the two games on PlayStation 2.

280
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I don't like this one on Xbox 360,

281
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
because honestly, I feel like they phoned it in.

282
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I feel like it's kind of the last PlayStation 2 game

283
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
with widescreen, some small enhancements.

284
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I mean, I feel like a lot of the things you see

285
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
in a lot of the levels are very similar

286
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
to the stuff you see in PlayStation 2.

287
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
There's this one level with a playground

288
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
that seems really familiar,

289
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and the racetrack doesn't seem that upgraded.

290
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But here's what bugs me most of all,

291
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
and what makes me really feel like they phoned this one in.

292
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The cinematics are completely disappeared,

293
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
which is part of what made the last game so great,

294
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
is you got those little cinematics in between every stage.

295
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It was so weird.

296
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Also, the King of Cosmos,

297
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
all the charm that he had in the last two games,

298
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I really feel like is lost in this game.

299
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't know if that's because of some type of up-ramping

300
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
in the difficulty curve,

301
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
but I noticed that this time in a lot of the stages,

302
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
the big trick is that the King wants you to grab

303
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
all of a certain item.

304
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
For instance, there's one level where he wants you

305
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
to grab Japanese things.

306
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So you have to roll up as much sushi and fireworks

307
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and flags as you can that are Japanese.

308
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Or there's one level where you're supposed to roll up

309
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
nothing but hot things, which is kind of a cool level.

310
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
There wasn't anything like that in the last game.

311
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Well, not a cool level, but a hot level.

312
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
There was something like that in the last game.

313
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yeah, there was the big fireball, huh?

314
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The campfire.

315
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That's right.

316
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So see, a lot of it kind of seems like

317
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
you've sort of seen it before.

318
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But here's the thing.

319
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I will collect all of that item,

320
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and then the King is like,

321
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
well, your katamari sucks.

322
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Even though I got it the size he wanted,

323
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
everything's like, wow, your katamari sucks,

324
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
and it needs more of this item.

325
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And you're kind of like,

326
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
dude, was this game bug-tested?

327
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It needs more cowbell.

328
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Do I really just suck this bad at katamari?

329
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You just need to say when he asks you to do stuff,

330
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
you're like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

331
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Roll over stuff.

332
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That's all I do, you know?

333
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Except for the fire thing,

334
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
because you have to be real careful with that.

335
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Otherwise, you'll keep killing him.

336
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah, I pretty much just roll.

337
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yeah, that's how I beat the stages now,

338
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
like I was trying to be careful in the beginning,

339
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
but I do feel like the difficulty curve

340
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
went up a little bit in this game.

341
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Because if you think about it,

342
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
each level that's themed after something like Japanese or whatever,

343
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
they're going to have tons of that item everywhere.

344
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So all you have to do is just roll over everything,

345
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and the majority of it will be that item,

346
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
and your katamari will be big.

347
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So I'm sorry, katamari fans,

348
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
but this one's the worst game in the series so far.

349
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Honestly, the only reason I would suggest...

350
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah, I would play the PSP version.

351
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Well, yeah.

352
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The only way I would suggest picking this game up

353
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
is if you don't have a PlayStation 2,

354
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
which I can't imagine there's that many people.

355
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I mean, I know there's somebody.

356
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We're going to get an email from somebody.

357
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But I can't imagine there's that many people

358
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
that only own a 360 that don't own a PlayStation 2.

359
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And honestly, just go back and play the first and second games again

360
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
because they're superior.

361
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm sorry.

362
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yeah, I know there's Xbox Live modes,

363
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
but they're kind of shiny.

364
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Lame.

365
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yeah.

366
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And then there's this whole downloadable content,

367
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
which takes me on another rant for a moment.

368
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And this is a call to all the other bloggers

369
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and podcasters and media types that might listen to this program.

370
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You know how the downloadable content on this game

371
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
has been discovered to simply be another unlock key

372
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
for items that are already on the disk.

373
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And it's not like we haven't seen this before.

374
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I mean, Dance Dance Revolution Universe comes to mind.

375
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
We had that.

376
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Can you think of any others, Loki, that you downloaded keys?

377
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Need for Speed, like practically every EA game

378
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
with the unlockable cheats and stuff.

379
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
We need to no longer call this downloadable content

380
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
because it's not.

381
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's not downloadable content.

382
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The content is not what you're downloading.

383
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
What are you downloading?

384
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You're downloading an unlock code.

385
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So we need to start referring to this stuff

386
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
when we see it as pay to unlock content

387
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
because that's what it is.

388
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's pay to unlock content.

389
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You know, in Ridge Racer, they had where you can unlock cars

390
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
and they call them keys, car key.

391
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You know, this is a download key, whatever.

392
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That makes sense to me to call it that.

393
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So from here on out on this show

394
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
when we discover things like this,

395
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
we're no longer going to refer to it as downloadable content

396
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
when we talk about it, review it on the show,

397
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
it will now be referred to as pay to unlock content

398
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
because that's what it is.

399
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Now, downloadable content, actual downloadable content

400
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
in my mind would be something like Elder Scrolls Oblivion.

401
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The characters in Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

402
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And you weren't just downloading a key for that?

403
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Actually, I didn't play the game enough.

404
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I think that you were actually downloading the full characters.

405
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
See, that's the hard thing.

406
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
They had to release a new version that already had them in it.

407
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That's true, that's true.

408
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That's going to be the hard thing about this

409
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
is that game companies are not up front

410
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
with this information usually.

411
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So that's why, you know, we're just...

412
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Well, they prefer it to be seamless to the customer.

413
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
We're just this tiny little show in somebody's, you know,

414
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
spare bedroom, independently run.

415
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But I'm putting a call out there to all the bigger folks

416
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
who might happen to listen to this program.

417
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I think we need to start asking developers

418
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
when they announce this content.

419
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Is this downloadable content or is this pay to unlock content?

420
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm not saying pay to unlock content is necessarily a bad thing,

421
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
but let's call it what it is.

422
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Let's not, you know, if you're going to do it this way,

423
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I think the consumers have a right to know what it is that they're buying.

424
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And you know what?

425
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I still bought the pay to unlock content in the realm of DDR.

426
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I bought, you know, the song pack.

427
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's not going to stop me from buying it.

428
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm not saying we have to boycott all pay to unlock content,

429
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
but I think we should be fair and call it what it is, pay to unlock content.

430
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So there you have it.

431
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And that even gets to the whole thing of why the fuck is it locked in anyways,

432
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
and why do I have to pay to unlock part of the game that I've already bought.

433
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That's stupid.

434
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Let's see.

435
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
NM64 says one advantage to pay to unlock content

436
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
is that it doesn't fill your HDD, your hard drive.

437
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Okay, fair, fair, but still it is pay to unlock content.

438
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And you know, it's something that you've bought that now you're having to unlock.

439
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You know, it's just, you know, it's a little bit janky.

440
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I can understand like if you're saying, you know, in those EA games

441
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
or whatever where you want to cheat and like say, okay,

442
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I want to unlock the cheat codes or something like that,

443
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
and I don't want to play through the game, I'm just going to buy them.

444
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Okay, well that's fine if you want to do that because that's your choice.

445
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But it's stuff that's in the game which I think caught on my eye

446
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
was too short anyways, and the fact that there was more levels in there,

447
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
that's kind of annoying.

448
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I think that's why this one particularly stings

449
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
and why we need to put our foot down with this one

450
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
because I think a lot of people feel even for considering

451
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
it was a $40 game and not a $60 game, it was still a little too short.

452
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And to have those unlock codes come out not even a week after the game is out

453
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
is a little bit of a punch to the gut, right?

454
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah, it's just like all the DDR unlocked songs, that's stupid too.

455
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
But I understand why they do that because of the licensing stuff,

456
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
yet at the same time I also think that they could probably, you know,

457
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
bundle in the licensing cost into the game

458
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
because I don't think that five extra songs are really going to cost

459
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
five extra dollars or something like that.

460
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
OL Army Blaze asks, is the $5 horse armor downloadable or unlock content?

461
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's downloadable, I mean granted it's shitty downloadable content,

462
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
but it is downloadable content.

463
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm not saying that downloadable content,

464
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
there's a perfect example of where download content

465
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
may not actually be better than pay to unlock content.

466
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
But I'm just saying, let the consumer know what it really is

467
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
they're spending their money on.

468
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Here's the other thing that people also forget,

469
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and it's pretty easy to forget it, but if you go to retail kiosks,

470
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
a lot of this downloadable content that costs you money,

471
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
like themes and stuff, is actually available for free

472
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
if you bring your memory unit and you can download it straight off there.

473
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I remember when Saints Row came out,

474
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
they had some downloadable clothes or something that you could get for it,

475
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
and it was all free on there.

476
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It costs you money on live, but it was free from the retail kiosks.

477
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So that's another option too, get one of those memory units

478
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
and check it every now and then.

479
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's what they're trying to do, but they don't advertise that shit,

480
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
which is annoying.

481
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So from here on out, we'll start on this show calling it what it is,

482
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
and I beg of the O.L. Army and the listeners of this program,

483
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
spread the word.

484
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Let's get it out there, let's put our foot down as gamers,

485
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
and demand the developers call their releases what they are.

486
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And that whole microtransactions thing, we'll save that for another day,

487
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
because then you're getting into a whole other ballgame.

488
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Anyhow, that's really pretty much it for my Gaming Week.

489
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Well, I did play some of the Xbox Live.

490
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I guess I should say real quickly,

491
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I did play some of the Xbox Live arcade games.

492
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I played Battlestar Galactica.

493
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Man, I love Battlestar Galactica, the show,

494
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
but the game...

495
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yeah, it was over in about ten minutes.

496
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I just couldn't get into it.

497
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It was not good.

498
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Exit, a little bit disappointing to me.

499
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It was much slower paced than I thought it would be.

500
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It was kind of a slow paced game, but I don't know.

501
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
To be honest, don't take that as my final word on the game yet,

502
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
because I didn't play it enough, so more to come on that later.

503
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And I've still been playing every extend extra extreme,

504
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
kind of exploring all the modes and that.

505
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And then lastly, I would say I just got Guitar Hero 3 today,

506
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
and cracked that open.

507
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Haven't gotten to play it enough to give my full review,

508
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
but I will say this, I do love the way that the game

509
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
ties into the internet with the GuitarHero.com site,

510
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
and how you can link your Xbox 360, or from what I understand,

511
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
PlayStation 2 or 3, whatever versions to the website,

512
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and you can have an online band and all this stuff,

513
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
and these online on the web leaderboards.

514
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I really like that kind of functionality.

515
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Is that that whole web 2.0 thing to an extent

516
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
that Sony was talking about before?

517
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I like that kind of stuff.

518
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Halo 3 does this extremely well, and it's part of the charm,

519
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
like with the pictures and everything.

520
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So it's kind of cool seeing games and other genres

521
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
getting into this.

522
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Now granted, the link code wouldn't work for me earlier today,

523
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
because I think everyone's hitting it.

524
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
But rest assured, sometime this week,

525
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
there will be an OL Army band that you all can join.

526
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So keep an eye on our forums for that.

527
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Rob, what did you think of the changes in interface during gameplay?

528
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You know, it's not bad.

529
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I was a little hesitant to hearing that harmonics

530
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
was not going to be behind it and it was going to be never soft,

531
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
but considering they built the whole thing from the ground up,

532
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
it's not bad.

533
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm hearing things about some frame rate issues that people are having.

534
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I haven't noticed it yet, but then again, keep in mind,

535
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I've only really played like five songs so far.

536
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I really like how it looks a lot better now.

537
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The cool thing about them having built the thing from scratch

538
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
is that they didn't just up res something they had before,

539
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
as in the case of Guitar Hero 3.

540
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's really clean.

541
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's from the ground up.

542
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And I love the cartoon stuff in between levels.

543
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yeah, that was great.

544
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
That's rad.

545
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Dan was saying today, he's like, I love the bassist.

546
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yeah, honestly, this is kind of like the step up

547
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
that I think Guitar Hero 2 should have been in a way.

548
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Not that I'm saying Guitar Hero 2 is bad,

549
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
but it's just kind of like there wasn't much there.

550
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It was kind of a rehash of the first game of New Haunt Songs.

551
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I think this is generally a step in the right direction,

552
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
but again, I need to spend a little more time with the game.

553
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I haven't played it online at all, but I'm liking what I see so far.

554
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
So if chat room, you guys have some comments,

555
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
chat.orangelaunchradio.com and we'll be reading those.

556
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm just trying to see what's going on.

557
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
A lot of folks were still commenting on the unlock,

558
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
pay to unlock stuff.

559
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Kevin DDR says, pay to unlock is only fine, in my opinion,

560
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
when you have low or no price for the game.

561
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Kind of like Xbox Live Arcade maybe,

562
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
but usually they don't really do much pay to unlock with Xbox Live Arcade.

563
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Or free to unlock.

564
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And the only thing you're paying is for the price of Xbox Live gold or silver.

565
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Well, silver is free.

566
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
But I'm talking about the Dead Rising costumes were free, right?

567
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
But you had to be connected to live to download them.

568
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I don't think many people have a problem with that

569
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
and that just kind of is an enhancement for those folks

570
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
that happen to be on the internet.

571
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Rob.

572
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Yes.

573
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You know what's bullshit about Guitar Hero 3?

574
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
What?

575
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
They took out Pandora.

576
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Did they? I didn't even notice.

577
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
They put in that stupid Midori.

578
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I like Midori.

579
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I hate her.

580
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
She's so stupid.

581
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I unlocked her green hair.

582
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I so miss Pandora because she was like the total goth rocker.

583
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Pandora was pretty cool.

584
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Maybe she's unlocked later.

585
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
No, she's not an unlockable.

586
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
She's completely not in it.

587
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
All right.

588
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
But we do have Slash now.

589
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
All right.

590
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Let's get to some housekeeping tonight

591
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
and then we'll get into the gaming news.

592
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Not a lot to say for housekeeping tonight.

593
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I do want to encourage if you didn't check it out,

594
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I mean now the game's kind of out there so it might not be as exciting.

595
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
But on Operator 11 we did do a Guitar Hero 3 retail unboxing

596
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
after the show last week

597
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
and we hope to bring you more stuff like that later.

598
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The chat room was asking if maybe we'd play some Guitar Hero 3

599
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
after the show tonight.

600
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I don't know because I'm kind of,

601
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
because of my injury and everything

602
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
and I don't know if we'll get to that tonight.

603
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Just imagine Guitar Hero 2 with different songs.

604
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm hoping that as the weeks go by,

605
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
we can do more of that,

606
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
especially if we're able to get our hands on things early and stuff.

607
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
We might be able to do some of that.

608
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So we'll see as long as we're not violating NDAs

609
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
or any of that fun stuff.

610
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
But sometimes they'll send demos

611
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and they don't care if people take screenshots or whatever.

612
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So why not stream it live on the web?

613
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
We'll see what happens.

614
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
More to come on that.

615
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
In the meantime,

616
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
check out our Myspace at Orange Lounge Radio on Myspace,

617
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
our live journal community at Orange Lounge,

618
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
and soon, our band on Guitar Hero,

619
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
which I'm hoping to create as soon as it will link up.

620
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So keep an eye on the forums for more information.

621
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Let's get to the news.

622
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Anyways, so the first thing also kind of ties in with Guitar Hero 3 here.

623
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
They've been doing some tests.

624
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
IGN actually did a little kind of testing of the Guitar Hero 3 guitars

625
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
and the Rock Band guitars

626
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
and the Guitar Hero 2 guitars, the Explorer,

627
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
to see whether they played nice with each other's games.

628
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And it looks like that the Guitar Hero 3 guitar doesn't quite work with Rock Band

629
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
and the same goes with the Rock Band guitar on Guitar Hero 3.

630
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But the Guitar Hero 2 Explorer model, at least on the 360,

631
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
does work with both,

632
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
so that's where you need to go.

633
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Buy that one instead.

634
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Now, of course, some speculation is, you know, why is it not working?

635
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Well, it might be that Activision, in fact it does say on the box,

636
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
only official guitars will work with Guitar Hero 3.

637
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And they've been known to do this in the past,

638
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
but they locked out guitars with Guitar Hero 2 on the PlayStation 2.

639
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And I remember some of the stuff from the third-party guitars from Guitar Hero 1

640
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
weren't working with it.

641
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And I'm not surprised that they're doing something like this

642
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
because they want to sell their guitars

643
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
and not allow third-party companies to make guitars.

644
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But Rock Band, though, Harmonics has actually come out and said

645
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
they welcome any third-party software

646
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
or they support any third-party guitars or accessories.

647
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You can't help but feel like, though,

648
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
that there's a little bit of, like, jabs going on here with this.

649
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Oh, yeah.

650
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I mean, I don't know if it's just an unfortunate coincidence for these guys,

651
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
but it does feel a little bit like you wonder if they're taking jabs at each other,

652
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
which is shit for the consumer.

653
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I mean, you know, but I guess according to that quote or whatever I had heard,

654
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
they were saying, you know,

655
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
well, we base it off the standard Xbox Live, you know, blah, blah, blah,

656
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
and if people make their controllers to the Xbox Live specifications,

657
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
then everything ought to work.

658
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
But for whatever reason, it doesn't seem to be working in this case,

659
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
which sucks for us in the end.

660
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Not for me, though.

661
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I resisted buying the bundle because I already had the Guitar Hero 2 controller, so.

662
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Well, there's a lot of, like, third-party adapters that they have out there

663
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
that require, like, for example, the ones that hook up a keyboard and mouse

664
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
via the USB, you have to have a wired controller plugged in

665
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
because it reads that identifier off of the wired controller

666
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
and thinks it's just a wired controller plugged in.

667
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Otherwise, it wouldn't work either because that platform is not open.

668
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It's just, you know, the third-party companies have to license that stuff,

669
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
so when the, you know, homebrew guys decide to make an adapter for it,

670
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
they have to kind of trick it,

671
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
and maybe, maybe someone will come up with an adapter for, say,

672
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
the Rock Band guitar, the Hook Up 2, the 360,

673
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
that also has, like, a wired controller plugged in

674
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
that will allow you to do this, kind of bootleg it.

675
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Or, in my opinion, the bigger company will hot-fix their game

676
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
to just make it work.

677
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
They'll find the specifications of the other guitar and just make it work.

678
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I don't know.

679
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
We'll see, though.

680
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Meanwhile, if you are heading out to buy Guitar Hero 3,

681
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
a word of warning from some folks who have been picking up their game at Walmart.

682
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Apparently, you know how the big thing about Xbox 360 is that,

683
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
woo, there's this new wireless controller for Guitar Hero 3.

684
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Well, apparently, check the box at Walmart,

685
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
because that may not be the case,

686
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
and this is something that was posted to the Score Hero forums.

687
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
This user named Torchy has started a thread.

688
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Warning to those buying Guitar Hero 3 at Walmart.

689
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Check your bundles, packaging carefully before you purchase

690
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
to ensure the correct guitar isn't closed.

691
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And they have included screenshots,

692
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
and yes, there are some bundles of Guitar Hero 3

693
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
that come with the classic red SG Guitar controller,

694
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
and there are screenshots all over this thread to prove that it's true.

695
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Now, who knows where this is coming from,

696
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
because I would think, well, this box, I mean,

697
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I don't think Walmart could have cooked these boxes up themselves,

698
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
so it seems to me like it's some type of agreement with the company, in a way,

699
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
for Walmart to stay the low-priced leader or whatever.

700
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
They have to take some things out.

701
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
They can sell it probably cheaper

702
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
and get rid of some of those older guitars.

703
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So...

704
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
That's completely false advertising, though.

705
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Not really.

706
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Well, it says it right on the box.

707
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I don't think it's false advertising.

708
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Yeah, I wouldn't say it's false advertising,

709
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
except it's kind of misleading for those of us

710
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
that have been following this game on the internet,

711
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
because we never knew that Walmart was going to do, ha ha ha, switcheroo.

712
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And unfortunately, some of these people who ran to the store at midnight,

713
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
picked up the first copy of Guitar Hero 3 on the shelves,

714
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
like, oh, I've got to get that, you know,

715
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
and they maybe didn't think to read the box first,

716
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
because they were just so excited, right?

717
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You know, who can fault them?

718
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Hey, but hey, here's one thing, though.

719
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You can always take it back to Walmart,

720
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
because they'll take returns on almost anything.

721
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
That is a very good point.

722
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Walmart also has a very liberal return policy,

723
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
and quite frankly, you ought to tell them,

724
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
this was not the game I was expecting to buy.

725
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
This is not the controller that you're looking for.

726
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Exactly.

727
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So, there you have it.

728
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
So, be careful.

729
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
A word of warning to those who are going to be buying their game at Walmart,

730
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
although maybe you ought to just go to, like, Target, Best Buy, GameStop,

731
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
one of the thousands of other places,

732
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
or Guitar Center, for God's sake, sells this game.

733
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Well, how about a good game?

734
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Let's go to Rock Band.

735
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Ah, Rock Band.

736
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Wait, I thought you liked Guitar Hero 3.

737
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I do, but I'm going for better.

738
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Oh, snap.

739
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
All right.

740
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I have high expectations of Rock Band.

741
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I hope you're not disappointed.

742
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So, there is a price point of $169.99 on it,

743
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
with 58 songs being 45 licensed tracks,

744
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
and 13 more unlockable,

745
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
and we have a complete list of songs,

746
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
if anybody wants to know.

747
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I would like to know.

748
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I would like to know the highlights.

749
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Read the songs that jump out at you as awesome inclusions.

750
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Well, Rolling Stones Give Me Shelter,

751
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
and The Who Won't Get Fooled Again,

752
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Boston Foreplay, Long Time,

753
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
David Bowie, Suffragette City.

754
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Oh, this game has David Bowie in it, and I'm happy it wins.

755
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
There's a cover of Paranoid by Black Sabbath,

756
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Don't Fear the Reaper,

757
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Blitzkrieg Pop by The Ramones,

758
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Detroit Rock City by Kiss, though, that makes me happy.

759
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
We've also got Rush's Tom Sawyer,

760
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
which is one of my favorite songs.

761
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Faith No More Epic,

762
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Pixies Wave of Mutilation.

763
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
This is my favorite REM song, Orange Crush.

764
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And we've also got Learn to Fly by Foo Fighters,

765
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Inner Sandman Metallica.

766
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
We've got Weezer Say It Ain't So,

767
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Radiohead Creep, and I love Radiohead.

768
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
BC Boy Sabotage, Black Hole Sun, I Think I'm Paranoid,

769
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Celebrity Skin.

770
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And then for the more current stuff, we have

771
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
OK Go, Here It Goes Again,

772
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Nine Inch Nails, The Hand That Feeds,

773
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Danny California,

774
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
The Killers, When You Were Young.

775
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And then one of the unlockable tracks is

776
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Bing Camaro, with Pleasure.

777
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Random ass thought here.

778
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I mean, it's kind of interesting because two of those bands

779
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
that are in the game, Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails,

780
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
have been in the news a lot lately about

781
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
kind of their defiance of traditional record releasing.

782
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
You know, obviously Radiohead put out their album

783
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
in rainbows on the internet for people to pay

784
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
whatever they want for it, and Nine Inch Nails

785
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
basically declared their independence from a record label recently.

786
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It kind of gets me thinking,

787
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
is this type of Guitar Hero rock band thing

788
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
a possible delivery method promotional tool

789
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
of new songs by these artists in the future?

790
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Yep, they've already said they want to do that.

791
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Wow, that's pretty rad.

792
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
They're going to be releasing whole albums

793
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
and they're going to be tying in stuff with MTV,

794
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
and that is definitely something that's going to happen with rock band.

795
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
You watch.

796
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Very interesting little tie in there.

797
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I'm pretty happy with the list though.

798
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I do want to say this though.

799
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Oh, I thought you had your hand raised.

800
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You had something you wanted to say.

801
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
No.

802
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Sorry, bad radio.

803
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I will say this though.

804
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Unfortunately, rock band did not have heart.

805
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I know, that makes me sad.

806
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
That does make me a little sad

807
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
because Guitar Hero 3 did have Barracuda,

808
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
which is all kinds of awesome.

809
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Because pre-'80s heart was the best.

810
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
That's right.

811
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And they were still that folk rock.

812
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Well, I don't know.

813
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I mean, some post-'80s, you know.

814
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Oh no, in the 80s they had Gem Hair.

815
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
They did have Alone too, which was like the best song.

816
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
They had Gem Hair.

817
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Anyway, thank you for the report on rock band, Dark Soccer.

818
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I think it's awesome.

819
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I wish they would have like, I don't know, Prodigy or something in there.

820
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
That'd be pretty awesome.

821
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Nine Inch Nails in there.

822
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
That's really sweet.

823
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
That's what I'm saying.

824
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
If like rock band does well,

825
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I really hope they put out something,

826
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:38,000
like something to appease those of us that didn't get more Beatmania in the US.

827
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And I know that's kind of a bit, you know,

828
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
a lot of the purists for Beatmania are probably going to go,

829
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
what?

830
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
But seriously, like I would like to see some type of like trance dance

831
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
using the Beatmania concept but improving on it.

832
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I think it'd be a lot of fun.

833
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
But using songs that we know a little more over here maybe.

834
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Not to say the songs in Beatmania were bad because they really weren't.

835
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Although I do feel the series has gotten a little stale

836
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
now that we're on what, 13th, 14th game.

837
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I would like to see stuff like Prodigy and all these other.

838
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
If they did something like that,

839
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I mean there's still even a lot of trance music and stuff out there

840
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
that's not mainstream unless you go to like a lot of clubs and raves and stuff

841
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
or you're in the scene.

842
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
You wouldn't really recognize a lot of it and it's still good music.

843
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
But anyways, put out a game with Above and Beyond in it.

844
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I swear to God I'm so there.

845
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I'll pay 60 bucks, 80 bucks for Control or hands down I'm there.

846
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
So some other interesting things.

847
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And this is kind of something we've talked about before with patents and stuff.

848
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And why the hell isn't Konami suing these people for using...

849
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Obviously since Guitar Freak's Drummania came out way long before

850
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Rock Band or Guitar Hero even around.

851
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
So what's up?

852
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Well apparently actually Harmonics and they've been licensing

853
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
the rights to use this stuff.

854
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Including the patents for the guitars are being licensed from Konami.

855
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
However for the drums stuff they're not licensing it since that's actually being...

856
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
They're using patents from Drumscape.

857
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
If you remember that MTV arcade drum game that came out a long time ago.

858
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Vaguely.

859
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I think I like saw it once and thought it looked kind of dumb.

860
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I never played it.

861
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
So that was pretty interesting.

862
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And also of course Activision is also licensing the rights for guitars as well.

863
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
So, you know, Konami doesn't need to necessarily bring out the game here

864
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
because they're making money outside from the sales of these.

865
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Gotta go to chat.

866
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
chat.orangelaunchradio.com

867
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Legend of Zaku says, fuck you Sky.

868
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Konami needs to do it, not Harmonics Red Octane in regards to Beatmania.

869
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
If they want to do it, great.

870
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
But I'm not going to sit around and wait.

871
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
You know what I mean?

872
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Like, I would totally support Konami doing this.

873
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I wish they would.

874
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I think they could do an awesome job with it.

875
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
But they're not.

876
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
You know what I mean?

877
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Yeah, they're testing 2DX Gold in America, but that's not going to do it.

878
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
For those of us that have been hardcore into Balmaini for a long time,

879
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
yeah, that's awesome news.

880
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
But where did Guitar Hero succeed where Guitar Freaks did not?

881
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Guitar Hero brought songs everybody knew and everybody wanted to play

882
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
and people wanted to rock out in their living room to well-known songs.

883
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Unless Konami is willing to invest a little money in a powerhouse song list,

884
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
not going to happen, I'm sorry.

885
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
To me, that's fact.

886
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And that's based on the success of Guitar Hero.

887
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
But if Konami wants to step up their game on Beatmania, I totally support it

888
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
and I think they could kick some major ass and beat these other guys to the punch

889
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
and show us why Konami was first.

890
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I don't think they should bring it over.

891
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I don't think they will.

892
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I don't think they should because to be honest,

893
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Konami, especially in their Balmaini line,

894
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
has not been innovative in the last ten years.

895
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Seriously, what have we seen come out of there?

896
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I mean, Extreme and Supernova and the Universe series

897
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
and hell, Hottest Party, that shit is not innovative at all.

898
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
It's just fucking copying and pasting shit from other games.

899
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I agree and I don't because I actually thought some of the single-player modes

900
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
in Ultramix, I love Ultramix too.

901
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I'm not talking about Ultramix.

902
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Ultramix is fine, but they innovated a little bit when they brought it to the Xbox.

903
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
But I'm talking about Universe.

904
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Universe, they didn't do shit with it and it's very evident.

905
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I mean, how many download packs were there for?

906
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Oh yeah, one.

907
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Paid unlock packs.

908
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Paid unlock packs, my mistake.

909
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
One.

910
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
One is the only thing that they had for it.

911
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I mean, later on they could have had different unlock packs and stuff, but no.

912
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
But they're going to just release another retail version of the game six months later

913
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
because you know what?

914
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
You can make money off of it.

915
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
A lot more than you would those download packs.

916
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So, I mean, this is what they did with Karaoke Revolution.

917
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I hear you and I don't because I feel like Guitar Hero 2 kind of did the same thing with the first Guitar Hero.

918
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You know what I mean?

919
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
They did.

920
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
They did.

921
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I mean, and they did it with the Rock the 80s thing.

922
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I mean, they were just trying to make more money on the side.

923
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And yeah, they haven't innovated either, but that's the thing.

924
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And that's why Guitar Hero 3 is very encouraging to me so far because I see like this online thing.

925
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And I see like, okay, this really feels like a step up.

926
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Maybe Konami needs to take a page out of what's going on here, hand it off to some other developers.

927
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
But see, that's the thing though.

928
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:25,000
It's like I can get excited about their arcade releases because that's some cool stuff that they're doing there.

929
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
But when their home releases come out, you know, nowadays I don't give a shit.

930
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
It's like, ooh, another DDR game.

931
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
That's really cool.

932
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I mean, but who cares?

933
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
It's not like something I'm running out to the store and going to buy.

934
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I used to because it was really exciting to see all these new songs and stuff.

935
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
But now it's just so watered down, they just don't care anymore it seems like.

936
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
It's like whatever, you know, it's DDR.

937
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
People will buy it because you'll exercise to it and stuff.

938
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And that's the crowd that they're going after.

939
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
They don't care about the people that like the game.

940
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Tonight's show is very interesting.

941
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
This is the throwback to our old days, for those that may not know.

942
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Check us out the first time.

943
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
The first three years of our show or so, we were all about strictly music-based games

944
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
and talking about the DDR community and tournaments and then other things going on.

945
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
So very interesting tonight that we have all this music gaming news.

946
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
It's been a real throwback to our heyday.

947
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
So if we sound really passionate about these issues, it's because we are.

948
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Loki, myself, DarkSakura, you know how we met?

949
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Golfland, DDR.

950
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Road trips to Miggle in the Bay.

951
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
We should do that again.

952
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
To play B-Mania 2DX.

953
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
This is how we should.

954
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Like a throwback road tour.

955
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I want to make it a regular thing again.

956
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It would be fun.

957
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Anyhow, hey guess what, the music news does not stop there

958
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
because now we have DDR Universe 2 is coming out a little later this year,

959
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
before the end of the year.

960
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
And the song list for that was just recently released.

961
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I'm going to give DDR Universe 2 a shot because I actually did enjoy Universe 1,

962
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
although there were some major, major flaws in it.

963
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
But I like the song list, which usually is the...

964
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
That's the core part of any DDR game.

965
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
If it has a shitty song list, you're not going to want to play it.

966
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
So make what you will of this song list for DDR Universe 2.

967
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I'm not going to read the whole thing, but let me tell you some of the licenses.

968
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Take Me Out by Franz Ferdinand.

969
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
The Way You Move by OutKast.

970
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Walk Like an Egyptian by The Bangles.

971
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Rocket by Herbie Hancock.

972
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Safety Dance with Men Without Hats.

973
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
He's the Greatest Dancer by Sister Sledge.

974
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
We've got a lot of throwback songs in this one.

975
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And let's see, Fire by Ferry Corston.

976
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I'm trying to see what else is here on that list.

977
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
We also have some pretty cool Konami remixes

978
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
because we have a new Contra medley mix by Niko Jira.

979
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It's going to be in there.

980
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
So pretty cool.

981
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Oh, Jelly Kiss is going to be downloadable, it looks like.

982
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
They have also announced some of the songs that are going to be in the first download pack.

983
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And I hope this isn't Pay to Unlock, we don't know yet.

984
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Oh, I bet you it is.

985
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I bet you it is too, because that's why we already have the songs for it.

986
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
But we'll see.

987
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
So we don't know what to call it yet, but there will be some additional content for the game

988
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
that include a lot of songs that were in the UltraMix series.

989
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Oh, look at that!

990
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Dynamite Rave is a download pack.

991
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Or a download...

992
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
We don't know.

993
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Pay to Unlock song.

994
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Dynamite Rave.

995
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Who cares?

996
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Seriously.

997
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
SSJ100Matt says Konami will never get the great licenses that Rock Band and Guitar Hero have.

998
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Well, they should.

999
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
It's not like they're broke, right?

1000
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
They could if they wanted to, in my opinion.

1001
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I don't think they really need to.

1002
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And I think Guitar Hero should be a lesson in what happens when you don't do it.

1003
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I don't know.

1004
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Whatever.

1005
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Anyway, lots of hate throwback to the old days music gaming,

1006
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
but there's other console-type news we want to get to, such as release dates.

1007
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Yes, Jamie?

1008
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Well, for our friends in the UK, on the 31st is Mutant Storm Empire on Xbox 360,

1009
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
and Tony Hawk's Proving Ground on the 31st.

1010
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And then coming up on November 1st, we have Need for Speed Pro Street for the mobile phone.

1011
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,000
We have on the 2nd, Avatar the Burning Earth on Xbox 360, Blade Storm the Hundred Years' War,

1012
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:28,000
FIFA Manager 08, Hellgate London, Naruto Rise of the Ninja and Naruto Ultimate Ninja Heroes,

1013
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
NASCAR 2008, Chase for the Cup, NBA 2K8, Sonic Rivals 2,

1014
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Syphon Filter Dark Mirror, Tabula Rasa on PC,

1015
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
The Simpsons Game, Tony Hawk's Proving Ground,

1016
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Warriors of the Lost Empire, Sam & Max Episode 201, Ice Station Santa.

1017
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Oh wait, I'm getting ahead of myself because that's on the 8th.

1018
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
So that's it.

1019
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Santa.

1020
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Santa.

1021
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Anyways, in the US, there's quite a bit of stuff coming out,

1022
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
including the ever-controversial Manhunt 2,

1023
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
finally making its way out on PlayStation 2, PSP, and the Wii.

1024
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I'm sure we'll see a lot of that in the news probably in the next few weeks.

1025
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Of course, today Guitar Hero 3 came out, so go pick that up.

1026
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Other platforms, Disgaea Afternoon of Darkness on PSP.

1027
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Let's see, we've also got Ben 10.

1028
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
That's coming out on quite a few platforms.

1029
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:33,000
PlayStation 2, PSP, Wii, and I believe the DS.

1030
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Also, there's Cars Mater National, which is a sequel to the Cars game that came out last year,

1031
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
which sucked, by the way.

1032
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:46,000
That was another one of those launch racing games that God knows blew for the Wii.

1033
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Anyways, let's see here.

1034
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Also on the Wii, Battalion Wars 2.

1035
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
That one actually looks pretty good.

1036
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
That's coming out this week.

1037
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And let's see, The Simpsons Game.

1038
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
It's going to be out on almost everything.

1039
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,000
PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, 360, the Wii, and DS.

1040
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Also on the PlayStation 3 this week, the Ever Delayed Stranglehold.

1041
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
That's going to be coming out as well as the collector's edition.

1042
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And let's see, on PC we have Hellgate London.

1043
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
That's going to be coming out as well as The Witcher.

1044
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And let's see, on DS, Barbie Island Princess.

1045
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Yay!

1046
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
That's also coming out on the Wii, I believe, and PS2.

1047
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
What exactly does Barbie do in Island Princess?

1048
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It's based off some DVD that came out.

1049
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Does she vote off her friends off the island one at a time in Who is the Prettiest Supremacy?

1050
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I don't know.

1051
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
What else is coming out?

1052
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Assault Heroes.

1053
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
That's also coming out on PC.

1054
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
That was an Xbox Live Arcade title as well.

1055
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
As seen with that Battlestar Galactica game.

1056
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
That's also coming out.

1057
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
The Command & Conquer Saga, also on PC.

1058
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
That was the one that came with practically every single Command & Conquer game ever released.

1059
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
That's pretty awesome.

1060
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:17,000
And let's see here, I think that's it as far as PC goes.

1061
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:26,000
And then this week, also Naruto, Rise of a Ninja on 360, Viva Pinata Party Animals on the Xbox 360.

1062
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Woohoo!

1063
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And then Virtua Fighter 5.

1064
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
That's also coming out.

1065
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Oh, and Time Shipt on Xbox 360 as well.

1066
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Chat comments, GS68 says it's a fucking Barbie game.

1067
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Skip!

1068
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Frisbee says the tribe has spoken.

1069
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Ken, pack your bags.

1070
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Oh, and Ratatouille Food Frenzy on DS, which is a ripoff of Cooking Mama.

1071
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,000
That may not necessarily be a bad thing, because now you're mixing Cooking Mama with Disney Pixar franchises.

1072
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
That could be okay.

1073
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Pixar can do no wrong.

1074
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
What?

1075
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Pixar can do no wrong.

1076
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I don't know.

1077
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I don't know.

1078
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
In the video game realm, they've licensed their stuff out questionably before.

1079
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
But Pixar didn't do it.

1080
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
They just licensed it.

1081
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
That's true.

1082
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Pixar themselves can do no wrong.

1083
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
It's THQ they released it, so.

1084
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Well, THQ can do some wrong.

1085
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Yeah.

1086
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Hopefully they won't.

1087
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
We'll have faith.

1088
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Going to Japanese release dates.

1089
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
We're ready for those.

1090
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Japanese release dates.

1091
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Xbox 360 seeing a lot of games getting a price cut this week, and we'll find out why a little bit later.

1092
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:32,000
But Dead or Alive 4, Dead Rising, Gears of War, The Idolmaster, Project Silpheed, a lot, a lot of games getting price cuts.

1093
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:39,000
As far as new games go, you can check out Ace Combat 6, The Fires of Liberation, and Viva Pinata Party Animals coming out on the Xbox 360 in Japan.

1094
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
This week.

1095
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Going to some other platforms on the Nintendo Wii.

1096
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Opuna is coming out in Japan on the 1st of November, as well as Super Mario Galaxy.

1097
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Opuna looked weird.

1098
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Wasn't that that one where you control the entire game with like the nunchuck?

1099
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I believe that is the game, yes.

1100
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I'll pull up more information.

1101
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I'll come back to that in a moment.

1102
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:05,000
And read some other release dates, such as the PlayStation 3 is getting GI Jockey 4 2007.

1103
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
We know that here is winning post 7.

1104
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And Railfan, Taiwan High Speed Rail.

1105
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Go Trainsims.

1106
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I guess, yeah, there you go.

1107
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:27,000
High Speed Trainsim goes to Turbo Speed on the PlayStation 2 MotoGP07, another port of GI Jockey 4, and Super Robot Tyson Scramble Commander II.

1108
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Just what we need, more Robot Tyson.

1109
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
That's right.

1110
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Oh my God.

1111
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
They're in the anime series now too.

1112
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
That's kind of cool.

1113
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I played one of the Robot Tyson games that had the EVA units in it.

1114
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
It was pretty cool.

1115
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Oh, I forgot to mention a couple also in the US.

1116
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Disney's High School Musical, the game.

1117
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Let's get that for Shane.

1118
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
High School Musical Sing It on PlayStation 2.

1119
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
You know what I bought Shane for his birthday?

1120
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
What?

1121
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Just going on a total tangent here.

1122
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I bought him tickets to see High School Musical on Ice here in Sacramento, and then he moved to Kansas.

1123
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
So, I don't know.

1124
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I'll go with you.

1125
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Well, he has to send me the tickets because it's this weekend.

1126
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Oh, dude, tell him to send them back.

1127
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I think he still has the tickets.

1128
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Tell him to FedEx it.

1129
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I'll go with you.

1130
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Well, FedEx me your birthday present because Jamie and I are going.

1131
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I'll go.

1132
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I'll totally go.

1133
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
You really want to go see High School Musical on Ice?

1134
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I just want to go do something.

1135
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I don't know.

1136
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
It's just going to...

1137
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I've never been to see anything on Ice.

1138
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I know this is going to sound really wrong, but it just sounds so gay.

1139
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I want to go.

1140
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I petition that they have Manhunt 2 on Ice because that would be something I would like

1141
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
to see.

1142
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Blood bounces.

1143
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I don't even think I could get my boyfriend to go see High School Musical on Ice with

1144
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
me.

1145
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
That's how gay it is.

1146
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
That's, like, super gay.

1147
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
That's like it's gay enough to like High School Musical.

1148
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I would go see it for the novelty.

1149
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
And the fact that it's on Ice.

1150
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Why do people need to put things on Ice?

1151
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Stop encouraging ice skaters.

1152
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I mean, seriously, it's not a sport.

1153
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I love ice skating.

1154
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Ice skating is great.

1155
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
It's horrible.

1156
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Ice skating is fun.

1157
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
My mom used to be an amateur roller skater and did figure roller skating.

1158
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Roller skating is fine.

1159
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I still don't like the figure skating part.

1160
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Roller derby is cool, though.

1161
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Actually, it's kind of lame.

1162
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
We have a roller derby team in Sacramento that they wanted me to audition for.

1163
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
That's awesome.

1164
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I could punch people.

1165
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I'd be good at it.

1166
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
You know, though, you totally reminded me of something I didn't mention in my gaming

1167
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
week.

1168
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
What?

1169
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
We have Ace Combat 6 with a controller.

1170
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Oh, how's that going?

1171
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I get totally motion sick on it, but it's really cool.

1172
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Cool.

1173
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
The controller is really nice.

1174
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
You know how they could get more people to go to E for All next year?

1175
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Put it on Ice.

1176
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
E for All on Ice.

1177
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I've never been ice skating, Rob.

1178
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Yeah.

1179
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I've never been ice skating.

1180
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Although, I hear E for All might get put on ice anyway.

1181
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
You've never been ice skating at all?

1182
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Never.

1183
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
We're going to go.

1184
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Okay.

1185
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
We have to for this Christmas.

1186
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
We're going to go because when my leg gets better, though.

1187
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
We can't do it this week, but when my leg gets better, we'll go ice skating for sure.

1188
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Just in time for the holidays.

1189
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
But I've been water skiing.

1190
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Good times.

1191
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Ice skating sucks.

1192
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I hate it.

1193
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I've tried it.

1194
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
It's okay, but it's lame.

1195
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I'm really good at roller skating, though.

1196
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I used to be able to do all kinds of stuff.

1197
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Cardamo says roller skating on ice.

1198
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Tigerclaw says DDR on ice.

1199
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
No.

1200
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
There you have it.

1201
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Do not want.

1202
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
GS68 says Mario Kart on ice.

1203
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Oh, wait.

1204
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
They actually have those stages.

1205
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
You want to play Mario Kart in real life?

1206
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Go to that RPM place that's near here.

1207
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
That's lame.

1208
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
That's like real life Mario Kart without the shells.

1209
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
You can't pass people because their tracks are too small.

1210
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I had fun.

1211
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
William and I went on a date once to go to the...

1212
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
We had fun.

1213
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
It was cool.

1214
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
If the tracks were a lot bigger, I mean, hell yeah.

1215
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Because you can drift around those corners and stuff.

1216
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
It's a good time.

1217
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
But then some of those car tires are all fucked up.

1218
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I've never been kart racing right here.

1219
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I've got a membership there.

1220
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
You wouldn't know the last time I did anything on a go-kart was Autopia at Disneyland.

1221
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
My first time going.

1222
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Really?

1223
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And I haven't done Autopia since.

1224
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Wow.

1225
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And before that, it was at the Miracle Strip in Panama City, Florida, which they tore down

1226
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
the Miracle Strip.

1227
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I never go on Autopia.

1228
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Isn't it on a track?

1229
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Isn't it on a lane?

1230
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Yeah, it is.

1231
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
They had this thing that was called like...

1232
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
It was another car type thing, but you could actually drive these little cars.

1233
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Like, you had a set path that they went on, but they weren't on a track.

1234
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
So you could actually run into people.

1235
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
It was great.

1236
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I'm sorry, internets.

1237
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,680
We were talking about Japanese release dates, and suddenly we got into RPM motor racing

1238
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,120
and all that stuff.

1239
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,120
That's why they listened to us.

1240
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,000
And the charity was still going into crap on ice.

1241
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Great.

1242
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Violent fight on ice.

1243
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,600
Rama says Pokemon on ice.

1244
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,600
Dude, I think they have that.

1245
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,600
I think they've done that.

1246
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,600
I think they've done that.

1247
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,600
Yeah.

1248
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,600
Did you see that picture on...

1249
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,600
I'm never going to get these dates on.

1250
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,820
Did you see that picture on Dig this week?

1251
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:27,200
The whole thing, it was the picture of Pikachu, and it looked like he had a Vageen.

1252
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,200
Okay, somebody in the chat room, please dig up that picture, because Loki and Dark Soccer

1253
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,600
gave me blank stares right now.

1254
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,240
I need to show them the Pikachu picture that was on Dig earlier this week.

1255
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,240
It was so funny.

1256
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,240
Did he have, like, camel toe?

1257
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:43,440
No, but it was like a giant blow-up Pikachu, like at an amusement park, and all these kids

1258
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,000
were going in, but it looked like...

1259
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,240
They were going in his crotch.

1260
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,240
They were going in a big pika-gina, pika-gina.

1261
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:57,760
That was great, yeah, I think you can put that on your original Trauma Center on Ice

1262
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,760
when...

1263
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,760
I'm sorry, can we...

1264
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,760
I need to finish the Japanese release dates.

1265
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,760
I apologize.

1266
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,200
That would help, Rob.

1267
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:08,840
On the Nintendo DS this week in Japan, Dragon Tamer, Sound Spirits.

1268
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,840
In the...

1269
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,640
How in the hell am I supposed to pronounce this this week?

1270
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:20,480
Zaiden Hojen Nippon Kanji Norioku Kenti Kyoukai Koshiki Soft 250 Manin no Kanken.

1271
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,040
That is the biggest fucking game name I've ever seen.

1272
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,640
It looks like it's some type of, like, brain training type game with, like, 250 different

1273
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,720
little minigames in it.

1274
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,720
Woof!

1275
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:35,620
Wow, let's see, also of note, I want to go to PSP dates real quick, and then we can move

1276
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:37,140
on with the rest of the show.

1277
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:44,200
So in Japan, on the PSP, just movies, no games this week, but if you want to pick up Gremlins,

1278
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,200
it's out this week.

1279
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,200
Gremlins is the best movie ever!

1280
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,440
Yes, I suggest you do.

1281
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,940
I forgot something I played this week, and this is worth mentioning, sorry to derail

1282
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:57,240
the whole show here, but I downloaded a CDI emulator.

1283
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,240
What?

1284
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:03,900
And they have a ROM online for Super Mario Wacky Worlds.

1285
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:07,260
It was an unreleased game that is awful!

1286
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,800
It was so horrible!

1287
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,720
And I played it for about five minutes.

1288
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,720
Here's the picture, Loki.

1289
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,040
Oh, that's pretty bad.

1290
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,600
What's the CDI should not, oh my god.

1291
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,960
Yeah, so, yeah, the pan is on, oh my god, it was so horrible.

1292
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,920
I mean, basically they just ripped the sprites and music out of Super Mario World and just

1293
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,880
took a dump on it, and that's basically what it was.

1294
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,880
Horrible.

1295
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,920
SSJ100Matt asks, worse than Hotel Mario?

1296
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,680
Yes, worse than Hotel Mario.

1297
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,680
Well, maybe not.

1298
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,560
GS68 says, you're just pissing in an ocean of piss.

1299
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:41,720
I know.

1300
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,720
By the way...

1301
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,160
But they did have all the Zelda games on there too, if you want to play them.

1302
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:49,480
I swear to god, we'll move on with the show just after I say that Upuna does look to be

1303
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:52,360
that game I think you were thinking about, it's actually, wait, no, it's a role-playing

1304
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,360
game.

1305
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,360
It is a role-playing game.

1306
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,360
You control the entire thing with the nunchucks.

1307
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,360
But it looks cute.

1308
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,400
I hope they release that over here, it's by Koei, and there's the little box art.

1309
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,920
You know what Koei gave us, Rob?

1310
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:07,600
They gave us that game with the girl riding a missile, KO Flying Squadron.

1311
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:12,560
I could say something about girls riding missiles, but I won't in light of moving on with our

1312
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,560
program.

1313
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,560
Forza 2!

1314
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:20,080
Downloadable content has a price cut because people bitched about it enough.

1315
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:29,240
So the Twin Ring Motegi track is going to be decreased from 600 points to 400 points.

1316
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,960
Please you're paying too much.

1317
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:38,120
Funny because when we complained about the Guitar Hero download content, they didn't

1318
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:41,240
seem to care.

1319
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:46,900
We're selling plenty of it, shut up.

1320
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:50,000
So an interesting rumor has come out this week.

1321
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,500
Apparently someone who had gotten their 360 returned back from Microsoft after being repaired

1322
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:01,920
noticed that there was a few additional options in their dashboard, including stuff for the

1323
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:10,880
360's IPTV feature that was announced, I want to say a Tokyo Game Show, Consumer Electronics

1324
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,880
Show, I think this year.

1325
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,940
Is either that or Game Developers Conference.

1326
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:19,200
One of those shows earlier this year, it was announced.

1327
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,720
Good reporting, Loki.

1328
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,720
Excellent reporting.

1329
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:22,720
Awesome.

1330
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:27,220
So apparently it's going to have different features including being able to pause and

1331
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:31,920
record stuff being streamed off there.

1332
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,080
Of course none of these features really worked on it, but it's interesting to see that that's

1333
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:44,680
actually in his dashboard now, so most likely going to be included in the fall update.

1334
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:48,180
Now what I want to know is how the hell did that happen in the first place?

1335
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:51,120
How did some guy get this random update?

1336
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:55,360
Because I guess if he shipped his Xbox back, did they just send him a new Xbox that were

1337
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:58,440
meant to be held off until the update goes live or whatever?

1338
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,480
Maybe because it doesn't look like it's the entire update.

1339
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,760
Maybe they had an updated firmware or something like that that's going to be rolling out.

1340
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,360
I don't know when exactly the fall update is rolling out.

1341
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:11,160
It's probably within the next few weeks, so they're just probably getting it ready to

1342
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,160
go.

1343
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,000
What I would be curious of is that in light of this news, I wonder if other people that

1344
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,860
are getting their consoles back from Microsoft are going to find the same thing.

1345
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:22,000
One of my LiveJournal friends just had to send back their Xbox for Red Rings of Death,

1346
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,160
so I wonder if his is going to come back with that.

1347
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,160
Maybe.

1348
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,760
I don't know.

1349
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,760
It's interesting.

1350
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:33,480
I can't wait to have the IPTV stuff because, shit, more shows to watch.

1351
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:37,080
Although I'm not too familiar with Microsoft's IPTV service.

1352
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,080
I haven't been able to stay on-

1353
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:43,840
I'm actually very unhappy that my place I usually watch TV online is going away.

1354
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,560
TVlinks.co.uk.

1355
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,560
They got shut down?

1356
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,160
Yeah, they're on their way.

1357
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,200
They went the way of Oink, which was another huge news story this week.

1358
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,200
Anyhow.

1359
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,120
How else am I going to watch bullshit?

1360
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,840
I don't know.

1361
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:00,840
Mininova or something?

1362
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,840
I don't know.

1363
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:06,600
Anyway, going back to the Xbox Live Marketplace and other Xbox news, Blue Dragon, which is

1364
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:10,800
a game I need to go back and finish, has some new content.

1365
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:16,720
Apparently there is a new six-treasure pack for Blue Dragon.

1366
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:21,520
You have to pay 200 points for it, but you get some new items that will allow you to

1367
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,320
boost abilities.

1368
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,520
It sounds like this is some pay-to-unlock content for me because you're going to get

1369
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:32,520
a Whimsical Mind, which randomly enhances things by zero to four levels.

1370
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,760
The Way of Thieves, a battle item that will automatically steal rare items possessed by

1371
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,000
enemy creatures.

1372
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,600
The DV Phonograph, which will let you listen to the DV tribe dance, which is so freaking

1373
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,600
cute.

1374
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,520
I actually want to get that song because I actually got to that part of the game.

1375
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,920
It is a really cute song.

1376
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:53,360
The Nothing Glasses, it visualizes all those points because you can search everywhere in

1377
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,360
this game.

1378
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:58,600
It will allow you to actually see the points that you can search with little star symbols

1379
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,640
instead of just going around aimlessly.

1380
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:05,160
The Shuffled Helmet that will adjust magical and speed parameters.

1381
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:10,240
The Spring Wind Scarf, which will adjust HP and speed parameters by 20%.

1382
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,860
Basically you're going to pay 200 points to make the game a lot easier, it sounds like

1383
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:15,860
to me, which is interesting.

1384
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:21,400
It kind of reminds me of the previous story we had a few weeks ago about the whole pay-to-get

1385
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,720
things you will unlock yourself later in the game, except you're not actually going to

1386
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,720
unlock the player, it just makes the game easier.

1387
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:30,000
Well, the glass download content you paid to make the game harder, so now you have a

1388
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,040
full range of stuff.

1389
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,040
Interesting.

1390
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:38,000
Also, I just want to mention real quick, Spider-Man 3 has a new unlock as well.

1391
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,920
You get to download New Goblin, and this is notable because it was a Playstation 3 exclusive

1392
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:47,420
feature, but now for 240 Microsoft points, you can have it on 360.

1393
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:49,980
Which I heard by the way is lame.

1394
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:50,980
I wouldn't know.

1395
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:56,480
I try to avoid games based off of movies unless they're really good, which I can't even think

1396
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,480
of any off the top of my head.

1397
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,820
I don't know why you would still have Spider-Man 3 anyways, because I think that game really

1398
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:07,000
sucked and so, you know, it's probably not worth anything right now anyways.

1399
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:13,760
Well, for our friends in Japan, the Xbox 360 is getting a price cut.

1400
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:18,000
Finally, we knew it would eventually happen.

1401
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:25,800
The price cut is going to happen on November 1st, and it should be the equivalent of $243.

1402
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,360
Wow, that's a big cut.

1403
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:29,360
Yep.

1404
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,360
Nice.

1405
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,240
And this would be also why all those games I read earlier are getting a cut as well.

1406
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,680
I'm sure this all ties in.

1407
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:40,220
Make the Xbox 360 a little more cheap and maybe it can get a little steam in Japan.

1408
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:43,120
I know there's a few 360 games that are going to be dropping in price.

1409
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,760
I can't remember which ones, and I also know that there's some being discontinued.

1410
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,760
Wow.

1411
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,720
Like, Perfect Dark Zero is one of them.

1412
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:50,720
I remember.

1413
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,200
Good riddance, I'm sorry, but not a fan of Perfect Dark Zero.

1414
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,000
Make way for Perfect Dark Zero 2.

1415
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,200
Nah, please no.

1416
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,720
Where you still can't jump.

1417
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,120
Fucking hate that.

1418
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,600
That's the thing.

1419
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,560
Next-gen system, no jumping.

1420
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:09,360
The one game you can jump quite far in, actually, is Burnout Paradise, which is going to be

1421
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:15,880
coming to the US in January on the 22nd, and that is going to feature an open-world environment,

1422
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:18,800
which is going to be kind of interesting, because I know none of the other games have

1423
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:24,000
been like that, but you can basically drive around aimlessly really fast, smash into stuff,

1424
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,920
jump through the air, explode.

1425
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,240
All the fun stuff that you would be looking for in a Burnout game.

1426
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,500
So it seems that publishers are starting to get a little smart in releasing stuff in these

1427
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:41,360
slow months, like January and February and the entire summer, instead of just March and

1428
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,840
November and October.

1429
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:48,920
I'm liking this whole trend lately where it seems like game companies are learning there's

1430
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,680
12 months in a year.

1431
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,200
It's kind of exciting.

1432
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:57,360
They need to seriously do that, because usually March, everything piles up there, because

1433
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,920
that's the end of the fiscal year for a lot of the companies, and in November because

1434
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,720
of the holidays.

1435
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:07,040
I understand why you do the holiday push with the little kid games and the things that tie

1436
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,660
into children's movies, like the Pixar movies and those like, I understand why you do that

1437
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:14,520
for the holidays, because those are perfect games to get children that are into Santa

1438
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,160
and all that stuff, right?

1439
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:20,720
But games like Burnout Paradise, that caters to a crowd that's going to probably go out

1440
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,960
and pick up a game whenever they damn well feel like it.

1441
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,120
So I don't think they're going to take a loss by releasing this in January.

1442
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:31,720
But it's good, though, that it's coming out in January and not like, say, November, when

1443
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,240
there's a ton of shit coming out.

1444
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:37,280
In January, I mean, January's actually looking pretty good game-wise so far.

1445
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:45,520
They have NFL Tour, Devil May Cry 4, God knows what else, and then as well as this now.

1446
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,520
If they put it in a month that there's really nothing coming out, people are going to buy

1447
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:52,240
that game instead of saying, well, I'm going to buy this one instead and save my money,

1448
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:59,000
and then later on they may just decide not to pick it up.

1449
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,280
Well some other games that you might be able to play through the Christmas season, and

1450
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,840
speaking of games that are geared at little kids, although I bet some big kids would like

1451
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:05,840
this, too.

1452
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:09,960
THQ has announced they are bringing four new games to Xbox Live Arcade, and some of these

1453
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,520
are very notable because they tie into Nickelodeon licenses.

1454
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:20,120
SpongeBob SquarePants UnderPants Slam is coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, and I have to admit,

1455
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:24,040
you know, hate me, call me names if you want, I think SpongeBob's hilarious.

1456
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,760
The movie was so funny, but in a stupid way.

1457
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,420
It's stupid funny, right?

1458
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:32,080
So I'm kind of curious to see what the game's like, because I worry, because it's not like

1459
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:35,720
this is the first time there's been a SpongeBob game, and most of the games are made of suck

1460
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:40,560
and lose, but this, you know, being an Xbox Live Arcade game, I imagine it's not going

1461
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:46,200
to be that great, but it does kind of open up Xbox Live Arcade to being, you know, a

1462
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:50,560
lot of times Microsoft takes some shit for not being very kid-friendly, and certainly

1463
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:54,160
you know Microsoft's going to be pushing this, especially with their new Xbox 360 arcade

1464
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:58,920
console really pushing the family thing when Cenet comes out and all that.

1465
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:02,360
That's part of their marketing, they have a whole family marketing plan that includes

1466
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:09,360
that, Cenet, DDR Universe, actually Guitar Hero 3, and then these titles as well, Viva

1467
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:15,080
Piñata Party, and then of course the Xbox Live Arcade stuff, and I know they did some

1468
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:18,520
other announcements about like cartoons and stuff, so.

1469
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:22,960
By the way, the other games that THQ is going to be releasing, a game called Screw Jumper,

1470
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,720
Elements of Destruction, and Rocket Riot.

1471
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:26,720
SpongeBob and Screw Jumper.

1472
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:27,720
Screw Jumper.

1473
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:31,400
Yeah, it's kind of an odd name, but they are both scheduled for release next month, so

1474
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,400
they'll be here in time for Christmas.

1475
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,000
You know what the world needs less of?

1476
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Hmm.

1477
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
SpongeBob.

1478
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Yeah, I love SpongeBob.

1479
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,120
Elements of Destruction I know is coming out in the DS next year as well.

1480
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:44,040
Screw Jumper, if you want to know what the hell that is, it's a vertical action racing

1481
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,840
game, that's per an interview from the developers.

1482
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:51,880
You have to destroy alien mining equipment and architecture while plummeting downward

1483
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,720
in a continual rapid free-fall descent.

1484
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:58,940
The objective of the game is to maximize score by crashing into and dynamiting as many alien

1485
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:03,520
structures as possible on the way down the mine shaft, then to initiate a detonation

1486
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,040
and race back to safety on the planet's surface.

1487
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,300
So honestly, this sounds like it might not be bad.

1488
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:12,040
It's got aliens, it's got explosions, it's fast, it's racing.

1489
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,120
Screw Jumper might be pretty awesome, we'll see though.

1490
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:18,120
But sometimes games that seem awesome in theory really suck, so we have to hold out until

1491
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,340
the demo's out.

1492
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:21,340
This November.

1493
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:22,340
That's so disappointing.

1494
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,200
What the hell did the alien miners do to you?

1495
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,560
I mean seriously, why do you have to destroy their shit?

1496
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,180
That's what I want to know.

1497
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:29,180
They're mining communism.

1498
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:33,000
Oh, well in that case, let's down with communism.

1499
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
That's right.

1500
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,360
I don't know where that came from.

1501
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,220
I don't either.

1502
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:42,320
It just seemed like the patriotic thing to say 40 years ago.

1503
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,320
Yeah.

1504
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:47,820
Drunami says, down with pants.

1505
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:49,920
Isn't this SpongeBob SquarePants?

1506
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:50,920
Maybe that's what they did.

1507
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,080
Maybe the aliens brought us SpongeBob SquarePants, and that's why they have to pay.

1508
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,000
Maybe the aliens are SpongeBob SquarePants.

1509
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,320
Maybe they're mining underpants.

1510
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:58,320
Underpants slam.

1511
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,800
That sounds kind of dirty.

1512
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:01,800
You know what?

1513
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,440
Nobody likes dirty underpants.

1514
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,440
You know what?

1515
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,440
Unless you're some sick fetishist.

1516
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,440
Yes, Jamie.

1517
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,300
I like watching real stuff, so.

1518
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,300
You know what?

1519
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:17,920
I miss all the stuff from when I was a kid, because they expected kids to follow the story.

1520
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:18,920
Imagination?

1521
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:19,920
Yeah, imagination.

1522
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,280
That's what the Muppet Babies was all about.

1523
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,280
What the Babies is great.

1524
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,240
Tell me that cartoon wasn't the shit.

1525
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:25,240
That's what that was all about.

1526
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,600
I'll tell you, though, what I've had a revival of lately.

1527
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,040
Loki wants to make a joke.

1528
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,920
Did you see Drawn Together Babies?

1529
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:34,120
No, God, no, I didn't.

1530
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,600
Drawn Together wasn't funny last season, so I've been watching it.

1531
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:40,280
I've been having a revival of Count Duckula.

1532
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,760
That's pretty awesome.

1533
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:42,760
And Danger Mouse.

1534
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:48,280
But I tried going back watching Banana Man, and my God, that was horrible.

1535
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:52,040
I can't believe I liked Banana Man when I was 12.

1536
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,040
So you like Banana Man?

1537
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,480
I used to like Banana Man.

1538
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,560
Very very weird little British tune.

1539
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:59,560
Next story, please.

1540
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,440
Yeah, Xbox 360 crap.

1541
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,440
How about that?

1542
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,440
Yay.

1543
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:08,080
Toshiba is saying no comment, except they didn't actually say comment, they just said

1544
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:09,080
no.

1545
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:13,920
It's about the Xbox 360 HDTVT rumor.

1546
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,200
So, wait a minute.

1547
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:23,680
I mean, because, no, would you like to comment on the internal Xbox 360 HDTVT track?

1548
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:24,680
No.

1549
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:29,640
Toshiba said no to the new Xbox 360 HDTVT rumor.

1550
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:33,160
But we pretty much all still think it's a rumor, so whatever.

1551
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,160
You know why this is newsworthy?

1552
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,160
We don't believe them.

1553
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,000
Yeah, you know why this is newsworthy?

1554
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,320
Because you know what they say about Microsoft rumors.

1555
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,320
They're all true.

1556
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,320
They're fucking all true.

1557
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:47,880
If they don't have any, if they don't reek of fanboyism, they're usually true.

1558
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:53,280
The fact that they said no comment instead of no we have nothing planned, you know, is...

1559
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,280
Exactly.

1560
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,280
No comment?

1561
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,280
Fuck.

1562
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,280
How'd they know?

1563
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,280
Goddammit.

1564
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:08,120
Anyways, one game I'm actually kind of excited to see coming to Xbox Live Arcade this week

1565
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:10,560
is going to be Mutant Storm Empire.

1566
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:13,960
And I loved the Mutant Storm Reloaded game when it came out, still one of my favorite

1567
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:14,960
shooter games.

1568
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,400
It was a little bit overlooked because it was too similar to Geometry Wars, I think,

1569
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,800
and it's slower paced.

1570
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:20,800
Yeah.

1571
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:21,800
This one, though, looks really cool.

1572
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,240
They have it set up a little bit different.

1573
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:27,760
Some of the changes you'll see from Reloaded is that the stages now, you actually kind

1574
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,920
of, it's one long stage, doors open up, and it's kind of almost like a cross between Geometry

1575
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:35,040
Wars and Smash TV almost.

1576
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:37,960
That's good, because one of the biggest complaints I heard about the last Mutant Storm game was

1577
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:42,840
that load between the levels, like that little stupid effect it would do, like it sounds

1578
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:48,080
like a dying cat, but not really, like between levels, as it's shifting, you know, that kind

1579
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,400
of slowed the action down.

1580
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,200
So you hear that it's one giant level, that's awesome.

1581
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,400
Like the fucking Wayne's World camera effects or something like that, you know.

1582
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,400
Yeah, exactly.

1583
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,760
That would have been more entertaining.

1584
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,520
But yeah, it's going to be coming out for 800 points.

1585
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:06,400
It's due out this Wednesday, October 31st, and it's going to be awesome.

1586
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:15,800
I hope since it's Halloween, we're going to get some cheesy Halloween tie-in on the Xbox

1587
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:16,800
Live Marketplace.

1588
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:17,800
Yaris 2!

1589
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:18,800
Because it's scary.

1590
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:23,760
That is pretty scary.

1591
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:29,520
This time, not only does it have tentacles, but it has mech destroyer legs that the car

1592
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,880
runs on.

1593
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:38,120
The game will just evolve into something that's not even Yaris, it's just like, whatever.

1594
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:42,160
I think for the next year, we should make every effort to make a Yaris joke every week

1595
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,160
on the program.

1596
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:47,740
Didn't that game remind you of like, the programmers of that After Dark screensaver decided to

1597
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:49,760
make a game and this is what it was?

1598
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,360
Guess what Jamie never played?

1599
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,360
What?

1600
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,360
Yaris.

1601
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,360
Well, it's probably a good thing.

1602
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:55,360
Yeah.

1603
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,000
Consider yourself one of the lucky ones.

1604
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
It's free.

1605
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Download me!

1606
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I'm free!

1607
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,200
I know it's a free game, hey, if it sucks, whatever, it's free.

1608
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,200
No, it's not worth it.

1609
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:09,360
You pay in the time of your life that you spend, you will never get back.

1610
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,840
You lose party for your soul after playing that game.

1611
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,440
That's okay, I don't got much left.

1612
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:16,860
In fact, I would like to actually open up our mailbag.

1613
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:20,000
I would like to actually solicit- No, because I have to read that.

1614
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Well, too bad.

1615
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,640
We got to make you work a little harder.

1616
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:27,320
So I would like to solicit your best Yaris joke.

1617
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,800
So I want to hear some Yaris.

1618
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,120
It can be about the game, hell, it can be about the car, I don't care.

1619
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,120
I was going to get one.

1620
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:34,040
I want some Yaris jokes in the mailbag.

1621
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:37,840
Not tonight, because we haven't gotten to the mailbag segment, we will, but for next

1622
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:41,960
week's show, you know, as you guys are listening to the podcast later, I want some Yaris jokes.

1623
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:45,280
Honestly though, how is this good advertising for the Yaris?

1624
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:50,400
I mean, now when you associate Yaris, you're going to think, suck, I mean, that's not-

1625
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,880
I wouldn't think that's a good thing that, you know, Yaris, oh yeah, that's right, that's

1626
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:57,040
a, you know, car that had a crappy game made for it.

1627
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:01,280
Or when I go shopping, and I like to see all the features of the Yaris, and they're like,

1628
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:05,880
oh yes, well it has the built-in air conditioning and the GPS unit and the, you know, the leather

1629
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:06,880
interior.

1630
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,800
I'll be like, yes, but where is the tentacle gun?

1631
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,000
Where's the giant death tentacle?

1632
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,920
That the commercials and- Where the fuck did I come out from, the stupid tentacle thing?

1633
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:17,920
That's weird.

1634
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,640
Anyway, sorry, we need to move on with the news.

1635
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:20,640
Sorry.

1636
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:21,640
Can we please?

1637
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:22,640
Yes, we may.

1638
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,640
Please, please, please, please, please.

1639
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:24,640
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1640
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:27,360
I'm very excited about Spore.

1641
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:31,200
You know, we've always heard these things, like Spore is not going to be out until 2009,

1642
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,200
holy shit.

1643
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:35,880
Well, now they're saying that Spore is about six months away.

1644
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:36,880
And how do we know that?

1645
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,280
Because that's what Will Wright said to BBC's Radio 5.

1646
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:45,080
Spore is in its final testing phases, and it's about six months away from release.

1647
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,840
That's a rough date.

1648
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:50,760
So it does kind of line up with the whole, we were thinking it wasn't going to be out

1649
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,680
in April, or until April 2008 anyway.

1650
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:58,440
So it kind of lines up with this, that it could be summer of 2008, you know, maybe late

1651
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,040
spring is when you're going to see this game.

1652
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,920
I would say it's probably going to be out summer of next year.

1653
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,360
If it came out in April, that'd be perfect.

1654
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:09,360
April is like the crappiest game for months, or game for the year, yeah, basically the

1655
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:10,800
worst month for games.

1656
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,980
So it's horrible.

1657
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:14,800
It would definitely be a highlight in a low month.

1658
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:15,800
Yeah.

1659
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:19,440
Speaking of highlights, we love to read the emails from our listeners every week, don't

1660
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,440
we, DarkSakura?

1661
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,440
Yes, we do.

1662
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,440
All right.

1663
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:25,560
I had a gun to her head forcing her to say that.

1664
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:27,960
No, we honestly do love hearing from the listeners.

1665
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,120
We got some good emails this week, from what I understand.

1666
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:35,800
So mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com is where you can send your emails.

1667
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,720
And every week, DarkSakura jumps on in and pulls out a few of her favorites.

1668
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:41,440
I don't think there's time to read them all tonight.

1669
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,440
There's six.

1670
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,440
Wow.

1671
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,760
Well, let's get started.

1672
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:45,760
Long segment tonight.

1673
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:50,120
This one comes from Ace Savior, I guess.

1674
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,600
He's an X instead of an S for Savior.

1675
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,640
Hey guys, first I will admit that I am pretty new to the show.

1676
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:59,960
I just found the show when I was looking for RSS feeds and podcasts on my PSP a couple

1677
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:00,960
days ago.

1678
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,360
I like the fact that you guys have a website made just for the PSP.

1679
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,160
Sorry that I haven't updated it in years.

1680
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:07,400
Too bad it never gets updated.

1681
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,400
Hey.

1682
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,400
Loki.

1683
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:14,920
I was going to do OLRE and I kind of, I did not re-register the, our main website's all

1684
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:16,960
kind of broken too, so anyway, whatever.

1685
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:21,080
I really appreciate it, seeing as how my PSP is the closest thing I can get to a laptop

1686
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:22,080
at the moment.

1687
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:26,480
Anyway, even after only a few podcasts, I can honestly say this is the best video game

1688
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:30,600
internet radio show ever and I'm looking forward to more podcasts to come.

1689
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:31,600
Keep on gaming, guys.

1690
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,160
And then he said I was hot.

1691
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,160
Aww.

1692
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,160
I'm not.

1693
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:38,880
If there's something that happens to women when they get married, they lose their heart.

1694
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:39,880
Oh, stop it.

1695
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:40,880
Yeah.

1696
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:41,880
Anyway.

1697
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,320
You should see, I know DarkSakura's very shy, but you should see her outfit today.

1698
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,320
She's very nice.

1699
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:47,640
I'm wearing my pirate shirt that I got at Walmart.

1700
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:48,640
I think it's cute.

1701
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:49,640
With the skirt.

1702
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:50,640
I like the skirt.

1703
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,360
They sell the same shirt at Disneyland and it's a bright red and they charge 30 bucks

1704
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:58,120
for it at Disneyland and I paid 12 at Walmart.

1705
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,400
But what you're wearing today is darker.

1706
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,740
It's Renaissance-y without being over the top.

1707
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:03,120
It's Renaissance-y but modern.

1708
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,120
If that makes sense.

1709
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:05,960
I feel kind of like a rockabilly.

1710
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,800
All right.

1711
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:08,800
Anyhow.

1712
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,280
Which actually ties into future news.

1713
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:13,280
Super Arizona.

1714
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,280
Ooh.

1715
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,280
Next email.

1716
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,280
Okay.

1717
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:20,280
So, this one comes from Polinosis.

1718
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:21,440
That's kind of a cool name.

1719
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,160
I was reading this fascinating article the other day and I was wondering what you guys

1720
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:26,880
think of this man's opinion and he also included a joke.

1721
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,920
It says, why is the bicycle lying on its side?

1722
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:30,920
Why?

1723
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:34,840
Because it was too tired.

1724
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:40,120
Cricket, cricket, cricket, cricket.

1725
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,520
Did I accidentally invite jokes from the listeners last week?

1726
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,520
I must have.

1727
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,520
Good effort.

1728
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:50,040
But, you know what?

1729
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,960
This article is kind of long so instead what I'm going to do is I'm going to link it in

1730
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:53,960
the chat room.

1731
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:54,960
What's the topic?

1732
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:55,960
I want to know if I read it.

1733
01:12:55,960 --> 01:13:00,000
It's about how reviews are phrased, I do believe so.

1734
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,280
And saying, consider the following sentences.

1735
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,120
This book has good book read.

1736
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,740
This record has good record listen.

1737
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:11,440
This movie has good movie watch.

1738
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,080
This game has good game play, right?

1739
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,080
Yes.

1740
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,080
Uh-huh-huh.

1741
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:16,080
Funny.

1742
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:29,280
I do sort of understand that, like you could say it plays well, you know, but yeah, I kind

1743
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:37,840
of in my attention to semantics I guess that I do sort of agree with that.

1744
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,000
But we'll read it more and maybe respond to it next week.

1745
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I'm going to take that as a homework assignment.

1746
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,600
I'm posting it in the chat room.

1747
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:44,600
All right.

1748
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,560
I'll take a look at it real quick.

1749
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:47,560
Okay.

1750
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,560
Ooh, Pirate Bay.

1751
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:53,680
Anyway, moving forward.

1752
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:59,280
We have one from Mark F. Says, hi Jamie.

1753
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,920
And my name is spelled the other way, by the way, but that's okay.

1754
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,880
You've been playing a lot of Ragnarok online.

1755
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:07,040
I haven't confirmed, but I think R02 Beta is out.

1756
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,080
Have you been playing that or the original RO?

1757
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:14,160
So since you're an MMO girl, have you played World of Warcraft or Guild Wars?

1758
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,160
Keep up the great work.

1759
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,160
You guys are very entertaining.

1760
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:19,560
I hope you bring back your extra guests from time to time.

1761
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:24,240
Well, I know that the RO2 Beta was out in Korea and I tried to sign up for it, but they

1762
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,320
needed me to sign up for like a social security number or some shit.

1763
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:28,320
So I didn't do it.

1764
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,740
However, it has been brought to my attention that the RO2 Beta is now out in the United

1765
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:38,660
States and if my laptop is up to the task, I will be downloading that like a mofo and

1766
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:43,760
playing it like crazy because I love Ragnarok, especially since it's a Beta, it'd have to

1767
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:44,760
be free.

1768
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:45,760
What?

1769
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:46,760
Sorry.

1770
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:47,760
Keep going.

1771
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:53,120
So, um, to answer your question, yes, I played World of Warcraft and I have stopped playing

1772
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:56,240
for World of Warcraft because number one, it's on my other computer and number two,

1773
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,720
honestly, I didn't think it was that fun.

1774
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:03,000
It was only fun if I was doing quests with like one other person.

1775
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:09,080
Meanwhile, I spent Alltrack Valley weekend this weekend, racking up 6,800 honor points

1776
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:10,400
so far.

1777
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,720
I played Alltrack Valley a lot yesterday.

1778
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:15,160
I have like 50 Alltrack Valley marks right now.

1779
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,040
I do have a Guild Wars account.

1780
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:21,600
It was purchased for me for my birthday, which I just got around to going through this whole

1781
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,920
thing with NC, with the people at NCSoft are great.

1782
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:31,940
They're just really on the ball and they've been able to replace my confirmation codes.

1783
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:37,200
So I will be, hopefully sometime in the next week, getting back on Guild Wars.

1784
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,140
I have a character that looks like the Doctor.

1785
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:41,360
His name is John Smith.

1786
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:47,400
I also have another character that was supposed to be in my friend's guild and she left the

1787
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:50,520
guild so I have no idea what the hell's happening.

1788
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:55,560
So I'll be on, you'll see me, I think.

1789
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:59,120
And I also was thinking about getting into City of Heroes, but honestly, when do I have

1790
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,120
the time?

1791
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:05,960
Yeah, I played Rose online too.

1792
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:10,400
One of my new friends, who I met through William, I believe is going to come on our show next

1793
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:14,560
week and he's really into City of Heroes and the reason why I'm having him on next week

1794
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:17,520
is he was in the Tabula Rasa beta, which is a game I'm pretty excited about.

1795
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,520
I want to know more about it.

1796
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:19,680
He was telling me about it.

1797
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:20,680
It sounds really awesome.

1798
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:23,800
He's going to show me the game this week to see if it's something I want to get into.

1799
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:28,200
So we'll have him on next week probably and talking about some of the PC games we sometimes

1800
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,200
overlook.

1801
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,000
So I have another email from the same person.

1802
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Well, okay.

1803
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Okay.

1804
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,120
Here are some of my comments for episode 252.

1805
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:38,560
I love the 3D Street Fighter games.

1806
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,560
It was a different playing style that made the Street Fighter characters almost real

1807
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:42,560
because of the limitations.

1808
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,000
I got tired of them jumping nine feet in the air and spinning around like tornadoes.

1809
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,200
Sorry, you're alone in that one, buddy.

1810
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:53,200
Well, at least he's not bringing up the motion capture game that was Street Fighter movie.

1811
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,200
Oh, the movie, the game, or whatever?

1812
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,200
Yeah.

1813
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,200
True.

1814
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:01,200
He has a better laptop sales and external USB D-pads controllers.

1815
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,520
Keep up the great work.

1816
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,800
Cool.

1817
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:09,280
I liked the later EX games, honestly.

1818
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:13,200
It was the first one that was kind of, well, bad.

1819
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:14,400
But hey.

1820
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:20,120
This one is from Spamoflauge, and I just think it has a cool name.

1821
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:21,120
Bourgeois Daxacara.

1822
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,680
Aw, that's French.

1823
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:28,200
So here's my statement of the week, and I'd love to get your opinion since I consider

1824
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,880
you as experts.

1825
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:33,720
I've heard that Nintendo is selling lots of Wii systems, but no games.

1826
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:34,720
Really?

1827
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:39,520
What if occasional gamers turn out to be cheap bastards who don't buy games?

1828
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,520
Three questions.

1829
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:41,520
One, is my statement true?

1830
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,760
Two, are Wii games not selling?

1831
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:45,720
Three, where do you go to get the latest game sale figures?

1832
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:50,800
I know I could just Google it, but I like hearing Dark Soccer read my emails.

1833
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,160
Merci, Spamoflauge.

1834
01:17:54,160 --> 01:18:00,040
I know that you can find a lot of the sales sites out through Consumer Reports, too.

1835
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:05,920
A lot of the new sites like Kotaku, what are the other ones?

1836
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:06,920
Like Joystick and Destructo.

1837
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:12,800
Yeah, they'll list game sales figures quarterly when they do the quarterly reports.

1838
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:16,040
And then I also, a lot of my UK news I get from Eurogamer.

1839
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:17,520
Loki, where do you get your sales figures?

1840
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:22,000
Is that coming from your way of your internal sources at your day job?

1841
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
NPD.

1842
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Oh.

1843
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,680
So, when you talk about sales numbers on the show, is that numbers you're getting from

1844
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:28,680
your work?

1845
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:32,160
No, it's from NPD Group.

1846
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:34,600
I had plenty of Wii games they're selling, trust me.

1847
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:39,680
Maybe not all of the Wii games that they want, like I know Donkey Kong, Barrel Blast didn't

1848
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:45,800
sell hotcakes, or maybe, I don't know.

1849
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,840
But I imagine a lot of those Wii games, just based on what's out there, they're selling

1850
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,160
to kids and families.

1851
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:54,440
They're not necessarily selling to a hardcore gaming audience, which is probably why, when

1852
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:57,400
you think about the Wii, you hear these things about, well, the Wii's selling, but the games

1853
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,400
aren't.

1854
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:02,800
Well, and also, a lot of people, they like Wii Sports, they're not going out and buying

1855
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:03,800
other games.

1856
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:07,520
A lot of stupid companies out there make games that are based off games and Wii Sports, like

1857
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:11,400
bowling games and shit like that, and they're like, well, why is no one going to buy my

1858
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,400
game?

1859
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,640
Well, because their game comes for free with the system.

1860
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:19,560
Also, there's a lot of games that are crappy ports of stuff, or just crappy controls and

1861
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:20,560
whatever.

1862
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,560
A lot of people get jaded by that.

1863
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:24,880
It's like, well, shit, I don't know if I want to go spend $50 just to get a game that's

1864
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,200
going to suck.

1865
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:29,200
So maybe Wii buyers are a little more cautious.

1866
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:32,760
Unfortunately, all the A-list titles on the Wii right now, too, are coming from Nintendo.

1867
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:37,360
I can't think of a third-party, like, A or triple-A title on its way soon.

1868
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:41,080
Sure, Chad will think of something, but I can't even think of anything.

1869
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:44,960
Well, Manhunt 2, there's stuff from Capcom, Resident Evil, Umbrella Chronicles, Brothers

1870
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:45,960
in Arms.

1871
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:46,960
Okay, I'll give you Umbrella Chronicles.

1872
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:50,000
Medal of Honor Heroes 2, it's going to be big.

1873
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,680
Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3, from Atari.

1874
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:54,680
I personally am not used to-

1875
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:55,680
Magno 8.

1876
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:56,680
Oh, okay, there you go.

1877
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:57,680
Well, we'll see.

1878
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:58,680
Mm.

1879
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:02,160
Oh, Knights, says Gerardimo.

1880
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,160
There you go.

1881
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,160
Thank you.

1882
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,160
Knights.

1883
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:06,160
Okay, there you go.

1884
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:07,720
Yeah, Beyonce, you may like Knights, but Knights, I don't think is going to be that

1885
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:08,720
big of a game.

1886
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,600
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1887
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,440
I am excited about Knights.

1888
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,880
I think it's going to be fantastically huge.

1889
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:19,100
I would totally believe, though, there's a lot of people just buying the Wii for Wii

1890
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:20,280
Sports, and that's it.

1891
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:24,000
There's a lot of families I bet are doing it, and totally fine with Wii Sports.

1892
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
But you know what?

1893
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,000
There are some companies that are getting smart about the games that they release, and

1894
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:33,960
a lot of them are pre-budget games, like this AMF Bowling Pin Busters from Bethesda, I think.

1895
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:37,100
I think it's Bethesda, I'm not sure.

1896
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:42,440
It's coming out for 19 bucks, and it's a full-fledged bowling game for 20 bucks.

1897
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:46,960
When I was younger, I was friends with a kid, and his family had a Nintendo, and they had

1898
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:51,280
the Power Pad pack that had the triple game at Mario, Duck Hunt, and World Class Track

1899
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,560
Meter, or whatever that game was that came with it.

1900
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:54,940
That's all they had.

1901
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:56,300
That's all they had.

1902
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:59,160
And they played that stupid world-class thing all the time.

1903
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,160
Exactly.

1904
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:02,600
I mean, people like that shit.

1905
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:06,000
Mario and Duck Hunt, I mean, what more do you need?

1906
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Seriously.

1907
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
All right, sorry.

1908
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
We can move on with emails now.

1909
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,140
I'm actually reminded now that it's coming up about time that I have to start dusting

1910
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:14,140
off the Saturn.

1911
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:16,000
Why is that?

1912
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,840
Christmas nights.

1913
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:23,560
We've been about a year and a half, about two years out of our tradition, but we used

1914
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:31,080
to, I've mentioned this before, but Dan and I bring out our Saturn every year and play

1915
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:34,920
Christmas nights, and do the countdown right to Christmas.

1916
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:35,920
Nice.

1917
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,120
I love Christmas nights.

1918
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:39,120
Anyway.

1919
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,560
I love Christmas because I get presents.

1920
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:44,560
My favorite holiday, though, is coming up in three days.

1921
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:45,560
Halloween.

1922
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:46,560
This is Halloween.

1923
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,520
It's a religious holiday for me.

1924
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:49,920
It's true.

1925
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:52,160
It's a religious holiday.

1926
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:56,040
Anyway, it's the end of the year.

1927
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,680
So moving forward.

1928
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:03,200
This one comes from Robert M. Two stupid things here.

1929
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:04,760
This email, and no, I'm kidding.

1930
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:05,760
I'm just teasing.

1931
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:10,680
First of all, I'd like to, although I have participated in the fun myself, suggest that

1932
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:14,420
we, after the whole Eye of Judgment bet is finished, drop the whole Loki as Tingle thing

1933
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:19,000
and try something fresh, such as Loki as Murray the Hippo from Sly Cooper.

1934
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,400
No idea why, just random.

1935
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,080
I don't even know who the hell that is.

1936
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,960
I know of the game, but I just don't know who that character is.

1937
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:29,360
You know, I want to agree with this statement that maybe after the bet is lost, because

1938
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:32,840
we all know it will be, that thing ain't selling a million units, that maybe we ought to drop

1939
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,440
the whole Loki as Tingle thing.

1940
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:37,640
I don't know, there's a part of me that says it's just never going to go away, like the

1941
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:39,240
whole Death Cake.

1942
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:43,800
Just because I did the voice one time, and I don't even remember how the voice was.

1943
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:49,520
Seriously, how many years ago did Loki play Karaoke Revolution live on air?

1944
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:53,840
It has scared him from doing karaoke permanently for the rest of his life.

1945
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:54,840
That's the effect this show has.

1946
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:59,120
No, it's just that we tried to duplicate the funny of it, and it's just you can't.

1947
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,560
Yeah, the second time is never as good as the first.

1948
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:05,280
Just like if Loki does actually have to dress up as Tingle for whatever reason, it will

1949
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,480
only happen once.

1950
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:10,680
Only then will we drop it, because we know now that if he does it again, it's just going

1951
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:11,920
to be some weirdo in a suit.

1952
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:17,600
I think that it's more fun to speculate, and then once, okay, what was that story written

1953
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:18,600
by...

1954
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:22,480
Oh god, no, I can't think of the guy who wrote The Great Gatsby.

1955
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:23,480
F. Scott...

1956
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:24,480
Yes, thank you.

1957
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:25,480
Fitzgerald?

1958
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:26,480
Was that his name?

1959
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:27,480
Yes.

1960
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:28,480
Okay.

1961
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:31,640
He's the girl who said she was going to cut her hair, she's going to cut her hair, and

1962
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:35,080
she's suddenly Miss Popular, and everyone loves her, and then when she does cut her

1963
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:40,040
hair, everyone's like, oh, and then she leaves.

1964
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:43,360
But seriously, he's going to set Eye of Judgment on fire.

1965
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,360
That's going to be awesome.

1966
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:46,360
That'll be fantastic.

1967
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:48,160
I just made a classic literature reference.

1968
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,560
I will fucking dance around and set an Eye of Judgment on fire.

1969
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,000
I won't wear a suit.

1970
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
That's okay.

1971
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,960
So, to continue with this email, before we get all tangenty again.

1972
01:23:58,960 --> 01:23:59,960
Sorry.

1973
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,520
Night of tangents tonight.

1974
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:06,480
Second, I ran into someone I know who owns a DS Lite but isn't happy with the current

1975
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:11,040
titles out there, and he told me, out of nowhere, that Nintendo should fire their game designers,

1976
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:12,200
all of them.

1977
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:15,480
When I asked why, he said that the company was following the bandwagon of rock band and

1978
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:21,680
guitar hero and coming out with a game in which you strum a guitar and play chords,

1979
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,720
which he considers to be just stupid.

1980
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:36,440
Now, I don't care whether you don't like music games or whether you simply think a portable

1981
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:39,880
guitar game simply wouldn't work compared to having the actual instrument hardware.

1982
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:43,520
I can only think of two games right now that he could be talking about and to suggest that

1983
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:47,840
Nintendo flat out abandoned over 20 years of first party development that is arguably

1984
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:52,440
the only reason the company still has support because a different game developer on a completely

1985
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:56,680
different continent is publishing a game that he doesn't care for on their system seems

1986
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:59,560
dangerously ignorant and selfish to me.

1987
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:00,560
Just venting, I guess.

1988
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:04,960
Yeah, you need to fire your friend.

1989
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:09,560
I think that you should point this out to your friend and go, now how do you feel?

1990
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:10,800
No, here it is.

1991
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:14,440
No, I don't think you should fire your friend, but your friend is misinformed on one huge

1992
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:15,440
thing.

1993
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,720
It sounds like your friend is assuming Nintendo makes all these decisions.

1994
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:18,720
They don't.

1995
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:22,680
When Nintendo makes the system, developers buy the kits to make games.

1996
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:27,760
It's up to them what games they want to make, so when they make all these Imagine Babies

1997
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:32,600
and whatever games are made, that's not Nintendo going, gosh, we really need someone to develop

1998
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,040
a baby sim for our system.

1999
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:37,680
No, they just kind of turn it loose out there, which in my mind is a good thing because a

2000
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:40,360
lot of great ideas come from these third party developers.

2001
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:45,880
Unfortunately, a lot of shitty ideas and cheap knockoffs come from them as well, but the

2002
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:49,120
other problem is I would not call, I'm assuming the games he's referring to there are like

2003
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:53,720
Jam Sessions and the Hannah Montana game, I would not call those knockoffs.

2004
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:54,720
They're different.

2005
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:56,440
I don't know.

2006
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:58,360
Just because they all have music in common does not make them common.

2007
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:01,280
Different is not necessarily bad.

2008
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:02,560
Yeah.

2009
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:06,040
So, your friend unfortunately is a little bit misinformed.

2010
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:07,040
Hater!

2011
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:08,040
Your friend's a hater.

2012
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:09,040
Okay, I'm done.

2013
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,040
All done with emails?

2014
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,040
No more.

2015
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,540
I said there were six.

2016
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:13,540
I can't count tonight.

2017
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:14,540
How many have we done?

2018
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:15,540
Five?

2019
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:16,540
Six.

2020
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:17,540
Oh, we've done six?

2021
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:18,540
Yes.

2022
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:19,540
And we're done.

2023
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:20,540
Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

2024
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:26,000
This segment is pushing an hour thirty, so let's wrap it up really quickly with a couple

2025
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
more stories.

2026
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Loki.

2027
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
All right.

2028
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:35,560
Anyways, as most people in the US know, there's a lot of fire going on in the LA area there

2029
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:42,360
and now of course wildfires in the San Diego area have forced Midway to evacuate their

2030
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:48,320
San Diego office, but fear not, that will not delay Stranglehold any longer.

2031
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:53,320
Actually most of the development happens in other places.

2032
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:58,280
I think it's just their corporate office.

2033
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:03,440
Don't worry, your Strangleholds and Unreal Tournament won't be delayed any further.

2034
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:08,440
Well, Unreal Tournament might, but Stranglehold at least won't be.

2035
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:14,080
That's a real shame what happened there with those fires and gosh, I hope none of our listeners,

2036
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,920
I imagine some of our listeners had to have been affected by it.

2037
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:19,200
I mean, they evacuated what, like a million people?

2038
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:23,120
And that whole process of being evacuated is no fun at all.

2039
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:24,720
I don't know how many y'all had to go through it.

2040
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:27,600
I know when we had some bad flooding where I grew up, we got evacuated once.

2041
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:28,600
This is scary.

2042
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:29,600
The whole thing's scary.

2043
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:34,200
And I hope, just in general, whether they were our listeners or not, just all those

2044
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:36,680
people that lost their homes just going on like fires.

2045
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:37,680
This is so sad.

2046
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,400
I'm really sorry to hear it.

2047
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:47,880
Anyhow, let's go back to games before we get too depressing here and talk about Netflix.

2048
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:51,400
And Netflix is kind of trying to set their eyes on the future.

2049
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:55,080
Of course, Netflix has really kind of turned themselves into the current right now.

2050
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:59,680
I mean, hell, Ma and Pa video stores and even now Hollywood video is really being impacted

2051
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:02,800
by some would say Netflix has been a huge part of this.

2052
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:09,320
Well, Netflix has made an interesting comment and it came from the CEO, Reed Hastings.

2053
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:16,600
And he said he's interested in enabling Netflix through, quote, Internet-connected game consoles.

2054
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:21,000
So very interesting that Netflix kind of wants to put their feelers out there on what they

2055
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,420
can do.

2056
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:27,680
The other thing that should be noted about this is that back in March, Hastings actually

2057
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:29,800
is now on the board of Microsoft.

2058
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:36,720
So you kind of go, hmm, could this mean that a Microsoft Netflix deal is in the cards?

2059
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:42,680
I hope so because I think the way the Xbox Live marketplace is set up now is not very

2060
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:45,160
friendly to movies and finding movies.

2061
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:48,800
However, Netflix, on the other hand, has an awesome system to find movies and has the

2062
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:49,800
whole friends thing and everything.

2063
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:53,020
I think Xbox Live is kind of clunky when it comes to their movie downloads.

2064
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:55,960
So I think a partnership could be a step up for them.

2065
01:28:55,960 --> 01:29:00,680
That's a little bit of fanboyism and dreaming there, I think, in a sense.

2066
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:04,600
That is a really big step because Microsoft kind of, they may think they don't need

2067
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:05,600
Netflix.

2068
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:10,000
You know, I talk about this every week and I probably sound like a broken record, but

2069
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:16,120
Sony is going to have to step up really quick or a few major announcements and they're

2070
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:17,120
going to be screwed.

2071
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:21,400
I mean, a lot of stuff is going to happen too quick.

2072
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:25,520
Microsoft already has a pretty strong download service for movies and stuff.

2073
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:30,040
And if you add Netflix to that as well, where you can be able to pay a subscription per

2074
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:36,760
month and download as much shit as you want, that's kind of scary.

2075
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:41,600
I know Sony is talking about doing something as far as a download service, but they're

2076
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:42,920
kind of behind.

2077
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:43,920
But we don't know.

2078
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,720
I mean, just because it's on the board of Microsoft doesn't mean that maybe Netflix

2079
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:50,760
teams up with Sony and that could be a huge boost for Sony, who seems to be finding the

2080
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:54,040
majority of their success right now as being a Blu-ray player.

2081
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:55,720
It would actually be really good for them.

2082
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:58,200
So we'll see if it happens.

2083
01:29:58,200 --> 01:29:59,200
Who knows?

2084
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:04,480
Anyhow, it's about time we bring this segment to a close because we've been here for a

2085
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:05,480
while now.

2086
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:10,360
But before we bring this segment to a close, we have to wrap up by paying a little respect

2087
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:11,360
to our elders.

2088
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:15,700
And we like to do that through Dark Sakura's classic game of the week.

2089
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:20,840
So Dark Sakura, why don't you tell us what game you picked for this week?

2090
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:24,400
And I'm actually curious, because it's Halloween week, did you pick something a little Halloween

2091
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:25,400
themed for us?

2092
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:31,120
Sort of, but actually I was more paying tribute to the release of Dracula X Chronicles.

2093
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:35,280
So I was picking one of my favorite games in the Castlevania series, which would be

2094
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:36,280
Kid Dracula.

2095
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:38,760
Oh, okay, Kid Dracula.

2096
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:45,480
It was released in Japan as Akumajo Special Boku Dracula-kun, which translates to Demon

2097
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:50,140
Castle Special, I'm Dracula-kun.

2098
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:55,240
He's playing as Alucard, pretty much, only he's Kid Dracula in the game.

2099
01:30:55,240 --> 01:31:01,520
And it's all super cute, and he has some of the powers that he had in Symphony of the

2100
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:02,520
Night.

2101
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:08,280
Actually, the major bad guy in this game ended up being an enemy in Symphony of the Night.

2102
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:12,440
So I love how they just tie in everything, I think it was really great.

2103
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:18,780
But it's a fun little kid type platformer, it came out on the Famicom in Japan, also

2104
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:25,280
on the Game Boy, and over here we got it on the Game Boy.

2105
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:29,920
I actually own this game, I'm very happy.

2106
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:38,160
It has the first level music, I don't know if you can hear it very well.

2107
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:46,760
Let me wait for it to get to the part.

2108
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:50,160
I missed this game when I was growing up, I never played this.

2109
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:53,320
We didn't get it in America, we got it on Game Boy.

2110
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:56,480
Oh yeah, I was going to say, I remember it on Game Boy, I remember it seeing it somewhere.

2111
01:31:56,480 --> 01:32:07,200
Yeah, but this is a remix of Beginning from Castlevania III, if anyone recognizes it.

2112
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:12,920
The other cool thing about this game is that, and I love how Kami does this, is that Kid

2113
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:20,040
Dracula was also a playable character in Gokujo Parodius, which I thought was pretty cool,

2114
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:25,080
and he was also a hidden selectable character in Jiki o Shiberi Parodius, which is actually

2115
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:26,240
my favorite of the Parodius series.

2116
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:32,960
Well I also love chatting Parodius too, so I'll be covering the Parodius series somewhat

2117
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:33,960
later.

2118
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:34,960
Oh look, it has like the clocks.

2119
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:39,320
Yeah, you go in the clock tower and everything, it has a lot of the classic levels that you

2120
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:45,640
expect in the old Castlevania games, but it was so cute.

2121
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:50,480
It actually was kind of hard, it got really difficult at times, just like you have the

2122
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,320
swinging pendulum and everything too.

2123
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:57,120
Very cool, a chat room is joining in on this, Escapist says, Kid Dracula made using an umbrella

2124
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:59,960
as a weapon badass long before Kirby gave it a shot.

2125
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:00,960
Yep.

2126
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,600
Son of Dad says the music sounds very upbeat for a Castlevania game.

2127
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:10,840
Well it was more of a parody style game, but it was actually pretty good for how it played,

2128
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:11,840
I loved it.

2129
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:17,680
I mean, we're talking about one of my top 20 games, I have to say.

2130
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:18,680
Wow.

2131
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:22,720
It has those little things that spin when you jump on them, lots of throwbacks to the

2132
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:23,720
cast.

2133
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:24,720
And the bridge?

2134
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:25,720
Shoot.

2135
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:33,440
This was actually a staple of my Game Boy collection for the longest time, and I really

2136
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:37,560
can't say too many good things about it, it really was very fun.

2137
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:42,480
Plus I just love his little expression the whole time, he has this like, toothy grin

2138
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:44,320
the entire time.

2139
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:52,120
I'm going to paste a copy of the logo in the chat room, just because it was adorable.

2140
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:56,400
I'm going to post the one off of Wikipedia.

2141
01:33:56,400 --> 01:34:00,160
Gerardimo says Polka makes umbrella weapons best.

2142
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:03,400
That's a Turtle Sonata reference right there.

2143
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:04,400
Why is he fighting here?

2144
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:05,400
A Klansman?

2145
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:06,400
Oh my god, it is!

2146
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:07,400
Like he has a swastika on his head!

2147
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:11,120
I swear to god, look at his boss, he's fighting here at the end of stage one.

2148
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:12,760
Look at this.

2149
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:13,760
He's got a little swastika on his head.

2150
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:17,680
I think it's supposed to be like, I don't think it's supposed to be Shaft, isn't it?

2151
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:20,640
It looks like a Klansman!

2152
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:23,720
That's crazy.

2153
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:24,720
Maybe this is a...

2154
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:26,200
Doing his part for racial equality.

2155
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:28,840
I guess so, he made the Klansman cry and run away.

2156
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:31,400
I'm hitting him too much, there you go.

2157
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,400
Interesting.

2158
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:36,640
Alright, so there you have it, Kid Dracula, your game of the week.

2159
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:37,640
Yep.

2160
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:41,440
And I'm probably one of these days going to cover Proteus, and I always say I'm going

2161
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:42,440
to.

2162
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:43,440
Don't give it away!

2163
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,280
I didn't say when, I said eventually.

2164
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:46,520
Now you're here next week, right?

2165
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:50,280
You're still here next week, but it's two weeks that you leave for Alabama?

2166
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:54,360
No, I leave, I'm actually taking a red eye on Thanksgiving.

2167
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:55,360
Gotcha.

2168
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:57,320
Okay, okay, so it's going to be a little later in the month.

2169
01:34:57,320 --> 01:35:02,360
I just wanted to warn the listeners, be careful, because when Dark Soccer is out of town, you're

2170
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:03,360
done.

2171
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:04,360
I'm going to record my game of the week.

2172
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:05,560
Oh, you're going to record it?

2173
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:07,640
I thought we got to pick, in your absence.

2174
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:08,640
Ah, I'm sneaky.

2175
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:09,640
You are sneaky.

2176
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:11,640
What would you pick?

2177
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:15,400
I would definitely go back to the Commodore 64 and dust something off from those archives.

2178
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:16,400
I don't know yet.

2179
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:17,400
I don't want to spoil it.

2180
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:18,800
I do have a game in mind, right here.

2181
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:22,680
If you're going to go in that direction, then how could I deny anybody that?

2182
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:23,680
Alright.

2183
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:24,680
Heart.

2184
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:25,680
Ugh.

2185
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:26,680
Alright.

2186
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:27,960
Loki, on the other hand, I have no idea what he'd pick.

2187
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,160
He'll pick Gals Panic or something.

2188
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:31,640
I would not pick Gals Panic.

2189
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:32,640
Or Miss World.

2190
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:33,640
Dude.

2191
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:34,640
I would not pick.

2192
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:35,640
I would not pick that.

2193
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:36,640
That's stupid.

2194
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:37,640
Everybody move your body.

2195
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:41,000
Rob made the heart and I threw out the horns.

2196
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,960
Alright, anyhow, we really need to take a break here, because we were pushing almost

2197
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:47,760
an hour forty now, so we still have half the show to go.

2198
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:48,760
Oh my god!

2199
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:52,120
Dark Tetsuya points out Chill Einige.

2200
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:53,120
Oh my god.

2201
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:54,120
Okay, please.

2202
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:55,120
We've got to take a break.

2203
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:56,120
No.

2204
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:57,120
I have to pee.

2205
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:58,120
We are never covering Chill Einige.

2206
01:35:58,120 --> 01:35:59,120
Alright.

2207
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:00,120
Okay.

2208
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:01,120
Break time.

2209
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:03,040
We'll be back right after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

2210
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:05,040
Real quick break for those of you guys on the podcast.

2211
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:06,760
We'll see you in a couple days.

2212
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:11,160

2213
