Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
We're your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Moloto.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, October 28th, 2007, a 360 fall update feature may have been leaked.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
Smash Brothers lets you share instant replays, and could MySpace be the next great gaming outlet?

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me, as always, say hello to Dark Sakura.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Yo.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
How you doing, Dark Sakura?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Been better.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
Well, sorry to hear. But, you know, we have good days and not so good days.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Yep.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Not so good day as well. I'll tell you about that in a moment.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
I have a beer now, and that makes everything better.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
I have Fiji water, and that makes things okay.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Let me, ah, except now I dropped the cap. Now everything sucks again. I hate my life.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Don't cry, emo Rob.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Say hello to tech master, Loki.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Hello.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
How you doing, Loki?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
I'm fine.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Doing better than myself and Dark Sakura?

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Probably.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
Well, here's what happened, is that I kind of stage dived last night, but not on purpose.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Those of you guys have been listening...

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
I forgot that stuff for you.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Oh, that's all right. I'll live.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
Those of you guys who have been listening to this show for a long time know that I'm involved with theatrical production of the Rocky Horror Picture Show,

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
which is, like, so different from what we do here on Orange Launch Radio, but, you know, hey, we all have a variety of different likes and stuff, right?

01:36.000 --> 01:45.000
So last night was the big Halloween show, and I was performing the criminologist role, which is what I usually do for them now when I'm not emceeing the show.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
And right at the end, I was dressed up in my Halloween garb, and my costume this year is Jack Skellington.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
I'll have to go get my mask for the operator 11 people later so they can see, because it's actually a pretty rad costume.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
But I was dressed up as Jack Skellington, but the problem was I had that mask on.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
So as I was starting to exit the stage, I was walking down the steps, which have no handrail, mind you.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
It's about six steps to get from the top to the bottom.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
And the emcee for the night was running up the steps the other way.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Well, so I started to walk down. I put my right foot on the first step.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
I put my left foot down where there was no step.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
So I tumbled and fell, and it was really bad.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Luckily, I didn't break a bone, so it could have been worse.

02:21.000 --> 02:30.000
But basically, I landed in this pretzel shape, and I basically kicked my shoe dug in to the upper part of my thigh.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
And I would show you on the webcam, except that might be indecent, because it's right next to my booty.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
So no webcam scars on that one.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
But I also skinned my knee, too.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
This does not deserve happy music. Why is happy music playing?

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
It's trying to cheer you up.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
It's saying, don't cry, Rob.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Bad news over happy music.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
It's saying, Rob, next time remember to hit the stop button when the intro's done.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
Anyway, so that's why I'm a little bit in a foul mood tonight, because I'm in pain.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Ooh, do you have drugs for me?

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I do. I'm going to give you three of them.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Awesomeness. Awesome.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Well, let's talk about...

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
You want some Vicodin, too? I have some of that.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
No, I don't want Vicodin. Vicodin won't make me very sleepy.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
All right. Anyway.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I can't have any because I have a beer.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
I might really be documenting that you're giving me...

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
I'm giving you Ibuprofen. You could just pay for Advil.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Yes, Ibuprofen is exactly the same thing.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
All right, anyhow.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Let's go to Dark Sakura with How Was Your Gaming Week?

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Nobody cares about my ass anymore, so let's talk about our gaming weeks.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Dark Sakura.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
I played horrendous amounts of Ragnarok online,

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
and I played a little guitar here of three today,

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
and my dumb butt husband...

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
I love my husband to death, but, man, I'm mad at him.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
He was supposed to bring me Super Mario Galaxy on Thursday.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
He didn't.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
I cried because the game's not out for a little while,

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
and usually when the demos from Nintendo come, they're full versions.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
I was going to say that's what I heard is that the demo

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
at GameStop and GameCrazy right now is the full version.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Yeah, and he was supposed to bring it home so that I could play it for great justice.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
It's only a couple weeks away.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
I don't care. Want.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Do want.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
I'm impatient.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
It's my right as a woman.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
I'm thinking of modding my Wii to have a mod chip on it.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
You know, for just modding stuff, not for piracy or anything.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
You should put a spoiler on it and lower it.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
It can't get much lower.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
I mean, it's like the width of three DVDs, cases at least, but I don't know.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Eh, whatever.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
All right.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
So, no Super Mario Galaxy for Dark Soccer this week.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Sorry to hear it.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Sad face.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
How about Ragnarok?

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
You still been active on the Ragnarok rack?

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Oh, yeah, and I have a new obsession in that game.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
What's that, Pray Tell?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
That's buying old blue boxes.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Because you get something random every time,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
and sometimes you get something really great,

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
and sometimes you get crap like a feather,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
and then sometimes you get something really cool

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
like I got a funeral hat that looks like a brown bag.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
I still love the SARS mask the best.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
That was always my favorite.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
They have a new SARS mask that's black.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Cool.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
So I have one on my assassin now.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Nice.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
And for anyone who doesn't know,

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
I'm playing on the Deliverance Ragnarok online server,

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
so don't find me.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I'll be making a guild for Orange Challenge later

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
if anyone wants to play with me.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Don't ask for heal, please.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Hey, I don't play support classes, okay?

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
The closest I come to support is I'm playing a dancer.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Nice.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Just so she can walk around like a hoochie with a whip.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
For fun.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
For fun.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
I've got a gunslinger, though.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
He's pretty cool.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
He's wearing a pimp hat.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
All right.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
But, yeah, that's about it.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
All right.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Well, Loki, how was your gaming week?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
My gaming week was okay.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
I didn't play as much as I thought I would be,

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
but I bought a copy of...

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Basically, I was too lazy to cancel my pre-order

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
for Ratchet & Clank Future Tools of Destruction,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
so now I have a copy of it.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
And I haven't played it yet,

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
because I took the shrink wrap off of it and I'm like,

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
ooh, case, and put it down on the coffee table

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
and on my way doing other things.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
I watched Nellie play Excite Truck because she's like,

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
hey, I want to play Excite Truck again,

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
so she's back into that again.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
It's nice to see someone showing the Wii a little love

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
once in a while.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Dude, Excite Truck is awesome,

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
and it seriously is the best Wii game, I think.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
And I don't give a shit about Zelda.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
I don't give a shit about Metroid.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Excite Truck is where it's at.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
If not the best game on the console,

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
it's definitely the best racing game, so whatever.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
Anyways, I did play some Halo 3 multiplayer last night.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
That was kind of fun.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
We went to a Halloween party,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
and so we did split screen and live multiplayer,

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
and that was fun.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
And then I played some Orange Box,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
played more Portal.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
I'm playing more Conan, and that's an okay game.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
It'll be fun to play through it,

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
but then after that, eh,

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
I won't be playing any more after that.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
And then on the PSP,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
I've been playing more of the Jackass game

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
so I can finish it and delete it.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
I mean, sell it back.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
And then what else?

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Oh, Guitar Hero 3.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
I tried a little bit of that.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
It is Guitar Hero.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Fuck, there's not really much I can say about it.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
It's not innovative or anything.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
It's just I broke my guitar

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
because a lot of people might not remember

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
our Op 11 show that we did last week.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
We showed that my guitar had the orange and blue buttons

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
out of order on there for some reason,

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
which is weird, so I tried to fix it.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
I fixed it fine.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I took it apart just fine.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Unfortunately, it's designed slightly different

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
than, say, the retail Guitar Hero 3 guitars

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
because in the retail ones,

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
you're able to take off the entire top of the guitar

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
so you can change faceplates and whatnot.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
Well, the wired version of it, or the demo kit,

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
has a screw in there

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
because they don't want you taking it off.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
So I pulled the screw out,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
and then I pulled it out,

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
and it really was stuck in there.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
So I finally got it undone,

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
switched out the buttons,

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
put it back in there,

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
and forgot to put the faceplate on there,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
so I had to pull it back out again.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Well, my second time pulling it out,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
unfortunately, I ripped the ribbon cable in half,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
so it's broken.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Nice, good job.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
And I threw it away.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
We're going to read some comments real quick

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
to our Gaming Weeks

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
and use this opportunity to introduce the chat room.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
We always tape live on Sunday night,

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
and that allows us to interact with our listeners.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Chat.orangelandtrader.com

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
is the place to be Sunday at 6 p.m. Pacific when we tape.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
Let's see, so we have JAP28 wants to know,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
why not just paint them, Loki,

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
in regards to the switch buttons?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Because it wasn't that hard to take them apart

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
to switch out the buttons.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
It's just that it's not designed to be taken apart,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
because obviously they don't want

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
the top half of the guitar being stolen

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
by some dumbass playing the game,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
so they put a ribbon cable through there

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
instead of an actual adapter to connect it to.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
So it's just because it was stuck,

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
and it wasn't coming out,

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
so I had to pull harder on it,

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
and unfortunately it just all of a sudden let loose

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
and ripped the ribbon cable in half.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
Had I remembered to put the faceplate on it

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
when I was putting it back together the first time,

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
we wouldn't have this issue.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
It would be fine.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
It's just, you know, who cares?

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
It's just, I've got another guitar already.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
I don't play multiplayer at my house,

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
and when I do, it's only going to be in rock band anyways,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
so whatever.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
And yes, I do like to tinker with stuff,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
as Blaze says in the chat room.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
Gerardimo comments in our chat room,

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
well, Loki, Excite Truck is up against

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
the other launch racing game,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
and that's really it.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
There is more than just the one launch game.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I mean, there was Need for Speed Carbon,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
there was a crappy GT racing game,

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
Monster 4x4 World Circuit.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
And were any of those games particularly memorable?

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
No, I played all of them, and they sucked.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
Especially the Monster 4x4 World Circuit and GT.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Excite Truck is awesome.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
The problem is the company that's making it

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
doesn't really make anything else.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
All they do is make racing games,

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
and before that it was some NASCAR Heat game

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
or something like that,

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
but get on it!

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Make Excite Truck 2, come on!

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
I mean, seriously, just more of the same.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
You don't need to fucking innovate it.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
It was fine the way it was.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
It just needed to be longer, have more tracks,

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
maybe some downloadable stuff once Nintendo figures out

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
this whole download service or whatever.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
That would be kind of cool.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
But until then, I'm trying to play

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
every other racing game on the platform

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
to see if there's something sort of similar to Excite Truck.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Then, of course, Mario Kart is going to be awesome,

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
but that's a different type of game.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
I mean, Nelly's not going to like that game.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Going back to Dark Soccer's Gaming Week in chat,

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Shadowslier says,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
First thing I install after I get Windows?

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Freaking Ragnarok, and it's all thanks to OLR.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
It's because it's crack.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Ragnarok.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Yep.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
All right.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
Let's see, My Gaming Week, if you're all finished, Loki?

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
I think I'm done.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
My Gaming Week, I started off the week

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
playing beautiful Katamari,

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
and I got to say, I'm a real big fan of the Katamari series.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I love the two games on PlayStation 2.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
I don't like this one on Xbox 360,

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
because honestly, I feel like they phoned it in.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
I feel like it's kind of the last PlayStation 2 game

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
with widescreen, some small enhancements.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
I mean, I feel like a lot of the things you see

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
in a lot of the levels are very similar

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
to the stuff you see in PlayStation 2.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
There's this one level with a playground

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
that seems really familiar,

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
and the racetrack doesn't seem that upgraded.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
But here's what bugs me most of all,

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
and what makes me really feel like they phoned this one in.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
The cinematics are completely disappeared,

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
which is part of what made the last game so great,

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
is you got those little cinematics in between every stage.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
It was so weird.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Also, the King of Cosmos,

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
all the charm that he had in the last two games,

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
I really feel like is lost in this game.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
I don't know if that's because of some type of up-ramping

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
in the difficulty curve,

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
but I noticed that this time in a lot of the stages,

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
the big trick is that the King wants you to grab

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
all of a certain item.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
For instance, there's one level where he wants you

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
to grab Japanese things.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
So you have to roll up as much sushi and fireworks

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
and flags as you can that are Japanese.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Or there's one level where you're supposed to roll up

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
nothing but hot things, which is kind of a cool level.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
There wasn't anything like that in the last game.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Well, not a cool level, but a hot level.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
There was something like that in the last game.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Yeah, there was the big fireball, huh?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
The campfire.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
That's right.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
So see, a lot of it kind of seems like

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
you've sort of seen it before.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
But here's the thing.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
I will collect all of that item,

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
and then the King is like,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
well, your katamari sucks.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Even though I got it the size he wanted,

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
everything's like, wow, your katamari sucks,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
and it needs more of this item.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
And you're kind of like,

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
dude, was this game bug-tested?

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
It needs more cowbell.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Do I really just suck this bad at katamari?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
You just need to say when he asks you to do stuff,

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
you're like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Roll over stuff.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
That's all I do, you know?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Except for the fire thing,

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
because you have to be real careful with that.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Otherwise, you'll keep killing him.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Yeah, I pretty much just roll.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Yeah, that's how I beat the stages now,

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
like I was trying to be careful in the beginning,

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
but I do feel like the difficulty curve

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
went up a little bit in this game.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Because if you think about it,

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
each level that's themed after something like Japanese or whatever,

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
they're going to have tons of that item everywhere.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
So all you have to do is just roll over everything,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
and the majority of it will be that item,

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
and your katamari will be big.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
So I'm sorry, katamari fans,

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
but this one's the worst game in the series so far.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Honestly, the only reason I would suggest...

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Yeah, I would play the PSP version.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Well, yeah.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
The only way I would suggest picking this game up

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
is if you don't have a PlayStation 2,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
which I can't imagine there's that many people.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
I mean, I know there's somebody.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
We're going to get an email from somebody.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
But I can't imagine there's that many people

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
that only own a 360 that don't own a PlayStation 2.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
And honestly, just go back and play the first and second games again

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
because they're superior.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
I'm sorry.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Yeah, I know there's Xbox Live modes,

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
but they're kind of shiny.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Lame.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Yeah.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
And then there's this whole downloadable content,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
which takes me on another rant for a moment.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
And this is a call to all the other bloggers

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
and podcasters and media types that might listen to this program.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
You know how the downloadable content on this game

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
has been discovered to simply be another unlock key

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
for items that are already on the disk.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
And it's not like we haven't seen this before.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
I mean, Dance Dance Revolution Universe comes to mind.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
We had that.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Can you think of any others, Loki, that you downloaded keys?

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
Need for Speed, like practically every EA game

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
with the unlockable cheats and stuff.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
We need to no longer call this downloadable content

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
because it's not.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
It's not downloadable content.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
The content is not what you're downloading.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
What are you downloading?

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
You're downloading an unlock code.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
So we need to start referring to this stuff

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
when we see it as pay to unlock content

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
because that's what it is.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
It's pay to unlock content.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
You know, in Ridge Racer, they had where you can unlock cars

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
and they call them keys, car key.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
You know, this is a download key, whatever.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
That makes sense to me to call it that.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
So from here on out on this show

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
when we discover things like this,

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
we're no longer going to refer to it as downloadable content

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
when we talk about it, review it on the show,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
it will now be referred to as pay to unlock content

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
because that's what it is.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Now, downloadable content, actual downloadable content

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
in my mind would be something like Elder Scrolls Oblivion.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
The characters in Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
And you weren't just downloading a key for that?

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Actually, I didn't play the game enough.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
I think that you were actually downloading the full characters.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
See, that's the hard thing.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
They had to release a new version that already had them in it.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
That's true, that's true.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
That's going to be the hard thing about this

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
is that game companies are not up front

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
with this information usually.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
So that's why, you know, we're just...

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Well, they prefer it to be seamless to the customer.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
We're just this tiny little show in somebody's, you know,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
spare bedroom, independently run.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
But I'm putting a call out there to all the bigger folks

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
who might happen to listen to this program.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
I think we need to start asking developers

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
when they announce this content.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
Is this downloadable content or is this pay to unlock content?

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
I'm not saying pay to unlock content is necessarily a bad thing,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
but let's call it what it is.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
Let's not, you know, if you're going to do it this way,

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
I think the consumers have a right to know what it is that they're buying.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
And you know what?

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
I still bought the pay to unlock content in the realm of DDR.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
I bought, you know, the song pack.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
It's not going to stop me from buying it.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
I'm not saying we have to boycott all pay to unlock content,

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
but I think we should be fair and call it what it is, pay to unlock content.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
So there you have it.

16:29.000 --> 16:35.000
And that even gets to the whole thing of why the fuck is it locked in anyways,

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
and why do I have to pay to unlock part of the game that I've already bought.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
That's stupid.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Let's see.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
NM64 says one advantage to pay to unlock content

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
is that it doesn't fill your HDD, your hard drive.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
Okay, fair, fair, but still it is pay to unlock content.

16:52.000 --> 16:57.000
And you know, it's something that you've bought that now you're having to unlock.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
You know, it's just, you know, it's a little bit janky.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
I can understand like if you're saying, you know, in those EA games

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
or whatever where you want to cheat and like say, okay,

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
I want to unlock the cheat codes or something like that,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
and I don't want to play through the game, I'm just going to buy them.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
Okay, well that's fine if you want to do that because that's your choice.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
But it's stuff that's in the game which I think caught on my eye

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
was too short anyways, and the fact that there was more levels in there,

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
that's kind of annoying.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
I think that's why this one particularly stings

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
and why we need to put our foot down with this one

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
because I think a lot of people feel even for considering

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
it was a $40 game and not a $60 game, it was still a little too short.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
And to have those unlock codes come out not even a week after the game is out

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
is a little bit of a punch to the gut, right?

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
Yeah, it's just like all the DDR unlocked songs, that's stupid too.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
But I understand why they do that because of the licensing stuff,

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
yet at the same time I also think that they could probably, you know,

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
bundle in the licensing cost into the game

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
because I don't think that five extra songs are really going to cost

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
five extra dollars or something like that.

18:04.000 --> 18:09.000
OL Army Blaze asks, is the $5 horse armor downloadable or unlock content?

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
It's downloadable, I mean granted it's shitty downloadable content,

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
but it is downloadable content.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
I'm not saying that downloadable content,

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
there's a perfect example of where download content

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
may not actually be better than pay to unlock content.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
But I'm just saying, let the consumer know what it really is

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
they're spending their money on.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Here's the other thing that people also forget,

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
and it's pretty easy to forget it, but if you go to retail kiosks,

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
a lot of this downloadable content that costs you money,

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
like themes and stuff, is actually available for free

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
if you bring your memory unit and you can download it straight off there.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
I remember when Saints Row came out,

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
they had some downloadable clothes or something that you could get for it,

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
and it was all free on there.

18:46.000 --> 18:51.000
It costs you money on live, but it was free from the retail kiosks.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
So that's another option too, get one of those memory units

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
and check it every now and then.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
That's what they're trying to do, but they don't advertise that shit,

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
which is annoying.

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
So from here on out, we'll start on this show calling it what it is,

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
and I beg of the O.L. Army and the listeners of this program,

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
spread the word.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Let's get it out there, let's put our foot down as gamers,

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
and demand the developers call their releases what they are.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
And that whole microtransactions thing, we'll save that for another day,

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
because then you're getting into a whole other ballgame.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
Anyhow, that's really pretty much it for my Gaming Week.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Well, I did play some of the Xbox Live.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
I guess I should say real quickly,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I did play some of the Xbox Live arcade games.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
I played Battlestar Galactica.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
Man, I love Battlestar Galactica, the show,

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
but the game...

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Yeah, it was over in about ten minutes.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I just couldn't get into it.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
It was not good.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
Exit, a little bit disappointing to me.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
It was much slower paced than I thought it would be.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
It was kind of a slow paced game, but I don't know.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
To be honest, don't take that as my final word on the game yet,

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
because I didn't play it enough, so more to come on that later.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
And I've still been playing every extend extra extreme,

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
kind of exploring all the modes and that.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
And then lastly, I would say I just got Guitar Hero 3 today,

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
and cracked that open.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Haven't gotten to play it enough to give my full review,

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
but I will say this, I do love the way that the game

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
ties into the internet with the GuitarHero.com site,

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
and how you can link your Xbox 360, or from what I understand,

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
PlayStation 2 or 3, whatever versions to the website,

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
and you can have an online band and all this stuff,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
and these online on the web leaderboards.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
I really like that kind of functionality.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
Is that that whole web 2.0 thing to an extent

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
that Sony was talking about before?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
I like that kind of stuff.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
Halo 3 does this extremely well, and it's part of the charm,

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
like with the pictures and everything.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
So it's kind of cool seeing games and other genres

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
getting into this.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Now granted, the link code wouldn't work for me earlier today,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
because I think everyone's hitting it.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
But rest assured, sometime this week,

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
there will be an OL Army band that you all can join.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
So keep an eye on our forums for that.

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
Rob, what did you think of the changes in interface during gameplay?

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
You know, it's not bad.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
I was a little hesitant to hearing that harmonics

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
was not going to be behind it and it was going to be never soft,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
but considering they built the whole thing from the ground up,

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
it's not bad.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
I'm hearing things about some frame rate issues that people are having.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
I haven't noticed it yet, but then again, keep in mind,

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
I've only really played like five songs so far.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
I really like how it looks a lot better now.

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
The cool thing about them having built the thing from scratch

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
is that they didn't just up res something they had before,

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
as in the case of Guitar Hero 3.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
It's really clean.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
It's from the ground up.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
And I love the cartoon stuff in between levels.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Yeah, that was great.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
That's rad.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Dan was saying today, he's like, I love the bassist.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
Yeah, honestly, this is kind of like the step up

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
that I think Guitar Hero 2 should have been in a way.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Not that I'm saying Guitar Hero 2 is bad,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
but it's just kind of like there wasn't much there.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
It was kind of a rehash of the first game of New Haunt Songs.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
I think this is generally a step in the right direction,

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
but again, I need to spend a little more time with the game.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
I haven't played it online at all, but I'm liking what I see so far.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
So if chat room, you guys have some comments,

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
chat.orangelaunchradio.com and we'll be reading those.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
I'm just trying to see what's going on.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
A lot of folks were still commenting on the unlock,

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
pay to unlock stuff.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
Kevin DDR says, pay to unlock is only fine, in my opinion,

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
when you have low or no price for the game.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Kind of like Xbox Live Arcade maybe,

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
but usually they don't really do much pay to unlock with Xbox Live Arcade.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Or free to unlock.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
And the only thing you're paying is for the price of Xbox Live gold or silver.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Well, silver is free.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
But I'm talking about the Dead Rising costumes were free, right?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
But you had to be connected to live to download them.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
I don't think many people have a problem with that

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
and that just kind of is an enhancement for those folks

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
that happen to be on the internet.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Rob.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Yes.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
You know what's bullshit about Guitar Hero 3?

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
What?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
They took out Pandora.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Did they? I didn't even notice.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
They put in that stupid Midori.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
I like Midori.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
I hate her.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
She's so stupid.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
I unlocked her green hair.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
I so miss Pandora because she was like the total goth rocker.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Pandora was pretty cool.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Maybe she's unlocked later.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
No, she's not an unlockable.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
She's completely not in it.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
All right.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
But we do have Slash now.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
All right.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
Let's get to some housekeeping tonight

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
and then we'll get into the gaming news.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Not a lot to say for housekeeping tonight.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I do want to encourage if you didn't check it out,

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
I mean now the game's kind of out there so it might not be as exciting.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
But on Operator 11 we did do a Guitar Hero 3 retail unboxing

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
after the show last week

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
and we hope to bring you more stuff like that later.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
The chat room was asking if maybe we'd play some Guitar Hero 3

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
after the show tonight.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
I don't know because I'm kind of,

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
because of my injury and everything

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
and I don't know if we'll get to that tonight.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
Just imagine Guitar Hero 2 with different songs.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
I'm hoping that as the weeks go by,

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
we can do more of that,

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
especially if we're able to get our hands on things early and stuff.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
We might be able to do some of that.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
So we'll see as long as we're not violating NDAs

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
or any of that fun stuff.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
But sometimes they'll send demos

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
and they don't care if people take screenshots or whatever.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
So why not stream it live on the web?

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
We'll see what happens.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
More to come on that.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
In the meantime,

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
check out our Myspace at Orange Lounge Radio on Myspace,

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
our live journal community at Orange Lounge,

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
and soon, our band on Guitar Hero,

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
which I'm hoping to create as soon as it will link up.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
So keep an eye on the forums for more information.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Let's get to the news.

24:14.000 --> 24:19.000
Anyways, so the first thing also kind of ties in with Guitar Hero 3 here.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
They've been doing some tests.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
IGN actually did a little kind of testing of the Guitar Hero 3 guitars

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
and the Rock Band guitars

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
and the Guitar Hero 2 guitars, the Explorer,

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
to see whether they played nice with each other's games.

24:33.000 --> 24:39.000
And it looks like that the Guitar Hero 3 guitar doesn't quite work with Rock Band

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
and the same goes with the Rock Band guitar on Guitar Hero 3.

24:44.000 --> 24:50.000
But the Guitar Hero 2 Explorer model, at least on the 360,

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
does work with both,

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
so that's where you need to go.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Buy that one instead.

24:54.000 --> 25:01.000
Now, of course, some speculation is, you know, why is it not working?

25:01.000 --> 25:06.000
Well, it might be that Activision, in fact it does say on the box,

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
only official guitars will work with Guitar Hero 3.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
And they've been known to do this in the past,

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
but they locked out guitars with Guitar Hero 2 on the PlayStation 2.

25:15.000 --> 25:20.000
And I remember some of the stuff from the third-party guitars from Guitar Hero 1

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
weren't working with it.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
And I'm not surprised that they're doing something like this

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
because they want to sell their guitars

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
and not allow third-party companies to make guitars.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
But Rock Band, though, Harmonics has actually come out and said

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
they welcome any third-party software

25:34.000 --> 25:39.000
or they support any third-party guitars or accessories.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
You can't help but feel like, though,

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
that there's a little bit of, like, jabs going on here with this.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Oh, yeah.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
I mean, I don't know if it's just an unfortunate coincidence for these guys,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
but it does feel a little bit like you wonder if they're taking jabs at each other,

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
which is shit for the consumer.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
I mean, you know, but I guess according to that quote or whatever I had heard,

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
they were saying, you know,

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
well, we base it off the standard Xbox Live, you know, blah, blah, blah,

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
and if people make their controllers to the Xbox Live specifications,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
then everything ought to work.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
But for whatever reason, it doesn't seem to be working in this case,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
which sucks for us in the end.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Not for me, though.

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
I resisted buying the bundle because I already had the Guitar Hero 2 controller, so.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
Well, there's a lot of, like, third-party adapters that they have out there

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
that require, like, for example, the ones that hook up a keyboard and mouse

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
via the USB, you have to have a wired controller plugged in

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
because it reads that identifier off of the wired controller

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
and thinks it's just a wired controller plugged in.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
Otherwise, it wouldn't work either because that platform is not open.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
It's just, you know, the third-party companies have to license that stuff,

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
so when the, you know, homebrew guys decide to make an adapter for it,

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
they have to kind of trick it,

26:47.000 --> 26:53.000
and maybe, maybe someone will come up with an adapter for, say,

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
the Rock Band guitar, the Hook Up 2, the 360,

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
that also has, like, a wired controller plugged in

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
that will allow you to do this, kind of bootleg it.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
Or, in my opinion, the bigger company will hot-fix their game

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
to just make it work.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
They'll find the specifications of the other guitar and just make it work.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
I don't know.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
We'll see, though.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
Meanwhile, if you are heading out to buy Guitar Hero 3,

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
a word of warning from some folks who have been picking up their game at Walmart.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
Apparently, you know how the big thing about Xbox 360 is that,

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
woo, there's this new wireless controller for Guitar Hero 3.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
Well, apparently, check the box at Walmart,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
because that may not be the case,

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
and this is something that was posted to the Score Hero forums.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
This user named Torchy has started a thread.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
Warning to those buying Guitar Hero 3 at Walmart.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
Check your bundles, packaging carefully before you purchase

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
to ensure the correct guitar isn't closed.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
And they have included screenshots,

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
and yes, there are some bundles of Guitar Hero 3

27:45.000 --> 27:50.000
that come with the classic red SG Guitar controller,

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
and there are screenshots all over this thread to prove that it's true.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
Now, who knows where this is coming from,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
because I would think, well, this box, I mean,

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
I don't think Walmart could have cooked these boxes up themselves,

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
so it seems to me like it's some type of agreement with the company, in a way,

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
for Walmart to stay the low-priced leader or whatever.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
They have to take some things out.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
They can sell it probably cheaper

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
and get rid of some of those older guitars.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
So...

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
That's completely false advertising, though.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Not really.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Well, it says it right on the box.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
I don't think it's false advertising.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Yeah, I wouldn't say it's false advertising,

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
except it's kind of misleading for those of us

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
that have been following this game on the internet,

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
because we never knew that Walmart was going to do, ha ha ha, switcheroo.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
And unfortunately, some of these people who ran to the store at midnight,

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
picked up the first copy of Guitar Hero 3 on the shelves,

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
like, oh, I've got to get that, you know,

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
and they maybe didn't think to read the box first,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
because they were just so excited, right?

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
You know, who can fault them?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Hey, but hey, here's one thing, though.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
You can always take it back to Walmart,

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
because they'll take returns on almost anything.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
That is a very good point.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
Walmart also has a very liberal return policy,

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
and quite frankly, you ought to tell them,

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
this was not the game I was expecting to buy.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
This is not the controller that you're looking for.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Exactly.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
So, there you have it.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
So, be careful.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
A word of warning to those who are going to be buying their game at Walmart,

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
although maybe you ought to just go to, like, Target, Best Buy, GameStop,

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
one of the thousands of other places,

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
or Guitar Center, for God's sake, sells this game.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
Well, how about a good game?

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Let's go to Rock Band.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
Ah, Rock Band.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
Wait, I thought you liked Guitar Hero 3.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
I do, but I'm going for better.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Oh, snap.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
All right.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
I have high expectations of Rock Band.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
I hope you're not disappointed.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
So, there is a price point of $169.99 on it,

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
with 58 songs being 45 licensed tracks,

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
and 13 more unlockable,

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
and we have a complete list of songs,

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
if anybody wants to know.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
I would like to know.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
I would like to know the highlights.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Read the songs that jump out at you as awesome inclusions.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
Well, Rolling Stones Give Me Shelter,

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
and The Who Won't Get Fooled Again,

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
Boston Foreplay, Long Time,

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
David Bowie, Suffragette City.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Oh, this game has David Bowie in it, and I'm happy it wins.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
There's a cover of Paranoid by Black Sabbath,

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Don't Fear the Reaper,

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
Blitzkrieg Pop by The Ramones,

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
Detroit Rock City by Kiss, though, that makes me happy.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
We've also got Rush's Tom Sawyer,

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
which is one of my favorite songs.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Faith No More Epic,

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
Pixies Wave of Mutilation.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
This is my favorite REM song, Orange Crush.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
And we've also got Learn to Fly by Foo Fighters,

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Inner Sandman Metallica.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
We've got Weezer Say It Ain't So,

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Radiohead Creep, and I love Radiohead.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
BC Boy Sabotage, Black Hole Sun, I Think I'm Paranoid,

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
Celebrity Skin.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
And then for the more current stuff, we have

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
OK Go, Here It Goes Again,

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Nine Inch Nails, The Hand That Feeds,

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Danny California,

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
The Killers, When You Were Young.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
And then one of the unlockable tracks is

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Bing Camaro, with Pleasure.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Random ass thought here.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
I mean, it's kind of interesting because two of those bands

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
that are in the game, Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails,

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
have been in the news a lot lately about

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
kind of their defiance of traditional record releasing.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
You know, obviously Radiohead put out their album

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
in rainbows on the internet for people to pay

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
whatever they want for it, and Nine Inch Nails

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
basically declared their independence from a record label recently.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
It kind of gets me thinking,

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
is this type of Guitar Hero rock band thing

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
a possible delivery method promotional tool

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
of new songs by these artists in the future?

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Yep, they've already said they want to do that.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Wow, that's pretty rad.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
They're going to be releasing whole albums

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
and they're going to be tying in stuff with MTV,

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
and that is definitely something that's going to happen with rock band.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
You watch.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Very interesting little tie in there.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
I'm pretty happy with the list though.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
I do want to say this though.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Oh, I thought you had your hand raised.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
You had something you wanted to say.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
No.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Sorry, bad radio.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
I will say this though.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
Unfortunately, rock band did not have heart.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
I know, that makes me sad.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
That does make me a little sad

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
because Guitar Hero 3 did have Barracuda,

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
which is all kinds of awesome.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Because pre-'80s heart was the best.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
That's right.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
And they were still that folk rock.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Well, I don't know.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
I mean, some post-'80s, you know.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Oh no, in the 80s they had Gem Hair.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
They did have Alone too, which was like the best song.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
They had Gem Hair.

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
Anyway, thank you for the report on rock band, Dark Soccer.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
I think it's awesome.

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
I wish they would have like, I don't know, Prodigy or something in there.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
That'd be pretty awesome.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Nine Inch Nails in there.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
That's really sweet.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
That's what I'm saying.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
If like rock band does well,

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
I really hope they put out something,

32:30.000 --> 32:38.000
like something to appease those of us that didn't get more Beatmania in the US.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
And I know that's kind of a bit, you know,

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
a lot of the purists for Beatmania are probably going to go,

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
what?

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
But seriously, like I would like to see some type of like trance dance

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
using the Beatmania concept but improving on it.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
I think it'd be a lot of fun.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
But using songs that we know a little more over here maybe.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
Not to say the songs in Beatmania were bad because they really weren't.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
Although I do feel the series has gotten a little stale

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
now that we're on what, 13th, 14th game.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
I would like to see stuff like Prodigy and all these other.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
If they did something like that,

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
I mean there's still even a lot of trance music and stuff out there

33:08.000 --> 33:13.000
that's not mainstream unless you go to like a lot of clubs and raves and stuff

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
or you're in the scene.

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
You wouldn't really recognize a lot of it and it's still good music.

33:18.000 --> 33:22.000
But anyways, put out a game with Above and Beyond in it.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
I swear to God I'm so there.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
I'll pay 60 bucks, 80 bucks for Control or hands down I'm there.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
So some other interesting things.

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
And this is kind of something we've talked about before with patents and stuff.

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
And why the hell isn't Konami suing these people for using...

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
Obviously since Guitar Freak's Drummania came out way long before

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
Rock Band or Guitar Hero even around.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
So what's up?

33:45.000 --> 33:50.000
Well apparently actually Harmonics and they've been licensing

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
the rights to use this stuff.

33:52.000 --> 33:58.000
Including the patents for the guitars are being licensed from Konami.

33:58.000 --> 34:03.000
However for the drums stuff they're not licensing it since that's actually being...

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
They're using patents from Drumscape.

34:05.000 --> 34:10.000
If you remember that MTV arcade drum game that came out a long time ago.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
Vaguely.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
I think I like saw it once and thought it looked kind of dumb.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
I never played it.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
So that was pretty interesting.

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
And also of course Activision is also licensing the rights for guitars as well.

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
So, you know, Konami doesn't need to necessarily bring out the game here

34:24.000 --> 34:28.000
because they're making money outside from the sales of these.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Gotta go to chat.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
chat.orangelaunchradio.com

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Legend of Zaku says, fuck you Sky.

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
Konami needs to do it, not Harmonics Red Octane in regards to Beatmania.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
If they want to do it, great.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
But I'm not going to sit around and wait.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
You know what I mean?

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
Like, I would totally support Konami doing this.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
I wish they would.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
I think they could do an awesome job with it.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
But they're not.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
You know what I mean?

34:52.000 --> 34:58.000
Yeah, they're testing 2DX Gold in America, but that's not going to do it.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
For those of us that have been hardcore into Balmaini for a long time,

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
yeah, that's awesome news.

35:02.000 --> 35:07.000
But where did Guitar Hero succeed where Guitar Freaks did not?

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
Guitar Hero brought songs everybody knew and everybody wanted to play

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
and people wanted to rock out in their living room to well-known songs.

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
Unless Konami is willing to invest a little money in a powerhouse song list,

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
not going to happen, I'm sorry.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
To me, that's fact.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
And that's based on the success of Guitar Hero.

35:27.000 --> 35:31.000
But if Konami wants to step up their game on Beatmania, I totally support it

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
and I think they could kick some major ass and beat these other guys to the punch

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
and show us why Konami was first.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
I don't think they should bring it over.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
I don't think they will.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
I don't think they should because to be honest,

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
Konami, especially in their Balmaini line,

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
has not been innovative in the last ten years.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
Seriously, what have we seen come out of there?

35:50.000 --> 35:57.000
I mean, Extreme and Supernova and the Universe series

35:57.000 --> 36:01.000
and hell, Hottest Party, that shit is not innovative at all.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
It's just fucking copying and pasting shit from other games.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
I agree and I don't because I actually thought some of the single-player modes

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
in Ultramix, I love Ultramix too.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
I'm not talking about Ultramix.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
Ultramix is fine, but they innovated a little bit when they brought it to the Xbox.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
But I'm talking about Universe.

36:20.000 --> 36:24.000
Universe, they didn't do shit with it and it's very evident.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
I mean, how many download packs were there for?

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Oh yeah, one.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Paid unlock packs.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Paid unlock packs, my mistake.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
One.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
One is the only thing that they had for it.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
I mean, later on they could have had different unlock packs and stuff, but no.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
But they're going to just release another retail version of the game six months later

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
because you know what?

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
You can make money off of it.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
A lot more than you would those download packs.

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
So, I mean, this is what they did with Karaoke Revolution.

36:48.000 --> 36:53.000
I hear you and I don't because I feel like Guitar Hero 2 kind of did the same thing with the first Guitar Hero.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
You know what I mean?

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
They did.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
They did.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
I mean, and they did it with the Rock the 80s thing.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
I mean, they were just trying to make more money on the side.

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
And yeah, they haven't innovated either, but that's the thing.

37:04.000 --> 37:09.000
And that's why Guitar Hero 3 is very encouraging to me so far because I see like this online thing.

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
And I see like, okay, this really feels like a step up.

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
Maybe Konami needs to take a page out of what's going on here, hand it off to some other developers.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
But see, that's the thing though.

37:18.000 --> 37:25.000
It's like I can get excited about their arcade releases because that's some cool stuff that they're doing there.

37:25.000 --> 37:30.000
But when their home releases come out, you know, nowadays I don't give a shit.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
It's like, ooh, another DDR game.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
That's really cool.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
I mean, but who cares?

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
It's not like something I'm running out to the store and going to buy.

37:39.000 --> 37:44.000
I used to because it was really exciting to see all these new songs and stuff.

37:44.000 --> 37:49.000
But now it's just so watered down, they just don't care anymore it seems like.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
It's like whatever, you know, it's DDR.

37:51.000 --> 37:55.000
People will buy it because you'll exercise to it and stuff.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
And that's the crowd that they're going after.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
They don't care about the people that like the game.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Tonight's show is very interesting.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
This is the throwback to our old days, for those that may not know.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Check us out the first time.

38:05.000 --> 38:10.000
The first three years of our show or so, we were all about strictly music-based games

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
and talking about the DDR community and tournaments and then other things going on.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
So very interesting tonight that we have all this music gaming news.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
It's been a real throwback to our heyday.

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
So if we sound really passionate about these issues, it's because we are.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
Loki, myself, DarkSakura, you know how we met?

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
Golfland, DDR.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Road trips to Miggle in the Bay.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
We should do that again.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
To play B-Mania 2DX.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
This is how we should.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
Like a throwback road tour.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
I want to make it a regular thing again.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
It would be fun.

38:41.000 --> 38:45.000
Anyhow, hey guess what, the music news does not stop there

38:45.000 --> 38:50.000
because now we have DDR Universe 2 is coming out a little later this year,

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
before the end of the year.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
And the song list for that was just recently released.

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
I'm going to give DDR Universe 2 a shot because I actually did enjoy Universe 1,

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
although there were some major, major flaws in it.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
But I like the song list, which usually is the...

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
That's the core part of any DDR game.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
If it has a shitty song list, you're not going to want to play it.

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
So make what you will of this song list for DDR Universe 2.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
I'm not going to read the whole thing, but let me tell you some of the licenses.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Take Me Out by Franz Ferdinand.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
The Way You Move by OutKast.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Walk Like an Egyptian by The Bangles.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Rocket by Herbie Hancock.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Safety Dance with Men Without Hats.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
He's the Greatest Dancer by Sister Sledge.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
We've got a lot of throwback songs in this one.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
And let's see, Fire by Ferry Corston.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
I'm trying to see what else is here on that list.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
We also have some pretty cool Konami remixes

39:40.000 --> 39:45.000
because we have a new Contra medley mix by Niko Jira.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
It's going to be in there.

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
So pretty cool.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
Oh, Jelly Kiss is going to be downloadable, it looks like.

39:52.000 --> 39:56.000
They have also announced some of the songs that are going to be in the first download pack.

39:56.000 --> 40:00.000
And I hope this isn't Pay to Unlock, we don't know yet.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
Oh, I bet you it is.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
I bet you it is too, because that's why we already have the songs for it.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
But we'll see.

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
So we don't know what to call it yet, but there will be some additional content for the game

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
that include a lot of songs that were in the UltraMix series.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Oh, look at that!

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Dynamite Rave is a download pack.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Or a download...

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
We don't know.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
Pay to Unlock song.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
Dynamite Rave.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
Who cares?

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
Seriously.

40:27.000 --> 40:32.000
SSJ100Matt says Konami will never get the great licenses that Rock Band and Guitar Hero have.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Well, they should.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
It's not like they're broke, right?

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
They could if they wanted to, in my opinion.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
I don't think they really need to.

40:41.000 --> 40:46.000
And I think Guitar Hero should be a lesson in what happens when you don't do it.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
I don't know.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
Whatever.

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
Anyway, lots of hate throwback to the old days music gaming,

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
but there's other console-type news we want to get to, such as release dates.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
Yes, Jamie?

40:56.000 --> 41:03.000
Well, for our friends in the UK, on the 31st is Mutant Storm Empire on Xbox 360,

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
and Tony Hawk's Proving Ground on the 31st.

41:07.000 --> 41:13.000
And then coming up on November 1st, we have Need for Speed Pro Street for the mobile phone.

41:13.000 --> 41:19.000
We have on the 2nd, Avatar the Burning Earth on Xbox 360, Blade Storm the Hundred Years' War,

41:19.000 --> 41:28.000
FIFA Manager 08, Hellgate London, Naruto Rise of the Ninja and Naruto Ultimate Ninja Heroes,

41:28.000 --> 41:33.000
NASCAR 2008, Chase for the Cup, NBA 2K8, Sonic Rivals 2,

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
Syphon Filter Dark Mirror, Tabula Rasa on PC,

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
The Simpsons Game, Tony Hawk's Proving Ground,

41:40.000 --> 41:48.000
Warriors of the Lost Empire, Sam & Max Episode 201, Ice Station Santa.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
Oh wait, I'm getting ahead of myself because that's on the 8th.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
So that's it.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
Santa.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
Santa.

41:54.000 --> 41:59.000
Anyways, in the US, there's quite a bit of stuff coming out,

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
including the ever-controversial Manhunt 2,

42:03.000 --> 42:07.000
finally making its way out on PlayStation 2, PSP, and the Wii.

42:07.000 --> 42:11.000
I'm sure we'll see a lot of that in the news probably in the next few weeks.

42:11.000 --> 42:16.000
Of course, today Guitar Hero 3 came out, so go pick that up.

42:16.000 --> 42:21.000
Other platforms, Disgaea Afternoon of Darkness on PSP.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
Let's see, we've also got Ben 10.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
That's coming out on quite a few platforms.

42:26.000 --> 42:33.000
PlayStation 2, PSP, Wii, and I believe the DS.

42:33.000 --> 42:38.000
Also, there's Cars Mater National, which is a sequel to the Cars game that came out last year,

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
which sucked, by the way.

42:39.000 --> 42:46.000
That was another one of those launch racing games that God knows blew for the Wii.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Anyways, let's see here.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Also on the Wii, Battalion Wars 2.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
That one actually looks pretty good.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
That's coming out this week.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
And let's see, The Simpsons Game.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
It's going to be out on almost everything.

42:58.000 --> 43:04.000
PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, 360, the Wii, and DS.

43:04.000 --> 43:09.000
Also on the PlayStation 3 this week, the Ever Delayed Stranglehold.

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
That's going to be coming out as well as the collector's edition.

43:13.000 --> 43:19.000
And let's see, on PC we have Hellgate London.

43:19.000 --> 43:24.000
That's going to be coming out as well as The Witcher.

43:24.000 --> 43:30.000
And let's see, on DS, Barbie Island Princess.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
Yay!

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
That's also coming out on the Wii, I believe, and PS2.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
What exactly does Barbie do in Island Princess?

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
It's based off some DVD that came out.

43:39.000 --> 43:47.000
Does she vote off her friends off the island one at a time in Who is the Prettiest Supremacy?

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
I don't know.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
What else is coming out?

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
Assault Heroes.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
That's also coming out on PC.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
That was an Xbox Live Arcade title as well.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
As seen with that Battlestar Galactica game.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
That's also coming out.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
The Command & Conquer Saga, also on PC.

44:04.000 --> 44:09.000
That was the one that came with practically every single Command & Conquer game ever released.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
That's pretty awesome.

44:10.000 --> 44:17.000
And let's see here, I think that's it as far as PC goes.

44:17.000 --> 44:26.000
And then this week, also Naruto, Rise of a Ninja on 360, Viva Pinata Party Animals on the Xbox 360.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
Woohoo!

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
And then Virtua Fighter 5.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
That's also coming out.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
Oh, and Time Shipt on Xbox 360 as well.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
Chat comments, GS68 says it's a fucking Barbie game.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
Skip!

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Frisbee says the tribe has spoken.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Ken, pack your bags.

44:41.000 --> 44:47.000
Oh, and Ratatouille Food Frenzy on DS, which is a ripoff of Cooking Mama.

44:47.000 --> 44:52.000
That may not necessarily be a bad thing, because now you're mixing Cooking Mama with Disney Pixar franchises.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
That could be okay.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Pixar can do no wrong.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
What?

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Pixar can do no wrong.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
I don't know.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
I don't know.

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
In the video game realm, they've licensed their stuff out questionably before.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
But Pixar didn't do it.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
They just licensed it.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
That's true.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
Pixar themselves can do no wrong.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
It's THQ they released it, so.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Well, THQ can do some wrong.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
Yeah.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
Hopefully they won't.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
We'll have faith.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Going to Japanese release dates.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
We're ready for those.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
Japanese release dates.

45:19.000 --> 45:24.000
Xbox 360 seeing a lot of games getting a price cut this week, and we'll find out why a little bit later.

45:24.000 --> 45:32.000
But Dead or Alive 4, Dead Rising, Gears of War, The Idolmaster, Project Silpheed, a lot, a lot of games getting price cuts.

45:32.000 --> 45:39.000
As far as new games go, you can check out Ace Combat 6, The Fires of Liberation, and Viva Pinata Party Animals coming out on the Xbox 360 in Japan.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
This week.

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
Going to some other platforms on the Nintendo Wii.

45:43.000 --> 45:49.000
Opuna is coming out in Japan on the 1st of November, as well as Super Mario Galaxy.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
Opuna looked weird.

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
Wasn't that that one where you control the entire game with like the nunchuck?

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
I believe that is the game, yes.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
I'll pull up more information.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
I'll come back to that in a moment.

45:58.000 --> 46:05.000
And read some other release dates, such as the PlayStation 3 is getting GI Jockey 4 2007.

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
We know that here is winning post 7.

46:08.000 --> 46:14.000
And Railfan, Taiwan High Speed Rail.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
Go Trainsims.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
I guess, yeah, there you go.

46:16.000 --> 46:27.000
High Speed Trainsim goes to Turbo Speed on the PlayStation 2 MotoGP07, another port of GI Jockey 4, and Super Robot Tyson Scramble Commander II.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Just what we need, more Robot Tyson.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
That's right.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
Oh my God.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
They're in the anime series now too.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
That's kind of cool.

46:33.000 --> 46:38.000
I played one of the Robot Tyson games that had the EVA units in it.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
It was pretty cool.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Oh, I forgot to mention a couple also in the US.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Disney's High School Musical, the game.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Let's get that for Shane.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
High School Musical Sing It on PlayStation 2.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
You know what I bought Shane for his birthday?

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
What?

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
Just going on a total tangent here.

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
I bought him tickets to see High School Musical on Ice here in Sacramento, and then he moved to Kansas.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
So, I don't know.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
I'll go with you.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Well, he has to send me the tickets because it's this weekend.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Oh, dude, tell him to send them back.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
I think he still has the tickets.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
Tell him to FedEx it.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
I'll go with you.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
Well, FedEx me your birthday present because Jamie and I are going.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
I'll go.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
I'll totally go.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
You really want to go see High School Musical on Ice?

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
I just want to go do something.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
I don't know.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
It's just going to...

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
I've never been to see anything on Ice.

47:15.000 --> 47:19.000
I know this is going to sound really wrong, but it just sounds so gay.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
I want to go.

47:20.000 --> 47:25.000
I petition that they have Manhunt 2 on Ice because that would be something I would like

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
to see.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
Blood bounces.

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
I don't even think I could get my boyfriend to go see High School Musical on Ice with

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
me.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
That's how gay it is.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
That's, like, super gay.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
That's like it's gay enough to like High School Musical.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
I would go see it for the novelty.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
And the fact that it's on Ice.

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
Why do people need to put things on Ice?

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Stop encouraging ice skaters.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
I mean, seriously, it's not a sport.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
I love ice skating.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
Ice skating is great.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
It's horrible.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Ice skating is fun.

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
My mom used to be an amateur roller skater and did figure roller skating.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
Roller skating is fine.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
I still don't like the figure skating part.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Roller derby is cool, though.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
Actually, it's kind of lame.

47:58.000 --> 48:02.000
We have a roller derby team in Sacramento that they wanted me to audition for.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
That's awesome.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
I could punch people.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
I'd be good at it.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
You know, though, you totally reminded me of something I didn't mention in my gaming

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
week.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
What?

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
We have Ace Combat 6 with a controller.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
Oh, how's that going?

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
I get totally motion sick on it, but it's really cool.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
Cool.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
The controller is really nice.

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
You know how they could get more people to go to E for All next year?

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Put it on Ice.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
E for All on Ice.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
I've never been ice skating, Rob.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
Yeah.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
I've never been ice skating.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Although, I hear E for All might get put on ice anyway.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
You've never been ice skating at all?

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
Never.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
We're going to go.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Okay.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
We have to for this Christmas.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
We're going to go because when my leg gets better, though.

48:38.000 --> 48:42.000
We can't do it this week, but when my leg gets better, we'll go ice skating for sure.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Just in time for the holidays.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
But I've been water skiing.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
Good times.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
Ice skating sucks.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
I hate it.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
I've tried it.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
It's okay, but it's lame.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
I'm really good at roller skating, though.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
I used to be able to do all kinds of stuff.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Cardamo says roller skating on ice.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Tigerclaw says DDR on ice.

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
No.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
There you have it.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
Do not want.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
GS68 says Mario Kart on ice.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
Oh, wait.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
They actually have those stages.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
You want to play Mario Kart in real life?

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Go to that RPM place that's near here.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
That's lame.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
That's like real life Mario Kart without the shells.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
You can't pass people because their tracks are too small.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
I had fun.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
William and I went on a date once to go to the...

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
We had fun.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
It was cool.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
If the tracks were a lot bigger, I mean, hell yeah.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Because you can drift around those corners and stuff.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
It's a good time.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
But then some of those car tires are all fucked up.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
I've never been kart racing right here.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
I've got a membership there.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
You wouldn't know the last time I did anything on a go-kart was Autopia at Disneyland.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
My first time going.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
Really?

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
And I haven't done Autopia since.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
Wow.

49:37.000 --> 49:41.000
And before that, it was at the Miracle Strip in Panama City, Florida, which they tore down

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
the Miracle Strip.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
I never go on Autopia.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
Isn't it on a track?

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
Isn't it on a lane?

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
Yeah, it is.

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
They had this thing that was called like...

49:49.000 --> 49:53.000
It was another car type thing, but you could actually drive these little cars.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
Like, you had a set path that they went on, but they weren't on a track.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
So you could actually run into people.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
It was great.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
I'm sorry, internets.

49:59.000 --> 50:03.680
We were talking about Japanese release dates, and suddenly we got into RPM motor racing

50:03.680 --> 50:06.120
and all that stuff.

50:06.120 --> 50:07.120
That's why they listened to us.

50:07.120 --> 50:10.000
And the charity was still going into crap on ice.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
Great.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
Violent fight on ice.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.600
Rama says Pokemon on ice.

50:13.600 --> 50:14.600
Dude, I think they have that.

50:14.600 --> 50:15.600
I think they've done that.

50:15.600 --> 50:16.600
I think they've done that.

50:16.600 --> 50:17.600
Yeah.

50:17.600 --> 50:18.600
Did you see that picture on...

50:18.600 --> 50:19.600
I'm never going to get these dates on.

50:19.600 --> 50:21.820
Did you see that picture on Dig this week?

50:21.820 --> 50:27.200
The whole thing, it was the picture of Pikachu, and it looked like he had a Vageen.

50:27.200 --> 50:31.200
Okay, somebody in the chat room, please dig up that picture, because Loki and Dark Soccer

50:31.200 --> 50:32.600
gave me blank stares right now.

50:32.600 --> 50:35.240
I need to show them the Pikachu picture that was on Dig earlier this week.

50:35.240 --> 50:36.240
It was so funny.

50:36.240 --> 50:37.240
Did he have, like, camel toe?

50:37.240 --> 50:43.440
No, but it was like a giant blow-up Pikachu, like at an amusement park, and all these kids

50:43.440 --> 50:45.000
were going in, but it looked like...

50:45.000 --> 50:46.240
They were going in his crotch.

50:46.240 --> 50:49.240
They were going in a big pika-gina, pika-gina.

50:49.240 --> 50:57.760
That was great, yeah, I think you can put that on your original Trauma Center on Ice

50:57.760 --> 50:58.760
when...

50:58.760 --> 50:59.760
I'm sorry, can we...

50:59.760 --> 51:00.760
I need to finish the Japanese release dates.

51:00.760 --> 51:01.760
I apologize.

51:01.760 --> 51:03.200
That would help, Rob.

51:03.200 --> 51:08.840
On the Nintendo DS this week in Japan, Dragon Tamer, Sound Spirits.

51:08.840 --> 51:09.840
In the...

51:09.840 --> 51:11.640
How in the hell am I supposed to pronounce this this week?

51:11.640 --> 51:20.480
Zaiden Hojen Nippon Kanji Norioku Kenti Kyoukai Koshiki Soft 250 Manin no Kanken.

51:20.480 --> 51:24.040
That is the biggest fucking game name I've ever seen.

51:24.040 --> 51:27.640
It looks like it's some type of, like, brain training type game with, like, 250 different

51:27.640 --> 51:29.720
little minigames in it.

51:29.720 --> 51:30.720
Woof!

51:30.720 --> 51:35.620
Wow, let's see, also of note, I want to go to PSP dates real quick, and then we can move

51:35.620 --> 51:37.140
on with the rest of the show.

51:37.140 --> 51:44.200
So in Japan, on the PSP, just movies, no games this week, but if you want to pick up Gremlins,

51:44.200 --> 51:45.200
it's out this week.

51:45.200 --> 51:46.200
Gremlins is the best movie ever!

51:46.200 --> 51:47.440
Yes, I suggest you do.

51:47.440 --> 51:51.940
I forgot something I played this week, and this is worth mentioning, sorry to derail

51:51.940 --> 51:57.240
the whole show here, but I downloaded a CDI emulator.

51:57.240 --> 51:58.240
What?

51:58.240 --> 52:03.900
And they have a ROM online for Super Mario Wacky Worlds.

52:03.900 --> 52:07.260
It was an unreleased game that is awful!

52:07.260 --> 52:08.800
It was so horrible!

52:08.800 --> 52:11.720
And I played it for about five minutes.

52:11.720 --> 52:12.720
Here's the picture, Loki.

52:12.720 --> 52:14.040
Oh, that's pretty bad.

52:14.040 --> 52:16.600
What's the CDI should not, oh my god.

52:16.600 --> 52:20.960
Yeah, so, yeah, the pan is on, oh my god, it was so horrible.

52:20.960 --> 52:25.920
I mean, basically they just ripped the sprites and music out of Super Mario World and just

52:25.920 --> 52:28.880
took a dump on it, and that's basically what it was.

52:28.880 --> 52:29.880
Horrible.

52:29.880 --> 52:31.920
SSJ100Matt asks, worse than Hotel Mario?

52:31.920 --> 52:33.680
Yes, worse than Hotel Mario.

52:33.680 --> 52:34.680
Well, maybe not.

52:34.680 --> 52:37.560
GS68 says, you're just pissing in an ocean of piss.

52:37.560 --> 52:41.720
I know.

52:41.720 --> 52:42.720
By the way...

52:42.720 --> 52:45.160
But they did have all the Zelda games on there too, if you want to play them.

52:45.160 --> 52:49.480
I swear to god, we'll move on with the show just after I say that Upuna does look to be

52:49.480 --> 52:52.360
that game I think you were thinking about, it's actually, wait, no, it's a role-playing

52:52.360 --> 52:53.360
game.

52:53.360 --> 52:54.360
It is a role-playing game.

52:54.360 --> 52:55.360
You control the entire thing with the nunchucks.

52:55.360 --> 52:56.360
But it looks cute.

52:56.360 --> 52:59.400
I hope they release that over here, it's by Koei, and there's the little box art.

52:59.400 --> 53:01.920
You know what Koei gave us, Rob?

53:01.920 --> 53:07.600
They gave us that game with the girl riding a missile, KO Flying Squadron.

53:07.600 --> 53:12.560
I could say something about girls riding missiles, but I won't in light of moving on with our

53:12.560 --> 53:13.560
program.

53:13.560 --> 53:15.560
Forza 2!

53:15.560 --> 53:20.080
Downloadable content has a price cut because people bitched about it enough.

53:20.080 --> 53:29.240
So the Twin Ring Motegi track is going to be decreased from 600 points to 400 points.

53:29.240 --> 53:32.960
Please you're paying too much.

53:32.960 --> 53:38.120
Funny because when we complained about the Guitar Hero download content, they didn't

53:38.120 --> 53:41.240
seem to care.

53:41.240 --> 53:46.900
We're selling plenty of it, shut up.

53:46.900 --> 53:50.000
So an interesting rumor has come out this week.

53:50.000 --> 53:56.500
Apparently someone who had gotten their 360 returned back from Microsoft after being repaired

53:56.500 --> 54:01.920
noticed that there was a few additional options in their dashboard, including stuff for the

54:01.920 --> 54:10.880
360's IPTV feature that was announced, I want to say a Tokyo Game Show, Consumer Electronics

54:10.880 --> 54:11.880
Show, I think this year.

54:11.880 --> 54:14.940
Is either that or Game Developers Conference.

54:14.940 --> 54:19.200
One of those shows earlier this year, it was announced.

54:19.200 --> 54:20.720
Good reporting, Loki.

54:20.720 --> 54:21.720
Excellent reporting.

54:21.720 --> 54:22.720
Awesome.

54:22.720 --> 54:27.220
So apparently it's going to have different features including being able to pause and

54:27.220 --> 54:31.920
record stuff being streamed off there.

54:31.920 --> 54:36.080
Of course none of these features really worked on it, but it's interesting to see that that's

54:36.080 --> 54:44.680
actually in his dashboard now, so most likely going to be included in the fall update.

54:44.680 --> 54:48.180
Now what I want to know is how the hell did that happen in the first place?

54:48.180 --> 54:51.120
How did some guy get this random update?

54:51.120 --> 54:55.360
Because I guess if he shipped his Xbox back, did they just send him a new Xbox that were

54:55.360 --> 54:58.440
meant to be held off until the update goes live or whatever?

54:58.440 --> 55:00.480
Maybe because it doesn't look like it's the entire update.

55:00.480 --> 55:04.760
Maybe they had an updated firmware or something like that that's going to be rolling out.

55:04.760 --> 55:07.360
I don't know when exactly the fall update is rolling out.

55:07.360 --> 55:11.160
It's probably within the next few weeks, so they're just probably getting it ready to

55:11.160 --> 55:12.160
go.

55:12.160 --> 55:16.000
What I would be curious of is that in light of this news, I wonder if other people that

55:16.000 --> 55:18.860
are getting their consoles back from Microsoft are going to find the same thing.

55:18.860 --> 55:22.000
One of my LiveJournal friends just had to send back their Xbox for Red Rings of Death,

55:22.000 --> 55:24.160
so I wonder if his is going to come back with that.

55:24.160 --> 55:25.160
Maybe.

55:25.160 --> 55:27.760
I don't know.

55:27.760 --> 55:28.760
It's interesting.

55:28.760 --> 55:33.480
I can't wait to have the IPTV stuff because, shit, more shows to watch.

55:33.480 --> 55:37.080
Although I'm not too familiar with Microsoft's IPTV service.

55:37.080 --> 55:38.080
I haven't been able to stay on-

55:38.080 --> 55:43.840
I'm actually very unhappy that my place I usually watch TV online is going away.

55:43.840 --> 55:45.560
TVlinks.co.uk.

55:45.560 --> 55:46.560
They got shut down?

55:46.560 --> 55:48.160
Yeah, they're on their way.

55:48.160 --> 55:52.200
They went the way of Oink, which was another huge news story this week.

55:52.200 --> 55:53.200
Anyhow.

55:53.200 --> 55:58.120
How else am I going to watch bullshit?

55:58.120 --> 55:59.840
I don't know.

55:59.840 --> 56:00.840
Mininova or something?

56:00.840 --> 56:01.840
I don't know.

56:01.840 --> 56:06.600
Anyway, going back to the Xbox Live Marketplace and other Xbox news, Blue Dragon, which is

56:06.600 --> 56:10.800
a game I need to go back and finish, has some new content.

56:10.800 --> 56:16.720
Apparently there is a new six-treasure pack for Blue Dragon.

56:16.720 --> 56:21.520
You have to pay 200 points for it, but you get some new items that will allow you to

56:21.520 --> 56:23.320
boost abilities.

56:23.320 --> 56:26.520
It sounds like this is some pay-to-unlock content for me because you're going to get

56:26.520 --> 56:32.520
a Whimsical Mind, which randomly enhances things by zero to four levels.

56:32.520 --> 56:36.760
The Way of Thieves, a battle item that will automatically steal rare items possessed by

56:36.760 --> 56:38.000
enemy creatures.

56:38.000 --> 56:42.600
The DV Phonograph, which will let you listen to the DV tribe dance, which is so freaking

56:42.600 --> 56:43.600
cute.

56:43.600 --> 56:45.520
I actually want to get that song because I actually got to that part of the game.

56:45.520 --> 56:46.920
It is a really cute song.

56:46.920 --> 56:53.360
The Nothing Glasses, it visualizes all those points because you can search everywhere in

56:53.360 --> 56:54.360
this game.

56:54.360 --> 56:58.600
It will allow you to actually see the points that you can search with little star symbols

56:58.600 --> 57:01.640
instead of just going around aimlessly.

57:01.640 --> 57:05.160
The Shuffled Helmet that will adjust magical and speed parameters.

57:05.160 --> 57:10.240
The Spring Wind Scarf, which will adjust HP and speed parameters by 20%.

57:10.240 --> 57:12.860
Basically you're going to pay 200 points to make the game a lot easier, it sounds like

57:12.860 --> 57:15.860
to me, which is interesting.

57:15.860 --> 57:21.400
It kind of reminds me of the previous story we had a few weeks ago about the whole pay-to-get

57:21.400 --> 57:24.720
things you will unlock yourself later in the game, except you're not actually going to

57:24.720 --> 57:25.720
unlock the player, it just makes the game easier.

57:25.720 --> 57:30.000
Well, the glass download content you paid to make the game harder, so now you have a

57:30.000 --> 57:32.040
full range of stuff.

57:32.040 --> 57:33.040
Interesting.

57:33.040 --> 57:38.000
Also, I just want to mention real quick, Spider-Man 3 has a new unlock as well.

57:38.000 --> 57:42.920
You get to download New Goblin, and this is notable because it was a Playstation 3 exclusive

57:42.920 --> 57:47.420
feature, but now for 240 Microsoft points, you can have it on 360.

57:47.420 --> 57:49.980
Which I heard by the way is lame.

57:49.980 --> 57:50.980
I wouldn't know.

57:50.980 --> 57:56.480
I try to avoid games based off of movies unless they're really good, which I can't even think

57:56.480 --> 57:57.480
of any off the top of my head.

57:57.480 --> 58:00.820
I don't know why you would still have Spider-Man 3 anyways, because I think that game really

58:00.820 --> 58:07.000
sucked and so, you know, it's probably not worth anything right now anyways.

58:07.000 --> 58:13.760
Well, for our friends in Japan, the Xbox 360 is getting a price cut.

58:13.760 --> 58:18.000
Finally, we knew it would eventually happen.

58:18.000 --> 58:25.800
The price cut is going to happen on November 1st, and it should be the equivalent of $243.

58:25.800 --> 58:28.360
Wow, that's a big cut.

58:28.360 --> 58:29.360
Yep.

58:29.360 --> 58:30.360
Nice.

58:30.360 --> 58:33.240
And this would be also why all those games I read earlier are getting a cut as well.

58:33.240 --> 58:34.680
I'm sure this all ties in.

58:34.680 --> 58:40.220
Make the Xbox 360 a little more cheap and maybe it can get a little steam in Japan.

58:40.220 --> 58:43.120
I know there's a few 360 games that are going to be dropping in price.

58:43.120 --> 58:46.760
I can't remember which ones, and I also know that there's some being discontinued.

58:46.760 --> 58:47.760
Wow.

58:47.760 --> 58:49.720
Like, Perfect Dark Zero is one of them.

58:49.720 --> 58:50.720
I remember.

58:50.720 --> 58:53.200
Good riddance, I'm sorry, but not a fan of Perfect Dark Zero.

58:53.200 --> 58:56.000
Make way for Perfect Dark Zero 2.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.200
Nah, please no.

58:58.200 --> 58:59.720
Where you still can't jump.

58:59.720 --> 59:01.120
Fucking hate that.

59:01.120 --> 59:02.600
That's the thing.

59:02.600 --> 59:04.560
Next-gen system, no jumping.

59:04.560 --> 59:09.360
The one game you can jump quite far in, actually, is Burnout Paradise, which is going to be

59:09.360 --> 59:15.880
coming to the US in January on the 22nd, and that is going to feature an open-world environment,

59:15.880 --> 59:18.800
which is going to be kind of interesting, because I know none of the other games have

59:18.800 --> 59:24.000
been like that, but you can basically drive around aimlessly really fast, smash into stuff,

59:24.000 --> 59:25.920
jump through the air, explode.

59:25.920 --> 59:30.240
All the fun stuff that you would be looking for in a Burnout game.

59:30.240 --> 59:34.500
So it seems that publishers are starting to get a little smart in releasing stuff in these

59:34.500 --> 59:41.360
slow months, like January and February and the entire summer, instead of just March and

59:41.360 --> 59:43.840
November and October.

59:43.840 --> 59:48.920
I'm liking this whole trend lately where it seems like game companies are learning there's

59:48.920 --> 59:50.680
12 months in a year.

59:50.680 --> 59:52.200
It's kind of exciting.

59:52.200 --> 59:57.360
They need to seriously do that, because usually March, everything piles up there, because

59:57.360 --> 01:00:00.920
that's the end of the fiscal year for a lot of the companies, and in November because

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.720
of the holidays.

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:07.040
I understand why you do the holiday push with the little kid games and the things that tie

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:10.660
into children's movies, like the Pixar movies and those like, I understand why you do that

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:14.520
for the holidays, because those are perfect games to get children that are into Santa

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.160
and all that stuff, right?

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.720
But games like Burnout Paradise, that caters to a crowd that's going to probably go out

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.960
and pick up a game whenever they damn well feel like it.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:26.120
So I don't think they're going to take a loss by releasing this in January.

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:31.720
But it's good, though, that it's coming out in January and not like, say, November, when

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.240
there's a ton of shit coming out.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:37.280
In January, I mean, January's actually looking pretty good game-wise so far.

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:45.520
They have NFL Tour, Devil May Cry 4, God knows what else, and then as well as this now.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.520
If they put it in a month that there's really nothing coming out, people are going to buy

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:52.240
that game instead of saying, well, I'm going to buy this one instead and save my money,

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:59.000
and then later on they may just decide not to pick it up.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.280
Well some other games that you might be able to play through the Christmas season, and

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.840
speaking of games that are geared at little kids, although I bet some big kids would like

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:05.840
this, too.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:09.960
THQ has announced they are bringing four new games to Xbox Live Arcade, and some of these

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:13.520
are very notable because they tie into Nickelodeon licenses.

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:20.120
SpongeBob SquarePants UnderPants Slam is coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, and I have to admit,

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:24.040
you know, hate me, call me names if you want, I think SpongeBob's hilarious.

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:26.760
The movie was so funny, but in a stupid way.

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.420
It's stupid funny, right?

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:32.080
So I'm kind of curious to see what the game's like, because I worry, because it's not like

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.720
this is the first time there's been a SpongeBob game, and most of the games are made of suck

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:40.560
and lose, but this, you know, being an Xbox Live Arcade game, I imagine it's not going

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:46.200
to be that great, but it does kind of open up Xbox Live Arcade to being, you know, a

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:50.560
lot of times Microsoft takes some shit for not being very kid-friendly, and certainly

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:54.160
you know Microsoft's going to be pushing this, especially with their new Xbox 360 arcade

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:58.920
console really pushing the family thing when Cenet comes out and all that.

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:02.360
That's part of their marketing, they have a whole family marketing plan that includes

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:09.360
that, Cenet, DDR Universe, actually Guitar Hero 3, and then these titles as well, Viva

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:15.080
Piñata Party, and then of course the Xbox Live Arcade stuff, and I know they did some

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:18.520
other announcements about like cartoons and stuff, so.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:22.960
By the way, the other games that THQ is going to be releasing, a game called Screw Jumper,

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:25.720
Elements of Destruction, and Rocket Riot.

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:26.720
SpongeBob and Screw Jumper.

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:27.720
Screw Jumper.

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:31.400
Yeah, it's kind of an odd name, but they are both scheduled for release next month, so

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:32.400
they'll be here in time for Christmas.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.000
You know what the world needs less of?

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Hmm.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
SpongeBob.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Yeah, I love SpongeBob.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.120
Elements of Destruction I know is coming out in the DS next year as well.

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:44.040
Screw Jumper, if you want to know what the hell that is, it's a vertical action racing

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.840
game, that's per an interview from the developers.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:51.880
You have to destroy alien mining equipment and architecture while plummeting downward

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:54.720
in a continual rapid free-fall descent.

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:58.940
The objective of the game is to maximize score by crashing into and dynamiting as many alien

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:03.520
structures as possible on the way down the mine shaft, then to initiate a detonation

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.040
and race back to safety on the planet's surface.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.300
So honestly, this sounds like it might not be bad.

01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:12.040
It's got aliens, it's got explosions, it's fast, it's racing.

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.120
Screw Jumper might be pretty awesome, we'll see though.

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:18.120
But sometimes games that seem awesome in theory really suck, so we have to hold out until

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.340
the demo's out.

01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:21.340
This November.

01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:22.340
That's so disappointing.

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.200
What the hell did the alien miners do to you?

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.560
I mean seriously, why do you have to destroy their shit?

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:28.180
That's what I want to know.

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:29.180
They're mining communism.

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:33.000
Oh, well in that case, let's down with communism.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000
That's right.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.360
I don't know where that came from.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.220
I don't either.

01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:42.320
It just seemed like the patriotic thing to say 40 years ago.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:43.320
Yeah.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:47.820
Drunami says, down with pants.

01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:49.920
Isn't this SpongeBob SquarePants?

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:50.920
Maybe that's what they did.

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:53.080
Maybe the aliens brought us SpongeBob SquarePants, and that's why they have to pay.

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.000
Maybe the aliens are SpongeBob SquarePants.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.320
Maybe they're mining underpants.

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.320
Underpants slam.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.800
That sounds kind of dirty.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.800
You know what?

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.440
Nobody likes dirty underpants.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.440
You know what?

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.440
Unless you're some sick fetishist.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:06.440
Yes, Jamie.

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.300
I like watching real stuff, so.

01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:10.300
You know what?

01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:17.920
I miss all the stuff from when I was a kid, because they expected kids to follow the story.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:18.920
Imagination?

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:19.920
Yeah, imagination.

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.280
That's what the Muppet Babies was all about.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.280
What the Babies is great.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.240
Tell me that cartoon wasn't the shit.

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.240
That's what that was all about.

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:27.600
I'll tell you, though, what I've had a revival of lately.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.040
Loki wants to make a joke.

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.920
Did you see Drawn Together Babies?

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:34.120
No, God, no, I didn't.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.600
Drawn Together wasn't funny last season, so I've been watching it.

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:40.280
I've been having a revival of Count Duckula.

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:41.760
That's pretty awesome.

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:42.760
And Danger Mouse.

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:48.280
But I tried going back watching Banana Man, and my God, that was horrible.

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:52.040
I can't believe I liked Banana Man when I was 12.

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.040
So you like Banana Man?

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:56.480
I used to like Banana Man.

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:58.560
Very very weird little British tune.

01:04:58.560 --> 01:04:59.560
Next story, please.

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.440
Yeah, Xbox 360 crap.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.440
How about that?

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:03.440
Yay.

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:08.080
Toshiba is saying no comment, except they didn't actually say comment, they just said

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.080
no.

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:13.920
It's about the Xbox 360 HDTVT rumor.

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.200
So, wait a minute.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:23.680
I mean, because, no, would you like to comment on the internal Xbox 360 HDTVT track?

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:24.680
No.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:29.640
Toshiba said no to the new Xbox 360 HDTVT rumor.

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:33.160
But we pretty much all still think it's a rumor, so whatever.

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:34.160
You know why this is newsworthy?

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.160
We don't believe them.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:37.000
Yeah, you know why this is newsworthy?

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.320
Because you know what they say about Microsoft rumors.

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:40.320
They're all true.

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.320
They're fucking all true.

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:47.880
If they don't have any, if they don't reek of fanboyism, they're usually true.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:53.280
The fact that they said no comment instead of no we have nothing planned, you know, is...

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.280
Exactly.

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.280
No comment?

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.280
Fuck.

01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.280
How'd they know?

01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:58.280
Goddammit.

01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:08.120
Anyways, one game I'm actually kind of excited to see coming to Xbox Live Arcade this week

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:10.560
is going to be Mutant Storm Empire.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:13.960
And I loved the Mutant Storm Reloaded game when it came out, still one of my favorite

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:14.960
shooter games.

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:18.400
It was a little bit overlooked because it was too similar to Geometry Wars, I think,

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.800
and it's slower paced.

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:20.800
Yeah.

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:21.800
This one, though, looks really cool.

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.240
They have it set up a little bit different.

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:27.760
Some of the changes you'll see from Reloaded is that the stages now, you actually kind

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:32.920
of, it's one long stage, doors open up, and it's kind of almost like a cross between Geometry

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:35.040
Wars and Smash TV almost.

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.960
That's good, because one of the biggest complaints I heard about the last Mutant Storm game was

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:42.840
that load between the levels, like that little stupid effect it would do, like it sounds

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:48.080
like a dying cat, but not really, like between levels, as it's shifting, you know, that kind

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.400
of slowed the action down.

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.200
So you hear that it's one giant level, that's awesome.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:54.400
Like the fucking Wayne's World camera effects or something like that, you know.

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.400
Yeah, exactly.

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.760
That would have been more entertaining.

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:00.520
But yeah, it's going to be coming out for 800 points.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:06.400
It's due out this Wednesday, October 31st, and it's going to be awesome.

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:15.800
I hope since it's Halloween, we're going to get some cheesy Halloween tie-in on the Xbox

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:16.800
Live Marketplace.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:17.800
Yaris 2!

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:18.800
Because it's scary.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:23.760
That is pretty scary.

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:29.520
This time, not only does it have tentacles, but it has mech destroyer legs that the car

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.880
runs on.

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:38.120
The game will just evolve into something that's not even Yaris, it's just like, whatever.

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:42.160
I think for the next year, we should make every effort to make a Yaris joke every week

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.160
on the program.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:47.740
Didn't that game remind you of like, the programmers of that After Dark screensaver decided to

01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:49.760
make a game and this is what it was?

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:51.360
Guess what Jamie never played?

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.360
What?

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:53.360
Yaris.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:54.360
Well, it's probably a good thing.

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:55.360
Yeah.

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:57.000
Consider yourself one of the lucky ones.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
It's free.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Download me!

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
I'm free!

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.200
I know it's a free game, hey, if it sucks, whatever, it's free.

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.200
No, it's not worth it.

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:09.360
You pay in the time of your life that you spend, you will never get back.

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.840
You lose party for your soul after playing that game.

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.440
That's okay, I don't got much left.

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:16.860
In fact, I would like to actually open up our mailbag.

01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:20.000
I would like to actually solicit- No, because I have to read that.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Well, too bad.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.640
We got to make you work a little harder.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:27.320
So I would like to solicit your best Yaris joke.

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:28.800
So I want to hear some Yaris.

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.120
It can be about the game, hell, it can be about the car, I don't care.

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:32.120
I was going to get one.

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.040
I want some Yaris jokes in the mailbag.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:37.840
Not tonight, because we haven't gotten to the mailbag segment, we will, but for next

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:41.960
week's show, you know, as you guys are listening to the podcast later, I want some Yaris jokes.

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:45.280
Honestly though, how is this good advertising for the Yaris?

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:50.400
I mean, now when you associate Yaris, you're going to think, suck, I mean, that's not-

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:53.880
I wouldn't think that's a good thing that, you know, Yaris, oh yeah, that's right, that's

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.040
a, you know, car that had a crappy game made for it.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:01.280
Or when I go shopping, and I like to see all the features of the Yaris, and they're like,

01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:05.880
oh yes, well it has the built-in air conditioning and the GPS unit and the, you know, the leather

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:06.880
interior.

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.800
I'll be like, yes, but where is the tentacle gun?

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:12.000
Where's the giant death tentacle?

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.920
That the commercials and- Where the fuck did I come out from, the stupid tentacle thing?

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:17.920
That's weird.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.640
Anyway, sorry, we need to move on with the news.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:20.640
Sorry.

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:21.640
Can we please?

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:22.640
Yes, we may.

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:23.640
Please, please, please, please, please.

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:24.640
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:27.360
I'm very excited about Spore.

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:31.200
You know, we've always heard these things, like Spore is not going to be out until 2009,

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.200
holy shit.

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:35.880
Well, now they're saying that Spore is about six months away.

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:36.880
And how do we know that?

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:40.280
Because that's what Will Wright said to BBC's Radio 5.

01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:45.080
Spore is in its final testing phases, and it's about six months away from release.

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:46.840
That's a rough date.

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:50.760
So it does kind of line up with the whole, we were thinking it wasn't going to be out

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:53.680
in April, or until April 2008 anyway.

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:58.440
So it kind of lines up with this, that it could be summer of 2008, you know, maybe late

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.040
spring is when you're going to see this game.

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:01.920
I would say it's probably going to be out summer of next year.

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:03.360
If it came out in April, that'd be perfect.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:09.360
April is like the crappiest game for months, or game for the year, yeah, basically the

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.800
worst month for games.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:11.980
So it's horrible.

01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:14.800
It would definitely be a highlight in a low month.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:15.800
Yeah.

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:19.440
Speaking of highlights, we love to read the emails from our listeners every week, don't

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.440
we, DarkSakura?

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.440
Yes, we do.

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:22.440
All right.

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:25.560
I had a gun to her head forcing her to say that.

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:27.960
No, we honestly do love hearing from the listeners.

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:30.120
We got some good emails this week, from what I understand.

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:35.800
So mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com is where you can send your emails.

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.720
And every week, DarkSakura jumps on in and pulls out a few of her favorites.

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:41.440
I don't think there's time to read them all tonight.

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:42.440
There's six.

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:43.440
Wow.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:44.760
Well, let's get started.

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:45.760
Long segment tonight.

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:50.120
This one comes from Ace Savior, I guess.

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.600
He's an X instead of an S for Savior.

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:55.640
Hey guys, first I will admit that I am pretty new to the show.

01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:59.960
I just found the show when I was looking for RSS feeds and podcasts on my PSP a couple

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:00.960
days ago.

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:04.360
I like the fact that you guys have a website made just for the PSP.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.160
Sorry that I haven't updated it in years.

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.400
Too bad it never gets updated.

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.400
Hey.

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:09.400
Loki.

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:14.920
I was going to do OLRE and I kind of, I did not re-register the, our main website's all

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:16.960
kind of broken too, so anyway, whatever.

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:21.080
I really appreciate it, seeing as how my PSP is the closest thing I can get to a laptop

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:22.080
at the moment.

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:26.480
Anyway, even after only a few podcasts, I can honestly say this is the best video game

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:30.600
internet radio show ever and I'm looking forward to more podcasts to come.

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:31.600
Keep on gaming, guys.

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.160
And then he said I was hot.

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:34.160
Aww.

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:35.160
I'm not.

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:38.880
If there's something that happens to women when they get married, they lose their heart.

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.880
Oh, stop it.

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:40.880
Yeah.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:41.880
Anyway.

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.320
You should see, I know DarkSakura's very shy, but you should see her outfit today.

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:45.320
She's very nice.

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:47.640
I'm wearing my pirate shirt that I got at Walmart.

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:48.640
I think it's cute.

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:49.640
With the skirt.

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:50.640
I like the skirt.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:54.360
They sell the same shirt at Disneyland and it's a bright red and they charge 30 bucks

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:58.120
for it at Disneyland and I paid 12 at Walmart.

01:11:58.120 --> 01:11:59.400
But what you're wearing today is darker.

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.740
It's Renaissance-y without being over the top.

01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:03.120
It's Renaissance-y but modern.

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:04.120
If that makes sense.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.960
I feel kind of like a rockabilly.

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.800
All right.

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:08.800
Anyhow.

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:12.280
Which actually ties into future news.

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:13.280
Super Arizona.

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:14.280
Ooh.

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.280
Next email.

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:16.280
Okay.

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:20.280
So, this one comes from Polinosis.

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:21.440
That's kind of a cool name.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:24.160
I was reading this fascinating article the other day and I was wondering what you guys

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:26.880
think of this man's opinion and he also included a joke.

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:29.920
It says, why is the bicycle lying on its side?

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:30.920
Why?

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:34.840
Because it was too tired.

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:40.120
Cricket, cricket, cricket, cricket.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.520
Did I accidentally invite jokes from the listeners last week?

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:43.520
I must have.

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:45.520
Good effort.

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:50.040
But, you know what?

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:52.960
This article is kind of long so instead what I'm going to do is I'm going to link it in

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:53.960
the chat room.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:54.960
What's the topic?

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:55.960
I want to know if I read it.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:13:00.000
It's about how reviews are phrased, I do believe so.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.280
And saying, consider the following sentences.

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.120
This book has good book read.

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.740
This record has good record listen.

01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:11.440
This movie has good movie watch.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.080
This game has good game play, right?

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.080
Yes.

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.080
Uh-huh-huh.

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:16.080
Funny.

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:29.280
I do sort of understand that, like you could say it plays well, you know, but yeah, I kind

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:37.840
of in my attention to semantics I guess that I do sort of agree with that.

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:40.000
But we'll read it more and maybe respond to it next week.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
I'm going to take that as a homework assignment.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.600
I'm posting it in the chat room.

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:44.600
All right.

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:46.560
I'll take a look at it real quick.

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:47.560
Okay.

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.560
Ooh, Pirate Bay.

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:53.680
Anyway, moving forward.

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:59.280
We have one from Mark F. Says, hi Jamie.

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:01.920
And my name is spelled the other way, by the way, but that's okay.

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.880
You've been playing a lot of Ragnarok online.

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:07.040
I haven't confirmed, but I think R02 Beta is out.

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.080
Have you been playing that or the original RO?

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:14.160
So since you're an MMO girl, have you played World of Warcraft or Guild Wars?

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:15.160
Keep up the great work.

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.160
You guys are very entertaining.

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:19.560
I hope you bring back your extra guests from time to time.

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:24.240
Well, I know that the RO2 Beta was out in Korea and I tried to sign up for it, but they

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.320
needed me to sign up for like a social security number or some shit.

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:28.320
So I didn't do it.

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:31.740
However, it has been brought to my attention that the RO2 Beta is now out in the United

01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:38.660
States and if my laptop is up to the task, I will be downloading that like a mofo and

01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:43.760
playing it like crazy because I love Ragnarok, especially since it's a Beta, it'd have to

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:44.760
be free.

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:45.760
What?

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:46.760
Sorry.

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:47.760
Keep going.

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:53.120
So, um, to answer your question, yes, I played World of Warcraft and I have stopped playing

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:56.240
for World of Warcraft because number one, it's on my other computer and number two,

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:58.720
honestly, I didn't think it was that fun.

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:03.000
It was only fun if I was doing quests with like one other person.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:09.080
Meanwhile, I spent Alltrack Valley weekend this weekend, racking up 6,800 honor points

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:10.400
so far.

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:12.720
I played Alltrack Valley a lot yesterday.

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:15.160
I have like 50 Alltrack Valley marks right now.

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:17.040
I do have a Guild Wars account.

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:21.600
It was purchased for me for my birthday, which I just got around to going through this whole

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:25.920
thing with NC, with the people at NCSoft are great.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:31.940
They're just really on the ball and they've been able to replace my confirmation codes.

01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:37.200
So I will be, hopefully sometime in the next week, getting back on Guild Wars.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.140
I have a character that looks like the Doctor.

01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:41.360
His name is John Smith.

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:47.400
I also have another character that was supposed to be in my friend's guild and she left the

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:50.520
guild so I have no idea what the hell's happening.

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:55.560
So I'll be on, you'll see me, I think.

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:59.120
And I also was thinking about getting into City of Heroes, but honestly, when do I have

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.120
the time?

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:05.960
Yeah, I played Rose online too.

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:10.400
One of my new friends, who I met through William, I believe is going to come on our show next

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:14.560
week and he's really into City of Heroes and the reason why I'm having him on next week

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:17.520
is he was in the Tabula Rasa beta, which is a game I'm pretty excited about.

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:18.520
I want to know more about it.

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:19.680
He was telling me about it.

01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:20.680
It sounds really awesome.

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:23.800
He's going to show me the game this week to see if it's something I want to get into.

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:28.200
So we'll have him on next week probably and talking about some of the PC games we sometimes

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:29.200
overlook.

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.000
So I have another email from the same person.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Well, okay.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Okay.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.120
Here are some of my comments for episode 252.

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:38.560
I love the 3D Street Fighter games.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:41.560
It was a different playing style that made the Street Fighter characters almost real

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:42.560
because of the limitations.

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:46.000
I got tired of them jumping nine feet in the air and spinning around like tornadoes.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.200
Sorry, you're alone in that one, buddy.

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:53.200
Well, at least he's not bringing up the motion capture game that was Street Fighter movie.

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.200
Oh, the movie, the game, or whatever?

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.200
Yeah.

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:57.200
True.

01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:01.200
He has a better laptop sales and external USB D-pads controllers.

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:04.520
Keep up the great work.

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:05.800
Cool.

01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:09.280
I liked the later EX games, honestly.

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:13.200
It was the first one that was kind of, well, bad.

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:14.400
But hey.

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:20.120
This one is from Spamoflauge, and I just think it has a cool name.

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:21.120
Bourgeois Daxacara.

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:24.680
Aw, that's French.

01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:28.200
So here's my statement of the week, and I'd love to get your opinion since I consider

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:29.880
you as experts.

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:33.720
I've heard that Nintendo is selling lots of Wii systems, but no games.

01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:34.720
Really?

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:39.520
What if occasional gamers turn out to be cheap bastards who don't buy games?

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:40.520
Three questions.

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:41.520
One, is my statement true?

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.760
Two, are Wii games not selling?

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:45.720
Three, where do you go to get the latest game sale figures?

01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:50.800
I know I could just Google it, but I like hearing Dark Soccer read my emails.

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:54.160
Merci, Spamoflauge.

01:17:54.160 --> 01:18:00.040
I know that you can find a lot of the sales sites out through Consumer Reports, too.

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:05.920
A lot of the new sites like Kotaku, what are the other ones?

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:06.920
Like Joystick and Destructo.

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:12.800
Yeah, they'll list game sales figures quarterly when they do the quarterly reports.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:16.040
And then I also, a lot of my UK news I get from Eurogamer.

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.520
Loki, where do you get your sales figures?

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:22.000
Is that coming from your way of your internal sources at your day job?

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000
NPD.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Oh.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.680
So, when you talk about sales numbers on the show, is that numbers you're getting from

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:28.680
your work?

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:32.160
No, it's from NPD Group.

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:34.600
I had plenty of Wii games they're selling, trust me.

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:39.680
Maybe not all of the Wii games that they want, like I know Donkey Kong, Barrel Blast didn't

01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:45.800
sell hotcakes, or maybe, I don't know.

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:48.840
But I imagine a lot of those Wii games, just based on what's out there, they're selling

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:50.160
to kids and families.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:54.440
They're not necessarily selling to a hardcore gaming audience, which is probably why, when

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:57.400
you think about the Wii, you hear these things about, well, the Wii's selling, but the games

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:58.400
aren't.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:02.800
Well, and also, a lot of people, they like Wii Sports, they're not going out and buying

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:03.800
other games.

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:07.520
A lot of stupid companies out there make games that are based off games and Wii Sports, like

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:11.400
bowling games and shit like that, and they're like, well, why is no one going to buy my

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:12.400
game?

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:14.640
Well, because their game comes for free with the system.

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:19.560
Also, there's a lot of games that are crappy ports of stuff, or just crappy controls and

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:20.560
whatever.

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:21.560
A lot of people get jaded by that.

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:24.880
It's like, well, shit, I don't know if I want to go spend $50 just to get a game that's

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:26.200
going to suck.

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:29.200
So maybe Wii buyers are a little more cautious.

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:32.760
Unfortunately, all the A-list titles on the Wii right now, too, are coming from Nintendo.

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:37.360
I can't think of a third-party, like, A or triple-A title on its way soon.

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:41.080
Sure, Chad will think of something, but I can't even think of anything.

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:44.960
Well, Manhunt 2, there's stuff from Capcom, Resident Evil, Umbrella Chronicles, Brothers

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:45.960
in Arms.

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:46.960
Okay, I'll give you Umbrella Chronicles.

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:50.000
Medal of Honor Heroes 2, it's going to be big.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.680
Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3, from Atari.

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:54.680
I personally am not used to-

01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:55.680
Magno 8.

01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:56.680
Oh, okay, there you go.

01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:57.680
Well, we'll see.

01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:58.680
Mm.

01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:02.160
Oh, Knights, says Gerardimo.

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:03.160
There you go.

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:04.160
Thank you.

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:05.160
Knights.

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:06.160
Okay, there you go.

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:07.720
Yeah, Beyonce, you may like Knights, but Knights, I don't think is going to be that

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:08.720
big of a game.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.600
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:13.440
I am excited about Knights.

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.880
I think it's going to be fantastically huge.

01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:19.100
I would totally believe, though, there's a lot of people just buying the Wii for Wii

01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:20.280
Sports, and that's it.

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:24.000
There's a lot of families I bet are doing it, and totally fine with Wii Sports.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000
But you know what?

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
There are some companies that are getting smart about the games that they release, and

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:33.960
a lot of them are pre-budget games, like this AMF Bowling Pin Busters from Bethesda, I think.

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:37.100
I think it's Bethesda, I'm not sure.

01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:42.440
It's coming out for 19 bucks, and it's a full-fledged bowling game for 20 bucks.

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:46.960
When I was younger, I was friends with a kid, and his family had a Nintendo, and they had

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:51.280
the Power Pad pack that had the triple game at Mario, Duck Hunt, and World Class Track

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:53.560
Meter, or whatever that game was that came with it.

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:54.940
That's all they had.

01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:56.300
That's all they had.

01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:59.160
And they played that stupid world-class thing all the time.

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.160
Exactly.

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:02.600
I mean, people like that shit.

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:06.000
Mario and Duck Hunt, I mean, what more do you need?

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Seriously.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000
All right, sorry.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000
We can move on with emails now.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.140
I'm actually reminded now that it's coming up about time that I have to start dusting

01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:14.140
off the Saturn.

01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:16.000
Why is that?

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.840
Christmas nights.

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:23.560
We've been about a year and a half, about two years out of our tradition, but we used

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:31.080
to, I've mentioned this before, but Dan and I bring out our Saturn every year and play

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:34.920
Christmas nights, and do the countdown right to Christmas.

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:35.920
Nice.

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:38.120
I love Christmas nights.

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:39.120
Anyway.

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:41.560
I love Christmas because I get presents.

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:44.560
My favorite holiday, though, is coming up in three days.

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:45.560
Halloween.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:46.560
This is Halloween.

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.520
It's a religious holiday for me.

01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:49.920
It's true.

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:52.160
It's a religious holiday.

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:56.040
Anyway, it's the end of the year.

01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:57.680
So moving forward.

01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:03.200
This one comes from Robert M. Two stupid things here.

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:04.760
This email, and no, I'm kidding.

01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:05.760
I'm just teasing.

01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:10.680
First of all, I'd like to, although I have participated in the fun myself, suggest that

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:14.420
we, after the whole Eye of Judgment bet is finished, drop the whole Loki as Tingle thing

01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:19.000
and try something fresh, such as Loki as Murray the Hippo from Sly Cooper.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.400
No idea why, just random.

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:22.080
I don't even know who the hell that is.

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:24.960
I know of the game, but I just don't know who that character is.

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:29.360
You know, I want to agree with this statement that maybe after the bet is lost, because

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:32.840
we all know it will be, that thing ain't selling a million units, that maybe we ought to drop

01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:34.440
the whole Loki as Tingle thing.

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:37.640
I don't know, there's a part of me that says it's just never going to go away, like the

01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:39.240
whole Death Cake.

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:43.800
Just because I did the voice one time, and I don't even remember how the voice was.

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:49.520
Seriously, how many years ago did Loki play Karaoke Revolution live on air?

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:53.840
It has scared him from doing karaoke permanently for the rest of his life.

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:54.840
That's the effect this show has.

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:59.120
No, it's just that we tried to duplicate the funny of it, and it's just you can't.

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:01.560
Yeah, the second time is never as good as the first.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:05.280
Just like if Loki does actually have to dress up as Tingle for whatever reason, it will

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:06.480
only happen once.

01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:10.680
Only then will we drop it, because we know now that if he does it again, it's just going

01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:11.920
to be some weirdo in a suit.

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:17.600
I think that it's more fun to speculate, and then once, okay, what was that story written

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:18.600
by...

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:22.480
Oh god, no, I can't think of the guy who wrote The Great Gatsby.

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:23.480
F. Scott...

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:24.480
Yes, thank you.

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:25.480
Fitzgerald?

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:26.480
Was that his name?

01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:27.480
Yes.

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:28.480
Okay.

01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:31.640
He's the girl who said she was going to cut her hair, she's going to cut her hair, and

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:35.080
she's suddenly Miss Popular, and everyone loves her, and then when she does cut her

01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:40.040
hair, everyone's like, oh, and then she leaves.

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:43.360
But seriously, he's going to set Eye of Judgment on fire.

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:44.360
That's going to be awesome.

01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.360
That'll be fantastic.

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.160
I just made a classic literature reference.

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:50.560
I will fucking dance around and set an Eye of Judgment on fire.

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:53.000
I won't wear a suit.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000
That's okay.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.960
So, to continue with this email, before we get all tangenty again.

01:23:58.960 --> 01:23:59.960
Sorry.

01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:01.520
Night of tangents tonight.

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:06.480
Second, I ran into someone I know who owns a DS Lite but isn't happy with the current

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:11.040
titles out there, and he told me, out of nowhere, that Nintendo should fire their game designers,

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:12.200
all of them.

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:15.480
When I asked why, he said that the company was following the bandwagon of rock band and

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:21.680
guitar hero and coming out with a game in which you strum a guitar and play chords,

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:23.720
which he considers to be just stupid.

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:36.440
Now, I don't care whether you don't like music games or whether you simply think a portable

01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:39.880
guitar game simply wouldn't work compared to having the actual instrument hardware.

01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:43.520
I can only think of two games right now that he could be talking about and to suggest that

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:47.840
Nintendo flat out abandoned over 20 years of first party development that is arguably

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:52.440
the only reason the company still has support because a different game developer on a completely

01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:56.680
different continent is publishing a game that he doesn't care for on their system seems

01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:59.560
dangerously ignorant and selfish to me.

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:00.560
Just venting, I guess.

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:04.960
Yeah, you need to fire your friend.

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:09.560
I think that you should point this out to your friend and go, now how do you feel?

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:10.800
No, here it is.

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:14.440
No, I don't think you should fire your friend, but your friend is misinformed on one huge

01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:15.440
thing.

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:17.720
It sounds like your friend is assuming Nintendo makes all these decisions.

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:18.720
They don't.

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:22.680
When Nintendo makes the system, developers buy the kits to make games.

01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:27.760
It's up to them what games they want to make, so when they make all these Imagine Babies

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:32.600
and whatever games are made, that's not Nintendo going, gosh, we really need someone to develop

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:34.040
a baby sim for our system.

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:37.680
No, they just kind of turn it loose out there, which in my mind is a good thing because a

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:40.360
lot of great ideas come from these third party developers.

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:45.880
Unfortunately, a lot of shitty ideas and cheap knockoffs come from them as well, but the

01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:49.120
other problem is I would not call, I'm assuming the games he's referring to there are like

01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:53.720
Jam Sessions and the Hannah Montana game, I would not call those knockoffs.

01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:54.720
They're different.

01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:56.440
I don't know.

01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:58.360
Just because they all have music in common does not make them common.

01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:01.280
Different is not necessarily bad.

01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:02.560
Yeah.

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:06.040
So, your friend unfortunately is a little bit misinformed.

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:07.040
Hater!

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:08.040
Your friend's a hater.

01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.040
Okay, I'm done.

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.040
All done with emails?

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:11.040
No more.

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:12.540
I said there were six.

01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:13.540
I can't count tonight.

01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:14.540
How many have we done?

01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:15.540
Five?

01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:16.540
Six.

01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:17.540
Oh, we've done six?

01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:18.540
Yes.

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:19.540
And we're done.

01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:20.540
Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:26.000
This segment is pushing an hour thirty, so let's wrap it up really quickly with a couple

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000
more stories.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Loki.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000
All right.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:35.560
Anyways, as most people in the US know, there's a lot of fire going on in the LA area there

01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:42.360
and now of course wildfires in the San Diego area have forced Midway to evacuate their

01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:48.320
San Diego office, but fear not, that will not delay Stranglehold any longer.

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:53.320
Actually most of the development happens in other places.

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:58.280
I think it's just their corporate office.

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:03.440
Don't worry, your Strangleholds and Unreal Tournament won't be delayed any further.

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:08.440
Well, Unreal Tournament might, but Stranglehold at least won't be.

01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:14.080
That's a real shame what happened there with those fires and gosh, I hope none of our listeners,

01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:16.920
I imagine some of our listeners had to have been affected by it.

01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:19.200
I mean, they evacuated what, like a million people?

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:23.120
And that whole process of being evacuated is no fun at all.

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:24.720
I don't know how many y'all had to go through it.

01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:27.600
I know when we had some bad flooding where I grew up, we got evacuated once.

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:28.600
This is scary.

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:29.600
The whole thing's scary.

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:34.200
And I hope, just in general, whether they were our listeners or not, just all those

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:36.680
people that lost their homes just going on like fires.

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:37.680
This is so sad.

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:39.400
I'm really sorry to hear it.

01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:47.880
Anyhow, let's go back to games before we get too depressing here and talk about Netflix.

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:51.400
And Netflix is kind of trying to set their eyes on the future.

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.080
Of course, Netflix has really kind of turned themselves into the current right now.

01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:59.680
I mean, hell, Ma and Pa video stores and even now Hollywood video is really being impacted

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:02.800
by some would say Netflix has been a huge part of this.

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:09.320
Well, Netflix has made an interesting comment and it came from the CEO, Reed Hastings.

01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:16.600
And he said he's interested in enabling Netflix through, quote, Internet-connected game consoles.

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:21.000
So very interesting that Netflix kind of wants to put their feelers out there on what they

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.420
can do.

01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:27.680
The other thing that should be noted about this is that back in March, Hastings actually

01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:29.800
is now on the board of Microsoft.

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:36.720
So you kind of go, hmm, could this mean that a Microsoft Netflix deal is in the cards?

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:42.680
I hope so because I think the way the Xbox Live marketplace is set up now is not very

01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:45.160
friendly to movies and finding movies.

01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:48.800
However, Netflix, on the other hand, has an awesome system to find movies and has the

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:49.800
whole friends thing and everything.

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:53.020
I think Xbox Live is kind of clunky when it comes to their movie downloads.

01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:55.960
So I think a partnership could be a step up for them.

01:28:55.960 --> 01:29:00.680
That's a little bit of fanboyism and dreaming there, I think, in a sense.

01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:04.600
That is a really big step because Microsoft kind of, they may think they don't need

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:05.600
Netflix.

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:10.000
You know, I talk about this every week and I probably sound like a broken record, but

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:16.120
Sony is going to have to step up really quick or a few major announcements and they're

01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:17.120
going to be screwed.

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:21.400
I mean, a lot of stuff is going to happen too quick.

01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:25.520
Microsoft already has a pretty strong download service for movies and stuff.

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:30.040
And if you add Netflix to that as well, where you can be able to pay a subscription per

01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:36.760
month and download as much shit as you want, that's kind of scary.

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:41.600
I know Sony is talking about doing something as far as a download service, but they're

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:42.920
kind of behind.

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:43.920
But we don't know.

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:46.720
I mean, just because it's on the board of Microsoft doesn't mean that maybe Netflix

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:50.760
teams up with Sony and that could be a huge boost for Sony, who seems to be finding the

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:54.040
majority of their success right now as being a Blu-ray player.

01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:55.720
It would actually be really good for them.

01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:58.200
So we'll see if it happens.

01:29:58.200 --> 01:29:59.200
Who knows?

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:04.480
Anyhow, it's about time we bring this segment to a close because we've been here for a

01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:05.480
while now.

01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:10.360
But before we bring this segment to a close, we have to wrap up by paying a little respect

01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:11.360
to our elders.

01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:15.700
And we like to do that through Dark Sakura's classic game of the week.

01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:20.840
So Dark Sakura, why don't you tell us what game you picked for this week?

01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:24.400
And I'm actually curious, because it's Halloween week, did you pick something a little Halloween

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:25.400
themed for us?

01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:31.120
Sort of, but actually I was more paying tribute to the release of Dracula X Chronicles.

01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:35.280
So I was picking one of my favorite games in the Castlevania series, which would be

01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:36.280
Kid Dracula.

01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:38.760
Oh, okay, Kid Dracula.

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:45.480
It was released in Japan as Akumajo Special Boku Dracula-kun, which translates to Demon

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:50.140
Castle Special, I'm Dracula-kun.

01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:55.240
He's playing as Alucard, pretty much, only he's Kid Dracula in the game.

01:30:55.240 --> 01:31:01.520
And it's all super cute, and he has some of the powers that he had in Symphony of the

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:02.520
Night.

01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:08.280
Actually, the major bad guy in this game ended up being an enemy in Symphony of the Night.

01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:12.440
So I love how they just tie in everything, I think it was really great.

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:18.780
But it's a fun little kid type platformer, it came out on the Famicom in Japan, also

01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:25.280
on the Game Boy, and over here we got it on the Game Boy.

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:29.920
I actually own this game, I'm very happy.

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:38.160
It has the first level music, I don't know if you can hear it very well.

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:46.760
Let me wait for it to get to the part.

01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:50.160
I missed this game when I was growing up, I never played this.

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:53.320
We didn't get it in America, we got it on Game Boy.

01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:56.480
Oh yeah, I was going to say, I remember it on Game Boy, I remember it seeing it somewhere.

01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:07.200
Yeah, but this is a remix of Beginning from Castlevania III, if anyone recognizes it.

01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:12.920
The other cool thing about this game is that, and I love how Kami does this, is that Kid

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:20.040
Dracula was also a playable character in Gokujo Parodius, which I thought was pretty cool,

01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:25.080
and he was also a hidden selectable character in Jiki o Shiberi Parodius, which is actually

01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:26.240
my favorite of the Parodius series.

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:32.960
Well I also love chatting Parodius too, so I'll be covering the Parodius series somewhat

01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:33.960
later.

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:34.960
Oh look, it has like the clocks.

01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:39.320
Yeah, you go in the clock tower and everything, it has a lot of the classic levels that you

01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:45.640
expect in the old Castlevania games, but it was so cute.

01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:50.480
It actually was kind of hard, it got really difficult at times, just like you have the

01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:52.320
swinging pendulum and everything too.

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:57.120
Very cool, a chat room is joining in on this, Escapist says, Kid Dracula made using an umbrella

01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:59.960
as a weapon badass long before Kirby gave it a shot.

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:00.960
Yep.

01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:03.600
Son of Dad says the music sounds very upbeat for a Castlevania game.

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:10.840
Well it was more of a parody style game, but it was actually pretty good for how it played,

01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:11.840
I loved it.

01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:17.680
I mean, we're talking about one of my top 20 games, I have to say.

01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:18.680
Wow.

01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:22.720
It has those little things that spin when you jump on them, lots of throwbacks to the

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:23.720
cast.

01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:24.720
And the bridge?

01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:25.720
Shoot.

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:33.440
This was actually a staple of my Game Boy collection for the longest time, and I really

01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:37.560
can't say too many good things about it, it really was very fun.

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:42.480
Plus I just love his little expression the whole time, he has this like, toothy grin

01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:44.320
the entire time.

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:52.120
I'm going to paste a copy of the logo in the chat room, just because it was adorable.

01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:56.400
I'm going to post the one off of Wikipedia.

01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:00.160
Gerardimo says Polka makes umbrella weapons best.

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:03.400
That's a Turtle Sonata reference right there.

01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:04.400
Why is he fighting here?

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:05.400
A Klansman?

01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:06.400
Oh my god, it is!

01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:07.400
Like he has a swastika on his head!

01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:11.120
I swear to god, look at his boss, he's fighting here at the end of stage one.

01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:12.760
Look at this.

01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:13.760
He's got a little swastika on his head.

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:17.680
I think it's supposed to be like, I don't think it's supposed to be Shaft, isn't it?

01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:20.640
It looks like a Klansman!

01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:23.720
That's crazy.

01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:24.720
Maybe this is a...

01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:26.200
Doing his part for racial equality.

01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:28.840
I guess so, he made the Klansman cry and run away.

01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:31.400
I'm hitting him too much, there you go.

01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:32.400
Interesting.

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:36.640
Alright, so there you have it, Kid Dracula, your game of the week.

01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:37.640
Yep.

01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:41.440
And I'm probably one of these days going to cover Proteus, and I always say I'm going

01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:42.440
to.

01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:43.440
Don't give it away!

01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:45.280
I didn't say when, I said eventually.

01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:46.520
Now you're here next week, right?

01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:50.280
You're still here next week, but it's two weeks that you leave for Alabama?

01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:54.360
No, I leave, I'm actually taking a red eye on Thanksgiving.

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:55.360
Gotcha.

01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:57.320
Okay, okay, so it's going to be a little later in the month.

01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:02.360
I just wanted to warn the listeners, be careful, because when Dark Soccer is out of town, you're

01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:03.360
done.

01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:04.360
I'm going to record my game of the week.

01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:05.560
Oh, you're going to record it?

01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:07.640
I thought we got to pick, in your absence.

01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:08.640
Ah, I'm sneaky.

01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:09.640
You are sneaky.

01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:11.640
What would you pick?

01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:15.400
I would definitely go back to the Commodore 64 and dust something off from those archives.

01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:16.400
I don't know yet.

01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:17.400
I don't want to spoil it.

01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:18.800
I do have a game in mind, right here.

01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:22.680
If you're going to go in that direction, then how could I deny anybody that?

01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:23.680
Alright.

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:24.680
Heart.

01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:25.680
Ugh.

01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:26.680
Alright.

01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:27.960
Loki, on the other hand, I have no idea what he'd pick.

01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:30.160
He'll pick Gals Panic or something.

01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:31.640
I would not pick Gals Panic.

01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:32.640
Or Miss World.

01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:33.640
Dude.

01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:34.640
I would not pick.

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:35.640
I would not pick that.

01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:36.640
That's stupid.

01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:37.640
Everybody move your body.

01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:41.000
Rob made the heart and I threw out the horns.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.960
Alright, anyhow, we really need to take a break here, because we were pushing almost

01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:47.760
an hour forty now, so we still have half the show to go.

01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:48.760
Oh my god!

01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:52.120
Dark Tetsuya points out Chill Einige.

01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:53.120
Oh my god.

01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:54.120
Okay, please.

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:55.120
We've got to take a break.

01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:56.120
No.

01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:57.120
I have to pee.

01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:58.120
We are never covering Chill Einige.

01:35:58.120 --> 01:35:59.120
Alright.

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.120
Okay.

01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:01.120
Break time.

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:03.040
We'll be back right after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:05.040
Real quick break for those of you guys on the podcast.

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:06.760
We'll see you in a couple days.

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:11.160
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:12.160
a week.

01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:35.600
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
