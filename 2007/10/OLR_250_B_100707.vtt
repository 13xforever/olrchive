Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.600
And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:21.600 --> 00:25.100
We are live here on this Sunday evening, October the 7th, 2007,

00:25.100 --> 00:29.100
for part B of our 250th weekly episode.

00:29.100 --> 00:31.600
That's 250 weeks in a row, give or take a few.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.600
It's applause.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.600
We're testing out our new applause light tonight, everybody. It's great.

00:36.600 --> 00:40.100
It just means that we've had nothing to do on a Sunday night now for how long?

00:40.100 --> 00:41.100
I know.

00:41.100 --> 00:43.600
I think we've gotten emails about this before, like,

00:43.600 --> 00:46.600
how do you guys manage to motivate yourselves to do it every week?

00:46.600 --> 00:48.600
And we just kind of go, well, we just do it, you know?

00:48.600 --> 00:50.600
It's our club.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.600
Some people go to, you know, knitting clubs.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.100
Some people go to church.

00:55.100 --> 00:57.100
Do or do not. There is no try.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.600
Some people go to poker. We do a radio show on the internet.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.600
Some people go to bingo.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.600
Some people go to a bar and get pissed, by the way.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.600
Anyhow, back to the news.

01:05.600 --> 01:07.600
So bungee. Bungee bungee bungee bungee.

01:07.600 --> 01:09.600
Some people play Halo religiously every Sunday night.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.600
I like the word bungee and I like saying it repeatedly.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.600
It's like balls.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.600
Just one of those words that makes you laugh.

01:17.600 --> 01:18.600
Well.

01:18.600 --> 01:23.600
Anyway, bungee has decided to be independent once again.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.600
You know what this means?

01:25.600 --> 01:30.600
This means we could very well get bungee games on a system that isn't an Xbox.

01:30.600 --> 01:33.600
They could go back to Mac games.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.600
Whoa.

01:35.600 --> 01:38.600
Halo for the iMac.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.600
You know, actually, that would be kind of rad.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.600
And you know what? It would look better.

01:42.600 --> 01:45.600
It would probably look better.

01:45.600 --> 01:49.600
Because what does graphics better, Mac or PC?

01:49.600 --> 01:50.600
The Mac.

01:50.600 --> 01:52.600
Exactly.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.600
That should be determined, actually.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.600
Not. No. No.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.600
This battle is not happening tonight.

01:58.600 --> 02:04.600
So Microsoft is going to continue keeping up with the Halo franchise.

02:04.600 --> 02:07.600
And continue to partner with bungee on games.

02:07.600 --> 02:12.600
However, we could have another rare on our hands.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.600
So Killer Instinct 3 by bungee?

02:15.600 --> 02:16.600
Ooh.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.600
I guess that wouldn't really happen, would it?

02:18.600 --> 02:20.600
Dude, I would love another Killer Instinct. Wouldn't that be great?

02:20.600 --> 02:23.600
That's a whole other company's issues, though.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.600
That's a whole other box of ex-lax.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.600
I want to say I heard that there's some part of the deal, though,

02:27.600 --> 02:30.600
where Microsoft gets first look at the games bungee puts out.

02:30.600 --> 02:34.600
So it's kind of like, well, we're setting you free, okay?

02:34.600 --> 02:37.600
So we're letting the hoe leave the bedroom.

02:37.600 --> 02:43.600
But she's still got to turn tricks for me whenever I want, basically, is what it is.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.600
It's like the pimp and his hoe.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.600
Kind of, yeah. That's what I'm saying.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.600
So the hoe's still got to put out when I need it, right?

02:48.600 --> 02:49.600
Yeah.

02:49.600 --> 02:50.600
So, yeah.

02:50.600 --> 02:54.600
I mean, then that makes me think, what in their right mind is Microsoft going to pass on?

02:54.600 --> 02:56.600
Because bungee makes a lot, a lot of hits.

02:56.600 --> 03:00.600
You know, I think the only way they're going to pass is if bungee says,

03:00.600 --> 03:03.600
hey, we want to make a game starring Mario,

03:03.600 --> 03:09.600
or we want to make a game starring, what's a Sony franchise, Ratchet and Clank?

03:09.600 --> 03:10.600
Spyro?

03:10.600 --> 03:12.600
Spyro, yes. We won't make a Spyro game.

03:12.600 --> 03:13.600
Well, that's not a Sony franchise anymore.

03:13.600 --> 03:14.600
Banjo-Kazooie?

03:14.600 --> 03:15.600
No, anyhow.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.600
No, that was Nintendo.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.600
That was Nintendo.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.600
Smash Bandicoot.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.600
Sweet Tooth.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.600
There you go.

03:22.600 --> 03:23.600
Sweet Tooth.

03:23.600 --> 03:24.600
Darkknight in chat.

03:24.600 --> 03:27.600
Chat.orangemanstrated.com says, Marathon. K, thanks.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.600
And GS191 says, I think it's time to revisit the Marathon series.

03:30.600 --> 03:34.600
Rama says, and Halo was originally developed for the PC before Microsoft bought them.

03:34.600 --> 03:35.600
Hmm.

03:35.600 --> 03:36.600
All right.

03:36.600 --> 03:37.600
Your comments in chat.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.600
Chat.orangemanstrated.com, when we tape live every Sunday night.

03:40.600 --> 03:45.600
Anyways, so as we've been talking for the past few weeks now,

03:45.600 --> 03:51.600
there's this new SKU that people keep talking about, the Xbox 360 Arcade console.

03:51.600 --> 03:54.600
Well, it's been listed on a few retail sites now.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.600
Toys R Us being one of them.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.600
Another one being Amazon.com.

03:58.600 --> 04:02.600
Both having it showing as being released on the 23rd.

04:02.600 --> 04:05.600
But, of course, I'm sure that means that it's not coming out, right?

04:05.600 --> 04:07.600
Because it must be fake.

04:07.600 --> 04:11.600
A rumor and stuff, since all this information has been constantly leaking out about it.

04:11.600 --> 04:16.600
For those who may not remember, it's basically the replacement for the core system.

04:16.600 --> 04:22.600
It will come with an HDMI port, a wireless controller, a 256 megabyte memory unit,

04:22.600 --> 04:26.600
and five Xbox Live Arcade games on a single disk,

04:26.600 --> 04:32.600
including Booboo, Rocket, Pac-Man, Uno, Feeding Frenzy, and Luxor 2.

04:32.600 --> 04:37.600
All for the same price as the current core system, which is $279.99 in the U.S.

04:37.600 --> 04:41.600
Uh...

04:41.600 --> 04:46.600
Yeah, you will not be surprised to see this come out.

04:46.600 --> 04:51.600
Yeah, this story just goes to prove that rumors about Microsoft are always true.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.600
I mean, right? Because this rumor about the arcade thing has been going around forever.

04:54.600 --> 04:58.600
Forever, and they have screenshots taken from the website.

04:58.600 --> 04:59.600
Yeah.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.600
That's what I was saying with the Namco.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.600
It's like, oh, let's take five games that are each a megabyte and put it on a DVD.

05:04.600 --> 05:08.600
It's like, ahh!

05:08.600 --> 05:13.600
Let's not bring up Namco in secrets. That's a sore subject for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.

05:13.600 --> 05:18.600
Because all Namco rumors are true, too, but they don't want you to know that.

05:18.600 --> 05:23.600
Anyhow, because I'm sure that certain games aren't coming to a certain platform next week or anything.

05:23.600 --> 05:28.600
They'll be rolling tether consoles soon, I'm sure.

05:28.600 --> 05:33.600
Moving on. Pardon the man behind the curtain there. Pay no attention to him.

05:33.600 --> 05:38.600
Going back to Halo 3. That's right. Halo 3 is in the news, and we love Halo 3.

05:38.600 --> 05:41.600
What's the hatred for Halo 3 over here, Casper?

05:41.600 --> 05:46.600
I don't hate Halo 3. It's just a boring generic space fighter game that I'm just indifferent about.

05:46.600 --> 05:47.600
Haha!

05:47.600 --> 05:48.600
Says Metroid.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.600
Yeah, but have you played the multiplayer game?

05:50.600 --> 05:52.600
It's not generic, thank you, huh?

05:52.600 --> 05:53.600
Oh, yeah.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.600
Oh, God. Are we going to get into the Halo 3?

05:56.600 --> 05:58.600
Yeah, that's why 73% of people voted for Samus.

05:58.600 --> 06:06.600
Well, I just want to say this. On the Japanese software charts this week, Halo 3 actually managed to top the charts in Japan.

06:06.600 --> 06:10.600
Now, keep in mind, though, that if you separate two of the Pokemon games and these Pokemon games,

06:10.600 --> 06:14.600
if you separate the two Pokemon games, then Halo 3 was number one.

06:14.600 --> 06:18.600
But this is just kind of a nyah nyah nyah for people who said that Halo would not do well in Japan,

06:18.600 --> 06:20.600
and the Japanese hate Halo, and blah blah blah.

06:20.600 --> 06:24.600
I would like to actually say, because I really suck at Halo,

06:24.600 --> 06:30.600
I got my ass kicked by a Japanese player the other day on Halo, and it made me feel, well,

06:30.600 --> 06:34.600
I mean, every time I play Halo, I feel inadequate, to be honest.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.600
But you do have the power of the donut armor.

06:36.600 --> 06:40.600
Yes, I have the pink armor, so that's always awesome.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.600
And I had to show Rob donut in red versus blue last night.

06:43.600 --> 06:50.600
Halo 3 moved 59,000 copies, but it should be said, Pokemon's mysterious dungeon Toki moved 55,000 copies,

06:50.600 --> 06:55.600
but there's another version called Yami which moved 46,000 copies, but they're counted separately.

06:55.600 --> 06:56.600
So, there you have it.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.600
By the way, PlayStation 3 is in the top ten.

06:58.600 --> 07:02.600
Elder Scrolls Oblivion is number nine on the Japanese charts.

07:02.600 --> 07:06.600
I think that's also newsworthy as well, to point out that that Japanese translation is doing pretty well,

07:06.600 --> 07:09.600
when it's a very, quote unquote, American RPG.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.600
Doing pretty well in Japan.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.600
But it's an RPG.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.600
Yeah, it is. So, good times.

07:14.600 --> 07:23.600
Well, something that is going to be coming out in the UK on the 9th of November is Gears of War PC,

07:23.600 --> 07:26.600
which we all know was an Xbox 360 title.

07:26.600 --> 07:33.600
There are five new single player parts of the game, new campaigns.

07:33.600 --> 07:37.600
Or, I'm sorry, there are new places to explore in the main campaign,

07:37.600 --> 07:46.600
and there's also an encounter with the, what's it called, Bromack, that's from the end of Act 1 in the 360 version.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.600
I guess it's this big dinosaur.

07:49.600 --> 07:50.600
I'd never played it.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.600
It's a big creature thing.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.600
They had it, like, in the trailers and stuff.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.600
Okay.

07:55.600 --> 08:02.600
Well, they've also, of course, expanded the multiplayer options.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.600
They have a bunch of new maps.

08:04.600 --> 08:07.600
There's also, they've improved graphic quality and resolution,

08:07.600 --> 08:16.600
so that if your machine is beefy enough, it'll make it look sweet.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.600
They don't have, though, the four player co-op.

08:19.600 --> 08:23.600
I'd like to ask a question and start a little fight here in the chat room and in the studio,

08:23.600 --> 08:27.600
because this is always fun, a little bit of controversy, speaking of Gears of War.

08:27.600 --> 08:31.600
Since both these games came out this year, which game do you think is better overall?

08:31.600 --> 08:35.600
Start with Loki. Gears of War or Halo 3?

08:35.600 --> 08:36.600
And why?

08:36.600 --> 08:39.600
I would say Halo 3 just because it's a lot more fun of a game.

08:39.600 --> 08:44.600
Gears of War was really fucking hard, especially if you don't play first person shooters a lot.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.600
You probably wouldn't like the multiplayer in it.

08:47.600 --> 08:50.600
And the multiplayer is kind of, I don't know, I didn't like the multiplayer for Gears of War.

08:50.600 --> 08:55.600
I didn't play it that much either, though, so I can't really judge it too much.

08:55.600 --> 09:02.600
Halo is fun. Now, if you're into just straight graphics, then Gears of War fucking kicks the crap out of Halo 3.

09:02.600 --> 09:07.600
And also, too, you know, a bit of semantics here.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.600
Gears of War came out last year.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.600
Oh, did it? I thought it was like November last year.

09:11.600 --> 09:14.600
Oh, damn it. Never mind.

09:14.600 --> 09:18.600
Well, then wait, but they're still out within a year of each other, so the question still works.

09:18.600 --> 09:19.600
So there you go.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.600
Well, how about this?

09:21.600 --> 09:28.600
If you were a completely new player sitting down and you played through Gears of War and you played through Halo, what would be your opinion? How's that?

09:28.600 --> 09:32.600
My thing is I love co-op mode in both of the games.

09:32.600 --> 09:36.600
I think they both have a stellar co-op mode, and more games should have co-op mode in them because it makes the game fun.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.600
Quit falling asleep over there, Eddie.

09:38.600 --> 09:44.600
But as far as I just didn't like the cover system in Gears of War, so Halo 3 is more of the game for me personally.

09:44.600 --> 09:45.600
I didn't like the cover thing.

09:45.600 --> 09:46.600
Say what you will.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.600
That's that.

09:48.600 --> 09:52.600
Alright, I'm sorry, we're putting the Nintendo fanboy to sleep, so we better move on with some news.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.600
So sorry to inconvenience you.

09:55.600 --> 10:00.600
Maybe we'll just get some completely random news, Loki, to wake Eddie up over there.

10:00.600 --> 10:10.600
Well, something very inconceivable has happened, and they have decided to make a Princess Bride game,

10:10.600 --> 10:19.600
which is going to be releasing a demo version of it to coincide with the 20th anniversary DVD of it,

10:19.600 --> 10:26.600
and it will be the True Love and High Adventure, the official Princess Bride game.

10:26.600 --> 10:35.600
Only one little problem, though, is that it is going to be a casual game, at least by the sounds of it so far.

10:35.600 --> 10:40.600
Wouldn't it be more appropriate to call this game Wuv Twi-Wuv?

10:40.600 --> 10:43.600
Mallage.

10:43.600 --> 10:47.600
But it is going to be a PC game, and it's going to be probably a downloadable title.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.600
Is it like point and click?

10:49.600 --> 10:50.600
No idea.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.600
Oh, I was just asking if it was like point and click, or what's the interface style?

10:53.600 --> 10:55.600
Nope, no one knows yet.

10:55.600 --> 11:07.600
It's being put out by, let's see here, well they said World Wide Biggies, which I've never heard of them.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.600
So Rob's choking?

11:10.600 --> 11:12.600
We're not going to go there.

11:12.600 --> 11:22.600
No, honestly, I've never heard of World Wide Biggies, which can be found at www.biggies.com.

11:22.600 --> 11:29.600
I don't know. I'm not familiar with any of their games, so I can't see if it's going to be good.

11:29.600 --> 11:37.600
Alright, well, you know, sleep all you want through the Halo and the Gears of War news, Eddie, but you've got to admit this is good.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.600
This is Halo being used for a good cause.

11:39.600 --> 11:42.600
This is a group called the Cave Girls who put this together.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.600
No, seriously, it's like a gaming group called the Cave Girls who put this together.

11:44.600 --> 11:51.600
It's a tournament called the Fight Like a Girl Halo tournament, and it's being held this year on October 20th, and it's on Xbox Live.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.600
It's a $10 entry fee. Anybody can sign up and it takes place.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.600
All the proceeds go towards the fight against breast cancer.

11:57.600 --> 12:02.600
So the tournament is being used to raise money for breast cancer awareness, which is pretty awesome.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.600
There's two different tournaments they're having.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.600
There's a single elimination and double team, two versus two.

12:07.600 --> 12:13.600
And if you want to check out their forums at CaveGirlForums.com, they really go down the list of everything that it is,

12:13.600 --> 12:16.600
and you can actually donate your entry fee there online.

12:16.600 --> 12:17.600
Pretty neat there.

12:17.600 --> 12:20.600
Very creative idea for a good cause.

12:20.600 --> 12:23.600
I would hope that maybe Microsoft, this will get on their radar.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.600
Maybe it'll be a blip on their radar.

12:25.600 --> 12:28.600
Maybe they'll advertise it on the site or something.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.600
Is it Cave Girls with a G?

12:30.600 --> 12:33.600
No, it's just like a cave G-I-R-L.

12:33.600 --> 12:37.600
Like a no riot girl G-R-R thing going on there or whatever.

12:37.600 --> 12:38.600
Girl.

12:38.600 --> 12:40.600
So there you have it.

12:40.600 --> 12:41.600
Girl.

12:41.600 --> 12:47.600
Well, the resident O-L-R Cave Girl is going to open up the mailbag right now.

12:47.600 --> 12:54.600
And you notice how she responded with a very cave girl.

12:54.600 --> 12:59.600
Hey, don't make me get out of this club and beat you.

12:59.600 --> 13:06.600
When you send in your e-mails every week to Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, our very own dark Sakura.

13:06.600 --> 13:07.600
Even if she is a cave girl, we still love her.

13:07.600 --> 13:11.600
She reads the e-mails and we respond to them.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.600
So open up the mailbag and let's see what's there.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.600
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.600
Our Tetsuya says Rob's going to get clubbed.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.600
First up, your mom.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.600
Last night.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.600
Ooh.

13:22.600 --> 13:23.600
Ooh.

13:23.600 --> 13:30.600
Anyway, we have an e-mail from Picaruno.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.600
Is that how it's pronounced?

13:32.600 --> 13:33.600
I believe so.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.600
Hi all.

13:34.600 --> 13:35.600
Hi.

13:35.600 --> 13:36.600
Who's all?

13:36.600 --> 13:39.600
I'm writing in to tell you about something I verified this week.

13:39.600 --> 13:44.600
So you know that Sony opened the PC version of the PlayStation Store in Japan only for now, right?

13:44.600 --> 13:50.600
Well, there's something decidedly dodgy about how they check to see if you're allowed to access it.

13:50.600 --> 13:55.600
When I tried to access the store, I managed to see the front page in usage FAQs.

13:55.600 --> 14:03.600
But since I tried to click on a game, I got an English message saying PlayStation Store is not available in the selected country or region.

14:03.600 --> 14:07.600
This is rather odd seeing as, you know, I live in Japan.

14:07.600 --> 14:13.600
So I took a screenshot showing the error message along with an IP geolocation result.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.600
It's on Flickr.

14:15.600 --> 14:23.600
Now you might be thinking that since I was using a Mac, the error message was a badly worded way of saying use Windows, fool.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.600
But no, even on Windows, I get the exact same error.

14:26.600 --> 14:30.600
Then Sakurina suggested I try changing my system's language settings to Japanese.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.600
Lo and behold, it now works.

14:32.600 --> 14:35.600
There are several reasons why this is retarded.

14:35.600 --> 14:40.600
First, regional settings on a machine should make no difference to a website.

14:40.600 --> 14:49.600
And also to point out something, when the Sarah Jane Avengers was first coming out and they had all the clips up and everything on the BBC's website,

14:49.600 --> 14:52.600
they actually had it blocked by IP, not by your language.

14:52.600 --> 14:58.600
This is what Sony should have done so that you couldn't see the website outside of the UK.

14:58.600 --> 15:03.600
But anyway, second is borderline racist as it implies.

15:03.600 --> 15:09.600
Anyone who doesn't have their computer set to Japanese, i.e. native Japanese people, shouldn't have access to the site.

15:09.600 --> 15:14.600
Seriously, I'm a registered resident of Japan and I have a legal right to access the store.

15:14.600 --> 15:18.600
It's ridiculous that I'm barred because I have my computer set in a language I'm more comfortable with.

15:18.600 --> 15:26.600
Does this mean that any native Japanese person can access the Japan store from wherever they are in the world just because of their computer's language settings?

15:26.600 --> 15:27.600
How dare you, Sony.

15:27.600 --> 15:33.600
You know what I would love for you to do is change your settings to Japanese.

15:33.600 --> 15:40.600
And I don't think you should be able to do this given where you live, but I would love to have somebody else anywhere else in the country,

15:40.600 --> 15:46.600
anywhere else in the world, set their language settings to Japanese and try to order to ship outside of Japan.

15:46.600 --> 15:52.600
I was going to ask, if that's all you have to do, then me living in the US, could I just change my language to Japanese and do it?

15:52.600 --> 15:56.600
The only other thing I think of, and this is because I've ordered stuff through Japanese websites,

15:56.600 --> 16:04.600
is that they actually, the way that the postal system works there, it has it all set by your postal code.

16:04.600 --> 16:10.600
And it's set by your postal code, what city you live in, and what section of the city you live in.

16:10.600 --> 16:17.600
It's really, really difficult because it's set so completely different than the US system that you're not going to really be able to...

16:17.600 --> 16:20.600
If the fields are preloaded that way, then you're not going to be able to do it.

16:20.600 --> 16:24.600
Huh. Well, good luck on your quest, Picaruno.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.600
Seriously.

16:26.600 --> 16:30.600
So, next email up is...

16:30.600 --> 16:39.600
You mentioned the orange box in the last episode, and it just occurred to me that I should send you guys my anti-orange box rant from a couple weeks ago.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.600
Okay?

16:41.600 --> 16:45.600
The rant. Valve and the orange box. Valve, you suck.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.600
That shall be the thesis of this rant.

16:48.600 --> 16:52.600
Wow, this is a rant with a college education.

16:52.600 --> 16:57.600
I log in to Steam a few days ago, and I see pre-order Half-Life 2, Episode 2.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.600
Now, I'm pumped. I love Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2, Episode 1.

17:00.600 --> 17:02.600
So, I click to pre-order, and I see this.

17:02.600 --> 17:09.600
Pre-order the orange box. The orange box contains Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2, Episode 1, Half-Life 2, Episode 2, Team Fortress 2, and Portal.

17:09.600 --> 17:15.600
So, instead of the $20 that was advertised when Valve first announced the ship date for Half-Life 2, Episode 2, TF2, and Portal,

17:15.600 --> 17:21.600
they added two games I already own and love into the package, cranked the price up to $50, and forced me to buy them.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.600
Again.

17:23.600 --> 17:25.600
I'm not pleased by this.

17:25.600 --> 17:31.600
Now, I wouldn't mind this normally, but this is the one way Valve has announced they're selling Half-Life 2, Episode 2.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.600
Why is that?

17:33.600 --> 17:37.600
This is the point where some of you might say that they did this with Half-Life 2's release.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.600
Now, I know I have a special edition DVD.

17:39.600 --> 17:43.600
The difference is Half-Life 2 completely upgraded the graphics system for its packaged older games,

17:43.600 --> 17:48.600
Half-Life and Counter-Strike, now known as Counter-Strike Source and Half-Life Source.

17:48.600 --> 17:49.600
Ugh.

17:49.600 --> 17:55.600
Now, some of the smart people may be like, wow, a company like Valve couldn't have screwed up their release this much.

17:55.600 --> 17:58.600
Oh, they think they didn't, but they have a solution.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.600
Gifting.

18:00.600 --> 18:05.600
It turns out that if I buy the orange box, I can give away Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2, Episode 1 to people.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.600
What happens to them if they want to buy Half-Life 2, Episode 2?

18:07.600 --> 18:14.600
Are they going to release it so that you can buy Episode 2 alone, or are they going to do it launch day, or are they going to make us wait?

18:14.600 --> 18:21.600
At one point, they were going to have the black box, which didn't have Half-Life 2 and Episode 1, but that was axed.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.600
Ugh.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.600
Okay.

18:25.600 --> 18:30.600
I'll probably break down and dish out the extra cash, because I absolutely adore the series, and must know what happens next,

18:30.600 --> 18:37.600
so if anyone wants a free copy of Half-Life 2 and Episode 1, I will probably post a follow-up regarding if I break down or not.

18:37.600 --> 18:43.600
Either way, Valve has gone out of their way to piss off the core audience in hopes of increasing their gamership.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.600
Well done, Valve. Well done.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.600
And that is from...

18:47.600 --> 18:49.600
There's still tons of people excited about this coming out, though.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.600
That's from Super Al.

18:51.600 --> 18:56.600
But that is, you know, nobody ever enjoys those type of bait-and-switch things, where it's like, you know,

18:56.600 --> 18:59.600
hey, you can get it for this low price, but oh, never mind, we don't want to do that anymore,

18:59.600 --> 19:01.600
because we thought of a way to make more money out of it.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.600
That's just capitalism at its finest.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.600
Oh, hell yeah.

19:05.600 --> 19:08.600
So, the last email, because we didn't get very many.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.600
Greetings, OLR peoples!

19:10.600 --> 19:11.600
Greetings!

19:11.600 --> 19:12.600
Ow, my neck hurts.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.600
This is from Pooface, by the way.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.600
I love that name.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.600
Hi, Pooface!

19:18.600 --> 19:23.600
On last week's show, you were talking about the asshole Mario levels on YouTube.

19:23.600 --> 19:27.600
Well, there is a download of a file you can use to patch Super Mario World ROM

19:27.600 --> 19:30.600
and turn it into the Kaizo Mario World Game, a.k.a. Asshole Mario.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.600
I downloaded it and played it.

19:32.600 --> 19:37.600
I was trying for nearly an hour on just the first part where you have to jump the Bullet Bills across the enormous jump.

19:37.600 --> 19:43.600
I still haven't gotten it, and I have no clue how many vulgarities I yelled at while trying to attempt this mass torture device.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.600
Download it and give it a try if you're feeling brave.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.600
Okay, I don't even need to download Asshole Mario,

19:48.600 --> 19:53.600
because you know what I did download this week on Virtual Console is Super Mario Bros. 2, the Japanese version.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.600
Which is almost asshole.

19:55.600 --> 19:59.600
Okay, that's a pretty asshole Mario right there.

19:59.600 --> 20:04.600
I was shouting obscenities, and I barely got to World 1-2, and I kept dying and having to continue.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.600
I mean, that game is hard.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.600
But the sad part is... I'm not dumb.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.600
Don't say that. You hurt my feelings.

20:10.600 --> 20:14.600
We got another email in, however I'm not going to read it because it was fairly rude.

20:14.600 --> 20:15.600
Save it for next week.

20:15.600 --> 20:16.600
About one of our listeners.

20:16.600 --> 20:17.600
Save it for next week.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.600
I'm not going to read it at all.

20:18.600 --> 20:23.600
Real quick though, I want to say that the sad part about it is I remember playing this game

20:23.600 --> 20:28.600
back when it was a part of Mario All-Stars on the Super Nintendo, and I totally beat it.

20:28.600 --> 20:32.600
No problem. It took me like a day to beat it. No problem.

20:32.600 --> 20:36.600
And now it's like my video game skills have deteriorated with age, and that just makes me sad.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.600
Okay, you're getting old, Rob.

20:38.600 --> 20:39.600
So which is harder, Rob?

20:39.600 --> 20:41.600
Maybe some asper cream to combat the arthritis.

20:41.600 --> 20:42.600
Shut up.

20:42.600 --> 20:48.600
Which is harder, that or the first level of Kid Icarus?

20:48.600 --> 20:54.600
Actually, seeing as I got to World 2 and Kid Icarus eventually, it's probably that.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.600
Terror, danger, horror.

20:56.600 --> 20:59.600
I didn't even know there was a second level to Kid Icarus.

20:59.600 --> 21:04.600
Kid Icarus, I only know the first level song, and it's like, wait a minute, did you beat the game?

21:04.600 --> 21:07.600
What about you, smartass? Did you ever get to World 2?

21:07.600 --> 21:09.600
I never played Kid Icarus.

21:09.600 --> 21:10.600
You suck.

21:10.600 --> 21:11.600
So no, I didn't.

21:11.600 --> 21:12.600
I've beaten Kid Icarus.

21:12.600 --> 21:13.600
Me too, when I was seven.

21:13.600 --> 21:14.600
I beat Rygar.

21:14.600 --> 21:15.600
Or no, I haven't been older than that.

21:15.600 --> 21:16.600
Rygar is a great game.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.600
Rygar is great except for the ending.

21:18.600 --> 21:22.600
Now, if you beat Rygar, that's hardcore, because you could not save or password that game.

21:22.600 --> 21:23.600
I know, that shit was hard.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.600
You have to leave the Nintendo on overnight.

21:25.600 --> 21:26.600
Oh, we did too.

21:26.600 --> 21:29.600
And you know what else though, Bionic Commando with Hitler's brain blowing up.

21:29.600 --> 21:30.600
That was great.

21:30.600 --> 21:31.600
I never beat that game.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.600
That game was so frickin' hard.

21:33.600 --> 21:34.600
You know what game was frickin' hard?

21:34.600 --> 21:35.600
It was Strider on the NES.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.600
It was based off of the Japanese comics.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.600
We need to pay tribute to video game endings at some point.

21:39.600 --> 21:40.600
Yes, we do.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.600
Good ones.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.600
Not ones that are like, the end user game.

21:43.600 --> 21:47.600
There actually was a funny YouTube clip, I want to say it showed up on Digg this week,

21:47.600 --> 21:49.600
about really bad video game endings.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.600
And it just was a bunch of bad video game endings back to back.

21:51.600 --> 21:52.600
It was kind of funny.

21:52.600 --> 21:56.600
I hate the ones where it's like, you can only get the good ending if you play in hard mode.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.600
You know, I'm thinking, ah!

21:58.600 --> 21:59.600
Wimp.

21:59.600 --> 22:00.600
I am playing hard mode.

22:00.600 --> 22:01.600
Wimp.

22:01.600 --> 22:04.600
All right, well if you would like Dark Soccer to read your emails on air, send your emails

22:04.600 --> 22:06.600
to mailbag at orangelandtrader.com.

22:06.600 --> 22:08.600
Just keep it clean, and don't make them mean.

22:08.600 --> 22:09.600
We don't like mean emails.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.600
I don't want emails bad mouthing other listeners, so just drop it.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.600
Unless you want to badmouth Loki.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.600
Yeah, you can, you can.

22:16.600 --> 22:17.600
Or Rice Princess.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.600
Hey, shut up.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.600
We need some good Rice Princess bashing emails.

22:20.600 --> 22:21.600
Hey, no.

22:21.600 --> 22:22.600
And Eddie bashing emails.

22:22.600 --> 22:25.600
Eddie's fine, but not me.

22:25.600 --> 22:26.600
All right.

22:26.600 --> 22:28.600
Let's move on to some gaming news.

22:28.600 --> 22:34.800
Anyways, it started out as an April Fool's joke from ThinkGeek, but now, due to popular

22:34.800 --> 22:37.280
demand, they have gone ahead and made it.

22:37.280 --> 22:39.280
It is the 8-bit tie.

22:39.280 --> 22:43.800
It's a tie that looks like it's made out of pixels, and you can buy it for yourself for

22:43.800 --> 22:46.640
the low, low price of $19.99.

22:46.640 --> 22:50.960
It's available on their online store, and I guess it's gonna...

22:50.960 --> 22:58.880
It's a way to get you some extra nerd cred, and it's a clip-on, by the way.

22:58.880 --> 23:03.760
So 8-bit tie, that's kind of nifty.

23:03.760 --> 23:06.320
All right.

23:06.320 --> 23:09.360
I think it looks kind of cool.

23:09.360 --> 23:12.000
I tried.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.920
I think it would be funny to wear it to work one day, just randomly, and have people stare

23:16.920 --> 23:19.520
at me going, what is wrong with you, because they don't already do that.

23:19.520 --> 23:21.480
Oh, did you guys see it in the studio there?

23:21.480 --> 23:22.480
Now, what do you think?

23:22.480 --> 23:23.800
Would you wear that out in public?

23:23.800 --> 23:24.960
Would you wear that to the bank?

23:24.960 --> 23:28.880
Not to the bank, but yeah, I would actually probably wear that.

23:28.880 --> 23:31.880
Because you're a nerd.

23:31.880 --> 23:34.040
All right.

23:34.040 --> 23:39.520
Well, something else that is not to be seen in public is new levels from the new Simpsons

23:39.520 --> 23:40.520
game.

23:40.520 --> 23:44.460
That is, if you're Rockstar, because Rockstar has their panties in a bunch because they're

23:44.460 --> 23:49.720
upset that the Simpsons game dares to make fun of Grand Theft Auto with its own little

23:49.720 --> 23:52.840
Grand Theft Scratchy game thing going on.

23:52.840 --> 23:57.720
Apparently, some of the game's content had to be pulled because Rockstar was not happy

23:57.720 --> 23:59.240
with the way the license was being used.

23:59.240 --> 24:02.560
Now, to be fair, Rockstar is not the only one, apparently, but Rockstar is the only

24:02.560 --> 24:05.560
one that's being called out by name.

24:05.560 --> 24:09.680
So apparently, at Leipzig, there was actually a poster at the games convention in Germany,

24:09.680 --> 24:10.680
right?

24:10.680 --> 24:13.760
There was a poster with Grand Theft Scratchy that caught Rockstar's eye, and they asked

24:13.760 --> 24:14.760
for it to be removed.

24:14.760 --> 24:19.320
Now, on the other hand, Harmonix, they thought Satar Hero was funny.

24:19.320 --> 24:25.940
So that is being left in the game, apparently.

24:25.940 --> 24:28.280
So apparently, some companies don't love it.

24:28.280 --> 24:33.200
Some people have a sense of humor, some do not.

24:33.200 --> 24:34.200
Probably it's without poo.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.200
I have no idea.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.200
I know somebody who has an electric sitar.

24:36.200 --> 24:43.320
But here's the thing is that I have this feeling, to Rockstar's credit, I have this feeling

24:43.320 --> 24:47.600
that it's just one suit who has their feathers ruffled over this.

24:47.600 --> 24:51.480
There's just one person whose words have been misconstrued to person versus person.

24:51.480 --> 24:53.800
Because I bet most people at Rockstar have a sense of humor.

24:53.800 --> 24:58.800
And it's sad that one person probably has made this whole thing get blown out of proportion.

24:58.800 --> 25:01.640
But that's what happens when you're an executive and you say something silly.

25:01.640 --> 25:07.100
Well the thing, I think that their thing behind it is that it's kind of, I mean, they're making

25:07.100 --> 25:12.200
it so that it's very obvious that it's a parody of Grand Theft Auto.

25:12.200 --> 25:17.240
I mean, Grand Theft's scratchy, they're not doing it like, you know, was it the game that

25:17.240 --> 25:22.800
was in the actual Simpsons show, which I don't remember was, like, Grand Theft Auto or something.

25:22.800 --> 25:26.880
You know, I don't remember where they called it, like, Death Hunter or something out, whatever.

25:26.880 --> 25:31.120
But either way, you know, the fact that it's so similar is why they're probably pissed

25:31.120 --> 25:32.120
off.

25:32.120 --> 25:35.600
I mean, if it was a game that you knew was kind of like Grand Theft Auto but didn't actually

25:35.600 --> 25:38.880
sound like Grand Theft Auto, they might not be so mad.

25:38.880 --> 25:41.160
Yeah, but is it really going to cut into their profits?

25:41.160 --> 25:42.440
No, it's not.

25:42.440 --> 25:45.400
They're just weighing little pussies, but, you know, that's still...

25:45.400 --> 25:46.840
Well, thank you for translating.

25:46.840 --> 25:48.840
I appreciate that.

25:48.840 --> 25:51.220
All right.

25:51.220 --> 25:55.560
One more story before we get into tonight's episode of Match Game, which we promised for

25:55.560 --> 25:57.840
this part of Part B. One more story.

25:57.840 --> 25:58.840
One more story.

25:58.840 --> 25:59.840
Hold your applause.

25:59.840 --> 26:00.840
We're not into match games just yet.

26:00.840 --> 26:01.840
We have one more story.

26:01.840 --> 26:03.400
We do, don't we?

26:03.400 --> 26:04.400
Mm-hmm.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.400
Ooh.

26:05.400 --> 26:06.400
We do.

26:06.400 --> 26:10.920
Well, more joy for our European buddies is that Call of Duty 4 is going to have a special

26:10.920 --> 26:11.920
edition.

26:11.920 --> 26:15.920
You know, there was the beta test and all that went on.

26:15.920 --> 26:22.040
So what's going to come with the special edition is two and a half hours of SCS footage with

26:22.040 --> 26:28.640
the elite soldiers' history and their formation in the Second World War up to modern day conflicts,

26:28.640 --> 26:35.520
a making of documentary, a level walkthrough by Infinity Ward, and a hardcover art book

26:35.520 --> 26:39.520
with lots of the concept pictures.

26:39.520 --> 26:42.920
And anyone playing on the PC has to download their strategy guide.

26:42.920 --> 26:45.920
And that will also be available in the United States.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.360
Cool.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.080
Worldwide loving for Call of Duty fans.

26:49.080 --> 26:50.520
But only on the Xbox 360.

26:50.520 --> 26:51.520
All right.

26:51.520 --> 26:55.480
Since it is episode number 250, we're going to play one of our very favorite games, the

26:55.480 --> 26:56.480
Match Game.

26:56.480 --> 26:59.480
But in order to play the Match Game, we need to get some contestants.

26:59.480 --> 27:03.160
So we're going to take, if you would like to play the Match Game, if you're in our chat

27:03.160 --> 27:05.240
room, just type me.

27:05.240 --> 27:06.240
Only once.

27:06.240 --> 27:07.840
If you type me more than once, you're not going to get picked.

27:07.840 --> 27:11.520
But if you type me once, then we're going to let Puppy pick our contestant from chat

27:11.520 --> 27:13.640
today because he hasn't really talked a lot in tonight's episode.

27:13.640 --> 27:14.640
I know.

27:14.640 --> 27:15.640
There's not enough microphones at once.

27:15.640 --> 27:16.640
I know.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.980
Sadly, our fourth microphone died, so we only have three microphones we're sharing.

27:18.980 --> 27:22.080
So Puppy will pick the chat contestant soon.

27:22.080 --> 27:25.360
But we also want to get somebody on the telephone.

27:25.360 --> 27:28.920
So if you would like to give us a call and be our person on the phone to play, give us

27:28.920 --> 27:29.920
a call right now.

27:29.920 --> 27:38.880
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio or our telephone number 1-877-GAME-OLR, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

27:38.880 --> 27:41.000
We're going to wait for somebody to call.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.600
There's a little bit of a delay between when we say something and when people hear it.

27:45.600 --> 27:47.480
Just now seeing all the me's jumping up the street.

27:47.480 --> 27:48.480
Yes, meanwhile.

27:48.480 --> 27:49.480
Okay, so Puppy sees all the me's.

27:49.480 --> 27:52.960
So why don't you pick somebody who said me only once that gets to play Match Game tonight.

27:52.960 --> 27:53.960
I'm going to roll.

27:53.960 --> 27:54.960
I'm just going to be nerdy.

27:54.960 --> 27:57.280
You're going to roll a D20?

27:57.280 --> 27:58.280
I did, actually.

27:58.280 --> 27:59.280
Oh my lord.

27:59.280 --> 28:00.280
Wait, hold on.

28:00.280 --> 28:01.280
Hold on.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.280
We're getting a chatter.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.280
Hold on.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.280
Hi.

28:04.280 --> 28:05.280
You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

28:05.280 --> 28:06.280
Who's this?

28:06.280 --> 28:07.280
Hello.

28:07.280 --> 28:08.280
You're on.

28:08.280 --> 28:09.280
Hi, Footy Monster.

28:09.280 --> 28:10.280
Hi, Footy Monster.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.480
How are you?

28:12.480 --> 28:13.480
Is there a bad delay tonight?

28:13.480 --> 28:14.480
Oh, it's probably...

28:14.480 --> 28:15.480
I'm fine.

28:15.480 --> 28:16.480
How are you guys doing?

28:16.480 --> 28:17.480
Good.

28:17.480 --> 28:19.840
It's probably the Operator 11 webcam causing us a little bit of a delay tonight.

28:19.840 --> 28:23.480
So I have a feeling we might have to kill Op 11 in order to have a little lag.

28:23.480 --> 28:24.480
I'm sorry, Operator 11.

28:24.480 --> 28:27.800
We're going to have to say bye-bye to you guys to kill the lag.

28:27.800 --> 28:28.800
But we'll see you next week.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.400
We're going to be here on Operator 11 with more OrangeLoungeRadio.

28:30.400 --> 28:31.680
Should we try calling back?

28:31.680 --> 28:32.680
No, that's okay.

28:32.680 --> 28:36.120
I'm pretty sure it's the lag is being caused from Operator 11, so we're just going to end

28:36.120 --> 28:37.120
the feed there.

28:37.120 --> 28:38.120
I can hear, but...

28:38.120 --> 28:39.120
Ah.

28:39.120 --> 28:40.120
Don't...

28:40.120 --> 28:41.120
Why are you staring at that?

28:41.120 --> 28:42.120
Meh.

28:42.120 --> 28:43.120
All right.

28:43.120 --> 28:44.120
Hopefully that'll help a little better.

28:44.120 --> 28:46.880
Can you hear us now, Footy Monster?

28:46.880 --> 28:47.880
I can hear you.

28:47.880 --> 28:48.880
I don't know if...

28:48.880 --> 28:49.880
All right.

28:49.880 --> 28:50.880
There might just be a little bit of a delay.

28:50.880 --> 28:51.880
That's okay.

28:51.880 --> 28:52.880
We'll deal with it.

28:52.880 --> 28:53.880
All right.

28:53.880 --> 28:54.880
Puppy, who's playing from chat room?

28:54.880 --> 28:56.880
My random roll of a die has picked escapists.

28:56.880 --> 28:57.880
Escapists.

28:57.880 --> 29:01.620
Oh, great, because escapists did the thing about the show tunes earlier, so I'm really

29:01.620 --> 29:04.960
excited to see what escapists is going to do during match games.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.120
So I'll send a message.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.720
You win.

29:07.720 --> 29:09.040
Stand by.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.120
All right.

29:10.120 --> 29:14.440
Do you know how the match game works, Footy Monster?

29:14.440 --> 29:15.520
I believe so.

29:15.520 --> 29:20.040
You say something, then blank, and have to figure out what that's supposed to be, right?

29:20.040 --> 29:21.040
Yes.

29:21.040 --> 29:23.240
We're going to say something with a blank, and you have to figure out what that something

29:23.240 --> 29:24.240
is.

29:24.240 --> 29:27.080
So I just want to make sure you can hear us okay, right?

29:27.080 --> 29:28.080
I can hear you okay.

29:28.080 --> 29:29.080
I think this is the grape.

29:29.080 --> 29:30.080
I can hear you okay.

29:30.080 --> 29:31.080
Okay.

29:31.080 --> 29:32.080
Well, that's all right.

29:32.080 --> 29:34.080
Now I see escapists has left chat, so I hope that's not a bad sign.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.080
Let's see.

29:35.080 --> 29:36.080
I want to make sure he's still there.

29:36.080 --> 29:39.720
Are you going to play?

29:39.720 --> 29:44.480
You left chat.

29:44.480 --> 29:45.480
That's never happened before.

29:45.480 --> 29:46.480
We have a player just leave.

29:46.480 --> 29:47.480
Oh, shit.

29:47.480 --> 29:48.480
I got picked.

29:48.480 --> 29:49.480
Bye.

29:49.480 --> 29:50.480
I'm bailing.

29:50.480 --> 29:51.480
I scared him off.

29:51.480 --> 29:52.480
Leaving.

29:52.480 --> 29:53.480
See ya.

29:53.480 --> 29:54.480
Oh, wait.

29:54.480 --> 29:56.480
I got a prime message back.

29:56.480 --> 29:57.480
Whoops.

29:57.480 --> 29:58.480
Yep.

29:58.480 --> 29:59.480
I'll still be there.

29:59.480 --> 30:00.480
Okay.

30:00.480 --> 30:01.480
Good.

30:01.480 --> 30:02.480
All right.

30:02.480 --> 30:03.480
What's over here?

30:03.480 --> 30:04.480
It is tonight.

30:04.480 --> 30:05.480
Footy monster versus escapists.

30:05.480 --> 30:06.480
But before we get to it, we need to get some theme music and introduce our celebrities

30:06.480 --> 30:07.480
tonight.

30:07.480 --> 30:12.240
All right.

30:12.240 --> 30:16.200
Celebrity number one tonight is the queen of the show who does not put up with shit

30:16.200 --> 30:17.200
from anybody.

30:17.200 --> 30:18.640
It is dark Sakura.

30:18.640 --> 30:19.640
Hi.

30:19.640 --> 30:21.720
All right.

30:21.720 --> 30:25.920
Celebrity number two tonight is the king of the show.

30:25.920 --> 30:26.920
It's me.

30:26.920 --> 30:27.920
No, I'm kidding.

30:27.920 --> 30:28.920
Loki is here.

30:28.920 --> 30:29.920
Say hello to Loki.

30:29.920 --> 30:30.920
I'm here.

30:30.920 --> 30:35.200
And celebrity number three is the other king of the show.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.200
I don't know.

30:36.200 --> 30:37.200
Rob.

30:37.200 --> 30:38.200
It's me.

30:38.200 --> 30:39.200
Hi.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.200
Hello.

30:40.200 --> 30:41.200
How you doing?

30:41.200 --> 30:42.200
All right.

30:42.200 --> 30:43.200
Also joining us tonight.

30:43.200 --> 30:44.200
Say hello to puppy.

30:44.200 --> 30:45.200
Hello.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.200
Yes.

30:46.200 --> 30:47.200
And puppy.

30:47.200 --> 30:48.200
Are you here to, are you here to plug anything puppy?

30:48.200 --> 30:51.640
Because celebrities on game shows are usually here to plug something.

30:51.640 --> 30:56.800
Normally I would plug baskin Robins, but I don't work for them anymore.

30:56.800 --> 30:57.800
So I don't give a shit.

30:57.800 --> 30:58.800
So go eat some Ben and Jerry's this week.

30:58.800 --> 30:59.800
Good idea.

30:59.800 --> 31:00.800
There you go.

31:00.800 --> 31:01.800
Go get your cakes from cold stone.

31:01.800 --> 31:02.800
All right.

31:02.800 --> 31:03.800
Moving on.

31:03.800 --> 31:06.960
Celebrity number five is rice princess.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.360
Hello there.

31:08.360 --> 31:09.360
Hello.

31:09.360 --> 31:10.360
Hi.

31:10.360 --> 31:12.460
And what are you here plugging tonight?

31:12.460 --> 31:13.460
My friends.

31:13.460 --> 31:15.460
You were about to say.

31:15.460 --> 31:17.460
La la la la.

31:17.460 --> 31:20.960
She's not like she's going to say her butt.

31:20.960 --> 31:21.960
Yes.

31:21.960 --> 31:29.400
And as carousel in chat says the drag queen of the show that might've been about somebody

31:29.400 --> 31:30.400
else.

31:30.400 --> 31:31.400
I don't know.

31:31.400 --> 31:32.400
There you have it.

31:32.400 --> 31:33.400
All right.

31:33.400 --> 31:34.400
And then also joining us.

31:34.400 --> 31:35.400
Celebrity number six.

31:35.400 --> 31:36.400
Hello.

31:36.400 --> 31:37.400
Casper the gay.

31:37.400 --> 31:38.400
Yes.

31:38.400 --> 31:39.400
How are you?

31:39.400 --> 31:40.400
Pretty good.

31:40.400 --> 31:41.400
Excellent.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.400
And what are you here to plug tonight?

31:42.400 --> 31:43.400
I will be playing your button.

31:43.400 --> 31:44.400
All right.

31:44.400 --> 31:45.400
Remember it's only porn.

31:45.400 --> 31:46.400
If you tape it.

31:46.400 --> 31:47.400
All right.

31:47.400 --> 31:51.120
Now, Footy Monster, do you have anything to plug tonight?

31:51.120 --> 31:52.120
I do.

31:52.120 --> 31:53.120
What?

31:53.120 --> 31:54.120
No, no, no.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.120
You don't get to plug unless you win.

31:55.120 --> 31:56.120
All right.

31:56.120 --> 31:57.120
Okay.

31:57.120 --> 31:58.120
There you go.

31:58.120 --> 31:59.120
All right.

31:59.120 --> 32:00.120
So here we go.

32:00.120 --> 32:01.120
All right.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.120
So since we all know how it works, here it comes.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.120
Question number one.

32:03.120 --> 32:04.120
All right.

32:04.120 --> 32:06.840
And Footy Monster, when you know your answer, just keep to yourself until the rest of us

32:06.840 --> 32:07.840
have come up with our answer.

32:07.840 --> 32:08.840
Okay.

32:08.840 --> 32:09.840
So here we go.

32:09.840 --> 32:10.840
Do I have to exit the chat or anything?

32:10.840 --> 32:11.840
No.

32:11.840 --> 32:12.840
You don't have to.

32:12.840 --> 32:13.840
You can use them for ideas.

32:13.840 --> 32:14.840
It's okay.

32:14.840 --> 32:15.840
It's not cheating.

32:15.840 --> 32:16.840
All right.

32:16.840 --> 32:19.840
So question number one.

32:19.840 --> 32:26.280
Jamie was very excited to hear that Brewfest was going to be celebrated in World of Warcraft.

32:26.280 --> 32:31.480
However, when she remembered that she canceled her account, she was sad.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.640
But that's okay, she thought to herself.

32:33.640 --> 32:41.840
If I want to celebrate with the Warcraft players, I can blank.

32:41.840 --> 32:45.440
Jamie was very excited to hear that Brewfest was going to be celebrated in World of Warcraft

32:45.440 --> 32:46.920
but she remembered she canceled her account.

32:46.920 --> 32:47.920
That's okay.

32:47.920 --> 32:51.600
If I want to celebrate with the Warcraft players, I can blank.

32:51.600 --> 32:55.600
Our celebrities will need to ding when they think of their answer.

32:55.600 --> 32:56.600
Ding.

32:56.600 --> 32:57.600
Ding.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.600
Ding, I guess.

32:59.600 --> 33:00.600
Bang.

33:00.600 --> 33:01.600
Bang.

33:01.600 --> 33:02.600
All right.

33:02.600 --> 33:03.600
Puppy?

33:03.600 --> 33:04.600
Ding.

33:04.600 --> 33:05.600
All right.

33:05.600 --> 33:06.600
Puppy's going to...

33:06.600 --> 33:07.600
All right.

33:07.600 --> 33:08.600
Here we go.

33:08.600 --> 33:09.600
All right.

33:09.600 --> 33:14.080
And do you have an answer, Footy Monster?

33:14.080 --> 33:16.080
I did, I think.

33:16.080 --> 33:18.080
Have you thought of one?

33:18.080 --> 33:19.080
Yep.

33:19.080 --> 33:22.760
We're having very bad connections to Argentina tonight.

33:22.760 --> 33:24.080
Have you thought of an answer, Footy Monster?

33:24.080 --> 33:25.080
Yeah.

33:25.080 --> 33:26.560
Can you hear me, guys?

33:26.560 --> 33:27.560
Yes, I can hear you.

33:27.560 --> 33:28.560
All right.

33:28.560 --> 33:29.560
Here it is.

33:29.560 --> 33:30.560
Footy Monster, fill in the blank.

33:30.560 --> 33:32.480
If I want to celebrate with the Warcraft players, I can...

33:32.480 --> 33:38.080
Dance nude with no armor in the middle of Ironforge.

33:38.080 --> 33:41.680
Ah, dance nude with no armor in the middle of Ironforge.

33:41.680 --> 33:42.680
Very good answer.

33:42.680 --> 33:43.680
Very good answer.

33:43.680 --> 33:50.240
The tape has said, gain 50 points and breathe through my mouth.

33:50.240 --> 33:51.240
I'm sorry.

33:51.240 --> 33:54.400
I guess I missed something here.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.400
I don't know.

33:55.400 --> 33:57.000
DarkSakura, what did you answer this?

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Let's see if there's a match.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Not play World of Warcraft.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.080
All right, fair enough.

34:04.080 --> 34:05.080
Not a match, though.

34:05.080 --> 34:06.080
Can I go next?

34:06.080 --> 34:07.080
Sure.

34:07.080 --> 34:08.080
Rice Princess.

34:08.080 --> 34:09.080
Now, I can celebrate by...

34:09.080 --> 34:12.800
Logging on to my Final Fantasy XI account.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.040
Not a match, either.

34:14.040 --> 34:15.840
Casper the Gay, what did you pick?

34:15.840 --> 34:20.480
Go to the strip club, the Full Murloc.

34:20.480 --> 34:22.480
You are an idiot.

34:22.480 --> 34:24.480
That's terrible, Urha.

34:24.480 --> 34:26.680
The Full Murloc.

34:26.680 --> 34:29.240
That was the best part.

34:29.240 --> 34:30.240
All right.

34:30.240 --> 34:33.500
Loki, I know I can celebrate by...

34:33.500 --> 34:35.440
Just drinking at home.

34:35.440 --> 34:36.440
Just drinking at home.

34:36.440 --> 34:38.800
How is that any different from any other night?

34:38.800 --> 34:39.800
All right.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.440
Good answer, but not a match.

34:41.440 --> 34:43.320
You would have a celebratory hat.

34:43.320 --> 34:46.720
Party hats, ooh.

34:46.720 --> 34:47.720
All right.

34:47.720 --> 34:48.720
Puppy.

34:48.720 --> 34:49.720
That makes drinking more fun.

34:49.720 --> 34:52.840
Puppy, I'm going to celebrate by...

34:52.840 --> 34:54.400
Drinking by myself.

34:54.400 --> 34:55.640
Drinking by myself.

34:55.640 --> 34:57.300
Good answer, but not a match.

34:57.300 --> 35:04.920
And lastly, my answer, she's going to participate by cosplaying in nothing but her Liederhosen,

35:04.920 --> 35:05.920
which also was not a match.

35:05.920 --> 35:10.080
Was that almost like a match with me, dancing dude kind of thing?

35:10.080 --> 35:11.080
No.

35:11.080 --> 35:12.080
All right.

35:12.080 --> 35:14.360
Yours didn't involve Liederhosen.

35:14.360 --> 35:18.760
Oh, escapist admits to being a shitty answer, okay?

35:18.760 --> 35:23.020
Escapist meant to say, gain 50 pounds and breathe through my mouth, because that would

35:23.020 --> 35:25.720
make her a better Warcraft player, get it?

35:25.720 --> 35:26.720
To be...

35:26.720 --> 35:27.720
Yeah.

35:27.720 --> 35:28.720
But, but, but, but, but.

35:28.720 --> 35:29.720
What?

35:29.720 --> 35:31.720
I have a life.

35:31.720 --> 35:32.720
Hey now, wait a minute.

35:32.720 --> 35:33.720
I play Ragnarok.

35:33.720 --> 35:34.720
I'm level 68.

35:34.720 --> 35:35.720
At least you don't role play.

35:35.720 --> 35:36.720
That's right.

35:36.720 --> 35:37.720
I still would not have been a match.

35:37.720 --> 35:40.600
But I did play on a role play server, however, I never partied with anyone.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.560
We were wondering what the fuck escapist was smoking.

35:42.560 --> 35:43.560
All right.

35:43.560 --> 35:44.840
Glad to know everything's okay.

35:44.840 --> 35:45.840
All right.

35:45.840 --> 35:47.320
Ready for question number two, everybody?

35:47.320 --> 35:49.040
All right, here we go.

35:49.040 --> 35:51.200
Are you ready for question number two, footy monster?

35:51.200 --> 35:52.200
Definitely.

35:52.200 --> 35:53.440
All right, bring on the pain.

35:53.440 --> 35:54.700
Here we go.

35:54.700 --> 35:56.360
Question number two.

35:56.360 --> 36:03.760
Loki immediately went and bought the 8-bit tie upon hearing of its release.

36:03.760 --> 36:04.940
It's a game, people.

36:04.940 --> 36:08.480
The wife apparently didn't feel so great about the tie.

36:08.480 --> 36:14.020
When Loki came home from work one day wearing the tie, the wife exclaimed, what is that

36:14.020 --> 36:15.440
around your neck?

36:15.440 --> 36:21.480
It looks like a blank.

36:21.480 --> 36:24.760
Loki immediately went and bought the 8-bit tie upon hearing of its release.

36:24.760 --> 36:28.180
The wife apparently didn't feel so great about the tie when Loki came home from work one

36:28.180 --> 36:29.180
day wearing the tie.

36:29.180 --> 36:30.540
The wife explained, what is that around your neck?

36:30.540 --> 36:33.020
It looks like a blank.

37:03.020 --> 37:05.020
You don't need to know about your ding on the show.

37:33.020 --> 37:37.920
Sorry, I just saw the answer all right here. We go finally escapist gives an answer all right footy monster you ready here. We go

37:38.860 --> 37:41.840

37:42.480 --> 37:47.260
The wife apparently didn't feel so great about the tie when loki came home from work one day wearing the tie the wife exclaimed

37:47.260 --> 37:49.420
What is that around your neck it looks like a?

37:50.860 --> 37:52.860
Piece of shit piece of shit

37:54.420 --> 37:58.360

38:08.080 --> 38:10.080
ding-a-ling ding-dong

38:11.120 --> 38:15.880
That's gonna be a tough one to match. Let's see though. You never know with this group all right dark soccer

38:15.880 --> 38:18.320
Did you put ding-a-ling ding-dong something close?

38:18.320 --> 38:25.120
I said big blue stripey pixelated looking dildo big blue stripey pixelated looking dildo good answer

38:25.120 --> 38:30.760
Not a match rice princess. Did you ever think an answer? Yeah? I said clubbed foot clubbed foot

38:31.600 --> 38:38.440
Good answer. I think but not a match Casper the gay. It looks like a stripe of rice princesses titty juice

38:40.480 --> 38:42.480
What

38:43.320 --> 38:45.320
What the fuck

38:46.520 --> 38:50.440
That doesn't make any sense what is wrong with you for real

38:50.440 --> 38:52.440
I

38:53.760 --> 38:55.920
Don't want to ask my boyfriend he

38:58.960 --> 39:00.960
Wow okay

39:00.960 --> 39:06.080
Loki for the love of God have a decent answer. It looks like a piece of shit piece of shit

39:06.080 --> 39:12.600
Oh and footy monster gets a point ding ding ding hooray all right puppy. It looks like a

39:13.760 --> 39:19.320
Dildo by Nintendo dildo by Nintendo dildo would have been a good answer all right a good answer

39:19.320 --> 39:24.880
But not a match and my answer says it looks like a fucking waste of our hard-earned money

39:25.680 --> 39:31.680
There you go all right way to be realistic. Sorry well. That's what she would really say I mean honestly

39:32.360 --> 39:33.800
All right

39:33.800 --> 39:35.800
So here we go

39:35.800 --> 39:37.800
I

39:43.960 --> 39:48.720
Right are you ready for question number three are you gonna keep up your lead footy monster?

39:50.040 --> 39:56.880
I'm gonna try all right, and it blow escapist out of the water tonight, but escapist you know try to catch up here we go

40:03.560 --> 40:07.160
We go question number three and our last question tonight

40:07.560 --> 40:10.640
Which thankfully has nothing to do with titty juice all right question number three?

40:11.840 --> 40:17.840
Rob was happy to make amends with Nintendo when he called that poor rep back on Monday

40:18.080 --> 40:23.600
They worked out their differences and the Nintendo rep said she would send out the Wii cases right away

40:24.120 --> 40:30.540
However Rob was very surprised and shocked when inside the box from Nintendo there wasn't any Wii cases

40:30.540 --> 40:33.120
But instead the rep sent him some blank. Oh

40:33.120 --> 40:35.920
Do I ever think ding ding?

40:36.600 --> 40:38.600
Ding of the century

40:38.600 --> 40:43.640
happy to make amends with Nintendo when he called that poor rep back on Monday. They

40:43.640 --> 40:47.640
worked out their differences and the Nintendo rep said she would send out the Wii cases

40:47.640 --> 40:51.120
right away. However, Rob was surprised when shots went inside the box from Nintendo. There

40:51.120 --> 40:54.680
wasn't any Wii cases, but instead the rep sent him some blank.

40:54.680 --> 41:19.400
Rob was very surprised and shocked when inside the box from Nintendo there wasn't any Wii

41:19.400 --> 41:31.080
cases, but instead the rep sent him some steaming piles of crap and escapist said instead the

41:31.080 --> 41:44.020
rep sent him some dried Yoshi crap. What the hell is wrong with our country tonight? And

41:44.020 --> 41:52.240
Argentina? Alright, Dark Sakura, we'll start with you. Instead of the Wii cases, the rep

41:52.240 --> 41:59.360
sent him some tube of lube. Good answer, not a match. Rice Princess, instead of the cases,

41:59.360 --> 42:12.640
the rep sent him some tacked. Not a match. Eddie, the rep sent him some titty juice.

42:12.640 --> 42:16.200
Yeah, I know that was coming. It was funny the first time. Oh, and Escapist will like

42:16.200 --> 42:19.960
to remind us he's Canadian, so I'm sorry. What's wrong with three different countries

42:19.960 --> 42:27.040
tonight apparently? Alright. Loki, Dooty! Dooty! Dooty, that's a match with Footy Monster.

42:27.040 --> 42:33.000
Footy Monster gets another point. Good job, Footy Monster. Alright. Puppy, Nintendo rep

42:33.000 --> 42:40.400
sent him some ribbed condoms. Ribbed condoms, not a match. Good answer though. And lastly,

42:40.400 --> 42:48.560
my answer, the rep sent him a bowel movement. Someone had the nerve to send me a bowel movement

42:48.560 --> 42:54.960
and they shall pay for this crime. Watch Pink Flamingo sometime. The couch has rejected

42:54.960 --> 43:00.280
me. Alright, so there it is, another match for Footy Monster. Footy Monster. Argentina

43:00.280 --> 43:08.640
beats Canada 3-0 tonight. Good job. Goal! That's okay, Escapist. We still love you.

43:08.640 --> 43:13.040
We love Canada, but unfortunately you did not win tonight. Enjoy our lovely partying

43:13.040 --> 43:18.680
gift. Our lovely partying gift tonight. Some of Rice Princess's love and affection. Love

43:18.680 --> 43:24.040
and affection. What did you think I was going to say? Perfect. Alright. Footy Monster, you

43:24.040 --> 43:28.640
win. You get to plug something. What did you want to plug? I just wanted to plug the Ultimate

43:28.640 --> 43:35.440

43:47.080 --> 43:51.340
educated on roleplaying games than we could ever be. So check that out on all games on

43:51.340 --> 43:57.280
Wednesdays or their site, ultimatequest.net. Awesome. Congratulations Footy Monster. Thanks.

43:57.280 --> 44:04.880
You're welcome. No problem. Now we're going to let you go. Bye. Bye Footy Monster. Alright.

44:04.880 --> 44:10.160
That was a fun match game tonight even if it was a little bit random. What is it not?

44:10.160 --> 44:14.440
I guess so. Alright. Anyways. More Skype calls later in the show but for now back to the

44:14.440 --> 44:19.120
news. So, I think a while back we talked a little bit about how they were going to be

44:19.120 --> 44:29.120
remaking Elevator Action for the Wii. Okay. Now they have a new game. It's, well, they

44:29.120 --> 44:33.680
first off, their first step in remaking the game is changing the name entirely to something

44:33.680 --> 44:41.560
really retarded called Spy Game Elevator Mission. And now it's a crappy looking gun game. Hooray!

44:41.560 --> 44:51.040
And if they had some screenshots on this ds-x2.com site, oh my god does it look like shit. So,

44:51.040 --> 44:59.100
I don't know. I only hope that that's just the DS screenshots although I think it's only

44:59.100 --> 45:05.480
for the Wii. You know, those are Wii screenshots. Wow. One of those games I don't recommend

45:05.480 --> 45:10.320
buying. I know it's coming out at the end of October for like $29.99. Probably not worth

45:10.320 --> 45:17.720
$29.99 but hey, find it used. Rent it if you really want to. It might not be that bad.

45:17.720 --> 45:22.100
Then again, it might be that bad. No, it looks really bad. I'll post some screens in the

45:22.100 --> 45:26.760
chat. They should have made it a sequel to like Leisure Larry like Elevator Mission.

45:26.760 --> 45:33.920
You mean Leisure Suit Larry? Yeah, whatever. Alright. I'm looking in our chat room here.

45:33.920 --> 45:40.040
Corizzle's commenting on the match game tonight. Show tunes would have added to the randomness.

45:40.040 --> 45:44.720
No show tunes tonight in match game. Go figure. It would have been one of my answers actually.

45:44.720 --> 45:49.600
Just the questions just didn't work out that way. Moving on in the news, if you want to

45:49.600 --> 45:56.060
go back to Halo 3, everybody's asking is Halo 3 it? I mean, I can't really talk about the

45:56.060 --> 46:01.100
plot of Halo 3 but let's certainly say it makes people think that Halo 3 could be the

46:01.100 --> 46:09.760
last game in the series. However, into which Eddie's going, oh man, Creamy River, meh.

46:09.760 --> 46:15.380
However, community leader Brian Gerard has revealed that Bungie is at work on another

46:15.380 --> 46:20.140
Halo game. It is based on the Halo universe and is a collaboration between Bungie and

46:20.140 --> 46:26.160
Peter Jackson. Isn't that Halo Wars? No, but that announcement's been out for a while.

46:26.160 --> 46:31.300
Yeah, that announcement was out there for a while, but it's not Halo 4. Some other Halo

46:31.300 --> 46:33.580
universe project. I thought that announcement was already out there as well. I thought it

46:33.580 --> 46:37.620
was supposed to be a movie or a game based on the supposed movie that they were going

46:37.620 --> 46:45.740
to do. Yeah, who knows? Who knows? Apparently though, if they do want to make a Pimps at

46:45.740 --> 46:50.220
Sea game, they do still have the ability to make that. Of course, the code name for Halo

46:50.220 --> 46:57.580
when it was being developed was Pimps at Sea, which actually is a game I would want to play.

46:57.580 --> 47:10.180
Who knows? Alright. So, for anyone who wanted the Halo movie, sucks to be you. It's dead.

47:10.180 --> 47:19.520
It ain't happening. You've been shafted. Yeah. For the bits that were on TV, they had nothing

47:19.520 --> 47:28.700
to do with the supposed movie. In fact, the powers that be are quoted saying, the film

47:28.700 --> 47:34.580
is entirely dead. The configuration it was in, whatever happens with that movie, assuming

47:34.580 --> 47:40.300
the movie gets made, will be a totally different configuration. It's not so much me as the

47:40.300 --> 47:45.940
entire vessel sank. Basically, it was a combination of, and there were two studios involved that

47:45.940 --> 47:51.580
weren't getting along in the process of making it, Universal and Fox. So, guess what sucks?

47:51.580 --> 47:58.300
Well, if they're not going to make it, I'll buy that Warthog that they made for prop purposes.

47:58.300 --> 48:06.340
That'd be kind of fun. You know, I'd rather they cancel the movie than make one that bastardizes

48:06.340 --> 48:09.700
the entire series, to be honest. I think we can all agree on that. It's probably for the

48:09.700 --> 48:13.260
best that they cancel the movie, as opposed to making one that will completely give the

48:13.260 --> 48:17.900
series a bad name. Which, I'm wondering, if the World of Warcraft movie is really based

48:17.900 --> 48:22.140
on the Alliance, maybe it should be Mercy Killed 2. I don't know. Because I heard the

48:22.140 --> 48:26.980
World of Warcraft movie is based on the Alliance, and who wants to pay $9.50 to see that, honestly?

48:26.980 --> 48:30.020
Yeah, the Horde's much better. Rice Princess is going to be in the theater

48:30.020 --> 48:33.060
by herself. Much more angst and anger on the Horde.

48:33.060 --> 48:37.260
All right. Pooface wanted to correct something I said, saying Pimps at Sea was a fake joke

48:37.260 --> 48:41.540
project that Bungie announced. But I thought at one point during the alpha process, people

48:41.540 --> 48:44.780
were seeing on Xbox Live playing Pimps at Sea. So, I think it was a little more than

48:44.780 --> 48:50.260
just a fake project. Well, it started off, it was basically they were seeing playing

48:50.260 --> 48:56.640
Pimps at Sea, which was the codename for Halo. And then for April Fool's Day, they created

48:56.640 --> 49:02.540
a poster or box art or teaser for Pimps at Sea, which featured a parrot with a pirate

49:02.540 --> 49:08.420
hook head. Which is pretty funny, actually. Now, I would go back to playing Puzzle Pirates

49:08.420 --> 49:11.740
if it had that theme going on. I love Puzzle Pirates.

49:11.740 --> 49:15.080
Yes, actually, I'm considering going back to it after not having played it for years.

49:15.080 --> 49:18.420
You played Puzzle Pirates about as long as I played Final Fantasy XI, huh? You played

49:18.420 --> 49:21.300
it a long time. I played it for about at least two years.

49:21.300 --> 49:22.420
Wow. Wow.

49:22.420 --> 49:26.260
That's hardcore. And it's still going, huh? Yeah, it's still going. They just, like in

49:26.260 --> 49:31.940
the last month and a half or so, released a couple of new big features that actually

49:31.940 --> 49:38.760
have made the game even more successful. And Three Rings is rolling in dough. And they

49:38.760 --> 49:45.180
have the coolest fucking office ever. SSJ 100 Matt says if he could cast the Halo

49:45.180 --> 49:49.900
movie, he might cast Horatio Sans as Master Chief. I think that might be a sure recipe

49:49.900 --> 49:50.900
for disaster. What?

49:50.900 --> 49:55.080
I think that's, no, I think that's more maybe why the movie got cancelled, who knows. Shadow

49:55.080 --> 49:59.460
Next Gen says with the success of Halo 3, I find it hard to believe there won't be a

49:59.460 --> 50:03.540
Halo movie. There's too much money to be made. Yeah, but they can make even more by just

50:03.540 --> 50:07.980
making Halo 4. Yeah, but, you know, it would be nice if they

50:07.980 --> 50:13.160
made a movie to fill in all the plot holes between the games.

50:13.160 --> 50:16.340
For real. Whatever, minimal. It's more like a plot dashed

50:16.340 --> 50:18.620
line. And Cortana can just randomly interrupt the

50:18.620 --> 50:23.260
movie going like, eh, save me, Master Chief. No, I mean, because, like, I mean, yeah, playing

50:23.260 --> 50:26.220
devil's, I mean, don't, don't people play it for the multimode? I mean, is it really

50:26.220 --> 50:31.340
about the, the actual game? I mean, look at all the advertisements that

50:31.340 --> 50:35.020
they did. I mean, they went through that whole process of like, oh, humanity's last hope

50:35.020 --> 50:38.020
is Master Chief. Believe! No, look, if, if.

50:38.020 --> 50:41.380
And it had nothing to do, those commercials had nothing to do with the game.

50:41.380 --> 50:45.620
Y'all know that if the Halo movie gets cast, I am bidding for the role of Donut. Okay,

50:45.620 --> 50:50.980
that's all I have to say. You have to watch, you have to watch Red vs Blue. Never mind.

50:50.980 --> 50:54.020
Oh, wow. Forget it. I would think that more people would do that.

50:54.020 --> 50:58.380
I love Donut. I love Donuts, too. Donuts, either way.

50:58.380 --> 51:04.540
No, no, okay, just, just go on YouTube and look up Red vs Blue and Donut, D-O-N-U-T.

51:04.540 --> 51:09.060
Or just go to Roosterteeth.com and view them all there.

51:09.060 --> 51:13.420
It's not pink, it's lightish red! Or you can watch all the episodes on Xbox Live

51:13.420 --> 51:17.400
Video Marketplace, or... Escapist says, I think there's a comic series

51:17.400 --> 51:21.220
coming out that fills in the hole between Halo 2 and 3.

51:21.220 --> 51:25.340
Fuck that, I ain't reading for shit! Why did they make me read?

51:25.340 --> 51:30.460
And GS68 is basically saying that I can play Tingle, but only, quote, as long as Loki is

51:30.460 --> 51:35.700
a Covenant alien in a Tingle costume. In the Halo movie.

51:35.700 --> 51:39.700
The fuck does that have to do with anything? I don't know, but it would be funny. Who would?

51:39.700 --> 51:45.180
Yes, they have some fascination with wanting to see me dress up as Tingle. I don't know

51:45.180 --> 51:48.020
why. No, we actually made a bet a couple episodes

51:48.020 --> 51:50.540
ago. We actually made this bet, and I'm totally

51:50.540 --> 51:53.100
going to reiterate this for our listeners' benefit.

51:53.100 --> 51:56.700
Loki said there is no way in hell the Eye of Judgment will be a success.

51:56.700 --> 52:01.100
So what we made the bet is, if the Eye of Judgment sells one million units in the first

52:01.100 --> 52:06.660
six months, then Loki will dress up in a Tingle costume, and skip around the garage while

52:06.660 --> 52:10.900
we film him on the Eye of Judgment live in a match with Bobby Blackwolf, and then set

52:10.900 --> 52:15.880
the Eye of Judgment on fire. Why has this not happened yet?

52:15.880 --> 52:17.940
Because the Eye of Judgment has to sell a million units first.

52:17.940 --> 52:21.660
We should still do it anyway. It did, it did.

52:21.660 --> 52:27.780
We need to convince Joystick or Kotaku or something to run the story as a lie, just

52:27.780 --> 52:33.700
so we can say, look, it happened. Where do you even find a Tingle costume?

52:33.700 --> 52:35.420
Get a green leotard and a pair of red for the looms?

52:35.420 --> 52:37.960
Rice Princess will have to get out her sewing kit.

52:37.960 --> 52:45.460
First off, Rob, just so you know, I do get monthly sales numbers, you know, of each title

52:45.460 --> 52:52.180
individually, so we can tell if they've sold a million units or not.

52:52.180 --> 52:53.180
Well, shit.

52:53.180 --> 52:55.180
We could ruin the fun.

52:55.180 --> 52:56.180
Thank you, Debbie Downer.

52:56.180 --> 52:57.180
All right.

52:57.180 --> 53:02.860
Or, or he can just, you know, change the numbers if it actually does sell over a million.

53:02.860 --> 53:04.260
He has, he could say he has proof.

53:04.260 --> 53:07.260
Yeah, we'll see. All right, well, okay, moving on.

53:07.260 --> 53:09.540
First off, it'll never sell a million.

53:09.540 --> 53:17.260
Anyways, so, um, there's a lot of Command & Conquer going around, apparently.

53:17.260 --> 53:23.220
Electronic Arts announced this week that they'll release a Command & Conquer Saga, which is

53:23.220 --> 53:27.140
a compilation of 13 games in the series.

53:27.140 --> 53:31.860
Included in it will be the original Command & Conquer, Command & Conquer the Covert Operations,

53:31.860 --> 53:35.860
Command & Conquer Red Alert, Command & Conquer Red Alert Counter-Strike, Command & Conquer

53:35.860 --> 53:41.540
Red Alert the Aftermap, Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun, Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun

53:41.540 --> 53:47.960
Firestorm, Command & Conquer Red Alert 2, Command & Conquer Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge,

53:47.960 --> 53:52.420
Command & Conquer Renegade, Command & Conquer Generals, Command & Conquer Generals Zero

53:52.420 --> 53:56.020
Hour and finally, Command & Conquer 3 The Tiberian Games.

53:56.020 --> 53:57.960
Where do you have time to play all that?

53:57.960 --> 54:00.400
That will be coming out later this month for 50 bucks.

54:00.400 --> 54:01.640
Says the manual.

54:01.640 --> 54:04.840
...

54:04.840 --> 54:09.880
Rice Princess, do not say things unless you're going to say them in a microphone, because that joke is lost forever.

54:09.880 --> 54:14.280
Alright, anyhow, really quickly, I wanna mention this MMO,

54:14.280 --> 54:18.020
which is something I'm looking forward to, it's a sci-fi based MMO, and it's by

54:18.020 --> 54:19.240
Richard Garriott, who

54:19.240 --> 54:23.660
of course, was the guy behind Ultima. Hell yeah! Tabula Rasa

54:23.660 --> 54:28.300
is coming out! Hell yeah! Tabula Rasa is coming out,

54:28.300 --> 54:35.300
But a little later than originally intended. It was going to be out this month, but NCsoft has had to delay the release until November 2nd, but that's not that far back.

54:35.300 --> 54:39.300
It was originally going to come out October 19th. It's been delayed a couple weeks.

54:39.300 --> 54:47.300
So apparently there was a post on the game's official website. The game is having some stability and balance issues, so it's going to be in beta for just two more weeks.

54:47.300 --> 54:51.300
It's a sci-fi based MMO that looks like it could be kind of fun, so I'm going to check it out.

54:51.300 --> 54:54.300
And the main character is Tank Girl? What?

54:54.300 --> 54:56.300
Dude, Tank Girl is awesome.

54:56.300 --> 55:00.300
Kind of. I don't know. Well, you can customize your character. I can show you.

55:00.300 --> 55:08.300
I don't know how to describe how the game looks. I was looking at a trailer earlier today, and it looks like, I don't know, like, Fantasy Star Online meets MechWarriors or something. It's kind of crazy.

55:08.300 --> 55:13.300
But it looks like fun, so I'm going to check. I want to try a good sci-fi MMO. We'll see.

55:13.300 --> 55:15.300
So you said they're working on balance issues?

55:15.300 --> 55:16.300
Yes.

55:16.300 --> 55:19.300
You mean there's actually MMO companies that care about that?

55:19.300 --> 55:22.300
Apparently. I don't know.

55:22.300 --> 55:25.300
Lord knows there haven't been enough class changes in WoW.

55:25.300 --> 55:32.300
Well, you know, the good thing about MMOs is that they can keep changing it if it ain't broke. Or if it is broke.

55:32.300 --> 55:35.300
Well, Blizzard likes to break things a lot anyway.

55:35.300 --> 55:37.300
Apparently I'm broken, and I need to be changed.

55:37.300 --> 55:40.300
If it's broke, break it more. That's the way you do it.

55:40.300 --> 55:43.300
Let's finish up the gaming news so we can get calls and end the show already.

55:43.300 --> 55:49.300
Well, Nintendo is giving us a little love. They're offering a Zelda feather stylus.

55:49.300 --> 55:50.300
What?

55:50.300 --> 55:52.300
A feather?

55:52.300 --> 55:58.300
Yeah, it's this transparent feather-shaped plastic thingy.

55:58.300 --> 56:05.300
It's like if you are registering your copy of Phantom Hourglass on Nintendo's website, you can get a stylus that looks like a feather pen.

56:05.300 --> 56:08.300
But really all it is is a chunk of plastic that looks like a feather.

56:08.300 --> 56:09.300
Is it free?

56:09.300 --> 56:10.300
Yes, it's free.

56:10.300 --> 56:12.300
Oh.

56:12.300 --> 56:14.300
I would think they would at least be able to pay for it.

56:14.300 --> 56:16.300
Register it like you didn't steal it.

56:16.300 --> 56:18.300
I'll register mine and give it to you.

56:18.300 --> 56:22.300
And that puts the nail in the coffin on those stories.

56:22.300 --> 56:26.300
All right. Well, we're going to be getting to the Skype line very soon.

56:26.300 --> 56:29.300
But one more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line.

56:29.300 --> 56:36.300
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeloungeRadio.

56:36.300 --> 56:39.300
So we look forward to hearing your calls very soon.

56:39.300 --> 56:41.300
But first, one more story.

56:41.300 --> 56:49.300
Well, unfortunately, I guess Rockstar is going to be giving out a Manhunt 2 themed Wii.

56:49.300 --> 56:54.300
What's disappointing about the whole thing is the whole artwork is a sticker, basically.

56:54.300 --> 56:57.300
I mean, come on, that's a little cheap, don't you think?

56:57.300 --> 57:03.300
But it looks like the Wii has been, I don't know, through some medical waste or something.

57:03.300 --> 57:06.300
It's like covered in fake blood.

57:06.300 --> 57:08.300
But once again, it's a fucking sticker.

57:08.300 --> 57:10.300
I mean, seriously, pay for it to be airbrushed or something.

57:10.300 --> 57:13.300
I mean, come on, that's fucking lazy.

57:13.300 --> 57:19.300
Watch that be some sort of GameStop promo item or something that comes with the fucking game.

57:19.300 --> 57:21.300
I just like the idea of a bloody looking Wii.

57:21.300 --> 57:25.300
It's this weird paradox, because Nintendo's always been so family friendly,

57:25.300 --> 57:29.300
so to see the Wii all horrified is pretty cool.

57:29.300 --> 57:32.300
Maybe they'll just have a Wii on her period sit on it.

57:32.300 --> 57:34.300
That's disgusting.

57:34.300 --> 57:37.300
You know, the times I don't want you to have a mic, you somehow get one.

57:37.300 --> 57:39.300
Oh my god. Like titties you should forget about.

57:39.300 --> 57:41.300
It's like having extra fur on the show again.

57:41.300 --> 57:43.300
I know, totally.

57:43.300 --> 57:47.300
Alright, Skyblind is open. Give us a call. 1-877-GAME-OLR.

57:47.300 --> 57:48.300
The calls are already coming in.

57:48.300 --> 57:50.300
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?

57:50.300 --> 57:52.300
Hey, it's Ronmo. What's up, everyone?

57:52.300 --> 57:54.300
Hello, Ronmo.

57:54.300 --> 57:56.300
What's up? How you doing?

57:56.300 --> 58:01.300
I'm doing good. I'm recovering from yet another convention I went to this weekend.

58:01.300 --> 58:03.300
What convention did you go to this weekend?

58:03.300 --> 58:12.300
It's Mong A Neck, a smaller, low-key convention geared towards Japanese comics and panels and cool stuff like that.

58:12.300 --> 58:17.300
And really quickly, sum us up for the con. What was the highlights?

58:17.300 --> 58:27.300
The 18-plus stuff, like 18-plus yaoi yuri dating game, the 18-plus match game that I ran, and cosplay chess.

58:27.300 --> 58:32.300
That's right. You asked us if you could steal the match game from us to play at the con, huh?

58:32.300 --> 58:39.300
I remember that. I was like, dude, it's a Mark Goodson production. It's not really our idea, so you'd rip it off just like we would, so there you go.

58:39.300 --> 58:45.300
That's okay. We recorded the whole thing, so we're going to try to dump it to DVD so I'll send you guys a copy of it.

58:45.300 --> 58:47.300
We'll see how rude and raunchy we got.

58:47.300 --> 58:50.300
Alright, sounds good. So what else is going on in your gaming world?

58:50.300 --> 59:00.300
Not too much. From listening from last week, I figured I would call in and get a much better review of Digital Life.

59:00.300 --> 59:01.300
I'd like to hear it.

59:01.300 --> 59:05.300
Alright. I swear to God, if we get into the DDR contest, this is going to be a short call.

59:05.300 --> 59:09.300
Well, I wasn't even there for that.

59:09.300 --> 59:12.300
Oh, thank God. Alright, so then what was your review of Digital Life?

59:12.300 --> 59:22.300
The rating on a scale from 1 to 10, I'd have to give it a 6.5. I'd gone to 3 out of 4 past Digital Life.

59:22.300 --> 59:32.300
Last year, it was big in the terms of there's more vendors, there's more companies, more distributors showing off newer products and selling cool stuff.

59:32.300 --> 59:36.300
This year, it was like as if they really couldn't get too much of anything.

59:36.300 --> 59:43.300
I mean, last year, Game Cap was having a Street Fighter III tournament giving out a lot of cool stuff.

59:43.300 --> 59:48.300
You had Guitar Hero 2, Justice League Heroes, a bunch of other cool games.

59:48.300 --> 59:52.300
And you had two different sets of pro gaming tournaments going on.

59:52.300 --> 59:59.300
This year, the big things were the Namco display, even though it was the same one from last year.

59:59.300 --> 01:00:02.300
They were there. It was just a little bit bigger.

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:07.300
Best Buy and Geek Squad were there. Intel showed up.

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:11.300
I think it was Global Gaming League out there this year with Dell.

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:18.300
They had famous people handing out autographs. They had a gamers lounge with the PMS clan.

01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:21.300
They had a little kid section for the kids to play games and stuff.

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:26.300
Why do you think things got downgraded this year?

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:29.300
That, I don't know. It didn't make any sense.

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:35.300
Because when I got there, I got there Friday after work for about hours and change.

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:41.300
I expected to be packed full of people, full of vendors and exhibits.

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:44.300
And I didn't see it, you know?

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:49.300
Do you think there's any correlation to the downsizing of E3 causing this?

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:54.300
I have no idea because, honestly, what Digital Life is,

01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:59.300
is more of an expo on the latest digital innovations and technologies

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:03.300
and some cool games that are coming out this year.

01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:07.300
Maybe what I think it was, so many people went last year thinking it was going to be all of this.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:10.300
And they figured, eh, what is it going to be so?

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:14.300
But the thing was, almost everybody there got in for free

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:19.300
because if you knew the proper code, which almost everybody knew,

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:23.300
you said you spent about $6-$7 for entries for four straight days.

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:27.300
Alright, so if you could give, just to kind of wrap things up here so we can get to some more calls,

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:32.300
if you had any piece of advice to give the Digital Life planners for next year's show,

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:36.300
what would you say?

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:39.300
Keep the same people you got here, get some newer people,

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.300
if you really want to expand and watch the game, get more companies in there.

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:45.300
More free swag, definitely.

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:49.300
Alright, more free swag. Free stuff is always a good thing.

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:52.300
Oh, definitely. Last year I made like a bandit.

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:57.300
Thanks so much for the call. Any last minute words you want to give our folks here?

01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:59.300
I love you, Irene.

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:02.300
Thank you too, Ranma.

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.300
Bye, Ranma. Take care.

01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:06.300
Come back out here and see us. Definitely.

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:07.300
I will. I promise.

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:09.300
Alright, you better.

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:12.300
Alright, give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:15.300
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:16.300
Let's go to the phones.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:19.300
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:22.300
Hola, como estas?

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:24.300
It's your ex.

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:26.300
Hi, Extifer.

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:27.300
What?

01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:28.300
We were just talking about you.

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:31.300
Oh, your ears must have been burning.

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:33.300
Oh, really? No, I didn't hear. I haven't been listening.

01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:39.300
I've been watching freakin' Flavor of Love or whatever.

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:42.300
How did you know to call us?

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:46.300
Because I got a text from Irene saying you guys were taking calls.

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:48.300
Dammit.

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:50.300
I'm supposed to say it on the air.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:57.300
Well, is there anything you would like to share that's gaming-oriented with your week?

01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:02.300
Sure. I love Puzzle Quest and WoW still.

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:04.300
Oh, Christopher, guess what?

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:11.300
Did Annie tell you that I'm moving my orc from Elder Thallus, my 38, to Ravencrest?

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:12.300
Really?

01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:13.300
Yeah.

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:14.300
Oh, my goodness.

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:16.300
I'm actually going to play on that server now.

01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:18.300
That's awesome news.

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:21.300
Hey, Christopher. Hey, Christopher. It's Eddie the Gay.

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:24.300
How's your iPhone doing?

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:29.300
My iPhone is doing absolutely wonderful. Thank you for asking.

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:31.300
Yeah, I miss it a lot.

01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:33.300
You do?

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:35.300
Yes, I'm Eddie and I do.

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:37.300
Brand new information, Eddie.

01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:39.300
Like everybody else's.

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:44.300
What the hell happened to this show? I mean, it's like our 250th fucking episode, for God's sake.

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:48.300
I always derail the show. It's my power.

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:49.300
It's your mutant power.

01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:51.300
Hey, except for say, titty juice.

01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:53.300
No.

01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:56.300
Titty juice? What?

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:58.300
All right.

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.300
At least he didn't talk about bleached assholes.

01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:06.300
Did you hear that Puzzle Quest is supposed to be the next week's release on Xbox Live Arcade?

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:09.300
That's nice. I'm still playing on my DS.

01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:11.300
Will you give Puzzle Quest on Xbox Live a try?

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:15.300
No, I'm not. I'm Christopher and I will not.

01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:16.300
Why not?

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:17.300
Because it's stupid.

01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:21.300
I don't have an Xbox 360, silly.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:25.300
Well, what if you had one? Let's imagine you had one. Would you pay the $15 to download it?

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:26.300
No, my hands would fall off.

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:29.300
No.

01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:31.300
What is your problem, Rice Princess?

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:33.300
This is X-Topher.

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:36.300
Sorry, X-Topher. What's your problem?

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:38.300
Xbox 360, that's my problem.

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:41.300
Wait, so what were you guys saying about me before I called?

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:46.300
That's something about how you derail the show. And look, look what happened.

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.300
I know. Look at me.

01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:56.300
I just want to take a moment and let everybody know that you guys need to think about me in the next two hours

01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:59.300
so they might find out if I get a promotion at work.

01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:05.300
I know that has nothing to do with video games, but think of me while you're playing your video games.

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.300
Yes, it does because you're going to level up at work.

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:09.300
Grats.

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:15.300
I will. I will level up at work. I'll be plus infinity to pwnage, man.

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.300
Yeah, man.

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:23.300
No matter what, win or lose on the job thing, we're still going to go to Disneyland in a couple of weeks to celebrate, right?

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:26.300
What does it have to do with video games, Ross?

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:28.300
I want to go to Disneyland.

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.300
This is what it has to do with video games because we're going to Disneyland

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:34.300
and we're going to be in LA at the same time E for All is going on, but we're not going to E for All.

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:39.300
By the way, a moment of silence from my premium annual pass which expired today.

01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:43.300
Did you know that you could play WoW at Disneyland for $7 an hour?

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:44.300
I just farted.

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:46.300
Why would I do that? Why?

01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:49.300
I didn't say you were going to, but you have the ability to.

01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:51.300
Really? Where is that? Because that's kind of a novelty thing.

01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:53.300
Why would you want to know? You wouldn't do that.

01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:55.300
I'm just curious. I'm going to take pictures of people who do.

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:58.300
Look, if I know you think I've ever been to Disneyland, geez. Someone just told me.

01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:00.300
Look it up, noob.

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:01.300
Stop being so poor.

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:02.300
No.

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:03.300
All right.

01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:04.300
I want to be poor.

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:06.300
All right. Any last words for our listeners, Extrofer?

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:12.300
Die? No, I'm kidding. Live, people, live.

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:14.300
Rude. All right, live.

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:16.300
You look beautiful.

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:17.300
Bye.

01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:18.300
Bye, Christopher.

01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:20.300
Bye.

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:22.300
All right, let's get some more calls.

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:31.300
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:37.300
Waiting for some calls. Just waiting for some calls.

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:39.300
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:40.300
It's GS68.

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:43.300
Hello, GS68. What's on your mind, buddy?

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:47.300
I'm still playing Maximum Tune 3. I finally got the soundtrack this week.

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:56.300
Damn it. I saw somebody linked me. I don't know if it was you or somebody linked me to where I could obtain the soundtrack for a low, low, low cost.

01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:57.300
A zero.

01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:59.300
Oh, no, it was just a very low cost.

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:00.300
What was the soundtrack?

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:02.300
Midnight Maximum Tune 3.

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:07.300
Oh, that just really sucks that you don't have that yet. Do you have that?

01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:11.300
Well, maybe you could play it for me.

01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:12.300
Over and over.

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:18.300
Yes, on my iPod. Anyway, okay, so tell me a little bit about Maximum Tune 3.

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:19.300
I would also like to hear it.

01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:20.300
The soundtrack?

01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:21.300
Mm-hmm.

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:33.300
Yeah, it's very good so far. Especially the songs. One song that sticks out is Black Pressure.

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:42.300
It's not the original Maximum Tune soundtrack. There's a song called Destination Black and it's the Blackbirds theme.

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:44.300
Why's it always got to be about the black songs?

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:57.300
Yeah, well, this song starts off with some choir chanting and that's what made it stand out from the other songs.

01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:59.300
But it's still Eurobeat, right?

01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:04.300
No, still, wait, Eurobeat?

01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:09.300
No, you're thinking of Initial D, silly. You think of Initial D as the Eurobeat music.

01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:11.300
Well, it still kind of is.

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:15.300
It's more of a Euro rave or something. I don't know how to explain it.

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:21.300
But is number three as good of a soundtrack as number two, if not better?

01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:26.300
Oh, I'm liking it better. It has more, I'm working out all the songs in my car.

01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:28.300
Is it good driving music?

01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:33.300
Yeah, it's pretty good, but only when you're driving.

01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:36.300
Just make sure to obey those speed laws, son.

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:40.300
Yeah, the problem is it's not very good music to listen to in traffic jams.

01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:43.300
It's probably not because then you want to run over the cars like it's burnt out.

01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:53.300
Or I'm going to stop. I just pause the music and rewind it back because I don't want to be listening to that kind of music when I stop because it wouldn't feel right.

01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:58.300
All right, well, appreciate the review of the soundtrack. Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:05.300
Yeah, J.P. Moss's Speedcar is horrible. It's an okay song, but it's the cheesiest song I've ever heard.

01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:06.300
Which song was this?

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:09.300
Speedcar, the one I was singing last week.

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:12.300
Oh, okay. Cheesy. All right.

01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:15.300
All right, well, thank you, GS68, for the phone call. Appreciate it.

01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:16.300
No problem.

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:18.300
Take care, buddy.

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:25.300
All right. We'll do one more call. 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:31.300
Give us a call. We'll talk. Our number is 555-4444. No, just kidding.

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:36.300
We're waiting for that call. Oh, here we go. Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:37.300
This is Pooface.

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:40.300
Pooface, what's on your mind, buddy?

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:47.300
I was just going to say how I'm really looking forward to Half-Life 2, the Orange Box.

01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:50.300
What is it about the Orange Box that has you so excited?

01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:56.300
I've just been really... I really got into Half-Life 2, and Portal looks really sweet.

01:09:56.300 --> 01:10:04.300
Like, I played the project thing, the Narbacular Drop game. That was pretty cool, but it was really short.

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.300
And Portal looks like it's going to make it a lot better.

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:11.300
And, of course, there's Half-Life 2 Episode 2, which continues the story of Half-Life 2.

01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:15.300
And Team Fortress 2, I've been playing the beta for a couple weeks. That's pretty sweet.

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:23.300
All I'm hoping is that later on, as a downloadable piece, that they have Garry's Mod, because that would be so awesome.

01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:26.300
It's my crap PC at home. Can't run Half-Life 2.

01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:32.300
Portal looks kind of interesting, but I can't help but think, didn't Prey have something similar, where you have the little portals?

01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:33.300
No one played Prey.

01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:39.300
I know. I played Prey. The one first-person shooter I did play was Prey. I beat Prey.

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:47.300
I played Prey. Yeah, I beat Prey. That was pretty cool, and that was what got me looking at Portal, because I thought the portals in Prey were pretty cool.

01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:50.300
I think they just switched the graphics and made it the same game.

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.300
Yeah.

01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:54.300
So, wait. Now, I see...

01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:55.300
It's a great month.

01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:56.300
Hold on. I have to say this, because I...

01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:57.300
It's a great month. Hang on. Okay.

01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:02.300
Uh-huh. Well, I see Casper the Gay over here in studio rolling his eyes at this talk of first-person shooters.

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:08.300
So, I need to give you a few seconds to try and sell Portal as what is so great about, what looks so awesome about Portal.

01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:15.300
Even if you don't like first-person shooters, it's not even necessarily a first-person shooter. It's more of a first-person, like, puzzle game.

01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:28.300
Like, it's really original, and it just looks like a lot of fun, and especially for the PC version, because people are going to be coming out with mods, like, for multiplayer, probably, and custom maps.

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:36.300
No, that's fair, because I liked Metroid for that reason, just because it's not a shooter, really. It's like an adventure, first-person adventure game, so good stuff.

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:37.300
That and your total Nintendo fanboy.

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:41.300
Yeah, whatever. No, but I don't like first-person shooters on any system, even PC, so...

01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:43.300
I get Uber motion sick.

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:45.300
All right. Anyhow, sorry, Pooface, you had another thought I cut you off from.

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.300
What's a fight in the days of Hexen?

01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:54.300
Uh, well, yeah, I've also been looking forward to Guitar Hero 3, obviously.

01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:56.300
I'm totally looking forward to Guitar Hero 3.

01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:57.300
Me, too.

01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:02.300
Because I actually have a guitar. So, it's like, I only have to buy the game, and no fucking peripheral this time.

01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:07.300
Unlike Rock Band, where I'm going to have to buy the Uber box, where nobody's going to want to come over and play with me.

01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:08.300
No, they're not.

01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:14.300
Yeah, I'm actually getting Drum Mania instead of Rock Band.

01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:17.300
Are you importing the one from Japan?

01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:18.300
Yeah.

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:19.300
That's hardcore.

01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:25.300
But I don't have the money to get the arcade-style DTX drum set, so I'm just getting the Konami controller.

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:30.300
Well, there you go. That'll do, as long as it gets you through the game. That's all that's important.

01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:35.300
All right, well, it sounds like you have a very busy gaming next couple of months between Orange Box and Drum Mania.

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:39.300
You're going to be very busy. Any other last-minute thoughts for our listeners?

01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:41.300
Uh, no.

01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:44.300
All right. Well, Puface, thank you very much for the call. Have a wonderful week.

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:45.300
All right.

01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:46.300
Hope to hear from you again.

01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:47.300
Yeah.

01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:48.300
All right. Bye-bye.

01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:53.300
Puface hasn't been listening for a little while. He just returned tonight for our 250th episode, so happy to hear from him.

01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:57.300
I'd like to remind everybody that I had the Orange Box last year.

01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:58.300
Hm?

01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:01.300
Yeah, I had the Orange Box last year. In fact, I still have it.

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:02.300
Oh.

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:03.300
I don't really use it too much, though.

01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:06.300
Isn't that what you called something of yours? I don't know. All right.

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:07.300
What?

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:08.300
Hello?

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:09.300
Hi.

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:10.300
It's Ravenstaufen.

01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:12.300
And Mr. Bucket.

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:13.300
Hello.

01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:19.300
We just want to wish you a happy 250th episode from the Tekken Game Podcast.

01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:20.300
Aww.

01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:25.300
That's so nice to hear from podcasts who are whooping our ass on Operator 11 rankings.

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:26.300
That's great.

01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:27.300
For sure.

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:31.300
I'm glad that you guys are thinking of the little people in your lives, like us.

01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:32.300
Little people?

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:33.300
You're bigger than us.

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:34.300
I'm glad to hear that we're not.

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:35.300
Yeah, you probably are.

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:36.300
It's all good.

01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:40.300
No, but seriously, you guys are like on the Operator 11 top of the charts. It's pretty rad.

01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:41.300
Not anymore.

01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:44.300
We were first, and now we're number 14. We're slightly getting back up there.

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:45.300
It's okay. We're like number 16.

01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:46.300
Yeah, we don't care, though.

01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:49.300
We're number 69, which is an okay place to be, honestly.

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:50.300
It's hilarious.

01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:51.300
It's a great place to be.

01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:52.300
It's a great place to be.

01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:53.300
That's an awesome place.

01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:54.300
Oh, yeah.

01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:55.300
Great for 69.

01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:56.300
That's my producer, Toki. She produces the show.

01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:57.300
Hello.

01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:58.300
Wow, there's a lot of you.

01:13:58.300 --> 01:13:59.300
Hi.

01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:00.300
Wait, do you all?

01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:01.300
Yeah.

01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:02.300
Oh, it's a girl. Hello.

01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:03.300
She's my co-host.

01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:04.300
All right.

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:08.300
God, what was I going to ask? I don't know.

01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:09.300
Is she hot?

01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:12.300
Rice Princess wants to know if she's hot.

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:13.300
Why are you...

01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:14.300
I think so.

01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:15.300
All right.

01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:19.300
Yeah, Raven and her, they've been together for like six months now.

01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:20.300
Is there a little showmance going?

01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:21.300
I think the bucket's serious.

01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:23.300
Is there a showmance going on on Tekken Games?

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:25.300
No, no, no, no. Not at all.

01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:27.300
Okay, it's all a publicity stunt.

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:28.300
I can hear her in the background going,

01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:29.300
What are you guys doing?

01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:30.300
What are you guys doing?

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:31.300
I'm not your publicity stunt.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:35.300
Oh, we tried to fake it like you guys had a child or something that was like illegitimate.

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:36.300
We never did.

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:37.300
All right.

01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:39.300
Sorry, we did call in for something, Sky.

01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:40.300
All right, what's up?

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:41.300
We want to talk about the Orange Box.

01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:43.300
Ah, it's all the rage this week.

01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:44.300
Tell us about...

01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:49.300
You know, it would make sense that people think the Orange Lounge show is about the Orange Box, so we forgive the confusion.

01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:50.300
Orange Box radio.

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:52.300
Tell us about the Orange Box.

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:53.300
Did you see the commercial?

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:56.300
You should call our show next week, Orange Box Radio.

01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:57.300
Just to fuck with people.

01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:58.300
That's stupid.

01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.300
It is stupid. All right, what do you want to say about Orange Box?

01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:01.300
Did you see the commercial?

01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:03.300
The commercial for the Orange Box?

01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:04.300
Yes, I did.

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:06.300
It was during the Sarah Silverman program.

01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:07.300
I saw the commercial for the Orange Box.

01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:09.300
Did you hear what they said about Half-Life?

01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:11.300
Oh, God, you were watching that.

01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:12.300
No, what did...or what?

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.300
Like Game of the Year or something?

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.300
Yeah, greatest game ever.

01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:18.300
Greater than Zelda, greater than anything.

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:19.300
Greatest game ever.

01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:27.300
I loved it that they said, this is the game of the year in 2002.

01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:30.300
Well, I mean, like, come on, when they sell movies, like when they do...

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:31.300
That is us.

01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:38.300
When they do, like, DVDs, like, you know, they're going to release Unforgiven Special Edition on HD DVD.

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:43.300
This was the best movie of the year in 1994, you know?

01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:45.300
Yeah, that commercial pisses me off.

01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:50.300
It's like, greatest game of all time, greater than Legend of Zelda, the Ocarina of Time.

01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:51.300
You know what, I forgive them.

01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:53.300
Do they actually say that in the commercial?

01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:54.300
I forgive them.

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:55.300
They should.

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:56.300
That's hilarious.

01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:57.300
Yeah, they actually said, greatest game of all time.

01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:58.300
That's hilarious.

01:15:58.300 --> 01:15:59.300
You know why I forgive them?

01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:04.300
Because when we try to sell our show to other people, like, you know, why they should come on our show and why we're a cool show,

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:09.300
we always say, hey, we're the podcast award-winning podcast in 2005.

01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:11.300
Yeah.

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:15.300
All I can do is say, hey, our podcast is award-winning.

01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:16.300
Exactly.

01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:17.300
We've won awards.

01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:19.300
We've got, like, two thumbs up from some guy on podcast.

01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:23.300
We go like, hey, we're a four-time nominee for Best of Life 365 in 2003.

01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:24.300
Yeah, look at the iTunes store.

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:26.300
We've got some good reviews, man.

01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:27.300
None of that pew-pew-pew shit.

01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:28.300
We've got some good reviews.

01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:30.300
Yeah, it's that creator, Scott.

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:32.300
We don't get no mew-mew-mews.

01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:34.300
We've got some, like, good stuff, people saying we're the greatest.

01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:38.300
I mean, you should get on here so people can hear you and you've got awards.

01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:39.300
All right.

01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:40.300
Well, guys, we've got to let you go.

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:42.300
We've got to wrap up the show because, damn, we've been going a long time.

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:43.300
It's okay.

01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:44.300
Thank you for letting us get on.

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:45.300
You're welcome.

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:46.300
Have a good one, you guys.

01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:47.300
You, too.

01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:48.300
Bye.

01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:49.300
Bye.

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:50.300
backwards completely lives.

01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:51.300
Bye, producer.

01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:52.300
Have a good one.

01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:53.300
Bye.

01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:54.300
Bye.

01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:55.300
They hung up on us.

01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:56.300
See you later.

01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:57.300
All right.

01:16:57.300 --> 01:16:58.300
That's it.

01:16:58.300 --> 01:16:59.300
We're going to close up the Skype line.

01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:01.300
Thank you guys very much for calling in tonight.

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:02.300
It was fun.

01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:05.300
But now we need to wrap up the show because we've been going a long time tonight.

01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:06.300
First, any last-minute stories?

01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:07.300
Yes.

01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:08.300
All right.

01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:09.300
Okay.

01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:11.300
Let's get real small here.

01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:17.020
The Simple Series, one of my favorite things to talk about from D3, is coming to the Wii.

01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:19.460
I have the first few titles.

01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:21.740
These are all, of course, coming to Japan.

01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:30.500
The first one is the Mina de Cart Race.

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:31.500
Everybody Cart Race.

01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:32.500
Yes.

01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:33.500
Everybody Cart Race.

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.500
It's slated for October 25th.

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:44.620
They also have Mina de Basuri Taikai, or the Everybody's Fishing Conference, also coming

01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:48.340
out on the 25th.

01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:50.820
The Party Casino, coming in December.

01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:55.940
The Shooting Action, coming in December.

01:17:55.940 --> 01:18:02.460
The Block Kuzushi, or the Block Destructions, coming out February next year.

01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:09.100
And the YY Combat, which I have no translation for, also coming in February.

01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:14.460
And I guess the Onichan Bara R is supposed to be coming out to the Wii, and that's that

01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:16.660
one for those who don't remember.

01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:23.260
It's the Sexy Zombie Killer Game, which is basically the chick wearing just brown panties

01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:27.220
and a cowboy hat with a samurai sword killing zombies.

01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:28.220
What more would you like?

01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:29.220
I mean, seriously.

01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:35.980
I don't know, it's not the fishing conference game, I don't know, I'm going to be busy playing

01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:36.980
that.

01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:41.460
Anyways, other things in the room middle here on the Wii, and this is probably just going

01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:46.700
to happen at some point, Nintendo's supposedly working on a game that's going to support

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:50.460
the Wii Balance Board that's going to be a snowboarding title, and rumors are that it's

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:55.300
going to be the 1080 game coming back, so maybe?

01:18:55.300 --> 01:19:00.420
I mean, I'm assuming someday there'll be a snowboarding game that'll support that.

01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:06.380
And then finally, one piece of Wii accessories that will not be coming out to the market

01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:10.100
will be the Nyko Wii Party Station.

01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:13.900
If you remember, that's that stupid thing that they had to hold controllers, chips and

01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:16.260
soda and all sorts of stuff like that.

01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:21.680
Apparently, originally they were marketing that as $25, but it ended up having to come

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:28.420
out for the price of $50, and so no one decided to buy it.

01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:33.420
Oh, and by the way, I also had LED scoreboards for your Wii tournaments.

01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:35.740
I mean, seriously.

01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:38.260
Whatever happened to the Wii-like thing that would hold the beer?

01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:40.620
Oh, is that the same thing?

01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:41.620
Oh, okay.

01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:42.620
Yeah.

01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:45.900
So, it's not coming out anymore, because apparently it's too expensive to make.

01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:46.900
What?

01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:47.900
What?

01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:48.900
What?

01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:49.900
What?

01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:50.900
That is it.

01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:51.900
Okay.

01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:52.900
Dark Sakura, you have anything?

01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:55.340
No, I have nothing.

01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:56.340
Me neither.

01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:57.340
All right.

01:19:57.340 --> 01:19:58.340
Nothing.

01:19:58.340 --> 01:19:59.340
Nothing to say.

01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:03.260
Well, that is going to bring our 250th episode to a close, and that deserves applause.

01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:04.740
Thank God it's over.

01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:05.940
All right.

01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:09.620
But first, we have to get everybody's final thought, so we'll start off with Dark Sakura.

01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:12.020
Your final thought tonight?

01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:13.780
I like beer.

01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:14.780
Do you now?

01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:15.780
Is there any particular type of beer?

01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:16.780
I like Newcastle.

01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:17.780
All right.

01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:19.900
We'll go around in a circle here.

01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:21.540
Casper the Gay, your final thought tonight?

01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:22.820
Thanks for being here, by the way.

01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:26.300
When you play video games, children do learn.

01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:27.300
What?

01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:29.300
Nobody got that.

01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:30.820
All righty.

01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:34.420
Rice Princess, your final thought?

01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:35.660
Bye.

01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:39.180
Loki, your final thought?

01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:44.260
And just when you thought Sony was done with releasing new secues, there is another rumor

01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:46.100
coming out of Japan.

01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:49.340
About a 160 gigabyte ES3 system.

01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:50.340
Oh, yes.

01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:55.480
This will come with 160 gigabytes of memory on your hard drive there.

01:20:55.480 --> 01:21:02.320
It will also feature six USB ports, two HDMI outs, and the three Ethernet ports, much like

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.980
the original design that they showed.

01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:11.340
And actually, they have a brand new skew that's been logged in, and it will do your dishes

01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:12.340
and suck your dick.

01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:15.420
In related news, Japanese men everywhere are marrying their PlayStations.

01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:19.620
Why the fuck does it need three fucking Ethernet ports, is what I want to know.

01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:23.220
Seriously, what the fuck do you need that many Ethernet ports for?

01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:26.340
I don't get it.

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:28.900
Nobody understands that.

01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:29.900
Wow.

01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:30.900
All right.

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:31.900
Is that it, Loki?

01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:32.900
That's it.

01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:38.940
And I'm sure, as with all other Sony rumors, it will probably become true soon enough.

01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:40.340
All right.

01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:41.740
Puppy, your final thought?

01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:42.740
Thank you for being here tonight.

01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:43.740
My final thought?

01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:44.740
Yes.

01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:45.740
Believe.

01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:48.340
All right.

01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:49.340
My final thought?

01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:51.260
Master Chief will save us.

01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:56.260
My final thought is 250 episodes later, and you know what?

01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:59.340
George Takei is still awesome.

01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:01.580
He is still fucking awesome.

01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:02.580
Oh my.

01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:04.100
All right.

01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:06.300
That's going to do it for another week of Orange Launch Radio.

01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:10.060
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.

01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:12.580
If you like what you hear, remember we do this shit for free.

01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:14.660
All we ask is for a little word of mouth.

01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:15.660
Just go advertise.

01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:16.740
Tell two people about our show.

01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:21.140
If you have no friends, or even if you do have friends, leave a comment on the iTunes.

01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:22.420
Are you Ron Popeil now?

01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:23.420
Am I Ron Popeil?

01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:24.420
Yeah.

01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:26.580
For only three low payments of $39.90.

01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:27.580
No.

01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:28.580
No.

01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:31.340
Three low payments of $14.95.

01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:32.660
Forget it.

01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:33.660
Word of mouth.

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:37.100
What was it that Mitch Hedberg said?

01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:39.580
Three easy payments and one difficult payment?

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:40.580
Yes.

01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:44.900
No, I think that was actually, it was the other, no, it was the guy who...

01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:45.900
That was Mitch Hedberg.

01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:46.900
Mitch Hedberg.

01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:47.900
I just listened to this on Friday at work.

01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:48.900
That was good.

01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:49.900
Sorry.

01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:50.900
I thought you said Dane Cook for some reason.

01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:54.180
No, Dane Cook would have just made obnoxious noises and then talked about his penis.

01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:55.180
Yeah.

01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:56.180
No.

01:22:56.180 --> 01:23:01.220
The thing was I somehow got my list of comedians who died mixed with comedians I wish would

01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:02.580
die.

01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:03.580
Just kidding.

01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:04.580
I don't wish death on anyone.

01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:05.580
That's really mean.

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:06.580
I love Dane Cook.

01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:07.580
No, I don't.

01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:08.580
All right.

01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:10.260
Anyway, can we end the show now please?

01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:11.260
Thank you.

01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:12.260
All right.

01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:13.260
Bye-bye.

01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:14.260
