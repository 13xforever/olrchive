13919	23958	Tonight, October 7th, 2007, Bungie and Microsoft file for divorce, World of Warcraft celebrates alcohol, and Nintendo gives something away to all Wii owners.
31741	35843	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35883	41667	We are that program on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42287	44228	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
44288	47550	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
47810	49351	I'm starting Oktoberfest early.
50071	50392	Are you?
50672	52213	Yes I am, with British ale.
52233	52613	Enjoy.
52633	53893	What are you drinking tonight?
54014	54454	Newcastle.
54914	55394	Yummy.
55474	55995	Best ever.
56315	58216	Also joining us tonight, say hello to Loki.
59554	62775	I'm drinking watered down coke from McDonald's.
63515	64936	You sure know how to party.
65436	67297	I'm very disappointed in your German-ness.
67317	68537	Their fries sucked.
69958	76320	And also say hello, joining us tonight, this somebody has not been on our program in a damn long time, but he's here tonight.
76380	78761	Say hello to Black Lab, a.k.a.
78781	79021	Puppy.
79582	82124	I made it out of Davis alive, thank God.
82304	89448	Yes, you used to be our correspondent for the People's Republic of Davis, which if you live where our show is taped, Sacramento, you understand why that joke is funny.
89768	92991	But if you're an international or national listener, you have no clue what we're talking about.
93031	94231	But just trust us, it's funny.
94672	96653	But you're free from the perils of Davis now.
96733	97273	Yes, I am.
97393	98214	And you're living on your own.
98754	99395	Yes, actually.
99415	100936	They've let you out of the prisoner camp.
101096	104798	So rule number one of living on your own, make sure the mic is real close to your mouth because you're not very sensitive.
105078	105318	Okay.
105538	106299	Just don't eat it.
107111	109152	So what have you been up to since you've been on the show last?
111313	112253	How long has it been?
112733	114034	It's been like at least a year now.
114054	114994	Aren't we in double digits?
115635	116835	I think so, first time he was here.
117215	122738	Well, Puppy, you used to work in an arcade, and that's one thing you used to kind of come on the show and talk to us about.
123058	124938	What arcade did you used to work at a long time ago?
125018	126319	Castro Valley Golf Land.
126539	130321	And what kinds of big popular machines were there at Castro Valley Golf Land?
130741	131061	Oh, I think
132023	133865	One of them dancing machines, I think.
134185	135026	Oh, the dance game?
135046	136147	Oh, they had Time Crisis 3.
136187	137348	That was pretty popular.
137408	138889	That all the dancing fools played?
139450	139890	Yeah.
140090	140511	Yeah.
140671	141551	I think I was one of them.
141872	142172	All right.
143793	148658	So would you say that the skills that you learned working in an arcade have helped you in the real world?
150099	150319	No.
150760	150980	No.
151520	152861	You didn't learn anything there, huh?
153342	154383	Not a damn thing.
154863	155844	Except that I hate kids.
156224	157786	It was one step above flipping burgers, yes?
157826	157966	Yes.
159915	163238	I still had to serve pizza on weekends for parties.
164038	168262	Or in retrospect, would you rather have been frying french fries incorrectly at McDonald's?
170264	174928	I would know how to fry something at McDonald's because I would actually understand the instructional videos.
177129	183535	There was one time that people got pissed off at McDonald's because I was sitting in the middle of the lobby with a chair that I pulled out from a table.
184957	198349	and sitting there talking because my friends are all talking and just sitting there and talking or basically standing there and talking and I got tired to stand there so I pulled over a chair and sat down next to everybody and then the manager comes over and he's like what the fuck is that chair doing in the middle of this lobby?
198850	202413	Meanwhile, I mean, it's like they're like almost closed anyways and there's no one there.
202433	203414	Is that how they really talk?
203454	204415	What a bunch of potty mouths.
205035	206517	Well, he was a stoner so...
207719	209821	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
235069	237170	Hey, we're going to pizza your face.
238051	238351	I don't know.
238671	240012	I got to operate a large knife.
240993	243995	Really, no, I didn't go around going, hey, we're part of the Roundtable gang.
244035	245295	No, we worked at Roundtable.
246576	248397	We're a commune of Roundtable people.
249278	254541	Well, folks, you'll notice there's two empty chairs back here if you're watching on our Operator 11 live webcam or our archive.
254821	255942	There's two empty chairs back here.
255982	262026	That's because Rice Princess and Casper the Gay or whatever his name is are joining us tonight, but they're late.
262697	263579	Target, Target, Target
273665	276686	I don't need a table because there would be no room for a table in here.
276706	277186	Thanks for the beer.
277206	278007	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio.
278047	278407	No, not that.
278427	279127	That'll have to be an edit.
302945	303245	DarkSakura
328914	332535	I'm gonna go sit in the chairs, because I feel bad that the Op 11 people are looking at nothing.
332595	333256	So I'll sit in the chairs.
333276	334236	I'm looking at my laptop, apparently.
334536	334776	Alright.
336077	339218	So, this week, I played a shit ton of Ragnarok.
340118	343520	And I'm not talking about my regular, you know, buttload.
343660	345380	I'm talking about a shit ton of Ragnarok.
345400	347481	So it's like a shit ton, is that like metric?
348301	349002	It's metric.
350122	355084	Or if I was going to go with the Don French description, it would be crock shits of Ragnarok.
355704	357425	Or like shit kilo, you know.
358863	362325	So, um, I have been, I decided to start a new class.
362985	364006	I started it last night.
364086	365586	It's called the Taekwon Girl.
366707	369808	And, um, you don't get weapons, you just kick things in the face.
371309	372570	You just kick them in the face.
372710	374050	Can we get a live demonstration?
374110	374971	Puppy, lie down.
375171	375371	No.
375411	378252	I don't think so.
379313	382655	And then I, um, I started the character last night, and I'm playing today.
382995	387557	Got her up to a Star Gladiator, which was actually kind of a really weird game earlier.
388559	394544	So I now have her at level 70, and I started her yesterday.
395745	396425	Last night.
396806	398147	Go Pirate Servers!
398347	398887	Awesome job.
400208	403011	And I don't have to work tomorrow, so I'm going to play more games tomorrow.
403251	403731	Good job.
404552	405192	Well, sounds good.
405633	407334	Well, let's keep right on moving along.
407374	408395	Loki, how was your gaming week?
408871	410031	My gaming week was fun.
410551	413252	I've been continuing playing Halo on Legendary.
413692	420934	Finally got past the part that I was stuck because I realized, hey, I can go backtrack and there's a ton of weapons back there.
421194	422974	Holy shit, forgot all about that stuff.
423334	425975	And so you can play with the AI because they won't go past a certain part.
425995	431076	They'll chase after you and stuff and be like, ha, I'm in the safe zone or some shit.
431136	433336	You can't attack me and they'll run back.
433816	434196	It's funny.
434236	435657	The AI is kind of dumb.
436037	437517	Have you done the confetti head thing?
438067	441429	No, I'm playing through just by myself.
442330	446812	DarkSakura's husband showed me the headshot confetti thing.
446852	447893	That is hilarious.
448473	455137	It makes, like, you shoot off the thing and it makes this little, I think we have the exact same noise in our audio library.
455477	458159	It has these little kids cheering when you do it.
458911	459971	I'm looking for the... Keep going.
460071	461492	I'll imitate them anyways.
462052	464632	So, other stuff I've been playing.
464752	467173	I actually bought... What was it?
467253	468473	Flat Out Ultimate Carnage.
468893	470133	That game is fucking awesome.
470613	473394	It's just lots of driving, crashing into things.
473794	483436	I played the Ragdoll Olympics stuff for quite a while, so I was launching my character through windshields and flinging them down a ski slope.
484236	484736	Stuff like that.
485637	486437	Real fun game, though.
486917	487017	And...
488331	489011	Food Network is great.
516684	517704	And how is Halo going?
517724	518744	You a big fan of the Halo?
546049	547591	Yeah, I am, sadly.
549912	554656	I'm still confused by some things in the plot, and other than that, I just shoot things.
555677	557539	And I like the little grunt head explosions.
558499	559840	Yes, I found the sound effect.
559860	561121	So when you shoot them in the head, you get this.
562322	563423	It makes that little sound effect.
563623	566005	A little confetti blows up everywhere.
566065	566686	It's awesome.
566866	572991	It's fun when you turn up the explosions on that, too, so that when you shoot one in the head, all the ones around them go off, too, and explode.
573464	575745	Dan was going around punching people in the head with a skull.
577547	577807	Good times.
577827	578607	That was pretty cool.
578627	578907	Good times.
579808	580789	So that's it for your gaming week?
581529	582109	Yeah, pretty much.
582210	586632	I was playing WoW for a while, but ever since Halo 3 came out, I pretty much stopped.
587093	587373	All right.
587773	593236	Well, finally joining us, they're a little bit late tonight, so you guys are so fired, but they're here in studio.
593297	596559	Say hello to Rice Princess, and what are we calling you now, Casper?
596759	597859	Casper the Game.
597879	598860	All right, I can never remember.
599721	600441	He's Eddie to me.
600481	601181	He'll always be Eddie.
601502	601842	All right.
602835	604076	So Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?
604096	604737	What have you been playing?
606078	606618	Wow.
607839	609260	Does it ever change, really?
609280	612082	I mean, that's pretty much it.
612262	613363	Hey, you have my sweater.
613423	614044	I'm so glad.
614484	615565	Yes, you left your sweater here.
615845	617726	My Alliance sweater.
617806	625152	What's hilarious is that the only way we knew who it belonged to is that we saw that it was an Alliance sweatshirt that you left here, and we were like, who the fuck plays Alliance?
625172	625252	Yeah.
626701	627582	Only cool people do.
627602	629283	And we were like, oh, it must be Rice Princess.
629403	631565	So please take this thing out of my house.
631645	633766	I have an Alliance character, at least she's sort of evil.
634027	636448	The only reason worth playing Alliance is for the J'nai.
636729	638530	But it gets old.
638770	639130	Whatever.
639411	640752	And if you want to play with 12-year-olds.
640912	641712	You can play a Warlock.
641772	643634	And if you want to play a cool side.
643654	644915	You can play Warlocks on Horde's side.
645075	645715	They're much cooler.
645855	646736	Warlocks are much better.
647617	648497	Warlocks are lame.
649078	649518	You're lame.
649618	654382	Anyway, before we turn into the WoWcast, is there anything else you want to share for your gaming week?
654989	655189	No.
655549	657990	Alright, then Casper, how was your gaming week?
658270	658811	It was awesome.
658891	661592	I got Phantom Hourglass, the new Zelda game for DS.
661632	662152	It was really good.
662552	663653	Yeah, it's really good.
664193	669415	Finally, they get to not make you fumble between the D-pad and the buttons and the stylus all at the same time.
669756	671436	It's all stylus and it's very smooth.
671476	672457	It's a very cool control style.
675242	677966	So tell me a little more about it, because I'm contemplating if I want to buy it or not.
678026	680569	So how does it play compared to the other Zeldas?
680609	682071	Is it more Wind Waker?
682131	683653	Is it more Super Nintendo Zelda?
683753	685355	Well, it's a direct sequel to Wind Waker.
685395	687117	It takes place right after the end of Wind Waker.
688298	689300	Same style.
689340	690121	It's like that cel shading.
690141	692243	A little downplayed for the DS, but it still looks pretty good.
692804	694206	And, you know, just really cool.
694326	696007	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
724850	725110	All right.
725410	728552	And GS68 in our chat room is screaming, no spoilers.
729052	729772	So please, no spoilers.
729813	731513	I'm not that far, so I really can't spoil anything.
731533	733274	No spoilers until Eris gets it.
733354	734675	So go ahead and spoil.
734695	735095	I don't care.
735796	736616	Link dies.
737376	738217	Yeah, Link dies at the end.
739710	740031	All right.
740872	741893	Anyhow, my gaming week.
742013	744657	I've also been playing World of Warcraft.
745078	747201	I got to level 68, so I have a flying mount now.
747561	749705	I am a flying mount because I play a druid.
749965	750526	Oh, you so?
750806	752649	Yeah, so I get a free flying mount.
752809	754271	Or if it's not free, it costs me eight gold.
754451	754692	Woo-hoo!
755292	756232	Anyhow.
756412	758233	And I ran instances.
759333	762074	As a guild, we ran under Bog and Slave pens.
763174	766755	And that's how I leveled.
768676	773917	I feel like this week's episode of the Sarah Silverman program, all of a sudden, where they're playing D&D for 24 hours straight.
773957	776398	I've done that.
776518	777638	You're the hardcore-est of the nerds.
779259	780359	You're queen of the nerd people.
781860	782640	She's just a princess.
782660	783020	You're the queen.
784342	784943	Uh, let's see.
785363	787864	So, also my gaming week, I played Tetris Splash.
788064	792146	I actually bought the new Tetris Splash, which was the Xbox Live Arcade game of the week.
792466	793667	And Tetris Splash is okay.
793747	799490	I mean, it's Tetris, and it has its competitive mode, which plays really smoothly on Xbox Live, I gotta say.
799990	803613	And it seems like the audience of people playing the game, not a lot of jerks, which is good.
803633	804413	You get some pretty good people.
804453	806134	And some people who are really skilled at Tetris.
806434	811157	I got my butt whooped in a ranked match by some people who are really good at Tetris, and I'm not so good at Tetris.
811177	811878	Tetris is fun.
811898	813499	They have that on DS, and it was like, it's crazy.
813539	814680	I'm like, Tetris, oh, but it's fun.
814960	822505	Here's why Tetris Splash pissed me off, though, is it just made the fact that I actually bought Tetris Evolution even more salt in the wound.
822845	825887	Because that game was like $30 on Xbox 360, and I never used this $10 version.
828172	829072	I'm so mad.
829253	830253	Like, why did they do that?
830313	830653	Why?
830873	833274	They didn't even wait, like, six months.
833414	840218	Tetris Evolution came out, like, three months ago, and now we have an even, a slightly, I don't know if you'd say better version.
840718	842218	I think it is kind of a better version.
842239	843339	It doesn't have the HD videos.
843359	844580	It has that stupid aquarium.
844940	847461	It looks like a, it looks like a screensaver from After Dark.
848721	853824	But, here's the thing that pissed me off about that is, have you heard about the microtransactions with this?
854284	854564	No.
854704	856225	The day they released Tetris,
858047	865970	The day they released Tetris Splash on Xbox Live Arcade, they released 15 different download packs for Tetris Splash.
866990	867810	No, maybe it's like 11.
868070	868650	But it's more than 10.
869651	874612	Between 80 and 150 points per download.
874652	875793	And you know what these things are?
876793	879294	They're just new fish for your tank.
880234	882355	Or new tanks to put the fish in.
883015	886276	Now let me ask you, do you play Tetris to stare at the background?
887199	887439	No.
887779	892742	So what's the point of downloading fish and fish tanks?
893042	895203	Then don't buy it.
895403	896924	There's a sucker born every second.
897124	897584	How about this?
897784	904587	It's either that or they could have made the game more expensive and threw them in there for free, which I think would have been a better move to make the money.
904667	906128	I think a better move would have been...
906728	913513	What they were starting to do, which is you unlock more fish as you unlock more achievements, or you get lines in the game.
913553	915334	You and your logic and your critical thinking.
915774	918616	I mean, I could not believe that.
919016	921298	If you buy this stuff, you're a sucker.
921738	923119	You're an absolute sucker.
923819	927101	If you buy this stuff, I got some Guitar Hero download packs for you.
930916	932717	I love Tetris, which is why this makes me mad.
932957	939822	I feel like Tetris on the 360 is fucked beyond belief between this whole evolution and now microtransaction fish tank thing.
940003	942264	By the way, Rob, I hate the word microtransaction.
943065	943725	Well, that's what it is.
943745	946027	A transaction is a transaction no matter how big or small.
946147	948049	Well, that's what they call it.
948069	950831	Why don't you write a letter to EA and all those people?
950851	954734	I have the same problem with pre-boarding because you're not really pre-boarding, you're just boarding.
957156	957436	Early.
958120	959540	Why you gotta derail my segment, huh?
959781	963222	Well, technically, a microtransaction is an accurate description.
963302	966443	It's a transaction that is small, hence micro.
966463	970104	So if I were a Jolly Rancher for five cents, would that be a microtransaction?
970684	972705	Yes, it would be a microtransaction.
972785	973305	That would.
973565	975046	What defines micro or macro?
975066	978267	This is a suck transaction, because if you buy this, you suck.
978347	980588	If I buy a computer, is it a microtransaction?
980628	982288	If you support this, you suck.
982408	984809	A microtransaction would be, for example...
985189	986150	Let's say Oblivion.
986210	989291	When you buy the retail copy of Oblivion, that would be a macro transaction.
989311	995455	When you buy add-on content that is cheaper than the purchase of the game, that is a micro transaction.
995475	997796	See, I would think that buying the system would be the macro transaction.
997816	999057	I cannot believe we're having an argument.
999077	1001939	Buying the game would be a neutral transaction.
1002039	1002859	Round two.
1005100	1006161	Fight!
1006181	1008823	This is the semantics webcast.
1011024	1014706	GS68 in our chatroom says, Buying a PS3 equals a macro transaction.
1016834	1017435	Suck Transaction
1025936	1027777	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1047779	1049080	I don't know, that's too much ego.
1049160	1057126	Like, once a year is acceptable, and we did that with our five-year anniversary show, but if we were to kind of, like, promote, hey, it's episode 250, everybody should congratulate us again.
1057166	1061949	That's like celebrating your anniversaries with your spouse or something every month or something.
1061989	1063710	It's like, our 13-month anniversary!
1063810	1064491	Yeah, awesome.
1065271	1066152	Exactly, that's what it is.
1066472	1068333	After a while, it's just like, eh, whatever.
1069314	1071796	So, yeah, this is just an eh, whatever episode of Orange Laundry.
1072620	1074441	But we do have some special stuff tonight.
1074802	1078764	We actually have Insanist is one of our correspondents in Seattle.
1079185	1082947	He's actually, since he lives in Seattle, he's at the World Cyber Games this weekend.
1082987	1085709	And he actually called us a little earlier today to say this.
1086950	1087971	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio.
1087991	1093435	This is Insanist reporting live from Seattle, Washington here Sunday, October 7th, 2007.
1094796	1100440	I'm calling to let you know that you missed out on some extraordinary goings on here at the World Cyber Games.
1100950	1103411	For those of you not familiar, the Olympics of video games.
1104252	1114816	There were people from 74 countries, 700 gamers playing 12 different games, ranging from Command & Conquer 3 all the way to a huge favorite, StarCraft.
1116897	1121420	Lots of huge upsets, which my partner in crime, DJ Tyrant, will get to you later about.
1123380	1127582	I'm telling you that this is something you don't ever want to miss.
1127622	1128663	It's one of a kind event
1129645	1134709	meeting people from all sorts of countries at the press event, at press tournaments, everything.
1136070	1150041	I actually, probably the funniest thing, any sort of tournament or competition I tried to enter, I lost to somebody from another country every single time.
1151502	1158868	But just being able to take in all the cultural aspects, but just being here as one, all as gamers, just having a good time,
1159577	1160037	was great.
1161498	1175228	Seeing people play rock bands from different countries, and yes, I did hear somebody from China try to sing Black Hole Sun, and it was kind of funny, but that's very mean, but it was a great, great event.
1176249	1182414	The next one is in Cologne, Germany, so any new European listeners that aren't on the radio, I recommend you take the trip out and go.
1183274	1186296	DJ Tyrant and I are actually thinking about going, so maybe we'll see you there.
1187417	1188438	But more
1189418	1191942	Excuse me, I'm walking about downtown Seattle as I do this.
1192723	1194886	But for Orange Lounge Radio, I'm Insanus.
1195267	1202638	To hear more about this, listen to our show, The Insanus Hour, featuring SPFU, every Thursday at 7.30 Pacific Time.
1203359	1204801	Until then, I'm Insanus.
1204921	1205242	Take care.
1206752	1210113	Thank you very much, Insanus, for your little report there from the World Cyber Games.
1210133	1211034	He was raving about it.
1211214	1214135	He was calling me literally every day about something that was going on.
1214435	1215256	He called me the other day.
1215276	1221258	He was like, hey, Rob, I got to play one of the other all-game shows in some press competition, and I beat them.
1221739	1222419	And I was like, go.
1222439	1224340	You sound like you're having a lot of fun.
1224360	1228662	Hopefully one of those games is Chromehounds because I stole that in my copy.
1228722	1230302	I think it was Madden.
1230362	1233184	I don't think he was actually playing all-games interactive.
1233204	1234344	I think he was playing one of the other shows there.
1234364	1236045	I want to say it was Game Addict Hotline.
1236730	1243432	Really, the real losers of Chromehounds would be anyone that bought the game, unfortunately.
1244393	1249415	Now, Loki, if I heard you right during the tape segment there, you were dissing World Cyber Games a little bit.
1249455	1250115	What's your issue?
1250135	1251475	I think it's stupid.
1251555	1251875	Why?
1252096	1257257	It's cool that, I guess, a bunch of people come together, but don't refer to it as the fucking Olympics or anything like that.
1257317	1258778	I mean, seriously.
1260174	1265137	To me, the World Cyber Games kind of reminds me of the professional gaming leagues and shit like that.
1265238	1266138	I fucking hate those.
1266378	1266999	I really do.
1267059	1269060	That's like trying to launch the fucking XFL.
1269080	1270321	I mean, it's retarded.
1270781	1272663	No one's going to want to watch you play games.
1272683	1273123	That's funny.
1273143	1274304	Don't broadcast it.
1274724	1275425	It's boring.
1275505	1276786	The XFL was actually kind of fun.
1278148	1278749	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1299625	1301206	It was the most boring thing to watch.
1301226	1302627	Well, the problem was the way they put it together.
1302667	1307190	They picked up kids off the street and tried to make it all rad.
1307310	1325081	Well, the problem is, if they're going to do something like this, they need to design games that are meant for this type of gameplay or anything like that, like Unreal Tournament or something, where you could actually set it up, film it like you're doing an actual football or sporting event type of game.
1326102	1326282	Just...
1327059	1328420	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1346175	1347537	If you watch it on TV, you can turn it off.
1361546	1366468	It doesn't take much to go, you know, ooh, look at me, I'm fast at the reflexes, you know, who cares?
1366568	1368869	I mean, it doesn't take much to really build yourself up.
1368889	1371871	I know a lot of people that are fascinated with watching people play video games.
1371891	1373671	We've all got that friend that's like, hey, you want to play?
1373751	1374592	No, I'll just watch.
1374792	1375952	You know, it's like, okay.
1375972	1377513	And they're like having a good time watching you.
1377993	1380254	Like Rice Princess, she's always like, I'm going to watch you.
1380654	1381495	Spoilers.
1382115	1382975	That's like my roommate.
1383055	1386597	He doesn't really play video games, but he's always kind of like, hey, aren't you going to play Eternal Sonata again?
1388137	1389338	Like, I kind of want to know what happens.
1390515	1391717	Why'd you quit at Chapter 5?
1393139	1394822	I like doing cooperative gaming.
1395022	1398549	Not like where both of you are actually playing the game, but like what Dan and I used to do.
1399130	1399590	Where, um...
1400237	1406961	He would, like, when we played Resident Evil, he would play through the game and I would go off the strategy guide or tell him where to go.
1406981	1407421	Aw, bonding time.
1407441	1409022	Yeah, but see, that's all storyline stuff.
1409042	1411704	You want to know what happens in the storyline and stuff like that.
1412024	1415807	That's a little different than saying, oh, I want to watch it because you're so lead at fucking Halo.
1416147	1416547	You know what I mean?
1416847	1418788	I don't, that's a little different.
1418868	1423011	It's not like... I was watching Halo for the storyline, but then it stopped making sense.
1423591	1424952	I mean, seriously, it's different.
1424972	1426113	Is there even a storyline?
1426173	1426393	Yeah.
1426873	1430514	You're tuning in for, like, the story and not for the actual gameplay.
1430534	1439476	Like, I don't know why Halo 3 bothered with the story, for real, because, like, I was playing co-op mode the other day, and, like, you know, we're walking through and what have you, and we're shooting aliens, we're having a fun time.
1439496	1441256	I'll tell you what, Halo 3 co-op mode is awesome.
1441516	1444957	We're going through, and then suddenly Cortana's like, find me, you gotta find me.
1445017	1446597	I'm like, bitch, get off the screen!
1446737	1447698	I'm trying to kill things!
1449418	1453422	Wow, you got like so straight for a second there, that was like scary.
1453502	1460087	And here's the funny thing about that, Rob, since I haven't played any of the other games, I don't understand the significance of finding her in the first place.
1460107	1463210	I'm like, it's just a fucking computer, just let it go, come on, seriously.
1463230	1464251	I thought she got exploded.
1465011	1466953	By a new chick, I mean, seriously.
1468815	1469135	I don't know.
1469471	1473472	See, I lost a little something for not playing the other games, but I digress.
1473672	1475013	Alright, so anyway, wow.
1475873	1481335	Really quickly though, people, what about the calls where people are like, I want to see DDR in the Olympics?
1481615	1481955	No!
1482035	1483836	You are stupid!
1483916	1484496	Hold on, hold on.
1484956	1488597	What about this as an outlet for those people that want to see that?
1488657	1496599	I mean, there are people that want to do gaming as a competitive sport, and people that feel that, you know, why should gaming be any different from other sports that are outdoors?
1496779	1497219	You know what?
1497319	1501380	If you want to have gaming as a competitive sport, just do PvP mode on Ragnarok.
1501960	1502501	End of story.
1505121	1505981	Congratulations, everybody.
1506021	1508142	DarkSakura has leveled down the show.
1508202	1508682	Good job.
1510302	1510843	Hard times.
1514636	1514836	Yes.
1515816	1516557	Oh, I got the finger.
1516837	1519319	Why don't you put that finger up so the Op-11 people can see it on the cam.
1519339	1519639	There you go.
1520159	1520419	All right.
1522060	1524462	Going to the chat room, because, God, we haven't been paying attention to chat.
1524502	1525202	I'm so sorry, folks.
1525643	1526823	Chat.orangeandredo.com.
1528625	1529785	Macman baby kicker.
1530026	1530286	I don't know.
1530326	1532887	Why would you kick babies?
1533027	1533728	Okay, Shane.
1533748	1534929	Why?
1534969	1540632	Macman says Cortana is significantly less hot in Halo 3, so therefore she doesn't deserve to be saved, apparently.
1540652	1541853	She wasn't hot in the first Halo.
1541873	1542834	It's not real!
1542854	1542894	No!
1544366	1546828	DDRDollarBill says, no DDR in the Olympics.
1546988	1547648	I found that ironic.
1547708	1553492	If she was a real chick or something, it might make more sense that you're trying to save her, but she's a fucking computer program.
1553673	1554833	Make a copy!
1557455	1558816	Hey, don't copy that floppy.
1559617	1562939	Tigerclaw says, video games are becoming a spectator sport.
1564500	1568583	SonofDad says, didn't they broadcast some of the fighting game championships recently in Japan?
1569617	1570197	See, that's Japan.
1570217	1571617	They put weird shit on their TV.
1571697	1572678	And you know what, though?
1572718	1575478	I respect them for that, because there's some cool shit on there.
1576738	1583159	If only they'd fucking fill G4 full of all that cool shit in Japan, I might be willing to watch that channel.
1584220	1585440	They try, but they fail.
1585460	1588060	Anyways, so, yeah, I mean, okay.
1588200	1589300	DarkShy brings up a good point.
1589420	1589800	Yes, please.
1589820	1590741	I've seen King of Kong.
1590801	1591421	It's very interesting.
1591941	1595501	Yeah, DarkShy says they had a movie called King of Kong, by the way.
1595821	1596602	Yeah.
1597342	1598222	Well, it was about the...
1599349	1600150	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1611838	1613239	and it was this big drama.
1613520	1616282	Actually, I would suggest to everybody watch through King of Kong.
1616322	1619185	Well, see, now, that's a good example because people got really into that.
1619305	1625250	Now, I haven't seen the movie yet, but from what I've heard, people really get into it and are like rooting for one guy over the other guy.
1625550	1630615	You know, what about that for your whole argument where people don't want to... It's like Tommy.
1630995	1635219	Now, to E. Kim in the chat room, the DDR show did not count.
1635259	1637300	Hold on, you've got to read what they said before you respond to it.
1638851	1639491	Hello, Radio 101.
1640571	1642892	Ecom in the chat says, what did he say?
1642952	1643512	No, I lost it.
1643552	1643772	Oh, yes.
1643812	1646112	Do I need to remind you of that crap DDR show on TV?
1646152	1647873	To which you say, it doesn't count.
1648713	1649133	Why not?
1649633	1657034	Because at first it was called Dance Revolution, and all it was was just fucking Mickey Mouse Club ripoff with the slumber party girls.
1658214	1659015	Where are they now?
1659095	1659775	Oh, that's right.
1660175	1661455	No one's listening to them.
1662335	1662895	Aw, how sad.
1663275	1663855	So sad.
1663895	1665916	Yet another girl group gone.
1665956	1666176	Aw.
1666256	1666956	All right.
1667990	1670530	Anyhow, other housekeeping real quick.
1670570	1671131	I've got to say this.
1671191	1673651	Remember how last week we got a lot of phone calls on Digital Life?
1673791	1676391	I even had to hang up on one caller over drama and all that stuff.
1676411	1681132	Well, SSJ, Matt, one of our listeners, was kind enough to send us a care package from Digital Life.
1681472	1683453	So we got stuff from Digital Life.
1684273	1685753	Yeah, we have this little squeeze brain.
1685773	1687513	I have like 50 of those.
1687533	1689794	Well, then Eddie seemed to be interested in that.
1689814	1690334	So there you go, Eddie.
1691054	1691834	Let's see what we have here.
1691874	1696235	We have a seven-day free trial of Lord of the Rings Online.
1696775	1697175	You want that?
1697993	1698714	I don't have an Xbox.
1719119	1719920	I don't think it works.
1719940	1720661	I have my battery.
1721402	1722643	Non-working flashlight.
1722823	1723344	Hello.
1723684	1724005	Look at this.
1724185	1726828	All these V-Rares for DDR Universe.
1727008	1727549	I'll take one.
1727629	1729331	Wait, is that the original universe or second one?
1729511	1730472	No, it's the original universe.
1731033	1731714	DDR Universe.
1731734	1732475	I'll take one anyways.
1732535	1733996	I think I might have one, but I'd take one anyway.
1734016	1734377	Well, here you go.
1735282	1735642	And there you go.
1735662	1736523	This is exciting radio.
1736543	1736863	Look at this.
1737084	1739926	Party gift for us.
1740186	1742828	I was going to joke.
1743209	1743789	And here they are.
1744190	1747092	Now this I might keep and give away at some point because this is old.
1747132	1749994	This is a DDR Max sampler from Toys R Us.
1750034	1751776	I don't think they even make these anymore.
1752076	1753037	So we'll hang on to that.
1753057	1754278	Did you want a universe sampler, puppy?
1754478	1755179	All right, there you go.
1756220	1757821	Everybody wins here at Orange Launch Radio.
1758662	1759302	I got a brain.
1760203	1760523	Let's see.
1760563	1761384	What else do we have here?
1762413	1766195	Oh, Loki's gonna love this.
1766215	1768096	No, there's no money.
1768136	1768496	Look at this.
1768536	1769297	Here it is.
1769897	1772038	Authentic Eye of Judgment cards.
1772118	1772498	Look at this.
1772899	1777221	This is a card for the Biolith Bomber from the Eye of Judgment.
1777281	1778481	Check that shit out right there.
1778802	1780823	It even says right on the back, the Eye of Judgment.
1781623	1782143	Wait, wait, wait.
1782323	1782483	What?
1783084	1784605	I'm gonna make a copy of this.
1784625	1786125	Alright, you do that.
1786686	1787426	Oh my god!
1787666	1789947	That would be so impossible to copy.
1790087	1791068	Oh wait, no it won't be.
1793314	1798895	A little doggy keychain there from Sirius Satellite Radio.
1799115	1800036	A puppy should have that.
1800176	1800876	Yeah, it is a puppy.
1800996	1802316	So a puppy gets the puppy keychain.
1802456	1802776	There you go.
1803536	1804057	And let's see.
1805077	1807157	Oh, some post-it notes from Newegg.
1807877	1809178	Who wants post-it notes from Newegg?
1809258	1809898	DarkSakura does.
1809958	1810298	Posties.
1810318	1810638	There you go.
1811238	1811918	And, oh, I like this.
1811958	1812359	What is this?
1813299	1815899	This is a little, what is this, an iPod mini skin?
1818880	1819700	I don't know what this is.
1820260	1820820	I can't tell.
1821881	1822721	Is it an eraser?
1823467	1824628	What is it?
1825228	1826489	It looks like an eraser.
1826670	1827150	Okay.
1828071	1833335	And last but not least, last but not least, a lollipop with a ghost on it from Pac-Man.
1833355	1833815	There you go.
1834155	1835136	Oh, that's adorable.
1835176	1836577	Don't anybody eat that.
1836637	1837958	We'll just keep it forever and ever.
1838038	1839019	It's our new mascot.
1839179	1839539	There you go.
1839579	1840520	It is, totally.
1841501	1844463	Thank you, SSJ100Map, for the fabulous gifts and prizes.
1844483	1844783	Appreciate it.
1844803	1845384	Thank you.
1847526	1850488	There is no way that these things will not be able to, you know,
1853778	1863726	I think it's an advertisement for one other company that makes iPod skins called Jealous Skins but they didn't actually put a real one on there.
1864326	1872192	It's just a piece of plastic that looks like an iPod with a fake one around it and something on the back that says take this to the booth and get two for one or something.
1873594	1876856	Well somebody forgot to take it to the booth so we get it now here in studio.
1876996	1878638	Thank you for the prizes from Digital Life.
1878658	1879178	We appreciate it.
1879773	1881254	I think I'm going to peel this off.
1881794	1882094	All right.
1884355	1884695	What are you?
1885396	1886056	Oh, all right.
1886136	1886456	Anyway.
1888777	1890318	I guess that's it for housekeeping tonight.
1890959	1891319	Finally.
1891759	1894100	I think we're only about 35 minutes into tonight's show.
1894160	1896361	We can finally get into some gaming news.
1898222	1898662	All right.
1898742	1899723	We're starting with Ding.
1900470	1909936	Anyways, so there is some interesting rumors going around about a brand new Wii SKU and everyone's all like, oh my god, what is this?
1910036	1911396	It's DVD or something?
1911477	1912017	It's going to be playing?
1912317	1913198	No, don't get excited.
1913218	1914338	It's really nothing, actually.
1914879	1922343	The brand new UPC or new pack, as it's being dubbed, all it really is, and I've seen this happen on a few different consoles...
1923214	1925135	It's just them changing the box art.
1925275	1929356	Basically, you know, those launch games, they're a little old and dusty right now.
1929416	1932897	Time to put the new shit on there, you know, to get people excited.
1932997	1934417	That's all it is.
1934797	1935637	Ooh, box art!
1935677	1936678	Oh my god!
1936898	1942019	Because they did the exact same thing in September with the PS2 Slim.
1942959	1947721	They did the same thing with the PSP, the fat system, back in like June.
1948181	1951222	And it's... It happens all the time.
1951422	1951902	So just...
1953991	1954512	Don't get excited.
1954532	1955032	Calm down.
1955232	1959057	If you're getting excited, you're like, oh my god, they're finally going to release the pink Wii.
1959197	1961219	You're like, get over it.
1961300	1966746	Trust me, they're not releasing any more colors because they're still not having trouble selling the original system.
1966806	1967887	They can't make enough.
1968328	1972553	When it starts to slow down and people stop buying them, that's when the new colors will come.
1973171	1977455	That's like a GameStop, like if you buy a new DS, they're giving away a Zelda frame that's made of cardboard.
1977795	1979217	And I'm like, I have a DS.
1979337	1980458	And he's like, but it's super rare.
1980538	1983160	And I'm like, so are the $120 to buy a new DS.
1983220	1986223	I mean, it's like, good times.
1986964	1987324	Not really.
1988305	1989206	You wanted to punch him, didn't you?
1990140	1990700	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2011914	2014316	DarkSakura actually got the thing off of the iPod.
2014356	2015376	Now it's just a piece of plastic.
2015396	2015857	I didn't get anything.
2039991	2041895	I'm mixing up the fake radio names, sorry.
2043017	2045423	I think this is like duct tape.
2046606	2047588	It's printed duct tape.
2048678	2053723	This is wonderful radio, you taking apart one of our three little things.
2053843	2055144	Awesome sounds there, doing that.
2055544	2062751	Well, hey, you know, since, Eddie, you're very sad that you can't get anything free from buying Zelda, you can get this as a Wii owner.
2063171	2066714	Nintendo is now giving away a Wii Remote Jacket.
2067014	2074241	That's right, this week Nintendo put out a press release that now there's this new sleeve that's coming out for the Wiimotes.
2074801	2076623	And let me start off by saying it's really ugly.
2077584	2078885	You know what's better?
2078905	2081587	Because Nerf did the same thing, and Nerf actually looks cool.
2082548	2085671	It basically makes your Wiimote look like an Egyptian mummy.
2085691	2090415	I don't know, I'd say it looks more like they're trying to... Except they didn't have plastic in ancient Egypt, Rob.
2091436	2093258	They're trying to retard-proof the controller.
2093478	2097582	Yeah, basically this is so that when you accidentally throw it at your TV because you're an idiot, it will bounce.
2097762	2100244	Or somebody else is like, so you don't hit people in the head with it.
2100304	2101005	I'm like, what? !
2102293	2107463	Well, I noticed all the padding's on the front of it, so obviously it's for projectiles flying against stuff.
2108766	2110008	Wow, you'll wee your eye out.
2111258	2118985	These are going to be shipped with all new Wii consoles, Wii remotes, and of course copies of Wii Play, because the Wiimotes come with them, starting October 2nd.
2119305	2121747	And so that means they should be on shelves by October 15th.
2121867	2125891	Well, maybe that's what the new SKU is then, since it was for October 2nd.
2127232	2131035	You can go to Nintendo.com too and get your own free one.
2131776	2135840	And then maybe that's the new box art is on the box that says, Now with free Egyptian tombs.
2136820	2138681	No, here's going to be the best part, though, about it.
2139042	2145626	If it does ship with the Wii console and stuff like that, who's to say someone actually is going to put it on their Wii remote?
2145926	2148247	Little shot there of Tootin' Common playing Wii Tennis.
2149108	2149708	And you know what?
2149728	2152890	That pretty much killed the market for those stupid Wii gloves now.
2154891	2158293	Son of Dad wants to know, do the Wii condoms have lubricant on them?
2159154	2159534	Yes.
2160274	2161515	No, but they are ribbed for her pleasure.
2161535	2163817	Have these Wiimotes inspired some type of new sick fetish?
2163837	2164857	That's disgusting.
2165157	2166018	What's wrong with you people?
2166598	2170922	Neoprenism Make sure to ask for them to be ribbed for her pleasure I want them ribbed for my pleasure, please
2198534	2199175	Hold on a minute here.
2200977	2203659	Can somebody go grab my Wii so I can get that serial number off it?
2203839	2204860	I don't know if anybody's actually going to answer.
2204880	2208003	Thank you for calling Nintendo's Wii Remote Jacket Accessory Offer Line.
2208543	2210365	For assistance in English, press 1.
2215510	2221295	Thank you for calling Nintendo's Wii Remote Jacket Accessory Offer Line.
2221835	2223357	For assistance in English, press 1.
2225109	2225809	Where's my number pad?
2225969	2226990	Where's my keypad?
2228911	2229271	There we go.
2235874	2237514	Thank you for calling Nintendo Consumer Services.
2237554	2238195	This is ***.
2238275	2238915	How may I help you?
2239315	2242756	Yeah, I wanted to order the Wiimote jackets for my Wii.
2245978	2249079	Did you already go online and try, or is this your first attempt?
2249179	2250180	This is my first attempt.
2250240	2251180	It said I could call the number.
2256064	2260046	I was just checking because we have quite a few people who tried online and had some difficulties.
2260086	2261247	That's why I was... Ah, forget it.
2261267	2262247	I'm not going to bother with her.
2262407	2267670	That's so mean.
2268391	2269591	Just go put this back.
2270892	2273133	I mean, was she just going to belittle me?
2275314	2279617	Well, sir, I... I'm kind of like the stupid type, so... What's wrong with you, fool?
2285217	2286357	What's wrong with you, moron?
2286377	2289699	Why don't you go on the website?
2289719	2295101	At least we know it works, though.
2296421	2297141	The whole chat room.
2297161	2297461	Let's see.
2297902	2300562	Drew Nami says, don't fucking disrespect the call center rep.
2300903	2301383	I'm not.
2301843	2302143	Okay.
2302283	2304064	You know what, Rob?
2304124	2304324	What?
2304804	2306545	I worked in a call center for five years.
2306645	2306845	Yes.
2307265	2307445	Yeah.
2308853	2316376	What's the point if you tried online or not?
2316496	2317496	Did you try online?
2317516	2320077	Because really, I don't want to help you right now.
2320417	2323978	If you could just try online, that would make my life a whole lot easier.
2324399	2325899	So I wouldn't have to do my job.
2325919	2330981	I often do stuff like that because when you work in a call center, you usually have a time limit on how long you can take a call or else you get written up.
2332670	2332950	All right.
2333310	2335313	Wonder.Carol said that call center rep was actually nice.
2335333	2338556	She was, but she was told... Well, she gave you an explanation.
2338576	2339917	They probably make her ask that.
2340117	2340678	It was scripted.
2340858	2342360	You can tell what scripting sounds like.
2342400	2342680	Yeah.
2343601	2343881	All right.
2346984	2348606	All right, let's just move on with the show already.
2349167	2352490	First of all, Rob, never give me kettle corn again.
2352590	2353651	It's got cocaine in it.
2354652	2355113	So anyway...
2356377	2358358	Virtual Console for the UK.
2358959	2359779	If anyone's interested.
2359819	2362020	And the first one makes me just totally go WTF.
2363081	2365222	Even though I actually own the original of this game.
2366203	2367783	Fatal Fury for Neo Geo.
2368024	2368564	900 Wii Points.
2369885	2373207	Translates to 9 euro, 675 pound.
2375508	2377469	Yeah, it's the Neo Geo game.
2377649	2378469	It's Fatal Fury.
2378930	2379450	Next.
2380471	2382292	Hey look, Streets of Rage 3.
2383132	2384613	Which is actually a pretty good game.
2385749	2388390	I miss the old beat-em-up games like that.
2389411	2392612	Although nothing was ever as awesome as Battletoads and Double Dragon.
2395293	2406777	And moving forward, as soon as it decides to load, Golden Axe 3 at 800 Wii points, which was also, as it was known in the UK, Sega Mega Drive, which for us was the Genesis.
2408438	2410659	And remember, Genesis does what Nintendo don't.
2412105	2418769	And also, another Mega Drive game for 800 Wii Points, Super Thunder Blade, which actually wasn't all that fun.
2420289	2425452	And last but not least, Landstalker, The Treasure of the King Gnoll.
2425952	2430154	No, Treasure of King Gnoll, another Mega Drive game, which I don't actually think was fun either.
2431315	2431875	End of story.
2433936	2435037	Alright, anyways.
2436399	2450966	So, someday, there will be some more titles for the WiiWare service, because right now all there is is a couple channels for the Wii, but one title promised for early 2008 is going to be a game called Gravitronics.
2451787	2464253	It's being put out by developer Metaverse, and it's going to be a game, I guess, supporting up to eight players, and I guess it's going to be assaulting enemy territories using shapes.
2465353	2465773	Sweet.
2466513	2467554	So, death by shapes.
2467634	2474636	What is the deal with that whole, because I'm, speaking as a Nintendo fanboy, they were supposed to, like, have all this stuff, like, ready to go at launch.
2475136	2481898	And it's, like, a year later, they're still doing three games a week, and there's, like, literally hundreds of games between these three systems.
2482138	2486239	Or, Eddie, did you try going online and filling out the form to ask the question?
2486320	2486720	Because, you know.
2486760	2487420	I should, huh?
2487500	2489340	I should, like, call them up and be like, bitch.
2489581	2490061	Well, okay.
2490141	2491001	Here's one thing that.
2491810	2497353	A lot of the games, first off, weren't rated by the ESRB, so a lot of those had to go through that again.
2497373	2501556	A lot of them also, they have to be made to work with the emulators.
2501976	2503016	Okay, and stuff like that.
2503177	2505758	And then also, they don't give a fuck what you care!
2506098	2509540	They're just like, we're fucking Nintendo, you can't buy our fucking system.
2509780	2511521	Why the fuck do you want to get online anyways?
2511741	2514383	You need to get your fucking system first before you can get fucking online.
2514903	2516644	No, I know the semantics, but...
2522268	2523510	Nintendo Online?
2543300	2546882	It's such a scary world, that online out there.
2548302	2549923	You know, the Opera browser is awesome.
2549943	2553944	I like doing that on my TV, but there's really nothing else for Nintendo Online.
2554325	2554985	I mean, there should be.
2555933	2556573	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2575706	2578988	and then, oh my god, Nintendo caused the kid to get raped.
2579408	2579788	Oh no.
2580069	2582410	Just like the fucking Wii Jacket shit.
2582690	2584711	I mean, there's no reason that they need to improve stuff.
2584751	2594237	It's obviously idiotic people throwing shit through their goddamn TV and now you have this, like, stupid, like, foam shit on the, like, fucking remote that's gonna...
2595040	2595980	I guess Protector TV.
2596441	2596601	No.
2596741	2597361	The hell it will.
2597381	2598941	People will find more ways to do this.
2599061	2610325	Until this stupid thing that the Wii is going to sit in, the remote, it's going to be like this giant foam protective thing that's going to look like you're waving around a giant retarded glove or something.
2610785	2611726	I mean, seriously.
2612526	2613606	They're idiotic people.
2613666	2615747	They just need to get over that fact and just...
2616551	2617572	Start making better shit.
2617632	2620333	How should Nintendo be responsible for somebody else's idiocy?
2620733	2628416	There's no amount of protection that they're going to be able to give for these remotes to cause people not to play.
2628456	2630017	You should actually hold on to the Wiimote.
2630717	2632178	Even if somebody does...
2633095	2637697	You know, completely disregard an instruction that is blatantly written on the product.
2637757	2641318	Like five minutes before every game starts, it's like, be careful, the Wiimote.
2641778	2654303	Well, I have an example for you, and this doesn't necessarily have to do with a video game, but this is a primary example of how somebody can still basically bypass an entire law to get money out of a company.
2654343	2660125	I studied this in my business law class, so this is back to business law.
2660885	2662366	This person had a weed whacker.
2663243	2667105	and it said children under the age of so and such should not be allowed anywhere near it.
2667506	2668566	Do not swing it back.
2668646	2669347	Do not do this.
2670307	2673029	The company is not responsible if this is the circumstance.
2673349	2679633	Well, this kid was following his uncle around following this weed whacker and it bounced off of a rock which was not a fault of the machine.
2679733	2680574	It was physics.
2681214	2684876	Reach back and cut off this kid's leg.
2685076	2685376	What?
2686717	2691040	All of the things led up that it was operator error.
2692338	2693458	It was full operator error.
2693698	2695919	It was not the fault of the product, and they disregarded all the things.
2695979	2698700	However, they managed to get somewhere close to $2 million out of the company.
2701001	2703041	And so I use that as my primary example.
2703642	2709864	If Nintendo wants to be careful, then more power to them, because they're going to find ways to bleed them dry if something like that happened.
2710764	2711004	All right.
2711604	2715185	In the interest of keeping the show under four hours tonight, we've got to move on to the next story.
2715465	2717286	Lots of good points tonight, but we've got to keep it moving.
2717779	2718199	Halo DS Halo DS
2744318	2763614	Now, here's the thing, though, is that actually what happened is that apparently somebody was actually modifying an engine of another game to show that Halo DS could be done and Halo DS could be ported, and it was something that had come as an idea, like, hey, why don't you let us develop a DS port of Halo, to which the answer was a resounding no.
2764890	2765250	And Halo's boring.
2765270	2765350	Yeah.
2792401	2795964	If it had Wi-Fi network, it might be pretty cool and have the same multiplayer capabilities.
2795984	2800088	That's what I think, although honestly, you know, I just wish for Duke Nukem 3D on DS.
2800328	2800889	Heck yeah.
2801529	2803871	Along with the text, with the voice macros.
2804052	2805953	No, they do not need Duke Nukem 3D on the DS.
2805973	2807595	You need to fucking finish Duke Nukem Forever.
2808268	2809069	And now we're getting Ike.
2837261	2838142	Lucas, Mother 3, and The Wizard
2858283	2864125	As long as Lucas still has the ability to do PK Fire and PK Cross and all that cheap bullshit, then I'll be very happy.
2864145	2867927	You know, they should build one of those wireless communicators with Super Master.
2868547	2874510	Your mic is going crazy, Eddie, so we're going to unplug it, and you're going to have to borrow one of the other mics from now on, because the chat room is complaining about you.
2874790	2875670	Yeah, it's cutting in and out.
2875890	2876330	They can't hear it.
2876370	2876791	They can't hear it.
2876811	2877711	You have to use another mic.
2878171	2878451	It's on.
2878531	2879232	This is on a commission.
2879852	2880132	Oh, darn.
2881152	2881593	Sorry, Eddie.
2882273	2882673	Anyways.
2884061	2889826	In other news, the Wii is not going to meet the demand for this holiday.
2890307	2900777	So in case you were waiting for some magical delivery of Wii systems that was going to be able to put out millions and millions of units in the United States, think again.
2900837	2901738	It's not going to happen.
2901838	2905701	Reggie actually kind of originally claimed that there was going to be...
2907015	2910717	Plenty of units out there, but then went back to retract that statement.
2911278	2919382	And, of course, they're trying to up the quantities coming to the United States, but still they're not going to be able to make it.
2920643	2922624	I mean, I guess that's good that they're selling units.
2922984	2929468	I think it's still crappy, though, that after a year being out, they can't fucking produce more of these.
2929608	2933410	I mean, I don't think that there's anything in them that's really that revolutionary.
2936667	2938188	I don't know.
2939688	2941069	If you can find one, buy one.
2941129	2942850	That's probably the recommendation.
2943191	2945412	Especially if you want to get one for Christmas.
2947593	2948194	Alrighty.
2948614	2949174	Well, good luck.
2949314	2952997	Hopefully there won't be all the camping out and everything that people have to do again this time.
2953077	2954537	That would be kind of sucky.
2955298	2955598	I don't know.
2956739	2961682	Alright, well, there's been some titles announced for the Neo Geo
2962461	2964803	Yeah, but then again I paid about $100 for the cart, so...
2985083	2985643	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3016107	3018788	I said, and her boobs come out when you knock her out.
3019349	3029975	Well, other potential title coming out on the virtual console, at least the ESRB's put out ratings for it, is we have Echo Jr.
3030916	3036900	and Eternal Champions, which I love Eternal Champions, but I like Eternal Champions CD better, with the CineKills.
3037120	3037860	Those are so great.
3038581	3043264	Sonic 3D Blast and Light Crusader also have ratings out on them.
3044716	3045416	So yeah.
3046397	3047557	Hooray!
3048117	3049158	I want Vectorman.
3050578	3053439	Well, there's plenty of other stuff coming out in the U.S.
3053499	3053999	this week.
3055140	3065923	This week, we're going to see releases of such wonderfully average games as Looney Tunes Acme Arsenal coming out on PlayStation 2, 360, and the Wii.
3066984	3069825	Looney Tunes Duck Amok on the DS.
3072281	3078587	Mountain Bike Adrenaline, a game that's attempting to make mountain biking extreme or something.
3078607	3079748	It's coming out on PlayStation 2.
3081449	3086434	Honda SBK07, Superbike, also coming out on PlayStation 2.
3087135	3088756	And Backyard Football 2008.
3089297	3091559	Why the fuck do they still make more of those games?
3092179	3093280	Because they all suck.
3093741	3093861	Um...
3094950	3100515	Also coming out this week on the DS, Jackass, which I recommend that one because it's awesome.
3101737	3104960	FIFA Soccer 08 coming out on almost every single platform.
3105780	3110064	On Xbox 360, Half-Life 2, the orange box is going to be making its way out.
3110545	3112647	And also on the PC, that will be coming out as well.
3114349	3116571	Sega Rally Revo on Xbox 360, PS3, and PSP.
3121690	3127553	Bleach, The Shattered Blade, Bleach No, Flipper Critters, Touch Detective 2.5, Thrillville Off The Rails,
3149609	3154273	and on, let's see here, the Wii Mercury Meltdown Revolution.
3155113	3156174	I believe that's everything.
3156254	3157795	Oh, Folklore on the PS3.
3157835	3159717	That one's actually looking like a pretty good game.
3159737	3162358	It's gotten some pretty decent reviews as well.
3163439	3169284	And Final Fantasy Tactics, War of the Lions coming out on the PSP.
3170344	3171445	Ooh, that's supposed to be a good one.
3171545	3172306	I'm looking forward to that.
3172686	3174007	And then the last one, let's see here.
3174406	3177289	Star Wars Battlefront Renegade Squadron on PSP as well
3201903	3204765	Also on the PlayStation 3, The Godfather, The Dawns Edition.
3205505	3207666	So if you're a fan of The Godfather in Japan, you get that.
3208367	3213390	You gotta love this on the PlayStation 2, Colorful Aquarium, My Little Mermaid.
3214130	3214551	Yay!
3215911	3217892	This is not... Dating sim!
3217953	3220034	Yeah, this looks like some type of dating sim or something.
3220074	3223416	This is not some aquarium like Tetris Splash or whatever.
3223996	3226538	It's just a bunch of... It's a maid fetish game.
3226558	3228279	Yeah, it's anime girls in maid costumes.
3228319	3228719	There you go.
3228739	3229159	With kitty ears.
3229319	3229639	Exactly.
3229719	3230380	It's just, you know...

3240270	3243792	With the letter N How many freaking Namco Museum things do you have?
3243812	3245072	Do you need another one on the DS?
3245412	3256317	Yes They need to come out with like a DVD of these that's like every single Namco game ever made For real, looks like there's kind of a cool new version of Pac-Man on there I don't know if that's Pac-Man Versus or what the hell it is It is Pac-Man Versus Is that really?
3256897	3260659	Look at that, that's all right there on the Namco Museum on the DS Good times
3261144	3268950	Also coming out on the DS, Tecmo is putting this game out and it looks like, I don't know, some type of like spy game or something there.
3269830	3270811	I don't know if it's a point and click.
3270831	3271832	Yeah, it might be a point and clicker.
3271852	3273093	I'm not sure, but here's the name of it.
3273993	3282659	DS Nishimura Kaitoro Suspense Shintante Series Kyoto Atami Zekai no Koutou Satsui no Wana.
3284060	3285181	I know one of that game.
3286722	3289144	Yeah, I was looking at that and thinking of Snatcher.
3290668	3297474	I don't know if it takes longer to beat the game or pronounce the title, so it's all right there.
3299276	3302659	And on the Sony PSP, some movies come out for those of you guys.
3302679	3308063	They're still in the UMDs in Japan, and you can buy this week on October 12th, Lady in the Water.
3308484	3313969	Yes, the M. Night Shyamalan classic, and you can oogle those scrunts right there on the PlayStation 3.
3315413	3316293	Hey, how about somewhere else?
3316313	3319495	That's the sound I make when I'm taking a lady in the water.
3323536	3325537	Leaving sacrifices for the lady in the water.
3325677	3325997	Wow.
3327097	3329918	So shall I continue with the UK releases?
3329998	3335020	Actually, really quickly, Alpha Canogram says, Sky, that is the Pac-Man that Miyamoto helped work on.
3335460	3337481	So that's like the, I guess, newer Pac-Man.
3337601	3340002	Oh, in that case, let me buy another Pac-Man game.
3340962	3342943	That ain't stopped us.
3343917	3372143	So on the 12th in the UK, Blitzkrieg 2 Liberation on PC, Crash of the Titans on Xbox 360, Deadhead Fred on PSP, Donkey Kong Jungle Climber on DS, Folklore on PlayStation 3, Half-Life 2 Episode 2, Heroes of Might and Magic 5 Tribes of the East, NBA Live 08, Portal, Project Gotham Racing 4, Race 07 the official WTCC game, whatever that is.

3387905	3389086	I think I forgot to mention one.
3389126	3392948	I think this week also Donkey Kong Bongo Blast is coming out on the Wii.
3394108	3402952	I don't know if anyone should get excited about a game that was supposed to be on the GameCube featuring the bongos and now is on the Wii because we need another Wii game and it's a racing game.
3404167	3404789	I'm excited.
3406233	3406654	I tried.
3406875	3407517	I tried, guys.
3407557	3407838	I tried.
3412836	3419462	No, seriously though, there are some other interesting things happening, including more Guitar Hero tracks being revealed.
3419722	3423306	I swear to God, there's no surprise when you go play Guitar Hero 3 nowadays.
3423566	3428590	Which, by the way, this is how Activision keeps Guitar Hero in the news every week, and it's worked successfully.
3428750	3430832	Every week there's some damn Guitar Hero 3 update.
3431213	3433775	Well, there's only a couple more weeks until this game comes out.
3434876	3437118	But there is some good stuff being announced.
3437759	3439180	When You Were Young by The Killers...
3440250	3454414	Same Old Song and Dance by Aerosmith, Helicopter by Block Party, Stricken by Disturbed, Devil Went Down to Georgia, Black Magic Woman by Santana, Hit Me With Your Best Shot by Pat Benatar,
3469133	3472335	and The Seeker by The Who and some other shit.
3473256	3474977	Hit me with a wet sock.
3475858	3476678	Come on!
3479920	3480261	I don't know.
3480301	3482302	It's how we used to sing it at karaoke.
3486105	3490688	Me and my imaginary... Irene, don't say things if you don't have a microphone.
3490748	3493129	Seriously, you ruin the experience for the podcast listeners.
3493950	3494951	Us as studio are amused.
3496812	3498153	Anything else you want to announce on Guitar Hero 3?
3499714	3500394	Nope.
3501234	3504275	It's coming out on the 28th, in case you haven't heard, and that's a Sunday.
3505055	3505636	Hooray.
3506676	3516698	No, but seriously, though, they're going to have to keep all the attention they can possibly get, because about a month after that is when Rock Band comes out, and then, I don't know.
3517139	3519059	You know, a friend of mine used to sing it on stage once.
3519539	3521320	Whip me with your big cock.
3522240	3522900	Come on!
3524340	3526501	No, that was not my grandma, you fucking bastard.
3529946	3530266	Alright.
3533028	3533348	Alright.
3533929	3534249	Anyhow.
3535470	3536270	Moving on.
3537271	3541534	I will probably not be playing too much of Guitar Hero 3 because I'm too busy being addicted to MMOs.
3542572	3546034	and one MMO that maybe I should really check out sometime because I've heard a lot of things about it.
3546134	3548076	City of Heroes.
3548156	3564746	City of Heroes is actually going to be getting a new update called A Stitch in Time where the heroes will get to go into a new universe and get to relive some of the major events that have happened in the past to shape Paragon City, which is where all the City Heroes folks live.
3564907	3568009	Oh my god, such a ripoff of Final Fantasy XI.
3569099	3569679	Not really.
3570600	3571301	No, no.
3571381	3575023	I say no because this is letting them relive events that, you know, these games have been out for years.
3575043	3575383	I'm just kidding.
3575403	3575864	I'm not serious.
3575904	3577165	Both of the ideas suck.
3577365	3580627	Yeah, like they're the first people to ever think of, you know, going back in time.
3580647	3581287	Seriously.
3581307	3587372	Well, there will be new power sets including dual blades and willpower, new customization, weapons, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3587712	3589493	City of Heroes fans are excited, I'm sure.
3590674	3593716	However, I still have not checked out City of Heroes, but I've heard good things about chat.
3594196	3595497	Chat room, tell me about City of Heroes.
3595537	3596258	Any of you guys play it?
3596638	3597558	If so, what am I missing?
3597578	3598299	I know a few people who do.
3599179	3607181	I think that it's got this thing where I think it has some sort of rotating experience thing.
3608181	3608721	I don't know.
3608741	3611542	I think the best part of that game would be creating your character.
3612002	3615743	I could see myself sitting there for an hour in the create your character mode and then that's it.
3615823	3617683	And then at the end, Stan Lee remakes your costume.
3619043	3619603	Exactly.
3620224	3621044	And I get dismissed.
3622164	3627025	I have to throw away my costume because I'm not a true superhero because I tried to kick the baby.
3627557	3648981	Well, in other MMORPG news, and we all know that MMORPG means many men online roleplaying girls, for those who are playing World of Warcraft, which I am not numbered among you since my computer died, I am playing better games, well, they have done their own version of Oktoberfest in World of Warcraft.
3649661	3650541	Brewfest.
3651281	3654102	Which is really what Oktoberfest should be called anyway, don't you think?
3654502	3656222	Where you can run around and lederhosen!
3657057	3657697	And eat pretzels.
3658397	3658777	In game.
3660058	3661858	And listen to German polka, which is awesome.
3661918	3666399	You know what makes it even better is if you actually have significant amounts of alcohol there with you at your computer.
3667500	3675182	You can actually get these things in little brew fest vendors, and if you drink them, they actually give you buffs, they're useful items, but then they make your screen all wavy, and like, it fucks with you.
3675242	3676982	Like, if you have a, you know, if, what?
3677282	3678223	Oh god, here comes Irene.
3678523	3679823	How long have you been playing WoW?
3680441	3682942	Because they have alcoholic drinks, like, from the end.
3682982	3684022	No, but this one's different.
3684062	3687843	Like, instead of making your screen blurry, this one made my screen, like, pulsate.
3687883	3688563	It was really weird.
3688603	3691423	Like, I've only ever drank the alcoholic drinks that make the screen blurry.
3691723	3692984	And then they blur more and more as you drink them.
3693004	3693764	Isn't that kind of sad?
3693824	3696144	People that, like, drink alcohol in-game.
3696204	3697865	It's like, I'm too scared to try it.
3697885	3699465	Well, everybody tries it once.
3699625	3700365	I mean, come on.
3700605	3701565	In-game.
3701805	3703286	Well, yeah, because you want to see what your character's like drunk.
3703306	3704446	Like, is this what it's really like?
3704486	3706126	I'm never drinking ever again.
3706206	3707627	Like, it's pretty sad.
3708987	3709667	Someone take the mic.
3710020	3718624	No, I'll tell you what happens when you really drink in real life, is you get a bright idea to form an internet radio program with your friends, and then you can't escape it for over 250 weekly episodes.
3718964	3720825	No, Rob, that's when you're bored on the bart.
3721185	3722946	No, when you get drunk, you marry Irene.
3724987	3726447	No, no, no, that's a joke.
3726507	3729469	Eddie tells a funny joke and gets a 10-day resort job.
3729609	3730669	That's a joke from a party.
3731189	3733150	Well, that's just funny after a conversation.
3733971	3738833	No, Irene got married at a party when this guy was drunk, so... Yeah, his name's William.
3739273	3739473	Okay.
3739778	3740278	And John.
3768277	3769398	Yeah, my roommate, John.
3769678	3773721	We were all in the car, and we were talking about going to Vegas and wanting to go to Vegas.
3774202	3780206	And we were talking about wanting to talk about – because you know how everybody's – I think the topic of Britney Spears came up.
3780226	3782628	But you know how everybody's always talking about, oh, the sanctity of marriage.
3782648	3786471	No, we were talking about the sanctity of marriage, and we were bringing up examples of why there's no sanctity.
3786491	3788853	And those laws – and I don't mean to be political, but whatever.
3788953	3791435	The laws in those states pass.
3791595	3795058	Marriage should only be a man and a woman to protect the sanctity of marriage.
3795878	3799039	and then we talk about Britney Spears gets married in an old within 48 hours.
3799219	3801520	Excellent example of the sanctity of marriage at work, right?
3802020	3806062	So we're talking about who would you go to Vegas and get married and then divorce right away?
3806102	3811024	Like we were talking, let's go to, since we can't, since like, you know, us being gay, we can't marry each other.
3811264	3812164	Well, Jamie's already married.
3812184	3812724	She can't remarry.
3813005	3813885	But the rest of us are all gay.
3813925	3814785	We can't marry each other.
3815065	3815686	I can pretend.
3815726	3820067	So we're going to marry women and go to Vegas and just get married to a woman and then divorce.
3820227	3821548	So they were saying, who should I marry?
3821868	3824689	And then your name came up, Irene, as to somebody I should marry.
3826129	3827369	and I was like, no!
3827849	3829410	I don't even want to be married to her for an hour.
3831250	3832451	Why do you look so sad?
3832531	3834331	You can marry Eddie or something.
3834451	3835432	I would marry Eddie.
3836292	3837332	We're going to get married when we're 30.
3838012	3840073	Why did you look so shocked that I wouldn't marry you?
3840093	3841893	Because you don't want to marry me.
3841933	3843474	It would be a dysfunctional marriage.
3843594	3845674	It would be really bad.
3846035	3848035	Everybody wants to marry me.
3848535	3851756	I had the bright idea of having a group wedding and then a group annulment.
3852276	3853277	That's a great idea.
3853337	3854817	We should do that right now.
3855652	3856173	Forget the show.
3856513	3858895	Rob, Irene's already married to somebody that you know, so.
3859356	3859756	Oh, really?
3860777	3861337	Yeah.
3861658	3863660	Oh, did she marry my boyfriend when I wasn't with him?
3863720	3864240	Yeah, exactly.
3864480	3864881	Good job.
3864961	3866562	And he does crazy things to her all the time.
3866582	3867343	Are you putting out?
3868564	3869505	According to him, she is.
3869525	3871707	Do you see the pictures on my MySpace?
3871727	3872068	Yeah.
3872308	3873028	Oh, my gosh.
3873049	3874690	I mean, there's no pictures.
3874810	3875110	What?
3875491	3875631	Huh?
3876676	3881559	I don't really know what it... Maybe it's because I've been drinking a little bit here in studio tonight, but yeah, that had nothing to do with games.
3881579	3887381	Yeah, Irene... Loki's sitting over there doing like the... Either the I've got to go to the bathroom dance or goddammit, can we talk about video games?
3887462	3890363	No, Irene makes chocolate something that was on his shirt.
3896326	3896986	I like grapes.
3897467	3899168	Eddie brings the show to a screeching halt.
3899188	3901729	10 gamers score.
3902189	3903850	Anyways... I also like beer.
3905506	3906406	Beer is great.
3906847	3908127	Beer makes this show possible.
3927498	3935681	This mystical new 40GB PlayStation 3 SKU, which we had no idea was going to come out, is now made official.
3936121	3942983	And, you know, earlier this week there was rumors saying, oh, it's not going to be backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 games at all.
3943323	3948725	And then people were like, oh, no, of course it will be because, you know, they do it all via software emulation and that kind of stuff.
3949545	3951427	Well, come to find out, guess what?
3951668	3955252	It isn't backwards compatible with any PlayStation 2 games.
3955312	3962781	So they removed, essentially, a free part of the PlayStation 3 just to fuck you all over again.
3963142	3963202	Um...
3964125	3965465	So it is official for Europe.
3965926	3967446	It's going to be coming out here pretty soon.
3968266	3971367	It is not backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 titles at all.
3971767	3974428	It will be coming out on October 10th for a price of €399.
3975368	3981870	And it will only have two USB ports instead of four, which is not a huge deal.
3982390	3986531	And none of the multi-memory card ports, which is also not a real big deal.
3986591	3988472	But come on!
3988952	3991433	No backwards compatibility PlayStation 2 games?
3991453	3991853	I mean...
3992984	3998331	Yeah, I'm sure that they'll be busy playing your entire library of games for the PlayStation 3.
3998972	4001615	Why do you need PlayStation 2 games when you have Motorstorm and Lair?
4001976	4003658	Oh, well, my mistake.
4003959	4005641	Oh, you know, forgive me.
4005661	4008845	So it's not even backwards compatible with patches on the hard drive?
4009746	4010287	No, not at all.
4010632	4011632	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4031244	4034246	Well, why is it such a big deal when you have a PlayStation 2 right there on the shelf?
4034266	4035907	Do you really need it to play PlayStation 2 games?
4036447	4039670	I say yes, because A, I know people who don't own PlayStation 2s.
4039850	4040210	Imports.
4040610	4044232	And B, PlayStation 2s sometimes break a while later.
4045253	4047615	Well, but you can't play PlayStation 2 imports.
4047635	4048275	They're not region free.
4048295	4048815	I've seen them.
4049716	4051097	On a Japanese PlayStation 3, you can.
4051137	4051277	Nope.
4051954	4054155	No, you cannot play... There's video proof out there, I'll tell you.
4054255	4060258	You cannot play Japanese games on PlayStation 2s or PlayStation 3s of other regions.
4060358	4063319	Only PlayStation 3 games are region-free.
4063599	4065140	Then the game might not have been coded.
4065580	4069382	You know, it's just... It's really, really stupid.
4070503	4075685	I don't know what the hell they were thinking, but... Hey, if you want to, you know...
4076570	4077451	Buy one of these.
4077591	4078391	It will be available.
4078571	4080772	I mean, save yourself some money, I guess.
4080953	4083414	Maybe it's because they don't really want to cut the price on these.
4083634	4088237	And this is their way of, I don't know, getting people to buy the more expensive... I don't know.
4088257	4098403	The whole thing is they're like, well, we're offering these cheaper SKUs, but it's... Even starting with the 20GB PS3, it's like, well, we have this cheaper SKU, but it's kind of, you know, a little bit gimped.
4098843	4102385	So maybe just spend the extra $100 or whatever and buy the better one.
4103226	4104346	It's kind of what they've been doing.
4104386	4106368	It's like we're throwing out this crap car.
4107008	4115835	It's like you can either choose this car with no wheels, no steering wheel, no airbags, and no gas tank, or you could buy this Ferrari.
4116336	4117276	Which would you like?
4117757	4123822	I love this comment in the chat room from Escapist at chat.orangelaunchradio.com says, Reactions to criticism.
4124182	4125503	Nintendo gets angry.
4126023	4128405	Microsoft is sorry and tries to fix the problem.
4128866	4131808	Sony goes and pleasures itself in the corner while singing show tunes.
4132847	4134468	Clang, clang, clang goes the trolley
4146937	4147617	Let me put it this way.
4147978	4161026	If you're really serious on getting the PlayStation 3, and you're waiting for Metal Gear Solid 4, Grand Theft Auto 4, Final Fantasy XIII, I suggest you purchase the console closer to the time when these games come out.
4161406	4168190	Because by then, they're going to have about four other SKUs that will have varying degrees of crippled
4168570	4168911	DarkSakura.com
4192370	4193031	I don't get it.
4193151	4196253	I don't get why you would remove something that's free.
4196493	4197553	It boggles my mind.
4197994	4198914	I don't understand.
4199675	4201976	I'm just a girl who can't say no.
4202416	4204438	I'm in a terrible fix.
4206279	4207840	I'm singing in the rain.
4215305	4219007	This is great radio you have.
4219554	4220975	Too bad, is the camera on?
4221015	4222715	No, the camera shut off after 40 minutes.
4224356	4224656	Anyway.
4226277	4233380	But you know, I hear that there's going to be a new SKU or something coming out over here with Spider-Man 3 bundled with it, so hey, at least you have a fucking Blu-ray player.
4234681	4235121	There you go.
4235825	4240069	Well, obviously, needless to say, this news makes us a little bit agitated.
4240109	4242592	Especially for those of us that were hoping to clear the space on the shelves.
4242652	4245355	Or maybe see some upscaled PlayStation 2.
4245415	4246916	You know, that would have been kind of cool too.
4246976	4248157	Oh, I'm sorry.
4248318	4249699	Sorry to interrupt you real quick.
4249939	4256406	I forgot to add Sony's official comment to explain why they decided not to put backwards compatibility in there.
4256906	4257226	It says...
4258718	4259398	Let's see here.
4259838	4273941	There is sufficient choice in the marketplace, and we're still better off using that money that we put into backwards compatibility, either investing in new games or using that money to help support bringing the price down.
4274721	4283702	We have made it clear on many occasions that our priority is on developing innovative new features and services for the PlayStation 3, not on backwards compatibility.
4285063	4286623	Okay, but...
4287031	4290234	They have it built into the firmware right now.
4291215	4292336	Why remove it?
4292776	4294258	Because that's just being a dick.
4294318	4294999	That's what it is.
4296300	4298602	When you're a gent, you know you're a gent.
4308391	4309152	Needless to say...
4312122	4315164	This is the show tunes hour on Orange Lounge Radio.
4315464	4329572	I would like to remind you guys that Phil Harrison, about a year ago, said, Backwards compatibility, as you know from PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2, is a core value of what we believe we should offer.
4330032	4332974	And access to a library of content people have created...
4333735	4339058	All the game developers copied their controller design, forgetting that they copied theirs from Super Nintendo, so, you know.
4339078	4339759	Whatever.
4339779	4340339	Let's continue.
4340379	4340479	Sigh.
4362990	4367372	Well, actually, Sony actually released an official statement on the matter.
4378796	4381558	What is that song?
4383318	4387400	You can't stop PS3, you can't stop it, you can't, can't stop the PS3.
4390581	4392362	They probably think they're winning right now.
4395992	4397154	We are winning!
4397755	4399257	You can't buy a PS3 anywhere!
4402281	4402722	Sorry!
4403122	4403983	I mean, but seriously.
4404364	4406046	Every week it's a fucking story like this.
4406106	4406327	I mean...
4407705	4409386	Who the fuck is running their company?
4409426	4412048	I mean, how do they make these decisions?
4412388	4414109	Hey, let's have a... Chimpanzees.
4414189	4415750	I mean, who thinks up this shit?
4415810	4416351	I swear to God.
4416531	4417672	I made the joke earlier this week.
4418252	4427638	There's some guy on their advertising or marketing strategies team or whatever that's trying to get fired and come up with the stupidest fucking ideas and wanting to get himself fired.
4427878	4429159	And they're like, hey, that's a great idea.
4429179	4429780	Let's run with that.
4429840	4431421	And it's like, my God.
4432902	4433202	I mean, who...
4433803	4434904	Who thinks this is crazy?
4435064	4435604	You know what?
4435844	4442268	I think what they do is that they have those magnets, you know, that you make your own poetry out of on their phone.
4443289	4448952	And so they just, they reach in and grab like six of them and put them in order and that's their new marketing plan.
4450773	4453755	And it's not people that are picking them out, they're trained monkeys.
4454756	4456217	They're poorly trained monkeys.
4457698	4460560	And sometimes they have to wipe the poo off of them that they fling as they make it.
4472637	4489580	Kutaragi, here I go again My, my, crayons are delicious Kutaragi, here we go again No backwards compatibility on PS3 Hey, I need work So how many beers did you have, Rob?
4490180	4491080	Just one, amazingly
4495265	4505152	Now's a good time for the FUs of the Week, as our chat room is just, all I'm seeing in chat room is like dot, dot, dot, just right on down the screen.
4506233	4507734	Let's get into the FUs of the Week.
4507794	4510236	Ladies and gentlemen, we have some brand new old FU music.
4510256	4513818	We're bringing back an old FU tonight, and let's kick it off.
4513838	4520383	This is the part of the show where we get angsty, and obviously this news about the removed backwards compatibility, which seems to be a step backwards, makes us a little angry.
4520403	4523005	And if you disagree, send us an email, mailbag at orangehauntrader.com.
4523045	4523785	But I don't read it.
4523965	4524766	The FUs of the Week.
4540819	4543680	So, my FU of the week goes toward bitches.
4546441	4548162	Stupid, petty bitches.
4548182	4550643	But Jamie, then you're screwing yourself.
4550663	4551564	Thank you.
4552464	4552864	Okay.
4553825	4555065	This is what happened at work.
4555145	4559247	Now, people know that I like to leave detailed diagrams on how people should park in a parking lot.
4559907	4560928	I didn't do that this time.
4561528	4568611	I was pulling into one of the last parking spots at work, and there was this car that was double parked, and I nearly ran into their driver's side rearview mirror.
4569466	4574729	So, I back out, park properly in the spot, and leave them a note that says, Please do not double park.
4575749	4576570	I even said please.
4576630	4578510	It was either that or call security and get them a ticket.
4579251	4582372	And if they get ticketed enough, then they have to park outside the parking lot.
4583413	4584333	We have a gate in the parking lot.
4585514	4596579	So, I go back in, and I go out, and these girls are standing around my car, kneeling down by my tires, and I can hear these loud, echoing voices, and hear tire, and note, and this, and then my mother calls me.
4596599	4598000	I'm like, crap, mom.
4598442	4601324	So I'm talking to my mom, standing by the back door, watching them do shit to my car.
4601524	4602445	I have no idea what they're doing.
4603066	4606048	And then they get in their car and drive past, and then I hear, Oh, there she is!
4606488	4606909	Like that.
4607589	4609230	So I'm on the phone with my mother.
4609711	4613274	And you don't want to get into a fight with loud people when you're on the phone with your mother.
4614274	4616236	Although my mom would probably be very proud of me.
4616936	4618217	Not really.
4618257	4619178	Question from chat real quick.
4619258	4623301	SSJ100Matt asks, Where was youparklikeanasshole.com in this moment?
4624002	4625263	I didn't have any of the stickers on me.
4626192	4631195	So I go back inside, wait five minutes, go back out after I'm off to film my mom, and they're gone.
4631235	4634856	So I go back to my car, and I go about my business, everything seems fine.
4634876	4642440	You know, I have a magnet on my car that's a little rainbow heart, and I thought that they stole it, but it turned out that my husband took it off when he was driving my car when he was fixing it.
4643081	4649887	So I get back, and my tires have been low for a couple weeks, so I said, you know, I'm getting gas today, I'll go ahead and fill my tires.
4650608	4656653	And I tried to get the caps off on the passenger side, and the caps wouldn't come off on my valve stems on my tires.
4657473	4658715	But the other side was just fine.
4659095	4669344	So I ended up going to Bridgestone the next day, and they had these two wrenches to get the caps off, and it turned out that they put nail glue, like super glue, in the caps on my tires.
4669924	4670465	So now...
4671902	4678763	See, I think it would have been much better for them to be a little peeved about a little note than be fired for vandalism and harassment.
4680484	4682004	Because that's what's going to happen to them.
4682324	4690505	I have the exact time of day that they drove out of the parking lot, and we have cameras that record all license plates as they go in and out.
4690825	4695426	When you're hired by the place, when you get your new badge, you are required to give your license plate number to security.
4695866	4700267	They're going to be very fired, all four of them, and I am going to laugh my ass off.
4705050	4706371	Wow, I didn't know we had applause.
4706891	4709092	There's an applause light in here, apparently.
4709172	4709992	Alright, moving on.
4710332	4712553	No, no, no, because see, this is what I mean.
4712593	4713473	You don't fuck with me.
4714733	4716394	Loki, follow that.
4717294	4717494	F.E.
4717514	4720575	McDonald's for not knowing how to fucking cook french fries.
4720995	4723556	You just put them in the fucking fryer and push a button.
4723916	4724697	How hard is that?
4724757	4729038	But yet you fucking find a way to screw it up every single time.
4729938	4733419	I mean, seriously, fries should taste the same every single time.
4734179	4734599	Every time.
4734739	4737380	Because it's a button that you push.
4738540	4740281	How the fuck do you fuck up a button?
4740641	4741281	I mean, really?
4743622	4744022	Fuck that.
4744482	4745462	My FU of the week.
4746022	4747103	Oh, it's a pot.
4748123	4749864	Showing signs of support tonight.
4750504	4753725	I'm going to keep my FU brief tonight because the others were a little long.
4753965	4754725	Not that that's a problem.
4754785	4755585	My FU is brief tonight.
4755625	4757926	I'm going to give an FU to show tunes.
4758086	4758486	Enough said.
4761089	4762550	Papi, you're up next.
4764810	4769632	I give an F you to the California DMV for being slow as fuck, even online.
4770313	4773894	I paid my registration for my car two and a half weeks ago.
4774274	4775915	They still have not sent me my new tax.
4777615	4778456	And it's pissing me off.
4778516	4780076	And I'm waiting to get pulled over for it.
4780837	4781717	And it's going to suck.
4781737	4785158	Hold your... Hold... Okay, now you can applaud.
4786159	4786219	Yay!
4788388	4790710	How can you recant something that you never said in the first game?
4813646	4814106	Yeah, I did.
4814487	4815648	A couple weeks ago.
4816688	4817549	Rice Princess, your turn.
4817729	4820691	F you to recanting stuff that you never said in the first place.
4821192	4821952	Yay!
4822353	4824314	I'm sort of trying to clap.
4828037	4828797	Back to the show.
4831339	4835562	From angst and F yous to Harvest Moon!
4835582	4835642	Yay!
4837604	4842728	Harvest Moon, if you are a fan of farming, and actually I know there's some fans of Harvest Moon because I...
4843849	4845730	I dared to make fun of Harvest Moon.
4847430	4851152	Well, what else do you do on Harvest Moon?
4852412	4855233	I know we have some fans of Harvest Moon because I got yelled at by one one week in an email.
4855553	4857074	You're a fan of Harvest Moon, right?
4857094	4857714	Okay, well then good.
4857734	4858434	This ought to be good news.
4858994	4864496	The Harvest Moon creator, Yashuro Wada, has announced that the next Harvest Moon game is going to be online.
4865357	4869138	Meaning that between two and eight players can actually visit a town.
4869478	4872019	The only trick, we don't know what platform the game's on yet.
4872791	4875112	But the next Harvest Moon game will be online.
4877393	4878533	And it won't be Nintendo.
4879013	4879953	Well, not necessarily.
4879973	4880654	It could be DS.
4880754	4882374	That could be a very DS thing.
4883635	4884395	What are you going to do?
4884435	4885775	Have competitive cow milking?
4886055	4888296	Stop releasing so many damn Harvest Moon games.
4888316	4891557	There's been like four this year already, and there's still more coming.
4891617	4892357	Well, no, I'm serious.
4892377	4893178	What are you going to do?
4893238	4894978	Have competing farms or some shit?
4895038	4896659	Or go visit other people's cows?
4897819	4899339	What the hell did you do in Animal Crossing?
4900359	4903100	You ran to towns and hit people with bug nets, and it was funny.
4903360	4904560	Or buried things in holes.
4904680	4906681	And you sent dirty letters to their townsfolk.
4906781	4909481	That's right, and you buried pitfalls in front of people's houses.
4909641	4912022	No, I'll tell you what you do in Animal Crossing.
4912442	4917903	You play the game with your best friend, only to have him backstab you and get the trophy first.
4919283	4921243	Did you forget, Rob, so easily?
4922744	4924024	Yeah, actually, I did forget.
4924044	4924724	Somebody's got some...
4925739	4926900	Hey, you know what?
4927220	4927640	It hurt.
4930562	4933303	Wait, you're seriously mad that I went and got the gold villager?
4933363	4934584	I was mad for like two minutes.
4934644	4936044	I was like, stupid motherfucker.
4936164	4937665	It's been a little longer than two minutes.
4937685	4938986	It's been like two and a half years.
4939046	4939786	Well, you know what?
4939846	4941287	I thought about it again, okay?
4942107	4943728	Jeez, work with me on this.
4945549	4945989	You know what?
4947130	4949591	I want factory moon.
4949611	4951272	Instead of having a cow on a farm.
4951292	4952172	You have a cow factory?
4952560	4955362	You have like a, you know, Cowschwitz.
4955923	4960206	Yeah, I was going to say, all they need to do is put a slaughterhouse in Harvest Moon and the game will be like ten times cooler.
4961627	4964409	Well, they do have... PETA will protest.
4964890	4970954	They do have Innocent Life, a futuristic Harvest Moon, which takes farming to the future.
4971595	4972075	Guess what?
4972395	4977079	It's just the same as farming now, except it's in the future.
4979901	4980522	Hurrah.
4982586	4984087	Let's go on to the next story.
4984147	4986069	I don't think there's anything more we can say on Harvest Moon.
4986750	4988231	Except that it's Harvest Moon.
4989412	4999581	So, this is actually pretty... And I love stuff like this, where they do studies about how video games improve your intelligence and your skills and shit.
5000742	5003845	They're saying now that action games improve women's spatial abilities.
5005947	5006347	Okay.
5008049	5009550	Because they didn't have any to begin with?
5010971	5012532	I'm asking a hypothetical question.
5013253	5018797	It says that it helps improve skills like geometry, technical drawings, reading maps.
5020038	5025262	Anything that has to do with space and how... Not that a woman would ever admit to doing that.
5025282	5031087	Why do you need geometry for shopping anyway?
5031728	5032208	Geometry?
5032248	5033029	What is that?
5033149	5033909	Geometry?
5033989	5034490	What?
5035390	5036391	I'm just kidding.
5038373	5039093	Here, take this back.
5039233	5049897	But it's more or less the cognitive function of how things fit, how things are laid out, space, judging distances, that type of thing.
5052258	5060220	But I look at it this way, that anything that you do that makes you use that skill should improve it.
5060700	5065202	So really, a video game could help with that, but so could actually...
5066306	5073548	practicing topography or, you know, spending time drawing or... Raising cows.
5074168	5075148	No, not raising cows.
5075748	5080809	So which one of those abilities focuses on using the turn signal when switching lanes?
5081609	5082110	You know what?
5082230	5084510	I have actually run across more male drivers.
5084650	5087091	I was trying very hard to refrain from the driving joke.
5087231	5088351	You should be very proud of me.
5088471	5092012	I'm very hard not to say, but will it make them better drivers?
5092092	5092792	I was doing very...
5093689	5094089	Very good.
5094109	5094590	You know what?
5094750	5096772	Gender has absolutely nothing to do with bad driving.
5096892	5100815	It's overall intelligence, and I've run across more male drivers who are worse drivers than women.
5100915	5103717	Okay, well, then this begs the point, why just women?
5103897	5105639	Why doesn't it give men better spatial abilities?
5105679	5109642	Because I think that they've just did the study on women.
5109662	5111143	Because we're uber awesome?
5111603	5111944	No.
5113285	5118149	Because I know that the majority of people in this room are male, but I'm sorry, testosterone makes you stupid.
5120330	5121051	Oh, snap.
5122865	5123966	No, no, no, no.
5124006	5125067	This is Rob's party.
5125527	5128509	What are you talking about testosterone?
5128729	5136154	I don't mean it like that, but I think that having a higher tendency toward aggression usually leads to less common sense.
5136194	5140397	Now JV Mon in chat room gives a comment that makes it all make sense.
5140737	5143999	JV Mon says men get better spatial ability from masturbating.
5144259	5146941	So you know how much clearance you need?
5149662	5149982	There you go.
5150122	5164728	See, I don't really think that men have, I don't really think, after living in a house and having my husband and all of his friends over, I don't think that, from that sample, I don't think that all men have good spatial ability or else they wouldn't pee on the seat.
5168069	5171230	And would learn how to close the seat when they're done.
5172471	5173131	Hey, you know what?
5173251	5175352	Some things are skill, some things are luck, okay?
5178530	5179270	Sinkstar R&B has been announced.
5204087	5207989	God damn, there hasn't been enough SingStar games this year yet.
5209409	5215651	But apparently a wonderful track list is coming out as well, including all sorts of fun stuff.
5215991	5225415	Black Eyed Peas, Pump It, Destiny's Child, Bootylicious, DJ Jazzy Jeff and the French Prince, Summertime.
5225855	5226555	That's pretty awesome.
5228075	5232457	Gwen Stefani, Hollaback Girl, and let's see here.
5233161	5247606	Luther Vandross, Never Too Much, Outcast, Idlewild Blue, Don't You Worry About Me, and Whitney Houston, Your Love Is My Love, among others.
5249166	5256128	And I knew it would take merely seconds for someone to make this comment, but Hippolytus in our chatroom says, Black Eyed Peas is not R&B.
5256148	5259709	That would take five seconds for someone to say that.
5260229	5262110	Don't tell my mother about this game, because she loves Luther.
5262737	5263077	Andros.
5263117	5263798	She really does.
5264478	5267881	And if you know my mother, she's... I think she likes both.
5267901	5272324	Well, neither... I don't think Hall of Batgirls R&B either, but, you know, whatever.
5273705	5274505	That's true, too.
5274525	5275026	Well, I don't know.
5275046	5275386	A little bit.
5276727	5276967	All right.
5277007	5284172	Anyway, let's go on to a brand new segment, which is going to be our last segment of Part A tonight.
5285177	5286619	Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week
5303724	5304925	I have the same old music.
5305485	5308807	I know, because the chat room was really like the old music.
5308847	5310888	It didn't want to see it go away, so we had to keep it.
5310948	5313670	So, DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5313830	5319553	The classic game of the week is Fantasy Zone, which is my second favorite video game ever.
5321154	5324216	Fantasy Zone is a game where you play as a little ship called the Opa Opa.
5325897	5328498	It's this little red ship with a window on it.
5328518	5331220	It has wings, but when it's on the ground, it walks.
5332621	5332721	And...
5333522	5334043	Listen to the music.
5334083	5335324	It's got the best music ever.
5341530	5342471	It plays a lot like Defender.
5344253	5344673	It is.
5344813	5346375	It's Chibi Defender, basically.
5346735	5347596	Anyway, you can keep reading.
5347616	5348777	We'll let this play in the background.
5358672	5359252	Good times.
5359313	5360333	I like how the ship has feet.
5381318	5384199	There was, and I actually have the other versions.
5384259	5387419	I have Fantasy Zone on Master System and Super Nintendo.
5387699	5388840	Fantasy Zone 2 on both.
5389960	5392680	I have, now Space Fantasy Zone was one that came out.
5393381	5395021	Well, it was a prototype only.
5395141	5397741	It was supposed to be out on the TurboGrafx Duo.
5398502	5401922	And I have a burn of it, but I haven't actually sat down and played it yet.
5401962	5405483	And then there was the Super Fantasy Zone.
5407024	5420993	Also, for anyone who's a fan of import and cast games, some of the enemies from Fantasy Zone 2 were in the final boss for the game, Segagaga.
5421534	5429099	But it's a fun little game, and also the Fantasy Zone is the same universe that Space Harrier was set in.
5429799	5435243	And you actually have a later level in Fantasy Zone that's the Space Harrier level.
5438976	5442738	Yes, currently our little ship, the Opa Opa, is fighting a big tree that's spitting leaves.
5443278	5443838	A tree trunk.
5444138	5444679	But it's cute.
5444779	5445179	It's cute.
5445299	5445579	It's okay.
5445599	5449401	Well, in the Space Harrier level, you actually fight low-eye heads.
5451222	5464728	But, um... Also, another thing, for anyone who was collecting the Sega Ages 2900 collection, they redid the whole thing in 3D, but it was still side-scrolling.
5465148	5466469	But when you did your, um...
5467469	5472111	Your bonus level where you have to go catch all these coins, it was in first person.
5472931	5474992	So, Rob, you played my copy.
5475212	5476533	Yes, it was kind of neat.
5476933	5483396	But it was probably one of the best Sega games ever, I think.
5485016	5485396	Alright.
5486957	5489058	And you can also go in shops and buy, like, anvils.
5490353	5491834	and Wings and Fairy Wings for your ship.
5491854	5494935	And you can buy Wings and you can buy extra boosters and different types of rockets.
5495955	5502017	But I just like you buy this big thing that's like the one ton thing that they drop in the Looney Tunes cartoons and just drop it on ships.
5502077	5502557	It was great.
5503837	5504438	Good times.
5504818	5505058	All right.
5505078	5507439	Well, Fantasy Zone is the classic game of the week.
5508039	5511100	So check it out at your local swap meet.
5511380	5515701	Or, you know, there's other ways you can go about finding a ROM of Fantasy Zone.
5515721	5516722	Two dollars on eBay.
5517322	5517562	All right.
5518336	5521597	All right, well, that's going to bring to a close Part A of our podcast.
5521657	5533521	But fear not, there's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come, like it or not, in Part B. And coming up tonight in Part B, since it is Episode 250, we have to do one of our very favorite segments, Match Game, coming up tonight.
5533801	5534822	That's right.
5534842	5535822	Applause.
5535882	5537663	Our new applause light is flashing, apparently.
5537843	5537903	Woo!
5538343	5540505	All right, so the match game will be up in just a little bit.
5540525	5542787	We'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.
5542967	5545089	Which, by the way, oh, I need to say one more thing about the show.
5545749	5552655	The show is now going to be released on, due to popular demand, instead of making it wait until Wednesday, you now get Part B on Tuesday on the feed.
5552735	5554597	I thought you were saying we were going to release it on Betamax.
5555498	5556538	Maybe we could, actually.
5556839	5557719	Dude, that would be cool.
5557759	5559461	We could actually find a working beta machine.
5559481	5561062	We'll have to go to the TV station to find that.
5562643	5564425	It'll be released on Laserdisc and Betamax.
5565345	5570208	Alright, and hopefully we will try very hard to keep Part B show tunes free.
5572269	5574250	Alright, we'll see, maybe.
5574610	5576911	Alright, we'll be back right after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5577492	5582474	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
5582935	5587237	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
